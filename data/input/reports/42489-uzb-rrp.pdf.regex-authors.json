Initial environmental examinations were undertaken for \nAssessment  four sample Tranche 1 subprojects. An environmental assessment \nand  review  framework  has  also  been  prepared  to  guide  the \nenvironmental  assessment  of  other  subprojects  during \nimplementation phase of the Investment Program. \n \nInvestment Program  The Investment Program will improve water supply and sanitation \nDescription  (WSS) services in provincial cities and secondary towns across \neight  provinces.  Physical  investments  include  rehabilitation  and \nexpansion  of  the  WSS  and  sewerage  systems.  Non  physical \ninvestments include sector planning, policy adjustments (such as \ntariff  setting  and  regime),  project  management  (including \nprocurement,  contract  management,  scheduling  and  progress \nreporting),  service  company  management  (training  to  improve \noperations and maintenance as well as commercial and financial \naspects  of  the  business).  This  component  will  also  finance  a \ncustomer  awareness  campaign  and  hygiene  promotion,  results \nmeasurement and reporting. Key Investment Program outputs are \nincluded in a Design and Monitoring Framework. \n \nMultitranche Financing  The multitranche financing facility (MFF) offers more flexibility to the \nFacility  Government than other lending modalities currently available from \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB). It creates a sound platform for \na long term partnership in the sector, and combines project finance \nwith management and institutional support. Because it front-loads \nkey  analytical  work  at  the  start,  the  modality  allows  ADB  and \nGovernment teams to place greater emphasis on implementation. \nFinancing will be matched closely to project readiness. Tranches \nwill  be  prepared  (including  design  work)  with  funding  provided \nunder  previous  ones.  This  should  speed  up  contract  awards, \ndisbursements and results. A stand-alone project modality would \nnot  offer  the  same  predictability  and  continuity,  a  program  loan \nwould not address investment needs and a sector loan is more \nsuitable for smaller scale and repetitive or similar investments. The \nunderlying policies for the Investment Program are embedded in a \npolicy framework approved by the Government.  \n \nRationale  Uzbekistan  has  a  Poverty  Reduction  and  Welfare  Improvement \n ", "ii   \nStrategy.  It  identifies  access  to  safe  water  and  sanitation  as  a \nmeans  for  economic  development  and  poverty  reduction.  The \nGovernment\u2019s intention is to reach within the next decade 100% \nservice coverage in urban areas and 85% in rural areas. These \ntargets are backed by a policy framework and a sector investment \nplan amounting to $1.2 billion by 2012 and $2.9 billion by 2020. In \nJune 2008, a resolution of the President (#890, 2008) ranked or \nprioritized these investments and authorized external financing in \nan  amount  of  $709  million  between  2008\u20132012.  The  policy \nframework calls for greater institutional effectiveness, better service \nperformance  and  management,  improved  operational  and \ncommercial  efficiencies,  higher  cost  recovery  rates  and  tighter \nfinancial controls. The policy framework paves the way for piloting a \nvariety of public private partnership contracts for bulk water supply \nand  performance  based  service  contracts  for  small  town \nvodokanals  (water  supply  agencies).  The  Government  also \nanticipates  the  merger  of  small  district  vodokanals,  and  the \nintroduction  of  performance  benchmarking  for  WSS  operations. \nFinally, the policy framework adds water quality and continuity to \nthe service targets. The strategy on poverty reduction and welfare \nimprovement, the policy framework, and the sector investment plan \nare the three main building blocks behind the sector roadmap.  \n \nTranche  1  of  the  Investment  Program  will  follow  a  sector  loan \napproach. All other tranches will be fully prepared and designed \nbefore approving their financing. Most first tranche investments are \nready for implementation but a few require further preparatory work. \nThe  sector  loan  approach  allows  the  authorities  to  get  the \nInvestment Program off the ground within this financial year and in \nthis manner ensure momentum for management changes in the \nsector. \n \nImpact and Outcome  The  desired  impact  of  the  Investment  Program  is  better  public \nhealth and hygiene in the eight target provinces. The outcome will \nbe increased access to safer and more reliable water supply and \nsanitation services for 3 million residents. \n \nInvestment Plan  The proposed Investment Program is estimated at $375 million, \naccounting for 31.3% of the sector's investment needs up to 2012. \n \n($ million) \n  Project  Subsequent   \nItem  1  Tranches  Total \nPart 1: WSS Infrastructure  69.4  294.4  363.8 \nImprovement \nPart 2: Capacity Development and  5.6  5.6  11.2 \nInvestment Program Management   \nTotal  75.0  300.0  375.0 \nNote: In June 2009 prices, includes taxes and duties. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n ", "  iii\nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \nSource  Amount    Share (%) \nAsian Development Bank (ADF)   300.0    80.0 \nGovernment   75.0    20.0 \n  Total    375    100.0 \nADF = Asian Development Fund. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nMFF Amount and Terms  It is proposed that ADB finance the Investment Program through an \nMFF in an amount up to the equivalent of $300 million from ADB \nSpecial Funds resources.1 The MFF will consist of several loans2 to \nfinance a range of project activities under the Investment Program \n \nThe  loans  under  the  MFF  will  finance  civil  works,  equipment, \nconsulting  services,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities. \nAppropriate frameworks that meet the requirements and conditions \nof ADB's environmental and social safeguards policies and OM \nSection H3/OP 2008, paras. 7 and 10 (Cost Sharing and Eligibility \nof  Expenditures  for  ADB  Financing),  have  been  prepared.  The \nloans may be provided in sequence or simultaneously, and some \nmay overlap in time with one another. However, subsequent loans \nwill match project readiness, including the completion of design \nwork.  \n \nFor Tranche 1, the loan will have a term of 32 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1% per annum \nduring  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  The \nGovernment will relend the proceeds of the loan to Uzbekistan \nAgency  \"Uzkommunhizmat\"  (UCSA)  under  a  subsidiary  loan \nagreement. UCSA will onlend the proceeds of the subsidiary loan \nto  the  participating  provincial  governments  on  the  same  terms. \nProvincial government means khokimiyat (the provincial body of \nexecutive power) under the national legislation of Uzbekistan on \nlocal state power Ref#913-XII dated 3 September 1993. \n \nThe Program goes beyond the current Asian Development Fund \n(ADF) period. ADF funding will be conditioned on the availability of \nthese  resources.  In  the  event  that  financing  is  provided  under \nADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR),  any  additional  OCR \nfinancing  will  be  accompanied  by  a  corresponding  reduction  in \nAsian  Development  Fund  financing.  The  total  available  amount \nunder the Facility will not exceed $300 million equivalent. \n \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2019 (the last PFR is expected to be submitted by 31 \nDecember 2013). \n \nEstimated Program  31 December 2018 \nCompletion Date   \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008. Mainstreaming the Multitranche Financing Facility. Manila. \n2  In addition to Tranche 1, three investment tranches are anticipated. \n ", "iv   \nImplementation  UCSA will be the executing agency. UCSA is currently executing \nArrangements  four  ADB  projects.  The  MFF  includes  financing  to  develop  and \nexpand  the  capacity  of  UCSA.  The  scope  of  this  assistance  is \nincluded under a program management facility (PMF). \n \nA program preparation and management unit (PPMU) is already in \nplace  in  UCSA.  This  will  be  supported  by  the  PMF.  UCSA  will \nprepare PFR submissions, including appraisal and design of future \nprojects.  Through  project  implementation  units,  the  provincial \ngovernments will implement their own projects.  \n \nOverall policy direction and guidance for the Investment Program \nwill be provided by the inter-agency council for cooperation with \ninternational  financial  institutions,  organizations  and  donor \ncountries,  implementation  of  large  and  strategically  important \nprojects, established in accordance with Resolution N-229 dated 12 \nAugust 2009 of the Cabinet of Ministers. \n \nImplementation of the Investment Program is facilitated through the \nuse of a Facility Administration Memorandum (FAM). This will be \nthe  main  tool  to  track  all  key  implementation  tasks.  A  Project \nAdministration Memorandum (PAM) is developed for Tranche 1. \nContract awards and disbursement projections are included in the \nPAM. \n \nCommunity Participation  Public consultations were held in four sample subproject towns. \nCommunity  priorities  expressed  during  these  meetings  are \nincorporated into the investments. A consultation and participation \nplan has been prepared to guide the preparation of the remaining \nsubprojects and tranches. \n \nProcurement  All goods and works to be financed by ADB under the facility will be \nprocured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines. \nInternational competitive bidding procedures will be used for civil \nworks  contracts  costing  more  than  $2,000,000  equivalent  and \nsupply contracts worth more than $500,000 equivalent. Civil works \nvalued at $100,000\u2013$2,000,000 and goods valued at $100,000\u2013\n$500,000  will  be  procured  through  national  competitive  bidding. \nShopping  procedures  will  be  followed  for  works,  materials,  and \nequipment  packages  costing  up  to  $100,000.  A  detailed \nprocurement plan and PAM will be part of each tranche under the \nMFF.  \n \nConsulting Services  The  selection  and  engagement  of  consulting  services  to  be \nfinanced  by  ADB  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and the procurement plan. \nThe following selection methods may be used: (i) quality- and cost-\nbased selection method with a full or simplified technical proposal \nand an 80:20 quality\u2013cost weighting; (ii) consultants\u2019 qualifications, \nfor assignments costing less than $200,000 per contract; (iii) least-\ncost selection for small assignments costing less than $100,000; \nand (iv) individual consultant selection. \n ", "  v\n \nBenefits and Beneficiaries  The Investment Program will improve public health and hygiene. \nThis  will  contribute  to  the  quality  of  life  of  up  to  3  million \nbeneficiaries  in  secondary  towns  and  cities  across  the  target \nprovinces. By 2018, water supply duration will improve from the \ncurrent 2\u20138 hours per day to more than 20 hours per day. Coverage \nwill increase to more than 95% with meter connections and physical \nlosses  will  reduce  to  less  than  30%.  Sewerage  coverage  will \nincrease to 70% in the targeted provincial capitals. The Investment \nProgram will also contribute to improvements in planning, project \nmanagement, cost recovery, vodokanal management and financial \ncontrols. \n \nRisks and Assumptions  Five  possible  risks  have  been  identified  and  addressed  in  the \n  design  of  the  Investment  Program:  (i)  delays  in  commencing \nimplementation;  (ii)  poor  project  management  and  low  quality \ndesign work; (iii) inadequate service management; (iv) delays in \nprocurement; and (v) a relatively low level of attention given to \nsafeguards, especially resettlement. Implementation work will be \nadvanced in all cases through detailed feasibility studies and design \nwork. In the case of Tranche 1, all subproject feasibility studies will \nbe completed by October 2009. UCSA will be supported by the \nPMF.  The  Investment  Program  includes  a  capacity  building \nprogram  covering  operational  and  management  matters.  To \nforestall  delays  in  procurement,  consultations  have  been \nundertaken with the relevant government agencies for the purposes \nof Tranche 1 investments. The same approach will be followed for \nall the other tranches. The capability of vodokanals in meeting the \noperation and maintenance of the expanded WSS systems is a \npriority under the Investment Program. Long-term and short-term \nadvisory  services  will  be  provided  for  this  purpose.  To  ensure \ncompliance  with  ADB  safeguards,  the  Program  includes \nenvironmental and resettlement frameworks and plans. Finally, the \nMFF will finance the services of advisors for results measurement \nand reporting.  \n ", "", "60o  00'E 69o  00'E\nUZBEKISTAN\nKAZAKHSTAN\nWATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION\nSERVICES IMPROVEMENT INVESTMENT PROGRAM\nVozrozdeniya\n      Island\n45 o 00'N Aral  Sea 45 o 00'N\nN\n0 50 100 150\nMuynak\nKilometers\nKungrad\nKARAKALPAKSTAN\nKhodzheyli\nNukus\nNAVOI\nAm Uchkuduk KAZAKHSTAN\nudarya R.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Water Supply and \nSanitation Services Investment Program. A design and monitoring framework for the Investment \nProgram is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Of Uzbekistan\u2019s 26.9 million people (January 2009), 9.6 million (36%) live in urban \ncenters and 17.2 million (64%) in rural areas. The average population density is 60 inhabitants \nper square kilometer (km2), one of the highest in Central Asia. The population density ranges \nfrom more than 565 inhabitants per km2 in Andijan Province to only 9 inhabitants per km2 in the \nKarakalpakstan region. The annual population growth is 1.4%.1 \n \n3.  The water supply and sanitation (WSS) systems were established under the former \nSoviet  Union.  These  were  all  owned  and  operated  by  public  enterprises,  supervised  by \ngovernment ministries and funded from the central budget. Most of the vodokanals (water \nsupply  and  sanitation  agencies)  have  yet  to  adopt  modern  management  and  commercial \npractices. Many are short on accountability and lack incentives to improve services. Inasmuch \nas water production facilities and customer connections are unmetered, consumption and tariffs \nfollow nominal rates. As a result, the vodokanals are poorly managed and underfunded; the \nwater and wastewater services are unreliable. Further, most WSS systems have reached the \nend of their economic lives and now require extensive rehabilitation. \n \n4.  Water supply. The water supply service across most provinces is poor: \n(i)  Urban  coverage.  In  urban  areas  it  is  fairly  high  at  89%,  but  its  reliability, \ncontinuity, or the duration of supplies are low. Rural coverage is low. \n(ii)  Continuity. Supplies are intermittent\u2014sometimes less than 2 hours/day\u2014with \nlow flow and pressure.  \n(iii)  Quality. High variability is observed across the country. Many rural areas do not \nhave access to potable water. Treated water is rationed for many consumers. For \nexample, the provinces of Bukhara and Navoi have difficulty providing adequate \nwater services due to lack of capacity at Damkhoja Inter-Regional Trunk Main \n(IRTM) and inadequate infrastructure. Water hoarding is common. Consumers \nincur substantial direct costs when buying tanker water or bottled water. \n(iv)  Water Pressure. Low pressure and flow are common on the upper floors of \nurban buildings. \n(v)  Technical condition of the water supply systems. Up to 70% of water supply \nsystems  need  replacing.  Maintenance  of  water  treatment  plants  has  been \nneglected. Unless major rehabilitation is initiated, many water systems may soon \ncollapse.  The  use  of  substandard  equipment  and  poor  quality  construction, \ntogether  with  poorly  managed  and  underfunded  maintenance  are  the  main \nreasons for the state of disrepair. \n(vi)  Unaccounted-for water. Unaccounted-for water is estimated at 60%, because \nof the deteriorated infrastructure, nonpayment of bills, and administrative losses. \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 2006. Uzbekistan at a Glance. Washington, DC. \n ", "2   \n(vii)  Efficiency. Inefficiencies in the distribution systems lead to high water losses, \nwhich  intensify  existing  shortages  and  increase  operating  costs.  Pumping \nequipment is inefficient and characterized by high energy costs. \n(viii)  Raw water quality. The quality and cost of water supplied depend directly on the \nquality and availability of raw water. Pollution threatens raw water sources in \nsome regions due to inadequate wastewater treatment and agriculture activities. \n(ix)  Cost recovery. Most water supply utilities do not cover their operating or capital \ncosts. This is due to tariff constraints, but also to poor commercial practices\u2014low \nbilling and collection efficiency, and high costs due to operating inefficiencies. \n \n5.  Sanitation. Some of the performance issues are as follows: \n(i)  Coverage. Only 48% of the population in 69 major urban areas is covered by the \nsewerage system. In the absence of piped sewerage, populations in both urban \nand rural areas rely on alternatives, i.e., septic tanks, cesspits, and pit latrines. \n(ii)  Treatment  of  wastewater.  The  provincial  capitals  and  larger  towns  have \nsewerage  systems  and  traditional  biological  wastewater  treatment  plants, \nincluding disinfection of effluent prior to discharge. But sludge treatment is only \npartial, using aerobic stabilization of sludge on sludge drying beds. Most aeration \nequipment  is  broken  or  not  operational.  The  untreated  or  partially  treated \nwastewater is a main source of surface- and groundwater pollution, which affects \nthe raw water sources in some regions. \n(iii)  Design  of  treatment  facilities.  Wastewater  treatment  facilities  were  built \naccording to the standards of the soviet time. There are few advanced tertiary \nwaste  treatment  facilities  to  remove  phosphates  or  nitrates  and few  modern \nfacilities for treating and disposing sewage sludge (centrifugation or incineration). \nMost sludge drying beds are inoperative.  \n(iv)  Efficiency. Most of the wastewater treatment plants are inefficient, leading to \nhigh energy costs. \n(v)  Technical  condition  of  treatment  facilities.  Some  treatment  plants  are \ninoperable  due  to  failure  of  concrete  and  steel  components,  pipelines,  and \nequipment. \n(vi)  Cost  recovery.  Cost recovery for wastewater management services is even \nlower than that for water supply. This is due to lack of commercial practices and \nhigh costs. However, it is further exacerbated by tariffs that, relative to the cost of \nproviding the service, are proportionately lower than that applied for water supply. \n \n6.  Sector  institutions.  Three  main  government  agencies  regulate  water  resource \nmanagement and conservation. The Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources has overall \nresponsibility for all large-scale surface water irrigation development. The State Committee on \nGeology and Mineral Resources is responsible for groundwater investigation, management, \nmonitoring, and protection. The State Inspectorate for Regulating the Use of Water in Industry \nand Mining regulates the exploration, development, and conservation of thermal and mineral \nwater.  \n \n7.  Uzbekistan Agency \"Uzkommunhizmat\" (UCSA) has overall responsibility for improving \nWSS services. It drafts policies, strategies, and standards and provides regulatory advice to \nsupport reforms. It also monitors local authorities\u2019 and commercial entities\u2019 compliance with \nsector policies, and is a focal execution agency for foreign investment to the sector. The Ministry \nof Economy (MOE), along with UCSA, has a significant role in sector planning, while the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF) reviews tariffs and clears all external financing. All externally funded \ncontracts need to be registered with the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, Investments, \nand Trade (MFERIT). The State Committee for Demonopolization and Supporting Competition \n ", "  3 \nand Entrepreneurship monitors tariff applications for all communal services, including WSS. The \ndepartment of finance in each province approves tariffs that are prepared by the city and district \nvodokanals in their respective provinces. \n \n8.  The State Committee for Nature Protection protects and manages the environmental \nmatters. This committee implements the government policy to protect the natural environment \nand water resources. It is responsible for monitoring compliance with standards for urban and \nindustrial effluents. The State Sanitary and Epidemiological Inspectorate, a department of the \nMinistry  of  Health,  implements  sanitary  supervision  of  drinking  water  for  compliance  with \nnational sanitary norms. Through its provincial and district sanitary and epidemiological services \ndivisions, the state inspectorate monitors drinking water quality in urban and rural distribution \nnetworks, as well as the environmental health conditions in public sanitation facilities. \n \n9.  District and city vodokanals operate the WSS services. The provincial administrations \nreceive operational reports from the provincial vodokanals, which coordinate and monitor district \nand city vodokanal performance in the provinces. In addition, six interregional water supply \nagencies manage and operate IRTMs. Each covering several districts and provinces, these \nagencies abstract, transmit, and distribute water to consumers. Some supply bulk water to \ndistrict or city vodokanals, while others operate as large vodokanals. \n \n10.  Government  policy.  The  Government  is  committed  to  improving  the  water  and \nwastewater  services,  including  service  targets  such  as  coverage,  quality  and  continuity. \nUzbekistan wants to meet non-income Millennium Development Goals and \u201cto halve, by 2015, \nthe proportion of the population without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic \nsanitation\u201d. These goals are ambitious, but the Government has adopted strategies, policies and \ninvestment  plans  to  deliver  them.  The  Government's  Poverty  Reduction  and  Welfare \nImprovement Strategy sees access to safe water and sanitation as critical for reducing poverty, \nand calls on central, provincial and municipal agencies to work on their improvement. A policy \nframework  captures  global  and  operational  level  principals  and  criteria.  These  range  from \nimproved  financial/commercial  discipline  to  maintenance,  rational  water  usage,  better  tariff \nregimes, greater private sector involvement, transparency, active customer care and higher \naccountability among the service providers. The strategy on poverty and welfare, the policy \nframework and a long term investment plan underpin a water and sanitation sector roadmap. \n \n11.  Sector reforms. The Government wants to reform the operation and management of \nthe WSS sector by introducing market economy principles. It has initiated reforms for this \npurpose, including (i) opening the sector for external funding and private sector participation, (ii) \nmetering customer supplies, (iii) decentralizing responsibility for daily operation of the facilities \nto the vodokanals, and (iv) allowing tariffs to reflect the full cost recovery of investments. The \nWSS sector was targeted for privatization in 2002. But privatization, which meant divestment of \nassets,  failed  to  attract  enough  investors.  The  absence  of  a  well-developed  regulatory \nframework, poor condition of the systems, and lack of assurances for cost recovery may have \ncontributed to this. The new strategy involves corrections to the regulatory framework and \ngreater flexibility in terms of the public and/or private sector modalities. Management contracts \n(performance related) and joint ventures are encouraged. Outright sales are unlikely to be \nsuccessful under current market conditions. The same applies to concessions. \n \n12.  Sector development targets. The National Water Supply and Waste Water System \nDevelopment and Modernization Plan for 2009\u20132020 targeted close to 100% water supply \ncoverage in most urban areas and 85% in rural areas by 2020. The Government\u2019s sector road \nmap estimates investment demands at $2.9 billion between now and 2020. In June 2008, a \n ", "4   \nresolution of the President (#890, 2008) prioritized these investments, together with planned \nexternal financing of $709 million (for 2008\u20132012). \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Key Problems and Constraints \n13.  Inferior WSS service delivery results from several factors, as summarized below. A \nsector problem tree analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \na.  Inadequate Planning \n14.  Planning in the sector remains highly centralized and focused on the replacement of \nexisting pipes, pumps, and wells derived from old practices and designs now more than 20\u201350 \nyears old. Vodokanals need to adopt a more commercial approach to running their businesses \nand to addressing operational inefficiencies. Failure to perform is accepted\u2014there is no penalty \nfor such failure and little incentive for success. Local and regional governments have yet to work \ntogether on reforming and strengthening vodokanals. Some actions needed include: \n(i)  shedding  or  spinning  off  noncore  activities  (i.e.,  construction  of  non-WSS \nfacilities); \n(ii)  introducing  modern  performance  tools  that  measure  results  and  encourage \npersonal accountability and initiative; \n(iii)  adopting modern business management practices and controls; \n(iv)  reorganizing business units to increase efficiency and customer care; \n(v)  changing the mix of staff skills and reducing the number of staff, as necessary; \n(vi)  initiating staff training programs at all levels; \n(vii)  developing  multiyear  performance  measures  and  targets,  allowing  for  more \nrealistic assessments; \n(viii)  forward planning with realistic improvement targets; and  \n(ix)  preparing business plans for medium- and long-term improvements and business \nsustainability. \n \n15.  The key to the success of the vodokanals is the balance between their autonomy and \nmunicipal regulation. Good regulation ensures that the regulator and the regulated utilities work \nclosely together to obtain the best results for customers. This entails a major culture change to \nservice delivery. To date, this relationship has not been well established due to the lack of \nenforcement. Vodokanals need to be responsible and accountable for managing and providing \nservices efficiently. On the other hand, the regulators must ensure that vodokanals have the \nfreedom and incentives to manage their own affairs, and particularly the gradual establishment \nof cost recovery tariffs. \n \n16.  Decentralization of WSS services attempts in the past had an unintended effect of \ncreating small, weak, and fragmented district vodokanals. Many entities are now far too small to \nbecome cost-efficient, self-sustaining operators\u2014with sufficient resources to attract good quality \nstaff. Rationalization and consolidation of district vodokanals will result in economies of scale \nand better customer care. \n \nb.  Inappropriate Design Standards \n17.   Standards are based on those that were used in the former Soviet Union. Consumption \nlevels for consumers were set at 100\u2013350 liters per capita per day, leading to the design of \nhigh-capacity systems and large pipes and pumps. Systems are thus costly and over-sized. The \n ", "  5 \ncombination of long pipelines and high flow rates have resulted in high energy consumption and \nhigh operating costs. This leads to low business profit margins. Rigid design standards make it \ndifficult to apply alternative service options, such as tanker delivery to remote rural communities. \nIn the sanitation sector, all wastewater treatment plants follow a similar design approach. Some \nalternatives, such as stabilization ponds (with anaerobic, facultative, and maturation lagoons), \nmay be cost-effective and environmentally sound options in areas with access to agricultural \nland. Methane gas can be extracted from the anaerobic ponds for energy and the treated water \nused for irrigation. But these options have not been fully considered. \n \nc.  Weak Corporate Capacity \n18.  The  Government  has  already  decentralized  many  WSS  services  to  place  greater \nownership, responsibility, and accountability at the local level, but this has had limited success \nat the vodokanal level. Before reforms can take effect, the entire sector community\u2014from \npolicymakers and municipal officials to vodokanal managers, engineers, and technicians\u2014must \nplace greater emphasis on management and operational skills. Government policies need to be \nexecuted to strengthen (i) governance, (ii) regulatory relationships between vodokanals and \nlocal governments, (iii) the relationship between the consumer and vodokanals, (iv) private \nsector participation, and (v) human resources. Local governments and vodokanals need help to \nadapt to the new business and service delivery philosophies and restructure and improve \nperformance accordingly. \n \nd.  Infrastructure Gaps \n19.  Infrastructure and operating assets are greatly deteriorated because of poor materials, \nadvanced age of the system, and inadequate maintenance. Water supply pipes are made of \nuntreated steel, which is susceptible to corrosion. Submersible pumps function for less than a \nyear  before  requiring  a  major  overhaul.  Many  systems  operate  at  low  service  levels  with \nfrequent  outages,  while  some  are  close  to  collapsing.  Most  of  the  infrastructure  requires \nimmediate rehabilitation and/or reconstruction.  \n \ne.  Limited Financial Resources \n20.  WSS  services  under  the  Soviet  Union  were  heavily  subsidized  by  the  central \ngovernment. System planning did not focus on cost recovery or least-cost design options, which \nresulted  in  inefficient  systems.  Vodokanals  cannot  maintain  existing  systems  without \nsubstantially  improving  management  structures  and  financial  resources,  let  alone  extend \nservices. Tariff rates are based on water loss and consumption norms for electricity and other \nmaterials. With the networks and equipment in their current state of deterioration, however, \nactual loss exceeds these norms. Hence, tariffs are often inadequate to cover actual financial \ncosts for providing the services. To overcome this, vodokanals must be made more accountable, \ndeliver  consistently  much  better  services,  and  adopt  a  customer-oriented  approach.  Tariff \nincreases are then more acceptable to consumers. Service quality improvements, followed by \ntariff increases and cost recovery, are essential to ensure the proper operation of new assets. \n \n21.  Raising water and wastewater service standards to sufficient levels will take years. This \nis because of the discrepancy between the large investment demands and the limited resources \nthat the Government can raise under present financial constraints. It is clear that Government \nresources  alone  cannot  fund  the  needed  investments.  This  requires  exploring  alternative \nfinancing  sources  and  developing  strategies  to  ensure  that  funds  used  in  the  sector  gain \nmaximum leverage. These includes promoting public\u2013private partnerships (PPP), application of \n ", "6   \n\u201cuser pays\u201d principles, assisting vodokanals to be self-financing, and identifying those areas in \nneed of ongoing government support.  \n \n2.  Opportunities \n22.  Government commitment to reforms. The Government is committed to reforming the \nentire sector. It has put in place a legal framework to allow corporatization, commercialization, \nand  introduction  of  PPP  in  vodokanals.  It  has  a  clear  roadmap,  a  policy  framework  and \ninvestment plans to reach quantitative and qualitative targets. Some of the policy directives are \nyet to be adequately enforced or acted upon within the sector. The main reasons for this are the \nlack of expertise and capacity at the local level. The Government now recognizes that external \nassistance is required to deliver its reform measures, raise standards, increase responsibility \nand accountability among local municipalities and vodokanals, and improve performance. \n \n23.  Easy  to  achieve  improvements.  The  vodokanals\u2019  operational  performance  varies \nwidely. Compared to efficiently run utilities, their current productivity is low. But many easy to \nachieve and cost-effective opportunities for improvement exist. The reform package is designed \nto capitalize on these potentials and includes: \n(i)  Broader  focus. Service delivery should be significantly improved by moving \naway from the traditional vodokanal focus on technical aspects to focusing on \ntechnical, commercial and financial operations, including customer service. \n(ii)  Skills mix. Vodokanal staff is mostly unskilled. Changing the skills mix while \nrationalizing the number of staff, together with a sustained capacity development \nprogram,  should  yield  operational  improvements,  cost  savings,  and  staff \nincentives. \n(iii)  Improved  planning,  as  well  as  financial,  and  commercial  management. \nTraining of new and retraining existing managers and staff will yield significant \nperformance improvements among vodokanals. \n(iv)  Introduce better management systems. Introduction of simple computerized \ninformation  and  billing  systems,  metering,  leakage  detection  and  repair,  and \nproper reporting formats will improve the information available to managers and \ndecision makers. This will lead to better customer services. \n(v)  Tariffs,  investment  and  commercial  practices.  The  current  tariff  levels, \ninefficient equipment with high operating costs, and low collections mean that \nimprovement  in  any  of  these  areas  should  have  a  significant  impact  on \nvodokanal performance. \n(vi)  Autonomy. Giving vodokanals autonomy, relaxing the centralized controls, and \nincentivizing remuneration will encourage initiative, creativity, responsibility, and \naccountability in vodokanals. These are foundations for good management. \n \n24.  Public\u2013private partnerships. The Government supports private sector participation in \nWSS service delivery. A legal framework accommodates this. To attract the private sector and \nmake the WSS sector more creditworthy, the Government has called for the implementation of \nuniversal  compulsory  metering  for  consumers  by  2012.  Metering  is  vital  for  demand \nmanagement programs whereby consumers will pay for their individual consumption.  Outright \nsale of WSS assets is unlikely but other PPP modalities are encouraged, including management \ncontracts, joint ventures and build-operate-transfer (BOTs). \n \n25.  A sector analysis is in Appendix 3. \n \n ", "  7 \n3.  External Assistance and Lessons Learned \n26.  External  assistance.  External financiers in the Uzbekistan WSS sector include the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB), European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), \nGerman development cooperation through KfW, World Bank, and the Governments of the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  France,  Germany,  Japan,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  Spain, \nSwitzerland, and the United States. As of 2009, external assistance to the sector amounted to \nabout $300 million equivalent\u2014about $140 million for rural systems and $160 million for urban \nones. In addition, KfW financed the improvement of water supply in seven rural farm areas in \nKhorezm with a \u20ac12.3 million facility extended to Obi Hayot, a private operator. The Government \nof the People\u2019s Republic of China has provided a concessional loan of $17.3 million for a \nnational water meter installation program. External assistance to the sector is summarized in \nAppendix 4. Sector assistance is reasonably well coordinated among the development partners \nto ensure consistency in institutional approaches, policy reforms, and value added. \n \n27.  Lessons. Lessons learned from previous WSS projects2 have been incorporated into \nthe Investment Program design. Project implementation performance in Uzbekistan so far is not \nsatisfactory\u2014none  of  ADB  projects  have  been  implemented  on  time  or  within  budget. \nExtensions  and  cost  overruns  have  been  common.  The  implementation  plans  were  weak. \nProjects were mostly structured around many small-sized contracts, each requiring individual \ntendering and supervision. Project management on the ground has been mostly inadequate, \nwith  long  delays  especially  at  the  start  of  the  process.  Bureaucratic  procedures  within \nGovernment have not helped, particularly those related to contract price verifications. Other \nlessons  include  the  strong  focus  on  physical  infrastructure  and  inadequate  attention  to \nmanagement and service delivery performance and targets. Individual projects were mostly ad \nhoc and opportunistic in nature, disconnected from a sector roadmap and policy framework. \nFew,  if  any,  of  the  projects  allocated  sufficient  funds  for  developing  management  and \noperational  skills  at  the  vodokanal  level.  Such  efforts  should  be  preceded  (or  at  least \naccompanied)  by  incentives  and  accountability  targets  for  the  staff.  Individual  project \ntransactions have been scattered across many provinces at the same time, in many cases long \ndistances  between  them.  This  made  coordination  and  monitoring  more  difficult.  It  also \neliminated  any  prospects  for  achieving  critical  mass  and  economies  of  scale  during  the \nimplementation phase. One other gap is a relatively low level of attention given to safeguards, \nespecially resettlement. Counterpart financing was not always available on time and in the \namounts  needed  to  ensure  smooth  project  implementation.  These  deficiencies  are  being \ncorrected for the current portfolio and will be avoided in the case of future tranches, the approval \nof  which  will  require  detailed  feasibility  studies  and  Project  Administration  Memoranda. \nReadiness filters will be tightened and price verifications will be accelerated by doing better \nchecks at the preparation phase and sharing this information with the MFERIT. The project \nperformance reports will deliver on time better information on problems or issues, and the \nresident mission and the headquarters teams will work closely and seamlessly on solutions in \nclose coordination with the Government and the contractors. Portfolio review missions, chaired \nby a senior government minister, will be undertaken quarterly. As a general rule, implementation \nschedules will not be extended. These principles are understood and shared by the Government. \nAs a result, contract awards and disbursements are expected to increase under all existing \nprojects. These measures will be replicated in the proposed Investment Program.  \n \n                                                 \n2  Include ongoing ADB projects, findings and recommendations from Independent Evaluation Department website, \nand projects supported by other development agencies.  \n ", "8   \n4.  Investment  Program  Rationale  and  Multitranche  Financing  Facility \nJustification \n28.  The Government wants to provide WSS services as a means of raising public health and \nhygiene standards and achieve poverty reduction.3 A sector road map is in place. This is \nsupported by a strategy on welfare, a policy framework, and an investment plan up to 2020. \n(see Supplementary Appendix A). Investment needs run into $2.9 billion, of which $1.2 billion \nare more immediate (by 2012). The Government realizes that physical investments alone will \nnot achieve its strategic vision. Institutional effectiveness measures, and improved business and \nproject  management  practices\u2014including  greater  accountability  and  incentives,  customer \norientation, better tariff setting and fee collection, and service maintenance\u2014are also needed. \nThese additional measures form part of the roadmap and are conditions for the investment roll-\nout. \n \n29.  The Investment Program assists the implementation of key institutional reforms and \nphysical investments. It will also pilot public private partnership contracts for bulk water supply \nand performance-based service contracts for small town vodokanals.  It is expected that some \nsector  restructuring  will  take  place,  including  merging  some  small  district  vodokanals. \nPerformance benchmarking and targeting for WSS operations will become a feature of the \nInvestment Program. \n \n30.  The design and monitoring framework for the program splits the results into impact, \noutcome,  outputs  and  inputs.  The  results  projections  follow  a  problem  tree  analysis.  This \nhighlights the overall goal of the Investment Program (impact), the nature of the core problem \n(outcome), and deliverables and actions needed (outputs and inputs). The goal is to achieve \nbetter health and hygiene standards. The core problem is inadequate service delivery. This \nsituation needs redressing. The service improvement targets of the Investment Program are \ngiven in Table 1. \n \n31.  In terms of nonphysical issues, the aim is to raise institutional effectiveness, improve \nplanning and regulatory capability, modernize the organizational structure, and raise company \nand project management standards and skills. The cost recovery level is also low and needs \nattention, and the sector is short of funds. These issues are aggravated by poor information \nsystems plus weak accountability and incentives for the staff. The Investment Program will \naddress these problems  through institutional strengthening actions (rationalization of vodokanal \nstructure and staff composition, consolidation of vodokanals, autonomy and accountability of \nvodokanals,  tariff  reforms,  performance  benchmarking,  and  customer  orientation),  capacity \ndevelopment  (provision  of  operation  and  maintenance  equipment,  business  planning,  and \ncomputerization  of  financial  management  systems),  and  training.  As  a  result,  general  and \nspecific benefits accruing to the population are expected. \n \nTable 1: Service Improvement Targets \n \nIndicator  Current Level  Project Target \nSystem coverage  76%  >95% \nService duration  2\u201310 hours  >20 hours \nPhysical losses  >60%  <30% \nSewerage coverage  10-40%  >70% \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n                                                 \n3  Government of Uzbekistan. 2007. Welfare Improvement Strategy and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (2008\u2013\n2010). Tashkent. \n ", "  9 \n32.  The  MFF  is  proposed  as  the  modality  of  choice  to  extend  ADB  financing  to  the \nInvestment  Program  based  on  five  grounds.  First,  the  modality  provides  flexibility  to  the \nGovernment and ADB: It allows both parties to readily modify the amount and timing of ADB \ncontributions under each tranche. This is important in case the Government can raise additional \nfinancing from other sources (such as the private sector) or it needs more time to finalize the \nfinancing  packages  (design,  documentation,  reforms,  and  counterpart  financing).  Another \nelement behind this flexibility is that the financing to be provided by ADB can be closely linked to \nthe availability of resources within ADB (a matter made clear to the Government), as well as to \ncompliance  with  warranties  and  representations  made  under  the  framework  financing \nagreement (FFA). \n \n33.  Second, financing under the MFF can be linked to technical, institutional, safeguards, \nand other project readiness filters. The authorities can make specific loan conversions under the \nfacility  when  projects  are  ready  for  execution.  This  approach  facilitates  advance  actions, \nincluding documentation preparation and establishment of relevant administrative arrangements. \nThe MFF also combines the physical investments with advisory services. The latter include \nfinancing to advance work on capacity and policy actions, which at times could be precursors to \nmaking the actual physical investments. Third, the MFF allows ADB, the Government, and its \npartners to link the financing more closely to changes in the cost of projects bundled under each \ntranche. This avoids problems associated with cost overruns. Fourth, the modality allows ADB \nto enter into a medium-term partnership with the Government and its cofinancing partners, and \nin the process to create stability and credibility for the financing plan.  \n \n34.  Fifth, all the conditions for the use of an MFF are in place: there is a strategic context, \nroad map, policy framework, investment program, and financing plan. The channeling of funding \nvia an MFF provides ADB, the Government, and cofinanciers with a chance to avoid repetitive \nprocessing tasks. The modality moves analytical work up front, leaving resources and multi-\nentry points for ADB and its partners to focus on execution, capacity, and reforms. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n35.  The impact of the proposed Investment Program will be improved public health and \nhygiene across the target provinces. The outcome will be safer and more reliable WSS services \nto 3 million people. Capacities will be improved for planning and implementing physical WSS \ndevelopment, as well as at the operational or vodokanal level\u2014to operate the systems and \nprovide services. In the medium to longer term, the vodokanals will be strengthened financially.  \nPrivate operators and investments will also be encouraged. \n \nB.  Outputs \n36.  The Investment Program combines physical and nonphysical improvements in water \nsupply and sewerage subsectors through investment (Part I) and institutional strengthening and \ncapacity development (Part II). \n \n1.  Part I: Physical\u2014Water Supply and Sanitation Infrastructure Improvement \na.  Water Supply Development \n37.  This component will develop safe, affordable, and more reliable piped water supply \nsystems. It will improve the quality and quantity of water supply with an average of 115\u2013150 \n ", "10   \nliters per capita per day of potable water. It will rehabilitate and support limited expansion of \nwater  sources,  including  boreholes  at  identified  groundwater  sources;  water  transmission \nfacilities; storage and service water tanks; pumping stations (including replacement of inefficient \npumping machinery); chlorination facilities; and distribution networks. It will ensure individual \nmetered service connections, as well as structural improvements in plant and office buildings for \neach  subproject.  Operations  and  maintenance  equipment  will  be  procured  under  this \ncomponent.  \n \nb.  Wastewater Management \n38.  This component will improve sewerage systems and wastewater management in the \nprovincial capitals. It includes (i) rehabilitation of wastewater treatment plants or development of \nleast-cost  wastewater  treatment  facilities;  (ii)  rehabilitation  and  expansion  of  the  sewerage \nnetworks;  and  (iii)  rehabilitation  of  sewerage  pumping  stations,  including  replacement  of \ninefficient pumping machinery. Equipment for maintaining the sewerage systems will also be \nprocured under this component. \n \nc.  Sanitation and Hygiene  \n39.  This  component  will  develop  improved  sanitation  practices  and  positive  hygiene \nbehavior at local health clinics and among women and schoolchildren to prevent diseases and \nensure  maximum  health  benefits  from  improved  WSS  services.  It  will  provide  investments \ncomplementary to improved water supply into (i) toilet blocks for a selected number of schools, \nand (ii) hygiene promotion activities at all schools in the project areas. Children are the key \ntarget group for hygiene activities, and schools are the entry point. Gender-specific actions \nrelating to hygiene promotion are set out in a gender action plan. The activities and hygiene \nmessages will be appropriately sequenced with WSS investments. Innovative ways to spread \nbetter hygiene messages will be developed through a network of stakeholders to support the \nactivities  that  will  include  makhalla  neighborhood  committees,4 schoolteachers,  and  such \nnongovernment organizations as the Red Crescent. A baseline survey and follow-up surveys \nwill be financed to guide the development of targeted hygiene messages and an assessment of \nthose activities\u2019 impact. Details of this component are in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n2.  Part  II:  Nonphysical\u2014Capacity  Development  and  Investment  Program \nManagement \na.  Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Development \n40.  This component will help implement the institutional and financial improvement action \nplan under the road map. It includes \n(i)  transaction advisory services\u2014to carry out due diligence, design, and implement \na PPP contract for Damkhoja IRTM and performance-based service contracts for \ndistrict vodokanals; \n(ii)  a  district  vodokanal  rationalization  study\u2014to  prepare  a  plan  for  rationalizing \ndistrict vodokanals into sustainable entities and outline options for potential future \nPPPs for the rationalized entities; \n(iii)  benchmarking\u2014to improve the information available in the sector to facilitate \naccountability, regulation, management decisions, and PPP transactions; and \n(iv)  a tariff study\u2014to develop a sustainable full cost recovery tariff regime, including a \ntransparent and equitable cost basis for tariff setting.  \n \n                                                 \n4  A makhalla comprises the smallest administrative level within a community. \n ", "  11 \n41.  The  component  will  also  support  capacity  development  for  (i)  UCSA\u2014to  improve \ntechnical capacity and to create and train the contracts monitoring unit tasked to monitor and \nevaluate the PPP and service contracts enforcement, (ii) MOF\u2014to assist in implementing tariff \nstudy recommendations, and (iii) vodokanals\u2014to train their staffs. The institutional and financial \nimprovement action plan is in Appendix 5. \n \nb.  Program Management Facility \n42.  The program management facility (PMF) will support Investment Program management \nand  implementation  work,  including  incremental  administrative  costs  associated  with  the \nprogram preparation and management unit (PPMU) and project implementation units (PIUs). \nThe facility will fund consulting services to assist the PPMU and PIUs in selecting, preparing, \nand appraising subprojects and other tasks associated with implementation and management of \nthe Investment Program. Key components include (i) due diligence on technical, commercial, \nfinancial,  institutional,  safeguards,  and  other  matters\u2014to  support  tranche  preparation  and \ndocumentation;  (ii)  detailed  design  supervision;  (iii)  bid  document  preparation  and  process \nmanagement; (iv) bid evaluation; (v) financial management and accounting; (vi) construction \nsupervision; (vii) social, gender, environment, and resettlement management and monitoring; \nand (viii) results monitoring and reporting. \n \nC.  Project 1 \n \n43.  Project 1 will (i) rehabilitate the Damkhoja water source to increase the production \ncapacity to 210,000 cubic meters/day, (ii) rehabilitate and expand the water distribution systems \nin about 11 district centers in Bukhara and Navoi provinces, (iii) rehabilitate the wastewater \ntreatment plant and sewerage networks in Termez city, (iv) procure operation and maintenance \nequipment for the rehabilitated systems, and (v) construct toilets for selected schools in the \nsubproject towns and promote good hygiene awareness and practices. A performance-based \nservice contract will be piloted in at least one district vodokanal and a lease contract for \nDamkhoja  IRTM  operations  will  be  designed  and  implemented.  Project  1  will  also  include \nprogram preparation and management support to implement Project 1 and to prepare and \ndesign the remaining tranches under the Investment Program. \n \n44.  A sector loan approach will be used for Project 1 to allow more flexible investment \ndecisions.  Most of the subprojects are ready for implementation but a few require further work. \nFurther, some institutional actions need more attention. The sector loan approach will be used \nonly for this first tranche. All others will be fully designed before their funding is approved. The \napproach for the first tranche helps keep the momentum, especially with the reforms. The \nGovernment was also keen to see various actions taking place within this fiscal year. \n \n45.  Four  sample  subprojects  were  selected  and  appraised  to  develop  the  Project  1 \ninvestments:  rehabilitation  of  Damkhoja  water  source,  the  Karmana  and  Galaasiya  water \ndistribution networks, and the wastewater management system in Termez City. The four sample \nsubprojects  broadly  represent  the  Investment  Program  components  with  due  consideration \ngiven to (i) geographic and administrative locations and (ii) different sizes of the towns. \n \nD.  Special Features \n1.  Performance-Based Incentives  \n46.  Currently, vodokanals have little incentive to improve performance and customer service. \nThe Investment Program will create these incentives through performance-related contracts with \n ", "12   \neither private sector or public sector entities. District vodokanals are too small to be of interest to \nthe private sector. Thus, it is suggested that current district vodokanal management be put \nunder  a  performance-based  service  contract  and  receive  performance-related  pay.  Staff \nmembers would earn significant bonuses for achieving the targets in the contract. Conversely, \nthey would be penalised if they fail to meet the targets. Once the district vodokanals have been \naggregated and a new entity is sufficiently large, it will be possible to consider PPP contracts. \nOperation of IRTMs will be contracted through a PPP agreement\u2014most likely a lease contract. \nA lease contract, or a variation thereupon, is suitable since it would reward the operator for \nefficient  operation  without  allocating  investment  risk  to  the  operator.  The  concepts  of  the \nincentive-based performance service contract and lease contract are in Appendix 6. \n \n2.  Performance Benchmarking \n47.  Performance benchmarking is an important management and planning tool for raising a \nutility\u2019s overall performance standards. Performance data will be used to document current \nvodokanal operations, establish baselines to measure productivity improvements, and make \ncomparison among vodokanals and against industry norms. Benchmarking will help (i) water \nand wastewater managers to improve system operation, (ii) policymakers to introduce further \nreforms, (iii) investors such as multilateral organizations and the private sector to determine \nfinancing needs and possible involvement, and (iv) to measure relative cost-effectiveness of \nwater utility providers. \n \nE.  Cost Estimates \n48.  The Investment Program's total cost is estimated at $375.0 million equivalent (Table 2), \naccounting for 31.3% of the sector\u2019s investment needs up to 2012 (about $1.2 billion). Project 1 \ncost is estimated at $75 million. The total cost includes physical and price contingencies, taxes \nand duties, and interest and other charges during implementation. Details of the cost estimates \nfor the Investment Program and Project 1 are in Appendix 7. \n \nTable 2: Investment Program Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n    Subsequent   \nItem  Project 1 Projects  Total \nA.

Financing Plan \n49.  It is proposed that ADB finance the Investment Program through an MFF in an amount \nup to the equivalent of $300 million from ADB Special Funds resources.5 The MFF will consist of \nseveral loans6 to finance a range of project activities under the Investment Program, subject to \nthe Government\u2019s submission of related periodic financing requests (PFRs), execution of the \nrelated loan and project agreements, and fulfillment of terms and conditions and undertakings \nset forth in the framework financing agreement (FFA). The minimum amount of a PFR will be \n$40 million equivalent. The financing plan for the Investment Program and individual projects is \nsummarized in Table 3. \n \n \nTable 3: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n        Overall Share (%) \n  Investment    Subsequent  of Investment \nSource  Program  Project 1  Projects  Program \nAsian Development Bank (ADF)  300.0  60.0  240.0  80.0 \nGovernment  75.0  15.0  60.0  20.0 \n  Total  375.0  75.0  300.0  100.0 \nADF = Asian Development Fund. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n50.  The loans under the MFF will finance civil works, equipment, consulting services, land \nacquisition and resettlement activities,7 and institutional costs. The loans may be provided in \nsequence or simultaneously, and some may overlap in time with one another. The Government \nhas submitted the PFR for Project 1, requesting a loan of $60 million equivalent to finance \nProject 1. The loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and an \ninterest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. Other \nterms and conditions will be set forth in the related loan agreements. The Government will \nrelend the proceeds of the loan to UCSA under a subsidiary loan agreement. Relending will be \non ADB loan terms with an additional charge of not more than 0.2% (i.e., 1.2% during the grace \nperiod and 1.7% yearly thereafter). UCSA will onlend the proceeds of the subsidiary loan to the \nparticipating provincial governments8 on the same terms. The foreign exchange risks will be \nborne by the participating provincial governments. \n \n51.  It is understood that the availability of ADF financing for the Investment Program will be \nsubject  to  (i)  the  general  availability  of  ADF  resources,  (ii)  Uzbekistan\u2019s  access  to  such \nresources pursuant to ADB\u2019s graduation policy9 and the requirements of the ADF donors, and (iii) \nthe availability of such resources to Uzbekistan pursuant to ADB\u2019s policy on allocating ADF \nresources.10 In the event that financing may be provided under ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, \nany additional ordinary capital resources financing will be accompanied by a corresponding \nreduction in ADF financing so that the total amount available under the Facility will not exceed \n$300 million equivalent. \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2008.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Investment Program Management \n52.  UCSA will be the executing agency for the Investment Program, and responsible for \noverall program development, implementation, and management. UCSA is presently executing \nfour  ADB  projects  and  has  the  required  technical,  financial,  and  managerial  capability  to \nimplement ADB projects. However, this will be UCSA\u2019s first experience with the MFF modality \nand implementing projects across the Investment Program. Detailed capacity assessment has \nbeen undertaken for UCSA. Measures for developing and strengthening UCSA\u2019s capacity for \nimplementing the Investment Program are incorporated into Project 1 through the PMF. \n \n53.  Supported by the PMF consultants, the PPMU already established by UCSA under \nproject preparatory technical assistance11 will (i) oversee submission of the PFRs; (ii) undertake \ndue diligence, procurement, and evaluation; (iii) supervise detailed designs and construction \nsupervision; (iv) oversee safeguards compliance; (v) implement the hygiene and sanitation \nactivities; (vi) coordinate among government agencies; (vii) prepare progress reports; and (viii) \nmonitor and evaluate program progress and impacts.  \n \n54.  Each  participating  provincial  government  will  be  an  implementation  agency  for  the \nproject  activities  in  its  province.  A  PIU  will  be  set  up  in  each  participating  province  and \nresponsible for day-to-day implementation at local level. The major responsibilities of the PIU \nwill involve (i) participating in subprojects planning, detailed design, and bid evaluation; (ii) \ncoordinating the activities of consultants and contractors; (iii) overseeing construction activities; \n(iv) coordinating resettlement; (v) monitoring the social, gender and environmental impact of the \nsubproject  activities;  (vi)  supervising  local  institutional  reform  and  capacity  development \nactivities;  (vii)  coordinating  the  hygiene  and  sanitation  activities  in  the  province;  and  (viii) \npreparing  and  consolidating  subproject  accounting,  auditing,  and  monitoring  reports  for \nsubmission to the PPMU. \n \n55.  The  inter-agency  council  for  cooperation  with  international  financial  institutions, \norganizations and donor countries, implementation of large and strategically important projects, \nestablished in accordance with Resolution N-229 dated 12 August 2009 of the Cabinet of \nMinisters (Inter-Agency Council) shall be responsible for overall policy direction and guidance \nfor the Investment Program.  The Inter-Agency Council shall meet at least on a semiannual \nbasis to review implementation of, and decide on all major issues relating to, the Investment \nProgram.  Specifically,  it  shall:  (i)  provide  strategic  guidance  on,    and  oversee  the \nimplementation  of,  the  Investment  Program,  including  related  legislative,  regulatory  and \ninstitutional reforms; (ii) facilitate the endorsement of the subprojects and PFRs; (iii) approve the \ncreation of posts in the PPMU and the recruitment of key PPMU staff (including the program \ndirector, the financial management specialist and the procurement specialist); and (iv) ensure \ncompliance with environment and social safeguards and related requirements. \n \n56.  The implementation arrangements for the Investment Program are in Appendix 8. A draft \nfacility administration memorandum for the MFF and a draft project administration memorandum \nfor Project 1 have been prepared. \n \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Uzbekistan for Preparing the Water Supply and Sanitation \nServices. Manila (TA 7240-UZB). \n ", "  15 \n2.  Subproject Selection Criteria \n57.  While the subprojects under part I of the Investment Program have been defined at this \nstage,  the  longer  implementation  period  for  the  Investment  Program  implies  that  certain \nadjustments may need to be made during implementation as the sector\u2019s needs and priorities \nchange over time. Such adjustments will need to be systematic, should not contradict the overall \nobjectives and principles of the Investment Program, and require due diligence on all aspects. \nThe  subproject  selection  criteria  (comprising  technical,  social,  environmental,  institutional, \neconomic, and financial criteria) that will be used by ADB\u2019s approving PFRs are in Appendix 9. \n \n3.  Approval Procedures for Subproject and Tranches \n58.  Subproject selection for the Investment Program will follow an approval procedure, as \noutlined in Appendix 9. The PPMU will prepare PFRs for ADB financing. The PFRs will be \nformally submitted to ADB through MOF. Each PFR will contain the following: (i) required loan \namount; (ii) subprojects and components to be financed under the loan; (iii) cost estimates and \nfinancing plan; (iv) implementation arrangements; (v) results from the due diligence studies and \neconomic and financial analyses; (vi) confirmation of the continuing validity of, and adherence to, \nthe provisions of the FFA; (vii) confirmation of compliance with the provisions under the previous \nloan agreements and project agreements, as appropriate; and (viii) other information required \nunder the facility administration memorandum. \n \n4.  Implementation Period \n59.  The Investment Program will be implemented in approximately four or more tranches \nover 9 years from 2010 to 2018. Tranches will be based on the eligibility and readiness of \nsubprojects  in  terms  of  their  technical  preparation,  social  and  environmental  safeguards \ncompliance, other due diligence, institutional capacity of the implementation agencies, and the \nsubproject selection criteria. The implementation period for each tranche is to be not more than \n5 years. The implementation schedule for Tranche 1 is in Appendix 10. An implementation \nschedule for each of the remaining tranches will be prepared and included in the respective \nPFR.  \n \n5.  Procurement \n60.  A procurement plan will be prepared for each tranche of the Investment Program. All \ngoods and works to be financed by ADB under the facility will be procured according to ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and the procurement plan. The \nprocurement plan will be updated quarterly for the next 18 months of procurement activities. \nInternational competitive bidding procedures will be used for major civil works contracts costing \nmore than $2,000,000 equivalent and supply contracts worth more than $500,000 equivalent. \nCivil works valued at $100,000\u2013$2,000,000 and goods valued at $100,000\u2013$500,000 will be \nprocured  through  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB)  according  to  the  NCB  annex  in  the \nprocurement plan, which summarizes modifications or clarifications needed in the Borrower\u2019s \nprocedures to enable it to carry out NCB under ADB-financed projects. Shopping procedures \nwill be allowed for works, materials, and equipment packages costing up to $100,000. To \nincrease the contract size and contractor participation, the procurement of similar equipment \nand materials (such as water meters, pump machinery, and pipes) will be centralized and the \nequipment and materials will then be distributed by the PPMU to the PIUs for installation. The \nprocurement plan for Tranche 1 investment is in Appendix 11. \n \n ", "16   \n6.  Consulting Services \n61.  The selection and engagement of consulting services to be financed by ADB will be in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime) and the procurement plan. The following selection methods may be used: (i) quality- and \ncost-based selection with a full or simplified technical proposal and 80:20 quality\u2013cost weighting; \n(ii) consultants\u2019 qualifications, for assignments costing less than $200,000 per contract; (iii) \nleast-cost  selection,  for  small  assignments  costing  less  than  $100,000;  and  (iv)  individual \nconsultant selection. The outline terms of reference for PMF consultants is in Appendix 12. \n \n7.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n62.  For  each  tranche,  advance  contracting  of  civil  works,  equipment,  materials,  and \nrecruitment of consulting services may be requested, subject to their eligibility under the agreed \nprocedures and guidelines. Retroactive financing up to 20% of the proposed individual loans \nmay also be requested for eligible expenditures incurred before effectiveness of each loan but \nnot earlier than 12 months before the related loan agreement is signed. The Government and \nUCSA have acknowledged that ADB\u2019s approval of advance contracting and retroactive financing \ndoes not commit ADB to finance the relevant subprojects under the facility. \n \n8.  Governance and Anticorruption Measures \n63.  The Government has undertaken a series of measures that can be considered parts of \nits national anticorruption plan. These include (i) legal reforms intended to improve the fairness \nand effectiveness of judiciary and court systems; (ii) reform of public sector management, \nespecially public financial management and tax reforms; (iii) demonopolization measures to \nmake the private sector more competitive; and (iv) more transparent procurement procedures. \nThe Government is also active in international anticorruption activities, and in 2008 it approved \na bill proposing the country\u2019s becoming a party to the UN Anti-Corruption Convention. \n \n64.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  UCSA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the \nInvestment  Program.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption \nPolicy  are  included in the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the Investment \nProgram. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Investment Program \nshall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and \naccounts of UCSA and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as \nthey relate to the Investment Program. UCSA, PPMU, and PIU staff will receive training in \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy under the PMF. \n \n65.  To ensure transparency of the Investment Program, UCSA will maintain and update its \nwebsite with information on externally funded projects, including the Investment Program. With \nregard to the Investment Program, the website will provide information on, among other things, \nits subproject selection criteria and procedures, water tariff review procedures, results of annual \nreviews and adjustments, collection efficiency, procurement plans, amounts of the contracts \nawarded, the list of goods and services purchased, and their intended and actual utilization. \n \n9.  Disbursement Arrangements \n66.  The proceeds of each loan under the facility will be disbursed according to ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). Each loan agreement will \n ", "  17 \ndescribe the detailed disbursement arrangements agreed by the Government and ADB for the \nrelated project. An imprest account will be established for each loan to ensure timely release of \nloan proceeds and facilitate implementation. The PPMU will establish such imprest account \nimmediately after the loan takes effect in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \nand  will  be  responsible  for  the  use,  management,  replenishment,  and  liquidation  of  these \nimprest accounts under MOF supervision. \n \n67.  Disbursements from the imprest accounts will be supported by appropriate withdrawal \napplications and related documentation. Such documentation will demonstrate that the works, \ngoods, or services (i) were produced in and procured from ADB member countries, and (ii) are \neligible for ADB financing. The initial amount to be deposited into each imprest account will not \nexceed the estimated expenditure to be funded from the imprest account in the first 6 months or \n10% of the amount of the corresponding loan, whichever is less. Eligible expenditures may be \nreimbursed and liquidated, and the corresponding imprest account replenished, through the \nstatement-of-expenditure procedures. Each payment to be reimbursed or liquidated under this \nprocedure should not exceed $100,000. \n \n10.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n68.  The Government and UCSA will have the detailed consolidated Investment Program \naccounts maintained by the PPMU and audited by independent auditors whose qualifications, \nexperience, and terms of reference are acceptable to ADB. The Government will submit certified \ncopies of such audited accounts, financial statements, and the related auditors\u2019 reports, in \nEnglish, to ADB within 6 months after the end of each financial year. The annual audit report will \ninclude audit of the central imprest accounts and statement-of-expenditure procedure, and it will \nspecially include a separate audit opinion on the use of loan proceeds and compliance with \nstatement-of-expenditure procedures.  \n \n69.  UCSA will submit to ADB consolidated quarterly progress reports in English for each \nloan on all aspects of project implementation within 30 days from the end of each quarter. The \nreports will give the details of overall implementation progress, problems encountered during the \nreporting period, measures taken or proposed to remedy these problems, and the proposed \nprogram of activities for the next quarter. The reports will also include a summary financial \naccount  for  each  implementation  agency,  expenditures  to  date,  and  a  report  on  benefits \nmonitoring. Based on the quarterly progress reports, ADB will prepare annual implementation \nprogress reports to be submitted to the Board each December. The PPMU will submit to ADB a \nproject completion report within 3 months of physical completion of the subprojects financed \nunder each loan, as well as a facility completion report within 3 months of physical completion of \nall supported activities and subprojects under the facility. These reports will describe the details \nof implementation, costs, monitoring and evaluation results, problems encountered and actions \ntaken, and other information that ADB may request. \n \n11.  Investment Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n70.  The  PPMU  will  implement  an  Investment  Program  performance  monitoring  system \n(IPPMS) for each loan to evaluate delivery of the planned facilities and benefits accrued. An \nInvestment  Program  design  and  monitoring  framework  has  been  prepared  with  a  system \nframework and indicators. The PPMU will develop comprehensive IPPMS procedures and plans \nwithin 6 months after each loan takes effect. The IPPMS activities\u2014establishment of baseline \ndata  and  benchmarks,  collection  of  information,  benefits  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and \nevaluation of social impact\u2014will be carried out by the PPMU through the PIUs with the support \nof the PMF. Data will be collected at the same time as the socioeconomic surveys before each \n ", "18   \nsubproject is implemented. Data collection will then be done regularly during implementation \nand  for  3  months  after  physical  completion.  The  results  will  be  included  in  progress  and \ncompletion reports for each loan, and in the completion report for the whole Investment Program. \n \n12.  Investment Program Review \n71.  After a review of the quarterly progress reports, ADB will field review missions, as \nrequired, to discuss the progress of the Investment Program under each loan, any changes in \nthe implementation arrangements, or remedial measures that are needed to achieve the overall \nobjectives of specific subprojects and of the Investment Program. Additional reviews will be \nundertaken by the quarterly portfolio review missions to be chaired by a senior minister. \n \n72.  In addition to regular reviews, including a midterm review for each loan, a detailed \nmidterm review of the facility will be made 3 years after the first loan takes effect. The midterm \nreview for each loan under the facility will be in accordance with each loan\u2019s implementation \nperiod.  The  midterm  reviews  will  evaluate  in  detail  the  scope  of  the  facility  and  projects, \nimplementation arrangements, any outstanding issues, environmental and resettlement as well \nas other safeguard issues, achievement of scheduled targets, contract management progress, \nand other issues, as appropriate. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACT, AND RISKS \nA.  General Gains \n73.  The Investment Program will benefit approximately 3 million residents by 2018 through \nsafer, more reliable and affordable piped water supplies; improved wastewater management \nand sanitation; and good hygiene behavior. Water supply duration will improve from the current \n2\u20138 hours per day to more than 20 hours per day. Coverage will increase to more than 95% \nwith meter connections and physical losses will reduce to less than 30%. Sewerage coverage \nwill increase to 70% in the targeted provincial capitals. The beneficiaries represent about 11% of \nthe country\u2019s total population and more than 31% of its urban residents. Rural residents in peri-\nurban areas of subproject towns will also benefit. Health benefits, and particularly for women, \nfrom the physical investments in safe water supply and improved wastewater management will \nbe maximized as people become more knowledgeable and aware of health and hygiene issues \nand they are able to avoid the drudgery of collecting water. Participating provinces will benefit \neconomically from increased productivity as public health improves, less time is spent collecting \nwater, and water supply services are more reliable. Town residents will also benefit from cost \nsavings in health care. \n \nB.  Poverty Reduction \n74.  The Investment Program will bring about improvements to health, living conditions, and \nproductivity of local residents while contributing to poverty reduction in the target areas. Of \nabout 3 million total beneficiaries, approximately 25% of households are classified as poor. \nMany of these do not have piped drinking water and make use of street standpipes, where \nwater is provided daily according to set schedules but with frequent interruptions. Benefits from \nan improved water supply system will accrue to all present users, and poor households will be \nfully integrated into the improved system. Improving the wastewater management system will \nbenefit the population residing in downstream areas, including the rural population. Improved \naccess to safe and reliable drinking water and wastewater management will improve hygiene \nand sanitation practices, reduce the incidence of waterborne diseases, and improve general \npublic health. This will reduce household costs for medical care and the number of sick days for \nadults  and  children.  Poverty  and  social  analysis  will  be  conducted  while  preparing  each \n ", "  19 \ninvestment tranche, and such social indicators as the accessibility of water supply services for \ndifferent socioeconomic groups, health indicators related to waterborne diseases, and gender \nindicators will be assessed through socioeconomic surveys and monitored annually as part of \nthe IPPMS. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 13. \n \nC.  Gender Impact \n75.  The Investment Program will directly reduce the workload of women and girls who are \ntraditionally responsible for collecting and storing water for the household. It will free up their \ntime  and  provide  them  opportunity  to  become  more  involved  in  social,  economic  and \neducational  activities.  Female-headed  households  living  in  apartments  in  urban  areas  will \nparticularly benefit from improvements, because they currently have few alternatives to the \nintermittent and inadequate water supply. Data from recent surveys suggest that because of \nhousehold water shortages women and girls bathe less compared with men and boys. Males \nare able to bathe publicly in rivers and canals, but this is not an option for females. Similarly, the \nshortage of water means houses are not cleaned as often as necessary, thus contributing to the \nincidence of illnesses related to unsanitary and poor physical conditions. The gender action plan \nis in Appendix 14. \n \nD.  Ethnic Minority Groups \n76.  The sample subprojects in Tranche 1 will affect no indigenous peoples defined as such \nin ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). The subproject areas are fairly homogeneous in \nethnic composition. Eighty percent of the residents are Uzbek and the ethnic minorities (i.e., \nKarakalpaks, Kazakhs, and Tajiks) present in the identified subproject areas of Bukhara, Navoi, \nand Surkhandarya provinces do not differ in their water supply and sanitation needs or levels of \nservice. All will benefit directly from piped water supply, sanitation improvements, and better \nhygiene. An ethnic minority development framework has been developed for the Investment \nProgram. It will guide the preparation of future subprojects that may have positive or adverse \nimpacts on ethnic minorities. That framework is in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \nE.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n77.  Due diligence screening and categorization for involuntary resettlement show that the \nInvestment Program will have limited land acquisition and resettlement impacts, because most \nof the construction works will be located on property owned by vodokanals, on municipal land, \nor within rights-of-way assigned to municipal infrastructure. For Project 1, out of four sample \nsubprojects, only the Galaasiya subproject in the Bukhara Province will have a minimal land \nacquisition and resettlement impact. Affected will be 11 households whose residential structures \ninfringe on government land, plus 1 household will have some tree losses. A short resettlement \nplan conforming to ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) has been prepared for the \nGalaasiya subproject. Upon the effectiveness of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement in January \n2010,  safeguards  requirements  under  that  policy  will  apply  in  place  of  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy, Policy on Indigenous Peoples, and Environment Policy (2002).12  \n \n78.  A resettlement framework (in Supplementary Appendix F) has been prepared to guide \nUCSA and the PPMU in preparing land acquisition and resettlement plans for the remaining \nsubprojects (if required) and in updating them following detailed design. The framework outlines, \namong other things, the objectives, policy, principles, and procedures for land acquisition and \ncontains  guidelines  for  preparing  resettlement  plans.  A  full  or  short  social  safeguard  due \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2009. Safeguard Policy Statement. Manila (para. 81). \n ", "20   \ndiligence report or resettlement plan will be prepared for each subproject, depending on the \nsignificance of its involuntary resettlement impacts, and will form an essential component of the \nsubproject appraisal report. UCSA will screen subprojects before subproject implementation and \nensure, if needed, that the resettlement plan is updated before the award of the civil works \ncontracts in accordance with ADB\u2019s resettlement policy. Resettlement implementation will be \nmonitored  internally  by  PPMU\u2019s  social  and  environmental  subunit  and  externally  by  an \nindependent external monitor agency. A summary social safeguards report is in Appendix 15.  \n \nF.  Environmental Impacts and Benefit \n79.  The  Investment  Program  is  designed  to  maximize  environmental  and  public  health \nbenefits. Its physical components include rehabilitation and limited expansion of water sources, \nwater  distribution  networks,  and  wastewater  management  and  sanitation  systems.  Initial \nenvironmental examinations (IEEs) show that net environmental benefits are positive and large. \nThese include more and better quality drinking water from the water supply subprojects; better \npublic health, particularly fewer waterborne diseases through water supply, sewerage, and \nwastewater management investments; and improved aesthetics as a result of better water \nsupply, sewerage, and wastewater management. \n \n80.  The environmental subproject selection criteria will ensure that the subprojects under the \nInvestment Program will have no significant negative environmental impacts and no impact on \nenvironmentally sensitive areas. Any subproject with significant adverse environmental impact \nwill be ineligible. The subprojects will use simple, appropriate, and low-cost technology. Any \npotential negative environmental impact is mostly localized and temporary, and it can largely be \navoided  through  proper  subproject  design,  good  construction  practices,  and  other  tested \nmitigation  measures.  In  addition,  contract-level  environmental  management  plans  will  be \nincorporated in bidding and contract documents. Contractors will be supervised and subprojects' \nenvironmental  performance  monitored  and  reported  in  accordance  with  the  environmental \nassessment and review framework (EARF). All sample Tranche 1 subprojects are category B \nsubprojects according to ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). The summary initial environmental \nexamination  and  IEEs  for  the  sample  subprojects  of  Tranche  1  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendixes K and L. The EARF, which will ensure the remaining subprojects\u2019 compliance with \nthe environmental requirements of the Government and ADB, is in Supplementary Appendix J.  \n \nG.  Institutional Impact \n81.  The proposed institutional reforms will benefit the population by allowing more autonomy \nfor water and wastewater service providers to reorient and focus their efforts on consumers. \nReforms within government organizations will allow an enabling framework for vodokanals to act \nmore  autonomously\u2014albeit  with  defined  responsibility  and  accountability\u2014through \nperformance-based service contracts. Tariff reform mechanisms and improved financial and \noperational performance will lead to viable and sustainable businesses. Customer registration, \ncomplaint redress mechanisms, and performance benchmarking, together with management \ntools  and  capacity  development  programs,  will  provide  vodokanals  and  IRTMs  with  more \ninternal incentives and capability to deliver better WSS services. Introducing performance-based \nservice  contracts  and  appropriate  use  of  PPP  will  deliver  cost-effective  and  efficient \norganizations, which will eventually result in WSS services of better quality for consumers. \n \nH.  Economic Analysis \n82.  The  economic  rationale  for  government  involvement  is  sound,  as  the  WSS  and \nwastewater  management  services  are  characterized  by  monopolistic  conditions  and \n ", "  21 \nexternalities and have impacts on income distribution. The Investment Program is consistent \nwith the government\u2019s goals of enhancing economic growth and reducing poverty, as clearly \nreflected  in  its  welfare  improvement  strategy.  The  Investment  Program's  strategy,  which \ncombines physical investments with support for institutional and financial reforms and capacity \ndevelopment,  fully  conforms  to  the  government\u2019s  key  objectives  of  attaining  financial \nsustainability through an effective tariff system and cost recovery while improving operational \nstrategies by strengthening the sector\u2019s institutional setup, improving interagency collaboration, \nand building adequate capacity. The scope of the Investment Program is based on the priorities \nidentified in the sector road map and developed in consultations with stakeholders. It focuses \nlargely  on  rehabilitating  the  existing  deteriorated  infrastructure  with  due  consideration  for \noptimizing system design and least-cost solutions. The subproject selection criteria under the \nInvestment Program ensure that identified subprojects are economically viable, especially by \ndemonstrating an economic internal rate of return exceeding 12%. The economic analysis for \nTranche 1 sample subprojects is in Supplementary Appendix N and is summarized in Appendix \n16. \n \nI.  Financial Evaluation \n83.  The  financial  analysis  has  appraised  the  sustainability  and  viability  of  sample \nsubprojects proposed under Tranche 1 of the Investment Program, in accordance with ADB \nprocedures.13 Tariff adjustments for water supply and wastewater management are proposed to \nensure financial sustainability of the operations. The financial internal rate of return of the \nsample subprojects ranges from 4.4% to 8.3%, exceeding the 3.3% weighted average cost of \ncapital. Sensitivity analysis shows these internal rates of return to be generally robust and most \nsensitive to changes in revenues. All sample subproject vodokanals are expected to have \npositive  net  cash  flows  after  the  project  facilities  start  operating  in  2014.  Assuming  the \nrecommended reforms will be implemented, no additional subsidy will be needed. The financial \nanalysis and evaluation is in Supplementary Appendix O and is summarized in Appendix 17. \n \nJ.  Risks \n84.  Five possible risks have been identified and addressed in the design of the Investment \nProgram:  (i)  delays  in commencing  implementation;  (ii)  poor  project management  and low \nquality design work; (iii) inadequate service company management; (iv) delays in procurement; \nand (v) a relatively low level of attention to safeguards, especially resettlement. Implementation \nwork will be advanced in all cases through detailed feasibility studies and design work. In the \ncase of Tranche 1, detailed feasibility studies for all subprojects will be completed by October \n2009.  UCSA  will  be supported  by  the  PMF.  The  Investment  Program  includes  a  capacity \nbuilding  program  covering  operational  and  management  matters.  To  forestall  delays  in \nprocurement, consultations have been undertaken with the relevant government agencies for \nthe purposes of Tranche 1 investments. The same approach will be followed for all the other \ntranches. The resident mission and the headquarters teams will work closely and seamlessly \nwith each other on implementation. The capability of vodokanals in meeting the operation and \nmaintenance of the expanded WSS systems is a priority under the Investment Program. Long \nterm and short term advisory services will be provided for this purpose. To guard against non \ncompliance  with  ADB  safeguards,  the  Program  includes  environmental  and  resettlement \nframeworks and plans and a social and environmental subunit has been established in PPMU. \nFinally, the MFF will finance the services of advisors to assist PPMU in results measurement \nand reporting. An Investment Program risk mitigation plan is in Appendix 18. \n \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.

Sector Overview \n1.  The  Government  of  Uzbekistan  puts  high  priority  on  improving  water  supply  and \nsanitation  (WSS)  services.  It  recognizes  that  improving  the  quality  of  WSS  services  and \nexpanding  coverage  to  all  residents  is  essential  for  protecting  public  health,  raising  living \nstandards, and achieving the Millennium Development Goals \u201cto halve, by 2015, the proportion \nof the population without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation\u201d.1 These \ngoals are ambitious, especially considering the current state of the physical WSS assets that \nneed urgent repair to avoid major system failures.  \n \n2.  In the early years after independence, the Government focused mainly on rural water \nsupply but, in the past decade, it also has turned its attention to improving WSS services in \nurban areas, and this has now become a key focus. WSS systems in many smaller towns and \ndistrict cities have reached the ends of their economic lives and require extensive rehabilitation. \nIn addition, growing urban populations, improving living standards, and demand for modern \nservice levels require that existing systems be expanded. Providing high quality drinking water \nwhile improving living standards and public health remain key challenges to the Government. \nThe sector faces a series of issues in need of urgent attention: (i) rehabilitating deteriorated \ninfrastructure,  (ii)  improving  sector  development  strategies  and  planning,  (iii)  improving \nstandards  and  specifications,  (iv)  modernizing  institutional  arrangements  and  capacity,  (v) \nstrengthening water utilities (vodokanals)2 and providing additional financial resources, and (vi) \nupdating water tariffs to match the costs related to the improved WSS service levels. \n \n3.  Groundwater resources in Uzbekistan are becoming more polluted with salts, nutrients, \nand contaminants resulting from extensive use of agricultural chemicals in the collective farms \nover many decades. Many towns and cities are in water-scarce areas, with insufficient or poor-\nquality groundwater or surface water sources. As a result, water for the towns and cities is often \nsourced from aquifers which, in many cases, are more than 70 kilometers distant. This adds to \nthe cost of water supply. For towns and cities where local groundwater reserves have proven \ninadequate or unsuitable, a series of interregional trunk mains (IRTMs) and regional trunk mains \nhave been constructed to supplement the existing supplies. There are six IRTMs and three \nregional trunk mains in the country. These are the lifelines for supplying many industrial, urban, \nand rural areas and communities. The lack of local groundwater resources is now leading to a \nreexamination of surface waters and groundwater from river gravels as additional sources to \nmeet the ever-expanding urban demand for good quality water. \n \nB.  Policy and Institutional Arrangements  \n4.  Uzbekistan\u2019s WSS sector policy is currently defined by the following documents: \n(i)  The  national  10-year  water  supply  development  plan  approved  by  the \nGovernment in 1999 and revised in 2003. Technically, the plan was supported by \nthe  Updated  Water  Supply  Development  Scheme,  based  on  new  regulatory \nprinciples  and  norms  prepared  by  Uzbekistan  Agency  \"Uzkommunhizmat\" \n(UCSA).  \n                                                 \n1  United Nations. 2008.

This program\u2019s funding is in some cases granted \nby  joint  ventures  between  the  Government  and  bilateral  donors  (e.g.,  the \nGovernment of Switzerland via Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation. \nIn other cases, consumers must pay through an affordable repayment schedule.  \n \n5.  The above documents underpin the planning for Uzbekistan\u2019s annual public investment \nprogram in the WSS sector, with overall targets to (i) improve water supply services through the \nnational water supply development plan; (ii) attain financial sustainability of sector enterprises; \nand (iii) plan further sector needs and investments, including to mobilize external financing.  \n \n6.  Institutional  arrangements  in  the  WSS  sector  have  changed  significantly  since \nindependence in 1991. UCSA was established in 2000 as a result of the former Ministry of \nCommunal Services\u2019 transformation. Currently, UCSA has two mandates from the Government: \n(i) formulate government policy for the overall WSS sector, including to facilitate reforms, collect \nand analyze domestic WSS service and performance data, and advise the Government on \nreforms, investment programs, and decrees; and (ii) be the service provider, managing on \nbehalf of the Government the six IRTMs and three regional trunk mains. \n \n7.  There are 11 provincial (oblast) WSS utilities (vodokanals) in charge of water supply and \nsewerage services under the regulatory control of UCSA and oblast administrations. Oblast \nvodokanals have two mandates: (i) provide water supply and sewerage services for the oblast \ncenters (main urban areas, not including Tashkent); and (ii) coordinate the work of district \n(rayon) vodokanals, which provide day-to-day WSS services within their respective districts. \nFrom financial and operational viewpoints, oblast and rayon vodokanals are independent of one \nanother. Nevertheless, the head of the oblast vodokanal appoints the heads and chief engineers \nof the rayon vodokanals (in coordination with rayon administrations). Each oblast vodokanal is \nin charge of collecting and all reporting of data from its rayon vodokanals, provides advice on \ntariff review proposals, and assists in bulk purchase of equipment and consumables.  \n \n8.  At  the  central  government  level,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  is  responsible  for \nimplementing WSS-related fiscal policy in the country and setting WSS tariffs. The Ministry of \nEconomy is responsible for developing socioeconomic programs, based on the analysis of \nmacroeconomic indicators, in coordination with other sector ministries and agencies. The State \nCommittee on Demonopolization, Support of Competition and Entrepreneurship is responsible \nto the Cabinet of Ministers for developing a competitive environment and regulating monopolies. \nThe  Ministry  of  Health,  through  its  Sanitary  Epidemiological  Services,  is  responsible  for \nsurveillance  of  drinking  water  quality  (measured  against  national  standards)  in  the  WSS \nsystems. The Ministry of Health is responsible for analyzing the country\u2019s pubic health, including \nincidence of diseases related to quality of water services and disposal of wastewater. Finally, \nthe Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources is responsible for managing regional water \nresources, including raw water sources for the IRTMs and regional trunk mains.  \n \n ", "32  Appendix 3 \n \nC.  Legal and Regulatory Framework \n9.  Uzbekistan is still in the midst of crucial legal reforms, including for the WSS sector. \nSince independence, however, a significant legal basis has been developed for the sector. The \nmain  feature  of  the  water-related  legislation  is  that  the  Government  has  responsibility  for \ndrinking water supply and its quality. The main national laws related to WSS services are: \n(i)  Constitution of the Republic of Uzbekistan, 1992, where article 55 states that \nland,  mineral  resources,  water,  airspace,  flora  and  fauna,  and  other  natural \nresources are owned by the nation, should be used rationally, and are under \nprotection of the state.  \n(ii)  Law on Water and Water Use (1993, amended in 2007), which: (a) regulates \nwater  uses  by  the  population,  industry,  and  environment;  (b)  protects  water \nresources from pollution and depletion; and (c) prevents harmful impacts on \nwater, improves and protects water bodies, plus strengthens the legal base and \nprotection for the rights of legal and physical entities in relation to water. Articles \n41 and 42 of the Law on Water and Water Use focus on domestic centralized \nand decentralized water supply. They list the major responsibilities of the state \nfor providing water supply services as well as water quality surveillance. The law \ndoes not specify the ownership options for water supply and sewerage systems. \nHowever, in other legal documents, such as the Law on Concessions (1995), no \nrestrictions on water supply and sewerage infrastructure were imposed. This law \nwas further developed in Regulation 92 of the Government (Cabinet of Ministers) \nin 2002, which calls for privatizing major water and sewerage utilities. \n(iii)  Law on Natural Monopolies (1997, amended in 2007). The law specifies the role \nof  the  state  in  regulating  natural  monopolies.  Urban  WSS  enterprises  are \nclassified  as  natural  monopolies.  They  are  subject  to  regulation  and  tariff \napproval by the MOF, as the Government\u2019s regulatory body. Regulations under \nthis law specify the profit margin of water and wastewater companies to be a \nmaximum of 10%. There are relatively liberal rules for setting the staff salaries \nand bonuses. However, specific tariff revision procedures and the regulator\u2019s \nevaluation criteria are not yet in place. Compared to other utility services, water \nsupply and sewerage tariffs are still under political pressure and regarded as \nessential services that should be affordable also for low-income households.  \n \nD.  Recent Trends in Capital Expenditures \n10.  During the decade from independence to 2001, the Government invested an average of \nabout $26 million/annum in the WSS sector, mostly in water supply. From about 2001, however, \nwhen the Government recognized that the sector would require much larger investments than it \ncould dedicate, the Government engaged with international financial institutions and multilateral \ndonors to substantially increase the total investments in the WSS sector to more than $340 \nmillion through 2008. The Government has identified requirements totaling more than $3.2 \nbillion over the medium to longer term. For the next 5-year period, however, the Government \nhas  compiled  a  list  of  specific  projects  for  which  it  plans  to  seek  financing  from  various \ninternational  financial  institutions  totaling  more  than  $1.2  billion,  including  more  than  $680 \nmillion from the Asian Development Bank.  \n \n11.  The scale of rehabilitation for existing facilities plus new expansion to meet population \ngrowth over the next 10 years requires significant investment funding. Projected investment \nneeds for years 2010\u20132020 are presented in Table A3. \n \n ", "Appendix 3  33 \nTable A3: Estimated Total Investment Requirements, 2007\u20132020 \n($ million) \nTotal  \nProvince  2010\u20132015  2016\u20132020  2010\u20132020 \nKarakalpakstan  151.2  105.6  256.8 \nAndijan  132.6  129.6  262.2 \nBukhara   130.5  70.7  201.2 \nDjizzak  121.0  122.3  243.3 \nKashkadarya  174.0  85.9  259.9 \nNavoi  56.4  22.2  78.6 \nNamangan   102.2  111.4  213.6 \nSamarkand   152.7  102.4  255.1 \nSurkhandarya  245.6  112.0  357.6 \nSirdarya  147.5  54.6  202.1 \nTashkent   152.3  80.1  232.4 \nFerghana  98.8  39.5  138.3 \nKhorezm  55.2  32.9  88.1 \nTashkent city  80.3  31.6  111.9 \n  Total  1,800.3  1,100.8  2,901.1 \nSource: Uzbekistan Water Supply and Waste Water System Development and Modernization \nPlan for 2009\u20132020, Standing Committee of the Cabinet of Ministries, 25 June 2009. \n \nE.  Composition of Expenditures  \n12.  A Resolution of the President No. 890, in June 2008, lists investment projects prepared \nfor implementation with international financial institutions that target the following works:  \n(i)  Augmentation of raw water supply systems to enable the existing IRTMs to meet \nthe increased water demands of the vodokanals they supply. This will include \nrehabilitation  and  expansion  of  existing  well  fields,  construction  of  infiltration \ngalleries, or a combination of both, based on the approach most cost-effective for \neach IRTM. \n(ii)  Rehabilitation  and  expansion  of  existing  water  systems  with  focus  on  (a) \nimproving  services  toward  24  hours  per  day  for  at  least  90%  of  the  urban \npopulations,  and  with  sufficient  pressure  to  provide  fire  flows;  (b)  providing \nbooster pumps, water storage reservoirs, and chlorinators; (c) reducing leakage \nby  replacing  corroded  feeder  mains  and  larger  diameter  water  mains;  (d) \nreplacing service connections with new metered connections; (e) providing spare \nparts and consumables to ensure proper operation for 5 years after construction; \nand (f) building capacity and training at the vodokanals toward more efficient \noperations  and  a  consumer  focus,  including  aspects  of  leakage  detection, \nmanagement, budgeting and accounting, reporting, and audits. \n(iii)  Rehabilitation and expansion of existing sewerage systems to service up to 79% \nof  the  urban  populations,  including  (a)  replacing  corroded  and  damaged  or \ncollapsed sewage collector mains; (b) refurbishing pump stations; (c) expanding \nthe collection system with additional street sewers and related pump stations; (d) \nrehabilitating sewage treatment plants to meet Uzbekistan standards for effluent \ndischarge;  (e)  updating  laboratories  and  administration  buildings  to  ensure \nproper  support  for  the  new  systems\u2019  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M);  (f) \nproviding spare parts and consumables to enable normal operation for 5 years \nafter construction; and (g) building capacity and training at the vodokanals with \nfocus  on  preventive  maintenance,  management,  budgeting,  accounting,  and \nreporting. \n ", "34  Appendix 3 \n \n13.  In addition to the physical investments described above, there is a need for substantial \nsupport for institutional strengthening of UCSA, the provincial agencies, and the participating \nvodokanals.  Such  institutional  support  should  assist  the  Government  and  vodokanals  with \nimproving their WSS services. These include studies and evaluations for (i) benchmarking of the \nWSS sector, (ii) tariff options and increases, (iii) benefits of aggregating the smaller vodokanals \nto  help  them  take  advantage  of  scale  economies,  (iv)  introducing  performance-based \ncontracting and operation of the vodokanals such as lease or management contracts, and (v) \nassisting the IRTMs to develop contracts for various public\u2013private partnership (PPP) options. \n \nF.  Public and Private Sector Roles and Relationships \n14.  Decentralization of WSS services had an unintended effect of creating small, weak, and \nfragmented rayon vodokanals. Rayon vodokanals are too small to allow cost-efficient, self-\nsustaining entities and to attract professional staff. The multitranche financing facility proposes \nto  aggregate  some  rayon  vodokanals  to  take  advantage  of  improved  management  and \neconomies  of  scale.  In  order  to  meet  future  challenges  in  WSS  sector  development,  the \nGovernment  is  considering  to  introduce  market-based  principles  to  the  vodokanals.  Key \nelements of the recommendations are \n(i)  PPP contracts for bulk water supply,  \n(ii)  performance contracts for rayon vodokanals, \n(iii)  aggregation of rayon vodokanals, and \n(iv)  benchmarking. \n \n15.  However, private sector involvement in the Uzbek WSS sector has so far been minimal. \nThe first PPP experience in the WSS sector was an incentive-based management contract \nbetween a private operator (a consortium of foreign and local companies) and the Bukhara and \nSamarkand vodokanals, financed under the World Bank Bukhara and Samarkand Water Supply \nProject.3 The experience of this contract was not positive, as the contract failed and was \nterminated in 2006. Some lessons learned include the following: \n(i)  Performance improvements can only be achieved if the companies are financially \nviable, and thus able to meet day-to-day operation and maintenance costs and \nsalaries. \n(ii)  Close  collaboration  between  international  expertise  and  local  authorities  is \nessential for progress. \n(iii)  The private sector must be delegated powers to effectively manage the utility. \n(iv)  Performance measures must be measurable and targets realistic. \n \n16.  To overcome these shortcomings, a number of institutional reforms by the Government \nare  envisioned  regarding  levels  of  tariffs  and  delegated powers.  Revisions  to  the  contract \nstructure and more realistic performance targets will be necessary to ensure the successful \noperation of any future contracts. In 2008, Tashkent vodokanal introduced outsourcing (service \ncontracts)  for  emergency  repair  services.  Through  the  end  of  the  year,  the  results  were \nfavorable and the quality of each water line burst repair increased. Following examples in the \nelectricity sector, the next step for Tashkent vodokanal is to outsource collection services, with \nthe contractor responsible for meter reading, billing, and collection. In Tashkent Province, Obi \nHayot, a privatized entity, has taken overall responsibility for providing WSS services in rural \nareas.  \n                                                 \n3  World Bank. 2002. Bukhara and Samarkand Water Supply Project. Washington, DC. \n \n ", "Appendix 3  35 \nG.  Pricing Policy \n17.  In 1996, the Government approved new normative acts toward gradual transition to self-\nfinancing of the communal utilities sector (Resolution of the Government #271). The resolution \ndefines the procedure for calculating economic tariffs for communal services, including water \nsupply  and  sanitation.  According  to  this  resolution,  tariffs  should  be  based  on  cost  of \nconsumables  and  services,  plus  a  maximum  profit  margin  of  10%. There  is  no  automatic \nupgrade of the tariff due to consumer prices inflation and increased electricity tariffs. Instead, \ntariffs are currently reviewed every 6 months, but these are only increased at about 2%/annum. \nWith very few exceptions, revenues of vodokanals are low. Many are incurring losses because \nof (i) high nonrevenue water (physical and administrative), (ii) inefficient pumps leading to high \nelectricity cost, and (iii) the deteriorated state of the systems leading to numerous repairs. \nVodokanals report that current tariffs are below recovery for even operating and maintenance \ncosts, and that there are no funds for 24-hour operation, replacement, or expansion. According \nto the MOF, however, the present tariff policy is set to force utilities to improve their efficiency.  \n \n18.  The position of the regulator (Department for Financial and Price Regulation of the \nConsumer Market and Services under the MOF) is that (i) significant improvements in financial \nviability  of  vodokanals  are  possible  if  local  government  administrations  and  vodokanal \nmanagements  would  exercise  the  political  will  to  introduce  modern  financial  management \n(including to update and computerize consumer databases) and better tariff collection as a \nprecursor to rehabilitating physical infrastructure. In the regulator\u2019s opinion, the Government \nneeds assistance from donor agencies (e.g., bilateral aid agencies) in developing such financial \nmanagement programs for selected utilities as a foundation for international financial institutions \nto make further capital investments into projects. Support of local state administrations is crucial \nfor prompt tariff collection from residential and nonresidential consumers and for sanctions \nagainst illegal or nonpaying connections. The Tashkent city administration is a good example of \na successful vodokanal. It should be noted, however, that Tashkent, with its more than 1 million \nconnections, has an advantage of scale economy not enjoyed by small vodokanals having only \na few thousand connections. \n \nH.  Sustainability of Investments \n19.  To  improve  WSS  services,  the  Government  is  considering  ways  to  create  balance \nbetween  vodokanal  autonomy  and  municipal  regulation,  to  ensure  that  the  regulator  and \nregulated work together to obtain the best results for the beneficiaries. To date, this relationship \nhas not been successful due to a lack of enforcement. Vodokanals need to be held responsible \nfor managing and providing services as efficiently and prudently as possible. On the other hand, \nregulators must ensure that vodokanals have the freedom and incentives they need to manage \ntheir own affairs, and particularly to gradually establish tariffs at cost recovery levels.  \n \n20.  Institutional  strengthening  is  required  within  UCSA  to  implement  the  Government\u2019s \nambitious programs. Major intervention is needed to strengthen the IRTMs and vodokanals, to \nhelp them become autonomous, financially stable, and independent on a sustainable basis. The \nroad map envisages a number of initiatives for (i) evaluating the possibility and advantages of \naggregating  the  vodokanals  to  gain  economies  of  size,  (ii)  benchmarking  studies,  (iii) \nrationalizing  the  consumer  base  with  tax  rolls,  (iv)  rationalizing  staffing  requirements,  (v) \nincreasing tariffs to meet full O&M costs, (vi) assisting the IRTMs in developing various options \nfor  PPP,  (vii)  assisting  the  vodokanals  in  developing  options  for  performance-based  O&M \ncontracts, and (viii) capacity building and training staff at all related organizations. \n ", "36  Appendix 4 \n \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE SECTOR \n \n    External   \nName of Project  Executing Agency  Funding  Remarks \nBukhara and Samarkand  UCSA,  World Bank  $40.0 million World Bank loan \nWater Supply Project  Bukhara and \nSamarkand cities \n \nBukhara and Samarkand  UCSA,  SDC  $9.0 million grant for financial \nWater Supply Project (Swiss  Bukhara, and  auditing of operator performance \ncontribution to above project)  Samarkand cities  Samarkand and Bukhara \n \nWater Supply and Sanitation  MOE  World Bank  $75.0 million IDA-IBRD specific \nProject in Karakalpakhstan  investment loan \nand Khorezm Province \n \nUrban Water Supply Project   UCSA  ADB  $36.0 million loan approved in \n  2001 \nNow being implemented \nCovers Djizzak, Gulistan, and \nKarshi towns \n \nKashkadarya Navoi Rural  UCSA  ADB  $25.0 million loan approved in \nWater Supply and Sanitation  2005 \nProgram  Now being implemented \n \nWestern Uzbekistan Rural  MOE  ADB  Approved in 2002 \nWater Supply Project   $38.0 million loan \nNow being implemented \nCovers Karakalpakhstan and \nKorezm \n \nImprovement of water supply  MOE  Kuwait Fund for  $19.8 million for Nukus and \nin Nukus and Urgench cities  Economic  Urgench water supply systems \n  Development \n \nImprovement of water supply  Ministry of Foreign  German  \u20ac10.3 million loan \nin seven rural centers in  Economic Relations,  development  \u20ac2.0 million grant direct financing  \nKhorezm   Investments, and  cooperation   \nTrade\u2013Obi Hayot  through KfW \n \nWastewater pumping stations  MOE  SDC  $9 million for Nukus \nfor Nukus \n \nNational program for  UCSA  PRC  $17.3 million  \ninstallation of water meters  National \n \nImprovement of the water  Municipality of  EBRD  \u20ac10.60 million loan \nsupply system in Tashkent   Tashkent  Implementation period: 2004\u20132009 \n \nSurkhandarya water supply  UCSA  ADB  Approved in 2008 \nand sanitation project   $30 million loan \n  $1.5 million WFPF grant financing  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, EBRD = European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, IBRD = International Bank for \nReconstruction and Development, IDA = International Development Association, MOE = Ministry of Economy, PRC = People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, SDC = Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, UCSA = Uzbekistan Agency \"Uzkommunhizmat\", \nWFPF = Water Financing Partnership Facility. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n ", "Appendix 5  37 \nINSTITUTIONAL AND FINANCIAL IMPROVEMENT ACTION PLAN \n \nReform Measure  Indicative Target Dates \nA.

Selection Criteria \n1.  Selection of Towns \n1.  The Water Supply and Sanitation Services Investment Program will rehabilitate and \nimprove the water supply and sanitation (WSS) systems of the provincial capitals and district \ntowns in Uzbekistan. It will also support institutional strengthening and capacity development to \nimprove  the  financial,  managerial,  and  technical  performance  of  WSS  services.  To  select \nprogram towns, a program province should be first identified based on an overall assessment of \nWSS situations in that province relative to the national average. Within an identified program \nprovince, the selection of program towns will be based on an overall assessment of their WSS \nsituations and their importance in the economy. Factors to be considered include (i) town \npopulation, (ii) population growth, (iii) WSS coverage, (iv) water supply service duration, (v) \ncommercial and industrial growth, and (vi) urgency for a wastewater management system. For \nthe  sake  of  implementing  the  Investment  Program,  each  investment  tranche  will  cover  a \nmaximum of three program provinces, preferably nearby to one another. \n \n2.  Selection of Subprojects \n2.  In accordance with the Investment Program\u2019s scope, subprojects eligible for financing \nunder the facility will include (i) water supply development, (ii) wastewater management, and (iii) \nsanitation and hygiene improvement.

The executing agency for the Water Supply and Sanitation Services Investment Program \nwill  be  the  Uzbekistan  Agency  \"Uzkommunhizmat\"  (UCSA).  Each  participating  provincial \ngovernment  will  be  the  implementation  agency  for  the  Investment  Program  and  individual \nsubprojects in its own province. A program preparation and management unit (PPMU) has been \nestablished under UCSA and a program implementation unit (PIU) will be established in each \nparticipating  provincial  government.  The  overall  investment  program  implementation \narrangements  are  illustrated  in  Schedule  3  of  the  framework  financing  agreement  for  the \nInvestment Program. \n \n2.  The PPMU and PIU staff will need extensive support in preparing, appraising, and \nimplementing the Investment Program and its individual subprojects.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n  \n1.  The Government of Uzbekistan\u2019s Welfare Improvement Strategy/Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper 2008\u20132010a \nemphasizes that access to municipal services\u2014and especially access to potable water\u2014is an important factor for \nensuring decent living conditions. \n2.  The Water Supply and Sanitation Services Investment Program will contribute to the Government\u2019s priority reform \nareas, namely: \n(i)  a gradual transition of municipal services enterprises to self-support;  \n(ii)  improving rate-setting policies and transparency;  \n(iii)  developing targeted support to low-income population groups;  \n(iv)  improving municipal service systems for maintenance, repair, and funding;  \n(v)  ensuring sustainable funding in constructing interregional piped water supply systems;  \n(vi)  formulating regional programs for furthering economic reforms; and  \n(vii)  reinforcing the role of local self-government bodies (makhallas) in regulating municipal services and \nhousing relationships. \n3.  ADB\u2019s country strategy paperb is well aligned with the Government\u2019s Welfare Improvement Strategy/Poverty \nReduction Strategy Paper and aims to promote pro-poor growth along four key strategic priorities. Of these four, the \nprogram will contribute directly to the following two priorities: \n(i)  Accelerate environmentally sustainable rural development. Through the delivery of improved water \nsupply  and access by more households in small towns and urban centers of Bukhara, Navoi, and \nSamarkand oblasts, the Investment Program will enable families to participate more fully in economic \nactivities while reducing health care costs caused by waterborne illnesses. The sanitation and hygiene \npromotion program that will be implemented in schools and the wider community will help maximize the \nhealth improvements from safe water supply.  \n(ii)  Build the human capital of the poor. The Investment Program will contribute significantly to this through \nthe provision of improved water supply and sanitation services, as well as the implementation of sanitation \nand hygiene promotion programs to vulnerable groups. This will improve the health and well-being of \nchildren and the poor, enabling them to be more productive members of society. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                     Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention \n  1.  Key Issues \n1.  According to a 2003 World Bank study based on Household Budget Survey data, approximately 25% of the \ncountry\u2019s population was living below the poverty line.c  \n2.  Socioeconomic  surveys  that  were  conducted  in  Galaasiya  (Bukhara),  Karmana  (Navoi),  and  Termez  city \n(Surkhandarya) in June 2009 investigate current household poverty rates in the water supply and sanitation subproject \nareas.  \n3.  The poverty analysis in this section is largely based on data previously collected during 2007/08 in a social survey \nfor Surkhandarya Water Supply and Sanitation Project under project preparatory technical assistance. \n4.  The Welfare Improvement Strategy has indicated that poverty in Uzbekistan\u2019s small towns is actually higher than in \nrural areas, as access to land is limited and there are notably fewer opportunities in small towns than in larger cities for \nemployment in the state-funded sector and in private business and industry.  \n5.  Both poor and nonpoor families in small towns and cities have limited access to public utilities such as gas, \nelectricity, and potable water. Very few households have bathrooms with piped water.  \n6.  Recent studies have shown that water consumption in poor families is 21% lower than in nonpoor families and that \nthe quality of water that poor families consume is unsatisfactory. Low-income households cannot afford to buy potable \nwater, and over 20% use unsafe water. \n7.  Previous studies have indicated that the poverty line in monetary terms is $37 in Termez city and the average \nmonthly income of families is $207. Average per capita income of poor families was found to be about half of the \nnonpoor. \n8.  Income from employment in the nonagricultural sector is significant for poor families residing in small semi-urban \nsettlements. The second-most important source of income is from social transfers, and, in rural areas, from the direct \nselling of home-produced agricultural products. Pensions and social transfers may represent approximately 24% of total \nincome for poor families. More than 50% of poor households report being unemployed. \n9.  Poor families spend from 48% to 53% of total family income on foodstuffs, and for most poor families the diet is \nmade up of carbohydrates (flour, potatoes) and fats (vegetable oil).  \n10.  Education levels of poor families are close to the national average, with 91% having completed primary school \neducation. Only 23% of heads of households in poor families have completed secondary education, and this is much \n ", "62  Appendix 13 \nlower than in nonpoor families. \n11.  Because of low incomes and limited employment opportunities, labor migration is growing in the country and \napproximately 5% of families receive remittances. The restructuring of collective farms into private farms is a process that \nis shedding large numbers of agricultural workers. Less than 3% of the total population has become private farmers, and \nthe trend is for farms to employ only family members as farm workers.  \n12.  The  opportunities  for  self-employment  in  the  country  are  still  limited  because  of  underdeveloped  market \ninstitutions, legislative limitations, and lack of information about ways and opportunities of increasing income in new \nmarket-oriented conditions. Families with few employment opportunities are limited to operating small enterprises or \nworking as unregistered small-scale traders.  \n  2.  Design Features \n13.  To specifically address the needs of the poor, the Investment Program has adopted the following pro-poor \nstrategies: \n(i)  The 25% of the target population that is considered poor will be able through the program interventions \nto access affordable, clean drinking water. That will contribute to health and hygiene improvements and \nincrease those people\u2019s abilities to fully participate in society.  \n(ii)  House connections and meters will be installed and an affordability and willingness to pay survey will \nbe conducted to determine their affordability for poor households. \n(iii)  A local social and gender specialist will be appointed to ensure that poor and vulnerable groups are \nable to access program benefits. \n(iv)  To ensure equitable access to safe and reliable water supply for poor communities, monitoring systems \nwill  be  developed  at  community  and  project  implementation  unit  levels  to  examine  changes  in \nworkload, affordability, and system reliability. \n(v)  Poor and vulnerable households will receive compensation for crop damage during construction work \nrelated to subprojects to ensure that they are not further disadvantaged. All necessary actions will be \ntaken to minimize involuntary resettlement impacts wherever possible. \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \n \n1.  Social surveys and focus groups were conducted in Galaasiya town (Bukhara oblast), Karmana town (Navoi \noblast), and Termez City during June\u2013July 2009. The population of Termez city is approximately 127,000, that of \nKarmana is 23,000, and Galaasiya has approximately 14,000 residents. Average family size is from 5 to 6 persons in \nTermez city and is larger for poor households than nonpoor households. \n2.  Ninety-eight percent of families live in their own houses. Land for a family house is allocated and guaranteed by \nthe state.  \n3.  Water is supplied for only 4\u20136 hours per day in Karmana and Galaasiya during summer, and there are frequent \ninterruptions to the service. Most of the households in the target areas of Galaasiya and Karmana suffer water shortages \nirrespective of their living standards. Current average daily water consumption for drinking and household purposes is 80 \nliters per family per day, which is lower than the recommended 110 liters per day. Recent studies in Termez city have \nshown that more than 13% of house water connections have never worked properly, and the remainder have been \ninoperable for more than 50% of the time. Approximately 55% of households that currently have an operating water \npipeline in their houses frequently take water from street standpipes for drinking and household purposes, purchase \nwater from water vendors, or take water from nearby canals.   \n4.  Recent studies have shown that the incidence of diarrhea in households with piped water is 5-7 times lower than \nthat  of  families  that  drink  water  from  reservoirs.  Average  annual  expenditure  for  treating  diarrhea  amounted  to \napproximately 8.7% of monthly family income in rural rayons and about 6.9% in Termez city. Approximately 30% of male \nand female children under 14 years of age bathe less than once a week in both urban and rural areas.   \n5.  An average family spends 3\u20136 person-days per month collecting water for domestic consumption. The average \ndistance to the main source of water is less than 100 m in Termez city and is more than 600 m in rural rayons.  \n6.  Approximately 90%\u201395% of families living in single storey houses currently store water for drinking and household \nneeds. Families construct their own water storage reservoirs at a cost of approximately $150. \n7.  Approximately half of households, and particularly in rural rayons, do not have bathrooms or showers, and only \n24% of households in Termez city have water connections in existing bathrooms. The residents of Termez and other \nsmall towns who have inside toilets in their apartments are unable to use them because of the lack of water. \n8.  Kindergartens, schools, colleges, in-patient medical institutions, and hospitals also currently operate with limited \nwater and sanitation. They experience water shortages and inadequate sanitation facilities. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \n1.  Summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. Consultations with \nkey stakeholders at both central and local government levels were held. These included focus groups with beneficiaries \nand in-depth interviews with community leaders, school directors, hospital directors, and local enterprise managers. \nHousehold surveys will be implemented covering 2,400 families as follows: 1,400 households in Karmana and Galaasiya \ndealing with water supply issues, and 1,000 households in Termez city dealing with sanitation issues. A scoping exercise \nwas carried out in Karmana and Galaasiya, and a census has been carried out on affected households related to the \nproposed Galaasiya water supply subproject. A particular focus of the social surveys will be on data concerning \n ", "Appendix 13  63 \nvulnerable population groups, especially the poor and households headed by women. In addition to surveying families, \ninterviews will be conducted with the chairpersons of urban makhallas, who are key players in disseminating information \nto the community about the subprojects. \n2.  Press releases and the involvement of the local media will be undertaken to supplement the dissemination of \ninformation. \n3.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring? \n    Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative Decision-Making          Empowerment \n4.  Was a C&P plan prepared?    Yes          No \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n5.  A C&P program has been prepared to ensure that the benefits gained through the Investment Program are \nsustained after program completion. The objective will be to involve all stakeholders, including such underrepresented \nstakeholders  as  women  and  vulnerable  groups,  in  the  planning,  implementation,  operation,  and  maintenance  of \nrehabilitated and newly created assets. One of the outputs will be the establishment of local monitoring groups to monitor \nprogress and facilitate the resolution of issues arising during the planning and implementation of subprojects, as well as \nafter their completion. With a more inclusive consultation and participation process that includes consumers and water \nusers, it is expected that the performance of vodokanals in collecting water payments from domestic consumers will \nimprove. The consultative process will therefore involve clients such as households; institutions such as schools, clinics, \nand businesses; the service providers, i.e., vodokanals; as well as other stakeholders from government organizations and \nthe private sector. The program will be implemented and managed by a local or nongovernment organization with \nexperience in implementing community-level programs dealing with water, environment, and sanitation. That organization \nwill be experienced in designing and implementing capacity building and awareness training, especially among women, \nyouth, and vulnerable groups. The cost estimate for the 8-year plan totals $50,000. \nC.  Gender and Development \n \n  1.  Key Issues \n1.  Data from recent country studiesd indicate that approximately 43% of the adult female population in Uzbekistan is \nemployed either in full-time or part-time work. Women\u2019s wages are approximately 80% those of men, and their role in the \nwork force is becoming increasingly concentrated in low-skilled jobs and small-scale trading in the informal sector and in \nmanual work in the agriculture sector. Despite their comparative disadvantages in the labour market, it is estimated that \nwomen contribute approximately 35% of average household income in the project areas. \n2.  Many households that are located at considerable distances from the main city water pipelines have no access to \npiped water because of the low water pressure and concentrated domestic demand during the rush hours and limited \nwater schedules. Those households that do not have piped drinking water use standpipes located on the street where \nwater is provided daily according to set schedules but with frequent service interruptions. \n3.  Women are responsible for family hygiene and take care of family members in the event of sickness. The chronic \nshortages and inadequate supply of water to households also mean that people cannot afford to clean their houses as \noften as necessary. This contributes to the incidence of illnesses related to unsanitary conditions. Data from recent \nsurveys also suggest that women and girls bathe less compared with men and boys, who, unlike females, are able to \nbathe publicly in rivers and canals. \n4.  Providing households with adequate and quality potable water will have a positive impact on women. It will reduce \nthe labor inputs of women and alleviate time pressures, thus allowing for more productive economic employment. \nMoreover, it will have a positive impact on the health of all family members, and especially children. That will further \nalleviate time pressures on women, who care for sick and handicapped household members. \n  2.  Key Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014\naccess  to  and  use  of  relevant  services,  resources,  assets,  or  opportunities  and  participation  in  decision-making \nprocesses: \n      Gender plan        Other actions/measures        No action/measure \n5.  To enhance the impact of the program on women and to mitigate any program-related risks for women and \nchildren, a gender action plan has been developed. The key components are as follow: \n(i)  A local social and gender specialist will be hired to ensure that gender issues are prioritized during \nimplementation. \n(ii)  Women at all levels will participate in the planning process and in awareness-raising campaigns. \n(iii)  Key stakeholders, including vodokanal staff, will undergo gender sensitivity training so that they are aware \nof women\u2019s needs, preferences, and roles in household water management, sanitation, and hygiene. \nIncreased involvement of women in management and planning will be encouraged, and a more sensitive \nand responsive approach in relations with female clients will be developed. \n(iv)  Women will be proactively included in the Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion Program\u2019s activities, as well as \nin the local monitoring groups, and they will be equal partners in solving water supply-related issues. \n(v)  Guidelines and policy on staffing for the project management unit, project implementation units, and water \nsupply companies will be produced to ensure that equal consideration is given to women. \n(vi)  The Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion Program will target primary schools (because a significant number \nof girls do not progress to secondary schools) to ensure that girls will be aware of good practices in water \nhandling, hygiene, and sanitation as adults. \n(vii)  Women will be trained in basic technical skills to ensure that they are not reliant on males to address basic \nwater supply and sanitation problems. \n ", "64  Appendix 13 \nIII.

Introduction \n1.  The Water Supply and Sanitation Services Investment Program will improve health, \nliving, and environmental conditions for the people residing in four provinces of Uzbekistan. The \nprogram will primarily include the rehabilitation and expansion of water supply and sanitation \nsystems.  Initial  program  activities  for  the  first  tranche  will  be  in  Bukhara,  Navoi,  and \nSurkhandarya  provinces.  They  are  the  Damkhoja  Water  Supply  Distribution,  Karmana \nDistribution  System,  Galaasiya  Distribution  System,  and  Termez  Wastewater  Treatment \nsubprojects. Of these subprojects, only two entail new construction and just one (Galaasiya) \nentails land acquisition and resettlement (LAR). In Galaasiya, new construction will cause only \nminimal impact in the form of tree losses and residential structures that infringe on government \nland.  \n \nB.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Framework (LARF) \n2.  In the event of resettlement issues for future subprojects, a resettlement framework has \nbeen prepared to guide the project management unit during detailed design and subproject \nimplementation. The resettlement framework contains arrangements for preparing full or short \nresettlement plans in preparing the subprojects, depending on the significance of the involuntary \nresettlement impacts. The resettlement framework includes (i) project description, with the likely \nscope,  extent,  and  magnitude  of  the  resettlement  effects;  (ii)  screening  procedures;  (iii) \nresettlement policy principles and eligibility criteria that are consistent with the resettlement \npolicy and cover all investments, subprojects, and components under the loan; (iv) resettlement \nentitlements; (v) resettlement design criteria; and (vi) administrative, resourcing, and financing \narrangements for preparation, approval, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of full or \nshort resettlement plans. It includes provisions for strengthening the capacity of the relevant \nexecuting agency and of other agencies to address resettlement issues.  \n \n3.  The LARF is based on the following principles: (i) land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) \nwill be avoided if possible, or minimized if it cannot be avoided; (ii) compensation will ensure the \nmaintenance of the affected persons\u2019 pre-project living standards; (iii) affected persons will be \nfully informed and consulted on compensation options; (iv) affected persons\u2019 socio-cultural \ninstitutions will be supported and used; (v) LAR provisions will apply equally to women and men; \n(vi) lack of formal title will not be a bar to compensation and rehabilitation; (vii) particular \nattention will be paid to households headed by women and to vulnerable groups; (viii) LAR will \nbe conceived and executed as an integral part of the project, and LAR budgets will be included \nin project costs; and (ix) compensation at replacement costs will be fully provided prior to \nground leveling and demolition. The LARF also covers all issues relevant to LAR and contains \nthe definition of eligibility and entitlement provisions. \n \n4.  Institutional  responsibilities.  Over  time,  Uzbekistan  Agency  \"Uzkommunhizmat\" \n(UCSA) has improved its capacity and experience for managing LAR-related issues. However, \nunfamiliarity with Asian Development Bank (ADB) safeguard procedures, limited resources, and \nlack of expertise in preparing LAR-related documents has caused significant delays for the civil \nwork to start in some projects. To overcome this weakness, a social and environmental subunit \n(SESU) will be established under the program preparation and management unit (PPMU). The \nSESU will be responsible for general project execution related to safeguard requirements in all \nsubproject areas, and the project implementation units (PIUs) will be responsible for project-\nlevel activities. The SESU will be aided by a social safeguard-and-resettlement team hired by \nthe  PPMU  as  project  consultants.  If  required,  a  nongovernment  organization  or  impact \n ", "Appendix 15  69 \nassessment or valuation teams will be hired for on-site impact surveys or monitoring assistance. \nThe PPMU and PIUs will coordinate with local governments and the Land Cadastral Agency, \nwhich have jurisdiction over land administration and valuation. To ensure effective coordination \nbetween UCSA, local governments, and other agencies, UCSA will establish an LAR committee \nat the rayon as well as central levels. A rayon LAR committee that includes the local self-\ngoverning  body  (makhalla)  leaders  as  representatives  of  the  affected  persons  will  be \nestablished by UCSA in each subproject district.  \n \n5.  Disclosure and public consultation. LAR preparation entails thorough consultation. All \naffected  families  were  informed  and  consulted  on  the  resettlement  plan  provisions,  both \nindividually and in community meetings. As an appraisal condition, the resettlement plans will be \nposted on the ADB website and disclosed in the local language to the affected families and \ncommunities. An information booklet will be sent to all affected families to ensure that they \nunderstand their rights and the compensation due them. \n \n6.  Grievance procedure. A grievance procedure has been established as follows: \n(i)  Grievances will be handled first at the district level by the grievance committee, \ncomprised of makhalla leaders, local government members supported by the PIU, \nSESU, and a project consultant. \n(ii)  If no solution is reached, the affected families will then lodge a complaint with the \nprovincial administration with support from the rayon LAR committee, and that \ncommittee  will  bring  the  case  to  Central  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement \nCommission, if necessary. \n(iii)  Finally, if no settlement is reached, the affected families will still be able to seek \nredress in the appropriate court. \n \n7.  Monitoring and evaluation. The PPMU through SESU will monitor LAR implementation \ninternally and report to the executing agency, which will report quarterly to ADB. Since the \nresettlement plan significantly affects less than 200 people, no external monitoring will be \ncarried out. \n \n8.  Finances  and  schedules.  The  resettlement  plans  will  detail  the  LAR  budget  and \nimplementation schedules, linking LAR tasks with the start of civil works. \n \nC.  Due Diligence \n9.  In  the  remaining  three  subprojects,  Damkhoja  Water  Supply  Distribution,  Karmana \nDistribution System, and Termez Wastewater Treatment, no resettlement or structure or land \nimpact will occur, as construction will only be carried out within the existing sites. Due diligence \nreports were prepared for all three subprojects to document the absence of LAR impact.  \n \n10.  Upon project implementation, the PPMU resettlement expert will (i) review and update, \nwhen required, the resettlement plan for Galaasiya based on the detailed design; (ii) implement \nthe approved land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP); (iii) prepare a confirmation letter of \nLARP implementation and/or a report documenting any modifications in any subproject and \nsubmit it to ADB; and (iv) receive a no-objection confirmation from ADB for each subproject \nbefore any construction takes place in that subproject. \n \nD.  Specific Land Acquisition and Resettlement Plan (LARP) \n \n11.  The program prepared a short resettlement plan for the Galaasiya subproject. It includes \na detailed impact assessment and a census of affected persons showing that the subproject will \n ", "70  Appendix 15 \ncause a minimal project LAR impact in the form of land occupation by 11 households whose \nresidential structures infringe on government land, plus 1 household with some tree and crop \nlosses. That comes to a total of 12 affected households and 68 affected persons. The total \naffected land area is 4,200 square meters. The project will provide the affected families with \ncompensation  at  replacement  costs  for  the  affected  structures  and  crops  plus  additional \nallowances for the loss of income during the construction period. An additional allowance is \nprovided also for 4 vulnerable households identified during the census. The total compensation \ncost for the affected structures, crops, and trees is SUM157,261,000, while the total LAR \nbudgets are estimated to be SUM182,564,300. The short resettlement plan provides general \nLAR-related project preparation and implementation conditions; a policy framework detailing all \ncompensation and rehabilitation provisions; and several sections related to public consultation \nand  disclosure,  the  organization  of  LAR  tasks,  complaints  and  grievances,  and  the  LAR \nimplementation schedule, budgets, and monitoring.   \n \n12.  Project  implementation  conditions  related  to  the  resettlement  plan.  This \nresettlement plan is based on surveys carried out in June 2009 under the project preparatory \ntechnical assistance. Although the data in this resettlement plan are adequate, final design \nalignments may require some impact review and confirmation work. To ensure that impact data \nare updated as needed and guarantee that the affected families are fully compensated and \nrehabilitated before any impact occurs, two project implementation conditions related to the \nresettlement plan have been established: (i) civil works contracts will be approved only after the \nresettlement plan has been reviewed and confirmed or amended on the basis of the final \ndetailed design, and (ii) ADB will approve the mobilization of contractors only after the full \nimplementation of the compensation and rehabilitation program detailed in the resettlement plan. \n \nE.  Ethnic Minority Issues \n13.  Since the Investment Program will focus on urban area subprojects, it will not adversely \naffect  indigenous  peoples  or  ethnic  minorities.  The  main  ethnic  groups  in the country  are \nUzbeks (79.2%), Russian (4.1%), Tajiks (4.9%), Kazakhs (3.8%), and Karakalpaks (2.2%). The \nprogram areas are fairly homogeneous in terms of their ethnic composition. Approximately 80% \nof the population is Uzbek. Ethnic Karakalpaks, Kazakhs, and Tajiks are present in the identified \nsubproject areas of Bukhara, Navoi, and Surkhandarya districts. None of these ethnic groups \ndiffer in their water supply and sanitation needs, and all will benefit directly from piped water \nsupply, sanitation improvements, and better hygiene. \n \n14.  An  ethnic  minority  development  framework  has  been  prepared  for  any  possible \nindigenous people/ethnic minority impacts for future subprojects in subsequent tranches. It is \nbased on Uzbekistan\u2019s overall national development strategies and ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous \nPeoples (1998). The principal objectives are to ensure that ethnic minority populations affected \nby any subprojects benefit from the investment project; that ethnic minorities are included in the \nentire  process  of  preparing,  implementing,  and  monitoring  project  activities;  and  that  the \nbenefits of the projects are available to ethnic minorities to a greater or equal extent as to the \nrest of the affected groups. This may require giving preference to people of ethnic minorities as \nvulnerable groups over others as to certain benefits under the project. It thereby provides a \nbasis for the ethnic minority to receive adequate development attention. \n \n15.  The subprojects contained within tranche 1 will affect no ethnic minority groups, and no \ncommunities of indigenous peoples or ethnic minorities have been identified in the subproject \nareas. \n ", "Appendix 16  71 \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Introduction and Methodology \n1.  The economic analysis covers the four sample subprojects included in Tranche 1 of the \nInvestment Program. It was undertaken in accordance with Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nguidelines, including the guidelines and handbook for the economic analysis of projects and, in \nparticular, those for the water supply sector.1 For the overall Investment Program, the analysis \ndescribes the economic rationale and rationale for public intervention. The analysis assumes \nthat in the \u201cfuture without project\u201d scenario the existing systems will continue to deteriorate and \nthe level of services will further decline from 2009 levels. The economic analysis also evaluates \nthe cost-effectiveness of individual sample subprojects, particularly for wastewater, focusing on \nleast-cost analysis where applicable. The subproject analysis compares the economic internal \nrate  of  return  (EIRR)  with  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital,  assumed  at  12%  for \ninfrastructure project studies in Uzbekistan. Sensitivity and risk analyses are undertaken to \nassess the robustness of the subprojects under adverse economic conditions. The analysis \nuses shadow pricing and standard conversion factors to convert the financial cost and benefits \ninto economic terms. The analysis is undertaken in constant May 2009 prices. Details of the \neconomic analysis are presented in Supplementary Appendix N. \n \nB.  Economic Rationale \n2.  The collapse of the former Soviet Union in 1991 brought a reduction in funding and \nsubsidies to the water supply and sanitation (WSS) sector in Uzbekistan. The country inherited \na  comprehensive  WSS  systems  infrastructure  capable  of  servicing  the  majority  of  the \npopulation, but  these  systems  are  now  reaching  the  end  of  their  useful  lives  and  require \nrehabilitation and modernization. The capital investment required to rehabilitate or upgrade the \nsystems cannot be met solely by the national and local budgets, however, and as a result the \nwater supply infrastructure in the country is faced with further deterioration.2  \n \n3.  To arrest the continued decline of water supply services, the Government has begun a \nnumber of key reforms, including (i) improvements in water sector services through a national \nwater supply development plan; (ii) financial sustainability goals through cost recovery; (iii) \nadequate investment planning with domestic and external funding; (iv) further decentralization of \nWSS services; (v) introduction of private sector participation and public\u2013private partnerships in \nthe sector; (vi) promotion of water resources conservation, economic use of water, consistent \nwater  quality  control,  and  sound  management  of  wastewater;  and  (vii)  improvements  in \noperational strategies through a stronger institutional setup and interagency collaboration in the \nsector, as well as capacity building. \n \n4.  Government  intervention  derives  its  rationale  from  the  increasing  concern  over  the \nworsening water supply situation in the country, where declining coverage and service duration \nare being made worse by the sector\u2019s slow pace of development. Water supply systems are \nowned and managed by the water supply and sanitation agencies (vodokanals). Studies show \nhowever, that where such centralized systems exist, services continue to worsen because the \nvodokanals,  lacking  funds  and  capacity,  can  do  very  little  to  improve  and  rehabilitate  the \nsystems with their own resources. Low-quality services plus significant water losses in the \nsystems result in limited revenue generation. In many cases, revenues cannot even cover the \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila; ADB. 1999. Handbook for the Economic \nAnalysis of Water Supply Projects. Manila. \n2  The World Bank estimates that $1.4 billion is needed to replace or rehabilitate existing infrastructure. \n ", "72  Appendix 16 \nrequired operation and maintenance costs. Private sector involvement in the water supply \nsector is still not developed. Consequently, large-scale system repair or extension of coverage \ncan only be financed with government support. Despite government efforts to rehabilitate WSS \nsystems in the selected districts, access to water supply is inadequate even in district centers.3 \nThe worsening supply shortage causes households to resort to other, contaminated and more \nexpensive, sources of water and has negatively impacted on the health of the population, with \nthe poor being most affected. Without urgent major investments in supply and distribution \nnetworks, water supply systems will continue to deteriorate rapidly, with serious economic and \nenvironmental consequences. \n \n5.  The  Government\u2019s  involvement  in  the  sector  is  justified  because  of  the  significant \npositive externalities associated with improved water supply and sanitation services and their \nnatural monopoly conditions. Moreover, there is significant scope to improve water supply and \nsanitation  services  in  Uzbekistan  through  providing  financial  and  technical  support  and \ninstitutional strengthening. At present, this can be provided effectively only by the Government. \nThe scope of the Investment Program is based on the priorities identified for the sector and the \nsector investment plan in the sector road map, developed in consultations with stakeholders. \nThe Investment Program focuses largely on rehabilitating the existing deteriorated infrastructure \nwith due consideration for optimizing the system design and applying least-cost solutions. \n \nC.  Demand Analysis \n6.  Water demand in the subproject areas has been constrained by deterioration of the \npiped water systems and their limited capacity to supply consumers. Supply constraint from the \ninterregional trunk mains is also a factor. Actual consumption is difficult to ascertain from the \nvodokanals\u2019 records, since not all consumers are metered and system losses are considerable. \nOnly limited coverage is provided, and the low water supply from the vodokanals is augmented \nby other supply sources that include water vendors, reservoirs, wells, canals, and rivers. In \nsome cases, the Government provides a limited supply of drinking water from tankers.  \n \n7.  The population in the service areas is projected to grow by around 0.8%\u20130.9% per year \nin line with the general increase in population. Projected average water demand per capita is \nprojected to grow gradually from current levels to 150 liters per capita per day (lpcd) by 2020, \nwith adjustments for institutional, commercial, and industrial use for each subproject. This figure \nis based on the standard adopted by the Government and is in line with experience of other \ncities with improved water supply. 4  Service coverage is also projected to increase in line with \nthe Government\u2019s objective to provide better access under its Millennium Development Goals. \nGiven this per capita demand, the designed capacity is projected to meet water demand up to \n2025.  While  the  introduction  of  comprehensive  metering  of  consumption  combined  with \nincreasing  tariffs  is  expected  to  result  in  a  lower  overall  consumption  rate,  the  effects  of \nincreased income are likely to offset those impacts. \n \nD.  Least-Cost Analysis \n8.  Technical  alternatives  for  the  subprojects  were  analyzed  for  the  most  economically \n                                                 \n3  Service coverage levels remain relatively low even after programmed intervention in the past 10 years via the \nnational water supply development plan. Where it exists, piped water is generally available from 6 to 16 hours per \nday in urban areas and from 2 to 10 hours in rural areas. Where the services are not available, the population \nobtains water from private vendors, wells, and irrigation canals. The latter sources are often distant, saline, and \ncontaminated. \n4  After  the  improvement  of  water  supply  in  Bukhara  and  Samarkand  cities  under  World  Bank\u2019s  project  the \nconsumption rate for the population not connected to the sewerage in these cities reached 160-180 lpcd. \n ", "Appendix 16  73 \nfeasible solution. The choice of options was based on (i) technical and physical feasibility; (ii) \nunit supply costs, given the incremental investment and operation and maintenance costs; and \n(iii) sustainability of the available water resource. The least-cost solutions were found most \nuseful in evaluating wastewater treatment options for the design of the Termez wastewater and \nsewerage improvement subproject. Least-cost analysis was applied to three alternatives: a new \nlagoon treatment scheme, construction of a new wastewater treatment plant, and rehabilitation \nof the existing plant. The results showed rehabilitation of the existing wastewater treatment plant \nto be the most viable alternative. \n \nE.  Economic Costs \n9.  Costs were prepared based on constant prices applicable in May 2009. Economic costs \nexclude taxes and duties. Financial prices were converted to economic prices using standard \nconversion factors calculated from the cost breakdown. The shadow exchange rate factor was \nassumed to be 1.0. The shadow wage rate factor for unskilled labor was assumed to be 0.8. \n \nF.  Socioeconomic Surveys \n10.  Socioeconomic  surveys  cover  14%  of  total  households  in  Karmana  and  25.5%  in \nGalaasiya. The household surveys are based on random probability samples, which ensure \nrepresentation equal to 0.95. The limit of sampling error is determined by the target level of \nsignificance and does not exceed 5%. In the Karmana and Galaasiya surveys, interviewing of \nhouseholds  was  face-to-face  while  using  a  questionnaire.  Focus  group  discussions  were \nconducted in Termez. \n \n11.  To  identify  willingness  to  pay  (WTP),  closed-ended  questions  were  used  to  elicit \nhousehold  preferences.  Tap  water  supply  24  hours  a  day  was  offered  as  the  service \nimprovement. Households\u2019 responses conform to economic theory as to there being a positive \neffect of income on WTP. The survey showed an expressed average WTP of SUM936 per \nperson per month for water supply in Karmana and SUM1,068 in Galaasiya. WTP figures are \nalso  consistent  with  findings  from  the  Surkhandarya  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Project, \nconsidering local inflation and the fact that Bukhara and Navoi provinces are considered as \nmore economically developed than Surkhandarya Province.5 \n \n12.  The surveys also indicate that existing water demands in Karmana and Galaasiya have \nbeen constrained by the limited capacity and condition of the piped water systems. Current \nwater  consumption  in  Karmana  and  Galaasiya  is  66  lpcd  and  72  lpcd,  respectively,  and \n80%\u221287% of the populations use water from pipelines in the house or yard and streets. Those \nremaining obtain water from water vendors, wells, and other sources.  \n \nG.  Economic Benefits \n13.  The  major  economic  benefits  of  improved  water  supply  services  are  that  (i) \nnonincremental water consumption is valued at the average economic supply price of water \nfrom  non-piped  sources,  and  (ii)  incremental  water  consumption  is  valued  at  the  price \nconsumers are willing to pay for the improved water supply services. The considerable external \nbenefits,  including  health  benefits  from  medical  costs  avoided  and  fire  protection,  are \nrecognized but were excluded from the analysis as they are deemed too difficult to quantify. \n \n                                                 \n5  Social-economic survey for Surkhandarya Water Supply and Sanitation Project showed WTP of SUM792 per \nperson per month for Termez City (2008) and SUM508 for other subprojects in Surkhandarya Province (2007). \n ", "74  Appendix 16 \nH.  Results of Economic Analysis \n14.  The EIRR was used to measure the economic viability of each subproject. A subproject \nwith an EIRR greater than its economic opportunity cost of capital (12%) can be considered \neconomically viable. The EIRR was further tested for sensitivity to changes in the four most \nimportant parameters in the analysis: (i) a 20% increase in capital cost, (ii) a 20% increase in \noperating  costs,  (iii)  a  20%  decrease  in  revenue,  and  (iv)  a  1-year  delay  in  subproject \nimplementation. \n \n15.  For the three water supply subprojects, EIRRs were calculated to be between 17% and \n17.5%. The results of the sensitivity tests showed that the subprojects were also robust and \neconomically  viable.  The  calculated  EIRR  is  expected  to  be  lower  than  the  true  EIRR \nconsidering the social, health, and environmental implications in the \u201cfuture without project\u201d \nsituation if the subprojects are not implemented. \n \n ", "Appendix 17  75 \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \nA.  Introduction \n1.  Financial analyses were undertaken for the sample subprojects of tranche 1 investment. \nThe  analyses  consist  of  two  parts:  (i)  determination  of  appropriate  water  tariffs  for  each \nsubproject, and (ii) preparation and assessment of financial projections for the subproject water \nsupply  and  sanitation  agencies  (vodokanals).  The  projections  consist  of  annual  financial \nstatements (income statement, sources and applications of funds statement, balance sheet), key \nperformance indicators, and operating and financial data for the 2009\u20132020 period. Details of the \nfinancial analysis are in Supplementary Appendix O. \n \nB.  Bases for Financial Projections \n2.  Price. The financial projections for each subproject are presented on a current price \nbasis. Revenues and costs were converted from constant 2009 prices to current prices using \nthe following projected local annual inflation rates: 10.6% in 2009, 9.5% in 2010, 8.5% in 2011, \n8% during 2012\u20132013, 7% in 2014, and 5% from 2015 onward.1 \n \n3.  Financial objectives. The proposed tariff rates for each subproject were designed to \n(i) fully recover operation and maintenance (O&M) costs, (ii) recover all subproject debt service, \nand (iii) generate a financial internal rate of return (FIRR) greater than the weighted average \ncost  of  capital  (WACC),  wherever  feasible.  In  addition,  each  subproject  was  projected  to \nmaintain its accounts receivable at less than 60 days\u2019 equivalent of annual sales by 2016. \n \n4.  Operating revenues. Operating revenues include water sales and repayment of water \nmeters. Payment for a water meter was assumed to be made in 36 equal monthly installments \nand billed to consumers accordingly. Future water sales were calculated on the basis of water \ndemand and projected water tariff levels.  \n \n5.  Operating expenses. Annual O&M costs were projected separately for each subproject \nover  the  entire  forecast  period  by  major  expense  item  (salaries,  electricity,  chemicals, \nmaintenance, social charges, and selling and administration expenses). Depreciation allowance \nwas calculated on an average asset life of 20 years using the straight-line method. Average \nincome tax was assumed to be 10%. \n \n6.  Subproject cost and financing plan. Subproject capital costs will be funded through an \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) loan and from government funds. The ADB loan will have a \nterm of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1.0% yearly \nduring the grace period and 1.5% yearly thereafter. The Government will relend the proceeds of \nthe loan to Uzbekistan Agency \"Uzkommunhizmat\" (UCSA) under a subsidiary loan agreement. \nThe relending will be done on ADB loan terms with an additional charge of not more than 0.2% \non the ADB interest rate (i.e., 1.2% during the grace period and 1.7% yearly thereafter). The \nUCSA will manage the funds allocated for Damkhoja Inter-Regional Trunk Main (IRTM) and \nonlend the proceeds of the subsidiary loan for other subprojects to the corresponding provincial \ngovernments on the same terms. The provincial governments will bear the foreign exchange \nrisks. \n \n                                                 \n1  International Monetary Fund. 2008. World Economic Outlook.

The existing tariffs (household) in the sample subproject vodokanals range from \nSUM66 per cubic meter (m3) to SUM95 per m3. For financial sustainability, the average tariff \nrequired for water supply after project completion is projected to range from SUM51 to SUM728 \nper m3 from 2015 to 2020. Table A17.1 shows the project tariff levels for household consumers \nat constant 2009 prices. These tariffs were based on the financial objectives enumerated in para. \n3 above and took into account the affordability of the tariffs to the households in the low-income \ngroup. \n \nTable A17.1: Projected Tariff Requirements and Affordability \n(constant 2009 prices) \n \nItem  2009  2010  2011  2012 2013 2014  2017  2020 \nDamkhoja                 \nTariff-SUM/m3  35  33  32  31  30  29  29  29 \nAffordability                 \nLow Income (%)  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - \nAverage Income (%)  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - \nGalaasiya                 \nTariff-SUM/m3  104  114  125  139  154  172  236  327 \nAffordability                 \nLow Income (%)  0.4  0.4  0.5  0.6  0.7  0.9  1.5  2.5 \nAverage Income (%)  0.3  0.3  0.3  0.4  0.5  0.6  1.1  1.9 \nKarmana                 \nTariff-SUM/m3  72  78  85  93  103  114  164  239 \nAffordability                 \nLow Income (%)  0.2  0.3  0.3  0.4  0.5  0.6  1.1  1.9 \nAverage Income (%)  0.2  0.2  0.2  0.3  0.3  0.4  0.8  1.4 \nTermez                 \nTariff-SUM/m3  37  42  48  55  64  74  124  209 \nAffordability                 \nLow Income (%)  0.5  0.5  0.6  0.7  0.8  1.0  1.7  2.5 \nAverage Income (%)  0.4  0.4  0.5  0.5  0.6  0.7  1.3  1.9 \nNote:  Damkhoja Inter-Regional Trunk Main (IRTM) sells water mainly to other vodokanals, therefore \nincrease of IRTM tariffs is reflected in the affordability of population served by those vodokanals. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n8.  Affordability.  An  affordability  analysis  was  undertaken  to  ensure  that  household \nconsumers, and particularly those in the low-income group, can afford the proposed water \ntariffs. On the generally accepted principle that the expenditure on water supply and sanitation \nservices should not exceed 4% of household income, the projected water tariffs are considered \naffordable. The table above shows the ratio of the monthly bills to the monthly household \nincome for the low-income and average-income groups. The monthly bills include payment for \nthe water meters in 36 equal monthly installments. In Termez, monthly bills include payment for \nboth water supply and wastewater services.  \n \n9.  Weighted  average  cost  of  capital  and  financial  internal  rate  of  return.  The \nopportunity cost of the government funds is assumed at 20%, including a risk premium. At a \nfunding ratio of 80:20 between ADB and the Government, the WACC is about 3.3% at constant \n2009 prices. The FIRRs are estimated to range from 4.4% to 8.3%. All FIRRs are higher than \nthe WACC. Sensitivity analysis also showed that all subprojects would still be financially viable \nunder the assumed adverse conditions. In addition, the proposed tariff rate increases would \ngenerate enough revenues to recover all O&M costs and debt service obligations. \n ", "Appendix 17  77 \n \nD.  Financial Performance of Vodokanals \n10.  Recent financial performance. The last 3 years of subproject vodokanals\u2019 operations \nshowed marginally positive net incomes, except at Galaasiya.2 The subproject vodokanals\u2019 \nfinancial performances from 2006 to 2008 are summarized in Table A17.2. \n \nTable A17.2: Recent Financial Performance Summary \n(SUM million) \n \n   Termez \n  Vodokanal    Damkhoja    Karmana    Galaasiya  \nDescription  2006  2007  2008  2006 2007  2008  2006 2007 2008  2006  2007 2008\nNet Sales  235   301   362   939  1,084  1,438  94  112  135   21   25  28 \nNet Income  1   0   1    7  0  1  2  3  0   (5)  (7) 0 \nCash \n14   12   9   10  3  7  2  1  1   0   0  0 \nBalance \nSource: Financial statements of vodokanals. \n \n11.  Projected  financial  performance.  Net  income  is  projected  to  be  positive  for  all \nsubprojects from 2017 onward, except for Termez Vodokanal which will start generating income \nfrom 2019 due to high depreciation costs. Net cash flow is to be positive for all subprojects from \n2014, the year after most of the project facilities are put into operation. The negative net income \nin the beginning years for some subprojects is due mainly to the time needed to expand the \nconnections and gradually increase tariffs. The difference between the net cash flow and net \nincome performance is mainly due to the time difference between the collection of depreciation \nallowance and repayment of the loan. \n \n12.  Damkhoja IRTM is projected to post a positive return on net fixed assets (ROA) of \n4.5%\u221214.3% from 2011 to 2020. The debt service ratio will be greater than 1.2 during the \nprojection period. Despite its insignificant rate of tariff increase, Damkhoja IRTM will generate \nhigh income margins during the projected period (11%\u201314%) due to economies of scale. The \ncost recovery ratio will stay above 1.0 throughout the period.  \n \n13.  Galaasiya vodokanal is projected to realize net income only from 2017 due to high \ndepreciation costs (at 60%\u201370% of total O&M costs). Consequently, the vodokanal will generate \npositive ROA ranging from 1.4% in 2017 to 13.5% in 2020. Debt service will exceed 1.2 during \nthe projection period.  \n \n14.  Karmana vodokanal is projected to be profitable from 2017 also due to high depreciation \ncosts, while net cash flow will remain positive throughout the project period starting from 2011. \nROA will range from 2.2% to 13.1% during 2017\u20132020. The debt service ratio will be greater \nthan 1.2 during the projection period. The cost recovery ratio will exceed 1.0 starting from 2013. \n \n15.  Termez City vodokanal will post positive income from 2019. Depreciation costs will be \nhigher than revenue during 2013\u20132015. ROA will range from 0.7% to 7.4% during 2018\u20132020. \nDebt service will exceed 1.2 during the projection period. It is worth noting that Termez city \nvodokanal tariffs for sewerage service are the same for all types of customers, while commercial \nand budget organizations make up 56% of the total customer base. Charging higher tariffs to \ncommercial and budget organizations would help the vodokanal to generate higher income at \nearly stages of the project. \n                                                 \n2  This income result was achieved by stinting on O&M, a practice that jeopardizes the system in the long run. \n ", " \n7\nINVESTMENT PROGRAM RISK MITIGATION PLAN  8\n \nMajor Risks  Risk Mitigation Actions  Indicators \nA.
