THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Metropolitan  Waterworks  and  Sewerage  System  (MWSS)  for  the  Angat  Water \nTransmission Improvement Project.1 \n \n2.  The project supports the rehabilitation of Angat transmission system, with the objective \nto  provide  sustained  and  secured  water  supply  to  Metro  Manila.  The  project  preparatory \ntechnical assistance prioritized constructing a new upstream tunnel to further improve water \ntransmission and secure future water supply for Metro Manila\u2019s 15 million inhabitants.2 The \nproject directly supports the government\u2019s sector development goal by providing access to safe, \nadequate and sustainable water supply to all by 2025.3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  More than 95% of the water supply for Metro Manila comes from a single source: the \nUmiray\u2013Angat\u2013Ipo, or Angat system. Water from the Angat reservoir is conveyed through three \nparallel tunnels followed by six parallel aqueducts, to water treatment plants in Metro Manila.4 \nThe treated water is then distributed to households, businesses, and industries in Metro Manila, \nand parts of Cavite and Rizal provinces. The transmission\u2019s tunnel system is up to 75 years old, \nin poor condition, and not in compliance with current structural and seismic requirements. These \nfactors could lead to serious interruptions of Metro Manila\u2019s water supply.  \n \n4.  The proposed project will construct the urgently required fourth parallel tunnel. This new \ntunnel will not increase system capacity, but it will enable the rehabilitation or decommissioning \nof the upstream tunnels and downstream aqueducts.5  \n \n5.  The proposed project aims to (i) help restore the full design capacity of the Angat \nsystems and thus ensure the sustainable provision of the water supply distribution system, and \n(ii) mitigate the risk of a total loss of water supply to Metro Manila and portions of Cavite and \nRizal provinces. Both objectives are essential for the stable economic growth of Metro Manila \nand the Philippines.6 The government has asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to finance \nthis investment. \n \n6.  Restoring  full  system  capacity.  The  MWSS,  a  government-owned  corporation, \nprovides water supply and sanitation services to Metro Manila and portions of Cavite and Rizal \nprovinces. In 1997, it awarded two concession contracts to private firms for water distribution \nand  wastewater  management.  The  MWSS  retained  responsibility  for  raw  water  supply. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance to the Philippines for Angat Water Transmission Improvement Project. Manila. \n(TA 8169-PHI, approved on 13 September 2012). \n3  Government of the Philippines, National Economic and Development Authority. 2010. The Philippine Water Supply \nSector Roadmap, 2nd Edition. Manila.  \n4  The Angat reservoir is a multipurpose dam for water supply, irrigation, and hydropower generation. It is located 35 \nkilometers northeast of Metro Manila. The tunnel and aqueduct system comprises six underground pipes with \nlengths of up to 15 kilometers and diameters of 2.0\u20133.7 meters. The oldest pipes were built in 1939, the newest \nwere constructed in 2012. \n5  The MWSS formally requested ADB assistance with the rehabilitation of the aqueducts. The project preparatory \ntechnical assistance is tentatively scheduled for 2016 approval.   \n6  The National Capital Region accounts for 32% of the gross domestic product of the Philippines. ", "2 \nPrivatizing the distribution services significantly improved the delivery of water supply services. \nThe serviced population has doubled since 1997, with 90% of the population having 24-hour \naccess. The level of nonrevenue water has been cut from more than 60% in 2002 to 10%\u201340% \nin 2015.  \n \n7.  With the  concessionaries\u2019  expanding  coverage,  demand  for  water  has  increased to \nabout 40 cubic meters per second (3.4 million cubic meters per day). Until now, the water \ngained through the concessionaires\u2019 nonrevenue water reduction programs could meet the \nincreased demand. Given that these programs will achieve their optimal results by 2018, raw \nwater  supply  must  be expanded  to cover future  increased  demand.7 The  MWSS  plans to \ndevelop another significant water source through the New Centennial Water Source Project.8 \nHowever, this will only be operational after 2021.9 There is therefore an urgent need to restore \nthe Angat system to its full design capacity of 46 cubic meters per second to ensure that future \ndemand can be met.  \n \n8.  Loss of water supply. The chance of a serious breakdown of Metro Manila\u2019s only water \nsource is increasing.10 This would lead to losses to the economy of Metro Manila and the \nPhilippines, as well as potential health hazards. The poor urban population would suffer most \nbecause  of  their  limited  capacity  to  tap  alternative  water  sources.  Recognizing  the  Angat \nsystem\u2019s critical importance to uninterrupted water supply to Metro Manila, the MWSS prioritized \nthe construction of a new aqueduct, which was completed in 2012.11 The full capacity of this \naqueduct can only be achieved if a new tunnel is constructed to feed raw water into it. This will \nalso substantially reduce the risk of full or partial water supply disruption. \n \n9.  Strategic focus. One of the main strategies in the Philippine Development Plan, 2011\u2013\n2016  is  attaining  high,  sustained  economic  growth  by  ensuring  a  stable  macroeconomic \nenvironment and investing in infrastructure. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132016 for \nthe Philippines supports the plan by reducing environmental degradation and vulnerability to \ndisasters, and by developing sustainable infrastructure in urban areas.12 \n \n10.  ADB\u2019s  Philippine  urban  sector  assessment,  strategy,  and  road  map  lists  the  acute \nshortage of potable water as the primary urban challenge, while the water supply and sanitation \nsector assessment, strategy, and road map states that weak planning and monitoring, and the \nlack of investments are core constraints to the sector\u2019s development. These constraints also \napply  to  the  MWSS.  The  proposed  project  will  support  ADB\u2019s  two  core  areas:  (i)  urban \ncompetitiveness, by focusing on economic infrastructure;13 and (ii) sustainable communities, by \nfocusing  on  environmental  infrastructure. 14  ADB\u2019s  Water  Operational  Plan,  2011\u20122020 \n                                                \n7  Further nonrevenue water reduction is not cost effective: the incremental benefits will not compensate for the \nincremental costs. \n8  System of dams, reservoirs, and transmission lines, located 40 kilometers east of Metro Manila. \n9  The Angat system is therefore critical to ensuring that the demand projected for 2021 can be supplied. After 2021, \nadditional sources, such as the first phase of the New Centennial Water Source Project and the Kaliwa Low dam, \nshould be operational to cover the demand projection until 2027. \n10  Experts estimate the probability of a partial breakdown at 20%, with a minimum capacity loss of one-third of the \ntotal capacity and a restoration period of 2 months. \n11  NJS Consulting Engineers. 2005.

Manila. \n13  Economic infrastructure comprises investments that generate revenue. \n14  Environmental infrastructure comprises infrastructure and services that have a positive impact on the environment \nand human health and welfare, such as water supply and sanitation. \n ", "3 \nrecognizes the need to foster water conservation and increase system efficiencies.15 The project \nsupports the proposed solution of reducing water loss and minimizing inefficient use of water. \n \n11.  The project directly supports the government\u2019s sector development plan by providing \nbulk water supply to priority areas, including Metro Manila.16 \n \n12.  Continued  ADB  support  to  private  sector development  and  good  governance. \nSince 1974, ADB has provided loans to finance 10 projects for the Metro Manila water system, \nincluding three for the Angat water supply system.17 ADB\u2019s special evaluation study concluded \nthat  ADB\u2019s  support  had  strengthened  the  MWSS\u2019  public  sector  role  and  public\u2012private \npartnership (PPP) agreements in water distribution.18 The study also noted that given the long-\nterm partnership with ADB and the widening demand\u2013supply gap, ADB should assist the MWSS \nfurther to improve Metro Manila\u2019s raw water supply. The proposed project will (i) strengthen the \ncapacity of the MWSS to fulfill its public sector responsibility of ensuring and securing the \navailability  of  raw  water  to  the  concessionaries,  and  (ii)  continue  ADB\u2019s  contribution  to \ndeveloping distribution services through the current PPPs.  \n \n13.  Previous  ADB  involvement  and  lessons  learned.  ADB\u2019s  country  assessment \nperformance evaluation concludes that ADB assistance has contributed to innovative solutions \nfor  providing  urban  services,  but  that  project  design  should  (i)  cover  the  wide  range  of \ncontextual  factors  such  as  the  multiple  agencies  involved,  and  (ii)  assess  the  institutional \ncapacity of the executing agency before committing to new projects.19 The project addresses \nthis  through  a  single-sector  and  single-agency  approach,  and  by  supporting  the  MWSS\u2019 \ninstitutional and management capacity during contracting and supervision of the works. \n \n14.  Special  features.  The  project  contributes  to  managing  the  disaster  risk  of  Metro \nManila\u2019s water supply by financing structural measures to limit the adverse impact of natural and \ntechnological hazards, and environmental degradation. Seismic and structural assessments \nwere carried out and bid documents were prepared incorporating the technical findings in the \nproject\u2019s bid documents.20 \n \n                                                \n15  ADB. 2011.

Impact and Outcome \n15.  The impact of the project is aligned with the government\u2019s sector development goal of \nproviding access to safe, adequate and sustainable water supply to all by 2025. The outcome is \nreliable and adequate water supply by the tunnel system. \nC.  Outputs \n16.  New  tunnel  constructed.  The new tunnel is about 6.3 kilometers long and has a \nfinished, internal span of about 4 meters. The works consist of (i) an intake structure at Ipo \nreservoir, (ii) tunnel works, (iii) a new transition basin at Bigte, (iv) connection of the new \ntransition basin at Bigte to the existing transition basin number 3 at Bigte, and (v) modifications \nto the existing transition basin number 3 at Bigte. \n \n17.  Capacity building support provided. This consists of (i) hand on training of MWSS\u2019 \nproject  management  office  staff  to  improve  skills  in  contract  management  and  contract \nsupervision;  and  (ii)  capacity  building  on  gender  awareness  promotion  and  training,  and \nimplementation  of  the  communication  strategy  with  regard  to  livelihood  opportunities  and \nawareness of health-related risks. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n18.

The Government of the Philippines has requested a loan of $123.3 million from ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources to  help finance  the project. The  loan  will  have  a  25-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 6.5 years, straight line repayment method, an annual interest rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility,21 a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year  (the  interest  and  other  charges  during \nconstruction to be capitalized in the loan), and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \n                                                \n21 The interest includes a maturity premium of 10 basis points. This is based on the above loan terms and the \ngovernment\u2019s choice of repayment option and dates. \n ", "5 \ndraft loan and guarantee agreements. Based on this, the average loan maturity is 16 years and \nthe maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.10% per annum. The loan will be guaranteed by the \nRepublic of the Philippines. The concession agreement provides for the concessionaires to \ninclude in their concession fees due to the MWSS and the MWSS' debt service obligations, \nincluding for this loan.

Implementation Arrangements \n20.  The MWSS is the executing agency. The project will be implemented by a team of \nMWSS staff, headed by a project manager and under the direct responsibility of the deputy \nadministrator  for  engineering  and  operation.  The  Department  of  Finance  and  the  National \nEconomic  and  Development  Authority  oversee  MWSS\u2019  operations  as  part  of  their  regular \noversight responsibilities on government-owned and controlled corporations. \n \n21.  The project manager and members of the team will coordinate with the concessionaries, \nthe common purpose facility, the consultants\u2019 team, the Department of Environment and Natural \nResources, and the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples. The MWSS will recruit a \nconsulting firm to help implement the project. The firm will serve as engineer following the \ndefinition of the International Federation of Consulting Engineers,22 with three main tasks: site \nsupervision,  contract  management,  and  capacity  development.

The procurement of the works is ongoing, with the first stage of the two-stage bidding \nprocess competed. Invitations to submit second stage bids were issued and bids are expected \nto be submitted by 22 March 2016.  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical  \n \n23.  A full technical study was completed, confirming the project\u2019s feasibility. The existing \nsystem was assessed on its structural condition, hydraulic performance, and seismic resilience. \nBased  on  geologic  and  geotechnical  surveys  using  maps  and  borehole  logs,  proposed \nalignment and stability requirements were defined. The findings, as presented in paragraphs 26 \nto 28, have been converted into appropriate design parameters, such as design and seismic \nloads, material properties, construction method, and durability requirements, and are included in \nthe technical requirements of the works contract financed by this loan. \n \n24.  Structural  condition. The older aqueducts  lose nearly 10% of their inflow through \nleakage. Remediation is likely to involve local repair and/or replacement of longer lengths of \npipe. The tunnels continue to convey significant volumes of raw water, which indicate that they \nare intact with no major collapse. Internal access will determine the internal condition and extent \nof remediation required. The other structures and appurtenances along the aqueducts are \ngenerally in poor condition. Rehabilitation will require replacement of most of these structures \nand appurtenances over time to ensure the transmission system\u2019s integrity.  \n \n25.  Hydraulic assessment. The assessed capacity of the transmission system\u2019s tunnels \nand aqueducts has been used to estimate the system\u2019s hydraulic characteristics. The results \nhighlight two important issues for the transmission system:  \n(i)  tunnel  capacity  is  below  the  calculated  maximum  potential  flow,  requiring \ninspection and rehabilitation; and  \n(ii)  the  aqueducts\u2019  full  capacity  is  unavailable  due  to  the  restrictions  in  system \noperation, requiring  increased flexibility  by  expanding  the  tunnel  system  and \nmodifying the interconnecting basins. \n \n26.  Seismic assessment. The assessment of aqueducts\u2019 structural resilience indicates that \nthere are no major issues to urgently address. The main concern is damage that will occur at \nhard and/or stiff points along the transmission system. It is recommended that this risk is best \naddressed by post-earthquake repair, rather than installation of expensive flexible joints. The \nfirst priority is to construct a new tunnel to augment the supply to the new aqueducts, improving \nflow conditions and operational flexibility in the transmission system.  \n \n \n \n ", "7 \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n27.  Financial and economic analyses were undertaken by calculating the financial internal \nrate of return (FIRR) and economic internal rate of return (EIRR), and comparing these with the \nhurdle rates\u2014the weighted average cost of capital and assumed economic opportunity cost of \ncapital\u2014as presented in Table 4. The project is considered financially and economically viable. \n \nTable 4: Financial and Economic Indicators \nNet Present Value  Net Present Value  Internal Rate  Hurdle \nIndicator  (Pesos million)  ($ million)  of Return (%)  Rate (%) \nFinancial   3,216.15  67.71   5.72     2.03 \nEconomic   1,238.06  26.06  15.42  12.00 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n28.  Financial  analysis.  Due  to  inadequate  or  poorly  documented  maintenance  of  the \ntransmission infrastructure during the past decades, the probability of failure in Metro Manila\u2019s \nwater supply increases over time. By creating redundancy and flexibility in diverting flows, the \nproject will allow rehabilitation of the transmission system without disrupting water supply to \nMetro Manila. It will not provide additional raw water supply or revenues for the MWSS or the \nconcessionaires; hence, the \u201cfailure rate\u201d approach was used to assess financial viability24. \nUnder  the  without-project  or  \u201cdo  nothing\u201d  scenario,  the  resulting  lost  revenue  for  the \nconcessionaires is compared with the project cost. The project\u2019s FIRR of 5.72% compares \nfavorably to the weighted average cost of capital of 2.03%.  \n \n29.  The  MWSS  retains  ownership  of  the  water  facilities  and  exercises  its  regulatory \nfunctions on water rates under the concession agreements between the MWSS and the two \nconcessionaires. The costs associated with the MWSS\u2019 major development projects, including \nthe 1% sovereign guarantee fee for the sovereign guarantee of the ADB loan, are passed on \nand paid by the two concessionaires as part of the debt servicing under the concession fees.  \n \n30.  Economic analysis. In the with-project scenario, the financial project cost is translated \nto its economic value using the domestic price numeraire by converting the foreign exchange \nand labor costs to their economic shadow prices. Furthermore, taxes are excluded in the \neconomic analysis as these are considered transfer costs. Under the without-project scenario, \nresource cost savings are valued by multiplying lost-billed volume with the weighted average of \nthe  economic  supply  price  of  alternative  water  for  domestic  and  nondomestic  use.  The \nalternative  sources  of  water  supply  include  small  private  companies  that  deliver  water  in \ncontainer drums to residential areas. The residential demand for alternative water supply is \nassumed to be about 40% of the total water demand, because consumers will tend to limit the \nuse of water to basic necessities due to significantly higher cost of alternative water compared \nwith what they normally pay. The project\u2019s EIRR of 15.4% compares favorably to the economic \nhurdle rate of 12.0%.  \n \n31.  Sensitivity  analysis.  This  analysis  shows  that  the  project  remains  financially  and \neconomically viable with a negative variation of 10% in the failure rate, flow rate, and water \nrates,  which  directly  correlate  with  the  project\u2019s  computed  benefits.  Changes  in  foreign \n                                                \n24 A fact-based failure rate assessment requires a full set of reliable and consistent historical data on partial and full \nfailure of the tunnel system, and consequent impacts on flow and recovery durations, which is lacking. For the \nAngat system, the failure rate assessment is based on the experts\u2019 opinion, expecting a system failure of once \nevery 5 years, reducing the flow by one-third of its full capacity, and requiring 60 days to restore full capacity.   \n ", "8 \nexchange  movement  and  operation  and  maintenance  costs  will  not  affect  significantly  the \nproject\u2019s financial and economic viability. The minimum calculated FIRR is 4.59% and the EIRR \nis 13.06%. \n \nC.  Governance \n32.  Financial management assessment. The MWSS has adequate capacity to manage \nthe project, as demonstrated by the completion of several projects financed by institutions such \nas ADB, Banque Nationale de Paris, Export\u2013Import Bank of China, the International Bank for \nReconstruction and Development, and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation.  \n \n33.  As a Philippine government-owned and controlled corporation, the MWSS follows the \nbasic policies and procedures outlined by the New Government Accounting System as required \nby the Commission on Audit (COA). The MWSS\u2019 administration undertook major reforms in \n2012, including cost rationalization on the employee benefits system and tight controls on \noperation and maintenance expenses. These reforms have improved the financial condition of \nthe MWSS. Since 2011, COA\u2019s audit reports found no major accountability issues.   \n \n34.  Procurement capacity assessment. Procurement will involve international competitive \nbidding for (i) designing and constructing tunnels, appurtenant structures, and ancillary facilities; \nand (ii) recruiting supervision consultants.  \n \n35.  The general procurement environment is adequate, and the MWSS has established a \npermanent Bid and Awards Committee (BAC) and technical working groups that receive regular \ntraining  on  government  procurement  policies  and  guidelines.  The  current  BAC  has  no \nexperience in procurement following ADB procedures, or in two-stage bidding processes, and \nhas limited experience in procuring design\u2013build contracts. The BAC and technical working \ngroup are aware that for contracts financed in whole or in part by ADB, procurement will follow \nthe provisions in the loan agreement and ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended \nfrom time to time), and ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from \ntime to time).  ADB will provide procurement support through grant-financed experts to assist \nwith the evaluation, negotiation, and awarding procedures of the works and services contracts. \n \n36.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998) was explained and discussed with the government \nand the MWSS. The risk assessment and risk management plan describes policy requirements \nand supplementary measures.25 \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n37.  The  project  is  classified  as  a general  intervention given  that  it  will  indirectly  target \npoverty reduction for the beneficiary water end users in Metro Manila and the communities \nresiding near the source, or source communities.26 In Metro Manila, the project will ensure the \ncontinuity of water supply to its 15 million residents. Both concessionaires have programs to \nensure that their services are accessible to the poor communities of Metro Manila.27 For the \nsource communities, the project will support the employment in civil works construction, as well \nas promoting local skills development.28 \n                                                \n25  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26  Bigte and San Mateo barangays, Bulacan Province. \n27   Manila Water\u2019s Tubig para sa Barangay (Water for the Poor) program and Maynilad Water Services\u2019 Samahang \nTubig Maynilad (Water Organization Manila). \n28  The target is for 50% of unskilled jobs to be filled by people from the source communities and indigenous peoples. \n ", "9 \n \n38.  The project is also classified as some gender elements. Proactive gender features have \nbeen included in the project design. These include (i) training in water conservation and hygiene \npromotion of source communities, with special focus on women and children; and (ii) promoting \npublic  awareness  among  men  and  women  in  the  source  communities  on  the  livelihood \nopportunities and benefits that will be generated during project construction. \n \n39.  Both  concessionaires\u2019  low-income  communities  programs  include  actions  for \nempowering women by including them in the decision-making and implementation processes. \nThe  MWSS  is  coordinating  the  project\u2019s  implementation  and  management,  including  the \ncollection of sex-disaggregated data for input and use in the regular monitoring and review of \ngender design measures, including the midterm review and project completion report.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n40.  Environment. The project is categorized as B, given that it is not expected to cause \nirreversible adverse environment impacts. An environmental impact screening was carried out \nand an initial environmental examination (IEE) report was prepared. The bid document includes \nan environmental management plan that ensures mitigation of identified environment impacts \nduring construction. The IEE follows a process that complies with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009) with supporting justification for Appendix 1, Section 8 regarding protected \nareas, Philippine laws and regulations, and compliance with the same. \n \n41.  Land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  categorized  as  C \nbecause  there  is  no  physical  and/or  economic  displacement  and/or  land  acquisition.  The \nconstruction and use of the tunnel, which is situated 50 to 200 meters below the ground surface, \ndo not impose any safety risks to the existing assets, establishments, surface structures, and \nland use. The legal rights of the land above the tunnel belong to the MWSS. The project \npreparatory  technical  assistance  confirmed  that  it  is  extremely  unlikely  that  any  future \ndevelopment on the surface will damage the tunnel\u2019s structural and functional integrity. A due \ndiligence report was prepared documenting the consultations with the households living along \nthe  tunnel  alignment.  Consultations  will  be  continued  throughout  the  project  cycle.  Any \nunanticipated impacts during implementation will be mitigated in accordance with the Safeguard \nPolicy Statement.   \n \n42.  Indigenous peoples. The project is categorized as B because the planned contractors\u2019 \nwork area of 1 hectare is part of the protected Ipo watershed area, which overlaps with an area \nclaimed as ancestral domain by the indigenous Dumagat people. The land is free from any \nstructures, establishments, and vegetation. The project\u2019s impact is limited to disturbances during \nconstruction. Consultations were held with the indigenous peoples communities living along the \ntunnel and an indigenous peoples plan (IPP) was prepared, outlining measures to mitigate \nthese disturbances. The IPP will be updated once a detailed engineering design is available, \nand will be posted on the ADB website. Meaningful consultations will be continued with the \nindigenous peoples in accordance with the Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n43.  Climate risks to the project are assessed by AWARE as \u201chigh\u201d due to potential increases \nin risks from flooding, landslides, and on-shore category 1 storms. Although these risks exist in \nprinciple due to the geographic location of the project, no alteration in location or design is \n ", "10 \nrequired. The intake structure is submerged under normal operating conditions and is unlikely to \nbe affected by flooding or landslides occurring upstream in either Angat or Ipo reservoirs.  \n \n44.  The project\u2019s key risks are limited to a lack of MWSS staff capacity to procure, recruit, \nand  effectively  supervise  project  implementation.  The  BAC  and  technical  working  group \nmembers  responsible  for  procuring  the  works  have  limited  experience  and  training  in \nprocurement through international competitive bidding, particularly in design\u2012build contracts and \nselection  of  project  implementation  assistance  consultants.  ADB  will  recruit  individual \nconsultants to assist the MWSS, while ADB Operations Services and Financial Management \nDepartment will supervise the procedures.  \n \n45.  The risks are assessed to be manageable and appropriate mitigation measures are in \nplace. The integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs of risk mitigation. \nMajor risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk \nmanagement plan.29 \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES  \n46.  The government and the MWSS have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nwill conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as detailed in the \nproject administration manual and loan documents. The government and the MWSS have \nagreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement \nand guarantee agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n47.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$123,300,000 to Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System, to be guaranteed by the \nRepublic of the Philippines for the Angat Water Transmission Improvement Project, from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 25 years including a grace \nperiod of 6.5 years, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft loan and guarantee agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n26 February 2016 \n                                                \n29 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Project is Aligned with: \nthe government\u2019s sector development goal of providing access to safe, adequate and sustainable water \nsupply to all by 2025.
