An environmental impact assessment was undertaken, and the \nsummary was circulated to the Board on 29 May 2002. \n \nThe Project is located in Shanxi, a relatively poor midwestern province of the \nPRC with a per capita gross domestic product (2000) at 61% of  the national \naverage.  The  Project  will  (i) construct  a  new  expressway  and  a  bridge  over \nthe Yellow River (Huang He); (ii) improve local roads servicing poor counties \nand  townships;  and  (iii) provide  consulting  services  and  training  to  enhance \nconstruction  quality,  road  safety,  vehicle  emissions  control,  and  project \nmonitoring  and  evaluation.  The  project  expressway  supports  the  PRC's \nWestern  Region  Development  Strategy,  which  aims  to  promote  economic \ngrowth,  reduce  development  disparities  between  the  western  and  coastal \nregions, and improve natural resources management. \n \nThe Project supports the national trunk highway system , one of the important \npriorities of the PRC Government. It is a system of interprovincial expressways \nand  high-class highways of about 35,000 kilometers (km), to be constructed \nover a 20-year period up to 2010. The PRC road network is underdeveloped in \nboth quality and extent with less than 3% classified as expressways or Class I \nhighways,  and  about 14% as Class II highways.  Large parts of the country, \nparticularly  poor  inland  areas  such  as  Shanxi  Province,  do  not  have \ndeveloped  roads,  restricting  access  to  markets  and  social  services.  Thus, \nroad development is a key component in the Government\u2019s strategy to provide \nneeded infrastructure to facilitate economic growth and reduce poverty through \nimproved access to markets and services.  \n \nThe  proposed  expressway  will  (i) serve  part  of  the  vital  Taiyuan-Xi'an \nCorridor (Inner Mongolia to Yunnan Province, 3,610 km) of the national trunk \nhighway  system,  passing  through  several  cities  in  different  provinces;  (ii) \nreduce congestion on national highway  G108; (iii) serve as an important link \nto  other  neighboring  provinces  by  acting  as  a  catalyst  in  promoting \ninterprovincial  trade  and  fostering  new  economic  activities  through  the \nconstruction of the Yellow River Bridge; (iv) improve the rural poor\u2019s access \nto  effective  means  of  transport  for  meeting  livelihood  needs  by  enhancing \nmobility  and  linking  poor  areas  to  growth  centers  providing  market  access, \nemployment  opportunities,  and  better  social  services  by  expanding  local \nroads;  (v)  improve  efficiency  of  both  road  passenger  and  freight  operations \nand  reduce  transport  costs,  congestion,  noise,  accidents,  and  vehicle \nemissions;  (vi)  promote  private  sector  investments  from  domestic  and \ninternational  sources  by  improving  road  accessibility;  and  (vii)  boost  further \ninvestments  in  Shanxi,  which  will  create  demand  for  goods  and  services \nprovided by the people in remote areas. \n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \nObjectives and \nScope \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nfrom  Houma \n\ntoll  expressway \n\nfour-lane  access-controlled \n\nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  has \nconsistently  been  a  feature  of  road  projects  in  the  PRC,  in  line  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s road subsector policy reform. ADB dialogue has centered on: \nimpacts  on  the  poor,  road  design  standards  and  construction  quality,  road \nsafety,  vehicle  emissions,  road  pricing,  corporatization,  commercialization, \nfinance,  and  resource  mobilization.  Policy  dialogue  is  integrated  in  ADB\u2019s \ntechnical assistance and loan activities in the PRC. \n \nThe main objectives of the Project are (i) to promote economic development \nin the project area; and (ii) to reduce poverty in Shanxi Province, particularly \nthrough sustaining economic growth benefits in poor counties and townships \nby  improving  accessibility  to  markets  in  rural  areas.  The  Project  comprises \nthe  following  components:  (i)  expressway  and  bridges\u2014construction  of  a \nto \n65 km \nYumenkou,  Shanxi;  Yellow  River  Bridge  (4.5 km)  and  toll  station;  four \ninterchanges;  11  large  bridges;  and  one  service  area;  (ii)  local  roads\u2014\nimprovement of about 70 km of local roads, which includes rebuilding 5 km of \nlocal link roads in Xinjiang county and 15 km of local roads in Jishan to meet \nClass  II  highway  standards;  upgrading  20 km  of  village  roads  in  Xinjiang \ncounty  and  30 km  of  local  county  roads  in  Hejin  to  Class  III  highway \nstandards;  and  reconstructing  two  bridges  across  the  Fenhe  and  Fenxi \nrivers,  Jishan  county;  about  $2  million  of  the  ADB  loan  will  be  provided  for \nthe  local  roads  component;  (iii)  equipment  for  road  maintenance,  toll \ncollection,  surveillance  and  communications,  load  testing,  road  safety,  and \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement;  and  (v) \noffice  administration;  (iv) \nconsulting  services  for  construction  supervision,  monitoring  and  evaluation, \nroad  safety  audits,  and  in-country  and  international  training  for  capacity \nbuilding. \n \nThe total cost of the Project, including physical and price contingencies and \ninterest during construction, is estimated at $326.8 million (CNY2,705 million \nequivalent),  of  which  about  $155.9 million  (47.7%)  will  be  the  foreign \nexchange  cost  and  $170.9 million  equivalent  (52.3%)  will  be  the  local \ncurrency cost. \n \n\n \nSource \n \nAsian Development Bank \nMinistry of Communications Grant \nShanxi Provincial Government Funds \nChina Minsheng Bank Loan \n \n \n \n\nTotal \n% \n\n \n\nForeign \nExchange \n \n124.0 \n0.0 \n31.9 \n0.0 \n \n155.9 \n47.7 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n \n0 \n56.8 \n65.8 \n48.3 \n \n170.9 \n52.3 \n\n \n($ million) \nTotal \nCost \n \n124.0 \n56.8 \n97.7 \n48.3 \n \n326.8 \n100.0 \n\n\fLoan Amount \nand Terms \n\n \nAllocation and \nRelending \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of \nUtilization \n \nEstimated \nProject \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting \nAgency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n\n \n\nv\n\nA loan of $124 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be provided \nunder  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility. \nThe loan will have a  24-year  term  including  a  grace  period  of  4  years,  an \ninterest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee of 1.0%, \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project \nAgreements. \n \nThe  ADB  loan  proceeds  will  be  relent  by  the  Borrower  to  Shanxi  Province. \nShanxi  Province  will  onlend  a  portion  of  the  loan  proceeds  in  an  amount  of \n$122  million  to  the  Shanxi  Hou-yu  Expressway  Construction  Company \nLimited (SHEC) on the same terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. \nSHEC will bear the interest rate variation and foreign exchange risks for the \namount  of  the  loan  proceeds  onlent  thereto.  Shanxi  Province  will  keep  the \nbalance of $2 million to be used for the local roads component and it will bear \nthe interest rate variation and foreign exchange risks for this amount. \n \nUntil 31 July 2007 \n\n \n31 January 2007 \n\n \nShanxi Communications Department (SCD) \n\nfor  Procurement. \n\nthe  ADB  Guidelines \n\n \nSCD  established SHEC for project expressway construction,  operation,  and \nmaintenance  in  October  2001.  SHEC  will  be  the  project  implementation \nagency to coordinate and monitor all project expressway activities. The local \nroad  program  will  be  implemented  by  the  county  communications bureaus, \nunder the supervision of SCD. \n \nAll  procurement  to  be  financed  under  the  ADB  loan  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance  with \nInternational \ncompetitive bidding (ICB) will be the basis for awarding: (i) ADB-financed civil \nworks  contracts  in  respect  of  the  project  expressway  estimated  to  cost  the \nequivalent of $5,000,000 or more; (ii) each civil works contract for local roads \ncomponent  of  the  Project  to  be  financed  by  the  Loan estimated to cost the \nequivalent of $2,500,000 or more; and (ii) supply contracts estimated to cost \nmore  than  $500,000.  Local  competitive  bidding  (LCB)  procedures  will  be \nused for: (i) each civil works contract for the project expressway estimated to \ncost the equivalent of less than $5,000,000; (ii) each civil works contract for \nlocal roads component of the Project to be financed by the Loan estimated to \ncost the equivalent of less than $2,500,000; (iii), and civil works contracts to \nbe \nthe  Government.  LCB  procedures  or  government \nprocurement  procedures  may  be  used  for  building  and  ancillary  facilities \nfinanced by the Government. Supply contracts estimated to cost $100,000 or \nless each may be under direct procurement. Civil works for local roads which \nare  scattered  in  various  locations  may  be  carried  out  by  SCD  on  a  force \naccount  basis.  The  Government  requested  ADB's  approval  for  advance \naction  for  procurement  and  approval  was  granted  in  June  2002.  Advance \n\nfinanced  by \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \nConsulting \nServices \n\n \nProject Benefits \nand \nBeneficiaries \n\naction  for  procurement  and  approval  was  granted  in  June  2002.  Advance \nprocurement action covers prequalification of contractors, tendering, and bid \nevaluation for civil works contract packages, excluding signing of contracts.  \n \nSHEC  will  establish  five  resident  supervision  offices,  staffed  with  domestic \nconsulting firms selected by SHEC, to directly supervise construction work in \nthe  field.  Overall  supervision  will  be  under  the  responsibility  of  the  Chief \nSupervision  Engineer  Office,  to  which  international  consultants  will  be  fully \nintegrated.  A  chief  supervision  engineer  (CSE)  and  two  deputy  chief \nsupervision engineers  will head the  Chief  Supervision  Engineer  Office. One \ndeputy chief supervision engineer  will be the team leader of the international \nconsultants  and  will  assist  the  CSE  in  project  and  contract  management \nactivities, and certify contractors\u2019 progress payment certificates and contract \nvariations  prior  to  their  approval  by  the  CSE.  International  consultants  will \nprovide  services  in  construction  supervision,  environmental  monitoring, \nresettlement monitoring and evaluation, poverty reduction monitoring, safety \naudit of the project design, project performance management systems, road \ntraining,  and  monitoring \nsafety  and  vehicle  emissions  monitoring, \nsocioeconomic performance indicators on poverty townships and villages. \n \nA  total  of  about  38  person-months  of  consultants  from  an  international \nconsulting  company  will  be  required  for  international  consulting  services. \nInternational  consultants  will  be  financed  under  the  loan,  and  recruited  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. In addition, the \nProject  will  require  2,300  person-months of domestic consultants. Domestic \nconsultants  will  be  financed  by  SHEC  and  recruited  in  accordance  with \ngovernment procedures satisfactory to ADB. \n \nThe  Project  will  foster  new  economic  activities  and  reduce  poverty.  The \nbenefits  from  the  Project  include  stimulating  economic  growth,  promoting \ninvestments,  increasing  access  to  markets  and  information,  creating  job \nopportunities,  and  increasing  incomes  of  the  project  area\u2019s  population. The \neconomic  benefits  arising  from  the  Project  include:  vehicle  operating  cost \nand  time  savings,  benefits  from  generated  traffic,  savings  from  avoided \naccidents,  savings  to  freight  in  transit,  and avoided  vehicle  emissions.  The \neconomic internal rate of return is estimated at 16.2%. The financial internal \nrate of return is 7.6%, which is higher than the real weighted average cost of \ncapital of 3.7%.  \n \nBenefits  to  the  poor  will  largely  be  in  terms  of  increased  economic \nopportunities  from  the  expressway,  and  social  gains  from  the  local  road \ncomponent and the implementation of a social development  action plan.  It is \nestimated  that  the  Project  will  directly  benefit  48,400  persons  (4.8%  of  the \nproject area\u2019s population) below the poverty line of CNY1,000 and CNY3,000 \nannual per capita income for rural and urban areas, respectively. Residents \nin  the  project  area,  and  farmers  and  rural  households  served  by  the  local \nroads,  as well as the urban  poor  are  identified  as  the  groups  most  likely  to \nreceive both direct income and non-income (access) benefits.  An estimated \n5,200  and  19,480  person-years  of  unskilled  and  skilled  labor,  respectively, \nwill be generated from project construction, and 395 permanent positions for \noperations.  Through  improved  accessibility,  an  increase  in  incremental \nincome is expected for those whose access to rural roads will be improved. \nThough there has been much agricultural development in recent years, land \n\n\f \n\nvii \n\nThough there has been much agricultural development in recent years, land \nand water resources are almost fully utilized. Thus, agriculture alone cannot \nprovide income levels above the poverty line. For the past 5 years, the region \nhas had  success in  reducing  poverty,  due  largely  to  increased  economic \nactivities.  The  project  expressway  will  be  a  major  catalyst  in  keeping  the \nregion  competitive  (in  terms  of  production  and  transport  costs),  thereby \nensuring  longer-term  employment  opportunities  and  preventing  people  from \nfalling  back  into  poverty.  ADB  approved  a  resettlement  plan  prepared  by \nSHEC in May 2002. \n \nThe Project has been formulated to reduce potential technical and economic \nrisks.  \n \nThe  main  technical  risks,  which  could  result  in  implementation  delays  are \nassociated  with  the  construction  of  the  Yellow  River  Bridge  and  11  other \nlarge bridges. To mitigate these risks, consultants have thoroughly reviewed \nthe  proposed  construction  methods.  During  construction,  monitoring  and \ncontract  management  information  systems  will  be  set  up  and  implemented \nwith  the  assistance  of  the  consultants  for  timely  identification  of  technical \nproblems  and  implementation  of  corrective  measures.  SCD  has  proven \nexperience  and  is  satisfactorily  implementing  similar  projects, including the \nShanxi Road Development Project for which  a  $250 million  ADB loan was \napproved in September 1999.  \n \nThere  are  no  major  environmental  and  resettlement  risks  and  adequate \nmitigation and monitoring mechanisms have been built into the Project. The \nproposed  Yellow  River  Bridge  is  2.5 km  from  the  northern  border  of  the \noriginal Hejin Gray Crane Wintering Ground Nature Reserve and  4 km from \nthe reserve\u2019s core zone boundary. These distances are adequate to  ensure \nthat  there  will  be  no  disturbance  to  wintering  cranes  from  the  proposed \nbridge  construction  and  operation.  Protective  measures  for  gray  crane \nhabitats  and  a  comprehensive  soil  erosion  control  plan  were  developed \nunder  the  guidance  of  the  State  Environmental  Protection  Administration, \nMinistry of Water  Resources, Shanxi Environmental Protection Bureau, and \nShanxi  Forestry  Department.  Additional  equipment  will  be  procured,  and \ntraining and capacity building will be undertaken to ensure the sustainability \nof  the  ecosystems.  These  costs  are  included  in  the  project cost. The State \nEnvironmental  Protection  Agency  has  approved  the  environmental  impact \nassessment and soil erosion control plan for the Project. \n \nWhile  a  financial  risk  is  associated  with  construction  and  operation  of  the \nexpressway,  its  extent  will  depend  upon  the  actual  construction  costs.  To \nmitigate this risk, SHEC is consciously oriented to building up a commercial \nbusiness  environment \nthe  project \nexpressway  will  receive  substantial  equity  injections  from  the  central  and \nprovincial  governments.  As  the  Project  will  generate  revenue  in  domestic \ncurrency,  there  is  a  risk  related  to  exchange  rate  changes.  Sensitivity  tests \nindicate that an adverse exchange rate change will  have only a limited effect \non the financial internal rate of return. \n\nfor  expressway  operations,  and \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \n1. \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Shanxi  Road  Development  II  Project.  The \nproject framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2. \nThe  Government  continues  to  have  a  multipronged  approach  to  development.  Road \ndevelopment is a key component in the development strategy to improve access to markets and \nservices. The government policies for road development are based on the following principles: \n(i) constructing  expressways  to  expand  the  national  trunk  highway  system  (NTHS)  to  link  all \ncities with a population of more than 500,000; (ii) developing secondary roads, particularly those \nthat  will  help  reduce  poverty  and  promote  rural  markets;  (iii) promoting  trade,  economic \nactivities,  commerce,  and  other  sociocultural  links  among  various  provinces;  and  (iv) building \nroads  that  will  support  regional  cooperation  with  neighboring  countries  in  the  southwest, \nnortheast, and northwest. In the PRC, the heart of the road network is the NTHS, a system of \ninterprovincial  expressways  and  high-class  highways  of  about  35,000 kilometers  (km),  to  be \nconstructed  over  a  20-year  period  up  to  2010  (Map  1).  As  part  of  a  multipronged  approach  to \nroad  sector  development,  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  also  includes  the  development  of  local \nroads.  These  are  consistent  with  the  Western  Region  Development  Strategy,  which  is  a  key \ntheme of the 10th Five-Year Plan (2001\u20132005). This Strategy aims to promote economic growth, \nreduce  disparities  between  the  western1  and  coastal  regions,  and  improve  environmental  and \nnatural  resources  management.  The  road  sector  forms  an  important  part of this Strategy as it \nprovides  a  vital  link  between  the  western  and  coastal  regions.  The  Project  will  support  the \nGovernment's  NTHS  and  the  Strategy,  as  part  of  an  important  artery  of  the  Taiyuan-Xi'an \ncorridor.  Detailed  analyses  of  the  road  subsector  and ongoing policy reforms in the subsector \nare given in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) operational strategy2 in the PRC\u2019s road subsector \n3. \nsupports (i) construction of roads that connect major growth centers and promote linkages with \nhinterland economies; (ii) integration of the network so that the NTHS is supported by a system \nof local roads, particularly those that provide access to poor areas; (iii) promotion of road safety; \n(iv) institutional  strengthening  to  increase  the  commercial  orientation  and  efficiency  of \nexpressway  organizations;  (v) improvement  of  highway  planning  and  evaluation  techniques; \n(vi) adoption  of  appropriate  pricing  policies  to  ensure  optimum  use  of  road  transport  capacity; \nand  (vii) use  of  alternative  methods  of  investment  financing,  including  private  sector \nparticipation.  The  strategy  reflects  an  integrated  approach  for  the  development  of  the  road \nsector by considering not only expressway and highway systems, but also local roads servicing \npoorer segments of the population.  \n \n4.  \nExternal assistance to the road subsector has come mainly from ADB, Japan Bank for \nInternational  Cooperation  (JBIC),  and  the  World  Bank.  Since  1985,  the  World  Bank  has \nprovided about $5.3 billion to finance 22 highway projects and six urban transport projects. JBIC \nhas provided about $990 million equivalent for six bridge projects and five highway projects in \nthe  NTHS.  Since  1991,  ADB  has  provided  21  loans  totaling  nearly  $3.9  billion  to  finance \n3,115 km  of  highway  development,  together  with  the  associated  5,042 km local road network, \n\n                                                 \n1  Consisting  of  12  provinces,  autonomous  regions,  or  municipalities:  Xinjiang,  Qinghai,  Gansu,  Ningxia,  Xizang, \nSichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Chongqing, Inner Mongolia, Guangxi, and one prefecture in Jilin, Hubei, and \nHunan provinces. \n\n2  ADB. 2002.

ADB  has  also  provided  the  road \nsubsector with 24 project preparatory technical assistance (TA) grants totaling $11.1 million and \n20 advisory TA grants totaling $12.0 million. The advisory TAs have supported the development \nof road infrastructure by addressing policy and institutional issues, including highway planning, \nroad  safety,  human  resources  development, \ntransport  pricing,  commercialization  and \ncorporatization,  and  mobilization  of  nongovernment  financial  resources.  Problems  and \nconstraints analysis is given in Appendix 2. ADB's future program for 2003\u20132005 includes seven \nprojects for which ADB aims to provide $1.8 billion in financing. The proposed expressway will \nconstruct an important link crossing over the Yellow River (Huang He) to the ongoing Shaanxi \nRoads  Development  Project.3  The  Shaanxi  Roads  Development  loan  was  signed  on  10  June \n2002 and the procurement process is ongoing. A summary of external assistance to the sector \nis given in Appendix 3. \n \nADB\u2019s  experience  in  the  PRC  road  subsector  has  shown  that  the  PRC  technical  staff \n5. \nhave adequate capabilities for design and construction supervision, and local contractors have \nproven  competence  in  construction  and  maintenance.  However,  the  PRC  needs  to  acquire \nexpertise in modern construction methods for long tunnels, large bridges, and flexible pavement \ndesign; modern operation methods for toll collections; and managerial skills of roads and related \ninstitutions, environmental protection, and commercial business practices. The use of ADB loan \nand TA funds to upgrade the capabilities of executing agencies (EAs) in previous projects has \ncontributed  to  improved  project  quality.  However,  to  meet  implementation  schedules,  the \nbidding process and construction quality have sometimes been compromised. Insufficient time \nallowed for soil settlement may have adversely affected pavement quality. ADB has taken these \nmatters up as part of the policy dialogue. \n \nB. \n \n6. \nThe  PRC  road  network  is  underdeveloped  in  both  quality  and  extent.  Despite \nconsiderable  investments  in  recent  years,  expressways  and  Class  I  highways  still  account for \nless  than  3%  of  the  total  road  network,  and  Class  II  highways  for  about  14%.4 The remaining \n83%  are  medium-  to  low-grade  paved  roads  and  gravel  roads.  Large  parts  of  the  country, \nparticularly  the  poor  inland  areas,  including  those  in  Shanxi  Province, do not have access to \nmarkets  and  adequate  social  infrastructure.  These  observations  were  confirmed  during  public \nconsultations that were carried out during project preparation. A chronology is given in Appendix \n4 and more details are given in Supplementary Appendix B. Due to the rapid growth of the PRC \neconomy since 1978, the demand for transport services has increased many fold. Furthermore, \nthe number of privately owned motor vehicles in the PRC increased more than 20 times during \n1985\u20132000, from 0.3  to  6.3  million  vehicles.  However,  the  country\u2019s  transport  capacity  is  still \nvery  limited.  Thus,  serious  constraints  remain,  especially  in  the  road  subsector.  As  a  major \nelement in the integrated approach to road development, local roads have been included  in the \nproject scope. This also makes ADB\u2019s intervention in the road subsector more effective in terms \nof poverty reduction (Supplementary Appendix C). \n \n7. \nThe  PRC's  road  investment  needs  from  1996  to  2010  are  estimated  at  $504  billion. \nAvailable  revenues  are  estimated  at  $302  billion  from  road  user  charges,  and  $29  billion  from \ntoll collections, leaving a financing gap of $173 billion or about $12 billion per year. Consistent \nwith  ADB's  policy  dialogue,  the  Government  is  creating  a  framework  to  attract private sector \nfinance for road construction. While the private sector is willing to participate under concession \nagreements,  or  in  refinancing,  leasing,  and  securitization,  it  has  been  difficult  to  finance  build-\noperate-transfer  (BOT)  type  projects,  which  entail  the  private  sector  taking  the  initial  risks  of \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President on a Proposed Loan to the PRC for the Shaanxi Roads \n\n4  The Shanxi highway transportation infrastructure is also underdeveloped. Its expressway length accounts for about \n\nDevelopment Project. Manila. \n\n0.9% of its total road network. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3\n\nconstruction and traffic demand. Private sector financing is most likely to be available to finance \nabout  5%  of  the  high-grade  and  provincial  road  networks.  More  details  about  nongovernment \nfinancing and road sector revenues are given in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n8. \nThe Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country operational strategy and the Government\u2019s \npolicies and strategies. It reflects an integrated approach to road transport sector development \nas  a  component  of  overall  economic  development.  It  will  connect  economic  growth  centers  in \nShanxi, through the expressway and bridges component, and support the development of local \nroads that will provide the local poor with access to economic centers. The Project will serve as \na vital part of the Taiyuan-Xi'an corridor of the NTHS. It connects to the 176 km Qixian-Linfen \nExpressway  under  Loan  1701-PRC:  Shanxi  Road  Development  Project  through  the  40 km \nLinfen-Houma  Expressway  (financed  by  the  local  government),  which  is  expected  to  open  to \ntraffic in December 2002. The Project also links to the 176 km Yumenkou-Yanliang Expressway \nunder Loan 1838-PRC: Shaanxi Roads Development Project. Therefore, once the proposed 65 \nkm Houma-Yumenkou Expressway, including the Yellow River Bridge under the Project, is built, \nabout 457 km of the Taiyuan-Xi'an corridor, from Qixian in Shanxi to Yanliang in Shaanxi, will be \ncompleted (Map 2).  \n \n9. \nAs  a  result  of  recent  rapid  economic  growth,  between  1990  and  2000 road passenger \ntraffic in Shanxi increased from 5.9 billion to 13.6 billion passenger-km. This corresponds to an \naverage  annual  growth  rate  of  8.7%.  Road  freight  traffic  in  Shanxi  Province  increased  from \n11.5 billion  to  27.0  billion  ton-km,  or  an  average  annual  growth  rate  of  8.9%  over  the  same \nperiod. In contrast, the national growth rates were 9.7% and 5.9%, respectively, over the same \nperiod.  Keeping  abreast  with  the  20-fold  national  increase,  privately  owned  motor  vehicles  in \nShanxi  totaled  about  235,078 in 2000.  Increased demand for transport services has not been \nmatched by expansion in the road subsector. Two railroads are currently operating in the project \narea: the South Tong-Pu Railway and the Huo-Xi Railroad. The Hou-Xi Railroad, running from \nHouma  to  Xi'an  in  Shaanxi  Province,  is  parallel  to  the  project  expressway.  These  do  not, \nthough,  meet  the  expanding  transport  requirements.  The  Hou-Xi  Railroad  carried  2.2 million \npassengers and 8.2 million tons of freight in 1996. \n \n10. \nDespite  the  rapid  increase  in  the  total  number  of  vehicles,  Shanxi  has  only  about  1.7 \nvehicles (trucks, cars, or buses) for 100 persons. Modernization of the vehicle fleet is needed to \nimprove  vehicle  safety  and  reduce  fuel  consumption  and  vehicle  emissions.  In  Shanxi,  road \nmaintenance  fees  and  domestic  borrowing  are  major  financing  sources  for  the  budget.  An \nincreasing  proportion  of  provincial  road  budgets  is  being  used  to  meet  the  national  priority  for \nexpressway  and  highway  construction.  Given  the  PRC's  rapid  economic  growth  and  vehicle \nownership, both the public and private vehicle fleets are expected to continue to grow rapidly in \nthe coming years. In Shanxi, annual traffic volume growth in 2000\u20132001 was about 9.4%, with a \nrising trend. This will result in substantial increases in the volume of road traffic and mounting \ncongestion.  \n \n11. \nADB  has  been  actively  involved  in  policy  dialogue  on  the  PRC  road  subsector  since \n1991.  Recently,  the  principal  issues  addressed  include  the  poverty  reduction  impact  of  road \nprojects,  highway  design  standards  and  construction  quality,  road  safety,  vehicle  emissions, \nfinancing \npricing  policies,  commercialization  and  corporatization,  and  nongovernment \nresources. The current status and achievements to date are summarized in the Road Subsector \nPolicy Reform Plan. The Plan and a summary of the road sector analysis are given in Appendix \n5. \n \n12. \nADB  evaluation  shows  high  levels  of  performance  for  ongoing  transport  projects  and \nTAs  in  the  PRC.  The  maintenance  of  roads  completed  under  ADB-financed projects has not \nbeen a problem in the country. An effective budgetary allocation system is in place, and strong \ninstitutional capacity to maintain the expressway system has been developed. Recent TAs have \n\n\f4\n\n \n\n \n\nbeen instrumental in focusing the Government's attention on the need to expand its sources of \nfinance  for  highway  development,  as  well  as  on  the  institutional,  policy,  and  regulatory  issues \nthat need to be addressed to facilitate the use of a broader set of modalities for domestic and \nforeign  resource  mobilization.  An  ADB-financed  study  helped  the  Government  identify  road \nprojects  and  capacity-building  activities  in  the  southwest  region  for  implementation  during  the \n10th Five-Year Plan period. This shift in policy direction is in line with ADB's strategic objective of \nreducing poverty in inland provinces.  \n \n13. \nBy  maintaining  dialogue  integral  to  TA  and  loan  activities,  ADB  has  ensured  that  its \noperations  are  consistent  with  the  Government's  road  subsector  policy  reform.  Hence  the \nProject adds dimension to the traditional road project concept. Through an integrated approach, \nit brings the usual benefits associated with a road project. It will improve the efficiency of both \nroad  passenger  and  freight  operations  through  reducing  transport  costs,  traffic  congestion, \ntraffic noise, traffic accidents, and vehicle emissions, and through increasing service frequency. \nThrough the local roads component, it will also improve access of the poor to effective means of \ntransport  for  meeting  their  livelihood  needs  through  enhancing  the  mobility  of  poor  rural \nhouseholds, thereby increasing market opportunities and social services (such as access of the \nsick and injured to health facilities). It will also boost investments, since lack of roads and poor \naccessibility  are  among  the  most  frequently  cited  impediments  faced  by  international  and \ndomestic sources to invest in poor interior provinces.5  \n \nAn  integrated  approach  extends  these  benefits  and  brings  the  Project  into  the  larger \n14. \ndevelopment needs of the province and the region. The Project goes beyond the project area by \nproviding  a  vital  link  to  the  rest  of  the  country  through  both  its  expressway  and  local  roads \ncomponents. It will facilitate interprovincial trade, improve transport services in urban areas, and \nconnect  poorer  rural  areas  to  vital  growth  corridors.  It  will  connect  people  from  two  provinces, \nthrough the Yellow River Bridge component, resulting in the revival of social and cultural links \nwhile  promoting  economic  development.  The  Project  also  brings  technology,  evident  in  the \nYellow  River  Bridge  being  the  largest  ADB-financed  bridge  in  the  PRC  using  state-of-the-art \nconstruction  skills  and  technologies,  thereby  raising  standards  in  road  projects.  In  view  of  the \nneed  for  institutional  strengthening,  the  Project  will  endorse  capacity  building  in  construction \nsupervision,  project  quality  control,  road  safety  measures,  and  performance  monitoring \nactivities.  The  Project  integrates  road  and  transport  development  into  the  broader  context of \neconomic  and  human  development,  by  increasing  access  and  connectivity  between  areas, \npeoples, and ideas.  \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nObjectives \n\n \nA. \n \nShanxi  Province  is  a  relatively  poor  interior  province  located  in  the  midwestern  part of  \n15. \nthe  PRC.  Shanxi  had  around  1.7 million  rural  poor  by  the  end  of  2000,  based  on  an  annual \nincome of CNY1,000 per person. This accounts for about 7.5% of the rural population of Shanxi \nprovince  of  22.7  million.6  In  2000,  the  average  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  per  capita  in \nShanxi  was  CNY4,285,  or  about  61%  of  the  national  average  (CNY7,079).  Since  1980, \neconomic growth in Shanxi has, at an average of 9.2% per annum, been slightly lower than the \nnational  average  of  10.1%  per  annum.  The  Project  will  reduce  transport  costs,  promote \neconomic  development,  and  reduce  poverty  through  improved  rural  activities  and  employment \ngeneration in the project area. As a result of the ADB\u2019s policy dialogue, the scope of the Project \nhas been expanded to strengthen its development impact through a local roads component to \nimprove  the  access  of  poor  communities  in  the  project  area.  The  Project  involves  building  an \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2002. Private Sector Assessment in the PRC (draft).

As a single source, the main economic activity in the project \narea  is  agriculture.  Production  of  construction  materials,  small-scale  industries,  coking, \nmetallurgical industries, and commerce also contribute to economic output in the project area. \n \nB. \n \n16. \n \n\nThe scope of the Project includes: \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nExpressway  and  Bridge  Component.  Construction  of  a  65 km  four-lane \naccess-controlled toll expressway from Houma to Yumenkou in Shanxi including \nconstruction  of  a  4,566-meter  (m)  long  Yellow  River  Bridge  and  construction  of \nfour interchanges with four toll stations, a toll station on the Yellow River Bridge, \n11 large bridges, and one service area. \n\nLocal Roads Component. Improvement of 70 km of local roads, which includes \nrebuilding 5 km of local link roads in Xinjiang county and 15 km of local roads in \nJishan  to  meet  Class  II  highway  standards,  upgrading  20 km of village roads in \nXinjiang  county  and  30 km  of  local  county  roads  in  Hejin  to  Class  III  highway \nstandards, and reconstructing two bridges (300 m and 350 m) across the Fenhe \nand Fenxi rivers, Jishan county (Supplementary Appendix E). \n\n \n(iii)  Equipment  Component.  Procurement  of  equipment  for  road  maintenance,  toll \ncollection,  surveillance  and  communications, load testing, ecological monitoring, \nsoil erosion control, and office administration. \n\nLand Component. Land acquisition and resettlement. \n\nConsulting  Services  Component.  Construction  supervision,  environmental \nmonitoring,  resettlement  monitoring  and  evaluation,  poverty  reduction  impact \nmonitoring,  safety  audit,  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS) \nincluding  socioeconomic  performance  indicators,  vehicle  emissions  monitoring, \nand in-country and international training for capacity building. \n\n \nC. \n \n\nSpecial Features \n\nAsian Development Bank Loan to the Local Roads Component \n\n1. \n \n17. \nTo  ensure  an  integrated  approach  to  road  development,  the  Project  includes  the \nimprovement  of  about  70 km  of  local  roads.  The  total  cost  of  the  local  roads  component is \nestimated  at  approximately  $13.2 million  (CNY109.9 million  equivalent),  of  which  about \n$2.5 million  (19%)  will  be  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $10.7 million equivalent (81%) is the \nlocal currency cost. For the local roads component, about $2 million will be provided under the \nADB loan. \n \n\n2. \n\nMonitoring of Socioeconomic Impact \n\n \n18. \nTo enhance the poverty reduction impact of the Project, it was agreed by SPG that (i) all \nroads financed under the Project, i.e., the expressway and the local roads, would utilize wage \nlabor, with wages being set at market rates for unskilled labor; and (ii) construction companies \ninvolved  in  civil  works  for  the  Project  would  commit  to  hiring  the  highest  possible  share  of  the \nlabor  force  from  poor  villages.  Labor  teams  would  be  identified  by  the  Shanxi  Hou-yu \nExpressway Construction Company Limited (SHEC) and local contractors by way of agreement \nto  ensure  the  maximum  employment  of  unskilled  poor  workers  in  the  project  area,  under the \n\n\f6\n\n \n\n \n\nthe  Project  will  be  monitored  during  and  after \n\nsupervision  of  an  external  monitoring  agency.  Socioeconomic  effects  and  poverty  reduction \nimpacts  of \nimplementation.  Shanxi \nCommunications  Department  (SCD)/SHEC  will  engage  4  person-months  of  international \nmonitoring specialist (2 for the expressway and 2 for the local roads component) and a domestic \nfirm  or  academic  institution  for  a  total  of  10  person-months  to  monitor  project  impacts  and \nassess  the  changes  in  socioeconomic  conditions  in  poor  areas  and  counties.  Socioeconomic \ndata  will  be  collected  and  analyzed  according  to  the  indicators  suggested  in  the  PPMS.  The \nimpact  of  the  Project  on  poverty  reduction  will  be  evaluated  during  and  after  project \nimplementation. Socioeconomic data will be collected and analyzed according to the indicators \nsuggested in the PPMS. \n \n\n3. \n\nCorporatization and Corporate Governance  \n\n \nCorporatization in the road sector is an important part of ADB's policy dialogue with the \n19. \nGovernment  to  encourage  the  separation  of  construction  and  operations  from  provincial \ngovernment functions. It is also the Government\u2019s policy to corporatize expressway operations \nand,  in  line  with  this  policy,  SHEC  was  established  in  October  2001  for  the  purpose  of \nconstruction, maintenance, and operations of the project expressway. SHEC is  a limited liability \ncompany governed by PRC company law. As a government-owned company, it has a board of \ndirectors  comprising  a  chairperson  and  four  other  members  to  decide  on  corporate  and \nmanagement  matters.  A  general  manager  and  several  vice  general  managers  will  be \nresponsible  for  its  daily  operation  in  accordance  with  its  charter.  Corporatization  is  being \nimplemented  successfully  under  the  first  Shanxi  Road  Development  Project.7 Shanxi Province \nand SHEC will also sign a project expressway construction, operation and maintenance (O&M), \nand  management  concession  framework  agreement  to  (i) establish  a  formal  relationship \nbetween SCD and the expressway company; (ii) ensure autonomy of operation; (iii) encourage \nestablishment  of  road  facility  performance  indicators;  and  (iv) facilitate  future  refinancing, \nprivatization,  and  securitization  of  the  project  expressway  (Supplementary  Appendix  F).  The \nproject  expressway  operation,  revenue  collection,  and  debt  service  obligations  will  be \ntransferred  to  SHEC  in  accordance  with  the  concession  agreement  and  the  onlending \nagreement. By 31 December 2004 a corporate development plan will be formulated by SHEC, \nand  submitted  to  ADB,  to  achieve  the  objectives  of  (i) operating SHEC on commercial basis, \n(ii) improving  its  efficiency,  and  (iii) ensuring  its  operation  in  compliance  with  its  charter  and \ncompany law (Supplementary Appendix G). \n \n\n4. \n\nConstruction Supervision \n\n \nFor  better  construction  supervision,  a  chief  supervision  engineer  office  (CSEO)  will  be \n20. \nestablished  in  SHEC.  The  chief  supervision  engineer  (CSE)  will  be  supported  by  two  deputy \nchief  supervision  engineers  (DCSEs).  One  DCSE  will  be  the  team  leader  of  the  international \nconsultants  and  will  assist  the  CSE  in  project  and  contract  management  activities,  and certify \ncontractor  progress  payments  and  contract  variations  prior  to  their  approval  by  the  CSE.  This \narrangement  was  started  in  the  ongoing  Shanxi  Road  Development  Project  successfully.  The \ninternational consultants will supervise construction during the winter to ensure implementation \nof the protection measures and action plans for protection of the wintering gray cranes near the \nYellow River Bridge area.  \n \n\n5. \n\nYellow River Bridge  \n\n \nThe geological conditions of the riverbed of the Yellow River require special treatment on \n21. \nthe  design  of  bridge  foundations.  For  the  bridge  itself,  four  types  of  bridges  were  considered. \nAfter  careful  evaluation  of  the  alternatives  during  the  feasibility  study  and  design  stage,  a \n                                                 \n7 ADB. 1999.

The estimated construction period of the bridge \nis about 42 months, costing approximately CNY731 million or $88.3 million equivalent. \n\nResettlement Plan \n\n \n6. \n \nConsistent  with  the  1998  Land  Administration  Law,8  which  requires  disclosure  of \n22. \ninformation and consultation with affected persons, a resettlement information booklet, together \nwith  provincial  compensation  rates,  was  distributed  to  affected  villages  and  persons  and \npublicized  in  the  local  media  on  25  April  2002.  The  resettlement  information  booklet  contains \nsections  on  resettlement  impacts,  the  resettlement  policy,  compensation  rates  and  policies, \norganizational  arrangements,  consultation  and  participation,  and  grievance  procedures. \nFeedback  from  affected  persons  was  received  and  reviewed  by  SCD  and  ADB  to  ensure  that \nany further concerns should be addressed. Based on these, a resettlement plan was submitted \nto  ADB  on  10  May  2002.  ADB  approved  the  resettlement  plan  and  it  was  provided  to  county \noffices in August 2002. A detailed measurement survey will be undertaken after approval of the \npreliminary  design  report,  and  38  affected  villages  will  participate  in  the  preparation  of \nrehabilitation  plans  for  land  readjustments  and  income  restoration.  Additional  information \nincluding  village  rehabilitation  plans  will  be  approved  by  the  county  resettlement  offices  and \nforwarded  to  ADB  for  its  concurrence.  Land  acquisition  will  start  only  after  that.  Local \ngovernment will be responsible for implementing the resettlement plan, including measures for \nlivelihood  and  income  rehabilitation  of  all  affected  people.

The loan from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be provided under ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility.  The  loan  will  have  a  24-year  term \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  4  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  a  front-end fee of \n1.0%, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements. \nThe ADB loan proceeds will be re-lent by the Borrower to Shanxi Province, a portion of which in \nan amount of $122 million will be onlent to SHEC on the same terms and conditions as those of \nthe ADB  loan.  SHEC  will  bear  the  interest  rate  variation  and  foreign  exchange  risks  for  the \namount of the loan proceeds onlent thereto. Shanxi province will retain the balance of $2 million \nof  loan  proceeds  for  development  of  local  roads.  The  Government,  through  the  Ministry  of \nCommunications (MOC), SCD, and a domestic bank (China Minsheng Bank [CMB]) will finance \nthe  remaining  project  cost.  The  CMB  loan  will  be  $48.3 million  (CNY400 million)  and  will  be \npayable over 15 years, including a grace period of 4 years, at a variable lending rate, currently \nabout 6.2% per annum.

SCD \nestablished SHEC for project expressway construction and O&M in October 2001. SHEC will be \nthe  project  implementation  agency  to  coordinate  and  monitor  all  project  expressway  ac tivities. \nSHEC is headed by a chairperson and has five departments. SHEC's general manager will be \nthe project director responsible for overall management of the project expressway component. \nThe local roads component will be implemented by the county communications bureaus, under \nthe  supervision  of  SCD.  Organization  charts  of  SCD  and  SHEC  are  given  in  Supplementary \nAppendix I. To facilitate land acquisition, resettlement, and environmental protection measures, \nand  to  ensure  that  local  concerns  are  adequately  addressed,  project  implementation \ncommittees of local officials will be established in the Henjin, Jishan, and Xinjiang counties. In \naddition,  under  the  CSE,  five  resident  offices  will  be  established  in  the  field.  Project \nadministration  issues  were  discussed  during  the  appraisal  mission  and  a  draft  project \nadministration memorandum was given to SCD and SHEC (Supplementary Appendix J). \n\n \n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n26. \nPreconstruction activities of ADB-financed works, such as detailed design, preparation of \nbidding  documents,  prequalification  of  contractors,  tendering,  and  bid  evaluation  of  contracts \nbegan in May 2002 and will be completed by May 2003. Overall project construction, including \nthe  Yellow  River  Bridge,  is  scheduled  to  start  in  August  2003  and  take  about  42  months,  the \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\nanticipated completion date being January 2007. Implementation of the local roads component \nwill  be  concurrent  with  expressway  construction.  The  project  implementation  schedule  is \nattached in Appendix 7. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n27. \nAll procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nthe ADB Guidelines for Procurement. International competitive bidding (ICB) will be the basis for \nawarding: (i) ADB-financed civil works contracts in respect  of the project expressway estimated \nto  cost  the  equivalent  of  $5,000,000  or  more;  (ii)  each  civil  works  contract  for  local  roads \ncomponent  of  the  Project  to  be  financed  by  the  Loan  estimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of \n$2,500,000  or  more;  and  (ii)  supply  contracts  estimated  to  cost  more  than  $500,000.  Local \ncompetitive  bidding  (LCB)  procedures  will  be  used  for:  (i)  each  civil  works  contract  for  the \nproject expressway estimated to cost the equivalent of less than $5,000,000; (ii) each civil works \ncontract for local roads component of the Project to be financed by the Loan estimated to cost \nthe  equivalent  of  less  than  $2,500,000;  (iii),  and  civil  works  contracts  to  be  financed  by  the \nGovernment. LCB procedures or government procurement procedures may be used for building \nand ancillary facilities financed by the Government. Supply contracts estimated to cost $100,000 \nor less each may be under direct procurement. Civil works for local roads which are scattered in \nvarious  locations  may  be  carried  out  by  SCD  on  a  force  account  basis.  Prequalification, \ntendering,  and  bid  evaluation  for  the  procurement  under  ICB  and  international  shopping \nprocedures  will  be  carried  out  with  the  assistance  of  a  qualified  tendering  company. \nProcurement for ADB financing will include 13 packages of civil works to be implemented under \nICB  procedures,  and  six  packages  of  equipment  under  ICB/international  shopping/direct \nprocurement  procedures.  Prequalified  contractors  with  adequate  technical  and  financial \ncapacities will be allowed to bid for several packages and, if successful, may be awarded more \nthan  one  contract  based  on  a  least-cost combination of contracts. The detailed list of contract \npackages is in Appendix 8. \n\n \n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n28. \nIt is estimated that a total of about  38 person-months of international consultants will be \nrequired,  of  which  29  person-months  are  for  project  management  and  supervision  of  the \nexpressway; 4 person-months for social and poverty reduction impact monitoring and evaluation \n(2 each for the expressway and local roads component); 2 person-months for road safety; and 1 \nperson-month each for protected area management and environmental compliance monitoring, \nvehicle emissions control, and training engineering staff engaged in the local roads component. \nThe  previously  stated  29  person-months  of  international  consultants  will  be  used  for  project \nadministration  and  implementation  supervision.  The  quality  and  cost-based selection method \nwill  be  used  to  engage  an  international  consulting  firm.  Overall  project  supervision  will  be  the \nresponsibility of the CSEO, with which the international consultants will be fully integrated. One \nDCSE will be the team leader of the international consultants and will assist the CSE in project \nand  contract  management  activities,  and  certify  contractor  progress  payments  and  contract \nvariations prior to their approval by the CSE. The DCSE will supervise construction during the \nwinter to ensure implementation of the protection measures for wintering gray cranes near the \nYellow  River  Bridge  area.  Other  international  experts  will  provide  short-term assistance to the \nCSEO in the areas of road safety, and project monitoring and evaluation for a PPMS, including \nsocioeconomic performance indicators. International consultants will be financed under the loan, \nand  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants. Internationally \nrecruited consultants will be required to closely work with domestic consultants. \n \n29. \nIt is estimated that about 2,300 person-months of domestic consultants will be required \nfor  the  Project.  The  domestic  consulting  firm  will  be  financed  by  SHEC  and  recruited  in \naccordance  with  government  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  About  five  resident  supervision \n\n\f10\n\n \n\n \n\nengineer offices (RSEOs) will carry out direct supervision of construction works. Each RSEO will \nsupervise  one  or  two  of  the  major  civil  work  contract  packages.  SHEC  will  select  about  five \nseparate  domestic  consulting  companies  to  staff  the  five  RSEOs.  In  addition  to  construction \nsupervision,  domestic  consultants  will  assist  SHEC  in  environmental  monitoring,  resettlement \nmonitoring, project performance monitoring and evaluation, and SHEC's activities in road safety \nand  vehicle  emissions  control  action  plan  preparation.  Outline  terms  of  reference (TOR) for \nconsulting services are in Supplementary Appendix K.  \n\n \n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n30. \nAll  disbursements  under  the  ADB  loan  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  ADB \nLoan  Disbursement  Handbook.9  Since  most  of  payments  will  be  made for large contracts well \nabove $100,000, direct payment, reimbursements, and commitment procedures will be used to \nwithdraw  the  loan  funds.  If  government  funds  are  first  used  for  eligible  expenditures,  ADB's \nreimbursement procedure will be used. Statements of expenditure will be used for all payments \nunder $100,000 to expedite fund flows. \n \n\n6. \n\nAdvance Procurement Action \n\nThe  Government  has  requested,  and  ADB  approved \n\n \n31. \nin  June  2002,  advance \nprocurement action for civil works.10 This covers prequalification of contractors, tendering, and \nbid evaluation for civil works contract packages, but does not include signing of contracts. The \nadvance  actions  are  being  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Procurement \nand  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  The  Government,  SCD,  and  SHEC  have  been \nadvised that approval of the advance actions does not commit ADB to financing the Project. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n32. \nSHEC  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  Project  and  related financial statements, \nsuch as statements of source and application of funds, implementation of the Loan Agreement, \nincome  statements,  and  balance  sheet.11  The  income  statements  will  be  started  on \ncommencement  of  toll  operations.  SHEC  will  prepare  one  set  of  financial  statements  for  the \nProject  and  have  them  audited  annually.  The  audit  will  be  in  accordance  with  appropriate \nauditing standards consistently applied, by independent external auditors whose qualifications, \nexperience, and TOR are acceptable to ADB. SHEC will submit to ADB within 9 months of the \nend  of  each  related  fiscal  year,  certified  copies  of  audited  project  accounts  and  financial \nstatements and an auditor\u2019s report for the Project, all in the English language.  \n \n33. \nDuring  the  midterm  review  in  2004  or  some  other  date  agreed  by  SHEC  and  ADB, \nfinancial  projections  of  SHEC  for  the  next  5  years  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  its  review  and \nsuch projections will be updated annually thereafter. Financial performance and projections are \ngiven  in  Appendix  9.  The  Government  has  agreed  that,  as  in  previous  ADB-financed projects, \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  will  be  made  for  reporting  the  progress  of  project \nimplementation.  In  this  regard,  SCD/SHEC  will  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  progress  reports, in \nsuch  form  and  detail  as  ADB  may  request,  and  brief  monthly  updates.  To  facilitate \npostevaluation  of  the  Project,  SHEC  will  also  furnish  to  ADB,  within  3  months  of  project \ncompletion,  a  project  completion  report  providing  details  regarding  physical  implementation, \nproject  costs,  recruitment  and  performance  of  consultants,  procurement  of  goods  and  civil \nworks,  performance  of  suppliers  and  contractors,  resettlement  compliance,  social  and \nenvironmental  impacts,  project  financial  and  economic  performance,  and  other  details  as \nrequested  by  ADB.  In  addition,  SHEC  will  provide  to  ADB  reports  on  contract  management \n\n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2001. Loan Disbursement Handbook . Manila. \n10  The Project was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities in April 2002. \n11  SCD will also maintain separate accounts to the extent related to the Project. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11\n\nprocedures  (including  approval  of  variation  orders  and  progress  payment  certificates),  traffic \nforecasts,  proposed  toll  increases,  benefit  monitoring,  and  other  activities  within  the  required \ntime as stipulated in the Loan and Project Agreements. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n34. \nADB has agreed to a set of indicators for monitoring and evaluating the performance of \nthe Project in relation to its goals and objectives has been concurred with SCD/SHEC. Prior to \nproject implementation, SHEC will establish the necessary baseline values for impact indicators. \nThese  values  will  be  updated  during  project  implementation.  Specific  indicators  will  be \nmeasured,  with  the  necessary  frequency,  during  project  construction.  Comments  and  findings \nregarding  project  impact  will  be  incorporated  in  every  second  ADB  quarterly  report.  Indicators \nfor  project  evaluation  will  be  measured  at  project  completion  and  annually  for  3  years  after \ncompletion.  Where  relevant,  indicators  will  be  disaggregated  by  gender.  To  facilitate \nassessment  of  the  socioeconomic  impact  of  the  Project,  TOR  for  services  of  an  international \nconsultant  and  local  institute/consultants  to  monitor  and  evaluate  all  relevant  project  impacts \nhave  been  included  in  the  scope  of  consulting  services  to  be  provided  under  the  Project. \nSocioeconomic effects and poverty reduction impacts of the Project will be demonstrated during \nand  after  implementation  as  shown  in  the  PPMS  given  in  Appendix  10  and  reported  to  ADB. \nThe  proposed  indicators  for  monitoring  economic,  poverty,  and  socioeconomic  impacts  of  the \nProject  will  be  as  per  the  following  10  criteria:  (i) major  economic  indicators,  (ii) major  poverty \nindicators, (iii) access to infrastructure, (iv) access to health and education, (v) crop production, \n(vi) per capita cash income, (vii) nonfarm economic activities, (viii) living expenses, (ix) housing \nconditions,  and  (x) major  productive  assets.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  of  resettlement  will  be \nconducted independently by a qualified external organization and SHEC has agreed to provide \nthe external monitor with all grievance redress records for verification. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n10. \n\nAnticorruption Measures \n\n \nADB and SCD/SHEC will carry out a midterm review of the Project after a year of project \n35. \nconstruction commencement or at another time agreed by ADB and SCD/SHEC. It will focus on \nall  aspects  that  may  have  an  impact  on  the  performance  of  the  Project  and  its  continuing \nviability.  The  review  will  (i) examine  the  progress  in  implementing  subsector  reforms,  policy \ndevelopment,  progress  in  resettlement  and  rehabilitation,  and  compliance  with  assurances  in \nthe  Loan  Agreement;  and  (ii) consider  complementary  activities  to  enhance  the  poverty \nreduction impact during operation.  \n \n \n \n36. \nDuring  project  processing,  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  was  explained  to  central, \nprovincial,  and  local  government  officials.  Attention  was  drawn  to  the  section  on  fraud  and \ncorruption that was added to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. ADB\u2019s program for the PRC includes assistance that will improve governance and \nprovide incentives to reduce the incidence of corruption in  the longer term. SCD has taken the \nfollowing  initiatives  to  prevent  corruption:  (i) officials  from  the  provincial  discipline  unit  and \nsupervision  department  will  attend  activities  such  as  bidding,  construction,  and  operations; \n(ii) establishment  of  a  supervisory  committee  to  prevent  interference  in  the  due  processes; \n(iii) establishment  of  a  two-contract system, such as the winner of a civil works contract must \nalso sign an anticorruption contract with the employer; (iv) regular meetings between SCD and \nthe  provincial  prosecutor\u2019s  office  to  share  information  and  discuss  corrupt  practices;  and \n(v) midyear and end-of-year inspections of contractors to ensure that procedures related to fund \nwithdrawals and settlements are followed. \n \n\n\f12\n\n \n\n \n\n11. \n\nCapacity Building and Human Resources Development \n\n \n \nTo cope with its increased expressway construction and management activities, SHEC \n37. \nneeds  to  develop  a  corporate  strategy  and  outline  its  managerial,  staffing,  and  investment \nrequirements.  A  human  resources  development  plan  will  be  drawn  up  with  the  help  of  the \ninternational and domestic consultants. One element of the plan will be an international training \nprogram financed under the loan. It will cover expressway operations, commercial development \nof  expressways  and  business  planning,  expressway  maintenance,  road  safety,  vehicle \nemissions,  project  management,  highway  development  planning,  monitoring  and  evaluation, \nenvironmental  management,  bridge  and  tunnel  design,  traffic  engineering,  toll  management, \nand  pavement  design.  SHEC  staff  will  undertake  about  45  person-months  of  international \ntraining.  With  the  assistance  of  the  consultants,  SHEC  will  prepare,  for  ADB\u2019s  concurrence,  a \nprogram of training activities, their location, and a list of candidates. Findings from the training \nwill be disseminated in Shanxi Province through an appropriate institute. \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n \nA. \n \n\nFinancial Benefits \n\n1. \n\nTraffic Forecast \n\n \n38. \nAverage  annual  growth  for  road  passenger  traffic  and  road  freight  traffic  in  Shanxi \nProvince was 8.7% and 8.9%, respectively, in the 1990\u20132000 period. The national growth  rates \nwere  9.7%  and  5.9%,  respectively,  over  the  same  period  (Appendix  11).  There  are  both \nrailroads and highways in the project area, but no waterway or civil aviation transport services. \nThere are three national highways and 16 provincial highways, as well as a number of county \nand  village  roads  in  the  project  area.  National  highway  G108  is  the  only  existing  road  linking \nHouma  and  Yumenkou  in  the  project  area  and  runs  parallel  to  the  proposed  expressway.  In \n1998, the traffic volume on G108 amounted to 11,050 vehicles per day, exceeding the design \ncapacity  of  10,000  vehicles  per  day.  The  road  is  overloaded,  with  a  congestion  index  of  1.39. \nWithout  the  Project,  traffic  volumes  on  G108  would  reach  about  14,047  vehicles  per  day  in \n2007.  A  conservative  annual  2.7%  growth  rate  was  used  to  estimate  the  traffic  volume  from \n1999  to  2007,  instead  of  the  8.7%  provincial  annual  average  growth  rate  for  last  10  years \n(Supplementary Appendix L). \n \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return \n\n \nThrough an origins and destinations (O-D) survey,12 future traffic volumes for the next 20 \n39. \nyears were projected based on four factors: (i) traffic trends due to economic development and \nthe  Yellow  River  Bridge  construction,  (ii) diverted  traffic  from  the  existing  national  highway \nG108,  (iii) a  shift  from  the  railroads,  and  (iv) induced  traffic  created  by  better  transportation \nconditions. Projected average traffic volumes between Houma  and Yumenkou and crossing the \nYellow  River  from  2007  to  2026,  were  estimated  by  the  Design  Institute  (Appendix  12). \nConservatively,  annual  volume  growth  rates  of  6.3%  per  annum  for  2007\u20132015  and  4.1%  for \n2016\u20132026 were assumed. \n \n40. \nThe financial performance of the project expressway was projected taking into account \nthe  anticipated  traffic,  the  expected  operating  costs,  and  the  proposed  toll  rates.13 Based on \nfinancial  projections,  the  working  ratio  is  expected  to  be  below  12%  over  the  project  life. The \n\n                                                 \n12  Conducted in 1998 at 16 locations in the project area. \n13 The opening toll rates per vehicle-kilometer are: CNY0.3 for cars, CNY0.6 for buses, CNY1.0 for trailer trucks, and \nCNY 1.2 for container trucks. These rates will be reviewed every 5 years and adjusted as necessary. The Yellow \nRiver Bridge opening toll rates are: CNY5.0 for cars, and CNY21.0 for large trucks.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13\n\nEconomic Benefits  \n\ndebt service coverage ratio of more than 1.2 is achievable from the first year of full operation. \nThe debt-to-equity ratio will be below 65:35 over the entire project life. SHEC is expected to be \nfinancially  autonomous.  Projections  based  on  currently  available  information  and  investment \nplans show that the expressway portfolios will be financially sound. The financial internal rate of \nreturn  (FIRR)  for  the  project  expressway  is  estimated  at  7.6%  (Appendix  13),  which  is \nacceptable  as  it  exceeds  the  estimated  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  of  3.7% \n(Supplementary Appendix M). Sensitivity analysis shows that the Project will be able to meet all \nits financial obligations, and that the FIRR will stay above the estimated weighted average cost \nof  capital  under  various  adverse  scenarios;  6.0%,  a  20%  increase  in  the  project  cost;  5.6%,  a \n20% decrease in the toll revenue; 7.5%, a 30% increase in O&M costs; and 7.0%, a one-year \nimplementation delay. A devaluation of the yuan by 30% would reduce the FIRR to 6.4%.  \n \nB. \n \n41.   An economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated based on a comparison of the \nwith-  and  without-project  situations.  The  economic  costs  of  the  project  roads  include  the \nresource costs for construction, operation and maintenance (O&M), resettlement, and the value \nof agricultural production from land lost permanently. Allowance has been made for the costs of \nequipment replacement, road maintenance, and minor improvements to the network without the \nProject. The economic benefits generated by the project roads include (i) vehicle operating cost \n(VOC) and time savings for those who remain on their original routes, (ii) VOC and time savings \nfor  those  who  choose  to  pay  the  toll  and  divert  to  the  new  road,  (iii) VOC  savings  on  the \nimproved local road network, (iv) benefits from generated traffic, (v) savings from the reduction \nof  direct  and  indirect  costs  of  accidents,  (vi) working  capital  savings  to  freight  in  transit,  and \n(vii) resource cost savings arising from diversions from rail to road. Environmental benefits will \ncome  from  avoided  vehicular  emissions  as  a  result  of  the  reduced  level  of  congestion  on \nnational  highway  G108.  However,  these  benefits  were  not  included  in  the  analysis  due  to \ndifficulties  in  quantification.  Economic  costs  and  benefits  have  been  valued  in  2002  economic \nprices.  Results  are  summarized  in  Appendix  14  and  details  are  given  in  Supplementary \nAppendix N. \n \n42.  \nThe EIRR for the Project is 16.2%, indicating that the Project is economically viable. The \nEIRRs  of  the  expressway  and  the  local  roads  component  are  16.0%  and  21.6%,  respectively. \nResults  of  sensitivity  analysis  confirm  the  robustness  of  the  Project's  economic  viability. \nChanges  in  the  key  variables,  such  as  a  20%  reduction  in  VOC  savings  and  growth  rate  of \nnormal  traffic  and  a  20%  increase  in  costs,  do  not  significantly  impact  the  economic  viability. \nThe capital cost would have to increase by about 48% over the base estimate for the EIRR to \nfall  below  12%.  The  benefit  level  would  have  to  decrease  by  more  than  32%  to  achieve  the \nsame effect. Given previous experience in the PRC, variations of such magnitude are unlikely. \n \nC. \n \n \n \n43. \nThe social and poverty reduction impacts of the Project are summarized in Appendix 15. \nThe  social  analysis  indicates  that  the  largest  beneficiary  group  of  the  Project  will  be  road \nusers\u2014drivers,  passengers,  freight  and  bus  operators,  local  factories,  and  long-distance \ntraders.  Many  farmers,  particularly  those  located  in  the  local  roads  component  area,  will  also \nbenefit  from  the  Project.  Those  located  near  the  expressway  interchanges  will  also  be  in  a \nposition to increase agricultural and other incomes through improved access to markets, more \ncompetitive  prices  for  their  products,  and  cheaper  transport  costs.  Local  people  served  by  the \nProject  will  experience  improved  access  to  education,  health  facilities,  other  social  services \nsuch as increased cultural activities, and interaction with the rest of the world. SCD/SHEC will \nengage an international monitoring specialist through a firm as well as domestic consultants to \n\nSocial and Poverty Reduction Impacts \n\nProject Beneficiaries \n\n1.  \n\n\f14\n\n \n\n \n\nmonitor  project  effects  and  to  assess  changes  in  socioeconomic  conditions  in  poor  areas. \nSocioeconomic data will be collected and analyzed according to the indicators suggested in the \nPPMS. \n \n\n2. \n\nImpact on Women and Minorities \n\n \n44.  Women participate fully in the rural economy and frequently engage in rural enterprises \nand small trade. Although women are underrepresented as drivers, long-distance traders, and in \nthe management of enterprises, the impacts on farmers and enterprise workers apply equally to \nwomen.  The  local  roads  component  will  assist  women  in  expanding  production  of  vegetables, \nfruits, animal husbandry, and small-scale retail activities, as well as in improving agriculture in \ngeneral.  Although  women\u2019s  role  in  construction  works  is  estimated  to  account  for  only  15%  of \nthe overall labor employment, women will be given equal opportunities and pay for construction \nand  operational  jobs  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  Policy  on  Gender  and  Development  and \nADB\u2019s  Gender  Action  Plan  2000\u20132003.  The  Project  will  also  include  specific  action  for \n(i) construction  camp  and  itinerant  worker  health  issues,  (ii) women\u2019s  representation in public \nconsultations,  and  (iii) project  performance  monitoring  systems  using  gender-differentiated \nsocioeconomic  data.  The  only  minority  population  living  in  the  project  area  consists  of  Hui \nnationals  (less  than  0.2%  of  the  total  population).  They  live  mostly  in  the  urban  areas  of \nYuncheng  Prefecture.  No  adverse  impacts  from  the  construction  of  the  expressway  are \nforeseen. Instead, they will benefit equally from the new expressway. \n \n\n3. \n\nPoverty Reduction Impacts \n\n \n45. \nThe impact of transport infrastructure investments on poverty reduction is demonstrated \nby  recent  studies  using  an  econometric  model  that  examined  the  effectiveness  of  government \nexpenditure  in  various  sectors  in  contributing  to  growth  and  poverty  reduction  in  the  PRC  and \nIndonesia.14 The studies concluded that, compared to other sectors, such as irrigation, soil and \nwater, power, education, and health, government expenditure on roads has the largest impact \non  poverty  reduction,  productivity,  and  growth.  Infrastructure  is  a  precondition  for  poverty \nreduction.  The  research  report  on  the  PRC  also  suggests  that,  similar  to  education,  the  large \nimpact of rural infrastructure on poverty comes mainly from improved employment opportunities \n(in addition to the impact on agricultural growth).  Labor is the major resource of the poor. To be \nable  to  capitalize  on  their  major  asset,  the  poor  need  to  have  access  to  jobs  and  to  be  able  to \ntransport  the  goods  that  they  produce  to  markets.  Roads  for  poor  rural  areas  lower  transport \ncosts,  reduce  the  cost  of  inputs,  improve  access  to  services  and  jobs,  and  therefore  improve \nfarming practices; they also provide better access to health and education.  \n  \n46. \nOf  Shanxi  province\u2019s  85  counties,  35  are  classified  as  poverty  counties.  Poverty \nincidence  in  rural  Shanxi  was  reported  at  7.5%  and  a  draft  ADB  report  (2001)  quotes  urban \npoverty in Shanxi at 7.2% using income distribution data. Poverty reduction considerations have \nbeen an integral part of project design. The Project includes measures to extend socioeconomic \nbenefits  to  the  poor,  in  particular  the  local  road  program.  The  data  show  that  approximately \n48,40015  poor  people  will  directly  benefit  from  the  Project,  accounting  for  4.8%  of  the  total \npopulation (1 million) in the project area. The poverty incidence in the project area is relatively \nlow. In the PRC, about 12% of the population live below CNY1,000 annual per capita income. \nHowever, a high percentage of people have an average income just above the poverty line and \nare vulnerable. Based on an income distribution analysis, it was observed that about additional \n                                                 \n14  S.  Fan,  L.  Zhang,  and  X.  Zhang. 2000.

Washington, DC. \n\n15  i.e., those with CNY1,000 of rural and CNY3,000 of urban per capita annual incomes .  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15\n\n6% (59,225) of the total population of the project area are earning annual incomes of between \nCNY1,001 to CNY1,300 in rural areas and CNY3,001 to CNY3,300 in urban areas.  The poverty \nimpact assessment shows that villages that now have poor road access in the project area will \nhave  higher  incomes  resulting  from  improved  road  accessibility  because  of  increased \nagricultural production and other economic activities. \n \n47. \nTo  enhance  the  poverty  reduction  impact  of  the  Project,  SPG  agreed  that  (i) all roads \nfinanced under the Project, i.e., the expressway and the local roads, would utilize wage labor, \nwages being set at market rates that currently correspond to approximately CNY20 per day for \nunskilled  labor;  and  (ii) construction  companies  involved  in  civil  works  for  the  expressway  and \nbridges  component,  and  the  local  roads  component  will  commit  to  hiring  the  highest  possible \nshare of the labor force from poor villages. The construction of  the expressway/the bridge and \nthe upgrading of the local road will require about 4,680 person-years and 520 person-years of \nunskilled laborers, respectively. If 50% of unskilled jobs are given to the poor beneficiaries in the \nproject area who are below the provincial poverty line, total additional incomes of poor laborers \nto  be  generated  through  the  Project  are  estimated  at  about  CNY17 million  for  the \nexpressway/bridge  construction  and  CNY2  million  for  the  local  roads  component.  In  addition, \nduring the operational phase, up to 100 poor workers will be employed for simple maintenance \nworks; their living conditions will improve. The wages from employment during construction and \noperation  of  the  Project  will  increase  family  incomes,  raise  living  standards,  and  thus reduce \npoverty. The impact of the Project on poverty reduction will be evaluated during and after project \nimplementation.  \n \n4. \n\nResettlement Impacts  \n\n \nThe  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  in  December  2001  based  on  the  feasibility  study \n48. \nand ADB approved it in May 2002. The resettlement plan includes the outcomes of the impact \nsurvey  and  the  socioeconomic  survey  that  were  jointly  conducted  by  the  Second  Highway \nDesign and Research Institute under MOC, SCD, and the Shaanxi Academy of Social Sciences \nas  well  as  city  and  county  government  officials.  The  socioeconomic  survey  sampled  seven \nvillages and 175 households in the three counties in the project area. These represent 14% of \naffected villages and 18% of affected households. Findings from the impact survey estimate that \nthe Project will acquire about 411 hectares (ha) of land and temporarily affect 127 ha. A total of \n850  households  (3,568  people)  will  lose  land  permanently;  this  impact  will  be  mitigated  by \nredistribution  of  land  in  the  affected  villages  and  income  rehabilitation  measures.  About  54 \nhouseholds  will  have  their  houses  affected;  of  them,  20  households  will  need  to  be  relocated. \nAbout  4,000  square  meters  of  structures,  including  houses,  will  be  demolished  and  one \nenterprise  in  Xinjiang  County  will  lose  its  structure.  Measures  have  been  proposed  to \nrehabilitate  the  economy  and  the  living  standards  of  affected  persons.  For  route  selection, \ncriteria  to  minimize  resettlement  impacts  were  established,  including  avoidance  of  highly \npopulated  areas, irrigation facilities, townships with low per capita farmland, and historic sites. \nCompensation rates for affected houses, farmland, and other assets were based on the Shanxi \nRegulations for Land Administration (2001). The resettlement budget was established at about \n$31.2 million equivalent. SCD/SHEC agreed that it would fund the resettlement costs according \nto the standards set out in the resettlement plan. \n \n49. \nInternal  monitoring  will  be  conducted  by  SHEC  and  resettlement  offices  of  Yuncheng \ncity,  county,  and  township  governments.  SHEC  will  be  responsible  for  submitting  quarterly \nprogress  reports  to  ADB.  A  regular  monitoring  and  reporting  system  will  be  established  to \nensure  that  key  resettlement  activities  are  implemented  on  time  and  adequately.  SHEC  will \nengage  an  external  agency  acceptable  to  ADB  for  monitoring  resettlement  plan  activities.  The \nexternal  monitor  will  conduct  baseline  surveys,  investigate  resettlement  implementation \nprogress  and  prepare  monitoring  and  evaluation  reports  for  submission  to  SHEC  and  ADB. \nThese reports will be submitted every 6 months during resettlement plan implementation. After \n\n\f16\n\n \n\n \n\nthe  completion  of  resettlement,  two  annual  investigations  will  be  carried  out  by  the  external \nmonitor to assess whether rehabilitation measures have fully restored incomes and livelihoods \nof all affected people. The reports of these annual investigations will be prepared by the external \nmonitor and submitted to SHEC and ADB. \n \n\n5. \n\nParticipatory Activities \n\n \n50. \nDuring  the  preparation  of  the  Project,  SHEC  undertook  several  opinion  surveys, \nsocioeconomic surveys, and public meetings which raised the level of awareness, gained local \nsupport,  and  enabled  stakeholders  to  voice  opinions  and  suggestions  for  project  design  and \nimplementation.  A  chronology  of  public  consultations  held  are  summarized  in  Appendix  4  with \ndetails  found  in  Supplementary  Appendix  B.  These  participatory  activities  form  the  basis  of  a \nsocial  development  action  plan  (Appendix  15)  which  shows  measures  SHEC  agrees  to \nundertake  to  ensure  negative  impacts  are  avoided  or  mitigated,  and  the  Project  benefits  are \nenhanced, especially for target groups. The participatory approach was initiated during project \ndesign  and  is  an  ongoing  activity  which  will  be  continued  during  project  implementation. \nVulnerable  segments  of  the  population  have  been  carefully  considered  in  conducting \nparticipatory  activities.  For  example,  for  the  selection  of  unskilled  labor  in  the  project  area, \nSHEC  will  identify  appropriate  team  leaders  in  poor  villages  in  the  project  area  and  provide \ntraining.  The  team  leaders  will  then  select  a  labor  team  from  poor  households  in  their  village. \nThe  village  committees  and  SHEC  will  coordinate  the  signing  of  the  contracts  between  the \ncontractors  and  the  team  leaders  from  poor  villages.  Gender  issues  were  also  given  due \nattention.  Despite  the  equal  opportunities  law  of  PRC,  the  women  are  under-represented as \ndrivers,  vehicle  operators,  long-distance  traders,  the  public  sector  and  the  management  of \nenterprises.  SHEC  has  set  targets  whereby  50%  of  the  service  related  and  20-25%  of \nmanagement related employment of the Project to be given to women. \n \nD. \n \n \n\n1. \n \n51. \nThe Project is classified as environmental category A by ADB. The environmental impact \nassessment (EIA) was prepared by the Research Institute of Highways, MOC in August 2001. \nThe  EIA  was  approved  by  the  State  Environmental  Protection  Administration  (SEPA)  on  8 \nMarch  2002.  A  summary  EIA  was  circulated  to  the  ADB  Board  on  29  May  2002.  The  EIA \nassesses  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  selected  alignment  and  prescribes  environmental \nprotection and mitigation measures, with an estimated cost of about CNY21.7 million equivalent. \nA comprehensive soil erosion control plan was approved by the Ministry of Water Resources on \n8 February 2002. The proposed Yellow River Bridge is located 2.5 km upstream of the northern \nborder and 4 km from the core zone border of the provincial reserve for wintering gray cranes. \nTo protect the cranes from any possible adverse impacts, an action plan was prepared by the \nResearch  Institute  of  Highways.  The  action  plan  includes  necessary  engineering  control \nmeasures,  monitoring,  training,  measures  for  environmental  enforcement,  and  an  enrichment \nprogram  to  reduce  disturbance  of  crane  feeding  areas.  The  action  plan  also  includes \nestablishment  of  an  environmental  management  unit  in  SHEC,  jointly  with  staff  from  the \nYuncheng Environmental Protection Bureau (YEPB) and environment consultants.  \n \n\nNatural Resources and Project Impacts \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n2. \n\nVehicle Emissions \n\n \nAir quality in most PRC cities, and in many rural areas, is poor. The major cause is the \n52. \nburning  of  coal  in  power  plants,  boilers,  district  heating  systems,  factories,  and  burning  of \nagricultural  wastes.  However,  pollution  from  vehicles  is  increasing  rapidly  and  has  drawn \nattention to particular pollutants. More details on road safety and vehicle emissions are given in \nAppendix  16.  In  some  cities,  vehicles  already  account  for  80%  of  total  carbon  monoxide \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17\n\nemission levels, 50% of nitrogen oxides, and a substantial proportion of lead. The Government \nhas  recognized  this  problem  and  the  amendments  to  the  Air  Pollution  Law  in  2000  added  a \nchapter  on  motor  vehicle  pollution.  An  ADB  TA  for  market-based  instruments  included  a  case \nstudy  in  Beijing  that  explored  use  of  vehicle  taxes,  fuel  taxes,  emission  charges,  congestion \ncharges,  and  tradable  area  licenses,  to  help  reduce  vehicle  emissions.  Under  a  regional  TA \nADB is assisting DMC governments including PRC16 in developing and implementing policies to \nreduce vehicle emissions on a regional basis. These activities including improving fuel quality, \nfinding  alternative  fuels,  regulations  on  two-  and  three-wheeled  motorized  vehicles,  vehicle \ntesting,  inspection,  and  transport  planning.  More  details  about  these  programs  are  given  in \nSupplementary Appendix O. \n \n53. \nAssistance  will  be  provided  by  SCD  and  SHEC  to  YEPB  to  cooperatively  develop  a \nprovincial vehicle emissions control plan according to the national action plan on strengthening \nvehicle inspection and maintenance, prior to expressway operations. The work related to road \nsafety  and  vehicle  emissions  control  has  been  a  policy  dialogue  issue  under  several  previous \nTAs. In 1999, advisory TAs were provided for the improvement of  air quality in Shanxi and the \nimprovement  of  traffic  safety  in  the  PRC.17  While  ADB  will  continue  its  dialogue  with  the \nGovernment  to  facilitate  the  implementation  of  the  national  action  plans  to  be  proposed  under \nthe TAs, ADB and SPG agreed to (i) develop  a coordination framework between SHEC and all \nother related agencies in Shanxi (i.e., Shanxi Public Security Department, YEPB, and SCD) to \npromote successful road safety and vehicle emissions control strategies, and (ii) implement a \nvehicle  emission  control  action  plan  with  targets.  Under  the  Project,  international  specialists \nadequately supported by domestic consultants will also be engaged in this area to assist SHEC \nand other agencies. \n \nE. \n \n54.  \nThe Project has been formulated to reduce potential technical and economic risks. The \nmain  technical  risks,  which  could  result  in  implementation  delays  and  changes  in  the  cost \nestimates, are associated with the construction of the Yellow River Bridge and 11 large bridges. \nTo  mitigate  these  risks,  consultants  have  reviewed  the  proposed  construction  methods.  The \nprequalification  of  contractors  will  focus  on  their  financial  and  technical  capability  in  handling \nsimilar works. During the construction period, monitoring and contract management information \nsystems will be set up and implemented with the assistance of the international consultants for \ntimely identification of technical problems and implementation of corrective measures. There are \nno  major  resettlement  risks;  adequate  mitigation  plans,  and  implementation  capacity  and \nmonitoring mechanisms will be put in place for resettlement. \n \n55.   Economic performance of the project implementation agency would have to deteriorate \nsubstantially  for  the  Project  to  cease  being  economically  viable.  Sensitivity  analysis  indicates \nthat  the  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  are  stable.  While  a  financial  risk  is  associated  with \nconstruction and operation of the expressway, its extent will depend on the actual construction \ncosts. To mitigate this financial risk, SHEC is consciously oriented to building up a commercial \nbusiness environment for expressway operations, and the project expressway will also receive \nsubstantial  equity  injections  from  the  central  and  provincial  governments.  As  the  Project  will \ngenerate  revenue  in  domestic  currency,  there  is  a  risk  related  to  exchange  rate  variations. \nHowever, sensitivity tests indicate that an adverse exchange rate change will have only a limited \neffect on the FIRR. \n \n56.  The  main  environmental  risks  are  associated  with  possible  (i) adverse  impacts  on  the \nYuncheng  Wetland  Nature  Reserve  and  (ii) soil erosion. Any possible adverse impacts on the \n\nProject Risks \n\n                                                 \n16 ADB. 2000. Regional TA on Action Plans for Reducing Vehicle Emissions.

Road construction will intensify the effects \nof  soil  erosion  due to vegetation removal, soil disturbance, and exposure of bare soil surface. \nAn action plan including protective measures for gray crane habitats and a comprehensive soil \nerosion control plan were developed under the guidance of the Shanxi Forestry Department and \nShanxi Nature Reserve Administrative Station. The related expenses are included in the project \ncost. \n \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n57. \nfollowing  assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government and SCD/SHEC have given the \n\n(i)  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement.  SCD  and  SHEC  will  implement  the \nresettlement plan and ensure that all land and rights-of-way required by the Project \nare made available in a timely manner  and that the provisions of the resettlement \nplan,  including  compensation  and  entitlements  for  affected  persons,  will  be \nimplemented in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations and with ADB\u2019s \nPolicy on Involuntary Resettlement. SCD and SHEC will ensure the timely provision \nof  counterpart  funds  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities  and  meet  any \nobligations in excess of the resettlement plan budget estimate and ensure that the \naffected persons will be at least as well off as they would have been in the absence \nof the Project. SCD and SHEC will ensure that (i) adequate staff and resources are \ncommitted  to  supervision  and  internal  monitoring  of  the  implementation  of  the \nresettlement plan; (ii) an independent agency is contracted to carry out monitoring \nand  evaluations,  and  forward  reports  to  ADB;  and  (iii) an  annual  audit  of \nresettlement  disbursements  and  expenditures  is  conducted.  SCD  and  SHEC  will \nupdate  the  resettlement  plan  as  necessary  and  submit  such  changes  for  ADB\u2019s \nconcurrence. SCD and SHEC will ensure that civil works contractors\u2019 specifications \ninclude  requirements  to  comply  with  the  resettlement  plan  and  with  entitlements \narising  from  permanent  and  temporary  impacts  to  affected  persons.  SCD  and \nSHEC will supervise the contractors to ensure compliance with requirements of the \nresettlement plan, law, and ADB policy. \n\n \n(ii)  Environment. SCD and SHEC will ensure that the project expressway and facilities \nare  designed,  constructed,  and  operated,  and  local  roads  are  upgraded  and \nmaintained,  in  accordance  with  national  and  local  government  environmental  law \nand  regulations,  procedures,  guidelines,  and  standards,  as  well  as  with  ADB\u2019s \nguidelines  and  procedures  on  the  environment.  SHEC  will  ensure  implementation \nof  measures  and  programs  in  the  EIA  to  minimize  and  mitigate  the  adverse \nenvironmental  impacts  arising  from  the  construction  and  operation  of  the  project \nexpressway  and  the  upgrading  and  operation  of  the  local  roads  and,  in  particular, \nwill  ensure  implementation  of  (i) the  comprehensive  soil  erosion  control  plan \napproved by the Ministry of Water Resources and SEPA and (ii) the action plan for \nthe protection of the wintering grounds of the gray crane in the Yuncheng Wetland \nNature  Reserve.  In  addition,  Shanxi  Province  will  cause  the  relevant  local \ngovernments and SHEC to implement the other measures recommended by SEPA \nin March 2002 for the protection of the birds\u2019 wintering grounds in the Reserve. The \nimplementation of such measures will be regularly reported to ADB from December \n2002  through  project  completion,  including  (i) progress  made  on  mitigation \nmeasures; (ii) monitoring data; (iii) problems encountered; (iv) enforcement actions \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19\n\ntaken;  and  (v) in  case  of  violation  of  safety  or  environmental  standards,  their \ncorrection. \n\n \n(iii)  Poverty  Reduction.  SCD  and  SHEC  will  (i) promote the contractors to maximize \nthe  employment  of  local  poor  persons  for  construction  of  the  project  expressway \nand  local  roads,  and  encourage  local  villagers  working  for  the  local  roads \ncomponent  of  the  Project  will  receive  a  salary  based  on  market  rates;  (ii) monitor \nproject  impacts  on  poverty  during  and  after  project  implementation  in  accordance \nwith selected socioeconomic indicators; and (iii) provide monitoring reports to ADB \nduring construction on a semiannual basis as part of the quarterly reports and  as \nan evaluation report 3 years after project completion. \n\n \n(iv)  Tolls. Tolls for the project expressway and the Yellow River Bridge will be set with \nregard  to  affordability  and  at  levels  sufficient  for  debt  service coverage, operation \nand  maintenance  costs,  and  depreciation  in  excess  of  debt  service.  If  an \nadjustment  of  the  toll  is  required,  SHEC  will  submit  for  ADB  concurrence  the  toll \nadjustment plan, prior to finalizing and submitting the plan to SPG for its approval.  \n\n \n(v)  Financial  Ratios.  SHEC  will  maintain  (i) a  debt-to-equity ratio of less than 65:35; \n(ii) a debt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.2 times; and (iii) a working ratio \nof not more that 12%. SCD will provide to SHEC on a timely basis all funds needed \nin addition to its internally generated revenues to meet these requirements.  \n\n \n(vi)  Corporatization  and  Corporate  Governance.  SCD  and  SHEC  will  enter  into  a \nconcession framework agreement by 31 December 2004 to define the relationship \nbetween  SCD  and  SHEC,  ensure  autonomy  of  management  and  operation  of \nSHEC,  encourage  the  establishment  of  road  facility  performance  indicators,  and \nfacilitate  future  refinancing  of  the  project  expressway.  SHEC  will  also  prepare  a \ncorporate development plan by 31 December 2004, and submit this plan to ADB for \ndiscussion, to achieve the objectives of (i) operating SHEC on a commercial basis, \n(ii) improving  its  efficiency,  and  (iii) ensuring  its  operation  in  compliance  with  its \ncharter and PRC company law.  \n\n \n(vii)  Nongovernment  Financing.

By  the \nend  of  2000,  the  PRC  transport  system  comprised  about  68,000  kilometers  (km)  of  railways, \n1.4 million km of highways, 119,300 km of inland waterways, and 1.5 million km of civil aviation \nroutes. However, the density of the PRC transport network ranks among the lowest in the region \nrelative to population or land area.2  \n \n2. \nThe  privately  owned  fleet  of  motor  vehicles  in  the  PRC  increased  more  than  20  times \nduring 1985\u20132000, from 0.3 million vehicles to 6.3 million. In 2000, the PRC vehicle fleet totaled \n15.5 million trucks, cars, and buses, and 46.5 million other motorized vehicles (special vehicles, \ntractors,  and  motorcycles).  The  total  number  of  trucks,  cars,  and  buses  increased  by  about \n1.3 million  in  2000,  with  the  share  for  trucks  dropping  to  45.0%,  down  from  66.8%  in  1990. \nDespite the rapid increase in total vehicles, the PRC has only about 1.3 vehicles (trucks, cars or \nbuses) for 100 persons, which is low relative to other countries in the Asia and Pacific region. \nUntil  the  early  1980s,  there  were  no  modern  vehicles  imported  or  joint  ventures  formed  to \nintroduce  modern  technology.  There  are  plans  to  invest  up  to  $7  billion  in  automotive \nmanufacturing  in  the  PRC  between  2000  and  2005.  The  PRC\u2019s  accession  to  the  World  Trade \nOrganization  should  increase  investment  in  automobile  production.  The  modernization  of  the \nvehicle fleet will improve vehicle safety and reduce fuel consumption and vehicle emissions.  \n \n3. \nRoad freight traffic in Shanxi Province increased from 11.5 billion ton-km to 27.0 billion \nton-km between 1990 and 2000. Road passenger traffic increased during the same period from \n5.9  billion  passenger-km  to  13.6  billion  passenger-km,  corresponding  to  an  average  annual \ngrowth  rate  of  8.9%  and  8.7%,  respectively,  compared  with  the  national  growth  rates  of  5.9% \nand 9.7%. In Shanxi, privately owned motor vehicles in 2000 totaled about 235,078. Given the \nPRC's rapid economic growth and vehicle ownership, both the public and private vehicle fleets \nare  expected  to  continue  to  grow  rapidly  in  the  coming  years.  This  will  result  in  substantial \nincreases in the volume of road traffic and mounting congestion. The high share of slow-moving \ntraffic,  mainly  tractors,  bicycles,  and  nonmotorized  agricultural  vehicles,  aggravates  road \ncongestion, and is a major cause of traffic accidents. In 2000, Shanxi had about 555,000 trucks \nand  passenger  vehicles,  equal  to  3.6%  of  the  national  fleet.  This  translates  into  1.71  vehicles \nper 100 persons in Shanxi, slightly above the national average.  \n \nB. \n \n4. \nSeveral  institutions  are  involved  in  the  road  transport  industry.  The  provincial \ncommunications  departments  (PCDs)  are  responsible  for  regulating  the  industry  through \nlicensing drivers, vehicles, and intercity bus services. Through tariff reform in trucking, there has \nbeen an increase in private operations resulting in improved transport efficiency and quality of \n                                                 \n1  Between 1990 and 2000, domestic passenger transport in all modes grew by 8.0% per annum in passenger-km. \nFreight transport in all modes grew at 5.2% per year in ton-km. Road traffic grew at 9.7% per annum for passenger \ntraffic and 5.9% per annum for freight. In 2000, road traffic accounted for 54.2% of total passenger-km, followed by \nrailways with 36.8%, civil aviation with 8.2%, and coastal and inland waterways with 0.8%. \n\nRoad Transport Institutions and Administration.  \n\n2  In  terms  of  density  per  square  kilometer  (km 2)  of  land  area,  the  PRC's  transport  network  in  2000  is  one  sixth  of \n\nIndia's network and one fifth of that of the Republic of Korea. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 5  \n\n \n\n29 \n\nRoad Subsector Revenues and Expenditures \n\nservices  from  the  increased  competition.  This  process  has  been  supported  through  an  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) technical assistance (TA).3 Road administration is decentralized. ADB \nhas supported human resources development in sector institutions under loans and TAs. \n \nC. \n \n5. \nDedicated  user  charges,  government  grants,  domestic  bank  loans  and  bonds,  and \nforeign loans and investments are used to finance expenditures in highway infrastructure in  the \nPRC. Dedicated user charges, the road maintenance fee and the vehicle maintenance fee, have \nprovided  much  of  the  financing  for  the  road  sector.  In  Shanxi,  road  maintenance  fees  and \ndomestic borrowings are major financing sources for its budget. During the Ninth Five-Year Plan \n(9FYP, 1996\u20132000), the road maintenance fee, levied on the revenue of freight and passenger \ntransport  companies  and  on  the  load  capacity  of  private  vehicles,  provided  about  26%  of  the \ntotal financing requirements of road investments, and the domestic borrowings provided about \n30%.  The  provincial  road  budgets  during  9FYP  increased  from  CNY5,615  million  in  1996  to \nCNY6,276 million in 2000. However, an increasing proportion of provincial road budgets is being \nused  to  meet  the  national  priority  for  expressway  and  highway  construction.  In  addition,  the \nproportion of funding for road maintenance has decreased from 10% in 1996 to 8% in 2000. The \nProject, however, includes not only the construction of new expressway but also the upgrading \nof local roads, so that it will help ensure balanced expenditures among different types of roads. \nRevenues  and  expenditures  in  the  road  subsector  in  Shanxi  Province  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix A. \n  \nD. \n \n6. \nIn  1998,  ADB\u2019s  Operations  Evaluation  Department  (OED)  completed  its  first  country \nassistance  program  evaluation.  The  evaluation  concluded  that  ADB\u2019s  monitoring  mechanisms \nshowed high levels of performance for ongoing transport projects and TAs.  Also in 1998, OED \ncarried out a special study on the operation and maintenance of road facilities and their impact \non  project  sustainability.4  The  study  concluded  that  maintenance  of  roads  completed  under \nADB-financed  projects  has  not  been  a  serious  problem  in  the  PRC.  An  effective  budgetary \nallocation  system  is  in  place,  and  strong  institutional  capacity  to  maintain  the  expressway \nsystem has been developed. \n \n7. \nADB's TA program in the road  subsector  has  been  generally  successful.  Some  of  the \nmore recent TAs have been instrumental in focusing the Government's attention on the need to \nexpand  its  sources  of  finance  for  highway  development;  and  on  the  institutional,  policy,  and \nregulatory issues that need to be addressed to facilitate the use of a broader set of modalities \nfor domestic and foreign resource mobilization. Specific improvements have been effected as a \nresult,  and  are  now  being  disseminated  widely  to  all  provinces.  In  January  2001,  OED \ncompleted a performance audit report on traffic safety TAs. The two road safety TAs involving \nthe PRC were rated as highly satisfactory. \n \n8.  \nAn ADB-financed study for the five administrative areas in the southwest region showed \nthat lack of high-class roads limited the provision of transport services in and out of the region, \nbetween  and  within  the  administrative  areas,  and  increased  the  cost  of  transport.

This shift in focus of ADB operations is in \nline  with  ADB\u2019s  strategic  objective  of  reducing  poverty  in  inland  provinces.  The  Government \nrecently  reaffirmed  its  policy  of  increasing  road  subsector  funding  to  implement  the  national \ntrunk  highway  system  as  a  principal  means  of  promoting  and  sustaining  economic  growth.  It \nintends  to  continue  seeking  the  assistance  of  multilateral  development  banks  for  the \nconstruction of the national trunk highway system and the western region corridors, especially \nthe sections generating revenue that can be used for debt servicing. \n \nE. \n\nRoad Subsector Policy Reform Plan \n\n \n\n9. \nADB  has  been  actively  involved  in  policy  dialogue  on  the  PRC  road  subsector  since \n1991.  The  principal  issues  addressed  include  the  poverty  reduction  impact  of  road  projects, \nhighway  design  standards  and  construction  quality,  road  safety,  vehicle  emissions,  pricing \npolicies,  commercialization  and  corporatization,  and  nongovernment  financial  resources.  The \nstatus and achievements to date were discussed and summarized in the Road Subsector Policy \nReform Plan (Supplementary Appendix A).  \n\n \nTable A5: Road Subsector Policy Reform Plan  \n \n\nInitiative \n\n \n \n1.

The Project is estimated to permanently \noccupy about 411 hectares as confirmed by the impact survey. The permanent land acquisition \nis equivalent to the loss of farmland of 3,568 people (850 households). Most of the households \nwill regain similar farmland through land redistribution. About 5,200 sqm of structures, including \n54 houses, will be affected, necessitating relocation of 20 households.  One enterprise will also \nlose its structure. \n \n2. \nLand acquisition and resettlement impacts were minimized through the following actions: \n(i) aligning  the  expressway  away  from  areas  with  high  population  densities  and  by  avoiding \nhistoric  relics;  (ii) occupying  wasteland,  waste  hills  for  alignment,  where  possible;  (iii) avoiding \nvillages  with  lower  per  capita  farmland;  (iv) reducing  the  amount  of  land  acquisition  for \ninterchanges to the extent possible; and (v) protecting water conservancy and irrigation facilities \nas far as possible.  Consultations were held with local officials to minimize resettlement effects \nduring the setting of the alignment during the feasibility study and detailed study. \n \nThe  Second  Highway  Design  and  Research  Institute  (SHDRI)  under  the  Ministry  of \n3. \nCommunications  conducted \nlocal \ninitial  socioeconomic  surveys  and \ngovernments and villagers in the project area from February 1998 to June 1999. In November\u2013\nDecember 2001, a resettlement expert group composed of staff from a local community and the \nSHDRI,  as  well  as  city  and  county  government  officials,  conducted  detailed  land  acquisition, \ncensus and socioeconomic surveys in the project influence area in conjunction with  the Shanxi \nCommunications Department (SCD). \n \n4. \nFor  people  unavoidably  affected  by  the  Project,  the  resettlement  objective  is  to  ensure \nattainment of equal or better livelihoods and living standards in line with the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC) Land Administration Law (1998) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) policy \non  involuntary  resettlement  (1995).  The  law  is  supplemented  by  the  Methods  for  Land \nManagement and Execution in Shanxi Province (2000). The Executing Agency will ensure that \nany  people  losing  land,  housing  or  other  assets  and  means  of  production  will  be  assisted  in \nrestoring  their  incomes  and  living  standards  to  at  least  the  levels  without  the  Project\u2019s \nintervention.  Assets  will  either  be  replaced  or  their  owners  compensated  at  replacement  cost. \nThe total resettlement budget is about $31.2 million equivalent (CNY258.2 million). \n \nLand  compensation  payments  are  calculated  at  eight  times  the  annual  average  output \n5. \nvalue  (AAOV) of the land over the past  3  years.  A  resettlement  subsidy  is  calculated  at  five \ntimes AAOV over the past  3  years.  Payment is made to the village commission. Young crops \nthat cannot be harvested before land acquisition are compensated at average purchasing price \nper season of the crop compensation rate. Temporarily acquired land is paid the AAOV for each \nyear  of  occupation.  Topsoil  is  stored  and  then  replaced  in  the  original  site  at  the  end  of \noccupation. The cost of restoring land to farmland will be paid by the Project; some payments \ncan be made directly to the farmers for helping to restore these lands. \n \n6. \nPeople losing houses will receive direct compensation according to the class and type of \nhouse. Compensation is based on the floor area and material, and there will be no depreciation \nof housing values, and the affected people will be allowed to salvage materials from their former \nhouses  without  deduction  from  their  compensation.  They  can  choose  to  construct  their  own \nhouse, or to request that the township or village arrange this for them. The new house is to be \nconstructed and the family relocated before the former dwelling is demolished. \n\n\f34\n\nAppendix 6 \n\nFor private enterprises, work stoppage compensation will be paid monthly based on the \n7. \nmonthly  average  net  profit  of  the  previous  6  months  of  commercial  operations.  All  costs \nassociated  with  relocation  of  the  enterprise,  transfer  costs,  and  compensation  for  affected \nassets  will  be  paid  by  the  Project.  Workers  in  these  enterprises  will  be  paid  their  full  monthly \nsalaries for the period during which commercial operations are disrupted. Full compensation will \nbe  paid  for  construction  of  a  new  commercial  site,  with  no  deductions  for  depreciation  of  the \nformer site.  \n \nAlong  the  proposed  expressway  alignment,  only  eight  of  the  38  affected  villages  have \n8. \nserious land losses\u2014more than 10% of their cultivated land. Households losing agricultural land \nwill  receive  agricultural  rehabilitation  within  the  affected  villages,  either  by  land  adjustment  to \nensure  that  village  members  still  have  sufficient  land  to  farm,  or  by  providing  compensation \nfunds.  The  village  rehabilitation  plans  may  include  crop  diversification,  animal  husbandry, \nimproved irrigation facilities, sideline enterprises, and livelihood training. \n \n9. \nThe Coordination Office of  the  Shanxi  Hou-yu Expressway Construction Company Ltd. \n(SHEC) and the coordination offices at the county level will supervise the resettlement program. \nThe  county  resettlement  offices  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  resettlement  and \ndelegating  activities  to  township  officials  and  village  committees  affected  by  the  Project.  The \ntownship  offices  will  sign  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  agreements  with  affected  villages \nand  individuals,  pay  compensation,  and  carry  out  the  daily  specific  implementation  of  land \nacquisition and resettlement.  \n \n10. \nInformation  about  the  resettlement  program  has  been  disseminated  through  public \nmedia such as newspapers, radio, public notices, and meetings at township and village levels to \npromote understanding and support from all communities in the project area. The resettlement \ninformation  booklet  has  been  distributed  to  people  in  all  affected villages.  In  addition  to  the \ninformation campaign, affected households will participate in land acquisition and resettlement \nactivities. In addition, there is a system for registering complaints by any persons affected by the \nProject. \n \n11. \nThe resettlement plan will have both internal and external monitoring. Methods for both \nare specified in the resettlement plan. A five-person resettlement unit in SHEC, in collaboration \nwith  the  county  resettlement  office,  will  do  internal  supervision  and  monitoring.  SHEC  will \nensure compliance with the regulations set out in the resettlement plan. SCD/SHEC has agreed \nto  a  set  of  supervision  milestones  with  ADB,  which  are  already  in  effect  to  ensure  timely \nimplementation  of  resettlement  activities  (see  Table  A6).  SHEC  will  engage  an  external \nmonitoring  agency  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  external  monitor  will  conduct  baseline  surveys, \ninvestigate  resettlement  implementation  progress  and  prepare  monitoring  and  evaluation \nreports  for  submission  to  SHEC  and  ADB  every  6  months  during  the  implementation  of  the \nresettlement plan. After the completion of resettlement, annual investigations will be carried for \n2 years to assess whether rehabilitation measures have fully restored incomes and livelihoods \nof  all  affected  people.  Annual  evaluation  reports  will  be  prepared  by  the  external  monitor  and \nsubmitted to SHEC and ADB. \n \n\n\fTable A6:  Resettlement Supervision Milestones \n(as of November 14, 2002) \n \n\n \nNo. \n1. \n1.1 \n1.2 \n1.3 \n2. \n2.1 \n2.2 \n2.3 \n3. \n3.1 \n3.2 \n3.3 \n4. \n5. \n5.1 \n5.2 \n6. \n6.1 \n6.2 \n\n \n\nResettlement Tasks \n\nDisclosure \nInformation booklet \nResettlement plan \nRP placed on ADB/PRC websites \nApproval of Resettlement Plan \nFinal Resettlement Plan \nApproval of Resettlement Plan \nApproval Resettlement Plan budget \nAgreements \nCounty implementation plan \nVillage compensation rates \nHousehold compensation \nDetailed Measurement Survey \nDetailed Resettlement Plans \nResettlement sites \nVillage restoration plans \nImplementation Capacity \nSet-up all RLGs \nStaff local resettlement offices \n\n6.3 \n\nTraining of staff \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \nBaseline survey \nSet-up internal supervision \nHiring external monitor (SASS) \nInternal monitoring reports \nExternal monitoring reports \nEvaluation/completion reports \nDocumentation of Consultation \nDocumentation of Grievances \nFlow of Funds/Compensation \n\n7. \n7.1 \n7.2 \n7.3 \n7.4 \n7.5 \n7.6 \n8. \n9. \n10. \n10.1  To SHEC \n\n \nTarget \n\n \n38  villages \n3 counties \n \n \n \n \n$31 million \n \n3 counties \nAs per RP \n760 AFs \n \n \n20 AFs \n38  villages \n \n4 RLGs \n15 CRO staff \n30 TRO staff \n76 VRO staff \n120 staff \n\n \n300 AFs \nAs per RP \n \nQuarterly \nSemi-annual \nTwo \nAs per RP \nAs required \nAs per RP \nAs per RP \n\nResponsible \nAgency \n\n \nSHEC \nSHEC \nSHEC & ADB \n \nSHEC \nSPG \nSCD \n \nSHEC/YRLG \nYRLG \n3 CROs \nSHEC/CROs \n \n \n3 CROs \n \nYuncheng Gov\u2019t \nYuncheng Gov\u2019t \nCROs \nTROs \nYRLG/SHEC/ \nSASS \n \nSHEC/SASS \nYRLG/SHEC \nSHEC \nSHEC \nMonitor & SHEC \nMonitor & SHEC \nSHEC/CROs \nSHEC/CRO/TRO \n \nSCD \n\n10.2  To CROs \n\nAs per RP \n\nSHEC \n\n10.3  To affected villages \n\nAs per RP \n\nCROs \n\n10.4  To affected households \n\nAs per RP \n\nCROs \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n35\n\n \nDeadline \n\n \nStatus \n\n \nComplete \n\n \n25 Apr 2002 \n19 Aug 2002  Draft disclosed \n28 Feb 2003 \n \n31 Jan 2003 \n28 Feb 2003 \nAug 2002 \n \n31 Jan 2003 \nJan 2003 \nMay 2003 \n31 Dec 2002 \n \n \n31 Jan 2003 \n \n \n30 Jun 2002 \nMar 2003 \nMay 3003 \nMay  2003 \n\nPending final RP \n \nAfter Task 4 \n \nComplete \n \n \n \n \nAfter PD approval \n \nNot required \nIn process \n \nComplete \nComplete \n10 staffed \nNot yet staffed \nIn planning \n\n \n\n \n31 Mar 2003  New survey \n31 Mar 2003 \n31 Jan 2003 \n31 Mar 2003 \nSept 2003 \n2005/6 \nongoing \nongoing \n \nJan 2003 \nSept 2003 \nMar 2003 \nDec 2003 \nApr 2003 \nDec 2003 \nApr 2003 \nDec 2003 \nDec 2003 \nApr 2003 \n\nIn process \nIn process \n1st Report due \n1st Report due \n1st Report due \nIn process \nTo be done \n \n20% of funds \n100% of funds \nCommence \n100% of funds \nCommence \n100% of funds \nCommence \n90% of funds \nFull payment \nInitial start \n\n10.5  To affected enterprises and staff \n11. \nFirst Land Acquisition \n \nAF = affected families; CRO = county resettlement office; PD = preliminary design; RLG = resettlement leading group; \nRP  =  resettlement  plan;  SASS  =  Shaanxi  Academy  of  Social  Sciences;  SCD  =  Shanxi Communication Department; \nSHEC = Shanxi Hou-Yu Expressway Co.; SPG = Shanxi Provincial Government; TRO = Township Resettlement Office; \nVRO = Village Resettlement Office; YRLG = Yuncheng City RLG. \n\nAs per RP \n \n\nCRO \nSHEC \n\n \n\n\fPROJECT IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE\n\nItem\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\nM A M J J A S O N D J F M A M J J A S O N D J F M A M J J A S O N D J F M A M J J A S O N D J F M A M J J A S O N D J F M A M\n\n3\n6\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n7\n\ni\n\n*\n\n*\n\nA.

All projections are in current \nterms. The domestic inflation rates are 2.0% for 2003, 3.0% for 2004, and 4% for 2005 onward. \nThe international inflation rate used is 2.4% throughout the projection period. \n \nB. \n \n2.  \n \n\nThe project expressway financial projections are based upon the following assumptions: \n\nFinancial Performance \n\n  is  assessed  against  the  expressway  operating  entity  at \n\nCorporate  income  tax1\n33% of net profit per year. \n\nGovernment  contriubtions  consist  of  equity  capital  contributed  by  Ministry  of \nCommunications (MOC) and Shanxi Communications Department (SCD). \n\n(iii)   Contributions  from  MOC and  SCD  will  be  CNY470  million  and  CNY808  million, \nrespectively, and will be invested during the first  4 years of construction to cover \ninitial project costs. \n\nThe toll rates expected to be levied to the project expressway are in 2002 prices \nand  based  upon  the  traffic  forecast  estimated  by  SCD  for  various  types  of \nvehicles  (Table  A9.1).  Proposed  future  tolls  are  based  on  a  nominal  annual \nincrease  of  10%  until  2010,  5%  until  2015  and  no  increase  after  2015. Future \ntolls  will  be  adjusted  in  2010  and  2015  for  the  expressway  and  in  2015  for  the \nbridge. Traffic volumes were forecast to increase by 6.3% per year during 2007\u2013\n2015 and 4.1% per year during 2016\u20132026. \n\n(i)  \n\n(ii)  \n\n \n(iv) \n\nTable A9.1: Projected Toll Rates for Expressway and Bridge \n(CNY per vehicle km) \n \nExpressway \n\n \nYellow River Bridge \nVehicle Type \n2007\u20132009  2010\u20132014  2015\u20132026  2007\u20132014  2015\u20132026 \nCar and Van \n0.50 \nBus \n0.90 \nSmall Truck \n0.50 \nMedium  Truck \n0.90 \nLarge  Truck \n1.20 \nTrailer  Truck \n1.40 \nContainer  Truck  \n1.60 \n0.84 \nWeighted Average \nSource: Price Control Bureau of the Shanxi Planning Committee. \n\n7.00 \n14.00 \n7.00 \n14.00 \n21.00 \n21.00 \n21.00 \n12.82 \n\n5.00 \n10.00 \n5.00 \n10.00 \n15.00 \n15.00 \n15.00 \n9.16 \n\n0.40 \n0.75 \n0.40 \n0.75 \n1.05 \n1.20 \n1.40 \n0.70 \n\n0.30 \n0.60 \n0.30 \n0.60 \n0.90 \n1.00 \n1.20 \n0.56 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe  toll  analysis  was  based  on  detailed  traffic  forecast  and  projected  toll  rates. \nAs shown in Table A9.1, the projected expressway toll rate is at CNY0.3 ($0.035) \n\n \n1  Business tax was abolished, effective 1 January 2001. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f40\n\nAppendix 9 \n\nper  passenger  car  kilometer  and  CNY5.0  ($0.6)  for  the  Yellow  River  Bridge. \nThese rates will increase up to CNY0.5 ($0.06) and CNY7.0 ($0.85) in 2015 for \nthe  road  and  the  Bridge,  respectively.  The  expressway  toll  rates  are  within  the \nrange  of  toll  rate  prevailing  in  the  region  ($0.03-0.08)  per  car  kilometer.  The \nproposed toll rates are such that toll revenues cover O&M costs, debt servicing \nand depreciation in excess of debt servicing. The proposed  toll rate is similar to \nthat used in similar ADB-financed projects. \n\nThe  operation  and  maintenance  costs,  including  routine  maintenance,  are \nCNY10.5 million per year. The operation costs are based upon the employment \nof  350  personnel  to  operate  four  interchange  tolling  station,  bridge  toll  station, \nand a service area. Each of these facilities requires 50 persons. Average wages \nand welfare costs are estimated at CNY20,000 per year in mid-2002 prices. The \nmaintenance costs have been estimated on the basis of a unit rate of CNY54,000 \nper year per kilometer at 2002 prices. In addition, the expressway is scheduled to \nbe paved after 15 years of operation at a cost of CNY2.2 million per km in current \nprices.  Operation  costs  will  increase  in  line  with  traffic  growth  and  domestic \ninflation. Maintenance costs will increase in line with domestic inflation. \n \nThe loan repayments will begin in 2007. The interest rate charged on the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) loan was estimated at 5.6% (based on the six-month \nLIBOR rate in US dollars in June 2002 and the five-year swap cost for variable to \nfixed  interest  rate)  and  the  interest  rate  on  the  domestic  loan  is  6.21%.  The \ncommitment fee of 0.75% per year and the 1.0% front-end fee for the ADB loan \nare also included. \n\n \n(v)  \n\n  \n(vi)  \n\nSummary of Financial Statements \n\n \nC. \n \nThe  tentative  financial  projections  (Table  A9.2)  indicate  that  the  expected  revenues  at \n3.  \nthe rates proposed are sufficient to cover the operation costs and debt repayments on the  ADB \nand domestic loans. The debt-to-equity ratio of much less than 65:35 from the first year of the \nexpressway construction and the decreasing  debt-to-equity  ratios  thereafter  indicate a sound \nfinancial condition for the expressway under the proposed financing plan. The return on equity \nwill  be  positive  from  the  beginning  of  operations.  This  ratio  indicates  that  the  Shanxi  Hou-yu \nExpressway Construction Company Limited, which was created to operate the expressway, can \nsustain totally commercial operations from the start of the operating year 2007, if SCD decides \nto diversify the ownership of expressway operations in the future. \n \n\n \n \n\n\fINCOME STATEMENT\nOperating Revenues\nBusiness Taxa\n\n   Net Operating

forecasts  were  carried out  in  1999  along  with  the  feasibility  studies  of  the \n1. \nProject. Additional traffic surveys were carried out and the data were updated in August 2000. The \nfeasibility study team once again updated the data in January 2002. The traffic forecast, including \ntraffic  counts  and  an  origin-destination  (O-D)  survey  cover  the  project  influence  area\u2014Hejin \nCounty, Jishan County, Xinjiang County, and the surrounding 12 counties and cities. \n \nB. \n \n\nExisting Traffic Conditions \n\n1. \n\nRailway Network \n\n \n2. \nThere  are  both  railway  and  highway  transportation  in  the  project  area,  but  no  waterway \nand civil aviation transport services are available. Two railroads are currently operating: the South \nTong-Pu Railroad and the Hou-Xi Railroad. The South Tong-Pu Railroad, running southward from \nYuci to Fengningdu, passes by Houma, while the Hou-Xi railroad, running from Houma to Xian  in \nShaanxi province, is parallel  all its length to the proposed expressway. In 1996, the passengers \non  South  Tong-Pu  railroad  amounted  to  7.39  million  people,  and  freight  35.09  million  tons.  For \nHou-Xi Railroad, the numbers were 2.19 million people and 8.15 million tons, respectively. \n \n\n2. \n\nRoadway Network \n\n \nThere are  three  national  highways  and  16  provincial  highways,  as  well  as  a  number  of \n3. \ncounty  and  village  roads  in  the  project  area.  In  1998,  the  area  had  a  total  road  mileage  of \n15,960 kilometers  (km),  with  a  road  density  of  44.2  km  of  road  per  100  square  (sq)  km,  and  a \nvehicle  ownership  of  83,000  vehicles.  From  1985  through  1998,  the  annual  growth  rate  for \npassenger and freight traffic in this area  were, on average, 9.95% and 11.03%, respectively. The \nmajor roads related to the project influence area include national highway G108 (Huozhou City to \nHancheng),  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  national  highway  G209  (Shixian  to  Pinglu),  provincial \nhighways S235 (Houma to Fenglingdu), S236 (Houma to Anyi), and S331 (Quwo to Huixian). The \nnational  highway  G108  is  the  only  existing  road  linking  Houma  and  Yumenkou  in  the  project \ninfluence area and runs parallel to the proposed expressway. Six of the traffic count stations on \nG108 were located between Houma and Yumenkou (Table A12.1).  \n \n\nTable A12.1: Traffic Volume of G108 between Houma and Yumenkou (1998) \n(vehicles/day) \n \n\nTraffic Count Station \nMotor Vehiclesa \nCongestion  Index \na  Weighted average of traffic volume without tractors and motorcycles. \n\n \nHouma 1\n17,524 \n2.11 \n\n \nHouma 2\n13,788 \n1.70 \n\n \nXinjiang\n9,572 \n1.29 \n\n \nJishan 1\n7,586 \n0.91 \n\n \nJishan 2 \n7,298 \n0.86 \n\n \nHejin \n10,530 \n1.43 \n\nAnnual \nAverage\n11,050 \n1.39 \n\n \n4. \nAs shown by the 1998 data of these stations, the annual average traffic volume on G108 \nbetween Houma and Yumenkou amounted to a mixed traffic volume of 11,050 vehicles per day, \nexceeding  the  design  capacity  of  10,000  vehicles  per  day.  The  road  was  overloaded,  with  a \ncongestion index of 1.39. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 12  \n\n47\n\nThere  are  28,307  vehicles  actually  recorded  during  the  O-D  survey,  including  16,336 \n5. \nfreight vehicles (57.7%) and 11,971 passenger vehicles (42.3%), as shown in Table A12.2. The \nmedium trucks and trailer trucks had the biggest share in freight movement, while passenger cars \naccounted for higher percentage than buses. \n \n\nTable A12.2: Vehicle Types in Project Area \n \n\nVehicle Type \n\n  Bus \n  Passenger Car \n\n  Light  Truck \n\n  Heavy  Truck \n\n  Medium  Truck \n\n  Trailer  Truck \n\n  Container  Truck \n\n  All Motor Vehicles \n\nNumber \n\n4,729 \n7,242 \n\n3,561 \n\n2,185 \n\n6,712 \n\n3,667 \n\n211 \n\n28,307 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n% \n\n16.7 \n25.6 \n\n12.6 \n\n7.7 \n\n23.7 \n\n12.95 \n\n0.75 \n\n100.00 \n\n \n6. \n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe results of the O-D survey show that: \n\nThe  purpose  of  the  passenger  movement  was  mostly  business  trips,  tourist  trips \naccounted for only 18% of the total. \n\nIn  freight  movement,  coal  freight  accounted  for  the  biggest  share (60.7%),  while \nsteel  and  nonferrous  metal  products  ranked  second  (6.4%).  Freight  transport  is \nmostly  long-haul  and  medium-haul.  Hazardous  materials  like  petroleum  products \n(2.0%),  fertilizers  and  pesticides  (1.6%)  were  relatively  insignificant.  For  more \ndetails on the O-D survey, please refer to Supplementary Appendix L.  \n\nTraffic Forecast \n\n \nC. \n \nFuture  traffic  demands  for  the  next  20  years,  as  shown  in  Table  A12.3,  were  projected \n7. \nbased  on  four  components:  traffic  trend,  diverted  traffic,  shift  from  railroad,  and  induced  traffic. \nVolume growth 6.3% per annum for 2007\u20132015 and 4.1% for 2016\u20132026 were assumed as per \nthe Feasibility Study . \n \n\n1. \n\nTraffic Trends \n\n \n8. \nTraffic  growth  includes  traffic  of  passenger  vehicles,  buses,  and  cargo  trucks  generated \nwithin the project area. The forecasts were performed based on an aggregate highway model of \nthe road network using the traditional \u201cfour-step\u201d traffic forecasting process: \n \n\n(i) \n\nSocioeconomic  development. As a first step, three economic growth scenarios \nwere  established  (low,  medium,  and  high)  for  the  project  area,  using  gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP)  and  gross  industrial  and  agricultural  output  data.  The \nmedium scenario was used for traffic forecasts.  \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\nTrip generation.

This  is  the  process  by  which  the  trips  generated  are  linked \nand a TAZ trip table is created showing the trip interchanges between every pair of \nTAZs. \n\nTraffic assignment. To assign the trips from the trip table to the roadway network, \none  particular  route  of  travel  through  the  network  from  various  TAZs   is  selected. \nThe  process  takes  account  of  drivers\u2019  reactions  to  changes  in  vehicle  operating \ncosts (VOCs), travel time, toll charges, and other factors. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 12  \n\n49\n\n2. \n\nDiverted Traffic \n\n \n9. \nWith  the  construction  of  the  proposed  expressway,  it  is  anticipated  that  a  significant \nvolume  of  the  traffic  currently  using  the  G108  highway,  which  is  increasingly  overloaded, would \nuse the expressway instead. \n \n\n3. \n\nShift from Railroad \n\n \nThe  Hou-Xi  Railroad  runs  parallel  to  the  proposed  expressway  and  has  a  freight \n10. \ntransport  capacity  of  18  million  tons  per  year.  It  carries  predominantly  long-distance,  large-\nvolume,  bulky,  and  heavy  freight  like  coal  and  steel  products,  with  only  a  small  number  of \npassenger movements. No major freight transport is anticipated to shift from the railroad to the \nproposed expressway, because that would be economically infeasible.  However, it is projected \nthat the expressway will attract quite a few of the railroad\u2019s passenger movements by virtue of \nits shorter travel time, convenience, and flexibility. The passenger trains of this area operate at \nan  average  speed  of  49\u201351  km/hour,  far  slower  than  the  speed  of  highway  vehicles.  The \nforecast  for  the  modal  shift  was  conducted  primarily  using  travel  time  and  cost  difference \nbetween highway and railroad in the same O-D pairs within the project area. \n \n\n4. \n\nInduced Traffic \n\n \n11. \nThe  induced  traffic  takes  into  account  potential  traffic  growth  created  by  the  changes  in \neconomic and industry structure of the region as a result of the construction of the expressway. \nFor example, new industries may be established in the project corridor. Traffic growth may also be \ninduced by better transportation conditions (lower costs, shorter travel time, etc.) provided by the \nexpressway. \n \n\n5. \n\nTraffic Volumes under Without-Project Conditions \n\n \n12. \nThe  traffic  volumes  on  G108  were  projected  under  without-project  conditions  for  three \nscenarios (high, medium, and low). Table A12.4 below presents the medium case. G108, which is \nalready operating beyond the design capacity, is getting more and more seriously overloaded with \ntime.  The  road  passes  through  many  densely  populated  commercial  areas,  townships  and \nvillages,  and  small  industrial  enterprises  without  access  control,  with  many  buildings,  vehicle \nservice and fueling stations, and even schools are located  adjacent to the roadway. As a result, \nserious congestion and traffic accidents have long been a major problem in the area.  The Project \nis essential to solve the problem. \n \n\nTable A12.4: Projected Traffic Volumes Without the Project \n(vehicles/day) \n \n\n \nRoad Segment \n \nHouma-Xinjiang \n\nXinjiang-Jishan \n\nJishan-Hejin \n\nHejin-Yumenkou \n\nWeighted Average \n \n\nLength \n(km) \n \n13 \n\n28 \n\n28 \n\n18 \n\n86 \n\n \n2007 \n \n21,487 \n\n23,409 \n\n17,648 \n\n18,104 \n\n20,170 \n\n \n2010 \n \n26,286 \n\n28,638 \n\n21,590 \n\n22,148 \n\n24,675 \n\n \n2015 \n \n34,309 \n\n37,377 \n\n28,178 \n\n28,907 \n\n32,206 \n\n \n2020 \n \n42,398 \n\n46,191 \n\n34,823 \n\n35,723 \n\n39,800 \n\n \n2026 \n \n51,334 \n\n55,926 \n\n42,162 \n\n43,252 \n\n48,188 \n\n\f50\n\n      Appendix 13 \n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n\n \n \n1.  \nThe  financial  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  for  the  project  expressway  is  based  on  estimated \nincremental  revenues  and  costs  resulting  from  its  operation.  The  major  assumptions  used  in \ncalculating the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) are as follows: \n \n\n(i)  \n\nThe  FIRR  calculation  is  in  constant  2002  prices.  The  cash  flows  and  financing \nplans are in real prices. They cover a period of 24 years, comprising 4 years of \nconstruction (2003 to 2006) and 20 years of operation (2007 to 2026). \n\nThe FIRR was calculated after corporate income tax. \n\n \n(ii)  \n \n(iii)   Capital  costs  include  all  incremental  capital  expenditures  related  to  the \nconstruction  and  equipment  of  the  project  expressway,  but  exclude  price \ncontingency provisions and interest during construction. \n\n \n(iv)   Operation and maintenance costs include all incremental costs for operating the \n\nproject expressway, but exclude depreciation provisions. \n\n \n(v)   Operating revenues were projected based on forecast traffic for the toll rates for \nall  vehicle  types  in  real  terms.  The  toll  rates  were  applied  to  the  whole  project \nexpressway  and  the  Yellow  River  Bridge  in  real  terms  during  the  period  of \nanalysis.  The  traffic  volumes  have  taken  into  account  vehicles  that  are  exempt \nfrom tolls, such as military, emergency, and public security vehicles. \n\n \n2.  \nThe  results  of  the  financial  evaluation  for  the  project  expressway  component  show  an \nFIRR in real terms of 7.6% after corporate income tax (Table A13.1). This is higher than the real \nafter tax weighted average cost of capital for the Project estimated at 3.7%. Sensitivity analysis \nof the financial return was carried out to test the effects of several scenarios on key parameters \nthat determine costs and revenues (Table A13.2). The FIRR after tax varies between 3.8% and \n9.7%, which is mostly above the after tax weighted average cost of capital. The Project is shown \nto be most sensitive to the toll revenue stream and capital costs and the delay in completion. An \nincrease  of  20%  in  capital  costs  will  decrease  the  FIRR  to  6.0%  and  a  decrease  of  20%  in \nrevenues will decrease the FIRR to 5.6%, and a  1-year delay in construction will decrease the \nFIRR  to  7.0%.  Under  the  most  adverse  scenario  (1-year  delay;  capital,  operation,  and \nmaintenance  costs   higher  by  20%;  and  revenues  lower  by  20%)  the  FIRR  would  decrease  to \n3.9%. A devaluation of the yuan by 30% would reduce the FIRR to 6.4%. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n51\n\nTable A13.1: Financial Internal Rate of Return \n(CNY million) \n  \n\n Total   \n\nCapital   Operating  Maintenance      Corporate \n\nCosts \n\nTax \n\n Revenues   Costs \n469.3 \n704.0 \n704.0 \n469.3 \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n   \n   \n   \n   \n\n  \nProject \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\nYear  Year \n2003  \n2004  \n2005  \n2006  \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n2026 \n \n  \n\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n \n  \n\n \n  \n\n220.6 \n234.5 \n249.2 \n264.9 \n281.6 \n299.4 \n318.2 \n338.3 \n359.6 \n374.4 \n389.7 \n405.7 \n422.3 \n439.6 \n457.6 \n476.4 \n495.9 \n516.3 \n537.4 \n559.5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n78.6 \n \n \n \n \n\n143.0 \n \n \n \n(733.9) \n\nCosts \n \n \n \n \n7.0 \n7.0 \n7.0 \n7.0 \n7.0 \n7.0 \n7.0 \n7.0 \n7.0 \n7.0 \n7.0 \n7.0 \n7.0 \n7.0 \n7.0 \n7.0 \n7.0 \n7.0 \n7.0 \n7.0 \n\nCase \n\n3.5 \n3.5 \n3.5 \n3.5 \n3.5 \n3.5 \n3.5 \n3.5 \n3.5 \n3.5 \n3.5 \n3.5 \n3.5 \n3.5 \n3.5 \n3.5 \n3.5 \n3.5 \n3.5 \n3.5 \n \n\nCash Flow \nAfter \nTotal \n Taxes \nCosts \n(469.3) \n469.3 \n(704.0) \n704.0 \n(704.0) \n704.0 \n(469.3) \n469.3 \n176.8  \n43.8 \n185.1  \n49.4 \n194.0  \n55.3 \n203.4 \n61.5 \n213.4 \n68.2 \n224.1 \n75.3 \n235.4 \n82.8 \n247.5 \n90.8 \n260.3 \n99.3 \n268.6 \n105.7 \n198.6 \n191.1 \n286.2 \n119.5 \n296.5 \n125.8 \n307.3 \n132.3 \n318.4 \n139.2 \n234.2 \n242.2 \n342.1 \n153.9 \n354.6 \n161.7 \n367.6 \n169.8 \n(555.6)  1,115.1 \n\n33.3 \n38.9 \n44.8 \n51.0 \n57.7 \n64.8 \n72.3 \n80.3 \n88.8 \n95.2 \n101.9 \n109.0 \n115.3 \n121.8 \n128.7 \n88.7 \n143.4 \n151.2 \n159.3 \n167.8 \n\n \n  \n\n \n  \n\n  \n\n   \n   After Corporate Tax  \n\n \n\n \n7.58% \n\nTable A13.2: Sensitivity to Changes in Financial Factors \n \n\n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n \n5 \n6 \n \n7 \n8 \n \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n\nBase Case \nChanges in capital costs \nPlus 20% \nPlus 10% \nMinus 10% \nMinus 20% \nChanges in revenues \nMinus 20% \nMinus 10% \nChanges in operation and maintenance costs  \nPlus 30% \nProject delayed by 1 year \nCombined changes \nCapital costs plus 20%, revenue minus 20% \nCapital costs plus 10%, revenue minus 10% \nProject delayed 1 year, capital costs plus 10%, and revenue minus 10% \nProject delayed 1 year, capital costs plus 20%, and revenue minus 20% \nCurrency (CNY) devaluation by 30% \nProject delayed 1 year, capital costs plus 20%, revenue minus 20%, and \noperation and maintenance plus 30% \n\n \nFIRR (%) \n7.58 \n \n6.04 \n6.75 \n8.52 \n9.65 \n \n5.59 \n6.61 \n \n7.46 \n6.95 \n \n4.23 \n5.83 \n5.39 \n3.93 \n6.36 \n\n3.83 \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52\n\n \n\nAppendix 14           \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \n\nProject Costs and Benefits \n\nA. \n \nThe basis for project evaluation is a comparison of benefits and costs between the  with-\n1. \nproject  (base)  case  and  the  without-project  case.  The  project  analysis  period  is  20  years \nfollowing expected full operation by 2007. The project construction period is 4 years, from 2003 \nto the end of 2006. For details, refer to Supplementary Appendix N. \n\n \n\n \n2. \nCosts. Economic costs are at 2002 prices and are expressed in domestic currency. For \ntradable items, an exchange rate of CNY8.28 per $1.00 and a shadow exchange factor of 1.08 \nwere  used.  The  capital  costs  of  the  expressway  and  bridge  component  of  the  Project  were \nadjusted  to  economic  terms.  Economic  costs  total  CNY2,197.7  million.  Border  prices  of \nimported  goods  and  materials  were  adjusted  to  domestic  price  equivalents  using  shadow \nexchange rate factors in accordance with the domestic price numeraire. The capital costs were \nalso adjusted to eliminate price inflation, interest during construction, and taxes. Economic costs \nalso reflect the opportunity cost of land, and the shadow price for unskilled labor\u2014in surplus in \nthe project area.  \n \n3. \nBenefits.  The  main  economic  benefits  generated  by  the  project  are  vehicle  operating \ncost  (VOC)  savings,  reduced  travel  time,  and  cost  savings  due  to  reduced  accidents.  Other \nbenefits include freight cost savings and resource cost savings arising from diversion of freight \nfrom  rail  to  highway.  The  benefits  from  a  reduction  in  number  and  severity  of  accidents \nconstitute  an  important  element  of  economic  benefits.  Accident  reductions  were  estimated \nbased  on  data  from  the  Highway  Planning  and  Design  Institute  of  the  Ministry  of \nCommunications (Table A14.1). \n \n\nTable A14.1: Accident Rates and Costs in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC)  \n(2002 prices) \n \n\n \n \nRoad Class \nExpressway \nMotorway Class I \nMotorway Class II \nHighway Class I \nHighway Class II \n\nAverage Value of Direct \nProperty Damage Per \nAccident (CNY) \n17,780 \n12,700 \n9,843 \n8,255 \n5,715 \n\nNumber of Accidents \nPer 100 Million \nVehicle-Kilometers \n20\u201350 \n55\u201370 \n105\u2013120 \n150\u2013160 \nMore than 160 \n\nResults \n\n \nB. \n \n4. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project is 16.17% indicating that the \nProject is economically viable (Table A14.2). The EIRRs of the expressway and the local road \nprogram  are  15.99%  and  21.58%,  respectively.  VOC  savings  amount  to  90.7%  of  total \neconomic benefits, while benefits from reduced travel time and reduced accidents each account \nfor  4.5%  and  4.8%,  respectively.  The  sensitivity  of  the  EIRR  to  various  changes  in  costs  and \nbenefits is not of major significance. If capital costs were to increase by 20%, EIRR would only \ndecrease by 2%. Should economic benefits decrease by 20%, then EIRR would be reduced to \n14.06%. The impact of a 20% reduction in benefits along with a 20% increase in capital costs \nwould decrease EIRR to 11.84%. Switching values are identified based on a 12% discount rate. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 14             53\n\nCapital costs would need to increase by 48% in order for EIRR to be reduced to 12%. Similarly, \nbenefits would have to be decreased by 32% for EIRR to be reduced to 12% (Table A14.3).  \n \n5. \nAs  expressway  tolls  increase,  more  drivers  and  operators  will  opt  to  use  other  routes. \nHowever,  there  is  no  close  alternative  by  which  the  Yellow  River\u2014connecting  Shanxi  and \nShaanxi  provinces\u2014can  be  crossed.  Therefore,  it  is  expected  that  demand  for  expressway \ntravel  would  be  highly  inelastic  and  increases  in  toll  fees  would  have  minimal  effects  on  the \nnumber of vehicles traveling on the expressway.  \n \n\nTable 14.2: Economic Benefits and Costs, Expressway and Local Roads   \n(Constant CNY million) \n\n \nShifted  \nfrom  \n\n \n \nLocal \nRailway  Roads \n \n \n \n

Details on poverty reduction and social impact analyses are given in \nSupplementary Appendix C.  \n \n \n \nB. \n \nThe analysis concludes that  48,365  poor  people  will  be  directly  affected  by  the  Project,  accounting  for  4.8%  of  the \ntotal  population  (1 million)  in  the  project  area.  However,  it  was  observed  that  a  high  percentage  of  people  have  an \naverage income just slightly above the poverty line. Based on an income distribution analysis it was observed that \nabout  additional  6%  of  the  total  population  of  the  project  area  are  vulnerable,  earning  annual  incomes  between \nCNY1,001  to  CNY1,300  in  rural  areas  and  CNY3,001  to  CNY3,300  in  urban  areas.  As  per  the  loan  classification \nsystem,  the  Project  belongs  to \nthe  \"Other\"  category.  Nevertheless,  the  Project  will  provide  new  economic \nopportunities  for  the  poor  in  the  project  area.  For  the  expressway,  about  2,340  person-years of job opportunities \nwithin  the  unskilled  labor  category  can  be  provided.  Total  additional  income  for  these  poor  unskilled  laborers  is \nestimated  around  CNY17  million  during  the  construction  phase.  For  the  local  roads,  about  260  person-years of \nemployment for unskilled poor laborers can be made. Total additional income for these poor laborers is estimated to \nbe around CNY2.0 million. In addition, economic benefits arising from increased land cultivation and other agricultural \nactivities, through improved accessibility, will be a 19% of incremental incomes in the project area. For details, refer \nto Supplementary Appendix C.  \n \n \nC. \nParticipation Process \nStakeholder analysis prepared  \n \nDuring the preparation of the Project, Shanxi Hou-yu Expressway Construction Company Limited (SHEC) undertook \nseveral opinion surveys, socio-economic surveys, and public meetings which raised the level of awareness, gained \nlocal support, and enabled stakeholders to voice opinions and suggestions for project design and implementation. \n \nParticipation strategy: For the selection of unskilled labor in the project area, the external monitoring agency will \nidentify appropriate team leaders in poor natural villages in the project area and train them as deemed necessary. \nThe team leaders will then select a labor team from poor households in his/her natural village. The county \ngovernment, the Executing Agency, and the external monitoring agency will coordinate the signing of the contracts \nbetween the contractors and the team leaders from poor villages. \n \n \n\nYes \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPotential Issues \n\nD. \n \n \nSubject \nResettlement \n\nSignificant, \nNot Significant, \nUncertain, None \nSignificant \n\nGender \nAffordability \nLabor \nIndigenous  \nPeople \nOther Risks/ \nVulnerabilities  \n\nNot Significant \nNot Significant \nNot Significant \nNot Significant \n\nNone \n\n \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \nDisclosure of information booklet, feedback \nmonitoring, full resettlement plan posted on \nthe Asian Development Bank web site, and \nimplementation monitoring by SHEC and an \nexternal agency \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \nOutput Prepared \nFull \n\nNone \nNone \nNone \nNone \n\nNone \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n5\n6\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\ni\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n5\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSocial Development Action Plan (2003 \u2013 2007) \n\nTarget Population \n\nAgencies Involved \n\nTiming \n\nMonitoring Indicators \n\nSocial Aspects and                \nProposed Actions \n\n1.

On  the \nother  hand,  people  and  their  surroundings  are  faced  with  the  increasingly  serious  problem  of \nroad  safety  and  vehicle  emissions,  which  inhibit  the  economic  and  social  development  of  the \nPRC.  They  are  associated  with  millions  of  premature  deaths  and  injuries,  high  medical costs, \nstrain in welfare service, and reduction of productivity. Many of the problems encountered with \nroad  safety  and  vehicle  emissions  are  predominantly  institutional  in  nature, with fragmentation \nof  responsibility,  lack  of  interdepartmental  coordination,  inadequate  data  systems  and \nmonitoring,  inadequate  action  plans  and  integrated  strategy,  inadequate  enforcement  and \nlegislation,  lack  of  road  safety  audit  and  accident  black  spot  programs,  a  weak  vehicle \ninspection system , and a shortage of skilled staff and resources. For improvement of air quality \nin Shanxi, an advisory  technical assistance (TA) was provided to  the PRC in 1999.1 To improve \ntraffic safety in PRC, an advisory TA was approved in 1999.2 For reduction of vehicle emissions, \na regional TA was approved in 2000.3 ADB will continue its dialogue with the PRC Government \nto facilitate the implementation of the national action plans to be proposed under these TAs. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nAccident  rates  in  PRC  are  very  high  com pared  with  highly  motorized  countries  and \nDMCs  of  the  region.  Official  statistics  indicate  that  there  were  616,971  road  accidents,  killing \n93,853  and  injuring  418,721,  in  2000,  up  49%,  12%,  and  46%  respectively  from  the  previous \nyear. A recent study4 concluded that the economic cost of traffic accidents in the PRC may be \nas  high  as  $2  billion  per  year,  while  another  study5  indicates  that  underreporting  of  traffic \naccident fatalities in  the  PRC  may  be  about  42%.  Most  accidents  are  associated  with  driver \nbehavior,  speed,  alcohol  intake,  pedestrian  action,  and  road  conditions.6  There  are  no  readily \navailable data on comparative accident rates for various classes of road in Shanxi. The lack of \ncoordination between departments and the poorly maintained traffic accident data are seriously \nhampering meaningful traffic safety reforms in  the PRC. In 2000, Shanxi recorded  16,344 road \naccidents, involving 2,414 fatalities and 11,721 injuries. There was a rise of 13% in accidents over \nthe  previous  year  and  accidents  increased  at  a  higher  rate  than  traffic  volume growth (about \n9.4%), due to the poor condition of the roads \n \n\nRoad Safety \n\n1. \n\nTraffic and Road Design Standards \n\n \n3. \nSafety  is  one  of  the  major  factors  which  should  be  taken  into  consideration  in \nconjunction  with  others  such  as  mobility,  economy,  and  environmental  impacts,  to  achieve \nbalanced  design  standards.8  The  geometric  design  of  the  expressway  should  be  chosen \ncarefully  to  ensure  that  speed  limits  are  chosen  to  suit  the  geometric  design  rather  than  the \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1999.

It is recommended that the service/rest areas, if they are close \nto  significant  crossroads  and  towns,  be  used  also  as  long-distance  bus  stops  to  provide \nconvenient services for  passengers.  Monitoring  of  overloaded  vehicles  will  help  reduce  traffic \naccident  risk,  pavement  damage,  and  maintenance  cost.  Road  safety  audits  should  be \nundertaken during design and construction. \n \n\n2. \n\nOrganizational Structure \n\n \n4. \nThe  two  organizations  concerned  with  road  safety  and  enforcement  of  the  existing \nexpressways  in  Shanxi  are  the  Expressway  Subdivision  of  the  Traffic  Police  of  the  Shanxi \nPublic  Security  Department  (SPSD)  and  the  Enforcement  and  Emergency  Division  of  the \nExpressway  Companies.  Shanxi  has  a  road  safety  council,  which  investigates  all  types  of \naccidents  and  produces  draft  provincial  codes  and  standards  for  accident  prevention.  While \nestablishing  the  council  is  a  significant  step,  there  is  a  need  to  enhance  the  authority  of  this \ncouncil to play more proactive role in coordinating road safety across the province.  \n \n\n3. \n\nInterdepartmental Coordination and Action Plan  \n\n \nIt  is  necessary  to  establish  an  interdepartmental  framework  to  enhance  road  safety  in \n5. \nthe  province.  While  Shanxi  Hou-yu  Expressway  Construction  Company  Limited  (SHEC)  will \nconcentrate  on  the  engineering,  road  safety  audit,  black  spot,  and  operational  issues  of  the \nexpressway,  involvement  of  SPSD  is  essential.  SHEC  will  establish  a  working  relationship \nstrategy with  SPSD  to  implement  safer  and  better  expressway  operations.  The  strategy  will \nseek  to  promote  innovative  ways  to  improve  road  safety  through  the  following  broad-based \napproach  (i) institutional  strengthening:  strengthen  the  provincial  road  safety  council  by \nestablishing  an  interdepartmental  executive  group;  develop  comprehensive  action  programs, \ntechnical studies, and modalities for greater leadership and awareness; and improve the policy \nand regulatory framework and effective monitoring; (ii) capacity building and human resources \ndevelopment: set up an effective and uniform database; and upgrade skills and knowledge, and \nroad  safety  research;  (iii)  provincial  cooperation:  develop  potential  common  projects  and \nactivities, conduct regional workshops, disseminate best practice, and strengthen linkages in the \nnational program; and (iv) create  an  effective  coordination  approach  through  government  and \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  the  private  sector, and community groups. This will be \nachieved  through  (i) a  computerized  accident  and  enforcement  reporting  and  monitoring \nsystem; (ii) development of  a strategy framework and performance indicators; (iii) staff training; \nand (iv) strengthening the role of the provincial road safety council.  \n \n6. \nAn  implementation  plan  is  required  to  promote  an  efficient  road  safety  strategy  in  the \nprovince,  and  for  the  expressway.  An  integrated  approach  may  be  adopted  to  facilitate  the \nimplementation  of  the  action  plan  by  involving  SCD  and  SPSD.  Insurance  companies,  the \nprivate  sector,  and  NGO  groups  can  also  be  involved.  This  will  result  in:  (i)  reduction  of \naccidents;  (ii)  reduced  demand  on  emergency  and  hospital  services;  and  (iii)  improved \nproductivity.  Formulation  of  a  better  system  and  other  measures  will  generate  revenues  to \nsupport the program.  Modification of the vehicle-testing centre also will provide some funds to \nsupport  the  proposed  program.  A  road  safety  specialist  in  safety  strategy  development, \nenforcement  management,  prevention  measures,  socioeconomic  cost,  and  critical  issues  of \nsuccessful road safety programs will assist SPSD and SHEC for a period of 2 person-months. \nThe specialist will (i) develop a general provincial road safety implementation plan covering all \n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 16 \n\nkey issues; and (ii) formulate a road safety strategy for the project area, e.g., Hejin, Jishan, and \nXinjiang. \n\nVehicle Emissions \n\nC. \n \n7. \nMotor vehicle emissions are a significant contributor to air pollution. The fragmentation of \nresponsibility,  lack  of  interdepartmental  coordination,  together  with  inadequate  base  data  and \nmonitoring system prevent the formulation of any specific targets for reduction in key pollutants \nsuch  as  CO,  NOx,  PM10,  and  nonmethane  hydrocarbons  (NMHC).  Given  these  conditions, \nSHEC and the Yuncheng Environmental Protection Bureau  will proceed with the planning for a \nvehicle  emissions  control  implementation  plan.  Implementing  such  a  program  will  require \ncooperative  effort  among  a  number  of  agencies,  jurisdictions,  and  communities  as  well  as \ngovernment  commitment  and  leadership.  The  recommended  approach  is  to  implement  a  pilot \nvehicle  emission  testing  and  certification  program,  focusing  initially  on  diesel  trucks,  buses, \ntaxis,  and  later  on  for  all  vehicles.  The  program  then  could  be  assessed  and  adapted  for \nareawide implementation. The pilot program could include (i) identification of vehicle types; (ii) \nestablishment  of  vehicle  inspection  sites;  (iii)  building  more  CNG  filling  stations;  (iv) a  public \nawareness  campaign  regarding  the  inspection  timetable  for  vehicles,  based  on  license  plate \nnumbers and  advertisement of  economic  incentives,  e.g.,  toll  reductions  for  certified  vehicles; \n(v) an intensive training program and capacity building focusing on emissions testing, and data \nanalysis  and  reporting;  (vi)  an  annual  air  quality  monitoring  program;  (vi)  media,  NGO,  and \ncommunity involvement; and (vi) establishment of an integrated provincial level emission control \ncouncil. \n \nAn  implementation  plan  is  required  to  promote  efficient  vehicle  emissions  reduction \n8. \nmeasures  in  the  province  and  in  the  project  area.  An  integrated  approach  may  be  adopted  to \nfacilitate  the  implementation  of  the  action  plan.  Various  agencies  such  as  SHEC,  Yuncheng \nEnvironmental  Protection  Bureau, and SPSD  need to participate  in  the  implementation  of  the \nplan. Fuel companies, the private sector, and NGO groups can also be involved. Modification of \ncurrent  programs  of  the  environmental  bureau  and  optimization of resources is necessary to \nenhance  emissions  reductions  in  the  project  area.  Formulation  of  a  better  system and other \nmeasures will generate some revenues to support the program. Further development of current \nvehicle  testing  centers  to  create  an  integrated  vehicle  testing  system  (both  safety  and  vehicle \nemissions) will be a cost-effective method to support the program. \n  \n9. \nA  vehicle  emissions  specialist  will  be  engaged  to  undertake  consulting  services, \ncovering  emissions  strategy  development,  enforcement  management,  prevention  measures, \nsocioeconomic  cost,  and  critical  issues  of  successful  emissions  control  programs.
