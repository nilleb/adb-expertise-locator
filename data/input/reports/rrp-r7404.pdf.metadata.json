The Project involves small-scale civil and building works at \nsites previously or currently used for the same or similar purposes and is \nnot \nimpact.  All \nto  generate  any  significant  environmental \nsubprojects  will  be  required  to  complete  and  satisfy  an  environmental \nchecklist during formulation.  \n \n\nlikely \n\nto \n\nthe  Government\u2019s  overall  relief  and \nrehabilitation program for the conflict-affected areas of the Northern and \nEastern provinces, which make up almost one third of Sri Lanka\u2019s area \nand contain about 10% of its total population. The Project will focus on \nessential economic and social infrastructure and address basic needs in \nthe  conflict-affected  areas \nthrough  health,  education,  agriculture, \ncommunity,  and  income  generation  subprojects.  Restoration  activities \nwill  focus  on  medium-scale  subprojects  designed  to  bridge  community \ndevelopment with broader district-level improvements.  \n \nFor  nearly  20  years,  the  Northern  and  Eastern  provinces  of  Sri  Lanka \nserved as the theater for the conflict between the Government\u2019s armed \nforces  and  the  Liberation  Tigers  of  Tamil  Eelam  (LTTE),  leaving  over \n65,000  dead,  several  times  as  many  people  disabled,  and  nearly \n800,000  people  displaced  from  their  homes.  On  22  February  2002,  the \nGovernment  and  the  LTTE  signed  a  cease-fire  agreement,  thereby \ncommencing  the  long  process  of  ending  the  conflict  and  beginning  a \nperiod  of  reconciliation  and  restoration.  Although  only  in  effect  for  2 \nyears, the cease-fire has brought a measure of normalcy to the country, \nand, in particular, to the North East. However, the vast majority of people \ndirectly  affected  by  the  conflict  still  suffer  from  a  lack  of  basic \ninfrastructure and social services.  \n \nThe  operations  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  in  the  conflict-\naffected areas began well before the cease-fire agreement through Loan \n1846\u2013SRI(SF):  North  East  Community  Restoration  and  Development \n(NECORD)  Project.  The  NECORD  Project  is  now  improving  the  well-\nbeing of people affected by the 20-year long conflict in the North East by \nproviding  basic  services  for  those  affected  by  the  conflict,  restoring \nhealth  and  education  facilities,  reestablishing  agricultural  and  fishing \nactivities as a means of providing incomes, and mobilizing communities \nto become involved in implementing project-financed activities.  \n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \nObjectives and \nScope \n\nin \n\nidentified \n\nin  June  2003, \n\nA needs assessment, which was presented to international aid agencies \nat  the  Sri  Lanka  Reconstruction  and  Development  Conference  held  in \nTokyo \nimmediate  and  medium-term \nrehabilitation  needs  across  all  sectors,  costing  about  $1.9 billion,  of \nwhich  about  $700 million  was  required  immediately.  The  Conference, \nthrough  the  Tokyo  Declaration,  also  agreed  that  assistance  by  the \ninternational  aid  agencies  must  be  closely  linked  to  substantial  and \nparallel  progress \nthe  peace  process.  About  $550 million  and \n$194 million  have  been  committed  by  the  multilateral  and  bilateral \nagencies, respectively, through ongoing and planned projects. However, \nthe  present  commitments  account  for  only  35%  of  the  total  immediate \nneeds,  with  significantly  less  commitment  toward  the  restoration  of \nessential physical and social infrastructure. Resumption of economic life \nand  reestablishment  of \nlivelihoods  rely  on  rehabilitation  of  key \ninfrastructure facilities and community restoration.  \n \nRecognizing that the conditions in the North East are the aftermath of 20 \nyears  of  conflict  and  have  resulted  in  a  situation  where  needs  that \nrequire  urgent  attention  greatly  exceed  available  resources,  the  Project \nhas been processed under ADB\u2019s emergency rehabilitation procedures. \nThe  Project  follows  the  ongoing  NECORD  Project,  and  adopts  that \nproject\u2019s sector loan approach. The Project will reinforce the perception \nthat the international community remains involved with and is supporting \nthe  peace  process,  and  will  also  confirm  ADB\u2019s  leading  role  in \nrehabilitation  and  peace  support  operations  in  the  country\u2019s  most \nimpoverished and vulnerable region.  \n \nThe  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  rapidly  improve  the  living  conditions \nand  well-being  of  the  significant  number  of  people  in  the  areas  badly \naffected by the conflict, particularly in the North East. The purpose is to \nrestore basic social infrastructure and community service needs in these \nareas.  The  Project  will  support  and  augment \nthe  Government\u2019s \nrehabilitation  and  relief  efforts  already  under  way  through  the  existing \nNECORD Project.  \n \nThe Project will focus on the highest priority sectors and areas for which \nADB  assistance  is  most  appropriate,  based  on  the  needs  assessment \nand reflecting consultations with the Government, development partners, \nthe LTTE, communities, nongovernment organizations, and others. The \nProject  is  being  prepared  and  will  be  implemented  using  a  sector \napproach,  through  which  subprojects  will  be  selected  on  the  basis  of \nagreed  general  and  sector-specific  criteria.  The  Project  will  address \nbasic  needs  in  the  conflict-affected  areas  through  health,  education, \nagriculture,  income-generation  capacity  building,  and  social  cohesion \nsubprojects.  Subprojects  in  each  of  these  sectors  will  be  selected  and \nformulated  in  response  to  requests  from  conflict-affected  persons  and \nthe Government. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nLoan Amount and \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of \nUtilization \n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \n\nv\n\nRepresentative  subprojects  proposed  for  implementation  under  the \nProject  include  the  reconstruction  of  the  Chavakacheri  Hospital,  Jaffna \ndistrict;  rehabilitation  and  expansion  of  the  Vavuniya  General  and \nMannar  Base  hospitals;  reconstruction  of \nthe  Kilinochchi  Central \nthe  conflict;  provision  of  cluster-housing \nin \nCollege,  destroyed \ncompounds  for  teachers  in  remote  areas;  construction  of  a  cultural \ncenter  in  Vavuniya,  to  assist  in  reconciliation  of  the  area\u2019s  three  ethnic \ncommunities; livestock development and agriculture extension services; \nskills  development  and  training  programs;  and  a  prototype  program  to \ndevelop a women\u2019s enterprise initiative, for wider-scale use on follow-on \nprojects in the north and east.  \n \nThe  estimated  total  cost  is  $14.3 million  equivalent,  inclusive  of  taxes, \nduties, and interest during implementation.  \n \n\n \nSource \nADB \nGovernment \n\nForeign \nExchange \n5.5 \n0.0 \n\n($ million) \nLocal \nCurrency \n4.5 \n4.3 \n\nTotal \nCost \n10.0 \n 4.3 \n\n \n% \n70 \n30 \n\n5.5 \n\n8.8 \n\n100 \n\n14.3 \n\nTotal\nADB = Asian Development Bank.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $10  million  equivalent  from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the Project.  The term of \nthe  loan  will  be  40  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  10  years,  with \nrepayment  of  principal  at  2%  per  year  for  the  first  10  years  after  the \ngrace  period  and  4%  a  year  thereafter,  with  an  interest  charge  at  the \nrate of 1% per annum.   \n \nUntil 30 June 2007 \n \n \nThe Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government will serve as \nthe  Executing  Agency.  The  North  East  Provincial  Council,  under  the \ndirection  of  the  chief  secretary,  will  be  the  implementing  agency \nresponsible for overall project coordination and implementation.  \n \n\n\fto  assist \n\nthe  PMU \n\nThe Project will be implemented using the same process approach and \nwill  follow  the  same  implementation  arrangements  that  are  already  in \nplace and that are working extremely well for NECORD, thereby allowing \nsignificant  additional  needs  to  be  met  quickly  and  effectively.  The \nGovernor of the Northern and Eastern provinces will coordinate activities \nbetween  the  civil  and  military  authorities.  A  project  management  unit \n(PMU),  operating  in  Trincomalee  and  headed  by  a  project  director,  will \nmanage  the  Project  on  a  day-to-day  basis.  The  PMU  will  implement \nthrough  government  and  NECORD  structures  and \nsubprojects \nprocedures at the provincial, district, and divisional levels. District PMUs \nestablished  in  each  district  under  NECORD  and  headed  by  deputy \nproject directors will be responsible for district-level project operations. A \nnational  project  coordinator  based  within  the  Ministry  of  Provincial \nCouncils and Local Government in Colombo will assist the PMU with the \nexecution  of \nthe  Project.  The  German  Government\u2019s  Deutsche \nGesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  has  provided  a  team  of \nin \ninternational  and  domestic  specialists \nadministration  of  NECORD.  This  assistance  will  continue  through  the \nNorth  East  Provincial  Council  in  areas  such  as  planning,  human \nresource  development,  and  monitoring,  and  will  be  available  to  the \nProject on a preferential basis.  \n \nProcurement  under  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement,  and  the  Government\u2019s  tender \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. Local procurement will be the preferred \nmode \nthe  relatively  short \nimplementation  period,  the  small  size  of  contract  packages  (below \n$2.5 million),  the  wide  geographic  spread  of  the  project  sites,  and  the \nneed  for  local  awareness  of  security  and  other  frequently  changing \nmatters relevant to accessing the project area. Contracts with estimated \nvalues  less  than  $100,000  will  be  procured  under  local  competitive \nbidding using post-facto approval procedures.  \n \nEquipment  and  materials  will  be  procured  under \ninternational \ncompetitive  bidding  where  the  estimated  cost  is  more  than  $500,000 \nequivalent,  by  international  shopping  where  the  estimated  cost  is \nlocal \nbetween  $300,000  and  $500,000  equivalent,  and \nprocurement procedures acceptable to ADB where the estimated cost is \n$300,000  equivalent  or  less.  Minor  items  costing  less  than  $100,000 \nequivalent may be procured through direct purchase.  \n \n\nfor  all  project  activities,  because  of \n\nthrough \n\nvi \n\n \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\nConsulting \nServices \n\n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nProject Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \n\n \n\nvii\n\nThe  existing  consultants  for  NECORD,  who  are  providing  procurement \nand  contract  management  support,  and  training  of  domestic  agencies, \nwill extend their services through direct selection to cover the additional \nrequirements  of  the  Project.  For  new  services,  primarily  for  the \npreparation  of  master  plans  and  bid  documents  for  larger  subprojects, \nconsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants. \nConsultants  will  be  provided  individually  and  through  firms;  quality  and \ncost-based  selection  procedures  will  be  used  in  the  recruitment  of \nconsulting firms. Individual consultants will also be fielded to assist in the \npreparation  of  gender-oriented  economic  activities  and  business \ncooperatives. The Project will require approximately 350 person-months \nof domestic consulting services.  \n \n31 December 2006 \n\n \nThe  conflict-affected  areas  suffer  from  poverty  levels\u2014estimated  to \nrange  from  60%  to  90%\u2014that  are  much  higher  than  in  the  rest  of  the \ncountry.  Little  of  the  social  or  economic  infrastructure  remains  intact; \nmuch  of  what  remains  has  long  passed  its  useful  life.  Until  the \ninfrastructure is restored, at least marginally, there is little opportunity for \nthe restoration of livelihoods.  \n \nThe  Project  will  benefit  a  significant  proportion  of  the  nearly  800,000 \npeople  who  were  forced  to  relocate  because  of  the  conflict\u2014and  who \nare  now  returning  to  their  homes\u2014as  well  as  those  people  who \nremained  in  place  but  lost  access  to  basic  social  and  economic \ninfrastructure;  many  are  physically  disabled  people,  female-headed \nhouseholds,  and  children.  Through  the  restoration  of  sectors  that  form \nthe backbone of the economy of the North East, the Project serves as a \nchannel  that  brings  about  normalcy  to  the  lives  of  the  affected \ncommunities  and  assists  in  stabilizing  the  economic  basis  of  those \naffected  by  the  conflict,  reducing  their  dependency  on  government \nsupport  and  securing  a  sustainable  livelihood  for  them.  The  Project\u2019s \nhealth and education activities will start the long process of restoring the \nsocial  indicators  in  the  North  East  to  preconflict  levels.  A  significant \nportion of the Project will focus on providing employment, training, and a \nsense of ownership for people, who now lack most of the basic essential \nrequirements  for  a  productive  life.  Specialized  prototype  programs  will \nbe developed to address the plight of the high percentage of war widows \nin fishing communities.  \n \n\n\fThe major risk is that the Project, through poor targeting and inadequate \ncontrol and monitoring, will exacerbate the tensions that ultimately led to \nconflict. On condition that the beneficial outcomes are shared sufficiently \nequitably among the major ethnic groups and across the target area, the \nProject  is  not  expected  to  contribute  to  an  intensification  of  social \ntensions.  The  Project  has  been  designed  and  will  be  implemented  in  a \nmanner to ensure that balances among ethnic groups and regions within \nthe project areas are carefully monitored and managed, and that there is \ntransparency and complete community ownership of project activities.  \n \nBeyond just \u201cdoing no harm,\u201d the Project can potentially make a positive \ncontribution to the rebuilding of key infrastructure and help make existing \ninfrastructure more effective in strengthening the socioeconomic fabric of \nthe conflict-affected areas. The challenge will be in implementing these \nactivities in a conflict-sensitive manner.  \n \nFinally,  reflecting  the  linkage  between  aid  agency  assistance  and \nprogress in the peace process, there is a risk that, if the peace process \nfalters, the Project\u2019s scope and schedule may require review. However, \ngiven  the  recently  restated  commitment  of  the  Government  and  the \nLTTE to resume peace  talks, and the robustness of the peace process \nitself\u2014despite recent political and other uncertainties, the peace process \nremains  intact  and  the  cease-fire  agreed  to  in  2002  continues  to  be \nobserved\u2014this risk is assessed to be small.  \n\nviii\n\n \n\nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nix\n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the North East Community Restoration and \nDevelopment (NECORD) - Extension Project. \n \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nFor  nearly  20  years,  the  Northern  and  Eastern  provinces  of  Sri  Lanka  served  as  the \ntheater  for  the  conflict  between  the  Government\u2019s  armed  forces  and  the  Liberation  Tigers  of \nTamil  Eelam  (LTTE),  leaving  over  65,000  dead,  several  times  as  many  people  disabled,  and \nnearly 800,000 people displaced from their homes. While all of Sri Lanka has suffered from the \nconsequences, the North East and the adjacent areas have borne the brunt of the conflict. On \n22  February  2002,  the  Government  and  the  LTTE  signed  a  cease-fire  agreement,  thereby \ncommencing the long process of ending the conflict and beginning a period of reconciliation and \nrestoration.  Although  only  in  effect  for  2  years,  the  cease-fire  has  brought  a  measure  of \nnormalcy  to  the  country,  and,  in  particular,  to  the  North  East.  However,  the  vast  majority  of \npeople directly affected by the conflict still suffer from the lack of basic infrastructure and social \nservices.  \n \nSince  the  cease-fire,  nearly  40%1  of  the  internally  displaced  persons  (IDPs)  and \n3. \nrefugees  have  returned  to  their  places  of  origin,  usually  to  find  their  villages  devastated,  and \nbasic  infrastructure,  such  as  access  to  health,  schools,  and  community  facilities,  no  longer \nfunctioning.  The  Government,  with  the  assistance  of  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies,  is \nproviding  some  assistance  to  the  returnees  through  its  Unified  Assistance  Scheme.  This \nassistance,  which  is  essentially  a  small  cash  grant  and  food  rations  for  a  limited  period,  is \nsufficient only for the returnees to establish themselves. In addition, several agencies, including \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB), are helping with the substantial task of rehabilitating and \nreplacing essential infrastructure, to build confidence among the IDPs and the host communities \nthat suffered through the conflict.  \n \n4. \nAlthough  the  conflict  has  yet  to  formally  end,  the  Government,  the  LTTE,  and  the \ninternational  community  clearly  recognize  the  need  to  continue  the  rehabilitation  and \ndevelopment  efforts  in  the  conflict-affected  areas  to  reinforce  the  confidence  in  the  ongoing \npeace process, and as a \u201cpeace dividend\u201d for the area\u2019s people and for the entire country. The \nmultilateral  agencies  operating  in  Sri  Lanka2  gave  substance  to  this  by  undertaking  a \ncomprehensive  needs  assessment  of  relief,  rehabilitation,  and  reconstruction  needs  for  the \nconflict-affected areas, primarily in the eight districts that make up the North East and the areas \nof  the  four  adjacent  districts  that  have  also  been  impacted  by  the  conflict  (see  Map).  The \nassessment,  which  was  presented \nthe  Sri  Lanka \nReconstruction  and  Development  Conference  held  in  Tokyo  in  June  2003,3  concluded  that \nabout  $3 billion  would  be  required  for  relief,  rehabilitation,  and  reconstruction\u2014$2 billion  for \nimmediate  and  medium-term  needs  (within  6  years)  and  $1 billion  for  longer-term  needs.

To  date,  the  international \ncommunity  has  committed  about  $645 million  in  assistance\u2014about  35%  of  the  immediate \nneeds\u2014mainly for relief and rehabilitation activities. Of this amount, ADB\u2019s contribution to date \nis $237 million,4 amounting to 11% of the identified immediate needs.  \n \nADB\u2019s  operations  in  the  conflict-affected  areas  began  well  before  the  cease-fire \n5. \nagreement,  when  the  conflict  was  most  intense,  through  Loan  1846\u2013SRI(SF):  North  East \nCommunity  Restoration  and  Development  (NECORD)  Project.  This  multisector  rehabilitation \nand reconstruction project was approved in October 2001 and began implementation in January \n2002.  It  operates  in  all  eight  districts,  including  areas  under  the  control  of  the  LTTE.  To  date, \nabout  500  subprojects,  primarily  for  rehabilitation  of  basic  infrastructure  and  restoration  of \ncommunities,  have  been  approved  for  implementation,  and  about  200  have  been  successfully \ncompleted.  A  summary  of  the  NECORD  subprojects  by  sector  and  district  is  provided  in \nAppendix 1.  The  project  funding,  originally  $40 million  but  now  substantially  more  through \npostapproval  cofinancing,  is  fully  committed  and,  as  such,  no  further  subprojects  can  be \napproved for implementation under NECORD. Although NECORD has been very effective and \nhighly efficient to date, it can only address a fraction of the immediate rehabilitation needs.  \n \n6. \nIn  recognition  that  the  conditions  in  the  North  East  are  the  aftermath  of  20  years  of \nconflict  and  have  resulted  in  a  situation  where  needs  that  require  urgent  attention  greatly \nexceed available resources, the Project has been prepared under ADB\u2019s disaster rehabilitation \nprocedures  as  appropriate  and  in  anticipation  of  ADB\u2019s  forthcoming  policy  on  disaster  and \nemergency assistance being prepared during processing of the Project.5 The Project follows the \nongoing NECORD Project and other emergency lending projects, and for reasons of continuity \nand rapid response, adopts the lending terms, and process implementation approach of those \nprojects  (see  project  framework  in  Appendix 2).  This  process  has  worked  extremely  well  for \nNECORD and other emergency lending projects, thereby allowing significant additional needs to \nbe  met  quickly  and  effectively,  demonstrating  visible  and  effective  support  for  the  peace \nprocess.  The  Project  therefore  reinforces  the  perception  that  the  international  community \nremains involved with and is supporting the peace process, and will also confirm ADB\u2019s leading \nrole  in  rehabilitation  and  peace  support  operations  in  the  country\u2019s  most  impoverished  and \nvulnerable  region.  The  project  framework  also  identifies  broad  performance  indicators  to  be \nused  to  monitor  and  evaluate  project  performance  and  attainment  of  benefits;  with  the  sector \nloan and process implementation approach, detailed performance indicators will be developed \nduring the course of the Project.  \n \n7. \nBecause  the  Project  has  been  processed  under  ADB\u2019s  disaster  and  emergency \nassistance policy and will use a sector-style approach to approving projects for implementation, \neconomic  analysis  is  not  required.  As  for  the  original  NECORD  Project,  investments  will  be \n                                                 \n4  ADB.  2001.

The  social  and \nenvironmental  analyses  undertaken  for  NECORD  were  revisited  during  the  midterm  review  in \nthe  context  of  current  safeguard  policies  and  remain  relevant  for  the  Project.  In  addition, \nsubproject  concept  development,  selection,  and  implementation  procedures  already  in  place \nprovide for comprehensive social and economic assessments.  \n \nB. \n \nThe North East constitutes almost a third of Sri Lanka\u2019s land area, and is administratively \n8. \ndivided into eight districts.6 Although the LTTE controls the districts of Kilinochchi and Mullaittivu \ncompletely and exercises partial control in other districts, the Government\u2019s civil administration, \nother  than  the  military,  police,  and  the  judiciary,  is  functioning  in  all  eight  districts.  The  North \nEast\u2019s preconflict population of about 2.1 million people is now reduced to significantly less than \n2 million. The conflict caused significant movements of population within all districts in the North \nEast  and  into  the  bordering  districts.  Since  the  cease-fire,  it  appears  that  the  populations  of \nJaffna,  Mullaittivu,  and  Kilinochchi  districts  are  increasing  as  displaced  families  return  to  their \nhomes,  a  process  that  occurs  spontaneously  and  often  results  in  significant  deprivation  as \nfamilies  find  that  support  is  not  available.  In  other  districts,  there  is  either  a  decrease  due  to \noutward IDP movement or stability in the population.  \n \nThe  population  of  the  North  East  has  always  been  largely  rural,  with  over  88%  living \n9. \noutside the principal towns. Livelihoods mainly depend on agriculture, fishing, and subsistence \nfarming.  During  the  conflict,  much  of  the  agricultural  land  became  inaccessible,  through  direct \nconflict  or  because  of  land  mines.  Irrigation  systems  were  either  destroyed,  or  fell  into  disuse \nand now require extensive rehabilitation before being returned to service. Fishing was severely \nlimited,  which  had  a  serious  impact  on  a  region  that  once  provided  more  than  half  of  the \ncountry\u2019s  fresh  and  dried  fish.  Most  fishing  boats  and  many  fishing  facilities  (harbors,  ice \nfacilities, markets, etc.) were destroyed, and have not yet been replaced. Much of the region\u2019s \nphysical  infrastructure  and  the  means  of  production  was  damaged  or  destroyed,  or  has \ndeteriorated  over  time.  Its  replacement  and  rehabilitation  are  essential  if  economic  life  is  to \nresume and normal livelihoods are to be reestablished.  \n \nSince the cease-fire, rehabilitation of some of basic infrastructure has been undertaken \n10. \nwith  the  assistance  of  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies  which,  respectively,  have  committed \nabout  $550 million  and  $194 million,  as  detailed  in  Appendix 3,  and  through  ongoing  and \nplanned projects for 2003 and 2004. However, the present commitments account for only 35% \nof  the  total  immediate  needs,  most  of  which  provide  relief  and  target  the  restoration  of \nlivelihoods;  other  than  for  ADB-supported  programs,  there  has  been  significantly  less \ncommitment  toward  the  rehabilitation  and  restoration  of  essential  physical  and  social \ninfrastructure.  \n \n11. \nADB\u2019s  contribution  by  ongoing  and  committed  projects  is  $237 million.  The  most \nsignificant  projects  that  contribute  directly  to  the  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  efforts  are \nNECORD  and  Loans  2043/2044-SRI:  Conflict  Affected  Areas  Rehabilitation  Project  (CAARP). \nThe  efficiency  and  development  impact  of  the NECORD  Project  has  encouraged bilateral  and \nmultilateral  agencies  to  complement  the  project  by  providing  additional  financial  and  technical \nresources  for  new  or  expanded  activities,  which  to  date  amount  to  about  $25 million.  This \nadditional  funding\u2014approved  or  under  processing\u2014has  come  from  the  Netherlands  for \n\n                                                 \n6  Districts  of  Ampara,  Batticaloa,  Jaffna,  Kilinochchi,  Mannar,  Mullaittivu,  Trincomalee,  Vavuniya.  A  synopsis  of \n\nthese districts is attached as Appendix 4.  \n\n\f4\n\n \n\n \n \n\nLessons Learned \n\neducation,  agriculture,  and  IDP  resettlement  grants;  Norway  and  Finland  for  the  crucial \nKilinochchi  hospital;  and  the  European  Union  for  provincial  and  rural  roads.  In  addition,  the \nWorld  Bank  has  made  use  of  the  project\u2019s  management  and  financial  systems  to  channel \n$15 million in resettlement grants to about 57,000 IDP families.  \n \nC. \n \n12. \nThe  NECORD  Project  is  recognized  for  (i) its  preparedness  to  respond  quickly  and \nflexibly; (ii) its focus on restoring facilities; (iii) ADB\u2019s supervision during implementation, as the \nproject  places  a  heavy  burden  on  executing  agency  and  implementing  agency  (IA)  staff;  and \n(iv) support  through  equally  rapid  action  by  the  Government.  Lessons  learned  from  NECORD \naffirm  that  (i) beneficiary  participation  must  be  ensured  during  project  preparation  and \nimplementation;  (ii) environment  and  social  aspects  should  be  considered  during  project \nimplementation, even though the need for rapid response may not permit a detailed treatment of \nthese issues prior to the approval of the assistance; (iii) arrangements for disbursements should \ngive  ready  and  uncomplicated  access  to  funds;  (iv) focusing  on  physical  infrastructure  alone \nreduces  the  project  value,  therefore  broader  issues  of  assisting  communities  with  regaining  a \nproductive life should be included; (v) the adopted approach should permit flexible adjustment of \nproject  design  during  implementation,  as  security  and  IDP  movements  require;  (vi) criteria  for \nsubproject  selection  should  permit  simple  prioritization  and  short  implementation  periods  but \nmust  ensure  a  balance  among  communities  and  maximum  benefits  for  the  community; \n(vii) there  is  a  need  for  close  and  frequent  monitoring  to  ensure  transparency  and  facilitate \nimplementation;  and  (viii) there  is  a  need  to  coordinate  the  large  number  of  government  and \nexternally  assisted  rehabilitation  programs  in  the  affected  areas.  The  Project,  which  will  be \nimplemented  through  the  administrative  systems  established  and  operating  under  NECORD, \nhas been carefully formulated to reflect each of these lessons learned. In addition, reflecting a \nlesson learned  from  the  close international  aid  agency  coordination  in  rehabilitation  programs, \nand the need to provide a linkage between aid agency assistance and the peace process, the \nProject will be implemented within the framework of the Tokyo Declaration (para. 4).  \n \nD. \n \nThe Project was formulated during the midterm review of NECORD, which undertook a \n13. \nreview of all requirements and safeguard policies also applicable to the Project at that time. The \nProject  is  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy,7  which  recognizes  that \npeace  is  the  key  to  reducing  conflict-related  poverty;  peace  is  one  of  the  six  pillars  of  the \nstrategy.  The  Government's  policy  on  relief  and  rehabilitation  aims  to  bring  the  population \naffected  by  the  conflict  back  to  productive  life  by  providing  basic  amenities  to  create  a \nphysically,  economically,  and  socially  sustainable  environment  for  their  reintegration.  Also  the \nProject is in line with the Poverty Partnership Agreement8 between the Government and ADB, \nwhich  states  that  ADB  will  assist  in  addressing  conflict-related  poverty.  The  Country  Strategy \nand Program for Sri Lanka 2004\u201320089 supports the Government's efforts in rehabilitating and \nreconstructing  the  conflict-affected  areas.  During  the  Tokyo  Conference  in  June  2003,  ADB \nagain  declared  its  commitment  to  provide  peace-enhancing  assistance  to  Sri  Lanka.

The purpose is to restore basic social infrastructure and community \nservice  needs  in  these  areas.  The  Project  will  support  and  augment  the  Government\u2019s \nrehabilitation and relief efforts already under way in the existing NECORD Project.  \n \nB. \n \nThe  Project  will  address  basic  needs  in  the  conflict-affected  areas  through  health, \n15. \neducation,  agriculture, community,  and  income generation subprojects.  Subprojects  in  each  of \nthese  sectors  will  be  selected  and  formulated  in  response  to  requests  from  conflict-affected \npersons  and  the  Government.  Restoration  activities  will  focus  on  medium-scale  subprojects \ndesigned to bridge community development with broader district-level improvements. For these \ntypes  and  scale  of  subprojects,  land  mine  and  unexploded  ordnance  contamination  is  not \nexpected  to  be  substantial;  many  proposed  subproject  sites,  which  were  destroyed  during  the \nconflict, have already been cleared. However, provisions for obtaining clearance certification of \nsubproject sites will be incorporated into each civil works contract. A list of potential subprojects \nis presented in Appendix 5.  \n \n\n1. \n\nHealth \n\n \n16. \nThe  health  sector  component  will  include  replacement  and  rehabilitation  of  health \nfacilities  and  hospitals  destroyed  or  in  serious  disrepair.  During  preparation  of  NECORD,  a \ndetailed analysis of the health system in the North East was undertaken, which identified a list of \nhospital  and  health  centers  requiring  reconstruction  and  refurbishment.  In  most  instances, \nparticularly for larger medical facilities, master plans had to be prepared prior to construction. As \na result, and due to needs exceeding available resources under the NECORD project, several \nof  these  key  health  facilities  still  require  rehabilitation.  The  project  scope  of  health  sector \nactivities  will  include  the  restoration  of  critical  referral  medical  facilities  through  hospital \nreconstruction  and  refurbishment,  provision  and  replacement  of  medical  equipment  and \nfurniture,  construction  of  doctors\u2019  quarters  at  hospital  compounds,  and  rehabilitation  of  village \nhealth  clinics.  Although  hospital  staffing  is  generally  satisfactory,  an  essential  subproject \nselection criterion will stipulate sufficient availability of qualified staff to operate the rehabilitated \nfacilities (as well as other existing facilities). Representative health sector subprojects proposed \nfor implementation under the Project include (i) the reconstruction of the Chavakacheri Hospital, \nJaffna  district;  (ii) rehabilitation  and  expansion  of  the  Vavuniya  General  and  Mannar  Base \nhospitals; and (iii) rehabilitation of outpatient development wards in Batticaloa and at the Maha-\noya Base Hospital, Ampara district.  \n \n\n2. \n\nEducation \n\n \n17. \nSubprojects  in  the  education  component  will  restore  education  services  and  facilities \nthrough (i) the reconstruction and rehabilitation of teaching facilities and school buildings serving \n\n\fa  large  population  area,  (ii) construction  of  cluster-housing  units  for  teachers  in  areas  where \nexisting  housing  is  limited  or  unavailable,  and  (iii) provision  of  English-language  training  to \nexisting  teachers.  The  cluster-housing  concept  reflects  a  lesson  learned  from  the  original \nNECORD  project  education  component.  Schools  would  only  be  rehabilitated  if  teachers  were \navailable. Typically they were available, in the sense of being assigned to schools. However, the \nabsence of accommodation in the more remote areas, since most housing had been destroyed, \nmeant  that  their  attendance  was  irregular.  Since  this  problem  did  not  arise  wherever  housing \nwas available, the Project will address this problem by providing simple cluster housing where \nno suitable accommodation is available. Addressing these needs, including the housing issue, \nwill help make schooling a continual and rewarding experience for students and enable them to \nmake up for previous education opportunities lost.  \n \n\n3. \n\nIncome Generation, Capacity Building, and Social Cohesion \n\n \n18. \nThis combined component of the Project will address several sectors through a variety of \nsubprojects  that  restore  livelihoods,  provide  opportunities  for  income  generation,  and  support \nreconciliation  and  social  cohesion.  Livelihood  opportunities  will  be  provided  in  the  agricultural \nand  fisheries  sectors  through  subprojects  that  promote  livestock  development  and  market \ngardening,  provide  facilities  for  seed  production,  and  establish  inland  aquaculture  and  fish-\nbreeding  programs.  A  master  plan  for  phased  construction  will  be  prepared  to  reestablish  the \nfaculty  of  agriculture  of  the  University  of  Jaffna  in  Kilinochchi,  subject  to  further  review \nconfirming  availability  of  staff  and  operation  and  maintenance  funding.  Construction  of  key \ncomponents,  including  provision  for  student  and  faculty  housing,  will  promote  education  and \ntraining in the agriculture sector. Restoration of district agriculture centers will help assist rural \nfarmers.  Skills  development  and  service  training  will  also  be  provided  for  microenterprise \ndevelopment  in  areas  such  as  horticulture,  postharvest  food  processing,  and  the  tourism  and \nhotel industry.  \n \nCapacity building in the conflict-affected areas will be improved through subprojects that \n19. \nprovide staff quarters for government employees in areas where accommodations are difficult to \nfind or unavailable. Adequate housing will attract and retain greater numbers of quality staff into \nthe North East, particularly into the areas hardest hit by the conflict.  \n \n20. \nAs  an  example  of  the  Project\u2019s  focus  on  reconciliation,  the  cultural  hall  in  Vavuniya\u2014\nstrategically situated at the crossroads of the north and east\u2014will be restored. Although the cost \nis  small,  the  facility  and  others  like  it  will  assist  in  reconciliation  of  the  area\u2019s  three  ethnic \ncommunities and will provide residents and visitors with the opportunity to celebrate their culture \nand traditions away from reminders of the conflict.  \n \n21. \nThe  conflict  also  left  a  high  percentage  of  female-headed  households,  particularly  in \nfishing  and  agricultural  communities.  Specific  training  programs  will  focus  on  female-headed \nhouseholds  in  these  areas.  In  addition,  prototype  programs  will  be  developed  to  guide  and \nassist  vulnerable  women\u2019s  group\u2019s,  such  as  fishers\u2019  war  widows  in  establishing  income \ngenerating  enterprises,  ancillary  units,  and  cooperatives  in  a  secure  environment.  Lessons \nlearned from these prototype programs will be applied on a larger scale in follow-on projects in \nthe North East.  \n \nC. \n \n22. \nThe  Project  has  been  formulated  to  address  especially  urgent  basic  needs  and  social \nservices  lost  as  a  result  of  the  20-year  conflict.  Over  the  last  two  decades,  the  project  area \n\nSpecial Features \n\n6\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nserved as a battleground of ethnic and communal tensions that led to the destruction of physical \nassets  and  erosion  of  human  capacity.  For  a  return  to  normal  life  in  the  area,  social  services \nmust  be  restored,  destroyed  infrastructure  must  be  rebuilt,  and  access  to  employment \nopportunities must be made available; the people must see a rapid and visible peace dividend \nas  a  reason  not  to  return  to  conflict.  The  Project  is  therefore  being  processed  and  will  be \nimplemented expeditiously. Under ADB\u2019s procedures for providing rehabilitation assistance after \ndisasters,  guidelines  can  be  flexibly  interpreted  in  order  to  commence  activities  promptly.  The \nprocedures  for  project  loan  processing,  procurement,  consultant  engagement,  subproject \nselection,  and  the  type  of  works  to  be  done  reflect  this  flexibility,  without  sacrificing  quality, \ntransparency,  and  safeguards.  However,  extra  effort  and  time  will  be  taken  to  provide  proper \ntargeting  and  adequate  subproject  control  and  monitoring,  to  ensure  community  participation \nand to address area resource capacity constraints.  \n \n23. \nThe Project will introduce specific strategies to help change the perceptions and realities \nof women in the conflict-affected areas as victims and war widows. While seeking to reduce the \npoverty  levels  of  women,  the  Project  will  also  design  specific  measures  to  uplift  the  status  of \nwomen  in  society.  Subprojects  will  be  developed  to  promote  the  advancement  of  women \nthrough economic activities that will empower them to control and manage their own resources \nin  a  sustainable  manner.  Case  studies  for  development  and  implementation  of  prototype \nprograms  will  be  undertaken  in  two  fishing  areas  that  have  a  high  number  of  female-headed \nhouseholds to help establish replicable women\u2019s industrial centers. Lessons learned from these \nprototype programs will be applied in follow-on projects in the North East for wider development \nof these women\u2019s industrial centers. Consultant guidance and assistance will be provided, first \nto  assess  and  develop  the  programs,  then  to  serve  as  catalysts  for  establishing  the  centers; \nbeneficiary women\u2019s groups themselves will undertake the majority of the work involved in the \nformation and establishment of these prototype centers. By providing a secure environment to \nconduct such activities, these pilot centers will also create an enabling environment to promote \nwomen\u2019s  confidence  and  entrepreneurship.  Thus,  the  Project  will  be  instrumental  in  starting  a \nprocess  of  uplifting  the  status  of  women  in  the  conflict  zones  from  positions  of  vulnerability  to \nthat of economic independence and stability. The Project will build on existing networks, namely \nthe district women's rural development societies and involve the cooperation of women\u2019s NGOs \nto be identified at the implementation stage. The process of delivering the prototype programs is \noutlined in Appendix 6.  \n \nD. \n \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $14.3 million,  comprising  $5.5 million  (38%)  in \n24. \nforeign  exchange  and  $8.8 million  equivalent  (62%)  in  local  currency  costs.  A  summary  cost \nestimate  is  shown  in  Table  1.

The \nProject\u2019s  loan  agreement  addresses  this  by  referring  to  successor  entities  and  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB. \n \n27. \nThe Project will be implemented using the same process approach and follow the same \nimplementation arrangements already in place\u2014and working quite successfully\u2014on NECORD \nas described below: \n \n\nThe Governor of the Northern and Eastern provinces will be the overall coordinator \nfor  the  Project,  in  particular  managing  the  critical  interaction  between  provincial \nauthorities and the security services.  \n\nThe Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government (MPCLG) or its successor \nentity, acceptable to ADB, will be the Executing Agency.  \n\nThe North East Provincial Council (NEPC) under direction of the chief secretary will \nbe the IA, acting through its provincial departments and agencies.  \n\nThe  National  Project  Coordination  Committee  (NPCC)  will  be  chaired  by  the \nsecretary of MPCLG and will include representatives of the ministries responsible for \nrehabilitation in the project area, as well as the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry \nof  Finance;  line  ministries  including  Health,  Education,  Agriculture;  the  project \ndirector;  and  others  as  appropriate.  The  chief  secretary  of  NEPC  will  also  be  a \nmember  of  NPCC.  ADB  and  the  German  Government\u2019s  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr \nTechnische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ), which have provided a team of international and \ndomestic  specialists \nthe \nadministration  of  NECORD,  will  be  represented  on  NPCC.  Among  other \nresponsibilities, NPCC will (a) review subprojects approved by the Provincial Project \nCoordination  Committee  (PPCC)  ensuring  that  these  comply  with  the  subproject \nselection  criteria,  and  are  distributed  appropriately  among  communities  and  areas; \n(b) monitor  overall  project \nimplementation \nproblems,  in  particular  those  related  to  access  of  personnel,  equipment,  and \nmaterials  into  the  project  area;  and  (d) provide  top  level  coordination  with  other \nnational  government  agencies  and  projects  involved  in  relief  and  rehabilitation. \nNPCC will meet as required, but at least quarterly.  \n\nthe  project  management  unit  (PMU) \n\nimplementation;  (c) resolve  serious \n\nto  assist \n\nin \n\nPPCC will be chaired by the chief secretary of NEPC and will include the government \nagents for the districts making up the project area, representatives of the provincial \ndepartments  relevant  to  the  Project,  the  security  forces,  the  project  director,  the \nleader  of  the  GTZ  management  team,  a  representative  of  ADB,  and  others  as \nappropriate. PPCC will meet on a regular basis, but not less than quarterly. Meetings \ngenerally will be held in Trincomalee, but from time to time in other district capitals. \nAmong other responsibilities, PPCC will (a) review and approve subprojects ensuring \nthat  these  are  distributed  appropriately  among  communities  and  areas;  (b)  monitor \nimplementation of the approved subprojects; (c) resolve implementation problems, in \nparticular  those  related  to  access  of  personnel,  equipment,  and  materials  into  the \n\n\f10\n\n \n\n(vi) \n\nproject  area;  and  (d) coordinate  with  other  agencies  and  projects  involved  in  relief \nand rehabilitation. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  existing  PMU  under  NECORD  established  in \nTrincomalee will be appropriately strengthened and maintained for the duration of the \nProject to allow the PMU to perform its obligations under the Project. The PMU will \nbe headed by the project director, who will have direct responsibility for implementing \nthe Project, through the existing provincial and central government sector agencies, \nand for ensuring that the essential balances among communities are monitored and \nmaintained.  The  PMU  will  manage  and  coordinate  subprojects  through  existing \nstructures and procedures at the provincial, district, and division levels. PMU will act \nas the secretariat for NPCC and PPCC. The PMU may engage suitably qualified and \nacceptable international and domestic NGOs for management of specific activities in \nthe  Project  in  accordance  with  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  District  project \nmanagement units (DPMUs) established in each district under NECORD will closely \nmonitor  the  implementation  of  district  subprojects  and  report  to  the  PMU.  A  deputy \nproject  director,  who  will  directly  implement  smaller-scale  subprojects  at  the  district \nand divisional levels, will head each DPMU.  \n\n(vii)  District-level  project  organizations  will  make  use  of  the  existing  structures  of  the \nGovernment  to  the  extent  possible,  including  district  coordination  committees.  The \ngovernment  agents  will  act  as  secretaries  to  these  committees  and  provide  initial \nscreening of subproject proposals prior to their submission to PMU and PPCC. The \nproject organization in each district will be headed by a deputy project director, and \nwill take direct responsibility for implementing the Project at the district and division \nlevels.  \n\n \n28. \nThe February 2004 midterm review of the NECORD Project confirmed that the PMU and \nthe  DPMUs  would  be  able  to  manage  the  additional  workload  at  current  staffing  levels. \nHowever,  given  the  likelihood  of  similar  follow-on  projects  and  the  potential  for  additional \nfunding for other external sources of assistance, the need may arise for additional project staff. \nThe Government agreed to provide the PMU and the IA with additional staff if required, as part \nof the Government\u2019s contribution to the Project.  \n \n29. \nThe scope of the GTZ-provided technical assistance was modified somewhat during the \nNECORD project midterm review; the technical assistance, which has been particularly effective \nfor the Community Development component of the NECORD Project, will provide wider support \nthrough the NEPC in areas such as planning, human resource development, and monitoring on \nany projects ongoing in the North East, with a focus on impact monitoring, capacity building, and \nsustainability. The GTZ assistance will be available to the Project as needed on a preferential \nbasis.  \n \n30. \nGiven  the  complexity  and  sensitivity  of  the  Project  and  the  need  for  close  coordination \nwith  the  actors  in  the  North  East\u2014Government,  LTTE,  external  assistance  agencies,  NGOs, \nand  others\u2014the  Project  will  be  administered  through  ADB\u2019s  Sri  Lanka  Resident  Mission  in \nColombo, as is presently the case for the NECORD and CAARP projects.  \n \n\n2. \n\nSelection and Approval of Subprojects \n\n \n31. \nSubprojects  will  be  selected  to  ensure  equitable  distribution  of  rehabilitation  activities \nacross all the affected districts\u2014taking into account geographic and sector balances along with \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nthe  ethnic  composition  of  the  project  area\u2014to  maximize  benefits  in  the  affected  areas  and, \nequally important, to not contribute to the intercommunal tensions that initially led to the conflict. \nThe subproject selection process will also reflect the need to link assistance to progress in the \npeace process (para. 4). Subprojects will be identified and selected in accordance with sector-\nspecific  criteria  agreed  upon  by  the  Government  and  ADB,  as  presented  in  Appendix 5.  In \naddition, regardless of the sector, each subproject proposal will be selected on the basis of the \nfollowing general criteria:  \n \n\nThe subproject will rehabilitate or reconstruct the conflict-damaged infrastructure, \nand/or directly address the requirements of the conflict-affected people.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe subproject will be identified and prioritized based on the needs assessment \n(footnote  3),  and  will  be  further  selected  and  designed  taking  beneficiary \nconsultations into account.  \n\nThe  subproject  reflects  the  requirement  for  a  reasonable  balance  of  activities \namong communities and districts in the Project area.  \n\nThe  subproject  will  not  be  financed  by  another  aid  agency,  unless  the  other \nagency and ADB are cofinancing it.  \n\nThe  subproject  must  be  technically  feasible  and  represent  the  least-cost \nalternative, taking into account the need to provide for a reasonable increase in \ndemand in the future.  \n\n(vi) \n\nThe  equipment,  materials,  and  other  resources  required  can  be  acquired  in,  or \ntransported to, the subproject location without unreasonable obstruction or delay.  \n\n(vii) \n\nThe subproject can be completed within the Project implementation period.  \n\n(viii)  The  subproject \n\nis \n\nin  compliance  with \n\nthe  Government's  environmental \nrequirements  and  ADB's  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental \nAssessment  Guidelines  (2003)  as  well  as  its  Environmental  Guidelines  for \nSelected  Infrastructure  Development  Projects  and  the  agreed  Environmental \nAssessment  Framework  (Appendix  11).  For  subprojects  that  require  an  initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE), the IEE is included in the subproject proposal, \nand  government  environmental  clearance  is  obtained  prior  to  the  award  of  the \nsubproject contract.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(ix) \n\nThe subproject will not involve any land acquisition or involuntary resettlement. If \neither  of  these  is,  in  fact,  required,  in  the  course  of  the  Project,  it  will  be \nconducted in accordance with the Government\u2019s applicable laws and regulations, \nthe  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995),  ADB\u2019s  Handbook  on \nResettlement:  A  Guide  to  Good  Practice  (1998),  and  the  agreed  resettlement \nframework (Appendix 8).  \n\n \n32. \nSubproject proposals will be prepared by the IA in formats agreed between the Borrower \nand ADB. The subproject proposals will be reviewed, prioritized, and approved, by PPCC during \nits regular meetings. The PMU will be responsible for establishing the necessary management \ninformation  system  to  track  subprojects  through  their  preparation,  submission,  approval, \nimplementation,  and  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  stages.  The  system  also  tracks  critical \n\n\fethnic  community  and  regional  balances  in  allocation  of  subprojects.  Details  of  the  subproject \nselection process are provided in Appendix 9.  \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n33. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  2.5-year  period,  ending  concurrently  with  the \nongoing  NECORD  Project  on  31  December  2006  (Appendix 10).  With  NECORD  project \nadministration  systems  already  well  founded  and  fully  functioning,  minimal  time  will  be \nnecessary  to  commence  implementation  of  the  Project\u2019s  subprojects.  The  capacity  of  the \nvarious implementing departments and the nascent construction industry has begun to evolve\u2014\nin  part  through  the  NECORD  subprojects  already  completed\u2014but  the  need  for  continued \ncapacity  building  remains.  To  ensure  an  on-schedule  completion,  subprojects  will  be  small \nscale,  although  generally  larger  than  typical  subprojects  already  implemented  through \nNECORD, and will have construction periods of less than 2 years. Contractor capacity has also \nrecently been strengthened through a series of construction and contracting seminars presented \nby GTZ and ADB through NECORD in each of the eight project districts.  \n \n\n4. \n\nSocial and Environmental Measures \n\nland  will  be  used \n\n \n34. \nAs  it  is  for  NECORD,  the  Project  will  not  require  land  acquisition  or  resettlement;  only \nimprovements.  Reconstruction  and \nvacant  state-owned \nfor  project \nrehabilitation  will  generally  take  place  at  existing  infrastructure  locations.  The  works  will  be \ndesigned  to  ensure  that  improvements  will  be  within  existing  property  boundaries.  Cluster-\nhousing  units  for  teachers  will  be  located  at  or  adjacent  to  existing  education  facilities,  on \ngovernment  land.  However,  to  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policy  requirement  for  a  sector \nloan,  a  resettlement  framework,  as  presented  in  Appendix 8,  has  been  agreed  upon  by  the \nGovernment  and  ADB  to  address  any  possible  adverse  impacts  relating  to  land  acquisition  or \ninvoluntary resettlement. It is unlikely that indigenous peoples will be affected by the Project. In \nthe  event  of  their  involvement  in  any  of  the  subprojects,  all  necessary  actions  required  under \nADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1999) will be taken.  \n \n35. \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  a  category  \u201cB\u201d  project,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002).  The  Project  involves  small-scale  civil  and  building  works  at  sites \npreviously or currently used for the same or similar purposes and is not likely to generate any \nsignificant  environmental  impact.  All  subprojects  will  be  required  to  complete  and  satisfy  an \nenvironmental checklist during formulation. For subprojects located within areas subject to the \nCoast Conservation Act No. 64 of 1988, the Flora and Fauna Project Ordinance of 1937 and as \namended, and the Forest Ordinance of 1907 and as amended, ADB will require that applicable \nenvironmental  clearance  be  obtained  from  the  environmental  concerns  associated  with  the \nrehabilitation  activities.  Recommended  mitigation  measures  will  be \ninto \ncontractors\u2019 work assignments. To ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s environmental policy and with \nthe  Government\u2019s  environmental  requirements,  environmental  assessment  and  review \nprocedures are provided in Appendix 11 to guide the implementation of the Project.  \n \n\nincorporated \n\n5. \n\nProcurement of Civil Works and Equipment \n\n \n36. \nProcurement of goods and services under the Project will be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and the Government\u2019s tender procedures acceptable to \nADB. ADB\u2019s procedures for providing rehabilitation assistance after disasters provide for flexible \ninterpretation of these guidelines, so that project activities can start promptly. Local procurement \nwill be the preferred mode for all project activities because of the relatively short implementation \n\n12\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nperiod, the small size of contract packages, the wide geographic spread of the project sites, and \nthe  need  for  local  awareness  of  security  and  other  frequently  changing  matters  relevant  to \naccessing the project area, in particular where the LTTE controls access. Local procurement will \nbe  restricted  to  private  sector  companies  and  joint  ventures;  state-owned  entities  will  not  be \neligible  to  participate  in  the  project,  either  as  sole  contractors,  joint-venture  partners,  or \nsubcontractors.  \n \n37. \nIt  is  presently  intended  that  none  of  the  Project\u2019s  civil  works  contracts  will  exceed \n$2.5 million  in  cost.  However,  if  this  situation  changes,  civil  works  contracts  with  estimated \nvalues  greater  than  $2.5 million  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  international  competitive \nbidding procedures. Contracts with estimated values of $2.5 million and below will be procured \nin  accordance  with  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB)  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB,  typically \nthose  now  used  for  NECORD.  Contracts  with  estimated  values  less  than  $100,000  will  be \nprocured under LCB using post-facto approval procedures, also typical for NECORD. LCB civil \nworks  procurement  will  include,  where  relevant,  single-stage,  two-envelope  procedures,  and \nbidding periods of at least 21 days.  \n \n38. \nEquipment and materials will be procured under international competitive bidding where \nthe  estimated  cost  is  more  than  $500,000  equivalent,  by  international  shopping  where  the \nestimated  cost  is  between  $300,000  and  $500,000  equivalent,  and  through  local  procurement \nprocedures acceptable to ADB where the estimated cost is $300,000 equivalent or less. Minor \nitems costing less than $100,000 equivalent may be procured through direct purchase.  \n \n39. \nThe  Government  has  requested  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  advance  action  for  procurement  of \ncivil  works,  including  inviting  and  receiving  bids  for  contracts,  for  subprojects  that  might  be \napproved for implementation prior to loan effectiveness. The Government has been advised that \nADB\u2019s approval of advance action would not commit ADB to financing the Project.  \n \n\n6. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n40. \nThe  existing  consultants  for  NECORD,  who  are  providing  procurement  and  contract \nmanagement  support,  and  training  of  domestic  agencies,  will  extend  their  services  through \ndirect selection to cover the additional requirements of the Project. For new services, primarily \nfor the preparation of master plans and bid documents for larger subprojects, particularly in the \nhealth sector, consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of \ndomestic  consultants.  Consultants  will  be  provided  individually  and  through  firms;  quality  and \ncost-based  selection  procedures  will  be  used  in  the  recruitment  of  consulting  firms.  Individual \nconsultants  will  also  be  fielded  to  assist  in  the  preparation  of  gender-oriented  economic \nactivities and business cooperatives. The Project will require approximately 350 person-months \nof  domestic  consulting  services.  Sample  outline  terms  of  reference  for  potential  consultant \nassignments are provided in Appendix 12.  \n \n41. \nThe  Government  has  requested  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  advance  action  for  recruitment  of \nconsultants,  including  preparing  and  negotiating  direct  selection  contracts  with  consultants \nalready  installed  on  NECORD.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that  ADB\u2019s  approval  of \nadvance action would not commit ADB to financing the Project.  \n \n\n\f7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n42. \nLoan disbursements will be made through procedures similar to those used in NECORD \nand  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook,  as  amended  from  time  to  time, \nand with detailed arrangements between the Government and ADB. For larger contracts, direct \npayment and commitment letter procedures will be used. For other activities, an imprest account \nwill be established at the Central Bank with MPCLG, which in turn will fund a second-generation \nimprest account (SGIA) at the province level, to be operated by NEPC. The initial amount to be \ndeposited  into  these  imprest  accounts  will  not  exceed  the  equivalent  of  6  month\u2019s  estimated \nexpenditure, or $800,000, whichever is less. Third-generation imprest accounts (TGIAs) will be \nestablished by the NEPC at the district level at banks to be agreed by the Government and ADB \nfor each district, and operated by the respective DPMUs. The initial amount to be deposited into \neach  TGIA  will  not  exceed  the  equivalent  of  6  month\u2019s  estimated  expenditure,  or  $100,000, \nwhichever is less. The SGIA and TGIAs are necessary as implementation of the Project will be \nat  the  provincial  and  district  levels.  Through  their  successful  management  of  NECORD\u2019s \nfinances, the agencies at all three levels have the resources and experience to manage Project \nfunding effectively.  \n \n43. \nThe imprest accounts, SGIA and TGIAs will be established, managed, replenished, and \nliquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, and detailed arrangements \nagreed to by the Government and ADB. Statement of expenditures (SOE) procedures may be \nused  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures  and  to  liquidate  advances  made  into  the  imprest \naccounts,  the  SGIA  and  the  TGIAs  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook. \nAny  individual  payment  to  be  reimbursed  or  liquidated  under  statement  of  expenditure \nprocedures will not exceed the equivalent of $50,000.  \n \n44. \nThe PMU will be responsible for monitoring accounts, including monthly reconciliation of \nthe accounts and preparation of the withdrawal applications for liquidation or replenishment of \nthe  imprest  account.  Financial  performance  of  the  PMU  for  NECORD  has  been  satisfactory, \nhaving processed contracts for nearly 500 separate subprojects to date.  \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n45. \nThe  MPCLG,  NEPC,  and  PMU,  as  they  are  doing  now  for  NECORD,  will  maintain \nseparate  records  and  accounts  adequate  to  identify  financing  resources  received  and \nexpenditures made on the Project, including the goods, works, and services financed out of the \nloan proceeds and out of local funds. These project accounts and related financial statements \nwill be audited annually in accordance with sound auditing standards by auditors acceptable to \nADB.  The  Government  will  submit  annual  audited  reports  and  related  financial  statements  to \nADB  within  12  months  after  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year;  compliance  of  audit  submissions  for \nNECORD has been satisfactory. The audit of imprest accounts and statements of expenditures \nwill be carried out as part of the annual audit, with the auditor\u2019s opinion of that part separately \nset out in the auditor\u2019s report. Independent audit, if required, is provided for in the project costs.  \n \nThe  PMU  presently  prepares  brief  progress  reports  for  NECORD  each  month.  Project \n46. \nactivities  will  be  similarly  reported  in  separate  monthly  reports.  Subproject  completion  reports, \nwhich  identify  project  impact,  will  be  prepared  for  each  subproject.  Within  3  months  of  the \nphysical  completion  of  the  Project,  the  Government  will  furnish  to  ADB  an  overall  project \ncompletion  report  providing  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  project  design,  costs,  contractor  and \nconsultant performance, social and economic impact, and other details as may be requested by \nADB.  \n\n14\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15\n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n47. \nThe  management  information  system  developed  for  NECORD\u2014in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Project  Performance  Management  System  Handbook\u2014will  be  used  to  monitor \nsubproject  benefits  and  impacts.  Baseline  indicators  and  targets  for  each  subproject  will  be \ndeveloped  prior  to  implementation  for  monitoring  purposes  as  well  as  for  checking  against \nselection  criteria.  The  outputs  of  the  system  will  provide  major  inputs  to  the  Project\u2019s  monthly \nprogress reporting.  \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n \nThe  Project  will  have  regular  reviews  by  the  staff  of  Sri  Lanka  Resident  Mission, \n48. \nincluding  attendance  at  PPCC  meetings \nfor \nimplementation.  However,  as  the  Project  was  formulated  during  the  midterm  review  of \nNECORD\u2014which reviewed all requirements and safeguard policies at that time\u2014and given the \nrelatively  short  implementation  period,  no  midterm  review  will  be  conducted,  unless  deemed \nnecessary  by  ADB  and  the  EA.

Basic \nfacilities have to be restored if the affected communities are to recover from the effects of the \nconflict and begin the long climb toward development that has been available to the rest of the \ncountry  during  the  past  two  decades.  Rehabilitation  that  has  taken  place  to  date  remains \ninadequate  in  the  face  of  the  immense  destruction  caused.  A  summary  poverty  reduction  and \nsocial strategy is provided as Appendix 13.  \n \n50. \nThe  Project  will  address  the  urgent  needs  of  a  population  of  approximately  2 million, \nconsisting  in  large  part  of  the  physically  disabled,  female-headed  households,  and  children. \nThese  people  are  now  beginning  to  rebuild  their  lives  in  areas  that  have  seen  serious \ndestruction  and  lengthy  neglect.  Through  the  restoration  of  sectors  that  form  the  backbone  of \nthe economy of the North East, the Project serves as a channel that brings about normalcy to \nthe  lives  of  the  affected  communities  and  assists  in  stabilizing  the  economic  basis  of  those \naffected  by  the  conflict,  reducing  their  dependency  on  government  support  and  securing  a \nsustainable livelihood. The Project makes significant interventions in the health sector through \naddressing  immediate  and  long-term  needs  of  the  communities  that  have  been,  and  are  still, \ndenied basic health needs. School buildings alone will not suffice in areas that are isolated and \nlack  facilities.  Given  that  education  is  of  paramount  importance  for  restoring  normalcy  and \nsecurity,  particularly  to  children,  specific  subproject  interventions  that  encourage  teachers  to \nreside in the locality of the school will make schooling a continual experience for students and \nenable students to make up for previous education opportunities lost.  \n \nThe  Project  focuses  on  restoring  preexisting  facilities  with  appropriate  provision  for \n51. \ntechnical  improvement  and  future  demand,  based  on  a  least-cost  approach.  After  years  of \nneglect  and  damage  to  administrative  capacities,  with  32%  of  administrative  posts  currently \n\n\f16\n\n \n\nPeace and Conflict Risks \n\nvacant and 60% of buildings belonging to administration and local authorities either destroyed or \ndamaged,  project  interventions  focus  not  only  on  the  physical  rehabilitation  of  damaged \ninfrastructure  but  also  on  the  restoration  of  uninterrupted  high-quality  administrative  and \ntechnical services in the area.  \n \n52. \nThere is an important need to create an environment conducive for vulnerable groups of \nwomen in the conflict areas so they may become economically independent. Despite significant \nfunding channeled toward microenterprise development for women in the conflict zone, to date \nthere  are  no  visible  cohesive  mechanisms  that  work  toward  uplifting  the  status  of  women  as \nindependent contributors to the economy; their situation remains vulnerable and insecure, and \nthe  Project  is  sensitive  to  this  need.  In  addition,  in  a  climate  of  competition  and  resentment \nwhen  whole  communities  are  beginning  to  rebuild  their  lives,  a  mechanism  is  needed  to \nencourage  a  more  harmonious  social  climate  and  reduce  communal  tensions,  suspicion,  and \nhostility.  Recognizing  this,  the  Project  will  promote  opportunities  to  foster  peace  among  the \nthree different ethnic communities.  \n \nB. \n \n53. \nThe  peace  and  conflict  impact  assessment  is  provided  in  Appendix 14.  Reflecting  the \nlinkage between aid agency assistance and progress in the peace process (para. 4), there is a \nrisk that, should the peace process falter, the Project\u2019s scope and schedule may require review. \nHowever, given the recently restated commitment of the Government and the LTTE to resume \npeace talks, and the robustness of the peace process itself\u2014despite recent political and other \nuncertainties, it remains intact and the cease-fire agreed to in 2002 continues to be observed\u2014\nthis  risk  is  assessed  to  be  small.  On  condition  that  the  beneficial  outcomes  are  shared \nsufficiently equitably among the major ethnic groups and across the target area, the Project is \nnot expected to contribute to an intensification of social tensions. The relatively small scale and \nlocal  nature  of  activities  appears  to  make  them  unlikely  to  be  captured  by  elite  or  sectarian \ninterests. Beyond just \u201cdoing no harm,\u201d the Project can potentially make a positive contribution \nto  the  rebuilding  of  key  infrastructure  and  help  to  make  existing  infrastructure\u2014schools,  for \nexample\u2014more  effective  in  strengthening  the  socioeconomic  fabric  of  the  conflict-affected \nareas.  The  challenge  will  be  in  implementing  these  activities  in  a  conflict-sensitive  manner, \nensuring that:  \n \n\nsubprojects are selected to ensure an ethnic balance that reasonably reflects the \ngeneral ethnic composition of the area;  \n\nall  major  stakeholders,  including  the  LTTE,  are  consulted  regarding  the  final \nchoice of subprojects;  \n\nrigorous measures are applied to limit the possibility of corruption in construction \nwork diverting resources to local, subnational, or national elites; and \n\nall activities are characterized by transparency, so that the relevant stakeholders \nunderstand the project criteria and how the Project is progressing.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n54. \nassurances, which have been incorporated into the legal documents.  \n \n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \n\nThe Government will ensure that project staff, materials, vehicles, equipment and \nall  other  items  required  for  the  implementation  of  the  Project  will  be  given \nreasonable access to the project area.  \n\nThe Government will continue its program of filling teacher vacancies, particularly \nin the Tamil language, and will ensure that teachers are available when required \nto staff the schools that are rehabilitated or improved with project assistance.  \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that,  for  training,  extension,  and  similar  facilities \nwhere construction or rehabilitation of buildings is required, (i) staffing is available \nand  requires  only  the  completion  of  the  facility  for  training  to  commence,  and \n(ii) staff so trained will not be reassigned out of the project area.  \n\nThe Government will ensure that adequate counterpart funds are made available \nto the Project when and in the amount required to enable the project agencies to \ndischarge their responsibilities under the Project.  \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  facilities  provided  under  the  Project  are \noperated  and  maintained  appropriately,  and  that  adequate  budgetary  and  other \nresources will be provided for this purpose. The Government will also ensure that \ncommunity-based organizations charged with operating and maintaining facilities \nprovided under the Project are provided with the support and training required to \nundertake these activities.  \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  all  project  interventions  contribute  to  peace \nbuilding and community reconciliation. In the event that any intervention is having \nor  is  thought  to  have  a  negative  impact  on  peace-building  and  reconciliation \nefforts,  the  Government  agrees  that  ADB  will  have  the  discretion  to  determine \nwhether  the  intervention  should  be  continued,  redesigned,  suspended,  or \ncanceled.  \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\nin \n\nthe  present  government \nThe  project  management  arrangements  reflect \nadministration  structure \nthat  may  change  during \nthe  North  East \nimplementation.  The  Government  will  immediately  notify  ADB  of  any  proposed \nchange  in  the  administrative  structure  in  the  project  areas,  and  take  all  steps \nnecessary  to  ensure  that  the  project  management  arrangements  are  revised  in \nconsultation with ADB to reflect the new administrative structure and protect the \nviability of the Project. The Government will take all steps necessary and within \nits  power  to  ensure  than  any  successor  project  management  entities  enter  into \nsuch project or other agreements with ADB as ADB may request.  \n\n \n(viii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  adequate  environmental  mitigation  measures, \nin  accordance  with  (a) the  Government\u2019s  environmental  regulations  and \n(b) ADB's  Environment  Policy  (2002),  Environmental  Guidelines  for  Selected \n\n\fincorporated \n\n(2003),  are \n\nInfrastructure  Development  Projects  and  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines \ninto  all  subproject  designs  and \nimplementation.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  agreed  environmental \nassessment  framework  (Appendix 11)  is  implemented;  that  all  subprojects  for \nwhich an IEE is required include such an IEE in the subproject proposal; and that \nall subprojects for which government environmental clearance is required obtain \nsuch clearance prior to the award of any contracts for that subproject. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that,  to  the  extent  possible,  subprojects  will  not \nrequire  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement.  In  the  event  that  land \nacquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement  is  required  for  any  subproject,  then  the \nGovernment  will  prepare  a \nthe \nGovernment\u2019s  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement  (1995),  ADB\u2019s  Handbook  on  Resettlement:  A  Guide  to  Good \nPractice (1998), the resettlement framework (Appendix 8), and submitted to ADB \nfor review and approval before any land acquisition is initiated.  \n\nin  accordance  with \n\nresettlement  plan \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that,  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Policy  on  Gender \nand Development (1998), (a) project interventions take into account the different \nimpacts  and  needs  of  women  and  men;  (b) special  features  are  built  into \nsubprojects  to  facilitate  and  encourage  women\u2019s  involvement  and  to  ensure \ntangible  benefits  to  women;  (c) specific  women-related  interventions  include \nactivities that uplift women from situations of vulnerability to positions of stability; \nand (d) project reporting reflects how gender-related needs are being addressed \nby  the  Project,  and  details  the  successes  encountered,  constraints  met,  and \nmeasures adopted to overcome them.  \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  all  ADB-financed  contracts  under  the  Project \ninclude  contractual  clauses  during  design  and  construction  requiring  that  all \nnecessary  steps  be  taken  to  avoid  adverse  consequences  to  the  natural \nenvironment,  prevent  noise  pollution,  environmental  hygiene  related  issues, \nselection  of  sites  for  the  extraction  of  construction  materials,  and  selection  of \nroads for transport of such construction materials. \n\nThe Government will ensure that subprojects will not affect vulnerable population \ngroups, such as indigenous peoples. In the event of their involvement in any of \nthe  subprojects,  the  Government  will  take  all  necessary  actions  required  under \nADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998).  \n\n \n(xiii)  The  Government  and  the  NEPC  will  ensure  that  all  subprojects  meet,  to  the \nimplementation \nsatisfaction  of  ADB, \narrangements  and  that  all  subprojects  are,  to  the  satisfaction  of  ADB,  properly \ncontrolled and monitored.  \n\nthe  agreed  selection  criteria  and \n\nCondition for Loan Effectiveness \n\n \nB. \n \n55. \nBased  on  consultation  with  the  Government,  development  partners,  and  other \nstakeholders,  ADB  shall  have  determined  that  the  peace  process  is  proceeding  in  a  manner \nlikely to maintain the ongoing cease-fire and, over time, to lead to an end to the conflict.  \n \n \n\n \n(ix) \n\n \n(x) \n\n \n(xi) \n\n \n(xii) \n\n18\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n56. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  supplementary  loan  in  various  currencies \nequivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  6,864,000.00  to  the Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri \nLanka  for  the  North  East  Community  Restoration  and  Development  -  Extension  Project  from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with a term of 40 years, including a grace period of 10 years, \nwith repayment of principal at 2% per year for the first 10 years after the grace period and 4% a \nyear thereafter, with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per annum; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan and Project \nAgreements presented to the Board.  \n\n \n \n \nTadao Chino \nPresident \n\n24 May 2004 \n \n \n\n\f20\n\nAppendix 1 \n\nNECORD SUBPROJECT SUMMARY \n\nCommunity Development Subprojects: \n\n \n \n1. \n \nFourteen  villages  and  the  partner  organizations  for  these  villages  have  been  selected. \nWorks  on  trust-building  measures  are  being  implemented  in  14  villages  at  a  total  cost  of \nSLRs5.0 million.

the  North  East \n1. \nCommunity Restoration and Development (NECORD) Project to be used during the process of \nselecting  and  approving  subprojects  for  implementation.  These  criteria  will  be  applied  to  all \nsubprojects presented and considered for approval under the Project.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nAs  the  immediate  need  for  improved  medical  and  health  services  remains  of  foremost \nimportance,  additional  assistance  to  the  health  sector  is  critical  in  the  overall  assistance \nprogram  in  the  north  and  east.  To  help  improve  the  level  of  medical  services  available, \nsubproject  components  will  include  the  restoration  of  larger  medical  facilities  through  hospital \nreconstruction and refurbishment, replacement of medical equipment and furniture, construction \nof doctors\u2019 quarters at hospital compounds, and minor improvements at village health clinics.  \n \n\nHealth \n\n1. \n\nSector Criteria \n\n \nThe  health  component  under  the  Project  includes  rehabilitation  of  hospitals  and \n3. \nprovision  of  equipment,  to  provide  better  access  to  basic  health  facilities.  In  addition  to  the \ngeneral  criteria  requirements  for  considering  subprojects  in  the  health  sector,  the  following \ncriteria will be applied:  \n \n\nPreference will be given to hospitals serving the largest patient population or the \nwidest outreach. \n\nCapacity  will  be  increased  for  hospitals  where  present  capacity  to  meet  basic \nhealth needs is inadequate and when there is confirmation that adequate budget \nis available for the additional staff necessary to operate the expanded facility.  \n\nImprovements  for  larger  medical  facilities  will  follow  phased  construction \naccording to master plans and detailed designs that follow contemporary design \ntrends. \n\nAll  new  equipment  will  be  compatible  with  existing  equipment,  use  appropriate \ntechnology,  and  be  accommodated  under  the  maintenance  resources  available \nin the area. \n\n2. \n\nRepresentative Subprojects \n\nRepresentative health sector subprojects include the following:  \n\n(i) \n\nChavakacheri  Hospital,  Jaffna  district\u2014reconstruction  of  facilities,  which  were \ncompletely  destroyed  in  the  conflict;  makeshift  medical  facilities  are  currently \noperating in the former Ministry of Health administration building adjacent to the \nhospital compound; \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n\n \n4. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5    \n\n29\n\n(ii) \n\nVavuniya  General  Hospital\u2014rehabilitation  and  expansion  of  facilities,  which \nserve 600,000 people in the four-district area, through upgrade of construction of \nbuildings and provision of equipment; \n\n(iii) \n\nMannar  Base  Hospital\u2014rehabilitation  and  expansion,  through  construction  of \nbuildings and provision of equipment; \n\n(iv) \n\nBatticaloa outpatient development (OPD) ward; \n\n(v) \n\nMaha-oya Base Hospital, Ampara district\u2014construction of building for OPD and \nother specialist wards. \n\nPottuvil Hospital, Ampara district\u2014rehabilitation and reconstruction of facilities \n\n(vi) \n \nEducation \n\nC. \n \nThe immediate need for schools and improved educational facilities remains high in the \n5. \nconflict-affected areas. However, with the lack of adequate housing available for teachers, some \nof the schools constructed in more remote district areas have experienced difficulties in locating \nor retaining the necessary teaching staff. To realize the full potential from these reconstructed \nschools, accommodations must also be provided for teachers.  \n \n6. \nThe scope of this component therefore is the rehabilitation of schools and the provision \nof  facilities  that  will  make  schooling  an  uninterrupted  experience  for  conflict-affected  children. \nSubprojects  in  the  education  sector  will  primarily  address  the  immediate  need  to  restore \neducation  services  and  facilities  through  (i) the  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  of  teaching \nfacilities and school buildings serving a large population area, (ii) construction of cluster housing \nunits for teachers in areas where existing housing is limited or unavailable, and (iii) provision of \nEnglish-language training to existing teachers.  \n \n\n1. \n\nSector Criteria \n\n \n7. \neducation sector, the following criteria will be applied: \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  general  criteria  requirements  for  considering  subprojects  in  the \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nCluster  housing  units  will  be  provided  for  schools  in  areas  with  little  available \naccommodation and high teacher vacancies.  \n\nCluster  housing  units  will  be  centrally  located  to  provide  access  to  the  greatest \nnumber of schools in the area.  \n\nPreference  to  be  given  for  rural  schools  and  urban  schools  damaged  or \ndestroyed due to the conflict.  \n\nEducation  sector  improvements  should  not  be  included  in  any  other  ongoing \nfunded project.  \n\n2. \n\nRepresentative Subprojects \n\nRepresentative education sector subprojects include the following: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n8. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5    \n\n30\n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nKilinochchi  Central  College\u2014reconstruct  all  classroom  buildings,  science \nlaboratory, activity rooms at the 1,200-student facility destroyed in the conflict; \n\nCluster housing units\u2014provide housing compounds for teachers in remote areas, \ncentrally located to cater to four to six schools in the area; \n\nEnglish  training  program\u2014assist  in  providing  specialist  training  to  existing \nteachers in using the English language as a teaching medium. \n\nIncome Generation, Capacity Building, and Social Cohesion \n\n \nD. \n \n9. \nSubprojects  in  these  sectors  will  be  developed  to  restore  livelihoods,  provide \nopportunities  for  income  generation,  and  support  reconciliation  and  social  cohesion.  This \ncomponent of the Project will also focus on subprojects that take into consideration the different \nneeds  of  women  and  men  in  the  communities.  Restoring  the  Agriculture  Faculty  University \nFacility  in  Kilinochchi,  subject  to  further  detailed  discussion  with  the  Government  about  the \nsustainability and efficiency of reestablishing a single-purpose faculty of the Jaffna University at \nKilinochchi, will promote education and training in the agriculture sector. Livelihood opportunities \nwill  be  provided  in  the  agricultural  and  fisheries  sectors  through  subprojects  that  promote \nlivestock  development  and  market  gardening,  provide  facilities  for  seed  production,  and \nestablish  inland  aquaculture  and  fish-breeding  programs.  Replacement  of  district  agriculture \ncenters will help assist female and male farmers in rural areas. Skills development and service \ntraining will also be provided without gender bias for microenterprise development in areas such \nas horticulture, postharvest food processing, and the tourist and hotel industry. A cultural hall in \nVavuniya  will  help  with  the  reintegration  of  the  three  ethnic  communities.  Capacity  building  in \nthe  conflict-affected  areas  will  be  improved  through  subprojects  that  provide  staff  quarters  for \ngovernment employees in areas where accommodations are difficult to find or unavailable.  \n \nGiven the wide range of potential subprojects, and considering a sector implementation \n10. \napproach, broad criteria are presented.

In a context where women generally play a \nsubordinate role in society, this has served to further push women into insecure positions.  \n \n2. \nPoverty  levels  in  the  North  East  are  high,  as  high  as  90%  in  certain  areas.  Of  this \npopulation,  women  are  a  majority,  with  an  inordinately  large  number  of  female-headed \nhouseholds.  Women,  who  have  followed  traditional  patterns  of  work  with  the  sole  burden  of \nhousehold care undertaken by them, are conditioned into thinking that they are incapable and \nunsuitable for the role of the head of household. The conflict has forced women to assume the \nrole  of  head  of  household,  albeit  devoid  of  the  confidence,  income  generation  skills,  and  the \nsocietal support and cooperation that must accompany this shift in roles.  \n \n3. \nDaily wage labor rates for women in the North East, except in a few areas and specific \nsectors,  are  lower  than  those  for  men.  Many  women  undertake  traditional  home-based \neconomic activities in order to carry out dual roles of caring for the household as well as earning \nan income. In this work pattern, women do not enjoy the maximum benefits of their efforts, as \nthey often lack the confidence and experience in marketing and selling at higher levels. Cultural \nconditioning and lack of personal security are added factors that limit women, resulting in their \nbeing exploited.  \n \nB. \n \nOverall,  88%  of  the  population  in  the  North  East  is  rural.  Therefore,  at  least  initially, \n4. \nemployment  generation  has  to  come  mainly  from  reviving  and  expanding  rural  economic \nactivities. Considering the fact that women constitute more than half of the population in these \nareas, as in the rest of the country, their capacities have to be built if they were contribute to the \ndevelopment and economy of their communities. Work patterns, attitudes, lack of skills, and lack \nof security have to be dealt with if women are to successfully involve themselves in economic \nactivities, with the ability to access and control their resources and to gain the full profit of their \nendeavor.  \n \n5. \nHuman  security  gains  primacy  in  a  situation  of  conflict,  particularly  for  women.  If \npersonal  security  is  threatened,  economic  activity  cannot  be  undertaken.  For  women  to  be \ninvolved  in  economically  productive  activities,  they  have  to  first  be  provided  with  a  secure \nenvironment in which to work. Further, they need to be trained in specific skills such as trade-\nbased  skills,  management, \nleadership  skills,  and \nawareness on gender issues. Considering the social backdrop that they are placed in, attitudinal \nchanges are needed.  \n \n6. \nIn the 20 years of war, women have been perceived as victims, in vulnerable positions \nsuch  as  \u201cwar  widows.\u201d  In  a  context  of  overall  development,  it  is  time  that  society  and  women \ndefine a more active role for themselves other than positions of vulnerability. They need to be \nactive in decision-making bodies; they need to be seen as visible actors in the peace process. \nGiving  them  strength  in  economic  activities  helps  uplift  them  to  positions  of  economic  stability \nand bargaining power.  \n\ninvestment,  profit-making,  marketing, \n\nAnalysis \n\n\f34\n\nAppendix 6 \n\nSolution \n\nMethodology \n\nC. \n \n7. \nExperience shows that if equitable outcomes are to be achieved, gender dimensions of \nissues  have  to  be  addressed  adequately.  This  initiative  focuses  its  intervention  among  the \nwomen  of  fishing  communities  in  the  North  East  that  have  a  high  number  of  female-headed \nhouseholds,  women  who  have  been  traumatized  by  the  disappearance  or  death  of  male \nmembers  of  their  families.  The  initiative  is  formulated  to  provide  the  secure  environment, \ntraining, confidence, and marketing facilities needed to allow them to become active participants \nand contributors to the economy.  \n \nD. \n \nThe initial phase of this women\u2019s enterprise initiative will be to undertake a case study of \n8. \na  few  areas  severely  affected  by  the  conflict  with  an  aim  of  establishing  a  replicable  model  of \nwomen\u2019s business centers in two districts. Special attention will be paid to the institutional and \nbusiness/marketing  aspects  of  the  area.  Two  individual  consultants  will  conduct  the  case \nstudies in the districts of Jaffna and Mullaittivu in the North. Additional guidance and assistance \nwill  also  be  available  from  the  German  Government\u2019s  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische \nZusammenarbeit  (GTZ)  that  has  provided  a  team  of  international  and  domestic  specialists  to \nassist in NECORD and in the development and administration of other projects implemented in \nthe  North  East.  These  two  women\u2019s  business  centers  will  be  established  as  a  prototype \nprogram;  lessons  learned  from  this  program  will  be  applied  in  the  wider-scale  development  of \nwomen\u2019s  business  centers  in  follow-on  projects  in  the  North  East.  A  key  focus  of  these  case \nstudies  will  be  to  identify  tools  and  strategies  that  will  help  ensure  sustainability  of  such \ninitiatives beyond the life of the Project.  \n \n9. \nIn the case study, the consultant will conduct a participatory needs assessment in these \ncommunities. Direct consultation will be made with the women themselves, especially those in \nfemale-headed households among the fisherfolk, to understand their skills base, constraints in \naccess  to  resources,  and  their  interests  and  management  capacity  in  collective  enterprise \ndevelopment activities. The study will also focus on market outlets for possible products.  \n \nBased on community needs identified in the case study, industries will be proposed and \n10. \nestablished  within  easy  access  of  the  women  in  the  area.  To  assist  women  in  gaining  more \ncontrol  of  businesses,  skills  development  and  training  on  different  aspects  of  management, \ntechnical know-how, marketing and profit-making, leadership, and gender-equity awareness, will \nbe provided under the Project. The Project will build on existing networks, such as the women's \nrural development societies (WRDS) in each district, and elicit cooperation of identified women\u2019s \nNGOs. Initially, a staff of volunteers selected from the WRDS will coordinate activities related to \nthe business  center, with assistance and direction given by the government agents of the two \ndistricts.  Initial  operational  costs  will  be  provided  by  the  Project  along  with  contributions  from \neach WRDS. Profits earned will be ploughed back into the centers. All workers of the center will \nbe  partners  in  this  business-collective  and  will  have  ownership  and  control  over  the \nmanagement of these businesses.  \n \n11. \nThe  center  will  provide  buildings  to  house  the  different  industries  identified  and  an \nadministrative  section.  There  will  also  be  a  community  center  to  hold  training  courses  and \nmeetings.  For  such  an  activity,  the  Project  also  provides  a  secure  setting,  an  enabling \nenvironment  that  brings  out  the  best  in  women\u2019s  entrepreneurship.  The  Project  will  in  some \nmeasure be instrumental in uplifting the status of women in the conflict zones from positions of \nvulnerability to that of economic independence and stability.  \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n35\n\nADB \n\nADB \n\nGoSL \n& Ben. \n\n \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($ million) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nItem \n\nFX \n\nLC \n\nTotal \n\nFX \n\nLC \n\nLC \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1.4 \n\n1.0 \n\n0.9 \n\n1.2 \n\n2.0 \n\n1.4 \n\n2.0 \n\n1.9 \n\n3.4 \n\n2.4 \n\n2.9 \n\n3.1 \n\n1.4 \n\n1.0 \n\n0.9 \n\n1.2 \n\n0.9 \n\n0.7 \n\n0.9 \n\n0.9 \n\n1.1 \n\n0.7 \n\n1.1 \n\n1.0 \n\n1.

No indigenous peoples will be affected, as the Project is designed to \nensure that all communities, on an equitable basis, will benefit from the Project. The Project will \naddress  the  special  needs  of  minority  communities  in  the  context  of  their  social  and  cultural \nsystems. As part of the selection criteria, subprojects that may entail significant impacts will not \nbe included. The Project will be implemented under a sector approach, therefore, the following \nresettlement  framework  was  agreed  upon  by  the  Government  and  ADB  to  guide  the \nGovernment  in  preparing  a  resettlement  plan  (RP),  if  this  becomes  necessary  during \nimplementation.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe resettlement framework aims to ensure that screening, planning, and management \nprocedures for involuntary resettlement on all subprojects will be in compliance with the Policy \non  Involuntary  Resettlement  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  other  ADB  social \nsafeguard policies.  \n \n4. \nThis policy framework has been built upon the existing Laws of the Land, Electricity Act \nNo.  17  1969  and  amendment,  National  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (2001),2  and  ADB\u2019s \nresettlement policy. The policy principles adopted are:  \n\nPolicy Framework and Entitlements \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\nAvoid, minimize and mitigate negative land acquisition and resettlement impacts \nby reviewing alternatives to the project;  \n\nIf  involuntary  resettlement  is  unavoidable,  the  displaced  persons  should  be \nassisted to reestablish themselves and improve their quality of life;  \n\nGender  quality  and  equity  should  be  ensured  and  adhered  to  throughout  the \npolicy;  \n\nlivelihood  compensation,  and  development  options  at \n\nAffected  persons  (APs)  should  be  fully  involved  in  the  selection  of  relocation \nsites, \nthe  earliest \nopportunity; cash compensation will be used since the Project will only require a \nsmall amount of land;  \n\nCompensation  for  loss  of  land,  structures,  and  assets  should  be  based  on  full \nreplacement cost3 (including transaction costs) and should be paid promptly;  \n\n                                                 \n1  Insignificant impacts\u2014fewer than 200 people are displaced from housing, fewer than 200 people will lose less than \n10% of their productive assets, or 200 people or more experience minor impacts. A short resettlement plan will be \nrequired for each Category B subproject.  \n\n2  To assist the relevant agencies in planning, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating all involuntary resettlement \nimpacts,  the  following  guidelines  are  provided:  (i) General  Guidelines  on  Planning  and  Implementation  of \nInvoluntary Resettlement, (ii) Guidelines for the Preparation of a Resettlement Action Plan, (iii) Process Manual for \nthe Implementation of the NIRP\u2014Ministry of Land, and (iv) Guidelines for a Participatory Resettlement Process. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8  \n\n37\n\nResettlement  should  be  planned  and  implemented  with  full  participation  of  the \nprovincial and local authorities;  \n\nAssist  those  affected  to  be  economically  and  socially  integrated  into  the  host \ncommunities, participatory measures should be designed and implemented;  \n\n \n(viii)  Common  property  resources  and  community  and  public  services  should  be \n\nprovided; \n\nResettlement should be planned as a development activity; \n\nAPs  who  do  not  have  documented  title  to  land  should  receive  fair  and  just \ntreatment;  \n\nVulnerable  groups  should  be  identified  and  given  appropriate  assistance  to \nsubstantially improve their living standards; and  \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\n \n(ix) \n \n(x) \n\n \n(xi) \n\n \n(xii) \n\nThe Government should bear full costs of compensation and resettlement. \n\n \nPersons  affected  by  the  Project  will  be  entitled  to  various  types  of  compensation  and \n5. \nresettlement assistance that will help in the restoration of their livelihoods, at least, to the pre-\nproject standards as shown in the following matrix.  \n \n\nTable A8: Entitlement Matrix \n\nType of Loss \n\nEntitlement \n\nImplementation Issues \n\nRental payment during the temporary \nuse of AP\u2019s land. \n\nThe land will be restored to its \nprevious quality or better. \n\nTemporarily affected \nland (during \nconstruction)  \nPermanent loss of \nland (with land title or \nownership records) \n\nLoss of crops and \ntrees by cultivators \nregardless of land \nownership \n\nCash compensation will be used since \nthe project will only require small \namount of land. \n \n\n\u2022  Cash compensation for loss of crops \n\nat replacement cost.

If land, it means the cost of buying \nreplacement  land  near  the  lost  land  with  equal  productive  potential  plus  the  cost  of  preparing  the  land  to  levels \nsimilar to those of the affected land and cost of any registration and transfer taxes. If structures, it means current \nmarket value of building materials, required labor without deduction for depreciation or salvageable materials. For \ncrops and trees, it will be based on economic production, age, and type. \n\n \n\n\f38\n\nAppendix 8  \n\nType of Loss \n\nEntitlement \n\nImplementation Issues \n\nLoss of structures \nand immovable \nassets by owners \n(regardless of land \ntitle) \nRestoration of \ncultural and \ncommunity structures \n\nCompensation for structures and other \nassets at full replacement cost without \ndeduction for depreciation or \nsalvageable materials.

Given the fluid situation of the project area, this approach\u2014highly successful under \nNECORD\u2014will be used to prepare subprojects for implementation under the Project.  \n \n2. \nLarger-scale  subprojects  will  be  developed  primarily  at  the  district  level  by  government \ndepartments,  beneficiaries,  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs).  These  subproject \nproposals will be then submitted to the divisional rehabilitation committee (DRC) and the district \nrehabilitation coordinating committee (DRCC) present in each of the eight project districts. The \nDRCC  reviews  and  evaluates  each  proposal  against  the  district  development  plans  and  also \nagainst  previously  established  subproject  criteria;  all  subprojects  must  also  satisfy  general \ncriteria  for  all  subprojects.  The  district  project  management  unit  (DPMU)  assists  with  these \nagencies in preparation of the subproject proposals in the standard formats used for the Project.  \n \nAfter approval by the DRCC, DPMU through the government agent or district secretary \n3. \npresent the subproject to the project management unit (PMU) located in Trincomalee. The PMU \nmakes  a  detailed  review  of  each  subproject,  considering  if  the  subproject  (i)  fits  the  overall \nscope  of  NECORD,  (ii)  satisfies  the  general  and  component-related  criteria,  (iii)  creates  any \nproblems  in  the  area,  (iv)  has  been  sufficiently  justified,  and  (v)  will  attain  the  desired  outputs \nand benefits. The PMU also (i) performs a detailed review of the subproject cost estimate and \nimplementation  schedule,  (ii)  verifies  beneficiary  contribution,  (iii)  assesses  if  contractors  are \navailable  and  capable  of  performing  the  work,  (iv)  confirms  that  land  will  be  available  as \nnecessary, and (v) investigates of any gender, social, or environmental concerns.  \n \n4. \nIf the PMU finds that the subproject satisfies all the evaluation criteria, the proposal will \nbe then forwarded to the provincial project coordinating committee (PPCC) and, 15 days prior to \na PPCC meeting, circulated to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the relevant secretaries, \nministries,  provincial  and  district  heads  of  departments,  government  agents,  government \nsecurity coordinators (police, army), NGOs, and bilateral and multilateral agencies implementing \nprojects in the area for review.  \n \n5. \nThe PPCC, chaired by the Chief Secretary of the North East Provincial Council, meets, \ntypically at 3-month intervals, to present each subproject for conditional approval. Attendees at \nthe PPCC include ADB, relevant PMU staff, government agents, district deputy project directors, \nand representatives from concerned national ministries. Subprojects not approved by PPCC will \nbe returned to the PMU/DPMU for further clarification or justification. If approved by the PPCC, \nthe PMU informs the proponent to further develop the subproject to include the designs, bill of \nquantities,  specifications,  and  the  bid  documents.  The  final  proposal  will  then  be  forwarded  to \nADB  for  approval.  Subprojects  not  approved  by  ADB  will  be  returned  to  the  PMU  for  further \nclarification or modifications to better comply with project criteria or ADB guidelines.  \n \n6. \nOnce ADB gives final approval, competitive tenders will be called, bids will be evaluated, \nand  awards  will  be  made  to  the  substantially  responsive  lowest  bidder.  Contracts  will  be  then \nsent  to  ADB  for  approval  prior  to  award;  smaller  contracts\u2014less  than  $100,000  in  estimated \ncost\u2014will  be  approved  through  postaward  (ex  post  facto)  approval.  Subprojects  will  then  be \nadministered through the PMU until completion of the contract.  \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n\fAppendix 9  \n\n41\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nFigure A9: Subproject Approval Process \n\nSteps\n\nResponsibility \n\nSubproject Identification \n\nDeveloping Conceptual Project \nProposal - Standard Document \n\nBeneficiaries/ Departments/NGOs/ \nDivisional Rehabilitation Committee \n(DRC), District Rehabilitation \nCoordinating Committee (DRCC) \nand DPMU \n \n \n\nSubmission \nentering to MIS \n\nfor  Approval  and\n\nDPMU through GA or DS \n\n \ns\ny\na\nd\n0\n4\n-\n \n\n0\n3\n\n \ns\ny\na\nd\n0\n3\n-\n \n\n0\n2\n\n \ns\ny\na\nd\n0\n4\n-\n \n0\n3\n\n \ns\ny\na\nd\n \n3\n-\n2\n\n \ns\ny\na\nd\n0\n7\n-\n \n0\n5\n\n \ns\nh\nt\no\nm\n \n8\n1\n-\n6\n\nChecking against Criteria\n\nSubproject Submission for PPCC \napproval \n\nPMU  \n\nPMU  \n\nj\n\n \ns\nn\no\ni\nt\nc\ne\ne\nR\n/\ns\nn\no\ni\nt\na\nc\ni\nf\ni\nr\na\nC\n\nl\n\nDevelopment of Detailed Proposal \nand Bid Documents\n\nDepartments or Proponent \n\nFinal Subproject Approval\n\nADB \n\nCalling Tender\n\nDPMU through GA or PMU \n(Depending on the costs) \n\nBidding \n\nDomestic Contractors \n\nTender Evaluation\n\nDistrict Committee or Project \nTender Boards through GA or \nDS \n\nAward \n\nDPMU or PMU \n\nPost Facto Approval\n\nADB \n\nImplementation and Quality \nChecks \n\nDepartments/DPMU/PMU \n\nHanding Over \n\nOperation and Maintenance\n\nDPMU/PMU \n\nDepartments/Beneficiaries \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, DPMU = District Project Management Unit, DS = District Secretary, GA = Government\nAgent,  MIS  =  Management  Information  System,  NGO  =  Non  Governmental  Organization,  PPCC  =  Provincial  Project\nCoordinating Committee, PMU= Project Management Unit.  \n\n \n \n\n\f42\n\nAppendix 10 \n\nPROJECT IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE \n \n \n\nProject Activities \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n\nAnchor Subprojects \n\nQ1  Q2  Q3  Q4  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4 \n\nSubproject Formulation \n\n==  == \n\nConsultant Selection \n\n==  == \n\nDetailed Designs and \nProcurement documents \n\n==  == \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n==  == \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n==  ==  ==  ==  ==  == \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n==  ==  ==  ==  == \n\n==  == \n\n==  ==  ==  == \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nProcurement \n\nCivil Works \n\nIncome Generation, \nSocial Cohesion \nSubprojects \n\nConsultant Selection \n\nDevelopment of \nPrototype Subprojects \n\nImplementation \n\nQ1, Q2, Q3, Q4 = year quarters \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff estimates. \n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n43\n\nENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK \n \n\nIntroduction \n\nA. \n \nThe Project is classified as a category \u201cB\u201d project, in accordance with the Environment \n1.  \nPolicy  (2002)  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  envisaged  subprojects  will  mainly \ninvolve activities to  rehabilitate  and  develop the basic social  infrastructure that existed prior to \nthe  conflict.  The  sectors  included  in  the  Project  will  be  rehabilitation  of  school  and  university \nbuildings,  health  facilities  (less  than  150  beds),  buildings  for  improvement  of  capacity  building \nand social cohesion, and small demonstration farms.  \n \n2. \nThe Project will use the same environmental evaluation procedures currently being used \non  Loan  1846-SRI(SF):  North  East  Community  Restoration  and  Development  Project \n(NECORD).  To  ensure  compliance  with  both \nthe  government  guidelines  and  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines (2003), environmental checklists, detailed below, will be \nused. The checklists will be completed when the proponents develop the subproject proposals. \nIn  the  event  that  any  subproject  falls  within  any  of  the  prescribed  areas,  or  falls  within  the \nGovernment\u2019s and ADB\u2019s prescribed list, subprojects will be subject to an initial environmental \nexamination  (IEE)  or  an  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  as  appropriate  prior  to  the \nimplementation  of  the  subproject.  The  responsibility  for  ensuring  compliance  with  the \nenvironmental  guidelines  will  be  with  the  project  management  unit  (PMU).  Any  mitigating \nmeasures suggested for those subprojects that fall within the list will be included as part of the \ncontract  documents  for  implementation.  The  responsibilities  of  the  Implementing  Agency  (IA) \nand ADB are explained in the following sections.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nof potential environmental problems or risks related to each subproject:  \n\nThe following review procedure will be adopted to facilitate identification and mitigation \n\nResponsibilities of Implementing Agency and Asian Development Bank  \n\n \n(i) \n\nIA responsibilities:  \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nComplete the checklist showed below as part of the subproject proposal. \n\nthe  simplified \n\nPrepare \nreport\u2014currently  being  used  under \nNECORD\u2014for  any  subproject  that  could  fall  within  the  checklist  as \nrequired and submit to ADB as part of the subproject proposal.  \n\nIEE \n\nObtain  environmental  clearance  from  the  relevant  project  approving \nagency  (PAA)  and  ADB  for  environmental  compliance  before  awarding \nany civil works contracts for that subproject.  \n\nEnsure  the  implementation  of  environmental  mitigation  measures  as \ndescribed in the IEE report and the PAA clearance (if required).  \n\nReview IEE reports and approve qualifying subprojects.  \n\nDisclose  IEEs  and  Summary  Initial  Environmental  Examinations  of  the \nsubprojects as ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) requires.  \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\nADB responsibilities: \n\n \n\n\f44\n\nAppendix 11 \n\n(e)  Monitor the implementation of mitigation measures through project review \nmissions,  and  conduct  environmental  performance  monitoring  as \nnecessary.  \n\nEnvironmental Monitoring and Public Disclosure \n\n  \nC. \n \n4. \nThe  IA  must  ensure  that  ADB  is  given  access  to  all  subprojects  to  undertake \nenvironmental  monitoring.    However,  the  IA  has  the  full  responsibility  for  monitoring  and \nreporting to ADB on the implementation of environmental mitigation measures for all subprojects \ndescribed  in  the  IEE  report  and  PAA  clearance  (if  required).  The  environmental  monitoring \nreport  must  be  documented  by  the  IA  as  part  of  the  subproject  specific  record.  Monitoring \nshould also include (i) accumulative environmental impacts by small-scale subprojects for which \nindividual  environmental  assessments  are  not  carried  out;  and  (ii) effectiveness  of  mitigation \nmeasures during implementation should be measured\u2014if significant environmental impacts are \nidentified, additional mitigation measures should be considered.  \n \nThe  IA  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  all  environmental  assessment  documents, \n5. \nincluding the environmental monitoring reports, are properly and systematically kept as part of \nthe subproject specific record.  \n\nIn  addition  to  public  consultations  required  by  national  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s \n6. \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002),  all  environmental  documents  are  subject  to  public  disclosure; \ntherefore, these documents should be made available to the public, if requested.  \n \nD. \n\nEnvironmental Checklists \n\nThe following section will be included in the main text of the subproject proposal. If the \n\n7. \nsubproject falls within any category listed in row one, the proponent should fill in the annex listed \nin para 8.  \n\nTable A9.1: Impact of the Subproject on Environment:  \nPlease Check if Appropriate to the Subproject \n\nYes \n\nNo \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDoes the subproject fall under the \nfollowing categories: \n(1) New construction of housing areas \n(more than 100) \n(2) Hospital (more than 150 beds)  \n(3) Water supply and sanitation facilities \n(more than 500 population) \n(4) Irrigation systems (major/medium) \n(5) Fishing facilities (anchorage/processing) \nOr does the proposed subproject fall under \nthese categories: \n(1) Forestry research and extension,  \n(2) Rural health services  \n(3) Marine services education  \n(4) Geological or mineral surveys  \n(5) Education  \n(6) Family planning, etc. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\nIf your subproject is here, \nkindly fill in Annex II (Table \nA9.2) \n\nNo need to fill in Annex II \n(Table A9.2) \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n45\n\n \n8. \nThe following table details the sensitive areas and need to be filled in by the proponent \nof the subproject.

An  individual  consultant  will  be \nengaged to conduct case studies in specified districts in the conflict-affected areas and assist in \nestablishing the prototype center. The main objective of the case study therefore will be to find a \nviable  mechanism  through  which  to  attain  sustainable  impact  on  the  livelihoods  of  women \naffected by the conflict. The broad scope of the consultancy will include:  \n \n\nConsult  relevant  organizations,  government  authorities,  administrative  units, \nwomen\u2019s NGOs, and other relevant organizations in specified districts in conflict-\naffected areas with a view to obtaining information on existing gender division of \nlabor and women\u2019s access to resources and to services and markets.  \n\nAnalyze the information for (a) gender-based patterns of work allocation and their \nrelative rigidity in access to and control over productivity, (b) patterns of male and \nfemale  access  to  benefits  and  their  control  over  these  benefits,  (c)  relative \naccess  of  women  and  men  to  training  and  extension  for  improved  productivity \nand  incomes,  (d)  gender-based  opportunities  and  constraints  on  participation  in \ndecision-making.  \n\nOn the basis of this analysis, develop and recommend a mechanism or strategy \nand specific design features, through which a holistic business environment that \nis  managed,  resourced,  and  controlled  by  women  could  be  established  in  the \nselected districts.  \n\nIdentify specific entrepreneurial activities that are viable in the selected districts, \nwhich will improve the status of women.  \n\nCollect  gender-disaggregated  data  as  a  part  of  gathering  information,  wherever \npossible.  \n\nIdentify  a  local  agency  or  group  of  agencies  with  the  capacity  to  assist  the \nproposed  women-oriented  business  center  to  become  independent,  successful, \nand sustainable.  \n\n(vii) \n\nPrepare  TORS \nthe  wider-scale \nimplementation  of  the  women\u2019s  enterprise  initiative  proposed  for  follow-on \nprojects in the northeast.  \n\nlong-term  consultant \n\nto  assist \n\nfor  a \n\nin \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n50\n\n \nA. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY (SPRSS)  \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?  \n\n \n Yes \n \n No \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Sri Lanka: \nThe two decades of conflict in Sri Lanka have left extensive damage to infrastructure and people\u2019s livelihoods, denied \npeople access to basic social services and have destroyed productive assets and social capital in the conflict-affected \nareas. Physical injury, the pain of loss, repeated displacement, psychological stress, and war-related trauma have \naffected whole communities in the conflict-affected areas. Ethnic tensions have increased during this period of \ndeprivation and suffering resulting in renewed feelings of animosity among communities. Economic activities are not \nsustained and are not viable in an atmosphere of doubts, uncertainties, and lack of development.  \n \nIn the above context, continued efforts at improving existing services in the area with a focus on issues that would \nhave an immediate but lasting impact on the lives of the people is vital. The conflict-affected areas need to provide \nfacilities and services that would encourage people to return and to continue living in these areas. As such, \ninstitutional strengthening and capacity building are the need of the hour. Restoration of infrastructure alone is not \nsufficient if it is to provide optimum benefits and outreach. Therefore, facilities that would ensure continued activity and \ndelivery of adequate services of schools, agricultural extension services, and additional skills training programs toward \nbuilding a sustainable economic base in the areas are vital. This Project will therefore contribute to the restoration of \npeople\u2019s livelihoods, increasing social stability and ethnic harmony in the conflict-affected areas with equitable \ndistribution of benefits to help build a sound economy and cultivate an atmosphere of peace and human security. \n \n\nB. \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\n    Poverty Classification \n\n \n\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nParticipatory poverty analysis using both qualitative and quantitative \npoverty analysis indicators as necessary.

Consequences of the conflict \ninclude more than 60,000 people killed, more than 800,000 persons displaced internally, tens of \nthousands of families who have fled the country, physical infrastructure\u2014especially in the north \nand east\u2014devastated, an economy starved of investment and hobbled by insecurity, enormous \nsocial  trauma,  and  a  significant  deterioration  in  the  quantity  of  qualified  human  resources \navailable  in  both  the  social  and  economic  spheres.  A  memorandum  of  understanding  (MoU) \nsigned  by  the  Government  and  the  Liberation  Tigers  of  Tamil  Eelam  (LTTE)  in  early  2002 \ngenerated  fresh  hope  that  a  lasting  peace  could  be  negotiated  and  serve  as  a  basis  for  the \nfuture development of the country. However, the suspension of negotiations by the LTTE in April \n2003,  followed  by  a  deepening  political  crisis  in  the  south  later  in  the  year,  have  essentially \nresulted  in  forward  progress  in  the  formal  peace  process  being  brought  to  a  halt,  although \nsupport  for  peace  remains  robust.  The  general  election  planned  for  early  April  2004  adds \nanother element of uncertainty to the overall picture. It is therefore essential that ADB remains a \nresponsive,  effective,  and  sympathetic  partner  to  Sri  Lanka  in  its  progress  toward  a  lasting \npeace.  \n \n2. \nMost of the conflict-affected areas, whether on the government or LTTE side, have been \nessentially devoid of new investment during the 20 years of armed conflict, although initial signs \nof  new  investment,  both  public  and  private,  have  begun  to  emerge  since  the  cease-fire \nagreement  was  signed  in  early  2002.  On  balance,  the  private  sector  plays  a  greater  role  in \neconomic  life  than  it  did  20  years  ago.  Taxes  have  become  a  controversial  issue  in  LTTE-\ncontrolled areas, with the LTTE imposing various types of levies on individuals and companies \nin order to finance a portion of their activities. While reliable social statistics are not available for \nthe  areas  targeted  by  this  project,  anecdotal  evidence  from  numerous  aid  agencies  indicates \nthat  social  problems  such  as  alcoholism,  domestic  violence,  sexual  abuse,  drugs,  and  suicide \nsignificantly  increased  over  the  years  of  conflict.  Such  increases  suggest  widespread \npsychological  trauma,  alienation,  and  stress  resulting  from  the  breakdown  of  traditional  social \nsupport networks. \n \n3. \nKey  actors  who  have  an  influence  on  the  evolving  conditions  in  the  conflict-affected \nareas include the LTTE, who wish to ensure that peace will bring not only rehabilitation to the \nnorth  and  east,  but  also  significant  autonomy  in  the  governance  of  the  region,  as  reflected  in \ntheir  proposal  (not  yet  discussed)  for  an  interim  administration  covering  the  northeastern \ndistricts.  The  Government,  which  controls  about  half  of  the  conflict-affected  areas,  including \nJaffna,  sees  peace  and  the  ensuing  stability  as  an  essential  ingredient  in  relaunching  Sri \nLanka\u2019s economy. However, there are elements in the south who continue to actively promote \nthe  dominance  of  the  largest  ethnic  community,  thus  limiting  the  Government\u2019s  scope  to  take \npeace initiatives and to make what are perceived by some as unacceptable concessions.  \n \nB. \n \n4. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  partly  in  government-controlled  areas  and  partly  in \nLTTE-controlled territory. Although the longer-term control of these areas will be the subject of \nfuture  negotiations,  for  the  moment,  the  boundaries  are  not  actively  contested  by  either  party. \nThe political and security situation in the project area will depend greatly on the policies of the \nrecently-elected  government  and  their  approach  towards  peace  negotiations.  But  for  the \n\nProject Context \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n53\n\nmoment,  the  context  is  generally  stable,  although  punctuated  by  periodic  reports  of  relatively \nminor  breaches  of  the  cease-fire  agreement  and  of  intimidation  of  local  citizens  and  groups. \nEconomically, there has been some improvement since the cease-fire agreement in early 2002, \nwith  some  small-scale  private  investment,  notably  in  the  services  sector,  some  increase  in \nrehabilitation  activities  by  aid  organizations,  and  increased  trade  due  to  the  opening  of  road \nlinks  between  LTTE-  and  government-controlled  areas.  It  is  expected  that  total  aid  flows  will \nincrease significantly in 2004, on condition that there is not a fresh outbreak of armed hostilities, \nraising the issue of capacity constraints for both administrative structures and community-based \norganizations. Poverty remains endemic, with tens of thousands of internally displaced families \nlooking  to  resettle  in  their  places  of  origin.  Returns  since  the  ceasefire  have  significantly \naugmented  the  population  of  a  number  of  districts  such  as  Jaffna,  Kilinochchi,  and  Mullaittivu \nthat had seen large outflows during the war.  \n \n5. \nIn  areas  of  mixed  ethnic  composition,  notably  in  the  east,  relations  between  the  three \nmain groups (Tamil, Singhalese, and Muslim) remain volatile, despite the efforts of community \nleaders  to  establish  conflict  resolution  mechanisms.  Competition  over  limited  resources  and \ndisputed  land  rights  in  some  areas  are  flash  points  that  have  acted  as  triggers  for \nintercommunal  violence  on  recent  occasions.  Currently  many  Muslim  communities  feel \nmarginalized  in  debates  over  the  country\u2019s  future,  believing  their  specific  needs  are  not \nadequately  taken  into  account  and  feeling  under  threat  by  the  LTTE.  Singhalese  community \nmembers, especially those along the east coast, generally feel vulnerable to LTTE pressure and \ncomplain of not being adequately protected by the Government. Tamils are cautiously hopeful \nthat  the  LTTE  and  the  Government  will  eventually  return  to  the  negotiating  table.  All \ncommunities feel that their material conditions have not improved sufficiently since the MoU was \nnegotiated.  \n \n6. \nThe ethnic composition varies across the project area, with Tamils strongly dominating in \nthe  north.  In  the  districts  in  the  east,  the  three  main  groups  are  relatively  equally  balanced. \nNevertheless,  individual  communities  tend  to  be  essentially  mono-ethnic,  thus  producing  a \nschool system that is fragmented as well as communities that do not communicate easily with \neach other.  \n \nInfrastructure  in  much  of  the  project  area,  but  especially  the  north,  was  destroyed  or \n7. \nseverely  damaged  during  the  armed  conflict,  while  the  rest  was  not  maintained  and  therefore \ndeteriorated  due  to  lack  of  funds  or  access.  Since  the  cease-fire,  most  people  appear  to  feel \nthat their personal security has improved, but also fear the gains are fragile. Some studies, such \nas  one  commissioned  by  the  Canadian  International  Development  Agency  (CIDA)  in  2002,1 \nsuggest  that  psychological  trauma  is  widespread  among  all  ages,  with  feelings  of  fear, \ndepression  and  helplessness  being  common.  Children  have  been  particular  victims,  not  only \ndue to the psychological trauma suffered at an impressionable age, but also due to malnutrition \nthat  has  hampered  their  development,  loss  of  years  of  schooling,  and  exposure  to  physical \ndangers  such  as  land  mines.  Many  women  have  suffered  the  trauma  of  losing  the  main \nbreadwinner  in  the  family,  obliging  them  to  provide  for  their  children  and  elder  parents,  often \nafter  being  forced  from  their  land.  In  addition,  the  conflict  environment  rendered  women \nparticularly vulnerable to sexual harassment.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1   Simms, Dr. Chris. 2002. Study on Psychosocial Distress in Sri Lanka. Colombo. \n\n \n\n\f54\n\nAppendix 14 \n\nPrognosis \n\nC. \n \n8. \nDespite  the  current  political  crisis  in  the  south,  the  general  trend  since  the  MoU  was \nsigned has been a gradual decrease in the overall level of tension in the country, although there \nis  a  clear  sense  that  this  decrease  could  easily  be  reversed.  In  addition,  the  trend  does  not \nexclude outbreaks of violence in specific locations as a result of local \u201ctriggers\u201d being set off by \nlocal issues. These issues tend to be related to competition for local resources, for example fish \nor  access  to  arable  land.  Because  of  the  lack  of  trust  and  effective  dispute-resolution \nmechanisms at higher levels, the danger is that these local triggers can cause wider eruptions \nof  violence  through  contagion.  There  is  also  a  danger  of  political  entrepreneurs  promoting \nextreme options in order to consolidate their following, thus engendering heightened inter-group \nhostility and tensions.  \n \n9. \nBecause  specific  ethnic  groups  tend  to  dominate  in  specific  economic  sectors,  those \nimplementing  the  Project  will  need  to  be  aware  that  certain  subproject  interventions  might  be \nperceived as favoring one group at the expense of another. Thus, they will need to consider not \nonly whether aid to one sector will achieve the desired outputs but also the potential impact on \nother  groups  in  the  area.  In  addition,  they  will  need  to  ensure  that  the  way  aid  is  apportioned \nbetween different sectors allows for a reasonably equitable sharing of benefits among all ethnic \ngroups.  \n \n10. \nGroups  that  may  consider  they  could  benefit  from  a  re-escalation  of  tensions  or  even \nconflict  include  security  forces  on  both  sides  whose  influence  and  resources  have  expanded \ngreatly  over  the  life  of  the  conflict  and  could  be  expected  to  shrink  if  and  as  long-term  peace \ntakes root. Thus demilitarization will become an issue if peace is to be consolidated.  \n \n11.  With  regards  to  groups  that  can  play  a  mitigating  or  transforming  role  in  the  event \nsociopolitical tensions worsen, there are numerous religious authorities of all faiths that appear \nwilling  to  contribute  at  both  the  local  and  provincial  levels.  There  are  also  a  number  of \nexperienced nongovernment organizations (NGOs) with extensive roots in the area, which have \ndeveloped  both  credibility  and  expertise  in  conflict  mediation  and  transformation  at  the  local \nlevel.  Finally,  a  number  of  community-based  organizations,  such  as  village  rehabilitation \ncommittees, have generated credible leaders over the past several years that could also be a \nuseful resource in constructively addressing local tensions. \n \n12. \nThe  most  likely  scenario  over  the  next  few  years  is  that  the  overall  peace  will  hold, \ndespite  periodic  confrontations  and  outbreaks  of  violence.  Transparent,  effective,  democratic \ngovernance meeting generally accepted international norms is however likely to continue to be \na  concern  in  the  near  future,  acting  as  a  brake  on  the  long-term  development  of  the  country, \nparticularly  in  the  northeast  but  also  in  the  south.  As  a  result,  the  Project  will  need  to  pay \nparticular  attention  to  the  quality  of  its  management  and  how  the  outputs  connect  with  the \ngovernance structures that will be put into place as the peace process advances. \n \nD. \n \n13. \nA key to the project being perceived as providing a \u201cpeace dividend\u201d will be the extent to \nwhich target populations consider that benefits to them are being maximized. This means that \nnot only should the outputs be efficiently delivered but also that implementation methods favor \nthe  maximization  of  benefits  locally.  For  example,  local  labor  should  be  used  as  much  as \npossible while contracts and subcontracts should be designed to facilitate the participation and \nreinforcement  of  local  contractors.  Also,  where  work  is  to  be  implemented  by  civil  society \n\nProject Parameters \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n55\n\nCorrespondence between Project and Context \n\norganizations such as NGOs, attention should be accorded to strengthening their technical and \nmanagerial capacity as needed, in order to ensure not only the effectiveness of the work they \ncarry out but also their capacity to contribute to the future development of their area.  \n \nThe  Project,  as  it  is  formulated,  has  the  capacity  to  apportion  benefits  in  an  equitable \n14. \nmanner among the different ethnic groups, subject to the provisos mentioned earlier and subject \nto  ethnicity  being  one  of  the  criteria  (but  not  the  only  one)  used  in  targeting  specific \ncommunities. There is a risk that certain parts of the project may be temporarily destabilized by \nthe eruption of local tensions, but as long as tensions remain local, this destabilization is likely to \nbe  of  short  duration.  However,  past  experience  indicates  that  the  protection  will  be  more  cost \neffective if the Project, when it enters a new locality, takes the time to explain the objectives to \nlocal leaders and seeks to gain their endorsement. It will also be useful for the periodic reviews \nto  include  assessments  of  changes  in  the  political  and  security  environment  and  how/if  they \nimpact on the Project, as well as how the Project appears to be impacting on peace and conflict \nfactors in the target areas.  \n \nE. \n \n15. \nAs  the  Project  responds  to  generally  recognized  needs,  the  support  for  such \ninterventions  is  by  and  large  strong  among  government  and  LTTE  representatives,  as  well  as \namong  community  leaders.  However,  should  negotiations  with  regards  to  a  proposed  interim \nadministration  for  the  north  and  east  eventually  bear  fruit,  it  will  likely  be  necessary  that  ADB \ndiscuss  carefully  with  the  Government  and  the  LTTE  how  decisions  agreed  at  the  negotiating \ntable  affect  implementation  arrangements  for  the  Project,  within  the  parameters  of  the  original \nloan  agreement.  The  fact  that  the  North  East  Community  Development  Project  has  gained \nconsiderable  credibility  and  trust  among  all  sociopolitical  actors  in  the north  and  east  over  the \npast  couple  of  years  will  be  a  significant  asset  in  dealing  with  the  inevitable  tensions  that  will \nperiodically arise during implementation of the Project. \n \nF. \n \n16. \nAs  long  as  the  beneficial  outcomes  are  shared  reasonably  equitably  among  the  major \nethnic  groups  and  across  the  target  area,  the  Project  is  not  expected  to  contribute  to  an \nintensification  of  social  tensions.  In  addition,  the  modest  nature  of  the  proposed  activities \nappears  to  make  them  unlikely  to  be  captured  by  elite  or  sectarian  interests.  Possible \ninadvertent  negative  outcomes  for  this  type  of  project  that  will  need  to  be  monitored  include \nopportunities for illegitimate profit taking on construction contracts and opportunities for levying \nvarious types of nontransparent taxes or fees.  \n \n17. \nRegarding the potential for disillusionment among the beneficiary populations once they \nsee the actual outcomes delivered by the Project, the danger appears to be fairly modest, given \nthe  small-scale,  local  nature  of  the  outputs.  The  key  will  be  in  maintaining  complete \ntransparency  with  both  the  local  authorities  and  the  ultimate  beneficiaries  on  what  the  Project \ncan  and  cannot  deliver  and  consulting  with  local  representatives  on  the  most  appropriate \nmethodology to adopt as the project advances. This includes being sensitive to any changes in \napproach \nthe \nthat  appear \nimplementation period.  \n \n\nlight  of  changing  circumstances  over \n\nProjected Impacts \n\nto  be  advisable \n\nin \n\n \n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 14 \n\nConclusion \n\nG. \n \n18. \nThe Project as presented can potentially make a positive contribution to the rebuilding of \nthe  infrastructure  and  socioeconomic  fabric  of  the  conflict-affected  areas  of  Sri  Lanka.  The \nchallenge will be in implementing the Project in a conflict-sensitive manner, ensuring that: \n \n\nsubprojects are selected in ways that ensure an ethnic balance that reasonably \nreflects the general ethnic composition of that area; \nrigorous  measures  are  applied  to  limit  the  potential  of  corruption  diverting \nresources to local, subnational and national elites; \nall phases of the project are characterized by transparency, so that the relevant \nauthorities,  community \nthe  project \nparameters and how it is progressing; and \nimplementation  is  done  using  local  human  and  material  resources  as  much  as \npossible,  encouraging  a  sense  of  ownership  of  the  dividends  flowing  from  the \ncease-fire. \n\nleaders  and  beneficiaries  understand \n\nIndicators that might be considered in order to track changes in the degree and nature of \n\n \n19. \ncommunal tensions and that could serve as warning (or reassuring) signs, include: \n \n\nthe number of violent incidents involving four or more people\u2014averaged on a per \ncommunity basis\u2014within the previous 6 months;  \nthe number of disputes involving more than five households\u2014averaged on a per \ncommunity basis\u2014that have been resolved in a nonviolent manner in the past 6 \nmonths;  \nthe average total number of times each family in the village\u2014averaged on a per \ncommunity basis\u2014has traveled to another village or town in the previous month; \nand  \nthe judgment in community meetings whether the present security climate in their \narea is very poor, poor, fair, good, or very good.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 1 May 2004)  \n", "Currency Unit \nSLRe1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "Sri Lanka rupee/s (SLRe/SLRs) \n$0.01 \nSLRs98.850\n", " \n \n", " \n \n", "ADB \n \nCAARP \nDPMU  \n \nGTZ \n \n \n \nIA \n \nIDP \n \nIEE  \nLCB \n \nLTTE   \nMPCLG \nNECORD \nNEPC   \nNGO \n \nNPCC   \n \nPMU \nPPCC   \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n \n", "Asian Development Bank \nConflict Affected Areas Rehabilitation Project \ndistrict project management unit \nDeutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit \n(German Agency for Technical Cooperation) \nimplementing agency \ninternally displaced person \ninitial environmental examination \nlocal competitive bidding \nLiberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam \nMinistry of Provincial Councils and Local Government \nNorth East Community Restoration and Development Project \nNorth East Provincial Council \nnongovernment organization \nNational Project Coordination Committee \nproject management unit \nProvincial Project Coordination Committee \n", " \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December.  \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", "This report was prepared by a team consisting of R.G.
