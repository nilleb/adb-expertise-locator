THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe  Republican  State  Enterprise  Kazvodkhoz  (KVK),  to  be  guaranteed  by  the  Republic  of \nKazakhstan, for the Irrigation Rehabilitation Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will support the rehabilitation and improvement of irrigation networks serving \nabout 171,100 hectares (ha) of land in Kazakhstan\u2019s East Kazakhstan, Karaghandy, Kyzylorda, \nand Zhambyl provinces. The project will promote the diversification from traditional low-yielding \nand low-value grain crops into high-value cash crops. It will also build the capacity of farmers and \nKVK for improved water and irrigation management. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Kazakhstan is a sparsely populated country with significant mineral wealth and vast \namounts of agricultural land. Since gaining independence in 1991, it has evolved from a command \neconomy to a market-based economy. While the country achieved middle-income status in 2006 \nmainly thanks to a surge in oil and gas exports, the downturn of oil and other commodity prices in \n2014 exposed its vulnerability to external shocks. Kazakhstan continues to struggle to diversify \nits economy, strengthen its institutions, and balance regional disparities between its few economic \ncenters and a vast periphery, where public services remain scarce and of poor quality. \n \n4.  Agriculture is an important but neglected sector in the national economy, employing 18.0% \nof the labor force and contributing 4.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2017. Despite its \neconomic potential, the sector\u2019s contribution to GDP has been decreasing.2 Moreover, about 42% \nof the country\u2019s population is in rural areas where living standards depend heavily on income \ngenerated from agricultural production. Women make up 29% of the workforce in agriculture, and \n64%  of  rural  women  are  self-employed,  mostly  in  activities  directly  related  to  agriculture. \nKazakhstan has enormous underused agricultural potential that could help make economic \ngrowth more diverse and inclusive. By the end of 2018, its agricultural area totaled 221.4 \nmillion ha, of which 25.8 million ha or 12% was classified as arable land and 186.2 million ha or \n84% as pasture land.3 Kazakhstan\u2019s per capita arable land of about 1.65 ha is the second highest \nafter Australia.4 \n \n5.  During the country\u2019s transition in the 1990s and the uncertainties that accompanied it, \nagricultural production ceased on large areas of land. The situation began to improve at the start \nof the new millennium, but the total agricultural area in 2015 was still 40% lower than in 1990, and \nthe value of agricultural output only recently reached pre-independence levels. Major agricultural \nproducts include grains (wheat, barley, maize, buckwheat, and rice); cotton; potatoes; vegetables; \nmelons; sugar beets; sunflowers; and livestock. Despite Kazakhstan\u2019s historical role as an \nagricultural exporter, the sector\u2019s trade performance remains poor. Low agricultural productivity \n                                                \n1  KVK is a state-owned enterprise whose mandate is to rehabilitate, operate, and maintain water facilities (reservoirs, \ncanals, pumping stations, and other facilities); and to supply irrigation and drinking water to users. \n2  The Statistics Portal.

Arable Land (Hectares per Person) (accessed 8 April 2019). \n ", "2 \nand  poor  sector  governance  limit  income  opportunities  in  rural  areas  and  undermine  the \ngovernment\u2019s overall goal of inclusive economic growth. \n \n6.  In the early 1990s, the government embarked on several important policy and legal \nreforms in agriculture, including land reforms. The reforms initially focused on dismantling the \nstate ownership of land and agricultural production and establishing the legal and institutional \nbasis for private and market-based agriculture. It was a massive task to restructure a system of \ngiant state farms under a command economy to a system of privately run, profitable farm units. \nWhile all land remained in state ownership in the 1990s, a new land code was adopted in 2003 \nand came into force in 2005, allowing private ownership of agricultural land with all property rights. \nKazakhstan\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization in 2015 increased its access to external \nmarkets and boosted competition and vertical integration, which should have led to higher \nproductivity in the sector. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided a loan to support the \ngovernment\u2019s  agriculture  reform  in  three  policy  areas:  creating  markets,  promoting  market \ncompetitiveness, and strengthening social and environmental protection in 1995.5 \n \n7.  Before  the  breakup  of  the  Soviet  Union,  Kazakhstan  witnessed  the  construction  of \nextensive, centrally planned irrigation systems that were managed and operated by the provincial \nadministrations. After the breakup, between 1991 and 1999, 20.6 million ha of cropland were \nabandoned,  according  to  an  ADB  diagnostic  study.6  The  irrigated  area  was  estimated  at \n2.3 million ha in 1991, but by 2018 it had dwindled to about 1.4 million ha.7 The study identified \nthe key challenges for the sector: (i) restructuring massive Soviet state farms into smaller, more \nefficient farms; (ii) enabling crop intensification to better match highly variable growing conditions; \n(iii) pricing water appropriately to manage its scarcity more effectively; (iv) improving public \ninfrastructure for agriculture development; and (v) reducing value-chain fragmentation (footnote \n6). \n \n8.  The further development of the irrigation subsector is a key element of government efforts \nto diversify Kazakhstan\u2019s economy, promote food security, and reduce poverty. The rehabilitation \nof irrigation schemes and renewed cultivation of abandoned land could help increase agricultural \nproductivity and rural incomes. Maximizing the opportunity will depend on agricultural enterprises \nand small farmers responding to market incentives to diversify from traditional low-value and low-\nproductivity cereal crops to higher-value crops such as oilseeds, vegetables, and fruit. The \ngovernment\u2019s recent irrigated agriculture development plan has set ambitious targets to meet the \neconomic development agenda, including the rehabilitation of 600,000 ha of irrigation systems by \n2028.8 To achieve this, the Ministry of Agriculture initiated large irrigation investment projects for \nsupport from international financial institutions such as ADB, with the primary aim to rehabilitate \nthose irrigation schemes that had been poorly maintained and were subsequently abandoned. \n \n9.  A major hurdle to overcome is the insufficient availability of water at farms because of \nunderinvestment in water storage and control infrastructure, water losses during conveyance and \ndistribution, and in some cases dysfunctional water distribution networks as a result of neglected \noperation and maintenance (O&M). Other hurdles are (i) obsolete agricultural practices and on-\nfarm water management technologies; (ii) low water delivery tariffs that do not generate sufficient \nfunds for proper O&M; (iii) inadequate incentives for saving water; (iv) threats from floods, soil \n                                                \n5  Operations Evaluation Department. 2001.

KVK, established in 2011 by merging various state water enterprises, aims to improve the \ncountry\u2019s irrigation network performance, asset ownership, and operational responsibility. KVK is \n100% owned by the Committee for Water Resources of the Ministry of Agriculture.9 This structure \nis common among public sectors in Kazakhstan\u2014semiautonomous entities with a more corporate \nstructure than their parent committees and ministries, aiming to increase accountability and \ntransparency in public financial management and reporting, and to operate infrastructure more \nsustainably. KVK is improving its governance and capacity by implementing projects financed by \nthe European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Islamic Development Bank. \nKVK needs to further improve its internal governance in financial management, procurement, and \ninformation  disclosure;  extend  its  advisory  services  to  farmers  for  better  on-farm  water \nmanagement; and support the development of agricultural cooperatives. \n \n11.  Kazakhstan has become increasingly aware of the role that cooperatives can play in \nagriculture. As of 30 June 2018, it registered 2,872 agricultural cooperatives and 62,825 member-\nfarmers. The extent to which farmers are involved in cooperatives remains limited, however the \nratio of cooperative members to total farmholds stands at just 3.4%.10 The capacity and the role \nof agricultural cooperatives need to be strengthened to improve their governance and the services \nto their members. Cooperatives can help small household farms diversify to high-value crops by \novercoming challenges such as high transaction costs and access to market. \n \n12.  Climate observations from 1960s to early 2010s show an average annual temperature \nincrease of about 0.3oC per decade, and a small decrease in annual precipitation in Kazakhstan. \nThose trends are forecast to continue, with temperatures expected to be 4.5oC higher by 2050, \nwinter precipitation expected to increase, and summer rains to decrease.11 Water availability in \nthe basins will diminish because of the increasing evapotranspiration of the natural vegetation, \nand a seasonal shift can be expected where peak flows will be 2\u20134 weeks earlier because of \nearlier snow melt. The demand for irrigation water will also increase slightly because of higher \ntemperatures. While severe water shortages are not expected, demand might not be met in some \nyears during the dry months. \n \n13.  Strategic fit. The project is aligned with Kazakhstan\u2019s long-term development strategy of \nimproving the quality of life of its people and becoming one of the world\u2019s 30 most developed \ncountries by 2050.12 It will support the government\u2019s agriculture development strategy and \nirrigation development plan, including the State Program for the Development of the Agro-\nIndustrial Complex, 2017\u20132021, which recognizes high losses in water conveyance from the low \nefficiency of the irrigation system.13 \n \n                                                \n9  The Committee for Water Resources is now under the Ministry of Ecology, Geology and Natural Resources newly \nestablished in June 2019. \n10 Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD).  2019.

The project is in line with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 by supporting its priorities of promoting \nrural development and food security, and reducing remaining poverty and inequalities.14 The \nproject  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  county  partnership  strategy,  2017\u20132021,  which  supports \nKazakhstan in achieving the medium-term development targets and climate change adaptation \npriorities set out in its national plans and commitments.15 In particular, ADB will assist the \ngovernment in building a more economically diversified, socially inclusive, and environmentally \nsustainable Kazakhstan; for instance, by providing loans to rehabilitate aging irrigation systems \nand improve water use efficiency on farms (footnote 15). The project also conforms to ADB\u2019s \nWater Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020 to boost water supply coverage and services and promote \nintegrated management of water resources.16 \n \n15.  Lessons. The World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and \nthe Islamic Development Bank approved three irrigation rehabilitation projects between 2013 and \n2016. The design for the proposed ADB-financed project incorporates the lessons from these \nprojects and from ADB interventions in irrigation management in developing member countries. \nMajor lessons are: (i) support for agriculture development should be seen as an integral element \nof infrastructure rehabilitation; (ii) water use efficiencies need to be improved through practices \nsuch as deep ripping, land leveling, and more water-efficient irrigation technologies; (iii) suitable \narrangements should be established not only for infrastructure O&M but also for strengthening \nthe institutions involved in water management; (iv) the potential benefits of inter-farm and on-farm \nimprovements cannot be fully achieved without improving the associated off-farm main canals \nand drainage systems; and (v) the rehabilitation process should adopt a participatory approach \nso that farmers can identify their needs and influence the rehabilitation agenda and its monitoring. \n \n16.  Value added by ADB. The project is expected to demonstrate the following innovations \nand/or value additions: \n(i)  Local currency financing. The project will provide tenge lending to KVK with a \nsovereign guarantee. This will be part of ADB\u2019s efforts to promote domestic \nfinancial markets as an alternative to foreign currency lending, which will help \ndevelop domestic capital markets and protect ADB\u2019s borrower from currency risk. \n(ii)  Tariff planning and asset management plan. The project will help improve \nKVK\u2019s capacity for tariff planning and financial sustainability. The project will \nsupport KVK to develop an asset management plan that will ensure cost recovery \nand lead to more sustainable irrigation systems. \n(iii)  Use of geogrid reinforcement concrete for cost effectiveness. The project \nteam will pilot-test the use of geogrids\u2014replacing the steel reinforcement of the \nconcrete lining of the irrigation canals, which will reduce the investment cost \nsubstantially. Geogrids are used widely and successfully for earth reinforcement \nin roads and for slope protection, but less often in irrigation canals. \n(iv)  Supervisory control and data acquisition system. The project will support the \ninstallation of a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system in the \nmain irrigation canals in each of the four provinces to help KVK control irrigation \nwater management locally or at remote locations by monitoring, gathering, and \nprocessing  real-time  data  for  effective  water  management.

The project is aligned with the following impact: the contribution of agricultural production \nto GDP increased (footnote 12). The project will have the following outcome: farm productivity \nincreased in East Kazakhstan, Karaghandy, Kyzylorda, and Zhambyl provinces.17 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n18.  Output 1: Irrigation infrastructure rehabilitated and/or improved. The project will \nsupport  the  rehabilitation  and/or  improvement  of  about  245  irrigation  schemes  in  the  four \nprovinces. For canals, the works would involve desilting and removing vegetation in the lined and \nunlined canals, re-sectioning the unlined canals, and repairing damaged sections of the lined \ncanals. The total length of new concrete-lined canals will be about 1,064 kilometers (km), while \nthat of improved earth canals will be about 1,976 km. About 4,185 hydraulic structures, including \nwater measuring devices, will be constructed or rehabilitated. About 358 km of drainage collectors \nwill be rehabilitated and/or improved, a drip irrigation system covering 9,300 ha will be established \nin Zhambyl, and about 24 SCADA systems will be installed in the main canals of the four \nprovinces. \n \n19.  Output 2: Water management improved and beneficiaries\u2019 capacity enhanced. The \nproject will support (i) pilot-testing a system to monitor water and agricultural productivity using \nremote  sensing  technology  in  selected  irrigation  schemes;  (ii)  assisting  in  organizing  the \nbeneficiaries into agricultural cooperatives, develop the capacity of the cooperatives for executing \ntheir function, and provide physical inputs such as office furniture and equipment; (iii) training \nfarmers  on  effective  irrigation  management  and  climate-change-related  aspects;  and  (iv) \nproviding capacity development consulting services. This output will help KVK extend its advisory \nservices to farmers on on-farm water management and crop choices. \n \n20.  Output 3: KVK\u2019s capacity strengthened. The project will strengthen KVK\u2019s governance \nand support its internal reforms by providing consulting services for (i) capacity development and \ntraining  of  KVK  staff  on  financial,  procurement,  and  water  management  aspects;  the \n(ii) formulation and implementation of an asset management plan. The project will also support \n(i) provision of machinery, equipment, and vehicles for the four KVK branch offices to carry out \ntheir O&M function and improve system performance; (ii) rehabilitation and/or construction of \nrepair workshops; (iii) construction of the KVK headquarters building; (iv) construction of an office \nbuilding for KVK\u2019s East Kazakhstan branch; (v) organization of a study tour for KVK staff and \nproject beneficiaries to learn from advanced irrigation practices; and (vi) the operations of the \nproject management office and project implementation units to ensure smooth implementation. \n \nD.

The loan, to be guaranteed by the Republic of Kazakhstan, \nin tenge will have a term of 20.5 years, including a grace period of 5 years; an interest rate equal \nto the sum of ADB\u2019s cost of funding, plus an effective contractual spread for sovereign-guaranteed \nloans of 0.50% per year; and a commitment charge of 0.15% per year on the undisbursed loan \namount. The loan is expected to be disbursed in 8\u201310 tranches, each for $20 million minimum in \ntenge equivalent. Subject to market conditions, ADB will provide tenge financing to fund the loan \nby amortized bonds with maturities of up to 10 years. ADB will also be able to provide financing \nin currencies where it can effectively intermediate, such as United States dollar. Based on \nstraight-line repayment method, the average loan maturity is 13 years, and there is no maturity \npremium payable to ADB. \n \n23.  The summary financing plan is in Table 2. ADB will finance the expenditures in relation to \ncivil works, goods, consulting services, and project management, including recurrent project \nmanagement costs and 75% of contingency costs, inclusive of taxes and duties. KVK will \ncontribute the balance to cover financial charges and 25% of contingency costs.  \n \nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \n  Amount    Share of Total \nSource  (T billion)  ($ million)     (%) \nAsian Development Bank         \nOrdinary capital resources (regular loan in local currency)  94.42  249.80    77.85 \nRepublican State Enterprise Kazvodkhoz  26.87  71.08    22.15 \nTotal  121.29  320.88    100.00 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n24.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n26.  A national design entity prepared the project taking into account the recommendations of \nthe transaction technical assistance (TA) consultants and following applicable Kazakh guidelines \nand regulations. The project feasibility study considered several alternatives and identified the \nmost suitable after due consideration of the irrigation systems\u2019 performance, cost effectiveness, \nand O&M requirements. The technical feasibility of the project was confirmed to be adequate after \ndetailed examination of local conditions, including current and projected climate variables, and \navailability of water resources. Key adaptation measures in the project design include capacity \ndevelopment of the project beneficiaries and KVK staff, covering various aspects of climate \n ", "8 \nchange, rehabilitation and construction of water metering structures, establishment of SCADA \nsystems, lining of irrigation canals, and development of drip irrigation. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n27.  The economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) were estimated for each project province \nand for the entire project. The EIRRs are 24.2% for East Kazakhstan, 14.8% for Karaghandy, \n27.3% for Kyzylorda, and 17.8% for Zhambyl. The EIRR of the project is 25.1%. Sensitivity \nanalyses show that the EIRRs for each province and the project are robust against adverse \nchanges in benefits and costs. A sensitivity analysis was also undertaken to assess the viability \nof irrigation rehabilitation at the provincial level if the expected shift in cropping patterns to higher-\nvalue crops does not occur, and the projected increase in crop yields is not achieved. In both \ncases, provincial and project viability are not significantly affected. \n \n28.  KVK\u2019s financial performance from 2014 to 2018 shows stable earnings before income tax, \ndepreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin. The company\u2019s debt level is historically low with \na 3% ratio of long-term debts to long-term assets. However, with capital investment gradually \nincreasing since 2017, KVK needs to adjust the water tariff to cover the investment cost. The \nfinancial analysis assumes that KVK will adjust the water tariff in line with tariff regulations for full \ncost recovery when obtaining loans from international institutions.20 The financial projection shows \nthat KVK is financially sustainable since revenues from sales exceed its operational costs. Water \nsupply services and water facilities are the main revenue source. This revenue stream will \nimprove with further upgrades to utilities and infrastructure, and further agricultural development. \n \n29.  The project is sustainable economically and financially. KVK and its branch offices in the \nfour provinces will be  strengthened  by the provision of consulting services and necessary \nequipment to improve their asset management, tariff planning, and O&M of irrigation and drainage \nnetworks. The project will enhance KVK\u2019s financial position by improving its main revenue stream \nfrom water supply and other services. A social survey conducted by the TA consultants indicated \nthat farmers are aware of the tariff structure and considered the tariffs fair and affordable. The \nproject will also strengthen agricultural cooperatives to help farmers diversify from low-value to \nhigh-value crops, thereby increasing their profit margins and making the farmers more affordable, \nwhich will lead to a virtuous cycle of improvement in irrigation service delivery, crop production, \nfarmer income, and ability and willingness to pay. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n30.  A financial management assessment of KVK was conducted by the TA consultants and \nthe  project  team  to  assess  its  capacity  to  implement  the  project  financially.  The  financial \nmanagement assessment concluded that the pre-mitigation risk is substantial. Although KVK staff \nhave experience with development partners\u2019 projects, they lack experience with ADB-financed \nprojects, disbursement procedures, and financial management requirements. ADB agreed on an \naction plan with KVK to mitigate the risk and enhance KVK\u2019s financial management. \n \n31.  A procurement risk assessment of KVK was undertaken by the project team to evaluate \nits capacity for conducting and managing procurement activities. The project procurement risk \nwas rated high because KVK has the following procurement weaknesses: (i) no experience with \nADB-financed projects and unfamiliarity with ADB procurement guidelines and procedures; (ii) \n                                                \n20 Order No. 710 approved by the Ministry of National Economy on 24 November 2015. Tariffs of products and services \nof natural monopolies in the country (such as KVK) are based on a cost-plus-fee principle. \n ", "9 \nlack of qualified national contractors that are familiar with international financial institutions\u2019 \nprocurement requirements; and (iii) inadequate ethics and anticorruption measures. ADB agreed \non an action plan with KVK to mitigate these risks. \n \n32.  Integrity due diligence on KVK identified no significant integrity risks. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the Government of \nKazakhstan  and  KVK.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 18). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n33.   A poverty, social, and gender assessment was conducted by the TA consultants and the \nproject team during project preparation, and the project has several measures built in to ensure \nsocial inclusion. The project is expected to reduce poverty among the local populations by making \nthe supply of irrigation water more reliable and introducing advanced farming technologies. The \nproject will directly benefit the well-being of the local populations who rely on farming as an \nimportant source of income. Both men and women are involved in farming, mainly through \npeasant farms. Households in the project-covered areas are mostly large rural families that are \nmore at risk of poverty, so addressing the problem of low agricultural yields and low farm income \nis particularly important. \n \n34.  Six project disclosure and public consultations were conducted by the TA consultants and \nproject team for all subprojects in the four project provinces. Farmers and residents from all the \nproject\u2019s districts participated in the public consultations, which were chaired by the heads and \ndeputy heads of the districts, KVK provincial branches, and local governments. Farmers and \nresidents expressed their need for the project and raised questions or made suggestions on its \ndesign and implementation. ADB and KVK will hold further consultations on the detailed design \nand during implementation to ensure that local people participate in and benefit from the project \nactivities. \n \n35.  The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming, and a gender action plan was \nprepared by KVK with TA consultants\u2019 assistance. Based on the social and gender assessment \nconducted during project preparation, gender entry points for the project outputs include (i) \nwomen\u2019s participation (30%) in public consultations in all project phases; (ii) women-owned and/or \n-led farms (20%) directly benefiting from rehabilitated irrigation infrastructure; (iii) women farmers\u2019 \nparticipation in training relevant to water management, agricultural practices, and operation and \nuse of water metering devices and other digital technologies; (iv) a gender diagnostic study of \nKVK; and (v) institutionalized reporting of the project\u2019s gender mainstreaming performance. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n36.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.21 \n \n37.  Environment  (category  B).  KVK,  with  help  from  TA  consultants,  prepared  four \nconsolidated initial environmental examination (IEE) reports, each for the project provinces, \nfollowing the Safeguard Policy Statement. The IEEs established that no project irrigation schemes \nare within or in proximity to specially protected areas or historical and cultural sites. Among the \nlikely adverse impacts of the project during construction are soil erosion and surface water \n                                                \n21 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n ", "10 \npollution, air quality and noise pollution, and construction waste. However, because of the \nrehabilitative nature of the project\u2019s physical activities, which will be contained within the rights-\nof-way of the canals, the environmental impacts during construction will be site-specific and \ntemporary. During operation, there is a risk of improper use of pesticides and fertilizers resulting \nin  water  contamination.  The  IEEs  include  environmental  management  plans  that  will  be \nimplemented through site-specific environmental management plans prepared by contractors and \napproved by the construction supervision consultants and the project implementation units for \neach province. The environmental management capacity of KVK is inadequate, and consultants \nwill assist KVK in building up its potential through workshops and on-site training on environmental \nmanagement. The project management office will also include an environment officer to manage \nthe implementation of the environmental management plans. Public consultations on the project \nwere conducted by the TA consultants in all four provinces from November 2018 to February \n2019. \n \n38.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). Due diligence identified no land acquisition and \nresettlement impacts. Due diligence looked into the (i) rehabilitation of existing 549 canals, 23 \npipelines, and 43 drain ditches in 245 irrigation schemes to be supported by the project; and (ii) \nconstruction of the KVK headquarters building in Nur-Sultan, the capital city. It found that the \ncanals and ditches are state-owned and the land for the construction of the KVK building is owned \nby the municipality. Project works include rehabilitation of the irrigation canals to their original \ndesigns (with and without lining) without widening or changing their rights-of-way, routes, layouts, \nand capacities. Following the main principle and objective of the Safeguard Policy Statement, the \nproject design incorporated appropriate civil works technologies to avoid any adverse impact. The \ndetails were discussed in the due diligence report and their implementation will be monitored and \nreported by KVK through semiannual and annual social safeguard reports.22 A grievance redress \nmechanism has been established, including appointment of the staff of district and provincial \nauthorities as well as provincial and central KVK staff. Disclosure and public consultations were \ncarried out by the TA consultants and project team in all project areas in line with Safeguard Policy \nStatement requirements, and will continue to take place during the project implementation. Since \nKVK is new to ADB-financed projects, ADB will arrange capacity building workshops and on-the-\njob-training for KVK staff on social safeguards. \n \n39.  Indigenous peoples (category C). No ethnic minority communities are present in the \nproject area, and the project does not trigger ADB\u2019s policy requirements on indigenous peoples \nunder the Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n40.
