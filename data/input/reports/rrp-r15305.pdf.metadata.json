Since  the  Government\u2019s  request  would \naffect all ADB loans to NPC, the Board\u2019s approval is considered required.  \n \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND \n\nA. \n\nThe Sector \n\n2. \nIn  the  early  1990s,  the  Philippines  experienced  severe  power  shortages,  leading  to \nprolonged  blackouts  and  adverse  economic  impacts.  As  an  emergency  action  and  with  the \nsupport of Government, NPC contracted to purchase power from independent producers (IPPs) \non a take or pay basis. Most of the contracts were denominated in foreign currency. Although \nthis  action  eased  the  power  shortage,  the  subsequent  Asian  financial  crisis  suppressed \nelectricity  demand  and  left  NPC  with  an  oversupply  of  generation  capacity.  The  result  of  this \ncombination  of  factors  was  that  NPC  had  to  continue  paying  -  in  increasingly  more  expensive \nforeign  currency  -  for  unused  power  that  it  could  not  in  turn  sell.  For  a  time,  NPC\u2019s  upwardly \nspiraling  debt  burden  was  serviced  through  commercial  borrowings  by  NPC  and  the \nGovernment.  This  strategy  became  unsustainable  with  the  continuous  slide  of  the  peso,  the \nprevailing low electricity demand, and the low tariffs charged by NPC. \n \n3. \nIn  2000,  Government  restructured  the  power  sector  to  make  it  more  efficient,  and  to \nreduce its long term negative impact on the fiscal position of the Government. The centerpiece \nof  the  restructuring  was  the  passage  of  the  EPIRA  in  June  2001.  Among  other  things,  EPIRA \ncreated  TRANSCO  to  take  over  NPC  transmission  assets,  and  created  PSALM  to  be \nresponsible  for  repaying  all  of  NPC\u2019s  existing  debt  obligations,  privatizing  all  of  its  generation \nassets,  and  privatizing  the  transmission  operations  through  a  concession. 2 The  adjustment \ncosts of the reform were supported in part by ADB\u2019s $300 million Power Sector Reform Program \n(PSRP).3 \n \nB. \n\nADB\u2019s Assistance to the Sector \n\n4. \nADB  has  provided  20  loans  to  NPC  (the  \u201cLoans\u201d),  all  of  which  are  guaranteed  by  the \nRepublic  of  the  Philippines  (the  \u201cGuarantees\u201d).4 The  loans  had  a  combined  value  of  $1,597 \nmillion (or $1,224 million, net of cancellations).5 In addition to its lending, ADB has provided 34 \ntechnical  assistance  grants  to  the  energy  sector  totaling  about  $15  million.  These  cover  the \n                                                 \n1   Created under EPIRA in 2001. \n2   EPIRA  also  mandated  the  establishment  of  an  independent  electricity  regulator,  and  an  open  and  competitive \n\nelectricity market. \n\n3   ADB.  1998.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  and \nTechnical  Assistance  Grants  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for  the  Power  Sector  Restructuring  Program. \nManila.  \n\n4   Under NPC\u2019s Charter, all obligations of NPC are automatically guaranteed by the Republic of the Philippines and \n\nare excluded from the national borrowing and guarantee ceilings set in the Foreign Borrowings Act. \n\n5   The  Loans  are  governed  by  Loan  Agreements  (the  \u201cLoan  Agreements\u201d),  and  the  Guarantees  by  Guarantee \n\nAgreements (the \u201cGuarantee Agreements\u201d). These are listed in Appendix 2.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nareas of power generation and transmission; power development planning; rural electrification; \ntariff  and  pricing  studies;  regulation;  consumer  impact  assessments;  feasibility  studies;  and \nenvironmental  assessments,  as  well  as  energy  conservation;  coal  industry  development;  and \ngeothermal steam and natural gas pricing studies. The list of the loans and TAs is included in \nAppendix 1. As of 31 March 2005, 11 loans had been fully repaid. Nine loans with a total current \nprincipal  amount  of  $562.2  million  equivalent,  remain  outstanding  and  unpaid  (Appendix  2). \nAmong these nine loans, eight loans have been completed and one loan is being implemented. \nIn addition, in November 1995, ADB provided a partial credit guarantee (PCG) in the form of a \nput-option  deed  (the  \u201cPut-Option  Deed\u201d)  for  credit  enhancement  of  NPC\u2019s  \u00a512  billion  bond \nissue, due in 2015, with a Government counter-guarantee in the form of a counter-put option. In \nDecember 2002, ADB provided a PCG to support the \u00a524.75 billion ($200 million equivalent) 18-\nyear PSALM bond, and the \u00a537 billion ($300 million equivalent) 20-year PSALM bond. The PCG \nwas  counter-guaranteed  by  the  Government.  The  PSALM  bonds  were  issued  to  cover  the \nfunding  gap  resulting  from  a  timing  mismatch  between  the  receipt  of  expected  revenues  and \ncash outflows, particularly in the initial stages of the privatization process.  \n \n\n \n\nIII. \n\nREQUEST FOR CONSENT \n\n5. \nFour years after the passage of the EPIRA, the Philippine power sector is now at a cross \nroad. With continued support from ADB, the basic ground work has been laid for an open and \ncompetitive  electricity  market  with  opportunities  for  improved  efficiencies,  and  greater  private \nsector  participation.  On  the  other  hand,  prospects  for  large  scale  expansion  of  generation \ncapacity  and  sustained  improvements  in  transmission  would  be  viable  only  in  the  context  of \nprivatized sector operations.6 In line with the ongoing policy dialogue on the power sector, there \nhave  been  initial  steps  at  privatizing  the  NPC  assets.  PSALM  has  successfully  sold  to  private \ninvestors  five  mini-hydro  power  plants.7 The  Government  has  also  tendered  and  awarded  the \n600 megawatt Masinloc coal-fired power plant. The transaction is expected to be completed in \nDecember  2005,  upon  completion  of  conditions  precedent  to  financial  close  including  the \nprovision of creditors\u2019 consent. Another medium sized plant, the 600 megawatt coal-fired Calaca \npower  plant,  is  scheduled  to  be  tendered  late  in  July  this  year.  There  have  also  been  initial \nattempts to privatize the transmission operations through a concession agreement, but actions \nin this area still need to progress further. With advice from international and domestic experts, \nand  in  consultation  with  the  national  oversight  agencies  and  Congress,  PSALM  continues  to \ndevelop  strategies  and  transaction  documents  that  would  best  serve  the  purpose  of \nprivatization.  But  in  order  for  PSALM  to  pursue  privatization  at  a  faster  and  sustained  pace,  it \nneeds to assure the potential bidders that NPC\u2019s creditors have consented to the sale of NPC\u2019s \nassets. \n \n6. \nSince  the  Loan  Agreements  provide  that  NPC  cannot  sell  its  assets,  except  in  the \nnormal  course  of  business  or  with  the  consent  of  ADB,  the  Government  and  NPC  are  now \nrequesting  ADB  to  (i)  provide  NPC  with  the  necessary  consents  to  transfer  certain  of  its \ngeneration  assets  to  PSALM  and  all  of  its  transmission  and  sub-transmission  assets  to \nTRANSCO  (paragraph  9);  (ii)  permit  PSALM  to  subsequently  sell  to  private  investors  the \ngeneration  assets  financed  under  the  Loan  Agreements,  the  Guarantee  Agreements,  and  the \nPut  Option  Deed,  and  to  lease  TRANSCO\u2019s  assets  through  the  grant  of  a  transmission \nconcession to the private sector (paragraph 11); (iii) allow for PSALM\u2019s accession to the Loan \nAgreements  as  co-obligor  of  NPC  (paragraph  9);  and  (iv)  make  certain  changes  to  the  Loan \n                                                 \n6  Only if there is, in the determination by the President of the Philippines, an imminent shortage of power supply, may \n\nCongress authorize additional generating capacity. \n\n7   To facilitate completion of the mini-hydro sales, and considering the restricted impact of these plants on the NPC \n\nasset base, ADB consented to the sales. \n\n\f3 \n\nAgreements  to  address  the  fact  that  (a)  PSALM,  and  subsequently  a  third  party  investor,  and \nnot  NPC,  will  be  the  legal  and  beneficial  owner  of  the  relevant  generation  assets;  and  (b) \nTRANSCO,  not  NPC,  will  be  the  legal  and  beneficial  owner  of  the  transmission  and  sub-\ntransmission assets financed by the Loans (paragraph 14).  \n\nIV. \n\nAMENDMENTS TO RELEVANT AGREEMENTS \n\n \n\nA. \n\nOmnibus Amendment Agreement \n\n7. \nIt is critical for the success of the restructuring that ADB provide the requested consent. \nHowever, in order for ADB to provide this consent, appropriate amendments need to be made to \nthe  Loan  and  Guarantee  Agreements  and  Put-Option  Deed.  ADB  staff  together  with \nGovernment,  NPC,  PSALM  and  TRANSCO  officials  have  negotiated  and  drafted  such  an \namendment agreement (the \u201cOmnibus Amendment Agreement\u201d).8  \n \n8. \nThe  parties  to  the  Omnibus  Amendment  Agreement  will  be  NPC  as  the  Borrower  and \ntransferor of assets, PSALM as the Co-obligor and transferee of generation assets, TRANSCO \nas the Transferee of the transmission assets, the Republic of the Philippines as the Guarantor, \nand ADB as the Lender. The Omnibus Amendment Agreement provides for two phases. \n \nB. \n\nPhase I: Co-Obligor Structure on Liabilities; Maintenance of Guarantees \n\n9. \nUnder  Phase  I,  ADB  agrees  that  (i)  NPC  will  transfer  its  generation  assets  to  PSALM \nand  its  transmission  assets  to  TRANSCO;  (ii)  PSALM  may  then  proceed  to  privatize  the \ngeneration  assets  and  the  transmission  concession;  and  (iii)  in  consideration  of  the  asset \ntransfer, PSALM will accede to the Loan Agreements and become a co-obligor of NPC for all of \nNPC\u2019s liabilities and obligations, including the Loans. Under such arrangement, both NPC and \nPSALM  will  be  contractually  liable  to  pay  ADB  the  full  amount  of  the  outstanding  Loans,  in \naccordance  with  the  originally  agreed  repayment  schedule.  As  a  practical  matter,  scheduled \nrepayments may be serviced by either NPC or PSALM, and ADB will be entitled to receive such \nservice payments. By the same token, ADB may seek full or partial payment from NPC, PSALM, \nor both, of all Loans that are due and payable. It is noted that this phase occurs after execution \nof  the  Omnibus  Amendment  Agreement  and  the  completion  of  certain  conditions  precedent, \nincluding the formal delivery of legal opinions and corporate clearances. \n \n10. \nDuring Phase I, although PSALM accedes as a co-obligor of NPC, ADB will continue to \nenjoy  the  full  benefits  of  the  Guarantees.  The  Republic  of  the  Philippines  will  continue  to \nunconditionally  guarantee,  as  primary  obligor  and  not  merely  as  surety,  the  due  and  punctual \nrepayment of all the Loans. The Republic of the Philippines will also waive any new contractual \nor statutory defenses that may arise as a result of the Omnibus Amendment Agreement or the \naccession of PSALM as a co-obligor of NPC.  \n \n11. \nADB will confirm it has no objections to the transfer of assets from NPC to PSALM and \nTRANSCO,  and  the  eventual  sale  or  lease  of  those  assets  to  the  private  sector  in  order  to \nprivatize the assets and operations of NPC.  \n \n12. \nThe  Omnibus  Amendment  Agreement  provides  that  when  generation  assets  and  the \ntransmission operations are privatized, the controlling entity at various points will be obligated to \ncomply with relevant project implementation covenants and ADB safeguard policies that NPC, \n\n                                                 \n8   Copies will be available upon request. \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nas original executing agency, had committed to undertake or accomplish. There will, however, \nbe no impact on the actual scope of the projects financed by the Loans. \n \nC. \n\nPhase II: PSALM as Sole Obligor \n\n13. \nPhase II will occur if the Republic of the Philippines unconditionally guarantees the due \nand punctual repayment of all the Loans it proposes to completely and finally transfer to PSALM \n(pursuant to which transfer PSALM becomes the Borrower and not merely a co-obligor of NPC). \nThe Omnibus Amendment Agreement provides that in such event, ADB will agree to the full and \ncomplete transfer to PSALM of all then outstanding Loans. Upon the commencement of Phase \nII, NPC will cease to be a Borrower and will no longer be liable to repay any Loan. PSALM will \nbecome the Borrower and will be solely liable to repay all the outstanding Loans. Although the \noccurrence  of  this  phase  is  not  necessary,  it  provides  the  legal  framework  for  any  future \ndecision  by  the  Government  to  remove  the  Loans  from  NPC\u2019s  financial  books  and  to  transfer \nthem completely to the financial books of PSALM. \n \nD. \n\nSpecial Consent for the Masinloc Power Plant \n\n14. \nConsidering  the  size  of  the  Masinloc  plant,  its  strategic  impact  on  the  privatization  of \nNPC  and  the  restructuring  of  the  power  sector,  and  the  advanced  stage  of  its  privatization \nprocess, it is recommended that ADB waive NPC\u2019s covenant not to sell Masinloc, and allow the \nsale of Masinloc to be completed prior to the effectiveness of Phase I. Considering Phase I is \nexpected  to  have  occurred  in  time  for  all  other  privatization  transactions,  no  further  special \nconsents are expected to be required. \n\nE. \n\nOther Lenders \n\n \n\nThe  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC),  and  the  Organization  of  the \n15. \nPetroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Fund for International Development, as co-financiers of \nADB-financed  projects,  did  not  object  to  ADB\u2019s  agreement  to  the  requested  transfers.  In  fact, \nJBIC  is  processing  the  Government\u2019s  request  and  the  OPEC  Fund  has  provided  its  consent. \nThe  World  Bank  was  also  consulted.  It  is  currently  completing  the  process  of  considering  the \nGovernment\u2019s request. \n \n\nV. \n\nTHE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n\nIn view of the foregoing, the President recommends that the Board (i) agree to provide \n16. \nthe  requested  consents,  subject  to  the  Omnibus  Amendment  Agreement,  (ii)  authorize  the \nexecution  and  performance  of  Omnibus  Amendment  Agreement  and  related  agreements,  as \ndescribed  in  paragraphs  7\u201314,  and  (iii)  agree  to  the  immediate  sale  of  NPC\u2019s  600  megawatt \nMasinloc coal-fired power plant.
