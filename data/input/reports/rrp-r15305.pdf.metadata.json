Pursuant to Section 49 of Republic Act No. 9136, or the Electric Power Industry Reform \nAct (EPIRA) of 2001, the Government of the Republic of the Philippines (the Government) and \nthe National Power Corporation (NPC) requested ADB\u2019s consent to transfer all liabilities and \ngeneration assets of NPC to the Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation \n(PSALM),1 and  to  transfer  all  the  transmission  and  sub-transmission  assets  to  National \nTransmission Corporation (TRANSCO) (footnote 1). Since the Government\u2019s request would \naffect all ADB loans to NPC, the Board\u2019s approval is considered required.  \n \nII.  BACKGROUND \nA.  The Sector \n2.  In the early 1990s, the Philippines experienced severe power shortages, leading to \nprolonged blackouts and adverse economic impacts. As an emergency action and with the \nsupport of Government, NPC contracted to purchase power from independent producers (IPPs) \non a take or pay basis. Most of the contracts were denominated in foreign currency. Although \nthis  action  eased  the  power  shortage,  the  subsequent  Asian  financial  crisis  suppressed \nelectricity demand and left NPC with an oversupply of generation capacity. The result of this \ncombination of factors was that NPC had to continue paying - in increasingly more expensive \nforeign currency - for unused power that it could not in turn sell. For a time, NPC\u2019s upwardly \nspiraling  debt  burden  was  serviced  through  commercial  borrowings  by  NPC  and  the \nGovernment. This strategy became unsustainable with the continuous slide of the peso, the \nprevailing low electricity demand, and the low tariffs charged by NPC. \n \n3.  In 2000, Government restructured the power sector to make it more efficient, and to \nreduce its long term negative impact on the fiscal position of the Government. The centerpiece \nof the restructuring was the passage of the EPIRA in June 2001. Among other things, EPIRA \ncreated  TRANSCO  to  take  over  NPC  transmission  assets,  and  created  PSALM  to  be \nresponsible for repaying all of NPC\u2019s existing debt obligations, privatizing all of its generation \nassets, and privatizing the transmission operations through a concession.2 The adjustment \ncosts of the reform were supported in part by ADB\u2019s $300 million Power Sector Reform Program \n(PSRP).3 \n \nB.  ADB\u2019s Assistance to the Sector \n4.  ADB has provided 20 loans to NPC (the \u201cLoans\u201d), all of which are guaranteed by the \nRepublic of the Philippines (the \u201cGuarantees\u201d).4 The loans had a combined value of $1,597 \nmillion (or $1,224 million, net of cancellations).5 In addition to its lending, ADB has provided 34 \ntechnical assistance grants to the energy sector totaling about $15 million. These cover the \n                                                 \n1  Created under EPIRA in 2001. \n2  EPIRA also mandated the establishment of an independent electricity regulator, and an open and competitive \nelectricity market. \n3  ADB. 1998. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan and \nTechnical Assistance Grants to the Republic of the Philippines for the Power Sector Restructuring Program. \nManila.  \n4  Under NPC\u2019s Charter, all obligations of NPC are automatically guaranteed by the Republic of the Philippines and \nare excluded from the national borrowing and guarantee ceilings set in the Foreign Borrowings Act. \n5  The Loans are governed by Loan Agreements (the \u201cLoan Agreements\u201d), and the Guarantees by Guarantee \nAgreements (the \u201cGuarantee Agreements\u201d). These are listed in Appendix 2.  ", "2   \nareas of power generation and transmission; power development planning; rural electrification; \ntariff and pricing studies; regulation; consumer impact assessments; feasibility studies; and \nenvironmental assessments, as well as energy conservation; coal industry development; and \ngeothermal steam and natural gas pricing studies. The list of the loans and TAs is included in \nAppendix 1. As of 31 March 2005, 11 loans had been fully repaid. Nine loans with a total current \nprincipal amount of $562.2 million equivalent, remain outstanding and unpaid (Appendix 2). \nAmong these nine loans, eight loans have been completed and one loan is being implemented. \nIn addition, in November 1995, ADB provided a partial credit guarantee (PCG) in the form of a \nput-option deed (the \u201cPut-Option Deed\u201d) for credit enhancement of NPC\u2019s \u00a512 billion bond \nissue, due in 2015, with a Government counter-guarantee in the form of a counter-put option. In \nDecember 2002, ADB provided a PCG to support the \u00a524.75 billion ($200 million equivalent) 18-\nyear PSALM bond, and the \u00a537 billion ($300 million equivalent) 20-year PSALM bond. The PCG \nwas counter-guaranteed by the Government. The PSALM bonds were issued to cover the \nfunding gap resulting from a timing mismatch between the receipt of expected revenues and \ncash outflows, particularly in the initial stages of the privatization process.  \n   \nIII.  REQUEST FOR CONSENT \n5.  Four years after the passage of the EPIRA, the Philippine power sector is now at a cross \nroad. With continued support from ADB, the basic ground work has been laid for an open and \ncompetitive electricity market with opportunities for improved efficiencies, and greater private \nsector participation. On the other hand, prospects for large scale expansion of generation \ncapacity and sustained improvements in transmission would be viable only in the context of \nprivatized sector operations.6 In line with the ongoing policy dialogue on the power sector, there \nhave been initial steps at privatizing the NPC assets. PSALM has successfully sold to private \ninvestors five mini-hydro power plants.7 The Government has also tendered and awarded the \n600 megawatt Masinloc coal-fired power plant. The transaction is expected to be completed in \nDecember  2005,  upon  completion  of  conditions  precedent  to  financial  close  including  the \nprovision of creditors\u2019 consent. Another medium sized plant, the 600 megawatt coal-fired Calaca \npower plant, is scheduled to be tendered late in July this year. There have also been initial \nattempts to privatize the transmission operations through a concession agreement, but actions \nin this area still need to progress further. With advice from international and domestic experts, \nand in consultation with the national oversight agencies and Congress, PSALM continues to \ndevelop  strategies  and  transaction  documents  that  would  best  serve  the  purpose  of \nprivatization. But in order for PSALM to pursue privatization at a faster and sustained pace, it \nneeds to assure the potential bidders that NPC\u2019s creditors have consented to the sale of NPC\u2019s \nassets. \n \n6.  Since the Loan Agreements provide that NPC cannot sell its assets, except in the \nnormal course of business or with the consent of ADB, the Government and NPC are now \nrequesting  ADB  to  (i)  provide  NPC  with  the  necessary  consents  to  transfer  certain  of  its \ngeneration  assets  to  PSALM  and  all  of  its  transmission  and  sub-transmission  assets  to \nTRANSCO  (paragraph  9);  (ii)  permit  PSALM  to  subsequently  sell  to  private  investors  the \ngeneration assets financed under the Loan Agreements, the Guarantee Agreements, and the \nPut  Option  Deed,  and  to  lease  TRANSCO\u2019s  assets  through  the  grant  of  a  transmission \nconcession to the private sector (paragraph 11); (iii) allow for PSALM\u2019s accession to the Loan \nAgreements as co-obligor of NPC (paragraph 9); and (iv) make certain changes to the Loan \n                                                 \n6  Only if there is, in the determination by the President of the Philippines, an imminent shortage of power supply, may \nCongress authorize additional generating capacity. \n7  To facilitate completion of the mini-hydro sales, and considering the restricted impact of these plants on the NPC \nasset base, ADB consented to the sales. ", "3 \nAgreements to address the fact that (a) PSALM, and subsequently a third party investor, and \nnot NPC, will be the legal and beneficial owner of the relevant generation assets; and (b) \nTRANSCO, not NPC, will be the legal and beneficial owner of the transmission and sub-\ntransmission assets financed by the Loans (paragraph 14).  \n \nIV.  AMENDMENTS TO RELEVANT AGREEMENTS \nA.  Omnibus Amendment Agreement \n7.  It is critical for the success of the restructuring that ADB provide the requested consent. \nHowever, in order for ADB to provide this consent, appropriate amendments need to be made to \nthe  Loan  and  Guarantee  Agreements  and  Put-Option  Deed.  ADB  staff  together  with \nGovernment,  NPC,  PSALM  and  TRANSCO  officials  have  negotiated  and  drafted  such  an \namendment agreement (the \u201cOmnibus Amendment Agreement\u201d).8  \n \n8.  The parties to the Omnibus Amendment Agreement will be NPC as the Borrower and \ntransferor of assets, PSALM as the Co-obligor and transferee of generation assets, TRANSCO \nas the Transferee of the transmission assets, the Republic of the Philippines as the Guarantor, \nand ADB as the Lender. The Omnibus Amendment Agreement provides for two phases. \n \nB.  Phase I: Co-Obligor Structure on Liabilities; Maintenance of Guarantees \n9.  Under Phase I, ADB agrees that (i) NPC will transfer its generation assets to PSALM \nand  its  transmission  assets  to  TRANSCO;  (ii)  PSALM  may  then  proceed  to  privatize  the \ngeneration  assets  and  the  transmission  concession;  and  (iii)  in  consideration  of  the  asset \ntransfer, PSALM will accede to the Loan Agreements and become a co-obligor of NPC for all of \nNPC\u2019s liabilities and obligations, including the Loans. Under such arrangement, both NPC and \nPSALM will be contractually liable to pay ADB the full amount of the outstanding Loans, in \naccordance with the originally agreed repayment schedule. As a practical matter, scheduled \nrepayments may be serviced by either NPC or PSALM, and ADB will be entitled to receive such \nservice payments. By the same token, ADB may seek full or partial payment from NPC, PSALM, \nor both, of all Loans that are due and payable. It is noted that this phase occurs after execution \nof the Omnibus Amendment Agreement and the completion of certain conditions precedent, \nincluding the formal delivery of legal opinions and corporate clearances. \n \n10.  During Phase I, although PSALM accedes as a co-obligor of NPC, ADB will continue to \nenjoy the full benefits of the Guarantees. The Republic of the Philippines will continue to \nunconditionally guarantee, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, the due and punctual \nrepayment of all the Loans. The Republic of the Philippines will also waive any new contractual \nor statutory defenses that may arise as a result of the Omnibus Amendment Agreement or the \naccession of PSALM as a co-obligor of NPC.  \n \n11.  ADB will confirm it has no objections to the transfer of assets from NPC to PSALM and \nTRANSCO, and the eventual sale or lease of those assets to the private sector in order to \nprivatize the assets and operations of NPC.  \n \n12.  The Omnibus Amendment Agreement provides that when generation assets and the \ntransmission operations are privatized, the controlling entity at various points will be obligated to \ncomply with relevant project implementation covenants and ADB safeguard policies that NPC, \n                                                 \n8  Copies will be available upon request. ", "4   \nas original executing agency, had committed to undertake or accomplish. There will, however, \nbe no impact on the actual scope of the projects financed by the Loans. \n \nC.  Phase II: PSALM as Sole Obligor \n13.  Phase II will occur if the Republic of the Philippines unconditionally guarantees the due \nand punctual repayment of all the Loans it proposes to completely and finally transfer to PSALM \n(pursuant to which transfer PSALM becomes the Borrower and not merely a co-obligor of NPC). \nThe Omnibus Amendment Agreement provides that in such event, ADB will agree to the full and \ncomplete transfer to PSALM of all then outstanding Loans. Upon the commencement of Phase \nII, NPC will cease to be a Borrower and will no longer be liable to repay any Loan. PSALM will \nbecome the Borrower and will be solely liable to repay all the outstanding Loans. Although the \noccurrence  of  this  phase  is  not  necessary,  it  provides  the  legal  framework  for  any  future \ndecision by the Government to remove the Loans from NPC\u2019s financial books and to transfer \nthem completely to the financial books of PSALM. \n \nD.  Special Consent for the Masinloc Power Plant \n14.  Considering the size of the Masinloc plant, its strategic impact on the privatization of \nNPC and the restructuring of the power sector, and the advanced stage of its privatization \nprocess, it is recommended that ADB waive NPC\u2019s covenant not to sell Masinloc, and allow the \nsale of Masinloc to be completed prior to the effectiveness of Phase I. Considering Phase I is \nexpected to have occurred in time for all other privatization transactions, no further special \nconsents are expected to be required. \n \nE.  Other Lenders \n15.  The  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC), and  the  Organization  of  the \nPetroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Fund for International Development, as co-financiers of \nADB-financed projects, did not object to ADB\u2019s agreement to the requested transfers. In fact, \nJBIC is processing the Government\u2019s request and the OPEC Fund has provided its consent. \nThe World Bank was also consulted. It is currently completing the process of considering the \nGovernment\u2019s request. \n \nV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n16.  In view of the foregoing, the President recommends that the Board (i) agree to provide \nthe requested consents, subject to the Omnibus Amendment Agreement, (ii) authorize the \nexecution and performance of Omnibus Amendment Agreement and related agreements, as \ndescribed in paragraphs 7\u201314, and (iii) agree to the immediate sale of NPC\u2019s 600 megawatt \nMasinloc coal-fired power plant.
