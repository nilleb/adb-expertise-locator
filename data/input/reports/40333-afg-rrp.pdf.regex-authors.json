An  initial  environmental  examination  has  been \nAssessment  performed on the Bala Murghab to Leman road, and the summary of \nthe initial environmental examination is included in Supplementary \nAppendix G.  \n   \nProject Description  The  Road  Network  Development  Project  1  comprises  four \ncomponents: (i) construction, (ii) ancillary and emergency works, (iii) \nmaintenance,  and  (iv)  business  process  development.  The  main \nactivity of the first component is construction of a 143-kilometer (km), \ntwo-lane road from Bala Murghab to Leman, which is part of the \ncritical missing link of the Ring Road1. The ancillary and emergency \nworks component will allow rapid reconstruction and rehabilitation of \ncritical  road  infrastructure  that  have  been  damaged  due  to  the \ncontinuing conflict or designed at suboptimal levels for construction \nunder  emergency  conditions.  It  is  a  cost-effective  mechanism  of \nproviding financing for uncertain and unprogrammed works. \n \nThe maintenance component will help ensure sustainability of ADB\u2019s \nprevious road investment in Afghanistan by facilitating performance-\nbased maintenance on at least 1,000 km of roads. The business \nprocess development component will help increase the road network \nmanagement  capacity  of  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  (MPW) \nthrough  (i)  project  support  through  specialists  on  maintenance \ncontract administration, bridge and pavement management, right-of-\nway  preservation,  and  environmental  management;  and  (ii) \nimplementation of a management information system (MIS). Taken \ntogether, the four components of the Project will increase overall \nbenefits to road users and communities in Afghanistan. \n   \nRationale  Due  to  the  terrain  and  the  pattern  of  human  settlement,  road \ntransport is the only technically and economically feasible mode of \ntransport in many parts of Afghanistan. Since 2002, the international \ncommunity has provided nearly $2 billion to improve and pave 96% \nof the regional road network (the Ring Road and links from it to the \ninternational borders) and 35% of the national road network (roads \nconnecting provincial  capitals).  ADB  has  contributed  $429  million \ntowards  this.  However,  without  the  road  from  Bala  Murghab  to \n                                                 \n1   The Ring Road, parts of which were paved in the 1960s, connects all major cities in Afghanistan, and has served \nas the main thoroughfare for centuries. \n ", "ii \n \nLeman, the Ring Road is unable to fully perform its intended role as \nthe  backbone  of  the  national  transportation  system  and  principal \nconduit for national and international passenger and freight traffic. In \ntotal,  nearly  $3  billion  is  required  to  repair  or  construct  the  key \ncomponents  of  the  34,000  km  road  network,  including  the  Bala \nMurghab\u2013Leman road. To that end, the international community has \npledged  approximately  $1  billion  over  the  next  3  years,  but \nAfghanistan needs a further $2 billion to provide a minimum level of \nnationwide mobility. \n \nMost donors, including ADB, procured civil works on road projects on \na  design-build  basis.  While  this  method  of  procurement  has \nexpedited implementation, it has also required design variations. The \ncontinuing  conflict  has  resulted  in  increased  material  prices  and \ndamaged  road  assets.  These  conditions  have  created  several \nfinancial challenges for MPW, contractors, and consultants, and the \nneed for nontraditional financing mechanisms.  \n \nThe total annual cost of maintenance of the regional road network is \nexpected to increase from about $6 million in 2007 to approximately \n$25 million by 2012. At the 2006 London Conference Afghanistan2 \nagreed  to  establish  a  financially  sustainable  road  maintenance \nprogram by the end of 2007. However, in the absence of a reliable \nbasis of cost recovery, financial assistance from donors is needed to \nimplement  a  systematic  preventative  maintenance  program  and \npreserve the value of past and future road investment.  \n \nSeveral critical gaps in the Government\u2019s business process constrain \nthe  implementation  of  an  efficient  program  of  investment  and \nmaintenance. These gaps, which are exacerbated by the human and \noperating resource constraints, must be bridged with technology and \nknowledge transfer.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The Project will contribute to the growth of Afghanistan\u2019s domestic \nand international trade. The main outcomes of the Project will be (i) \nhigher levels of mobility and the supply of intercity, interprovincial, \nand international transport services; (ii) increased levels of service \non critical road sections; and (iii) an increase in service life of the \nregional road network. \n   \nProject Investment  The  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $180  million \nPlan  equivalent, including taxes and duties. \n   \n \nFinancing Plan  Afghanistan  has  requested  ADB  to  help  finance  part  of  its  road \n  investment program through a grant in the amount of up to $176 \nmillion from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources.  \n   \n \n                                                                                                                                                          \n2  ADB. 2006.

It will be strengthened with \nadditional staff and remain functional for the duration of the Project. \nThe project director heading the PMU will continue to be in charge of \nday-to-day  management  of  the  Project  and  will  be  supported  by \nspecialists recruited or seconded from MPW. Additionally, every 3 \nmonths MPW will assign two engineers to the PMU, to be trained by \nits  full-time  staff  in  functions  such  as  project  design  and \nmanagement.  \n \nADB\u2019s  project  administration  division  has  developed  a  detailed \ntracking system for monitoring all preconstruction and construction \nphase activities, which include procurement and disbursement. This \nsystem  will  be  maintained  jointly  by  the  PMU  and  the  project \nadministration division to enable the activities of both parties to be \nsynchronized  and  any  deviations  from  planned  activities  and \ndisbursements to be reported to ADB and MPW. Additionally, it will \nhelp  improve  timeliness  and  accuracy  of  ADB\u2019s  consultant \nrecruitment  activity  monitoring,  public  disclosure  information,  and \nproject performance reports. \n   \n \nMonitoring,  ADB will closely monitor finalization of the resettlement plan for the \nEvaluation, and  Bala Murghab to Leman road and its implementation to ensure that, \nReporting  in accordance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), all \nArrangements  compensation  is  paid  before  land  acquisition  and  demolition  of \nproperty occurs. MPW will develop a project performance monitoring \nsystem which will contain baseline values of indicators, targets, and \nmilestones  corresponding  to  the  expected  impacts,  outcomes, \noutputs,  and  activities  identified  in  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework, and other relevant measures agreed between ADB and \nMPW. \n ", "iv \n \n  \nThe  works  supervision  consultants  will  collect  baseline  data  on \nphysical components of the Project through consultations with local \ncommunities,  field  observations,  and  measurements.  MPW  will \ncollect baseline data on nonphysical components. The collection of \ndata will continue during implementation of the Project, and data will \nbe  analyzed  every  12  months.  Results  of  the  analyses,  and \ncorrective  measures  (if  any)  taken  will  be  reported  in  MPW\u2019s \nquarterly progress report following the analyses.  \n \nMPW will also perform a complete analysis of related primary and \nsecondary  data  on  impacts  and  outcomes  within  1  month  of \ncompletion  of  the  Project.  The  results  of  that  analysis  will  be \ncontained in the Recipient\u2019s project completion report to ADB, which \nwill be submitted within 3 months of completion of the Project.  \n   \nProcurement of  Goods  and  works  financed  from  the  grant  will  be  procured  in \nWorks, Goods, and  accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended \nServices  from  time  to  time).  Consulting  services  from  firms  and  individual \nexperts will be procured according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Specific \nprocedures  have  been  agreed  between  ADB  and  MPW  and  are \noutlined in the procurement plan (Appendix 8). The procurement plan \nwill be updated at least annually covering the next 18 months of \nprocurement activity. \n   \nAdvance Contracting  ADB has approved advance contracting and retroactive financing \nand Retroactive  from the grant for expenditure incurred on eligible works, goods, and \nFinancing   consulting services, procured in accordance with the Procurement \nGuidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Afghanistan \nacknowledges that any concurrence by ADB with the procedures, \ndocumentation,  or  proposal  for  award  does  not  commit  ADB  to \nfinance such expenses.  \n   \nBenefits and  After the Bala Murghab\u2013Leman road is completed, the overall travel \nBeneficiaries  time  between  the  northeast  and  southwest  of  Afghanistan  will \ndecrease by at least 30%. The investment under the ancillary and \nemergency works component will increase average journey speed by \n20  percent  over  the  210-km  Andkhoy\u2013Qaisar  road.    The \nmaintenance component of the Project will increase the service life \nof roads. Taken together, the components will lower transport costs, \nallow people and goods to move faster and less expensively, and \nhelp sustain economic returns and personal mobility. Additionally, as \nthe road will be used to gain faster access to Persian Gulf and \nCaspian Sea ports, the components will also generate regional traffic \nin neighboring states.  \n \nConstruction and maintenance work under the Project will increase \nbusiness opportunities for national contractors and consultants, and \nemployment  opportunities  in  project  areas  during  implementation \nand  operation. The  related  roads  and  off-road  service  areas  will ", "  v\nreduce emissions and energy consumption due to increased speed \nand traffic flow.  \n   \nRisks and  The continuing conflict is damaging newly created road assets and \nAssumptions  impeding  trade  and  travel.  Conflict  may  affect  the  project  cost \nbecause of the limited pool of contractors and consultants willing and \nable to work in Afghanistan. Evidence from ongoing road projects \nsuggests  that  contract  prices  in  the  past  2  years  have  risen \nsubstantially.  However,  the  potential  for  engaging  the  local \ncommunities in the construction and maintenance of roads, and the \nprovision  of  local  trading  facilities,  are  expected  to  generate \ncommunity support for the Project, and this may serve as a deterrent \nto those seeking to cause property damage. Even if not completely \navoided, repair of conflict-induced damage (if not extensive) will be \nless costly and faster under the performance-based maintenance \ncontracts.  \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Civil  Aviation  (MOTCA)  sets \npassenger fares and freight tariffs, and these impede the growth in \nthe  number  of  passenger  and  freight  service-providers  who  can \nbenefit from the reductions in travel time and offer higher frequency \nof service to users. ADB is currently providing technical assistance to \nMOTCA for reforming the regulations, which will lead to the removal \nof  barriers  to  entry  and  operation  in  the  freight  and  passenger \nservice market. \n \n ", "", " \n \n \n ", "", "1 \n \nI.   THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.   I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the Road Network Development Project 1. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.   Performance Indicators and Analysis  \n \n  1.  Infrastructure and Services \n \n2.  Because of the terrain and the pattern of human settlement, road transport is the only \ntechnically and economically feasible mode of transport in many parts of Afghanistan. Until a \nroad development program was initiated under the first 5-Year Development Plan (1956\u20131961), \neven national and international road traffic used one or more of the dirt tracks in the ancient Silk \nRoad and Spice Road corridors. The Soviet Union and United States provided financial aid for \nthis program, which helped build 1,900 kilometers (km) of paved roads, including parts of the \npresent regional road network. Emphasis on roads was retained in the second and third 5-year \ndevelopment plans, and another 600 km of road were added to the regional road network \nbetween 1965 and 1975. By 1980, more than half the country\u2019s population lived within 50 km of \nthe  regional  network.  In  1982  27%  of  development  funds  were  allocated  to  transport  and \ncommunications, and the length of paved roads in the regional road network increased to 2,900 \nkm. However, there were no attempts to develop secondary and tertiary roads to link rural \ncommunities to the paved roads, or to one another. Because of this neglect, interprovincial and \nintraprovincial travel was difficult, and even the famine of 1971 was more serious because food \ncould not quickly be transported to the provinces in need.3  \n \n3.  In  the  two decades since  1980, 70%  of  transport  infrastructure, including the  Ring \nRoad4,  was  damaged  by  the  different  warring  factions,  or  deteriorated  in  the  absence  of \nmaintenance.5 According to the Ministry of Public Works (MPW), even today less than 10% of \nthe country\u2019s 35,000 km of official roads6 are paved and 40% of the roads are unusable during \nwinter months. The Ring Road is the road that links the major cities of Afghanistan, and it \nremains  the  backbone  of  the  national  transportation  system  and  the  principal  conduit  for \nnational and international passenger and freight traffic.  \n \n4.  Since 2002, many primary roads have been rehabilitated and repaired. In addition, \nnearly 1,500 km of the 4,900 km national (secondary) road network, and several thousand \nkilometers of tertiary roads, all with gravel surfaces, have been improved. By June 2007, about \n2,500 km of the original 2,900 km of paved regional road network7 had been reconstructed or \nrehabilitated  to  national  standards  and  paved  with  asphalt  concrete.

Afghanistan:  Present  State  of  Transport  Infrastructure.  Japan: \nInfrastructure Development Institute, 4th Research Department.  \n6   In 2007, this comprised 3,200 km of regional roads, 4,900 km of national roads, 9,700 km of provincial roads, \n17,000 km of rural roads, and about 200 major bridges.  \n7  The regional road network comprises the Afghanistan Ring Road and links from it to neighboring countries except \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China. \n ", "2 \n \nremainder, and construction of approximately 300 km of new roads, are expected to create a \nfully paved all-weather regional road network by the end of 2010.  \n \n5.  Provision of freight transport services, which was handed over in the 1970s to a state-\nowned enterprise with a fleet of almost 14,000 trucks, is now entirely in the hands of private \noperators.  Most  are  owner-operators  offering  informal  services  using  two-  and  three-axle \nvehicles procured or received from the former state enterprise. Also, private operators under \nlicense from the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation (MOTCA) provide all public transport \nservices. About 165 long-distance private bus operators are licensed by MOTCA, and about \n60%  of  these  are  based  in  Kabul.  These  operators  own  about  14,000  vehicles,  mostly \nminibuses and six- and eight-seater vans. With the exception of an informal bus service from \nJalalabad to Peshawar in Pakistan, there are no passenger or freight transport through-services \nto neighboring countries. According to MOTCA, about 45 million passengers travel within the \ncountry each year.  \n \n6.  MOTCA sets separate passenger fares and freight rates chargeable by operators for \nservices on paved roads and gravel roads.8 In addition to an annual vehicle license fee, MOTCA \ncharges each passenger and freight transport vehicle a road usage fee based on the total fares \ncollected by the operator or the value of the consignment carried on each trip.9 Private vehicle \nowners are required to pay an annual license fee and purchase a monthly permit for use of \ncertain key roads. While the annual licenses and monthly permits must be pre-purchased at an \nMOTCA office, road usage fees must be paid to MOTCA officials at the boundaries before \nentering a city or a province. According to MOTCA, revenue in 2006 from the operational fees \nwas $3 million compared to the expected total revenue of $7 million based on traffic counts \nconducted for the road improvement master plan study.10\n \n7.  MOTCA is responsible for planning, designing, operating, and maintaining the 43 official \nairports in the country, four of which meet International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) class \n4 standards.11 According to the Afghanistan Compact,12 Kabul International Airport and Herat \nAirport  will  achieve  full  ICAO  compliance.  Mazar-i-Sharif,  Jalalabad,  and  Kandahar  will  be \nupgraded  with  runway  repairs  and  air  navigation,  fire  and  rescue,  and  communications \nequipment, and another seven domestic airports will be upgraded to facilitate domestic air \nservices.  In  2005  Kabul  airport  served  approximately  500,000  domestic  and  international \npassengers.  \n \n8.  Domestic air services between Kabul and selected major cities are provided by the \nstate-owned carrier, two privately owned Afghan carriers, and UN humanitarian operations. \nFrequency to most cities, with the exception of Kandahar, is less than three times a week. Air \nservices between Kabul and several European and Asian destinations are provided by Afghan \nas well as regional airlines. At present, only Dubai and New Delhi are international destinations \nwith daily flights from Kabul, which carries about 1% of freight and passenger traffic.  \n \n                                                 \n8   Published rates in 2007 are $0.02 per km for passenger services on paved roads and $0.01 per km on unpaved \nroads, and $0.21 per ton per km for freight services on paved roads and about $0.16 per ton per km on unpaved \nroads. \n9   Rates in 2007 are 3% for passenger services and 5% for freight services.  \n10  ADB. 2004.

Railways are limited to two lines: one which connects Toraghondi with Turkmenistan (10 \nkm) and the other connecting Naibabad13 with Uzbekistan (16 km). There are about 1,200 km of \nnavigable waters, mostly on the Amu Darya river, which can accommodate cargo vessels of \nabout 500 deadweight tons. Port infrastructure would need substantial investment before the \nwaterways could become part of the national transportation system.  \n \n10.  The river ports of Hairatan and Shir Khan Bandar reportedly handled about 400,000 tons \nof Afghanistan\u2019s trade with the Soviet Union in 1981 (footnote 3). Shir Khan Bandar is now \nserved by a passenger ferry service (three to four times per day) operated by a nongovernment \norganization (Ahmad Shah Massod Foundation) and a three- to five-times daily cargo service of \npowered barges operated by the Tajikistan government. The cargo ferry carries 4-12 trucks \nhauling scrap metal and gas, and bulk cargo (mostly fertilizer) from Tajikistan to Afghanistan, \namounting to about 20 or 25 truck-equivalent loads. About 25 trucks in each direction and 4-5 \ntrains with an average of 30 wagons cross the border between Uzbekistan and Afghanistan \neach day at Hairatan. The service frequency from Turkmenistan to Toraghondi is once every 2 \ndays and each train consists of about 25 wagons. More details of the transport sector are in \nAppendix 2.  \n \n2.   Road Sector Administration, Planning, and Financing \n \n11.  MPW is charged with planning, design, construction, and maintenance of the entire road \nnetwork. It has a workforce of about 100 engineers and technical staff, and 2,900 laborers \ndistributed among headquarters divisions and six regional offices. Since road construction at \npresent is mainly financed by donor agencies, MPW functions mainly as an administrator of \nprojects. Most construction works, consulting services, and goods for the projects are procured \nthrough competitive bidding according to national and donor procedures. Routine maintenance \nis  performed  by  MPW  using  force-account  (departmental  workforce)  labor  and  equipment \nassigned to its regional offices.  \n \n12.   To  guide  investment,  Afghanistan  has  prepared  a  road  improvement  master  plan \n(footnote 7) outlining investment priorities based on strategic and economic goals of the country. \nThe development partners have accepted the master plan and the national road development \nstrategy is based on it.  \n \n13.  Compared  with  approximately  $40  million  under  the  first  5-Year  Development  Plan \n(1956\u20131961), donors have contributed approximately $2.2 billion between 2002 and 2006 for \nregional and national road rehabilitation and reconstruction. Up to the end of 2006, almost 42% \nof  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  investment  in  Afghanistan  has  been  in  transport  and \ncommunications.  Most of this investment, which at the end of 2006 amounted to $420 million, \nhas  been in  regional and  national  road  rehabilitation  projects  (see  Appendix  3).  The  total \nphysical output of the projects is about 1,000 km of improved regional roads, including 900 km \nof the Ring Road. These projects have substantially increased the mobility level in northern \nAfghanistan. Traffic volumes on recently completed sections of roads have grown at much \nhigher rates than estimated at appraisal.  \n \n14.  Capacity  development  of  road  sector  institutions  has  been  the  mainstay  of  ADB\u2019s \nnonphysical investment in the sector. ADB has provided $7.5 million of technical assistance for \ntraining MPW staff and managing projects. Such support has helped lessen implementation \n                                                 \n13   Transshipment point on south bank of Amu Darya. \n ", "4 \n \ndelays and elevate the level of awareness among agency staff of social and environmental \nsafeguards and international best practices.  \n \nB.   Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n1.   Development Problems  \n \n15.  Capital Resources. Upgrading the Ring Road so it is a continuously paved national \ncorridor by the end of 2008 is the goal for the road sector set at the London conference in \nFebruary 2006. This requires construction of a 193-km road from Bala Murghab to Armalik in \nthe northwestern region (see map). The estimated total cost of constructing this road is $180 \nmillion. Additionally, to avoid consequences similar to that of the road development programs of \nthe 1950s and 1960s, approximately 3,100 km of roads are required to complete the national \nroad network and provide basic rural accessibility. The estimated total cost of that is $1.8 \nbillion.14 About 12,000 km of rural roads and 10,000 km of provincial roads must be improved to \ncomplete the tertiary road network, and this will require a further $1.2 billion and raise total \nfunding requirements to $3 billion. The international community has pledged approximately $1 \nbillion, but it would be difficult, if not impossible, without donor assistance for Afghanistan to \nraise the remaining $2 billion needed to provide a minimum nationwide level of mobility. \n \n16.  Operating  Resources.  MPW  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  recognize  the \nimportance  of  effective  maintenance,  and  they  are  legally  obligated  under  the  lending \nagreements to maintain newly created road assets. However, efforts to implement a sustainable \nmaintenance  program  have  been  largely  unsuccessful  due  to  inadequate  planning, \nprogramming, and funding.  \n \n17.  The total annual cost of maintaining the regional road network is expected to increase \nfrom about $6 million in 2007 to approximately $25 million by 2012. As more national roads are \nimproved and added to the network, the total length of paved roads is expected to exceed 8,000 \nkm by 2016, and the corresponding annual funding requirement for maintenance is expected to \nreach $50 million. The estimated total annual cost of maintaining the entire 34,000 km network \nby that time will reach $130 million. At the 2006 London conference Afghanistan agreed to \nestablish a financially sustainable road maintenance program by the end of 2007. However, \naccording to the road improvement master plan study (footnote 7), the receipts from road usage \nfees in 2005 were about $3 million, or 50% of the total required funding for maintaining the \nregional network. Therefore, without donor assistance, it will be difficult for Afghanistan to fulfill \nthe agreement by the target date.  \n \n18.  Human Resources. In addition to the brain drain of the 1960s, the prolonged closure of \neducational institutions in the 1980s and 1990s has left a vacuum in most public agencies. Even \nsince 2002, MPW has been unable to attract qualified staff or persons to be trained in state-of-\nthe-art road construction and maintenance practices. The primary reason for this is the current \npublic service pay structure. Salaries of MPW engineers range from $60 to $150 per month \nwhile private firms and international agencies offer between $600 and $2000 per month. Other \nemployers also provide more on-the-job training in specialized fields, which potential employees \nconsider  more  useful  than  the  classroom-type  training  offered  under  technical  assistance \nprograms. Consequently, MPW has difficulty executing its functions efficiently.  \n \n                                                 \n14  At 2007 prices. \n   ", "5 \n \n19.   Planning,  Programming,  and  Monitoring.  Although  in  2006  MPW  established  an \ninvestment planning unit within its central Planning Department in Kabul, with the exception of \ngeometric standards for roads, it has no standards for maintenance works or requirements and \nestablished procedures for the planning unit to collect, compile, analyze, and report asset \nperformance to decision makers and stakeholders. Moreover, the responsibility for programming \nrests  with  provincial  governors,  and  for  payments  it  rests  with  MOF.  In  reality  MPW\u2019s \nresponsibility  is  limited  to  designing  capital and  maintenance  projects  based on  proposals \nsubmitted by provincial governors, and helping submit budgets to MOF. International agencies \nhave  overcome  some  constraints  by  engaging  private  consulting  firms  and  individuals  to \nsupervise projects they fund. However, MPW has been slow in reforming its business process \nand implementing an efficient program of investment and maintenance. Reforms have also \nbeen hampered by human and operating resource constraints.  \n \n20.  Governance. Due to the urgency of restoring key components of road infrastructure, \npast stakeholder involvement has been confined to basic consultation with affected persons in \nproject impact areas as required by multilateral banks. MPW has limited formal interaction with \nprovincial  and  local  administrative  bodies.  There  are  no  mechanisms  for  disseminating \ninformation on development plans and priorities or for receiving feedback from road users.  \n \n21.  Accounts  of  internationally  funded  projects  are  maintained  independently  by  the \nrespective  donors  in  partially  computerized  form  and  audited  according  to  national  and \ninternational procedures. However, MPW presently uses manual bookkeeping procedures for \nbudget-financed operations. This approach undermines the accuracy, transparency, and speed \nof transactions.  \n \n22.  Special Circumstances. In 2002, ADB and the international community placed a high \npriority on restoring basic transport services and road infrastructure. Accordingly, based on \nrapid needs assessments and conceptual designs, tenders for works in many cases were called \non a design-build basis. Similarly, contractors and service providers prepared original bids and \nservice inputs based on limited or unreliable information on (i) geology and environment, (ii) \navailability  and  performance  of  local  construction  material,  and  (iii)  socioeconomic \ncharacteristics in the impact areas. The consequent potential for design and schedule variations \nhad not been fully anticipated by all parties at the time of procurement. Unfortunately, internal \nconflict has also continued and global prices for construction materials (particularly bitumen, \ncement, and fuel) have risen. When combined with the scarcity of international and national \nroad builders and consultants with the necessary technical and financial capacity who are willing \nto work in Afghanistan, the conflict and global price rises are creating major financial challenges \nfor MPW, contractors, and consultants. \n \n  2.  Development Opportunities \n \n23.  Regional.  Although  the  capital-resource  constraint  will  limit  the  rate  at  which  road \ndevelopment  can  continue,  Afghanistan\u2019s  commitment  to  adhere  to  the  road  improvement \nmaster plan will help maximize the impact of future investment. For example, the master plan \noutlines  road  investment  priorities  in  relation  to  the  regional  road  corridor  program  linking \nTajikistan and the Kyrgyz Republic to the People\u2019s Republic of China and the national trade \ncorridor program linking the People\u2019s Republic of China with the port of Karachi in Pakistan. \nThese investments will expand the markets for domestic and regional products and improve \nroad access for Afghanistan\u2019s landlocked neighbors to seaports in Pakistan and Iran. As was \nthe case in the late 1960s, this will be an incentive for Afghan producers to increase their \nproduction and for authorities to secure more resources for road development.  \n ", "6 \n \n \n24.  MPW  Reforms  and  Private  Sector  Development.  Several  opportunities  exist  for \neasing the operating-resource constraint. The most effective among them in the short term is \nAfghanistan\u2019s commitment to reform MPW\u2019s operating procedures. These reforms will replace \nthe present reactive force-account maintenance procedure with a scientifically programmed, \nperformance-based  procedure.  This  procedure  will  require,  where  appropriate,  (i)  the \nprocurement of works under performance-based contracts with private road builders, (ii) the use \nof new materials and construction practices, and (iii) the auditing of works and services. The first \nrequirement, while allowing productivity of force-account resources to be increased and risks to \nbe shared with the private road builders, when combined with the second requirement will \nencourage  innovation  and  the  development  of  local  materials.  Moreover,  outsourcing  all \nconstruction  and  maintenance  works  will  help  employees  acquire  special  skills  through \npartnerships with the private sector. The United Nations Office for Project Services is engaging \nnational private contractors almost exclusively on projects it undertakes on behalf of donors, \nand has a list of contractors ranked on the basis of technical and financial capacity. In the next \nfew years these contractors will have the capacity to undertake major road works.  \n \n25.  Donor Support. Axle-load controls facilitated by ADB through equipment and training \nfor MOTCA staff will lessen maintenance requirements. Moreover, ADB, the World Bank, and \nthe United States Agency for International Development (USAID) are expected to provide short-\nterm maintenance budget support to MPW. ADB, under the Project, has allocated $20 million to \nfinance 5-year, performance-based contracts for maintaining the 1,100 km of roads which it has \nhelped improve since 2002. Similarly, USAID has allocated $33 million for maintaining roads it \nhas helped rehabilitate. While ADB-funded maintenance will be procured through international \ncompetitive bidding and supervised by competitively recruited firms, a company created and \nmanaged jointly by MPW staff and international consultants will execute the works financed by \nUSAID. This company will absorb all or part of MPW\u2019s workforce and equipment. Additionally, \nthe European Union is presently financing an experimental performance-based maintenance \ncontract on the Kabul to Jalalabad road, which it helped rehabilitate. The Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation has plans to help MPW better utilize its equipment by strengthening \nequipment maintenance capacity. \n \n26.  Public Service Reforms. The ongoing public service reform process, which has already \nbeen  implemented  in  some  state  agencies,  will  help  MPW  lessen  the  human-resource \nconstraint imposed by salary limits. The reforms also offer a tremendous opportunity to improve \ngovernance  and  reduce  personnel  needs  by  requiring  MPW  to  use  a  computerized \nmanagement  information  system  (MIS)  for  monitoring  and  reporting  financial  and  asset \nperformance to MOF and donors.  \n \n27.  Community Support. The constraints related to security are of the least certain and are \nthe most binding, yet they are not insurmountable with more funds and more involvement of \ncommunities in project impact areas. The planned long-term road maintenance contracts will \nenable at least some of the local communities to be engaged in road building for several years \nafter the major civil works are completed. Moreover, the planned off-road service areas at \nselected locations along the key transit and interprovincial routes will serve as concentrated \ntrading points for local entrepreneurs and will help gather support for the physical components \nof the Project.  \n \n28.  Development  Road  Map.  To  enable  Afghanistan  to  meet  these  conditions  and \nrequirements, ADB, in consultation with MOF and MPW, has prepared an investment program \nand road map to guide capital and maintenance investment and MPW reforms (see Appendix \n   ", "7 \n \n4). The Project is ADB\u2019s first intervention (Project 1) in the planned pipeline of support for the \ninvestment program and  roadmap. \n \n29.  Special Needs. There is an urgent requirement for ancillary and emergency works, \nwhich  include  repairs  and  improvements  to  roads  or  related  infrastructure  due  to  induced \ndamages, damages due to natural causes, and inadequate preliminary designs. The cost of \nthese works is often high and beyond Afghanistan\u2019s financial capacity to undertake. While these \ntypes of works normally would be classified as supplementary works under ADB\u2019s policies, in \nAfghanistan,  a  nontraditional  financing  approach  is  needed  to  meet  urgent  strategic  road \ninfrastructure requirements.  \n \n30.  Additional  works  on  210  km  of  road  from  Andkhoy  to  Qaisar  (presently  under \nconstruction as part of Loan 2140-AFG),15 is one activity which requires urgent financing. The \npreliminary  alignment  of  this  road,  on  which  estimates  of  cost  of  works  were  based  and \ncontractors were awarded, involves changes in elevations of up to 2,200 meters and contains \ngradients as high as 18%. However, according to the national geometric design standards \nestablished in 2006, gradients cannot exceed 8%, and due to the increase in Afghanistan\u2019s \ntrade with neighboring countries, traffic volumes on the road are expected to exceed forecasts \nmade  at  appraisal  in  2004.  Moreover,  during  detailed  surveys  and  designs,  it  has  been \ndetermined that steep grades will severely hamper travel in the winter months due to heavy \nsnow and rain, and research has shown that the rate of heavy vehicle accidents is higher on \nsteeper gradients.16 Therefore, a tremendous opportunity exists to increase the benefits of \nfaster journey times under all weather conditions to domestic and international traffic generated \nby the Regional Road Corridor Project in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, and from the \nconcessions granted at Persian Gulf and Caspian Sea ports for Central Asian exports.  \n \nIII.   THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n31.  The Project will contribute to the growth of Afghanistan\u2019s domestic and international \ntrade. The main outcomes of the Project will be (i) higher levels of mobility and supply of \nintercity, interprovincial, and international transport services; (ii) increased levels of service on \ncritical road sections; and (iii) increased service life of the regional road network.  \n \nB.  Project Components and Outputs \n \n32.  The Project consists of four main components, which are outlined below.  \n \n1.  Construction Component  \n \n33.  The main activity of this component is construction of a new 143-km road between the \ncities of Bala Murghab and Leman.17 This road is part of the only missing link in the Ring \n                                                 \n15  ADB.

Relationship Between Truck Accidents And Highway Geometric Design: A Poisson Regression \nApproach. Transportation Research Record 1376. Washington, DC: Transportation Research Board.  \n17  ADB has financed the improvements to approximately 900 km of the preceding part of the Ring Road between \nPule Khumri and Bala Murghab.  \n ", "8 \n \nRoad.18 It is ranked first among the investment priorities of the road improvement master plan \nand is a key undertaking of the Afghanistan Compact. The road will (i) contain conveniently \nlocated  service  areas  that  will  also  provide  opportunities  for  local  communities  within  the \ncorridor to provide goods and services, (ii) contain all safety and traffic control devices required \non  international  routes,  and  (iii)  be  built  in  accordance  with  national  design  standards \nestablished in 2006 for two-lane regional highways and corresponding regional standards set for \nAsian  highways.  The  preliminary  design  of  the  road  has  been  studied19  and  found  to  be \ntechnically feasible and economically and socially viable.  \n \n2.   Ancillary and Emergency Works Component \n \n34.  The purpose of this component is to allow rapid reconstruction and rehabilitation of \ncritical road infrastructure that have been damaged due to the continuing conflict or designed at \nsuboptimal levels for construction under emergency conditions. It is a cost-effective mechanism \nof providing financing for uncertain and unprogrammed works. This mechanism will permit \nworks to be undertaken on all roads, irrespective of funding source. Although such works on \nADB  projects  would  normally  be  financed  under  ADB\u2019s  policies  and  procedures  for \nsupplementary financing, the urgency and uncertainty of the extent of the works that may be \nrequired calls for this mechanism. To be eligible for financing under this component, the road \ninfrastructure must be: (a) an integral part of a completed or on-going road project financed by \nthe Government, ADB, or other development partners; and/or (b) urgently needed to provide \naccess  to  strategically  important  areas  or  to  increase  traffic  safety  and  national  technical \nstandards. In either case, they must meet all of ADB's environmental and social safeguard \nrequirements. Works initially included under this component will be safety improvements in \nvarious sections of the Andkhoy\u2013Qaisar road, financed from Loan 2140-AFG (footnote 13), by \nreducing the vertical grades from 14% to 8% or less to meet national and regional geometric \ndesign standards for two-lane regional roads. Preliminary works on the Andkhoy\u2013Qaisar road \ncommenced in October 2006. MPW has recently approved the required additional works as \nidentified by the contractor and construction supervision firm, and when finalized it will be \nreviewed  and  approved  by  ADB.  No  social  or  environmental  impacts  that  require  further \nassessments  or  mitigating  measures  are  expected.  Other  works  to  be  included  in  this \ncomponent will be appraised and approved by ADB during implementation of the Project.  \n \n3.   Maintenance Component \n \n35.  A minimum of 3 years of routine and periodic maintenance on at least 1,000 km of the \nregional  road  network  will  be  provided  by  private  contractors  under  performance-based \ncontracts (PBCs).  The PBCs will include provisions for execution of works on an input or unit-\nrate basis, which will allow MPW to respond to emergency needs. Additionally, MPW may award \na contract for maintenance of the Bala Murghab\u2013Leman road at the time of award of the \ncontract for construction works. An indicative list of roads requiring maintenance is given in \nAppendix  5. These  works  are  expected  to  extend  the  service  life  of  the  asphalt  concrete \nsurfacing on the roads to at least 5 years and the pavement life to at least 15 years. Consultants \nunder  TA  4675-AFG  and  TA  4828-AFG20  are  presently  studying  maintenance  standards \n                                                 \n18  The other part is the 50-km road from Leman to Armalik, for which Afghanistan expects to complete with financing \nfrom Saudi Arabia and the Islamic Development Bank.  \n19  ADB. 2006.

Business Process Development Component  \n \n36.  The main objective of this component is to increase the sustainability of investment by \nenabling  MPW  to  execute  its  mandated  functions  more  efficiently.  Activities  under  this \ncomponent will build upon the progress made through previous technical assistance from ADB \nand other donors to MPW for capacity building. Activities will include (i) project support through \nspecialists on maintenance contract administration, bridge and pavement management, right-of-\nway preservation, and environmental management; and (ii) implementation of an MIS. While \nspecialists working with MPW staff will facilitate knowledge and technology transfer, the MIS will \nfacilitate (i) investment planning, programming, and monitoring; (ii) financial management and \ncontrol; and (iii) contractor evaluation and registration. The MIS will be a simple computerized \nsystem for storing and analyzing information on all road assets, including date of construction, \nlocation, physical condition, level of usage, preservation history, and contractor and designer \ndetails. It will be designed, installed, and made operational in stages with the objective of \neventually creating a countrywide system linking MPW\u2019s head office with its regional offices and \nkey line ministries.  \n \nC.  Project Investment Plan  \n \n37.  The estimated total cost of the Project as summarized in Table 1 below is $180 million \nequivalent.

For 2007, Afghanistan is classified as a country with high risk of \ndebt distress and therefore eligible to receive 100% grant assistance.  \n \nE.  Financing Plan  \n \n39.  Afghanistan has requested ADB to help finance part of the implementation cost of the \nroad improvement master plan through a grant in the amount of up to $176 million from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources. The financing plan is in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan  \n($ million) \nSource  Total  % \n     \nAsian Development Bank Grant  176.0  98.0 \nGovernment of Afghanistan    4.0        2.0 \n     \nTotal  180.0     100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF.

MPW will serve as the Executing \nAgency (EA) for the Project with its deputy minister (technical) as the focal person. The deputy \nminister  (technical)  will  be  responsible  for  interministerial  coordination,  as  well  as  overall \nsupervision  of  the  Project  and  individual  projects.  The  project  management  unit  (PMU) \nestablished by MPW to administer ongoing ADB loan and grant projects21 will serve as the \nadministrator of the Project, and be responsible for procurement, including advance contracting \nof works, goods, and services financed from the grant, and obtaining the necessary approvals in \na timely manner from MPW, MOF, and ADB. The PMU will be strengthened with additional staff \nand remain functional for the duration of the Project.  \n \n42.  Project Management Unit Staff.

The project director will prepare, and submit to ADB for review, terms of \nreference for each member of the PMU\u2019s full-time staff, which will be finalized during project \ninception.  These  staff  members  will  be  recruited  by  the  PMU  or  seconded  from  MPW. \nAdditionally, every 3 months, MPW will assign two engineers to the PMU, to be trained by its \nfull-time staff in functions such as project design and management.  \n \n43.  ADB  Monitoring.  ADB\u2019s  project  administration  division  has  developed  a  detailed \ntracking  system  (see  Supplementary  Appendix  A)  for  monitoring  all  preconstruction  and \nconstruction phase activities, which include procurement and disbursement. This system will be \nmaintained jointly by the PMU and the project administration division to enable activities of both \nparties to be synchronized and deviations from planned activities and disbursements to be \nreported to ADB and MPW. Additionally, it will help improve the timeliness and accuracy of \nADB\u2019s consultant recruitment activity monitoring, public information documents, and project \nperformance reports.  \n \n2.  Implementation Schedule  \n \n44.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years with completion expected in December \n2012.  An  indicative  implementation  schedule  is  given  in  Appendix  7.  Activities  during  the \npreconstruction stage (such as social and environmental monitoring, public consultation, the \npreparation of tender documents for design-build and maintenance works, and requests for \nproposals for consultancy services for supervision and business process development) began in \nMay 2007. The construction phase is expected to commence in January 2008. One or more \ncontracts for maintenance of the Bala Murghab\u2013Leman road may be awarded at the end of the \nconstruction contract. A detailed implementation schedule is given in Supplementary Appendix \nB. \n  \n   3.  Procurement of Consulting Services  \n \n45.  Consultant Selection Methods. The continuing conflict in Afghanistan creates unusual \nconditions in which consultants must use unconventional approaches to reach project sites, \nconduct  tests,  supervise  works,  attract  and  retain  qualified  staff,  and  engage  experts  with \nspecial skills. The assignments are therefore likely to be carried out in substantially different \nways  and  consultant's  technical  and  financial  proposals  may  not  be  directly  comparable. \nFurther, in the previous projects, consultants have had difficulty using such methods, mobilizing \nnational  and  international  specialists  on  a  timely  basis,  maintaining  close  supervision  of \nconstruction works, and advising MPW on urgent issues. These weaknesses caused by the \ncountry's  special  security  situation  have  contributed  in  part  to  the  cost  overruns  and \nimplementation delays. Considering that the construction supervision has a high impact on the \ncommunity, environment, and project sustainability and will incur a high cost if it fails, the quality \nof the consulting services is more important than the cost and it is appropriate to select the best \nexperts available. Therefore, the consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time), using the \nquality-based selection (QBS) method as outlined in the procurement plan in Appendix 8. The \nprocurement plan will be updated at least annually covering the next 18 months of procurement \nactivity. MPW will (i) prepare the requests for proposal (RFP) using ADB's standard template;  \n ", "12 \n \n(ii)  prepare  detailed  terms  of  reference,  with  specific  outputs  and  delivery  schedule  for \nattachment to each RFP; and (iii) submit the RFP to ADB for review and approval prior to the \nissuance. \n \n46.  Construction Supervision. Using the QBS method, MPW will engage one international \nconsulting firm for supervision of works on the Bala Murghab\u2013Leman road. The outline terms of \nreference for the supervision consultants are in Supplementary Appendix C.  \n \n47.  Business Process Development. MPW will engage, as and when needed for the \nProject, individual international and national program support consultants to advise and assist it \nin  matters  related  to  implementation.  The  input  needed  from  national  and  international \nconsultants under each service contract will be determined according to the scope of work. It \nmay include, but will not be limited to, assisting MPW with (i) maintenance and construction \ncontract administration; (ii) carrying out technical reviews of the designs, including safeguard \nmeasures; (iii) implementing various phases of the MPW reengineering initiatives; and (iv) \npreparing  reports  for  submission  to  ADB.  The  PMU  will  prepare  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants to be engaged, and submit these to ADB for approval prior to awarding contracts.  \n  \n48.  Using the QBS method MPW will engage an international consulting firm associated with \nnational consulting firms to assist it with the design and implementation of the MIS. Outline \nterms of reference for these consulting services are in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n \n4.  Procurement of Goods and Works \n \n49.  Methods of Procurement. All procurement activities will be undertaken in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  the \nprocurement  plan  is  given  in  Appendix  8.  The  procurement  plan  will  be  updated  at  least \nannually  covering  the  next  18  months  of  procurement  activity.  Equipment  costing  up  to \n$100,000 will be procured using shopping procedures acceptable to ADB. Works financed from \nthe  grant  may  include  (i)  construction,  rehabilitation,  and  repair  of  roads  or  road-related \ninfrastructure;  and  (ii)  performance-based  maintenance,  and  will  be  procured  using  ADB\u2019s \ninternational competitive bidding (ICB) procedures.  \n \n50.  Bidding Documents. ADB\u2019s standard bidding documents will be used for procuring \nworks for construction, rehabilitation, and repair of roads or road-related infrastructure. They \nwill,  to  the  extent  possible,  contain  performance  criteria  and  security  assurances  that  will \nincrease efficiency and the timely completion of works. Bidding documents for maintenance \nworks, which will be a hybrid of input (bills of quantity based) and output (performance-based), \nwill be prepared by MPW and submitted to ADB for approval before calling for tenders. These \ndocuments will follow the World Bank\u2019s documents for performance-based works,22 modified to \nensure  consistency  with  the  Procurement  Guidelines,  and  Afghanistan  Procurement  Law \n(October 2005). Before the commencement of procurement under national competitive bidding \n(NCB) procedures, ADB and the Recipient will review the Recipient's procurement procedures \nto ensure consistency with ADB requirements. Any necessary modifications or clarifications to \nthe Recipient's procedures will be documented in the procurement plan. \n \n51.   Construction Works. Works on the 143-km road from Bala Murghab to Leman will be \nprocured by MPW under three separate design-build contracts using ICB procedures.  \n                                                 \n22  Available: http://www.worldbank.org/html/opr/procure/bdocpage.html \n \n   ", "13 \n \n \n52.  Maintenance Works. Maintenance works on approximately 1,000 km of regional roads, \nincluding the Bala Murghab\u2013Leman road after its completion, will be procured under four or \nmore PBCs using ICB or NCB procedures. In the case of the Bala Murghab\u2013Leman road, \nconstruction  contracts  will  include  performance-based  maintenance  as  an  option  after \ncompletion. This shall not be a commitment on the part of MPW to contract for, or from ADB to \nfund, these activities, and will be subject to agreement between MPW and ADB at the time of \nevaluation of bids. The timing of the award of the maintenance contract for the Bala Murghab\u2013\nLeman road will be determined by the amount of funds available after contracting for the \nconstruction works. \n \n53.  Special Procurement Condition.  The Project is located in an area where countries that \nare not ADB members could provide materials, especially bitumen, fuel, and cement, at highly \ncompetitive prices. Explicit procurement restrictions may preclude civil works and maintenance \ncontractors  from  seeking  the  best  business  terms  from  suppliers  in  these  countries  and \nsubmitting competitive bids. To keep the project costs to a minimum, Management proposes \nthat  works  contractors  financed  from  the  project  be  allowed  to  procure  from  any  country, \nincluding from countries that are not ADB members, bitumen, fuel and cement, strictly for use in \nthe Project. ADB\u2019s Procurement Committees in three previous road development projects in \nAfghanistan  approved  this  special  condition.  ADB  and  MPW,  through  routine  reviews  and \nprocurement audits, will ensure strict adherence by the contractors to this special condition.  \n \n5.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing  \n \n54.  To expedite the bidding process, ADB management has, in principle, approved advance \ncontracting and retroactive financing from the grant for expenditure incurred on eligible works, \ngoods, and consulting services. Advance contracting allows MPW to commence procurement \nactivities, at its own risk, prior to signing of the financing agreement. Afghanistan was informed \nthat, in order for expenses incurred under advance contracting to be eligible for retroactive \nfinancing,  such  procedures  (including  advertising)  must  comply  with  the  Procurement \nGuidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Once the grant becomes effective, up to \n20% of such grant proceeds may be used to retroactively finance eligible expenditures incurred, \npursuant to advance contracting, during the period not exceeding 12 months prior to signing of \nthe financing agreement. Alternatively, the Government may also opt for advance contracting \nwithout  retroactive  financing,  in  which  case  the  procurement  procedures  completed  under \nadvance contracting do not conclude with the award of contract until after the grant becomes \neffective.  Afghanistan  acknowledges  that  any  concurrence  by  ADB  with  the  procedures, \ndocumentation, or proposal for award does not commit ADB to finance such expenses. \n \n6.  Anticorruption Measures  \n \n55.  In accordance with international best practices, MPW and the PMU maintain oversight of \nexternally  funded  projects. The  national  procurement  law  has  several  key  safeguards  and \nclearly  specifies  the  accepted  conduct  of  public  officials  in  matters  of  conflict  of  interest. \nMethods of procurement for externally financed activities, including ADB\u2019s projects, follow the \nrequired procedures and guidelines. Procurement of works and services for budget-financed \nprojects is based on the national procurement law. However, there is no formal record keeping, \nevaluation  of  contractor  and  consultant  performance,  or  conflict-of-interest  disclosure  by \nprocurement  committee  members  and  bidders.  Site  reviews  by  MPW  and  the  PMU  are \ninadequate. As part of its business process improvements, MPW will establish eligibility criteria \nfor persons serving on bid evaluation committees and require disclosure of conflicts of interest. \n ", "14 \n \nAdditionally, MPW will engage private firms to conduct technical audits within 12 months of \ncommencement of civil works and 6 months prior to the handover of a project. A detailed review \nof the financial management and governance procedures of MPW and MOF is provided in \nSupplementary Appendix E.  \n \n56.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  MPW.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant regulations \nand the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of MPW and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other \nservice providers as they relate to the Project. Afghanistan will undertake necessary measures \nto publicly disclose project-related procurement actions such as information on adopted bidding \nprocedures, specifications of goods, works, and consulting services, participating bidders, and \naward of contracts.  \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements  \n \n57.  The grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). In order to pay project management costs and \nto facilitate project implementation, an imprest account with an approved ceiling of $100,000 will \nbe  established  promptly  after  effectiveness  of  the  grant  agreement  at  a  commercial  bank \nacceptable to ADB, and will be managed by MPW. To expedite the flow of funds and to simplify \nthe documentation process, the statement of expenditures procedure will be used for liquidation \nand  replenishment  of  the  imprest  account  and  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  not \nexceeding  $10,000  per  individual  payment.  Payments  in  excess  of  the  statement  of \nexpenditures ceiling will be reimbursed, liquidated, or replenished based on full supporting \ndocumentation. MOF will monitor the imprest account, and review monthly reconciliation of the \naccount.     \n \n  8.  Project Reviews  \n \n58.  In addition to continuous monitoring by the operational division with the aid of the project \nmanagement system, ADB missions, together with MOF and MPW, will perform annual on-site \nreviews of the Project. The reviews will focus on identifying causes and agreeing on measures \nto  correct  negative  deviations  from  targets  for  (i)  physical  completion  of  works,  (ii) \ndisbursements, (iii) reforms, and (iv) financial and procurement audits. A midterm review of all \ncomponents of the Project is scheduled for December 2009.  \n \n9.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting  \n \n59.  The PMU will maintain records and accounts required to identify (i) goods, works, and \nservices procured; (ii) funds received from ADB and MOF; and (iii) expenditures incurred. MPW \nwill select and engage according to procedures, independent external auditors acceptable to \nADB to perform technical annual financial audits, and to provide opinions on the consolidated \nproject accounts. Auditors will be selected and engaged by the quality and cost-based selection \nmethod or the consultant qualifications selection method in accordance with the Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants. The Office of the Auditor General of Afghanistan may also conduct \nannual audits of overall MPW operations and ADB project accounts. Within 3 months of the end \n   ", "15 \n \nof each fiscal year, MPW will submit to ADB the audited project accounts and the auditor\u2019s \nreports, including separate opinion on the use of the imprest accounts and the statement of \nexpenditure procedures. Technical audit reports will be submitted to ADB within 1 month of \ncompletion. \n \n10.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n \n60.  With assistance from the construction supervision consultants, MPW will develop a \nproject performance monitoring system which will contain baseline values of indicators, targets, \nand  milestones  corresponding  to  the  expected  impacts,  outcomes,  outputs,  and  activities \nidentified in the design and monitoring framework, and other relevant measures agreed between \nADB and MPW. \n  \n61.  The supervision consultants, through consultations with local communities and through \nfield observations, will help MPW compile baseline and periodic data on key indicators on \nphysical components of the Project. MPW will compile data on all nonphysical components. \nData will be analyzed every 12 months, and results of the analyses and corrective measures (if \nany) taken will be reported in MPW\u2019s quarterly progress report following the analyses. The \nquarterly progress reports will also include physical progress, disbursements, problems (if any) \nencountered, actions taken, and activities planned for the following quarter.  \n \n62.  MPW will also perform a complete analysis of related primary and secondary data on \nimpacts and outcomes within 1 month of completion of the Project. The results of that analysis \nwill be contained in the Recipient\u2019s project completion report to ADB, which will be submitted \nwithin 3 months of completion of the Project.  \n \n11.  Stakeholder Participation and Consultation  \n63.  As  part  of  project  preparation,  MPW  has  consulted  stakeholders,  including  directly \naffected  people  and  local  administrative  units,  in  the  corridor  between  Bala  Murghab  and \nLeman. Potential resettlement and environmental impacts and benefits have been discussed \nwith these stakeholders and the relevant information has been publicly disclosed through the \nlocal media and ADB\u2019s website. MPW, through regular field visits and the use of specialists, will \nimplement the Project with active participation of all stakeholders, using participatory practices, \nand consultation and disclosure will continue throughout implementation of the Project.  \n \nIV.   PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Economic Benefits \n \n1.  Construction Component \n \n64.  After the Bala Murghab\u2013Leman road is completed, the overall travel time between the \nnortheast and southwest of Afghanistan will be reduced by 3\u20135 hours, allowing people and \ngoods to move faster and less expensively. It will also cause vehicle operating costs to drop \nsubstantially. Traffic on the road, including traffic generated due to the faster access offered \nfrom Central Asia to Persian Gulf and Caspian Sea ports, is expected to grow at 12\u201315% per \nannum.  \n \n ", "16 \n \n65.  The estimated total (discounted) benefits23 of the road over its 15-year service life, \ncomputed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Economic Analysis of Projects (1997),24 is \n$130 million. The distributive analysis of benefits has shown that (i) about 21% of the vehicle \noperating cost savings will accrue to car and light-commercial vehicle operators who provide the \nbulk of passenger services, (ii) about 68% will accrue to freight service operators, and (iii) about \n11% will accrue to bus operators. Of the travel time savings, nearly 83% would accrue to \npassengers and the rest to shippers of goods. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the \nroad is 19% and the net present value (NPV) is $39 million25.  \n66.  The above estimates are based on the assumptions that (i) at least the regional road \nnetwork will be maintained in a good condition, (ii) MOTCA will reform road user charges and \nlicensing  procedures,  (iii)  vehicles  from  all  neighboring  countries  will  be  allowed  to  transit \nthrough Afghanistan, (iv) there will be timely construction of the 50-km Leman\u2013Armalik section \nto complete the Ring Road, and (v) investment in other sectors continues. The sensitivity of the \neconomic viability of the investment to these assumptions was tested computing EIRRs (i) at \nhigher costs, (ii) at lower traffic volumes, and (iii) with both of these conditions. Sensitivity test \nresults shown in Table 3 suggest that EIRR and NPV values remain robust, even in the case of \ntraffic volumes being 50% less than the base case in the initial 5 years as a result of the \nLeman\u2013Armalik road construction being delayed in the absence of timely financing from the \nIslamic Development Bank and Saudi Fund. It is assumed that, regardless of the funding \nsource, the road will be constructed within the 5 years and traffic would increase at the base \nrate in the subsequent 5 years.  \n67.  A probability risk analysis has been carried out to assess the impact on the EIRR of \ncosts  increasing  by  20%  and  traffic  growth26  decreasing  by  20%.  It  has  shown  that  the \nprobability of the EIRR falling below 12% is less than 3%, and there is a 95% probability that the \nEIRR will be greater than 17%. Details of the economic analysis are given in Supplementary \nAppendix F. \n \nTable 3: Sensitivity of Construction Component Benefits \nEIRR  NPV \nSensitivity Test \n(%)  ($ million) \nBase Case  19.0  39.0 \nAlternative Cases     \n(i) Construction and maintenance costs 20% higher than base case   15.0  23.0 \n(ii) Traffic volume 20% less than base case  14.0  13.0 \n(iii) Construction and maintenance costs 10% higher and traffic volume  15.0  17.0 \n10% less than base case \n(v) Traffic volume in first 5 years 50% less than base case  14.0  12.0 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n2.  Ancillary and Emergency Works Component \n \n68.  Initial  works  under  this  component,  which  would  enable  the  Andkhoy\u2013Qaisar  road \n(footnote 13) to be designed in accordance with Afghanistan\u2019s national design standards for \nvertical curves on regional roads, will improve traffic safety and substantially reduce travel time. \nThe benefits of the subproject from reduced travel time would stem from an approximately 8% \nreduction in vehicle operating costs and 12% from reductions in travel time. Regardless of the \n                                                 \n23  About 90% of the benefits result from vehicle operating cost savings and 10% from travel time savings. \n24  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n25 Assuming a 15-year life-cycle of asphalt concrete pavement and a 12% rate of discount. \n26 Assuming construction cost and traffic volume follow uniform distributions.   \n   ", "17 \n \nsource of funds, the estimated NPV of the benefits of this component is $20 million, and EIRR is \n25% over the life of the road. \n \n3.  Maintenance Component \n \n69.  The average service life of an asphalt concrete road is 15 years or more. However, in \nthe absence of routine maintenance, serviceability drops rapidly, causing travel time and vehicle \noperating cost savings to diminish within 3 years. The life of the pavement can drop to 8 years. \nFor  instance,  the  $74  million  NPV  of  the  benefits  and  the  40%  EIRR  of  the  $56  million \ninvestment in the 219-km section from Phule Kumri through Naibabad to Hairatan,27 without any \nmaintenance would drop to an NPV of $1 million and an EIRR of 13%. However, an investment \nof $51 million, or an average of $3.5 million per year ($16,000 per km per year) in maintenance \nwill sustain the benefits over the life of the road. The maintenance component of the Project is, \ntherefore,  aimed  at  helping  Afghanistan  make  timely  maintenance  investments  in  order  to \npreserve approximately 1,000 km of roads created with financing from ADB since 2004.  \n \nB.  Environmental Impacts  \n \n70.  Based on the initial environmental examination (IEE) conducted in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003)28 during preparation, the Project has been \nclassified according to ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) as category B. A summary of the IEE \nof the Bala Murghab to Leman road is provided in Supplementary Appendix G. Given that civil \nworks in the Project will be procured under design-build contract, an environment management \nplan will be prepared during detailed design of the road. The plan will define measures to \nmitigate the minimal short-term environmental impacts expected from related civil works and \nmaintenance. Sufficient funding has been allocated for mitigating potential short-term impacts. \nMPW will monitor implementation of environmental management plans through its own staff and \nsupervision consultants, and report to ADB on a quarterly basis. Potential long-term negative \nenvironmental impacts (including changes in land-use, emission levels, and natural resources \nusage) due to the Project will be addressed during implementation.  \n \nC.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts  \n \n71.  In accordance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), MPW has prepared a \ndraft resettlement plan for the strategically and economically important Bala Murghab\u2013Leman \nroad, and disclosed this to persons that are likely to be affected, some of who have migrated \ninto the area since then due to the continuing conflict in adjacent areas. The resettlement plan \n(summary in Appendix 9) does not fully meet the requirements of ADB\u2019s policy, partially due to \nincomplete data on affected persons, which was difficult to gather due to some security related \nrestrictions in Bala Murghab area.  Moreover, impacts cannot be fully ascertained until the final \nalignment of the road is established. This situation has arisen because construction works on \nthe road have to be procured on a design-build basis to expedite completion. The design-build \nmethod  allows  contractors  to  undertake  unobtrusive  preconstruction  works  while  detailed \ndesigns are prepared. Accordingly, as detailed design progresses, MPW will gather specific \nsocioeconomic data, update the resettlement plan (given in Supplementary Appendix H), and \ntake  all  actions  sequentially  outlined  therein  to  ensure  complete  adherence  to  ADB\u2019s \n                                                 \n27  ADB. 2003.

The updated resettlement plan will \nspecify sections of the road where land acquisition and resettlement are required. ADB will work \nwith MPW to ensure that (i) all compensation is paid before land acquisition and demolition of \nproperty occurs, and (ii) MPW\u2019s contracts with the design and construction firms contain specific \nclauses precluding commencement of physical works in sections with resettlement impacts until \nall key resettlement activities are completed. The supervision consultants\u2019 contracts will contain \nspecific monitoring provisions, including (i) retaining resettlement specialists in the team, (ii) \nensuring that contractors comply fully with the legal and policy requirements, and (iii) that the \ncontractors\u2019  work  programs  are  not  approved  unless  schedules  allow  adequate  time  for \nresettlement activities to be completed. Adequate funds for land acquisition and resettlement \nare defined in the project budget.  \n \nD.  Social and Poverty Impacts  \n \n72.  An assessment of impact of the Project on indigenous peoples has been performed in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). It has been found that the there \nare no indigenous peoples in the project influence zone and that the Project in general will not \nhave an impact on indigenous peoples. The Project is accordingly classified as category C. \n \n73.  A poverty and social analysis of the Project has been conducted in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Handbook on Poverty and Social Analysis (2001).29 It has shown that the road will create \ndirect business and employment opportunities for the local communities in the project influence \nareas. Initially, employment opportunities will be in the road construction industry, which will \nrequire input of approximately 1,100 person-years of unskilled local labor and 675 person-years \nof skilled labor. Based on ongoing road projects, about 80% of the unskilled labor can be \nexpected to be sourced from the local communities. Moreover, with its funds ADB is proposing \nthe award of 3\u20135 year contracts to the private sector for maintaining the completed regional \nroads. These contracts, which are for daily preventative maintenance, will lead to longer-term \nemployment opportunities. There are also off-road service and rest areas planned at strategic \nlocations along the road, which will offer excellent opportunities for local farmers and crafts \npeople for trade and the provision of services such as food sales and vehicle care. MPW will \nengage observers to monitor implementation of the poverty reduction and social strategy, and \nresults will be included in MPW\u2019s quarterly progress reports to ADB. A summary of the poverty \nreduction and social strategy for the Project is in Appendix 10.  \n \nE.  Risks  \n \n74.  There is a risk of the continuing conflict causing project costs to rise because of the \nlimited pool of contractors and consultants willing and able to work in Afghanistan. There is \nevidence from ongoing road projects that contract prices in the past 2 years have risen over \n20%  due  to  (i)  higher  materials  prices,  (ii)  additional  security  required  for  contractor  and \nconsultant  staff  and  equipment,  and  (iii)  work  interruptions.  Additionally,  there  is  a  risk  of \ndamage to physical assets that arises from the continuing conflict, which impedes trade and \ntravel, and in turn economic growth. However, the potential for engaging the local communities \nin construction and maintenance of the roads and the provision of local trading facilities is \nexpected to generate community support for the Project, and this may serve as a deterrent to \nthose seeking to cause property damage. Even if not completely avoided, the repair of conflict-\ninduced damage (if not extensive), will be less costly and faster under the performance-based \nmaintenance contracts.  \n                                                 \n29  ADB. 2001. Handbook on Poverty and Social Analysis. Manila. \n   ", "19 \n \n \n75.  The second risk is the practice of MOTCA setting passenger fares and freight tariffs. \nThis practice impedes growth in the number of passenger and freight service-providers who can \nbenefit from the reductions in travel time and offer higher frequency of service to users. ADB is \ncurrently providing technical assistance to MOTCA for reforming the regulations, which will lead \nto the removal of barriers to entry and operation in the freight and passenger service market and \na lowering of the risk. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n76.  ADB will seek assurances from Afghanistan that, through MPW, it will ensure that: \n \nA.  Environment  \n \n77.  Road and related infrastructure created under the Project are designed, constructed, \nand operated in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, ADB\u2019s Environment Policy \n(2002), and that all steps will be taken to: (i) prepare, during the detailed design of the Bala \nMurghab  to  Leman  road,  and  submit  for  ADB  review  and  approval,  a  comprehensive \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) to minimize any adverse environmental impacts; and \n(ii) monitor implementation of the EMP and report performance in every second quarterly report \nto ADB. \n \nB.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement  \n \n78.  In accordance with applicable laws and regulations, and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement \nPolicy (1995): (i) resettlement plan (RP) agreed with ADB is updated as and when detailed \ntechnical designs are completed, (ii) the final updated RP is disclosed to affected people and \nsubmitted to ADB for review and approval, and (iii) all compensation is paid in a legal and \ntransparent manner before land acquisition and demolition of property occurs. \n \n79.  Physical works in any section of the Bala Murghab to Leman do not commence unless: \n(i) de-mining agency has certified that the construction site in question has been cleared; (ii) RP \nhas been approved by ADB and disclosed to the public; (iii) the compensation program related \nto  that  section  has  been  fully  implemented  in  accordance  with  the  updated  RP;  and  (iv) \nimplementation of the RP is monitored, evaluated, and reported to ADB in PMU\u2019s quarterly \nreports.  \n \nC.

Overview  \n \n1.  The  Afghanistan  transport  sector  comprises  road,  rail,  air,  and  waterway \ntransport services and infrastructure. At the beginning of 2002 more than 70% of the \ntransport  network  had  been  damaged  from  conflict  and  neglect  over  the  past  two \ndecades,  but  infrastructure  is  now  being  reconstructed  and  services  reintroduced \nthrough the joint efforts of the Government, external donors, and the private sector. \nSignificant progress has been made to restore basic road and air transport services but \nlarge areas of the country remain inaccessible and the majority of roads are unpaved \nand in poor condition.  \n \n2.  As determined by the road improvement master plan study undertaken in 2005,30 \nthere  are  approximately  38,500  kilometers  (km)  of  roads  divided  into  3,300  km  of \nregional  highways,31  4,700  km  of  national  highways,  9,700  km  of  provincial  roads, \n17,000 km of rural roads, and 3,800 km of urban roads. Since 2002, almost 2,100 km \n(63%) of regional highways, 650 km (14%) of national highways, and 6,000 km of \nprovincial or rural roads have been reconstructed. Work is underway on (or funding has \nbeen obtained for) the remaining regional highways, except for a 193-km section east of \nheart.32 Funding has been obtained for reconstruction of a further 1,800 km of national \nhighways and 3,000 km of provincial and rural roads, but it will take 10\u201320 years to \nimprove the remainder of the national highway and provincial road network.33  \n \n3.  The Ministry of Public Works (MPW) is responsible for the planning, design, \nconstruction, and maintenance of the regional and national highways and provincial \nroads. It has a workforce of approximately 900 engineers and administrative staff and \n2,000 departmental laborers. It has eight regional maintenance centers, each serving \nfour or more provinces, and a district maintenance office in each of the 34 provinces. \nRoad investment is almost entirely financed by international development agencies with \nvaried procurement and implementation arrangements. MPW has assumed the role of \nadministrator of the investment program.  \n \n4.  The Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation (MOTCA) is responsible for the \nregulation of transport operators and services as well as for providing passenger and \nfreight road transport services with government-owned vehicles. Previous legislation \nauthorized the Government to provide nationwide freight and passenger services, and in \n1990  MOTCA  reportedly  controlled  16,000  trucks,  12,000  buses,  and  extensive \nworkshops. Today MOTCA has approximately 1,180 staff and its current functions in the \nroad transport sector include (i) the regulation of privately owned commercial vehicles; \n(ii)  vehicle  registration,  renewal,  and  inspection;  (iii)  collection  of  the  Transport \n                                                 \n30 Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2004.

Nearly 95% of national and international passenger and freight traffic is road-\nbased. In 2005, vehicle registrations included 207,000 private cars, 55,000 taxis, 42,000 \nbuses,34  110,900  trucks  and  more  than  400,000  motorcycles.  Vehicle  numbers  are \nincreasing rapidly, with annual growth over the past 3 years of 22% for cars, 15% for \ntrucks, 18% for motorcycles, but only 2% for buses. Virtually all vehicles are secondhand \nimports from Japan and Europe.  \n \n6.   MOTCA has registered 165 private bus companies (101 based in Kabul and 64 \nin the provinces) with a fleet of 14,000 buses which operate intercity services on the \nregional and national highways. The remaining buses are 8- to 12-seater vans owned by \nindividuals providing informal passenger transport services in the cities and connections \nbetween rural areas and towns. The only cross-border bus service is between Jalalabad \nand Peshawar (Pakistan). MOTCA reports that 45 million passenger trips were made by \nbus transport in 2005. Fares are estimated to be $0.012 per km for paved roads and \n$0.016 per km for unpaved roads. Operators pay a 3% commission to MOTCA at \nprovincial or national borders and at the outskirts of major towns. \n \n7.  Freight is carried primarily in privately owned trucks. Traffic counts show that the \ncomposition of truck numbers is approximately 20% heavy articulated trucks with the \nremaining 80% divided more or less equally into heavy, medium, and light (or pickup) \nclasses. Freight charges are approximately $0.16 per ton per km on paved roads and \n$0.21 to $0.35 per ton per km on unpaved roads. A 5% commission per trip is charged \nby MOTCA. There are no special transit charges and foreign trucks transporting freight \nthough Afghanistan are charged the 5% commission only. \n \n8.  In addition to its role in road transport, MOTCA operates two international and 22 \ndomestic airports, which meet International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Class 4 \nstandards.35 According to the Interim Afghanistan National Development Strategy36 and \nreiterated in the Afghanistan Compact,37 by the end of 2010 Kabul International Airport \nand  Herat  Airport  will  achieve  full  international  ICAO  compliance;  Mazar-i-Sharif, \nJalalabad  and  Kandahar  will  be  upgraded  with  runway  repairs  and  air  navigation, \nrescue, firefighting, and communications equipment. Another seven domestic airports \nwill be upgraded to facilitate domestic air services. Kabul International Airport handled \napproximately 500,000 international and domestic passengers in 2005.  \n \n9.  Domestic  air  passenger  and  freight  services  are  provided  by  Ariana  Afghan \nAirlines, United Nations Humanitarian Air Services and several private carriers including \nKam Air and Paktek. Frequency between Kabul and most cities, with the exception of \nKandahar, is about three flights per week. International services between Kabul and \nseveral Asian destinations are currently provided by Ariana, Kam Air and international \ncarriers based in Pakistan, India and United Arab Emirates. At present, Dubai and New \nDelhi are the only international destinations with daily services from Kabul. Further \n                                                 \n34 Central Statistics Office.

Rail  services  are  operated  to  railway  yards  a  few  km  inside  Afghanistan  at \nHairatan (by Uzbekistan Railways) and Torghundi (by Turkmenistan Railways). The \nrailway  yards  are  operated  by  the  Ministry  of  Commerce  and  provide  storage  and \nintermodal transfer for freight and petroleum products. Hairatan is served by four or five \ntrains  per  day  with  30  wagons  each,  the  equivalent  of  approximately  157  trucks, \ncompared with transborder road traffic of approximately 33 trucks per day. Traffic at \nTorghundi is two trains per day with 20\u201325 wagons each. The majority of imports is \npetroleum products, humanitarian food-aid and, at Torghundi, scrap metal transshipped \nby truck to Pakistan. There is very little reverse traffic other than some seasonal fruit. \n \n11.  River transport once thrived on the Amu Darya and its tributaries.38 Today, an \ninternational ferry at Sirkhan Bandar is the only marine transport service operating, \nexcept  for  informal  ferries  across  many  rivers.  An  Afghan  foundation  operates  a \npassenger ferry three to four times daily. The Tajikistan Government operates a barge \nwith a capacity of 4\u20135 trucks a few times per day depending on traffic. The United States \nAgency for International Development (USAID) is funding a road bridge across the \nPyanzh River closer to Sirkhan Bandar, and this will be completed in 2007. The traffic \npotential through this border crossing is significant and plans are being made for full \nborder facilities. \n \n12.  Afghanistan currently has eight formal border points.39 The roads connecting \nthese with the regional highway network are now being rehabilitated. They will in future \nconnect major cities in Afghanistan and its neighbors and serve transit traffic through \nAfghanistan. Already there is significant traffic as measured by the average daily number \nof trucks crossing at border points, for example:40 Torkham 1,100, Spin Boldak 385, \nIslam Qala 420, Torghundi and Aquino 100 each, and Hairatan 250 vehicles in both \ndirections.  Investment  in  facilities  for  customs,  health  and  immigration  processing, \nvehicle inspection, and weigh scales is planned under ongoing ADB loans. \n \nB.  Road Subsector  \n \n13.  In the Interim Afghanistan National Development Strategy (2007), and reiterated \nat the London Conference in 2006, the Government committed to upgrading the Ring \nRoad  and  the  main  link  roads  with  neighboring  countries  by  the  end  of  2008  and \nestablishing a financially sustainable system for road maintenance by the end of 2007. \nThe current situation is that 86% of the regional highway network is scheduled for \ncompletion by the end of 2008 and the remainder will completed by the end of 2009 or in \n2010.  \n  \n14.  About 70% of the road network in Afghanistan remains in poor-to-bad condition \nwith many roads impassable by motor vehicles. Areas in the mountainous central part of \nthe country do not have all-weather access to the main road network.

MPW  has  established  priorities  for  reconstructing  the \nremaining national highways which are in accordance with the priorities recommended in \nthe  road  improvement  master  plan.  These  priorities  are  described  further  in \nSupplementary Appendix C.  \n \n15.  The 17,000 km of rural roads are the responsibility of the Ministry of Rural \nRehabilitation  and  Development  (MRRD).  MRRD  has  received  assistance  from  a \nnumber of donors and has improved 6,000 km of road, though much of the work was in \nthe  form  of  temporary  repairs  under  emergency  employment  schemes.  MRRD  has \nestablished a planning process and has commenced preparing rural road improvement \nplans and programs on a district-by-district basis. In contrast, MPW has not carried \nforward the provincial road priorities recommended by the road improvement master \nplan and has not established a development program for the provincial roads.  \n \nC.  Constraints \n \n16.  MPW\u2019s focus has been on project implementation and its most skilled engineers \nhave been seconded to work on donor-funded projects. Strategic planning, budgeting \nand programming, road network condition monitoring, maintenance management, road \nsafety,  and  enforcement  of  traffic  and  vehicle  regulations,  have  been  neglected. \nTechnical assistance to build capacity is being provided by several donors including \nADB41 but further capacity building is needed in key areas.   \n \n17.  MPW\u2019s annual budget for road maintenance works (excluding employee salaries) \nin the past 3 years has varied between $4 million and $8 million, compared with an \nestimated minimum requirement of $15 million for the present network. This figure will \nincrease to approximately $70 million per year in the next 5\u201310 years when periodic \nmaintenance of improved roads will become a major requirement. \n  \n18.  MPW\u2019s  capacity  to  undertake  road  maintenance  is  limited  by  (i)  a  lack  of \ntransport,  equipment,  and  tools  to  carry  out  the  work;  (ii)  the  absence  of  a  road \nmaintenance management system to assess needs, estimate costs, program works, \nmonitor progress, and report results; and (iii) the absence of a contract administration \nsystem  for  efficient  procurement,  quality  management,  measurement,  and  payment. \nMPW has purchased some new equipment and the Japan International Cooperation \nAgency is funding the rehabilitation of the machinery repair centre in Kabul and providing \ntraining in equipment operation and maintenance. Apart from this assistance, there is a \nconsensus among the external donors that MPW should adopt contracting with private \ncontractors and community groups as the principal method for delivering maintenance \nand limit its role to managing maintenance and providing an emergency maintenance \ncapacity at most. The European Union has implemented a pilot contract maintenance \nproject  on  the  improved  Surobi\u2013Jalalabad  road.  The  World  Bank  is  funding  pilot \nmaintenance projects on rural roads using community-based labor groups. USAID is \npreparing a technical assistance project to build a contract maintenance capacity in \n                                                 \n41 ADB. 2005.Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the Capacity Building for Road \nSector Institutions.

Coordination \nof donor programs will be essential to ensure consistency in policy and implementation \nand to avoid conflict and duplication. \n \n19.  Regardless  of  maintenance  modality,  the  capacity  of  MPW  to  manage  road \nmaintenance needs to be strengthened through: \n \n(i)  the establishment of a road maintenance management system comprising  \n(a)  a road database of inventory, road condition, and traffic levels;  \n(b)  maintenance activities and level-of-service standards;  \n(c)  an estimation procedure for labor, materials, and equipment;  \n(d)  a programming system;  \n(e)  inspection and measurement procedures; and \n(f)  a reporting system. \n(ii)  standard  contract  documents  and  specifications  for  different  levels  of \nroutine maintenance;  \n(iii)  a register of contractors and technical resources available in each region;  \n(iv)  refurbishment of MPW provincial field offices with power, communications, \nand basic computer capacity;  \n(v)  provision of transport for MPW field engineers; and \n(vi)  provision of basic equipment for force-account routine and emergency \nmaintenance  of  unpaved  roads  in  regions  and  districts  where  private \ncontractor resources are not available. \n \n20.  International contractors, principally from India, Iran, Pakistan, People\u2019s Republic \nof China, Republic of Korea, and Turkey, have been employed for the major highway \nprojects. Domestic contractors have obtained subcontract work and are being employed \ndirectly in rural road construction funded by USAID and the World Bank. The United \nNations Office for Project Services has a register of 23 qualified domestic contractors \nwhich it employs regularly. There is a need to expand the domestic industry\u2019s capacity \nfor maintenance work and for small- and medium-sized road and bridge construction \nprojects which are expected to form a major source of work after the large road projects \nare completed. The outlook is promising but further support for the domestic industry is \nneeded in the form of (i) availability of contracts, (ii) transparent procurement processes, \n(iii)  reasonable  technical  and  financial  qualification  requirements,  (iv)  practical  and \nachievable technical specifications for works, and (v) on-time payment for completed \nwork.  \n \n21.  There is a shortage of qualified engineers and technicians for road and structural \ndesign  and  construction  supervision,  and  this  is  being  filled  by  extensive  use  of \ninternational consulting companies and contract staff. This is a temporary condition \ncreated by the aftermath of conflict and the rapid build-up of road construction work. In \nthe longer term, the Government and private sector will require a corps of domestic \nengineers  and  technicians  supplied  by  the  country\u2019s  educational  system.  The \nengineering  universities  and  technical  colleges  need  to  be  strengthened  and \nprofessional qualifications need to be raised.  \n \n22.

Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing  \n \n6.  To expedite the bidding process, ADB management has, in principle, approved advance \ncontracting and retroactive financing from the grant for expenditure incurred on eligible works, \ngoods, and consulting services. Advance contracting allows MPW to commence procurement \nactivities, at its own risk, prior to signing of the financing agreement. Afghanistan was informed \nthat, in order for expenses incurred under advance contracting to be eligible for retroactive \nfinancing,  such  procedures  (including  advertising)  must  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Once the grant become effective, up to 20% of such \ngrant proceeds may be used to retroactively finance eligible expenditures incurred, pursuant to \n ", "  Appendix 8  41 \n \nadvance contracting, during the period not exceeding 12 months prior to signing of the financing \nagreement.  Alternatively,  the  Government  may  also  opt  for  advance  contracting  without \nretroactive financing, in which case, the procurement procedures completed under advance \ncontracting do not conclude with the award of contract until after the grant becomes effective. \nAfghanistan acknowledges that any concurrence by ADB with the procedures, documentation, \nor proposal for award does not commit ADB to finance such expenses. \n \n ", "42  Appendix 9   \n \nSUMMARY OF RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n \n1.  The Road Network Development Project 1 comprises four components: (i) construction, \n(ii) ancillary and emergency works, (iii) maintenance, and (iv) business process development. \nThe main output of the first component is a 143-km two-lane road from Bala Murghab to Leman, \nwhich is one of the two critical missing links of the Ring Road. Traffic between Bala Murghab \nand  Leman  presently  uses  several  dirt  tracks,  some  of  which  pass  through  three  local \ncommunities.  \n \n2.  For reasons of expediency and urgency to meet Afghanistan Compact1 targets, the \nMinistry of Public Works (MPW) will procure civil works on the Bala Murghab\u2013Leman road \nthrough  three  simultaneous  design-build  contracts.  Accordingly,  the  final  and  most \neconomically, socially, and environmentally viable alignment will be determined by MPW (the \nExecuting Agency of the Project) after detailed field surveys are completed by the contractors. \nUntil the alignment is finalized, the exact extent of the impact of the road on people, land, and \nbuilt structures cannot be determined. Consequently, a full resettlement plan, which fulfils all \nrequirements of ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995), could not be prepared.  \n \n3.  Under the circumstances, to enable civil works contracts to be awarded so that detailed \ndesigns could be completed and a resettlement plan prepared, MPW has prepared this draft \nresettlement plan for the Bala Murghab\u2013Leman road section. It served as the basis for project \nappraisal  and  determination  of  the  conditions  for  commencing  construction.  The  draft \nresettlement plan is based on the initial surveys performed under TA 4875-AFG, and is in \naccordance  with  the  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  as  well  as  the  domestic  policy \ninstruments and laws, particularly the provisions made under the Law on Land Acquisition in the \nconstitution of Afghanistan. It reports the likely impact on people, land, and structures if the road \nfollows the dirt track, which is presently the most frequently used route.  \n \n4.  The draft resettlement plan has been prepared in due consultation with those who have \na high likelihood of being categorized as affected families and affected persons if the alignment \nfollows the present track. It is intended to be a guide for MPW staff, construction supervision \nconsultants,  and  civil  works  contractors  on  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  procedures, \nincluding the payment of adequate and timely compensation for individuals or groups that may \nbe affected by the construction.   \n \n5.  Initial  field  surveys  and  extensive  consultation  were  curtailed  by  the  security \nrequirements  of  the  United  Nations  and  the  absence  of  many  residents  who  had  been \ntemporarily  displaced.  However,  numbers  were  sufficient  to  estimate  that  36  households \n(approximately 270 persons) are likely to be affected. They revealed that 8 hectares (ha) of \nagricultural and 2 ha of residential-cum-commercial land in the zone of influence are to be \naffected if the present most commonly used alignment is maintained for the road. No indigenous \npeople were found in the zone of influence.  \n \n6.  The compensation and rehabilitation principles followed in the draft resettlement plan are \nthat (i) land acquisition will be avoided or at least minimized, (ii) compensation will ensure the \nmaintenance of affected persons\u2019 preproject living standards, (iii) affected persons will be fully \ninformed and consulted on compensation options, (iv) the sociocultural institutions of affected \npersons will be supported and used, (v) land acquisition provisions will equally apply to women \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2006.

Based on these principles, a broader entitlement matrix has \nbeen prepared.  \n \n7.  The updated and final version of the resettlement plan will be disclosed to the affected \npeople. Disclosure of the draft resettlement plan and all revised versions will be through ADB\u2019s \nwebsite  (English  versions),  Dari  versions  in  local  MPW  offices,  and  consultation  with \nstakeholders.  Consultations  and  discussions  with  the  project-affected  people  will  be  a \ncontinuing activity throughout the implementation of the Project. \n \n8.  As detailed design progresses, MPW with assistance from project support consultants \nrecruited for the Project Management Unit (PMU), construction supervision consultants, and a \nspecifically recruited nongovernment organization will update the draft resettlement plan and \nsubmit the full resettlement plan to ADB. It will take all actions sequentially to ensure complete \nadherence to ADB\u2019s resettlement policy and national safeguard requirements. ADB will ensure \nthat MPW\u2019s contracts with the design and construction firms contain specific clauses precluding \ncommencement  of  physical  works  in  sections  with  resettlement  impacts  until  all  key \nresettlement activities are completed.  \n \n9.  Pre-resettlement implementation activities will mostly be carried out and finished during \nthe detailed design, and subsequently upon the finalization of the detailed engineering design. \nDuring implementation stage, MPW will coordinate with the district governments for the orderly \ntransfer  of  affected  persons  (if  required)  after  they  have  received  their  compensation  and \nentitlements. Prior to relocation, the resettlement specialists will assist the affected persons to \nmake a list of their personal belongings and check them after they have been relocated. Several \nactivities are also envisaged by MPW following the completion of resettlement of affected \npersons. Monitoring of resettlement activities and compliance with the project policies by MPW \nare also major aspects of this phase. All activities related to land acquisition and resettlement \nwill be planned to ensure that compensation is paid prior to displacement and commencement \nof  civil  works.  The  following  major  steps  have  been  outlined  sequentially  to  ensure  that \nrequirements at each stage are met. \n \n(i)  Finalization and update of the draft resettlement plan for each section of the road \nafter detailed design and before commencement of civil works for the section. \n(ii)  Implementation  before  demolition  and  commencement  of  civil  works  for  the \nsection.  \n(iii)  Monitoring.   \n(iv)  If  the  need  arises,  implementation  of  measures  to  address  outstanding \nresettlement issues before finalization of the Project.  \n \n10.  Any grievance by the affected people will be addressed in a proper manner by the PMU \nand MPW through the help of the nongovernment-organization project supervision consultant\u2019s \nresettlement specialist. MPW will pay for all the costs of the compensation and rehabilitation \nprogram  for  the  impacts  caused  by  the  Project.  The  resettlement  cost  estimate  for  this \nsubproject  includes  eligible  compensation,  resettlement  assistance,  and  support  cost  for \nimplementation of the resettlement plan. The total estimated resettlement cost for this project is \nAF33.30 million ($0.7 million). This is subject to change based on the detailed design survey. \nInternal monitoring will be the responsibility of the PMU, the resettlement team in the PMU, and \n ", "44  Appendix 9   \n \nthe supervision consultant.

Agriculture and other rural-based activities are the \nmainstay of the Afghan economy, and the proposed Project will contribute to poverty reduction by providing \naccess to urban markets for agricultural products. The Project will also improve rural peoples\u2019 access to \neducation and health facilities. \n \nB. Poverty Analysis                                    Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nAfghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world.1  Poverty, caused by years of war, is pervasive. \nThe legacy of poverty, violence, and war is that the majority of Afghans are Socially and politically \ninsecure.  Approximately 53% of the population is classified as poor and lives on less than $1 a day.2 The \naverage  life expectancy at  birth  is  43  years  (20  years  lower  than  in  neighboring Tajikistan), child \nmalnutrition is 49%, access to an improved water source is 13%, access to improved sanitation facilities is \n12%, the fertility rate is 6.8 live-births per woman, and malnourishment is at 70%. Afghanistan\u2019s economy \ncontinues to be overwhelmingly agricultural, despite the fact that only 12% of its total land area is arable, \nand less than 6% is currently cultivated.3 Agricultural production is constrained by an almost total \ndependence on erratic winter snows and spring rains for water; irrigation is primitive. Relatively little use is \nmade  of  machines,  chemical  fertilizers,  or  pesticides.  Overall  agricultural  production  has  declined \ndramatically  following  severe  drought  as  well  as  sustained  fighting,  instability  in  rural  areas,  and \ndeteriorated infrastructure. A study based primarily on the Nationwide Risk and Vulnerability Assessment \nSample Survey 2005, along with public consultations, was undertaken to gather qualitative information on \nthe social and poverty scenario for the influence areas of the Project. \n \nC. Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?                 X Yes         X No \n \nIn order to ensure the extensive participation of all types of stakeholders during project preparation, \ndiscussions were held with citizens, poor people, affected persons, and other beneficiaries, local bodies, \nand government departments through consultative workshops, meetings, focus-group discussions, and \nstructured interviews. The Executing Agency (EA) undertook consultations with local officials, villagers, \nand other stakeholders that raised the level of awareness, built local support, and enabled affected \npeople to voice opinions and suggestions for project design and implementation. Household census \nsurveys were conducted where security threats were low. Participation, consultation, and information \ndissemination was incorporated at several levels during planning of the Project. To ensure that community \nsupport is obtained and that the Project supports the felt needs of the people, public consultations were \ncarried out as an integral component of project preparation.   \n                                                 \n1 Afghanistan is ranked close to the bottom of the United Nation\u2019s Human Development Index along with African \ncountries  such  as  Burkina  Faso,  Burundi,  Mali,  Niger,  and  Sierra  Leone.

X Yes         X No \n \nPublic participation is the key element of the project design during the whole process of planning, \nimplementation, operation, and maintenance. The proposed broad-based participatory strategy for public \nparticipation  focuses  on  partnership  between  poor  communities,  community-based  organizations, \nnongovernment organizations, local administrative bodies, and the Government. Extensive consultations \nwere undertaken to ensure stakeholder participation in project design. \n \nA number of elements in the Project also seek to make the road network development process more \nparticipatory and needs-based. These include provisions to strengthen field offices of the Government so \nthat they are more responsive to the felt needs at the local level. Despite logistical and communications \nconstraints, the Government is committed to participatory processes. \n \nD. Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women:  \n \nData has been analyzed to assess the status of women in cities in the project\u2019s zone of influence. This \nshows gender differences in literacy, employment status, and workload in the family due to absence of \nbasic civic amenities. The strategy of participation emphasizes women\u2019s participation, which is expected \nto maximize the benefits of women. \n \nMonitoring and evaluation systems will consider gender disaggregated information for the assessment of \nthe impact of the Project on women. The strategy for women\u2019s participation ensures that women and men \nbenefit equally from the Project. Interventions will be introduced to avoid gender bias. Project benefits will \nbe ensured for women through gender mainstreaming and a gender responsive participation framework. \nMonitoring and evaluation systems will generate gender-disaggregated data to enable assessment of \ngender implications and impact of the Project. \nHas an output been prepared?
