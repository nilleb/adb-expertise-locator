The  Asian\nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  has  provided  assistance  since  the  mid-1980s  to  the  technical  and\nvocational education and training (TVET) sector in, for example, establishing the Royal Institute\nof Management2 and expanding the Royal Bhutan Polytechnic to improve the quality of training\nand  double  the  intake  capacity.3  Following  ADB-initiated  policy  dialogue  in  the  1990s,  the\nGovernment  embarked  on  reform  of  the  TVET  sector  to  meet  the  needs  of  an  economy  in\ntransition  to  a  modern,  private-sector-led  market  economy,  and  established  the  National\nTechnical  Training  Authority  (NTTA)  in  1999,  as  recommended  in  ADB  technical  assistance.4\nDuring  the  initial  operation  of  NTTA,  the  Government  recognized  the  urgent  need  for\nemployment-oriented skills training at the basic level and requested ADB financial assistance to\nprepare  the  Basic  Skills  Development  Project.  The  project  preparatory  technical  assistance\n(PPTA) was approved in December 1999 and implemented between June and December 2000.\nThe Fact-Finding Mission from 8 to 19 January 2001 and the Appraisal Mission5 from 15 March\nto  2  April  2001  visited  Bhutan  to  formulate  the  Project  on  the  basis  of  consultations  on  the\nproject  feasibility  report  with  NTTA  and  other  Government  agencies,  representatives  of  the\nbeneficiaries (parents, students, and future employers), nongovernment organizations (NGOs),\nand international aid agencies, as well as extensive site visits by staff during the PPTA review.\nThe project framework is in Appendix 1.\n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA. \n\nSector Description\n\n1. \n\nEducation System6\n\nThe  formal  education  system  (Appendix  2)  comprises  one  year  preprimary  school,  six\n3. \nyears primary school (grades 1-6) including community school (preprimary and grades 1-6), two\nyears junior high school (grades 7 and 8), two years high school (grades 9 and 10), two years\n\n                  \n\n1  Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ).\n2  TA 564-BHU: Royal Institute of Management, for $45,000, approved on 7 December 1983 and Loan 722-BHU(SF):\n\nSecond Multiproject Loan, for $7.4 million, approved on 13 December 1984.\n\n(cid:1)(cid:2) Loan 1035-BHU(SF): Technical and Vocational Education and Training Project, for $7.13 million, approved on 27\n\nSeptember 1990.\n\n4  TA  1381-BHU:  Institutional  Improvements  in  Technical  and  Vocational  Education  and  Training  Project,  for\n\n$750,000, approved on 27 September 1990.\n\n5  The  Mission  comprised  Y.

English  is  the  medium  of\ninstruction.\n\nIn the 1950s, fewer than 450 children attended secular primary schools, and there were\n4. \nno  secondary  schools.  In  1961,  the  First  Five-Year  Plan  (1FYP)  initiated  a  comprehensive\neducation  system  for  the  country.  Since  then,  enrollments  at  all  levels  have  grown  at  an\nimpressive  rate  as  a  result  of  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  develop  the  education  sector.\nBetween  1984  and  1996,  the  adult  literacy  rate  increased  from  28  percent  to  54  percent,  and\nthe primary school gross enrollment rate (grades 1-6) rose from only 12 percent in 1980 to 72\npercent in 1996. The Government is targeting a 95 percent enrollment rate in primary schools\nunder the 8FYP (1997-2002), and full enrollment at junior high school (grade 8) by 2007, at the\nend of the 9FYP. In 1999, over 107,000 students were enrolled in the general education system\nconsisting  of  254  primary  and  community  schools,  51  junior  high  schools,  21  high  schools,  7\nprivate schools, and 10 other institutions providing specialized education as well as tertiary and\nvocational  training.  Since  1997,  the  number  of  teachers  has  trebled  and  the  number  of\neducational  establishments  has  doubled.  Throughout  this  development,  the  education  sector\nhas aimed to improve the gender balance. Currently, the ratios in favor of boys are about 55:45\nin  primary  schools,  53:47  in  junior  high  schools,  57:43  in  high  schools,  and  52:48  in  private\nschools.7 In 1996, the female primary school enrollment rate was about 60 percent.\n\nThe  Department  of  Education  (DOE)  of  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Education  (MOHE),\n5. \nadministers Bhutan\u2019s current general educational system. While DOE directly administers higher\neducation,  direct  financial  and  administrative  responsibility  for  primary  and  secondary  schools\nhas been devolved to the dzongkhag (district) administrations. Formal schooling begins at the\nage of six and is offered free of charge up to the tertiary level (except in seven private schools).\nIn the public schools system, the Government provides textbooks and, in some places, boarding\nfacilities and meals. Rural primary and junior high school students also receive free stationery.\nCommunities  in  rural  areas  contribute  labor  for  building  and  maintaining  their  schools.\nNotwithstanding the contribution by individuals/families, the Government bears over 90 percent\nof the recurrent costs of all schools, and 80 percent of the capital costs of primary schools and\n100 percent of secondary schools.8\n\nDue  to  the  increasing  need  to  meet  the  critical  shortage  of  secondary  school  facilities\n6. \nand  competent  teachers  as  a  result  of  the  almost  full  primary  school  enrollment  by  2002,  the\nGovernment  recognizes  that  it  cannot  continue  to  support  a  free  education  system  for  all.\nConsequently,  the  establishment  of  private  schools  is  being  encouraged  as  more  families  are\nable to afford the cost of educating their children. The Government is aware that development of\nprivate schools should not lead to a decline in the quality of public schools. The introduction of\nmore  cost  sharing  by  beneficiaries  in  addition  to  the  conventional  community  contribution,\nparticularly  at  the  post  junior  high  school  levels,  will  show  the  direction  to  cost  recovery\nmeasures  for  a  new  TVET  system.  The  much  higher  cost  per  capita  of  TVET,  compared  with\nthat of general education, indicates the importance of developing a cost recovery mechanism for\nvarious  training  activities.  Upon  completion  of  junior  high  school,  students,  depending  on  their\nperformance,  can  proceed  to  high  school  or  to  a  skills  training  institute  such  as  the  Royal\nTechnical  Institute,  which  offers  three  to  four  years  training.  Subject  to  their  academic\nperformance, high school graduates can choose the Royal Bhutan Polytechnic, a junior college,\na teacher training college, or other higher education institutes.\n\n                  \n\n7  STS: BHU 2000-02: Country Operational Strategy, Bhutan, October 2000, para. 37.\n8  Annual Statistical Report, 1999. Education in Bhutan, p. 38.\n\n\f3\n\n2. \n\nTechnical and Vocational Education and Training System\n\nThe  Government  established  NTTA  in  May  1999  to  coordinate  the  national  TVET\n7. \nsystem.  The  objectives  of  NTTA  are  to  effectively  respond  to  the  acute  need  to  create  an\nemployable  indigenous  labor  force,  and  to  reform  the  TVET  sector  to  create  a  private-sector-\noriented  TVET  system  in  Bhutan.  To  complement  the  reform  of  the  TVET  sector,  the\nGovernment  also  established  the  National  Employment  Board  (NEB)  in  March  2000  with  the\nmandate  of  regulating  and  administering  the  labor  market.  The  mandate  includes  preparing\nlabor  legislation,  providing  employment  services,  supervising  labor  relations  and  doing  labor\nmarket research.\n\nBefore  the  establishment  of  NTTA,  the  Technical  and  Vocational  Education  Section\n8. \nunder DOE coordinated the training programs. The relatively large capacity of the public sector\nto absorb all employment in the past\u2014which partly explains the current aspirations of educated\nyouth  to  become  civil  servants,  and  the  underdevelopment  of  the  private  sector-served  the\npurpose of the conventional TVET system to prepare students for a career in the public sector\nagencies.  Consequently,  the  Royal  Civil  Service  Commission  (RCSC)  administered  job\nplacements for the public sector agencies, but there was no agency to facilitate private sector\nemployment. There was also no central agency to coordinate a national TVET system, involving\nthe  formulation  and  planning  of  a  skills  development  policy,  skills  standardization,  testing  and\ncertification,  and  training  program  accreditation.  Despite  the  Government  commitment  to\ndevelop the private sector, lack of these capabilities constrains the promotion of private training\ninstitutes in the TVET sector or in-house staff development programs run by individual private\nenterprises.\n\nNTTA,  in  collaboration  with  NEB  and  other  ministries  concerned,  is  mandated  to\n9. \nestablish  an  employment-oriented  TVET  system.  NTTA  needs \nformulate  skills\ndevelopment and utilization policies and frameworks; (ii) replace outdated training programs that\nhave  little  relevance  to  the  emerging  labor  market  needs;  (iii)  improve  access  to  training\nprograms,  particularly  for  women  and  the  poor  in  rural  areas;  and  (iv)  provide  access  to  skills\ntesting/certification for workers who wish to certify their skills attainment. There is also an urgent\nneed to coordinate and strengthen the employment counseling services for school graduates or\njob  placement  services,  which  are  currently  handled  by  MOHE  as  well  as  by  NEB  and  are\nrelatively  weak  compared  with  similar  services  provided  by  the  RCSC  for  public  sector\nemployment.\n\nto  (i) \n\nThe  institutional  capacity  of  NTTA  and  NEB  is  still  inadequate  to  properly  follow  the\n10. \nabove mandates and better serve their priority clientele, comprising school graduates (grade 8\nand  above),  existing  workers,  and  private  sector  employers  who  will  pay  for  the  trained\nBhutanese youth under the new TVET system. An institutional diagnostic analysis made by the\nPPTA9  indicated  the  (i)  lack  of  coherent  TVET  policies  and  associated  employment  policies,\nqualified  staff,  skills,  and  management  system  to  develop  and  administer  the  employment-\noriented skills training system, and mechanisms to maintain linkages with the private sector and\nto deliver the training programs through various modalities; (ii) outdated and insufficient facilities\nin  the  existing  training  institutes;  (iii)  weak  interministerial  coordination  to  institutionalize  the\nTVET system as part of the national human resource development framework; and (iv) lack of\n\n                  \n\n9  TA3464-BHU: Basic Skills Development Project, Final Report, December 2000, Appendix 14 and 15 (Institutional\nDiagnostic Analysis of the National Technical Training Authority and its TVET Institutions, July-August  2000,  and\nTraining Needs Assessment, July-August 2000).\n\n\f4\n\ncapital necessary to develop new training programs and facilities. Moreover, in the case of NEB,\nthere is a need to develop a legal framework to support its mandate.\n\nNTTA  inherited  five  skills  training  institutes,  including  (i)  the  Royal  Technical  Institute\n11. \n(RTI),10  which  has  been  training  young  people  since  1986  to  be  skilled  tradesmen  and  trades\nsupervisors,  most  of  whom  worked  for  the  Government  services.  Almost  all  training  was  for\nformal four-year certificate level; skilled trades courses (comprising 60 percent practical and 40\npercent  theoretical  training)  in  electrical,  mechanical,  and  automotive  engineering,  building\nconstruction,  and  drafting;  entry  level  was  normally  after  graduating  from  junior  high  school  at\ngrade 8; (ii) the Royal Bhutan Polytechnic (RBP), which has provided, since 1974, a three-year\ndiploma course for students graduating from high school at grade 10; (iii) the National Drivers\nTraining Institute (NDTI), which has provided, since 1989, a one-year program in vehicle driving\nand basic maintenance; most of the trainees obtained employment with government agencies;\n(iv) the National Institute for Zorig Chusum (NIZC), which has provided, since 1971, 3- to 5-year\ncourses on traditional arts and craft skills, including basic education subjects for those aged 14\nand above and who have completed primary school; and (v) the Trashiyangtse Institute for Zorig\nChusum (TIZC),11 which has provided, since 1997, similar courses on traditional arts and craft\nskills  and,  depending  on  the  required  skills,  two-year  advanced  courses.  The  RTI  is  the  most\nrelevant  institute  for  basic  skills  development  because  of  its  location  in  Kharbandi  near  the\nindustrial sites and its relatively wider training curriculum.\n\nThe  site  of  these  institutes  was  determined  mainly  on  the  basis  of  their  access  to  (i)\n12. \nindustry and the teaching faculty (RTI and RBP), (ii) the market (NIZC), and (iii) raw materials\n(TIZC).  Unfortunately,  the  location  was  not  always  convenient  to  students,  particularly  for\nfemales  in  rural  areas.  However,  with  the  development  of  new  infrastructure  in  the  rural\nelectrification,12 telecommunication, and road sectors,13 new business opportunities will open up\nto provide greater access to the training institutes and improve social services for villagers. The\nPPTA  recommended  that  the  TVET  system  be  expanded  by  providing  regional  training  hubs\nand mobile training teams capable of reaching local communities in rural areas. The reform of\nNDTI,  another  PPTA  recommendation,  is  important  because  the  improved  road  networks  are\ngenerating  demand  for  drivers  due  to  the  unprecedented  growth  in  industry  and  for  the  self-\nemployed businesses in domestic transport, and freight - handling and distribution.\n\nThe  Government  has  piloted  various  modalities  for  delivering  skills  training.  One\n13. \nmodality  is  the  village  skills  development  programs  that  already  cover  700  villagers  through\nnonformal  training  programs  comprising  not  only  commonly  required  skills  such  as  plumbing,\nthe\ncarpentry,  and  mechanical \ncompetitiveness of products in the local communities.\n\nrepairs,  but  also  village-specific  skills \n\nto  enhance \n\nOther  public  institutions  under  various  ministries  and  agencies  offer  in-country  training\n14. \nopportunities, including the Royal Institute of Management, the National Institute of Traditional\nMedicine, the Bhutan Forestry Institute in Thimphu, and the Natural Resource Training Institute.\nThe  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Department  of  Tourism,  and  other  ministries  also  offer  short-term\nbasic skills training courses mostly for their staff. The National Women\u2019s Association of Bhutan\n(NWAB), established in 1981, provides nonformal training for skills development associated with\nmicrocredit  schemes.  NWAB  also  established  several  small-scale  training  centers  for  weaving\n\n                  \n\nstarted as RTI in 1986.\n\n10  RTI  was  originally  founded  as  Don  Bosco  Technical  School.  It  was  taken  over  by  the  Government  in  1982  and\n\n11  Formerly Rigney Institute in Trashiyangtse.\n12  Loan 1712-BHU(SF): Sustainable Rural Electrification Project, for $10 million, approved on 25 November 1999.\n13  Loan 1763-BHU(SF): Road Improvement Project, for $9.6 million, approved on 3 October 2000.\n\n\f5\n\nand  handicraft  production  for  rural  women,  in  collaboration  with  the  Government  and\ninternational  aid  agencies  such  as  United  Nations  International  Children\u2019s  Emergency  Fund\n(UNICEF).  There  is  an  urgent  need  for  NTTA  to  coordinate  with  the  concerned  ministries  and\norganizations,  to  establish  a  national  vocational  qualification  framework,  skill  standards,  and  a\ncertificate and program accreditation system.\n\nThe private sector has only recently participated in TVET. Before the formulation of the\n15. \nprivatization and private sector development policy in 1997, there were no private sector training\ninstitutes  in  Bhutan.  With  Government  promotion  and  encouragement,  several  private  sector\ntraining  institutes  were  established  during  the  last  four  years,  mainly  in  Thimphu  and\nPhuentsholing.  In  Thimphu,  the  Visual  Institute  of  Technology  (VIT)  and  Info  Tech  Solutions\n(ITS)  started  providing  information  technology  (IT)  training  in  early  2000,  and  Kesang  Driving\nSchool  (KDS)  was  established  in  late  1999.  In  Phuentsholing,  the  Computer  Management\nInstitute  (CMI)  and  Druk  Infotech  were  established  in  1999.  There  is  also  one  handicrafts\ninstitute in Thimphu giving short-term training in traditional arts and crafts programs for workers\nin  small  souvenir  business  stores.  The  PPTA  recommended  that  NTTA  create  business\nopportunities for private training institutes by consigning training to accredited private institutes\ninstead  of  providing  subsidies,  or  investing  in  NTTA  facilities  that  may  duplicate  training\nactivities  by \nthe  private  sector.  The  program  accreditation  and  consignment  policy\ncomplemented by support in the form of start-up capital and other incentives will create a cost-\neffective and market-relevant training system through the growth of private training institutes.\n\nTo decide the most cost-effective approach to establish a strategic location for a TVET\n16. \nreform center, the PPTA evaluated options, such as renovating the existing NTTA headquarters\nbuilding  or  one  of  its  training  institutes,  or  constructing  a  new  headquarters  building.  For  its\naccess to industry and the commercial zone, RTI was chosen for the reform center where major\ntechnical functions such as training in package design, industry liaison, and training delivery will\nbe established. NTTA will be in charge of developing policies, and implementing and monitoring\nthe reform program.\n\n3. \n\nDemand for Skills Training14\n\nSince  the  early  1960s,  Bhutan  has  implemented  policies  to  shift  from  a  traditional\n17. \neconomy  to  a  modern,  market-based  economy.  In  the  last  two  decades,  Bhutan's  economy\ngrew in real terms at the annual rate of 8.0 percent in the later part of the 1980s, 5.6 percent\nfrom  1991  to  1995,  and  6.0  percent  from  1996  to  1999,  due  to  industrialization  and\ndiversification of its economic activities. Agriculture declined from a share of 53 percent of the\ngross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  1981  to  37  percent  in  1998;  and  industry,  led  by\nmanufacturing, electricity, and construction, increased from 17 percent in 1981 to more than 35\npercent in 1998. Since the second half of the 1980s, private sector development was a priority\nof the Government and major State-owned enterprises were privatized. The buoyant growth of\nthe industry sector in the 1980s and 1990s created increasing demand for modern skilled and\nsemiskilled  workers.  Although  the  Government  had  given  high  priority  to  human  resource\ndevelopment, particularly in the general education sector to support its modernization program,\ndomestic  skilled  human  resources  were  not  well-developed.  To  meet  the  rapidly  increasing\ndemand from the industry sector, the Government resorted to the large pool of migrant workers\nfrom neighboring countries to fill the vacancies of skilled, semiskilled, and unskilled workers.\n\n                  \n\n14  TA3464-BHU: Basic Skills Development Project,  Final  Report,  December  2000,  Appendix  11  (Survey Report on\n\nthe Employment Patterns and Job Opportunities Survey, July-August 2000).\n\n\f6\n\nThe PPTA survey indicated that about 50,000 expatriate workers already occupy skilled\n18. \nand semiskilled jobs. With the Government\u2019s continued emphasis on private sector development\nunder the 8FYP (1997-2002) and 9FYP (2003-2007), about 3,500 new jobs are forecast to be\ncreated  each  year  in  the  industry  sector  in  the  foreseeable  future.  The  magnitude  of  the\npotential  job  opportunities  for  Bhutanese  workers  is  apparent.  If  the  pace  of  economic  growth\nand industrialization continues without the participation of educated Bhutanese in the workforce,\nthe  country  will  face  a  major  dilemma  of  unemployment  and  underemployment  in  the  near\nfuture. Already, signs show increasing urban unemployment. Development of human resources,\nparticularly  employable  skills,  is  therefore  a  priority  national  issue.15  However,  the  country  still\nlacks the relevant training facilities, labor administration system for private sector employment,\nand an effective labor market monitoring system. Lack of reliable statistics makes it difficult to\nassess the domestic labor market.\n\nBased  on  Bhutan's  official  population  estimate  of  638,000  in  1998,  the  labor  force\n19. \ncomprised about 54 percent (345,000) at age 15-59 and about 42 percent (268,000) below age\n15. Both sexes in the category below age 15 have access to basic education. Primary education\nenrollments  in  1996  were  72  percent  and  are  steadily  increasing  to  95  percent,  the  current\ntarget  under  the  8FYP  (1997-2002).  As  a  result,  about  4,200  students  from  grades  8-10  are\nexpected to graduate in 2001.16\n\nDespite  the  increasing  number  of  educated  youth  coming  into  the  labor  market,  it  will\n20. \ntake time to improve the employability of graduates in the areas of traditional and modern skills,\nparticularly  in  the  service,  maintenance,  small-  and  medium-scale  manufacturing,  and\nconstruction  sectors.  This  is  mainly  because  private  sector  employers  do  not  believe  the\ngraduates  have  adequate  qualifications,  including  practical  skills  and  job-related  experience.17\nMoreover,  despite  signs  of  change  due  to  the  difficulties  in  getting  jobs,  graduates  have  been\nreluctant  to  join  the  private  sector  due  to  their  traditional  career  preference  for  a  high-status,\nwhite-collar occupation in the public sector. This mismatch of expectations between employers\nand job seekers has been further aggravated by the relatively less attractive working conditions\nin  the  private  sector  than  in  the  public  sector  and  the  different  salary  structures.  The  public\nsector  has  a  relatively  flat  salary  structure,  whereas  the  private  sector  has  entry-level  salaries\nthat  are  much  lower  initially  but  have  greater  potential  for  growth  depending  on  individual\nperformance.\n\nDue to the difference in expectations between job seekers and employers, the influx of\n21. \neducated  youth  onto  the  labor  market  is  already  resulting  in  urban  youth  unemployment  and\nunfilled  vacancies  in  the  private  sector.  The  PPTA  report  on  employment  patterns  and  job\nopportunities in July-August 2000 indicated that, of about 53,000 positions that could be suitably\nfilled  by  grade  8  and  10  graduates,  4,800  in  various  occupations  were  vacant.  On  the  other\nhand, the Government's national labor force survey18 in 1999 estimated the unemployment rate\nat 16.1 percent for the 15-19 age group in the urban areas compared with 1.5 percent for the\nsame  age  group  in  the  rural  areas,  and  the  average  national  unemployment  rate  of  1.4\npercent.19  A  similar  problem  exists  for  the  20-24  age  group.  The  unemployment  rate  in  the\nurban  areas  is  generally higher  than in the rural areas, as the agriculture and forestry sectors\n\n                  \n\n15  Country Assistance Plan 2001-2003, December 2000, para. 53.\n16  National Employment Board, Bhutan, October 2000, Urbanization and Youth Employment, A Presentation to the\n\nRoundtable Meeting of Donors in Thimphu, 7-9th October 2000.\n\n17  TA3464-BHU: Basic Skills Development Project, Final Report, December 2000, Appendix 13 (Report on the Job\n\nAttitudes of Students and their Teachers, July-August 2000).\n\n18  National Labor Force Survey, 1998 and 1999: Bhutan, Tables 4.2a and 4.2b.\n19  The unemployment rate is the proportion of the economically active labor force that is not in employment.\n\n\f7\n\ncan  absorb  unemployable  youth  more  readily  as  part  of  family  labor.  However,  the  urban\nunemployment rate, which is 10 times higher than the rural unemployment rate, appears to be\ntoo high.\n\nIn 1998 and 1999, unemployment in the urban areas was concentrated in the 15-24 age\n22. \ngroup.  The  unemployment  rates  of  urban  youth  for  this  age  bracket  are  rising  while  the\nunemployment  rates  for  higher  age  groups  (age  25  and  over)  are  declining.  This  situation\ndeveloped because (i) when the labor force of age 25 and over completed their education, they\nenjoyed more favorable recruiting by the public sector, which valued the educational attainment\nof the youth until the Government decided to control the increase of public sector employment in\nthe late 1990s; and (ii) private employers seek from graduates a suitable level of education and\nspecific  skills  experience,  rather  than  a  high  level  of  education.  Employers  utilize  expatriate\nlabor because they have more practical experience than Bhutanese youth. Most of the current\nand  future  vacancies  are  found  in  building  and  construction,  manufacturing,  retailing,  and\nbusiness  services.  There  is  an  urgent  need  to  train  young  Bhutanese  to  fill  these  existing  or\nexpected vacancies. Moreover, although the unemployment rate for the higher age group is still\nless than the average urban unemployment rate of 3.3 percent, it is possible that unemployment\nin the higher age bracket will also be affected soon, mainly due to the aging of the unemployed\nyouth.  Due  to  the  Government  policy  to  limit  the  size  of  the  civil  service  and  the  difficulty  of\ngetting jobs, students are already changing their traditional preference for a public sector career\nand instead are seeking skills training to gain employment in the industry sector.\n\nTo  address  the  mismatch  in  student  career  aspirations  and  the  expectations  of\n23. \nemployers  in  the  private  sector,  NTTA,  in  collaboration  with  MOHE,  has  piloted  school-based\nvocational  training  and  career  counseling  including  instruction  on  work  values  as  part  of\nextracurricular  activities  to  broaden  the  career  aspirations  of  students.  NTTA  is  planning  to\nstrengthen vocational elements in general education in collaboration with MOHE by introducing\nmore  contacts  with  private  enterprise  such  as  excursion  visits  to  private  firms  and  inviting\nbusiness persons to the classroom to address students as well as teachers.\n\n4. \n\nPoverty, Human Resource, and Gender Issues20\n\nAs  with  some  other  economic  indicators  in  Bhutan,  reliable  data  on  incomes  are  not\n24. \navailable.  The  United  Nations  (UN)  classified  Bhutan  among  the  least  developed  countries,\nranking  it  as  142nd  out  of  174  countries  in  the  human  development  index  (HDI)  in  1998.\nNevertheless, the quality of life in the country seems higher than might be inferred from the HDI\ndue  to  the  small  population  and  relatively  equal  distribution  of  landholding.  Moreover,  the\nextended  family  and  village  systems  provide  security  for  the  most  vulnerable  groups,  and  a\nsystem of lending/borrowing food during the off-season helps the poorer families, as does the\nBhutan  Food  Corporation\u2019s  \u201cfair  price\u201d  shops  and  access  to  natural  produce  grown  in  forests.\nPrimary  health  care  and  medical  services,  and  basic  education  are  provided  free.  With  this\nsocial background, poverty is not as abject as in other parts of South Asia.\n\nHowever, the per capita gross national product (GNP) of $586 per annum or $1.60 per\n25. \nday  indicates  income  poverty.  The  Government  also  recognizes  that  income  disparity  may\ngradually  increase  due  to  the  transition  from  a  traditional,  rural-based  economy  to  a  modern\n\n                  \n\n20  STS:  BHU  2000-02:  Country Operational Strategy, Bhutan,  October  2000,  Country Assistance Plan, Bhutan,\nDecember 2000 and TA3464-BHU: Basic Skills Development Project, Final Report, December 2000, Appendix 12\n(Social Assessment Report, July-August 2000).\n\n\f8\n\nprivate-sector-led  market  economy.21  Thus,  it  is  imperative  to  increase  income  levels  by\npromoting  economic  growth  and  social  inclusiveness  through  interventions  in  physical  and\nsocial  infrastructure,  including  skills  training  in  conjunction  with  strong  employment  promotion\nfacilities to keep pace with private sector development.\n\nVillagers  in  rural  areas  of  the  country  do  not  have  adequate  skills  to  participate  in\n26. \ndevelopment  work.  This  lack  of  basic  skills  will  reduce  the  development  impact  of  the\nGovernment's  physical  and  social  infrastructure  program,  including  rural  electrification,  roads\nextension, water supply, and primary health care services. Training the villagers in basic skills\nwill ensure that they can repair and maintain village property, community schools, basic health\ncenters, roads, and water supply systems as well as have opportunities to earn off-farm income\nas  the  economy  develops.  Providing  training  opportunities  through  mobile  training  facilities  is\none option to improve the capacity of the rural villages.\n\nBhutanese  women  play  a  major  role  in  community  development  activities.  Women  do\n27. \nnot suffer from gender discrimination as they have equal status with men and enjoy the same\nlevel  of  freedom  under  the  law.22  Indeed,  property  inheritance  laws  in  particular  favor  women,\nand  most  households  are  headed  by  women.  Women\u2019s  participation  in  decision  making  at\ncommunity meetings is as high as 70 percent. However, women are more likely to stay on the\nfarm  as  unpaid  family  workers  compared  with  men  who  tend  to  look  for  jobs  offering  cash\nincome.  As  a  result,  women  are  relatively  isolated  from  cash  income  opportunities  while\notherwise  treated  equally  in  the  society.  In  TVET  enrollments,  males  still  dominate  due  to\ndemand by industrial employers, particularly the construction industry and public sector, which\ntraditionally  appear  as  leading  sectors  in  the  early  stage  of  national  development.  Gender\nbalance  in  TVET  enrollment  and  in  employment  in  the  private  sector  need  to  be  improved  to\ncreate more equitable access to employment as well as cash income opportunities for women.\n\n5. \n\nKey Issues\n\nThe  most  vexing  labor  market  issue  is  that,  despite  vacancies  in  the  labor  market,\n28. \nBhutanese  youth  have  difficulty  finding  employment  after  completing  their  general  education\nbecause  they  lack  employable  skills  and  their  traditional  preference  is  for  employment  in  the\npublic  service.  Employers  are  dissatisfied  with  the  skills  attainment  of  Bhutanese  youth  and\ntherefore fill vacancies with expatriate laborers from neighboring countries. The broader issue is\nthat national development without job opportunities for the Bhutanese is not compatible with the\ncountry\u2019s  priority  goal  of  self-reliance.  It  is  also  difficult  for  Bhutan  to  limit  the  number  of\nexpatriate laborers as it will result in a loss of competitiveness of Bhutanese labor in the medium\nto long term, which is again not compatible with the Government\u2019s goal of self-reliance.\n\nThe  key  to  further  economic  development  is  to  make  Bhutanese  workers  more\n29. \ncompetitive,  with  a  focus  on  making  educated  youth  better  prepared  for  private  sector\nemployment.  The  Government  must  undertake  TVET  reform  by  (i)  developing  employment-\noriented  skills  training  for  Bhutanese  workers;  (ii)  strengthening  policy  coordination  and\nmanagement  for  redeveloping  and  institutionalizing  a  national  TVET  system,  (iii)  changing  the\njob orientation or values system of educated youth during primary and secondary education and\nTVET by effective employment counseling and job placement services; (iv) accelerating private\nsector development and diversification to create more employment opportunities for Bhutanese\nworkers;  and  (v)  establishing  appropriate  employment  and  labor  administration  policies  to\n\n                  \n\n21  Bhutan 2020: A Vision for Peace, Prosperity and Happiness, Royal Government of Bhutan.\n22  STS: BHU 2000-02: Country Operational Strategy, Bhutan, October 2000, gender issues, para. 37.\n\n\f9\n\nimprove  working  conditions  in  the  private  sector,  which  are  still  not  as  secure  as  those\nestablished in the public sector. For the sustainable reform of TVET, the following activities will\nbe  introduced:  a  reliable  labor  market  information  system;  a  cost-sharing  arrangement  with\nprivate  sector  enterprises,  including  consigning  implementation  of  training  programs  to  the\nprivate  sector  training  institutes;  and  implementing  mobile  training  programs  to  reach  in\nparticular women and youth in rural areas.\n\nB. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\nThe  8FYP  (1997-2002)23  targets  a  national  gross  primary  school  enrollment  rate  of  95\n30. \npercent  by  the  year  2002.  Having  achieved  significant  improvement  in  the  country\u2019s  basic\neducation  system,  the  emphasis  in  the  sector  is  gradually  shifting  to  skills  development.  The\nacute  shortage of  locally trained personnel at all skill levels and the heavy reliance on foreign\nlabor has been a major Government concern. Although the country has had to rely on expatriate\nlabor  to  overcome  this  constraint,  the  Government  realizes  that  dependence  on  expatriates  is\nonly  a  temporary  solution.  Developing  indigenous  human  resources  on  the  basis  of  the\nachievement  in  basic  education  has  become  a  priority  development  objective.  Both  Bhutan\n2020:  A  Vision  for  Peace,  Prosperity  and  Happiness,  and  the  Human  Resource  Development\n(HRD) Master Plan (1997-2002) recommend (i) developing short-term technical, vocational, and\nprofessional  courses;  (ii)  strengthening  HRD  institutions  including  the  TVET  institutions  in\nconjunction  with  employment  counseling  services;  and  (iii)  encouraging  private  sector\nparticipation, including the Bhutan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCCI). These policies\nwill be continued by and further elaborated in the 9FYP (2003-2007).\n\nIn  its  Project  Profiles,24  the  8FYP  incorporates  several  projects  related  to  TVET,\n31. \nincluding  the  strengthening  of  NDTI,  hotel  management  and  tourism  training,  developing  RTI\nand  TIZC  and  basic  skills  development  programs.  However,  projects  that  different  ministries\nlisted  for  implementation  have  little  focus  on  a  national  TVET  system,  and  linkages  between\nindividual projects are not clear in the plan. Unlike the power and industry sectors, which include\nunder  the  respective  project  profiles  the  development  of  an  electricity  act,  standards  and\nguidelines  for  power  supply,  and  industrial  standards,  the  8FYP  does  not  indicate  clear\ninitiatives  for  an  employment  act,  vocational  qualifications,  and  skills  and  quality  standards  for\nthe  TVET  sector;  however  NEB  is  taking  steps  to  address  these  important  issues.  The  PPTA\nassisted  NTTA  in  formulating  a  skills  development  investment  plan,25  not  only  to  address  the\ndeficiencies in the above plan but also to clarify the scope of investment under the Project with a\nspecific focus on basic skills development. To facilitate project implementation before the loan\nbecomes  effective,  advisory  technical  assistance  (ADTA)26  will  assist  the  Government  in\nincorporating the investment plan in the 9FYP and in preparing basic skills development policies\nand strategies. Qualification and skills standards for TVET will be developed in the initial stage\nof the Project.\n\nC. \n\nExternal Assistance to the TVET Sector\n\nSince  1980s,  external  assistance  to  the  TVET  sector  has  amounted  to  $12.5  million,\n32. \nabout 20 percent  of the total skills training expenditure of the Government. ADB has provided\n\n                  \n\n23  Ministry of Planning, Royal Government of Bhutan, Eighth Five-Year Plan (1997-2002) Vol. 1 Main Document.\n24  Ministry of Planning, Royal Government of Bhutan, Eighth Five-Year Plan (1997-2002) Vol. 2 Project Profiles.\n25  TA3464-BHU:  Basic  Skills  Development  Project,  Final  Report,  December  2000,  Appendix  16  (The  Skills\n\n26  TA3525-BHU: Institutional Development of the National Technical Training Authority,  for  $300,000,  approved  on\n\nDevelopment Investment Plan)\n\n27 October 2000, financed by JSF.\n\n\f10\n\nassistance  in  establishing  the  Royal  Institute  of  Management,  expanding  the  Royal  Bhutan\nPolytechnic  to  improve  the  quality  of  training  and  double  the  intake  capacity,  and  establishing\nthe  NTTA27  to  coordinate  TVET  activities  in  the  country  and  strengthen  its  capabilities  in\nproviding  necessary  skills  training  to  meet  market  demand.  Apart  from  ADB,  the  major\ndevelopment partners supporting the TVET sector include the Government of Germany through\nGTZ  and  United  Nations  Development  Programme \nInternational  volunteer\norganizations  and  NGOs  were  also  active:  Helvetas  Swiss  Association  for  International\nCooperation  (HELVETAS),  Japan  Overseas  Cooperation  Volunteers  (JOCV),  Netherlands\nDevelopment  Organization  (SNV),  and  Save  the  Children  of  the  United  States  (US).  Major\nexternal assistance is summarized in Appendix 3.\n\n(UNDP). \n\nGTZ  has  been  supporting  the  RTI  for  more  than  a  decade  by  constructing  workshop\n33. \nbuildings and providing equipment. GTZ recently decided to complete its long-term assistance\nby providing consulting services to improve the quality of RTI training courses. UNDP is funding\nvarious activities to promote TVET through the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) and BCCI.\nJapan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA)  also  expressed  interest  and  readiness  to\nconsider  a  technical  and  vocational  training  project,  subject  to  a  formal  Government  request.\nHELVETAS of Switzerland supported a skills development program through MTI for 1997-1999\non a pilot basis. But, because the TVET sector lacked a central coordinating agency before the\nestablishment of NTTA in 1999, previous investments were constrained by unclear TVET sector\nframeworks  and  mutual  linkages.  With  NTTA  as  the  executing  agency,  the  PPTA  was\nimplemented  in  coordination  with  UNDP,  JICA,  GTZ,28  and  other  aid  agencies  and  NGOs  to\navoid  duplication  and  to  seek  closer  linkages  and  synergy.29  As  a  result,  during  project\npreparation,  GTZ  and  ADB  agreed  with  the  Government  to  act  as  parallel  financiers  for  the\nProject.  Further,  the  Government  plans  to  utilize  technical  volunteers  from  JOCV  and  other\nsources as workshop technicians and assistant instructors during the start-up period.\n\nD. \n\nLessons Learned\n\nThe  implementation  of  the  Technical  and  Vocational  Education  and  Training  Project\n34. \n(footnote  3)  approved  on  27  September  1990  suffered  serious  delays  before  its  completion  in\nJune 2000.30 The start-up phase was delayed by two years because UNDP, a parallel financier,\ntook a long time in finalizing the arrangements for its consulting services. The project was also\ndelayed  substantially  by  the  executing  agency\u2019s  unfamiliarity  with  ADB  procedures  and\npractices  in  almost  all  aspects  of  implementation,  including  loan  signing,  loan  effectiveness,\nselecting  consultants,  awarding  contracts,  procurement,  disbursement,  and  submitting\nwithdrawal  applications  and  audited  financial  statements.  Although  the  Government  had\nassigned  an  experienced  staff  to  the  Project  as  project  manager,  the  shortage  of  skilled\npersonnel  remained  a  serious  constraint.  In  addition,  Bhutan\u2019s  mountainous  terrain  and\nscattered population made it difficult to locate appropriate project sites.\n\nADB\u2019s  recent  project  impact  evaluation  study31  as  well  as  the  current  PPTA  identified\n35. \nimportant lessons: project design must be commensurate with the capacity of the beneficiaries;\n\n                  \n\n27  TA  1381-BHU:  Institutional  Improvements  in  Technical  and  Vocational  Education  and  Training  Project,  for\n\n$750,000, approved on 27 September 1990.\n\n28  GTZ, JICA, and UNDP were invited to three national workshops under the PPTA.\n29  Memorandum  of  Understanding  between  NTTA,  ADB,  and  GTZ  on  cooperation  in  the  field  of  vocational  and\ntechnical  training  and  education,  21  June  2000,  Appendix  3,  Aide  Memoire;  TA  Fact-Finding  Mission  for\nInstitutional Development of the National Technical Training Authority from 15 to 23 June 2000.\n\n30  Draft project completion report by the borrowers, October 2000.\n31  IES: REG 99035: Impact Evaluation Study of the Technical and Vocational Education Projects, December 1999.\n\n\f11\n\nand key government agencies, line ministries and their training units, private sector employers,\nand  NGOs  must  be  willing  and  able  to  cooperate  in  project  activities.  More  importantly,  the\nlatest ADB report on sector synthesis of evaluation findings (SSES)32 indicates lack of linkages\nbetween  schools  and  industries  as  one  of  the  weakest  aspects  of  the  TVET  programs.  The\nreport  specifically  pointed  out  several  key  issues,  lessons  and  recommendations  for  future\nproject design: (i) the need for skill-based training and industry linkages in the TVET subsector,\nemphasizing the continuous identification of the needs of industry and introduction of on-the-job-\ntraining  (OJT)  and  entrepreneurial  training  components;  (ii)  sufficient  budgetary  allocations  for\noperation  and  maintenance,  particularly  for  parts  and  consumables  for  imported  equipment  to\nensure utilization of project facilities; (iii) decentralized decision making and greater autonomy to\ntechnical  institutes  to  allow  their  timely  and  effective  interaction  with  local  industries;  (iv)  a\nperformance  monitoring  system  to  monitor  and  control  the  decentralized  activities;  and  (v)\ngreater  coordination  among  agencies  to  introduce  a  set  of  policies  to  support  TVET  reform,\nparticularly  private  sector  participation  in  the  reform  process  through  tax  incentives  to  help\nimprove  facilities  in  private  training  institutes,  and  a  Government  policy  to  outsource  training\nservices to the private sector. The ADB report emphasized the need for proper maintenance of\ntraining facilities. Proper training of school administrators is another success factor.\n\nIn  its  operations  in  the  TVET  sector  in  various  countries,  ADB  has  noticed  that\n36. \ngovernments  often  provide,  at  high  unit  cost  and  even  in  direct  competition  with  the  private\nsector, supply-driven skills training programs of such poor quality and relevance that graduates\ndo not gain in employability or productivity. The region nevertheless contains good examples of\ncountries33  that  have  clear  and  effective  skills  development  policies:  Republic  of  Korea,\nSingapore, and Taipei,China have ensured the availability of needed skills within the framework\nof an effective national skills development policy linked to an economic development strategy.\n\nIn close consultation with NTTA, these lessons were carefully incorporated in the project\n37. \ndesign, including the introduction of an industry liaison and publicity unit (IPU), industry training\ncommittees  (ITCs),  and  a  labor  market  and  manpower  information  system  to  strengthen\nlinkages with industry. Moreover, during the PPTA, NTTA introduced an apprenticeship program\nwith a cost-sharing scheme with private firms. The Project will include a monitoring system that\nwill  not  only  provide  for  conventional  project  benefit  and  monitoring  but  also  help  NTTA  to\npromote  the  TVET  decentralization  process  through  monitoring  and  controlling  individual\nactivities  by  budget  and  targets.  Furthermore,  the  ADTA  (footnote  26)  will  be  implemented  in\nclose collaboration with GTZ, from May to September 2001, to assist NTTA to (i) formulate the\npolicy agenda to support successful TVET reform through interministerial coordination, so as to\nbetter  utilize  the  resources  of  the  private  sector  for  improving  the  training  program  in  a  cost-\neffective  and  relevant  manner;  and  (ii)  strengthen  the  job  placement  services.  Major  external\nassistance  and  lessons  learned  from  the  operations  in  Bhutan  are  summarized  together  with\ntheir incorporation in the project design in Appendix 3.\n\nE. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy33\n\nADB\u2019s  country  operational  strategy  (COS)  focuses  on  poverty  reduction  by  promoting\n38. \neconomic  growth  and  social  inclusiveness  through  interventions  in  physical  and  social\ninfrastructure,  private  sector  development,  employment  creation,  and  improved  economic\nmanagement rather than targeting the especially vulnerable groups, many of whom live in very\nremote  areas.  The  operational  interventions  under  the  strategy  specifically  include  the\n\n                  \n\n32  Postevaluation Office. August 2000.

Policy on Education. 2 April.\n\n\f12\n\ndevelopment of the domestic skills base to provide Bhutanese labor with opportunities for more\nrewarding occupations.34\n\nTo  maintain  productivity  and  competitiveness,  the  Government  should  ensure  that  the\n39. \ncurrent  labor  force  continuously  acquires  new  skills  and  improves  existing  ones  and  that  new\nentrants  to  the  labor  force  have  an  adequate  skills  base.  ADB  will  assist  the  Government  in\ndeveloping  policies  and  strategies  to  facilitate  continuous  upgrading  and  adaptation  of  worker\nskills  while  ensuing  that  preemployment  skills  training  is  flexible  enough  to  promote\nopportunities for training among various groups of people.\n\nADB\u2019s  education  policy  includes  support  for  skills  development,  both  preemployment\n40. \nand workforce skills upgrading, by (i) developing the Government's capacity to coordinate skills\ntraining  and  to  establish  and  monitor  skills  standards;  and  (ii)  encouraging  private  sector\nprovision of training by helping the Government to establish a conducive policy environment and\nincentives. Support for Government provision of skills training can be justified in the absence of\na  private  sector  alternative,  but  even  then  the  strategy  should  be  to  help  create  a  facilitating\nclimate  for  the  establishment  of  private  sector  institutions  over  the  long  term  and  to  privatize\ngovernment programs as soon as feasible.\n\nF. \n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\nConsistent with ADB\u2019s sector strategy, policy dialogue with the Government emphasized\n41. \nthat the objective of the Project is to enhance the productivity and competitiveness of Bhutanese\nlaborers  and  make  them  employable  in  private  sector  enterprises.  The  extension  of  skills\ntraining  facilities  to  rural  villages,  which  is  feasible  now  following  major  infrastructure\ndevelopment financed partly by ADB, will facilitate this objective and also have an impact on the\ngender  balance  of  skills  training  participants  and  the  capacity  to  benefit  from  national\ndevelopment by improving the skills of those who did not have access to training. Following the\nrecommendations  of  the  PPTA  and  ADB  policy  dialogue,  the  Government  agreed  to  (i)\nstrengthen  its  capacity  for  TVET  coordination  by  adopting  a  national  vocational  qualifications\nframework;  (ii)  develop  and  implement  quality  standards  through  accreditation;  and  (iii)\nintroduce a policy promoting equitable access to ensure a balanced gender impact on national\ndevelopment,  and  a  policy  on  partnership  with  the  private  sector  to  encourage  private  sector\nparticipation in TVET operations, as indicated in the individual project components. NTTA will be\nresponsible for these matters under the Project.\n\nThe current mismatch between the attitude and qualifications of educated youth and the\n42. \nexpectations and needs of employers was a key theme of the policy discussions. The problem\nhas  resulted  from  the  socioeconomic  development  of  the  country  led  by  the  predominance  of\nthe public sector in early national development. The situation can be corrected by appropriate\ninterventions  including  policies  to  support  TVET  reform  and  private  sector  development.  ADB\nemphasized the need to accelerate the reform process to make it credible and cost-effective in\nthe short term and therefore sustainable in the long term. In this respect, a policy agenda that\nwill  require  the  coordination  and  cooperation  of  several  ministries  was  proposed.  The\nGovernment  gave  its  assurance  that  it  will  take  the  initiative  in  leading  interministerial\ncoordination in formulating policies to support the reform process.\n\n34  STS: BHU 2000-02: Executive Summary and Bhutan COS Synthesis, para. 36; and Country Operational Strategy,\n\n                  \n\nOctober 2000. pages iv-v and vii.\n\n\f13\n\nGiven that the unit cost of TVET is higher than that of the general education system, the\n43. \nGovernment  agreed  to  (i)  encourage  private  sector  enterprises  to  participate  in  the  TVET\nsystem  through  apprenticeship  programs  and  programs  on  accreditation  and  consignment  of\ntraining; and (ii) introduce a cost recovery system, not only to cover the higher operating cost of\nTVET but also to limit the provision of free training by NTTA in areas where the private sector is\ncapable of providing training, particularly IT training for which four private training institutes are\nalready  in  commercial  operation.  After  a  review  of  the  8FYP,  which  indicated  the  need  for\ncoordination  in  investments  and  policy  framework  in  the  sector,  the  Government  gave  its\nassurance that the findings would be incorporated in the 9FYP by providing a separate section\nfor the TVET sector and incorporating coordination and policy development activities, in addition\nto the individual infrastructure development projects.\n\nThe Government's policy on private sector development was included in the dialogue, in\n44. \nparticular,  the  need  for  further  promoting  private  sector  activities  by  (i)  contracting  out  public\nservices  that  are  suitable  for  the  private  sector:  skills  training  programs,  public  works  and\nphysical environmental services, general municipal services, park and recreation facilities, and\ntransportation; (ii) further promoting entrepreneurship activities through the existing investment\ncenters around the country to provide assistance in starting private businesses, and (iii) further\ncommercialization, corporatization, or privatization of State-owned-enterprises. The Government\nrecently  established  a  private  sector  development  committee  consisting  of  senior  government\nofficials to take appropriate actions on these matters and advance private sector development\nduring project implementation. This committee will improve the linkage between TVET and the\nprivate sector.\n\nDuring  policy  discussions35  it  was  pointed  out  that  a  clear  industrial  policy  had  not  yet\n45. \nbeen established. An industrial policy would provide clear Government guidance, direction, and\ndevelopment priorities to the new TVET system and private sector development. While the new\nTVET system should be market driven, clear guidelines provided by the Government's industrial\npolicy will reduce the risk that short-term market interests may mislead the new TVET system.\nMoreover,  due  to  the  essentially  inflexible  nature  of  TVET  operations,  which  are  involved  with\nrelatively expensive and specialized training facilities, the implementation of a sound industrial\npolicy will be an essential tool to develop an effective, efficient, and sustainable TVET system\nwith  strong  links  to  the  future  employment  prospects  of  its  trainees.  The  Government  clarified\nthat policies exist but need to be further developed. A comprehensive industrial policy is under\npreparation and the policy agenda to be formulated will incorporate the above concerns.\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROJECT\n\nSince 1981, Bhutan has experienced robust economic growth while diversifying from a\n46. \ntraditional subsistence economy to a modern economy. This growth has been accompanied by\nsignificant growth in modern sector employment, particularly in construction, manufacturing, and\nbusiness services. However, Bhutanese youth lack appropriate skills, and have been unable to\ntake  advantage  of  these  employment  opportunities.  Substantial  investment  in  basic  education\nover the past several decades has produced a large cohort of educated youth, many of whom\nhave  remained  unemployed  despite  the  existing  employment  opportunities.  Unless  these\ngraduates  can  be  provided  with  employable  skills,  they  face  an  uncertain  future  with  little\n\n35 STS: BHU 2000-02: Country Operational Strategy, Bhutan, October 2000, para. 12.\n\n                  \n\n\f14\n\nprospect  for  employment  and  income-generating  opportunities.  At  the  same  time  the  country,\nwill  be  unable  to  utilize  its  domestic  human  resources  to  promote  national  development,  and\nsocial  problems  associated  with  a  growing  pool  of  unemployed  urban  youth  are  bound  to\nincrease. The TVET system is poorly positioned to provide the high-quality training required by\nthe  growing  private  sector.  The  Government  plans  to  upgrade  the  TVET  system  by  improving\nthe policy framework of the system; upgrading the quality and relevance of training; expanding\naccess, particularly for women and the rural villagers who currently do not have access to skills\ntraining; and improving the system\u2019s responsiveness to private sector demands.\n\nB. \n\nObjective and Scope\n\nThe project seeks to improve the quality and relevance of the TVET system to enable it\n47. \nto  provide  employment-oriented  basic  skills  training  to  new  school  graduates,  unemployed\nyouth, domestic laborers, people in rural areas, particularly women and the poor. Such training\nwill give the target groups access to employment and income-generating opportunities and will\nexpand  the  capacity  to  provide  skilled  human  resources  to  promote  private  sector  growth  as\nwell as to meet the demand for skilled workers in the private sector. To achieve the objective,\nthe  Project  will  (i)  strengthen  the  institutional  capacity  for  policy  making,  planning,  and\ncoordination  in  the  TVET  sector,  and  for  delivering  basic  skills  training  relevant  to  the  market\nneeds  and  commensurate  with  the  capacity  of  the  beneficiaries;  (ii)  increase  access  to  basic\nskills  training  by  expanding  the  TVET  system  to  include  community-based  programs,  and\nrehabilitating  existing  and  establishing  new  facilities;  (iii)  improve  the  quality  of  basic  skills\ntraining by increasing links with the private sector; and (iv) promote effective utilization of basic\nskills by developing employment guidance and placement services. The Project will have three\ncomponents.\n\n1. \n\nInstitutional Capacity Building (Component 1)\n\nPolicy  Development.  To  accomplish  sustainable  TVET  reforms  in  basic  skills\n48. \ndevelopment,  the  priority  is  to  develop  a  mechanism  in  the  TVET  sector  to  formulate  skills\ndevelopment  policies  and  strategies;  and  then  plan,  develop,  and  implement  an  employment-\noriented  TVET  system  in  a  cost-effective  manner  in  close  coordination  with  private  sector\nenterprises,  private  training  institutes,  and  relevant  government  agencies.  NTTA  will  take  the\nlead  role  in  building  the  employment-oriented  TVET  system.  Before  implementing  the  Project,\nthe  ADTA  consultants  and  consultants  financed  by  the  Government  of  Germany  will  assist\nNTTA  in  developing  appropriate  TVET  policies,  including  a  national  vocational  qualifications\npolicy,  equitable  access  promotion  policy,  private  sector  partnership  policy,  and  cost  sharing\npolicy.  The  team  of  consultants  will  assist  NTTA  and  concerned  ministries  to  prepare  a  draft\nTVET  promotion  policy  agenda  for  the  Government  to  implement  during  the  Project.  The\npolicies  aim  at  providing  NTTA  with  a  rationale  for  (i)  establishing  linkages  with  the  private\nsector; (ii) strengthening management capacity to support and administer key committees, units,\nand  training  institutes;  (iii)  supporting  the  delivery  of  training  packages;  skill  testing  through\nprivate training institutes and enterprises as well as its own training institutes; and (iv) improving\nother  activities  to  effectively  ensure  a  participatory  process  with  junior  high  and  high  school\nteachers  and  students  and  international  aid  agencies.  NTTA  will  implement  workshops  to\nconsult  with  various  stakeholders  and  disseminate  information  for  the  policy  formulation\nprocess.\n\nIndustry  Liaison  and  Publicity.  The  Project  will  assist  NTTA  in  establishing  the\n49. \nIndustry  Liaison  and  Publicity  Unit.  The  IPU  has  two  important  functions.  One  is  the  industry\nliaison  activities,  in  close  collaboration  with  the  industry  training  committees,  for  example,\n\n\f15\n\nfacilitating  linkage  between  TVET  and  private  enterprises  by  promoting  apprenticeship\nprograms,  consigning  or  cosponsoring  training  modules,  skills  testing  and  competitions,\naccreditation  of  training  programs,  and  feedback  from  employers  about  TVET  reform  and  the\nperformance  of  trainees.  The  IPU  will  also  conduct  publicity  activities  such  as  disseminating\nproject  information  on  TVET  policies,  the  vocational  qualification  framework,  and  skills\nstandards and certification. To accomplish cost-effective reforms in a relatively short period and\nconsidering  the  demand  orientation  of  the  training  programs,  it  is  important  for  NTTA  to\naccelerate and strengthen the participatory process by involving employers. NTTA will actively\npromote  the  new  framework  in  the  market  through  various  publicity  programs,  such  as\ncontacting employers directly and disseminating relevant information to the public to ensure the\ntransparency and accountability of the reform process.\n\nManagement  Strengthening.  Using  modern  computer  and  network  technologies,  the\n50. \nProject will assist NTTA in developing an effective management control system commensurate\nwith  NTTA's  capacity  in  terms  of  number  of  staff,  their  skill  levels,  and  office  facilities.  The\nmanagement control system will include (i) a management accounting and budgeting system for\nNTTA\u2019s  internal  use  to  control  activities  of  training  institutes  and  key  units  by  activity-linked\nbudgeting, in addition to the national financial accounting system required by laws for reporting\nto  external  authorities  such  as  the  Ministry  of  Finance  or  relevant  stakeholders;  (ii)  a  cost\naccounting  system  required  by  the  cost  sharing  policy  to  verify  the  cost-effectiveness  of\nindividual training programs to be consigned to the private sector; (iii) a financial management\nsystem to establish and monitor cash flows; (iv) a cash management system with a clear, built-\nin internal control system; and (v) an asset and inventory administration system to account for\ntimely repairs and replacement of equipment and efficient inventory control of spare parts and\ntraining  material.  The  cash  management  system,  including  fee  collections  and  payments,  is\nimportant because the education and skills training systems have been operated virtually free of\ncharge to students and the nationwide retail banking network is weak. Institutionalization of the\nmanagement control system will be closely monitored and strengthened by annual management\nreview by the consultants and NTTA. The international fellowships and regional and subregional\ntraining programs will be implemented.\n\nAlumni Administration System (AAS). One of the commonly observed weaknesses of\n51. \nthe  TVET  system  is  lack  of  alumni  data  due  to  the  mobility  and  diversity  of  graduates,  which\ninhibit the authorities from tracking the career of trainees after their graduation and establishing\na feedback loop to improve the TVET system. The AAS will create a network among graduates\nto help exchange work experience and employment information.\n\nTo  support  implementation  activities,  the  Project  will  provide  consulting  services,\n\n52. \nequipment, furniture, and vehicles.\n\n2. \n\nIncreasing Access to Basic Skills Training and Employment (Component 2)\n\nPromotion  of  Equitable  Access.  The  equitable  access  promotion  policy  will  enhance\n53. \naccess to basic skills training by expanding the existing institutional facilities and widening the\nchoice  of  trades,  providing  flexible  delivery  modes,  and  locating  facilities  in  more  accessible\nlocations.  Particular  attention  will  be  given  to  reach  women  in  rural  areas  who  did  not  have\naccess  to  social  services  including  skills  training  due  to  poor  roads  and  lack  of  other\ninfrastructure.  With  the  recent  improvements  on  the  road  network  (footnote  13)  and  rural\nelectrification  (footnote  12),  basic  skills  training  is  now  accessible  to  rural  villagers,  especially\nwomen  who  play  an  important  role  in  the  rural  community  of  Bhutan.  NTTA  will  conduct\nequitable access promotion activities, including in-house induction training programs for NTTA\n\n\f16\n\nand  its  institute  staff,  interim  evaluation  of  the  achievements  on  increased  access  in  each\ninstitute, and follow-up training incorporating gender sensitization programs for trainers.\n\nTraining  Institutes.  The  capacity  of  RTI\u2019s  facilities,  programs,  and  course  delivery  will\n54. \nbe  strengthened  and  expanded.  Competency-based  modular-style  training  packages  will  be\nintroduced  to  make  training  delivery  more  flexible  and  training  content  more  employment\noriented.  To  improve  internal  efficiency,  the  current  instructor-student  ratio  will  be  increased\nfrom  1:8  to  1:20  by  the  end  of  the  Project.  Expanding  the  RTI  main  campus  will  increase\nenrollment  from  about  300  to  750  students  by  the  end  of  the  Project.  Refurbishing  training\nfacilities in TIZC will increase the capacity from 37 to 170 equivalent full-time students, including\n50 taking short courses over the duration of the Project.\n\nTwo  new  RTI  extensions  will  be  established:  one  in  Trashigang  in  the  eastern  part  of\n55. \nBhutan  and  the  other  in  Punakha  in  northern  Bhutan.  The  extensions  will  increase  training\ncapacity  by  about  320  enrollees.  A  building  construction  training  center  (CTC)  including  a\nproduction unit to be established in Paro will have the capacity to train 100 equivalent full-time\ntrainees  and  workers  per  annum.  In  Thimphu,  an  Auto  Repair  Training  Center  (ARTC)  will  be\nestablished, with capacity to train 15 equivalent full-time trainees and workers. NDTI, currently\nlocated  in  Phuentsholing,  will  be  relocated  to  Punakha  as  a  new  driver  training  center  with\ncapacity  to  train  75  trainees.  Appendix  4  compares  the  facilities,  training  content,  and  staff\nbefore and after the Project.36\n\nPrivate  Sector  Partnership.  Under  the  private  sector  partnership  policy,  NTTA  will\n56. \nstrengthen apprenticeship programs, consign training programs to accredited private institutes,\nand develop customized short courses for in-house training demands. Having implemented 40\napprenticeships  for  unemployed  youth  on  a  pilot  basis,  NTTA  will  target  100  apprentices  per\nannum.\n\nCommunity  Access  Unit  (CAU).  CAU  will  give  rural  villagers  access  to  basic  skills\n57. \ntraining.  CAU  will  offer  general  basic  skills  training  and  identify  and  give  training  in  village-\nspecific  skills  to  enhance  the  income-earning  potential  of  local  communities  and  encourage\ncommunity entrepreneurship. In particular, CAU will assist in marketing local products through\nNTTA\u2019s advocacy system under IPU. A training program will be developed in the skills training\nresource unit (para. 63), in consultation with CAU, NWAB, and community representatives. CAU\nwill conduct skills needs assessment regularly as well as outreach training programs by sending\nmobile training teams to rural communities. The training program under CAU will be diversified\nto encourage the participation of rural women in skills training.\n\nJob  Placement  Office  (JPO).  The  Project  will  strengthen  NEB\u2019s  job  placement  and\n58. \nemployment guidance services by establishing JPO. Although the primary mandate of JPO is to\naddress  the  urban  unemployment  problem,  NEB  will  also  develop  a  plan  to  (i)  expand  JPO\nservices to be  conducted  in  the premises of secondary schools and training institutes, and (ii)\nincrease opportunities for consigning job placement services in major cities to the private sector\nenterprises for implementation by the Government.\n\nTeaching  and  training  materials,  equipment,  and  vehicles  as  well  as  office  equipment\n\n59. \nand furniture for the training institutes will be procured and trainers and staff will be trained.\n\n36  Specific locations are subject to land availability.\n\n                  \n\n\f17\n\n3. \n\nImproving Quality of Basic Skills Training37 (Component 3)\n\nThe  component  aims  to  enhance  the  quality  of  basic  skills  development  programs  by\n60. \ndeveloping (i) a labor market information system, (ii) a national qualifications framework, (iii) an\nemployment-oriented training system, (iv) entrepreneurship training for new business, and (v) a\ntraining system for trainers and staff. GTZ will implement this component.\n\nLabor  Market  Information  System  (LMIS).  It  is  difficult  to  assess  the  domestic  labor\n61. \nmarket structure due to lack of a monitoring system and reliable statistics. NTTA needs a LMIS\nto  visualize  the  labor  market  for  decision  making  in  the  strategy  process.  Before  developing\nLMIS,  NEB  will  review  the  national  labor  force  survey,  national  household  survey,  and  other\nmajor surveys and statistics. In close collaboration with NTTA, NEB will (i) identify the areas and\nformat of labor market monitoring for their own needs; and (ii) consult with the Central Statistical\nOrganization (CSO), Planning Commission, and other relevant agencies to define the linkages\nand establish an information hierarchy to institutionalize LMIS activities that will not duplicate or\nbe inconsistent with existing surveys.\n\nIndustry  Training  Committees  (ITC).  NTTA  will  establish  the  National  Qualifications\n62. \nUnit (NQU) in its headquarters to organize and coordinate ITCs for each industry sector in close\nconsultation  with  BCCI  and  operationalize  ITCs  by  holding  an  induction  workshop.  Industries\nrepresented by their ITCs may include, for example, (i) building and construction, (ii) electricity,\n(iii)  electronics,  (iv)  IT,  (v)  transport,  (vi)  retailing,  (vii)  tourism,  and  (viii)  business  and\ncommercial services. ITCs under NQU will develop, endorse and implement (i) the competency-\nbased  skills  standards,  (ii)  the  skills  testing  and  certification  system,  and  (iii)  the  training\nprogram  accreditation  and  consignment  system.  ITC  in  collaboration  with  the  NQU  and  NTTA\ntraining institutes will also review and update skills standards, testing and certificate system for\nnecessary adjustment to meet the local context and the progress of private sector development.\n\nSkills  Training  Resource  Unit  (STRU).  STRU  will  be  established  as  a  quality  control\n63. \ncenter  responsible  for  developing,  implementing,  and  updating  training  packages  including\ncurriculum,  training  material  and  trainer  training.  STRU  will  (i)  start  with  developing  nonformal\ntraining  packages  for  community  skills  development  for  the  use  of  CAU  in  consultation  with\nCAU,  NWAB,  and  community  representatives;  (ii)  develop  formal  training  packages  for  each\nmodule following establishment of the skills standards for corresponding modules by ITCs; and\n(iii)  train  trainers.  After  the  release  of  training  packages  for  nonformal  and  formal  programs,\nSTRU will undertake review and update cycles. The Project will assist STRU in maximizing the\nuse  of  computer  and  network  technologies  in  developing  the  curriculum  and  teaching  and\nlearning  materials.  However,  the  teaching  aids  and  textbooks  will  also  be  prepared  as  printed\nmaterial for use at the training sites.\n\nC. \n\nCost Estimates\n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project,  including  taxes  and  duties  and  interest,  is  estimated  at\n64. \n$12.5 million equivalent, including $6.8 million (55 percent) in foreign exchange and $5.7 million\n(45 percent) equivalent in local currency costs. The cost estimates are summarized in Table 1.\nDetailed cost estimates are in Appendix 5.\n\n                  \n\n37  Component 3 is subject to review and change, if necessary, by GTZ during implementation.

The  Government\nalso  requested  the  Government  of  Germany38  to  provide  a  grant  of  DM5  million  (about  $2.5\nmillion  equivalent  at  appraisal)  to  support  the  Project  on  a  parallel  basis.39  The  ADB  loan  will\nfinance up to $4.3 million in foreign exchange cost and $2.7 million equivalent in local currency\ncost.  The  Government  will  provide  counterpart  funds  of  at  least  $3.0  million  equivalent,\nrepresenting  24  percent  of  the  entire  project  cost.  ADB  will  finance  a  major  part  of  the  capital\nexpenditures  for  the  Project  while  the  Government  will  provide  the  counterpart  funds  to  cover\nthe  entire  recurrent  cost  and  part  of  the  capital  expenditures  as  necessary.  Details  of  the\nproposed grant offer by the Government of Germany are attached in Appendix 6.\n\nThe  capital  expenditures  for  ADB  financing  include  civil  works,  consulting  services,\n66. \nequipment  for  basic  skills  development,  training  and  workshops,  and  project  implementation\ncosts  to  cover  the  equipment,  furniture,  and  vehicles  of  the  project  implementation  unit  (PIU),\nbut exclude all costs of land acquisition, taxes and duties, right-of-way, utilities, and community\nlabor.  The  recurrent  cost  comprises  the  cost  of  trainers  and  other  government  staff,  and  the\n\n                  \n\n38  Project/Order No. 2000.2080.0: Advisory Services to the National Technical Training Authority (NTTA), Bhutan.\n39 GTZ,  the  parallel  financier  of  the  Project,  uses  cofinancing  for  joint  financing  arrangements  only.  To  avoid\n\nconfusion, the term parallel financing is used instead of cofinancing in this RRP.\n\n\f19\n\ncost of operations of basic skills development, including equipment maintenance. To meet the\nincremental recurrent cost incurred during and after the Project and maintain the operations of a\nnew  TVET  system,  the  Government  agreed  to  allocate  a  total  amount  of  at  least  $3.0  million\nequivalent on an incremental basis for implementing the Project for five years, and an estimated\namount of about $0.3 million equivalent annually on an incremental basis after completion of the\nProject. Details of the staffing requirements are in Appendix 7.\n\nThe loan will be repayable over 32 years with a grace period of 8 years and an interest\n67. \ncharge of 1.0 percent per annum during the grace period, and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter.\nA  portion  of  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  for  interest  payment.40  The  Borrower  will  be  the\nKingdom of Bhutan.\n\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\nSource\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nFinancing\nPercentage\n\nADB\nGovernment of Germanya\nRoyal Government of Bhutan\n\nTotal\n\n4.3\n2.5\n0.0\n\n6.8\n\n2.7\n0.0\n3.0\n\n5.7\n\nTotal\n\n7.0\n2.5\n3.0\n\n12.5\n\n56\n20\n24\n\n100\n\na  The  Government  of  Germany  will  provide  goods  and  services  to  be  implemented  by  GTZ  for  a  maximum  of\n\nDM5 million equivalent on a grant basis during a period up to end-2004.\n\nSource: Staff estimates.\n\nThe  provision  of  local  cost  financing  by  ADB  is  considered  justified  under  ADB\u2019s  local\n68. \ncurrency  financing  policy.41  Although  there  is  scope  for  expanding  domestic  revenues  through\naccelerated  industrialization  by  the  private  sector  and  infrastructure  development  such  as\nelectrification and road improvement, given the expansion of basic services such as education\nand health care, the need to sustain these services increasingly imposes an additional burden\non  local  resources.  Further,  despite  the  still  low  level  of  per  capita  income,  which  constrains\nnational savings and public finances, the Government has been able to achieve its policy target\nto  cover  all  recurrent  cost  expenditures  from  domestic  revenues  for  the  past  few  years  for\nsustainable development. In support of the Government policy, the Project will finance most of\nthe capital investment including local currency cost, while the Government will finance the entire\nrecurrent cost from the beginning of the project implementation period.\n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1. \n\nExecuting Agency\n\nNTTA will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the Project. NTTA is responsible for TVET\n69. \nreform  and  coordination  according  to  its  charter.  The  director  of  NTTA  will  be  the  project\ndirector.\n\n                  \n\n40  This paragraph is for indicative purposes only. The loan provision is determined by the loan agreement.\n41  R1-95: A Review of Lending Foreign Exchange for Local Currency Expenditure on Project, 3 January 1995.\n\n\f20\n\n2. \n\nProject Management and Implementation\n\n  A  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  chaired  by  NTTA  director  will  be  established  to\n70. \nmonitor  and  guide  project  implementation.  The  PSC  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  liaising  with\nrelevant  ministries  and  other  projects  to  develop,  propose,  and  implement  a  policy  agenda  to\nsupport  the  TVET  reform  process,  while  avoiding  investment  overlap,  to  create  effective\nlinkages and exchange of information and experience with other projects, and to ensure timely\ncompliance  with  the  loan  covenants,  including  allocation  and  disbursement  of  the  counterpart\nfunds; (ii) incorporating the emerging needs of beneficiaries and private sector employers in the\nTVET reform process under the Project; and (iii) monitoring implementation of the TVET reform\nagenda under the Project and investigating delays and adopting remedial measures. The PSC\nwill  have  broad  and  flexible  representation,  including  standing  members  and  observers.  The\nregular  members  comprise  the  Planning  Commission,  RCSC,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),\nNEB,  RTI,  ITCs,  the  Ministry  of  Trade  and  Industry  (MTI),  MOHE,  BCCI,  and  NWAB.  The\nchairperson will invite observers as necessary. NTTA will serve as secretariat to the committee.\nThe PSC will meet at least twice a year in accordance with the major implementation milestones\nas indicated in the project implementation schedule.\n\nThe  project  director  is  responsible  to  ADB  for  project  implementation  and  will  be  given\n71. \nauthority  to  implement  the  project  activities  according  to  the  agreed-upon  scope  and\narrangements.  The  project  director  will  appoint  project  staff  and  approve  procurement  and\nsubmission of withdrawal applications to the department of aid and debt management (DADM)\nof  MOF  for  its  approval  and  then  submission  to  ADB,  including  replenishment  of  the  imprest\nfund.\n\nPIU will be established in NTTA headquarters to implement the ADB-financed part of the\n72. \nProject.42  The  key  PIU  staff  will  be  a  project  manager,  a  disbursement  officer  (qualified\naccountant), a planning and administration assistant, and a procurement officer; all will be on a\nfull-time basis. The project manager will also engage individual consultants and administer their\ncontracts. These key PIU staff will be supported by contracted professional and supporting staff\nsuch  as  an  architect,  civil  works  engineers,  computer  and  network  technicians,  secretaries,\ndrivers,  and  other  support  and  professional  staff  as  needed  during  implementation.  ADB-\nfinanced civil works site supervisors will assist PIU to closely monitor the quality and progress of\ncivil works and installation of equipment and report their findings and recommendations to the\nproject  manager.  The  Government  will  bear  the  cost  for  all  PIU  staff,  both  government  and\ncontracted  staff.  Engaging  the  contracted  staff  will  follow  government  procedures  and\nexpenditure regulations. The project management and implementation structure is summarized\nin Appendix 8.\n\n3. \n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nThe Project will be implemented over five years starting in 2001 with (i) development of\n73. \npolicies and physical facilities followed by (ii) initial implementation and (iii) review and update\nactivities  to  fully  institutionalize  the  new  TVET  system  in  a  sustainable  manner.  A  draft\nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 9. The schedule takes into account the difficult physical\nenvironment, including the heavy rainy season in July-August and peak of winter in December-\nJanuary  when  landslides  or  deep  snow  close  the  roads,  and  the  rugged  mountainous  terrain\nthat makes access difficult.\n\n42  GTZ will arrange its own PIU.\n\n                  \n\n\f21\n\n4. \n\nProcurement of Goods and Services43\n\nAll  ADB-financed  goods  and  services  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\n74. \nGuidelines for Procurement. Contracts for purchase of equipment estimated to cost more than\n$100,000 but less than $500,000 will be international shopping (IS) procedures. All civil works\ncontracts  will  be  awarded  in  accordance  with  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB)  procedures  that\nhave been examined and found consistent with ADB\u2019s guidelines. For contracts to be awarded\non  the  basis  of  LCB,  the  bidding  documents  will  specify  eligibility  criteria  for  bidders.  Smaller\npurchases  of  off-the-shelf  items  estimated  at  or  less  than  $100,000  will  be  through  direct\npurchase  (DP)  procedures.  Each  procurement  contract  under  the  Project  will  be  financed\nexclusively  by  ADB  or  GTZ,  or  else  by  other  financiers  following  their  own  procedures  and\nprovisions.  Joint  financing  packages  will  not  be  allowed.  Appendix  10  lists  the  indicative\nprocurement packages.\n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services43\n\nThe  Project  will  utilize  about  169  person-months  of  individual  consultants:  121\n75. \ninternational  and  48  domestic.  ADB  will  finance  up  to  36  person-months  of  international\nconsultants  and  up  to  48  of  domestic  consultants.  GTZ  provision  is  estimated  at  about  85\nperson-months  international  consultants  at  appraisal.  The  international  consultants  will  be  a\nchief technical adviser, a chief implementation expert, a management expert, and other experts\nin  the  areas  of  vocational  qualifications  framework,  skills  standards,  certification  and  testing,\ntraining  program  accreditation,  apprenticeship  and  consignment  system, \nlabor  market\ninformation  system,  curriculum  and  training  package  design,  community  access  and  skills\ntraining  and  advocacy  and  publicity.    Domestic  consultants  will  be  computer  and  network\nengineers and civil works site supervisors. In consultation with the GTZ-financed chief technical\nadviser  and  ADB-financed  chief  implementation  expert,  the  project  director  will  coordinate  the\nconsulting services activities.\n\nAll ADB-financed consultants will be selected and engaged according to the latest ADB\n76. \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging\ndomestic consultants. Each consultant contract under the Project will be financed exclusively by\nADB or GTZ, or else by other financiers following their own procedures and provisions. No joint\nfinanced  contracts  will  be  allowed.  Appendix  11  gives  an  indicative  list  of  consultants  to  be\nengaged under the Project and the outline terms of references. Each consultant will be fielded\nas in Appendix 9.\n\n6. \n\nStaff Development\n\n  ADB  will  finance  about  40  person-months  of  international  fellowships  and  about  6\n77. \nperson-months of regional and subregional fellowships, while GTZ will provide trainers and staff\ntraining  of  about  70  person-months  equivalent.  The  international  fellowship  program  includes\ndegree  programs  for  NTTA  staff  to  strengthen  NTTA's  management  capacity  and  NEB\u2019s\ncapacity for labor market administration under components 1 and 2. The Government will enter\ninto a bonding arrangement with the participants in the fellowship programs. Candidates will be\n\n                  \n\n43(cid:2) The paragraphs are prepared based on the latest guidelines available at appraisal in March 2001. Provisions are\nsubject  to  change  and  those  included  in  the  latest  guidelines  at  the  time  of  actions  taken  will  always  prevail\nduring implementation.\n\n\f22\n\nselected  following  the  Government's  standard  procedures  and  subject  to  approval  by  ADB.\nDetails of the plan are in Appendix 12.\n\n7. \n\nDisbursements and Imprest Account44\n\nTo facilitate project implementation and ensure timely release of the loan proceeds, the\n78. \nGovernment will at the time of loan effectiveness open and maintain a separate account for the\nproject  imprest  account  (IA)  with  the  Royal  Monetary  Authority  of  Bhutan.  Statement  of\nexpenditure (SOE) procedures will apply in reimbursing and liquidating/replenishing IA covering\npayment  of  contracts  amounting  to  $100,000  or  less45.  After  the  initial  deposit,  the  IA  will  be\nsimultaneously liquidated and replenished on a regular basis. The amount to be deposited will\ndepend on anticipated expenditures to be incurred for a 3-6 month period and will not exceed 10\npercent of the loan amount. The imprest funds will be maintained as US dollars for necessary\nconversion  to  local  currency  only  at  the  time  of  payment.  All  disbursement,  including  the\nestablishment,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  the  IA  will  follow  the  latest  ADB  Loan\nDisbursement Handbook.\n\n8. \n\nReporting Requirements\n\nThe  PIU  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  progress  reports,  with  a  copy  to  the\n79. \nparallel  financier  in  a  format  agreed  upon  during  the  Loan  Inception  Mission-not  later  than  30\ndays after the end of each quarter. The reports will (i) examine progress by comparing progress\nin the period under review with the plan indicated in the last quarterly report; (ii) identify reasons\nfor delays and problems encountered, if any, during the period, and remedial actions taken or\nproposed  to  prevent  recurrence  or  to  resolve  problems;  (iii)  report  compliance  with  loan\ncovenants; and (iv) propose programs of activities and physical and financial progress expected\nduring the next three months, with detailed contract awards and disbursement projections.\n\nAt the end of the Project, the Government will prepare a project completion report (PCR)\n\n80. \nnot later than three months following physical completion of the Project.\n\n9. \n\nAccounts and Audit\n\n NTTA will establish and maintain consistent records and accounts adequate to identify\n81. \ngoods and services financed from the loan proceeds. The PIU will maintain all project accounts\nand  related  financial  statements  and  have  them  audited  each  year  in  accordance  with  sound\nauditing  standards  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audited  accounts  and  financial\nstatements and the auditor's report will be submitted to ADB within 12 months of the close of the\nfiscal year. Suitably qualified and trained accounting staff will be made available to assist NTTA\nin  maintaining  proper  project  accounts  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  annual  audit  will  cover  the  IA\nand SOE and a separate audit opinion on their use will be included in the annual audit report.\n\n                  \n\n44(cid:2) The  paragraph  was  prepared  based  on  the  latest  guidelines  available  at  appraisal  in  March  2001  (The  loan\ndisbursement  handbook  issued  at  January  2001).  Provisions  are  subject  to  change  and  those  included  in  the\nlatest guidelines at the time of actions taken will always prevail during implementation.\n\n45  Even  though  each  payment  is  less  than  $100,000,  if  the  payment  relates  to  a  contract  of  more  than  $100,000,\n\nSOE cannot be used. Therefore SOE under the Project applies on a contract basis, not on payment basis.\n\n\f23\n\n10. \n\nAnticorruption Measures\n\nThe Government was informed of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy, particularly the section on\n82. \nfraud and corruption, as stated in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Guidelines on the Use\nof Consultants.\n\n11.  Midterm Review\n\nThe Government and ADB will undertake a comprehensive midterm review (MTR) of the\n83. \nProject  during  the  third  year  of  implementation.  The  review  will  assess  the  progress  and\nachievements  of  the  Project  against  its  objectives,  identify  problems  encountered,  and\nrecommend remedial action, if needed. The Government, in consultation with the MTR mission\nleader, will prepare a MTR report including a midterm benefit monitoring and evaluation (BME)\nreport for submission to ADB with a copy to GTZ, at least 45 days before the fielding of the MTR\nmission. The Government will also invite representatives of GTZ so that the ADB MTR Mission\ncan undertake a joint review with GTZ delegates, if the schedule permits.\n\n12. \n\nBenefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n\nFor BME, the Project will introduce a management cycle involving the establishment of\n84. \nquantifiable targets with budgetary commitment at the beginning of each year, the activities to\nbe  implemented,  and  performance  evaluation  at  year-end.    In  target  setting,  NTTA  will\ndisaggregate  or  quantify  overall  project  targets  to  individual  institutes  and  staff  through  an\nannual process of consultation. The management cycle will be used to institutionalize timely and\neffective day-to-day activities throughout the institutes. NTTA will evaluate performance-output\nversus  budget-of  each  institute  and  key  staff/personnel  and  include  the  results  in  its  annual\nactivity report.\n\n  On  the  basis  of  this  management  cycle,  NTTA  will  achieve  the  anticipated  project\n85. \nbenefits by linking project targets to the performance of relevant staff and training institutes. The\ndetailed baseline data for evaluating the project achievement will be prepared and submitted to\nADB within three months of loan effectiveness on the basis of summary indicators in the project\nframework.  NTTA  will  fully  utilize  the  information  network  for  disseminating  the  information  on\nproject activities and achievement versus target figures to create healthy competition and rivalry\namong staff and institutes.\n\nF. \n\nExecuting Agency\n\nNTTA,  the  EA,  was  established  in  1999  as  a  national  coordinating  body  of  the  TVET\n86. \nsystem.  The  minister  of  health  and  education  is  the  chairman  of  NTTA.  Its  charter  mandates\nNTTA  to  (i)  plan,  develop,  and  coordinate  the  implementation  of  a  national  TVET  system;  (ii)\nformulate  policies,  and  plan,  coordinate,  and  undertake  all  activities  related  to  TVET;  (iii)\nregister,  authorize,  and  coordinate  all  TVET  programs  of  institutes,  agencies,  and  all  other\nTVET providers, including private training providers; (iv) promote and support TVET programs in\nthe  general  education  system;  (v)  develop  and  maintain  a  national  system  of  skill  standards,\ntesting  and  certification  of  skilled  workers;  and  (vi)  develop  partnerships  between  and  among\nindustry  and  TVET  providers.  With  the  strong  commitment  of  the  Government  and  the  Royal\nPatronage  of  the  Queen  of  Bhutan,  NTTA  has  been  active  and  has  developed  satisfactorily\nsince  its  inception  (Appendix  13).  Although  NTTA  is  a  new  agency,  many  of  its  staff  had\nprevious  experience  with  ADB-assisted  projects,  particularly  staff  from  MOHE,  who  was\nresponsible  for  implementing  the  Technical  and  Vocational  Education  and  Training  Project\n\n\f24\n\n(footnote  3)  completed  in  June  2000.  Despite  staff  constraints  during  the  peak  period  of\nimplementation, previous experience gives NTTA staff the capacity to implement the Project in a\ntimely manner. The chief implementation expert (CIE), an ADB-financed international individual\nconsultant,  will  assist  the  project  director,  project  manager  and  PIU  in  planning  and\nimplementing project activities during the peak period and give on-the-job training to staff.\n\nDuring  implementation,  PIU  staff  will  receive  training  in  and  out  of  the  country  and  will\n87. \ncarry out fieldwork at several project sites. To provide backup to the PIU, since one or more of\nits experienced staff will attend training overseas under the fellowships, ADB will finance a CIE\nfamiliar with ADB\u2019s project implementation procedures to assist the PIU for 17 person-months:\n15 for the start-up period and 2 before and during the MTR.\n\nG. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1. \n\nEnvironment\n\nThe  environmental  implications  of  the  Project  were  reviewed  and  no  adverse  impacts\n88. \nwere  identified.  The  Project  will  ensure  that  siting,  design,  construction,  rehabilitation,  and\noperation of the training institutes under the Project will follow the Government\u2019s environmental\nrequirements46,  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Guidelines  for  Selected  Infrastructure  Development\nProjects, and other relevant guidelines. Environmental monitoring of the Project will be reported\nthrough  the  quarterly  progress  reports  to  ADB.  In  the  course  of  curriculum  development,  the\nimportance  of  environmental  management  and  protection  will  be  emphasized  so  that  trainees\nunderstand  the  impact  of  industrial  growth  on  the  medium-  to  long-term  prospect  of  the\ncountry\u2019s environment.\n\n2. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement\n\n  The  Government  will  complete  land  acquisition  and  site  development  for  the  two  RTI\n89. \nextensions in Trashigang and Punakha, NDTI in Punakha, and CTC in Paro in accordance with\nits own procedures. For each project site, the Government will submit to ADB a site clearance\nreport prepared by designated autonomous agencies, certifying that (i) no resettlement will be\ninvolved;  (ii)  there  are  no  substantive  issues,  including  any  potential  adverse  impact  on\nvulnerable  groups;  (iii)  siting,  design,  construction,  rehabilitation,  and  operation  of  the  training\ninstitutes  under  the  Project  will  follow  the  Government\u2019s  environmental  requirements,  ADB\u2019s\nEnvironmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Development Projects, and other relevant\nguidelines; and (iv) an authenticated copy of the transfer of title in the English language will be\nsubmitted for ADB\u2019s approval before starting civil works under the loan. To ensure and confirm\nthe full and sustainable operation of the training institutes before the end of the loan utilization\nperiod,  the  Government  agreed  to  complete  all  land  acquisition  within  18  months  after  loan\neffectiveness.\n\n3. \n\nSocial Analysis\n\nGender  issues  in  Bhutan  are  unique.  Overt  discrimination  is  relatively  rare,  gender\n90. \ndisparities are comparatively narrow, and women are equal to men in many aspects. However,\nunfavorable  changes  in  the  gender  balance  have  occurred  in  the  course  of  the  country\u2019s\nmodernization  and  industrialization.  The  country\u2019s  rapid  growth  has  been  achieved  through\n\n                  \n46  Bhutan: Environment Policy 2000.\n\n\f25\n\nconstruction  work,  which  favors  male  employment.  Consequently,  the  TVET  system  has  been\naffected by the demand for skills training, which tends to favor men.\n\nPoverty in Bhutan does  not  take on the characteristics commonly found in South Asia.\n91. \nThe  Government\u2019s  liberal  and  generous  social  policies  have  helped  to  ensure  that  as  it\nmodernizes,  the  population  has  had  wide  and  equitable  access  to  social  services  including\nprovision  of  free  education  and  medical  services.  This  concept,  known  as  Gross  National\nHappiness in Bhutan, has been a factor in ensuring that poverty rates do not significantly grow\nor deepen as the country develops.\n\nThe  shift  from  a  traditional  to  an  industrial  economy  and  the  Government\u2019s  priority  on\n92. \nprivate sector development have precipitated some inequalities as mentioned in the document\nBhutan 2020: A Vision for Peace, Prosperity and Happiness (footnote  21),  which  stated  that\n\u201calthough reliable data are not available, evidence suggests that income disparities appear to be\non the increase.\u201d Signs of increasing unemployment, particularly among urban youth, show the\npotential risk of increasing income inequalities.\n\nin \n\nSocial  analysis  suggests  the  need  to  strengthen  human  development  to  improve\n93. \nequitable  participation \nincome  generation\nthe  country\u2019s  national  development  and \nopportunities.  The  Project  incorporates  specific  measures  to  extend  access  to  basic  skills\ndevelopment  opportunities  by  developing,  implementing,  and  monitoring  the  equitable  access\npromotion  policy  to  address  the  male-oriented  TVET  structure  and  poor  access  to  training  for\nrural  villagers,  particularly  women  in  rural  communities.  Under  the  policy,  the  Government  will\nintroduce  gender  considerations  in  developing  curriculum  and  training  packages  and  establish\nthe  CAU  to  introduce  outreach  programs.  The  Project  also  will  meet  industry  demands  for\nemployable  skills  by  developing  relevant  training  programs  based  on  the  national  vocational\nqualifications policy and skills standards.\n\n94. \n\nThe thematic classification of the Project is human development.\n\nV. \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA. \n\nEconomic Benefits and Project Sustainability\n\nThe country\u2019s main benefit from a redeveloped TVET will be the enhanced employability\n95. \nof educated youth, particularly women, in the private sector. Economic benefits will also accrue\nfrom  the  enhanced  productivity  and  competitiveness  of  Bhutanese  workers  and  the  beneficial\neffects of the Project on health and quality of life through better income opportunities. Extending\ntraining  facilities  to  rural  areas  will  benefit  those  who  did  not  have  access  to  skills  training,\nparticularly women. Systematic data for the relative earnings of workers in the enterprise sector\nare  not  available.  Nonquantifiable  long-run  indirect  benefits  will  primarily  be  improved  market-\nrelevant skills of Bhutanese workers.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  TVET  policies  that  NTTA  will  introduce  to  coordinate  training\n96. \nprovisions,  the  Government  will  (i)  introduce  policies  to  reform  TVET,  and  (ii)  encourage  the\nprivate sector to utilize the skills acquired by Bhutanese trainees and to participate in TVET. The\nProject  addresses  the  need  for  cost  sharing  through  several  measures:  consigning  training\nprogram  implementation  to  private  training  providers,  and  providing  on-demand  base  training\nprograms and apprenticeship programs. The Government will gradually introduce fees for social\nservices,  including  education.  NTTA  will  introduce  a  cost  accounting  system  and  start\n\n\f26\n\ndeveloping  a  training  fee  system.  The  Project  segregates  capital  and  recurrent  cost  items  to\nsupport financial sustainability upon completion of the Project. The Government agreed to fully\nfinance  the  recurrent  costs  throughout  project  implementation  to  avoid  any  financing  gap  in\noperating and maintaining the project facilities at the end of the loan utilization period (Appendix\n4).\n\nIPU  will  enable  direct  contact  with  employers  to  receive  feedback  and  identify  the\n97. \nneeded  training  programs  and  delivery  modes  and  to  disseminate  information  to  make  the\nTVET reform process transparent and accountable; LMIS will establish an objective and reliable\nmarket  information  system;  ITC  will  directly  capture  the  training  needs  of  employers;  the\nmanagement control to link the achievement of project targets with individual performance; and\nthe  location  of  new  training  institutes  that  provide  students  better  access  to  training  and\nemployment.  CAU  will  establish  outreach  activities  utilizing  the  road  and  electrification\ninfrastructure  recently  provided  under  ADB  assistance;  and  JPO  will  provide  career  guidance\nand  job  placement  services  for  private  sector  employment,  designed  appropriately  to  be\ncommensurate with the social context and absorptive capacity of the Government. The Project\nwill  assist  NTTA  to  strengthen  the  TVET  system  by  adding  necessary  policy  framework  and\nfacilities.\n\nThe  plans  for  the  new  training  institutes  will  promote  improved  cost-effectiveness  and\n98. \nsustainable operations. Previously the Government\u2019s in-house skills trainers viewed training as\na  matter  of  supplying  predetermined  allocations  of  workers  of  particular  skills  types,  trained  in\nthe traditional established general requirements of the user ministries and agencies. However,\nthat  function  and  principal  client  have  now  changed  and  long-term  survival  will  depend  on\nensuring graduate employment mainly in the private sector, by meeting the expressed training\nneeds of industries and their preferred training modalities (time, place, length and levels). This\nwill require rapidly establishing formal links with industry and redesigning programs to meet the\nindustry-determined national skills standards. To facilitate this change, the Project provides for a\nmanagement information system (MIS) and development of LMIS within NEB, and the gathering\nof system data on training and outcomes through longitudinal tracer studies of graduates. It also\nprovides  for  the  establishment  of  IPU  at  NTTA  to  provide  central  coordination  for  industry\nlinkages.\n\nUnder  component  2,  RTI  is  to  be  substantially  upgraded  and  expanded.  Since  RTI  is\n99. \nalready  well-established  with  basic  skills  training  infrastructure  and  trained  staff,  and  is  widely\nknown,  it  is  more  cost-effective  to  improve  its  capacity  to  be  the  core  and  base  of  NTTA\u2019s\nexpansion than to build that up from zero elsewhere. RTI\u2019s location at Phuentsholing, close to\nthe largest center of manufacturing and other industrial activity in the country, makes it a most\nappropriate  location  for  major  expansion  in  certified  basic  skills  training.  Due  to  the  high  land\ncost in Thimphu (about 30 times higher than in other regional centers), ARTC may be located\non  leased  premises  if  it  is  in  Thimphu.  Punakha  was  chosen  as  the  site  of  the  new  RTI\nextension campus and NDTI because (i) it is near Thimphu, (ii) it is the center of a wood-based\nindustry, and (iii) it has abundant suitable land and a climate that allows year-round operation of\nNTDI.  Paro  was  chosen  as  the  site  of  CTC  because  (i)  it  is  the  second  largest  center  around\nThimphu, and thus adds to a suitable distribution of training facilities throughout the region, and\n(ii) it is a major center of the building and construction industry. The other RTI extension campus\nis to be located in Trashigang in eastern Bhutan. Trashigang is an important emerging center of\nenterprise  activity,  and  equally  important,  is  one  of  the  most  densely  populated  parts  of  the\ncountry and as yet has no basic skills training facilities nearby, except at TIZC.\n\n\f27\n\nThe current unit cost of providing skills development training in the different institutes is\n100. \nbased on a pattern of instructor staffing and program provision, which is essentially a legacy of\nthe earlier \u201cgovernment training center\u201d role of RTI. NTTA is aware that the required reform will\nnecessitate greater operational and financial efficiency. It has been recommended that unit cost\ndata become a regular part of NTTA\u2019s MIS to allow use of systematic comparative analysis as a\nregular  tool  for  management.  Project  targets  are  predicated  on  the  staged  adoption  of  more\ncost-effective instructor-trainee ratios from the 2000 baseline ratio of 1:8 to 1:20 eventually.\n\nThe  Project  is  considered  financially,  economically,  and  institutionally  viable  and\n101. \nsustainable.  It  will  adopt  cost-effective  training  methodologies  and  appropriate  private  sector\nlinkages to ensure sustained demand for its training services.\n\nB.\n\nSocial Dimensions\n\nThe  Project  has  been  prepared  in  a  participatory  manner,  with  representatives  of\n102. \nrelevant government agencies, private enterprises, NGOs, major aid agencies such as GTZ and\nUNDP, male and female students and trainees, heads of training institutes and school teachers\nin  three  major  national  workshops,  consultations  with  communities  by  the  PPTA  consultants,\nand  extensive  field  investigations  and  site  visits  by  staff  during  the  PPTA  review.  The  PPTA\nconducted social surveys and an independent social analysis by an international social expert.\nThe PPTA also incorporated the findings from the recent ADB-financed poverty assessment and\nanalysis in Bhutan.47\n\nThe Project will benefit four client groups: (i) graduates of junior high and high schools;\n103. \n(ii) unemployed educated youth, particularly in urban areas; (iii) workers who need to improve\ntheir  skills  or  to  certify  their  skills  attainment  at  work  to  secure  continued  employment  and\nincome  improvement;  and  (iv)  rural  villagers  who  did  not  have  access  to  skills  training.  By\ndeveloping  relevant  training  modules  with  various  modalities  for  delivering  skills  training  to  its\nclient  groups,  the  Project  will  ensure  total  enrollment  in  formal  and  nonformal  skills  training  of\naround 1,500 annually or training for about 5,300 trainees by the end of the Project.\n\nIn  rural  areas,  CAU  will  cover  at  least  210  rural  villagers  annually  with  mobile  training\n104. \nprograms  to  improve  the  shortage  of  basic  skills  needed  for  day-to-day  maintenance  of\ncommunity  facilities  and  provide  income  generating  opportunities  to  the  villagers,  particularly\npoor  women.  Job  seekers  will  receive  employment  counseling  and  job  placement  services.\nConsidering  the  relatively  poor  status  of  gender  balance  in  TVET  enrollment,  the  Project\naddresses  the  need  to  enhance  the  availability  of  skills  training  for  women  through  diversified\ntraining  subjects,  female-friendly  facilities  such  as  toilets  and  girls  hostels;  training  in  gender\nsensitization training for planners, trainers, and employment and job placement counselors; and\npublicity work to attract more females to the training so that at least 30 percent of the total TVET\nenrollment  will  be  women  by  the  end  of  the  Project  without  imposition  of  an  artificial  female\nquota  that  often  adversely  affects  the  intended  benefits  to  the  participants  and  project\nsustainability.  Communities  in  rural  areas  will  be  encouraged  to  participate  in  the  training\nprogram,  not  only  for  general  skills  but  also  for  skills  geared  to  develop  special  community\nproducts  for  income  earnings.    NTTA,  being  aware  of  ongoing  and  planned  village  skills\ndevelopment  activities  by  other  agencies,  will  explore  the  linkages  and  coordination  through\nCAU to maximize physical coverage without duplicating investments.\n\n47  TA3443-BHU: Poverty Assessment and Analysis, for $100,000, approved on 19 May 2000.\n\n                  \n\n\fC.\n\nNTTA\u2019s Institutional Capacity\n\n28\n\nThe  current  institutional  capacity  for  TVET  is  weak  due  to  inadequate  policies,\n105. \ninsufficient management skills and staff; and lack of a demand-based training system, linkages\nwith the private sector, and capital to update the obsolete facilities in NTTA. The Project\u2019s input\nto policy development and management capacity will strengthen NTTA.\n\n106.  At the policy level, the Project will support the strengthening of the new TVET system by\nintroducing  four  key  TVET  policies:  the  national  vocational  qualifications  policy,  equitable\naccess  promotion  policy,  private  sector  partnership  policy,  and  cost  sharing  policy  to  provide\ndirection and rationale in decision making, training operations, and other activities to establish\nand operate the training system.\n\n107.  At  the  management  level,  before  the  start  of  the  Project,  an  introductory  management\ntraining  program  using  a  participatory  approach  will  be  implemented  under  the  ADTA.  The\nProject  will  promote  business  process  reengineering  within  NTTA  by  establishing  a\nmanagement cycle linking planning, implementation, and evaluation into an annual operational\ncycle  and  introducing  management  by  objectives,  a  model  that  is  widely  used  in  modern\ncompetitive  organizations.  NTTA  will  assign  operational  targets  with  appropriate  budgets  to\neach  staff  at  the  beginning  of  the  year.  Individual  targets  will  be  set  by  disaggregating  the\nannual  targets  of  the  Project.  With  this  system,  NTTA  will  link  overall  project  performance  to\nindividual  performance,  which  will  be  evaluated  at  year-end.  Together  with  appropriate  staff\ndevelopment  programs,  the  Project  will  strengthen  NTTA\u2019s  performance  by  integrating  the\nindividual work programs with the overall organizational goal.\n\nD.\n\nProject Risk\n\nTimely Implementation. The Project starts with (i) development of policies and physical\n108. \nfacilities followed by (ii) initial implementation and (iii) review and updates to fully institutionalize\nthe  new  TVET  system  in  a  sustainable  manner.  Therefore,  initial  delay  in  developing  and\nadopting new policies by the Government, or in civil works and installation of training equipment\nwill  affect  project  sustainability  because  it  will  reduce  the  time  to  fully  institutionalize  the  new\nTVET system.\n\nFor timely implementation of the policies and to manage the TVET reform process, the\n109. \nGovernment  agreed  to  start  policy  formulation  for  the  Project  under  the  ADTA,  which\ncommenced in April 2001 for five months. A task force, including representatives of concerned\nministries  and  private  sector  industries  (to  prepare  policy  recommendations  under  the  ADTA),\nwill become the PSC to ensure the continuity of the policy formulation process. In assisting with\npolicy formulation and preparation of a sector plan to incorporate in the 9FYP, the ADTA also\naims  at  developing  NTTA\u2019s  capacity  for  interministerial  coordination  in  formulating  and\nimplementing several policies to be developed under the Project. The management component\nof the ADTA will strengthen NTTA\u2019s capacity for managing the proposed institutional reform. To\nassist in physical implementation-civil works and procuring and installing equipment-the Project\nwill  utilize  (i)  an  international  consultant  as  chief  implementation  expert  to  assist  PIU  in  civil\nworks,  procurement  planning  and  contract  awards,  and  key  day-to-day  tasks;  and  (ii)\nindependent  civil  works  site  supervisors  to  closely  monitor  and  follow  up  progress  and\ninstallation and testing of equipment on site. The key ADB consultants including a management\nexpert,  chief  implementation  expert,  industry  liaison  and  publicity  expert,  and  job  placement\nexpert will be fielded intermittently to support the institutionalization process as indicated in the\nimplementation schedule (Appendix 9).\n\n\f29\n\n110.  Demand for Skilled Labor. Sustained growth of the private sector with rising demand\nfor trained labor is one of the important assumptions for the success of the Project. Although the\nProject will provide skills to Bhutanese with career aspirations for working in the private sector, if\nlabor demand shrinks due to insufficient growth of the private sector, the Project\u2019s development\nimpact and sustainability will be weakened.\n\nThe COS indicates the shortage of skilled Bhutanese as one of the five constraints to the\n111. \ngrowth of the private sector, and hence the economic growth of Bhutan. To avoid the future risk\nof  insufficient  demand  for  skilled  workers,  ADB  should  promote  concerted  efforts  and  policy\ndialogue with the Government in various sectors to promote the economic growth of the country\nincluding  support  to  (i)  improve  policy  setting  and  financial  intermediation;  (ii)  improve  road\ntransport and power supply; and (iii) strengthen vocational, technical, and basic skills during the\nproject implementation period as indicated in ADB\u2019s country assistance plan for 2001-2003.\n\nTo  effectively  cope  with  the  emerging  needs  from  the  growing  private  sector,  the  new\n112. \nTVET  system  should  have  management  that  effectively  responds  to  the  changing  operational\nenvironment. To ensure efficacy and efficiency of the TVET system, the Project will strengthen\nmanagement by (i) providing modern managerial skills and control system; (ii) institutionalizing\nworking linkages with private enterprises, including setting up such organizations as ITCs and\nIPU  and  promoting  private  sector  participation  in  training  by  apprenticeship  and  the  training\nconsignment  system;  and  (iii)  developing  a  reliable  labor  market  monitoring  and  assessment\nsystem.  Mechanisms  to  enhance  private  sector  participation  in  the  new  TVET  system  are\nsummarized in Appendix 14.\n\n113.  Demand  for  Training  by  Educated  Youth.  The  attitude  of  the  educated  Bhutanese\ntoward  both  a  public  sector  career  and  private  sector  employment  is  changing.  Due  to  the\nlimited prospects of  (i) being recruited into the public service due to the Government policy to\nlimit the size of the civil service, and (ii) finding suitable employment in the industry sector due to\nlack of employable skills, Bhutanese youth are already seeking basic skills training. To further\npromote the change in attitude, the Government in the mid-1990s established NEB to assist in\njob  placements  in  the  private  sector,  and  introduced  work  value  education  throughout  the\ngeneral education system. In support of the proposed new Government policies, an IPU will be\nestablished  in  NTTA  under  the  Project  to  implement  the  school-industry  exchange  programs\nand  several  publicity  works  by  organizing  workshops  and  utilizing  newspaper,  radio,  and\ntelevision  programs,  web  and  e-mails,  and  other  media;  and  JPO  in  NEB  to  offer  career\nguidance  and  job  placement  services  for  employment  in  the  private  sector.  To  promote  work\nvalue education at the school level, the Project will also strengthen vocational center facilities in\nsecondary schools nationwide.\n\n114.  Other Demand-Related Risks. In addition to these demand-side risks (para. 110-113),\nother  risks  for  project  sustainability  exist:  the  inflexibility  of  the  training  provided,  and  the\nchanging  demands  of  the  private  sector  as  it  develops  and  progresses  towards  a  modern\nindustrial economy (policy risk), or the capital requirements necessary to replace equipment due\nto  changing  demand  (capital  risk).  It  is  crucial  that  the  training  system  develop  the  ability  to\nquickly  adapt  and  evolve  with  the  changing  requirements  of  industry.  This  requires  strong\nlinkages  with  the  private  sector.  To  institutionalize  private  sector  linkages,  the  Project  will\nestablish  four  key  TVET  policies  including  the  private  sector  partnership  policy  at  the  outset.\nThe  capital-intensive  nature  of  TVET  has  been  deemed  an  inherent  weakness  of  the  TVET\nsystem. The Project will challenge this risk by introducing innovative cost sharing schemes such\nas consigning training operations to private sector institutes by contract. Under the consignment\nsystem, NTTA will develop training programs and, if necessary, procure training equipment for\n\n\f30\n\nrent,  while  the  contracted  private  training  institutes  will  use  their  own  premises  to  conduct\ntraining using the programs and equipment rented from NTTA.\n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES\n\nA.\n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\n\n115. \nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n(i) \n\nWithin two months of loan effectiveness, the Government will establish a project\nsteering committee (PSC), with a composition similar to the interministerial task\nforce  under  the  ADTA.  The  PSC  will  be  chaired  by  the  director  of  NTTA,  and\nNTTA will serve as the secretariat to the committee.\n\n(ii)  Within  six  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  allocate  all\nnecessary  staff  to  the  key  project  units  including  (a)  one  staff  for  IPU;  (b)  one\ncoordinator, three regular staff, and one support staff for STRU in NTTA; and (c)\none regular staff and one support staff for LMIS in NEB.\n\n(iii)  Within  six  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Borrower  shall  confirm  all\nnominations  of  industry  sectors  for  organizing  ITCs  as  well  as  the  effective\nappointment  of  members  for  at  least  four  ITCs.  Within  eighteen  months  of  loan\neffectiveness, the Borrower shall confirm the appointment of the members of the\nremaining ITCs.\n\n(iv) \n\nThe  Government  will  adopt  all  appropriate  and  necessary  measures  to  allocate\nsufficient resources to cover the entire recurrent cost of all project activities.\n\n(v)  Within  12  months  of \n\nloan  effectiveness,  NTTA  will,  based  on \n\nthe\nrecommendations  resulting  from  the  ADTA,  prepare  and  approve  four  basic\npolicies aimed at institutionalizing the new TVET system, namely: (a) a national\nvocational  qualifications  policy;  (b)  an  equitable  access  promotion  policy;  (c)  a\nprivate sector partnership policy; and (d) a cost sharing policy.\n\n(vi)  Within  12  months  of \n\nloan  effectiveness,  NTTA  will,  based  on \n\nthe\nrecommendations  resulting  from  the  ADTA,  formulate  recommendations  for  an\ninterministerial  policy  framework  to  support  its  own  TVET  policies.  This  will\ninclude  the  following:  (a)  an  overall  labor  administration  policy,  including  inputs\nfor  an  Employment  Act  and  implementing  regulations  for  secure  working\nconditions  in  the  private  sector  (NEB);  (b)  a  skills  utilization  policy  including\nintroduction  of  skills  utilization  promotion  budgets  attached  to  NTTA  and  NEB,\nand  measures  to  encourage  employers  to  recruit  from  training  institutes  and  to\npromote  consignment  of  training  programs  and  skills  testing  (MOF);  (c)  the\npromotion  of  linkages  between  schools  and  industries  (MOHE);  and  (d)  an\nindustrial policy and incorporation of the national vocational qualifications system\nin the business licensing system (MTI, Planning Commission).\n\n\f31\n\n(vii) \n\nAnnually  NTTA  will  review  and  update  management  systems  of  NTTA  and  its\ntraining institutes. The diagnostic analysis and proposed actions for improvement\nwill be included in the succeeding quarterly progress report.\n\n(viii)  The Government will take all appropriate and necessary measures to ensure an\noverall  female  enrollment  ratio  of  at  least  30  percent  in  its  skills  training\nprograms, without resorting to a quota system.\n\n(ix)  Within  12  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  inform  ADB  of  the\nfinal approval of the sites where two RTI extensions, NDTI, CTC, and ARTC will\nbe  located.  Within  18  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will\ncomplete  land  acquisition  or  lease  arrangements  for  all  building  extensions  and\nconstruction of the five institutes under the Project and will hand the titles over to\nNTTA.  The  Government  will  submit  to  ADB  a  site  clearance  report  for  each\nproject  site,  certifying  among  others  that  no  resettlement  of  people,  including\nsquatters  is  involved.
