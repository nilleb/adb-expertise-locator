The Project will (i) reform the current technical\nand vocational education and training (TVET) system; (ii)\nstrengthen the Government\u2019s capacity for policy making,\nplanning,  management,  and  administration  of  skills\ntraining;  (iii)  promote  more  equitable  access  to  skills\ntraining,  particularly  for  people  living  in  rural  areas,\nwomen and the poor, who did not have access to such\ntraining; (iv) improve the quality and increase the quantity\nof  basic  skills  training,  and  develop  quality  support\nsystems and adequate facilities, equipment, trainers, and\nmaterials; (v) promote effective use of basic skills through\nenhanced  relevance  of  skills  training,  positive  values\ntoward  skills  and  manual  work,  and  career  guidance,\ncounselling, and employment placement services.\nClassification Thematic: Human development\nEnvironmental Category  C.  Environmental  implications  were  reviewed\nAssessment and no significant adverse environmental impacts were\nidentified.\nRationale Since  1981,  Bhutan  has  experienced  robust  economic\ngrowth and has diversified from a traditional subsistence\neconomy to a modern market economy. Economic growth\nhas been accompanied by significant growth in modern\nsector  employment,  particularly  in  construction,\nmanufacturing,  and  business  services.  Lacking\nemployable skills, the Bhutanese have been unable to\ntake advantage of these employment opportunities. If the\nsituation continues, Bhutan will be unable to fully utilize its\ndomestic  human  resources  to  promote  national\ndevelopment,  and  social  problems  associated  with  the\ngrowing pool of unemployed urban youth will increase.\nThe Government plans to upgrade the TVET system by\nimproving the policy framework; upgrading the quality and\nrelevance of training; expanding access, particularly for\nwomen and the rural villagers; and improving the system's\nlinkages with the private sector.\nObjective and The objective of the Project is to improve the quality and\nScope relevance  of  TVET  in  Bhutan  to  provide  training  in\nemployable skills to new school graduates, unemployed\nyouth,  domestic  laborers,  women,  and  people  living  in", "iii\nrural  areas;  and  to  expand  the  capacity  of  training\nproviders to meet the private sector\u2019s increasing demand\nfor skilled human resources.\nTo achieve this objective, the Project will (i) strengthen\ninstitutional capacity to ensure that the delivery of basic\nskills  training  is  relevant  to  market  needs  and\ncommensurate  with  the  capacity  of  beneficiaries,  (ii)\nincrease access to basic skills training by expanding the\nTVET  system  and  rehabilitating  existing  facilities  and\nestablishing new ones, (iii) improve the quality of basic\nskills training by increasing links with the private sector,\nand (iv) promote effective use of basic skills by developing\nemployment guidance and job placement services.\nCost Estimates The total cost of the Project, inclusive of taxes, duties,\nand  other  charges,  is  estimated  at  $12.5  million\nequivalent,  including  a  foreign  exchange  cost  of  $6.8\nmillion (55 percent) and a local currency cost equivalent\nof $5.7 million (45 percent).\nFinancing Plan It is proposed that the Project be financed by the Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and the Royal Government of\nBhutan  in  parallel  with  the  Government  of  Germany\nthrough the German Agency for Technical Cooperation\n(GTZ). ADB will provide a loan of $7.00 million equivalent\n(56  percent);  the  Royal  Government  of  Bhutan,  $3.0\nmillion equivalent (24 percent); and the Government of\nGermany,  DM5  million  (approximately  $2.5  million\nequivalent, 20 percent).\nLoan Amount The equivalent in various currencies of SDR 5,556,000\nand Terms ($7.0  million  equivalent)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds\nresources,  with  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace\nperiod of 8 years, and interest charge of 1 percent per\nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  per\nannum thereafter.\nPeriod of Utilization 31 March 2007\nExecuting Agency National Technical Training Authority (NTTA)\nImplementation A project implementation unit will be established within\nArrangements NTTA for implementing the Project.\nProcurement All procurement financed by the loan will be carried out in\naccordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for  Procurement,\nincluding the ADB\u2019s standard bidding documents.\nTraining The loan will provide 40 person-months of international\nfellowships and 6 of regional and subregional training. In\naddition,  up  to  70  person-months  of  skills  upgrading", "iv\ntraining  for  instructors  will  be  provided  through  GTZ\nassistance.\nConsulting About 121 person-months of individual international and\nServices 48  individual  domestic  consulting  services  will  be\nprovided.

The Royal Government of the Kingdom of Bhutan established skills training institutes as\npart  of  its  program  to  modernize  the  education  system  in  the  early  1960s.  The  Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) has provided assistance since the mid-1980s to the technical and\nvocational education and training (TVET) sector in, for example, establishing the Royal Institute\nof Management2 and expanding the Royal Bhutan Polytechnic to improve the quality of training\nand double the intake capacity.3 Following ADB-initiated policy dialogue in the 1990s, the\nGovernment embarked on reform of the TVET sector to meet the needs of an economy in\ntransition  to  a  modern,  private-sector-led  market  economy,  and  established  the  National\nTechnical Training Authority (NTTA) in 1999, as recommended in ADB technical assistance.4\nDuring  the  initial  operation  of  NTTA,  the  Government  recognized  the  urgent  need  for\nemployment-oriented skills training at the basic level and requested ADB financial assistance to\nprepare the Basic Skills Development Project. The project preparatory technical assistance\n(PPTA) was approved in December 1999 and implemented between June and December 2000.\nThe Fact-Finding Mission from 8 to 19 January 2001 and the Appraisal Mission5 from 15 March\nto 2 April 2001 visited Bhutan to formulate the Project on the basis of consultations on the\nproject feasibility report with NTTA and other Government agencies, representatives of the\nbeneficiaries (parents, students, and future employers), nongovernment organizations (NGOs),\nand international aid agencies, as well as extensive site visits by staff during the PPTA review.\nThe project framework is in Appendix 1.\nIII.  BACKGROUND\nA.  Sector Description\n1.  Education System6\n3.  The formal education system (Appendix 2) comprises one year preprimary school, six\nyears primary school (grades 1-6) including community school (preprimary and grades 1-6), two\nyears junior high school (grades 7 and 8), two years high school (grades 9 and 10), two years\n                  \n1  Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ).\n2  TA 564-BHU: Royal Institute of Management, for $45,000, approved on 7 December 1983 and Loan 722-BHU(SF):\nSecond Multiproject Loan, for $7.4 million, approved on 13 December 1984.\n(cid:1)(cid:2)Loan 1035-BHU(SF): Technical and Vocational Education and Training Project, for $7.13 million, approved on 27\nSeptember 1990.\n4  TA  1381-BHU:  Institutional Improvements in Technical and Vocational Education and Training Project,  for\n$750,000, approved on 27 September 1990.\n5  The Mission comprised Y.

Ho, Programs Officer assisted the Mission.\n6  TA3464-BHU: Basic Skills Development Project, Final Report, December 2000, Appendix 13 (Report on the Job\nAttitudes of Students and their Teachers, July-August 2000); and STS: BHU 2000-02: Country Operational\nStrategy, Bhutan, October 2000, para. 25 - 26.", "2\njunior college (grades 11 and 12), and three years degree college. English is the medium of\ninstruction.\n4.  In the 1950s, fewer than 450 children attended secular primary schools, and there were\nno secondary schools. In 1961, the First Five-Year Plan (1FYP) initiated a comprehensive\neducation  system  for  the  country.  Since  then,  enrollments  at  all  levels  have  grown  at  an\nimpressive rate as a result of the Government\u2019s commitment to develop the education sector.\nBetween 1984 and 1996, the adult literacy rate increased from 28 percent to 54 percent, and\nthe primary school gross enrollment rate (grades 1-6) rose from only 12 percent in 1980 to 72\npercent in 1996. The Government is targeting a 95 percent enrollment rate in primary schools\nunder the 8FYP (1997-2002), and full enrollment at junior high school (grade 8) by 2007, at the\nend of the 9FYP. In 1999, over 107,000 students were enrolled in the general education system\nconsisting of 254 primary and community schools, 51 junior high schools, 21 high schools, 7\nprivate schools, and 10 other institutions providing specialized education as well as tertiary and\nvocational  training.  Since  1997,  the  number  of  teachers  has  trebled  and  the  number  of\neducational establishments has doubled. Throughout this development, the education sector\nhas aimed to improve the gender balance. Currently, the ratios in favor of boys are about 55:45\nin primary schools, 53:47 in junior high schools, 57:43 in high schools, and 52:48 in private\nschools.7 In 1996, the female primary school enrollment rate was about 60 percent.\n5.  The Department of Education (DOE) of the Ministry of Health and Education (MOHE),\nadministers Bhutan\u2019s current general educational system. While DOE directly administers higher\neducation, direct financial and administrative responsibility for primary and secondary schools\nhas been devolved to the dzongkhag (district) administrations. Formal schooling begins at the\nage of six and is offered free of charge up to the tertiary level (except in seven private schools).\nIn the public schools system, the Government provides textbooks and, in some places, boarding\nfacilities and meals. Rural primary and junior high school students also receive free stationery.\nCommunities  in  rural  areas  contribute  labor  for  building  and  maintaining  their  schools.\nNotwithstanding the contribution by individuals/families, the Government bears over 90 percent\nof the recurrent costs of all schools, and 80 percent of the capital costs of primary schools and\n100 percent of secondary schools.8\n6.  Due to the increasing need to meet the critical shortage of secondary school facilities\nand competent teachers as a result of the almost full primary school enrollment by 2002, the\nGovernment recognizes that it cannot continue to support a free education system for all.\nConsequently, the establishment of private schools is being encouraged as more families are\nable to afford the cost of educating their children. The Government is aware that development of\nprivate schools should not lead to a decline in the quality of public schools. The introduction of\nmore  cost  sharing  by  beneficiaries  in  addition  to  the  conventional  community  contribution,\nparticularly  at  the  post  junior  high  school  levels,  will  show  the  direction  to  cost  recovery\nmeasures for a new TVET system. The much higher cost per capita of TVET, compared with\nthat of general education, indicates the importance of developing a cost recovery mechanism for\nvarious training activities. Upon completion of junior high school, students, depending on their\nperformance, can proceed to high school or to a skills training institute such as the Royal\nTechnical  Institute,  which  offers  three  to  four  years  training.  Subject  to  their  academic\nperformance, high school graduates can choose the Royal Bhutan Polytechnic, a junior college,\na teacher training college, or other higher education institutes.\n                  \n7  STS: BHU 2000-02: Country Operational Strategy, Bhutan, October 2000, para. 37.\n8  Annual Statistical Report, 1999. Education in Bhutan, p. 38.", "3\n2.  Technical and Vocational Education and Training System\n7.  The  Government  established  NTTA  in  May  1999  to  coordinate  the  national  TVET\nsystem. The objectives of NTTA are to effectively respond to the acute need to create an\nemployable indigenous labor force, and to reform the TVET sector to create a private-sector-\noriented  TVET  system  in  Bhutan.  To  complement  the  reform  of  the  TVET  sector,  the\nGovernment also established the National Employment Board (NEB) in March 2000 with the\nmandate of regulating and administering the labor market. The mandate includes preparing\nlabor legislation, providing employment services, supervising labor relations and doing labor\nmarket research.\n8.  Before the establishment of NTTA, the Technical and Vocational Education Section\nunder DOE coordinated the training programs. The relatively large capacity of the public sector\nto absorb all employment in the past\u2014which partly explains the current aspirations of educated\nyouth to become civil servants, and the underdevelopment of the private sector-served the\npurpose of the conventional TVET system to prepare students for a career in the public sector\nagencies.  Consequently,  the  Royal  Civil  Service  Commission  (RCSC)  administered  job\nplacements for the public sector agencies, but there was no agency to facilitate private sector\nemployment. There was also no central agency to coordinate a national TVET system, involving\nthe formulation and planning of a skills development policy, skills standardization, testing and\ncertification,  and  training  program  accreditation.  Despite  the  Government  commitment  to\ndevelop the private sector, lack of these capabilities constrains the promotion of private training\ninstitutes in the TVET sector or in-house staff development programs run by individual private\nenterprises.\n9.  NTTA,  in  collaboration  with  NEB  and  other  ministries  concerned,  is  mandated  to\nestablish  an  employment-oriented  TVET  system.  NTTA  needs  to  (i)  formulate  skills\ndevelopment and utilization policies and frameworks; (ii) replace outdated training programs that\nhave  little  relevance  to  the  emerging  labor  market  needs;  (iii)  improve  access  to  training\nprograms, particularly for women and the poor in rural areas; and (iv) provide access to skills\ntesting/certification for workers who wish to certify their skills attainment. There is also an urgent\nneed to coordinate and strengthen the employment counseling services for school graduates or\njob placement services, which are currently handled by MOHE as well as by NEB and are\nrelatively  weak  compared  with  similar  services  provided  by  the  RCSC  for  public  sector\nemployment.\n10.  The institutional capacity of NTTA and NEB is still inadequate to properly follow the\nabove mandates and better serve their priority clientele, comprising school graduates (grade 8\nand  above),  existing  workers,  and  private  sector  employers  who  will  pay  for  the  trained\nBhutanese youth under the new TVET system. An institutional diagnostic analysis made by the\nPPTA9 indicated the (i) lack of coherent TVET policies and associated employment policies,\nqualified staff, skills, and management system to develop and administer the employment-\noriented skills training system, and mechanisms to maintain linkages with the private sector and\nto deliver the training programs through various modalities; (ii) outdated and insufficient facilities\nin the existing training institutes; (iii) weak interministerial coordination to institutionalize the\nTVET system as part of the national human resource development framework; and (iv) lack of\n                  \n9  TA3464-BHU: Basic Skills Development Project, Final Report, December 2000, Appendix 14 and 15 (Institutional\nDiagnostic Analysis of the National Technical Training Authority and its TVET Institutions, July-August 2000, and\nTraining Needs Assessment, July-August 2000).", "4\ncapital necessary to develop new training programs and facilities. Moreover, in the case of NEB,\nthere is a need to develop a legal framework to support its mandate.\n11.  NTTA inherited five skills training institutes, including (i) the Royal Technical Institute\n(RTI),10 which has been training young people since 1986 to be skilled tradesmen and trades\nsupervisors, most of whom worked for the Government services. Almost all training was for\nformal four-year certificate level; skilled trades courses (comprising 60 percent practical and 40\npercent  theoretical  training)  in  electrical,  mechanical,  and  automotive  engineering,  building\nconstruction, and drafting; entry level was normally after graduating from junior high school at\ngrade 8; (ii) the Royal Bhutan Polytechnic (RBP), which has provided, since 1974, a three-year\ndiploma course for students graduating from high school at grade 10; (iii) the National Drivers\nTraining Institute (NDTI), which has provided, since 1989, a one-year program in vehicle driving\nand basic maintenance; most of the trainees obtained employment with government agencies;\n(iv) the National Institute for Zorig Chusum (NIZC), which has provided, since 1971, 3- to 5-year\ncourses on traditional arts and craft skills, including basic education subjects for those aged 14\nand above and who have completed primary school; and (v) the Trashiyangtse Institute for Zorig\nChusum (TIZC),11 which has provided, since 1997, similar courses on traditional arts and craft\nskills and, depending on the required skills, two-year advanced courses. The RTI is the most\nrelevant institute for basic skills development because of its location in Kharbandi near the\nindustrial sites and its relatively wider training curriculum.\n12.  The site of these institutes was determined mainly on the basis of their access to (i)\nindustry and the teaching faculty (RTI and RBP), (ii) the market (NIZC), and (iii) raw materials\n(TIZC).  Unfortunately,  the  location  was  not  always  convenient  to  students,  particularly  for\nfemales  in  rural  areas.  However,  with  the  development  of  new  infrastructure  in  the  rural\nelectrification,12 telecommunication, and road sectors,13 new business opportunities will open up\nto provide greater access to the training institutes and improve social services for villagers. The\nPPTA recommended that the TVET system be expanded by providing regional training hubs\nand mobile training teams capable of reaching local communities in rural areas. The reform of\nNDTI, another PPTA recommendation, is important because the improved road networks are\ngenerating demand for drivers due to the unprecedented growth in industry and for the self-\nemployed businesses in domestic transport, and freight - handling and distribution.\n13.  The  Government  has  piloted  various  modalities  for  delivering  skills  training.  One\nmodality is the village skills development programs that already cover 700 villagers through\nnonformal training programs comprising not only commonly required skills such as plumbing,\ncarpentry,  and  mechanical  repairs,  but  also  village-specific  skills  to  enhance  the\ncompetitiveness of products in the local communities.\n14.  Other public institutions under various ministries and agencies offer in-country training\nopportunities, including the Royal Institute of Management, the National Institute of Traditional\nMedicine, the Bhutan Forestry Institute in Thimphu, and the Natural Resource Training Institute.\nThe Ministry of Agriculture, Department of Tourism, and other ministries also offer short-term\nbasic skills training courses mostly for their staff. The National Women\u2019s Association of Bhutan\n(NWAB), established in 1981, provides nonformal training for skills development associated with\nmicrocredit schemes. NWAB also established several small-scale training centers for weaving\n                  \n10  RTI was originally founded as Don Bosco Technical School. It was taken over by the Government in 1982 and\nstarted as RTI in 1986.\n11  Formerly Rigney Institute in Trashiyangtse.\n12  Loan 1712-BHU(SF): Sustainable Rural Electrification Project, for $10 million, approved on 25 November 1999.\n13  Loan 1763-BHU(SF): Road Improvement Project, for $9.6 million, approved on 3 October 2000.", "5\nand  handicraft  production  for  rural  women,  in  collaboration  with  the  Government  and\ninternational aid agencies such as United Nations International Children\u2019s Emergency Fund\n(UNICEF). There is an urgent need for NTTA to coordinate with the concerned ministries and\norganizations, to establish a national vocational qualification framework, skill standards, and a\ncertificate and program accreditation system.\n15.  The private sector has only recently participated in TVET. Before the formulation of the\nprivatization and private sector development policy in 1997, there were no private sector training\ninstitutes in Bhutan. With Government promotion and encouragement, several private sector\ntraining  institutes  were  established  during  the  last  four  years,  mainly  in  Thimphu  and\nPhuentsholing. In Thimphu, the Visual Institute of Technology (VIT) and Info Tech Solutions\n(ITS) started providing information technology (IT) training in early 2000, and Kesang Driving\nSchool (KDS) was established in late 1999. In Phuentsholing, the Computer Management\nInstitute (CMI) and Druk Infotech were established in 1999. There is also one handicrafts\ninstitute in Thimphu giving short-term training in traditional arts and crafts programs for workers\nin  small  souvenir  business  stores.  The  PPTA  recommended  that  NTTA  create  business\nopportunities for private training institutes by consigning training to accredited private institutes\ninstead  of  providing  subsidies,  or  investing  in  NTTA  facilities  that  may  duplicate  training\nactivities  by  the  private  sector.  The  program  accreditation  and  consignment  policy\ncomplemented by support in the form of start-up capital and other incentives will create a cost-\neffective and market-relevant training system through the growth of private training institutes.\n16.  To decide the most cost-effective approach to establish a strategic location for a TVET\nreform center, the PPTA evaluated options, such as renovating the existing NTTA headquarters\nbuilding or one of its training institutes, or constructing a new headquarters building. For its\naccess to industry and the commercial zone, RTI was chosen for the reform center where major\ntechnical functions such as training in package design, industry liaison, and training delivery will\nbe established. NTTA will be in charge of developing policies, and implementing and monitoring\nthe reform program.\n3.  Demand for Skills Training14\n17.  Since  the  early  1960s,  Bhutan  has  implemented  policies  to  shift  from  a  traditional\neconomy to a modern, market-based economy. In the last two decades, Bhutan's economy\ngrew in real terms at the annual rate of 8.0 percent in the later part of the 1980s, 5.6 percent\nfrom  1991  to  1995,  and  6.0  percent  from  1996  to  1999,  due  to  industrialization  and\ndiversification of its economic activities. Agriculture declined from a share of 53 percent of the\ngross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  1981  to  37  percent  in  1998;  and  industry,  led  by\nmanufacturing, electricity, and construction, increased from 17 percent in 1981 to more than 35\npercent in 1998. Since the second half of the 1980s, private sector development was a priority\nof the Government and major State-owned enterprises were privatized. The buoyant growth of\nthe industry sector in the 1980s and 1990s created increasing demand for modern skilled and\nsemiskilled  workers.  Although  the  Government  had  given  high  priority  to  human  resource\ndevelopment, particularly in the general education sector to support its modernization program,\ndomestic skilled human resources were not well-developed. To meet the rapidly increasing\ndemand from the industry sector, the Government resorted to the large pool of migrant workers\nfrom neighboring countries to fill the vacancies of skilled, semiskilled, and unskilled workers.\n                  \n14  TA3464-BHU: Basic Skills Development Project, Final Report, December 2000, Appendix 11 (Survey Report on\nthe Employment Patterns and Job Opportunities Survey, July-August 2000).", "6\n18.  The PPTA survey indicated that about 50,000 expatriate workers already occupy skilled\nand semiskilled jobs. With the Government\u2019s continued emphasis on private sector development\nunder the 8FYP (1997-2002) and 9FYP (2003-2007), about 3,500 new jobs are forecast to be\ncreated  each  year  in  the  industry  sector  in  the  foreseeable  future.  The  magnitude  of  the\npotential job opportunities for Bhutanese workers is apparent. If the pace of economic growth\nand industrialization continues without the participation of educated Bhutanese in the workforce,\nthe country will face a major dilemma of unemployment and underemployment in the near\nfuture. Already, signs show increasing urban unemployment. Development of human resources,\nparticularly employable skills, is therefore a priority national issue.15 However, the country still\nlacks the relevant training facilities, labor administration system for private sector employment,\nand an effective labor market monitoring system. Lack of reliable statistics makes it difficult to\nassess the domestic labor market.\n19.  Based on  Bhutan's  official  population  estimate  of  638,000  in  1998,  the  labor  force\ncomprised about 54 percent (345,000) at age 15-59 and about 42 percent (268,000) below age\n15. Both sexes in the category below age 15 have access to basic education. Primary education\nenrollments in 1996 were 72 percent and are steadily increasing to 95 percent, the current\ntarget under the 8FYP (1997-2002). As a result, about 4,200 students from grades 8-10 are\nexpected to graduate in 2001.16\n20.  Despite the increasing number of educated youth coming into the labor market, it will\ntake time to improve the employability of graduates in the areas of traditional and modern skills,\nparticularly  in  the  service,  maintenance,  small-  and  medium-scale  manufacturing,  and\nconstruction  sectors.  This  is  mainly  because  private  sector  employers  do  not  believe  the\ngraduates have adequate qualifications, including practical skills and job-related experience.17\nMoreover, despite signs of change due to the difficulties in getting jobs, graduates have been\nreluctant to join the private sector due to their traditional career preference for a high-status,\nwhite-collar occupation in the public sector. This mismatch of expectations between employers\nand job seekers has been further aggravated by the relatively less attractive working conditions\nin the private sector than in the public sector and the different salary structures. The public\nsector has a relatively flat salary structure, whereas the private sector has entry-level salaries\nthat are much lower initially but have greater potential for growth depending on individual\nperformance.\n21.  Due to the difference in expectations between job seekers and employers, the influx of\neducated youth onto the labor market is already resulting in urban youth unemployment and\nunfilled vacancies in the private sector. The PPTA report on employment patterns and job\nopportunities in July-August 2000 indicated that, of about 53,000 positions that could be suitably\nfilled by grade 8 and 10 graduates, 4,800 in various occupations were vacant. On the other\nhand, the Government's national labor force survey18 in 1999 estimated the unemployment rate\nat 16.1 percent for the 15-19 age group in the urban areas compared with 1.5 percent for the\nsame  age  group  in  the  rural  areas,  and  the  average  national  unemployment  rate  of  1.4\npercent.19 A similar problem exists for the 20-24 age group. The unemployment rate in the\nurban areas is generally higher than in the rural areas, as the agriculture and forestry sectors\n                  \n15  Country Assistance Plan 2001-2003, December 2000, para. 53.\n16  National Employment Board, Bhutan, October 2000, Urbanization and Youth Employment, A Presentation to the\nRoundtable Meeting of Donors in Thimphu, 7-9th October 2000.\n17  TA3464-BHU: Basic Skills Development Project, Final Report, December 2000, Appendix 13 (Report on the Job\nAttitudes of Students and their Teachers, July-August 2000).\n18  National Labor Force Survey, 1998 and 1999: Bhutan, Tables 4.2a and 4.2b.\n19  The unemployment rate is the proportion of the economically active labor force that is not in employment.", "7\ncan absorb unemployable youth more readily as part of family labor. However, the urban\nunemployment rate, which is 10 times higher than the rural unemployment rate, appears to be\ntoo high.\n22.  In 1998 and 1999, unemployment in the urban areas was concentrated in the 15-24 age\ngroup.  The  unemployment  rates  of  urban  youth  for  this  age  bracket  are  rising  while  the\nunemployment rates for higher age groups (age 25 and over) are declining. This situation\ndeveloped because (i) when the labor force of age 25 and over completed their education, they\nenjoyed more favorable recruiting by the public sector, which valued the educational attainment\nof the youth until the Government decided to control the increase of public sector employment in\nthe late 1990s; and (ii) private employers seek from graduates a suitable level of education and\nspecific skills experience, rather than a high level of education. Employers utilize expatriate\nlabor because they have more practical experience than Bhutanese youth. Most of the current\nand  future  vacancies  are  found  in  building  and  construction,  manufacturing,  retailing,  and\nbusiness services. There is an urgent need to train young Bhutanese to fill these existing or\nexpected vacancies. Moreover, although the unemployment rate for the higher age group is still\nless than the average urban unemployment rate of 3.3 percent, it is possible that unemployment\nin the higher age bracket will also be affected soon, mainly due to the aging of the unemployed\nyouth. Due to the Government policy to limit the size of the civil service and the difficulty of\ngetting jobs, students are already changing their traditional preference for a public sector career\nand instead are seeking skills training to gain employment in the industry sector.\n23.  To  address  the  mismatch  in  student  career  aspirations  and  the  expectations  of\nemployers in the private sector, NTTA, in collaboration with MOHE, has piloted school-based\nvocational  training  and  career  counseling  including  instruction  on  work  values  as  part  of\nextracurricular activities to broaden the career aspirations of students. NTTA is planning to\nstrengthen vocational elements in general education in collaboration with MOHE by introducing\nmore contacts with private enterprise such as excursion visits to private firms and inviting\nbusiness persons to the classroom to address students as well as teachers.\n4.  Poverty, Human Resource, and Gender Issues20\n24.  As with some other economic indicators in Bhutan, reliable data on incomes are not\navailable. The United Nations (UN) classified Bhutan among the least developed countries,\nranking it as 142nd out of 174 countries in the human development index (HDI) in 1998.\nNevertheless, the quality of life in the country seems higher than might be inferred from the HDI\ndue  to  the  small  population  and  relatively  equal  distribution  of  landholding.  Moreover,  the\nextended family and village systems provide security for the most vulnerable groups, and a\nsystem of lending/borrowing food during the off-season helps the poorer families, as does the\nBhutan Food Corporation\u2019s \u201cfair price\u201d shops and access to natural produce grown in forests.\nPrimary health care and medical services, and basic education are provided free. With this\nsocial background, poverty is not as abject as in other parts of South Asia.\n25.  However, the per capita gross national product (GNP) of $586 per annum or $1.60 per\nday indicates income poverty. The Government also recognizes that income disparity may\ngradually increase due to the transition from a traditional, rural-based economy to a modern\n                  \n20 STS: BHU 2000-02: Country Operational Strategy, Bhutan, October 2000, Country Assistance Plan, Bhutan,\nDecember 2000 and TA3464-BHU: Basic Skills Development Project, Final Report, December 2000, Appendix 12\n(Social Assessment Report, July-August 2000).", "8\nprivate-sector-led  market  economy.21  Thus,  it  is  imperative  to  increase  income  levels  by\npromoting economic growth and social inclusiveness through interventions in physical and\nsocial infrastructure, including skills training in conjunction with strong employment promotion\nfacilities to keep pace with private sector development.\n26.  Villagers in rural areas of the country do not have adequate skills to participate in\ndevelopment  work.  This  lack  of  basic  skills  will  reduce  the  development  impact  of  the\nGovernment's physical and social infrastructure program, including rural electrification, roads\nextension, water supply, and primary health care services. Training the villagers in basic skills\nwill ensure that they can repair and maintain village property, community schools, basic health\ncenters, roads, and water supply systems as well as have opportunities to earn off-farm income\nas the economy develops. Providing training opportunities through mobile training facilities is\none option to improve the capacity of the rural villages.\n27.  Bhutanese women play a major role in community development activities. Women do\nnot suffer from gender discrimination as they have equal status with men and enjoy the same\nlevel of freedom under the law.22 Indeed, property inheritance laws in particular favor women,\nand most households are headed by women. Women\u2019s participation in decision making at\ncommunity meetings is as high as 70 percent. However, women are more likely to stay on the\nfarm as unpaid family workers compared with men who tend to look for jobs offering cash\nincome.  As  a  result,  women  are  relatively  isolated  from  cash  income  opportunities  while\notherwise treated equally in the society. In TVET enrollments, males still dominate due to\ndemand by industrial employers, particularly the construction industry and public sector, which\ntraditionally appear as leading sectors in the early stage of national development. Gender\nbalance in TVET enrollment and in employment in the private sector need to be improved to\ncreate more equitable access to employment as well as cash income opportunities for women.\n5.  Key Issues\n28.  The most vexing labor market issue is that, despite vacancies in the labor market,\nBhutanese youth have difficulty finding employment after completing their general education\nbecause they lack employable skills and their traditional preference is for employment in the\npublic service. Employers are dissatisfied with the skills attainment of Bhutanese youth and\ntherefore fill vacancies with expatriate laborers from neighboring countries. The broader issue is\nthat national development without job opportunities for the Bhutanese is not compatible with the\ncountry\u2019s  priority  goal  of  self-reliance.  It  is  also  difficult  for  Bhutan  to  limit  the  number  of\nexpatriate laborers as it will result in a loss of competitiveness of Bhutanese labor in the medium\nto long term, which is again not compatible with the Government\u2019s goal of self-reliance.\n29.  The  key  to  further  economic  development  is  to  make  Bhutanese  workers  more\ncompetitive,  with  a  focus  on  making  educated  youth  better  prepared  for  private  sector\nemployment. The Government must undertake TVET reform by (i) developing employment-\noriented  skills  training  for  Bhutanese  workers;  (ii)  strengthening  policy  coordination  and\nmanagement for redeveloping and institutionalizing a national TVET system, (iii) changing the\njob orientation or values system of educated youth during primary and secondary education and\nTVET by effective employment counseling and job placement services; (iv) accelerating private\nsector development and diversification to create more employment opportunities for Bhutanese\nworkers;  and  (v)  establishing  appropriate  employment  and  labor  administration  policies  to\n                  \n21  Bhutan 2020: A Vision for Peace, Prosperity and Happiness, Royal Government of Bhutan.\n22  STS: BHU 2000-02: Country Operational Strategy, Bhutan, October 2000, gender issues, para. 37.", "9\nimprove  working  conditions  in  the  private  sector,  which  are  still  not  as  secure  as  those\nestablished in the public sector. For the sustainable reform of TVET, the following activities will\nbe introduced: a reliable labor market information system; a cost-sharing arrangement with\nprivate  sector  enterprises,  including  consigning  implementation  of  training  programs  to  the\nprivate  sector  training  institutes;  and  implementing  mobile  training  programs  to  reach  in\nparticular women and youth in rural areas.\nB.  Government Policies and Plans\n30.  The 8FYP (1997-2002)23 targets a national gross primary school enrollment rate of 95\npercent by the year 2002. Having achieved significant improvement in the country\u2019s basic\neducation system, the emphasis in the sector is gradually shifting to skills development. The\nacute shortage of locally trained personnel at all skill levels and the heavy reliance on foreign\nlabor has been a major Government concern. Although the country has had to rely on expatriate\nlabor to overcome this constraint, the Government realizes that dependence on expatriates is\nonly  a  temporary  solution.  Developing  indigenous  human  resources  on  the  basis  of  the\nachievement in basic education has become a priority development objective. Both Bhutan\n2020: A Vision for Peace, Prosperity and Happiness, and the Human Resource Development\n(HRD) Master Plan (1997-2002) recommend (i) developing short-term technical, vocational, and\nprofessional  courses;  (ii)  strengthening  HRD  institutions  including  the  TVET  institutions  in\nconjunction  with  employment  counseling  services;  and  (iii)  encouraging  private  sector\nparticipation, including the Bhutan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCCI). These policies\nwill be continued by and further elaborated in the 9FYP (2003-2007).\n31.  In  its  Project  Profiles,24  the  8FYP  incorporates  several  projects  related  to  TVET,\nincluding the strengthening of NDTI, hotel management and tourism training, developing RTI\nand TIZC and basic skills development programs. However, projects that different ministries\nlisted for implementation have little focus on a national TVET system, and linkages between\nindividual projects are not clear in the plan. Unlike the power and industry sectors, which include\nunder  the  respective  project  profiles  the  development  of  an  electricity  act,  standards  and\nguidelines  for  power  supply,  and  industrial  standards,  the  8FYP  does  not  indicate  clear\ninitiatives for an employment act, vocational qualifications, and skills and quality standards for\nthe TVET sector; however NEB is taking steps to address these important issues. The PPTA\nassisted NTTA in formulating a skills development investment plan,25 not only to address the\ndeficiencies in the above plan but also to clarify the scope of investment under the Project with a\nspecific focus on basic skills development. To facilitate project implementation before the loan\nbecomes  effective,  advisory  technical  assistance  (ADTA)26  will  assist  the  Government  in\nincorporating the investment plan in the 9FYP and in preparing basic skills development policies\nand strategies. Qualification and skills standards for TVET will be developed in the initial stage\nof the Project.\nC.  External Assistance to the TVET Sector\n32.  Since 1980s, external assistance to the TVET sector has amounted to $12.5 million,\nabout 20 percent of the total skills training expenditure of the Government. ADB has provided\n                  \n23  Ministry of Planning, Royal Government of Bhutan, Eighth Five-Year Plan (1997-2002) Vol. 1 Main Document.\n24  Ministry of Planning, Royal Government of Bhutan, Eighth Five-Year Plan (1997-2002) Vol. 2 Project Profiles.\n25  TA3464-BHU:  Basic Skills Development Project,  Final  Report,  December  2000,  Appendix  16  (The Skills\nDevelopment Investment Plan)\n26  TA3525-BHU: Institutional Development of the National Technical Training Authority, for $300,000, approved on\n27 October 2000, financed by JSF.", "10\nassistance in establishing the Royal Institute of Management, expanding the Royal Bhutan\nPolytechnic to improve the quality of training and double the intake capacity, and establishing\nthe  NTTA27  to  coordinate  TVET  activities  in  the  country  and  strengthen  its  capabilities  in\nproviding  necessary  skills  training  to  meet  market  demand.  Apart  from  ADB,  the  major\ndevelopment partners supporting the TVET sector include the Government of Germany through\nGTZ  and  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP).  International  volunteer\norganizations  and  NGOs  were  also  active:  Helvetas  Swiss  Association  for  International\nCooperation  (HELVETAS),  Japan  Overseas  Cooperation  Volunteers  (JOCV),  Netherlands\nDevelopment Organization (SNV), and Save the Children of the United States (US). Major\nexternal assistance is summarized in Appendix 3.\n33.  GTZ has been supporting the RTI for more than a decade by constructing workshop\nbuildings and providing equipment. GTZ recently decided to complete its long-term assistance\nby providing consulting services to improve the quality of RTI training courses. UNDP is funding\nvarious activities to promote TVET through the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) and BCCI.\nJapan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA)  also  expressed  interest  and  readiness  to\nconsider a technical and vocational training project, subject to a formal Government request.\nHELVETAS of Switzerland supported a skills development program through MTI for 1997-1999\non a pilot basis. But, because the TVET sector lacked a central coordinating agency before the\nestablishment of NTTA in 1999, previous investments were constrained by unclear TVET sector\nframeworks  and  mutual  linkages.  With  NTTA  as  the  executing  agency,  the  PPTA  was\nimplemented in coordination with UNDP, JICA, GTZ,28 and other aid agencies and NGOs to\navoid  duplication  and  to  seek  closer  linkages  and  synergy.29  As  a  result,  during  project\npreparation, GTZ and ADB agreed with the Government to act as parallel financiers for the\nProject. Further, the Government plans to utilize technical volunteers from JOCV and other\nsources as workshop technicians and assistant instructors during the start-up period.\nD.  Lessons Learned\n34.  The implementation of the Technical and Vocational Education and Training Project\n(footnote 3) approved on 27 September 1990 suffered serious delays before its completion in\nJune 2000.30 The start-up phase was delayed by two years because UNDP, a parallel financier,\ntook a long time in finalizing the arrangements for its consulting services. The project was also\ndelayed  substantially  by  the  executing  agency\u2019s  unfamiliarity  with  ADB  procedures  and\npractices in almost all aspects of implementation, including loan signing, loan effectiveness,\nselecting  consultants,  awarding  contracts,  procurement,  disbursement,  and  submitting\nwithdrawal  applications  and  audited  financial  statements.  Although  the  Government  had\nassigned  an  experienced  staff  to  the  Project  as  project  manager,  the  shortage  of  skilled\npersonnel  remained  a  serious  constraint.  In  addition,  Bhutan\u2019s  mountainous  terrain  and\nscattered population made it difficult to locate appropriate project sites.\n35.  ADB\u2019s recent project impact evaluation study31 as well as the current PPTA identified\nimportant lessons: project design must be commensurate with the capacity of the beneficiaries;\n                  \n27  TA  1381-BHU: Institutional Improvements in Technical and Vocational Education and Training Project,  for\n$750,000, approved on 27 September 1990.\n28  GTZ, JICA, and UNDP were invited to three national workshops under the PPTA.\n29  Memorandum of Understanding between NTTA, ADB, and GTZ on cooperation in the field of vocational and\ntechnical  training  and  education,  21  June  2000,  Appendix  3,  Aide  Memoire;  TA  Fact-Finding  Mission  for\nInstitutional Development of the National Technical Training Authority from 15 to 23 June 2000.\n30  Draft project completion report by the borrowers, October 2000.\n31  IES: REG 99035: Impact Evaluation Study of the Technical and Vocational Education Projects, December 1999.", "11\nand key government agencies, line ministries and their training units, private sector employers,\nand NGOs must be willing and able to cooperate in project activities. More importantly, the\nlatest ADB report on sector synthesis of evaluation findings (SSES)32 indicates lack of linkages\nbetween schools and industries as one of the weakest aspects of the TVET programs. The\nreport specifically pointed out several key issues, lessons and recommendations for future\nproject design: (i) the need for skill-based training and industry linkages in the TVET subsector,\nemphasizing the continuous identification of the needs of industry and introduction of on-the-job-\ntraining (OJT) and entrepreneurial training components; (ii) sufficient budgetary allocations for\noperation and maintenance, particularly for parts and consumables for imported equipment to\nensure utilization of project facilities; (iii) decentralized decision making and greater autonomy to\ntechnical institutes to allow their timely and effective interaction with local industries; (iv) a\nperformance monitoring system to monitor and control the decentralized activities; and (v)\ngreater coordination among agencies to introduce a set of policies to support TVET reform,\nparticularly private sector participation in the reform process through tax incentives to help\nimprove facilities in private training institutes, and a Government policy to outsource training\nservices to the private sector. The ADB report emphasized the need for proper maintenance of\ntraining facilities. Proper training of school administrators is another success factor.\n36.  In  its  operations  in  the  TVET  sector  in  various  countries,  ADB  has  noticed  that\ngovernments often provide, at high unit cost and even in direct competition with the private\nsector, supply-driven skills training programs of such poor quality and relevance that graduates\ndo not gain in employability or productivity. The region nevertheless contains good examples of\ncountries33  that  have  clear  and  effective  skills  development  policies:  Republic  of  Korea,\nSingapore, and Taipei,China have ensured the availability of needed skills within the framework\nof an effective national skills development policy linked to an economic development strategy.\n37.  In close consultation with NTTA, these lessons were carefully incorporated in the project\ndesign, including the introduction of an industry liaison and publicity unit (IPU), industry training\ncommittees  (ITCs),  and  a  labor  market  and  manpower  information  system  to  strengthen\nlinkages with industry. Moreover, during the PPTA, NTTA introduced an apprenticeship program\nwith a cost-sharing scheme with private firms. The Project will include a monitoring system that\nwill not only provide for conventional project benefit and monitoring but also help NTTA to\npromote  the  TVET  decentralization  process  through  monitoring  and  controlling  individual\nactivities by budget and targets. Furthermore, the ADTA (footnote 26) will be implemented in\nclose collaboration with GTZ, from May to September 2001, to assist NTTA to (i) formulate the\npolicy agenda to support successful TVET reform through interministerial coordination, so as to\nbetter utilize the resources of the private sector for improving the training program in a cost-\neffective and relevant manner; and (ii) strengthen the job placement services. Major external\nassistance and lessons learned from the operations in Bhutan are summarized together with\ntheir incorporation in the project design in Appendix 3.\nE.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy33\n38.  ADB\u2019s country operational strategy (COS) focuses on poverty reduction by promoting\neconomic  growth  and  social  inclusiveness  through  interventions  in  physical  and  social\ninfrastructure,  private  sector  development,  employment  creation,  and  improved  economic\nmanagement rather than targeting the especially vulnerable groups, many of whom live in very\nremote  areas.  The  operational  interventions  under  the  strategy  specifically  include  the\n                  \n32  Postevaluation Office. August 2000.

Policy on Education. 2 April.", "12\ndevelopment of the domestic skills base to provide Bhutanese labor with opportunities for more\nrewarding occupations.34\n39.  To maintain productivity and competitiveness, the Government should ensure that the\ncurrent labor force continuously acquires new skills and improves existing ones and that new\nentrants to the labor force have an adequate skills base. ADB will assist the Government in\ndeveloping policies and strategies to facilitate continuous upgrading and adaptation of worker\nskills  while  ensuing  that  preemployment  skills  training  is  flexible  enough  to  promote\nopportunities for training among various groups of people.\n40.  ADB\u2019s education policy includes support for skills development, both preemployment\nand workforce skills upgrading, by (i) developing the Government's capacity to coordinate skills\ntraining  and  to  establish  and  monitor  skills  standards;  and  (ii)  encouraging  private  sector\nprovision of training by helping the Government to establish a conducive policy environment and\nincentives. Support for Government provision of skills training can be justified in the absence of\na private sector alternative, but even then the strategy should be to help create a facilitating\nclimate for the establishment of private sector institutions over the long term and to privatize\ngovernment programs as soon as feasible.\nF.  Policy Dialogue\n41.  Consistent with ADB\u2019s sector strategy, policy dialogue with the Government emphasized\nthat the objective of the Project is to enhance the productivity and competitiveness of Bhutanese\nlaborers  and  make  them  employable  in  private  sector  enterprises.  The  extension  of  skills\ntraining  facilities  to  rural  villages,  which  is  feasible  now  following  major  infrastructure\ndevelopment financed partly by ADB, will facilitate this objective and also have an impact on the\ngender  balance  of  skills  training  participants  and  the  capacity  to  benefit  from  national\ndevelopment by improving the skills of those who did not have access to training. Following the\nrecommendations  of  the  PPTA  and  ADB  policy  dialogue,  the  Government  agreed  to  (i)\nstrengthen its capacity for TVET coordination by adopting a national vocational qualifications\nframework;  (ii)  develop  and  implement  quality  standards  through  accreditation;  and  (iii)\nintroduce a policy promoting equitable access to ensure a balanced gender impact on national\ndevelopment, and a policy on partnership with the private sector to encourage private sector\nparticipation in TVET operations, as indicated in the individual project components. NTTA will be\nresponsible for these matters under the Project.\n42.  The current mismatch between the attitude and qualifications of educated youth and the\nexpectations and needs of employers was a key theme of the policy discussions. The problem\nhas resulted from the socioeconomic development of the country led by the predominance of\nthe public sector in early national development. The situation can be corrected by appropriate\ninterventions including policies to support TVET reform and private sector development. ADB\nemphasized the need to accelerate the reform process to make it credible and cost-effective in\nthe short term and therefore sustainable in the long term. In this respect, a policy agenda that\nwill  require  the  coordination  and  cooperation  of  several  ministries  was  proposed.  The\nGovernment  gave  its  assurance  that  it  will  take  the  initiative  in  leading  interministerial\ncoordination in formulating policies to support the reform process.\n                  \n34  STS: BHU 2000-02: Executive Summary and Bhutan COS Synthesis, para. 36; and Country Operational Strategy,\nOctober 2000. pages iv-v and vii.", "13\n43.  Given that the unit cost of TVET is higher than that of the general education system, the\nGovernment  agreed  to  (i)  encourage  private  sector  enterprises  to  participate  in  the  TVET\nsystem through apprenticeship programs and programs on accreditation and consignment of\ntraining; and (ii) introduce a cost recovery system, not only to cover the higher operating cost of\nTVET but also to limit the provision of free training by NTTA in areas where the private sector is\ncapable of providing training, particularly IT training for which four private training institutes are\nalready in commercial operation. After a review of the 8FYP, which indicated the need for\ncoordination  in  investments  and  policy  framework  in  the  sector,  the  Government  gave  its\nassurance that the findings would be incorporated in the 9FYP by providing a separate section\nfor the TVET sector and incorporating coordination and policy development activities, in addition\nto the individual infrastructure development projects.\n44.  The Government's policy on private sector development was included in the dialogue, in\nparticular, the need for further promoting private sector activities by (i) contracting out public\nservices that are suitable for the private sector: skills training programs, public works and\nphysical environmental services, general municipal services, park and recreation facilities, and\ntransportation; (ii) further promoting entrepreneurship activities through the existing investment\ncenters around the country to provide assistance in starting private businesses, and (iii) further\ncommercialization, corporatization, or privatization of State-owned-enterprises. The Government\nrecently established a private sector development committee consisting of senior government\nofficials to take appropriate actions on these matters and advance private sector development\nduring project implementation. This committee will improve the linkage between TVET and the\nprivate sector.\n45.  During policy discussions35 it was pointed out that a clear industrial policy had not yet\nbeen established. An industrial policy would provide clear Government guidance, direction, and\ndevelopment priorities to the new TVET system and private sector development. While the new\nTVET system should be market driven, clear guidelines provided by the Government's industrial\npolicy will reduce the risk that short-term market interests may mislead the new TVET system.\nMoreover, due to the essentially inflexible nature of TVET operations, which are involved with\nrelatively expensive and specialized training facilities, the implementation of a sound industrial\npolicy will be an essential tool to develop an effective, efficient, and sustainable TVET system\nwith strong links to the future employment prospects of its trainees. The Government clarified\nthat policies exist but need to be further developed. A comprehensive industrial policy is under\npreparation and the policy agenda to be formulated will incorporate the above concerns.\nIV.  THE PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n46.  Since 1981, Bhutan has experienced robust economic growth while diversifying from a\ntraditional subsistence economy to a modern economy. This growth has been accompanied by\nsignificant growth in modern sector employment, particularly in construction, manufacturing, and\nbusiness services. However, Bhutanese youth lack appropriate skills, and have been unable to\ntake advantage of these employment opportunities. Substantial investment in basic education\nover the past several decades has produced a large cohort of educated youth, many of whom\nhave  remained  unemployed  despite  the  existing  employment  opportunities.  Unless  these\ngraduates can be provided with employable skills, they face an uncertain future with little\n                  \n35 STS: BHU 2000-02: Country Operational Strategy, Bhutan, October 2000, para. 12.", "14\nprospect for employment and income-generating opportunities. At the same time the country,\nwill be unable to utilize its domestic human resources to promote national development, and\nsocial problems associated with a growing pool of unemployed urban youth are bound to\nincrease. The TVET system is poorly positioned to provide the high-quality training required by\nthe growing private sector. The Government plans to upgrade the TVET system by improving\nthe policy framework of the system; upgrading the quality and relevance of training; expanding\naccess, particularly for women and the rural villagers who currently do not have access to skills\ntraining; and improving the system\u2019s responsiveness to private sector demands.\nB.  Objective and Scope\n47.  The project seeks to improve the quality and relevance of the TVET system to enable it\nto  provide  employment-oriented  basic  skills  training  to  new  school  graduates,  unemployed\nyouth, domestic laborers, people in rural areas, particularly women and the poor. Such training\nwill give the target groups access to employment and income-generating opportunities and will\nexpand the capacity to provide skilled human resources to promote private sector growth as\nwell as to meet the demand for skilled workers in the private sector. To achieve the objective,\nthe  Project  will  (i)  strengthen  the  institutional  capacity  for  policy  making,  planning,  and\ncoordination in the TVET sector, and for delivering basic skills training relevant to the market\nneeds and commensurate with the capacity of the beneficiaries; (ii) increase access to basic\nskills  training  by  expanding  the  TVET  system  to  include  community-based  programs,  and\nrehabilitating existing and establishing new facilities; (iii) improve the quality of basic skills\ntraining by increasing links with the private sector; and (iv) promote effective utilization of basic\nskills by developing employment guidance and placement services. The Project will have three\ncomponents.\n1.  Institutional Capacity Building (Component 1)\n48.  Policy  Development.  To  accomplish  sustainable  TVET  reforms  in  basic  skills\ndevelopment, the priority is to develop a mechanism in the TVET sector to formulate skills\ndevelopment policies and strategies; and then plan, develop, and implement an employment-\noriented TVET system in a cost-effective manner in close coordination with private sector\nenterprises, private training institutes, and relevant government agencies. NTTA will take the\nlead role in building the employment-oriented TVET system. Before implementing the Project,\nthe ADTA consultants and consultants financed by the Government of Germany will assist\nNTTA in developing appropriate TVET policies, including a national vocational qualifications\npolicy, equitable access promotion policy, private sector partnership policy, and cost sharing\npolicy. The team of consultants will assist NTTA and concerned ministries to prepare a draft\nTVET  promotion  policy  agenda  for  the  Government  to  implement  during  the  Project.  The\npolicies aim at providing NTTA with a rationale for (i) establishing linkages with the private\nsector; (ii) strengthening management capacity to support and administer key committees, units,\nand training institutes; (iii) supporting the delivery of training packages; skill testing through\nprivate training institutes and enterprises as well as its own training institutes; and (iv) improving\nother activities to effectively ensure a participatory process with junior high and high school\nteachers  and  students  and  international  aid  agencies.  NTTA  will  implement  workshops  to\nconsult  with  various  stakeholders  and  disseminate  information  for  the  policy  formulation\nprocess.\n49.  Industry  Liaison  and  Publicity.  The  Project  will  assist  NTTA  in  establishing  the\nIndustry Liaison and Publicity Unit. The IPU has two important functions. One is the industry\nliaison  activities,  in  close  collaboration  with  the  industry  training  committees,  for  example,", "15\nfacilitating  linkage  between  TVET  and  private  enterprises  by  promoting  apprenticeship\nprograms,  consigning  or  cosponsoring  training  modules,  skills  testing  and  competitions,\naccreditation of training programs, and feedback from employers about TVET reform and the\nperformance of trainees. The IPU will also conduct publicity activities such as disseminating\nproject  information  on  TVET  policies,  the  vocational  qualification  framework,  and  skills\nstandards and certification. To accomplish cost-effective reforms in a relatively short period and\nconsidering  the  demand  orientation  of  the  training  programs,  it  is  important  for  NTTA  to\naccelerate and strengthen the participatory process by involving employers. NTTA will actively\npromote  the  new  framework  in  the  market  through  various  publicity  programs,  such  as\ncontacting employers directly and disseminating relevant information to the public to ensure the\ntransparency and accountability of the reform process.\n50.  Management Strengthening. Using modern computer and network technologies, the\nProject will assist NTTA in developing an effective management control system commensurate\nwith NTTA's capacity in terms of number of staff, their skill levels, and office facilities. The\nmanagement control system will include (i) a management accounting and budgeting system for\nNTTA\u2019s internal use to control activities of training institutes and key units by activity-linked\nbudgeting, in addition to the national financial accounting system required by laws for reporting\nto external authorities such as the Ministry of Finance or relevant stakeholders; (ii) a cost\naccounting  system  required  by  the  cost  sharing  policy  to  verify  the  cost-effectiveness  of\nindividual training programs to be consigned to the private sector; (iii) a financial management\nsystem to establish and monitor cash flows; (iv) a cash management system with a clear, built-\nin internal control system; and (v) an asset and inventory administration system to account for\ntimely repairs and replacement of equipment and efficient inventory control of spare parts and\ntraining material. The cash management system, including fee collections and payments, is\nimportant because the education and skills training systems have been operated virtually free of\ncharge to students and the nationwide retail banking network is weak. Institutionalization of the\nmanagement control system will be closely monitored and strengthened by annual management\nreview by the consultants and NTTA. The international fellowships and regional and subregional\ntraining programs will be implemented.\n51.  Alumni Administration System (AAS). One of the commonly observed weaknesses of\nthe TVET system is lack of alumni data due to the mobility and diversity of graduates, which\ninhibit the authorities from tracking the career of trainees after their graduation and establishing\na feedback loop to improve the TVET system. The AAS will create a network among graduates\nto help exchange work experience and employment information.\n52.  To  support  implementation  activities,  the  Project  will  provide  consulting  services,\nequipment, furniture, and vehicles.\n2.  Increasing Access to Basic Skills Training and Employment (Component 2)\n53.  Promotion of Equitable Access. The equitable access promotion policy will enhance\naccess to basic skills training by expanding the existing institutional facilities and widening the\nchoice of trades, providing flexible delivery modes, and locating facilities in more accessible\nlocations. Particular attention will be given to reach women in rural areas who did not have\naccess  to  social  services  including  skills  training  due  to  poor  roads  and  lack  of  other\ninfrastructure.  With  the  recent  improvements  on  the  road  network  (footnote  13)  and  rural\nelectrification (footnote 12), basic skills training is now accessible to rural villagers, especially\nwomen  who  play  an  important  role  in  the  rural  community  of  Bhutan.  NTTA  will  conduct\nequitable access promotion activities, including in-house induction training programs for NTTA", "16\nand its institute staff, interim evaluation of the achievements on increased access in each\ninstitute, and follow-up training incorporating gender sensitization programs for trainers.\n54.  Training Institutes. The capacity of RTI\u2019s facilities, programs, and course delivery will\nbe strengthened and expanded. Competency-based modular-style training packages will be\nintroduced  to  make  training  delivery  more  flexible  and  training  content  more  employment\noriented. To improve internal efficiency, the current instructor-student ratio will be increased\nfrom 1:8 to 1:20 by the end of the Project. Expanding the RTI main campus will increase\nenrollment from about 300 to 750 students by the end of the Project. Refurbishing training\nfacilities in TIZC will increase the capacity from 37 to 170 equivalent full-time students, including\n50 taking short courses over the duration of the Project.\n55.  Two new RTI extensions will be established: one in Trashigang in the eastern part of\nBhutan and the other in Punakha in northern Bhutan. The extensions will increase training\ncapacity by about 320 enrollees. A building construction training center (CTC) including a\nproduction unit to be established in Paro will have the capacity to train 100 equivalent full-time\ntrainees and workers per annum. In Thimphu, an Auto Repair Training Center (ARTC) will be\nestablished, with capacity to train 15 equivalent full-time trainees and workers. NDTI, currently\nlocated in Phuentsholing, will be relocated to Punakha as a new driver training center with\ncapacity to train 75 trainees. Appendix 4 compares the facilities, training content, and staff\nbefore and after the Project.36\n56.  Private Sector Partnership. Under the private sector partnership policy, NTTA will\nstrengthen apprenticeship programs, consign training programs to accredited private institutes,\nand develop customized short courses for in-house training demands. Having implemented 40\napprenticeships for unemployed youth on a pilot basis, NTTA will target 100 apprentices per\nannum.\n57.  Community Access Unit (CAU). CAU will give rural villagers access to basic skills\ntraining. CAU will offer general basic skills training and identify and give training in village-\nspecific skills to enhance the income-earning potential of local communities and encourage\ncommunity entrepreneurship. In particular, CAU will assist in marketing local products through\nNTTA\u2019s advocacy system under IPU. A training program will be developed in the skills training\nresource unit (para. 63), in consultation with CAU, NWAB, and community representatives. CAU\nwill conduct skills needs assessment regularly as well as outreach training programs by sending\nmobile training teams to rural communities. The training program under CAU will be diversified\nto encourage the participation of rural women in skills training.\n58.  Job Placement Office (JPO). The Project will strengthen NEB\u2019s job placement and\nemployment guidance services by establishing JPO. Although the primary mandate of JPO is to\naddress the urban unemployment problem, NEB will also develop a plan to (i) expand JPO\nservices to be conducted in the premises of secondary schools and training institutes, and (ii)\nincrease opportunities for consigning job placement services in major cities to the private sector\nenterprises for implementation by the Government.\n59.  Teaching and training materials, equipment, and vehicles as well as office equipment\nand furniture for the training institutes will be procured and trainers and staff will be trained.\n                  \n36  Specific locations are subject to land availability.", "17\n3.  Improving Quality of Basic Skills Training37 (Component 3)\n60.  The component aims to enhance the quality of basic skills development programs by\ndeveloping (i) a labor market information system, (ii) a national qualifications framework, (iii) an\nemployment-oriented training system, (iv) entrepreneurship training for new business, and (v) a\ntraining system for trainers and staff. GTZ will implement this component.\n61.  Labor Market Information System (LMIS). It is difficult to assess the domestic labor\nmarket structure due to lack of a monitoring system and reliable statistics. NTTA needs a LMIS\nto visualize the labor market for decision making in the strategy process. Before developing\nLMIS, NEB will review the national labor force survey, national household survey, and other\nmajor surveys and statistics. In close collaboration with NTTA, NEB will (i) identify the areas and\nformat of labor market monitoring for their own needs; and (ii) consult with the Central Statistical\nOrganization (CSO), Planning Commission, and other relevant agencies to define the linkages\nand establish an information hierarchy to institutionalize LMIS activities that will not duplicate or\nbe inconsistent with existing surveys.\n62.  Industry Training Committees (ITC). NTTA will establish the National Qualifications\nUnit (NQU) in its headquarters to organize and coordinate ITCs for each industry sector in close\nconsultation with BCCI and operationalize ITCs by holding an induction workshop. Industries\nrepresented by their ITCs may include, for example, (i) building and construction, (ii) electricity,\n(iii)  electronics,  (iv)  IT,  (v)  transport,  (vi)  retailing,  (vii)  tourism,  and  (viii)  business  and\ncommercial services. ITCs under NQU will develop, endorse and implement (i) the competency-\nbased  skills  standards,  (ii)  the  skills  testing  and  certification  system,  and  (iii)  the  training\nprogram accreditation and consignment system. ITC in collaboration with the NQU and NTTA\ntraining institutes will also review and update skills standards, testing and certificate system for\nnecessary adjustment to meet the local context and the progress of private sector development.\n63.  Skills Training Resource Unit (STRU). STRU will be established as a quality control\ncenter  responsible  for  developing,  implementing,  and  updating  training  packages  including\ncurriculum, training material and trainer training. STRU will (i) start with developing nonformal\ntraining packages for community skills development for the use of CAU in consultation with\nCAU, NWAB, and community representatives; (ii) develop formal training packages for each\nmodule following establishment of the skills standards for corresponding modules by ITCs; and\n(iii) train trainers. After the release of training packages for nonformal and formal programs,\nSTRU will undertake review and update cycles. The Project will assist STRU in maximizing the\nuse of computer and network technologies in developing the curriculum and teaching and\nlearning materials. However, the teaching aids and textbooks will also be prepared as printed\nmaterial for use at the training sites.\nC.  Cost Estimates\n64.  The total cost of the Project, including taxes and duties and interest, is estimated at\n$12.5 million equivalent, including $6.8 million (55 percent) in foreign exchange and $5.7 million\n(45 percent) equivalent in local currency costs. The cost estimates are summarized in Table 1.\nDetailed cost estimates are in Appendix 5.\n                  \n37  Component 3 is subject to review and change, if necessary, by GTZ during implementation. ADB will be consulted\nby the Government if there is any major change in project scope.", "18\nTable 1: Project Cost Estimates\n($\u2019000)\nForeign Local Total\nItem\nExchange Currency Cost\nA.

Financing Plan\n65.  The Government requested ADB to provide a loan of $7.0 million equivalent from its\nSpecial Funds resources, representing 56 percent of the total project cost. The Government\nalso requested the Government of Germany38 to provide a grant of DM5 million (about $2.5\nmillion equivalent at appraisal) to support the Project on a parallel basis.39 The ADB loan will\nfinance up to $4.3 million in foreign exchange cost and $2.7 million equivalent in local currency\ncost.  The  Government  will  provide  counterpart  funds  of  at  least  $3.0  million  equivalent,\nrepresenting 24 percent of the entire project cost. ADB will finance a major part of the capital\nexpenditures for the Project while the Government will provide the counterpart funds to cover\nthe entire recurrent cost and part of the capital expenditures as necessary. Details of the\nproposed grant offer by the Government of Germany are attached in Appendix 6.\n66.  The  capital  expenditures  for  ADB  financing  include  civil  works,  consulting  services,\nequipment for basic skills development, training and workshops, and project implementation\ncosts to cover the equipment, furniture, and vehicles of the project implementation unit (PIU),\nbut exclude all costs of land acquisition, taxes and duties, right-of-way, utilities, and community\nlabor. The recurrent cost comprises the cost of trainers and other government staff, and the\n                  \n38  Project/Order No. 2000.2080.0: Advisory Services to the National Technical Training Authority (NTTA), Bhutan.\n39 GTZ, the parallel financier of the Project, uses cofinancing for joint financing arrangements only. To avoid\nconfusion, the term parallel financing is used instead of cofinancing in this RRP.", "19\ncost of operations of basic skills development, including equipment maintenance. To meet the\nincremental recurrent cost incurred during and after the Project and maintain the operations of a\nnew TVET system, the Government agreed to allocate a total amount of at least $3.0 million\nequivalent on an incremental basis for implementing the Project for five years, and an estimated\namount of about $0.3 million equivalent annually on an incremental basis after completion of the\nProject. Details of the staffing requirements are in Appendix 7.\n67.  The loan will be repayable over 32 years with a grace period of 8 years and an interest\ncharge of 1.0 percent per annum during the grace period, and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter.\nA portion of the loan proceeds will be used for interest payment.40 The Borrower will be the\nKingdom of Bhutan.\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nForeign Local Financing\nSource Total\nExchange Currency Percentage\nADB 4.3 2.7 7.0 56\nGovernment of Germanya 2.5 0.0 2.5 20\nRoyal Government of Bhutan 0.0 3.0 3.0 24\nTotal 6.8 5.7 12.5 100\na  The Government of Germany will provide goods and services to be implemented by GTZ for a maximum of\nDM5 million equivalent on a grant basis during a period up to end-2004.\nSource: Staff estimates.\n68.  The provision of local cost financing by ADB is considered justified under ADB\u2019s local\ncurrency financing policy.41 Although there is scope for expanding domestic revenues through\naccelerated  industrialization  by  the  private  sector  and  infrastructure  development  such  as\nelectrification and road improvement, given the expansion of basic services such as education\nand health care, the need to sustain these services increasingly imposes an additional burden\non local resources. Further, despite the still low level of per capita income, which constrains\nnational savings and public finances, the Government has been able to achieve its policy target\nto cover all recurrent cost expenditures from domestic revenues for the past few years for\nsustainable development. In support of the Government policy, the Project will finance most of\nthe capital investment including local currency cost, while the Government will finance the entire\nrecurrent cost from the beginning of the project implementation period.\nE.  Implementation Arrangements\n1.  Executing Agency\n69.  NTTA will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the Project. NTTA is responsible for TVET\nreform and coordination according to its charter. The director of NTTA will be the project\ndirector.\n                  \n40  This paragraph is for indicative purposes only. The loan provision is determined by the loan agreement.\n41  R1-95: A Review of Lending Foreign Exchange for Local Currency Expenditure on Project, 3 January 1995.", "20\n2.  Project Management and Implementation\n70.   A project steering committee (PSC) chaired by NTTA director will be established to\nmonitor and guide project implementation. The PSC will be responsible for (i) liaising with\nrelevant ministries and other projects to develop, propose, and implement a policy agenda to\nsupport  the  TVET  reform  process,  while  avoiding  investment  overlap,  to  create  effective\nlinkages and exchange of information and experience with other projects, and to ensure timely\ncompliance with the loan covenants, including allocation and disbursement of the counterpart\nfunds; (ii) incorporating the emerging needs of beneficiaries and private sector employers in the\nTVET reform process under the Project; and (iii) monitoring implementation of the TVET reform\nagenda under the Project and investigating delays and adopting remedial measures. The PSC\nwill have broad and flexible representation, including standing members and observers. The\nregular members comprise the Planning Commission, RCSC, the Ministry of Finance (MOF),\nNEB, RTI, ITCs, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), MOHE, BCCI, and NWAB. The\nchairperson will invite observers as necessary. NTTA will serve as secretariat to the committee.\nThe PSC will meet at least twice a year in accordance with the major implementation milestones\nas indicated in the project implementation schedule.\n71.  The project director is responsible to ADB for project implementation and will be given\nauthority  to  implement  the  project  activities  according  to  the  agreed-upon  scope  and\narrangements. The project director will appoint project staff and approve procurement and\nsubmission of withdrawal applications to the department of aid and debt management (DADM)\nof MOF for its approval and then submission to ADB, including replenishment of the imprest\nfund.\n72.  PIU will be established in NTTA headquarters to implement the ADB-financed part of the\nProject.42  The  key  PIU  staff  will  be  a  project  manager,  a  disbursement  officer  (qualified\naccountant), a planning and administration assistant, and a procurement officer; all will be on a\nfull-time basis. The project manager will also engage individual consultants and administer their\ncontracts. These key PIU staff will be supported by contracted professional and supporting staff\nsuch as an architect, civil works engineers, computer and network technicians, secretaries,\ndrivers,  and  other  support  and  professional  staff  as  needed  during  implementation.  ADB-\nfinanced civil works site supervisors will assist PIU to closely monitor the quality and progress of\ncivil works and installation of equipment and report their findings and recommendations to the\nproject manager. The Government will bear the cost for all PIU staff, both government and\ncontracted  staff.  Engaging  the  contracted  staff  will  follow  government  procedures  and\nexpenditure regulations. The project management and implementation structure is summarized\nin Appendix 8.\n3.  Implementation Schedule\n73.  The Project will be implemented over five years starting in 2001 with (i) development of\npolicies and physical facilities followed by (ii) initial implementation and (iii) review and update\nactivities  to  fully  institutionalize  the  new  TVET  system  in  a  sustainable  manner.  A  draft\nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 9. The schedule takes into account the difficult physical\nenvironment, including the heavy rainy season in July-August and peak of winter in December-\nJanuary when landslides or deep snow close the roads, and the rugged mountainous terrain\nthat makes access difficult.\n                  \n42  GTZ will arrange its own PIU.", "21\n4.  Procurement of Goods and Services43\n74.  All  ADB-financed  goods  and  services  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement. Contracts for purchase of equipment estimated to cost more than\n$100,000 but less than $500,000 will be international shopping (IS) procedures. All civil works\ncontracts will be awarded in accordance with local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures that\nhave been examined and found consistent with ADB\u2019s guidelines. For contracts to be awarded\non the basis of LCB, the bidding documents will specify eligibility criteria for bidders. Smaller\npurchases of off-the-shelf items estimated at or less than $100,000 will be through direct\npurchase  (DP)  procedures.  Each  procurement  contract  under  the  Project  will  be  financed\nexclusively by ADB or GTZ, or else by other financiers following their own procedures and\nprovisions.  Joint  financing  packages  will  not  be  allowed.  Appendix  10  lists  the  indicative\nprocurement packages.\n5.  Consulting Services43\n75.  The  Project  will  utilize  about  169  person-months  of  individual  consultants:  121\ninternational  and  48  domestic.  ADB  will  finance  up  to  36  person-months  of  international\nconsultants and up to 48 of domestic consultants. GTZ provision is estimated at about 85\nperson-months international consultants at appraisal. The international consultants will be a\nchief technical adviser, a chief implementation expert, a management expert, and other experts\nin the areas of vocational qualifications framework, skills standards, certification and testing,\ntraining  program  accreditation,  apprenticeship  and  consignment  system,  labor  market\ninformation  system,  curriculum  and  training  package  design,  community  access  and  skills\ntraining  and  advocacy  and  publicity.    Domestic  consultants  will  be  computer  and  network\nengineers and civil works site supervisors. In consultation with the GTZ-financed chief technical\nadviser and ADB-financed chief implementation expert, the project director will coordinate the\nconsulting services activities.\n76.  All ADB-financed consultants will be selected and engaged according to the latest ADB\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging\ndomestic consultants. Each consultant contract under the Project will be financed exclusively by\nADB or GTZ, or else by other financiers following their own procedures and provisions. No joint\nfinanced contracts will be allowed. Appendix 11 gives an indicative list of consultants to be\nengaged under the Project and the outline terms of references. Each consultant will be fielded\nas in Appendix 9.\n6.  Staff Development\n77.   ADB will finance about 40 person-months of international fellowships and about 6\nperson-months of regional and subregional fellowships, while GTZ will provide trainers and staff\ntraining of about 70 person-months equivalent. The international fellowship program includes\ndegree  programs  for  NTTA  staff  to  strengthen  NTTA's  management  capacity  and  NEB\u2019s\ncapacity for labor market administration under components 1 and 2. The Government will enter\ninto a bonding arrangement with the participants in the fellowship programs. Candidates will be\n                  \n43(cid:2)\nThe paragraphs are prepared based on the latest guidelines available at appraisal in March 2001. Provisions are\nsubject to change and those included in the latest guidelines at the time of actions taken will always prevail\nduring implementation.", "22\nselected following the Government's standard procedures and subject to approval by ADB.\nDetails of the plan are in Appendix 12.\n7.  Disbursements and Imprest Account44\n78.  To facilitate project implementation and ensure timely release of the loan proceeds, the\nGovernment will at the time of loan effectiveness open and maintain a separate account for the\nproject  imprest  account  (IA)  with  the  Royal  Monetary  Authority  of  Bhutan.  Statement  of\nexpenditure (SOE) procedures will apply in reimbursing and liquidating/replenishing IA covering\npayment of contracts amounting to $100,000 or less45. After the initial deposit, the IA will be\nsimultaneously liquidated and replenished on a regular basis. The amount to be deposited will\ndepend on anticipated expenditures to be incurred for a 3-6 month period and will not exceed 10\npercent of the loan amount. The imprest funds will be maintained as US dollars for necessary\nconversion  to  local  currency  only  at  the  time  of  payment.  All  disbursement,  including  the\nestablishment,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  the  IA  will  follow  the  latest  ADB Loan\nDisbursement Handbook.\n8.  Reporting Requirements\n79.  The PIU will prepare and submit to ADB quarterly progress reports, with a copy to the\nparallel financier in a format agreed upon during the Loan Inception Mission-not later than 30\ndays after the end of each quarter. The reports will (i) examine progress by comparing progress\nin the period under review with the plan indicated in the last quarterly report; (ii) identify reasons\nfor delays and problems encountered, if any, during the period, and remedial actions taken or\nproposed  to  prevent  recurrence  or  to  resolve  problems;  (iii)  report  compliance  with  loan\ncovenants; and (iv) propose programs of activities and physical and financial progress expected\nduring the next three months, with detailed contract awards and disbursement projections.\n80.  At the end of the Project, the Government will prepare a project completion report (PCR)\nnot later than three months following physical completion of the Project.\n9.  Accounts and Audit\n81.   NTTA will establish and maintain consistent records and accounts adequate to identify\ngoods and services financed from the loan proceeds. The PIU will maintain all project accounts\nand related financial statements and have them audited each year in accordance with sound\nauditing  standards  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audited  accounts  and  financial\nstatements and the auditor's report will be submitted to ADB within 12 months of the close of the\nfiscal year. Suitably qualified and trained accounting staff will be made available to assist NTTA\nin maintaining proper project accounts acceptable to ADB. The annual audit will cover the IA\nand SOE and a separate audit opinion on their use will be included in the annual audit report.\n                  \n44(cid:2) The paragraph was prepared based on the latest guidelines available at appraisal in March 2001 (The loan\ndisbursement handbook issued at January 2001). Provisions are subject to change and those included in the\nlatest guidelines at the time of actions taken will always prevail during implementation.\n45  Even though each payment is less than $100,000, if the payment relates to a contract of more than $100,000,\nSOE cannot be used. Therefore SOE under the Project applies on a contract basis, not on payment basis.", "23\n10.  Anticorruption Measures\n82.  The Government was informed of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy, particularly the section on\nfraud and corruption, as stated in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Guidelines on the Use\nof Consultants.\n11.  Midterm Review\n83.  The Government and ADB will undertake a comprehensive midterm review (MTR) of the\nProject  during  the  third  year  of  implementation.  The  review  will  assess  the  progress  and\nachievements  of  the  Project  against  its  objectives,  identify  problems  encountered,  and\nrecommend remedial action, if needed. The Government, in consultation with the MTR mission\nleader, will prepare a MTR report including a midterm benefit monitoring and evaluation (BME)\nreport for submission to ADB with a copy to GTZ, at least 45 days before the fielding of the MTR\nmission. The Government will also invite representatives of GTZ so that the ADB MTR Mission\ncan undertake a joint review with GTZ delegates, if the schedule permits.\n12.  Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n84.  For BME, the Project will introduce a management cycle involving the establishment of\nquantifiable targets with budgetary commitment at the beginning of each year, the activities to\nbe  implemented,  and  performance  evaluation  at  year-end.    In  target  setting,  NTTA  will\ndisaggregate or quantify overall project targets to individual institutes and staff through an\nannual process of consultation. The management cycle will be used to institutionalize timely and\neffective day-to-day activities throughout the institutes. NTTA will evaluate performance-output\nversus budget-of each institute and key staff/personnel and include the results in its annual\nactivity report.\n85.   On the basis of this management cycle, NTTA will achieve the anticipated project\nbenefits by linking project targets to the performance of relevant staff and training institutes. The\ndetailed baseline data for evaluating the project achievement will be prepared and submitted to\nADB within three months of loan effectiveness on the basis of summary indicators in the project\nframework. NTTA will fully utilize the information network for disseminating the information on\nproject activities and achievement versus target figures to create healthy competition and rivalry\namong staff and institutes.\nF.  Executing Agency\n86.  NTTA, the EA, was established in 1999 as a national coordinating body of the TVET\nsystem. The minister of health and education is the chairman of NTTA. Its charter mandates\nNTTA to (i) plan, develop, and coordinate the implementation of a national TVET system; (ii)\nformulate  policies,  and  plan,  coordinate,  and  undertake  all  activities  related  to  TVET;  (iii)\nregister, authorize, and coordinate all TVET programs of institutes, agencies, and all other\nTVET providers, including private training providers; (iv) promote and support TVET programs in\nthe general education system; (v) develop and maintain a national system of skill standards,\ntesting and certification of skilled workers; and (vi) develop partnerships between and among\nindustry and TVET providers. With the strong commitment of the Government and the Royal\nPatronage of the Queen of Bhutan, NTTA has been active and has developed satisfactorily\nsince its inception (Appendix 13). Although NTTA is a new agency, many of its staff had\nprevious  experience  with  ADB-assisted  projects,  particularly  staff  from  MOHE,  who  was\nresponsible for implementing the Technical and Vocational Education and Training Project", "24\n(footnote  3)  completed  in  June  2000.  Despite  staff  constraints  during  the  peak  period  of\nimplementation, previous experience gives NTTA staff the capacity to implement the Project in a\ntimely manner. The chief implementation expert (CIE), an ADB-financed international individual\nconsultant,  will  assist  the  project  director,  project  manager  and  PIU  in  planning  and\nimplementing project activities during the peak period and give on-the-job training to staff.\n87.  During implementation, PIU staff will receive training in and out of the country and will\ncarry out fieldwork at several project sites. To provide backup to the PIU, since one or more of\nits experienced staff will attend training overseas under the fellowships, ADB will finance a CIE\nfamiliar with ADB\u2019s project implementation procedures to assist the PIU for 17 person-months:\n15 for the start-up period and 2 before and during the MTR.\nG.  Environmental and Social Measures\n1.  Environment\n88.  The environmental implications of the Project were reviewed and no adverse impacts\nwere identified. The Project will ensure that siting, design, construction, rehabilitation, and\noperation of the training institutes under the Project will follow the Government\u2019s environmental\nrequirements46,  ADB\u2019s  Environmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Development\nProjects, and other relevant guidelines. Environmental monitoring of the Project will be reported\nthrough the quarterly progress reports to ADB. In the course of curriculum development, the\nimportance of environmental management and protection will be emphasized so that trainees\nunderstand  the  impact  of  industrial  growth  on  the  medium-  to  long-term  prospect  of  the\ncountry\u2019s environment.\n2.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement\n89.   The Government will complete land acquisition and site development for the two RTI\nextensions in Trashigang and Punakha, NDTI in Punakha, and CTC in Paro in accordance with\nits own procedures. For each project site, the Government will submit to ADB a site clearance\nreport prepared by designated autonomous agencies, certifying that (i) no resettlement will be\ninvolved;  (ii)  there  are  no  substantive  issues,  including  any  potential  adverse  impact  on\nvulnerable groups; (iii) siting, design, construction, rehabilitation, and operation of the training\ninstitutes under the Project will follow the Government\u2019s environmental requirements, ADB\u2019s\nEnvironmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Development Projects, and other relevant\nguidelines; and (iv) an authenticated copy of the transfer of title in the English language will be\nsubmitted for ADB\u2019s approval before starting civil works under the loan. To ensure and confirm\nthe full and sustainable operation of the training institutes before the end of the loan utilization\nperiod, the Government agreed to complete all land acquisition within 18 months after loan\neffectiveness.\n3.  Social Analysis\n90.  Gender issues in Bhutan are unique. Overt discrimination is relatively rare, gender\ndisparities are comparatively narrow, and women are equal to men in many aspects. However,\nunfavorable  changes  in  the  gender  balance  have  occurred  in  the  course  of  the  country\u2019s\nmodernization and industrialization. The country\u2019s rapid growth has been achieved through\n                  \n46  Bhutan: Environment Policy 2000.", "25\nconstruction work, which favors male employment. Consequently, the TVET system has been\naffected by the demand for skills training, which tends to favor men.\n91.  Poverty in Bhutan does not take on the characteristics commonly found in South Asia.\nThe  Government\u2019s  liberal  and  generous  social  policies  have  helped  to  ensure  that  as  it\nmodernizes, the population has had wide and equitable access to social services including\nprovision  of  free  education  and  medical  services.  This  concept,  known  as  Gross  National\nHappiness in Bhutan, has been a factor in ensuring that poverty rates do not significantly grow\nor deepen as the country develops.\n92.  The shift from a traditional to an industrial economy and the Government\u2019s priority on\nprivate sector development have precipitated some inequalities as mentioned in the document\nBhutan 2020: A Vision for Peace, Prosperity and Happiness (footnote 21), which stated that\n\u201calthough reliable data are not available, evidence suggests that income disparities appear to be\non the increase.\u201d Signs of increasing unemployment, particularly among urban youth, show the\npotential risk of increasing income inequalities.\n93.  Social  analysis  suggests  the  need  to  strengthen  human  development  to  improve\nequitable  participation  in  the  country\u2019s  national  development  and  income  generation\nopportunities.  The  Project  incorporates  specific  measures  to  extend  access  to  basic  skills\ndevelopment opportunities by developing, implementing, and monitoring the equitable access\npromotion policy to address the male-oriented TVET structure and poor access to training for\nrural villagers, particularly women in rural communities. Under the policy, the Government will\nintroduce gender considerations in developing curriculum and training packages and establish\nthe CAU to introduce outreach programs. The Project also will meet industry demands for\nemployable skills by developing relevant training programs based on the national vocational\nqualifications policy and skills standards.\n94.  The thematic classification of the Project is human development.\nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Economic Benefits and Project Sustainability\n95.  The country\u2019s main benefit from a redeveloped TVET will be the enhanced employability\nof educated youth, particularly women, in the private sector. Economic benefits will also accrue\nfrom the enhanced productivity and competitiveness of Bhutanese workers and the beneficial\neffects of the Project on health and quality of life through better income opportunities. Extending\ntraining facilities to rural areas will benefit those who did not have access to skills training,\nparticularly women. Systematic data for the relative earnings of workers in the enterprise sector\nare not available. Nonquantifiable long-run indirect benefits will primarily be improved market-\nrelevant skills of Bhutanese workers.\n96.  In  addition  to  the  TVET  policies  that  NTTA  will  introduce  to  coordinate  training\nprovisions, the Government will (i) introduce policies to reform TVET, and (ii) encourage the\nprivate sector to utilize the skills acquired by Bhutanese trainees and to participate in TVET. The\nProject addresses the need for cost sharing through several measures: consigning training\nprogram implementation to private training providers, and providing on-demand base training\nprograms and apprenticeship programs. The Government will gradually introduce fees for social\nservices,  including  education.  NTTA  will  introduce  a  cost  accounting  system  and  start", "26\ndeveloping a training fee system. The Project segregates capital and recurrent cost items to\nsupport financial sustainability upon completion of the Project. The Government agreed to fully\nfinance the recurrent costs throughout project implementation to avoid any financing gap in\noperating and maintaining the project facilities at the end of the loan utilization period (Appendix\n4).\n97.  IPU  will  enable  direct  contact  with  employers  to  receive  feedback  and  identify  the\nneeded training programs and delivery modes and to disseminate information to make the\nTVET reform process transparent and accountable; LMIS will establish an objective and reliable\nmarket  information  system;  ITC  will  directly  capture  the  training  needs  of  employers;  the\nmanagement control to link the achievement of project targets with individual performance; and\nthe  location  of  new  training  institutes  that  provide  students  better  access  to  training  and\nemployment.  CAU  will  establish  outreach  activities  utilizing  the  road  and  electrification\ninfrastructure recently provided under ADB assistance; and JPO will provide career guidance\nand  job  placement  services  for  private  sector  employment,  designed  appropriately  to  be\ncommensurate with the social context and absorptive capacity of the Government. The Project\nwill assist NTTA to strengthen the TVET system by adding necessary policy framework and\nfacilities.\n98.  The plans for the new training institutes will promote improved cost-effectiveness and\nsustainable operations. Previously the Government\u2019s in-house skills trainers viewed training as\na matter of supplying predetermined allocations of workers of particular skills types, trained in\nthe traditional established general requirements of the user ministries and agencies. However,\nthat function and principal client have now changed and long-term survival will depend on\nensuring graduate employment mainly in the private sector, by meeting the expressed training\nneeds of industries and their preferred training modalities (time, place, length and levels). This\nwill require rapidly establishing formal links with industry and redesigning programs to meet the\nindustry-determined national skills standards. To facilitate this change, the Project provides for a\nmanagement information system (MIS) and development of LMIS within NEB, and the gathering\nof system data on training and outcomes through longitudinal tracer studies of graduates. It also\nprovides for the establishment of IPU at NTTA to provide central coordination for industry\nlinkages.\n99.  Under component 2, RTI is to be substantially upgraded and expanded. Since RTI is\nalready well-established with basic skills training infrastructure and trained staff, and is widely\nknown, it is more cost-effective to improve its capacity to be the core and base of NTTA\u2019s\nexpansion than to build that up from zero elsewhere. RTI\u2019s location at Phuentsholing, close to\nthe largest center of manufacturing and other industrial activity in the country, makes it a most\nappropriate location for major expansion in certified basic skills training. Due to the high land\ncost in Thimphu (about 30 times higher than in other regional centers), ARTC may be located\non leased premises if it is in Thimphu. Punakha was chosen as the site of the new RTI\nextension campus and NDTI because (i) it is near Thimphu, (ii) it is the center of a wood-based\nindustry, and (iii) it has abundant suitable land and a climate that allows year-round operation of\nNTDI. Paro was chosen as the site of CTC because (i) it is the second largest center around\nThimphu, and thus adds to a suitable distribution of training facilities throughout the region, and\n(ii) it is a major center of the building and construction industry. The other RTI extension campus\nis to be located in Trashigang in eastern Bhutan. Trashigang is an important emerging center of\nenterprise activity, and equally important, is one of the most densely populated parts of the\ncountry and as yet has no basic skills training facilities nearby, except at TIZC.", "27\n100.  The current unit cost of providing skills development training in the different institutes is\nbased on a pattern of instructor staffing and program provision, which is essentially a legacy of\nthe earlier \u201cgovernment training center\u201d role of RTI. NTTA is aware that the required reform will\nnecessitate greater operational and financial efficiency. It has been recommended that unit cost\ndata become a regular part of NTTA\u2019s MIS to allow use of systematic comparative analysis as a\nregular tool for management. Project targets are predicated on the staged adoption of more\ncost-effective instructor-trainee ratios from the 2000 baseline ratio of 1:8 to 1:20 eventually.\n101.  The  Project  is  considered  financially,  economically,  and  institutionally  viable  and\nsustainable. It will adopt cost-effective training methodologies and appropriate private sector\nlinkages to ensure sustained demand for its training services.\nB. Social Dimensions\n102.  The  Project  has  been  prepared  in  a  participatory  manner,  with  representatives  of\nrelevant government agencies, private enterprises, NGOs, major aid agencies such as GTZ and\nUNDP, male and female students and trainees, heads of training institutes and school teachers\nin three major national workshops, consultations with communities by the PPTA consultants,\nand extensive field investigations and site visits by staff during the PPTA review. The PPTA\nconducted social surveys and an independent social analysis by an international social expert.\nThe PPTA also incorporated the findings from the recent ADB-financed poverty assessment and\nanalysis in Bhutan.47\n103.  The Project will benefit four client groups: (i) graduates of junior high and high schools;\n(ii) unemployed educated youth, particularly in urban areas; (iii) workers who need to improve\ntheir skills or to certify their skills attainment at work to secure continued employment and\nincome improvement; and (iv) rural villagers who did not have access to skills training. By\ndeveloping relevant training modules with various modalities for delivering skills training to its\nclient groups, the Project will ensure total enrollment in formal and nonformal skills training of\naround 1,500 annually or training for about 5,300 trainees by the end of the Project.\n104.  In rural areas, CAU will cover at least 210 rural villagers annually with mobile training\nprograms  to  improve  the  shortage  of  basic  skills  needed  for  day-to-day  maintenance  of\ncommunity facilities and provide income generating opportunities to the villagers, particularly\npoor women. Job seekers will receive employment counseling and job placement services.\nConsidering  the  relatively  poor  status  of  gender  balance  in  TVET  enrollment,  the  Project\naddresses the need to enhance the availability of skills training for women through diversified\ntraining subjects, female-friendly facilities such as toilets and girls hostels; training in gender\nsensitization training for planners, trainers, and employment and job placement counselors; and\npublicity work to attract more females to the training so that at least 30 percent of the total TVET\nenrollment will be women by the end of the Project without imposition of an artificial female\nquota  that  often  adversely  affects  the  intended  benefits  to  the  participants  and  project\nsustainability.  Communities  in  rural  areas  will  be  encouraged  to  participate  in  the  training\nprogram, not only for general skills but also for skills geared to develop special community\nproducts  for  income  earnings.    NTTA,  being  aware  of  ongoing  and  planned  village  skills\ndevelopment activities by other agencies, will explore the linkages and coordination through\nCAU to maximize physical coverage without duplicating investments.\n                  \n47  TA3443-BHU: Poverty Assessment and Analysis, for $100,000, approved on 19 May 2000.", "28\nC. NTTA\u2019s Institutional Capacity\n105.  The  current  institutional  capacity  for  TVET  is  weak  due  to  inadequate  policies,\ninsufficient management skills and staff; and lack of a demand-based training system, linkages\nwith the private sector, and capital to update the obsolete facilities in NTTA. The Project\u2019s input\nto policy development and management capacity will strengthen NTTA.\n106.  At the policy level, the Project will support the strengthening of the new TVET system by\nintroducing  four  key  TVET  policies:  the  national  vocational  qualifications  policy,  equitable\naccess promotion policy, private sector partnership policy, and cost sharing policy to provide\ndirection and rationale in decision making, training operations, and other activities to establish\nand operate the training system.\n107.  At the management level, before the start of the Project, an introductory management\ntraining program using a participatory approach will be implemented under the ADTA. The\nProject  will  promote  business  process  reengineering  within  NTTA  by  establishing  a\nmanagement cycle linking planning, implementation, and evaluation into an annual operational\ncycle  and  introducing  management  by  objectives,  a  model  that  is  widely  used  in  modern\ncompetitive organizations. NTTA will assign operational targets with appropriate budgets to\neach staff at the beginning of the year. Individual targets will be set by disaggregating the\nannual targets of the Project. With this system, NTTA will link overall project performance to\nindividual performance, which will be evaluated at year-end. Together with appropriate staff\ndevelopment  programs,  the  Project  will  strengthen  NTTA\u2019s  performance  by  integrating  the\nindividual work programs with the overall organizational goal.\nD. Project Risk\n108.  Timely Implementation. The Project starts with (i) development of policies and physical\nfacilities followed by (ii) initial implementation and (iii) review and updates to fully institutionalize\nthe new TVET system in a sustainable manner. Therefore, initial delay in developing and\nadopting new policies by the Government, or in civil works and installation of training equipment\nwill affect project sustainability because it will reduce the time to fully institutionalize the new\nTVET system.\n109.  For timely implementation of the policies and to manage the TVET reform process, the\nGovernment  agreed  to  start  policy  formulation  for  the  Project  under  the  ADTA,  which\ncommenced in April 2001 for five months. A task force, including representatives of concerned\nministries and private sector industries (to prepare policy recommendations under the ADTA),\nwill become the PSC to ensure the continuity of the policy formulation process. In assisting with\npolicy formulation and preparation of a sector plan to incorporate in the 9FYP, the ADTA also\naims  at  developing  NTTA\u2019s  capacity  for  interministerial  coordination  in  formulating  and\nimplementing several policies to be developed under the Project. The management component\nof the ADTA will strengthen NTTA\u2019s capacity for managing the proposed institutional reform. To\nassist in physical implementation-civil works and procuring and installing equipment-the Project\nwill utilize (i) an international consultant as chief implementation expert to assist PIU in civil\nworks,  procurement  planning  and  contract  awards,  and  key  day-to-day  tasks;  and  (ii)\nindependent  civil  works  site  supervisors  to  closely  monitor  and  follow  up  progress  and\ninstallation and testing of equipment on site. The key ADB consultants including a management\nexpert, chief implementation expert, industry liaison and publicity expert, and job placement\nexpert will be fielded intermittently to support the institutionalization process as indicated in the\nimplementation schedule (Appendix 9).", "29\n110.  Demand for Skilled Labor. Sustained growth of the private sector with rising demand\nfor trained labor is one of the important assumptions for the success of the Project. Although the\nProject will provide skills to Bhutanese with career aspirations for working in the private sector, if\nlabor demand shrinks due to insufficient growth of the private sector, the Project\u2019s development\nimpact and sustainability will be weakened.\n111.  The COS indicates the shortage of skilled Bhutanese as one of the five constraints to the\ngrowth of the private sector, and hence the economic growth of Bhutan. To avoid the future risk\nof insufficient demand for skilled workers, ADB should promote concerted efforts and policy\ndialogue with the Government in various sectors to promote the economic growth of the country\nincluding support to (i) improve policy setting and financial intermediation; (ii) improve road\ntransport and power supply; and (iii) strengthen vocational, technical, and basic skills during the\nproject implementation period as indicated in ADB\u2019s country assistance plan for 2001-2003.\n112.  To effectively cope with the emerging needs from the growing private sector, the new\nTVET system should have management that effectively responds to the changing operational\nenvironment. To ensure efficacy and efficiency of the TVET system, the Project will strengthen\nmanagement by (i) providing modern managerial skills and control system; (ii) institutionalizing\nworking linkages with private enterprises, including setting up such organizations as ITCs and\nIPU and promoting private sector participation in training by apprenticeship and the training\nconsignment system; and (iii) developing a reliable labor market monitoring and assessment\nsystem. Mechanisms to enhance private sector participation in the new TVET system are\nsummarized in Appendix 14.\n113.  Demand for Training by Educated Youth. The attitude of the educated Bhutanese\ntoward both a public sector career and private sector employment is changing. Due to the\nlimited prospects of  (i) being recruited into the public service due to the Government policy to\nlimit the size of the civil service, and (ii) finding suitable employment in the industry sector due to\nlack of employable skills, Bhutanese youth are already seeking basic skills training. To further\npromote the change in attitude, the Government in the mid-1990s established NEB to assist in\njob placements in the private sector, and introduced work value education throughout the\ngeneral education system. In support of the proposed new Government policies, an IPU will be\nestablished in NTTA under the Project to implement the school-industry exchange programs\nand  several  publicity  works  by  organizing  workshops  and  utilizing  newspaper,  radio,  and\ntelevision  programs,  web  and  e-mails,  and  other  media;  and  JPO  in  NEB  to  offer  career\nguidance and job placement services for employment in the private sector. To promote work\nvalue education at the school level, the Project will also strengthen vocational center facilities in\nsecondary schools nationwide.\n114.  Other Demand-Related Risks. In addition to these demand-side risks (para. 110-113),\nother  risks  for  project  sustainability  exist:  the  inflexibility  of  the  training  provided,  and  the\nchanging demands of the private sector as it develops and progresses towards a modern\nindustrial economy (policy risk), or the capital requirements necessary to replace equipment due\nto changing demand (capital risk). It is crucial that the training system develop the ability to\nquickly adapt and evolve with the changing requirements of industry. This requires strong\nlinkages  with  the  private  sector.  To  institutionalize  private  sector  linkages,  the  Project  will\nestablish four key TVET policies including the private sector partnership policy at the outset.\nThe capital-intensive nature of TVET has been deemed an inherent weakness of the TVET\nsystem. The Project will challenge this risk by introducing innovative cost sharing schemes such\nas consigning training operations to private sector institutes by contract. Under the consignment\nsystem, NTTA will develop training programs and, if necessary, procure training equipment for", "30\nrent, while the contracted private training institutes will use their own premises to conduct\ntraining using the programs and equipment rented from NTTA.\nVI.  ASSURANCES\nA. Specific Assurances\n115.  The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i)  Within two months of loan effectiveness, the Government will establish a project\nsteering committee (PSC), with a composition similar to the interministerial task\nforce under the ADTA. The PSC will be chaired by the director of NTTA, and\nNTTA will serve as the secretariat to the committee.\n(ii)  Within  six  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  allocate  all\nnecessary staff to the key project units including (a) one staff for IPU; (b) one\ncoordinator, three regular staff, and one support staff for STRU in NTTA; and (c)\none regular staff and one support staff for LMIS in NEB.\n(iii)  Within  six  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Borrower  shall  confirm  all\nnominations  of  industry  sectors  for  organizing  ITCs  as  well  as  the  effective\nappointment of members for at least four ITCs. Within eighteen months of loan\neffectiveness, the Borrower shall confirm the appointment of the members of the\nremaining ITCs.\n(iv)  The Government will adopt all appropriate and necessary measures to allocate\nsufficient resources to cover the entire recurrent cost of all project activities.\n(v)  Within  12  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  NTTA  will,  based  on  the\nrecommendations  resulting  from  the  ADTA,  prepare  and  approve  four  basic\npolicies aimed at institutionalizing the new TVET system, namely: (a) a national\nvocational qualifications policy; (b) an equitable access promotion policy; (c) a\nprivate sector partnership policy; and (d) a cost sharing policy.\n(vi)  Within  12  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  NTTA  will,  based  on  the\nrecommendations resulting from the ADTA, formulate recommendations for an\ninterministerial  policy  framework  to  support  its  own  TVET  policies.  This  will\ninclude the following: (a) an overall labor administration policy, including inputs\nfor  an  Employment  Act  and  implementing  regulations  for  secure  working\nconditions in the private sector (NEB); (b) a skills utilization policy including\nintroduction of skills utilization promotion budgets attached to NTTA and NEB,\nand measures to encourage employers to recruit from training institutes and to\npromote  consignment  of  training  programs  and  skills  testing  (MOF);  (c)  the\npromotion  of  linkages  between  schools  and  industries  (MOHE);  and  (d)  an\nindustrial policy and incorporation of the national vocational qualifications system\nin the business licensing system (MTI, Planning Commission).", "31\n(vii)  Annually NTTA will review and update management systems of NTTA and its\ntraining institutes. The diagnostic analysis and proposed actions for improvement\nwill be included in the succeeding quarterly progress report.\n(viii)  The Government will take all appropriate and necessary measures to ensure an\noverall  female  enrollment  ratio  of  at  least  30  percent  in  its  skills  training\nprograms, without resorting to a quota system.\n(ix)  Within 12 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will inform ADB of the\nfinal approval of the sites where two RTI extensions, NDTI, CTC, and ARTC will\nbe  located.  Within  18  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will\ncomplete land acquisition or lease arrangements for all building extensions and\nconstruction of the five institutes under the Project and will hand the titles over to\nNTTA. The Government will submit to ADB a site clearance report for each\nproject site, certifying among others that no resettlement of people, including\nsquatters is involved. No construction under the Project will start before ADB\napproves the site clearance report. Unless ADB otherwise agrees, ADB may\ncancel the loan financing for civil works and equipment of any institute for which\nland acquisition cannot be completed within 18 months after loan effectiveness.\n(x)  The Government will ensure that for all new training facilities to be constructed\nunder the Project, a staffing plan will be approved before construction of the\nfacility starts and that these training institutes will have appropriate facilities-\nwomen's dormitories and women's bathrooms-to accommodate women's needs.\n(xi)  Within three months of loan effectiveness, NTTA will prepare and submit to ADB\ndetailed baseline data for the Project\u2019s achievements.\n(xii)  At  least  45  days  before  fielding  the  midterm  and  project  completion  review\nmission, NTTA will prepare and submit to ADB a midterm and final BME report.\n(xiii)  The Government will ensure that siting, design, construction, rehabilitation and\noperations of training institutes under the Project will follow the Government\u2019s\nenvironmental  requirements,  ADB\u2019s  environmental  guidelines  for  Selected\nInfrastructure Development Projects, and other relevant ADB guidelines on the\nenvironment.\nB. Conditions for Loan Effectiveness\n116.  The following will be the conditions for the loan to become effective:\n(i)  A Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will be established in NTTA headquarters to\nimplement the ADB-financed part of the Project.
