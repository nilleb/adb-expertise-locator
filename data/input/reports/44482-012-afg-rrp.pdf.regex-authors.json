I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the Transport \nNetwork Development Investment Program.1  \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n2.  The  proposed  investment  program  will  rehabilitate  and  expand  major  sections  of \nAfghanistan\u2019s road and railway networks. The investments, physical and nonphysical in nature, \nwill add to those already being supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other \ndevelopment partners. The aim is to further improve domestic and regional connectivity while \nwidening access to social and economic opportunities. The effort will facilitate investment into \nkey strategic industries, including mining and related services. The result will be growth, jobs, \nwelfare and trade. Providing better links from Central Asia to markets in the south, east, and \nwest  will  generate  transit  fees  but  also  new  business  opportunities  to  companies  across \nAfghanistan. The road network is incomplete, mostly in bad shape, and the railway network is in \nits infancy. Capital outlays in both networks will cut transport costs, increase competitiveness, \nand  raise  productivity.  A  modern  and  efficient  multimode  system  reduces  poverty,  and \ncontributes to inclusive economic growth and stability. \n3.  Roads serve 90% of Afghanistan\u2019s travel demand. The network is overstretched while \nvehicles numbers are rising fast. Since 2009, there are 23% more cars, 15% more trucks, 48% \nmore motorcycles, and 2% more buses on the roads. Freight is carried mainly in private trucks \nsince rail transport is too new and limited and air transport is too expensive. More than 85% of \nroads are in poor condition, with large portions, particularly in rural areas, impassable. Only 15% \nof planned national highways have been built. The investment program will invest in almost  \n600 km of roads, or 7% of the total national and regional highway network.  \n4.  Afghanistan needs railways for development. Its strategic location and recent finds of \nmineral and ore deposits add to railway relevance. Less than 100 kilometers (km) of track have \nbeen built so far. This includes the 75 km railway line constructed between Hairatan and Mazar-\ne-Sharif (Railway Project), a project completed in 2011 with ADB funding.2 This is the first rail \nproject in Afghanistan\u2019s history. To be viable, the network must grow. Future expansion plans \ninclude a new section from Mazar-e-Sharif to Bamyan to the newly discovered mineral centers.3  \nOther sections will link Mazar-e-Sharif to Andkhoy in the northwest, and eventually run from \nAndkhoy to Herat. Sections from Iran to Herat and Kandahar to Spin Boldak are also under \nconsideration. The entire network will be based on the Central Asian gauge system. This will \nmake the railway relevant and competitive, and facilitate north-south trade. Central Asia is a \nconduit for mineral exporters who will rely on Afghanistan\u2019s railway network. \n5.  The road subsector faces four main problems: (i) a small network in a poor state of \nrepair,  (ii)  weak  institutional  capacity,  (iii) lack  of  quality  contractors  and  consultants,  and         \n(iv) limited construction materials. Together with insecurity, these bottlenecks lead to higher \nthan average construction and maintenance costs. They also affect timelines for construction.4 \nDespite this, ADB projects are experiencing reasonable success in the subsector. Road projects \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework for the investment program is in Appendix 1.   \n2  ADB. 2009. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Asian Development \nFund Grant to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the Hairatan to Mazar-e-Sharif Railway Project. Manila. \n3  Funding is likely to be extended by the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \n4  Sector Assessment (Summary): Transport (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "2   \nfunded by ADB are subject to cost overruns, but on the whole they have been built to high \nstandards and through transparent procurement arrangements. Getting projects built on time, \nwithin  budget,  and  to  high  standards  is  possible  but  requires  innovative  approaches.  \nThe Railway Project started in 2010 is one of the fastest ever implemented by ADB. This was \nachieved  largely  on  account  of  four  actions:  (i)  outsourcing  of  the  supervision  function; \n(ii) reliable security arrangements during implementation; (iii) use of a fixed price, fixed delivery \ncontract with premiums and penalties; and (iv) regular monitoring by ADB teams in Kabul and \nheadquarters. A contract just awarded to complete the last 230 km of the Ring Road will follow a \nsimilar approach.  \n6.  Strategic  context  and  roadmap.  The  Afghanistan  National  Development  Strategy \n(ANDS) represents the strategic framework for development between 2008\u20132020. The ANDS \ninfrastructure pillar aims at establishing a safe and integrated network to ensure good domestic \nand international connectivity at a low cost. A roadmap for the sector identifies short, medium, \nand  long  term  investments  covering  roads,  rail,  and  airports. 5 This  roadmap  outlines  the \nsequencing of physical investments, actions, and reforms required to stimulate institutional \neffectiveness.  The  investment  requirement  up  to  2020  exceeds  $3  billion.6 ADB's  Country \nPartnership Strategy (CPS) for 2009\u20132013 is aligned with ANDS. The regional agenda figures \nprominently in the CPS and transport sector roadmap. Afghanistan is a transit country or \u201ccenter \nof gravity\u201d and is one of the most active members of the Central Asia Regional Economic \nCooperation  (CAREC)  program.  Of  the  six  identified  CAREC  corridors,  three  traverse \nAfghanistan.  Recent  ADB  projects  in  the  transport  sector  have  been  funded  under  a \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF),  now  fully  utilized. 7 Supporting  new  priority  projects \nrequires a new MFF. The strategy and roadmap underpinning the first MFF remains valid for \nthis new MFF. \n7.  Policy framework. The transport sector benefits from a clear policy framework that \noutlines the vision and principles for investment, maintenance, institutional change and reform. \nIt also outlines the need for better planning and oversight, cost recovery, and adherence to best \npractices on procurement, safety, governance as a whole, gender considerations, construction \nstandards, and traffic management. Institutional effectiveness also includes a call for better \nbudgeting and financial management, information systems to monitor performance, evaluation \nand reporting, and training of Afghans. The framework focuses on multimode systems.  \n8.  New MFF. The government has requested ADB to provide a new MFF for financing \npriority road and rail projects over the next few years. The new MFF has more or less firm \ntranches (except for the first, each tranche is subject to final due diligence). These tranches are \nsplit between road and rail interventions. The MFF is the preferred funding modality given its \nflexibility and ability to sequence investments. All the preconditions for the MFF are in place, \nincluding the existence of a coherent strategy, sector roadmap, investment and financing plans, \nand  policy  framework.  The  new  MFF  amounts  to  $805  million.  This  will  consolidate  the \npartnership  started  under  the  existing  MFF.  Lessons  learned  from  past  operations  are \nincorporated  in  the  new  MFF  (footnote  4).  The  most  important  revolve  around  new \nimplementation arrangements including the use of larger turnkey contracts, higher contractor \nand consultant quality, new contract modalities, independent project management, and regular \nADB team involvement.  \n                                                \n5  The Transport and Civil Aviation Sector Strategy within ANDS is commonly referred to as the Transport Sector Strategy. \n6  Ministry of Mines.

Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the investment program will be increased trade and jobs. The outcome will \nbe increased movement of goods and services and better connectivity for people and businesses.  \nC.  Outputs \n10.  The outputs include (i) about 578 km of reconstructed or rehabilitated regional and \nnational roads, (ii) 225 km of constructed railway and stations between Mazar-e-Sharif and \nAndkhoy, (iii) efficient operation and maintenance (O&M) of the Hairatan to Mazar railway line, \n(iv) strengthened capacity at the Ministry of Public Works (MPW), and (v) improved transport \nsector governance.  \n11.  The outputs under tranche 1 include 145 km of improved road sections: (i) 50 km \nbetween Bagramy\u2013Sapary road, (ii) 51 km between Jabul Saraj\u2013Nijrab, and (iii) 44 km between \nFaizabad\u2013Beharak. Tranche 1 will also support the Railway Project O&M contract, including \nadditional project facilities and equipment to ensure its efficiency. The capacity component will \ndeliver a new governance needs assessment; a revised national road and rail transport plan; \nassistance to the rail authority and a detailed feasibility study and design work for the new \nMazar-e-Sharif  to  Andkhoy  railway.  Other  outputs  include  special  assistance  to  improve \nplanning  at  MPW; a  new  road  and  rail  asset  management system; procurement, financial \nmanagement, safeguards plans; evaluation, monitoring and reporting and training.  \n12.  Future tranches under the MFF are fairly firm. Tranche 2 will reconstruct the remaining \n106 km section of the Kabul to Jalalabad road, the remaining 112 km of the Faizabad to \nEshkashem road, and 33 km of the Lashkar Gah to Gereshk road. Tranche 3 will construct the \nMazar-e-Sharif to Andkhoy railway, and most likely reconstruct the first 101 km section of the \nDar-i-Suf to Yakawlang road. Tranche 4 will reconstruct the remaining 81 km section of the Dar-\ni-Suf to Yakawlang road. Each future tranche will also cater for capacity support, feasibility \nstudies, and other \u201csoft\u201d investments.  \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n1.  Investment Plan \n13.  Afghanistan\u2019s  overall  road  and  rail  investment  plan  up  to  2020  exceeds  $3  billion.  \nThe rail network is the least complete and the most expensive ($2.5 billion). Remaining priority \nroad investments run to $1 billion. The more medium term part of this plan (up to 2017) is \nestimated to cost $2.7 billion.  \n14.  The investment program will cost $805 million equivalent. Subprojects financed under \nTranche 1, including taxes, duties, and physical contingencies will cost $232 million equivalent. \nTable 1 summarizes the costs estimates and illustrates how the investment program fills a \nsignificant gap in Afghanistan\u2019s overall land transport network development plans. \nTable 1: Investment Program \n($ million) \n \nItem  Amounta \nLong Term Investment Plan (2011\u20132020)   \n1.

Financing Plan \n15.  The broad road and rail investment plan needs ADB and other development partner \nassistance.  ADB  support  will  be  channeled  through  the  new  MFF  and  the  Afghanistan \nInfrastructure Trust Fund (AITF).  Although still evolving, two countries (Japan and the United \nKingdom) have already contributed funding to the AITF. Others are considering doing the same. \nThe MFF is being structured as follows: (i) up to $754 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources (the Asian Development Fund [ADF]), and (ii) a grant of $33 million from the AITF \nadministered by ADB.8 Finance extended under the MFF will cover the business receipts tax \n(BRT).9 This is the practice also followed by the World Bank in Afghanistan.  \n16.  Approval of finance under the MFF will be subject to the government\u2019s submission of \nperiodic financing requests (PFRs), execution of related grant and/or loan agreements for each \ntranche, and fulfillment of the terms and conditions and undertakings set out in the framework \nfinancing agreement (FFA). The government has been informed that the allocation of ADF \nresources is subject to (i) the availability of ADF resources from time to time, (ii) Afghanistan\u2019s \naccess  to  such  resources  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  then  applicable  Graduation  Policy10 and  the \nrequirements of ADF donors, and (iii) availability of such resources to Afghanistan pursuant to \nADB\u2019s then applicable policy on the performance based allocation of ADF resources11 and other \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2010.

Business receipts tax costs \ndo not represent an excessive share of the financing plan and are within applicable CPS parameters. See ADB. \n2008.

Manila. \n ", "5 \napplicable  ADB  policies.12 A  country's  eligibility  for  ADF  grants  under  the  revised  grant \nframework is determined by its risk to debt distress. The latest debt sustainability analysis \ndetermined a high risk of debt distress, making the country eligible to receive 100% of its ADF \nallocation as grants. Afghanistan\u2019s position will be reviewed during the course of the investment \nprogram. It cannot be ruled out therefore that its eligibility for grant financing will not change.  \n17.  Grant  financing  from  ADF  resources  will  be  made  available  under  the  Special \nOperations  Grant  Regulations  subject  to  any  modifications  in  the  grant  agreements.  \nLoan financing from ADF resources will be made available under the Special Operations Loan \nRegulations subject to any modifications in the loan agreements. Grant financing from AITF will \nbe  made  available  under  ADB\u2019s  Externally  Financed  Grant  Regulations  subject  to  any \nmodifications in the individual grant agreements. \n18.  Tranche 1 of the MFF amounts to $222 million and includes (i) a grant of $189 million \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources on terms and conditions set out in the Special Operations \nGrant Regulations and such other terms and conditions set forth in the related grant agreement \n(ADF grant), and (ii) a grant of $33 million from the AITF to be administered by ADB on terms \nset out in the Externally Financed Grant Regulations to finance the Bagramy\u2013Sapary Road and \nadditional financing for the Railway Project. The government will contribute $10 million for land \nacquisition. \n19.  The additional financing for the Railway Project covers works necessary to support \nvarious activities related to the operations and maintenance contract, including gap financing. In \n2011, the government concluded a three year performance-based O&M services contract with \nan affiliate of the Uzbekistan State Railway Company, SE Sogdiana Trans (O&M Contract).13 \nBased on the O&M Contract terms and expected revenue yields,14 railway O&M is expected to \nbecome self-sustaining when the freight volume reaches 3.8 million tons per year. Volumes \nbelow this benchmark need a subsidy. The government requested ADB to provide $17 million \nover 3 years to meet part of the O&M financing gap.15 The scope of the Railway Project was \nchanged in June 2011 to incorporate a new O&M component. It also applied $4 million in \nsavings  under  the  project  to  help  finance  the  gap  during  the  first  year  of  operation.  The \ngovernment requests that ADB provide additional financing of up to a further $13 million under \ntranche 1 of the MFF to help meet the expected financing gap. Separately, the government also \nrequests a further $20 million under tranche 1 to cover some civil works, equipment, and \ninspection  services  needed  to  operate  the  railway.  The  request  complies  with  eligibility \nrequirements for additional financing.16 Moreover, activities proposed for additional financing \nunder tranche 1 are consistent with development objectives of the Railway Project. However, \nthe policy currently applicable to MFFs restricts the use of MFF funds for additional finance to \nfunding for \u201cprice or financing arrangement changes\u201d.17 In this instance, it is proposed that \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2010. Afghanistan: Proposed Suspension of the Post-Conflict Assistance Phaseout. Manila. \n13 The need for the government to outsource O&M of the railway line (including provision of rolling stock) once \ncompleted under a direct contracting process to Uzbekistan State Railway Company-O\u2019zbekistan Temir Yo\u2019llari \n(UTY), was foreshadowed early in the Railway Project (footnote 2).  \n14 Consistent with Railway Project objectives, tariffs have been set at levels competitive with truck shipment.  \n15 Freight volumes may exceed or fall short of expectations. ADB funds will be utilized for O&M support to the extent \nthat revenues fall short of the break even threshold. Financial sustainability is expected by the third year of \noperations.  \n16 A February 2011 review mission confirmed that project progress is on schedule and that safeguard requirements \nhave been met, risks adequately mitigated, and implementation is highly satisfactory. \n17 ADB. 2010. Multitranche Financing Facility. Operations Manual, Manila (para 41). ADB\u2019s Additional Financing \nPolicy allows additional financing for a change in project scope. See ADB. 2008. Cost Sharing and Eligibility of \nExpenditures for ADB Financing. Operations Manual. Manila (para. 8).  \n ", "6   \nactivities  under  the  proposed  change  in  scope  be  eligible  for  additional  financing \nnotwithstanding this policy restriction.18 This is considered appropriate because the proposed \nactivities are (i) ancillary to O&M Contract activities already partly funded under the Railway \nProject, (ii) considered necessary to run the railway service efficiently, and (iii) consistent with \nthe sector wide focus of the new investment program. Moreover, it is not considered feasible to \ncreate a  separate  stand-alone  project for  these  ancillary  O&M  activities. Other  aspects of \ntranche 1 are described in the PFR. \n20.  ADB transport sector projects in Afghanistan have experienced regular cost overruns \nand/or financing gaps. In view of this, it is proposed that investment program funds be used to \nprovide additional financing to other ongoing ADB transport sector projects whenever these are \nconsistent with eligibility requirements, existing ADB policies and procedures, the investment \nprogram and as agreed between the government and ADB.  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Amount   Share of Total (%) \nMedium Term Investment Plan     \nTransport Network Development Investment Program   754.0  28.5 \nAfghanistan Infrastructure Trust Fund   33.0  1.2 \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China   1,320.0  49.8 \nGovernment of Afghanistan  108.0  4.1 \nOthers   435.0  16.4 \n             Total        2,650.0  100.0 \nTransport Network Development Investment Program     \nAsian Development Bank a  754.0  93.7 \nAfghanistan Infrastructure Trust Fund b  33.0  4.1 \nGovernment of Afghanistan  18.0  2.2 \n             Total        805.0  100.0 \nTranche 1     \nAsian Development Bank  189.0  81.5 \nAfghanistan Infrastructure Trust Fund  33.0  14.2 \nGovernment of Afghanistan  10.0  4.3 \n             Total        232.0  100.0 \na Opportunities for additional Afghanistan Infrastructure Trust Fund (AITF) cofinancing will be explored.  \nb Contributors: Governments of Japan and United Kingdom.

The government will follow ADB\u2019s policies and procedures, including the Procurement \nGuidelines (2010, as amended from time to time), Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by ADB \nand its Borrowers (2010, as amended from time to time) and the Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  government  requested  approval  of  retroactive \nfinancing  under  tranche  1  not  exceeding  20% of  the  aggregate  ADF grant  and  AITF grant \namounts to cover eligible civil works, O&M equipment and consulting services. Two of the road \n                                                \n18 Arguably, proposed funding for the O&M Contract financing gap is a \u201cfinancing arrangement\u201d change. However, as \nthis element is inextricably linked with the other proposed O&M activities, the whole additional financing package is \nbeing treated for approval purposes as arising from a change in scope of the project.     \n ", "7 \nsubprojects included under tranche 119 were originally intended for inclusion in the second tranche \nof the existing MFF. However, following a reallocation of funds to complete the priority Ring Road, \nthese investments were not funded under that tranche. The government proceeded with advance \nactions in the expectation that these subprojects would be covered later under the MFF. Since the \nMFF  does  not  have  any  unallocated  funding  left,  the  government  asked  ADB  to  approve \nretroactive financing under the new MFF to reimburse expenditures incurred up to 18 months \nbefore the signing date of the grant agreement.20 Given these circumstances, and as advance \nactions  have  facilitated  project  readiness  and  been  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB \nrequirements, the request is considered justified, and thus proposed as part of the new MFF.  \n23.  O&M services for the Railway Project financed under tranche 1 will be provided under \nthe  existing  O&M  Contract.  Railway  O&M  equipment  will  be  procured  on  the  basis  of \ninternational  competitive  bidding.  Given  the  role  of  Uzbekistan  State  Railway  Company-\nO\u2019zbekistan Temir Yo\u2019llari (UTY) as the engineering, procurement, and construction contractor \nfor the Railway Project, UTY is proposed to be appointed on a direct contracting basis to \nundertake the ancillary civil and track works for additional financing under tranche 1.21 This will \nsave considerable time and money. \n24.  Specific actions to ensure the efficient implementation of future projects under the MFF \ninclude (i) high state of readiness; (ii) large turnkey contract packages; (iii) fixed price and fixed \ndelivery contracts with premiums and penalties against timelines and quality standards; and    \n(iv) independent supervision with emphasis on in-house qualified staff for core jobs, quality, and \ndual reporting to ADB and MPW. The latter is fundamental. It aids ADB\u2019s monitoring and \nreporting  and  facilitates  the  preparation  of  action  plans  to  correct  poor  performance.  \nThe consultants will be required to clear design proposals and payment requests against agreed \ncontract  schedules.  Project  management  is  to  be  effectively  outsourced.  The  underlying \npremise  is  that  the  quality  of  the  implementation  depends  largely  on  the  quality  of  the \ncontractors  and  consultants.    As  far  as  possible,  projects  will  follow  a  \u201cdesign  and  build\u201d \napproach. Each bid will be subject to special features to ensure competition, efficiency, and \nquality. All contracts will be subject to audits by independent external consultants.  \n25.  Implementation  arrangements  are  captured  in  the  facility  administration  manual \n(Appendix 2) and summarized below.  \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  September 2011\u2013June 2017 \nEstimated completion date  30 December 2017 \nProject management \n(i) Oversight body  Ministry of Finance  \n(ii) Executing agency  Ministry of Public Works \n(iii)Key implementing agencies  Ministry of Public Works \n(iv)PIU  PMO   Staff of 25 \n \n \n                                                \n19 The Bagramy\u2013Sapary (50 km) and Jabul Saraj\u2013Nijrab (51 km) sections. \n20 ADB\u2019s general rule permits reimbursement for expenditures incurred no earlier than 12 months before the signing \ndate of related grant agreement. However, a period commencing on an earlier date may be allowed on a case by \ncase basis. ADB. 2006. Retroactive Financing. Operations Manual.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial  \n26.  Economic analysis was carried out for tranche 1. The economic analysis is conservative, \nfocusing on the direct benefits generated from savings in vehicle operating costs and user time. \nNet economic benefits are expected to exceed the sum of individual project cost estimates. \nBased on the economic internal rate of return (EIRR), net present value (NPV), and sensitivity \nanalysis, the subprojects under tranche 1 are feasible.  \nB.  Governance  \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to, and discussed with, the government and \nMPW. Specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the facility \nadministration manual. The government\u2019s policies and procedures on financial management, \nprocurement, anticorruption, and other institutional issues and mechanisms were found to be \nsatisfactory.22 All  bidding  documents  for  contracts  under  the  MFF  will  include  provisions \nspecifying ADB\u2019s right to audit records and accounts related to the MFF, as well as those of all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the MFF. MPW \nand  the  Ministry  of  Finance  will  take  additional  measures  to  strengthen  governance, \naccountability, and transparency under the MFF, primarily with direct payment procedures. Key \nmeasures  are  (i) external  auditing  of  contracts,  project  accounts,  and financial  statements; \n(ii) transparent  decisions  on  all  procurement  matters;  and  (iii)  verification  of  contractors\u2019 \npayment claims by supervision consultants following contract specifications. \n                                                \n22 ADB and World Bank conducted risk assessments of country level systems in 2007 and 2009, respectively. \n ", "9 \nC.  Poverty and Social \n28.  A  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  was  prepared.  As  a  general \nintervention, the investment program is expected to generate both direct and indirect poverty \nreduction impacts. Expected benefits to road and rail users include lower travel times and cost, \nand in the case of roads, lower vehicle operating costs, which will result in higher product profit \nmargins. Expanded access to improved roads and rail will help shift subsistence agriculture into \na more market-based one, allowing farmers to grow commercial products that can be shipped to \nmarkets more quickly. Farmers may also diversify, cultivate high-value crops, and grow larger \nmarketable surpluses to improve their income earning capacity. Connectivity will create more \nopportunities for people and businesses and widen access to social services. \n29.  A gender action framework was prepared to develop target activities to maximize the \nbenefits for communities and women along the program roads and rail links. Increased access \nto social services, economic opportunity, and consumer choice is expected to significantly \nincrease  the  welfare  of  women,  household  incomes,  achievement  of  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, and overall poverty reduction. \nD.  Safeguards  \n30.  The impacts of tranche 1 on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous \npeoples were assessed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). MPW \nhas prepared the required safeguards documents and mitigation measures in compliance with \nADB  procedures  and  requirements  for  consultation  and  disclosure  to  the  public.  \nThe government has further illustrated its collective institutional capacity and commitment by \nincreasing the number of qualified safeguards staff in the PMO and setting aside the funds \nrequired for land acquisition. \n31.  MPW prepared an environmental assessment and review framework, which sets out a \nframework for screening, categorization, impact assessment, management and monitoring for \nthe investment program. Tranche 1 subprojects are unlikely to result in significant adverse \nenvironmental  impact  and  potential  impacts  can  be  adequately  monitored  and  mitigated. \nTherefore, they are classified as environment category B. An initial environmental examination \nincorporating an environmental management and monitoring plan was prepared for each of the \nthree road sections included in tranche 1. The new Railway Project investments have minimal or \nno adverse environmental impacts and are classified as category C.  \n32.  MPW  prepared  a  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  for  the  investment \nprogram. Land acquisition and resettlement plans were prepared for each of the three road \nsections in tranche 1. The interventions are considered to be significant and are classified as \ncategory  A  for  involuntary  resettlement.  Following  approval,  these  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement plans were disclosed to the public on 19 July 2011. The government will finance \nland acquisition and ADB the associated resettlement costs. Changes to the Railway Project \nhave no involuntary resettlement impacts and therefore are classified as category C. No people \nwho can be defined as indigenous are in the project areas. As such, the indigenous people\u2019s \nclassification is category C, and indigenous peoples safeguard measures are not required.  \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n33.  Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk management plan. \nThe main risks include (i) implementation delays, and (ii) sustainability and reforms. Security \nalso remains an underlying concern for all work performed in Afghanistan.  \n ", "10   \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nSecurity  The  Ministry  of  Interior  will  provide  security  to  all  projects.  A  methodology  has  been \nestablished from past projects, with successful results.  \nReadiness  Project  readiness  will  be  increased  through  advancing  design  work,  safeguards  plans, \nprocurement of goods, works and services, funding for land acquisition and all internal \napprovals prior to ADB approving new tranches. Readiness will eliminate or reduce delays.  \nSustainability  Funding will be set aside for operations and maintenance. Planning will be improved, as well \nas budgeting, financial management, monitoring, evaluation and reporting. Reforms will be \naccelerated, including those leading to greater institutional effectiveness.  New approaches for \nproject management will be put in place, including outsourcing of supervision and monitoring.   \nADB = Asian Development Bank, MPW = Ministry of Public Works, PMO = program management office.  \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Ministry of Public Works of Afghanistan. \n \nIV.  UNDERTAKINGS AND ASSURANCES  \n34.  The  government  and  MPW  have  assured  ADB  that  implementing  the  investment \nprogram will conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as detailed \nin the facility administration manual and grant and/or loan documents. \n35.  The government has given ADB certain undertakings for the MFF, as described in the \nFFA. Specific covenants agreed to by the government and MPW, with respect to individual \ntranches under the MFF, are set forth in the grant and/or loan agreements for the respective \ntranches.  \nV.  RECOMMENDATION  \n36.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the provision of loans or grants and the administration of grants under the multitranche \nfinancing  facility  in  an  aggregate  principal  amount  not  exceeding  $787,000,000  equivalent \n(facility amount) to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the Transport Network Development \nInvestment Program comprising:  \n(i)  loans in various currencies or grants in an aggregate principal amount up to \n$754,000,000 equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with terms to be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s then applicable policies relating to Special \nFunds resources; and  \n(ii)  grants in an aggregate amount not exceeding the balance of the facility amount \nfrom the Afghanistan Infrastructure Trust Fund, with terms to be determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  then  applicable  policies  relating  to  the  Afghanistan \nInfrastructure Trust Fund, \nsubject to conditions set forth in paragraphs 16 and 17 of this report and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the framework financing \nagreement presented to the Board.  \n37.  I  also  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  a  deviation  from  the  existing  policy  as \ndiscussed in paragraph 19 of this report to allow the first tranche of the multitranche financing \nfacility to provide additional financing for the Hairatan to Mazar-e-Sharif Railway Project.  \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n30 August 2011 \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK
