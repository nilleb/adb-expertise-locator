The  widespread  destruction  included\nlooting,  burning,  and  damage  to  town  and  village  water  supplies\nand sanitation facilities throughout  the  country.    Typically  in  towns\nwith  public  water  supply  systems,  vehicles,  pumps,  and  motors\nwere removed; water treatment plants damaged; offices, stores and\nother  buildings  burned;  pipelines,  tools  and  spare  parts  stolen;\nstorage  tanks  ruptured;  latrines  and  septic  tanks  damaged;  and\nwater  sources  impaired.  And  with  the  burning  of  houses,  water\nconnections, including meters, were completely destroyed. None of\nthe  former  water  supply  or  sanitation  institutions  now  exist.\nTherefore it is essential to support physical repair and rehabilitation,\nand  reestablish  new  institutions  and  systems  for  managing,\noperating,  maintaining,  and  developing  urban  and  rural  water\nsupplies in East Timor that are both appropriate and sustainable.\n\nThe total needs for rehabilitation of the water supply and sanitation\n(WS&S) sector were estimated at US$39.9 million for the FY 2001-\n2003, with approximately US$12 million to 15 million expected from\nTrust Fund for East Timor (TFET) funds and the remaining balance\nfrom  other  sources.  However,  with  current  TFET  funds  being\nallocated across various sectors, only US$4.5 million can be made\navailable \nfollowing  Project  description\nfunds  available  (US$4.5  million).\ncorresponds \nDiscussions  with  the  United  Nations  Transitional  Administration  in\nEast  Timor  (UNTAET)  and  the  TFET  trustee  indicate  that  more\nfunds may become available in FY 2002, in which case a follow-up\nproject will be developed.\n\nfor  FY  2001.  The \n\nthe  TFET \n\nto \n\nThe  Project  will  (i)  develop  a  WS&S  sector  management  and\ninvestment  program  that  includes  establishment  of  a  project\nmanagement  unit  (PMU)  under  UNTAET\u2019s  Water  and  Sanitation\nAuthority  (WSA),  and  preparation  of  a  detailed,  budgeted,\nprogram  implementation  document  for  coordinated  improvement\nof  East  Timor\u2019s  WS&S  sector;  (ii)  implement  a  capacity  building\nand  institutional  development  program  that  will  identify  and\nimplement  priority  activities  to  support  physical  reconstruction\nalready under way or being planned, and to complement capacity-\nbuilding  and  institutional  development  activities  by  other  donors;\nand (iii) commence a WS&S implementation program, comprising\n(a)  the  WSA  WS&S  quick  response  facility,    (b)  complementary\nworks for Dili water supply repair and rehabilitation already under\nway by other donors, and (c) complementary works for the district\nwater supply repair and rehabilitation already under way by other\ndonors.\n\n\fBeneficiaries\n\nUrban and rural populations throughout East Timor will benefit.\n\niii\n\nThe  Project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B.  An  initial\nenvironmental examination was undertaken, and its summary is a\ncore appendix.\n\nThe  immediate  benefits  of  the  Project  include  (i)  providing  the\nmeans for improved WS&S, and (ii) upgrading the quality of life for\npeople  in both urban and  rural  areas  whose attempts  to  improve\ntheir  status  and  health  are  continually  impeded  by  the  need  to\ndivert  time,  energy,  and  financial  resources  to  acquire  their  daily\nwater needs. The Project will generate employment through local\nlabor,  thus  helping  to  create  a  stable  social  and  economic\nenvironment.  It  is  expected  that  the  Project  will  directly  or\nindirectly benefit a large part of the country's 800,000 population.\n\nThe  Project  is  designed  to  distribute  its  benefits  in  an  equitable\nmanner  across  East  Timorese  urban  and  rural  communtities,\ncontributing  to  sustainable  development  and  operation  in  the\nWS&S sector, and reducing poverty.\n\nUNTAET  will  be  the  recipient  of  the  grant  from  the  TFET.\nUNTAET  will  establish  within  WSA  a  PMU  that  reports  to  the\nUNTAET  infrastructure  cabinet  member  through  the  head  of\nPublic  Utilities  via  the  head  of  WSA.  The  PMU  will  program,\nadminister,  and  coordinate  daily  project  activities.    UNTAET  will\nalso  establish  a  project  steering  committee  involving  broad\nstakeholder representation.\n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  US$4.50  million\nequivalent.  The  Project  will  be financed on  a  grant  basis  entirely\nout  of  the  TFET.  These  funds  have  been  committed  by  donors;\nhowever, contributions to the TFET do not include ADB resources.\nThe  International  Development  Association  (IDA)  of  the  World\nBank Group is the trustee of the  TFET,  with  IDA  and  ADB  being\njoint implementing agencies.\n\nAll procurement under the Project will be conducted in accordance\nwith  ADB's  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  The  proceeds  of  the\nProject  will finance imports of goods and services, local purchases,\nand  civil  works \nthe  Project.  Under  ADB's\nguidelines,  these  may  be  procured  off  the  shelf,  or  through\ninternational  shopping,  local  competitive  bidding,  or  international\ncompetitive bidding, as appropriate. Eligibility for procurement and\nengagement  of  consultants  will  include  ADB  member  countries,\nEast Timor, and all other donors and members of organizations that\n\nidentified  under \n\nExecuting Agency\n\nCost Estimates and\nFinancing Plan\n\nPeriod of Utilization             Until 31 December 2001.\n\nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n\nProcurement\n\n30 June 2001.\n\n\fiv\n\nhave contributed to the TFET.\n\nInternational consulting services will be required for the PMU.

An ADB\nMission2    was  to  prepare  an  initial  emergency  rehabilitation  project  with  authorized  UNTAET\nrepresentatives.  The  agreements  reached  were  confirmed  in  a  memorandum  of  understanding.\nFunding for the Project will be drawn from the TFET, which is established under the trusteeship of\nthe  International  Development Association  (IDA) of  the World  Bank  Group.  The  TFET  does  not\ninclude  ADB's  own  resources.  The  Project  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  Joint\nManagement Arrangements for the Trust Fund for East Timor.3\n\nA.\n\nDescription of Damage\n\nIII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n3.\nOn  30  August  1999,  the  people  of  East  Timor  voted  overwhelmingly  for  independence.\nThe following month, East Timor experienced extensive destruction during which three quarters of\nthe population fled their homes, and most of the country\u2019s infrastructure and private homes were\ndestroyed.  In  the  western  half  of  the  territory  and  the  highland  areas,  most  property  of  value\nincluding residential and public buildings, utilities, telecommunications facilities, and inventories of\nessential  food  and  agriculture  stocks  were  removed,  burned,  or  destroyed.  The  eastern  half\nexperienced similar attacks with an estimated 75 percent of residential buildings destroyed.\n\n4.\nThe  widespread  destruction  included  looting,  burning,  and  damage  to  town  and  village\nwater  supply  and  sanitation  (WS&S)  facilities  throughout  the  country.    Typically  in  towns  with\npublic water supply systems, vehicles, pumps, and motors were removed; water treatment plants\ndamaged;  offices,  stores  and  other  buildings  burned;  pipelines,  tools  and  spare  parts  stolen;\nstorage tanks ruptured; latrines and septic tanks damaged; and water sources impaired.  And in\nthe burning of houses, water connections, including meters, were completely destroyed.\n\n5.\nElsewhere  in  peri-urban  and  rural  villages  throughout  the  countryside,  damage  to  water\nsupplies  was  not  extensive,  but  there  are  reports  of  wells  being  poisoned,  handpumps  stolen,\npipes removed, and spring intakes damaged.  Apart from the  physical damage  to  infrastructure,\nmost  water  WS&S  records  and  documentation  were  destroyed,  so  there  is  now  only  scant\n\n                                                       \n1  The Project first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in May 2000.\n2\n  The  Mission  comprised  Mr.  Walter  Poick,  Financial  Analyst  (Mission  Leader)  and  Mr.  Ian  Binch,  ADB  Staff\n\nConsultant.\n\n3  R74-00: Joint Management Arrangements for the Trust Fund for East Timor, 23 March 2000.\n\n\f2\n\ninformation available about past operations, the status of institutions, or the systems themselves.\nAdditionally, most former water supply managers have left East Timor.\n\n6.\nNone  of  the  former  water  supply  or  sanitation  institutions  now  exist.    The  challenge  for\nUNTAET will be to reinstate institutions and systems to manage, operate, maintain, and  develop\nurban and rural water supplies in East Timor that are both appropriate and sustainable; and that\nunlike before, do not burden future administrations with the need for recurrent cost subsidies from\nwhat, inevitably, will be very tight central budgets.\n\nB.\n\nResponse to the Crisis\n\n1.\n\nGovernance\n\n7.\nUNTAET was established on 25 October 1999 for an initial period until 31 January 2001\npursuant  to  Resolution  1272  (1999)  of  the  Security  Council  of  the  United  Nations  (UN),  with\npowers  to  ensure  stability  and  establish  a  transitional  government  and  judiciary,  laws,  and\npolicies. It is expected that the UNTAET transitional government will continue to administer East\nTimor  at  least  through  to  general  elections.  Governmental  responsibility  is  exercised  by  a\ntransitional  administrator,  who  since  July  2000  has  been  assisted  by  a  cabinet  consisting  of\neight portfolios, four of which are held by East Timorese and four by international UNTAET staff.\nThe cabinet is chaired by the transitional administrator, who is also the Special Representative\nof the Secretary-General (SRSG). The cabinet portfolios are as follows:\n\nPolice and Emergency Services,\nJustice,\nPolitical Affairs,\nFinance,\nInternal Administration,\nInfrastructure,\nEconomic Affairs, and\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n(viii)  Social Affairs.\n\nUNTAET's  financial  year  runs  from  1  July  to  30  June,  with  its  recurrent  budget  drawn\n\n8.\nfrom UNTAET's own Trust Fund using UN disbursement guidelines.\n\n9.\nEast  Timor  is  divided  into  13  districts  (including  the  enclave  of  Oecusso-Ambeno),  63\nsubdistricts,  and  442  villages.  An  UNTAET  district  administrator,  with  supporting  international\nand  local  staff  representing  the  range  of  sectoral  activities,  oversees  each  district.  There  are\nreportedly plans by  local  leaders  to  subdivide  the territory  into  three  regions after  transition to\nself-government. A key objective during the transition is to establish a small civil service with a\nlean administrative structure that can be sustained in the long term.\n\n10.\nThe capital development budget, to be drawn from the TFET, was assessed by a World\nBank-coordinated,  multiagency,  joint  assessment  mission  in  October-November  1999.  The\nmission  identified  needs  for  technical  assistance  and  investment  projects  in  consultation  with\nthe  National  Council  for  Timorese  Resistance  and  UNTAET.  The  mission  reviewed  WS&S\nsector  restoration  requirements  and  estimated \nthree-year  program  of\nreconstruction and recovery for water systems and  utilities  to be about  US$25  million,  and for\ndrainage and sanitation systems about US$8 million.\n\nthe  cost  of  a \n\n\f3\n\nThe NCC was established under UNTAET Regulation No. 1999/2 on 2 December 1999.\n11.\nIt  was  designed  as  a  mechanism  through  which  representatives  of  the  East  Timorese  people\ncould  actively  participate  in  the  decision-making  processes  during  UNTAET's  administration,\nand  through  which  the  views,  concerns,  traditions,  and  interests  of  the  East  Timorese  people\ncould be represented. The aim of the NCC was to provide advice on all matters related to the\nexercise  of  the  transitional  administrator's  executive  and  legislative  functions,  while  not\nprejudicing  the administrator's final authority.  The  NCC  has  now  been  replaced  by  a  National\nCouncil  (NC).  The  NC  has  33  members  drawn  from  the  following  areas:  13  district\nrepresentatives,  7  representatives  from  CNRT,  3  drawn  from  other  political  parties,  and  1\nrepresentative each from the youth/students, women's groups, Timorese  NGO forum,  Catholic\nchurch,  Protestant  church,  the  Muslim  community,  professional  associations,  farmers,  labor,\nand business.\n\n2.\n\nImpact of Crisis on Poverty\n\n12.\nIn 1996, when East Timor was part of Indonesia, its per capita income was US$431. The\nIndonesian  national  average  was  US$1,153.  Agriculture  continues  to  dominate  the  economy,\nwith some 76 percent of the national labor force involved in the sector. Subsistence agriculture,\nmainly  rice  and  corn  crops,  with  supplementary  coffee  and  beef  production,  dominates  the\nmodes  of  production.  As  a  result  of  the  1997  Asian  financial  and  economic  downturn,  gross\ndomestic  product  (GDP)  in  Indonesia,  including  East  Timor,  declined  as  devaluation  of  the\nIndonesian  rupiah  and  high  interest  rates  dampened  economic  activity.  Indonesia  was  the\ncountry  hit  hardest  by  the  Asian  downturn.  The  decline  in  East  Timor's  GDP  was,  however,\nmore  pronounced  due  to  its  dependence  on  Indonesian  central  government  grants,  which\nfinanced  up  to  85  percent  of  current  and  capital  expenditure.  Between  1997  and  the  1999\npopular consultation, East Timorese GDP contracted by  some  25  percent.  In  1998, per  capita\nincome  was  estimated  to  have  fallen  to  US$300,  among  the  lowest  in  the  Asian  and  Pacific\nRegion.\n\n13.\nAs  a  result  of  the  post-August  1999  violence,  both  public  and  private  sectors  suffered\nalmost total collapse. The planting season for 2000 was seriously disrupted due to destruction\nof field crops, subsequent labor shortages, and lack of access to seeds and tools. All of these\nmade the  social and economic development  challenge a  daunting one  that  could  be  met  only\nwith effective and substantial international assistance.\n\n14.\nIn  1996,  30  percent  of  East  Timorese  households  were  living  in  poverty\u2014double  the\nnational average in Indonesia. The number of households living below the poverty line rose to\nan estimated 50 to 60 percent as a result of the 1997 Asian downturn. The human dislocation\nand  destruction  that  occurred  consequent  to  East  Timor's  separation  from  Indonesia  has\nresulted  in  severe  disruption  to  the  essentially  subsistence  economy.  Although  an  estimated\n120,000  people have now  returned  to  their  villages,  many  face  severe  food  shortage  as  their\ncrops,  seeds,  and  other  means  of  livelihood  were  destroyed.  The  international  community,\nespecially the World Food Program, has been distributing food and seeds. Even the small East\nTimorese  middle  and upper groups  were  not  spared  from  poverty  as  banks  and  their  records\nwere  burned.  Indonesian  banks  exclusively  serviced  banking  in  East  Timor;  only  three  banks\nhave plans to reopen and possibly settle depositors' claims. Up to 80 percent of East Timorese\nmay  now  be  living  below  the  poverty  line.  However,  food  stability  will  improve  if  agriculture\nrecovers as expected this year. The World Food Program estimates that by the end of 2000, a\nconsiderable portion of the population will no longer be at risk, and the program will then be able\nto scale down its intervention.\n\n\f4\n\nC.\n\nWater Supply and Sanitation Sector\n\n15.\n\nA detailed sector profile is provided in Appendix 2.\n\n1.\n\nPreconsultation Water Supply and Sanitation Management\n\nUnder  Indonesian  administration,  public  water  supplies  were  controlled  by \n\n16.\nthe\nDirectorate  General  of  Human  Settlements  (DG  Cipta  Karya)  of  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works\nbased  in  Jakarta,  working  through  its  provincial  and  district  offices.    At  the  local  level,  public\npiped water supply systems were classified according  to  their  size  and financial  viability.    The\nhighest system was a local government water enterprise (PDAM).  A system was classified as a\nPDAM if it was able to internally generate sufficient revenue to be sustainable.  The only PDAM\nin East Timor was in Dili, and while it had recently graduated to PDAM status, it is understood to\nhave  still  needed  subsidization  from  the  central  government.    At  the  intermediate  level,  each\ndistrict  had  a district  water  board  (BPAM)  responsible for all  public piped  water supplies  in  its\ndistrict.  The  principle  was  that,  over  a  defined  time,  the  larger  district  town  systems  were\nsupposed to develop their management, administrative, and operation and maintenance skills to\nthe point where the BPAM could graduate to a PDAM.  In the meantime, all BPAM systems had\nto be subsidized from the central budget.  The base level of public water supplies were those in\nthe main subdistrict towns. The district BPAM  office  carried  out operation  and  maintenance of\nthe subdistrict town systems, which also required substantial subsidies.  Thus, prior to the crisis,\nno  public  water  supplies  in  East  Timor  were  financially  viable,  all  were  subsidized  from  the\ncentral budget.  And even with such support, water quality, coverage, and service reliability was\nuniversally poor.\n\n17.\nRural  water  supplies  and  all  sanitation  during  the  Indonesian  administration  were  the\nresponsibility of the Department of Health (Depkes).  At the subdistrict level, Depkes operated a\nsystem of \u201csanitarians\u201d working out of the local puskesmas, or community health center.  Their\nrole  included  helping  with  community  environmental  health  training  and  helping  villagers  with\ndevelopment  of  their  WS&S  facilities.    Despite  their  presence,  an  Australian  Agency  for\nInternational  Development  (AusAID)  design  team  noted  in  September  19994  that  there  was  a\ngenerally  low  level  of  service  provision  in  both  WS&S  throughout  the  rural  areas.    The  team\nconcluded  that  many  rural  communities  in  East  Timor  do  not  have  adequate  access  to  clean\nwater and that this is a significant factor contributing to the poor health and hygiene conditions\nin the villages.\n\n2.\n\nWater Supply Status\n\n18.\nIt has been estimated that prior to the postconsultation disruption, less than half of East\nTimor's total population had access to safe water and sanitation.  A recent census,  SUSENAS\n1998,5  indicated  the  access  to  various  forms  of  water  supply  was  approximately  as  shown  in\nTable 1:\n\n                                                       \n\n4   Coffey  MPW  Pty  Ltd., in  association  with  Egis  Consulting  Australia,  September  1999,  East  Timor  Environmental\nSanitation and Water Supply Project \u2013 Revised Project Design Document.

However, the quality of\nsystem construction was generally poor, and coverage was variable but low, commonly ranging\nfrom  about  25  to  40  percent  in  the  central  parts  of  towns.  Private  shallow  wells  were  used\nextensively in Dili and other towns, especially those near the sea or on river plains.  All 440 rural\nvillages  had  water  supplies  of  varying  type,  but  most  were  of  very  low  standard.  During  the\nviolence, damage to all public piped water systems was extensive but rural water supplies were\nnot  as  badly  affected.  When  hostilities  abated,  many  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)\nmoved into East  Timor  to  deliver humanitarian  assistance;  a number  specialized  in  water  and\nenvironmental  health.  Over  the  past  few  months,  these  NGOs  have  formed  the  core  of\nassistance  to  the  WS&S  sector,  providing  equipment,  materials,  and  personnel  to  make\nemergency  repairs,  mainly  to  piped  town  water  supplies  but  also  for  some  of  the  440  rural\nvillages  scattered  throughout  East  Timor.  This  work  is  being  done  in  collaboration  with  the\ndistrict administrators, who have hired employees of former water supply companies to help with\nrepairs,  operation,  and  maintenance.  By  May  2000,  water  supplies  in  most  of  the  13  district\ntowns, including Dili, had been reestablished, albeit in rudimentary form. Local and international\nNGOs  have  also  been  engaged  in  rehabilitating  rural  water  supplies;  providing  hand  pumps;\ncleaning  contaminated  wells;  and  repairing  pipes,  tanks,  and  the  like.  Overall,  public  water\nsupplies  in  towns  across  East  Timor  are  now  still  in  a  very  rudimentary  and  quite  precarious\ncondition,  although  for  the  most  part  some  water  is  available.  Historically  rural  communities\nhave not normally had acceptable water supplies, so even though they did not suffer too much\nin the crisis, most require rehabilitation and development.\n\nA piped and treated water supply system served approximately 8,200 households in Dili.\n20.\nThis was operated by the previous Indonesian PDAM (Dili Water Authority). The level of service\nwas less than satisfactory, with water often not available  and of  poor quality.  Customers  were\ncharged  Rp150  per  cubic  meter  for  household  supplies;  larger  consumers  were  charged  at\nhigher rates. Some 40-50 percent of Dili\u2019s population is estimated to have relied on poor quality\nwater from shallow wells in their yards. Since the disruption, the Water and Sanitation Authority\n(WSA), assisted by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Government\nof Australia, has employed staff and carried out system repairs.  Despite this, many areas of Dili\nstill experience daily water shortages, mainly through leakage from the poorly maintained pipe\nsystem.    Most  existing  district  reticulation  systems  are  in  need  of  repair  and  augmentation  to\nmeet the  needs of urban communities.   Water  losses because  of  leakage or  illegal  tapping  is\nvery high.\n\n\f6\n\n21.\nIn  other  district  and  subdistrict  towns  which  were  formerly  operated  by  the  previous\nBPAMs, average service coverage was in the low 20 to 30 percent range and water quality was\ngenerally unsatisfactory.    None of  the  more  than  60  piped  systems  provided  24-hour  service.\nCustomers  in  the  smaller  centers  were  charged  at  differing  rates,  generally  much  lower  than\nDili.\n\n3.\n\nSanitation Status\n\n22.\nEvidence suggests that at preconsultation,  the  excreta  disposal  situation  in  East  Timor\nwas already causing significant health problems. 1998 SUSENAS Table 2 illustrates the various\nexcreta disposal methods used:\n\nTable 2: Excreta Disposal Methods\n\nDisposal Method\n\nPrivate toilet with septic tank\nPrivate toilet without septic tank\nShared toilet\nPublic toilet\nDirect on cesspool\nBushes, forest, and yard\nPond\nRiver and stream\nOther\n\nApprox. % of Total\nEast Timor Population\nUsing Method\n10\n15\n6\n11\n23\n29\n\u2013\n4\n12\n\nApprox. % of\nDili Population\nUsing Method\n34\n23\n6\n1\n16\n7\n\u2013\n\u2013\n1\n\nSource:  Survai Sosial Economi Nasional, 1998.\n\n23.\nPostconsultation  disturbance  resulted  in  destruction  of  many  buildings  that  housed\ntoilets with or without septic tanks.  It did not greatly affect the traditional (i.e., nontoilet) facilities.\nThe overall effect of the destruction of both sanitation facilities and water supplies is that a far\ngreater number of persons are now using traditional methods. So far, little effort has been made\nto restore or improve environmental sanitation in either towns or villages.\n\n4.\n\nShort-Term Focus\n\n24.\nMuch  of  the  funding  for  the  emergency  phase  came  from  bilateral  and  multilateral\nsources. UNTAET has recently established the Water and Sanitation Authority (WSA) for East\nTimor. Staff are now being recruited, and operational funding obtained from the UNTAET Trust\nFund and bilateral and multilateral donors. As WSA\u2019s capacity increases, the NGOs are keen to\nhand  over  responsibility  for  public  WS&S,  and  to  focus  on  rural  WS&S,  which  is  their  main\ntarget area. None of the former water supply or sanitation institutions now exist.  The challenge\nfor UNTAET is twofold. First it will have to repair and rehabilitate the many damaged urban and\nrural WS&S facilities to an appropriate level of operation. Its second task will be to reestablish\ninstitutions and systems for managing, operating, maintaining, and  developing urban and rural\nwater  supplies  in  East  Timor  that  are  both  appropriate  and  sustainable.  These,  unlike  before,\nmust not burden future administrations with the need for subsidies from what, inevitably, will be\nvery tight central budgets.\n\n\f7\n\n5.\n\nMedium- to Long-Term Sector Development\n\n25.\nAn  ADB  mission  was  fielded  in  April  2000  to  develop  a  draft  sector  development\nframework for East Timor's water sector. This framework aims at  providing  the  people of East\nTimor  with  adequate  and  affordable  WS&S  services  using  appropriate  technology  and  good\nsystem management.  It proposed that this would be done by:\n\nbuilding local capacity and capability to effectively manage the WS&S sector;\n\nrehabilitating  and  developing  WS&S  facilities  in  urban  and  rural  communities;\nand\n\n(iii) \n\npromoting improved health, hygiene, and community participatory practices.\n\n26.\n\nThe draft sector framework recommends the following four strategic foci:\n\nA WS&S sector management and investment program would establish a Project\nManagement  Unit  (PMU)  and  prepare  a  detailed  program  implementation\ndocument.\n\nA  capacity  building  and  institutional  development  program  would  establish  the\nhuman and institutional framework necessary to complement the physical WS&S\nworks.\n\nA WS&S implementation program would cover repair and rehabilitation of urban\nand rural WS&S across East Timor.\n\nEnvironmental health promotion and strengthening of local NGOs would provide\nfor  health  promotion,  hygiene  education,  and\ncomplementary  programs \nstrengthening of local NGOs.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nIn  close  cooperation  with  the  East  Timorese,  other  donors,  and  stakeholders,  this\nframework and its four strategic foci will be reviewed, reassessed, and adjusted to current needs\nunder this Project.\n\n6.\n\nSector Management\n\na.\n\nUNTAET\u2019s Water and Sanitation Authority (WSA)\n\n27.\n  East Timor's water and power sectors are currently being managed and coordinated by\nUNTAET's  head  of  public  utilities,  a  position  that  sits  under  the  infrastructure  portfolio.  The\nvarious departments under the Cabinet Infrastructure group are public works; energy, water and\nsanitation;  transport  and  communications;  and  National  Institute  of  Cadaster  and  Geodesy.  A\nWSA (previously Office of Water and Sanitation) draft strategic plan and an organization chart\nare in Appendix 3.\n\n28.\nThe  recently  established  NC  is  expected  to  form  a  number  of  sectoral  committees  to\nassist and advise the Cabinet. Those covering  infrastructure,  health,  environment, and  natural\nresources are most relevant to the WS&S sector. In designing any program of rehabilitation and\nreconstruction for East  Timor, the  NC  and  its  relevant  committees  must be  consulted  and  the\nviews and experience of its constituent members taken into account.\n\n\f8\n\n29.\nThe WSA has recently been established as part of UNTAET\u2019s infrastructure portfolio under\nthe  Public  Utilities  department.  It  is  currently  staffed  by  nine  expatriate  and  56  local  personnel.\nThey are based in Dili, focusing on rehabilitation and operation of the town water supply system. A\nfurther 110  local staff  are  employed  by  district  administrators  in  districts  outside  Dili  working  as\nwater  supply  field  staff,  pump  and  water  treatment  plant  operators,  and    performing  other\noperation and maintenance duties. WSA plans to establish a presence in the main district towns\nas soon as supervisory staff become available.\n\nb.\n\nUNTAET's WSA Policies and Plans\n\n30.\nBeing in its early and formative stages, WSA is still developing policies and plans for the\nWS&S  sector.  WSA  has  already  considered  the  type  of  national  organizational  structure  that\nmight  be  appropriate  for  developing  and  managing  WS&S  in  East  Timor,  and  prepared  a  draft\nstrategic plan with the following mission statement:\n\nTo  ensure  the  communities  of  East  Timor  have  access  to  such  water  and\nsanitation services as are considered essential for public health, protection of the\nenvironment and for promotion of economic growth.\n\n31.\n\nThe plan identifies seven key result areas and their objectives:\n\n(i)\n\nPolicy and Planning: Plan, develop policy, and organize for the achievement of the\nmission  statement.  Measure  and  report  to  Government  on  progress  to  achieve  the  mission\nstatement.\n\n(ii)\n\nWater Resources: Assess, control the use of, and protect the water  resources of\n\nEast Timor.\n\n(iii) \n\nPublic Water Supply: Provide adequate, safe,  and  sustainable  water  supplies  for\nthe communities of Dili and major urban centers in the districts, with the long-term goal of full cost\nrecovery from users of the water supply services.\n\n(iv) \n\nCommunity  Water  Supply:  Facilitate  at  the  national  level,  the  promotion  of\nadequate, safe, and sustainable water supplies for village communities through community-owned\nand -managed water supply systems.\n\n(v) \n\nSewage  and  Wastewater:  Facilitate  at  the  national  level,  the  safe  disposal  of\n\nsewage and wastewater in urban areas.\n\n(vi) \n\nUrban Drainage: Facilitate at the national level, the collection and safe disposal of\n\nnuisance surface waters from major urban areas.\n\n(vii) \n\nSolid Waste: Facilitate at the national level, the collection and safe disposal of solid\n\nand hazardous waste from major urban areas.\n\nD.\n\nExternal Assistance and Donor Coordination\n\nDetails of committed and potential external assistance to the WS&S sector are given in\n\n32.\nAppendix 4.\n\n\f9\n\n1.\n\nEmergency Phase\n\n33.\nPostcrisis rehabilitation of both urban and rural water supplies is ongoing, with key inputs\nfrom  ICRC,  UN agencies, NGOs, Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA),  AusAID,  and\nUNTAET through its district administration offices and WSA.  This work has been, and  remains,\nfocused  principally  on  emergency  repairs  to  key  water  supply  infrastructure  and  maintaining\nsystems in a fairly basic operating condition.\n\nInternational  NGOs:  ICRC,  Care  International,  Oxfam  International,  Action Contra Faim,\n34.\nand local NGOs: Bia Hula, Forte, and Hamoris Timor Oan (HTO) are the main NGOs involved in\nthe WS&S sector. Supported by their internal resources and bilateral and multilateral donors, they\nhave been at  the  cutting  edge of the emergency  restoration  phase,  working  on  both  urban  and\nrural  water  supplies and, to a  lesser extent,  sanitation. The  international  NGOs have  been,  and\nare still, working very closely with UNTAET district administrations on operation and maintenance\nof urban water supply systems.  However, as the emergency phase comes to a conclusion, many\nhave expressed the desire to hand over the urban systems to UNTAET\u2019s WSA to allow the NGOs\nto concentrate  more on  rural development, which they consider to  be  their  area  of  comparative\nadvantage.\n\nAt the commencement of  the humanitarian  assistance  phase,  it  was  UNTAET\u2019s district\n35.\nadministrators,  with  assistance  from  NGOs  and  their  donors  that  commenced  WS&S\nemergency rehabilitation. They have engaged about 110 local staff (former employees of water\nentities) to undertake repairs, operation, and maintenance in a number of district towns outside\nDili.  Now  that  the  WSA  is  becoming  better  established,  and  the  country  is  moving  from  the\nhumanitarian to the  development  phase,  it  is expected that WSA  will  systematically  take  over\nthe  WS&S  operations  in  major  district  town  centres  from  NGOS.  In  the  meantime,  they  are\nconcentrating  on  repairs,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  the  Dili  water  supply,  again  with\nassistance  from  ICRC  and  others.  WSA  will  form  the  basis  for  a  new  water  supply  and\nsanitation authority in East Timor, and is now planning for that transformation.\n\n36.\nThe  United  Nations  International  Children's  Fund  (UNICEF)  has  been  involved  in  the\nemergency  phase,  supplying  electric  pumps  and  handpumps  to  peri-urban  and  rural  areas  in\ncooperation with NGOs. Activities based on their emergency funds from the European Community\nHumanitarian Organization  will extend through until about November 2000.  Thereafter,  UNICEF\nhas  developed  plans  to  encourage  local  entrepreneurs,  to  promote  hygiene  education  at  the\nvillage level to encourage development and proper use of improved water supply and sanitation\nfacilities. They propose that the former system of Department of Health \"sanitarians\" be used as\ncatalysts in this process. Funding for this activity is being sought.\n\n2.\n\nRehabilitation and Reconstruction\n\n37.\nJapan  is  currently  completing,  at  a  cost  of  about  $2.0  million,  asset  mapping  and  water\nsupply master planning in 15 district towns, including Dili. It has also allocated about US$930,000\nfor a number of quick impact projects (e.g., repairs to the Manatuto transmission pipeline; leakage\ncontrol in Dili; and rehabilitation of water supply systems in 10 schools).  Additionally, the water-\ntesting  laboratory  established  during  the  master  planning  exercise  has  been  donated  to\nUNTAET's  WSA.  Further,  the  Japanese  Government  has  proposed  an  allocation  of  some  $10\nmillion for rehabilitation of the Dili water supply system.  Japanese consultants will implement this\nwork  through  United  Nations  Development  Program  (UNDP)-United  Nations  Office  of  Project\nServices  (UNOPS).  Dili  water  supply  rehabilitation  is  planned  for  implementation  over  2  years\n\n\f10\n\ncommencing about June 2000.   Japan  is also  reportedly  considering funding  rehabilitation of all\n14 town water supplies (in addition to Dili) in three consecutive packages of 4-5 towns each, with\nthe first package commencing in early 2001.\n\nThe  Government  of  Portugal  has  committed  US$1.5  million  in  2000  for  repair  and\n38.\nrehabilitation of the Baucau and Aileu town systems, and to provide technical back-up support for\nthe  organization  and  management  of  the  proposed  water  authority  for  East  Timor,  as  it  affects\nareas  in  which  Portugal  is  involved.  The  budget  also  covers  preparation  of  a  sanitation  and\ndrainage master plan and a solid waste management plan, principally for Dili. Implementation of\nthis work has commenced through the auspices of UNDP-UNOPS.\n\n39.\nAusAID  is  also  involved  in  the  WS&S  sector.  During  the  emergency  period,  AusAID\nsupported local and international NGOs (e.g., Bia Hula, Oxfam, Care, etc.) and provided a facility\nthrough the Northern Territory Department of Power and Water by which equipment and materials\nwere able to be procured quickly and technical assistance provided. AusAID is currently providing\nfurther technical assistance to WSA through staffing assistance and plans to continue supporting\nWSA and NGOs with technical assistance, training, and equipment. It has also expressed interest\nin  participating  in  WS&S  institutional  development,  capacity  building,  environmental  health\nprograms, and district WS&S implementation using the community participation approach. To this\nend, AusAID has allocated A$ 5.5 million for FY 2001 for the WS&S sector.  Specific activities will\nbe developed by a design team mission to be fielded in July or August 2000.\n\n3.\n\nDonor Coordination\n\nThe  Project  is  fully  coordinated  with  donors  involved  in  restoration  and  rehabilitation\n40.\nsupport  in  the  WS&S  sector  in  East  Timor.  As  restoration  of  the  WS&S  sector  is  essentially\nstarting  anew,  it  is  imperative  that  a  clear  and  recognized  system  for  coordinating  activities\nthroughout  East  Timor  be  established  as  soon  as  possible.  Consequently,  one  of  the  principal\nobjectives  of  this  Project  is  to  facilitate  establishment  of  an  agreed  program  of  work  for  repair,\nrehabilitation,  and  management  of  WS&S  in  East  Timor.  Such  a  program  will  then  provide\nUNTAET and its development partners, including all donors and potential donors, with guidelines\nand a structure to coordinate their investments in the sector. WSA is the obvious focus for policy\nsetting,  planning,  coordination,  management,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  of  all  WS&S  activities,\nand is already preparing itself for this task. This Project will support WSA in its management and\ncoordination roles.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE REHABILITATION ASSISTANCE\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\nUNTAET is executing a program of humanitarian assistance in East Timor, part of which\n41.\ninvolves  rehabilitation  of  WS&S  facilities  damaged  during  the  September  1999  crisis.  The\nchallenge, however,  is not  just  a  matter  of  restoring  the  facilities  to  their  precrisis  status,  but  to\nmake  sure  sustainability  and  cost  recovery  can  be  achieved  in  the  postcrisis  environment.  All\nformer  WS&S  institutions  are  now  defunct;  offices,  stores,  equipment,  workshops,  and  records\nwere  removed,  burned,  or  otherwise  destroyed;  and  most  managerial  and  administrative\npersonnel have departed East Timor.  Added to this is the fact that the standard of most precrisis\nwater supply and  sanitation facilities throughout the country,  both  urban   and  rural,   was   well\nbelow  commonly  accepted  levels. UNTAET  is  faced  not  just  with  making  some perfunctory\nrepairs.    It  must  (i)  establish  completely  new  institutional  arrangements  for  WS&S;  (ii)  develop,\nfrom  a  low base,  the  human  capacity  to manage,  operate,  and  maintain  the systems; (iii)\n\n\f11\n\nrehabilitate  and  reconstruct  WS&S  facilities  to  acceptable standards  and  levels  of   service;\nand  (iv) at  the  same  time,  prepare for transition to East Timorese self-government. The ADB\nmission estimated the total needs to  rehabilitate the WS&S sector at US$39.9  million; however,\nwith current TFET funds being allocated across various sectors, an amount of only US$4.5 million\ncan be made available for the FY 2001. Discussions with UNTAET and the TFET trustee indicate\nthat  more  funds  may  become  available  in  FY  2002,  in  which  case  a  follow-up  project  will  be\ndeveloped.\n\nThe Project\u2019s overall strategic goal is to provide the people of East Timor with adequate,\n42.\naffordable, and sustainable WS&S services using appropriate technology and good management\nsystems. It will do this by (i) building local capacity and capability to effectively manage the WS&S\nsector; (ii) rehabilitating and reconstructing water supply and sanitation facilities in urban and rural\ncommunities;  and  (iii)  promoting  improved  environmental  health,  hygiene,  and  community\nparticipatory practices.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives\n\n43.\nThe Project will (i) develop a WS&S sector management and investment program, which\nincludes the establishment of a PMU under UNTAET's WSA and the preparation of a detailed,\nbudgeted  PID  for  coordinated  improvement  of  East  Timor's  WS&S  sector;  (ii)  implement  a\ncapacity building and institutional development program that will identify and implement priority\nactivities  to  support  physical  construction  already  under  way  or  being  planned,  and  to\ncomplement  capacity  and  institutional  development  activities  by  other  donors;  and  (iii)\ncommence  implementation  of  the WS&S  implementation  program  that  will  include  (a)  a WSA\nWS&S Quick Response Facility, (b) complementary works for the Dili Water Supply Repair and\nRehabilitation already underway by other donors, and (c) complementary works for the District\nWater Supply Repair and Rehabilitation already under way by other donors.\n\nC.\n\nScope\n\n44.\n\nThe Project has three components.\n\n1.\n\nComponent 1: WS&S Sector Management and Investment Program\n\n45.\nThe  purpose  of  this  component  is  to  quickly  establish  an  integrated  WS&S  sector\nmanagement  and  investment  program  for  East  Timor.  Preparatory  arrangements,  including\ntentative recruitment and logistical planning will be undertaken by UNTAET (WSA) to enable work\nto commence in East Timor on or about 1 September 2000. Component 1 comprises two parts.\nThe first is to establish a PMU under UNTAET\u2019s WSA to assist with program implementation. The\nsecond part is to prepare a detailed work program to guide PMU activities over the next year and\nbeyond.  The  work  program  will  be  prepared  over  three  months  between  September  and\nDecember  2000.  Key  activities  of  the  work  program  will  include  infrastructure  repair  and\nrehabilitation,  preparation  of  integrated  plans  for  human  resources  development,  institutional\ndevelopment,  tariff  proposals,  asset  management  policies  and  procedures,  WS&S  standards,\nmanagement  and  financial  information  system,  legal  and  regulatory  framework,  community  and\ngender  development,  environmental  health  and  hygiene  promotion,  water  resources  protection,\nand  the  transition  from  UNTAET  to  East  Timorese  self-rule.  The  outcome  will  be  a  detailed,\nbudgeted PID for coordinated improvement of East Timor\u2019s WS&S sector. These documents will\nguide  WSA  and  the  PMU  in  program  implementation  as  well  as  overall  coordination  and\nmanagement of the WS&S sector in East Timor.\n\n\f12\n\n2.\n\nComponent 2: Capacity-Building and Institutional Development Program\n\n46.\nThe  Project  will,  in  coordination  with  WSA  and  relevant  bilateral  donors,  identify  and\nimplement priority capacity building  and  institutional development activities.   These activities  will\nbe specifically designed to support physical WS&S construction already completed, under way, or\nplanned,  and  complement  capacity-building  and  institutional  development  activities  by  donors.\nDetails and priorities will be identified in the PID. Capacity-building and institutional development\nactivities  include  support  for  the  WS&S  quick  response  facility  (para.  47);  rehabilitation  of\nworkshops,  stores,  generator  sheds,  and  other  infrastructure  essential  to  WS  operations;  and\nprocurement  of  supplies,  equipment,  communications,  and  other  facilities  fundamental  to  water\nand sanitation operation. Special attention  will be given  to the  capacity-building  and  institutional\ndevelopment needs of Dili, Baucau, Aileu, and other priority towns.\n\n3.\n\nComponent 3: Water Supply and Sanitation Implementation Program\n\na.\n\nComponent 3.1: WSA WS&S Quick Response Facility\n\n47.\nThe  quick  response  facility  will  be  utilized  to  support  WSA  in  undertaking  urgent,\nsubstantial  repairs  to,  and  rehabilitation  of,  water  supplies  across  all  13  districts  of  East  Timor.\nBecause the use of the facility will be determined by need, it is designed to be sufficiently flexible\nto respond promptly to urgent needs as they emerge. This is vital in the postcrisis environment of\nEast Timor, where the people\u2019s needs go beyond all developmental norms. In this unique setting,\nthe Project has an obligation to ensure that its approach is designed not to exacerbate the social\nand human problems already faced by the East Timorese people. The ability to respond rapidly to\nthe  people\u2019s  urgent  water  supply  needs  is  seen  as  a  positive  expression  of  recognition,  by  the\nProject, of their dire situation. Likely activities which the facility will undertake include procurement\nof  pipes,  fittings,  and  other  water  supply  componentry;  local  contracts  to  undertake  substantial\nrepairs  and  rehabilitation;  and  related  procurement  transport,  earthmoving  and  excavation\nservices. The key purpose of the facility is to provide WSA with the capacity to quickly respond to\nthe East Timorese people\u2019s most urgent water supply repair and rehabilitation needs. Allowance\nhas been made for the facility to operate for 10 months from 1 September 2000.\n\nb.\n\nComponent 3.2: Dili Water Supply Repair and Rehabilitation\n\n48.\nThe  Japanese  government  has  proposed  to  allocate  US$10  million  for  the  Dili  Water\nSupply & Sanitation Rehabilitation Design and Construction Project. Implementation of the water\nsupply  element  will  be  by  UNDP-UNOPS  through  a  Japanese  consulting  firm.  This  work  is\nexpected  to  commence  around  mid-2000  and  extend  over  two  years.  Works  proposed  include\nimproving  the  main  raw  water  source;  strengthening  the  raw  water  transmission  pipeline;\nexpanding the water treatment plant at Bemos; and completing minor work on the treated water\ntransmission main. TFET Project funding, among others, has been  allocated for  complementary\nworks that include network rehabilitation and zoning near the transmission main from the Bemos\nwater treatment plant; replacement of unserviceable asbestos-cement mains in central Dili where\nhigh leakage occurs, and associated/connecting pipework; and urban and  periurban low-income\nworks such as repairs and rehabilitation of public taps and other watering points. Actual works will\nbe  determined by WSA in  conjunction  with the Japanese-funded project  managers to  maximize\nthe synergy of the respective works.  The aim of this component is to build on the upstream works\nby  Japan,  by  improving  water  service  to  customers  and  expanding  the  number  of  customers\nserved as an essential prelude to system sustainability.\n\n\f13\n\n49.\nAdditionally, there are other areas of Dili\u2019s water supply system outside the influence of the\nJapanese funded works that will benefit greatly from TFET funding. For example, in a number of\ninstances,  rehabilitation  of  deep  bores  and  associated  pumps  and  distribution  systems  would\ndirectly  benefit  some  thousands  of  people.  Such  areas  would  be  identified  and,  depending  on\nWSA priorities, considered for TFET funding under component 3.2.\n\nAllowance  has  been  made  for  such  complementary  and  supplementary  rehabilitation\n\n50.\nworks to be carried out over a nine months period from 1 October 2000.\n\nc.\n\nComponent 3.3: District Water Supply Repair and Rehabilitation\n\nThe  district  water  supply  and  sanitation  program  is  designed  to  address  the  needs  of\n51.\nsmaller urban and rural communities throughout the 13 districts of East Timor.  While the system\nrepair  of  major  district  towns  can  be  implemented  individually,  if  necessary,  it  is  proposed  that\nsmaller town and village systems be managed as programs and implemented geographically as\ndistricts,  or  groups  of  districts.  This  approach  will  provide  flexibility  within  the  emerging\ngovernance and community capacity strategies currently being developed under  the  Community\nEmpowerment  and  Local  Governance  Project  and  should  make  the  logistics  of  implementation\nmuch  easier.  The  opportunity  also  then  exists  for  interested  donors  to  undertake  town  and\ncommunity  WS&S  development  within  one  or  more  districts,  to  enhance  logistics  and  improve\ndonor coordination.  Within each district, it is expected that a coordinated approach to addressing\nsustainable WS&S equitably between towns and villages will be developed utilizing processes of\nenvironmental  health,  gender  awareness,  and  community  participation  and  planning.  Interested\ndonors may package district WS&S programs to suit their circumstances, and implement them by\nmanaging  agents  working  in  partnership  with  local  and  international  NGOs  and  community\ngroups.\n\nIn  support  of  this  program,  the  Project  has  allowed  funding  to  address  the  most  urgent\n52.\nneeds of a number of those districts, and those that are not receiving bilateral assistance.  Exact\npriorities  will  need  to  be  identified  by  UNTAET  when  donor  intentions  are  firmer,  but  current\nindications from the East  Timorese  counterparts  suggest  that  the  border  districts  of  Kova-Lima,\nBobonaro, and Oecusse, where destruction was greatest,  are of high priority for TFET or donor\nsupport.  Liquica  District  too  has  been  identified  as  an  area  of  much  need,  where  repair  and\nrehabilitation  works  could  yield  quick  and  effective  results.  As  an  example,  in  Liquica  township,\nthe  primary  river  intake  and  transmission  pipeline  is  extensively  damaged  and  is  now\nunserviceable.  A potential alternative to repairing the transmission main would be to rehabilitate\nexisting (but non-operational) bores as a  new raw  water source.  The PID  will  include a detailed\nand  prioritized  list  for  funding  under  component  3.3.  Typically,  works  to  be  undertaken  under\ncomponent 3.3 include procurement and installation of pipes, fittings, pumps, motors, generators,\nand supply of construction  materials; contracts for  design services  for  small-  and  medium-scale\nwater supply engineering works; hiring of construction equipment and transport; development of\ncontracts  for  rehabilitation  of  water  bores;  rehabilitation  of  raw  water  intakes;  and  provision  of\nsupport services such as water quality testing and groundwater pumping tests.\n\nAllowance  has  been  made  for  these  complementary  works  to  be  carried  out  over  nine\n\n53.\nmonths from 1 October 2000.\n\n\fD.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n14\n\n54.\nThe total cost of the Project  is estimated at US$4.50 million  equivalent,  and  includes  all\ncosts from September 2000 until the end of UNTAET's FY 2001. Table 3 provides a summary of\nthe cost estimates for the Project, which are outlined in more detail in Appendix 5.\n\nTable 3: Summary of Project Costs\n(US$ million)\n\nComponents\n\nTotal Cost\n\nA.

These  estimates  have  been  reassessed  by  the  ADB\nmission  and  are  now  expected  to  cost  US$39.9  million,  with  approximately  US$12million-15\nmillion coming from TFET funds and the remaining balance from other funding sources.\n\n                                                       \n6  An amount of US$ 4.5 million has been earmarked in the TFET budget for FY 2001 for the WS&S sector.\n7    The  mission  was  coordinated  by  the  World  Bank  and  undertook  its  fieldwork  from  26  October  to  12  November\n1999. ADB  participated in the mission,  along  with  a number  of  other  bilateral  and multilateral  aid agencies. East\nTimorese counterparts also participated in each of the mission's sector teams.\n\n\f15\n\nThe  Project  only  covers  initial  rehabilitation  of  the  WS&S  sector  for  10-15  months,\n57.\ncommencing 1 September 2000. It is expected that a broader TFET-funded WS&S rehabilitation\nproject will be developed for the next two fiscal years (1 July 2001-30 June 2003) if more TFET\nfunds become available in FY 2002 for this purpose.\n\nF.\n\nExecuting Agency\n\n58.\nUNTAET  will be  the  recipient  of  the  grant  from  the  TFET.  It  will  establish  a  PMU  within\nWSA  that  reports  to  the  UNTAET  Infrastructure  Cabinet  Member,  through  the  head  of  public\nutilities  via  the  head  of  WSA.  The  PMU  will  program,  administer,  and  coordinate  daily  project\nactivities.  All  activities  will  be  done  in  close  cooperation  with  WSA,  multi-  and  bilateral  donors,\nNGOs, community groups, and other stakeholders.  In particular, works and activities funded out\nof  the  TFET  will  be  fully  integrated  with  donor-funded  activities  and  projects.  The  PMU  will  be\nfunded under the Project. The PMU will be headed by an East Timorese project manager (WS&S\nengineer) and comprise an East  Timorese project accountant and  one  community  development\nspecialist.  The  selection  of  these  will  be  subject  to  ADB  approval.  Two  internationally  recruited\nconsultants  will  support  the  project  manager:  a  chief  technical  adviser  (CTA)  and  a  community\ndevelopment specialist. Total international consulting comprises 37.5 person-months: 20 person-\nmonths  for  the  PMU  and  17.5  for  preparation  of  the  PID.  The  CTA  will  support  the  project\nmanager  in administering the Project and  its  contracts  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines.  The\nCTA  and  community  development  specialist,  in  coordination  with  WSA  staff,  will  program  and\ncoordinate  daily  project  activities,  including  design,  supervision,  procurement  of  goods  and\nservices,  and  management  of  civil  works  contracts.  The  international  consultants  will  train  East\nTimorese counterparts in their area of responsibility. An organization chart of the PMU, and terms\nof  reference of the PMU and the consulting team for  preparation  of  the  PID  are  in  Appendix  6.\nUnder the organization framework of UNTAET, the PMU will be an integral part of WSA and be\nabsorbed within it.\n\nG.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1.\n\nTechnical Approach\n\nlabor-intensive,\n59. Where  possible, \nemployment-generating  methodologies.  Least-cost  methodologies  will  be  adopted  for  the\ntechnical solutions. These include maximum use of local labor, materials, and contractors, and\nsimple technologies contributing to sustainability of these works.\n\nthe  works  under \n\nthe  Project  will \n\nincorporate \n\n2.\n\nSteering Committee\n\n60.\nUNTAET  will  establish  a  project  steering  committee  involving  broader  stakeholder\nrepresentation in project implementation. The steering committee will be convened prior to project\nimplementation  to  inform the stakeholders of  project  activities.  The  steering  committee  will  then\nmeet  monthly  to  discuss  and  resolve  emerging  project  implementation,  procurement,  and\ncommunity issues, and to review and comment on the project reports for submission to ADB.\n\n3.\n\nProcurement of Goods and Services\n\nAll procurement under the Project will be conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines\n61.\nfor Procurement.   The proceeds of the Project  will  finance  imports  of  goods  and  services,  local\npurchases,  and  civil  works  identified  under  the  Project.  Under  ADB  Guidelines,  these  may  be\nprocured off the shelf, or through international shopping, local competitive bidding, or international\n\n\f16\n\ncompetitive bidding, as appropriate. The PMU and WSA will coordinate with the donor community\nto  ensure,  as  far  as  possible,  that  materials  and  equipment  are  compatible  and  of  appropriate\ntechnology  and  quality;  that  spare  parts  are  readily  available  at  a  fair  price;  and  that  common\nstandards and levels of service are used in all WS&S projects in East Timor. Consulting services\nwill be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\n\n62.\nThe term member countries under these guidelines for purposes of this Project will include\nADB  member  countries, East  Timor, and  all donors and  members of  international  organizations\nthat have contributed funds to the TFET.8\n\n4.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nThe project will be implemented over 10-15 months, commencing in September 2000 and\n63.\nfinishing in June 2001. Every quarter, the PMU will  prepare a detailed  implementation  schedule\nfor  project  activities.  Selection  of  project  implementation  consultants  and  contractors  will\ncommence  in  accordance  with  activity  priorities  in  the  implementation  schedule,  upon  project\napproval, and when the Grant Agreement is signed.  The concurrent first priorities are to establish\nthe PMU and for the consulting team to prepare the PID. Significant advance preparation by WSA\nis  planned  to  ensure  these  teams  are  fielded  by  September  2000.  The  consulting  team  will\nprepare  a  detailed  PID  with  an  updated  implementation  schedule,  establish  real  and  realistic\npriorities,  and  refine  cost  estimates.  The  PID  will  cover  three  years,  2000-2003,  in  detail.  The\ninitial project implementation schedule is shown in Appendix 7.\n\n5.\n\nRights-of-Way\n\n64.\nUNTAET has stated that most of the works under the Project are within existing rights-of-\nway.  UNTAET  will, if needed, acquire  or  obtain  rights  to  any  land  required  on  a  timely  basis  in\naccordance  with  ADB's  resettlement  policy9  and  provide  compensation  (including  for  crops),  as\nrequired,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  relevant  guidelines.  Detailed  designs  will  minimize  land\nacquisition. It is expected that the Project will not require any resettlement.\n\n6.\n\nDisbursement Procedures\n\n65.\nAs agreed upon by IDA, disbursements for eligible expenditures will be made pursuant to\nADB\u2019s disbursement guidelines set out in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook and may be made\nas direct payment or reimbursement, or through an imprest account. The imprest account will be\nreplenished  in  accordance  with  the  handbook.  The  CTA  will  be  responsible  for  transactions,\nreplenishments, and use of the imprest account. Payments under these agreements will be made\nby IDA, based on ADB\u2019s request.\n\n7.\n\nDirect Payment\n\n66.\nUnder the direct purchase procedure,  the  PMU  will  ask  ADB  for  a  direct  payment  to  be\nmade  to the supplier of goods and services. ADB  will  authorize the  request and  send  it  to  IDA,\nwhich will pay the supplier directly.  Payment will be requested using ADB\u2019s standard withdrawal\n\n                                                       \n8 R74-00: Joint Management Arrangements for the Trust Fund for East Timor, 23 March 2000 \u2013 an arrangement for\nthe  TFET  and  an  expansion  of  eligibility  under  ADB\u2019s  procurement  and consulting  services  guidelines  to  include\nmember  countries,  East  Timor,  and  all  donors  and  members  of  international  organizations  that  have  provided\ncontribution funds to the TFET.\n\n9 ADB, 1989. The Bank's Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, Appendix 1 in Handbook on Resettlement.\n\nManila.\n\n\f17\n\napplication.    The  PMU  will  indicate  in  the  withdrawal  application  the  date  on  which  payment\nbecomes  due  to  the  supplier.  A  separate  application  should  be  filled  out  for  each  currency  in\nwhich the payment is requested. The application should be submitted with supporting documents\nsuch as contracts, invoices, receipts, and vouchers. This procedure will be used for payment of (i)\nconsultants'  fees,  and  (ii)  equipment  and  civil  works  contracts  awarded  on  the  basis  of\ninternational competitive bidding. Copies of signed contracts will be forwarded to ADB as early as\npossible to facilitate timely payments.\n\n8.\n\nReimbursement Procedures\n\n67.\nThe  reimbursement  procedure  will  be  used  when  eligible  expenditures  are  paid  from\nUNTAET\u2019s  budget  and  reimbursement  claimed  through  ADB  from  the  TFET.  Withdrawal\napplications with supporting documents and summary sheets of expenditures will be prepared by\nthe  PMU,  and  payments  will  be  made  to  UNTAET  by  IDA  based  on  ADB\u2019s  authorization.  The\nreimbursement procedure will be used for payment of (i) small purchases and (ii) short-term civil\nworks contracts.\n\n9.\n\nImprest Fund\n\n68.\nUnder the imprest account fund procedure, ADB will ask IDA to advance funds to the PMU\nto meet subproject expenditures to prefinance payments to contractors and suppliers. The imprest\naccount  will  be  used  for  short-term  civil  works,  small-scale  design  and  supervision  services,\nremuneration  of  East  Timorese  staff,  and  small  purchases  under  all  cost  categories  eligible  for\nfinancing.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure  procedure  will  be  used  for  reimbursement  of\nexpenditures and  for  the  liquidation  of  the  imprest  account  for  payments  with  value  equal  to  or\nbelow  US$10,000  each.  The  currency  of  the  imprest  account  will  be  the  US  dollar  and  the\nmaximum initial advance will be US$450,000. The CTA supported by the PMU will be responsible\nfor  administrative  and  accounting  tasks  under  the  Project  and  will  establish  adequate  internal\ncontrol, accounting, and audit  procedures to ensure efficient  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  its\noperation.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established  in  Darwin,  Australia  or  in  Dili,  East  Timor,\nsubject to ADB's approval.\n\n10.\n\nReporting\n\n69.\nUNTAET,  with  the  support  of  the  PMU,  will  furnish  ADB  with  quarterly  progress  reports\nconcerning all aspects, including finances, procurement of services, equipment, and all civil works\nin the Project, including bilateral activities. The PMU will prepare quarterly expenditure budgets a\nmonth prior to the commencement of the following quarter. UNTAET, with the support of the PMU,\nwill  also  provide  quarterly  reports  on  the  use  of  the  recurrent  UNTAET  water  and  sanitation\nbudget,  including  activities  and  expenditures;  and  report  progress  in  implementing  policy\ninitiatives,  WS&S  regulations,  and  organizational  changes.  The  PMU  will  also  prepare  a  final\nproject  completion  report  on  all  aspects  of  the  Project  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  relevant\nguidelines one month prior to physical completion of the Project.\n\n11.\n\nAccounts\n\n70.\nThe PMU will establish the necessary accounts in Dili, if possible, and in Darwin, Australia\nif required.  These bank accounts will be under  the  control of the  CTA.  The PMU will establish\nand  maintain  separate  accounts  for  all  eligible  expenditures  under  the  Project,  including  its\nindividual contracts and other project components.  The PMU will furnish ADB with accounts and\nrelated  financial  statements  prepared  in  accordance  with  international  or  other  appropriate\n\n\f18\n\naccounting standards. Auditors acceptable to ADB will then audit these financial statements. The\naudited financial statements together with the auditor\u2019s report will be forwarded to ADB within six\nmonths of the end of each fiscal  year.    The  PMU  consultants  will  keep  detailed  records  on  the\ncosting and expenditures of the project components and will assist with reporting.\n\n12.\n\nTechnical Midterm Review\n\n71.\nIn addition to a schedule of regular reviews to monitor project progress, a technical review\nof  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  six  months  after  mobilization.  The  focus  of  the  review  is  to\ndetermine  the need for any adjustment of the project  design  or  implementation.  The  review  will\nalso assess adequacy  of  funds,  cost  overruns,  need for  reallocations,  and  other  factors,  if  any,\nincluding  assumptions  and  risks,  that  might  constrain  the  satisfactory  implementation  of  the\nProject and achievement of development objectives.\n\nH.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironmental Aspects\n\n72.\nThe Project has been classified as environmental Category B.  An initial environmental\nexamination was conducted and is reported in Appendix 8. The Project will  only  involve  minor\nconstruction,  and  as  such,  transient  environmental  disturbances  normally  experienced  during\nconstruction will be insignificant. Typical environmental disturbances related to water supply and\nsanitation  will  include  minor  excavations  to  replace  pipes  and  fittings  and  repair  drains;\ntemporary road  and  street  closures  to  allow  pipe and  drain  replacement;  minor  clearing along\nshort  lengths  of  existing  pipeline  routes  to  allow  repairs  and  rehabilitation;  clearing  of  small\nareas (up to 20 square meters) for drill rig and truck access to bore sites; and minor short-term\nassociated  soil  erosion  if  works  are  undertaken  in  high  rainfall  periods.  Most  of  these\ndisturbances  will  be  on  public  land,  and  extend  over  only  a  day  or  two.  Their  impact  will  be\ngenerally limited to 10 to 100 square meters. Other works of significance include the proposed\nrepair and rehabilitation of water supply-related structures such as workshops, stores, generator\nrooms,  storage  tanks,  and  borehole  housing.  All  these  works  will  be  carried  out  on  sites  of\nexisting (damaged) structures and no significant environmental effects are foreseen other than\nnormal  small  building  construction  activities  such  as  cartage  of  building  materials  and\nconstruction noise. Again any  effects  will  be  small  and  temporary, possibly  lasting from  a  few\ndays  to  a  few  weeks.  The  only  significant  adverse  operational  impact  is  that  of  potential\nincrease  in  local  discharge  of  wastewater  because  of  improved  water  supplies.  This  will  be\nameliorated  through  repair  and  rehabilitation  of  drainage  systems  in  problematic  areas.  Any\nother  potential  or  identified  adverse  effects  will  be  preempted  or  minimized  by  (i)  improving\nwater  resource  management  and  (ii)  increasing  promotion  of  environmental  conservation\nthrough community participation and education activities. Thus, while there will be some minor\nand  transient  environmental  impacts,  the  medium-  and  long-term  impact  of  the  Project  is\npositive, especially in promoting economic and social development of East Timor and facilitating\nits  reconstruction  and  development.  A  detailed  environmental  impact  assessment  is  not\nrequired.\n\n73.\nDue  to  the  postconsultation  destruction,  the  environmental  conditions  in  urban  areas  of\nEast  Timor  are  quite  poor.  The  damage  to  water  supplies  and  sanitation  is  now  endangering\npopulations through pervasive waterborne diseases and  lack of sanitation. People are spending\nexcessive  time  collecting  water,  with  the  resulting  inconvenience.  The  environmental  costs  of\nimplementing  the  Project  are  minimal  and  transient,  generally  relating  to  the  minor  physical\nimpacts expected when damaged pipes, buildings, and the like are repaired and rehabilitated. The\n\n\f19\n\nenvironmental and social benefits of the Project are, however, significant and include (i) providing\nthe means for improved WS&S, and (ii) upgrading the quality of life for people in both urban and\nrural  areas  whose  attempts  to  improve  their  status  and  health  are  continually  impeded  by  the\nneed to divert time, energy, and financial resources to acquire their daily water needs. The Project\nwill generate employment through local labor, thus helping to create a stable social and economic\nenvironment. Although previous WS&S activities were generally undertaken with  little  regard  for\nenvironmental  procedures,  nevertheless  repair  and  rehabilitation  works  carried  out  under  the\nProject will ensure that proper and appropriate environmental practices are observed. The Project\nwill ensure adequate environmental procedures and monitoring mechanisms are established, and\nduring works and construction, care will be taken to minimize disruption to the environment.\n\n74.\nEnvironmental  monitoring  will  be  under  the  guidance  of  the  PMU.  In  addition  to  regular\ninspections of works to ensure that all possible  mitigation measures have been  taken, the PMU\nwill  (i)  measure  the  effectiveness  of  any  environmental  improvements  needed,  (ii)  identify\nproblems  that  may  arise  during  the  works  and,  if  necessary,  (iii)  provide  ecological  audit\ninformation for future works of this nature. The proposed monitoring will be designed to quantify\nthe  benefits  gained  and  any  impacts  sustained  from  repairing  and  rehabilitating  town  and\ncommunity  WS&S  systems.  Environmental  parameters  to  be  monitored  will  be  defined  by  the\nPMU, and will  include  raw  water  quality,  treated  water  quality,  delivered  water  quality,  need  for\nand  effectiveness  of  drainage  systems,  water  pressure  in  piped  systems,  environmental\nconditions  in  river  and  spring  catchments  including  pollution  and  land  clearing,  landslide  and\nerosion  problems  affecting  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities,  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of\nsanitation facilities, and growth of algae in reservoirs. WSA will be responsible for all water quality\ntesting  (chemical and bacteriological) using  the  water-testing  laboratory  facility  recently  donated\nby the Government of Japan. They will also be responsible, in cooperation with local communities,\nfor monitoring construction and postconstruction environmental aspects of the Project. The PMU\nwill liaise with WSA and the Interim Health Authority to monitor environmental health statistics as\npart  of  the  Project\u2019s  focus  on  environmental  health  education  and  promotion  of  safe  domestic\nhygiene practices.\n\nUnder  UNTAET, \n\nIndonesian  environmental \n\n75.\ntheir\nimplementation capacity will need to be developed. UNTAET is presently reviewing environmental\nlaws, regulations, and standards, and these may be applied to the Project in the future, although it\nis expected that this will not result in any adverse outcomes. Conversely, the PMU and WSA will\ncompile  project  environmental  reports,  the  information  from  which  will  be  passed  on  to  the\nrelevant  section  of  UNTAET  for  consideration  when  developing  environmental  standards  and\nlegislation.\n\nremain  valid,  although \n\nlaws \n\n2. \n\nSocial Issues\n\nThe  Project  will  rehabilitate  impaired  WS&S  services.  An  initial  social  assessment  has\n76.\nbeen  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines for Social Dimensions of Infrastructure\nProjects and  is  attached  as  Appendix  9.  The  Project  is  expected  to  have  a  significant  positive\nsocial impact. The Project will involve no relocation or resettlement. The beneficiary consultations\nconfirmed  widespread  support  for  the  Project.  The  Project  will  improve  the  quality  of  life  by\nproviding the means for improved sanitation and reducing labor times for water fetching. Project\nconstruction activities  will generate  significant  employment  opportunities,  and  delivered  services\nwill free the labor force for more productive uses.\n\n\fI.\n\nProject Justification\n\n20\n\n77.\nThe Project will have a positive social impact on the East Timorese population, particularly\nthe poor. It will provide safe water and sanitation to a large part of the population. Ready access to\nsafe WS&S services  will have  significant long-term  benefits  in  terms  of  reduction  of  waterborne\ndiseases including diarrhea, dysentery, malaria, and skin diseases. It will also contribute to human\ncapital development and reduce poverty through the ability to put labor used for water fetching to\nmore  productive  uses.  The  Project  will  maximize  the  use  of  local  contractors  in  its  repair  and\nrehabilitation  works,  thereby  creating  jobs  at  the  local  level.  And  it  will  help  to  develop  sector\npolicies and institutional frameworks in which WS&S are delivered so that they take account of the\nneeds of the poor.\n\nFollowing the complete  destruction  of  all  water-related  infrastructure,  it  can  be  assumed\n78.\nthat the net economic benefits will be positive, especially in the urban areas where it is expected\nthat  tariff schemes will eventually be introduced. In the rural areas, the freeing of labor for more\nproductive economic uses and the reduction in health-related costs are expected to result in this\nProject being net economically positive.\n\n79.\nA  key  lesson  is that  in all aspects of WS&S  project  design,  construction,  operation,  and\nmaintenance,  the  focus  must  be  on  striving  for  sustainable  solutions.  Experience  in  many\ncountries over  many  years has  shown that the traditional  least-cost  approach  to  planning  water\nsupply projects is inadequate to achieve sustainable resource use efficiency. What is required is\nan approach that integrates both supply- and demand-side concerns, and accounts for nonmarket\ncosts and benefits. The extent to which benefits from water supply are likely to be sustained will\ndepend  upon  greater  recognition  of  the  role  that  prices  can  play  in  managing  water  demand,\nexpanding  supply,  and  conserving  the  environment.  The  PID  will  address  the  establishment  of,\nand improvement in, tariff levels and structures under this Project; this will ensure differential tariff\nregimes  for  different  customer  segments,  some  degree  of  cost  recovery,  and  sustainability  of\nservices.\n\nJ.\n\nImpact on Extreme Poverty\n\nEven before the 1999 destruction and displacement, East Timor  was  one of the  poorest\n80.\nareas in Southeast Asia.  Based on Indonesian statistics, prior to the upheaval, social indicators in\nEast Timor already demonstrated a low level of human development, with some 50 percent of the\npopulation  clustered  around  the  poverty  line.    The  situation  has  worsened  dramatically  since\nSeptember 1999.\n\n81.\nADB\u2019s  core  development  tenet  is  one  of  combating  poverty.  Its  commitment  in  East\nTimor is to provide well-coordinated action to support reconstruction and long-term development\nplanning, as well as humanitarian relief. This includes working to reduce poverty, with particular\nattention  to  ensuring  quality  basic  service  delivery;  opportunities  for  productive  sector\ndevelopment; and provision of associated infrastructure needs.\n\nPrior  to  the  upheaval,  less  than  half  the  population  had  access  to  safe  water  and\n82.\nsanitation facilities. Sanitation practices, which were often unhygienic, were constrained by the\nabsence of sufficient water. There were major health hazards caused by the lack of  sanitation\nfacilities  in  poorer  rural  and  urban  areas.  Poor  households  were  further  disadvantaged  by\nhaving limited access to basic health and education services. With almost the entire East Timor\npopulation suffering from the destruction, the need for repair and rehabilitation of water supplies\nand sanitation facilities is now even higher.\n\n\f21\n\n83.\nThe Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation Project directly addresses, and seeks to\novercome, a number of factors  that  directly, or  indirectly,  contribute  to  poverty.  The  Project  is\ndesigned to distribute its benefits in an equitable manner across East Timorese urban and rural\ncommunities, be responsive to communities\u2019 needs, contribute to sustainable development and\noperation  in  the  WS&S  sector,  reduce  poverty,  and  minimize  environmental  impacts.  It  will\ntarget communities where need is greatest and where poorer people live (rural villages and peri-\nurban areas).  It will take account of the different needs of men and women and of the old and\nyoung.  And  where  applicable  it  will  adopt  approaches  to WS&S  that  counteract  the  problems\nfaced by poor households because of service charges. In all areas, repair and rehabilitation of\nwater supplies will free labor (both men and women) for more productive uses, thereby assisting\nin  the  fight  against  poverty.  Improved  sanitation  facilities  and  practices,  and  the  provision  of\nclean water will have beneficial health effects, particularly for  children and  infants,  and  reduce\nthe costs associated with disease and morbidity. This particularly benefits the poor for whom the\ncosts of illness can be devastating.\n\nV.\n\nAPPROVAL\n\n84.\nThe  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the\nprovision and administration by ADB of a grant to the United Nations Transitional Administration in\nEast Timor, in an amount not exceeding US$4,500,000, to be financed by the Trust Fund for East\nTimor on  a  grant  basis,  for  the Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Rehabilitation  Project,  and  hereby\nreports such action to the Board.\n\n31 July 2000\n\nTADAO CHINO\nPRESIDENT\n\n\f22\n\nAPPENDIXES\n\nNo.\n\nTitle\n\nPage\n\nCited on\n(page, para)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nProject Framework\n\nWater Supply and Sanitation Sector Profile\n\nWater and Sanitation Authority Draft Strategic Plan and\nOrganization Chart\n\nExternal Assistance to the Water Supply and Sanitation\nSector in East Timor by Agency\n\nDetailed Cost Estimates\n\nOutline Terms of Reference for Support to the East Timor\nWater Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation Project\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nSummary Initial Environmental Examination\n\nInitial Social Assessment\n\n23\n\n30\n\n48\n\n52\n\n63\n\n64\n\n76\n\n77\n\n85\n\n1, 1\n\n3, 15\n\n7, 27\n\n8, 32\n\n13, 54\n\n15, 58\n\n16, 63\n\n18, 72\n\n18, 76\n\n\fPROJECT FRAMEWORK\n\nAppendix 1, page 1\n\nDesign Summary\n\nTargets\n\nProject Monitoring\nMechanism\n\nRisks/\nAssumptions\n\nSector Goal\n\nTo provide the people\nof East Timor with\nadequate, affordable,\nand sustainable water\nsupply and sanitation\n(WS&S) services,\nusing appropriate\ntechnology and\nmanagement systems\n\nReduced dependence\non unsafe and\ninconvenient water\nsources\n\nImproved health\nthrough better access\nto clean water,\nappropriate sanitation,\nand improved\nenvironmental health\nknowledge\n\n23\n\nProject Monitoring\nUnit (PMU) monitoring\n& evaluation\n\nUnited Nations\nTransitional\nAdministration in East\nTimor (UNTAET)'s\nWater and Sanitation\nAuthority (WSA),\nhealth and education\ngroups and non\ngovernment\norganization (NGO)\nreports\n\nConsultations with\ncommunities and\nauthorities\n\nUNTAET continues to\nprovide adequate\nbudgetary and\ntechnical resources,\nand initiates\nappropriate recurrent\ncost financing\nsystems.\n\nInternational funding\nagencies provide\ncontinued support.\n\nThe transition to self-\ngovernment is\nappropriate with\nsound sector\nrecurrent cost\nfinancing systems.\n\nThe Project will\nrespond to needs\nfrom the communities\nas they emerge, and\nwork with other\ndonors whose scope\nand timing of activities\nin the sector are not\nyet clear.\n\nResources are\navailable and\ntransition to self-\ngovernment is\nsmooth.\n\nBalance between\nsector institutional\nand community\nmanagement is\nachieved.\n\nPurpose/Objective\n\nComponent 1.\n\nTo build institutional\nand community\ncapacities for effective\nWS&S sector\nmanagement\n\nStrategic and\nsustainable WSA;\nsustainable\ncommunity\nmanagement of\nsmaller water supplies\n(establishment of the\nPMU by September\n2000, preparation of\nthe Project\n\nOperating records\nand review missions\n\n\f24\n\n(cont'd)\nImplementation\nDocument (PID),\ncompleted by\nDecember 2000\n\nRepaired and\nrehabilitated WS&S\nfacilities on the basis\nof priority need, works\ncommencing\nSeptember 2000,\nwillingness to pay,\nand funds availability\n\nDesign Summary\n\nTargets\n\nProject Monitoring\nMechanism\n\nRisks/\nAssumptions\n\nAppendix 1, page 2\n\nComponent 2.\nTo repair and\nrehabilitate WS&S\nfacilities in urban and\nrural areas.\n\nCompleted systems,\noperating in a\nsustainable way\n\nRural and urban\nequity;

Regulations\ncovering  various  aspects  of  the  WSA  operations  are  gradually  being  developed  and\nimplemented.  The  guiding  policies  used  in  developing  the  plan  are  the  internationally\nrecognized \"Dublin Water Principles,\" which in simple terms state: Water should be considered\na  scarce  and  limited  resource;  it  is  a  public  good,  and  has  an  economic  value  in  all  its\ncompeting uses; it should be managed at the lowest appropriate level in the community.\n\n1.\n\nStakeholders in the WS&S Sector\n\n2.\nStakeholders with an interest in water and sanitation in East Timor include all urban and\nrural  communities  (customers);  future  East  Timor  government  institutions:  WS&S;  Health;\nEnvironment;  Local  Government;  etc.;  Conselho  Nacional  Resistencia  Timorense  (CNRT);\nUNTAET and its relevant offices; local and international nongovernment organizations (NGOs);\ninternational donors; and private sector organizations that will supply and service the sector.\n\n2.\n\nMission Statement and Key Result Areas\n\nUNTAET has proposed the following mission statement and identified the following key\n\n3.\nresult areas (KRAs) as the foundation for the draft strategic plan:\n\nMission Statement: To  ensure  the  communities  of  East  Timor  have  access  to\nsuch water and sanitation services as are considered essential for public health,\nprotection of the environment, and promotion of economic growth\n\n4.\nThe following are KRAs.    These  are  areas  which,  if  not  managed  appropriately  by  the\nnew  W&S  institution,  will  lessen  the  institution\u2019s  effectiveness,  and  diminish  its  service  to\ncustomers:  Policy  and  Planning,  Water  Resources,  Public  Water  Supply,  Community  Water\nSupply, Sewage and Wastewater, Urban Drainage, Solid Waste Management.\n\n3.\n\nLevels of Service\n\nThe plan  identifies  levels  of  service  considered  appropriate  for  each  of  the  KRAs.  For\n5.\npublic  water  supplies,  for  example,  service  minimum  pressure,  peak  demand  level,  water\nquality,  and    response  time    (to  supply  failure)    have    been    defined.    For  community  water\nsupplies,  it  is  proposed  that  individual  communities  will  determine    their  own  levels  of  service\nthrough a community participatory process involving public health considerations.  For sewage,\nwastewater,  and  urban  drainage,  levels  of  service  will  be  locally  determined  based  on\nappropriate national regulations.\n\n\f49\n\nAppendix 3, page 2\n\nB.\n\nOrganization Structure \u2013 Service Delivery\n\n11.\nThe location of the current WSA within UNTAET is  shown  in the  attached organization\ncharts.  UNTAET's  public  utilities  \u2013  water  and  power  \u2013  are  managed  and  coordinated  by  the\nhead of public utilities, a position that sits in the infrastructure portfolio. The various departments\nunder the Cabinet Infrastructure group are public works, energy, water and sanitation, transport\nand communications, and the National Institute of Cadaster and Geodesy.\n\nTable  A3.1  outlines  the  proposed  number  of  civil  servants  required  to  adequately  staff\n\n12.\nthis organization structure.\n\nTable A3.1: Proposed Staffing\n\nLevel (UN)\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n\nCategory (UN)\nSenior Administrator\nAdministrator / Manager\nQualified / Professional\nSemi-skilled\nUnskilled\nTotal Staff\n\nSource:  UNTAET staff estimates.\n\nC.\n\nProject Response to Draft Strategic Plan\n\nNumber\n3\n10\n35\n91\n28\n167\n\n13.\nComponent  1.2  of  the  Project  includes  a  reexamination  of  the  draft  strategic  plan  in\nconjunction  with  detailed  studies  of  institutional  development  and  capacity  building  and  other\nkey components of the WS&S sector in East Timor.  This will be done in a fully participatory way\ninvolving  all  relevant  stakeholders.

The widespread destruction included looting,  burning,  and\ndamage  to  town  and  village  water  supplies  and  sanitation  facilities  throughout  the  country.\nTypically  in  towns  with  public  water  supply  systems,  vehicles,  pumps,  and  motors  were\nremoved; water treatment plants damaged; offices, stores and other buildings burned; pipelines,\ntools  and  spare  parts  stolen;  storage  tanks  ruptured;  latrines  and  septic  tanks  damaged;  and\nwater  sources  impaired.  And  in  the  burning  of  houses,  water  connections,  including  meters,\nwere completely destroyed. None of the former water supply or sanitation institutions now exist.\nTherefore  it  is  essential  to  support  physical  repair  and  rehabilitation;  and  develop  new\ninstitutions and systems for managing, operating, maintaining, and developing urban  and  rural\nwater supplies in East Timor that are both appropriate and sustainable.\n\n3.\nThe Project\u2019s goal is to provide the people of East Timor with adequate, affordable, and\nsustainable  water  supply  and  sanitation  (WS&S)  services  using  appropriate  technology  and\ngood management systems. It will do this by (i) building local capacity to effectively manage the\nWS&S sector; (ii) rehabilitating and reconstructing water supply and sanitation facilities in urban\nand  rural  communities;  and  (iii)  promoting  improved  environmental  health,  hygiene,  and\ncommunity participatory practices.\n\n2.\n\nObjectives\n\n3.\n\nDescription\n\n4.\nThe Project will (i) develop a WS&S sector management and investment program, which\nincludes  establishment  of  a  project  management  unit  (PMU)  under  UNTAET\u2019s  Water  and\nSanitation  Authority  (WSA),  and  preparation  of  a  detailed,  budgeted  program  implementation\ndocument  (PID)  for  coordinated  improvement  of  East  Timor\u2019s  WS&S  Sector,  (ii)  implement  a\ncapacity  building  and  institutional  development  program  which  will  identify  and  implement\npriority activities to support physical reconstruction already under way or being planned, and to\ncomplement  capacity-building  and  institutional  development  activities by  other  donors, and\n(iii) commence  a  WS&S implementation program, comprising (a) WSA WS&S quick response\nfacility,  (b)  complementary  works  or  the  Dili  water  supply  repair  and  rehabilitation already\n\n\f78\n\nAppendix 8, page 2\n\nunder way by other donors, and (c) complementary works for the district water supply repair and\nrehabilitation already under way by other donors.\n\n5.\nThe  immediate  benefits  of  the  Project  include  (i)  providing  the  means  for  improved\nWS&S  and  (ii)  upgrading  the  quality  of  life  for  people  in  both  urban  and  rural  areas  whose\nattempts to improve their status and health are continually impeded by the need to divert time,\nenergy,  and  financial  resources  to  acquire  their  daily  water  needs.  The  Project  will  generate\nemployment  through  local  labor,  thus  helping  to  create  a  stable  social  and  economic\nenvironment. It is expected that the Project will directly or indirectly benefit most of the country's\n800,000 population.\n\n6.\nThe  Project  is  designed  to  distribute  its  benefits  in  an  equitable  manner  across  East\nTimorese  urban  and  rural  communtities'  needs,  contributing  to  sustainable  development  and\noperation in the WS&S sector, and reducing poverty.\n\nC.\n\nDescription of the Environment\n\n1.\n\nPhysical Environment\n\n7.\nEast  Timor  comprises  the  eastern  half  of  Timor  Island.  It  has  a  contiguous  area  of\n19,000 square kilometers (km2), with an additional 2,461 km2 in the Oecusse-Ambeno enclave\ninside  West  Timor.  Timor  is  the  largest  and  eastern  most  island  in  the  Lesser  Sunda\nArchipelago.\n\n8.\nThe island is along the junction of the Australian and the Asian geological plates and is\nthus  subject  to  frequent  earthquakes.  The  rock  formations  are  primarily  sedimentary  karst\nuplifted  by  the  collision  of  the  two  plates.  As  the  formation  is  quite  recent,  the  karst  is  highly\nfractured and crumbles easily. Metamorphic rock from past volcanic activity is limited to northern\nand  central  sections  of  the  island.  The  high  erosion  rate  from  the  crumbling  karst  layers  has\nresulted in the formation of alluvial plains and isolated fertile valleys.\n\n9.\nThe main geographic feature is the mountain range that runs east-west along the center\nof the island and that causes watercourses to flow either north to the Banda Sea or south to the\nTimor Sea.  Mountain peaks reach up to 3,000 meters in elevation so watercourses are steep,\nfast flowing, and because of the extended dry season, generally ephemeral. The river systems\nare short, cutting deep ravines into the unstable rock, forming deep  canyons  in  the highlands,\nand  abruptly  widening  as  they  reach  the  flat  alluvial  plains.  Often  the  rivers  narrow  as  they\napproach the sea because of obstruction by sandbars and intertidal deposits. Countless littoral\nterraces of coral origin, and some extensive plateaus, also of coral origin, characterize the north\nside  of  the  island  (e.g.,  Baucau  and  Laga).  A  few  alluvial  areas  occur  between  Lautem  and\nBaucau and in Manatuto district.  The main plains to the north occur at Batugade, Lois stream,\nDili, Manatuto, and Com. The south coast comprises a wide plain that extends from the border\neast to Viqueque where it begins to narrow, through to Lore in Lautem district. The enclave of\nOecusse-Ambeno is also very mountainous with a narrow coastal strip.  Here all streams flow to\nthe north.  The volcanic island of Atauro rises steeply from the sea to a maximum elevation of\n999 meters on Mount Mano Coco.\n\n\f79\n\nAppendix 8, page 3\n\n2.\n\nClimate and Water Resources\n\nSituated in the equatorial region, Timor has basically two annual seasons (wet and dry)\n10.\ninfluenced variously by the monsoon regime, proximity to the Australian continent, and locally by\nthe  orographic  effects  of  the  mountainous  topography.    The  wet  season,  which  lasts  from\nNovember  to  May,  results  from  the  northern  monsoon.    It  is  characterized  by  thunderstorms,\nhigh  tropical  rainfall  and temperature,  and  concomitant  humidity.    During  the  dry  season  from\nJune  to  October,  winds  from  the  south  bring  little  rainfall  and  result  in  lower  temperatures.\nAnnual rainfall ranges from some 500 to 1500 mm in the lower lying coastal areas to over 3000\nmm  in  the  mountains.    Depending  on  location,  average  wet  season  rainfall  ranges  from  70\npercent  (Kova-Lima)  to  95  percent  (Ambeno)  of  annual  rainfall.    Those  districts  along  the\nnorthern  coastline  (Ambeno,  Liquica,  Dili,  Manatuto,  and  Baucau)  have  the  lowest  rainfall,\nranging  from  about  500  mm  in  Manatuto  to  800  mm  in  Ambeno  and  Baucau,  with  over  90\npercent generally falling in the wet season.\n\n11.\nThe  hydrological  regime  is  primarily  dependent  on  the  climatic  conditions  of  the\nalternating  wet  and  dry  monsoon  seasons.  Rivers  in  the  area  are  generally  characterized  by\ntheir  relatively  short  length,  steep  gradient,  short  flood  peaks,  very  high  sediment  load,  and\nmobile beds.  In many areas, river and stream crossings require frequent realignment and repair\ndue  to  continual  changes  in  river  channels.    Sediment  tends  to  be  very  coarse,  including\nboulders  and  large  gravel.    The  mountainous  topography  and  streamflow  pattern  makes  the\nconstruction of dams and weirs problematic.\n\n12.\nBecause of the relatively high rainfall and abundance of springs and surface water, and\nthe  small  population,  there  has  not  been  the  need  in  the  past  for  significant  groundwater\ninvestigation.  Therefore  knowledge  of  groundwater  occurrence  and  quality \nlimited.\nGroundwater  is  accessed  in  the  mountain areas  mainly  through springs,  which  are  commonly\ntapped  at  their  source  with  water  gravity  fed  to  towns  and  villages,  through  small  diameter\npipelines often many kilometers long.  Villagers along the coastal alluvial plains usually rely on\nopen, hand-dug, wells for their domestic supplies.  In addition a number of towns in East Timor\nobtain  at  least  part  of  their  raw  water  from  groundwater,  via  small  diameter  deep  bores\nequipped with downhole pumps.\n\nis \n\n13.\nTypically, surface water, where available  in  the  dry  season,  is of acceptable  quality.  In\nthe wet season, however, turbidity is normally unacceptably high with  consequent  implications\nfor  water  treatment.  In  general  the  quality  of  water  from  springs  and  groundwater  sources  is\nacceptable for most of the year, though often hard. In coastal areas communities can also have\nthe additional problem of saltwater intrusion into wells. The generally unfavorable geology and\nsteep topography in East Timor exacerbate the normal water resources difficulties faced during\nthe  dry  season  as  rivers  dry  up  and  spring  flows  recede,  often  to  very  small  flows.  All  this\ncombines  to  produce  a  hydrological  environment  in  which  securing  safe,  and  reliable,  water\nsources for town and village supplies is difficult. Recurrent droughts exacerbate this problem.\n\n3.\n\nBiological Environment\n\n14.\nTimor is on the eastern side of the Wallace Line. The flora and fauna are similar to that\nof the tropical Australia-Pacific group. It has no large animals, but many small mammals, such\nas deer,  and  brightly  colored  birds.  Timor  was  one of  the  first islands settled by Europeans\n\n\f80\n\nAppendix 8, page 4\n\nbecause of its proximity to the Spice Islands.  A number of domesticated and feral animals have\nbeen  introduced  to  the  islands,  such  as  horses,  cattle,  chicken,  and  pigs.  During  the  last  10\nyears the deforestation was officially estimated at 70,000 hectares, with the unofficial estimate\ndouble  this  level.  The  central  highlands  are  cultivated  with  coffee,  mainly  the  robusta  variety.\nEast Timor coffee commands a high price in the world market because of its higher-than-normal\nalkaline  properties.  Rice,  corn,  sorghum,  beans,  and  root  crops  are  grown  in  the  lowlands.\nSlash and burn agriculture is common even on the steep hillsides.\n\n4.\n\nSociocultural Environment\n\nMost of the population is concentrated in the northern coastal towns and in fertile valleys\n15.\nin the interior.  The coastal flat lands in the south are sparsely populated because of the harsh\nmountain terrain that divides the island.  Sea travel from the north to the south is constrained by\nstrong  waves  most  of  the  year.  The  economy  is  based  on  agriculture,  with  coffee  the  major\nexport crop.  Surplus rice, corn, and other agricultural produce are consumed within the island.\nThere  is  little  industry  or  manufacturing.    A  number  of  potential  mineral  deposits  have  been\nidentified,  but  their  commercial  potential  has  not  been  explored.  The  service  industry  was,\nduring the Indonesian period, limited to the civil service and state-owned corporations, such as\ntelecommunications,  power  and  water,  and  oil  and  gas  distribution.  Trading  and  other\ncommercial  activities  were  limited  to  traditional  marketplaces  in  small  settlements.  Banks,\nrestaurants, hotels, and other businesses were mostly found in  the  two  large  centers:  Dili  and\nBaucau. Most formal businesses were burned down during the postconsultation destruction.\n\n16.\nAlmost  70  percent  of  the  schools  were  destroyed  during  the  post-consultation\ndestruction.  Although  school  reconstruction  is  progressing,  at  present  many  classes  are\nconducted  in  open  yards  and  damaged  buildings.  Tetum  is  the  local  language,  with  Bahasa\nIndonesia and Portuguese spoken by sizeable portions of the population. Almost 95 percent of\nthe population are Roman Catholics, with a small Muslim and Protestant population.\n\nD.\n\nScreening Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n\n1.\n\nPhysical Environment\n\na.\n\nProject Activities\n\n17. Water Supplies. The Project will repair and rehabilitate existing town piped water supply\nsystems  and  domestic  and  community  water  supply  schemes.  Repair  and  rehabilitation  of\nexisting  pipelines,  pumping  and  distribution  systems,  and  community-managed  supplies  will\ncause localized and temporary disruptions through such things as road openings, excavations,\ndrilling, and associated traffic.  As these will be relatively small undertakings, working in areas of\nexisting  facilities  and  services,  they  are  not  expected  to  result  in  significant  or  lasting\nenvironmental impacts.\n\n18.\nBuilding Repairs. As part of its institutional development effort, a number of burned and\notherwise  damaged  water  supply-related  buildings  (stores,  workshops,  generator  rooms,  etc.)\nwill be repaired.  Works  here  will  also  have  only a minor and temporary environmental impact\nthrough normal construction noise, associated traffic, and some small excavation. As these will\nbe relatively small undertakings, working in areas of existing buildings, they are not expected to\nresult in significant or lasting environmental impacts.\n\n\f81\n\nAppendix 8, page 5\n\n19.\nSanitation.  There  are  no  communal  or  public  sewerage  systems  in  East  Timor.\nImproved latrines, where they occur, rely on septic tanks or soakage pits for effluent disposal. It\nis expected that the Project will be called upon to rehabilitate or repair some damaged disposal\nfacilities in the main towns. In these cases appropriate technology options will be utilized in all\ncommunity programs. The result will be that effluent disposal practices will be improved with a\npositive impact on local environmental  health  status.  No  significant  environmental  impacts  are\nexpected from such rehabilitation.\n\n20.\nDrainage.  In  those  towns  and  villages  where  water  supplies  are  improved,  there  will\ninevitably be some increase in wastewater. This occurs through increased septic tank effluent,\nincreased household wastewater disposal, and general increased water usage by communities\nin their daily lives.  In areas where this increased wastewater load is indicated to be problematic,\nthe  Project  will  rehabilitate  selected,  damaged,  drainage  works  at  appropriate  locations.  No\nsignificant environmental impacts are expected from rehabilitating these old drainage systems,\nrather  the  drainage  works  will  improve  the  environmental  situation  by  preventing  the\naccumulation of wastewater and consequent pollution and environmental health problems.\n\nb.\n\nScreening Parameters\n\ni.   Environmental Problems Due to Project Location\n\n21.\nExact project activities will be determined by need. Activities will mostly be small works\ncomprising  the  repair  and  rehabilitation  of  existing  facilities  that  were  either  deliberately\ndamaged  in  the  postconsultation  period,  or  are  otherwise  unserviceable.  Thus  the  project\nlocations,  which  are  likely  to  number  around  200  scattered  across  East  Timor,  will  be\ndetermined  by  circumstance.  The  Project  will  have  little  influence  as  to  their  locations.\nConsequently  the  Project  will  have  to  work  within  each  of  the  numerous,  different,\nenvironmental conditions that exist.  And at each site, if there are any environmental problems,\nthe Project will cope with them as conditions, good practice, and funding permit. However, it is\nexpected  that  as  the  works  will  merely  be  replacing  or  repairing  existing  WS&S  facilities,  in\nlocalized  areas  and  over  short  periods,  (up  to  a  few  days)  environmental  problems  due  to\nproject locations will be minor.\n\nii.   Environmental Problems Related to Design\n\n22.\nSimilar comments apply as for para. 21. Designs for the repair and rehabilitation works\nwill have to generally accord with the preexisting arrangements and thus there is little latitude for\nthe Project to make significant changes to accommodate environmental problems that may be\nencountered.  However,  as  for  site  location,  if  any  problems  are  encountered  that  can  be\naccommodated within the funding constraints, they will be dealt with using good environmental\npractices.\n\niii.   Environmental Problems Associated with Construction Stage\n\nThe  Project  will  only  involve  minor  construction,  and  as  such,  transient  environmental\n23.\ndisturbances  normally  experienced  during  construction  will  be \ninsignificant.  Typical\nenvironmental  disturbances  related  to  WS&S  will  include  minor  excavations  to  replace  pipes\nand  fittings  and  repair  drains,  temporary  road  and  street  closures  to    allow    pipe    and    drain\nreplacement,  minor clearing  along  short  lengths   of  existing   pipeline routes to allow repairs\n\n\f82\n\nAppendix 8, page 6\n\nand rehabilitation, clearing of small areas (up to 20 meters square) for drill rig and truck access\nto  bore  sites,  and  minor  short-term  associated  soil  erosion  if  works  are  undertaken  in  high\nrainfall periods. Most of these disturbances will be on public land, and extend over only a day or\ntwo. They will have an areal impact generally limited to 10 to 100 square meters. As most works\nwill  involve  the  repair  or  replacement  of  existing  pipelines  and  other  WS&S  facilities,\nenvironmental  effects  will  be  no  more,  and  probably  less,  than  has  already  occurred.  Other\nworks  of  significance  include  the  proposed  repair  and  rehabilitation  of  water  supply-related\nstructures such  as  workshops,  stores,  generator  rooms,  storage tanks, and  borehole housing.\nAll these works will be carried out on sites of existing (damaged)  structures  and  no  significant\nenvironmental effects are foreseen other than normal small building construction activities such\nas  cartage  of  building  materials  and  construction  noise.  Again  any  effects  will  be  small  and\ntemporary, possibly lasting from a few days to a few weeks.\n\niv.   Environmental Problems Resulting from Project Operations\n\n24.\nThe  only  significant  adverse  operational  impact  is  that  of  potential  increase  in  local\ndischarge  of  wastewater  because  of  improved  water  supplies.  This  will  be  ameliorated  by\nrepairing  and  rehabilitating  drainage  systems  in  problematic  areas.  Any  other  potential  or\nidentified  adverse  effects  will  be  preempted  or  minimized  by  (i)  improving  water  resource\nmanagement  and  (ii)  increasing  promotion  of  environmental  conservation  through  community\nparticipation  and  education  activities.  The  issue  of  sustainability  of  system  operation  is  being\naddressed through capacity-building and institutional development activities under the Project's\ncomponent 1 and through cooperation with WSA and donor partners active in the WS&S sector.\n\nv.   Potential Environmental Enhancement Measures\n\ninclude  (i)  measuring \n\nThe    Project\u2019s  main  contributions  to  environmentally  sustainable  development,  as  it\n25.\nrelates to the sector,  will  be  to undertake  environmental  monitoring under the  guidance of  the\nPMU.  Monitoring  will \nthe  effectiveness  of  any  environmental\nimprovements  needed,  (ii)  identifying  problems  that  may  arise  during  the  works,  and  if\nnecessary  (iii)  providing  ecological  audit  information  for  future  works  of  this  nature.  The\nproposed monitoring will be designed to quantify the benefits gained and any impacts sustained\nfrom  repairing  and  rehabilitating  town  and  community  WS&S  systems.  Environmental\nparameters  to  be  monitored  will  be  defined  by  the  PMU,  but  will  include  raw  water  quality,\ntreated water quality, delivered  water quality, need  for  and effectiveness of drainage  systems,\nwater  pressure  in  piped  systems,  environmental  conditions  in  river  and  spring  catchments\nincluding pollution and land clearing, landslide and erosion problems affecting WS&S facilities,\nefficiency and effectiveness of sanitation facilities, and growth of algae  in  reservoirs.  WSA  will\nbe responsible for all water quality testing (chemical and bacteriological) using the water-testing\nlaboratory facility recently donated by the Government of Japan. They will also be responsible,\nin  cooperation  with  local  communities,  for  monitoring  construction  and  post-construction\nenvironmental  aspects  of  the  Project.  The  PMU  will  liaise  with  WSA  and  the  Interim  Health\nAuthority for the monitoring of environmental  health  statistics  as part  of  the Project\u2019s focus  on\nenvironmental  health  education  and  promotion  of  safe  domestic  hygiene  practices.  Under\nUNTAET, Indonesian environmental  laws  remain  valid,  although  their  implementation  capacity\nwill need to be developed. UNTAET is presently reviewing environmental laws, regulations, and\nstandards,  and  these  may  be applied to the Project in the future, although it is expected that\nthis will not result in any adverse outcomes. Conversely, the PMU and WSA will compile project\n\n\f83\n\nAppendix 8, page 7\n\nenvironmental reports, the information from  which  will  be passed  on  to  the  relevant  section  of\nUNTAET for consideration when developing their environmental standards and legislation.\n\n2.\n\nBiological Environment\n\n26.\nThe water  supply,  building,  sanitation,  and drainage  works  proposed under  the  Project\nall pertain to repair and rehabilitation of existing facilities. None of the proposed activities are of\na scale large enough to have significant physical impact. As such, they are merely operating in\nareas  that  have  already  been  disturbed  by  past  works  and  therefore  should  have  little  or  no\nimpact on the biological environment.\n\n3.\n\nSociocultural Environment\n\n27.\nThe  water  supply,  building,  sanitation,  and  drainage  repair  and  rehabilitation  works\nproposed under the Project will be undertaken within existing roads and rights-of-way. No land\nacquisition  or  resettlement  will  be  required.  The  Project  is  specifically  designed  to  provide\npositive sociocultural  impacts  by  improving WS&S,  upgrading the  quality  of  life for both urban\nand  rural  folk,  improving  environmental  health  standards,  generating  employment,  and\npromoting  community  participatory  processes  for  development.  The  Project  is  designed  to\ndistribute  its  benefits  in  an  equitable  manner  across  East  Timorese  urban  and  rural\ncommunities, contributing  to  sustainable development and  operation  in  the  WS&S sector, and\nreducing poverty. The overall sociocultural impact of the Project is assessed to be positive.\n\nE.\n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program\n\n28.\nIndonesian  environmental  laws  and  regulations  remain  in  effect  in  East  Timor.  The\npersonnel  implementing  and  enforcing  the  environmental  laws  and  regulations  were  mostly\nIndonesian nationals and are not expected to return to East Timor. UNTAET needs support  in\nreviewing these regulations and developing capacity to undertake environmental assessments.\nADB's technical assistance is proposed to assist in these areas.\n\n29.\nIn addition to regular inspections of works to ensure that all possible mitigation measures\nare  taken,  environmental  monitoring  will  be  undertaken  under  the  guidance  of  the  PMU.  The\nProject will (i) measure the effectiveness of environmental improvements, (ii) identify problems\nthat may arise during the  works,  and  if necessary,  (iii) provide ecological audit information for\nfuture works of this nature.  The proposed monitoring is designed to quantify the benefits gained\nand  new  impacts  sustained  from  rehabilitating  sanitation  facilities  and  town  and  community\nwater supply systems.\n\nF.\n\nConclusions\n\n30. \nDue to the postconsultation destruction, environmental conditions  in  some urban areas\nof  East  Timor  are  quite  poor.  This  situation  may  now  be  endangering  populations  through\npervasive  waterborne diseases  and  lack  of  sanitation.  Previously,  WS&S  activities  were  often\nundertaken  without  due  regard    for    environmental  procedures.  The  Project  will,  however,\nensure  that repairs and  rehabilitation of water supplies, buildings, and sanitation facilities are\nundertaken  with  care  for  the  environment. The  Project  will  ensure adequate environmental\n\n\f84\n\nAppendix 8, page 7\n\nprocedures  and  monitoring  mechanisms  are  established.  During  the  works  and  construction,\ncare will be taken to minimize disruption to the physical, biological, and social environment.\n\n31.\nApart from the  immediate  beneficial  impact  of  cleaning up,  repairing, and  rehabilitating\nWS&S infrastructure, the Project will encourage promotion of environmental health and hygiene\neducation,  ensuring  correct  health  procedures  and  water  conservation  measures  are\nundertaken.\n\n32.\nOn the whole, the impact of the Project is expected to be positive and will be monitored\nthroughout implementation.  This  will  be facilitated  by  institution  building under  the  Project and\nthrough  the  PMU.  Any  potential  negative  environmental  impacts  are  limited  to  construction\nactivities that are temporary and reversible.\n\n\f85\n\nAppendix 9, page 1\n\nA.\n\nBenefits and Beneficiaries\n\nINITIAL SOCIAL ASSESSMENT\n\n1. \nIn 1998, East Timor had an estimated population of under 0.9 million people, with over\n50  percent  having  been  displaced  during  the  postconsultation  violence.  It  is  estimated  that\nupward of 85 percent have returned to their homes since the end of 1999.  It  is estimated  that\n80-90 percent of the population live in rural areas, with the remainder living in the capital, Dili,\nand 12 main towns. These towns comprise formal urban dwellers, and an estimated 50 percent\nsquatters, urban infill, and peri-urban populations.\n\n2. \nEven before the 1999 destruction and displacement, East Timor was one of the poorest\nareas in south-east Asia, with severe problems of adult literacy (41 percent), life expectancy (56\nyears),  malnutrition,  malaria,  and  tuberculosis.  Gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  per  capita  was\nestimated  at  under  US$395,  and  approximately  50  percent  of  households  were  clustered\naround  the  poverty  line.  Following  the  popular  consultation  and  subsequent  destruction,  this\nsituation  has  worsened  dramatically,  with GDP  dropping  an  estimated  40  percent  to  US$230,\nand  a  generally  recognized  poverty  population  of  almost  100  percent.  Within  the  rural  sector,\nthe destruction of their means of agricultural production, and the closure of banks, and loss of\nmeager savings resulted in East Timor being estimated as one of the absolute poorest countries\nin the world.\n\n3. \nUnder  most  Timorese  traditional  systems,  the  role  of  women  was  severely  restricted,\nwith men dominating decision-making and leadership roles within the villages. These roles are\nchanging as a result of the social disruption caused by the long-term struggle for independence\nin  East  Timor,  with  women  participating fully  in  all  aspects  of  the  clandestine  front  and  in  the\narmed  resistance.  Women  are  gaining  new  skills  and  responsibilities,  and  are  beginning  to\nmove  into  traditionally  male-dominated  income  generation  activities.  It  is  imperative  that  this\nrespect and newly acquired roles are maintained within the new East Timorese society.\n\nB.\n\nNeeds, Demands and Absorptive Capacity\n\n4. \nPrior  to  the  upheaval,  less  than  half  the  population  had  access  to  safe  water  and\nsanitation facilities. Sanitation practices, which were often unhygienic, were constrained by the\nabsence  of  sufficient  water.  Dry  pit  latrines  are  used  extensively  and  were  often  located\nadjacent to water courses, or households. There were major health hazards caused by the lack\nof  sanitation  facilities  in  poorer  rural  and  urban  areas.  Poor  households  were  further\ndisadvantaged with poor access to basic health and education services.\n\nWith  the  substantial damage  to  infrastructure  and  public  utilities  that  resulted  following\n5. \nthe postconsultation violence, already degraded services ceased to function. Most communities\nnow have access to water through traditional means or through some emergency reconstruction\nworks. Although this may reduce substantially with  the onset  of  the dry  season,  it  is assumed\nthat  the  ongoing  emergency  programs,  supplemented  by  urgent  works  within  the  proposed\nwater supply and sanitation (WS&S) program will suffice.\n\n6. \nWithin this environment, the immediate benefits of the water and sanitation program will\nbe  to  ensure  that  a  comprehensive  and  equitable  water  supply  and  sanitation  program  is\nestablished that will eventually provide adequate supplies and services at an appropriate  level\nof service for all people in East Timor.  It  is  important  to  implement  these programs within the\n\n\f86\n\nAppendix 9, page 2\n\nconstraints  imposed  by  the  community's  commitments  to  other  programs,  restricted  financial\nand institutional capacity, and other competing community and household objectives.\n\nWith almost the entire East Timor population suffering from the destruction, the need for\n7. \nreconstruction  and  rehabilitation  of  WS&S  facilities  is  high,  if  disease  is  to  be  averted.  In  all\nareas,  the  rehabilitation  and  development  of  water  supplies  will  free  labor  (both  men  and\nwomen) for more productive uses. Improved sanitation facilities and practices, and the provision\nof clean water will have beneficial health effects, particularly for children and infants, and reduce\nthe costs associated with disease and morbidity.\n\nC.\n\nAdverse Effects on Vulnerable Groups\n\nThe Project will not involve any  land  acquisition  or  resettlement. Project  works  will  use\n\n8.\nthe existing rights-of-way. The Project will not have negative impacts on any vulnerable group.\n\nD.\n\nSocial Dimensions in Project Design\n\n1.\n\nCommunity Participation\n\n9.\nThe  remoteness  of  many  of  the  communities  and  the  difficulty  of  access  to  the\nsettlements made it almost impossible in the past for any effective services to be provided at the\ncommunity level. It was observed, and recounted from discussions, that there had been a lack\nof community participation in the process of developing appropriate water supply systems and\nsanitation  facilities.  In  a  number  of  villages,  where  infrastructure  such  as  WS&S  existed,  the\nresidents  did  not  know  which  agency  the  facilities  came  from.  This  resulted  in  a  lack  of\nownership  and  lack  of  motivation  for  the  community  to  manage,  operate,  or  maintain  the\nfacilities and systems. When technical problems arose, the community took no action, but rather\nreverted to the previous methods of attaining water or disposing of feces. This situation is now\nprevalent throughout the majority of communities visited during the mission.\n\n10.\nThe  communities  have  a  very  limited  capacity  to  operate  and  maintain  any  facilities,\nprimarily  due  to  lack  of  funds,  but  also  due  to  poor  training;  technical  assistance;  and  simple\nmanuals, tools, and  repair  equipment.  The  use  of  inappropriate  technology  in  the  past,  made\nmany systems difficult to maintain due to the difficulty of obtaining spare parts and the shortage\nof qualified and experienced technical staff to undertake the repairs. Some systems were also\nvery expensive to operate and maintain due to the need for constant repair and replacement of\nparts  that  were  of  inferior  quality  or  where  poor  workmanship  and  quality  of  design  and/or\nconstruction had resulted in frequent  breakages or failures.  It  is  therefore especially  important\nfor communities to be able to plan, manage, and implement their own development. In situations\nwhere communities can operate and maintain their own facilities, there is a considerably greater\nchance  that  the  systems  will  be  sustainable,  than  for  those  systems  that  rely  on  government\noperation and maintenance.\n\nThe  team  acknowledges  that  the  success  of  any  development  project  involved  in  the\n11.\nWS&S  sector  is  dependent  upon  the  effective  participatory  involvement  of  the  community,\nespecially at the earliest stages of community project activities.  The use of a methodology such\nas  the  participatory  rural  appraisal  (PRA)  is  effective  in  social  preparation,  problem  solving,\nawareness raising, informing choice and facilitating participation of the community at all stages.\nAnother  important lesson is the value of  NGOs  in  facilitating  participatory development. Their\n\n\f87\n\nAppendix 9, page 3\n\ncloseness to the community assists in the process of participatory development and community\nmobilization,  which  creates  ownership  and  therefore  extends  sustainability.  Changes  in\nknowledge, attitudes, and practices relating to water use, hygiene and sanitation is essential for\nachieving  improvements  in  community  health  and  well-being.  Community  participation  and\nsocial  preparation  are  critical  in  the  process  of  hygiene  and  sanitation  promotion.  The\ninstallation of facilities such as water supply systems and latrines, does not in itself necessarily\nguarantee improved health of the people. The focus must be extended to the proper utilization\nand management of WS&S.\n\n12. While the process of community participation within the WS&S sector is an ideal way to\nproceed, in East Timor the current situation is more complicated. There is already a community\nempowerment project1 under way,  and a few other  similar  programs being  considered.2 While\nthere is an issue that these programs\u2019 goals and  objectives  may  conflict,  when combined  with\nthe wholesale, multisector reconstruction and development effort, the main result is instead an\ninordinate time and resource burden on recipient community members who are still struggling to\nrebuild their own personal lives. It is important that WS&S programs do not exceed this capacity\nthreshold.\n\nTherefore, all WS&S program components while still utilizing a  community  participation\n13.\nand ownership approach wherever possible, should take account of other community initiatives\nand a community\u2019s capacity to engage in such activities.\n\n2.\n\nGender\n\n14.\nUnder  most  Timorese  traditional  systems,  the  role  of  women  was  severely  restricted,\nwith men dominating decision-making and leadership roles within the villages. These roles are\nchanging as a result of the social disruption caused by the long-term struggle for independence\nin  East  Timor,  with  women  participating fully  in  all  aspects  of  the  clandestine  front  and  in  the\narmed  resistance.  Women  are  gaining  new  skills  and  responsibilities,  and  are  beginning  to\nmove  into  traditionally  male-dominated  income  generation  activities.  It  is  imperative  that  this\nrespect and newly acquired roles are maintained within the new East Timorese society.\n\n15. Women play important roles in the household as major contributors to household income\nthrough  marketing  agricultural  produce  and  petty  trading  activities.  In  addition  they  are  the\nprimary  caregivers  and  responsible  for  household  work.  Women  report  they  have  a  say  in\ndecisions about household spending and have access to savings for spending as needed.\n\n16.\nAlthough women reported fairly evenly divided responsibilities for water fetching, it was\ngenerally acknowledged  that they bore  the  most burden  and  responsibility,  especially  as  men\nwere often working elsewhere. Most rural women reported times in excess of 1 hour a day for\nwater  carrying. Water  was  often  not  treated,  due  to  a  lack  of  knowledge,  time,  or  resources.\nWomen are also burdened with responsibility for the health of family members and for caring for\nsick  family  members,  further  reducing  time  and  energy  for  both  productive  and  personal\nactivities.  It is therefore women who are in most need  of  assistance  in  reducing the  time  and\neffort  required  to  obtain  water  supplies  and  in  caring  for  the  health  and  welfare  of  family\nmembers.\n\n                                                       \n1  The Community Empowerment Program is a joint WB/ADB project that began in March 2000.\n2  For example, the United Nations Development Program Governance program.\n\n\f88\n\nAppendix 9, page 4\n\n17.\nFemale survey respondents reported frequent skin and genital inflammations, indicative\nof  poor  water  quality  and  sanitation  practices.  A  lack  of  water  for  washing  was  a  recurrent\ntheme. While the rehabilitation and development of water supplies and improved sanitation will\nnot  change  this  situation  substantially,  especially  in  rural  areas,  nor  empower  women  and\nchildren,  it  will  allow  women  more  time  to  pursue  other  opportunities,  and  provide  a  healthy\nenvironment for themselves and their families. It is expected that any WS&S program will work\nin conjunction with other initiatives in community development and empowerment.\n\n18.\nImproving  hygiene  and  sanitation,  and  the  utilization  of  WS&S  facilities  by  improving\nknowledge, attitudes,  and  practices of the  whole  community,  will  positively  impact  on  women.\nThe  health  of  the  family  will  improve,  and  the  load  borne  by  women  as  caretakers  will\ncorrespondingly  reduce.  Due  to  their  traditional  roles  in  the  sector,  women  have  a  particular\nneed for improved access, management, and effective use of WS&S facilities.\n\n3.\n\nSustainability\n\n19.\nAt  this  early  stage  of  reconstruction  and  development,  it  is  difficult  to  say  how\nsustainable  the  nation  of  East  Timor  can  be,  let  alone  the  sustainability  of  the  WS&S  sector.\nThere will certainly be a need for aid and support for many years to come, although the strength\nand perseverance of the East Timorese throughout and following the conflict are amazing and\nwill provide a sound foundation for their nation.\n\na.\n\nCommunity Ownership\n\n20. Within the WS&S sector, sustainability will be different between the urban and the rural\nsystems.  However,  a  common  element  to  achieve  sustainability  will  be  a  strong  level  of\nownership of project activities by the target groups, whether through community management in\nthe rural areas or cost recovery in the urban areas. It is recognized that issues of sustainability\ncan be addressed through  adequate  involvement  of  target  groups  and  participants  early  on  in\nproject activities.\n\nb.\n\nHealth and Hygiene Awareness\n\n21.\nAnother common element for sustainability is through health and hygiene awareness in\nwater use  and  sanitation.  It  is  essential  that  the  community  gain  an  understanding  of  the  link\nbetween  water  and  sanitation  and  health  conditions  of  the  community.  The  recognized\nimportance of domestic and personal hygiene, proper water use, and appropriate sanitation will\nencourage communities to change their habits.  These changes will ensure that developments\nimplemented within the Project, such as improved WS&S and water management groups will be\nsustained by the people. An understanding of their importance  to the  health of the  community\nwill ensure this.\n\nc.\n\nInstitutions\n\n22. While there will eventually be an East Timorese water authority (or similar) following the\nwithdrawal of UNTAET, it will be necessary for the current WSA to consider the sustainability of\nthe institutions within the sector. Issues for consideration include cost recovery, corporatization,\nand human resource capability. These issues will  need  to  be  considered early on  in  the  WSA\nprogram,  as  their  solutions  (involving  education,  training,  and  institution  building)  take  a  long\ntime to realize.\n\n\f89\n\nd.\n\nCost Recovery\n\nAppendix 9, page 5\n\n23.\nIn  the  urban  WS&S  systems  there  will  be  the  need,  eventually,  for  full  recovery  of\noperation  and  maintenance  costs,  if  systems  are  to  be  sustained.  In  the  urban  areas,\nparticularly Dili, there will be a decided lack of community management in an everyday utility like\nwater and sanitation, that is, it is taken for granted. Given this, it is essential that recipients are\naware  of  the  price  implications  of  the  substantial  investments  and  operating  costs  involved.\nOther than sustaining the management and operations, tariffs also encourage users to utilize a\nresource more effectively, further increasing sustainability of the water resource itself.\n\ne.\n\nWillingness and Ability to Pay\n\n24.\nAn  essential  component  of  cost  recovery  is  the  community\u2019s  willingness  and  ability  to\npay  or  participate  in  management.  Without  due  regard  for  these  two  issues,  sustainability\nthrough cost recovery cannot be achieved. In the current climate, there is certainly a willingness\nby  consumers  to  participate  in  the  design  and  implementation  process,  and  even  pay  (in  the\ncase of urban supplies), however their capacity (or ability) to do so cannot match this desire. As\nthe economy progresses this situation will change (in varying degrees) and the WSA will need\nto monitor these changes to ensure the threshold is not broached.\n\nf.\n\nAppropriate Technology\n\n25.\nThe  importance  of  appropriate  technology  in  sustainability  was  highlighted  during  the\nfield  visit.  The  team  encountered  problems  with  operation  and  maintenance  in  some  of  the\nemergency  systems  implemented  by  the  United  Nations  and  NGOs.  By  incorporating\ntechnology that is manageable by the community, within their financial capabilities and technical\ncapacities, the extent to which the system will be sustainable will increase. Problems relating to\nthe lack of spare parts and the absence of repairs are also a key concern relating to the transfer\nof  technology  to  rural  communities.  Provision  must  be  included  within  the  program  to  train\ncommunity  members  in  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  facilities  installed.    In  deciding\nappropriate technology mechanisms, consideration must also be made as to how accessible are\nspare  parts.  In  relation  to  operation  and  maintenance,  encouragement  of  the  community  to\nestablish  financial  capabilities  to  sustain  ongoing  maintenance  and  repairs  must  also  be\nconsidered.  Appropriate  technology  also  means  utilization  of  the  most  cost-effective  technical\nsolutions.\n\n4.\n\nUrban and Rural\n\n26.\nFollowing the destruction, there has been a fear that rural groups will relocate to urban\nareas.  There  is  no  conclusive  evidence  to  support  this  at  this  time.  Conversely,  with  the\ncessation of Indonesian rule (and their relocation policies), both urban and rural populations are\ngrappling with land title and occupation issues that impact upon their ability to recover from the\ncrisis.  In  some  cases,  it  is  reported  that  families  are  being  asked  by  original  landowners,  to\nrelocate  to  their  traditional  homelands,  or  to  seek  opportunities  in  urban  areas.  Additionally,\ntown and district borders are being redrawn, families are still returning, and there are sporadic\nmilitia activities within border districts. Overall, there is a sense of change that is still impacting\npeople\u2019s decisions and practices, and will do so until some normality returns.\n\nIt is important, therefore, that all programs are seen to be equitable between urban and\n27.\nrural areas. While urban works will eventually need to show cost recovery, this would be due to\nthe greater investment required. It is essential that this cost should not be borne, even indirectly,\n\n\f90\n\nAppendix 9, page 6\n\nby the  rural population.  Community  water  supplies  may  never be  wholly  economical, however\ntheir small investment costs, combined with linkage to other community development objectives\n(such as self management, empowerment, and community autonomy) may obviate the need for\nsuch criteria.   Additionally,   with  the  relocation  of  some  families  into  urban  areas,  and  the\ndevelopment of improved water and sanitation facilities in  all  communities, it  is  imperative that\nhouseholds'  knowledge  of  appropriate  water  and  hygienic  practices  is  strengthened,  averting\nwastage and misuse.\n\n5.\n\nNon-government Organizations\n\nThere are over 150 international and local NGOs currently operating within East Timor.\n28.\nWith  their  greater  finances  and  support,  the  international  NGOs,  while  doing  great  work  and\noften  working  closely  with  local  NGOs,  are  overshadowing  the  local  organizations.  It  was\nexpressed on many occasions by local groups, that they wanted to have more involvement and\nautonomy within the sector. Indeed, the team agreed that a more dynamic and larger group of\nlocal NGOs would be an asset for the sector, and that the WS&S program should facilitate their\nestablishment, coordination, development, and participation in the sector.\n\nIt  is  important  that  both  local  and  international  NGOs  be  utilized  by  the  program  to\n29.\nensure that the level of impact and ownership within communities is sustained. It is envisaged\nthat  a  number  of  small  local  level  NGOs  will  be  encouraged  to  establish  along  subsector,\ndistrict, or gender lines. Under the Project, it will be necessary to provide considerable support\nto  fostering  the  establishment  and  initial  training  and  support  for  these  NGOs  for  them  to\nundertake these tasks. In addition it will be necessary to provide a coordinating NGO, an East\nTimorese-based  organization,  that  will  be  responsible  for  overseeing  the  establishment  and\ndevelopment of other organizations. It is envisaged that the sectoral NGO, Bia Hula, may play\nthis key role within the Project. The intention is to build local capacity of the East Timor NGOs to\nfacilitate the sustainability of community work within the country.\n\n6.\n\nHealth\n\nPoor  health  conditions  related  to  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  hygiene  practices  exist\n30.\nwidely  throughout  East  Timor. While  poor health  in  itself  is  a  problem,  high  rates  of  morbidity\nadversely impact on poor communities. The increased burden of caring for sick family members,\nas  well  as  a  consequent  reduction  in  productive  activities,  exacerbates  the  already  poor\nsocioeconomic status of the community.\n\n7.\n\nMinority Groups\n\n31.\nEast  Timor  has  no  identified  minority  groups.  Rural  communities  are  the  main\nbeneficiaries  of  the  water  and  sanitation  works,  especially  those  in  the  border  districts  that\nsuffered,  and  continue  to  suffer  the  most  interruption  to  normal  activity.  Nevertheless,  the\nProject aims to ensure that there is equity across districts and between genders and urban and\nrural communities.\n\n8.\n\nResettlement\n\n32.\nIt is expected that the Project will not require any resettlement based on existing service\nlevels. Within urban communities, there may be  some  land tenure  and  land acquisition  issues\nthat may require careful attention.\n\n\f91\n\nAppendix 9, page 7\n\n9.\n\nStakeholder Participation\n\nThe Project framework was developed using a rapid consultative approach, whereby as\n33.\nmany  representative  East  Timorese  and  other  stakeholders  and  decision  makers  were\nconsulted, and participated,  in the formation   of    the   program    objectives    and    components.\nWhile the time frame did not allow for full participation, the team did manage to speak to many\nmen  and  women,  and  various  community  and  political  groups,  at  national,  district,  and\ncommunity levels. Communities and both formal and informal women\u2019s groups were consulted\nextensively throughout the field visits.\n\nIt is essential that communities, local NGOs, and women\u2019s groups be involved in project\n34.\ndesign,  implementation,  and  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  program  components.  It  is\nexpected  that  there  will  be  a  significant  community  focus  in  all  the  water  and  sanitation\nimplementation  components,  in  addition  to  a  separate  overall  public  health  and  community\ndevelopment component.\n\n35.\nThe  Project  emphasizes  the  encouragement  and  strengthening  of  local  water  and\nsanitation NGOs as the catalyst for more comprehensive and response community participation\ninitiatives.\n\nD.\n\nBenefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n\nThe project management unit will supervise, monitor, and review the various contractors\n36.\nduring  implementation.  It  is  expected  that  all  sector  activities  will  be  implemented  through  the\nunit,  which  will  in  turn  coordinate  its  activities  with  the  ongoing  program  of  emergency\nassistance from the United Nations.\n\nA  comprehensive  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  (BME)  program  will  be  developed\n37.\nduring  the  implementation  of  component  1,  and  in  conjunction  with  data  generated  through\nother existing ADB and other International Funding Agency projects. The BME will be employed\nalong  with  the  conventional  project  performance  monitoring  systems  approach.  A  set  of\npredetermined  criteria  and  indicators  will be  identified,  based  on  the  key  information  needs  of\nthe WSA in UNTAET and ADB. BME will be used to assess the progress and implementation of\nthe  use  of  funds  and  delivery  of  public  works  and  infrastructure  activities,  and  measure  the\nimpacts  resulting  from  project  implementation  strategies.  BME  is  important  to  identify  and\naddress priority needs of the intended beneficiaries, and ensure that indicators more accurately\nreflect local experiences.\n\n38.\nKey  areas  for  BME  will  include  (i)  technical  and  physical  aspects,  (ii)  socioeconomic\ndevelopment, and (iii) human and institutional development. Impacts will be measured in terms\nof  increased  community  participation,  public  accountability,  transparency,  better  provision  and\ncoverage  of  basic  services  (especially  for  women  and  the  poor),  and  opportunities  and  direct\nemployment generation.\n\n39.\nIt  is  expected  that  the  BME  will  be  transferred  to  the  new  WSA  following  the  exit  of\nUNTAET,  and  that  the  process  and  outputs  will  form  the  basis  of  a  more  sustainable  and\nstrategic East Timor WSA.\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["ADB\nAusAID\nBPAM\nCNRT\n", "CTA\nGDP\nICRC\nIDA\nNCC\nNGO\nNC\nPDAM\n", "PID\nPMU\nTFET\nUN\nUNDP\nUNICEF\nUNOPS\nUNTAET\nWSA\nWS&S\n", " \n", "ABBREVIATIONS\n", "Asian Development Bank\nAustralian Agency for International Development\nBadan Pengelola Air Minum (District Water Board)\nConselho Nacional Resistencia Timorense\n(National Council of Timorese Resistance)\nchief technical adviser\ngross domestic product\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross\nInternational Development Association\nNational Consultative Council\nnongovernment organization\nNational Council\nPerusahaan Daerah Air Minum\n(Local Government Water Enterprise)\nprogram implementation document\nProject Management Unit\nTrust Fund for East Timor\nUnited Nations\nUnited Nations Development Programme\nUnited Nations International Children's Fund\nUnited Nations Office of Project Services\nUnited Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor\nWater and Sanitation Authority\nwater supply and sanitation\n", "\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n", "\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n", "\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n", "NOTES\n", "(i) \n", "UNTAET's fiscal year is from 1 July to 30 June.\n", "CONTENTS\n", "PROJECT SUMMARY\n", "THE PROPOSAL\n", "INTRODUCTION\n", "MAP\n", "I.\n", "II.\n", "III.\n", "IV. \n", "BACKGROUND\nA.\nB.\nC.\nD.\n", "Description of Damage\nResponse to the Crisis\nWater Supply and Sanitation Sector\nExternal Assistance and Donor Coordination\n", "THE REHABILITATION ASSISTANCE\nA.\nB.\nC.\nD.\nE.\nF.\nG.\nH.\nI.\nJ.\n", "Rationale\nObjectives\nScope\nCost Estimates\nFinancing Plan\nExecuting Agency\nImplementation Arrangements\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\nProject Justification\nImpact on Extreme Poverty\n", "Page\n", "ii\n", "v\n", "1\n", "1\n", "1\n1\n2\n4\n8\n", "10\n10\n11\n11\n14\n14\n15\n15\n18\n20\n20\n", "21\n", "V.\n", "APPROVAL\n", "APPENDIXES\n", "                                22\n"]}
