I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Water Sector \nInvestment Program. \n \n2.  The investment program will help water supply companies in Viet Nam to improve their \nperformance. It will support capital investment in water companies and cofinance the National \nNonrevenue Water (NRW) Program. The program will utilize an MFF to provide longer-term \nsupport for institutional reform in the Viet Nam water sector until 2020. The MFF will be used as \nseed  money  to  leverage  parallel  cofinancing  and,  importantly,  gain  access  to  commercial \nfinance and increased private sector participation. Four pilot cities\u2014Da Nang, Haiphong, Ho Chi \nMinh City (HCMC), and Hue\u2014were identified for project preparation in 2008.1 The first periodic \nfinancing request (PFR) will cover HCMC. Subsequent tranches will finance part of the National \nNRW  Program  and  investment  subprograms  consisting  of  water  supply  infrastructure  for \nprovincial water companies, duplicating the model established with HCMC in PFR1.  Several \ncities have initiated discussions with the government to finance future tranches totaling over \n$300 million for water production plants, transmission and distribution networks. \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Sector performance. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) water and sanitation sector \nassessment  strategy  and  road  map2 shows  that  Viet  Nam\u2019s  water  sector  has  significantly \nimproved coverage since 1995. However, significant gaps remain in the quality and reliability of \nservice.  Areas  requiring  water  companies\u2019  attention  are  (i)  financial  sustainability,  (ii)  the \nefficiency and accountability of decentralized sector institutions, and (iii) data on utility assets \nand performance. The proposed program will address those three areas. Further, NRW in Viet \nNam cities is still unacceptably high, averaging 30% and reaching 40%.3 To meet government \ntargets and improve the financial viability of water companies, considerable effort is required to \nidentify losses and mount a program of massive pipe replacement. ADB will support operational \nwork on distribution networks necessary to identify causes of NRW and finance pipe repair and \nreplacement. ADB\u2019s proposed methodology promotes water company ownership of the NRW \nreduction program by including NRW as a core target of operation and maintenance.  \n \n4.  Policy framework. The policy and legal basis for the sector is relatively strong, as the \ngovernment  issued  two  key  decisions  detailing  a  clear  vision  and  setting  targets  and \nimplementation  measures.  The  water  supply  decree4 transforms  water  from  a  social  to  a \ncommercial  commodity  and  requires  water  supply  tariffs  to  be  set  for  full  cost  recovery, \n                                                 \n1  The findings of project preparatory technical assistance were consolidated into the investment program: ADB. \n2008. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Preparing the Da Nang Water Supply Project. \nManila (TA 7144-VIE); ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Preparing \nHaiphong Water Supply Project. Manila (TA 7151-VIE); ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic \nof Viet Nam for Preparing HCMC Water Supply Project. Manila (TA 7091-VIE); ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to \nthe Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Preparing Hue Water Supply Project. Manila (TA 7089-VIE). \n2  The document was completed in June 2010 by the ADB Viet Nam water team.  \n3  NRW is the portion of water produced but not sold because of physical losses from old pipes and poor installation, \ncommercial  losses  from  stolen  water,  defective  meters,  and  non-commercial  uses  such  as  cleaning  and  \nfirefighting. NRW below 20% indicates a very good operation of the distribution network. \n4  Decree 117/2007/ND-CP on Clean Water Production, Supply and Consumption ", "2 \naddressing the main recommendation5 from ADB\u2019s Independent Evaluation Department. The \norientation plan for urban water supply6 and the Decision on NRW7 set ambitious targets for the \nwater sector, in particular for reducing NRW to 25% by 2015 and 18% by 2020. The objectives \nof the government\u2019s current socioeconomic development plan, 2006\u20132010 for the water sector \ninclude providing essential water supply and sanitation infrastructure to poor households in \ncities and towns across the country and enhancing cost recovery for infrastructure investments \nby setting and collecting appropriate tariffs and fees. ADB\u2019s sector program in its country \nstrategy and program, 2007\u20132010 is consistent with these policies and was confirmed by the \ncountry operations business plan, 2009\u20132011 and the midterm review of the country strategy \nand program in 2009.8 The strategy explicitly aims to give substance to the government\u2019s \ninitiatives to decentralize planning, financing, and decision making and to support the current \nlegal  framework  in  the  water  sector.  The  investment  program  will  contribute  to  the  water \noperational framework,9 which emphasizes water availability and water security. The investment \nprogram  improves  efficiency  in  the  water  sector  and  addresses  the  supply\u2013demand  gap, \nresource protection, storage improvement, the impact of technology (especially for NRW), and \nhealth through the implementation of water safety plans10 to provide drinking water.  \n \n5.  Multitranche financing facility. Ongoing project preparatory technical assistance for \nwater supply projects in Viet Nam highlights the need to provide flexible financing to support \nlonger-term, phased investment and implementation of institutional reform. As several cities \nhave requested ADB financing, a series of stand-alone investment loans would be inadequate. \nA  program  or  sector  loan  would  not  provide  the  necessary  supervision  during  project \nimplementation to address shortcomings in the new legislative framework for the sector. It is too \nearly to implement credit lines to financial institutions pending the new legislation on public\u2013\nprivate partnerships and the water law.  \n \n6.  Project 1. HCMC is Viet Nam\u2019s largest city and an important commercial and industrial \ncenter. Its population of 7.1 million is growing by 3.5% per annum and likely to surpass 10 \nmillion by 2020. While Viet Nam\u2019s gross domestic product is growing by more than 8% per \nannum, HCMC\u2019s gross domestic product is growing substantially faster, by 11%. This growth \nrate is seriously straining the city\u2019s infrastructure, including the water supply system. In addition, \nHCMC is one of the 10 cities in the world likely to experience the early impacts of climate \nchange, in particular a projected sea level rise of 33 centimeters by 2050. \n \n7.  Saigon  Water  Corporation  (SAWACO),  set  up  in  1874,  is  Viet  Nam\u2019s  oldest  water \ncompany and responsible for water supply in HCMC. It has operated since 2004 as a state-\nowned  one-member  company  limited  under  the  Commercial  Law,  2005.  Six  distribution \ncompanies, incorporated as joint stock companies and 51% owned by SAWACO, and two other \ncompanies under SAWACO are in charge of distribution in HCMC. SAWACO has proposed a \n                                                 \n5  ADB, 2009.

SAWACO has asked ADB to help formulate \na private sector development framework during program implementation. The framework will \ndefine which investments in the $2.8 billion investment plan of SAWACO (until 2025) can be \nfinanced by the private sector as well as improve the enabling environment to attract such \nfinancing. A similar framework will be developed for the other cities to optimize ADB lending.  \n \n8.  For Project 1 in HCMC, the water supply system has five major production plants with a \ntotal capacity of 1.34 million cubic meters per day (m3/day) and 3,800 kilometers (km) of \ndistribution  network  with  734,000  connections,  divided  into  six  zones.  The  fundamental \nconstraint on the water supply system is a shortfall in transmission capacity. Actual coverage is \nestimated at 82%, but large areas of HCMC, especially in the south, still suffer intermittent water \nsupply because of low service pressure. The proposed investment program is in line with \nHCMC\u2019s draft master plan to be approved in 2011, whose objectives are to achieve universal \ncoverage, continuous water supply, and drinking water quality in HCMC by 2025. \n \n9.  HCMC\u2019s NRW is estimated at 40%. The World Bank supports a number of initiatives \nunder way to reduce NRW in the city center zones 1 and 2, and the Government of the \nNetherlands supports an ongoing Utility Support Program. ADB\u2019s assistance is sought for NRW \nin the two southern zones 5 and 6. Private sector participation is being explored for capital \ninvestment in NRW and the operation and maintenance of the network in the northern zones 3 \nand 4. Two water production plants are operated by the private sector: Binh An, under a build\u2013\noperate\u2013transfer contract and Thu Duc 2, under a build\u2013own\u2013operate contract. \n \n10.  The investment program will mitigate poverty by improving coverage and the provision of \nbasic services in HCMC. Addressing the most urgent constraints on SAWACO, it will increase \ndistribution capacity to benefit 475,000 households in zones 1 and 3 with improved pressure \nand coverage by installing a transmission pipe with a diameter of 2,400 millimeters (mm) for \ntreated water; improve pressure and coverage for 33,872 households in zones 3, 4, 5, and 6 by \nrehabilitating and replacing distribution pipes; provide 13,273 poor households with water supply \nfor the first time and 6,500 poor households that previously shared connections with their own \nconnection  for  first  time;  strengthen  operational  management  through  a  comprehensive \ninformation and communication technology program; and (iii) support the development of a \nclimate change action plan and strengthen safeguards for SAWACO.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The impact will be the sustainable provision of safe water in Viet Nam. The outcome will \nbe improved efficiency in Viet Nam\u2019s water companies.   \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n12.  The outputs will be (i) increased coverage\u2014in line with the requirement of the draft \nsocioeconomic development plan, 2011\u20132015 and the orientation plan for urban water supply to \n2025 (footnote 6)\u2014from 59% in 2010 to 90% by 2020; (ii) improved business planning through \nthe drafting of annual business plans, financial management targeting self-financing ratios11 of \n                                                 \n11 Revenues required for full cost recovery must be sufficient to cover operation and maintenance costs prior to \ndepreciation, increases in working capital, and debt service, plus a minimum of 10% of average capital expenditure \nover a 3-year period (previous year, current year, and next year). \n ", "4 \n20%  and  debt  service  ratios12 of  1.20,  and  asset  management  with  adequate  information \ntechnology; and (iii) NRW reduction by at least 1% per annum, in line with the orientation plan \nfor urban water supply to 2025 (footnote 7), which calls for reducing NRW from 30% in 2010 to \n25% by 2015 and 18% by 2020. \n \n13.  The outputs of project 1 will consist of (i) a 10 km treated water pipeline with a diameter \nof 2,400 mm to extend and strengthen transmission capacity, thereby improving the security \nand reliability of water supply, service pressure, and continuous service; (ii) managing a pipe \nreplacement program to reduce NRW and a network extension program; (iii) implementing an \ninformation  and  communication  technology  program  to  strengthen  SAWACO\u2019s  operational \nmanagement  with  integrated  software,  sustained  capacity  building,  improved  financial \ninformation  systems,  human  resources  development,  business  and  strategic  planning, \nmanagement information systems, a supervisory control and data acquisition system, and a \ngeographical  information  system  for  planning  and  operation;  and  (iv)  helping  SAWACO  to \nprepare a disaster management plan to ensure continued service during natural disasters and a \nwater  conservation  and  safety  plan,  as  well  as  achieve  International  Organization  for \nStandardization certification for performance benchmarking and continuous improvement. \n \n14.  Technical assistance under project 1 will implement institutional reforms mostly under \nthe information and communication technology component. The geographic information system \nwill allow asset inventory and management, and the management and financial information \nsystems will allow the monitoring of benchmarking and the continuous improvement process.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n15.  The government intends to invest $2.78 billion in the Viet Nam water sector by 2020. It \nhas requested an MFF of up to $1.00 billion from ADB's ordinary capital resources to help \nfinance  the  investment.  The  MFF  will  have  several  tranches,  subject  to  the  government's \nsubmission  of  PFRs;  execution  of  loan  and  project  agreements;  and  fulfillment  of  terms, \nconditions, and undertakings set forth in the framework financing agreement. The indicative \ninvestment plan for the MFF is in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Indicative Investment Program (MFF: 2011\u20132020)  \n ($ million) \nPFR1  PFR2  PFR3  PFR4 \nCities  2011  2011  2013  2015  Total \nHo Chi Minh City  138        138 \nDa Nang    47  30    77 \nHue    40  20  20  80 \nHai Phong    63  0  0  63 \nNonrevenue water    0  100  150  250 \nFuture cities    50  150  192  392 \nTotal   138   200   300   362  1,000 \n       MFF = multitranche financing facility; PFR = periodic financing request. \n   Note: The schedule and amounts are indicative, to be confirmed year to year by the country \n   programming mission.

The financing plan for the investment program and project 1 for HCMC is in Table 3. The \ngovernment, water companies, and other development partners will finance $1.782 billion of the \ninvestment program. The amount of counterpart funds will be defined for each tranche and set \nat over 10% to cover taxes, duties, commitment charges in full and part of the safeguard costs. \nSome development partners have expressed interest in cofinancing subsequent tranches of the \nMFF to help the government meet its funding requirement, in parallel to ADB financing, which \nwill remain within $1 billion. Physical contingencies are computed at 10% of base costs. Price \ncontingencies on foreign exchange costs are computed at 1.0% for 2010, 0.0% for 2011, 0.3% \nfor 2012, and 0.5% for 2013 and thereafter. Price contingencies on local costs are computed at \n5.0% for 2010 and 6.0% for 2011 and thereafter. \n \nTable 3: Financing Plan for Investment Program and Project 1 \n \nAmount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)    (%) \nInvestment Program       \nAsian Development Bank  1,000    36 \nGovernment/Development Partners  1,782    64 \nTotal  2,782    100 \nProject 1       \nAsian Development Bank  138    90 \nGovernment  16    10 \nTotal  154    100 \nSource: Project preparatory technical assistance consultant. \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2010.

The Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) will be the coordinating agency and \nselect water companies to access financing for each tranche. The selected candidates will be \ndiscussed at the country programming mission and country programming confirmation mission \nbetween ADB and the government. It will also consolidate reporting with the assistance of water \ncompanies selected under each tranche. ADB will provide technical assistance to the MPI for \nreporting, monitoring, and dissemination. \n \n20.  For project 1 in 2010, project management will be delegated to HCMC. The project \nowner and executing agency, SAWACO, will set up a project management unit (PMU) within the \ncompany. For subsequent tranches, ADB will perform due diligence on feasibility study reports \nfollowing  the  prescribed  format  agreed  between  the  government  and  the  development \npartners.14 ADB and the government will appraise the proposed projects and discuss with the \nMPI and each water company the scheduling and financing plan under each tranche during the \ncountry programming mission and country programming confirmation mission.  \n \n21.  Implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the \nfacility administration manual for the MFF and the project administration manual for project 1.15  \n \nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \n \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period   Investment program: April 2011 \u2013 December 2020 \nProject 1: April  2011 \u2013 December 2015 \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2021 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  MPI, Foreign Economic Relations Department \n(ii)   Executing agency  Project 1: Saigon Water Corporation, Ho Chi Minh City \nFor subsequent tranches, other water companies \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  Water companies \n(iv)  Implementation unit  Project management unit set up within the water company, as authorized and \ndefined by Viet Nam legislation \nProcurement  All works and goods to be financed under the MFF will be procured in \naccordance with ADB Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). \nConsulting services  All consulting services to be financed under the MFF will be procured in \naccordance with ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). \nRetroactive financing and  Under each tranche, ADB may, subject to its policies and procedures, allow on \nadvance contracting  request (i) advance contracting and (ii) retroactive financing of up to 10% of the \nproposed individual loan for eligible expenditures incurred prior to loan \neffectiveness but not earlier than 12 months before the date of signing of the \nrelated legal agreement.  \nDisbursement  Loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements \nagreed upon between ADB and the government. \nADB = Asian Development Bank; MFF = multitranche financing facility; MPI = Ministry of Planning and Investment. \nSource: ADB project team.   \n \n                                                 \n14 Decision  48/2008/QD-TTg  on  Common  General  Guidelines  on  Feasibility  Study  Preparation  for  Official  \nDevelopment Assistance Projects. \n15 Facility Administration Manual; Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n ", "7 \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n22.  In parallel with the MFF, the project team is processing a series of technical assistance \nand associated projects. A $1.5 million capacity development technical assistance grant in \n2011\u20132012 will help water companies participating in future tranches of the MFF and water \ncompanies in the Third Provincial Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Project16 improve their \nefficiency by supporting their preparation of operational business plans and action plans to meet \nagreed performance indicators. The technical assistance will also outline the National NRW \nProgram and build capacity in the MPI to coordinate and report on the MFF in 2011 and 2012. \nTwo grants of $2 million each from the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility will finance \ninvestment to improve energy efficiency in 2011 and 2012. Two grants of $3 million each will \naddress water supply to remote and rural locations in the provinces of Hue in 2011 and Da \nNang in 2012. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n23.  Project preparation for HCMC was completed in March 2010, and due diligence has \nbeen carried out for project 1. The ADB project team set a tariff increase as a condition for \nappraisal. After 6 years without any tariff review, HCMC pushed through a long overdue water \ntariff increase of 48% that became effective in March 2010, with further annual increases of 10% \nuntil 2013. The road map for water tariffs in HCMC will be revised at the midterm review in \n2013.  \n \n24.  As the investment program will be financed through loans from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources for the first time in the water sector in Viet Nam, participating water companies will \nneed to demonstrate a strong commitment to institutional reform. The primary selection criterion \nfor projects to be financed in subsequent tranches is a demonstrated commitment to operating \nat  full  cost  recovery  through  water  tariff  reform  (including  an  increased  water  tariff,  an \nagreement on a water tariff road map, and the phasing out of subsidies and direct charges) \nlinked  to  hard  targets  for  selected  performance  indicators.  Other  selection  criteria  are  a \ncommitment to national water policies such as (i) agreement on a service contract and business \nplan; (ii) NRW reduction by 10% over 10 years, or to 18% by 2020; (iii) over 90% coverage in \nurban areas and 70% in rural areas by 2020; and (iv) implementation of water safefy plans from \nWorld Health Organization, in order to provide access to safe water. \n \nA.  Technical \n \n25.  SAWACO  is  completing  detailed  design  of  the  $57.5  million  10  km,  2,400  mm \ntransmission pipe, with construction to start as soon as the loan is declared effective or to be \nfinanced retroactively if loan effectiveness is delayed. The framework financing agreement \nprovides selection criteria for projects\u2019 eligibility for financing under the MFF, which include \nfeasibility study reports being vetted and approved by the government and ADB. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n26.  Financial and economic analyses have been done for project 1 in HCMC. The financial \ninternal rate of return is 8.7%, above the weighted average cost of capital of 2.44%. The \neconomic internal rate of return for the first tranche is 24.5%, well above the social opportunity \n                                                 \n16 ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the \nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Third Provincial Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Project. Manila (Loan \n1880-VIE). \n ", "8 \ncost of capital of 12%. Sensitivity analysis indicates good financial and economic internal rates \nof return (reduced to 6% and 17%, respectively) under a 2-year delay in project implementation \nand increase in capital cost of 20%. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n27.  SAWACO\u2019s financial management and procurement capacity have been assessed. A \nproject administration manual has been completed for project 1, as has a facility administration \nmanual for the MFF. PMU staff for projects 1 and 2 have started training on ADB systems and \nprocedures for procurement and disbursement, which will continue in 2011.  \n \n28.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to the MPI and \nSAWACO. Specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the \nfacility administration manual for the MFF and the project administration manual for project 1 \n(footnote 15). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n29.  HCMC\u2019s overall poverty rate of 12% disguises poverty rates of more than 50% in some \nwards and districts. The urban poor are both long-term residents and migrant households. \nSurveys show a low incidence of waterborne disease. Satisfaction with SAWACO\u2019s service is \ngood overall, despite some dissatisfaction because of poor water quality. Among households \nconnected to piped water, 84% have individual connections, 12% shared connections with their \nown meter, and 4% shared connections with a shared meter. Many households buy water from \ntankers  and  pay  almost  twice  the  official  water  tariff  of D4,000\u2013D10,000  per  cubic  meter. \nAlthough policy dictates free connections, the tertiary distribution network is obviously lacking \nand will be extended under the program by the component that rehabilitates and replaces pipes. \n \n30.  The  social  assessment  concluded  that  information  dissemination,  education,  and \ncommunication are required at the ward level. The social development services subcomponent \nunder project 1 aims to increase community participation in water supply services. The focus will \nbe on strengthening the role of the ward-level community supervision boards in project areas by \nimproving members\u2019 knowledge of the water supply system and proposed works, including \nresettlement,  improving  capacity  in  community  participation  and  monitoring,  and  improving \ncoordination among members.  \n \n31.  Project 1 is categorized as effective in gender mainstreaming. A gender assessment in \nHCMC during preparation for project 1 found that women play a key role in ensuring that water \nis available in the home, collecting and paying for water, and teaching children about water \nconservation. The Women\u2019s Union is neither formally included in any water decision-making \nbody nor consulted by SAWACO. Key gender issues to be addressed by the project include \n(i) the gender and poverty implications of water access and usage; (ii) women\u2019s increased \ninvolvement  in  water  utility  agencies,  community  supervision  boards,  and  operation  and \nmaintenance; and (iii) sex-disaggregated data on poverty and water supply access. \n \n32.  Project 1 includes a gender action plan17 that ensures (i) the development of a road map \nfor water tariff increases that considers gender and affordability issues; (ii) network extension \ncovers 100% of households headed by women in project areas; (iii) the implementation of the \nwater supply decree (footnote 5) to ensure lifeline tariff and free connections are provided to \n                                                 \n17 The gender action plan will be implemented through the safeguard component under a social development \nservices subcomponent. \n ", "9 \n100%  of  households  headed  by  women,  as  part  of  water  for  all;  (iv)  women\u2019s  priority \nemployment in operation and maintenance at the commune or ward level; (v) the participation of \nwomen  and  the  Women\u2019s  Union  in  ward  committees;  (vi)  gender-sensitive  information \ndissemination,  education,  and  communication  using  community  women  as  facilitators  for \ntraining  delivery;  (vii)  that  50%  of  newly  recruited  PMU  staff  are  women  and  that  equal \nemployment and training opportunities are provided to women through the project; and (viii) \nimproved  gender  awareness  through  the  training  of  directors  of  SAWACO,  its  distribution \ncompanies, the PMU, and consultants and the inclusion in the project monitoring system of a \nsex-disaggregated database. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n33.  The project is classified category B as resettlement is largely limited to where the 2,400 \nmm treated water pipeline will be constructed, together with road widening. Pipe replacement \nand extension will use existing rights of way, where possible. Conventional civil works will be \nemployed to lay the 2,400 mm pipeline in three sections of the selected corridor. A resettlement \nframework was prepared, instead of a resettlement plan, because the alignment and routing of \nthe pipelines will be finalized only during detailed design. The resettlement framework and \nresettlement plan for one subcomponent was prepared according to government regulations \nand ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and in consultation with local communities and \nauthorities. The cost estimates include the provision of $0.6 million for resettlement cost and \n$250,000 for monitoring and evaluating resettlement. \n \n34.  The project is classified category B for environmental impacts. An initial environmental \nexamination was undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement to assess \npotential  environmental  impacts  and  propose  mitigation  and  institutional  arrangements.  It \nindicates that adverse environmental impacts will be insignificant. The PMU will prepare an \nannual  monitoring  report  for  submission  to  the  Department  of  Natural  Resources  and \nEnvironment for endorsement before submission to ADB. \n \n35.  Ethnic minority households are well integrated into mainstream urban society in all \naspects of life, including language, clothing, housing, and economic activities. The project is \ncategorized C, since it will have positive impacts on ethnic minorities, as it improves access to \nwater. \n \n36.  Preparation of future tranches preparation will be guided by the safeguard framework \ndocuments18 and loan fact-finding missions will secure the compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement for each tranche.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n37.  The major risks are as follows:  \n(i)  The  central  and  local  governments  may  delay  processing  because  of  the \nstructuring of this first sectoral MFF in Viet Nam and the new decision (footnote \n14) defining a new format for feasibility studies for projects financed by official \ndevelopment assistance (ODA), which was not well received by local government \nagencies or ministries. The project team asked the MPI to help build awareness \nin local governments of the new requirement for feasibility study reports.  \n                                                 \n18 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework; Resettlement Framework; Indigenous Peoples Planning \nFramework; and a Gender Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n(ii)  Local governments may fail to enforce water tariff increases for full cost recovery, \nthreatening the financial sustainability of the investment program. Substantial \ntariff increases, a road map to full cost recovery, and the phasing out of subsidies \nto comply with Viet Nam legislation are conditions for subprojects\u2019 qualifying for \nfinancing under the MFF.  \n(iii)  The equitization of water companies without adequate oversight will not improve \nservice delivery. Without a service contract or a business plan, water companies \nare accountable only to make a best effort. Another regulatory issue is water \ncompanies venturing outside their core business into high-risk investments such \nas real estate. Under the MFF, water companies will ring-fence the accounts for \nwater operation and report in a transparent manner performance data, as a \nprecondition to attract investment capital from ODA or the private sector. \n(iv)  Political  interference  can  undermine  successful  implementation  and  financial \nsustainability. The project will strengthen awareness through high-level advocacy \nof the benefits of reliable water supply and financially strong and accountable \nwater companies in Viet Nam and the region. \n(v)  Decentralization and granting greater autonomy to local government agencies \nand utilities are not matched with improved accountability to consumers or higher \nlevels of government. The project performance management system introduces \nnew  meaningful  indicators  on  financial  sustainability.  The  government  is \nimplementing benchmarking through the Ministry of Construction and the Viet \nNam Water Supply and Sewerage Association. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n38.  The government, the MPI, and SAWACO have assured ADB that implementation of the \ninvestment program and project 1 shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those \nconcerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n39.  The government and the MPI have given ADB certain undertakings for the MFF, as set \nforth in the framework financing agreement. Specific covenants agreed by the government, the \nMPI, and water companies with respect to individual tranches under the MFF will be set forth in \nthe loan agreement and project agreement for each tranche.  \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n40.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the provision of loans under the multitranche financing facility in an aggregate principal \namount not exceeding $1,000,000,000 to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Water \nSector  Investment  Program  from  ADB's  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB's LIBOR-based lending facility, and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the framework financing \nagreement presented to the Board.  \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n31 January 2011 \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK FOR THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nSustainable provision  Contribute to meeting  Completion reports  MFF implemented as \nof safe water in Viet  national targets in    designed \nNam  Orientation Plan 2025:  Annual water sector report   \ncoverage by central water    Risk \nsupply system up from  Benchmarking surveys from  Government's policies not \n59% in urban areas in 2010  development partners and  enforced \nto 90% in 2020, and NRW  Ministry of Construction and   \ndown from 30% in 2010 to  Viet Nam Water Supply and \n18%\u201325% in 2020  Sewerage Association \n   \nIncrease of connections to  Annual project report,  \n100% of households  completion reports \nheaded by women in the   \nproject area   Water quality analysis  \n   \nProvision of safe water by  Customer satisfaction \n2025 by the water  surveys and ISO 24510 \ncompanies financed under   \nthe investment program  WHO Water safety plans \nOutcome      Assumptions \nEfficiency of water  Meet target of water supply  Local government decision  Creditworthiness of water \nsupply companies  decree 117/2007 by (i)  on tariff increase  companies \nimproved   increasing tariffs to achieve     \nfull cost recovery with each  Loan review mission report  Management empowered to \ntranche, (ii) defining within    change and accountable \n1 year and monitoring  Completion reports   \nthroughout program    Risk \nimplementation up to 10  Business operations plan  Political interference \nperformance indicators for    preventing successful \nimproved operational  Legal status of water  implementation and financial \nefficiency, and (iii) water  companies  sustainability \ncompanies becoming     \nequitized and operating     \nwith autonomy from local   \ngovernment   \n   \nAchieve AIM and ISO  AIM and ISO certification \ncertification 9001, 14001, \n18000, 24510, and 24512 \nand implement a \ncontinuous improvement \nprocess by 2020 \nOutputs       Assumptions \n1.
