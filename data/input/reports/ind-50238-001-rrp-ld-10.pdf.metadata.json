A securitization enables a lender to pool part of its loan assets together and sell them to \ndifferent investor(s). It allows pooling of different assets such as mortgage loans, micro-, small- \nand medium-sized enterprise (MSME) loans, micro-finance loans, etc. and the interest / principal \nrepayments from such pooled assets will form the monthly cash flows to investors, such as banks. \nThe pooled assets are typically parked into a special purpose vehicle (SPV), which in turn issues \nsecurities  (often  referred  to  as  pass-through  certificates  or  PTCs)  to  the  investor(s).  The \ninvestor(s) does not take any credit risk on the originator of the pooled assets but rather the assets \nheld by the SPV. Thus, the credit rating of the SPV can be higher than that of the originator. The \nrating can be further increased by offering credit enhancements in the form of cash collateral or \nbank / corporate guarantees (which can cover defaults to an extent). The credit enhancement can \nalso be offered if an institution subscribes to the subordinate or junior tranche of the securities \nissued by an SPV, allowing the senior tranche to get a priority in the cash flows generated. Thus, \na partial default is covered by the first loss provider (cash collateral / guarantee provided by the \noriginator) and then the second loss provider, before it impacts the investor(s).  \n \n2.  Northern Arc Capital Limited (NACL) typically invests in such junior tranches, giving \ninvestors the additional comfort needed (and a rating upgrade) for investing in these asset \nclasses. Securitizations allow banks to meet priority sector lending (PSL) requirements1 as the \nsecurities they purchase (where the underlying pool of assets are PSL-compliant), count as \nlending to the priority sector by the Reserve Bank of India.  \n \n3.  The diagrammatic representation of a securitization transaction is in Figure 1. \n \n4.  The cash flows and the agencies involved in a securitization transaction are shown in Figure \n2. \n \n    \nFigure 1: Securitization Tr ansaction Representation  \n \nObligor \n \nRepayments   Credit  \n \nOriginator  \n \n Sale   Sale Proceeds  \n  Protection   \nSpecial Purpose \nRating Agency    Rating   Credit Enhancer    \n  Vehicle / Trustee \nFee   \nFee   \n \n \nUnderwriter   \n  Securities    Rupees    \nInvestors    \n \nSource: Franklin Templeton India. \n \n \n1  Priority sector lending (PSL) is a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) requirement to support financial inclusion whereby, as \nper the current guidelines, commercial banks must lend at least 40% of their adjusted net bank credit of the previous \nyear to specified priority sectors, such as agriculture, micro-,  small- and medium-sized enterprises and export-\noriented industries, with a focus on rural borrowers.
