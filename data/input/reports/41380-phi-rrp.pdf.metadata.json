Subprogram  1  is  proposed  to  be \nsupported by a loan of $300 million to be released in two tranches.  \n \n\n \n\nTarget Classification: General intervention \nSector Classification: Law, economic management, and public \npolicy \nSubsectors: National government administration, law and judiciary, \npublic finance and expenditure management \nThemes: Governance, capacity development \nSubtheme: Public governance, anticorruption, institutional   \ndevelopment  \n\nCategory C \n\nInvoluntary resettlement \u2013 Category C \nImpact on indigenous people \u2013 Category C \n\nfrom \n\nsuffers \n\nPhilippines \n\nProgram Rationale.  The \npoor \nperceptions of  governance  as  captured  in  social  weather  surveys, \ninvestment  climate  surveys,  and  international  comparisons.  While \nprogress is being made in macroeconomic management and fiscal \nstability,  other  performance  indicators  have  deteriorated,  including \nthose  of  corruption.  Recognizing  these  challenges,  the  Medium-\nTerm  Philippine  Development  Plan  2004\u20132010  (MTPDP)  lays  out \nthe  agenda  to  improve  institutions  and  governance  outcomes \nthrough actions that will enhance both the supply and demand for \ngood governance. MTPDP includes an extensive discussion on the \nrule  of  law  and  needed  governance  reforms  in  justice  sector \ninstitutions.  On  the  supply  side  of  the  reform  dynamics,  the \nGovernment, as the provider of public goods and service delivery, \nis undertaking a multi-year reform program to strengthen the state\u2019s \nadministrative  capability\u2014skills,  incentives  and  salaries,  human \nresources,  and  financial  management  systems\u2014to  deliver  public \ngoods and services at both the national and local government level. \nfactors  are \nThe  Government \nnecessary, but not sufficient to improve public services and reduce \ncorruption.  Demand-led  \u201cvoice\u201d  and  empowerment  elements  are \nalso  needed  to  strengthen  accountability  arrangements.  A  vibrant \ncivil society, coupled with measures in support of transparency and \naccountability,  provides  an  incentive  to  change  behavior  and \nimprove the public service performance of government institutions. \n\nthat  supply-side \n\nrecognizes \n\n \n\n \n Borrower \n \nThe Proposal \n\n \n\n \n \nClassification \n\n \n \n \n \nEnvironmental \nAssessment \n \nSocial Sector \nAssessment \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nii\n\nCivil  society  and  nongovernmental  organization  stakeholders  play \nan  important  role  in  sustaining  policy  dialogue  on  justice  sector \nreforms.  These  groups  hold  strong  interests  that  protect  the \nreforms  from  state  capture,  and  their  advocacy  during  policy \ndialogue  makes  the  justice  sector  and  government  actions  more \nresponsive to the needs of its users. \n \nThe  MTPDP  envisions  a  judiciary  that  is  independent,  effective, \nand efficient, resulting from a holistic and integrated reform effort in \nthe  justice  system.  In  addition,  it  recognizes  the  important  link \nbetween  the  rule  of  law  and  institutional  reforms  in  the  justice \nsector,  and  a  strategy  to  fight  poverty  and  promote  inclusive \ngrowth. \n\n \n\nincentives \n\nThe  justice  sector  is  an  interlocking  set  of  agencies  that  includes \nthe  judiciary,  which  is  an  independent  branch  of  government,  and \nagencies  from  the  executive  branch,  including  the  institutions \nresponsible  for  prosecutions,  enforcement,  corrections,  penology, \nand public legal assistance. Improving the public service delivery of \njustice  sector  agencies  requires  a  number  of  interlinked  reforms, \nto  deliver  public  services, \nincluding  strengthened \nenhanced  expenditure  and  budget  management  capabilities, \naccountability  for  the  use  of  resources,  more  efficient  delivery  of \njustice,  greater  citizen  voice  and  participation,  and  increased \naccess to justice.    \n \nA key factor in the weakness of justice sector institutions has been \npoor  incentives  and  a  lack  of  financial  resources  that  have \nconstrained expenditures and capacities, and ultimately resulted in \npoor  public  service  delivery.  The  impact  of  budgetary  constraints \nhas  led  justice  sector  agencies  to  prioritize  recurrent  expenses \n(primarily  personnel).  Budgetary  compression  has  also  resulted  in \nlow  salaries  that  when  coupled  with  antiquated  equipment  and \ninfrastructure  create  vacancies  in  staff  positions  and  disincentives \nfor  efficient  performance.  Resource  constraints  also  make  justice \nsector agencies\u2014particularly the judiciary, prosecution service, and \ninfluence,  which \nlaw  enforcement\u2014susceptible \nundermines  the  independence  of  courts  and  the  integrity  of  other \njustice  sector  agencies.  Justice  sector \nfiscal  management \ncapabilities,  particularly  in  budget  planning  that  can  play  an \nin  spite  of \nimportant  role \ngovernment  budget  constraints,  is  currently  weak.  This  prevents \njustice  sector  agencies  from  defending  their  budget  requests  and \nobtaining the resources that they need. The absence of resources \nin  justice  sector  agencies  to  exercise  stronger  oversight  functions \nconcerning  their  field  offices  and  the  dearth  of  transparent \nprocedures and accountability mechanisms with respect to the use \nof  public  funds  contribute  to  the  perception  that  the  agencies  are \nsusceptible to corruption.  \n \n\nin  strengthening \n\nfiscal  autonomy \n\nto  external \n\n  \n\n \n\n\fiii \n\n \n\nfor \n\nADB\u2019s  focus  on  governance,  macroeconomic  management,  public \nexpenditure  management,  and  anticorruption  in  the  Philippines  is \nanchored  in  ADB\u2019s  Development  Policy  Support  Program  for  the \nPhilippines,  which  complements  and  reinforces  ADB\u2019s  sector  loan \nprograms  and  projects  that  are  aligned  with  the  Government\u2019s \nstrategies.  The  Development  Policy  Support  Program  sets  out \nbroad  policy  outcomes \nimproving  public  expenditure \nmanagement, but leaves the rollout to sector programs such as the \nLocal  Government  Finance  and  Budget  Reform  Program  and  the \nproposed Governance in Justice Sector Reform Program (GJSRP). \nThe  proposed  GJSRP  will  support  increased  budget  resources  to \nthe  justice  sector  and  improved  expenditure  management  through \nthe rollout of the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF), the \noperational performance indicators framework (OPIF), and internal \ncontrols  for  better  justice  service  delivery,  all  of  which  are  key \noutcomes  and  outputs  of  the  Government\u2019s  national  priorities  that \n \nare incorporated in the Development Policy Support Program. \n\nADB  has  provided  longstanding  support  to  the  Philippine  judiciary \nand  recently  expanded  the  scope  of  such  support  to  other  justice \nsector  agencies  in  recognition  that  the  impact  of  governance \nreforms  in  the  judiciary  would  be  undermined  without  reforms  in \nother  justice  sector  agencies.  The  Philippine  country  strategy  and \nprogram  identifies  governance  and  support  for  judicial  reforms  as \nkey  pillars  of  ADB\u2019s  development  assistance.  The  proposed \nGJSRP  reflects  the  Government\u2019s  priority  of  promoting  good \ngovernance  in  the  justice  sector  and  builds  upon  related  ADB \nsupport to this sector.  \n\nthe \n\nintegrity  of \n\nthe  governance  and  efficiency  of \n\nThe proposed GJSRP will support the Government in its efforts to \nenhance the rule of law in the Philippines. GJSRP implementation \nwill  result  in  improved  governance  and  efficiency  of  justice  sector \nagencies  while  expanding  access  to  justice  by  (i)  strengthening \njudicial  fiscal  autonomy  and  justice  sector  accountability,  and \nimproving public access to the resources of justice sector agencies; \n(ii)  enhancing \njustice  sector  personnel;  (iii) \njustice  sector \nsupporting \nagencies;  (iv)  expanding  access  to  justice  by  the  poor  and \nvulnerable groups, with specific focus on addressing gender-based \ndiscriminatory  practices  and  gender  gaps;  and  (v)  expanding  the \ndelivery of justice through alternative dispute resolution. GJSRP is \nexpected  to  result  in  a  more  efficient  processing  of  cases  and \nenhanced  and  prompt  access  to  court  decisions.  With  improved \naccess by the poor and vulnerable groups to the justice system, the \nProgram  also  expects  to  see  a  decline  in  the  time  that  legal  aid \nclients spend in pretrial detention. There will also be increased use \nof  alternative  dispute  resolutions,  such  as  arbitration  and  court-\nannexed  mediation,  more  certainty  in  the  court  decisions,  and  an \nincreased recognition of international arbitration awards, which has \nbeen a difficult issue for foreign investors.  \n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nProgram Period \n\n \nCounterpart Funds \n\n \nExecuting Agencies \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\niv\n\nA  proposed  loan  of  $300  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources will be provided under the London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility for subprogram 1. The loan will have \na 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate \nto  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement \n\nThe  program  cluster  period  is  from  January  2006  until  August \n2010,  with  a  loan  of  $300  million  to  be  disbursed  in  two  tranches \nunder subprogram 1, when the Government has met the conditions \nfor  release  of  the  first  and  second  tranche.  Subprogram  2  will  be \nsubmitted  for  Board  consideration  approximately  30  months  after \nthe  effectiveness  of  subprogram  1  (i.e.,  by  2011),  subject  to \nadequate  progress  of  reforms  and  the  Government\u2019s  readiness  to \ncontinue with its reform agenda. \n\nCounterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the subprogram \n1  loan  will  be  used  for  budget  support  in  meeting  government \nexpenditures  for  social  and  infrastructure  programs,  and  the \nassociated fiscal costs of the governance in justice sector reforms.  \n\nTwo  executing  agencies  are  proposed  for  the  GJSRP:  the \nSupreme  Court  and  the  Department  of  Finance  (DOF).  The \nSupreme Court will be the executing agency for program activities \nfocused  on  reforms  in  the  judiciary,  while  the  DOF  will  be  the \nexecuting  agency  for  all  other  program  activities  within  the \nexecutive  branch  of  government.  Given  the  independence  of  the \njudiciary  from  the  executive  branch  of  government  under  the \nPhilippine  Constitution,  it  is  deemed  necessary  to  establish  two \nexecutive  agencies  to  account  for  the  differing  responsibilities  of \nattaining outcomes in both branches of government.  \n\nImplementing  agencies  will  include  the  Department  of  Justice \n(DOJ),  the  Department  of  the  Interior  and  Local  Government \n(DILG),  the  Department  of  Budget  and  Management  (DBM)  and \nthe  Office  of  Solicitor  General  (OSG).  The  Supreme  Court  and \nDOF  will  jointly  set  up  a  program  coordination  committee \ncomprising  representatives  from  each  of  the  executing  agencies, \nand  DOJ,  DILG,  DBM,  and  OSG.  The  program  coordination \ncommittee  will  be  responsible  for  implementation  of  the  reform \nprogram and will monitor progress and support the implementation \nof the cluster and provide guidance to the implementing agencies. \n \n\nProcurement and                 The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange \ncosts  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and \nDisbursement \nprocured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible items and \nimports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  The \nGovernment  will  certify  its  compliance  with  this  formula  with  each \nimport  documentation  under \nwithdrawal \n\nrequest.  Otherwise, \n\n \n\n\fv \n\n \n\nexisting procedures will be required. ADB reserves the right to audit \nthe  use  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  verify  the  accuracy  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s certification. The loan proceeds will be disbursed to \nthe  Borrower \nthe  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nSimplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans. \n\nin  accordance  with \n\n \nProgram Benefits                 The program\u2019s principal benefits are improved incentives increased \nincreased resources, and greater accountability leading to a higher \nand Beneficiaries \nquality of public services in the justice sector. Primary beneficiaries \nwill  be  justice  sector  agencies  and  staff,  who  will  benefit  from  a \nbetter-resourced  justice  sector.  While  most  benefits  are  expected \nto  emerge  over  the  long  term,  in  the  short  to  medium  term, \ncompetitive  salaries  and  higher  budgets  are  expected  to  reduce \nvacancies among judges and prosecutors, improve information and \ncase  management  systems,  and  provide \nfor  a \njustice  system. \nprogressive \nConsequently,  the  Program  will  also  benefit  users  of  the  justice \nsystem,  who  will  enjoy  more  efficient  and  effective  delivery  of \njustice.  Faster  court  decisions,  and  wider  dissemination  of \ninformation about justice sector functions and services will improve \nthe  public\u2019s  understanding  and  confidence  in  the  formal  court \nsystem, mediation, arbitration, and informal mechanisms of dispute \nsettlement. The Program also has a special focus on the poor and \ndisadvantaged  groups,  and  a  commitment  to  promote  capacity-\nbuilding initiatives aimed at addressing gender-based violence. \n\nin  delays \n\nthe  basis \n\nreduction \n\nthe \n\nin \n\n \nRisks, Assumptions \nand Mitigation Measures  \n\nWhile some of the risks of the GJSRP are political and outside of \nthe  scope  of  the  Program  to  directly  mitigate,  the  Program  and \nadvisory  TA  will  contribute  toward  mitigating  other  risks  through \ngreater \ntransparency  and  accountability  mechanisms,  by \nstrengthening  the  capacity  of  justice  sector  agency  officials  and \nstaff,  and  enabling  active  monitoring  by  civil  society  groups.  The \npotential risks and mitigation measures  include:   \n(i)      The Philippine economy in 2008 has been affected by three \nadverse developments in the external environment: (a) the \nknock-on  effects  from  the  financial  crisis  in  the  United \nStates,  (b)  United  States  and  global  economic  slowdown, \nand  (c)  commodity  and  fuel  price  increases.  In  recognition \nof  the  impact  of  these  exogenous  shocks  to  the  fiscal \nposition,  the  Government  has  adjusted  its  fiscal  balance \ntarget from 2008 to 2010. The easing of the fiscal target will \nprovide more headroom for expenditures, including needed \nincreases \njustice  sector \nagencies.  The  Government  has  remained  steadfast  in  its \ndevelopment  program\u2014increased  infrastructure  spending, \nsupport  for  critical  sectors  (e.g.,  mining,  business  process \noutsourcing,  and  tourism,  among  others)\u2014in  support  of \neconomic  growth,  while  sustaining  revenue  mobilization \nefforts. Nevertheless, it is expected that there will be a net \nthe \neconomic  slowdown \n\nthat  will  adversely  affect \n\nin  budgetary \n\nresources \n\nfor \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nvi\n\nGovernment\u2019s  ability  to  increase  fiscal  resources  allocated \nto the justice sector. \n\nthe \n\nin  administration  hamper \n\n(ii)  While  the  Constitution  protects  the  fiscal  autonomy  and \nindependence  of  the  judiciary,  budgetary  constraints  and \njudiciary\u2019s \nweaknesses \nexercise  of  fiscal  autonomy  and  independence  in  practice. \nRectifying  this  requires  continued  commitment  to  good \ngovernance  from  the  judiciary  and  other  branches  of \ngovernment,  including  LGUs.  It  will  also  depend  on  the \nspeed and commitment of the judiciary and its personnel to \nestablish effective administrative and financial mechanisms \nthat  are  transparent,  participatory,  and  provide  a  strong \nsense  of  accountability  for  the  use  of  public  resources. \nUnder  the  attached  TA,  ADB  will  continue  to  support  the \njudiciary  in  its  fiscal  and  administrative  reforms,  including \nsupport for change management to help mitigate this risk. \n\n(iii)  Weak absorptive capacity of the justice sector agencies due \nto inadequate resources (financial and human) will continue \nto  undermine  the  impact  of  reforms.  However,  close \nperformance  monitoring  and  targeted  technical  assistance \nto  the  implementing  agencies  will  help  reduce  the  adverse \neffects  of \nto  capacity \nimplementation  delays  due \nconstraints.  \n\n(v) \n\nto  rationalize \n\nrecruiting  and \n\n(iv)      The  slow  pace  of  civil  service  reform  limits  the  ability  of \ntheir  staff  and \njustice  sector  agencies \ntransform  those  savings  into  more  attractive  remuneration \nfor \nretaining  qualified  personnel,  and \nundermines  ongoing  initiatives  to  improve  capacity.  To \naddress this risk in the judiciary, the TA includes support for \nthe  judiciary  to  prepare  a  staff  rationalization  plan  for \nsubmission to DBM and the Civil Service Commission.  \nThere  is  a  risk  that  current  reforms  may  be  reversed  by \nfuture governments. This risk may be mitigated by ongoing \npolicy  dialogue  with  the  Government  as  well  as  other \nstakeholders including the judiciary, legislative branch, civil \nsociety, business associations, academia, and development \npartners. The Program targets reforms that are in the public \nfuture \ninterest  so \nthe \ngovernments  may  be \nthe \naccompanying TA for the establishment of a Justice Sector \nCoordination  Council  (JSCC)  will  facilitate  policy  dialogue \nand  help  build  greater  public  awareness  and  a  stronger \nconstituency for the ongoing reform agenda. \n\nreversal  of \nless \n\nlikely.  Support  under \n\nreforms  by \n\nthat \n\nto  assist \n\nThe  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  an  advisory  TA \nin  preparing  and \ngrant \nimplementing \nreforms  under \nsubprogram 2.  \n\njustice  sector  agencies \nthe  governance  and  policy \n\nThe total amount of the TA is $2.2 million, of which $1.5 million will \nbe sourced from the ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund and \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\n\fvii \n\n \n\n$500,000  will  be  provided  from  the  Gender  and  Development \nCooperation Fund on a grant basis and administered by ADB. The \nGovernment  will  provide \nthe  remaining  $200,000  equivalent \nthrough in-kind contributions.  \n \nThe  executing  agencies  will  be  the  Supreme  Court  and  DOF,  and \nimplementing agencies will include DOJ, DBM, and DILG. The TA \nwill support the judiciary, and justice sector and oversight agencies \nto  implement  and  monitor  key  governance  reforms,  including \nreforms  relating  to  financial  management,  development  of  a \nmedium-term  expenditure  program  for  the  justice  sector,  change \nmanagement and advocacy, strengthening programs for access to \njustice  by  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups,  and  enabling  greater \nand more effective use of alternative dispute resolution.

Real \ngross domestic product (GDP) grew by 7.2% in 2007, the highest growth rate in three decades. \nThe  economic  expansion  has  been  notable  in  recent  years,  with  the  last  recorded  contraction \noccurring  during  the  Asian  financial  crisis  in  1998.  The  expansion  reflects  improving \nmacroeconomic  fundamentals;  economic  management  associated  with  low  inflation;  and  a \ncredible independent central bank that has been increasingly supported by fiscal consolidation, \ndeclining  public  debt,  and  4  consecutive  years  of  a  current  account  surplus  based  on  record \nhigh remittances from Filipinos working abroad.  \n \n\nTable 1: Aggregate Economic Performance \n \n\nIndicator \n\nGross national product, growth rate (%) \n\nGross domestic product (GDP), growth rate (%) \n\nInvestment/nominal GDP (%) \n\nInflation rate (%) \n\n91-day T-bill rate (%) \n\nFiscal balance (% of GDP) \n\nExports of goods, growth rate (%) \n\nImports of goods, growth rate (%) \n\nCurrent account balance (% of GDP) \n\nPoverty incidence (% of families) \n\nUnemployment rate (%)  \n\nDubai oil prices, average (US$/bbl) \n\n2006 \n\n6.1 \n\n5.4 \n\n14.5 \n\n6.3 \n\n5.4 \n\n(1.1) \n\n14.9 \n\n9.2 \n\n4.5 \n\n26.9 \n\n7.9 \n\n61.5 \n\n2007 \n\n8.0 \n\n7.2 \n\n15.3 \n\n2.8 \n\n3.4 \n\n(0.2) \n\n6.1 \n\n6.8 \n\n4.4 \n\n \n\n7.3 \n\n68.3 \n\nP/$ exchange Rate \n(=)negative; GDP = gross domestic product.  \nSource: National Statistical Coordination Board, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, Department of Finance \n\n46.1 \n\n51.3 \n\n \n \n3. \nInvestment  Showed  Signs  of  Recovery  in  2007.  After  rapidly  expanding  in  the  first \nhalf  of  the  1990s,  investment  growth  in  the  Philippines  slumped  following  the  Asian  financial \ncrisis  and  has  been  slow  to  recover,  which  has  been  a  common  characteristic  of  all  the  other \ncrisis-hit countries in the region since 1998. The Philippines\u2019 gross investment, both public and \n\n                                                 \n1 Contributors: the governments of Canada, Denmark, Ireland, and Norway. \n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nprivate, was the equivalent of 23% of its GDP before the crisis, but this had declined to 14.5% in \n2006. Lost investments have translated into lost growth, and in turn to the slow creation of jobs \nand missed opportunities for poverty reduction. The decline in investment covered both private \nand public investments. However, investment spending increased in 2007 for the first time in 10 \nyears,  growing  by  11.8%  over  the  previous  year,  which  was  well  above  the  average  annual \ngrowth  rate  of  0.8%  from  1997  to  2006.  Overall,  the  gross  investment  to  GDP  ratio  improved \nfrom 14.5% in 2006 to 15.3% in 2007. ADB staff estimates suggest that the Philippines is under-\ninvesting in physical capital by as much as five percentage points of GDP when compared with \nits long run equilibrium rate.  \n \n4. \nEconomic Challenges in 2008. The Philippines economy in 2008 has been affected by \nthree  adverse  developments  in  the  external  environment:  (i)  commodity  and  fuel  price \nincreases,  (ii)  the  financial  sector  knock-on  effects  from  the  United  States  (US),  and  (iii)  the \nunfolding US and global economic slowdown. In recent months, economic data out of the US, \nEurope, and Japan confirms that the crisis has moved from the financial sector and into the real \neconomy. The external shocks from the global financial crisis and economic slowdown have yet \nto fully impact economic conditions in the Philippines.   \n \n5. \nIn the first half of 2008, the surge in international food and energy prices has contributed \nto  higher  domestic  inflation.  Inflation  in  the  Philippines  hit  a  17-year  high  of  12.5%  in  August \n2008  on  a  year-on-year  basis,  with  rice  prices  increasing  by  45%.  Although  global commodity \nprices have started to ease, including rising prospects for a benign oil price environment, current \nlevels remain historically high. Food supply and price levels, particularly those of rice, continue \nto  be  a  priority  concern  for  the  Philippines  given  its  immediate  impact  on  the  poor.  The \neconomic  growth  rate  of  4.6%  in  the  first  half  of  2008  (from  7.6%  in  the  first  half  of  2007) \nsuggests  that  these  adverse  effects  are  beginning  to  affect  the  real  economy.  In  addition,  the \nextent  of  the  global  financial  crisis  and  its  impact  on  the  real  sector  remains  to  be  seen.  The \nlatest Asian Development Outlook estimates GDP growth in the Philippines at 4.5% in 2008 and \n4.7% in 2009.2 \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Strategies and the Government\u2019s Justice Sector Reform Program \n\n6. \nThe  Medium-Term  Philippine  Development  Plan  (MTPDP)  2004\u20132010  sets  out  the \ncountry\u2019s development priorities, policy agenda, and programs. The plan includes an extensive \ndiscussion on the rule of law and the needed governance reforms in justice sector institutions. \nThe MTPDP envisions a judiciary that is independent, effective, and efficient. It also envisions \ncollaborative governance reforms among the five pillars of the criminal justice system, namely, \nthe courts, prosecution, law enforcement, rehabilitation and correction, and the community; with \nthe community pillar providing overall monitoring. Supporting key reforms of the MTPDP is the \nPhilippines  Development  Forum,  the  primary  mechanism  of  the  Government  for  facilitating \nsubstantive policy dialogue among stakeholders. The Philippines Development Forum created a \nworking group on good governance and anti-corruption,3 where consensus on and commitments \nto the rule of law continue to be discussed and monitored. \n \n7. \nJustice  Sector  Reform  Strategies.  There  have  been  four  phases  of  justice  sector \nreform  since  1986  (A  detailed  description  of  justice  reforms  appears  in  Appendix  4:  Sector \nAnalysis).  The  first  phase  of  reform  measures  followed  the  1986  EDSA  revolution,  which \ncreated  a  sound  constitutional  basis  for  an  effective  justice  system,  helped  restore  the \nindependence of the judiciary, and initiated a continuing justice reform effort. A second phase of \nreform during the 1990s concentrated on strengthening the human and institutional capabilities \n\n                                                 \n2 ADB. 2008. Asian Development Outlook Update. Manila. \n3 This working group is currently chaired by the Philippines\u2019 Office of the Ombudsman and co-chaired by ADB. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nthat were required to respond to the increased workload and growing number of reforms in the \njudiciary  and  other  justice  sector  agencies.  A  third  phase  began  with  the  Supreme  Court\u2019s \nimplementation of its Action Program for Judicial Reform (APJR), a multi-year plan (2000\u20132006) \nthat  identified,  prioritized,  and  implemented  judicial  reforms.  The  APJR  was  regarded  as  a \nconcrete step in establishing a strong foundation for the long-term development of the judiciary. \nIt aimed at strengthening the judiciary\u2019s accountability, fiscal autonomy, and independence from \nexternal  interference;  and  supported  the  delivery  of  fair  and  speedy  justice.  The  APJR  also \nreceived  strong  support  from  the  executive  branch.  By  the  end  of  the  APJR,  the  Supreme \nCourt\u2019s  credibility  had  increased.  Respondents  to  a  survey  of  businesses  who  considered  the \nSupreme  Court  sincere  in  fighting  corruption  increased  from  a  net  of  40%  in  2006  to  a  net  of \n46%  in  2007.4  Equally  important  is  APJR\u2019s  production  of  a  series  of  diagnostic  studies  that \nprovided  the  basis  for  policy  reforms  in  the  Department  of  Justice  (DOJ),  the  Office  of  the \nOmbudsman, the Public Attorney\u2019s Office, and the Philippine corrections system. The diagnostic \nstudies provided the opportunity for these nonjudicial justice sector agencies to build their own \nreform  road  maps.  As  a  result,  DOJ  created  a  Management  Systems  Office  to  coordinate  its \nreform  program,  the  Office  of  the  Ombudsman  adopted  a  Medium-Term  Anticorruption \nProgram, and the Philippine National Police (PNP) launched its own reform program.   \n \n8. \nA fourth phase of reforms was initiated upon the current chief justice\u2019s assumption of the \noffice  in  2006.  The  chief  justice  announced  three  broad  priority  areas  for  the  judiciary:  (i) \nseeking  the  speedy  and  efficient  resolution  of  court  cases,  (ii)  improving  the  court\u2019s  integrity, \nand (iii) increasing access to justice. The chief justice also continues to focus on APJR reforms \nthat  are  expected  to  achieve  results  in  these  areas,  by  piloting  a  decentralized  regional  court \nadministration structure; designating 22 small claims courts using judicial dispute resolution; and \ndeploying  mobile  court  units  under  the  Justice  on  Wheels  Program.  The  chief  justice  has  not \nabandoned  interest  in  coordinating  justice  reforms.  Since  his  appointment,  he  has  hosted  two \nmultisectoral  summits,  both  of  which  were  lauded  for  demonstrating  justice  sector  leadership. \nImproved coordination is expected to continue, particularly after the signing of a memorandum \nof  agreement  among  the  executive,  legislative,  and  the  judicative  branches  to  establish  the \nJudiciary,  Executive,  and  Legislative  Advisory  and  Consultative  Council  on  13  May  2008.  The \ncouncil  aims  to  develop  a  cooperative  approach  to  resolving  issues  relating  primarily  to  the \nbudget  of  the  judiciary  in  a  manner  that  respects  judicial  independence.  Other  justice  sector \nagencies\u2014notably,  DOJ  and  PNP\u2014continue  to  implement  components  of  their  own  reform \nprograms, focusing on the efficient and effective delivery of services and agency integrity. \n \nC. \n\nThe Government and Its ADB Partnership \n\nCountry  Strategy  and  Program.  Justice  sector  and  rule  of  law  are  themes  of  the \n9. \ninvestment  climate  component  of  the  country  strategy  and  program  for  2005\u20132007,5  which \nemphasizes  that  ADB  will  help  the  Government  to  improve  the  investment  climate  through  a \ncombination  of  technical  and  program  support  for  policy,  institutional,  and  regulatory  reform  in \nkey  sectors.  The  ADB\u2019s  focus  on  governance,  macroeconomic  and  public  expenditure \nmanagement,  and  anticorruption  in  the  Philippines  is  anchored  in  the  Development  Policy \nSupport Program, which both complements and reinforces the GJSRP and ADB\u2019s other sector \nloan  programs  and  projects  that  are  aligned  with  government  strategies.  The  Development \nPolicy  Support  Program  sets  out  broad  policy  outcomes  for  improving  public  expenditure \nmanagement,  but  leaves  its  introduction  to  sector  programs  such  as  the  Local  Government \nFinance  and  Budget  Reform  Program  and  the  proposed  GJSRP.  The  proposed  GJSRP  will \nimproved  expenditure \nthe \nsupport \n\nincreased  budget  resources \n\njustice  sector  and \n\nto \n\n                                                 \n4 Social Weather Station Survey of Enterprises on Corruption 2006-2007, July 2007. \n5  These  themes  continue  to  be  relevant  in  the  country  operations  business  plan  for  the  Philippines  (ADB.  2008. \n\nCountry Operations Business Plan (2008-2010).

ADB\u2019s engagement with the Government on governance reforms, and \nthe  justice  sector  in  particular,  began  in  the  late  1980s  as  the  Philippines  embarked  on  its \ndemocratization  effort  and  constitutional  reforms.  ADB  assistance  included  support  for \nregulatory  oversight  bodies,  macroeconomic  and  fiscal  stability,  public  financial  management \nreform,  local  government  fiscal  and  budget  reform,  and  strengthening  the  judiciary and  justice \nsector.  ADB\u2019s  partnership  in  the  justice  sector  started  with  the  judiciary  led  by  the  Supreme \nCourt,  which  adopted  the  APJR  in  2001  following  a  series  of  diagnostic  studies  that  identified \nmajor  challenges  to  the  judiciary\u2019s  integrity,  competence,  and  efficiency.  Policy  dialogue  and \npreparations for the GJSRP formally commenced in 2006.  \n \n11. \nIn  2001,  ADB  provided  a  technical  assistance  grant  (TA  3693-PHI)  to  the  judiciary  to \nassist  in  developing  frameworks  and  systems  to  strengthen  the  judiciary\u2019s  independence  and \naccountability; improve the judicial appointments system; and promote judicial training. Among \nthe  key  outcomes  of  this  engagement  have  been  the  design  of  a  decentralized  court \nadministration system, which is currently being piloted by the Supreme Court in Region 7;6 and \nthe creation of a financial management and administration office, and research positions in the \nJudicial  and  Bar  Council  (JBC),  all  of  which  were  recommended  by  the  TA  and  intended  to \nimprove  JBC  capability  to  independently  select  qualified  judicial  candidates.  In  2006,  ADB \napproved TA 4832-PHI to support the Supreme Court\u2019s implementation of the recommendations \nfrom ADB TA 3693-PHI regarding decentralization of administrative and financial management \nfunctions  in  the  judiciary.  The  TA  is  currently  supporting  the  pilot  testing  of  a  regional  court \nadministration office in Region 7 that was launched by the current chief justice in May 2008, and \nengaged  in  full  operations  for  all  courts  in  the  region  beginning  in  July  2008.  The  TA  also \nsupported  reforms  in  nonjudicial  justice  sector  agencies  that  had  been  identified  by  Supreme \nCourt diagnostic studies as agencies whose performance had an impact on judicial efficiency. A \nsustainable capacity-building program for members of the National Prosecution Service (NPS) \nof  the  DOJ  has  been  designed  and  implemented.  Inputs  for  a  design  of  a  prosecution  case \nmanagement system were also developed and are currently used in the DOJ\u2019s design of such a \nsystem.7    \n \n12. \nRecognizing  the  Philippines\u2019  improved  macroeconomic  performance  since  2005,  ADB \nhas moved  to a high-case lending scenario. Aligned with government  priorities and directions, \nthe  2008  program  reflects  a  mix  of  policy-based  and  project  loans  that  broaden  support  from \nfiscal  consolidation  to  other  key  development  constraints  relating  to  the  investment  climate, \ngovernance and social sectors; and provides direct support for accelerated achievements of the \nMillennium Development Goals. \n \nThe  proposed  GJSRP  is  one  of  three  pillars  of  policy-based  operations  for  institutional \n13. \nstrengthening  that  anchors  ADB\u2019s  policy  operations  in  the  Philippines.  The  other  two  are \nfocused  on  fiscal  and  public  expenditure  management:  the  Development  Policy  Support \nProgram and the Local Government Finance and Budget Reform Program.8 Figure 1 illustrates  \n\n                                                 \n6  Region  7,  the  Central  Visayas  region  of  the  Philippines,  comprise  the  provinces  of  Bohol,  Cebu,  Negros  Oriental \n\nand Siquijor. \n\n7  ADB.  2001.

The  proposed  GJSRP  will  support  the  broad \npriorities  of  the  Government\u2019s  justice  sector  reform  measures,  including  institutional  capacity \nbuilding,  as  highlighted  in  the  development  policy  letter  addressed  to  the  President  of  ADB \n(Appendix  2).  These  broad  areas  include  (i)  strengthening  judicial  fiscal  autonomy,  justice \nsector  accountability,  and  improved  access  to  resources  of  justice  sector  agencies;  (ii) \nenhancing the integrity of justice sector personnel; (iii) supporting the governance and efficiency \nof justice sector agencies; (iv) expanding access to justice by the poor and vulnerable groups, \nwith  a  specific  focus  on  addressing  gender-based  discriminatory  practices  and  gender  gaps; \nand  (v)  expanding  the  delivery  of  justice  through  alternative  dispute  resolution.

The GJSRP has the following two phases:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nSubprogram  1  of  the  program  cluster  focuses  on  increasing  resources  to  the \njustice  sector  and  supporting  the  efficient  delivery  of  justice  services.  It  is \ndesigned as a two-tranche operation with equal amounts of $150 million in 2008 \nand  2009.  The  tranche  structure  for  subprogram  1  serves  as  a  commitment \ndevice  and  platform  for  the  judicial  and  the  executive  branches  to  reach  a \nconsensus on key issues regarding (i) a coordinated approach to reforms in the \njustice sector spanning all relevant agencies, while respecting their constitutional \nmandates and autonomy; and (ii) increased funding for the judiciary. \n\nSubprogram  2  will  focus  on  institutional  capacity  building  to  deliver  justice \nservices to the community, and implementing measures to address key priorities \nof  the  justice  sector,  including  decentralizing  the  court\u2019s  financial  management \nand  administrative  functions  to  regional  court  administration  offices,  improving \nthe integrity of the court and other justice sector agencies, and improving access \nto justice.  \n\n \n15. \nSubprogram  2  will  address  the  key  risks  identified  in  subprogram  1\u2014particularly  in \nrelation to sustaining support for increasing the share of the justice sector in the Government\u2019s \nbudget\u2014and  make  progress  in  other  areas  that  might  emerge  from  policy  dialogue  and \nengagement with the Government from 2009 to 2011. The expected time frame for processing \nsubprogram  2  is  approximately  30  months  after  subprogram  1  becomes  effective  (i.e.,  2011). \nSubprogram  2  contains  eight  policy  triggers  to  provide  the  flexibility  needed  to  respond  to \nunanticipated changes in the external environment by framing an appropriate policy response. \nThis  approach  will  ensure  the  program  cluster  is  synchronized  with  the  Government\u2019s  policy \nagenda and the crafting of the new medium-term plan in 2011.  \n \n16. \nGovernment  and  Development  Partner  Coordination.  Philippine  justice  sector \nreforms  have  been  supported  by  development  partners  other  than  ADB.  The  United  Nations \nDevelopment  Programme  (UNDP)  played  a  key  role  in  the  background  technical  work  and \nbaselines of the APJR. The World Bank\u2019s Judicial Reform Support Program supported judiciary-\nfocused reforms, including information technology and infrastructure needs, as well as integrity-\nfocused  initiatives.  The  World  Bank,  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development \n(USAID),  and  Canadian  International  Development  Agency  (CIDA)  have  all  supported  the \ndevelopment  of  caseflow  management  and/or  case  management  information  systems  in  the \njudiciary.  CIDA  and  The  Asia  Foundation,  with  funding  from  USAID,  have  also  focused  on \nalternative dispute resolution (court-annexed mediation), access to justice, and prison reforms. \nThe European Commission focused on access to justice reforms, while the Australian Agency \nfor  International  Development  (AusAID)  provided  human  resource  training  support.  The \nJapanese  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA)  provided  training  for  various  justice  sector \nagencies and assisted in the operation of an automated fingerprint identification system at the \nPNP.  (Appendix  3:  Development  Partners\u2019  Coordination  Matrix  gives  a  detailed  description  of \ndevelopment partners\u2019 support to the Philippine justice sector).   \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR \n\nA. \n\nGovernance in the Philippines \n\n17. \nIn the Philippines, the key binding constraints to ensuring sustained growth and poverty \nreduction were identified in an ADB study9\u2014and earlier in the country strategy and program\u2014as \nrelating  to  macroeconomic  stability,  high  transaction  costs  of  doing  business,  inadequate \ninfrastructure,  and  weak  investor  confidence.  These  constraints  have  been  partly  shaped  by \ngovernance and corruption concerns. The judiciary and justice sector agencies are engaged in \nthe  delivery  of  justice.  As  such,  they  perform  a  critical  governance  and  oversight  function  by \nidentifying and reviewing public and private sector actions that violate the law. Figure 2 outlines \nthe  entry  points  for  governance  reform  supported  by  ADB.  In  the  dynamics  of  the  reform \nprocess,  the  supply  and  demand  for  good  governance  are  considered  important  features  in \nbuilding  strong  institutions  that  provide  quality  public  service  delivery.  To  illustrate,  ADB\u2019s \noperation in the Philippines include: a focus on supply side factors by strengthening human and \nfinancial  resources  and  public  financial  management  needed  to  deliver  public  services;  and \ndemand-led \u201cvoice\u201d and empowerment elements to strengthen accountability arrangements.  A \nvibrant  civil  society  coupled  with  measures  in  support  of  transparency  and  accountability \nprovides  an  incentive  to  change  behavior  and  improve  public  service  performance  of \ngovernment institutions. Civil society and NGO stakeholders play an important role in sustaining \npolicy  dialogue  on  justice  sector  reforms.  These  groups  hold  strong  interests  that  protect  the \nreforms  from  state  capture.  These  groups\u2019  advocacy  during  policy  dialogue  makes  the  justice \nsector and state actions more responsive to the needs of its users. \n \n18. \nGood  Governance  Performance.  The  Philippines  suffers  from  the  perception  of  poor \ngovernance  as  captured  in  investment  climate  and  governance  surveys,  and  international \ncomparisons.  Progress  is  being  made  in  macroeconomic  management  and  fiscal  stability  but \nother  indicators,  including  those  of  corruption,  have  deteriorated.  In  its  report,  Governance \nMatters  1996\u20132007:  Worldwide  Governance  Indicators,  the  World  Bank  has  noted  three \nfeatures of governance and corruption in the Philippines based upon an assessment of various \npublished  indicators.10  First,  the  Philippines  has  experienced  deterioration  in  most  governance \nand corruption indicators since 1998; bottoming out in 2004, and improving since 2005, with the \nexception of indicators for corruption and political stability, which continue to decline (Table 2). \nSecond,  while  the  Philippines  scores  well  on  indicators  of  the  quality  of  legislative  and \nregulatory governance frameworks, it scores less well on the implementation of such laws and \npublic  service  delivery.  Finally,  the  Philippines  fares  well  in  regional  comparisons  for  most \nindicators, except for corruption and political stability indicators (Table 3). \n \n19. \nImpact  of  Governance  on  Economic  Growth.  Weak  institutions  contributed  to  the \nPhilippines\u2019 lower-than-average economic growth performance. A study on Philippine economic \ngrowth  over  the  last  35  years  suggested  that  while  Philippines  growth  performance  has  been \naverage  compared  to  all  other  developing  economies,  it  has  performed  below  average  in  the \nSoutheast  Asia  region,  which  was  attributed  to  weak  institutions.11  The  2003  ADB  and  World \nBank Investment Climate Survey identified corruption as the second most severe constraint to \ninvestment, behind macroeconomic stability.12 The analysis of cross-country data in this survey \nshowed  that  if  a  country  raises  its  governance  ratings  to  international  averages  for  political \nstability,  corruption,  and  the  rule  of  law,  this  would  be  a  sufficient  step  to  change  investor \n\n                                                 \n9 ADB. 2007.

The \nexecutive  branch  agencies  implement  the  laws,  investigate  violations,  prosecute  crimes,  and \nenforce  penalties;  and  the  judiciary  interprets  the  law,  hears  cases,  resolves  disputes,  and \nreviews  government  actions.  The  executive  and  judicial  branches  are  co-equal  and  separate, \nand together with the legislative branch, they each exercise powers that check and balance the \npowers of the other two. Under the executive branch and judiciary, the agencies constituting the \njustice system include the following: law enforcers and investigators, public defenders, solicitors, \nprosecutors,  various  levels  of  courts,  and  penal  institutions.  Although  the  core  of  the  justice \nsystem is the judiciary\u2014as the branch of government ultimately responsible for interpreting the \nlaw\u2014a  well-functioning  justice  system  also  relies  on  the  capacities,  performance,  and \ncoordination  of  the  justice  sector  institutions  in  the  executive  branch  (Appendix  4,  Sector \nAnalysis). \n \n\nTable 3: Regional Comparison of Governance Indicators in 2007 \n\nCountry \n \n\nVoice and \nAccountability \n43.3 \n42.8 \n31.3 \n29.8 \n6.7 \n24.0 \n6.3 \n\n Philippines \n Indonesia  \n Malaysia  \nThailand  \nViet Nam  \nCambodia \nLao PDR \nLao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \nSource: World Bank 2008.

A common perception in the Philippines is that \nthe quality of the rule of law leaves much to be desired. The justice system is often cited as a \ncontributing  factor  to  the  low  comparative  rankings  of  the  Philippines  on  a  number  of  widely-\nknown indices of economic competitiveness. In addition, the American Bar Association has also \nexpressed concerns over inefficiency in the justice system. While reforms have helped improve \nthe credibility of justice sector institutions\u2014particularly the Supreme Court, and more recently, \nPNP\u2014cross-cutting  issues  persist.  The  sector\u2019s  human  and  financial  resources,  and  physical \ninfrastructure  remain  grossly  inadequate  or  poorly  allocated  and  managed;  caseloads  are \nunrealistically high; court dockets remain congested and delays are perceived to be excessive; \nand the jail population is growing primarily as a result of prisoners awaiting trial. Conviction rates \nremain  very  low;  public  confidence  in  the  integrity  of  justice  system  operators  is  also  low;  the \nprivate sector is frustrated by uncertainties about the law, its interpretation, and application; and \naccess  to  justice  is  impeded  by  delays,  costs,  uncertainties,  and  in  some  cases  the  physical \nremoteness of courts.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nFigure 3: The Judiciary Forms the Core of the Philippine Justice System Network \n \n\nExecutive/President \n\nJudiciary/Supreme Court \n\nDOJ \n\nOffice of the President/ \nOther Exec.

Manila  \n \n \n22. \nThe Vicious Cycle of Poor Governance. Informed observers attribute the persistence \nof underperformance in the justice sector to several factors. The immediate cause is inadequate \nresources and support facilities, and low remuneration, which inhibit the hiring and retention of \nqualified staff while concurrently providing strong incentives for corruption. This situation breeds \na vicious cycle of (i) limited implementation capacities in justice sector agencies, including the \nlimited  capacity  to  manage  change  and  to  manage  for  results;  (ii)  inadequate  investment  in \nincreasing  capacities;  and  (iii)  weak  accountability,  both  in  the  sense  of  accountability  for \nmeeting  performance  targets  and  accountability  for  the  use  of  resources,  which  have  both \nimpeded  implementation  of  corrective  actions  in  a  timely  manner.  The  absence  of  sufficient \npolitical  consensus  that  the  benefits  of  improved  performance  in  the  justice  system  would \noutweigh the costs and risks has also contributed to this difficult environment.  \n \n23. \nApplication  of  Governance  Principles.  The  application  of  governance  principles  for \npublic sector service delivery provides the entry point to turn the vicious cycle described in para. \n22  into  a  virtuous  circle.  These  principles  include  (i)  incentives  to  provide  high-quality  service \ndelivery  through  competitive  salaries  and  sufficient  budgets  for  investments  in  training, \ninformation systems, and related facilities, (ii) enhanced accountability for performance against \nclear  benchmarks,  (iii)    improved  accountability  and  transparency  mechanisms  for  the  use  of \nresources  through  strong  public  financial  management  systems,  and  (iv)  effective  and  wide-\nranging civic participation to provide feedback and monitor the reform process.  \n \n\n10 \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\n \n \n24. \nThe fundamental change required in a complex environment such as the justice sector \ninvolves a slow and arduous process. It is important to focus on key areas and build sufficient \ncapacity and consensus necessary for reforms. At the same time, a comprehensive approach is \nneeded to address the issues, problems, constraints, and complex relationships of supervision \nand control across the network of justice sector institutions. The proposed GJSRP offers a road \nmap  of  critical  short-term  actions  and  medium-term  policy  reforms  that  will  require  concerted \neffort from all of the concerned stakeholders.  \n \nC. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nJudicial  Fiscal  Autonomy,  Justice  Sector  Accountability  and  Access  to \nResources \n\n25. \nJudicial  Independence  and  Fiscal  Autonomy.  An  independent  judiciary  is  a  key \nfeature  of  an  efficient  justice  sector.  Judicial  independence  refers  to  a  judiciary  deciding \nmatters impartially  \u201cwithout improper influences,  direct  or  indirect,  from any  source.\u201d14  One \nof the key features to ensure judicial independence is the provision of adequate resources \nto the judiciary and to allow the judiciary to manage the resources. In the Philippines, courts \nobtain financing from three major sources: the national government budget, contributions from \nlocal  government  units  (LGUs),  and  revenues  from  judicial  fees  and  charges.  However,  the \ncourts\u2019 principal source of financing is the national government budget. To protect the judiciary \nfrom being unduly influenced by the executive branch, which proposes the budget, or legislative \nbranch,  which  approves  the  budget,  the  Constitution  grants  the  judiciary  fiscal  autonomy \nthrough  the  automatic  and  regular  release  of  its  budget  once  it  has  been  approved  by \nCongress.15 In addition, the Constitution states that the judiciary\u2019s budget may not be reduced by \nCongress below the amount appropriated for the previous year.16   However the fiscal austerity \nmeasures  of \nto  2006,  weak  public  expenditure \nmanagement, and reliance on funding from LGUs have combined to undermine fiscal autonomy \nof the judiciary. \n\nthe  national  government \n\nfrom  2003 \n\n26. \nExcessive  Controls  and  Issues  on  Cash  Release.  The  national  government  budget \nallocation  process  starts  when  the  President,  through  the  Department  of  Budget  Management \n(DBM),  prepares  and  submits  to  Congress  an  annual  National  Expenditure  Program  on  the \nbasis  of  which  a  national  budget  is  appropriated.  In  the  course  of  preparing  the  National \nExpenditure  Program,  DBM  reviews  the  budget  proposals  of  all  government  agencies\u2014\nincluding  the  judiciary,  legislature,  the  executive  (Office  of  the  President),  and  fiscally-\nautonomous constitutional commissions\u2014on a line-item basis and decides which items may or \nmay not be included in the National Expenditure Program.17 The House of Representatives files \na  General  Appropriations  Bill  that  cannot  increase  the  appropriations  recommended  by  the \nexecutive.  Once  the  General  Appropriations  Bill  passes  into  law,  DBM  allots  the  judiciary\u2019s \nbudget  in  one  lump  sum.  Ideally,  DBM  would  disburse  the  judiciary\u2019s  budget  automatically, \nwithout conditions and on a regular basis, as required under the Constitution. However, as with \nexecutive  departments  under  the  supervision  and  control  of  the  President,  the  judiciary  has \nbeen subjected to cash availability timing issues and the fiscal position of the Government. The \nfailure to automatically and regularly release cash to the judiciary is one of the main factors that \n                                                 \n14  The  Beijing  Statement  of  Principles  of  the  Independence  of  the  Judiciary  in  the  LawAsia  Region.  This  is  an \ninternational document signed by 32 chief justices from throughout the Asia Pacific region including the Philippines. \n\n15  Article VIII, Section 3 of the Philippine Constitution; Supreme Court v. DBM, G.R. No. 158791, 10 February 2006. \n16 Article VIII, Section 3 of the Philippine Constitution.  \n17 It  will  be noted that both the president and the chief justice have the statutory  authority to realign resources  and   \n\naugment items within the budget of their government branch, but only if the budget items exist in the first place. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nrenders  the  judiciary  unable  to  reasonably  manage  its  own  resources  and  have  enough \nflexibility  to  adequately  manage  day-to-day  operations.  Failing  to  receive  the  resources  that  it \nneeds in a timely  manner, leaves the judiciary vulnerable to negotiating budget items with the \nexecutive  branch  on  a \nits \nindependence and integrity.  \n\ntransaction-by-transaction  basis, \n\nthereby  posing  risks \n\nto \n\n27. \nThe Government\u2019s fiscal management capabilities\u2014particularly in budget planning\u2014can \nplay  an  important  role  in  strengthening  fiscal  autonomy,  notwithstanding  government  budget \nconstraints. Ideally, a well planned operational cash program would allow DBM to  plan for the \ndisbursement  of  cash  to  fiscally-autonomous  priority  agencies,  such  as  the  judiciary,  without \nreferring  to  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal  position  or  reviewing  the  agencies\u2019  expenditures  as  a \nprecondition  to  releasing  cash  allocations.  However,  weak  fiscal  management  capabilities  and \nhuman  resource  constraints  in  the  Supreme  Court  have  resulted  in  the  preparation  of \noperational  cash  programs  that  do  not  reflect  the  actual  cash  requirements  of  the  Supreme \nCourt  each  quarter.  This  makes  it  difficult  for  DBM  to  program  a  realistic  schedule  of  cash \ndisbursements  for  the  judiciary  and  other  fiscally-autonomous  agencies,  especially  when  the \nGovernment\u2019s fiscal position is weak.  \n\n28. \nReal  Decline  in  Resources.  While  the  nominal  level  of  the  judiciary\u2019s  budget  can  be \nprotected by the Constitution, the increases have not always been sufficient to protect against \ninflation.  Figure  4  illustrates  that  while  there  have  been  annual  increases  in  the  judiciary\u2019s \nobligated  budget  in  recent  years,  its  value  in  real  terms  and  its  share  of  the  National \nExpenditure Program has decreased. While there was a slight recovery in the budget allocation \nin  real  terms  in  2007,  it  was  not  enough  to  meet  the  increasing  demands  of  the  courts\u2019 \nincreasing workload. In fact, the budget allocation for the judiciary in 2007 was able to buy 5% \nless  goods  and  services  when  compared  with  the  judiciary\u2019s  budget  in  2000.  With  national \ngovernment budgetary resources inadequate, the courts must turn to other sources to finance \ntheir operations.  \n\n  \n\n90 \n\n95 \n\nn\nd\ne\nx\n\n100 \n\n105 \n\nB\nu\nd\ng\ne\nt\n \nI\n\nFigure 4\n\n1.2  %\n\n      Suppressed Spending for the Judiciary\n\n          (budget adjusted for inflation and indexed to 100 in 2000)\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n29. \nJudiciary  Development  Fund.  In  1984,  Presidential  Decree  No.  1949  created  the \nJudiciary Development Fund (JDF) in recognition of the need to provide the judiciary with some \nform  of  fiscal  independence.  The  JDF  is  funded  by  court  fees  and  other  revenue  collected  by \n\nShare of Government budget \n\nSpending adjusted for inflation\n\nG\no\nv\ne\nr\nn\nm\ne\nn\n\n2000 \n\n2001 \n\nB\nu\nd\ng\ne\n\n0.8 \n\n0.2 \n\n0.4 \n\n0.6 \n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2002\n\n2005\n\n80 \n\n85 \n\n \no\nf\n \n\n1 \n\nt\n \n\nt\n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nthe courts.18 By statute, at least 80% of the JDF is allocated to finance cost-of-living allowances \nfor court personnel and not more than 20% may be used for office equipment and other court \nfacilities. Although the Supreme Court sets the rates for court fees and has sole responsibility \nfor collection, the JDF cannot serve as a major source of funds and revenue, as issues such as \naccess to justice and equal treatment under the law need to be given due consideration in the \nsetting and collection of fees. At best, the JDF merely augments the judiciary\u2019s resources. The \nbulk of the judiciary\u2019s resources must still come from the Government\u2019s budget.  \n \n30. \nLocal  Government  and  the  Judiciary.  Many  LGUs  contribute  resources  to  the  lower \ncourts located in their respective area of responsibility.19 These contributions are not recorded in \nthe financial accounting records of the judiciary. LGUs vary considerably in their policies about \ncontributions  to  local  courts  as  well  as  in  the  amounts  provided.  Some  LGUs  include \ncontributions  to  local  courts  in  their  annual  budgets,  but  most  do  not.  These  schemes  run  the \nrisk of undermining the integrity of the courts, a risk that is further heightened by the absence of \nmodern financial and expenditure management systems and capabilities within the judiciary. \n \n31.  Weakness  in  Judicial  Administration.  With  inadequate  budgetary  resources,  the \nquality  of  judicial  administration  suffers.  The  severe  lack  of  administrative  and  financial \nmanagement,  and  technical  infrastructure  hampers  the  efficiency  of  the  reporting  and \naccounting process. This has contributed to the perception that the judiciary is not forthcoming \nabout its use of their resources, including the JDF, even as past audits by the Commission on \nAudit  have  confirmed  the  proper  accounting  and  transparency  of  the  JDF.  International  best \npractices  and  principles  of  financial  management  may  be  useful  in  preventing  a  negative \nperception of the courts, as well as in ensuring the judiciary\u2019s accountability to the public for its \nperformance and use of resources.20 \n \n32. \nResource Constraints in Nonjudicial Agencies. Nonjudicial agencies suffer the same \nbudgetary constraints as the judiciary. In general, while annual budgetary allocations increase in \nnominal  terms,  the  real  value  of  the  budgetary  allocation  has  decreased.  Between  2000  and \n2007,  the  total  budget  in  real  terms  for  nonjudicial  agencies  dropped  by  about  5%,  with  DOJ \nexperiencing the largest decline of about 15%.  \n \n33. \nimpact on the quality of public service provided by other justice sector agencies, as follows: \n \n\nIn addition to its effect on the judiciary, budgetary constraints have also had a significant \n\n(i) \n\nThere  are  insufficient  resources  for  PNP  field  offices.  At  present,  PNP  field \noffices  receive  less  than  one-fourth  of  the  programmed  amounts  required  to \nsupport police operations in the field. Police officers responding to crimes do not \nhave the basic equipment and materials necessary to cordon off the crime scene. \nThey have to wait for specialized teams who perform crime scene investigation. \nDue to budget constraints, there are very few such teams that are authorized to \n\n                                                 \n18 In addition to regular court fees, the other legal fees comprising the JDF include bar examination fees, interest on \n\ndeposits  of  the  judiciary\u2019s  funds,  confiscated  bail  bonds,  income  from  the  publications  of  the  Supreme  Court    \nprinting press, and rental fees for the use of judiciary facilities. \n\n19 Under the provisions  of the local government code, LGUs are allowed to support the judiciary on a discretionary \nbasis. LGU contributions vary considerably and include office equipment, supplies and materials, augmentation of \njudicial  allowances,  additional  personnel,  office  repairs,  travel  and  training  allowances,  and  advances  on  utility \nfees. In low-income LGUs, the contributions ranged from P1, 000 to P9, 546 per month. In first class provinces, it \nranged from 0.02% to 0.95% of the LGU\u2019s revenues. In large cities, it ranged from 0.05% to 1.35% of the LGU\u2019s \nrevenues. Contributions to the prosecution service and the PNP have also been reported. \n\n20 ADB is in close coordination with the World Bank in relation to World Bank\u2019s recent report on procurement capacity \n\nassessment and the ACPI Evaluation Report for the Judiciary (unpublished as of July 2008). \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nprocess  crime  scenes.  As  a  result,  the  quality  of  collecting  evidence  in  crime \nscenes suffers. \nThere  has  been  a  considerable  increase  in  the  jail  population  in  recent  years, \nand  there  are  insufficient  resources  available  to  provide  prisoners  reasonable \nliving standards and adequate correction and rehabilitation services. It is striking \nthat more than 95% of the jail population has not been sentenced, which means \nthat  less  than  5%  of  detainees  are  serving  sentences  following  conviction  in \ncourt.  From  about  35,000  in  2000,  the  number  of  detainees  in  Bureau  of  Jail \nManagement  and  Penology  (BJMP)  jails  grew  to  more  than  62,000  in  2006. \nAbout  10%  of  detainees  are  women,  and  2%  are  minors.  Metro  Manila  jails \nreportedly  hold  400  times  more  prisoners  than  their  official  capacity.  A \nrehabilitation center in the province of Cebu that was built for 400 detainees was \nuntil recently crammed with 2,600 (Appendix 4, Sector Analysis).  \nNPS  has  insufficient  resources  to  fund  and  sustain  an  orientation  program  that \nwould increase the competence and efficiency of new hires. A training facility has \nbeen  made  available  to  the  NPS,  but  remains  unutilized  because  there  are  no \nresources to finance the program  plus staff, furniture, and equipment. NPS and \nthe Public Attorney\u2019s Office can offer only occasional training courses, which are \noften dependent upon international financial support.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n34. \nSqueezed  Discretionary  Spending  on  the  Justice  Sector.  Inadequate  budgetary \nresources have led justice sector agencies to prioritize recurrent expenses (primarily personnel) \nand fund all other expenses with whatever resources remain. Consequently, more than 80% of \njustice  sector  agencies\u2019  budgets  go  to  salaries,  leaving  less  than  15%  for  maintenance  and \nother  operating  expenses,  and  less  than  3%  for  capital  investment.  This  deviates  from  the \nprofile  of  the  national  government  budget,  which  devotes  32%  to  expenses  for  personnel \nservices and around 58% to maintenance and other operating expenses (Figure 5).  \n \n\nFigure 5: Comparison of National Budget Appropriations between Justice Sector and the \nRest of Government \n\nCapital Outlays 3% \n\nSalaries \n82% \n\nSalaries  \n32% \n\nGovernment \n\nJustice Sector \n\n             MOE \n             58% \n\n            MOE  \n            15% \n\nCapital Outlays \n                 10% \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMOE = maintenance and other operational expenses. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Note:  Entries include expenditures related to administration of justice that are identifiable in the GAA. \n  \n \n \n35. \nPersonnel  Vacancies.  Notwithstanding  the  fact  that  the  budget  of  justice  sector \ninstitutions  are  mostly  devoted  to  staff  salaries  and  allowances,  justice  sector  compensation \nrates are not comparable to those received by private sector counterparts. For example, lawyers \nemployed in justice sector agencies receive salaries that are generally about one-fifth of private \nsector lawyers\u2019 salaries. New law graduates, who are unqualified to become judges, can obtain \nstarting salaries in private sector firms that are above those provided to judges. As a result, high \nvacancy rates persist in the courts, which contributes to increasing justice sector workloads. In \naddition,  the  employed  staff  working  in  the  courts  for  comparatively-low  compensation  have \n\nSource: General Appropriations Act (GAA), 2007. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nweak  incentives  to  provide  efficient  and  effective  service.  While  there  have  been  efforts  to \nreduce judicial vacancies in the past 3 years, a further reduction in vacancies merits support. \n \n36. \nIn 2003, legislation authorized the payment of additional compensation (allowances) for \njudges,  increasing  basic  salaries  by  100%  over  4  years.21  As  a  result,  judicial  vacancies  have \ndecreased  from  one-in-every-three  judicial  positions  to  the  current  ratio  of  one-in-every-five \njudicial  positions  (Figure  6).    Together  with  a  number  of  reforms  targeted  at  improving  court \nefficiencies (para. 41), this has led to a decrease in judicial caseloads (Figure 7). While this has \nbeen a favorable development for court personnel, it has caused wage imbalances across the \njustice  sector.  The  MTPDP  has  observed  that  many  prosecutors  and  Public  Attorney\u2019s  Office \nlawyers  have  left  their  positions  to  join  the  judiciary,  while  referring  to  resource  and  salary \ndifferentials as possible reasons for the transfer. This highlights the need to develop a sector-\nwide strategy that diminishes the risk of creating vacancies in one agency as a result of filling \nvacancies in another.   \n \n37. \nAdditional  judicial  allowances  are  funded  mainly  from  court  fees,  and  not  from  the \njudiciary\u2019s  personnel  services  budget.  Therefore,  the  amount  of  additional  compensation  is \ncontingent  on  the  amount  of  court  fees  collected.  It  should  be  noted  that  in  order  to  fund  the \nadditional compensation the Supreme Court raised court fee levels. Similarly, extra allowances \nhave been legislated for lawyers in justice sector agencies (e.g., the NPS, Office of the Solicitor \nGeneral, and the Public Attorney\u2019s Office). In the instances of the NPS and Office of the Solicitor \nGeneral,  authorized  funding  for  these  allowances  comes  from  the  agencies\u2019  own  source \nrevenues,22 which decreases the likelihood that staff can receive the authorized allowances. The \nadditional allowances mandated under the law for Public Attorney\u2019s Office lawyers have yet to \nbe funded.  \n \n\n2. \n\nJustice Sector Integrity and Higher Standards of Conduct \n\n38. \nEnhancing  the  public\u2019s  perception  of  integrity  in  the  justice  system  is  a  serious \nchallenge.  A  recent  business  survey  showed  a  high  level  of  doubt  about  the  sincerity  of  a \nnumber  of  justice  sector  agencies  in  fighting  corruption.23  Most  of  the  justice  sector  agencies \nappear  to  have  satisfactory  codes  of  ethical  conduct  in  place  or  in  development  (e.g.,  the \njudiciary, PNP, and the NPS). However, knowledge of those codes among the relevant staff and \ngeneral public appears to be uneven.  The number of disciplinary cases seems small, given the \nlarge number of individuals involved in the administration of justice and the continued perception \nof widespread corruption. The American Bar Association, in its latest judicial reform survey for \nthe Philippines, pointed out that the \u201cdisciplinary process has adequate written criteria, specific \ndescriptions  of  misconduct,  and  a  fair  process.  However,  in  practice,  it  is  not  working \neffectively.\u201d 24 \n \n39. \nPerformance  Monitoring.  The  problem  points  to  a  need  for  stronger  measures  for \nperformance  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  rules  of  conduct.  The  Supreme  Court\u2019s  annual \nreport for 2007 enumerated an increasing number of disciplinary actions imposed on judges and \ncourt personnel. In June 2008, the Supreme Court reprimanded and heavily fined a Pasig City \n\n                                                 \n21  Republic Act 9227, approved 23 October 2003. \n22  The  Department  of  Justice  will  source  its  funds  to  implement  the  additional  compensation  from  the  fees  it  is \nauthorized to collect. Aside from the fees it is authorized to collect, the Office of the Solicitor General will source its \nfunds from 5% of the monetary awards given by the courts to its client government agencies \n\n23 2006\u20132007 Social Weather Station Surveys of Enterprises on Corruption, July 2007.

The  review  program  is  designed  as  a \npreventive  measure \nfor  negative  organizational  behavior  by \nstrengthening institutional regulations, structures, systems, and procedures.25 Using a balanced \nscorecard and a tool to assess and strengthen performance and integrity, the review program \nfocused  on  policies,  procedures,  and  practices  related  to  performance  management,  human \nresource  management,  financial  management,  corruption  risk  management,  internal  reporting, \nand investigation of undesirable behavior. The review program recommended actions relating to \nprocurement  and  implementation  of  a  code  of  conduct  for  judiciary  employees,  a  formal \ngrievance and complaints system, and performance monitoring.26 In addition, a committee has \nbeen formed to revise the performance review, and evaluation and monitoring standards of the \nSupreme  Court.  With  respect  to  other  justice  sector  agencies,  PNP  has  undergone  a  similar \nprocess  through  an  integrity  development  review  under  the  leadership  of  the  Office  of  the \nOmbudsman.  \n \n41. \nCivil  Society  Feedback  Mechanisms.  Nongovernment  organizations,  such  as  the \nSupreme Court Appointments Watch, aim to ensure that the selection of judges and justices is \nfair and transparent, and free from undue political influence. Nongovernment organizations can \nassist  in  holding  justice  sector  institutions  accountable  for  their  actions  and  raise  public \nconfidence in justice sector institutions and the rule of law.  \n\n                                                 \n25  Review  and  Enhancement  of  Performance  and  Integrity  has  identified  \u201chotspots\u201d  for  monitoring  among  \ndepartments  of the  judiciary, including  departments responsible for  procurement, disbursement, and recruitment, \namong others. This approach is similar to the Integrity Development Review program implemented by the Office of \nthe  Ombudsman  for  all  government  agencies.  Thus  far,  18  agencies  have  undergone  the  Integrity  Development \nReview.    Both  the  Review  and  Enhancement  of  Performance  and  Integrity  and  Integrity  Development  Review \nprograms  are  supported  primarily  by  USAID,  with  strong  support  from  development  partners.

A major challenge to the justice system is the persistent perception of \ndelay in the delivery of justice. The courts handle a caseload of about 1,100,000 cases per year \nyet are able to dispose of only about 450,000 cases per year, resulting in an additional 650,000 \npending cases each year. Despite the decrease in the total caseloads in recent years (Figure 7), \nthe decline of case backlog has not been significant. In fact, the clearance rate (volume of cases \ndisposed of as a percentage of total caseload) remained low (about 39%) in the past 3 years, \nindicating  that  case  backlog  remains  high.  However,  the  disposition  rate  (number  of  cases \ndisposed of as a percentage of case inflow) has been increasing, indicating that the courts have \nshown gains in efficiency (Appendix 4, sector analysis). \n \nImprovements in the disposition rate correlate with a number of reforms initiated under \n43. \nthe  APJR  to  increase  court  efficiency,  including  the  pilot  use  of  an  electronic  caseflow \nmanagement  system  in  Pasay  City  courts,  court-annexed  mediation  (discussed  in  para.  50), \nand  judicial  dispute  resolution  at  any  stage  of  litigation.  In  addition,  improvements  in  the \ndisposition  rate  also  correlate  with  a  decreasing  vacancy  in  judicial  positions,  which  was  a \ndevelopment brought about by increasing judges total compensation by about 100% (discussed \nin para. 36). Additional reforms to increase judicial efficiency include the establishment of case \nmanagement information systems in the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, Sandiganbayan (the \ncourt that adjudicates graft and corruption charges against high-level government officials), and \nCourt of Tax Appeals. \n \n44. \nOne  reason  that  the  backlog  in  the  disposition  of  criminal  cases  remains  high,  even  in \nthe midst of ongoing justice sector reforms, is that judicial performance is also affected by the \nperformance  of  other  justice  sector  agencies.  Delays  in  criminal  court  proceedings  have \nreportedly been caused in part by the nonappearance of witnesses, absence of prosecutors and \npublic defenders, and delays by law enforcement officers\u2019 in turning over evidence to the courts.  \n \n45.  With  regard  to  noncriminal  cases,  the  judiciary  has  recognized  alternative  dispute \nresolution as a means of encouraging speedy justice and reducing case backlog. The judiciary \nhas established the Philippine Mediation Center, which conducts court-annexed mediation, and \nprovided rules for the referral of a wide scope of cases that may be referred to court-annexed \nmediation  at  any  time  during  litigation.  A  more  effective  alternative  dispute  resolution  and \nmediation process at the barangay (village) level, the barangay justice system, has also proven \nto contribute to reducing case backlog. The barangay justice system settled more than 4 million \ncases between 1980 and 2005, with an average of about 150,000 cases per year. This number \nhas grown to about 300,000 cases per year recently and the percentage of mediated cases that \nwere settled has remained consistently high.27  \n \nIn spite of these initiatives, the perception that the delivery of justice is regularly delayed \n46. \nstill prevails. The interrelated nature of justice sector agencies\u2019 operations requires that delays \nbe  prevented  or  reduced  at  all  stages\u2014investigation,  dispute  resolution,  and  enforcement. \nAlthough the Constitution and laws impose time limits on the judiciary with respect to deciding \ncases,  there  are  generally  no  similar  provisions  for  other  justice  sector  agencies  involved, \nparticularly  when  the  likelihood  of  a  delay  occurring  is  high,  such  as  the  enforcement  of \njudgments.  As  a  result,  even  if  it  were  assumed  that  the  courts  were  keeping  within  the  time \nlimits imposed by the Constitution and the law, the perception of delays in the delivery of justice \nwould continue to exist if accused individuals were detained for long periods in police facilities or \n\n                                                 \n27  DILG summary of cases filed, actions taken, on Katarungang Pambarangay Implementation (from January 1980 to \n\nDecember 2005). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nin  district  prisons  while  waiting  for  a  complaint  to  be  filed  in  court.  For  criminal  cases,  other \njustice  sector  agencies  play  a  prominent  role in  bringing cases  to  the  courts:  DOF  and  BIR  in \nthe investigation of criminal tax evasion cases, PNP in the processing of crime scenes, and DOJ \nin case preparation and prosecution. Consequently,  the effective delivery of services by these \ninstitutions will ultimately contribute to the quality of the cases entering the court and help in the \nspeedy disposition and resolution of court cases.  \n \n47. \nFinancial  Management,  Planning,  and  Budgeting  Capacities.  There  is  a  need  to \nbuild  a  stronger  capacity  for  strategic  planning,  financial  management,  human  resource \ndevelopment,  information  management;  and  promote  a  culture  of  results-based  performance \nmanagement within justice sector agencies. Successful implementation of justice sector reforms \ndemand  that  participating  agencies  are  able  to  live  up  to  their  responsibilities  by  relating \nbudgets  to  strategy,  meeting  objectives,  adapting  to  changing  circumstances,  monitoring \nperformance, and reporting on results.28 Weak budget planning and monitoring capabilities afflict \nall justice sector agencies. In addition, as budget planning is conducted at the central office of \njustice sector agencies, field offices and court stations have even weaker financial management \ncapabilities.  These  inherent  weaknesses,  the  absence  of  resources  to  exercise  stronger \noversight functions, and the dearth of transparent procedures and accountability mechanisms all \ncontribute to the perception that the agencies are susceptible to corruption. It also contributes to \nthe  reluctance  of  the  oversight  agency,  DBM,  to  provide  greater  flexibility  and  control  over  its \nresources.   \n \n48. \nA key public expenditure management reform being implemented by the Government is \nthe  OPIF,  which  is  an  approach  to  expenditure  management  that  directs  resources  towards \nnational and departmental priorities and results in accordance with the Government\u2019s strategic \nplan. If effectively implemented, the OPIF clarifies roles, functions, and accountabilities between \nand  among  agencies,  and  accounts  for  their  performance.  With  better  internal  governance \narrangements  and  systems  to  capture  performance  data,  agencies  are  provided  greater \nflexibility and control over their internal resource deployment.29 Although justice sector agencies \nunder  the  executive  branch  have  adopted  the  OPIF  and  the  Supreme  Court  has  signified  its \ncommitment, the widespread adoption and implementation of the OPIF will be a lengthy process \nthat  requires  significant  strengthening  of  justice  sector  agencies\u2019  financial  management \nsystems. Agencies in the justice sector will need to establish their own performance indicators \nand  strategize  the  best  way  of  reaching  their  respective  indicators.  The  development  of \nbenchmarks and reasonable indicators will be a challenge for many agencies that have never \nbefore  engaged  before  in  similar  exercises.  Some  agencies,  such  as  DOJ,  that  have  adopted \nperformance indicators realize that they do not have the capability to monitor and collect data \nfrom their field offices (in DOJ\u2019s case, data from field prosecutors\u2019 offices) to determine whether \nor not they have reached their targets. In addition, measuring the efficient and effective delivery \nof justice requires both qualitative and quantitative measures.  \n \nOverly-Centralized  Decision  Making.  Highlycentralized  administration  continues  to \n49. \ncharacterize the operation of justice sector agencies. The inefficiencies and delays inherent in \nthis system of centralized decision making and resource allocation have been associated with \nmany  of  the  problems  of  poor  infrastructure  and  inadequate  operating  systems.  Within  the \njudiciary,  for  example,  all  applications  for  a  leave  of  absence  need  to  be  submitted  to  and \nprocessed  by  the  judiciary\u2019s  central  offices  in  Manila  regardless  of  where  the  request \n\n                                                 \n28  The findings draw from analytical work of ADB TA 3693 (ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the \nPhilippines for Strengthening the Independence and Defining the Accountability of the Judiciary. Manila) and ADB \nTA  4832  (ADB.  2006.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for  Enhancing  the  Autonomy, \nAccountability, and Efficiency of the Judiciary, and Improving the Administration of Justice. Manila). \n\n29  See Organizational Performance Indicator Framework FY2007, DBM (August 2006). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\noriginated.30  In  addition,  centralization  results  in  an  inability  to  prepare  for  and  respond  to  the \nmaintenance  and  other  operating  expenses  and  capital  expenditure  needs  of  field  offices  and \ncourt  stations.  Another  example  is  PNP,  where  more  than  95%  of  its  appropriations  from  the \nnational  budget  are  centrally  managed,  including  salaries  for  police  in  the  field,  and  less  than \none  fourth  of  the  amount  supporting  police  operations  in  the  field  (e.g.,  investigation, \nintelligence, and police relations) are allocated to the field offices.   \n \n50. \nA centralized administrative system hinders the efficient feedback of information from the \nfield  offices  to  the  central  offices.  For  example,  the  judiciary\u2019s  central  offices  require  the  trial \ncourts to submit reports that include a large number of tracking indicators. Because of the sheer \nvolume of these reports, the central offices are unable to monitor the performance of all the trial \ncourts.  As  a  result,  the  Supreme  Court  is  unable  to  use  the  reports  to  inform  its  decisions \nregarding  performance  improvement.  It  also  deprives  the  trial  courts  of  an  opportunity  to \ncompare their performance against that of their peers, and track their own improvement.  \n \n51. \nOn  14  November  2006,  the  Supreme  Court  issued  an  order  to  implement  reforms  to \nstrengthen  the  independence  and  fiscal  autonomy  of  the  judiciary  by  decentralizing  its \nadministrative and financial management functions through a pilot regional court administration \noffice, which was launched by the current chief justice in Region 7 in May 2008.31 A key feature \nof  the  decentralization  effort  was  the  creation  of  the  Judiciary  Autonomy  Fund,  which  is \nmanaged  and  controlled  by  the  chief  justice,  currently  through  the  Office  of  the  Court \nAdministrator. The fund  is the source of all disbursements to support expenditures of the pilot \nregional  court  administration  office  and  courts  in  the  Seventh  Judicial  Region.  The  Supreme \nCourt resolved that all funds attributable to the pilot regional court office in Region 7 and for all \ncourts  in  the  Seventh  Judicial  Region  shall  be  deposited  in  the  Judiciary  Autonomy  Fund.  All \nfunds  accruing  to  the  Seventh  Judicial  Region  for  its  use  and  operation  by  virtue  of  any \nlegislation  or  contractual  agreement  (e.g.,  budgetary  appropriation \nthe  national \nGovernment, LGU contributions, fees collected by courts, and revenues from the use or rental \nof court assets) shall be deposited to the Judiciary Autonomy Fund. \n \n\nfrom \n\n4. \n\nAccess to Justice by the Poor and Vulnerable Groups \n\n52. \nThe  poor  often  lack  awareness  of  their  rights  and  are  deterred  by  inconvenient  and \nunaffordable access to formal justice sector institutions. An ADB study has shown that there is a \nstrong  correlation  between  access  to  justice\u2014particularly  legal  empowerment  activities\u2014and \npoverty reduction. A survey taken in agrarian reform communities in the Philippines showed that \nareas that have received legal empowerment training and paralegal assistance benefited from \nhigher levels of productivity, income, and farm investment.32  \n \n53. \nThe  Constitution  of  the  Philippines  makes  it  the  Government\u2019s  duty  to  assure  citizens \nfree access to the courts and adequate legal assistance that \u201cshall not be denied to any person \nby reason of poverty.\u201d33 The Supreme Court has tried to operationalize this by providing relevant \nprotections to the rights of the accused and providing free legal counsel to the poor in the Rules \nof  Court.34  The  Supreme  Court  has  also  adopted,  as  part  of  the  Code  of  Professional \n\n                                                 \n30  A pilot regional court administration office for the pilot in Region 7 has been set up to handle these requests in lieu \n\nof the central office in Manila. It began regular operations in July 2008.  \n\n31  Region 7, the Central Visayas region of the Philippines, comprise the provinces of Bohol, Cebu, Negros Oriental  \n\nand Siquijor. \n\n32    ADB.  2001.

Available:  \n\n     http://www.adb.org/Documents/Others/Law_ADB/lpr_2001.asp?p=lawdevt#contents \n33   Const. art. III, sec. 14. \n34   Rules of Court Rules 112\u2013127. \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nResponsibility  of  Lawyers,  rules  that  prohibit  lawyers  from  (i)  rejecting  the  case  of  the \ndefenseless or the oppressed, (ii) refusing to serve the needy, and (iii) declining an appointment \nas counsel de officio or a request from the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) to render free \nlegal aid.35 Under the APJR, the Supreme Court issued a rule that exempts the poor from paying \ndocket  and  other  fees,  including  fees  for  the  transcript  of  court  proceedings  kept  by  the  court \nstenographer. In addition to the Public Attorney\u2019s Office, the IBP and a number of law schools \nand legal clinics provide free legal service to the poor and disadvantaged.36 \n \n54. \nGender  Responsiveness.  The  Supreme  Court  and  some  justice  sector  agencies  are \ncharacterized  by  maintaining  functioning  gender  and  development  committees  (e.g.,  the \nCommittee  on  Gender  Responsiveness  in  the Judiciary  at the  Supreme  Court,  the  Committee \non Gender and Development at DOJ, and the Human Rights Office at PNP) and related budgets \nand actions plans. The Supreme Court has a gender mainstreaming strategy that was finalized \nin 2007 after a gender assessment was carried out under the APJR. The assessment identified \nthe following key gender issues: (i) court processes, as well as processes of other justice sector \nagencies,  are  not  sensitive  to  the  conditions  and  circumstances  of  women  and  other \ndisadvantaged groups; (ii) although there have been a number of gender-sensitivity trainings for \njudges and other members of the court and the PNP, the justice sector staff has low awareness \nand  appreciation  of  gender  issues;  (iii)  women  currently  lack  economic  resources  and \nindependence,  and  the  justice  system  is  generally  insensitive  to  the  concerns  of  women  and \ngirls;  (iv)  the  lack  of  courts  and/or  judges,  prosecutors,  Public  Attorney\u2019s  Office  lawyers,  and \nmediators,  results  in  delays  in  the  administration  of  justice;  (v)  women  and  disadvantaged \ngroups  have  limited  knowledge  of  their  rights;  (vii)    information  on  the  nature  and  workings  of \nthe justice system is not readily available; and (viii) women living in poverty pose multi-layered \ngender  issues  for  the  justice  sector  (e.g.,  women  indigenous  persons,  women  in  the  informal \nsector,  women  in  agriculture).  The  gender  mainstreaming  strategy  of  the  Supreme  Court  is \ncurrently being revised. While the judiciary and the other justice sector agencies have a gender \nand development plan, implementation and monitoring capacities remain inadequate.  \n \nJail Decongestion. Access to justice by detained prisoners is currently a major problem \n55. \nin the Philippines. Over 95% of persons in BJMP-managed jails are detainees whose cases are \nstill being tried and have not yet been sentenced. It is common for detainees to serve additional \ntime awaiting their trial date in court because their case was not promptly processed following \narrest.  An  inmate  record  system  has  been  set  up  in  pilot  jails  managed  by  BJMP  to  more \neffectively monitor the inflow and outflow of detainees awaiting trial. The judiciary is deploying \nthree buses to jails and detention centers, as part of a Justice on Wheels program, to expedite \nthe  release  of  detainees  when  warranted.  The  Bureau  of  Corrections  (BuCor),  which \nadministers  prisons  for  convicts  with  sentences  of  3  years  and  longer,  has  launched  a \nreengineering  program  that  aims  to  make  its  operations,  including  processing  the  release  of \nprisoners when warranted, more efficient. Because the correctional and rehabilitation facilities in \nthe  Philippines  are  administered  by  several  agencies  (Appendix  4:  Sector  Analysis),  jail \ndecongestion  is  a  complex  process  that  entails  multi-agency  actions,  coordination,  and \nexchange of information\u2014all of which require careful assessment and strategic planning. \n\n                                                 \n35  Code of Professional Responsibility Canon 2, rule 2.01 and Canon 14.  \n36  Outstanding  examples  of  access  to  justice  programs  include  the  European  Union-supported  Supreme  Court \nprogram on \u201cAccess to Justice by the Poor through Information, Education and Communication,\u201d and the Barangay \nJustice  Services  System  and  Barangay  Justice  Advocates  training  program  supported  by  USAID.  Another  is  the \nWorld  Bank\u2019s  mobile  courts  program,  Justice  on  Wheels,  where  three  court  buses  have  been  acquired  and \ndeployed to strategic areas to serve as venues for court annexed mediation and hearings of detainees, particularly \nchildren in conflict with the law. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21\n\n5. \n\nDelivery of Justice through Alternative Dispute Resolution Mechanisms \n\n56. \n Alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, particularly recourse to the barangay justice \nsystem  and  mediation,  have  increased  access  to  justice.  Evidence  suggests  that  settlements \narrived  at  through  these  mechanisms  have  reduced  the  volume  of  complaints  flowing  into  the \ncourt system.  \n \nBarangay Justice System. USAID is supporting the Barangay Justice Service System \n57. \n(BJSS)  in  the  Autonomous  Region  in  Muslim  Mindanao  (ARMM).  The  BJSS  involves  training \nand mobilization of barangay justice advocates, who are citizen-volunteers  trained in barangay \njustice law; a paralegal course; basic counseling and mediation, alternative dispute resolution, \nand  Shari\u2019a  (customary  Muslim)  law.  The  barangay  justice  advocates  perform  the  following \nfunctions: (i) facilitate resolution of conflicts in their respective communities, (ii) assist parties to \nlook  for  options  within  the  rule  of  law,  and  (iii)  assist  in  enhancing  community  awareness  and \nencourage appropriate use of the justice system.  \n \n58. \nIn  2006,  a  USAID-funded  review  of  BJSS  concluded  that  when  compared  with \ncommunities  that  do  not  participate  in  the  program,  BJSS  barangays  (i)  had  a  significantly \nhigher  number  of  disputes  resolved;  (ii)  awareness  of  the  barangay  justice  system  was \nsignificantly higher; (iii) awareness of individual rights and responsibilities in the justice system \nwas significantly higher; (iv) the role of women in settling disputes, the number of women trained \nto settle disputes, and the number of disputes settled by women were higher; and (v) community \ncooperative  activities  were  higher.  Barangays  under  the  BJSS  also  had  significantly  higher \nlevels  of  participation  in  civic  organizations,  relative  to  barangays  who  are  not  covered  by  the \nBJSS program.   \n \n59. \nCourt-Annexed  Mediation.  Court-annexed  mediation,  which  the  Supreme  Court \ninstituted in 2001, is a system of referring certain cases to mediators.37 There is evidence that \ncourt-annexed  mediation  can  assist  in  de-congesting  court  dockets.  The  Supreme  Court \nestablished  the  Philippine  Mediation  Center  within  its  training  arm,  the  Philippine  Judicial \nAcademy,  to  set  up  mediation  centers  in  court  houses  and  other  convenient  locations \nthroughout the country and to run the mediation system. Currently, there are 113 units in 11 of \nthe country\u2019s 13 judicial regions. More than 75% of all cases that underwent mediation during \nthe pilot court-annexed mediation project were settled. To date, more than 500 mediators have \nbeen trained, 300 of whom are currently accredited by the Supreme Court.   \n \n60. \nIn spite of these successes, there is a need to encourage stakeholders to make full use \nof these alternative mechanisms. As an example of a high success rate for settling cases, the \nuse of court-annexed mediation has not been maximized, as only a small percentage of eligible \ncases are being submitted to mediation. Judges have reportedly been reluctant to refer cases \nwithin  the  scope  of  court-annexed  mediation.  With  the  passage  of  the  Alternative  Dispute \nResolution  Act,  Congress  has  recognized  the  important  role  that  arbitration,  mediation, \nconciliation, and other similar private mechanisms can play in resolving disputes. However, the \nlaw has not yet been implemented, as Congress has yet to approve the draft implementing rules \nprepared by DOJ. Notwithstanding the fact that private dispute resolution is regularly provided \nfor  in  international  commercial  business  contracts,  there  appears  to  be  low  demand  for \narbitration  and  similar  mechanisms  in  the  Philippines.  Local  lawyers  and  representatives  of \nforeign  investment  groups  have  suggested  that  the  public  is  uncertain  about  how  arbitration \n\n                                                 \n37  Supreme Court Administrative Matter No. 01-10-5-Supreme Court PHILJA, 16 October 2001. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\nproceedings  and  awards  would  be  treated  by  the  courts.  They  have  also  expressed  doubts \nregarding the Government\u2019s capacity to enforce arbitration awards.  \n \nD. \n\nLesson  \n\nSeparation  of Powers and Judicial Independence. A key lesson from the  Access to \n61. \nJustice  Program  in  Pakistan,  ADB\u2019s  first  justice  sector  reform  program,38  is  that  one  cannot \ndivorce the issue of separation of powers, or judicial independence, from a justice sector reform \nprogram,  even  when  it  is  focused  on  technical  and  management  reforms.  This  lesson  is \nparticularly  critical  in  the  Philippines,  which  has  a  strong  legal  tradition  recognizing  judicial \nindependence  and  where  justice  sector  agencies  deal  with  each  other  in  a  cautious  fashion. \nJustice sector reform requires engagement with several justice sector reform champions. Even \nin  Pakistan  where  the  Access  to  Justice  Program  was  developed  in  an  environment  where \npolitical  consensus  was  facilitated  by  a  strong  executive,  a  key  lesson  learned  was  that  the \nMinistry of Law and Justice, as the executing agency, could not realistically be assumed to take \non a leadership role for an entire justice sector that comprised a number of diverse agencies. In \nthis  instance,  the  executing  agency  that  was  responsible  for  program  leadership  and \nimplementation had limited formal relations with the judiciary, which was a major implementing \nagency. There were issues related to the speed in which project funds allotted to the judiciary \nwere  being  disbursed.  In  addition,  the  Ministry  of  Law  and  Justice  did  not  have  direct \nsupervision  of  the  police,  which  came  under  the  Ministry  of  Interior\u2019s  control.  As  a  result,  the \npolice reform component of the Access to Justice Program in Pakistan enjoyed limited success \nwhen compared to that enjoyed by the judicial reform efforts.  \n \n62. \nTo support several justice sector reform champions and build support for justice sector-\nwide reform in the context of the principle of separation of powers inherent in the justice sector, \nstrong and sustained policy dialogue is required. The importance of policy dialogue in sustaining \njustice sector reform was an important lesson in the example of Pakistan. The policy dialogue \nmust be supported by research and baseline studies, and informed by the participation of civil \nsociety.  In  the  Philippines,  it  appears  it  would  be  useful  to  achieve  consensus  by  focusing  on \nissues  that  all  justice  sector  agencies  deem  as  important  and  develop  a  process  of  dialogue, \nwhich  is  equally  important  to  the  consensus  that  results.  Once  dialogue  among  justice  sector \nchampions  has  been  established,  it  should  be  widened  to  include  other  justice  sector \nstakeholders and civil society.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nObjective and Scope \n\n63. \nThe  GJSRP  aims  to  support  the  justice  sector  in  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  by  (i) \nincreasing resources available to the justice sector to levels that would reasonably enable the \nefficient delivery of justice services, (ii) supporting government efforts to strengthen the rule of \nlaw  in  the  Philippines  by  enhancing  the  efficiency  and  integrity  of  justice  sector  agencies,  (iii) \nimproving access to justice by the poor and vulnerable groups with a specific focus on gender-\nbased discriminatory practices and gaps, and (iv) improving investor confidence and public trust \nin justice sector agencies. The proposed GJSRP  consists of two subprograms. Subprogram 1 \nwill  focus  on  increasing  resources  to  the  justice  sector  and  supporting  the  efficient  delivery  of \n\n                                                 \n38 The GJSRP is ADB\u2019s second justice sector reform program. The first, Access to Justice Program in Pakistan, \nwhich addressed reforms relating to judicial processes and institutions, police and public safety, prosecution, \nadministrative justice and alternative dispute resolution, was approved on 20 December 2001 as a $350 million \nprogram loan (including a $20 million TA loan and a $1.3 million TA). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n23\n\njustice  service.  Subprogram  2  will  focus  on  institutional  capacity  building  to  deliver  justice \nservices to communities and implement measures to address key justice sector priorities. \n \n64. \nThe  GJSRP  includes  a  series  of  policy  reforms  and  capacity-building  activities  that \nunderpin the priorities of the MTPDP and related sector strategies. These reforms are designed \nto accomplish the following:  \n\n(i)  Strengthen \n\njudicial \n\nfiscal  autonomy,  and \n\njustice  sector \naccountability  and  access \nfinancial \nmanagement  systems,  supporting  decentralization  of  financial  management  and \nadministrative  capabilities,  and  making  remuneration  in  the  justice  sector  more \ncompetitive: \n\nto  resources  by  enhancing  public \n\nimprove \n\n(ii)  Enhance  justice  sector  integrity  through  the  development  and    enforcement  of \ncodes  of  conduct  and  the  participation  of  civil  society  in  monitoring  justice  sector \nreview; \nperformance  and \ntransparency  in  the  judicial  selection  and  appointment  process;  and  the  wide  and \ntimely dissemination of judicial decisions: \n\nintegrity;  conduct  of  an \n\nintegrity  development \n\n(iii)  Improve justice sector efficiency through the development of efficient case flow \ninvestigation,  prosecution,  and  court  processes; \nmanagement;  streamlined \nsustainable capacity-building programs for justice sector staff, and the promotion of \na sector-wide approach to justice reform: \n\n(iv)  Improve  access  to  justice  by  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups  through  the \ndesignation  of  selected  courts  to  expeditiously  handle  small  claims;  capacity \nbuilding  of  selected  justice  sector  agencies  to  support  gender  and  development-\nrelated reforms and activities; and a comprehensive multisectoral jail decongestion \nstrategy:  \n\n(v)   Expand delivery of justice through supporting the implementation of efficient and \n\neffective alternative dispute resolution mechanisms nationwide. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions under Subprogram 1 \n\nAll policy measures required for the first tranche of subprogram 1 were completed by the \n\n \nB. \n\n65. \nend of July 2008.  \n \n\n1. \n\nStrengthened Judicial Fiscal Autonomy, and Improved Justice Sector \nAccountability and Access to Resources \n\n66. \nJustice  Sector  Administration  and  Results-Based  Management.  Justice  sector \nagencies under the executive branch have adopted the OPIF, and the Supreme Court has also \nsignified its commitment. The leadership of the judiciary issued a statement early in 2008 on the \njudiciary\u2019s commitment to use OPIF in budget preparation, fiscal management, and planning.39 \nTo demonstrate the judiciary\u2019s commitment to the OPIF, the pilot court administration office in \nRegion  7  has  prepared  its  proposed  2009  budget  following  the  OPIF  template  and  principles. \nThe  judiciary\u2019s  adoption  of  the  OPIF  strengthens  its  capacity  to  plan  and  manage  its  own \nresources,  and  improve  its  capability  to  exercise  fiscal  autonomy.  However,  the  judiciary\u2019s \nadoption of the OPIF in practice will require significant strengthening of the judiciary\u2019s financial \nmanagement  systems  and  a  change  management  process.  Under  subprogram  1,  second \ntranche, it is expected that the field offices of justice sector agencies will be able to implement \nthe OPIF for budget preparation and performance monitoring by August 2009, and the Supreme \nCourt is expected to submit an OPIF-compliant budget for 2010. \n \n\n                                                 \n39 In 2007, the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA), Sandiganbayan, and CA began work on their OPIF-compliant budgets, \n\nwhich includes the submission of a logical framework in their budget submissions.  \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\ninefficiencies.  New  management \n\n \n \n67. \nApart  from  adoption  of  the  OPIF,  other  financial  management  reforms  that  increase \njustice sector agencies\u2019 accountability in the use of public funds that have been completed by \nJuly 2008 include: the judiciary\u2019s preparation and adoption of the MTEP 2008\u20132010 and a new \ngovernment  accounting  system,  and  the  formation  of  bids  and  awards  committees  in  justice \nsector agencies. Under subprogram 1, second tranche, it is expected that the judiciary will have \nprepared and adopted a rolling MTEP for 2009\u20132011 that will reflect information on the use of \nthe Judicial Autonomy Fund established in connection with the pilot regional court administration \noffice.  \n \n68. \nDecentralization  of  Financial  Management  and  Administrative  Functions  of  the \nJudiciary. To further strengthen its capacity to exercise fiscal autonomy, the Supreme Court en \nbanc  approved  an  assessment  report  on  existing  financial  management  practices  in  the \njudiciary.  The  report  recommended  financial  management  reforms  and  a  decentralized \nadministrative  structure  to  correct  deficiencies.  Thereafter,  the  Supreme  Court  approved  the \nrecommended  reforms  under  a  decentralized  administrative  structure.  As  discussed  above,  a \npilot  regional  court  administration  office  was  established  in  Region  7  (RCAO  7)  to  address \neasily-identifiable  redundancies  and \ntools  are  being \nimplemented in RCAO 7, including gradual implementation of the OPIF. Other reforms in RCAO \n7  include  budget  submissions  that  fully  reflect  and  account  for  the  use  of  fines  and  duties \ncollected by the courts, LGU contributions, and funds reallocated from unfilled positions in the \njudiciary\u2019s budget. Guidelines promoting transparency in the use of all resources available to the \ncourts,  including  contributions  from  LGUs,  have  been  issued  by  the  RCAO  7  administrator, \nunder authority of the Supreme Court. RCAO 7 will support enhanced financial systems that \nwill  track  all  receipts  and  expenditures  irrespective  of  their  origin.  Under  subprogram  2,  it  is \nexpected that RCAO 7 will be replicated in at least two additional regions of the Philippines. \n \n69. \nIncreased  and  Improved  Access  to  Resources.  The  continued  and  successful \nimplementation of these reforms in the judiciary and in other justice sector agencies depends on \nincreased  allocations  of  budgetary  resources.  As  of  July  2008,  the  Government  had \ndemonstrated  an  increased  budgetary  commitment  through  the  following  measures:  (i)  the \nNational Expenditure Program for 2009 reflects an increase in the judiciary\u2019s budget of at least \n18.8%,  and  (ii)  DOJ  has  increased  the  levels  of  capital  outlay  in  2008  by  140%  from  2006 \nlevels.  In  addition,  the  National  Expenditure  Program  for  2009  reflects  proposed  allotments  to \npartially  fund  two  new  laws  strengthening  the  Office  of  the  Solicitor  General  and  Public \nAttorney\u2019s  Office.  A  key  requirement  for  release  of  the  second  tranche  is  that  the  National \nExpenditure  Program  for  2010  reflects  a  proposal  to  fully  fund  these  two  new  laws. \nDemonstrating  its  commitment  to  implement  improved  financial  management  capability,  the \nSupreme  Court  has  submitted  an  OPIF-compliant  proposed  budget  to  support  implementation \nof the pilot RCAO 7 beginning in 2009.40  \n \n70. \nUnder  Subprogram  1,  second  tranche,  the  National  Expenditure  Program  for  2010  will \npropose to provide the judiciary with a national Government-sourced budget that is equivalent to \nat  least  1%  of  the  Government\u2019s  total  expenditure.  In  addition,  under  subprogram  1,  second \ntranche,  DBM  will  start  the  release  of  scheduled  allocations  to  the  judiciary  in  line  with  the \napproved budget and agreed-upon operational cash program of the Supreme Court, in full each \nquarter and without conditions.  \n \nLikewise  under  subprogam,  1  second  tranche,  the  National  Expenditure  Program  for \n71. \n2010  will  propose  that  other  justice  sector  agencies  compliant  with  the  OPIF  will  be  provided \n\n                                                 \n40 The pilot RCAO 7 operations, which started in July 2008, are funded by savings in the 2008 budget of the judiciary. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n25\n\nreal  increases  in  budgetary  resources,  taking  into  consideration  inflation  and  their  approved \nMTEPs,  and  based  on  performance,  absorptive  capacity,  and  the  prevailing  macroeconomic \nsituation of the country. \n \n72.  Making Remuneration in the Justice Sector More Competitive. Unless justice sector \nsalaries  and  facilities  are  gradually  brought  closer  to  competitive  levels,  the  incentives  for \ncorruption will slow progress in implementing other aspects of the GJSRP, such as enhancing \nintegrity.  While  salary  comparisons  are  different,  the  salaries  of  lawyers  in  public  service  are \nindicative  of  the  disparity  between  public  and  private  rates.  Entry  level  salaries  of  lawyers  in \njustice  sector  agencies  are  about  one-fifth  of  market  levels  in  the  private  sector.41    New  law \nschool graduates can often obtain starting salaries in the private sector above those provided to \njudges.  As  regards  members  of  the  judiciary,  the  first  major  step  has  already  been  taken.  A \n100% increase in judicial compensation was phased in over a 4-year period (2003\u20132006). The \nincrease  was  implemented  by  providing  judicial  allowances  equal  to  base  level  salaries.  A \nfurther  program  along  this  line  needs  to  be  developed  by  other  justice  sector  agencies  in \ncooperation with DBM to help finance further effective salary increases. Such a program is to be \nagreed upon with DBM as a key trigger under subprogram 2.  \n \n73. \nThe doubling of judicial compensation over the 2003\u20132006 period through the provision \nof  allowances  has  already  shown  positive  results.  In  particular,  a  correlation  has  been  noted \nbetween  the  decreasing  number  of  judicial  vacancies  and  increasing  court  efficiency  levels. \nWhile these improvements are meaningful, judicial salaries remain far below competitive levels. \nAs such, an equivalent program to further raise judicial salaries funded from the national budget \n(as distinguished from raising judicial compensation, where additional compensation is sourced \nfrom court fees) is envisaged to be reflected in a phased salary adjustment plan indicated as a \ntrigger under subprogram 2. \n \n74. \nThe  issue  of  understaffing  is  even  more  severe  in  justice  sector  agencies  under  the \nexecutive branch. Even as extra allowances have been legislated to address high vacancy rates \nin NPS and the Office of the Solicitor General and Public Attorney\u2019s Office, authorized funding \nfor  allowances  at  the  NPS  and  Office  of  the  Solicitor  General  comes  from  the  agencies\u2019  own \nsource revenues, and Public Attorney\u2019s Office allowances remain unfunded. Under Subprogram \n1, second tranche, DBM will include a special provision in the National Expenditure Program for \n2010  to  fund  the  benefits  and  allowances  provided  by  law  to  the  Public  Attorney\u2019s  Office  and \nOffice of the Solicitor General, where vacancies have been a major problem in the past. As the \njustice  sector  is  hamstrung  by  these  vacancies  and  the  low  quality  of  existing  staff,  there  is \npressing need to raise justice sector salaries closer to market levels under subprogram 2. \n \n\n2. \n\nEnhanced Justice Sector Integrity \n\n75. \nThe  Program  will  support  implementation  of  recommendations  under  the  review  and \nenhancement of performance and integrity program for the judiciary, and the conduct of integrity \ndevelopment  reviews  for  the  other  justice  sector  agencies.  It  will  support  the  completion  of \ncodes  of  conduct  in  the  justice  sector  agencies,  where  none  currently  exist,  and  the \nestablishment of systems to monitor and enforce compliance, and sanction violations. \n \n                                                 \n41 For example, for new legal graduates the base salary in the NPS is P12,548 per month. In certain circumstances, it \nis  possible  to  almost  double  this  base  pay  with  allowances  if  the  funding  for  such  allowances  is  available  (such \nallowances are generally only partially funded and are  not available at other justice sector agencies such as the \nPublic Attorney\u2019s Office and Office of the Ombudsman). By comparison, market related salaries for new graduates, \nas benchmarked at Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, are P31,952 per month and including benefits, about P56,000 per \nmonth, which is almost 4.5 times the base salaries at the NPS. At business process outsourcing centers, new law \ngraduates command starting salaries of P80,000 per month or almost 6.4 times the base salary at the NPS.   \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\n76. \nCivic  Participation  to  Enhance  Enforcement  and  Performance  Management.  This \nprogram  supports  the  Government\u2019s  initiatives  to  garner  strong  civic  participation  in  order  to \nintroduce  greater  accountability  of  judges  and  other  justice  sector  agencies\u2019  personnel  to  the \npublic. The Judicial and Bar Council (JBC) that nominates candidates for judicial appointments \nhas undergone a major transformation to ensure the appointment of well-qualified judges. Clear \nand  objective  criteria  (e.g.,  measures  of  integrity,  probity,  and  independence)  are  now \nannounced for short-listed candidates and the ratings of all nominees are provided to the public \non  the  JBC\u2019s  website  to  ensure  full  transparency.  The  JBC  has  opened  interviews  of  judicial \nnominees of certain courts to the public, including civil society organizations such as Supreme \nCourt Appointment Watch. \n \n77. \nTransparency  in  Judicial  Decisions.  Steps  have  been  taken  to  increase  the \ntransparency  of  judicial  decisions,  initially  by  ensuring  that  all  Supreme  Court  decisions  are \navailable on their website within 48 hours of promulgation. The Appellate Courts will follow suit \nunder subprogram 2, while RCAO 7 will implement this reform as soon as it is fully operational.  \n \n\n3. \n\nSupporting Efficiency in the Justice Sector  \n\n78. \nCase  Flow  Management.  Major  steps  have  been  taken  to  develop  case  tracking  and \ncaseflow management systems to ensure the timely administration of justice. Automated case \nmanagement information systems have been installed in the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, \nCourt  of  Tax  Appeals,  and  the  Sandiganbayan.  A  caseflow  management  system  has  been \nestablished at the Office of Court Administrator, and the system has been piloted to track and \nmanage  the  caseloads  of  lower  courts  in  Pasay  City.  As  a  result  of  the  pilot  experience,  the \nsystem has been enhanced by the experience and best practices of judges around the country. \nThese  measures,  together  with  the  decrease  in  judicial  vacancies,  have  resulted  in  a  higher \ncase disposition rate.  \n \n79. \nTo  speed  up  the  processing  of  probable  cause  (preliminary  investigation)  cases  that \nprecede the filing of a criminal complaint with the court, the NPS has reviewed the flow of such \ncases  in  the  prosecution  service,  streamlined  business  processes  relating  to  such  cases,  and \ncompleted an administrative manual and revised prosecutors\u2019 operations manual reflecting the \nstreamlined  processes.  These  processes  are  the  basis  for  the  development  of  an  automated \nthe \nprosecutors\u2019  case  management \nprosecutors\u2019 disposition of probable cause cases. With respect to criminal tax evasion cases, a \nparallel program has been initiated to adopt consistent guidelines on evidentiary requirements in \nconnection with tax evasion cases to be filed by BIR with DOJ. These common guidelines aim \nto  ensure  that  the  cases  filed  by  BIR  are  soundly  developed  and  successfully  prosecuted.  An \ninternal  management  unit  has  been  established  in  the  NPS  to  implement  and  monitor  these \nreform priorities at DOJ. \n \nStrengthening  Investigation,  Prosecution,  and  Adjudication  Functions  in  the \n80. \nJustice Sector. To strengthen investigation and prosecution capabilities in the NPS, the DOJ is \ntaking the lead in developing badly-needed training programs and operational manuals for the \ngrossly-understaffed  NPS  office.  Understaffing  arises  from  salaries  that  are  about  20%  of \nmarket rates and generally appeal only to a segment of the inexperienced new law graduates \nfor  a  limited  period  of  time.  Prosecution  effectiveness  can  only  be  achieved  as  salaries  are \nmoved closer to competitive levels and additional training and guidance are provided. Similarly, \nthe  Office  of  the  Solicitor  General  has  developed  a  comprehensive  training  strategy  for  its \nsolicitors. Other notable capacity-building reforms in the justice sector that were accomplished \nby July 2008 include the judiciary\u2019s development of a distance learning program for judges and \nof a human resource development program for nonjudicial employees. \n\ninformation  system,  which \n\nis  expected \n\nto  speed \n\n \n\n\f \n\n27\n\nimplemented  continuous \n\n \nStreamlining  Court  Processes  and  Creation  of  New  Courts.  To  promote  efficiency \n81. \nthrough  amended  rules,  the  Supreme  Court  has  amended  the  rules  of  court  to  clarify  when  a \npetition of certiorari may be entertained,42 which would allow for the case to be brought directly \nto the Supreme Court. The amended rules seek to address past misuse and over-use of such \ntrials  on  a  pilot  basis. \npetitions.  The  Sandiganbayan  has \nComplementary  to  efforts  to  streamline  court  processes  to  improve  efficiency,  legislation  was \npassed  establishing  a  third  division  in  the  Court  of  Tax  Appeals  that  is  expected  to  hear  an \nincreased number of criminal tax evasion cases, given the Government\u2019s focus on such cases; \nand  the  Court  of  Tax  Appeals\u2019  jurisdiction  was  expanded  to  hear  criminal  tax  evasion  cases \ninvolving P1 million and above.  \n \n82. \nSupporting  Justice  Sector  Coordination.  To  achieve  maximum  efficiency  in  the \ndelivery of justice, justice sector agencies need to coordinate reform efforts. A first step in this \ndirection  was  the  signing  of  a  memorandum  of  agreement  for  the  creation  of  the  Judiciary \nExecutive  and  Legislative  Advisory  and  Consultative  Council.  Although  the  council  is  mainly \nintended  to  discuss  issues  relating  to  the  budget  of  the  judiciary,  it  signifies  that  all  three \nbranches of government recognize the need for dialogue on issues of common interest relating \nto  justice  sector  performance.  Under  subprogram  1,  second  tranche,  a  justice  sector \ncoordination  council  will  be  formed  to  act  as  a  forum  for  dialogue  and  preparation  of  a  justice \nsector  reform  program  comprising  the  Supreme  Court,  National  Economic  Development \nAuthority (NEDA), Office of the Solicitor General, Office of the Ombudsman, DBM, DILG, DOF, \nand DOJ.  \n \n\n4. \n\nAccess to Justice by the Poor and Vulnerable Groups \n\n83. \nIn  June  2008,  the  Supreme  Court  simultaneously  held  several  nationwide  summits  on \nincreasing  access  to  justice  by  the  poor.  The  summit\u2019s  objective  was  to  hear  directly  from \nvarious  stakeholders  in  the  justice  system  about  their  concerns  over  access  to  justice, \nparticularly through the judicial system, and recommendations on how the Supreme Court could \naddress  these  concerns.  The  feedback  from  the  summits\u2019  has  enabled  the  Supreme  Court  to \nbetter  protect  and  enforce  constitutional  rights  and  ensure  that  legal  assistance  is  provided  to \nthe underprivileged.  \n \n84. \nThe  judiciary  has  also  increased  access  to  justice  through  the  development  of  a \nframework  for  expediting  the  litigation  of  small  claims.  The  judiciary  has  adopted  rules  of \nprocedure to provide a framework for the expedited handling of small claims, and 22 pilot courts \nhave  been  designated  to  handle  small  claims.  The  newly-adopted  procedures  use  judicial \ndispute resolution, which was piloted during the APJR, to speed up the litigation of small claims. \nThe judiciary has also deployed three Justice on Wheels mobile courts to detention centers and \nareas without courts or judges to hear cases in these areas.  \n \n85. \nGender  Responsiveness.  To  increase  responsiveness  to  the  needs  of  women,  the \njudiciary, DOJ, and PNP have each adopted a gender action plan and will actively monitor and \nevaluate  its  implementation.  In  particular,  PNP  is  further  expanding  the  establishment  of \nwomen\u2019s and children\u2019s desks in all police stations with the mandate to administer and handle \ncases involving women and children victims of gender-based crimes. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n42 A petition to the Supreme Court to review the acts of a government agency on the ground that the agency acted \nwithout  or  in  excess  of  its  jurisdiction,  or  acted  in  grave  abuse  of  discretion,  amounting  to  a  lack  or  excess  of \njurisdiction. \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\n \n\n \nJail  Decongestion.  Jail  decongestion  is  a  complex  process  that  requires  multi-agency \n86. \nactions,  coordination,  and  exchanges  of  information,  given  that  correctional  and  rehabilitation \nfacilities in the Philippines are administered by several agencies. It is expected that the problem \nof detainees and overstaying prisoners can be reduced over the medium term through a set of \nfocused  actions  coordinated  among  BuCor,  BJMP,  DOJ,  DILG,  the  Supreme  Court,  and  non-\ngovernment organizations and development partners. The actions will include enhancement of \nBJMP\u2019s  pilot  inmate  record  systems  and  the  development  of  a  rollout  plan  to  implement  the \nprogram  nationwide.  Detainees  who  have  stayed  beyond  the  incarceration  period  that  would \nhave been meted had they been convicted of the crime would be set free, thereby decongesting \novercrowded city and municipal jails. With the support of civil society and legal aid groups, such \nactions  can  be  implemented  and  monitored.  Coordinating  these  actions  with  the  Supreme \nCourt\u2019s Justice on Wheels program\u2014where mobile court units are fielded to jails and detention \ncenters to set overstaying detainees free\u2014will put in place a comprehensive jail decongestion \nprogram.  \n \n\n5. \n\nExpanding Delivery of Justice through Alternative Dispute Resolution  \n\n \n87. \nThe Supreme Court has adopted a business strategy to rollout court-annexed mediation \nto quickly resolve disputes at reduced costs through mediation to reduce pressure on the courts. \nCourt-annexed mediation will be fully introduced nationwide under subprogram 2. Mechanisms \nstrengthening  the  barangay  justice  system,  which  has  demonstrated  evidence  of  effectively \nresolving conflicts outside of the court system at the community level, will be introduced during \nGJSRP implementation.  \n \nThe  GJSRP  will  also  support  strategies  to  improve  the  enforcement  of  international \n88. \narbitration awards. A key finding of a process map on the resolution of commercial disputes that \nsurveyed  foreign  business  chambers  regarding  the  use  of  arbitration  was  that  it  is  difficult  to \nenforce foreign arbitration awards in the Philippines. The perception remains that enforcement \nof an arbitration award can be blocked by further litigation in the courts on the grounds of fraud \nor bad faith as claimed by a disgruntled party. To address the impediments to enforcement and \npromote  efficiency  of  the  dispute  resolution  mechanisms  that  are  crucial  for  foreign  direct \ninvestors,  the  Supreme  Court  has  undertaken  a  study  of  the  issues  to  ensure  prompt \nenforcement of foreign arbitration awards.  \n\n \n\n89.  While  all  policy  actions  for  tranche  1  of  subprogram  1  have  been  accomplished,  there \nare 8 policy triggers for tranche 2 that the Government and development partners will focus on, \nas follows: \n \n\nPolicy Triggers for Subprogram 1, Second Tranche \n \n\n1.  Supreme Court to submit OPIF-compliant budget for 2010 \n2.  Supreme Court to prepare and adopt a rolling MTEP 2009\u20132011 that \nincludes information on the use of the Judiciary Autonomy Fund \n\n3.  DBM to submit a National Expenditure Program for 2010, which shows \nthat benefits and allowances provided to justice sector agencies (e.g., \nPublic Attorney\u2019s Office and Office of the Solicitor General) under \nexisting laws are fully funded \n\n4.  National Expenditure Program for the 2010 budget includes a DBM \nproposal to provide (i) the judiciary with a budget sourced from the \nnational Government equivalent to at least 1% of total government \nexpenditure,  and (ii) other justice sector agencies that are compliant \nwith the OPIF real increases in budgetary resources  \n\n5.  DBM will have fully and unconditionally release the scheduled cash \n\n \n\n\f \n\n29\n\nallocations to the judiciary in line with the approved budget and agreed \nupon operational cash program of the Supreme Court. \n\n6.  Supreme Court en banc to approve replication of RCAO 7 in at least \n\ntwo selected regions other than Region 7 \n\n7.  Supreme Court work and financial plan to reflect that the proposed \n\ncapital expense, MOOE, and related expenses for RCAO 7 in its 2009 \nbudget are allocated to fund the full implementation of additional \nRCAOs in 2009 \n\n8.  DBM shall submit a National Expenditure Program for 2010 to \n\nCongress, which shall reflect a line item budget provision for OSG\u2019s \nreorganization and physical expansion, in accordance with existing \nlaw. \n\n \nDBM  =  Department  of  Budget  and  Management,  MTEP  =  Medium  Term \nExpenditure Program, MOOE = maintenance and other operating expenses, OPIF \n=  organizational  performance  indicator  framework,  OSG  =  Office  of  Solicitor \nGeneral, RCAO 7 = Regional Court Administration Office in Region 7. \n\n \nC. \n\nPolicy Triggers for Subprogram 2 \n\n90. \nThe  development  policy  letter  sets  out  the  Government\u2019s  reform  agenda  for  the  next  \n3  years,  building  on  the  reform  momentum  of  subprogram  1.  There  are  8  triggers  for \nsubprogram 2 described in Appendix 2. The milestones that will be monitored for subprogram 2 \nare also described in Appendix 2.   \n \n91. \nImpact and Outcome of the Program Cluster. The proposed GJSRP will support the \nGovernment in its efforts to enhance the rule of law in the Philippines. GJSRP implementation \nwill  result  in  improved  governance  and  efficiency  of  justice  sector  agencies  while  expanding \naccess to justice by (i) strengthening judicial fiscal autonomy, justice sector accountability, and \nimproving access of justice sector agencies to resources; (ii) enhancing the integrity of justice \nsector  personnel;  (iii)  supporting  the  governance  and  efficiency  of  justice  sector  agencies;  (iv) \nexpanding  access  to  justice  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups,  with  specific  focus  on \naddressing  gender-based  discriminatory  practices  and  gender  gaps;  and  (v)  expanding  the \ndelivery of justice through alternative dispute resolution. The Program is expected to result in a \nmore  rapid  and  efficient  processing  of  cases,  while  the  timeliness  and  accessibility  of  court \ndecisions will be enhanced. Reflecting better access of the poor and  vulnerable groups to the \njustice  system,  there  will  be  an  expected  decline  in  the  time  legal  aid  clients  spend  in  pretrial \ndetention.  There  will  also  be  increased  use  of  arbitration  and  court-annexed  mediation,  more \ncertainty  in  court  decisions,  and  the  increased  recognition  of  international  arbitration  awards, \nwhich has been a contentious issue for foreign investors.  \n \nD. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $300,000,000  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \n92. \nresources in support of subprogram 1 of the GJSRP. The loan will be disbursed in two tranches: \n$150,000,000  upon  loan  effectiveness  and  $150,000,000  when  the  second  tranche  conditions \nhave  been  fully  complied,  which  is  anticipated  by  August  2009.  The  loan  will  have  a  15-year \nterm, including a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  and  a  commitment  charge  of \n0.15%  per  annum.  The  Government  has  made  its  own  independent  decision  to  borrow  under \nADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  and  has  confirmed  that  this  choice  was  not  made  on  the \nbasis of any advice from ADB. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\n \n\n93. \nThe  Government  envisages  that  a  loan  of  $300,000,000  will  be  needed  to  finance \nsubprogram 2, the loan amount to be confirmed at the time of loan processing in 2010. Prior to \nthe processing of subprogram 2, the Government will have demonstrated satisfactory progress \nwith  program  implementation  of  subprogram  2  policy  triggers.  The  proposed  triggers  for \nSubprogram 2 are as set out in the policy matrix in Appendix 2. \n \n94. \nThe  program  loan  reflects  the  development  financing  needs  of  the  Government  (Table \n6). The Government aims to increase development and social spending in 2008 and, given the \nneed  for  additional  funding  to  mitigate  the  effects  on  the  poor  of  the  slowdown  in  the  US \neconomy and the surge in rice prices, the Government envisages a targeted Government deficit \nof  no  more  than  1%  of  GDP  in  2008,  0.5%  of  GDP  in  2009,  and  a  balanced  budget  in  2010. \nGross and net financing needs are larger than the planned government budget deficit, because \nof the amortization of external and domestic debt. Finally, there are substantial budgetary costs \nto  the  Government  arising  from  the  Program.  The  release  of  the  second  tranche  will  set  the \nstage  for  a  permanent  increase  in  the  2009  budget  of  about  19%  for  the  judiciary  alone, \namounting  to  about  P2.02  billion  (excluding  pension  lump  sum  obligations).43  The  present \ndiscounted value of the increase in the Judiciary\u2019s budget, which is in perpetuity, is estimated to \nbe  several  times  the  ADB  financing.  Other  direct  costs  of  the  Program  include  implementing \nsystems to reduce caseload backlog in the court system and congestion in jails, and a program \nof the Supreme Court to increase access to justice for the poor. \n \n\nTriggers for Subprogram 2 \n\n \n1.  SC to implement OPIF judiciary-wide  \n2.    The  judiciary  to  prepare  and  submit  to  en  banc  for  its  consideration  and  approval  the \nrationalization program including a phased salary adjustment plan in accordance  with the proposed \nSalary Standardization Law III. \n3.    DBM  to  approve  the  rationalization  program  submitted  by  the  justice  sector  agencies  in  the \nexecutive branch, and these agencies shall adopt and start implementing the program \n4. NEP for 2011 budget to show DBM proposal that justice sector agencies compliant with OPIF will \nbe provided real increases in budgetary resources.   \n5.

The Supreme Court and DOF will be the executing agencies. \n95. \nThe Supreme Court will be responsible for program activities focused upon judicial reforms and \nthe DOF will be responsible for other program activities. Given the independence of the judiciary \nfrom  the  executive  branch  of  government  under  the  Philippine  Constitution,  it  is  deemed \nnecessary to establish two executing agencies so that the responsibility for attaining outcomes \nspecific to one of the two branches of government is accounted for separately.  \n \n96. \nThe  implementing  agencies  will  be  DOJ,  DILG,  DBM  and  OSG.  Each  of  the \nimplementing  agencies  will  be  responsible  for  meeting  the  policy  actions  or  program  activities \nunder  their  respective  agencies.  The  Supreme  Court  and  DOF  will  jointly  set  up  a  program \ncoordination  committee  comprising  representatives  from  DBM,  DOJ,  DILG  and  OSG.  The \nprogram  coordination  committee  will  be  co-chaired  by  the  Head  of  the  International  Finance \nGroup of DOF and the SC\u2019s Court Administrator, and will be responsible for implementing and \nsustaining  program  components.  The  committee  will  meet  quarterly  to  coordinate  and  ensure \neffective  implementation  of  the  proposed  reforms.  ADB  may  be  invited  to  participate  in  the \nmeetings  as  an  observer.  The  Supreme  Court  and  DOF  will  be  responsible  for  program \nimplementation  activities  within  their  respective  scope,  report  implementation  progress,  and \nprovide guidance and direction to the implementing agencies. \n \n97. \nImplementation  Period.  The  first  tranche  of  subprogram  1  covered  the  period  from \nJanuary 2006 to July 2008. All actions included in the policy matrix under the first tranche have \nbeen  implemented  within  this  period.  The  second  tranche  of  subprogram  1  covers  the  period \nfrom July 2008 to August 2009. Subprogram  2 extends from September 2009 through August \n2010. The Government and ADB will prepare a program completion report by June 2011. \n \n98. \nProcurement  and  Disbursement.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full \nforeign  exchange  cost  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in \nADB member countries, excluding ineligible items,44 and imports financed by other bilateral and \nmultilateral sources. In accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement \nProcedures  and  Related  Requirements \nimport \ndocumentation  will  be  required  if  during  each  year  that  loan  proceeds  are  expected  to  be \ndisbursed the value of the Philippines\u2019 total imports minus imports from nonmember countries, \nineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development assistance is equal to \nor  greater  than  the  amount  of  the  loan  expected  to  be  disbursed  during  such  year.  The \nGovernment  will  certify  its  compliance  with  this  formula  with  each  withdrawal  request. \nOtherwise, import documentation under existing procedures will be required. ADB reserves the \nright  to  audit  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  Government\u2019s \ncertification.  \n \n99. \non Combating Money Laundering (2003) were explained to the Government. All relevant  \nADB  guidelines,  including  the  Procurement  Guidelines  (2006,  as  amended  from  time  to  time), \nGuidelines  on  Use  of  Consultants  (2006,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  the  Loan \nRegulations, were specifically brought to the attention and notice of the Government. Consistent \nwith its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will require the \n\nAnticorruption.

As regards to the specific governance and anticorruption measures, the GJSRP\u2019s design \nis to addresses governance and anticorruption issues by strengthening integrity mechanisms in \nthe judiciary and justice sector agencies in the executive branch of government. \n \n101.  Accounting,  Auditing,  and  Reporting.  ADB  retains  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  loan \nproceeds  and  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  Government\u2019s  certification  for  the  withdrawal \napplications. Prior to withdrawal, the Government will open a deposit account with the Bangko \nSentral ng Pilipinas (Philippine Central Bank) to receive the loan proceeds. The account will be \nmanaged, operated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB. DOF will be \nrequired  to  submit  semiannual  progress  reports  and  a  final  report  on  the  progress  of \nsubprogram 1 implementation.  \n \n102.  Counterpart  Funds.  Counterpart  funds  generated  by  the  GJSRP  will  be  used  by  the \nGovernment under the arrangements satisfactory to ADB to support sector reform and meet the \nadjustment  costs  associated  with  the  GJSRP,  as  agreed  upon  by  the  Government.  The \ncounterpart  funds  generated  from  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  transferred  from  the  Treasury  to \nDOF  and  the  Supreme  Court  to  meet  the  costs  and  counterpart  funding  requirements  for \nimplementing sector reform. \n \n103.  Monitoring  and Review. In coordination with the committee (para. 81), ADB will carry \nout  periodic  reviews  of  progress  implementation  and  assess  the  impact  of  the  GJSRP.  The \nGovernment will keep ADB informed of the outcome of policy discussions with other multilateral \nand  bilateral  agencies  that  have  implications  for  GJSRP  implementation  and  will  provide  ADB \nwith  the  opportunity  to  comment  on  any  resulting  policy  proposals.  ADB,  in  collaboration  with \nthe  committee,  will  undertake  a  review  of  program  performance  12  months  after  loan \neffectiveness to review the outcomes of subprogram 1.  \n \n\nV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n104.  The  TA  will  focus  on  strengthening  capacity  to  deliver  targets  envisioned  under \nsubprogram 2. The total cost of the proposed TA will be in the amount of $2,200,000, of which \nADB will finance $1,500,000 on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s technical assistance funding program \nand  $500,000  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  ADB-administered  Gender  and  Development \nCooperation Fund. The Government will provide the additional $200,000 in-kind, in the form of \nadministrative  and  support  costs,  including  salaries  of  counterpart  staff,  secretarial  support, \nsupplies,  office  accommodation,  local  transportation,  miscellaneous  costs  for  training  courses, \nand per diem associated with attendance at appropriate events not covered under this TA. The \nSupreme Court and DOF will be the joint executing agencies. DOJ, DBM, and DILG will be the \nimplementing agencies for the TA. The TA components are as follows: \n \n105.  Strengthening  Judicial  Fiscal  Autonomy,  Justice  Sector  Accountability,  and \nImproved  Access  to  Resources.  The  TA  will  assist  the  justice  sector  in  cascading  financial \nmanagement reforms such as the OPIF to field offices. In the judiciary, this subcomponent will \nadapt financial management reforms that are being piloted in the RCAO 7 for rollout in not less \nthan  three  other  selected  regions.  This  is  expected  to  increase  the  judiciary\u2019s  capacity  to \noversee lower courts and provide transparent financial recording and accounting of the Judiciary \nAutonomy Fund, budgets corresponding to unfilled positions, and LGU contributions through the \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n33\n\nregional court administration offices. It is also expected to increase the lower courts\u2019 capacity to \nplan,  manage,  and  demand  the  resources  required  for  smooth  operations  in  support  of \nproposals to increase the lower courts\u2019 share of maintenance and other operational expenses, \nand  the  capital  outlay  budget  of  the  judiciary.  It  will  also  support  a  study  to  streamline  justice \nsector  agencies.  For  the  judiciary,  this  study  should  include  a  proposed  strategy  to  shift  the \nfunding of allowances, which are equivalent to 100% of judges\u2019 salaries and currently sourced \nmainly by court fees, to the national budget.   \n \n106. \nImproving Integrity and Individual Accountability in the Sector. The TA will support \nimplementation  of  recommendations  in  the  review  and  enhancement  of  performance  and \nintegrity (para. 39) concluded in the judiciary, the setting up of an integrity unit at the Supreme \nCourt, and customization of internal controls manuals for justice sector agencies. Reforms that \naim  to  improve  the  performance,  management,  and  evaluation  of  the  judiciary  will  also  be \nsupported. The development of codes of conduct and similar documents in agencies that do not \nyet have such codes will be supported. Measures that improve transparency and increase the \nrole  of  civil  society  in  monitoring  justice  sector  performance  and  the  implementation  of \nappointments and disciplinary procedures will also receive support. \n \n107.  Supporting  Efficiency  in  the  Justice  Sector.  The  TA  will  support  the  continuing \ndevelopment  of  the  case  management  information  systems  in  the  judiciary  and  the  NPS,  and \nrelated  change  management  programs.  The  establishment  of  a  forum  (the  Justice  Sector \nCoordination Council) to discuss and coordinate justice sector reforms will be supported. As the \nGJSRP\u2019s  performance  depends  on  the  Government\u2019s  actions,  the  TA  will  support  the \ndevelopment and implementation of a monitoring and evaluation system for the Program.  \n \n108.  Access  to  Justice  by  the  Poor  and  Vulnerable  Groups.  The  fourth  area  of  support \nconcerns  the  implementation  of  the  judiciary\u2019s  program  to  increase  access  to  justice  by  the \npoor,  including  the  implementation  of  a  comprehensive  jail  decongestion  program  through  the \nrollout  of  a  simplified  inmate  record  system.  The  TA  will  support  civil  society  participation  in \npolicy  dialogue  and  reform  implementation.  Under  this  component,  the  TA  will  pursue  the \nobjective  of  gender-based  development  in  the  justice  sector  by  building  the  gender-based \ncapacities of selected justice sector agencies. This output will strengthen the PNP\u2019s women and \nchildren\u2019s desk officers program and pilot test a stress management program for these officers. \nIn the NPS, the TA will support gender-sensitivity trainings and related benchmarking activities \nto  track  performance.  In  the  judiciary,  the  TA  will  develop  benchmark  indicators  and \nperformance standards for family courts, develop related amendments to the rules of court and \nadministrative  procedures  on  gender-based  violence,  and  support  training  on  the  gender-\nsensitive handling of cases in family courts. The activities will be implemented in municipalities \nand  cities  within  selected  provinces.  These  efforts  will  be  piloted\u2014under  the  Gender  and \nDevelopment  Cooperation  Fund\u2014in  Region  7,  which  includes  the  provinces  of  Cebu,  Bohol, \nNegros  Oriental,  and  Siquijor.  Based  on  the  implementation  of  pilot-tested  activities,  the \nGovernment is expected to extend the proposed activities to the national level. \n \n109.  Support  for  Alternative  Dispute  Resolution.  The  fifth  area  of  support  relates  to  the \nuse of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, particularly the barangay justice system. This \nwill  include  training  and  support  for  barangay  justice  advocates,  community  mediators,  and \nparalegals to enable them to assist community members, particularly members of the poor and \nvulnerable groups, in dealing with disputes. The individual components of the proposed TA are \noutlined  in  a  Supplementary  Appendix  on  Technical  Assistance  Support  for  Governance  in \nJustice Sector Reform. \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\n \n\n \n\nVI. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nimproved \n\nincentives, \n\n110.  Benefits.  The  Program\u2019s  principal  benefits  are \nincreased \nresources,  and  greater  accountability  all  leading  to  a  higher  quality  of  public  services  in  the \njustice  sector.  Primary  beneficiaries  will  be  justice  sector  agencies  and  staff,  who  will  benefit \nfrom  a  better-resourced  justice  sector.  While  most  benefits  are  expected  to  emerge  over  the \nlong  term,  in  the  short  to  medium  term,  competitive  salaries  and  higher  budgets  will  reduce \nvacancies among judges and prosecutors, improve information and case management systems, \nand provide the basis for a progressive reduction in delays in the justice system. Consequently, \nthe Program will also benefit users of the justice system, who will enjoy the more efficient and \neffective delivery of justice. Faster court decisions and wider dissemination of information about \nthese decisions will improve understanding among individuals and businesses about the costs \nand  benefits  of  seeking  contract  enforcement  through  the  formal  court  system,  mediation, \narbitration, and/or informal mechanisms of dispute settlement. The Program also has a special \nfocus on the poor and disadvantaged groups, especially women and children. \n \n111.  A key benefit is the deepening of a results-based performance management framework \nby which individuals, agencies, and departments can be held accountable through the OPIF and \nperformance-based  budgets.    When  fully  in  place,  this  framework  will  draw  all  justice  sector \nagencies  into  the  national  MTEF  exercise  in  which  each  agency  aligns  its  priorities  and \nperformance  targets  with  national  targets  under  the  MTPDP  for  executive  agencies,  and  the \nSupreme  Court  for  the  judiciary.  Strengthened  accountability  over  the  use  of  public  resources \nwithin  the  justice  sector  is  a  major  benefit  to  be  achieved  through  a  modern  performance \nmanagement  framework.  Deepening  and  widening  public  participation  and  feedback  in  the \njustice sector will further strengthen accountability mechanisms and provide a set of incentives \nto improve service delivery across justice sector agencies.  \n \n112.  Social  and  Environment  Safeguards.  The  GJSRP  will  not  involve  any  involuntary \nresettlement  nor  have  a  negative  impact  on  indigenous  people  or  the  environment.  It  is \nclassified  as  category  C  with  respect  to  involuntary  resettlement,  and  impact  on  indigenous \npeople  and  the  environment.46  The  GJSRP  is  a  general  intervention  aimed  at  supporting \ngovernance  reforms  in  the  justice  sector  and  in  that  respect  it  is  expected  to  have  an  indirect \npositive effect on poverty reduction  by improving access to justice by the poor and vulnerable \ngroups,  and  by  creating  a  governance  environment  that  promotes  investment  and  more \nsustainable economic growth (Appendix 7).  \n \n113.  Assumptions and Risks. The GJSRP assumes political stability in the Philippines and \nsustained  implementation  of  sound  macroeconomic  policies  by  the  Government.  Given  the \nPhilippines\u2019 encouraging results in establishing a resilient macroeconomic framework since the \nAsian  financial  crisis,  both  of  these  assumptions  appear  to  be  valid  and  defensible.  However, \nimplementation of the GJSRP could face a number of risks for which mitigation measures have \nbeen designed: \n\n(i) \n\nExogenous  shocks.  The  Philippines  economy  in  2008  has  been  affected  by \nthree adverse developments in the external environment: (a) the financial sector \nknock-on  effects  from  the  US  financial  crisis,  (b)  the  US  and  global  economic \nslowdown,  and  (c)  commodity  and  fuel  price  increases.  In  recognition  of  the \nimpact  of  these  exogenous  shocks  to  its  fiscal  position,  the  Government  has \n\n                                                 \n46    The  GJSRP  is  classified  as  Category  C  since  it  is  unlikely  to  have  environmental  impacts;  no  involuntary \nresettlement effects foreseen, the program neither require a resettlement plan nor a resettlement framework; and \nhave no impact on indigenous people and therefore do not require special provisions for them. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n35\n\nadjusted  its  fiscal  balance  targets  from  2008  to  2010.  The  easing  of  the  fiscal \ntarget  will  provide  more  headroom  for  expenditures,  including  the  needed \nincreases  in  budgetary  resources  for  justice  sector  agencies.  The  Government \nhas  remained  steadfast  in  its  development  program\u2014increased  infrastructure \nspending, support for critical sectors (e.g., mining, business process outsourcing, \nand  tourism)\u2014in  support  of  economic  growth,  while  also  sustaining  its  revenue \nmobilization efforts. Nevertheless, it is expected that there will be a net economic \nslowdown  that  will  adversely  affect  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to  increase  fiscal \nresources allocated to the justice sector.  \nJudicial  fiscal  autonomy  and  administrative  independence.  While  the \nConstitution  protects  fiscal  autonomy  and  the  independence  of  the  judiciary,  in \npractice  budgetary  constraints  and  weaknesses  in  administration  hamper  the \nexercise  of  fiscal  autonomy  and  independence.  Rectifying  the  situation  will \nrequire  strong  commitment  to  good  governance  from  the  judiciary  and  other \ngovernment  entities,  including  LGUs.  It  will  also  depend  on  the  speed  and \ncommitment \nits  personnel  establish  strong \nadministrative  and  financial  mechanisms  that  are  transparent,  participatory,  and \nprovide  a  strong  sense  of  accountability  for  the  use  of  public  resources.  Under \nthe  attached  TA,  ADB  will  continue  to  support  the  judiciary  in  its  fiscal  and \nadministrative  reforms,  including  support  for  change  management  to  help \nmitigate this risk. \nResistance  to  governance  reforms.  There  will  be  resistance  to  the  reforms \nfrom affected personnel, in particular from middle- to high-level staff that have a \nvested  interest  in  the  existing  power  structure  and  illegal  rents.  This  risk \nreinforces  the  need  for  change  management  to  be  supported  by  an  effective \nadvocacy  program  targeted  at  internal  and  external  shareholders.  For  this \nreason,  a  change  management  and  advocacy  component  is  included  in  the \naccompanying  TA.  The  risk  will  also  be  mitigated  by  continued  policy  dialogue \nwith the Government and other stakeholders. \n\njudiciary  and \n\nin  which \n\nthe \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(v) \n\n(iv)  Weak  absorptive  capacity.  Weak  absorptive  capacity  of  implementing  justice \nsector agencies due to inadequate resources (financial and human) will continue \nto undermine the impact of reforms. However, close performance monitoring and \ntargeted  technical  assistance  to  implementing  agencies  will  help  reduce  the \nadverse effects of implementation delays due to capacity constraints.  \nSlow pace of civil service reforms. The slow pace of civil service reforms that \nlimits the ability of justice sector agencies to rationalize their staff and transform \nthose  savings  into  higher  levels  of  remuneration  for  attracting  and  retaining \nqualified  personnel  undermines  ongoing  initiatives  to  improve  capacity.  To \naddress  this  risk  in  the  judiciary,  the  TA  includes  support  for  the  judiciary  to \nprepare  a  staff  rationalization  plan  for  submission  to  DBM  and  the  Civil  Service \nCommission. In addition, change management support is required to give justice \nsector staff time to understand, internalize, and put into practice the reforms. \nGovernance reversals. There is a risk that current governance reforms may be \nreversed  by  future  governments.  This  risk  may  be  mitigated  by  ongoing  policy \ndialogue  with  the  Government  as  well  as  other  stakeholders,  including  the \njudiciary,  the  legislative  branch,  civil  society,  and  development  partners.  The \nprogram cluster targets reforms that are in the public interest so that the reversal \nof  reforms  by  future  governments  may  become  less  likely.  Support  under  the \naccompanying  TA  to  the  new  Justice  Sector  Coordination  Council  will  facilitate \npolicy  dialogue,  enhance  related  capacity,  and  help  build  greater  public \nawareness of the ongoing reform agenda.  \n\n(vi) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\n \n\nVII. \n\nSPECIFIC ASSURANCES \n\n114. \nIn  addition  to  the  continued  compliance  and  implementation  of  the  actions  specified  in \nthe Program\u2019s policy matrix and standard assurances, the Government has given the following \nspecific assurances: \n \n\n(i) \n\n (ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n (iv) \n\nPolicy  matrix.  The  Government  will  ensure  the  satisfactory  implementation  of \nthe  Program  and  will  accomplish  the  actions  set  out  in  the  policy  matrix,  in \nparticular,  actions  that  are  conditions  for  the  release  of  Tranche  2.  The \nGovernment will submit documents, in a form satisfactory to ADB, as evidence to \ndemonstrate compliance. The Government will carry out the policies and actions \nin accordance with the schedule of policy reforms contained in the policy matrix \nand ensure that the reforms in the justice sector are sustained. \nPolicy dialogue.  \n(a) \n\n \n\nThe  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of,  and  will  from  time  to  time \nexchange views on, the progress made in carrying out subprogram 1. In \naddition,  the  Government  will  continue  policy  dialogue  with  ADB  on \nimplementation  of \nproblems  and  constraints  encountered  during \nsubprogram  1  and  on  appropriate  measures  to  overcome  or  mitigate \nsuch problems and constraints. \nThe Government will keep ADB informed of policy discussions with other \nfor \nmultilateral  and  bilateral  agencies \nimplementation  of  subprogram  1,  and  will  provide  ADB  with  an \nopportunity \nto  comment  on  any  resulting  policy  proposals.  The \nGovernment will take ADB\u2019s views into consideration before finalizing and \nimplementing any such proposals. \n\nimplications \n\nthat  have \n\n(b)  \n\nCounterpart funds.  The Government will ensure that the counterpart funds will \nbe used to finance the local currency costs relating to the implementation of the \nProgram  and  other  activities  consistent  with  the  objectives  of  the  Program  and \nwill provide necessary budget appropriations to finance the structural adjustment \ncost relating to the implementation of reforms under the Program.  \nSubprogram 1 review and evaluation \n(a) \n\nInformation.  DOF  and  the  Supreme  Court  will  provide  ADB  with  all \nrelevant  data  and  information  in  such  detail  as  ADB  may  reasonably \nrequest to facilitate review by ADB of the progress in the implementation \nof subprogram 1. \nReports. DOF and the Supreme Court will prepare the quarterly progress \nreports as well as closing report on subprogram 1.  \nSubprogram  1  review.  At  the  end  of  subprogram  1,  DOF  and  the \nSupreme Court will ensure that a review is undertaken for subprogram 1. \nThe  review  will  identify  the  lessons  learned,  to  be  used  for  input  in  the \ndesign of the proposed subprogram 2 of the Program Cluster. \nSubprogram  1  review  report.  A  subprogram  1  review  report  will  be \nsubmitted  to  ADB  that  (a)  assesses  compliance  with  the  policy  actions \nunder subprogram 1, including tranches 1 and 2; (b) assesses progress \nwith implementation of complementary activities under the overall reform \nprogram;  (c)  reviews  fiscal  performance  and  updated  fiscal  estimates; \nand  (d)  defines  requirements  for  adjustments  to  activities  under  the \nproposed Subprogram 2. \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n \n\n\f \n\n37\n\n \n115.  The following is the condition for program loan effectiveness:  \n\n \nThe  Government  will  have  established  the  program  coordination  committee,  which  will \nbe co-chaired by DOF and the Supreme Court, and comprise representatives from DOJ, \nDILG, DBM, and the OSG. \n\nVIII.

The Philippines Medium Term Development \nPlan  2004  -  2010  highlights  the  importance  of  strengthening  the  rule  of  law  and  the  public \nservice  delivery  of  the  Justice  Sector  as  a  basic  need.  It  envisions  a  judiciary  that  is \nindependent,  effective  and  efficient.  It  also  envisions  a  holistic  and  integrated  reform  effort  in \nthe justice system. \n \nThe  Justice  sector  is  an  interlocking  set  of  agencies  that  includes  the  judiciary  and  agencies \nfrom  the  executive  branch,  including  prosecutions,  enforcement,  corrections,  penology  and \ninstitutions  for  public  legal  assistance.  Improving  the  public  service  delivery  of  justice  sector \ninstitutions require a number of interlinked reforms including strengthened incentives to deliver \npublic services, enhanced expenditure and budget management capabilities and accountability \nfor  use  of  resources,  more  efficient  delivery  of  justice,  greater  citizen  voice  and  participation \nand access to justice. \n \nGovernment is committed to this program, which focuses on resolving the budgetary restraints \non  the  Judiciary  and  is  reflective  of  the  importance  given  in  the  Philippines  to  improving \ngovernance  of  the  entire  Justice  Sector.  These  efforts  are  intended  to  create  a  just  and \nequitable  society  through  enhancing  the  rule  of  law  in  the  Philippines.  The  economic  impacts \nwill  follow  from  greater  investor  confidence  and  an  improved  investment  climate,  resulting  in \nhigher  growth  and  renewed  poverty  reduction.  These  objectives  will  be  achieved  through \nimproved governance and public service delivery by the Justice Sector. \n \nThe  Judiciary  has  been  independently  developing  its  reform  program  since  2000  under \ntechnical  assistance  importantly  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  but  also  from  other \ndevelopment  partners.  The  current  program  shown  in  the  attached  matrix  is  now  being \nimplemented under the Judiciary's prerogative 'as an independent branch of the Government. \n \nThe  key  outputs  of  s tren g the ned   ju dic ia l   fisca l   a u ton omy,  j us tic e   sec tor   accountability, \nand  improved  access  to  resources  are  to  be  achieved  through  application  of  a  series  of \nfinancial  management  reforms  including  performance  based  budgeting.  The  Judiciary  will  be \nshowcasing  through  the  pilot  Regional  Court  Administrator's  Office  (RCAO)  in  Region  7,  the \napplication of performance-based budgeting that  is both transparent as well as comprehensive \nin terms of incorporating all sources of revenues and all uses of funds. \n \nSteps  have  been  taken  to  enhance  justice  sector  integrity  by  setting  higher  standards  of \nconduct  and  their  enforcement  and  conducting  integrity  development  reviews  of  agencies \n\n\f42      Appendix 2 \n\n \n\n \n\nwithin  the  justice  sector.  To  improve  access  to  justice  by  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups, \nthe  Judiciary  has  supported  an  expanded  Justice  on  Wheels  program,  with  a  focus  on \nassisting  in  the  decongestion  of  jails;  the  designation  of  small  claims  courts  to  expedite  the \nhandling of small claims, and the implementation of a gender and development action plan. To \nexpand  delivery  of  justice  through  alternative  dispute  resolution,  the  Supreme  Court  has \nadopted  a  business  strategy  to  rollout  and  expand  their  Court  Annexed  Mediation  to  resolve \ndisputes  speedily  at  reduced  costs  through  mediation  while  reducing  the  pressure  on  the \nCourts. \n \n\nAs  regards  improvements  in  justice  sector  efficiency,  major  steps  have  been.  taken  by \ndeveloping  case  tracking  and  case  management  systems  at  the  Supreme  Court,  Court  of \nAppeals,  Sandiganbayan,  Court  of  Tax  Appeals  and  the  Office  of  the  Court  Administrator,  as \nwell  as  in  the  National  Prosecution  Service  (NPS),  an  integral  office  in  Department  of  Justice \n(DOJ). DOJ has also developed training programs and operational manuals for NPS to improve \nprosecutor capability to handle cases assigned to them. \n\nBudgetary  Resource  Requirements.  The  continued  implementation  of  these  reforms  will be \ndependent  on  increased  levels  of  real  budgetary  resources.  Initially  in  reference  to  the  2009 \nbudget, increased budgetary allocations will be required to fund the RCAO in Region 7 as well \nas  increased  access  to  justice  by  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups  that  will  also  be  piloted  in \nRegion  7.  In  the  subsequent  budgets  for  2010  and  beyond,  the  Department  of  Budget  and \nManagement  (DBM)  is  committed  to  the  proposed  real  increases  in  the  Justice  sector \nagencies'  budgets  in  line  with  their  OPIF  compliant  submissions,  to  cover  the  costs  of  the \nprogram implementation. In the case of the Judiciary, the medium term objective is to at least \nrestore its one percent share of proposed total Government expenditures. \n\nThe  Government  is  fully  committed  to  the  reform  in  the  justice  sector  and  is  determined  to \nimplement  the  actions  outlined  in  the  Policy  Matrix  attached  hereto  within  the  agreed \ntimetable.  The  Government  is  committed  to  maintaining  an  active  policy  dialogue  with \ndevelopment partners on implementation of the agreed actions and the progress of the reform \nto ensure that the objectives of the GJRP are met. \n\nIn  conclusion,  we  would  like  to  convey  to  ADB  that  the  Judicial  and  the  Executive  Branches \nremain  independently  supportive  of  the  governance  and  justice  reform  program  outlined \nabove. \n\n \n \n    \n \n \n\n Reynato S.

The  judiciary,  the  core  justice  sector  institution \n(discussed  extensively  in  para.  4),  interprets  laws  and  determines  their  application  in  actual \ndisputes.1  The  executive  branch  is  in  charge  of  implementing  the  existing  body  of  laws  and \nplays a variety of roles in justice sector operations. It supervises certain offices that have been \ngranted  investigatory,  prosecutorial,  or  dispute  resolution  powers.  It  has  the  prerogative  to \nchoose whom to prosecute for criminal violations and the power to apprehend and punish law \nbreakers. It also has the power to grant reprieves, commutations, and pardons; and remit fines \nand forfeitures after a final judgment of conviction had been issued by a court.2 In addition, laws \nhave granted certain agencies under the executive quasi-judicial powers the authority to resolve \ncertain  disputes  within  these  agencies\u2019  specific  jurisdiction  as  set  forth  by  the  law,  which \ngenerally  may  be  appealed  to  the  judiciary  on  questions  of  law  (as  opposed  to  questions  of \nfact). An overview of justice sector agencies is provided below. \n \n2. \nThe  judiciary,  led  by  the  Supreme  Court,  is  an  independent  branch  of  government  co-\nequal  to  the  executive  and  legislative  branches.  The  judiciary  comprises  the  Supreme  Court, \nCourt of Appeals, Court of Tax Appeals, the Sandiganbayan (a special anticorruption court), and \nlower  courts.  There  are  some  2,166  lower  courts  throughout  the  country,  including  56  Shari\u2019a \ncourts in the Autonomous Regions of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). Under the 1987 Constitution, \njudicial  power  expressly  includes  not  only  the  settlement  of  controversies  involving  legally-\nenforceable rights, but also it is the duty of the courts to review acts of government for possible \ngrave  abuses  of  discretion.  The  Constitution  also  strengthened  judicial  independence.  Its \npowers to appoint, discipline, and remove officials and employees of the judiciary for cause, and \nto adopt its own rules of procedure were recognized. It granted the judiciary fiscal autonomy and \nprohibited the reduction of appropriations for the judiciary below the previous year\u2019s level.3  All \ncourts and court personnel are under the administration and supervision of the Supreme Court. \n(A discussion on judicial independence appears in the section on Sector Issues below.) \n \nIn the executive branch, a key justice sector agency is the Department of Justice (DOJ). \n3. \nThe  Secretary  of  Justice  is  tasked  with  the  protection  of  the  Government\u2019s  and  people\u2019s  legal \ninterests. Assisted by the DOJ\u2019s legal staff, the Secretary provides legal advice and a variety of \nlegal  services  to  the  Government,  its  functionaries,  government-owned  and  -controlled \ncorporations  and  their  subsidiaries.  An  attached,  though  autonomous,  agency  is  the  Office  of \n\n                                                 \n1    Although  private  individuals  may  choose  to  resolve  disputes  among  themselves,  and  even  as  dispute  resolution \nmay  take  place  in  other  government  branches\u2013for  example,  certain  disputes  are  resolved  by  an  administrative \nbody  exercising  quasi-judicial  power  under  the  executive  branch\u2013the  judiciary  is  the  only  agency  that  has  the \npower to interpret the law when the law is unclear or susceptible to different interpretations, and protect rights and \nresolve disputes in accordance with their definitive interpretation of the law. Moreover, the judiciary exercises the \npower to review  the  decisions and actions  of any  government agency to determine if  they have been performed \n\u201cwith grave abuse and discretion\u201d or \u201cwith lack or in excess of jurisdiction.\u201d \n\n2    See  for  example  art.  vii  sec.  19  of  the  1987  Philippine  Constitution,  which  explicitly  gives  his  power  to  the    \nPresident,  subject  to  the  following  limitations:  (i)  it  cannot  be  exercised  in  impeachment  cases,  (ii)  it  can  be \nexercised only after conviction by final judgment, and (iii) the president may grant amnesty (granted to classes of \npersons guilty if political offenses) only with the concurrence of all Members of Congress. \n\n3    Other  measures  to  protect  judicial  independence  include  (i)  The  Constitution  prohibits  Legislature  from  depriving \nthe  Supreme  Court  of  jurisdiction  vested  by  the  Constitution  or  reorganizing  the  judiciary  so  as  to  determine  the \nsecurity if judicial tenure. (ii) Justices and judges hold office in good behavior until age 70 and their salaries may \nnot be decreased. \n\n \n\n\f58      Appendix 4 \n\n \n\n \n\nthe Solicitor General, which represents the Government in civil cases, and in criminal cases on \nappeal.  Being autonomous, it is not subject to the direction of the Secretary of Justice. \n \n4. \nThe  National  Prosecution  Service  (NPS),  which  is  in  charge  of  making  a  preliminary \ninvestigation of criminal complaints and the prosecution of alleged offenders, is an integral part \nof  DOJ  and  is  subject  to  the  direction  of  the  Secretary  of  DOJ.    It  is  headed  by  a  chief  state \nprosecutor  who  is  appointed  by  the  president.  Its  authorized  workforce  of  more  than  4,000 \npersonnel is divided almost equally between prosecutors and support personnel. Unfortunately, \nthere are a very large number of vacant positions in the civil service and salaries are too low to \nattract  applicants.  The  prosecution  of  corruption  cases  in  the  Sandiganbayan\u2014that  is,  those \ncases  brought  against  senior  public  officials--is  managed  by  the  Office  of  the  Ombudsman, \nwhich  is  an  office  provided  for  in  the  Constitution.  The  Office  of  the  Ombudsman,  through  its \nOffice of the Special Prosecutor, has exclusive responsibility for prosecuting corruption cases in \nthe Sandiganbayan. The Office of Ombudsman shares with the NPS the function of prosecuting \nlower  ranking  officials  before  the  regular  courts.  The  office  also  handles  administrative \ncomplaints against public officials. \n \nThe principal law enforcement agency is the Philippine National Police (PNP), a force of \n5. \nsome 125,000. The National Police Commission provides oversight for the PNP. However, the \nagency also needs to be responsive to local governments that have roles in police recruitment \nand  discipline,  and  provide  supplemental  resources.  Also,  the  PNP  is  often  called  on  to  carry \nout functions for other law enforcement agencies that have less of a national presence, such as \nthe  Philippine  Drug  Enforcement  Administration.  Administratively,  the  PNP  is  under  the \njurisdiction  of  the  Department  of  the  Interior  and  Local  Government  (DILG).  The  National \nBureau  of  Investigation  (NBI)  is  the  premier  investigative  law  enforcement  body,  with  about \n1,700 plainclothes investigators and related staff. The NBI is attached to DOJ. About 30 other \nnational  agencies  exercise  some \nlaw \nlaw  enforcement \nenforcement  agencies  is  carried  out  through  the  National  Law  Enforcement  Coordinating \nCouncil. \n \n6. \nThe Constitution provides that the Government has a duty not only to prosecute alleged \noffenders,  but  also  to  defend  indigent  persons  who  are  accused  of  committing  crimes.4  The \nPublic  Attorney\u2019s  Office  is  the  principal  organization  responsible  for  fulfilling  this  constitutional \nduty. In 2006 alone, the Public Attorney\u2019s Office provided  assistance to about 4.6 million poor \nclients in a range of criminal, civil, and administrative cases. The Public Attorney\u2019s Office is an \nattached agency to the DOJ for purposes of policy and program coordination, and, unlike NPS, \nis autonomous from DOJ. Autonomy was granted in 2007 in recognition of the Public Attorney\u2019s \nOffice\u2019s responsibility to act in criminal proceedings as the adversary of the NPS, which is under \nthe control of the DOJ Secretary. \n \n7.  \nThe criminal justice system includes the common practices of incarceration of individuals \ncharged  with  serious  offenses,  imprisonment  of  those  convicted,  and  programs  for  the \nrehabilitation of offenders and their reintegration into society.  Administration of correctional and \nrehabilitation facilities is fragmented, and is performed by several agencies. The Bureau of Jail \nManagement  and  Penology  (BJMP)  of  the  DILG  is  responsible  for  the  management  and \noperation of about 1,100 district, city, and municipal jails. These are facilities for the detention of \nthose against whom criminal charges are pending as well as those serving sentences of three \nyears or less. BJMP\u2019s 2007 authorized staffing pattern consists of almost 7,000 positions, more \nthan 98% of which are for uniformed personnel, and includes a prisoner-to-guard ratio of nine \n                                                 \n4    The  Constitution  guarantees  to  every  person  under  investigation  for  the  commission  of  an  offense  the  right  to \n\u201ccompetent  and  independent  counsel.\u201d  This  includes  the  right  of  a  person  who  cannot  afford  counsel  to  be \nprovided with one.  \n\nfunction.  Coordination  among \n\n \n\n\f         Appendix 4  \n\n  \n\n59\n\nprisoners to one guard. Prior to the BJMP\u2019s creation in 1991, the management of these facilities \nwas under the jurisdiction of the PNP. However, stagnant budgets and a growing jail population \nhave  impeded  the  transfer  of  functions  to  BJMP.  Therefore,  about  750  municipal  jails  remain \nunder  PNP  control.  The  Local  Government  Code  also  authorizes  provincial  governments  to \noperate jails for detainees awaiting trial and serving sentences of 3 years or less. There are 79 \nprovincial and 25 sub-provincial jails whose wardens are appointed by provincial governors and \nthat operate separately from the BJMP and PNP jails. \n \n8. \nThe Bureau of Corrections (BuCor), an integral part of the DOJ, operates seven national \npenitentiaries  for  the  incarceration  of  prisoners  serving  sentences  of  more  than  3  years.  The \nBureau also operates a juvenile training center, completed  in 2003, and a drug treatment and \nrehabilitation center created in 2002. As in the case of jails, the population of facilities operated \nby  BuCor  is  growing.  The  capacity  of  the  nation\u2019s  prisons  is  19,600,  but  occupancy  exceeds \n25,000.  BuCor  has  about  2,400  authorized  positions,  of  which  60%  are  in  custodial  roles,  a \nprisoner-to-guard ratio of 3.64 prisoners to one guard. Rounding out the set of corrections and \nrehabilitations  institutions  are  the  Board  of  Pardons  and  Parole  (BPP)  and  the  Parole  and \nProbation Administration (PPA), both integral units of DOJ. BPP recommends to the president \nthe grant of pardon and other forms of executive clemency, grants parole to qualified prisoners, \nand  authorizes  the  transfer  of  residence  of  parolees  and  pardonees,  orders  their  arrest  and \nrecommitment,  or  grants  their  final  release  and  discharge.  PPA  oversees  offenders  who  are \nlikely to respond to individualized and community-based treatment programs. Both agencies are \nunder the control and supervision of the DOJ Secretary. \n \n9. \nsettle civil disputes and the civil aspects of criminal cases:  \n\nAlternative dispute resolution mechanisms exist within and outside the judicial system to \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe barangay (village) justice system uses conciliation, mediation, and arbitration \nto  resolve  disputes  between  residents  of  the  same  municipal  unit.  Procedures \nare  informal,  under  the  direction  of  the  elected  barangay  chairman.  The  parties \nmay  not  be  represented  by  lawyers.  The  number  of  cases  handled  each  year \nunder  this  system  approaches  the  number  of  cases  decided  by  the  Philippine \ncourts.  The  settlement  rate  is  about  75%.  Disputes  eligible  for  consideration \nunder  the  barangay  justice  system  must  use  that  system  before  being  filed  in \ncourt. If the system does not resolve a dispute, a party  may take it to the court \nthat otherwise would have jurisdiction.  \nA  Supreme  Court-initiated  system  of  court-annexed  mediation  is  now  operating \nwith  731  courts  in  all  regions.  Since  the  institutionalization  of  court-annexed \nmediation  through  the  establishment  of  the  Philippine  Mediation  Center  (PMC) \nunder  the  Philippine  Judicial  Academy,  several  institutional  innovations  have \nbeen  introduced  such  as  appellate  court  mediation,  family  court  mediation, \nmobile  court-annexed  mediation  and  judicial  dispute  resolution.  With  these \nmediation  mechanisms  in  place,  the  number  of  mediated  cases  dramatically \nincreased from 3,559 in 2002 to 19,825 in 2007, with an average success rate of \n73% \nIndigenous populations in the Philippines (exceeding 12 million people) may use \ntheir  own  commonly-accepted  justice  systems  and  institutions,  so  long  as  they \nare  compatible  with  national  law  and  internationally-recognized  human  rights. \nThe  operation  of  customary  legal  systems  is  facilitated  by  the  National \nCommission  on  Indigenous  Peoples,  which  is  authorized  to  hear  appeals  from \ndecisions affecting indigenous populations.  \n\n(iv)  Mediation  and  arbitration  are  available  to  the  public  sector.  The  volume  of \ncommercial  mediation  and  arbitration  remains  quite  limited.  However,  a  new \nalternative dispute resolution law enacted in 2004 promises to invigorate the use \n\n \n\n\f60      Appendix 4 \n\n \n\n \n\nof these remedies. Implementing regulations have not yet been adopted to make \nthe new legal regime operational. The 2004 Alternative Dispute Resolution Law \nmandates  the  establishment  of  an  Alternative  Dispute  Resolution  Office  in  the \nDOJ to facilitate implementation of the law.  \n\n \nCivil  society  plays  a  key  role  in  justice  sector  reforms  in  the  Philippines,  are  regularly \n10. \nconsulted in the development and implementation of judicial and justice sector reform projects, \nand,  on  their  own  initiative,  monitor  the  performance  of  some  justice  sector  agencies.  Among \nthe  key  civil  society  stakeholders  is  the  Integrated  Bar  of  the  Philippines  (IBP).  All  40,000 \nattorneys in the country are compulsory members of the IBP. The IBP is a primary channel for \nthe discipline of attorneys, plays an active role in legal education, and provides legal assistance \nto  the  poor.  The  Supreme  Court  allocates  a  portion  of  its  budget  yearly  to  fund  legal  aid \nprograms  of  the  IBP.  Philippine  law  schools  are  also  important  stakeholders  of  the  justice \nsector. There are about 100 law schools, most of which are voluntary members of the Philippine \nAssociation of Law Schools. Some law schools operate legal clinics through which fourth year \nlaw students, supervised by licensed attorneys, represent indigent clients in court for free. Law \nprofessors,  who  are  often  concurrently  sitting  or  retired  judges,  are  frequently  called  upon  to \nprovide legal and policy advice concerning legal and justice sector reforms. Other stakeholders \ninclude  organizations  that  do  research,  monitor  the  operation  of  the  courts  and  government \nagencies,  take  public  positions  on  justice  policy  issues,  provide  information  to  the  public,  and \noffer legal services to the poor.5  \n \nB.  \n\nInitial Reforms \n\n \n11. \nThere  have  been  three  phases  of  reform  since  1986.  An  initial  phase  of  reform \nmeasures  during  the  period  following  the  February  1986  revolution  created  a  sound \nconstitutional  basis  for  an  effective  justice  system,  helped  to  restore  the  independence  of  the \njudiciary,  and  initiated  a  continuing  justice  reform  effort.  A  second  phase  of  reform  during  the \n1990s concentrated on strengthening the human and institutional capabilities that were required \nto respond to the increased workload and growing number of reforms in the judiciary and other \njustice  sector  agencies.  Two  key  examples  of  such  reforms  in  nonjudicial  justice  sector \nagencies were the Justice Sector Infrastructure Program that aimed to build court houses and \nfacilities for prosecutors and public defenders and the creation of the Public Attorney\u2019s Office. A \nthird phase was introduced during the Action Program for Judicial Reform 2001\u20132006 (APJR). \nThe  APJR  was  a  multi-year  plan  (2001\u20132006)  that  identified,  prioritized,  and  implemented \njudicial  reforms.  It  instituted  a  system  of  coordination  among  justice  organizations  and \ncommunication with stakeholders. Significant achievements include:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nimproved judicial efficiency demonstrated by an increase in the number of cases \ndisposed by courts;  \na  decreasing  number  of  vacant  judicial  positions  (due  to  the  passage  and \nimplementation  of  a  law  increasing  judicial  remuneration  by  100%,  which \nattracted competent candidates);  \nthe establishment of 113 court-annexed mediation centers nationwide (intended \nto facilitate access to justice); and \n\n                                                 \n5  Some notable examples of the foregoing include: the Alternative Law Groups (free legal assistance to vulnerable \nsectors,  paralegal  training,  legal  reform  advocacy);  the  Supreme  Court  Appointments  Watch  and  Court  Watch \n(monitoring judicial appointments and court performance); HLAF and Philippine Jesuit Prison Service (development \nof inmate record systems, free legal assistance to detainees, paralegal training, prison reform advocacy); and the \nGerry  Roxas  Foundation  (implementing  USAID-funded  support  for  the  barangay  justice  system,  capacity \ndevelopment of barangay justice advocates, paralegal training, mediation and community justice). \n\n \n\n\f         Appendix 4  \n\n  \n\n61\n\n(iv) \n\ndecentralization  of  court  administration  functions  (currently  exercised  by  the \nSupreme Court assisted by the Office of the Court Administrator in Manila) to a \npilot regional court administration office (intended to increase efficiency).   \n\n \n12. \n Although the APJR focused on the development of a reform action plan for the judiciary, \nthe  Supreme  Court  encouraged  the  participation  of  other  justice  sector  institutions  in \nconsultations and planning. The APJR proceeded on the assumption that the administration of \njustice  was  a  task  shared  by  the  judiciary  with  the  other  branches  of  government  and  other \npillars  of  the  criminal  justice  system\u2014the  prosecution  service,  police  and  law  enforcement, \ncorrections,  public  defense,  and  the  community.  Without  reforms  taking  place  in  other  justice \nsector  agencies,  judicial  reforms  risked  being  less  successful  than  expected.6  The  APJR \nproduced  a  series  of  diagnostic  studies  that  provided  the  basis  for  policy  reforms  in  the \nDepartment  of  Justice,  the  Office  of  the  Ombudsman,  the  Public  Attorney\u2019s  Office,  and  the \nPhilippine corrections system. Subsequently, the DOJ created a Management Systems Office to \ncoordinate  its  reform  program.  The  Office  of  the  Ombudsman  adopted  a  Medium  Term  Anti-\nCorruption  Program.  The  PNP  launched  its  own  reform  program.  The  Public  Attorney\u2019s  Office \nsuccessfully  lobbied  for  a  law  that  implemented  the  recommendations  of  an  APJR  study  on \nincreasing  the  Public  Attorney\u2019s  Office\u2019s  autonomy.  These  studies  provided  the  opportunity  in \nbuilding the road map for reform of these institutions.7 \n \n13. \nThe APJR, which ended in 2006, appears to have contributed to improving the Supreme \nCourt\u2019s credibility. In 2007, the Social Weather Station survey of enterprises on corruption noted \nan increase in survey respondents who found the Supreme Court sincere in fighting corruption \nwas a net 40% in 2006 to a net 46% in 2007. \n \nUpon his assumption into office in 2006, Chief Justice Reynato Puno announced three \n14. \nbroad  priority  areas  for  the  judiciary:  (i)  the  speedy  and  efficient  resolution  of  court  cases, \nincluding  administrative  cases  against  judges,  lawyers,  and  court  personnel;  (ii)  improving  the \nintegrity  of  the  court;  and  (iii)  access  to  justice.  Under  his  leadership,  the  Supreme  Court  has \ncontinued,  with  strong  support,  APJR-initiated  reforms  falling  into  the  three  areas  described \nabove.  As  an  example,  the  Supreme  Court  has  pursued  decentralization  of  the  administrative \nand financial management functions to regional court administration offices (expected to speed \nup  overall  court  efficiency,  integrity  and  oversight)  and  designated  22  small  claims  courts \nemploying judicial dispute mediation and expanding the Justice on Wheels Program (to improve \naccess  to  justice)\u2014all  of  which  were  begun  during  the  APJR.  This  demonstrates  a  deliberate \nstrategy  to  focus  on  APJR  reforms  that  are  expected  to  achieve  results  in  areas  that  would \nimprove perceptions of court performance and integrity, and increase access to justice.  \n \n15.  \nThe  chief  justice  has  also  demonstrated  concern  for  and  an  understanding  of  the \njudiciary\u2019s  resource  constraints,  as  well  as  an  interest  in  financial  management  reforms  that \nwould facilitate the judiciary\u2019s capability to plan and demonstrate reasonable budget proposals, \nand  assert  fiscal  autonomy  (discussed  in  the  section  on  Sector  Issues  below)  during  budget \nexecution. For example, upon being informed that commitment to the Organization Performance \nIndicator Framework (OPIF) would enable the judiciary to plan and explain its budget proposals \nto  the  executive,  which  proposes  the  budget  to  the  legislature,  the  chief  justice  expressed \ncommitment  to  the  OPIF  and  the  Supreme  Court  has  submitted  in  2008  documents  that \ndemonstrate such commitment.   \n \n\n                                                 \n6  See Supreme Court APJR website for more details: http://apjr.supremecourt.gov.ph/ \n7    Hard  copies  of  the  DOJ  and  PNP  reform  agenda,  as  well  as  the  Medium-Term  Action  Plan  of  the  Officer  of  the \n\nOmbudsman, are available upon request. \n\n \n\n\f62      Appendix 4 \n\n \n\n \n\nSector Issues and Assessment of Performance \n\n16. \n Although the chief justice appears to have focused on reforms that have a direct impact \non  the  judiciary,  he  has  not  abandoned  interest  in  coordinating  justice  reforms.  Since  his \nappointment,  he  has  hosted  two  multisectoral  summits,  both  of  which  have  been  lauded  for \ndemonstrating  justice  sector  leadership:  the  Summit  on  Extra-judicial  Killings,  which  brought \ntogether criminal justice sector agencies to discuss ways by which the extra-judicial killings may \nbe  halted;  and  the  Summit  on  Increasing  Access  to  Justice,  which  served  both  as  a \nmultisectoral consultative forum and venue for justice sector agencies to discuss possible ways \nby which they could coordinate efforts to bring access to justice. One example of a collaboration \nresulting  from  the  latter  is  that  the  City  of  Manila  and  the  Supreme  Court  launched  a  mobile \ncourt unit near the Manila City Jail a month after the Summit. The mobile unit was intended to \nspeed up hearings of detainees at the Manila City Jail. \n \nC.  \n \n17. \nJudicial  Independence  and  the  Justice  Sector.  An  independent  judiciary  is  a  key \nfeature of an efficient justice sector. The Beijing Statement of Principles of the Independence \nof  the  Judiciary  in  the  Asia  Region,  an  international  document  signed  by  32  chief  justices \njudicial \nfrom \nindependence  in  terms  of  a  judiciary  deciding  matters  impartially  \u201cwithout  improper \ninfluences,  direct  or  indirect,  from  any  source.\u201d  The  Beijing  statement  represents  a \nremarkable  consensus  within  the  region  of  the  minimum  standards  that  need  to  be  complied \nwith in order to maintain the independence and effective function of the judiciary. It identifies \nthe  rule  of  law  to  be  the  aim  and  object  of  every  justice  system\u2014otherwise,  legal  power \nbecomes  an  instrument  of  oppression  and  corruption.  The  following  are  identified  in  the \nBeijing statement as features of judicial independence:  \n \n\nthe  Philippines,  defines \n\nthroughout  Asia  and \n\nthe  Pacific, \n\nincluding \n\nthe appointment of competent, incorruptible, and independent judges without \ndiscrimination or undue influence;  \nthe  security  of  tenure  of  judges,  with  removal  only  for  incapacity  or \ninappropriate conduct as determined  by an independent tribunal;  \njudicial  remuneration  at  an  appropriate  level,  and  guaranteed  for  the  term  of  a \njudge\u2019s appointment;  \na  guaranteed  jurisdiction  for  a  judge  that  cannot  be  altered  except  with  the \nconsent of the members of the court; \njudicial  administration  controlled  by  the  court,  especially  in  relation  to  the \nallocation of cases;  \na relationship with the executive that is free of pressure upon the judiciary; and \nadequate resources for the courts. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n(vii) \n \n\n18. \nThe  Philippines\u2019  colonial  history  and  its  experience  with  martial  law  contributed  to  a \nstrong tradition of judicial independence. After the 1986 EDSA Revolution, the 1987 Philippine \nConstitution  expanded  court  jurisdiction  to  include  the  power  to  review  Government  actions, \nincluding  actions  of  the  executive  and  legislative  branches,  and  provided  several  measures \ndemonstrating  most  of  the  features  of  judicial  independence  enumerated  in  the  Beijing \nstatement.  \n \n19. \nJudicial  Fiscal  Autonomy.  A  key  provision  of  the  judiciary\u2019s  fiscal  autonomy  is  the \nautomatic and regular release of the court\u2019s budget after it has been approved by legislature.8 \nThe same constitutional provision also states that the judiciary\u2019s budget may not be reduced by \n\n                                                 \n8 Article VIII, Section 3 of the Philippine Constitution; CSC v. DBM, G.R. No. 158791, 10 February 2006. \n\n \n\n\f         Appendix 4  \n\n  \n\n63\n\nCongress  below  the  amount  appropriated  for  the  previous  year.9      Fiscal  autonomy  aims  to \nsafeguard  the  last  feature  of  judicial  independence  under  the  Beijing  statement\u2014that  of \nensuring  the  provision  of  adequate  resources  for  the  judiciary.    However,  despite  the \nconstitutional  grant  of  fiscal  autonomy,  the  Supreme  Court  has  been  hampered  by  effective \nexecutive  control  of  the  budgetary  purse  strings.  In  the  course  of  preparing  the  National \nExpenditure Program, DBM reviews the budget proposals of the judiciary10 on a line-item basis \nand decides which items may or may not be included in the national budget.11  After Congress \nappropriates  the  budget,  DBM  allots  the  judiciary\u2019s  budget  in  one  lump  sum.  However,  in  the \npast,  cash  disbursements  have  been  released  on  a  transaction  basis.  As  with  executive \ndepartments under the supervision and control of the president, the judiciary is also subjected to \ncash availability timing issues.  \n \n20. \nFiscal Management to Strengthen Judicial Fiscal Autonomy. Arguably, the resource \nconstraints  faced  by  the  Government  limit  the  judiciary\u2019s  fiscal  autonomy,  in  that  the \nGovernment\u2019s  fiscal  position  determines  how  much  it  can  allot  to  the  judiciary  and  other \ngovernment  agencies  at  any  given  time.  However,  it  is  also  true  that  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal \nmanagement  capabilities\u2014particularly  in  budget  planning\u2014can  play  an  important  role  in \nstrengthening fiscal autonomy, notwithstanding government budget constraints. As an example, \nDBM  schedules  its  disbursement  of  cash  allocations  quarterly  in  accordance  with  the \noperational  cash  program  submitted  by  government  agencies.  Ideally,  a  well  planned \noperational  cash  program  would  allow  DBM  to  plan  for  the  disbursement  of  cash  to  priority \nagencies\u2014e.g.    fiscally  autonomous  agencies  such  as  the  judiciary\u2014without  referring  to  the \nGovernment\u2019s  fiscal  position  or  reviewing  the  agencies\u2019  expenditures  as  a  precondition  to \nreleasing cash allocations. However, weak fiscal management capabilities and human resource \nconstraints in the Supreme Court result in the preparation of operational cash programs that do \nnot  reflect  the  actual  cash  requirements  of  the  Supreme  Court  each  quarter.  This  makes  it \nimpossible for DBM to program a realistic schedule of cash disbursements for the judiciary and \nother fiscally autonomous agencies, especially when the Government\u2019s fiscal position is weak.  \n \n Weak  Financial  Management  Capabilities  in  the  Justice  Sector.  Weak  budget \n21. \nplanning and monitoring capabilities afflicts all justice sector agencies, and this prevents them \nfrom  justifying  requests  and  ultimately  obtaining  the  resources  that  they  need.  As  budget \nplanning is done at the central office of justice sector agencies, field offices and court stations \nhave  even  weaker  financial  management  capabilities.  These  inherent  weaknesses,  together \nwith the absence of resources in justice sector agencies to exercise stronger oversight functions \nconcerning  their  field  offices  and  the  dearth  of  transparent  procedures  and  accountability \nmechanisms  with  respect  to  the  agencies\u2019  use  of  public  funds,  all  contribute  to  the  perception \nthat  the  agencies  are  susceptible  to  corruption.  It  also  contributes  to  the  reluctance  of  the \noversight agency, DBM, to allow agencies greater flexibility and control over their resources.   \n \n22. \nJustice  sector  agencies  under  the  executive  branch\u2014DOJ  and  its  attached  agencies \n(e.g., BuCor); the PNP, National Police Commission, and the BJMP, which is under the DILG \u2014\nhave  adopted  the  OPIF,  a  public  expenditure  management  reform  that  directs  resources \ntowards  results  and  accounts  for  performance.    The  leadership  of  the  judiciary  also  issued  a \nstatement early in the year on the judiciary\u2019s commitment to use the OPIF in budget preparation, \nfiscal management, and planning.12  In addition, to showcase the judiciary\u2019s commitment to the \n\n                                                 \n9  Article VIII, Section 3 of the Philippine Constitution.  \n10 These are the Commission on Elections, the Commission on Audit and the Civil Service Commission. \n11 It will be noted that both the President and the Chief Justice have the statutory authority to realign resources and   \n\naugment items within the budget of their government branch but only if the budget items exist in the first place. \n\n12  In  2007,  the  CTA,  Sandiganbayan,  and  CA  began  work  on  their  OPIF-compliant  budgets,  which  included  the \n\nsubmission of a logical framework in their budget submissions.  \n\n \n\n\f64      Appendix 4 \n\n \n\n \n\nOPIF,  a  regional  court  administration  office  (RCAO)  being  piloted  by  the  Supreme  Court  in \nRegion  7  prepared  its  proposed  2009  budget  following  the  OPIF  template  and  principles.  It  is \nexpected  that  adoption  of  the  OPIF  across  the  justice  sector  will  result  in  better  internal \ngovernance arrangements and systems to capture performance data; and provide agencies with \ngreater flexibility and control over their internal resource deployment.13 If done across all sector \nagencies,  it  is  expected  to  provide  a  comprehensive,  precise,  and  unified  articulation  of \naccountability  in  the  use  of  public  resources  by  justice  sector  agencies  to  the  public  and \ncitizenry.  \n \nIt should be noted, however, that the adoption of the OPIF is not a rapid process and will \n23. \nrequire  significant  strengthening  of  justice  sector  agencies\u2019  financial  management  systems. \nAgencies in the justice sector need to set their own performance indicators and strategize the \nbest  ways  to  reach  these  indicators.  Measuring  the  efficient  and  effective  delivery  of  justice \nrequires  qualitative,  and  not  only  quantitative,  measures.  For  example,  the  quality  and \nlegitimacy  of  judicial  decisions  may  be  as  important,  if  not  more  important,  as  the  number  of \ndecisions  issued  by  a  court.  The  development  of  benchmarks  and  reasonable  indicators  is  a \nchallenge  for  many  agencies,  which  have  never  engaged  before  in  similar  exercises.  Some \nagencies, such as the DOJ, which have adopted performance indicators, realize that they do not \nhave  the  capability  or  resources  to  monitor  and  collect  data  from  their  field  offices  (in  DOJ\u2019s \ncase, data from field prosecutors\u2019 offices) to determine whether or not they have reached their \ntargets.  \n \n24. \nCentralized  financial  and  administrative  management  have  also  contributed  to  delays \nand  inefficient  performance.  For  example,  requests  to  undertake  repairs  on  court  houses  and \njustice  sector  buildings,  replace  equipment,  and  pay  utility  bills,  need  to  be  submitted  to  and \nprocessed by the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) in Manila before the required action \ncan  be  performed  by  lower  courts.  Both  the  judiciary  and  nonjudicial  justice  sector  agencies \nsuffer from a lack of sufficient telecommunications and information technology infrastructure or \nequipment connecting most courts stations or field offices outside of the national capital region \nto  the  relevant  central  office.  Thus,  requests  are  not  processed  quickly.  This  results  in  long \ndelays in payment and the suspension of key services performed by court staff. To address the \nadditional  constraints  resulting  from  a  centralized  financial  and  administrative  system,  the \nSupreme Court has piloted an RCAO to perform financial and administrative functions (including \nbudget  planning,  physical  assets,  and  human  resource  management)  relating  to  the  lower \ncourts in three provinces in Region 7.  The RCAO was launched by Chief Justice Reynato Puno \nin May 2008 and commenced operations in July 2009.  \n \nResource  Constraints.  Although  the  nominal  level  of  the  court\u2019s  budget  can  be \n25. \nprotected  by  the  Constitution,  the  increases  are  not  high  enough  to  protect  against  inflation. \nAlthough there have been annual increases in the judiciary\u2019s obligation budget, its value in real \nterms and its share of the national expenditure program has decreased. While there was a slight \nrecovery  in  real  term  budgetary  allocation  in  2007,  it  is  not  enough  to  meet  the  increasing \ndemands of the courts workload. In fact, the budget allocation of the judiciary in 2007 can buy \nabout  5%  less  goods  and  services  when  compared  to  its  budget  in  2000.  With  national \ngovernment budgetary resources inadequate, the courts must turn to other sources of financing \nfor their operations. Nonjudicial agencies suffer the same budgetary constraints as the judiciary. \nIn general, while annual budgetary allocations increase in nominal terms, the real value of the \nbudgetary allocation has decreased. Over the period 2000 to 2007, total budget in real terms for \nnonjudicial agencies  may  have  dropped  by  5%,  with  the  DOJ  experiencing  a  larger  decline  of \nabout 15%.  \n\n                                                 \n13 See Organizational Performance Indicator Framework FY2007, DBM (August 2006). \n\n \n\n\f         Appendix 4  \n\n  \n\n65\n\n \n26.  While  there  may  have  been  extenuating  reasons  for  these  budgetary  restrictions,  the \ninefficiencies created and the damage done to the reputation of the justice sector agencies now \nrequires  that  cooperative  approaches  be  found  to  reverse  these  resource  constraints.  At  the \nsame time, when the focus is on these justice sector agencies for failing to achieve a rule of law \nthat  is  believed  satisfactory  to  the  public  and  the  business  community  in  the  Philippines,  the \nbudgetary restrictions on these agencies needs to be addressed within the context of achieving \nreal gains in the rule of law with the additional public resources allocated to this sector.   \n \nThe  impact  of  the  budgetary  compression  led  justice  sector  agencies  to  prioritize \n27. \nrecurrent  expenses  (primarily  personnel).  The  result  is  that  more  than  80%  of  the  budgets  of \njustice  sector  agencies\u2019  goes  to  salaries,  leaving  less  than  15%  for  maintenance  and  other \noperational  expenses,  and  less  than  3%  for  capital  investment  (e.g.,  new  facilities  and \nequipment).  This  deviates  from  the  profile  of  the  national  government  budget,  which  devotes \n32% to expenses for personnel services and around 58% to maintenance and other operational \nexpenses.  In  the  justice  sector  agencies  there  is  a  double  squeeze  on  infrastructure,  utilities, \nand  supplies,  which  adds  further  pressure  on  their  operations.  Budget  constraints  have  also \nresulted  in  low  salaries  that  couple  with  antiquated  equipment  and  infrastructure  to  create \nvacancies  in  staff  positions  and  disincentives  for  efficient  performance.  As  an  example,  there \nwere  463  vacancies  in  the  judiciary  at  the  end  of  2007,  equivalent  to  20%  of  the  authorized \npositions.14  These  vacancies  have  contributed  to  a  backlog  of  cases  that  at  the  end  of  2007 \namounted to about 700,000 cases in all levels of the courts, with more than half in the regional \ntrial  courts.  The  congestion  of  case  dockets  is  central  to  a  multitude  of  problems,  either  as  a \ncause or as an effect. In the NPS, at the end of 2007, only 1,500 out of 2,100 positions were \nfilled. \n \n28. \n Resource  constraints  also  make  justice  sector  institutions,  particularly  the  judiciary, \nprosecution service, and law enforcement, susceptible to the influence of local government units \n(LGUs). Under the Local Government Code, LGUs may provide contributions to these agencies. \nMany LGUs contribute resources to lower courts, judges, and prosecutors within their territory. \nThese contributions are not recorded in the financial accounting records of the agencies\u2019 central \noffices. These schemes run the risk of undermining the independence of courts and the integrity \nof other justice sector agencies receiving such contributions, a risk that is further heightened by \nthe absence of oversight capabilities in the central offices. \n \n29. \n Justice  Delayed.  A  major  and  persistent  challenge  to  the  justice  system  is  the \npersistent  perception  of  delay  in  the  delivery  of  justice.  The  Constitution  and  law  impose  time \nlimits on the judiciary, but generally have no counterpart provisions for other agencies involved \nin the administration of justice, particularly in phases where the likelihood of delay occurring is \nstrong\u2014during  the  police  investigation,  preliminary  investigation  stages,  as  well  as  during  the \nenforcement  of  judgments.  Thus,  even  if  it  were  assumed  that  the  courts  kept  well  within  the \ntime  limits  imposed  by  the  Constitution  and  the  law,  the  perception  of  delay  in  the  delivery  of \njustice  would  continue  to  exist  if  accused  individuals  were  detained  for  long  periods  in  police \nfacilities or in district prisons while waiting for a complaint to be filed in court. The interrelated \nnature of justice sector agencies\u2019 operations requires that delay be decreased and prevented in \nall investigation, dispute resolution, and enforcement.  \n \n30. \nUntil  recently,  total  caseloads  were  increasing  each  year  as  the  volume  of  cases \nentering  the  system  was  higher  than  the  volume  of  cases  leaving  the  system.  That  is,  the \n                                                 \n14 Of the total vacancies of 463 at end of 2007, over 100 was due to the lack of applicants for those positions, mainly \nrelating  to  the  lack  of  interest  in  potential  applicants  serving  in  rural  and  remote  locations  with  the  inadequate \ninfrastructure and the uniformly low salaries being offered. \n\n \n\n\f66      Appendix 4 \n\n \n\n \n\ndisposition rate was negative. More recently, caseloads have declined slightly because inflows \nhave  diminished  and  the  courts  are  disposing  of  more  cases  than  are  being  filed  each  year. \nHowever, the total number of cases disposed of has been declining despite the increase in the \nnumber of available judges as vacancies have been filled. The improved disposition rate has not \nresulted in significant improvement in the clearance rate, the volume of cases disposed of as a \npercentage of total caseload, and the low clearance rate means that backlogs remain high.  \n \n\nTable A4: Summary Of Caseload, Disposition, And Clearance Rates,  \n2004\u20132006 \n\nINFLOW \n\nCASELOAD \n\nOUTFLOW \n\n \n\n \nYEAR \n\nPENDING \nON 1 JAN \n751,579 \n738,325 \n709,495 \n\n2004 \n2005 \n2006 \nSource: Office of the Court Administrator, Supreme Court \nNote:  Excludes Supreme Court. \n\n1,229,598 \n1,188,058 \n1,124,260 \n\n478,019 \n449,733 \n414,765 \n\n491,273 \n478,563 \n445,483 \n\nPENDING ON \n31 DEC \n\nDISPOSITION \nRATE (%) \n\nCLEARANCE \nRATE (%) \n\n738,325 \n709,495 \n678,777 \n\n102.77 \n106.41 \n107.41 \n\n39.95 \n40.28 \n39.62 \n\n \n31. \nImprovements in the disposition rate correlate with a number of reforms initiated under \nthe APJR to increase court efficiency, including the pilot use of a caseflow management system \nin  Pasay  City  Courts,  and  pilot  court-annexed  mediation  and  judicial  dispute  resolution  at  any \nstage of litigation. In addition, improvements in disposition rate also correlate with a decreasing \nvacancy in judicial positions, a development brought about by an increase in the compensation \nof  judges  by  100%  through  the  grant  of  allowances  funded  by  court  fees.  Further  reforms  to \nincrease judicial efficiency include the establishment of case management information systems \nin the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, Sandiganbayan, and Court of Tax Appeals with USAID \nsupport.  \n \n32. \nOne  reason  contributing  to  the  fact  that  backlogs  in  the  disposition  of  criminal  cases \nremain  high  notwithstanding  the  above-mentioned  reforms  is  that  judicial  performance  is \naffected  by  the  performance  of  other  justice  sector  agencies.  Delays  in  criminal  court \nproceedings have reportedly been caused in part by the nonappearance of witnesses, absence \nof prosecutors and public defenders during trial, the dearth of prosecutors and public defenders \n(who reportedly apply for judge positions, as the overall compensation of judges have increased \nsubstantially),  and  law  enforcement  officers\u2019  delay  in  turning  over  evidence  to  the  courts. \nAnother  recognized  cause  of  delay  in  the  criminal  justice  arena  is  the  lengthy  and  complex \nprocedures  of  the  NPS  for  the  determination  of  probable  cause.  To  address  this,  NPS  has \ncompleted  a  review  of  its  business  processes  and  is  working  on  a  prosecution  case \nmanagement  system  to  enable  NPS  to  track  probable  cause  cases  being  resolved  by  its \nprosecutors. \n \n33.  Access to Justice.  Access to justice is most commonly associated with access to the \ncourts  and  the  provision  of  legal  counsel  to  those  who  cannot  afford  one.  The  Constitution \nmakes it the Government\u2019s duty to assure citizens free access to the courts and adequate legal \nassistance  that  \u201cshall  not  be  denied  to  any  person  by  reason  of  poverty.\u201d15  If  a  member  of  a \npoor family in the Philippines were accused of a crime, the family would likely be unable to pay \nfor  legal  fees,  even  if  the  counsel  for  the  accused  provided  his  or  her  services  for  free.  The \nFree Legal Assistance Group, a non-government lawyers\u2019 organization that provides free legal \nassistance, estimated that the typical cost of a criminal case that is handled pro bono could be \nas high as P70, 300, which \u201crepresents the subsistence budget for an entire Filipino family of \nsix  for  an  entire  year,\u201d  and  is  three  times  more  than  the  average  annual  savings  of  a  Filipino \n\n                                                 \n15  Const. art. III, sec. 14. \n\n \n\n\f         Appendix 4  \n\n  \n\n67\n\nfamily  based  on  official  government  statistics.16  In  addition,  the  poor  would  have  difficulty  in \nposting bail for temporary freedom pending trial, providing travel costs for witnesses to attend \ntrial hearings, or complying with documentary requirements. The costs are higher if free legal \nassistance is not provided. Private legal practitioners are said to charge an acceptance fee at \nthe start of their engagement and an appearance fee for attending hearings. Acceptance fees \nare usually above P10, 000, while appearance fees amounted to P1, 000.17 \n \n34. \nThe Supreme Court has tried to operationalize the constitutional provision to provide free \naccess to the courts by issuing a rule that exempts the poor from paying docket and other fees, \nincluding fees for the transcript of court proceedings kept by the court stenographer.18 Under the \nAPJR,  a  Justice  on  Wheels  program  was  established.  Three  mobile  courts  were  deployed  to \nbring court stations to remote areas and detention facilities far from court stations. Under Chief \nJustice  Reynato  Puno\u2019s  leadership,  a  multisectoral  summit  on  increasing  access  to  justice  by \nthe  poor  was  held  to  enable  the  Supreme  Court  to  consider  reforms  that  would  effectively \nincrease  access  to  the  courts.  As  regards  the  constitutional  mandate  to  provide  the  poor  with \nadequate  legal  counsel,  the  Supreme  Court  provides  relevant  protections  to  the  rights  of  the \naccused and providing free legal counsel to the poor in the Rules of Court.19 It has also adopted, \nas  part  of  the  Code  of  Professional  Responsibility  of  Lawyers,  the  rule  that  lawyers  cannot  (i) \nreject the case of the defenseless or the oppressed; (ii) refuse to serve the needy; (iii) decline \nan appointment as counsel de officio or a request from the IBP Philippines to render free legal \naid.20  \n \n35. \nThe Public Attorney\u2019s Office, an autonomous office of public defenders whose services \nindigents  may  access  for  free,  was  created  to  fulfill  the  constitutional  mandate  to  the \nGovernment  to  provide  adequate  legal  counsel  for  the  poor.    Private  sector  efforts  that  are \nintended to increase indigents\u2019 access to courts include free legal services offered by the) IBP \nand  law  school-based  legal  aid  clinics,  where  senior  law  students  supervised  by  qualified \nattorneys appear before courts to represent indigent clients. \n \nAccess  to  justice  in  the  Philippine  context  means  more  than  free  legal  assistance  or \n36. \ncourt-related  assistance  for  the  poor.  The  Constitution  also  promotes  the  rights  of  what  are \nperceived to be the most vulnerable sectors in Philippine society and accords a high priority to \nsocial justice, guarantees full respect for human rights, and ensures the fundamental equality of \nwomen  and  men.  It  is  replete  with  policies  favoring  labor,  and  recognizes  the  rights  of \nindigenous cultural communities within the framework of national unity and development. In this \ncontext, access to justice refers to defending, or promoting, the rights of the groups identified in \nthe Constitution as being in need of special protection\u2014women, children, indigenous peoples, \nlabor,  and  the  urban  poor.21  The  constitutional  mandate  \u201cdoes  not  require  a  judge  to  exhibit \nsensitivity to parties of a case at the expense of impartiality. Rather, it merely requires a judge to \nprovide  special  protection  for  those  particularly  identified  in  the  Constitution  as  marginalized,\u201d \nand  the  challenge  is  how  the  judiciary  can  apply  \u201cthis\u2026legal  framework  to  concrete  cases \ninvolving vulnerable sectors with predictability and consistency.\u201d22  \n\n                                                 \n16      Lawyers\u2019  League  for  Liberty.  2004.

Access to justice by detained prisoners is currently a major problem \nin the Philippines. The number of detainees in BJMP-managed jails has increased considerably \nin recent years. From about 35,000 in 2000, the number of detainees grew to exceed 62,000 in \n2006. About 10% are women and 2% are minors. Metro Manila jails reportedly hold 400 times \nmore prisoners than their official capacity. A rehabilitation center in Cebu that was built for 400 \nwas crammed with 2,600 detainees until recently.  Over 95% of persons in BJMP-managed jails \nare  detainees  whose  cases  are  still  being  tried  and  are  not  yet  sentenced.  Often  detainees \nserve more time awaiting their trial than they would have for a conviction if their cases had been \npromptly processed following their arrest. \n \n38. \nAn inmate record system has been set up in pilot jails managed by the BJMP to  more \neffectively monitor the inflow and outflow of detainees awaiting trial. The judiciary is deploying \nthree  Justice  on  Wheels  buses  to  jails  and  detention  centers  to  expedite  the  release  of \ndetainees  when  warranted.  It  is  expected  that  this  problem  of  detainees  can  be  reduced  over \nthe medium term involving a set of focused actions coordinated with BuCor, BJMP, DOJ, DILG \nand  the  Supreme  Court,  in  coordination  with  non-government  organizations  and  development \npartners. The actions will include enhancements of BJMP\u2019s pilot inmate record systems and the \ndevelopment of a rollout plan. Detainees who have stayed beyond the incarceration period that \nwould  have  been  meted,  had  they  been  convicted  of  the  crime,  would  be  set  free,  thereby \ndecongesting overcrowded city and municipal jails. With the support of civil society and legal aid \ngroups,  such  actions  can  be  implemented  and  monitored.  Coordinating  these  actions  with  the \nSupreme  Court\u2019s  Justice  on  Wheels  Program  will  put  in  place  a  comprehensive  jail \ndecongestion program.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n69 \n\nSoutheast Asia \nDepartment/ \nGovernance, \nFinance, and Trade \nDivision \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nCountry/Project Title: Philippines/Governance in Justice Sector Reform Program \n\nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\nProgram Cluster \n\n \n\n \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n\n \nThe  Millennium  Declaration  signed  by  189  heads  of  state  in  1995  affirmed  the  global  commitment  to  a  \u201cmore  peaceful, \nprosperous and just world\u201d. The declaration sets forth the six values underpinning this commitment including freedom of fear \nfrom  injustice,  equality  of  men  and  women\u2019s  rights,  solidarity,  tolerance  of  diversity,  respect  for  nature,  and  shared \nresponsibility.  The  core  values  are  translated  into  action  through  the  Millennium  Development  Goals.    The  program  cluster \ndirectly addresses freedom from fear and equality.   \n \nThe  program  cluster  is  aligned  with  the  MTPDP  strategy  and  objective  on  social  justice  and  basic  needs.  The  MTPDP \nrecognized  the  important  link  between  rule  of  law  and  institutional  reforms,  and  the  strategy  to  fight  poverty  and  promote \ninclusive  growth.  ADB  strategy  has  identified  the  strengthening  of  Philippine  institutions  engaged  in  the  administration  of \njustice  as critical to improving the investment climate  and  promoting inclusive growth. In this regard, the proposed program \ncluster will help create efficient and effective delivery of justice services to the public on a non-differentiated basis. Its focus on \naccess  to  justice  by  the  poor  and  women  helps  protect  their  access  to  social  and  other  assets  that  will  help  them  create \nsustainable livelihoods, an important step towards reducing poverty, as was determined under the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) poverty assessment for the Philippines. \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nThe Philippine Governance in Justice Sector Reform Program is a general-intervention (GI) project that seeks to shorten the \ntime  and  lower  the  cost  of  gaining  justice  for  all,  and  to  improve  the  capacity  of  the  judiciary  and  key  justice  agencies  to \nrespond  to  complaints,  particularly  those  related  to  violence  against  women  and  children,  as  well  as  gender-based \ndiscrimination.    The  direct  beneficiaries  of  the  project  are  all  users  of  justice  services  through  improved  governance  of  the \njustice system. Both poor and non-poor people will be able to access improved justice sector services.  The poor and women \nwill disproportionally benefit from the program because they are the least able to afford or wait for justice.   \n \n \n\nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis  \n\n \nThe  Governance  in  Justice  Sector  Reform  Cluster  Program  has  five  components  or  policy  action  areas:  (i)  strengthened \njudicial  fiscal  autonomy  and  justice  sector  accountability,  and  improved  access  to  resources;  (ii)  enhanced  justice  sector \nintegrity; (iii) improved efficiency in the justice sector; (iv) increased access to justice by poor and vulnerable groups; and (v) \nexpanded delivery of justice through alternative dispute resolution.  \n \nA  participatory  poverty  impact  assessment  was  conducted  through  separate  interviews  and  focus  group  discussions  in  the \nprogram\u2019s  pilot  site  for  the  Regional  Court  Administrator\u2019s  Office,  Cebu  City.    The  barriers  to  justice  for  the  poor  include \ncumbersome procedures for small claims; the impact of long litigation times on livelihoods and income generation; for those in \njail awaiting trial, court congestion results in additional financial burden on poor families; the actual cost of court litigation is \nbeyond the capacity of poor families; and underserved areas increase transport costs bring the overall cost of justice beyond \nthe ability of to pay of the poor. Non-financial barriers include inadequate understanding of basic legal rights and procedures, \nand the belief that judges will always side with the non-poor.  Poor gender sensitivity among judges, Supreme Court lawyers, \nclerks,  and  legal  researchers  disadvantage  women.  Insensitive  treatment  of  plaintiffs  in  crimes  specific  to  women  and \nchildren, such as violence against women and children, and sexual harassment, remains a significant issue.  \n \nPolicy action area 1 has a positive indirect and medium term impact on the poor. Improved access to resources will enable \nmodernization of the court system, higher salaries necessary to draw and maintain justice system positions  with competent \nstaff,  and  the  increased  independence  and  improved  governance  of  the  justice  system.  This  will  promote  an  efficient  and \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f70 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \neffective  court  system  and  reduce  the  time  and  expense  of  litigation,  thereby  increasing  affordability.    Increased  judicial \nbudgets operation will reduce the reliance on litigant fees and charges, which is a pro-poor measure since the poor currently \nbear  a  disproportionate  cost  of  general  operations  relative  to  their  income.  Policy  action  area  2  increases  the  pro-poor \nreputation of the system currently seen as favoring those with the ability to pay. In the medium term, demonstrated fairness \nwill encourage the poor to seek remedy through the legal system. Even for those not involved in litigation, the knowledge of a \nfair  system  will  increase  their  sense  of  security  and  well  being.  Policy  area  3  supports  efficiency  in  the  justice  sector  and \ndecongests the courts and jails. This has an indirect measure with very positive impact on litigants, particularly the poor as the \naverage  litigation  time  in  lower  courts  is  3\u20134  years.  The  incarcerated,  generally  the  poor  who  are  unable  to  raise  bail, \nexperience highly adverse impacts on their family in monetary and psychological terms. The psychological impact, although \ndifficult to quantify, can result in the break-up of the family with severe emotional consequences for the children. For the 10% \nwho  are  eventually  sentenced,  time  spent  waiting  trial  often  exceeds  the  jail  term  meted.    For  the  remaining  90%,  no \nrestitution  is  available.    Policy  area  4  has  medium-term  direct  and  indirect  benefits  for  the  poor  and  women.  The  direct \nbenefits  arise  from  implementation  of  the  gender  action  plan  to  improve  women\u2019s  access  to  justice  in  general  and  the \nsensitive  handling  of  issues  specific  to  women  such  as  violence  and  sexual  harassment.    The  indirect  actions  include  the \nsimplification of small claims enabling the faster and lower cost resolution of civil cases. Policy area 5 expands the delivery of \njustice through alternative dispute resolution and provides lower cost measures for resolving civil cases. The court-annexed \nmediation  system  provides  access  to  trained  mediators  with  legal  skills  to  assist  disputing  parties  to  avoid  litigation.    This \nsystem complements the barangay (village) justice system, the main recourse of the poor. \n \n\nII. SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA. Social Analysis \n\n \n\nRule  of  law  is  one  of  the  basic  needs  of  all  Filipinos  according  to  the  Medium  Term  Philippine  Development  Plan.  The \nprogram has been designed to meet the key areas that benefit the majority of the population who are not involved in litigation \nand for the minority that are. The program contributes to human security, reduces vulnerability to injustices that are beyond \nthe capacity of the poor, and provides access to restitution should it be necessary. For those involved in litigation, the program \ndevelops the quality of the justice system through better trained and gender-sensitized judges, court personnel, and mediators \nwhile providing a more expedient and affordable remedy.    \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\nHigh-level and working-level consultations were held before and during the extended Fact-Finding Mission completed in July \n2008.  Moreover,  the  policy  matrix  of  the  cluster  program  was  presented  for  comments  and  discussed  extensively  with \nstakeholders,  including  those  in  Cebu,  the  pilot  site  for  the  RCAO,  in  May  2008.    The  pro-poor  focus  of  the  program  was \nguided by focus group discussions with community-level stakeholders in Cebu City, including micro-entrepreneurs, barangay \ncouncil members, and women\u2019s and other community level associations. In addition, consultations were held with organized \nnon-government organizations focusing on the justice system, including Supreme Court Appointments Watch, Humanitarian \nLegal Assistance Foundation (HLAF), the Gerry Roxas Foundation, the Philippine Jesuit Prison Service Foundation, and the \nIntegrated Bar of the Philippines.  \n\n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\nProgram reforms include elements of information sharing, consultation, collaborative decision making, and empowerment. \nExamples of these are: (i) increasing the transparency and accountability of budgets and processes; (ii) creation of a justice \nsector agency-wide coordination council to provide policy guidance for the development, implementation, financing, and \nreview of a justice sector policy and a sector wide approach to reforms. Development and expansion of alternative dispute \nresolution mechanisms empowers communities to meet their justice needs.       \n\n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \n \nThe specific actions described are incorporated in the policy reforms to be implemented by the implementing agencies.  \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\nThe GJRP Program has been developed based on extensive consultations with relevant stakeholders (the Judiciary, judicial \nsector and law enforcement agencies) on the constraints and challenges faced by their respective institutions to promote the \neffective application of pro-poor and gender-responsive policies, strategies and programs. Critical impediments to women\u2019s \nequal access to judicial services were documented in a gender assessment carried out by the Government of the Philippines \n(The Government) under the Action Program for Judicial Reform 2001\u20132006 (APJR). These included: (i) women and \ndisadvantaged groups have limited knowledge of their rights; (ii) court processes as well as processes under other justice \nsector agencies, are not sensitive to the conditions and circumstances of women and other disadvantaged groups; (iii) and \nalthough there have been a number of gender sensitivity trainings for judges and other members of the court and the PNP, \nthe justice sector staff has low awareness or appreciation of gender issues, especially in the area of gender-based violence \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n71 \n\n(GBV). Building on these findings and the project-specific social/gender analysis, the Program has been designed to \nincorporate gender design features in all of its subcomponents. GAD-relevant conditions for tranche release have been \nincluded in the Policy Matrix [see policy actions 4.1.4, 4.1.5 and 5.3.1 under subprogram 1 and 2 (Appendix 2)]. In addition, \nthe Government has requested the ADB to provide technical assistance (TA) grant to support the implementation of the \nGJRP. The TA , in its output 2, includes a range of activities aimed at increasing the gender capacity of the Judiciary, selected \njudicial and enforcement agencies to address critical issues related to GBV. The activities will be implemented by a national \norganization (nongovernment organization or academic institution) in consultation with the Committee on Gender \nResponsiveness in the Judiciary (CGRJ) at the SC, the Committee on Gender and Development of the DOJ and the Human \nRights Office of the Philippine National Police.  \n2.
