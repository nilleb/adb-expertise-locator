The objective\nis to improve connectivity, efficiency, and disaster resilience of transportation network in Solomon Islands. The east-west\nGuadalcanal road corridor is in deteriorating condition, critical urban road sections have capacity constraints leading to traffic\ncongestion, and inadequate maritime facilities aggravating efficiency of shipping services. The proposed project will provide\nroad and maritime infrastructure, ensuring access to basic services, increase income generating opportunities, and promote\nsocial cohesiveness.\nImpact: Access to essential services and productive resources and markets provided to all Solomon Islanders (National\nDevelopment Strategy, 2016-2035).\nOutcome: Connectivity, efficiency, and disaster resilience of transportation network in Solomon Islands improved\nOutputs: (i)Road transport infrastructure rehabilitated and climate proofed, (ii)Maritime transport infrastructure constructed and\nmade resilient to disaster risks,  and (iii)Institutional capacity strengthened\n\nImplementation Arrangements: Ministry of Finance and Treasury will be the executing agency.\n\nProject Readiness: The feasibility study, detailed design, and tender documents will be prepared by a consulting firm financed\nunder the ongoing Transport Sector Project Development Facility, which was mobilized in February 2019. The consulting firm\nwill prepare the design for all components of the project and the outputs will be reviewed by MID, ADB, and an independent\ndesign review consultant.\n\nAdvance contracting will be undertaken for civil works and consulting services. Therefore, high project readiness is expected to\nbe achieved.\n\n9. Milestones\nModality\nMultitranche financing facility\nTranche I\nTranche II\nTranche III\n\n10.

The project will improve connectivity, efficiency, and disaster resilience of the transportation \nnetwork in Solomon Islands. \n \n\nII.  RATIONALE \n\n3. \nSolomon Islands is an archipelago of more than 900 islands and low-lying coral atolls with \na population of about 670,000. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) recognizes Solomon Islands \nas  in  a  fragile  and  conflict-affected  situation  following  the  civil  tensions  from  1998  to  2003. \nSince the end of the tensions, Solomon Islands has been rebuilding its economy. From 2015 to \n2019, the country\u2019s average annual economic growth rate was 3.0%, driven by export of natural \nresources.  Solomon  Islands  is  highly  prone  to  geophysical  and  climate  hazards  that  will  be \nexacerbated by climate change. About 85% of the population live in rural areas with limited access \nto market and basic services. \n \n4. \nSector road map. Recognizing these challenges, in April 2016, the government launched \nthe  National  Development  Strategy  (NDS),  2016\u20132035,  which  outlines  Solomon  Islands\u2019 \nsocioeconomic  development  framework. 1 The  NDS  serves  as  the  road  map  for  the  project. \nIt emphasizes the need to expand and maintain climate-resilient infrastructure to achieve inclusive \neconomic growth by increasing access to domestic and international markets.2 Under the NDS, \nat least 40% of the rural population should have access to essential services as a direct result of \ninfrastructure investment by 2035. \n \n5. \nTransport infrastructure in Solomon Islands is inadequate and in a poor state of repair. \nAssets are deteriorating because of high exposure to geophysical and climate hazards, including \nearthquakes,  landslides,  flooding,  and  cyclones.  The  vulnerability  of  transport  infrastructure  to \ndisasters  significantly  complicates  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to  develop  a  multimodal  and \nintegrated transport network to boost the economy. \n \n6. \nOnly 67% of the country\u2019s 1,523 km road network is in maintainable condition, while the \nrest needs substantial rehabilitation to become maintainable. There are about 18,000 vehicles in \nSolomon Islands, of which 90% are in Guadalcanal Province.3 The country\u2019s main road, the east\u2013\nwest Guadalcanal corridor, is deteriorating. Critical urban road sections have capacity constraints \nleading to traffic congestion, and frequent floods occasionally wash away bridges and inundate \nsections of the road. This is particularly challenging for women and children who rely heavily on \n\n \n\n1  Government of Solomon Islands. 2016. National Development Strategy, 2016\u20132035. Honiara. \n2  In the NDS, the Solomon Islands commits to facilitate regional trade to promote inclusive economic growth. Solomon \nIslands  is  a  member  of  the  World  Trade  Organization,  the  Melanesian  Free  Trade  Agreement,  the  intra-regional \nPacific  Islands  Countries  Trade  Agreement,  and  Pacific  Agreement  on  Closer  Economic  Relations  Plus. \nThe government is also an early adopter of approaches outlined in  Pacific Ports 2030\u20132050, a vision of resilient, \ngreen, and clean ports in the Pacific. \n\n3  Annual average daily traffic is about 900 vehicles in rural areas and 9,000\u201338,000 in urban areas. \n\n \n\n\fsafe pedestrian access for travel. Lack of maintenance and under-capacity of drainage systems \nalso contribute to widespread road deterioration. \n \n7. \nInadequate  maritime  facilities  aggravate  the  poor  safety  and  efficiency  of  shipping \nservices. Of the 91 domestic wharves, only 46 are in maintainable condition.4 At most islands, \nvessels have no choice but to offload passengers and cargoes onto small outboard motorboats \nfar from the shore. This practice is extremely risky for vulnerable passengers, such as people with \ndisabilities, pregnant women, and young children; and is particularly challenging in bad weather, \nespecially at sites exposed to strong trade winds. \n \n8. \nThe  Honiara  International  Port  handles  about  90%  of  international  cargo  and  has  an \nannual  container  cargo  handling  volume  of  about  31,000  twenty-foot  equivalent  units. \nHowever, the old international wharf does not meet seismic standards. In the event of a significant \nseismic  event,  the  wharf  would  sustain  substantial  damage,  possibly  beyond  repair.  Such  an \nevent might also preclude it from being able to support post-disaster functions. \n \nPolicy framework and donor coordination. The government\u2019s National Transport Plan \n9. \n2017\u20132036 sets out guiding principles for priority investments in the transport sector and serves \nas the policy framework for the project.5 The government used multi-criteria analysis to prioritize \ninvestments  in  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  of  existing  road,  maritime,  and  aviation \ninfrastructure. \n \n10. \nSolomon  Islands\u2019  road  and  maritime  sectors  face  challenges  including  in  asset \nmanagement  and  planning,  implementation  efficiency,  and  transport  safety,  which  the \ninitiatives. 6 \ngovernment \nThe Ministry  of  Infrastructure  Development  (MID)  is  responsible  for  planning,  developing,  and \nmanaging transport infrastructure including roads, bridges, and wharves. In 2009, the government \nestablished the National Transport Fund (NTF) under the MID to finance the development and \nmaintenance of transport assets. From 2016 to 2017, the NTF had difficulty fully implementing its \nwork programs. To address this challenge, the World Bank\u2019s ongoing Roads and Aviation Project \nis providing technical assistance to the NTF to build its capacity, particularly for long-term planning \nand  asset  management.  Transport \nfurther \nimprovement. Road safety is a concern in central Honiara, which has the highest concentration \nof vehicles in the country. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)-financed Kukum \nHighway Upgrade Project,  completed  in 2018,  improved  pedestrian  walkways, road  crossings, \nand  a  roundabout  in  Honiara.  The  planned  second  phase  of  the  project  is  expected  to  further \nenhance road safety. In addition, the Word Bank\u2019s Global Road Safety Facility is preparing a road \nsafety management capacity review to help address road safety issues in Solomon Islands. \n \n11. \nThe  Solomon  Islands  Maritime  Authority  (SIMA)  oversees  maritime  safety  regulation. \nThe state-owned enterprise, Solomon Islands Ports Authority, operates the ports in Honiara and \nNoro. The passage of the SIMA Act, 2018 by the National Parliament of Solomon Islands aims \nfor SIMA to become a self-funded organization to provide better service to the shipping industry \nand  fulfill  mandatory  obligations  under  international  maritime  conventions.  The  Government  of \nAustralia  provides  assistance  through  physical  and  nonphysical  maritime  sector  investments, \nincluding  ongoing  support  to  operationalize  the  SIMA  Act,  and  pursues  reforms  for  existing \n\nthrough  various  development  partner-supported \n\ninfrastructure  maintenance  practices  need \n\nis  addressing \n\n \n\n4  Government of Solomon Islands, Ministry of Infrastructure Development (MID), Central Project Implementation Unit. \n\n2017.

The government\u2019s initiative to strengthen transport connectivity is in \nline  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  operational  priorities. 7 Investments  in  building  a  climate-  and \ndisaster-resilient transport network will contribute to addressing remaining poverty and reducing \ninequalities, accelerating progress in gender equality, making cities more livable, and fostering \nregional cooperation and integration.  ADB\u2019s support for the government\u2019s initiative will contribute \nto achieving the objectives of ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for 11 small Pacific island \ncountries, 2021\u20132023 by enhancing transport connectivity and efficiency and improving climate \nand disaster resilience.8 The project supports the implementation of climate- and disaster-resilient \ninfrastructure by incorporating designs that address the risk of earthquake and of flooding during \nheavy  rainfall.  Moreover,  the  project\u2019s  emphasis  of  building  a  long-term  partnership  with  the \ngovernment and improving domestic and regional connectivity through infrastructure investment \nis  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Pacific  Approach,  2016\u20132020. 9 The  project  will  also  support  improved \ntransport  infrastructure  maintenance  practices  and  will  contribute  to  strengthening  the  MID\u2019s \ninstitutional capacity. \n \n13. \nPandemic  impacts.  The  ongoing  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic  has \nseverely impacted the Solomon Islands\u2019 economy. The economy is estimated to have contracted \nby  4.5%  in  2020,  driven  by  disruptions  to  export  markets,  supply  chains,  and  travel.10 In  May \n2020, the government adopted the economic stimulus package of $37.5 million, 30% of which is \ncommitted  to  building  infrastructure  programmed  under  the  National  Transport  Plan,  2017\u2013\n2036.11 Rehabilitation of the existing infrastructure remains a national priority to help households \nand businesses continue to produce, trade, employ people, and boost aggregate demand in the \neconomy. Further, the need for infrastructure rehabilitation is crucial to sustain and quickly revive \nthe economy in the aftermath of COVID-19. \n \nThe  project  is  equivalent  to  11%  of  the  country\u2019s  gross  national  income.  Supporting \n14. \ninfrastructure is highly beneficial because it provides employment, maintains economic activity, \nand contributes to unlocking the potential for more investments and growth in rural areas. The \nimpacts will be felt in the capital region and the agriculture hubs in the selected provinces. Cost \nestimates and implementation schedules have been updated to reflect the impacts of COVID-19. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nA. \n \n15. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  access  to  essential  services  and \nproductive resources and markets provided to all Solomon Islanders (footnote 1).

Honiara. \n\n12 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fOutputs \n\nB. \n \n16. \nOutput  1:  Road  transport  infrastructure  rehabilitated  and  climate  proofed. \nThe project will finance civil works to rehabilitate and upgrade about 35 km of road infrastructure \nalong  the  east\u2013west  corridor.  This  comprises  (i)  rehabilitating  the  1.7  km  section  of  Mendana \nAvenue between Honiara City Council and Town Ground with asphalt concrete wearing course; \nand improving road safety by providing bus bays, parking, and footpaths; (ii) upgrading the 3.1 km \nroad section between Town Ground and White River from two lanes to four lanes with asphalt \nconcrete wearing course; and improving road safety through intersection treatments, provision of \nrefuge islands and footpaths, and improving traffic flows through the construction of bus bays; \nand  (iii)  rehabilitating  the  31  km  road  section  between  Henderson  and  Mberande  with  double \nbituminous surface treatment; and inclusion of road safety furniture including guardrails, traffic-\ncalming  measures,  and  speed  signage  in  villages.  Civil  works  will  include  post-construction \nperformance-based  maintenance;  climate  proofing  to  future  climate  parameters;  and  gender-\nresponsive measures, which may include pedestrian footpaths, lighting, and concrete steps and \nwashing  slabs. Gender-based  violence  (GBV)  information  and  referral  details  will  be  posted  in \nbus shelters and community areas in the project sites. \n \n17. \nOutput  2:  Maritime  transport  infrastructure  constructed  and  made  resilient  to \ndisaster  risks.  The  project  will  finance  civil  works  to  construct  two  national  priority  provincial \nwharves at Ahanga in Rennell and Bellona Province; and Kira Kira, the capital of Makira-Ulawa \nProvince.  Rising  sea  levels  and  extreme  waves  are  the  main  threats  to  these  wharves. \nThe wharves will allow vessels to berth even in rough seas.13 Cargo will be able to be transferred \ndirectly  from  the  vessels  to  the  wharves.  Civil  works  will  include  (i)  construction  of  new  piled \nreinforced concrete wharves and integrated small boat jetties to facilitate the efficient movement \nof passengers and freight on maritime transport; (ii) construction of new access roads to improve \nintermodal links to maritime transport in the target provinces; and (iii) construction of sheltered \nwaiting areas, spaces for women to market products, and separate ablution blocks for men and \nwomen.  \n \n18. \nThe project will also finance the reconstruction and improvement of the existing old wharf \nin  Honiara  International  Port  to  make  it  more  resilient  to  earthquakes.14 Although  the  existing \nwharf  could  be  strengthened  at  a  lower  cost,  in-situ  geotechnical  conditions  would  limit  the \nadditional seismic resilience that such strengthening works could achieve. On this basis, it was \ndetermined that reconstructing part of the wharf using modern seismic codes would be a better \noption, with the significant added benefit that the wharf can also be raised to accommodate the \nprojected  sea  level  rise  during  the  design  life  of  the  structure.  An  extension  of  the  wharf  and \ndredging works will also ensure that the wharf will be able to receive more vessels, reduce ship \nwaiting  times,  and  increase  annual  freight  throughput.  Ultimately,  the  project  will  contribute  to \nreducing the cost of international trade. \n \n19. \nOutput 3: Institutional capacity strengthened. The project will support improvements \nin the transport infrastructure maintenance practices in Solomon Islands. It will assist the MID in \nplanning,  project  preparation,  procurement,  contract  management,  works  supervision,  asset \ninstitutional  reform. \nmanagement  system  development,  and \nThe project  will  provide  specific  capacity  strengthening  for  women  in  the  MID.  It  will  also  help \n\ntransport  sector \n\nlong-term \n\n13 The new piled reinforced concrete wharf structures will be robust, with a deck level to  account for cyclonic waves \n\nwith an average recurrence interval of 100 years. \n\n14 Part of the existing wharf will be demolished and completely reconstructed. \n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fstrengthen the capacity of the Solomon Islands Ports Authority to meet international standards \nand procedures, and assess the port\u2019s opportunity to integrate into green port initiatives. \n \n20. \nPast assistance. ADB has provided extensive support to the transport sector, beginning \nwith a $2.03 million loan approved in 1977 to extend the wharf in Honiara. This was followed by \na second phase to rehabilitate the original section of the wharf, which was completed in 1990. \nIn 1984,  ADB  approved  a  $1.81  million  loan  to  improve  and  upgrade  the  road  network  in \nGuadalcanal. Following a period of civil unrest, ADB resumed support to the transport sector in \n2006, and has supported seven transport projects since then, including the ongoing Sustainable \nTransport Infrastructure Improvement Program approved in 2016.15 ADB has provided capacity \nstrengthening support in the transport sector through technical assistance since 2005 (footnote \n6).  \n \n21. \nLessons. Completed and ongoing ADB-funded projects have incurred significant start-up \ndelays  pertaining  to  the  preparation  of  detailed  designs,  scoping,  and  procurement  activities. \nSuch delays have  inadvertently  affected  the  timely  implementation of  maintenance activities in \nthe country. In response to this finding, ADB approved the Transport Sector Project Development \nFacility  to  ensure  design  readiness  by  supporting  the  government  in  preparing  engineering \ndesigns and assisting safeguards requirement activities, including the activities to be carried out \nunder the project.16 \n \n22. \nThe 2020 Annual Evaluation Review highlighted the need to ensure the sustainability of \nthe project outcome.17 In the transport context, this requires supporting adequate operation and \nmaintenance  of  infrastructure  assets.  The  project  will  address  sustainability  issues  through \nphysical  and  nonphysical  investments.  It  incorporates  a  new  contracting  initiative,  post-\nconstruction  performance-based  maintenance,18 and  will  review  the  MID\u2019s  asset  management \nsystem and recommend further enhancement to ensure sustainability during and after the project. \n \nDisaster and climate risk assessment. A disaster and climate risk assessment prepared \n23. \nfor the project revealed that the most significant hazards to maritime infrastructure  in Solomon \nIslands are earthquakes, extreme waves, and sea level rise. Earthquakes pose a high risk to the \nold  wharf  in  Honiara  Port,  while  extreme  waves  and  sea  level  rise  are  more  of  a  risk  to  the \nprovincial wharves. The design for the Honiara Port will consider raising the aprons to the required \nlevel to accommodate the predicted sea level rise over the design life of the project. \n \n24. \nValue  added  by  ADB  assistance.  ADB\u2019s  engagement  will  add  value  by  incorporating \ninternational  best  practices  for  transport  investment  projects,  including  introduction  of  post-\nconstruction performance-based maintenance and addressing climate change and disaster risks. \nThe project will complement the improvement works on the JICA-financed road sections of the \neast\u2013west  Guadalcanal  corridor;  contribute  to  many  network  improvements  made  under  other \n\n \n\n15 Project Performance under Past Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2); and ADB. \n2016.

These outputs are best financed by an MFF to \nachieve the outcome.19 An MFF is the preferred delivery modality as it allows early contracting of \nlong-term contracts and longer sector engagement, while financing is predictable and borrowing \ncan be spread over an extended time. The project will be financed by an MFF with three tranches \nadopting the time-slicing approach for large-scale stand-alone projects. Each tranche will finance \nslices of a group of contracts following the indicative tranche schedule, and the amount for each \ntranche  will  be  requested  according  to  the  disbursement  progress  and  projection.  The  MFF \nmodality enables ADB to support implementation of the NDS through a long-term partnership with \nSolomon Islands. \n \n26. \nof the works contract packages and consulting services. \n \nC. \n \n27. \nphysical and price contingencies, interest, and other charges during implementation (Table 1). \n \n\nScope of project 1.

Any ADF allocation will be subject to (i) the availability of ADF resources, (ii) Solomon \nIslands\u2019 access to such resources pursuant to ADB\u2019s graduation policy and the requirements of \nADF  donors,  and  (iii)  the  availability  of  such  resources  to  Solomon  Islands  given  ADB\u2019s \nconcessional  assistance  policy  for  the  relevant  ADF  period.  Efforts  will  be  made  to  obtain \nadditional  allocations  from  thematic  pool  as  well  as  identify  possible  cofinancing  sources.

ADB has agreed with the government to \njointly select consultants based on an agreed responsibility matrix to avoid start-up delays. ADB \nhas undertaken the detailed strategic procurement planning to choose the optimal procurement \narrangements. The project will achieve the best value for money by (i) using e-procurement to \nlower transaction costs and enhance process efficiency and transparency, (ii) attracting qualified \ncontractors for six works packages by conducting a pre-procurement workshop to get feedback \nfrom the market before finalizing the bidding documents, and (iii) recruiting qualified consulting \nfirms  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  with  a  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  90:10  for \nthree packages. \n \n\nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\nA. \n \nThe  engineering  design  was  prepared  to  avoid  or  minimize  land  acquisition,  social,  and \n33. \nenvironmental  impacts;  consider  road  safety;  and  minimize  climate  change  and  disaster  risks. \nIn addition,  advance  actions  have  been  taken  to  ensure  that  construction  can  commence  early. \nThese measures have improved project readiness and will mitigate the risk of delay. \n \n34. \nClimate and disaster risk assessments have been undertaken for the project roads, Ahanga \nand Kira Kira wharves, and Honiara Port. The assessments covered the findings of recent studies \non  seismic  risks  and  projections  of  accelerated  sea  level  rise  because  of  climate  change. \nThey determined the level of risk for the hazards, recommended adaptation measures that have \nbeen integrated into the design, and estimated the cost of the adaptation measures. \n \nB. \n \n35. \nEconomic and financial  analyses  concluded  that  the  project  is  economically  viable and \nfinancially sustainable. The economic analysis of the project follows ADB guidelines and compares \nlife cycle costs in with- and without-project scenarios using a 9% discount rate and the economic \ninternal rate of return as decision criteria.23 The project team evaluated all roads, and the wharves \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \n23 ADB. 2017.

The overall economic internal rate of return of the project is estimated to be 15.3%. \nThe sensitivity analysis demonstrated the robustness of the project. \n \nA financial assessment was undertaken by the project team to examine the viability of the \n36. \nproject  investment.  The  project\u2019s  lending  decision  is  based  on  economic  viability  rather  than \nfinancial  viability.  Honiara  International  Port,  the  only  revenue-generating  component  of  the \nproject,  is  financially  viable.  Based  on  the  financial  sustainability  assessment,  the  incremental \nrecurrent cost will be about 2% of the current recurrent budget allocation, and a commitment from \nthe government will ensure the project\u2019s sustainability. The incremental revenues generated by \nthe project during its first 25 years of operation will be sufficient to finance the project\u2019s recurrent \ncosts for Honiara Port. The pre-mitigation financial sustainability risk is substantial. The roads and \nprovincial wharves are nonrevenue earning, and will be constructed and maintained by the MID. \n \nC. \n \nThe financial management assessment concluded that the MID has adequate capacity to \n37. \nundertake the financial management of the project. The financial management risk is substantial, \nmainly because of the lack of internal audit function in the MID. The risk to financial management \nis  mitigated  by  the  fact  that  the  MID  has  prior  and  ongoing  experience  in  implementing  ADB-\nfinanced  projects.  The  project  management  unit  (PMU)  will  include  a  financial  management \nspecialist. The PMU will establish and maintain separate records and accounts to track the financing \nresources received and the expenditures made for the project. The project will engage an internal \nauditor to review the internal process and an external auditor to conduct annual audits of the project \naccounts and related financial statements following international auditing standards. \n \n38. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the FAM (footnote 22). \n \nD. \n \nIn 2020, the economy is projected to contract by 4.5% because of COVID-19 impacts, and \n39. \nthe  proportion  of  the  population  living  below  the  international  poverty  line  of  $1.90  per  day  is \nprojected  to  increase  from  23.6%  in  2018  to  27.5%  in  2020.24 Unemployment,  food  insecurity, \nlimited access to basic social services and infrastructure, and a dearth of income opportunities \nare key poverty issues for the subproject communities, particularly in rural areas. Access to basic \nsocial services is limited because of the poor transport services and the high cost of urban living, \nwhich requires a regular cash income. The project will help reduce poverty by making land and \nmaritime  transportation  safer  and  more  efficient,  thereby  expanding  income  opportunities  for \nurban  and  rural  project  communities  through  better  connectivity.  Faster  and  easier  travel  will \nimprove  access  to  schools,  health  centers,  and  markets.  The  civil  works  are  also  expected  to \ncreate  local  jobs  for  men  and  women  by  outsourcing  unskilled  and  semiskilled  local  labor  or \nrelated services at construction sites. The PMU will report progress on safeguard activities in its \nquarterly progress reports and semiannual safeguards reports on overall project activities to ADB \nand the government. \n \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n24 ADB.  2020.

A gender action plan (GAP) and a \n40. \ncommunication strategy and participation plan have been prepared. Most project outputs include \ngender design features to ensure women\u2019s participation and access to project benefits. Key gender \nissues  include  safety  concerns  with  land  and  maritime  infrastructure  such  as  lack  of  pedestrian \nfootpaths and lighting; limited income opportunities for women; low participation in decision-making; \na  high  prevalence  of  GBV;  and  human  trafficking,  particularly  forced  labor  and  prostitution. \nAccording to the World Vision Australia, 63% of men believe it is acceptable to hit women in certain \ncircumstances, 38% of women report their first sexual encounter as having been forced, and 2 out \nof 3 women have experienced physical violence from an intimate partner.25 The GAP focuses on \nincluding safe and gender-responsive design features in infrastructure and creating opportunities \nfor  women\u2019s  employment,  particularly  in  nontraditional  and  skilled  roles.  In  addition,  actions  are \nincluded to prevent and respond to GBV and human trafficking, including training  of project staff \nand  contractors,  awareness  raising  within  communities,  and  information  dissemination  on  GBV \nservices. The project will engage a social development and gender specialist to assist the PMU in \nimplementing, monitoring, and reporting on the use of the ADB-provided GAP monitoring template \nand providing capacity-building activities. \n \nE. \n \n41. \nof project 1 are as follows.26 \n \n42. \nEnvironment (category B). The subprojects included in the first tranche are assessed \ncategory  B  for  the  environment.  The  MID  prepared  an  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework, and three initial environmental examinations (IEEs). The impacts of works for each \ncomponent are site-specific, largely limited to the construction footprint, and can be mitigated and \nmanaged  to  acceptable  levels  provided  the  measures  identified  in  the  IEE  and  environmental \nmanagement  plan  (EMP)  are  implemented,  and  subsequently  monitored  and  reported. \nThe Environment  and  Conservation  Division  of  the  Ministry  of  Environment,  Climate  Change, \nDisaster  Management  and  Meteorology  has  adequate  capacity  to monitor  the  project  with  the \nPMU\u2019s  support.  The  IEEs  and  EMPs  will  be  reformatted  as  public  environment  reports  and \nsubmitted  to  the  Environment  and  Conservation  Division  as  the  basis  of  the  application  for \ndevelopment  consent  for  the  subprojects.  The  contractors  will  prepare  their  construction  EMP \nbased on the project EMP and reflect their construction methodology and approach to the main \nconstruction elements, risk assessment, and mitigation measures.27 The PMU, with support from \nthe  construction  supervision  consultant,  will  review  and  clear  the  construction  EMP  before \ncommencing any physical works, including site clearance. \n \n43. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B).  The  project  was  assessed  category  B  for \ninvoluntary  resettlement.  The  MID  prepared  a  land  acquisition  resettlement  framework,  two \nresettlement  plans,  and  three  due  diligence  reports  (DDRs)  for  the  overall  project.  The \nresettlement framework will guide any further resettlement plans or DDRs required during project \nimplementation  and  for  any  unanticipated  impacts.  The  two  draft  resettlement  plans  were \nprepared  for  the  upgrading  of  the  road  section  between  Town  Ground  and  White  River  on \nGuadalcanal  and  for  the  construction  of  the  Ahanga  and  Kira  Kira  wharves,  which  will  require \nsome land acquisition and compensation for crops and trees.
