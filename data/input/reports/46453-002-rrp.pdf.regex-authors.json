THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan and (ii) proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the European Union, both to \nthe Cook Islands for the Renewable Energy Sector Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will support the government\u2019s policy to increase power generation from \nrenewable sources and enhance the government\u2019s institutional capacity for implementing the \nCook Islands Renewable Energy Chart Implementation Plan (CIRECIP), 2012\u20132020, which sets \na target of supplying electricity from renewable energy sources on all inhabited islands by \n2020.2 It will construct new solar photovoltaic power plants on up to six islands of the southern \ngroup, as shown on the map. The project will result in annual savings of 1.09 million liters of \ndiesel consumption and annual reduction of 2,930 tons of carbon dioxide emission, for greater \nenergy security and sustainability in the Cook Islands.3 \n \n          II.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n1.  Socioeconomic Context and Sector Performance \n \n3.  The Cook Islands is a Pacific island country divided into two island groups with an \nestimated total population of 18,600 people.4 The northern group consists of seven low-lying \nand sparsely populated coral atolls, while the southern group consists of eight fertile volcanic \nislands. About 92% of the population lives in the southern group, which includes the main island \nof Rarotonga. Economic development is hindered by the country\u2019s limited size, isolation and \ndistance from markets, lack of natural resources, periodic devastation from natural disasters, \nand inadequate infrastructure. \n \n4.  The Cook Islands depends heavily on imported fuels. Its total fuel import bill in 2012 was \n$29.8 million, or 25% of total imports and 9% of gross domestic product.5 The total installed \npower generation capacity in the Cook Islands is 11.75 megawatts. Diesel-powered generators \nconstitute  about  99%  of  the  total  electricity  generating  capacity.  More  than  99%  of  all \nhouseholds are grid connected, 5.5% have additional solar photovoltaic home systems, and \n1.0% use small diesel generators.6 According to the CIRECIP, current electricity demand in the \nCook Islands is about 33.0 gigawatt-hours, and is forecast to grow modestly to 38.5 gigawatt-\nhours by 2020. The southern group is the dominant load center, accounting for 98% of current \nand future load demand. \n \n5.  Delivery of energy services is undertaken by a state-owned utility on Rarotonga, and by \nisland administration committees on the other outer islands in the northern and southern groups. \nThey  are  vertically  integrated  electricity  authorities  in  charge  of  generation,  transmission, \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2  Government of the Cook Islands. 2012. The Cook Islands Renewable Energy Chart Implementation Plan. Avarua.  \n3  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance: ADB. 2013. Technical \nAssistance to the Cook Islands for Preparing the Renewable Energy Project. Manila (TA 8439-COO, $500,000, \napproved on 4 September, financed by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction). \n4  Government of the Cook Islands. 2013. Vital Statistics and Population Estimate. Avarua.  \n5  According to the Cook Islands Statistics Bulletin (2012), the country imported about 14.1 million liters of fuel in \n2012, of which 8.6 million liters were used to generate electricity. \n6  Ministry of Finance and Economic Management. 2012. Census of Population and Dwellings. Avarua.  ", "2   \ndistribution, and retail sales of electricity. Assets for energy services are administered and \nmanaged by the Cook Islands Investment Corporation, the government\u2019s holding company that \ngroups the state-owned enterprises.  \n \n2.  Sector Challenges and Opportunities \n \n6.  Electricity costs in the Cook Islands are among the highest in the Pacific. The reliance \non imported fuel is reflected in the high average electricity tariff charged, which was $0.63 per \nkilowatt-hour  (kWh)  in  2013.  Such  a  high  tariff  translates  into  4%  of  annual  household \nexpenditure and 15% of annual business entity expenditure. Under the regulations, the utilities \ncan pass on fuel costs directly to consumers and charge an inflation-indexed nonfuel tariff. In \nRarotonga, the current tariff is $0.70 per kWh. On the outer islands, due to limited affordability, \nthe government subsidizes a part of the electricity generation cost so the average electricity \ntariff is $0.57 per kWh. Both are above regional average tariffs. \n \n7.  Volatile  diesel  fuel  prices  and  heavy  reliance  on  imported  diesel  fuel  for  power \ngeneration significantly affects the economy and living standards in the Cook Islands. Changing \ndiesel-based power generation to renewable energy sources is expected to reduce the cost of \ngeneration by up to 40% and diesel consumption for power generation by up to 95%, and will \ncontribute to sustainable social and economic development. Average annual solar irradiation of \naround  1,900  kWh  per  square  meter  constitutes  a  major  renewable  source  for  power \ngeneration.  \n \n8.  In 2011, the government issued the Cook Islands Renewable Energy Chart, which sets a \ntarget of supplying 50% of inhabited islands with power from renewable sources by 2015, and \n100%  of  the  inhabited  islands  by  2020.7 It  also  launched  the  CIRECIP  in  2012,  which \nincorporates a development schedule for electricity generation from renewable sources.  \n \n3.  Institutional Framework \n \n9.  The  government  has  a  coherent  institutional  framework  to  guide  renewable  energy \ndevelopment. The National Renewable Energy Committee was formed in 2010 to lead the \nrenewable  energy  project  and  ensure  timely  achievement  of  the  government\u2019s  renewable \nenergy policy.8 A Renewable Energy Development Division (REDD) was established in 2010 \nwithin the Office of the Prime Minister and is responsible for implementing the CIRECIP. REDD \nis under the supervision and guidance of the Office of the Energy Commissioner (OEC), which \nis responsible for energy sector planning and management, including electricity tariff regulation \nand standardization of electricity services.  \n   \n4.  Rationale for Sector Loan Modality and ADB Intervention \n \n10.  The Cook Islands has a clearly articulated renewable energy sector development plan in \nthe CIRECIP. However, developing grid-connected renewable energy systems on all islands \nwithin the next 6 years requires strengthened and comprehensive project management and \ninstitutional capacity. The CIRECIP proposes a wide range of renewable energy systems for \n12 geographically scattered islands in the northern and southern groups according to their \n                                                \n7  Government of the Cook Islands. 2011. The Cook Islands Renewable Energy Chart. Avarua.  \n8  It is comprised of the minister in charge of renewable energy, OEC, REDD, Te Aponga Uira (TAU), Ministry of \nInfrastructure and Planning, the Cook Islands Investment Corporation, and Ministry of Finance and Economic \nManagement (MFEM).  ", "3 \n \nresource  endowments,  load  demand,  and  grid  conditions  for  stable  electricity  supply.  The \nCIRECIP  also  proposes  mitigating  technical  and  administrative  complexity  through \ncomprehensive institutional strengthening in load management and grid protection, demand-\nside energy efficiency, and private sector participation.  \n \n11.  To minimize complexity in project management and support CIRECIP implementation in \na phased manner, the project will finance a time and area slice of the development plan. It will \nsupport solar photovoltaic power development and implementation in the southern group over \n3 years. Combined with ongoing assistance by New Zealand for the northern group (para. 13), \nthe project will help achieve renewable energy system deployment on about 80% of islands by \n2017.  It  will  also  provide  project  management  support  and  capacity  building  for  design, \nimplementation,  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M);  and  help  facilitate  private  sector \nparticipation,  enhance demand-side  energy  efficiency,  and  update the  CIRECIP for further \nrenewable energy deployment by 2020. \n \n12.  The Energy Policy (2009) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) supports the rationale \nof the proposed project by promoting deployment of clean energy in its developing member \ncountries.9 Development of energy and infrastructure are a main component of the Pacific \nApproach  2010\u22122014.10 The  project  is  included  in  the  country  operations  business  plan, \n2014\u22122016, which includes energy as a priority area of support and sets a primary goal of \nreducing the country\u2019s dependence on imported fossil fuels by generating power from its own \nrenewable  energy  sources.11 The  sector  loan  approach  is  appropriate  because  it  allows \nflexibility in subproject development, and capacity development to roll out renewable energy \ndeployment  on  all  islands;  and the  Cook Islands  has  a sound sector  development  policy, \ninstitutional capacity, and appropriate policies.  \n \n5.  Development Partner Coordination \n \n13.  New  Zealand  started  solar  photovoltaic  power  system  development  in  the  northern \ngroup of islands in 2012, and on Rarotonga in 2014. ADB, New Zealand, and the European \nUnion have coordinated closely to support implementation of the CIRECIP by developing a \ncommon technical standard for grid-connected solar photovoltaic systems, sharing lessons and \nissues related to engineering design and project implementation; and sharing a project steering \ngroup. The proposed project will complement these efforts.12 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n14.  The  impact  of  the  project  will  be  increased  energy  security  in  an  environmentally \nsustainable manner. The outcome will be increased access to a higher share of electricity \ngenerated by renewable energy sources.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n15.  The project will have two outputs: \n(i)  Solar photovoltaic power system development. The project will construct up \nto six solar photovoltaic power plants with a total installed capacity of about \n                                                \n9   ADB. 2009. Energy Policy.

", "4   \n3 megawatts-peak coupled with lithium-ion batteries to store electricity from solar \nenergy, and rehabilitate the existing distribution network for core and noncore \nsubprojects. The project will feature three core subprojects on Mangaia, Mauke, \nand Mitiaro and up to three noncore subprojects on Aitutaki, Atiu, and Rarotonga. \nCore  subprojects  are  already  designed,  assessed  as  viable,  and  ready  for \nimplementation.  These  three  will  be  implemented  first.  Noncore  subprojects \nrequire additional resources for further due diligence and final design after project \napproval. They will be implemented sequentially.  \n \n(ii)  Institutional strengthening and project management support. The project will \nprovide institutional strengthening to OEC and REDD  to develop the energy \nefficiency policy implementation plan including an energy audit and monitoring \nscheme to enhance demand-side energy efficiency practices for targeted major \nelectricity consumer groups;13 develop the capacity to assess renewable energy \ntechnologies and set appropriate off-take tariffs for power purchase agreements \nin projects funded by the private sector; and update the CIRECIP by reexamining \nthe electricity load demand up to 2020, the renewable technology choices, and a \nleast-cost investment plan. The consultants to be engaged under this component \nwill be the project owner\u2019s engineer (POE) team, who will also provide project \nmanagement support for REDD and Te Aponga Uira (TAU) to help implement \nthe project. \n \nD.

The government will bear the exchange rate and interest rate fluctuation risks.  ", "6   \n21.  Procurement of goods, works, and services will be conducted through turnkey contracts. \nThe  turnkey  contracts  will  include  final  design  and  engineering,  supply  and  installation  of \nequipment, construction works and commissioning, and an O&M knowledge transfer program. \nThe procurement will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to \ntime) for the civil works contracts. However, the European Union cannot exclude any of its \neligible countries from the contracts it funds.16 Therefore, ADB Board approval for a waiver of \nArticle 14(ix) of the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank is required to allow \nthose countries eligible for procurement under the European Union regulations that are not \nmember countries of ADB to tender for the procurement of equipment and materials, civil works, \nand services to be financed under the grant.17 \n \n22.  Consulting services will be recruited through firms using the quality- and cost-based \nselection method with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10 for project management support to REDD \nand  TAU,  including  project  preparation  for  noncore  subprojects,  preparation  of  bidding \ndocuments, assistance during the bidding process, project supervision, and commissioning.

Solar photovoltaic \npower plants with lithium-ion batteries for energy storage have been assessed as the least-cost \ntechnology in view of available renewable resources, necessary capital and operational costs, \npower output stability, and environmental impacts. The system configuration design of core \nsubprojects  has  been  carefully  analyzed  considering  the  assessed  solar  irradiation,  load \ndemand curve, grid conditions, hard marine environments, and extreme weather events such as \ncyclones.  These  core  subprojects  will  include  remote  control,  monitoring,  and  protection \nsystems  to  stabilize  the  grid  in  line  with  international  design  standards.  The  turnkey \ncontractor(s) will provide specialized O&M knowledge transfer to ensure sustainable operation. \n \n25.  The power outputs from the three core subprojects will be synchronized and integrated \ninto the existing electricity grid using lithium-ion battery storage to make up for the intermittent \nnature of solar energy and ensure electricity supply even during the night. This will help make \nthe electricity system sustainable, stable, and reliable, allowing it to supply clean electricity and \nmeet more than 90% of electricity load demand. The three noncore subprojects will be prudently \nprepared based on the system configuration design and lessons from implementation of the \nthree core subprojects. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n26.  Financial analysis. The project financial analysis quantifies costs and benefits for each \ncore subprojects. Project financial costs include (the initial capital costs of solar photovoltaic \npower system development, including power grid refurbishments; annual and periodic O&M \nexpenditures; and consulting services required for design review, tender assistance, project \nsupervision, and training. The financial costs exclude price contingencies. A financial appraisal \nof the three core subprojects was undertaken using with- and without-project scenarios over a \n25-year operational period. Revenue is derived from the levelized cost of electricity under the \nwith-project scenario and derived from the existing tariff under the without- project scenario.19 \nThe financial internal rates of return for the Mangaia, Mauke, and Mitiaro subprojects are \nestimated to be 6%, 9%, and 7%. This compares favorably with the estimated weighted average \ncost of capital of 5.02%, indicating that the project is financially viable. The sensitivity tests \nshowed robust results for all adverse scenarios, with financial internal rates of return exceeding \nthe weighted average cost of capital.20  \n \n27.  Economic analysis. Economic analysis was undertaken for the three core subprojects \nby comparing the discounted costs and benefits under the with- and without-project scenarios \nover 2014\u20132042 in constant 2014 prices. The without-project case represents a continuation of \nthe existing situation, and the with-project case represents the project investment scenario. The \neconomic internal rates of return for Mangaia, Mauke, and Mitiaro are estimated to be 13%, \n14%, and 14%. They compare favorably with the 12% economic opportunity cost of capital, \nindicating that the project is economically viable. Under the same scenarios considered in the \nfinancial analysis, the economic internal rate of return remains robust.21 \n \n                                                \n19 The average levelized cost of electricity for core subprojects is estimated at $0.45, while the average prevailing \ntariff is at $0.65. \n20  Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "8   \nC.  Governance \n28.  Financial  management.  To  ease  cash  flow  during  project  implementation,  the \nexecuting agency will approve and submit to ADB withdrawal applications from the project \nmanagement unit, assisted by POE, for direct payment for most project goods, works, services, \nand the consultancy component of the turnkey contractor(s). Disbursements of grant funds \nunder  the  project  will  be  to  procure  goods,  works,  services,  and  the  related  consultancy \ncomponent of the turnkey contractor. A financial management assessment of MFEM, REDD, \nand  TAU\u2019s  internal  controls  and  accounting  and  audit  procedures  was  undertaken.  Their \nfinancial management practices and procedures are considered to be adequate if assisted by \nPOE and the overall risk rating was assessed as moderate. The project management unit to be \nestablished will comprise POE, REDD, and TAU, and will be responsible for project financial \nmanagement and accounting. The government and TAU\u2019s accounts and reporting structures are \nbased on New Zealand\u2019s generally accepted accounting standards.  \n \n29.  Procurement capacity assessments for MFEM, REDD, and TAU were also conducted \nand overall risk ratings were average. MFEM, REDD, and TAU have experienced and trained \npersonnel in procurement and contract management supported by well-established internal \nprocedures  and  management  systems,  which  are  consistent  with  ADB  requirements.  The \naccountability  mechanism  is  also  deemed  effective  for  procurement  and  contract  awards, \ndisbursement,  and  internal  audit.  However,  both  REDD  and  TAU  lack  experience  in \nprocurement  with  international  financing  institutions.  To  overcome  this  capacity  gap, \nprocurement training seminars were provided through project preparatory technical assistance \n(footnote  3).The  POE,  which  should  have  extensive  experience  with  ADB-financed \ninfrastructure projects, will help conduct procurement in line with ADB guidelines. \n \n30.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and TAU. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the project administration manual.  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n31.  The project will improve access to more affordable power supply, and will also widen \naccess to better social services and income-generating opportunities. It will contribute to poverty \nalleviation indirectly by reducing the country\u2019s reliance on volatile and costly imported fossil fuels \nfor power generation. The resettlement plan includes  the participation of  youth, vulnerable \npeople, and women\u2019s groups in all project consultations, and employment opportunities for \nthese groups. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n32.  Environment  (category  B).  The  project  has  been  classified  as  category  B  for \nenvironment following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). An environmental assessment \nand review framework has been prepared for noncore subprojects, and an initial environmental \nexamination has been prepared for core subprojects. The main environmental impacts will occur \nduring  site  preparation,  which  will  include  the  cutting  of  about  140  trees  and  clearing  of \nvegetative cover from the proposed sites and surrounding areas to prevent shading. There will \nbe impacts from noise and dust due to transportation of plants and materials, and operation of \nconstruction machinery. These impacts will be short-term (about 1 week for the smaller plants, \nand up to 1 month for the larger plants). Operational impacts include maintenance of the plant \nand management of used batteries. It is proposed, as a special condition in the technical ", "9 \n \nspecifications, that suppliers handle and dispose used batteries. The solar photovoltaic power \nsystem will not have any significant long-term environmental impacts.  \n33.  During implementation, MFEM, REDD, and TAU, with support from the environmental \nexpert under the institutional strengthening and project management support component, will \nprepare the initial environmental examination for noncore subprojects and update the initial \nenvironmental examinations and the environmental management plans based on the detailed \ndesigns  for  core  and  noncore  subprojects.  ADB  will  clear  the  updated  documents.  The \nenvironmental management plans from the updated assessments will be integrated into the bid \nand contract documents. During project implementation, the environment expert will enhance \nthe capacity of MFEM, REDD, and TAU in safeguard implementation and monitoring. \n \n34.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). The project has been classified as category B \nfor involuntary resettlement. It is not expected to involve physical displacement. Impacts are not \nsignificant, but will arise from the minor acquisition of land with some trees. A resettlement plan \nhas been prepared for the three core subprojects. A resettlement framework has been prepared \nfor the project with guidelines to prepare resettlement plans for noncore subprojects. Affected \ncommunities have been consulted during project preparation, and the resettlement framework \nand plan have been posted on ADB\u2019s website. The resettlement plan will be updated after the \ndetailed design, and compensation will be provided to affected persons before civil works start \non the respective sites. The Cook Islands Investment Corporation and Crown Law Office have \nexperience in acquiring land and they will support MFEM, REDD, and TAU in updating and \nimplementing the resettlement plan. The project will recruit social safeguard specialist to boost \nthe capacity of government agencies for managing land acquisition and safeguards.     \n \n35.  Indigenous  peoples  (category  C).  The project has been classified category C for \nindigenous peoples. The population in the project area comprises the mainstream population of \nthe Cook Islands. The project is not expected to affect any distinct and vulnerable group of \nindigenous peoples as defined under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n36.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.22 The integrated benefits and impacts are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nSupport, performance, and  Adequate project management assistance provided by the \ncoordination at REDD and TAU  institutional strengthening and project management support \ncould be inadequate.  component. \n \nImplementation could be delayed  Preparation of noncore subprojects will be supported under \ndue to delays in noncore  institutional strengthening and project management support.
