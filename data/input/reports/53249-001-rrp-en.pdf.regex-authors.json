THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nMongolia  for  the  First  Utility-Scale  Energy  Storage  Project.  The  report  also  describes  the \nproposed administration of a grant to be provided by the High-Level Technology Fund1 for the \nFirst Utility-Scale Energy Storage Project, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the grant. \n \n2.  The proposed project aims to install the first large-scale advanced battery energy storage \nsystem (BESS) in Mongolia to (i) supply clean peaking power that is charged by renewable energy \nelectricity, which is otherwise curtailed; and (ii) provide regulation reserve to integrate additional \nrenewable energy capacity in the transmission grid. The project will lead to the decarbonization \nof the heavily coal-dependent energy system in the country. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Coal-dependent energy system and shortage of electricity supply. Mongolia has \n1,240 megawatts (MW) of installed capacity. The central energy system (CES) grid\u2014which \ncovers major load demand centers, including Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia\u2014accounted \nfor 84% of the country\u2019s electricity demand in 2018. Since the country has no access to natural \ngas resources, its energy system is the most heavily dependent on coal among the developing \nmember countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). In 2018, coal-fired combined \nheat and power (CHP) plants constituted 93% of total power generation in the CES grid. Because \nof delayed investment in new generation capacity and growing electricity demand, the capacity \nfactor of aging CHP plants during peak time in winter (September to April) exceeds 90%, and the \ngeneration capacity reserve in the CES could be depleted as early as 2020.2 Based on updated \nelectricity load demand projections to 2030, generation capacity additions of 230 MW by 2023 \nand 891 MW by 2030 are essential to meet growing demand in the CES. \n \n4.  Decarbonizing the energy sector. The energy sector is Mongolia\u2019s largest contributor to \ngreenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions,  accounting  for  about  two-thirds  of  the  country\u2019s  GHG \nemissions. According to Mongolia\u2019s nationally determined contributions, GHG emissions will \nincrease to 51.5 million tons of carbon dioxide (mtCO ) by 2030 in the business-as-usual scenario, \n2\nwith energy\u2019s share of total emissions increasing to 81.5%.3 The country targets reducing GHG \nemissions  by  7.3  mtCO   by  2030  through  emission  reductions  from  power  generation \n2\n(4.9 mtCO ), industry (0.7 mtCO ), and transportation (1.7 mtCO ). \n2 2 2\n \n5.  Renewable energy potential. Mongolia has very large renewable energy resources, \nespecially for wind and solar energy. Renewable energy potential is estimated to be equivalent to \n2,600 gigawatts of installed capacity, which could fully meet future power demand in the country. \n \n1  Financing partner: the Government of Japan. \n2  Imported electricity from the Russian Federation grew from 176 gigawatt-hours in 2015 to 304 gigawatt-hours in \n2018. The loading rate of the 220-kilovolt transmission line  (double circuit) for electricity imports from the \nRussian Federation also reached 60% in 2018, failing to meet the N-1 reliability standard. A transmission system \nwhich is designed to meet N-1 reliability standard can maintain its power supply without damage in case of any one \ncontingency event, e.g. the failure of one transmission circuit. \n3  United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. 2016. Intended Nationally Determined Contribution \n(INDC) Submission by Mongolia to the Ad-Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (ADP). \nBonn. \n ", "2 \nHowever, this rich renewable energy resource has been marginally utilized.4 The Government of \nMongolia aims to increase the share of renewable energy in total installed capacity from about \n12% in 2018 to 20% by 2023 and 30% by 2030, in line with the State Policy on Energy, 2015\u2013\n2030.5 Renewable energy capacity in the CES must grow to 274.2 MW by 2023 and 595.3 MW \nby 2030 to meet these medium- and long-term renewable energy targets. \n \n6.  Energy sector reform and evolving policies for renewable energy investment. The \ngovernment has initiated a series of energy sector reforms for sustainable sector development. \nIn 2001, the CES was unbundled into generation, transmission, and distribution companies; and \nthe government introduced a single-buyer model for market-oriented sector operations. The \ngovernment has designated the National Power Transmission Grid (NPTG) as a single national \ntransmission company to secure third-party access to the transmission grid. To attract private \nsector investment, the Law on Investment was amended in 2015 to support private sector \ninvestment in energy infrastructure. The State Policy on Energy, 2015\u20132030 (para. 5) set financial \nsoundness targets for all state-owned energy utilities, including NPTG, to achieve zero profit \nmargin by 2023 and 5% by 2030 for financially sustainable energy operations.6 Enacted in 2007, \nthe Law on Renewable Energy aimed to increase the use of renewable energy in Mongolia and \nregulate its generation and supply, and has since enabled the generation of sizable private sector \ninvestment in renewable energy. It also set a United States dollar-denominated feed-in tariff to \nattract  foreign  investors.  An  amendment  to  the  Law  on  Renewable  Energy,  approved  by \nParliament in June 2015, introduced a renewable energy surcharge on end-user tariffs and \nestablished a payment fund for renewable energy generators. The Law on Renewable Energy \nwas further amended in 2019 to introduce a capacity auction scheme that aims to establish a \ntransparent tariff-setting mechanism for renewable energy power plants through a competitive \nbidding process in which the government designates the plant site location with a full guarantee \nfor grid connection. This amendment is expected to stimulate competition among private investors \nfor optimal energy pricing and reduce the cost burden on end-users for sustainable renewable \nenergy deployment.7   \n \n7.  Grid absorption limit to evacuate renewable energy. Private sector renewable energy \nprojects with installed capacity of about 400 MW have been licensed in the CES, of which 260 MW \nhave been commissioned.8 The growing number of grid-connected wind and solar photovoltaic \npower plants and a grid system dominated by coal-fired CHP plants, which have limited flexibility \nto support fluctuating renewable energy power output, have curtailed the generation of renewable \nenergy. Mongolia\u2019s renewable energy investment plan in 2015 estimated the maximum grid \nabsorption capacity to be 50 MW in wind power and 125 MW in solar photovoltaic power without \ncurtailment.9 Since 2015, the government has been seeking the development of the 315 MW Egiin \nhydropower plant in the Selenge river basin upstream of Baikal lake in Siberia to fully evacuate \nrenewable energy into the grid and meet peak power demand. The project has not moved forward, \n \n4  The total renewable energy capacity was 145 MW in 2018 and 260 MW in 2019. \n5  Government of Mongolia. 2015. State Policy on Energy, 2015\u20132030. Ulaanbaatar. \n6  Since 2016, no state-owned utility in the CES has received a state subsidy to cover operation deficit. NPTG achieved \nzero net profit margin target in 2018. \n7  The 2015 law set the feed-in tariff at $0.08\u2013$0.10 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for wind power and $0.13\u2013$0.15 per kWh \nfor solar power. The 2019 amendment introduced the capacity auction scheme with a ceiling tariff of $0.08 per kWh \nfor wind power and $0.12 per kWh for solar photovoltaic power. The tariff for renewable energy projects with power \npurchase agreements signed before the 2019 amendment is grandfathered. The European Bank for Reconstruction \nand Development supports the Ministry of Energy in preparing regulations for implementing the capacity auction \nscheme. \n8  This comprises 155 MW of wind power and 105 MW of solar photovoltaic power. \n9  By 2018, the total installed capacity of wind power was 155 MW, exceeding the technical grid absorption limit of \n50 MW without curtailment. At 105 MW, the total installed capacity of solar photovoltaic power is below the 125 MW \ngrid absorption limit without curtailment. \n ", "3 \nhowever, owing to the Russian Federation\u2019s concerns over environmental impacts and the water \nlevel in Baikal lake.10 With stalled hydropower investment and lack of access to natural gas to \ndevelop fast-responding power plants, battery storage is the best available option to swiftly \nsupport renewable energy evacuation into the country\u2019s less flexible, coal-dominated energy \nsystem. \n \n8.  The project aims to expand the system\u2019s capacity to fully absorb renewable energy, which \nis otherwise curtailed to supply clean peaking power, and to integrate additional renewable energy \ncapacity into the CES grid. This would reduce GHG emissions from the highly carbon-intensive \nimported electricity from Siberia and provide room to connect an additional 350 MW of renewable \nenergy capacity to the CES without curtailment. This will help in fully meeting the government\u2019s \nrenewable energy target by 2030 (para. 5). The project will also indirectly support the promotion \nof electric heating in ger (traditional tent) districts in Ulaanbaatar through the supply of clean \nelectricity during winter peak demand time, which is one of the major policy actions in the National \nProgram for Reducing Air and Environment Pollution, 2017\u20132025.11 \n \n9.  The project directly contributes to broadening the climate change response in support of \nthe government\u2019s compliance with the targets indicated during the 21st Conference of the Parties \nto the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, as discussed in ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy, 2017\u20132020 for Mongolia.12 It will support a key strategic pillar of ADB\u2019s \nstrategy 2030\u2014tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing \nenvironmental sustainability\u2014by accelerating low GHG emission development. The project will \ncontribute to Sustainable Development Goal 13 on taking urgent action to combat climate change \nand its impact; and Sustainable Development Goal 7 on ensuring access to affordable, reliable, \nsustainable and modern energy for all. \n \nB.  Project Description  \n \n10.  The project is aligned with the following impact: renewable energy capacity increased to \n20% of total generation capacity by 2023 and 30% by 2030.13 The project will have the following \noutcome: renewable electricity penetration increased.14 On successful completion, the project will \nsupply 44 gigawatt-hours of clean peaking power annually, and support the integration of an \nadditional 859 gigawatt-hours of renewable electricity into the CES grid annually, thereby avoiding \n842,039 tons of carbon dioxide emissions yearly by 2025.  \n \n11.  Output 1: Large-scale advanced battery energy storage system installed. By 2022, \n125 MW/160 megawatt-hours of advanced BESS is installed. The BESS will be resilient to \nextremely cold climate and will be equipped with a battery energy management system to be fully \ncharged by renewable electricity, which is otherwise curtailed, and to discharge clean electricity \nto supply peaking power in the CES. The BESS will also provide the regulation reserve in the \n \n10 ADB supported detailed engineering design for Egiin hydropower development in 1992. After several design \nchanges, initial site development work was initiated in 2015 with concessional finance from the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina. The Russian Federation objected to the project because of potential environmental impacts on Baikal lake. \nConcessional finance from the People\u2019s Republic of China was canceled in 2017. \n11 Government of Mongolia. 2017.

Output 2: Institutional and organizational capacity enhanced. The project will help \nstrengthen the capacity of the National Dispatching Center (NDC) to handle power dispatch and \ngrid operations and of the NPTG to operate and maintain the BESS sustainably.15 It will include \n(i) developing BESS operation and maintenance (O&M) regulations to avoid reducing battery life \nthrough overcharging and discharging, which is a major cause of fire, and to secure the necessary \nfunds for a major overhaul to replace the battery pack after 13 years of operation; (ii) developing \nan ancillary service pricing policy and guidelines to create room for private sector investment in \nBESS for future capacity addition; (iii) providing training for NDC and NPTG staff, with particular \nattention  on  female  staff,  and  developing  a  gender  policy  in  the  energy  sector;  and \n(iv) disseminating project knowledge and lessons to other DMCs facing similar challenges in \nscaling up renewable energy. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n13.  Upstream involvement of ADB and knowledge sharing. ADB identified the project \nthrough  policy  dialogue  with  the  government  during  the  country  programming  mission  in \nMarch 2018. Based on these discussions, ADB approved knowledge and support technical \nassistance  in  August  2018  to  assess  the  feasibility  of  the  BESS  investment  option  and \nconceptualize the project.16 In April 2019, the government requested $100 million loan financing \nfrom ADB for the project to be developed in 2020. ADB\u2019s loan financing, with grant support from \nthe High-Level Technology Fund (HLT Fund) will demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of \ncutting-edge large-scale BESS in extreme cold climate conditions.17 Since the project will be the \nworld\u2019s largest BESS in operation, it will also generate knowledge on the development and \noperation  of  at-scale  BESS  to  decarbonize  power  systems  in  other  DMCs,  which  can  be \ndisseminated by ADB.18 \n \n14.  Support for private sector investment in renewable energy. The project will remove \nbarriers to private sector investment in renewable energy by eliminating possible curtailment. \nFurther to the successful financial closure in March 2019 of the country\u2019s first nonsovereign solar \npower project, ADB\u2019s East Asia Department and Private Sector Operations Department will \ncontinue to jointly support renewable energy transactions in the CES to decarbonize the country\u2019s \nenergy sector.19 The project will also develop an ancillary service pricing policy and guidelines to \nattract private sector investment in scaling up BESS capacity (para. 12). \n \n \n15 The NDC, a state-owned transmission power system operator, will send dispatch commands to the project BESS \nplant after commissioning. The NPTG, a state-owned transmission company, will be the owner of the project BESS \nplant and will be responsible for daily O&M. \n16 ADB. 2018.

The HLT Fund will provide grant cofinancing equivalent to $3.0 million, to be \n ", "6 \nadministered  by  ADB. 20  The  HLT  Fund\u2019s  grant  cofinancing  will  be  front-loaded  for  the \nprocurement and installation of the BESS and for the recruitment of the project management \nconsultant. All procurement financed by ADB and the HLT Fund will follow the ADB Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers \n(2017, as amended from time to time). The government will finance taxes and duties other than \nincome tax and social insurance fees for consultants and PMU staff. \n \n19.  Climate mitigation is estimated to cost $102.9 million and climate adaptation is estimated \nto cost $0.1 million. ADB and the HLT Fund will finance 100% of mitigation and adaptation costs. \nDetails are in the project administration manual. While the project\u2019s major contribution to the \nclimate change agenda is to mitigate the climate change impact by promoting renewable energy, \nthe project\u2019s design partly considers climate change adaptation (para. 22). \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  The Ministry of Energy (MOE) will be the executing agency for the project and the NPTG \nwill be the implementing agency. A project steering committee\u2014comprising the MOE, the Ministry \nof Finance, the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC),21 the NDC, and the NPTG\u2014will be \nestablished to provide overall guidance in project management and implementation. The PMU, to \nbe established under the MOE, will manage, coordinate, and supervise project implementation. \nNPTG and NDC staff will be involved in the PMU for close coordination and smooth handover of \nthe project facility after its commission. The borrower and grant recipient is the Government of \nMongolia, which will onlend the loan and grant proceeds to the NPTG on the same terms and \nconditions as those of the ADB loan and the HLT Fund grant. The implementing agency will \nassume the foreign exchange and interest rate risks of the ADB loan. The government has \nassured ADB that counterpart funding, including any additional counterpart funding needed to \ncover fund shortfalls or cost overruns, will be provided in a timely manner. \n \n21.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual.22 Universal procurement will apply to the civil works, goods, \nturnkey contracts, and consulting services to be financed by ADB and the HLT Fund. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  March 2020\u2013September 2024 \nEstimated completion date  30 September 2024 \nEstimated loan closing date  31 March 2025 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Project steering committee:  \nMOE (chair) \nMOF, Energy Regulatory Commission, National Dispatching Center, and \nNational Power Transmission Grid representatives (members) \n(ii)  Executing agency  MOE \n(iii)  Key implementing agency  National Power Transmission Grid State-Owned Joint Stock Company \n(iv)  Implementation unit  PMU at the MOE, 9 staff \nProcurement  Open competitive  1 procurement of plant  $92.50 million \nbidding (internationally  contract \nadvertised) \nConsulting services  90:10 quality- and  86 person-months  $1.76 million  \ncost- based selection \n \n20 Financing partner: the Government of Japan. \n21 The ERC is an independent energy authority that regulates the generation, transmission, distribution, dispatch, and \nsupply of energy.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n22.  Technical due diligence, including power system analysis, confirmed the technical viability \nof the project. The power system analysis confirmed that connecting the project BESS at the \nSongino substation would not require additional construction in the power grid. The BESS will be \ndesigned to function under the country\u2019s severe climate conditions.23 To minimize the fire incident \nrisk, a buffer zone will be secured around the BESS plant. As there is no relevant international \nstandard, the project will adopt the common practice of having a 20-meter-wide fire-protection \nbuffer zone. The country\u2019s lack of experience and knowledge of utility-scale BESS will be \naddressed by the project\u2019s capacity building component, including start-up operation services to \nbe provided by the contractor during the initial 2-year operation after project commissioning. \nClimate change risks relevant to the BESS plant include the risk of flooding from increased \nprecipitation and the risk of an unstable foundation from possible melting permafrost. To adapt to \nthese climate change risks, the project is designed to bring its foundation to the same level as \nthat of the Songino substation. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n  \n23.  The financial analysis included an evaluation to determine financial viability of the project; \nand analysis of the financial statements of the NPTG, the owner of the project, to determine the \nfinancial sustainability of the project. The financial internal rate of return of the project is 3.65% \nwhich is higher than the weighted cost of capital of 2.12%, indicating that the project is financially \nviable.  Sensitivity  analysis  indicated  that  the  project  remains  financially  viable  even  when \ninfluenced by adverse changes in capital cost, O&M cost, transmission volume, and tariff. Given \nthat the NPTG will own, operate, and maintain the project asset and will repay the ADB loan, the \ngovernment  will  follow  the  established  regulation  and  pricing  mechanism  to  increase  the \ntransmission tariff, which is covenanted in the legal document, enabling the NPTG to generate \nsufficient cash flows to meet the project\u2019s O&M costs including battery pack replacement cost and \nrepay  the  ADB  loan.  With  the  envisaged  tariff  increase,  the  financial  statement  analysis \ndemonstrates  that  the  NPTG  will  have  adequate  financial  capacity  to  cover  the  project\u2019s \nincremental recurrent O&M costs and meet debt service requirements. The project is considered \nfinancially sustainable.24 \n \n23 The temperature in Ulaanbaatar ranges from about \u201330\u00b0C to +25\u00b0C. \n24 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n \n24.  Economic analysis of the project indicated an economic internal rate of return of 17.16% \nwith environmental benefits, which is higher than the economic opportunity cost of capital of \n9.00%. Sensitivity analysis showed that economic internal rates of return with environmental \nbenefit would be (i) 15.19% if there is a 10% decline in economic benefits, (ii) 15.69% if there is \na 10% capital cost overrun, (iii) 16.82% if Operational expenses increase by 10%, (iv) 16.30% if \nthe economic cost of coal declines by 10%, (v) 16.09% if additional renewable energy capacity is \nreduced by 10%, and (vi) 17.07% if the project completion is delayed by 1 year. The project\u2019s \neconomic viability is robust under all adverse scenarios.25 \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n25.  The project design has incorporated the necessary measures for sustainable project \noperation. The project involves start-up operation services to be provided by the contractor during \nthe initial 2-year operation to ensure knowledge transfer and adequate training for sustainable \nO&M (para. 22). To support necessary O&M funding including battery pack replacement cost, \nADB and the ERC agreed to the transmission tariff adjustment mechanism that is also covenanted \nin the legal document (para. 23). Institutional and organizational capacity development support \nunder output 2 of the project will also help (i) strengthen O&M capacity in the NDC and NPTG, \nand (ii) develop an ancillary services policy to support private sector investment in future BESS \ncapacity additions (para. 12). \n \nD.  Governance \n \n26.  Financial  management.  The  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s technical guidance note for financial management assessment.26 The \nfinancial management assessment evaluated the financial management capacities of the MOE \nand NPTG. The assessment confirmed that the executing and implementing agencies have \nadequate financial management systems and procedures in place to implement the project. The \nassessed pre-mitigation financial management risk is moderate. The key weakness in project \nfinancial management is the implementing agency\u2019s lack of experience in executing ADB-financed \nprojects. This risk will be mitigated through the financial management action plan described in the \nproject administration manual. The executing and implementing agencies will implement the time-\nbound financial management action plan during the project to mitigate the risks. \n \n27.  Procurement. The project procurement risk assessment followed ADB\u2019s guidance note \non strategic procurement planning.27 It found the project procurement risk to be high mainly \nbecause of the executing agency\u2019s lack of experience in procuring utility-scale BESS or similar \nsystems and in handling large-value contracts. To mitigate this risk, it is proposed to recruit two \ninternational individual consultants (a BESS specialist and a procurement specialist) to support \nthe  executing  agency  and  the  PMU  during  the  bidding  process  of  the  main  procurement \npackages. The project will be procuring the first large-scale BESS in Mongolia, and the supply \nmarket is currently dominated by several potential bidders. To minimize the risk of bidding failure, \nmarket assessments have been conducted to set appropriate qualifications, and technical and \nbid evaluation criteria. To achieve value for money, ADB\u2019s Standard Bidding Document for the \nProcurement of Plant\u2014Design, Supply, Installation will be used and evaluation criteria will take \nlife-cycle costs and relevant sustainability and environment factors into account.28 \n \n25 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 ADB. 2015.

Integrity  due  diligence  of  the  implementing  agency,  NPTG,  was  conducted.29 No \nsignificant integrity risks were identified. \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MOE.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 21). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n30.  Poverty and social analysis. People in the CES area, including the capital city of \nUlaanbaatar, will benefit directly from the project through reduced power outages and improved \nair quality. A social survey analysis found that about 20% of the population in the CES is \ncategorized poor or extreme poor and is more vulnerable to power outages than other segments \nof the population. The project\u2019s impact on energy prices is negligible. The project will indirectly \ncontribute to improved air quality through the deployment of electric heaters in ger districts in \nUlaanbaatar, which is one of the major policy actions in the National Program for Reducing Air \nand Environment Pollution, 2017\u20132025.30 The project will create jobs during construction and \noperation.  The  contractors  will  be  required  to  adhere  to  national  labor  standards,  safety \nregulations, and equal pay for equal work. \n \n31.  Gender.  The  project  is  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  Gender  analysis \nindicates that the project will benefit the population of Ulaanbaatar as a whole. Women are \nexpected to benefit from reduced power outages resulting from the project. During power outages, \nwomen tend to play primary coping roles, such as reverting to traditional coal stoves for cooking, \nboiling water, and heating, most of which are time- and labor-intensive. The analysis on the \ngender mainstreaming status in the energy sector found that the country\u2019s energy sector is among \nthe few sectors lacking a gender strategy and that the NPTG and NDC have fewer female power \nengineers than male counterparts, particularly at senior levels. \n \n32.  To assess end-user project benefits, the project will conduct end-user surveys on the \ncommissioning of the BESS plant, with specific focus on the benefit for female end-users. At the \npolicy level, the project will develop the first gender policy for the energy sector together with the \nMOE. The project will support a tailored professional training program for female engineers at the \nNPTG and NDC to increase the pool of highly qualified female engineers eligible for senior \npositions. The training\u2019s counterpart will be the Mongolian University of Science and Technology. \nThe project sets targets for the participation of female engineers in BESS-specific training under \nthe turnkey contract. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n33.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.31 \n \n34.  Environment (category B). The project is classified as category B for environment. An \ninitial environmental examination, including an environmental management plan (EMP), has been \n \n29 ADB. 2003.

Potential adverse environmental impacts \nduring  construction\u2014including  soil  erosion,  noise,  dust  emissions,  construction  waste  and \nwastewater, and occupational and community health and safety risks\u2014are mostly temporary, \npredictable, and reversible; and can be mitigated through adherence to national regulations and \nEMP implementation. Potential impacts during operation include solid and hazardous waste (e.g., \nspent battery cells), wastewater, explosion and fire hazards, and occupational and community \nhealth and safety risks. As there are no hazardous waste treatment facilities in Mongolia, the \nsupplier will be responsible for the final disposal of the spent battery cells. An occupational health \nand safety plan and an emergency response plan will be prepared, and meaningful public \nconsultations have been conducted. The implementing agency will establish grievance redress \nmechanisms. The EMP has allocated sufficient budget to ensure proper implementation of the \nmitigation and monitoring measures, and an environmental consultant will be engaged during \nproject implementation. Environmental monitoring reports will be submitted to ADB semiannually \nduring construction and annually during operation. During preconstruction and construction, \ncontractors will be required to comply with the EMP, which will be updated as necessary if \nunanticipated impacts are identified during implementation. Based on climate risk screening, \npotential climate risks to the project are medium. A climate risk assessment has been conducted. \nTo adapt to climate change risks, such as possible melting permafrost and flooding, the project is \ndesigned to bring the foundation of the BESS plant level with that of the Songino substation. \n \n35.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  C).  The  project  is  category  C  for  involuntary \nresettlement.   The  battery field,  control  building,  high-voltage  and medium-voltage  outdoor \nequipment, and one of three transmission towers will be located within the 2 hectares of land \nallocated for the project, which are part of the 16 hectares of government land allocated to the \nMOE on 17 September 2019. The NPTG owns a storage building within the land allocated for the \nproject, but it is no longer being used. The remaining two towers will be located in the 25-meter \nelectrical-safety buffer zone of the Songino substation (existing facility). The NPTG is the operator \nfor both the proposed project and the Songino substation. Due diligence confirmed no outstanding \nor legacy issue on the land allocated for the project or the Songino substation. \n \n36.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project is category C for indigenous peoples \nsafeguards. The location of the battery storage facility and substation is about 5 kilometers from \nresidential communities. The project will benefit the residents, and it does not have differential \nimpacts on any specific ethnic minority communities that would trigger ADB\u2019s indigenous peoples \npolicy requirements. \n \nG.
