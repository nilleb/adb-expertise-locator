Access  and \nequity  will  be  enhanced  through  the  introduction  of  a  voucher  assistance  training  scheme  and \nconstruction of dormitories. A key project focus is on increasing private involvement in TVET and \nachieving greater alignment between TVET and labor market needs.1 The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.   \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nThe Lao PDR economy has been growing strongly, with gross domestic product growth \nexpected  to  reach  7.5%  in  2010  and  average  7.8%  during  2011\u20132015.  The  government  is \nseeking to sustain strong economic growth to meet its poverty-related Millennium Development \nGoals  by  2015  and  graduate  from  least-developed  country  status  by  2020.  Limited  human \nresources,  weak  capacity,  and  skills  shortages  represent  critical  binding  constraints  for  the \ncountry. Absorbing the growing number of school leavers and providing the skills needed in the \nfast-growing economy represent emerging challenges and pose risks for the country's long-term \ndevelopment prospects. The labor market assessment identifies skill shortages across several \nsectors, including construction, furniture-making, and automobile and machinery repair. \n \n4. \nThe  TVET  sector  should  play  an  important  role  in  training  skilled  workers  for  industry \nand  in  meeting  labor  market  needs.  However,  for  a  variety  of  reasons,  the  sector  is  poorly \npositioned  to  contribute  to  either  of  these.  The  sector  and  labor  market  assessments  indicate \nthat (i) TVET enrolments are declining in high-demand skill areas and where skill shortages are \ngreatest (e.g., construction), and (ii) only a small proportion of firms recruit workers directly from \nTVET institutions and few firms have any relationship with TVET institutions.  \n \n5. \nThe role of the TVET sector in providing skilled workers to industry is limited by the lack \nof alignment between the skills required in the labor market and those produced by the TVET \nsector, and to the poor quality of training. These are in turn explained by shortages of qualified \nand trained teachers, the absence of teaching aids, and limited practical skills among teaching \nstaff. TVET curricula and programs are outdated and involve little practical training. Many TVET \ninstitutions lack modern facilities and equipment. Much of the training offered in the TVET sector \nis  not  relevant  to  labor  market  needs.  Despite  the  existence  of  the  National  Training  Council \n(NTC),  the  TVET  sector  public\u2013private  coordinating  body,  linkages  between  the  public  and \nprivate  sectors  are  weak.  Private  sector  involvement  in  TVET,  including  finance,  strategy  and \ncurriculum development, and delivery of training, can be increased. Few private institutions offer \nprograms in traditional trades.  \n \n6. \nAlthough  each  province  of  the  Lao  PDR  has  a  TVET  institution,  travel  distances  for \nstudents can be significant. The lack of clean, safe, and culturally appropriate accommodation \ncan also act as a barrier to TVET study, particularly for girls and students from ethnic groups. \nFemale enrollment is low in traditional trade areas, despite good employment opportunities and \n\n                                                 \n1   Project  preparation  was  carried  out  through  ADB.  2009.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Lao  People's  Democratic \n\nRepublic for Strengthening Technical and Vocational Education and Training Project. Manila (TA 7299-LAO). \n\n \n\n \n\n\frelatively  good  wages.  Women  and  ethnic  groups  in  rural  areas  face  particular  barriers  to \naccess due to travel distance and lack of student accommodation. Trainees from the nonformal \nsector  face  academic  barriers  in  accessing  formal  TVET,  due  to  the  lack  of  a  national \nqualifications framework and bridging programs. \n \nTVET  system  governance  is  weak,  as  is  the  management  of  TVET  institutions.  The \n7. \ngovernment's TVET strategy and master plan identify a need to reform the policy and regulatory \nframework for TVET. The current supply-side-based funding system and inflexible employment \narrangements restrict the ability of institutions to manage themselves efficiently and to change \nprogram  offerings  to  reflect  emerging  areas  of  demand.  The  capacity  of  the  Ministry  of \nEducation (MOE) and the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare (MOLSW) to manage a reformed \nTVET  system  is  weak,  and  the  two  ministries  need  to  be  more  coordinated.  A  labor  market \ninformation  system  (LMIS)  is  needed  to  identify  areas  of  labor  market  demand  and  skill \nshortages;  and  support  the  TVET  system  in  responding  to  labor  market  needs  and  offering \npotential students information on opportunities available in TVET.    \n \n8. \nBecause  skill  shortages  are  a  key  constraint  on  the  country's  development,  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) involvement in the TVET sector is strongly justified. Vocational training \nhas a significant impact on both productivity and poverty reduction.2 TVET is a key focus of the \ngovernment's  Education  Sector  Development  Framework  (ESDF),  and  the  government  has \ndeveloped a TVET strategy and master plan. The country strategy and program midterm review \n(August  2009)  identifies  a  need  for  a  gradual  shift  in  ADB\u2019s  sector  assistance  emphasis  to \nstrengthening postbasic education, including TVET and higher education.3 The project is included \nin the 2009\u20132011 country operations business plan for the country.4  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n9. \nThe expected impact of the project is a more highly skilled and diverse workforce in Lao \nPDR. The performance target is that the number of workers in the labor force with formal TVET \nqualifications  increases  by  25%  (50%  for  females)  from  2011  to  2021.  The  project\u2019s  expected \noutcome  is  an  accessible  formal  vocational  training  system  that  is  more  responsive  to  labor \nmarket needs.    \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe project will focus on certificate and diploma training in four priority skill areas with an \n10. \nidentified  labor  demand:  (i)  construction  and  building  trades,  (ii)  mechanical  and  machinery \nmaintenance and repair, (iii) furniture-making, and (iv) basic business. These priority skill areas \nwere  selected  based  on  the  findings  of  the  2010  labor  market  assessment.  This  assessment \nlists and sets out the selection criteria for the four priority skill areas.5 The project will focus on \nseven  public  TVET  institutions,  four  private  TVET  institutions  and  the  Vocational  Education \nDevelopment  Center  (VEDC).  These  entities  will  receive  a  range  of  assistance  under  the \nproject,  including  teacher  training,  new  curricula,  and  management  training.  The  seven  public \nand  four  private  TVET  institutions  will  also  be  eligible  to  enroll  students  under  the  voucher \nassistance  training  program.  The  seven  public  TVET  institutions  and  VEDC  will  receive \nequipment  and  facility  upgrades.  The  selection  of  priority  skill  areas  identifies  the  institutions \ninvolved in the project and the criteria used to select them.6   \n \n11. \nThe project will deliver five outputs: (i) improved quality of TVET, (ii) increased and more \nequitable  access  to  TVET,  (iii)  increased  private  sector  involvement  in  TVET  strategy  and \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2010.

The  project  will  develop  competency-based  skill \nstandards  and  modernized  curricula  in  the  four  priority  skill  areas.  It  will  enhance  TVET  teacher \nprofessional  standards  for  teachers  across  all  skill  areas  to  better  identify  and  target  teacher \nprofessional  development.  Teacher  standards  will  provide  a  benchmark  against  which  to  assess \nstudent TVET teachers and those seeking employment as teachers. Standards will cover technical \nand pedagogical skills. The project will also improve preservice and in-service teacher training by \nstrengthening the VEDC teaching staff, programs, and equipment and facilities.   \n \n14. \nConduct  social  marketing  campaign.  A  sustained  social  marketing  campaign  will  be \ninitiated  to  improve  the  poor  public perception of  TVET  and  vocationally-oriented  occupations. \nThis campaign, to be conducted with employers and TVET institutions, will seek to increase the \nnumber and quality of students in the TVET sector, and increase interest in vocational training \namong  females  and  ethnic  groups.  The  campaign  will  use  a  range  of  techniques,  including \ninformation provided by institutions and employers, job fairs, and television and radio dramas to \nhighlight the many benefits of pursuing vocational training.    \n \n15. \nIntroduce  career  counselling  and  vocational  guidance.  To  complement  the  LMIS \nand  social  marketing  campaign,  the  project  will  train  teachers  and  develop  career  counselling \nand guidance materials for use in the seven public and four private TVET institutions to ensure \nthat students are better informed about TVET career choices and opportunities.   \n \nUpgrade  equipment  and  improve  facilities.  The  project's  investments  in  human \n16. \nresource  development  will  be  accompanied  by  equipment  and  facility  upgrades  at  the  seven \npublic  TVET  institutions  and  VEDC.  One  further  public  TVET  institution  \u2013  the  Polytechnic \nCollege \u2013 will receive funding to upgrade a specialist workshop required for project activities.  \n \n\nIncreased and More Equitable Access to TVET \n\n2. \n \n17. \nThis output will increase access to formal certificate and diploma TVET for students from \nremote areas, including girls, by (i) providing training assistance vouchers to TVET trainees; (ii) \nincreasing  access  for  students,  particularly  girls,  from  remote  areas  by  financing  the \nconstruction  of  student-friendly  dormitory  facilities;  and  (iii)  broadening  access  to  vocational \ntraining  by  supporting  a  review  of  TVET  certificate  entry  qualifications  to  reduce  academic \nbarriers to training, and the development of new entry qualifications, procedures for recognizing \nprior learning, and special assistance programs.  \n \n18. \nProvide  training  assistance  vouchers.  The  training  assistance  voucher  program  will \nprovide tuition fee assistance and a stipend to cover living costs for students in the seven public \nand four private TVET institutions. To be eligible to receive the voucher, a student must (i) be \nenrolled in a certificate or diploma program at one of the seven public TVET institutions or four \nprivate TVET institutions in one of the four priority skill areas, (ii) be at least 16 years old, and \n(iii)  have  attended  elementary  school  or  have  recent  employment  experience.  A  total  of  4,800 \n\n \n\n\fvouchers will be offered over the project period. MOE will select the voucher recipients using a \ntransparent  process  outlined  in  the  project  administration  manual  (PAM).7  At  least  25%  of  the \nvouchers will be allocated to females and 20% to students from ethnic groups. Female voucher-\nrecipient  graduates  will  be  assisted  in  securing  employment  through  the  payment  of  a  wage \nsubsidy  to  their  employer,  covering  approximately  30%  of  the  graduate's  starting  salary.  The \nwage subsidy will last for 6 months.  \n \n19. \nEnhance access for women and ethnic groups. The project will construct or refurbish \n2,200 student-friendly dormitory places to improve access for female and ethnic students. The \ndormitories will be in the seven public TVET institutions and VEDC, with 50% of places reserved \nfor women.     \n \n\n3. \n\nIncreased Private Sector Involvement in TVET Strategy and Delivery \n\n \nTo  increase  private  sector  involvement  in  TVET  strategy  and  delivery,  the  project  will  \n20. \n(i)  strengthen  NTC\u2019s  permanent  office  and  increase  its  private  sector  focus,  (ii)  establish  or \nstrengthen industry-based trade working groups (TWGs) for the four priority skill areas, (iii) establish \nadvisory  boards  at  the  seven  public  TVET  institutions,  with  at  least  25%  private  sector  and  25% \nfemale  representation,  (iv)  introduce  a  contracting  scheme  with  private  firms  for  the  delivery  of \ntraining  to  teachers  and  students  in  specialist  skill  areas,  and  (v)  introduce  a  contracting  scheme \nwith private TVET institutions to deliver training to students across a range of skill areas.   \n \nStrengthen industry involvement in skill standards and curriculum. NTC's functions \n21. \ninclude providing strategic advice on TVET issues, coordinating with public and private training \nproviders,  overseeing  the  development  of  TVET  standards  by  TWGs,  and  monitoring  training \nperformance and examination standards.8 The project will carry out an organizational review to \nidentify  structural  and  operational  changes  that  would  improve  NTC  functioning  and  increase \nthe private sector's role across a range of functions. The project will also support the TWGs to \nincrease  industry  involvement  in  the  development  of  skill  standards  and  curriculum  in  the  four \npriority skill areas.     \n \n22. \nIntroduce contracting programs with private firms and TVET institutions. The project \nwill introduce two contracting programs to improve the relevance and responsiveness of the TVET \nsystem, and to allow the targeting of training to areas of skill shortage. The first will involve direct \ngovernment  contracting  with  private  firms  for  the  delivery  of  training  to  TVET  students  and \nteachers in  specialist skill areas that require expensive equipment that  TVET institutions cannot \nafford  (e.g.,  mining  programs).  The  second  will  involve  direct  contracting  with  private  TVET \ninstitutions for the delivery of training in areas outside the four priority skill areas. In both cases, \nthe government will pay a fixed amount per student for the delivery of training, with the payment \nbeing higher for women trainees. More than 6,700 students will be trained under these programs. \nTraining  providers  (private  firms  and  private  TVET  institutions)  will  be  selected  for  these \ncontracting programs using consultants' qualifications selection through lump sum contracting.   \n \n\nStrengthened Management and Governance of the TVET System  \n\n4. \n \n23. \nThis output will strengthen management and governance of the TVET sector by (i) reviewing \nand  strengthening  the  policy  and  regulatory  framework  for  TVET,  including  increasing  flexibility  in \nemployment arrangements for TVET teachers and introducing a unit cost funding system for TVET; \n(ii) improving quality assurance in the seven public TVET institutions, four private TVET institutions \nand VEDC; (iii) strengthening TVET information systems by developing an education management \ninformation  system,  including  design  and  system  development,  and  strengthening  capacity  to \n\n                                                 \n7  Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n8  TWGs  are  made  up  of  representatives  of  industry,  the  government,  and  the  TVET  sector  and  are  tasked  with \n\ndeveloping skill standards and curriculum. They operate under the auspices of NTC. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n5\n\noperate  and  maintain  the  system;  (iv)  establishing  a  labor  market  information  system,  including \ndesign and system development, and strengthening capacity to operate and maintain the system; \nand  (v)  strengthening  the  capacity  of  management  in  the  MOE's  Technical  and  Vocational \nEducation Department (TVED), VEDC and the seven public and four private TVET institutions. \n \nStrengthen  the  policy  and  regulatory  framework.  The  project  will  help  the \n24. \ngovernment (i) design and implement a new unit-cost-based funding system and more flexible \nemployment  arrangements  to  provide  TVET  institutions  with  greater  operating  flexibility,  and  \n(ii)  provide  scope  for  TVET  institutions  to  offer  programs  that  are  more  relevant  to  the  labor \nmarket.  Both  of  these  reforms  represent  government  policy,  agreed  as  part  of  the  ESDF \napproved by the Prime Minister in January 2009.  The mechanism for introducing the unit cost-\nbased funding system will be aligned with the policies and timeline adopted by the government.   \n \nImprove  information  on  the  labor  market  and  TVET  sector.  To  address  the  lack  of \n25. \ninformation on labor market demand and the TVET sector, the project will (i) establish an LMIS \nthat  will  provide  information  to  MOLSW  and  MOE  on  labor  market  indicators  such  as  skill \nshortages  and  salaries  for  TVET-trained  workers,  and  (ii)  strengthen  the  TVET  education \nmanagement  information  system.  MOE  will  use  LMIS  information  to  inform  funding  allocation \ndecisions, and TVET institutions will use it to inform decisions on program and course offerings. \nTracer studies will be undertaken as part of this work. The LMIS will be housed at MOLSW. The \neducation  management  information  system  will  be  strengthened  to  include  a  wider  range  of \ninformation on the TVET sector and link nonfinancial and financial data on the education sector.  \n \n\nEffective Project Management and Implementation Facilitated \n\n5. \n \n26. \nThis  output  will  support:  (a)  the  establishment  of  facilities  and  systems  required  for \neffective project management and implementation; and (b) the development and implementation \nof a project monitoring and evaluation system, including preparation of required plans and data \nsystems, the gender action plan (GAP), ethnic groups development plan, and baseline studies.  \n \nD. \n \n27. \nThe project is estimated to cost $24.8 million, including physical and price contingencies, \nand taxes and duties of $1.8 million to be financed by the government.

Committee members will be senior representatives from MOLSW, the \nMinistry  of  Finance,  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment,  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister, \nand the private sector.  \n  \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated project completion date  30 September 2015 \nProject management \n(i)   Oversight body \n\nArrangements \n1 October 2010\u221230 September 2015 \n\n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies \n(iv)  Project implementation unit \nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \nSocial marketing campaign \nContracted training and capacity \nbuilding \nProject implementation unit staff \nDisbursement \n\nProject steering committee \nVice minister, MOE and vice minister, MOLSW (cochairs)  \nMOE, MOLSW, MOF, MPI, OPM, private sector (members) \nMOE \nTVED, MOLSW  \nTVED, 8\u201310 staff, MOLSW 4 staff \nICB \nNCB \nShopping \nQCBS \nQCBS \nCQS \n\n3 contracts \n11 contracts \n2 contracts \n484 person-months \n57 person-months \n6,500 trainees \n\n$3,919,979 \n$4,463,751 \n$130,000 \n$4,134,000 \n$450,000 \n$2,800,000 \n\n330 person-months \n\nICS \n$294,000 \nThe grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to \ntime) and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the \ngovernment and ADB. \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  CQS  =  consultants'  qualifications  selection,  ICB  =  international  competitive \nbidding, ICS = individual consultant selection, MOE = Ministry of Education, MOF = Ministry of Finance, MOLSW \n= Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare, MPI = Ministry of Planning and Investment, NCB = national competitive \nbidding, OPM = Office of the Prime Minister, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection, TVED = Technical and \nVocational Education Department. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n7\n\n31. \nThe  government  asked  ADB  to  approve  advance  action  to  expedite  the  recruitment  of \nconsultants and procurement of equipment. ADB advised the government that any approval of \nadvance action does not commit ADB to finance the project.   \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nThe  direct  beneficiaries  of  the  project  will  be  the  20,000  and  more  students  who  will \n32. \nbenefit  from  improvements  in  the  quality  of  TVET  education  and  increased  access  to  TVET \nresulting  from  initiatives  such  as  the  voucher  program,  dormitories,  and  skill  contracting \nprograms. Over the course of the project, the voucher program will benefit 4,800 students, while \nthe  two  contracting  programs  will  benefit  more  than  10,000  students.  The  additional  dormitory \nplaces will benefit 1,170 students. Female students and students from ethnic groups will capture \na  significant  proportion  of  the  direct  benefits  due  to  the  project's  gender  and  ethnic  targets. \nStudents in the public and private TVET institutions studying in the four priority skill areas and \nteacher  trainees  at  VEDC  will  also  benefit  from  better  instruction,  due  to  the  quality \nimprovement  initiatives  that  are  a  key  part  of  the  project  design,  including  revised  curricula, \nupgraded facilities and equipment, and skill standards. Teachers and administrators will benefit \nfrom  the  extensive  training  and  mentoring  programs  provided  under  the  project.  Priority  skill \nareas and associated standards, training, and equipment have been chosen for their relevance \nto the Lao PDR economy and capacity.   \n \nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n33. \nThe  direct  economic  benefits  from  the  project  are  derived  mainly  from  the  increased \nnumber  of  TVET  graduates  and  the  improved  labor  market  outcomes  from  TVET  programs. \nFour  main  categories  of  beneficiaries  are  identified:  (i)  recipients  of  the  training  vouchers,  \n(ii) recipients of contracted training in priority skill areas, (iii) recipients of government support for \ntraining  in  selected  private  institutions,  and  (iv)  associated  effects  of  improved  training  and \ninstructional materials in the four priority skill areas. In total, 20,000 students are expected to be \ntrained. Utilization rates are likely to be high because project skill areas were carefully selected \nafter extensive consultation on current labor market supply and demand and investment plans. \n\n34. \nBased on conservative assumptions, such carefully targeted skills training can increase \nmonthly  wages  by  KN200,000.  Assuming  that  70%  of  beneficiaries  of training  provided  during \nthe project will utilize their learned skills in the labor market within a short time, this translates to \nan  average  annual  earnings  increment  of  approximately  $200  per  year.  Estimating  these \nbenefits over 20 years and based on the total project cost of $24.8 million yields an economic \ninternal rate of return of 15.2%. \n\n35. \nOther benefits not included in these calculations are (i) improved gender distribution in \nTVET  as  a  consequence  of  GAP  activities,  (ii)  improved  quality  and  relevance  of  teaching  in \nother skill areas as a consequence of teacher training and workplace experience, (iii) improved \nTVET  institution  management  as  a  consequence  of  management-related  human  resource \ndevelopment, and (iv) improved governance due to increased private sector involvement.  \n\n36. \nFinancial  sustainability.  The  project  should  be  financially  sustainable  as  the  bulk  of \nexpenditures  do  not  carry  on  beyond  the  end  of  the  project.  Recurrent  expenditures  such  as \nequipment maintenance cost can be absorbed by additional revenues from government funding, \nstudent  fees,  tailored  training  for  enterprises,  and  rental  of  training  venues.  Fully  90%  of \nnongovernment revenues can be used at the discretion of the institution management (e.g., to pay \nteachers  for  additional  hours,  instructional  materials,  repair  and  maintenance,  security).  The \ngovernment plans to move to a unit-cost-based funding system, which will be designed as part of \nthe project. The ESDF financing plan, however, shows that during FY2010\u2013FY2016 the proportion \nof total sector expenditure allocated to TVET is expected to rise (Table 4 in the financial analysis) \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nand the expenditure per student is expected to rise compared with other subsectors (Table 5 in \nthe financial analysis).9 \n\n37. \nThe  project  will  increase  the  labor  market  relevance  of  the  TVET  system  and  improve \nthe policy framework governing TVET institutions; both of these will improve the sustainability of \nthe TVET sector by making it better serve the national social and economic development needs, \nthe knowledge and skill learning needs of young people, and labor market demand. \n\n38. \nProject financing. The project involves a total government contribution of $1.8 million, \nmostly  in  the  form  of  taxes  and  duties.  The  total  incremental  recurrent  cost  (salaries  and \nimputed rent and utilities) is $11,200 per year. This annual government contribution ranges from \n0.1%  to  0.2%  of  the  total  TVET  recurrent  budget,  assuming  ESDF  spending  projections.  This \nsuggests the project costs are sustainable.   \n\n39. \nIncremental operating costs. Incremental operating costs will be associated with new \ndormitory  and  classrooms  financed  under  the  project.  The  total  investment  in  equipment, \nfurnishings,  dormitory  rooms,  classrooms,  and  vehicles  is  $10.5  million.  Assuming  that \noperating  costs  and  repairs  and  maintenance  equal  8%  of  the  investment,  the  incremental \nrecurrent  cost  will  be  $840,000  annually  beginning  in  FY2015,  which  amounts  to  9.4%  of  the \ntotal  government  nonwage  recurrent  budget  for  the  subsector  (assuming  ESDF  spending \nprojections),  a  figure  that  declines  to  6.4%  by  FY2016  due  to  the  rising  TVET  budget.  In \nsucceeding years, this proportion is likely to fall as the government budget rises. This, plus the \nfact  that  TVET  institutions  can  charge  tuition  fees  to  help  cover  costs,  suggests  the  project's \nincremental operating costs are sustainable. \n\nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n40. \nFinancial  management  and  procurement  capacity  assessments  found  that  while  MOE \nhas the capacity to carry out the project, it will encounter significant challenges. Of key concern \nis the large number (and cumulative size) of projects managed by MOE, including several ADB \nprojects, the World Bank's Second Education Development Project, and the recently approved \nmultidonor  Education  for  All  Fast  Track  Initiative.  Combined,  these  projects  will  place  further \nstrain  on  MOE's  ability  to  carry  out  procurement  and  disbursements  in  a  timely  and  effective \nmanner.  The  financial  management  assessment  identifies  lack  of  capacity  and  insufficient \nstaffing  in  the  accounting  and  financial  control  division  of  MOE's  Department  of  Finance  and \nfinancial information management system. Of particular concern is the lack of standardization in \nthe use of accounting software across different MOE projects.   \n \n41.  MOE indicates that it is addressing the capacity issue by increasing the number of staff \nin  its  accounting  and  financial  control  division.  It  has  created  several  new  positions  and  has \nalready filled some. The World Bank will be undertaking a financial management assessment of \nthe  education  sector  later  this  year.  The  project  will  provide  accounting  staff  for  the  project \nimplementation  unit;  train  staff  in  financial  planning,  accounting,  auditing,  and  control;  and \nimplement  a  performance-based  planning  and  budgeting  system  using  the  cost  norms  to  be \ndeveloped under the project. The financial management assessment is in the PAM.  \n \nThe  procurement  capacity  assessment  found  that  while  TVED  has  experience  in \n42. \nprocuring  goods,  it  lacks  experience  in  procuring  works  and  services.  The  project  will  provide \nsupport  to  supplement  procurement  capacity,  including  training  in  the  preparation  of  bid \ndocuments  for  civil  works  and  bid  evaluations,  and  site  management  and  monitoring  of  civil \nworks implementation.  \n \n\n                                                 \n9  Financial Analysis (Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n9\n\n43. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  MOE.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nfor \n\nGender and development. The project is designed to address key constraints to girls' \n44. \naccess to TVET and includes a GAP to facilitate and promote increased girls\u2019 participation and \nbenefits  from  the  project.  The  GAP  addresses  access  and  equity  issues  by  setting  gender \nquotas  for  training  in  the  three  nontraditional  priority  skill  areas,  dormitory  spaces,  voucher \nrecipients, and other training opportunities. The GAP includes the following targets and design \nfeatures:  (i)  quota  of  girls  making  up  20%  of  enrolments  in  three  nontraditional  priority  skill \nareas;  (ii)  25%  of  vouchers  reserved  for  girls;  (iii)  50%  of  dormitory  spaces  reserved  for  girls;  \n(iv) targets of women making up 20% of TVET teachers, and 40% of trainees in the specialist \nskill  contracting  program  and  50%  in  the  skills  contracting  program;  (v)  implementation  of  a \nwage  subsidy  scheme \nto  promote  poststudy \nemployment;  (vi)  social  marketing  to  promote  nontraditional  skills  and  trades  among  girls;  \n(vii)  provision  of  gender  training  to  stakeholders,  and  (viii)  development  of  monitoring  and \nevaluation indicators to track GAP implementation. \n \n45. \nEthnic groups. An ethnic group development plan was prepared to ensure integration of \nethnic  groups'  needs  and  interests  in  project  outputs,  and  ensure  ethnic  group  access  and \nparticipation. Key features include (i) ethnic group enrolment in certificate and diploma education \nin the four priority skill areas reaches 20%; (ii) at least 30% of vouchers and dormitory spaces are \nreserved for ethnic students; (iii) the social marketing campaign is targeted to ethnic communities \nto encourage TVET and present positive role models, especially in nontraditional skill areas; and \n(iv) ethnicity sensitivity training is provided to project stakeholders. \n \nD. \n\nfemale  voucher-recipient  graduates \n\nSafeguards \n\nThe involuntary resettlement category is C, as civil works is limited to upgrading TVET \n46. \ninstitution  facilities  and  constructing  new  buildings  within  existing  boundaries,  which  will  not \nrequire  land  acquisition  or  resettlement.  The  indigenous  peoples'  categorization  is  B,  as  the \nvoucher  program  and  the  construction  of  dormitories  will  directly  benefit  ethnic  groups.10  The \nenvironmental  categorization  is  C.  During  operation,  the  automotive  workshop  will  ensure \nproper disposal of hazardous waste such as engine oil. During construction of the dormitories, \nthe contractor will keep noise and dust within locally acceptable levels, as well as manage fill, \nexcavated  material,  and  solid  waste  in  a  manner  that  does  not  create  a  permanent  impact. \nWater supply in the dormitories will meet national drinking water quality standards.   \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n47.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.11  The  major  risks  are  that  the  government \nfails to keep its commitment to ESDF TVET targets, the supply of appropriately trained teachers \nis  not  adequate  to  improve  TVET  quality,  and  the  poor  social  perception  of  TVET  means  that \nemployers  and  potential  students  are  not  interested  in  TVET.  These  risks  are  all  addressed \nunder the project. In summary, the benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the risks. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n10 Ethnic Groups Development Plan (Appendix 2). \n11 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fTable 4: Summary Risks and Mitigating Measures \nMitigating Measures \n\n10 \n\nRisks \nOutcome \nFailure to keep commitments to \nESDF TVET targets \nInadequate supply of trained \nteachers will frustrate ability to \nimprove TVET  \nPoor social perception of TVET will \nlimit potential trainees' interest in \nvocational training  \n\nOutputs \nPrivate sector shows little interest in \nTVET sector development activities  \n\n \nThe project largely focuses on improving quality, not increasing \nTVET sector size. \nTeacher training, on-the-job training for teachers, and more \nflexible employment arrangements will help attract better \nteachers.  \nSocial marketing, improved quality, and the voucher program \nwill help increase demand for TVET-trained workers and \ntrainee interest in TVET.  \n \nEach trade working group will be provided with one person \nunder the project to assist in implementing project activities. \nIndustry associations provide a focal point to harness private \ninvolvement.  \nVast majority of project initiatives do not require passage of \nlegislation. \nThe government is already considering changes to strengthen \nNTC to increase private sector focus. \n\nFailure to introduce required legal \ninstruments to support TVET reforms  \nLack of political will to revamp NTC \nto be more private-sector focused \nESDF  =  Education  Sector  Development  Framework,  NTC  =  National  Training  Council,  TVET  =  technical  and \nvocational education and training. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n48. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the project will conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM \nand  grant  documents.  The  government  has  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the \nproject, which are set out in the grant agreement. \n \n49. \nADB will not disburse grant proceeds for the construction of dormitories or procurement \nof  equipment  for  any  given  public  TVET  institution  until  such  institution  has  established  an \nadvisory board and prepared an institutional improvement plan, both to the satisfaction of ADB.  \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n50. \nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the absence of the President, under the provision \nof  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the \ngrant not exceeding $23,000,000 to the Lao People's Democratic Republic from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds  resources  for  the  Strengthening  Technical  and  Vocational  Education  and  Training \nProject, on terms and conditions that are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft grant agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n\nC.
