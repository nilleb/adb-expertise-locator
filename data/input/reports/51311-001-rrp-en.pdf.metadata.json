As  the  country  starts  to  recover  from  the  severe \nimpacts of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, PPP will emerge as an important tool \nto  leverage  private  sector  resources  to  develop  infrastructure  and  create  jobs.  The  project \ncomprises a financial intermediation loan to support the Bangladesh Infrastructure Finance Fund \nLimited (BIFFL) in financing selected PPP subprojects,3 and TA to strengthen BIFFL\u2019s institutional \ncapacity and to support PPP project implementation. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n1. \n\nInfrastructure Gap Impedes Economic Development \n\n \n\nBangladesh\u2019s  recent  economic  development  has  been  strong.  Gross  domestic  product \n(GDP) grew at an average rate of 7.0% per annum during 2012\u20132019.4 Bangladesh is on track to \ngraduate  from  the  United  Nations\u2019  least-developed  countries  in  2024.5 Rapid  economic  growth \nhas  increased  the  demand  for  energy,  transportation,  and  urban  development.  However, \ninfrastructure development has yet to catch up, creating a bottleneck that prevents the economy \nfrom  reaching  its  full  potential.  The  World  Economic  Forum  highlighted  weaknesses  in  the \nenabling  environment  in  the  country,  particularly  with  infrastructure.  The  country  was  ranked \n114th out of 141 countries in terms of infrastructure in the 2019 Global Competitiveness Report.6 \nSignificant weaknesses  were  noted  in  road  infrastructure,  train  services,  seaport services,  and \nwater  utilities.  Easing  infrastructure  constraints  is  critical  to  improving  the  competitiveness  of \ndomestic industries and the overall efficiency of the economy. \n \n\n \n\nThe Government of Bangladesh has increased infrastructure investments since fiscal year \n(FY)2016.  According  to  the  government\u2019s  7th  Five  Year  Plan  (FY2016\u2013FY2020),  infrastructure \nfinance needs to reach 4.2% of GDP per annum, or about $14 billion (FY2019), to maintain the \ngrowth momentum. Since FY2016, gross fixed capital investment consistently accounted for more \nthan  30%  of  the  government  budget.  Nevertheless,  the  country\u2019s  mostly  public-sector-driven \ninfrastructure development is constrained by the resource availability as well as implementation \n\n \n\n1  The  Bangladesh  Infrastructure  Finance  Fund  Limited  (BIFFL)  is  an  eligible  financial  intermediary  per  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). 2003.

Among  key  indicators  under \ninfrastructure, road connectivity ranked 117, electricity access 108, and exposure to unsafe drinking water 136.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\ncapacities. The budget deficit was 5.5% of GDP in 2019, limiting further increases in infrastructure \ninvestments. Because of capacity constraints, many projects experienced implementation delays \nand cost overruns, resulting in reduced benefits from the projects. \n \n\n \n\nThe  infrastructure  sector  comprises  energy,  power,  transport,  urban,  education,  and \nhealth sectors.  More prominently, the  Strategic Transport Plan  2015\u20132035  proposes five mass \nrapid transit systems, two bus rapid transit systems, three ring roads, eight radial roads, and six \nexpressways, among others.7 According to the Revisiting The Power System Master Plan 2016, \nto meet up future demand and maintain reserve margin, the country\u2019s generation capacity needs \nto increase by 74.5 gigawatts from 2020 to 2041. From 2017 to 2025, an average investment of \n$9\u201310 billion per annum is needed, for aggregated generation, transmission, and related costs.8 \nThe  government  plans  also  call  for  increased  investments  in  economic  zones  and  the  urban, \nhealth, and tertiary education sectors. \n \n\n2. \n\nPublic\u2013Private  Partnership  Plays  a  Critical  Role \nDevelopment \n\nin \n\nInfrastructure \n\n \n\nInternational experience has shown that PPP is an effective tool to leverage private sector \nresources  to  address  the  public  investment  gap  in  infrastructure.  Aside  from  mitigating  the \ngovernment\u2019s fiscal constraints, with proper designs PPP can also serve to provide incentives for \nprivate  sector  participants  to  optimize  long-term  value  for  money  of  projects,  bring  greater \nefficiency in public service delivery, and introduce advanced technologies and business practices. \n \n\n \n\nRecognizing  the  great potential  of PPP, the  government has  mainstreamed  PPP  in  the \neconomic planning  process. Under this process, public  infrastructure  projects are (i) developed \nby line ministries and/or local governments; (ii) screened by the Bangladesh PPP Authority9 and \napproved by the Cabinet Committee for Economic Affairs, chaired by the minister of finance; (iii) \nfunded  by  the  PPP  Unit  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  (e.g.,  viability  gap  fund  or  other \navailability  payment support); and  (iv)  supported  by  external  transaction  advisers,  such  as  the \nOffice of Public\u2013Private Partnership (OPPP) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). In addition, \na  PPP  policy,  PPP  law,  viability  gap  fund  guidelines,  and  procurement  guidelines  have  been \ndeveloped  and  promulgated.  PPP  tool  kits  and  templates  of  legal  agreements  are  being \nis  also  demonstrated  through  the \ndeveloped.  The  government\u2019s  commitment \nestablishment of a separate PPP budget for loans and equity, viability gap funding, and TA. \n \n\nto  PPP \n\n \n\nThe government has envisioned that PPP will eventually support a substantial portion of \ninfrastructure  investments,  especially  in  the  transport  and  energy  sectors.  According  to  the \nseventh  five  year  plan,  PPP  investments  in  the  transport sector  alone  shall  reach  1%  of GDP. \nTotal investment needs in the energy sector are more than 2.5% of GDP per year, and one-third \nof that will also be from the private sector, primarily through PPPs. For the transport and energy \nsectors  alone,  the  total  demand  for  PPPs  is  up  to  $5  billion  per  year.  The  development of  the \neighth five year plan (FY2021\u2013FY2025) is yet to be completed, but the government has reaffirmed \nthat  the  PPP  initiative  will  be  a  crucial  long-term  strategy  in  developing  the  transport,  energy, \nurban, water, and information and communication technology sectors.10 As of February 2020, the \nPPP Authority had a pipeline of 72 projects with an estimated investment value of $22.7 billion at \n\n \n\n7  Government of Bangladesh. 2015.

Most of the PPP projects are in the transport, energy, and social \ninfrastructure sectors, which includes health care, economic zones, and tourism. \n  \n\n \n\nDespite  the  progress  made,  PPPs  have  yet to  deliver  on  their  full  potential.  During  the \nseventh five-year plan period, 16 PPP contracts totaling $4.9 billion were signed, which is below \nthe government target. PPP has gained some ground  in power sector, especially  in the private \nsector-led  independent  power  producer  subsector.  Large-scale  infrastructure  PPP  projects  in \nother  sectors  such  as  transport  have  yet  to  take  off.  The  main  constraints  are  the  lack  of \nexperience by line ministries to develop and structure large-scale complex PPP transactions and \nlack of long-term financing for large-scale PPP projects, especially in local currencies. 11        \n \n\n \n\nGovernment-established  public  sector  financing  companies.  To  channel  long-term \nfinancing  to  PPP  projects,  the  government  established  two  complementary  public  sector \ninfrastructure financial institutions: the Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL) in \n1997  and  BIFFL  in  2011.  IDCOL  lends  primarily  to  independent  power  producers  and  other \ninfrastructure subprojects developed  by private sector sponsors. BIFFL is mandated to provide \nlong-term  local  currency  debt  financing  to  subprojects  developed  by  public  sector  sponsoring \nagencies, such as the Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges; the Ministry of Shipping; and the \nMinistry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources.12 As a nonbank financial institution fully owned \nby  the  MOF,  BIFFL  was  established  as  an  integral  part  of  the  PPP  development  institutions, \ntogether with the PPP Authority and the PPP Unit of the MOF. \n \n\n3. \n\nCOVID-19 Highlights Greater Importance of Public\u2013Private Partnerships \n\n \n\n \n\nImpact on the economy and jobs. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact \non  the  economy  of  Bangladesh.  The  International  Monetary  Fund  projects  that  the  country\u2019s \neconomic growth will weaken to 3.8% in FY2020, which would be the slowest growth rate since \n2002.  ADB  estimated  that  1.4  million\u20133.7  million  workers  may  lose  their  jobs  and  13.0  million \npeople  may  fall  back  into  poverty.  The  implementation  of  infrastructure  projects  is  severely \naffected by the disruption to imports of machinery and materials, as well as by work stoppages. \n \n\n \n\nInfrastructure  development  will  play  an  important  role  in  the  economic  recovery. \nThe economy  after the pandemic  will continue to face many challenges, with most economists \nexpecting  a  U-shaped  recovery.  The  traditional  economic  growth  drivers,  such  as  domestic \nconsumption  and  exports,  are  expected  to  remain  weak  for  an  extended  period.  Therefore,  in \naddition to its long-term economic benefits, infrastructure development will become a key driver \nin  boosting  aggregate  demand  and  accelerating  the  revival  of  economic  activity.  Infrastructure \ndevelopment is also important for job creation, as construction tends to have a large employment \nmultiplier  effect  and  provides  jobs  for  the  poor.  Further,  the  pandemic  highlighted  significant \ndeficiencies in the country\u2019s health care system which will lead to increased investment needs in \nmedical infrastructure, such as hospitals and testing facilities. \n \n\n \n\n11 The lack of long-term taka funds is caused  by a number  of factors: (i)  government securities  and national saving \ncertificates, which have high returns, crowd out potential corporate or project bond issues; (ii) institutional investors \ncannot invest in corporate and project bonds because of regulatory restrictions; and (iii) limited secondary market \ntrading  prevents  the  development  of  benchmark  yield  curves.  For  details,  refer to the  problem  tree  in the  Sector \nAssessment (Summary): Finance (Infrastructure Finance and Investment Funds) (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n12 However, because of the limited PPP pipeline in the past, BIFFL has also been lending to non-PPP infrastructure \nand industrial projects similar to those funded by IDCOL. The project intends to support to refocus BIFFL to its core \nmandate of lending to support major infrastructure PPP projects developed by line ministries. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIncreased  importance  of  public\u2013private  partnerships  in  the  context  of  COVID-19. \nBecause  of  the  pandemic,  the  government  has  come  under  increasing  fiscal  pressures.  In \nFY2020,  the  budget  deficit  is  expected  to  remain  elevated  at  5.5%  of  GDP  because  of  sharp \nrevenue reduction and escalating expenditures for health care, social protection, and economic \nstimulus.  The  tight fiscal  conditions  are  expected  to  continue  into  FY2021.  Budgetary  priorities \nwill focus on public health, food security, and social protection.  Per World Bank estimate, fixed \ncapital investment by the government is expected to decline from $8.4 billion in FY2019 to $5.7 \nbillion in FY2020 and $4.5 billion in FY2021.13 In this context, PPP will take on added significance \nin complementing public financing to support infrastructure development. Further, considering the \nimpact of the pandemic, investment on health care is expected to increase, and a major portion \nof this investment is expected to be funded by the private sector through PPPs. \n \n\n4. \n\nThe  Project  is  Part  of  ADB\u2019s  Long-Term  Engagement  on  Public\u2013Private \nPartnership \n\n \n\nADB\u2019s past assistance. ADB has provided extensive support to the government for PPP \ndevelopment.  First,  during  2010\u20132014, ADB  TA  helped  Bangladesh  establish  PPP  institutions, \npolicies, and funding  mechanisms, including the PPP Authority, the  PPP  Unit of the  MOF, and \nBIFFL. 14  Second,  ADB\u2019s  OPPP  has  been  working  closely  with  the  PPP  Authority,  with  the \nassistance of ADB\u2019s Asia\u2013Pacific Project Preparation Facility,15 to provide support in relation to \nsector  reforms;  subproject  due  diligence  (e.g.,  financial,  economic,  technical,  legal,  and \nsafeguards); and roadshows, data rooms, and other bid preparation activities. With the expanding \nOPPP  transaction  advisory  mandates  to  help  the  PPP  Authority  tender  PPP  subprojects, \nespecially in roads and health care, a list of bankable PPP subprojects is being prepared.16 Third, \nADB has implemented three capital market development programs to Bangladesh\u2014in 1997, 2012, \nand 2015\u2014to address the lack of  a long-term commercial debt market in the  country.17 Fourth, \nADB has successfully supported IDCOL through three assistance programs\u2014approved in 2008, \n2013, and 2017\u2014to extend long-term infrastructure project loans.18 \n \n\n \n\nThe  need  for  support.  Given  BIFFL\u2019s  clear  mandate  to  finance  PPP  infrastructure \nprojects,  supporting  BIFFL  will  be  an  important  and  integral  component  of  ADB\u2019s  holistic \nassistance to the government\u2019s PPP strategy. BIFFL  is still a relatively  new financial  institution \nwith  limited  operational  history  and  experience  working  with  development  partners.  On  the \ntechnical  side,  there  is  a  need  to  strengthen  BIFFL\u2019s  institutional  capacity  to  appraise  PPP \ninfrastructure projects and assume credit risk, while facilitating the participation of local financial \ninstitutions. On the funding side, constrained by the lack of access to long-term financing, BIFFL\u2019s \ninvestments are  mainly  equity funded, and the very low  leverage on its  balance sheet  limits  its \nability to support more long-term infrastructure projects. Access to long-term financing is critical \nfor BIFFL to expand its operations. Going forward, BIFFL plans to mobilize $500 million of long-\nterm debt from development assistance, and attempt bond issuances to raise local currency funds. \nBIFFL  has  made  modest  progress  on  this  front,  recently  securing  funding  from  the  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency (JICA) for energy efficiency projects. But BIFFL is still in need \n\n \n\n13 World Bank. 2020.The cursed blessing of public banks. Washington, DC. \n14 ADB.

Together  with  IDCOL\u2019s  loan  portfolio  of  $498  million  and  leveraged  commercial \nfinancing,  the  total  financing  amounted  to  only  $2.8  billion.  BIFFL  is  building  a  promising  PPP \nsubproject pipeline, supported by the PPP Authority, ADB\u2019s project team, and ADB\u2019s OPPP (see \ndetailed  subproject  assessment  in  para.  23  and  the  PPP  subproject  pipeline  under  the  PPP \nAuthority  referenced  in  footnote  16).  With  this  backdrop,  the  demand  for  funds  from  emerging \nPPP subprojects may potentially increase, exceeding the $50 million loan to BIFFL. Should such \nfunding  requirements  materialize,  and  if  the  current  project  is  on  track  for  successful \nimplementation, ADB will consider providing additional financing to support these subprojects. \n \n\n \n\nADB\u2019s strategic context and policy framework. The project will help ease Bangladesh\u2019s \ninfrastructure  financing  constraint, a  priority  area  in  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2016\u2013\n2020 for Bangladesh,19 and it is included in the country operations business plan, 2020\u20132022.20 \nThe project is well aligned with the operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.21 The project will \nhelp to alleviate poverty by creating jobs during both the construction and operation phases of the \ninfrastructure projects, especially for many low-skilled workers (Operational Priority 1). The project \nwill  help  strengthen  governance  and  the  institutional  capacity  of  BIFFL(Operational  Priority  6), \ntackle  climate  change  by  supporting  the  development  of  more  efficient  and  environmentally \nsustainable  infrastructure  projects  (Operational  Priority  3),  and  support  gender  equality  by \nincorporating  gender  elements  in  project  implementation  and  capacity  building  activities \n(Operational Priority 2). Moreover, in line with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, the project will help mobilize \nprivate  sector  financing  and  promote  private  sector  development.  Finally,  to  deliver  integrated \nsolutions, the project will promote cross-sector, cross-theme, and cross-department collaboration. \nThe project was  processed  with support and consultation from OPPP  during  the  design stage; \nthe  subproject  pipeline  was  developed  based  on  existing  and  future  OPPP  transactions.  By \nconnecting  the  regional  department\u2019s  financing  to  OPPP\u2019s  transaction  advisory  mandates,  the \nproject aims to deliver seamless support to the government\u2019s PPP strategy under the One ADB \napproach. \n \nB. \n \n\nProject Description \n\n \n\nThe  project  will  support  the  government\u2019s  efforts  in  strengthening  BIFFL\u2019s  institutional \ncapacity  to  develop  PPP  infrastructure  projects.  The  support  will  help  to  restart  infrastructure \ndevelopment, spur economic growth, and generate jobs during the recovery from the COVID-19.  \n \n\n \n\nThe project is aligned with the following impact: investment in infrastructure development \nincreased (footnote 5). The project will have the following outcomes: PPP infrastructure projects \nincreased,  and  new  employment  opportunities  created.22 The  outputs  are  (i)  long-term  debt to \ninfrastructure  subprojects  provided  and  (ii)  BIFFL\u2019s  institutional  capacity  to  finance  PPP \ninfrastructure projects improved. \n \n\n \n\n19 ADB. 2016.

Through this output, BIFFL will provide long-term local currency financing for qualified \nPPP  infrastructure  subprojects.  ADB  financing  will  also  leverage  additional  private  sector \ninvestments in infrastructure project development.  \n \n\n \n\nTo be eligible for financing, subprojects must be developed by the PPP Authority and meet \nsubproject  eligibility  criteria  including  private  sector  ownership  of  the  infrastructure  being \ndeveloped, commercial viability, economic return, technical efficiency and compliance with ADB \nenvironmental and social safeguard requirements. Use of ADB financing for any subproject will \nbe subject to pre-approval by ADB to confirm satisfaction of the eligibility criteria. To manage risks \nand establish best practices, unless otherwise agreed, the first subprojects will be selected from \nPPP subprojects developed with the support of OPPP through its advisory services. \n \n\n \n\nOutput 2: Bangladesh Infrastructure Finance Fund Limited\u2019s institutional capacity \nto finance public\u2013private partnership infrastructure projects improved. The TA will (i) review \nand  update  BIFFL\u2019s  business  strategy,  (ii)  develop  a  comprehensive  capacity  building  plan  for \nBIFFL,  (iii)  strengthen  the  BIFFL  safeguard  unit  and  mainstream  safeguard  principles, and  (iv) \nsupport the implementation of ADB-funded subprojects while providing hands-on training for the \nstaff. Overall, the TA will increase the capacity of BIFFL to screen, process, fund, and implement \nPPP  infrastructure  projects. It  is  expected  that  at  least two  PPP  projects  will  be  reviewed  and \napproved  by  2024,  putting  BIFFL  on  a  sustainable  path  to  achieve  its  mandate  to  support \ninfrastructure development. \n \n\n \n\nSubproject pipeline. For the  initial subproject pipeline, ADB and  BIFFL  have identified \nthe Dhaka Bypass Project and Rampura\u2013Amulia\u2013Demra Road Project, and OPPP has acted as \na  transaction  advisor  for  both.  The  concession  agreement  for  the  Dhaka  Bypass  Project  was \nsigned  in  December  2018  and  the  financial  closure  is  expected  by  August  2020.  The  Dhaka \nBypass  Expressway  Development  Company  is  requesting  a  $122  million-equivalent  taka  loan \nfrom  BIFFL, for  which  the  preliminary  term  sheet has  been  signed. For  the  Rampura\u2013Amulia\u2013\nDemra Road Project, bids for the concession were submitted in July 2019 and the preferred bidder \nhas been selected with preliminary terms of contract signed. BIFFL is in discussion with the project \ncompany over a local currency financing  of $88 million. ADB\u2019s OPPP continues to develop other \nPPP projects, especially in the health sector, that may lead to additional pipeline subprojects. In \nDecember  2019,  ADB,  the  PPP  Authority,  and  the  Directorate  General  of  Health  Services \nexecuted  a  triparty  memorandum  of  understanding,  in  which  future  PPP  projects  in  medical \ndiagnostics  and  dialysis  centers  have  been  outlined  for  implementation  in  2020\u20132022. \nFurthermore,  increased  demand  in  the  health  care  industry  is  expected  as  a  result  of  the \npandemic. \n \nC. \n \n\nValue Added by ADB \n\n \n\nThe project will (i) provide critically needed capacity development and long-term funding \nto  help  BIFFL  sustain  and  expand  its  lending  operations  to  PPP  infrastructure  projects,  (ii) \ncatalyze  greater  private  sector  commercial  infrastructure  financing  and  investment,  and  (iii) \nfacilitate the financial closure of the first few large PPP infrastructure subprojects to help the rollout \nof the government\u2019s PPP strategy. Despite the relatively small loan amount, the project will help \nstrengthen BIFFL\u2019s institutional capacity and sustain its future PPP infrastructure project lending \ncapacity,  including  the  introduction  of  international  best  practices  in  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards. On the funding side, taka-denominated long-term loans from BIFFL will help minimize \nthe foreign exchange risk of PPP infrastructure projects, which will enhance the economic viability \nof the projects. As the country is trying to recover from the impact of COVID-19, ADB\u2019s support \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fwill  provide  a  much-needed  boost  to  the  country\u2019s  PPP  initiative  to  promote  infrastructure \ndevelopment. Based on the experiences gained from the long-term partnership with IDCOL and \nthe Indian Infrastructure Finance Company Limited,23 the project design prioritized and advanced \nthe institutional capacity development and subproject review to improve overall readiness. \n \nD. \n \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n \n\nThe government has requested a regular loan of $50 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period \nof 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year to be capitalized in \nthe loan; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \n\n \n\nADB  loan  proceeds  are  intended  to  fund  up  to  30%  of  the  total  cost  of  subprojects  to \nmaximize the leveraging of commercial finance. The project will leverage at least 20% of the total \nsubproject costs from private sector equity and the remainder from other commercial borrowing. \nNo more than 20% of the total loan amount will be used for retroactive financing, which could be \nused for refinancing costlier loans or loans with shorter maturities on eligible subprojects.24 \n \n\nSourcea \nAsian Development Bank  \n \n\nOrdinary capital resources (regular loan) \nTotal \n\n \n50.0 \n50.0 \n\nShare of Total (%) \n\n \n\n100.0 \n100.0 \n\nTable 1: Summary Financing Plan \nAmount ($ million) \n\na Additional sources of financing will include private sector equity and commercial borrowing, the respective amounts \nof which will be determined individually for each subproject.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n \n\nRelending.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  relent  by  the  government  to  BIFFL  through  a \nsubsidiary  loan  agreement  in  compliance  with  the  loan  agreement  between  ADB  and  the \ngovernment. The subsidiary loan will be denominated in taka and mirror ADB loan in tenor and \ngrace period. The relending rate will be guided by MOF relending rates for public investments.25 \n \n\n \n\nOnlending.  BIFFL will onlend the loan proceeds through subloans to qualified enterprises \ncarrying  out eligible  subprojects. The  subloans  will  be  commercially  priced  and  reflect BIFFL\u2019s \ncost of funds and subproject-specific risks. The funding support will leverage additional private \nsector investments including foreign direct investments to infrastructure projects. \n \nE. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\nThe  Finance  Division  of  the  MOF  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  BIFFL  will  be  the \nimplementing agency. The implementation period will be 4 years from 2020 to 2024. BIFFL will \nestablish  a project management unit with staffing  and other resources satisfactory to ADB and \nensure  compliance  with  the  project  implementation  requirements  stipulated  in  the  project \nadministration manual (PAM)26 and legal agreements. The implementation will also be guided by \nthe environmental and social management system (ESMS) arrangement.  \n\n \n\n23 Lessons from Other ADB Financial Intermediation Loans to Support Infrastructure Development (accessible from the \n\nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n24 Incurred before loan effectiveness but not more than 12 months before the signing of the loan agreement. \n25 Recent MOF relending rates for funds from development partners to BIFFL have been fixed rates in the range of 1\u2013\n\n2%. \n\n26 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 2 and described in detail in \n\n8 \n\nthe PAM. \n \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nEstimated loan closing date \nManagement \n\n(i)  Executing agency \n(ii) \n(iii)  Implementation unit \n\nImplementing agency \n\nProcurement \n\nRetroactive Financing \n\nDisbursement \n\nTable 2: Implementation Arrangements \nArrangements \n\nAugust 2020\u2013August 2024 \n31 August 2024 \n28 February 2025 \n\nMinistry of Finance (Finance Division) \nBIFFL  \nThe  project  management  unit  within  BIFFL  will  have  five  full-time  staff  who  will \ncarry  out  the  implementation  of  the  project.  The  unit  will  also  be  supported  by \ntechnical experts funded by the technical assistance and BIFFL funds. \nThe  subborrowers  will  follow  the  established  private  sector  or  commercial \npractices in procuring goods and services using the proceeds of the loan, in line \nwith the core principles of the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from \ntime to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time), and in a manner acceptable to ADB. \nRetroactive financing will be provided to subprojects that were approved by ADB \nfor expenses incurred by the subborrowers not more than 12 months prior to the \ndate  of  the  loan  agreement.  The  subprojects  must  meet  the  same  subproject \neligibility criteria set out in this report and recommendation of the President and \nthe PAM (footnote 26). The total amount of retroactive financing will not exceed \n20% of the loan amount. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  following  ADB's  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  detailed  arrangements \nagreed between the Finance Division of the Ministry of Finance, and BIFFL and \nADB. \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  BIFFL  =  Bangladesh  Infrastructure  Finance  Fund  Limited,  PAM  =  Project\nAdministration Manual. \nSources: ADB, BIFFL, and Ministry of Finance. \n \n\n \n\nCOVID-19  impact  on  implementation.  The  government  gradually  lifted  closures  and \nmovement restrictions since  31  May 2020. Logistical issues and work stoppages have delayed \nall infrastructure projects for 3\u20134 months. PPP subprojects under consideration for the project will \nproceed as planned. These are all long-term projects where the private sector has entered with a \nlong-term  view  of risks  and  returns  through  multiple  economic  cycles.  The  pandemic  does  not \nalter the economics of the road projects or cost estimates. For the Dhaka bypass subproject, after \n3 months  of delays both the  government and the  project company  are eager to  move forward, \nwith  the  financial  closure  in  August  2020.  For  the  country,  PPP  road  subprojects  such  as  the \nDhaka  Bypass  Project  bring  in  much-needed  private  sector  investments  and  provide  jobs  for \nmany non-skilled workers at a time of economic slowdown. Further, the pandemic has highlighted \nthe  importance and  enhanced the feasibility  of health sector  projects in the  government\u2019s  PPP \npipelines. \n \n\nIII. \n\n ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n\nTA is attached to the project to help BIFFL improve its institutional capacity and to support \nproject implementation. The TA is estimated to cost $650,000, which will be financed on a grant \nbasis  by  the  Financial  Sector  Development  Partnership  Special  Fund. 27  TA  funds  will  be \ndisbursed  in  accordance  with  the  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  All  consultants  shall  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  the  ADB \nProcurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and associated project administration \n\n27 Financing partner: the Government of Luxembourg. Administered by ADB. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\finstructions  and  TA  staff  instructions.  The  TA  will  support  (i)  corporate  strategy  review  and \ndevelopment;  (ii)  capacity  development  assessment  and  development,  including  in  funding, \ntreasury  operations,  PPP,  and  credit  and  risk  management;  (iii)  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards; and (iv) ADB project implementation. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n\n \n\nADB\u2019s due  diligence consists of detailed country, macroeconomic, infrastructure sector, \nand BIFFL operational assessments to ensure the success of this project. In particular, ADB has \nconducted  a  comprehensive  assessment  of  BIFFL\u2019s  operational  capacities  in  terms  of  deal \norigination,  credit  risk  assessment,  treasury  and  funding, human  resources,  and  other  internal \nprocesses and procedures, and found them to be adequate to operate commercially. Since BIFFL \nhas no prior experience in implementing ADB-funded projects, the TA will be crucial in enhancing \nits capacity  in safeguards and compliance. Integrity due diligence has  been conducted, and no \nsignificant or potential integrity risks were identified. \n \nA. \n \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\n \n\nADB guidelines stipulate  that the most important criteria for determining the standing  of \nfinancial  intermediaries  are  capital  adequacy,  asset  quality,  management  quality,  earnings, \nliquidity, and sensitivity to market risk, or the CAMELS rating model.28 BIFFL has demonstrated \nsatisfactory ratings on these indicators. However, ADB\u2019s evaluation confirmed that BIFFL\u2019s capital \nstructure  is  underleveraged,  which  depressed  both  lending  volume  and  earnings.  BIFFL\u2019s \noperational performance can be improved with higher leverage, particularly with more long-term \ndebt. Since most of the likely future PPP subprojects are in the road subsector, an analysis of the \neconomic  viability  of  recent  completed  road  projects  in  Bangladesh  financed  by  ADB  was \nconducted.  The  analysis  showed  satisfactory  economic  internal  rates  of  return  ranging  from \n17.5%  to  28.6%.  Economic  returns  of  each  subproject will  be  evaluated  during  the  subproject \napproval process when all required information becomes available. After the onset of the COVID-\n19  pandemic,  some  PPP  projects  have  experienced  delays  in  financial  closure  because  of \nshutdowns, but  most of the PPP  infrastructure projects will continue to be  implemented. Long-\nterm  infrastructure  projects  under  consideration  are  expected  to  generate  economic  returns \nacross economic cycles and are often used as a tool of countercyclical stimulus. \n \nB. \n \n\nSustainability \n\n \n\nThe  project  is  expected  to  enhance  the  sustainability  of  BIFFL\u2019s  operations,  both \nfinancially  and  institutionally,  as  the  ADB  loan  will  provide  long-term  debt  to  sustain  BIFFL\u2019s \ncapital structure and funding, and the TA will provide institutional capacity building to help BIFFL \nexpand  its operations in a sustainable manner.  ADB\u2019s long-term funds will help BIFFL mobilize \ngreater  private  sector  finance  and  facilitate  infrastructure  and  PPP  sector  development.  The \nsupply of long-term ADB funds to the Bangladesh financial system will also give rise to additional \nappetite  for  similar  long-term  debt  instruments  and  facilitate  the  development  of  the  long-term \nbond  market.  The  environmental  and  social  safeguards  and  other  international  best  practices \nestablished under the TA will help BIFFL gain better access to additional development assistance \nfrom other international lenders in PPP infrastructure projects. \n \n\n28 ADB.  2005.  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects.  Manila  (Section  6.4.  Assessing  FI  Performance). \n\nFollowing the CAMELS framework, a financial institution is assessed by its Capital adequacy, Assets quality, \nManagement quality, Earnings and Liquidity.  \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nC. \n \n\nGovernance \n\n \n\nAs  a  fully  government-owned  public  sector  financial  institution,  BIFFL  has  a  strong \ngovernance structure. The board  of  directors  includes nine members, with the secretary of the \nFinance Division (MOF) as the chair. Among the board members are the secretary of the Prime \nMinister\u2019s Office; the secretary of the Ministry of Power, Energy, and Mineral Resources; and the \nsecretary  of  the  Ministry  of  Road  Transport  and  Bridges.  BIFFL  plans  to  appoint  an  additional \nindependent  board  member  from  the  private  sector.  Critical  committees\u2014such  as  the  audit \ncommittee,  management  committee,  credit  risk  management  committee,  and  asset\u2013liability \nmanagement committee\u2014have been established and are functioning well. \n \n\n \n\nFinancial  management.  BIFFL  has  established  well-defined  financial  management \nprocedures and guidelines and is compliant with Bangladesh Financial Reporting Standards and \nBangladesh  Accounting  Standards.  BIFFL  has  qualified  staff  in  accounting, finance, asset and \nliability  management, internal controls and audits, and reporting functions. BIFFL has had prior \nexperience implementing projects with  international  lenders such as JICA and the World  Bank, \nthrough which its financial management capacity has been evaluated and enhanced. The overall \nfinancial management control risk is moderate. \n \n\n \n\nProcurement  and  disbursement.  BIFFL  will  monitor  the  subproject  procurement  by \nfollowing the ADB  Procurement Policy (2017, as amended  from time  to time)  and Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). All PPP subprojects are \nrequired  to  undergo  a  bidding  process,  in  accordance  with  the  government\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines for PPP Projects, 2018.29 BIFFL will also require concessionaires to ensure that prices \nare reasonable and that relevant factors, e.g., time of delivery, efficiency, reliability, and suitability \nfor the subproject, are considered. The recommended project procurement classification is B. \n \n\n \n\nAnticorruption  policy.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and BIFFL. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n \n\nThe  project will  increase  Bangladesh\u2019s  infrastructure  investments  to  improve  access  to \npublic services, create jobs, enhance economic efficiency, and reduce poverty in subproject areas \nand in the country. The construction and future operation and maintenance work could potentially \nprovide  direct  local  employment  benefits,  including  to  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups  in  the \nsubproject construction  areas.  The  project will  ensure  social  safeguard  compliance  in  terms  of \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  indigenous  people\u2019s  policy,  core  labor  standards,  and  Bangladesh\u2019s \nlabor legislation. Women  will benefit from the project through capacity  development of  BIFFL\u2019s \nstaff  under  the  TA  or  schemes  to  improve  women\u2019s  access  to  local  labor  market opportunities \nfrom the infrastructure subprojects funded by BIFFL. \n \nE. \n \n\nSafeguards \n\n \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  (SPS),  the  project\u2019s \n\nsafeguard categories are as follows:30 \n \n\n29 Government of Bangladesh. 2018. Procurement Guidelines for PPP Projects, 2018. Dhaka. \n30  ADB. Safeguard Categories.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nEnvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples (category FI). The \nproject is classified category FI for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \nUnder  the  project,  BIFFL  will  consider  PPP  infrastructure  subprojects  screened  by  the  PPP \nAuthority and as advised by ADB\u2019s OPPP. These subprojects may include roads and highways \nwith potential significant environmental and social impacts. Screening and review of subprojects \nto be considered by BIFFL will follow the procedures indicated in the ESMS arrangement, which \nis  based  on  ADB\u2019s  SPS.  The  ESMS  arrangement  has  been  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  as \nrequired by ADB\u2019s SPS and Access to Information Policy 2018. \n \n\n \n\nGiven the nature of the subprojects, some could potentially be category A for environment \nand/or involuntary resettlement. Subprojects that may be category  A for indigenous peoples will \nbe avoided. In case this cannot be avoided, the ESMS arrangement provides guidance on how \nto  conduct  due  diligence  and  mitigate  potential  risks.  The  safeguard  categorization  of  the \nsubprojects  recommended  by  BIFFL  will  be  reviewed  and  cleared  by  ADB  before  subproject \napproval  to  ensure  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  SPS.  The  environmental  impact  assessment,  the \nresettlement plan, and the indigenous peoples plan will also be reviewed by ADB to ensure that \nthey are compliant with ADB\u2019s SPS. \n \n\n \n\nADB reviewed the institutional capacity of BIFFL in managing potential environmental and \nsocial  impacts  associated  with  the  subprojects.  Currently,  BIFFL  has  designated  staff  who \noversee  the  environmental  and  social  safeguards  of  their  projects  and  are  supported  by \nenvironmental consultants engaged for projects with the World Bank and JICA. Since this will be \nthe first ADB project for BIFFL, its staff received SPS training conducted by ADB in August 2019.31 \nThe  institutional  capacity  building  of  BIFFL  on  environmental  and  social  safeguards  (including \nlabor  management)  will  be  further  supported  by  the  TA.  The  TA  will  provide  the  necessary \ncapacity development and technical support to improve the structure and implementation of the \nESMS  arrangement  and  eventually  integrate  them  into  the  BIFFL\u2019s  institutional  environmental \nand social safeguard management framework. BIFFL has demonstrated commitment to working \nwith ADB in meeting the requirements of its SPS and following other international best practices \nin managing environmental and social risk impacts of identified subprojects. \n \n\n \n\nClimate change risk assessment. Subprojects that will be considered for ADB funding \nwill be reviewed on their climate change risk which could be low, medium, or high. Subprojects to \nbe considered will not be expected to have medium or high climate change risk. If these cannot \nbe avoided, a climate change assessment report with climate adaptation/mitigation  options  will \nbe included and will be cleared by ADB before subproject approval. \n \n\n \n\nFollowing the process for financial intermediation loans, climate adaptation and mitigation \nbenefits  can  be  estimated  only  upon  ADB\u2019s  realization  of  each  subproject  financing.  If  all \nsubprojects are in the roads and highways subsector, the climate adaptation and mitigation impact \nwill be limited to about 10% of the total ADB project cost incurred in raising road levels, improving \ndrainage systems, and/or additional slope protection. \n \nF. \n \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  3  and  described  in \n\ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.32 \n\n31 Trainings  on  safeguards  at  resident  missions  are  supported  by  ADB.  2013.

ADB will provide technical assistance to \nstrengthen BIFFL\u2019s institutional capacity, including environmental, \nsocial, and labor practices safeguards. \nADB will improve communications with government counterparts \nthrough regular dialogues and review missions. \n\nAt the implementing agency level, ADB will carry out capacity \ndevelopment to strengthen BIFFL\u2019s risk management and \noperations. ADB OPPP\u2019s transaction advisory service will help \ndevelop well-structured subprojects with appropriate risk-sharing \nmechanisms to mitigate external shocks.
