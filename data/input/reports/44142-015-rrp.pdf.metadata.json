The new loan will be used to prepare railway and road projects in \nBangladesh that are part of the Trans-Asia Railway network and the Asian Highway network. It \nwill  also  support  the  executing  agencies  during  initial  project  implementation.  The  additional \nfinancing is being processed based on the government\u2019s request, as it is not included in ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan for Bangladesh, 2015\u20132017.3 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nBangladesh  has  the  potential  to  become  a  transport  and  transshipment  center  for  the \n3. \nsubregion. It borders India and Myanmar, and is close to the landlocked countries of Bhutan and \nNepal. Bangladesh has taken many steps to strengthen its regional and international transport \nconnectivity.  With  the  Bhangabandhu  Bridge  over  River  Jamuna  (the  Jamuna  Multipurpose \nBridge)  and  the  provision  of  access  to  Mongla  and  Chittagong  ports  for  Bhutan,  India,  and \nNepal, the main transport corridors in Bangladesh, such as the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong corridor, can \nfacilitate  trade  between  Bangladesh  and  the  northeastern  states  of  India,  the  Indian  state  of \nWest  Bengal,  Bhutan,  and  Nepal.  This  increases  the  potential  to  attract  more  foreign  and \ndomestic investments. Bangladesh is located on major international trade corridors, as identified \nin  the  South  Asia  Association  for  Regional  Cooperation  (SAARC)  Regional  Multimodal \nTransport  Study  (SRMTS) 4  and  those  projects  linking  South  Asia  with  Southeast  Asian \ncountries,  the  Asia  Highway  network,  and  the  Trans-Asian  Railway  network.  However,  the \namount of regional trade within South Asia is much smaller than in other similar regions. One of \nthe  main  reasons  for  the  limited  cross-border  traffic  are  missing  links  and  congestion  in  main \ndomestic  corridors,  which  do  not  allow  operating  additional  domestic  and  international  traffic. \nAddressing the capacity deficiencies in the domestic transport network and constructing missing \nlinks  will  enable  Bangladesh  to  benefit  more  from  international  trade  and  will  support  the \ncountry\u2019s economic development. \n \n4. \nThe  current  TA  loan  was  approved  on  3  November  2010  and  became  effective  on  21 \nJuly 2011. It has demonstrated that the project readiness of follow-on road and railway projects \nin  Bangladesh  has  improved.  The  preparation  of  projects  under  the  current  TA  loan  has  also \nhelped  to  attract  financing  for  follow-on  transport  projects  by  other  development  partners.  The \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB.  2010.

Manila.  \n\n\f2 \n\ncurrent TA loan has been used to prepare design for two loans approved by ADB in 20125 and \n2014. 6  The  design  prepared  under  the  current  TA  Loan  has  generated  interest  from  the \ngovernments  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  Japan  to  finance  two  railway  projects  in \nBangladesh. \n \nThe rating of the current TA loan is \u201con-track\u201d; despite initial delays, it is rated \u201con-track\u201d \n5. \nsince the second quarter of 2013. As of 20 August 2015, contracts for $21.8 million equivalent\u2014\nor 99% of the loan amount of $22.1 million equivalent\u2014had been awarded and the cumulative \ndisbursement  was  $18.6  million  equivalent  (84%).  The  original  loan  closing  date  of  31 \nDecember 2013 was extended to 31 December 2015 to allow for the completion of the design \nand  to  provide  sufficient  time  to  support  the  executing  agencies  during  initial  project \nimplementation,  especially  during  procurement  for  follow-on  transport  projects  and  safeguards \nimplementation. Loan covenants and safeguard requirements are being complied with. \n \n6. \nUnder  the  current  TA  loan,  one  of  the  follow-on  railway  projects  will  require  continued \nprocurement support in 2015. Therefore, the loan closing date for the current TA loan needs to \nbe extended until 30 June 2016. \n \n7. \nThe proposed additional financing will support change in project scope by scaling up the \ncurrent  project  to  cover  additional  8  road  projects  with  a  total  route  length  of  600  km  and  4 \nrailway  projects  with  a  total  route  length  of  295 km.  The  additional  financing  will  help  prepare \ndomestic transport projects with high impact on regional trade ready for investment. It will also \nsupport the government during initial project implementation. \n \nThe  implementation  of  the  current  TA  loan  is  considered  highly  successful,  and  the \n8. \ngovernment  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  additional  financing  to  increase  the  benefits  and \nprepare  for  the  implementation  of  additional  high-priority  transport  projects  with  subregional \nimpact.  The  implementation  of  these  projects  is  expected  to  be  financed  under  (i)  the \nmultitranche  financing  facility  for  the  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation  (SASEC) \nRailway Connectivity Investment Program, scheduled for approval in 2016; and (ii) the SASEC \nRoad and Trade Facilitation Investment Program, scheduled for approval on a standby basis in \n2017.  Both  investment  programs  are  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan  for \nBangladesh (footnote 3). \n \n9. \nThe  additional  financing  supports  key  thematic  drivers  of  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership \nstrategy  for  Bangladesh,  2011\u20132015:  (i)  good  governance  and  capacity  development,  (ii) \nregional  cooperation,  (iii)  environmental  sustainability  and  climate  resilience,  and  (iv) \npartnerships.7 Investments in key domestic corridors with high regional impact were identified as \npriorities  for  the  transport  sector  and  are  in  line  with  the  government\u2019s  strategies  for  the \ntransport sector development. \n \n\n                                                \n5  ADB. 2012.

The  focus  will  be  on  priority  transport \ncorridors  identified  in  the  SRMTS,  Asian  Highway  network,  Trans-Asia  Railway  network,  and \nthose projects linking South Asia with Southeast Asia. At a meeting in Kathmandu, Nepal on 4 \nNovember  2014,  the  SASEC  Transport  and  Trade  Facilitation  Working  Group  endorsed  the \npreparation of these priority subregional transport projects. The additional financing will scale-up \nthe preparation of feasibility studies and detailed design as well as provision of implementation \nsupport in order to prepare additional 8 road projects with a total route length of 600 km and 4 \nrailway projects with a total route length of 295 km. A list of the transport projects to be prepared \nunder this loan is in attachment B of the project administration manual (PAM). 10 Any additional \ntransport projects to be financed under additional financing will be selected based on the criteria \ndescribed in attachment B of the PAM. \n \nD. \n \n14. \n \n\nThe overall facility is estimated to cost $63.59 million (Table 1). \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nCurrent \nAmounta \n\nAdditional \nFinancingb \n\n  \n \n\nTotal \n\nConsulting Services \na.

All \nconsultants will be recruited using quality- and cost-based selection, with a quality\u2013cost ratio of \n90:10,  taking  into  account  the  complexity  of  the  large-scale  design  works.  To  avoid  start-up \ndelays, the government has requested ADB to select consultants on its behalf. The government \nwill negotiate and enter into agreements while ADB will play an active facilitation role. \n \n20. \nThe  additional  financing  will  be  used  for  a  variation  of  an  ongoing  consulting  contract \nunder the railway component of the current TA loan. Additional design works became necessary \nduring  the  implementation  of  the  current  TA  loan  because  of  changes  in  the  technical \nspecifications  and  the  employer\u2019s  requirements.  The  contract  variation  refers  only  to  such \ngeographical  sections  of  the  railway  lines  that  were  part  of  the  original  scope  of  works  of  the \nconsultants. For these sections, the ongoing contract amount of $12.0 million will be scaled up \nby  $4.5  million  for  additional  tasks  under  the  rail  component.  The  consulting  firm  has  been \nselected  through  international  competitive  bidding  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nmethod  with  a  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  90:10.  Consultants  submitted  full  technical  proposals.  The \nfirm has performed well, has not been sanctioned, and has delivered the expected outputs on \ntime and in the required quality. The consultants, who are already familiar with the section, will \ncarry  out  the  additional  design  work.  This  will  save  time  and  money  associated  that  would  be \nneeded for a new consultant, who would have to become familiar with the relevant section, the \nenvironment, and previous studies and surveys. \n \nADB  approved  advance  contracting  of  consulting  services  on  19  June  2015  and  the \n21. \ngovernment  requested  retroactive  financing  for  consulting  services.  Up  to  20%  of  the  loan \nproceeds  will  be  eligible  for  retroactive  financing,  provided  that  expenditures  are  incurred  on \nconsulting services for the overall facility in accordance with agreed procedures and before the \neffective  date  but  no  earlier  than  12  months  before  the  date  of  the  loan  agreement.  The \ngovernment  has  been  informed  that  approval  of advance  contracting  and  retroactive financing \ndoes not in any way commit ADB to finance the facility. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nAll  proposed  railway  and  road  projects  that  will  be  prepared  under  the  additional \n22. \nfinancing are in line with the selection criteria described in the PAM (footnote 9). All railway and \nroad  sections  to  be  prepared  under  the  additional  financing  are  on  high-priority  corridors  for \nregional  connectivity  as  identified  in  the  SRMTS,  Asian  Highway  network,  Trans-Asia  Railway \nnetwork,  and  those  projects  linking  South  Asia  with  Southeast  Asia.  All  projects  were  also \n \n\n\f6 \n\nidentified as priority projects in the national sector planning documents of Bangladesh, i.e. the \nRailway Sector Master Plan toward 203011 approved in 2013 and the Roads Master Plan. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n23. \nThe  follow-on  transport  projects  prepared  under  the  facility  will  support  Bangladesh's \neconomic growth and reduce poverty by connecting major markets in the country and providing \ncommunities  with  access  to  economic  and  social  services.  It  will  also  contribute  to  regional \ncooperation  and  integration  by  strengthening  connectivity  with  neighboring  countries  and \nincreasing  the  trade  competitiveness  of  Bangladesh.  A  preliminary  study  on  transit  traffic \nthrough  Bangladesh  estimates  that  improvements  to  the  country\u2019s  sections  of  priority \nsubregional transport corridors could facilitate the movement of about 18 million tons of freight \nper year in Bhutan, India, and Nepal. \n \n24. \nThe  facility  will  combine  support  for  project  feasibility  studies,  detailed  design, \nprocurement, and safeguard implementation, ensuring that (i) follow-on transport projects will be \nimplemented  without  delay,  (ii)  the  positive  impacts  of  follow-on  transport  projects  will \nmaterialize  without  delay,  and  (iii)  the  government  will  minimize  commitment  and  interest \ncharges arising under follow-on loans. The facility will help the government ensure the economic \nand financial viability of transport corridor projects with subregional impacts, and will mitigate the \nsocial and environmental risks of any follow-on transport projects. \n \n25. \nBy  providing  detailed  design,  procurement,  and  safeguard  implementation  support \nimmediately after the feasibility study, the facility will accelerate the start of physical works of the \nfollow-on  loans  by  at  least  1  year  compared  with  projects  processed  under  conventional \nschemes.  Currently,  project  executing  agencies  in  Bangladesh  can  start  recruiting  consultants \nonly  after  the  project  loans  have  been  approved.  By  contrast,  the  facility  will  allow  executing \nagencies to undertake detailed design immediately after completion of feasibility studies. \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n26. \nFinancial  management.  Both  the  Roads  and  Highways  Department  (RHD)  and \nBangladesh  Railway  have  implemented  ADB-funded  projects  and  are  familiar  with  project \nfinancial  accounting  methods  and  ADB  disbursement  procedures.  For  the  facility,  one \naccountant  will  be  included  in  each  project  implementation  unit.  The  RHD  and  Bangladesh \nRailway  have  participated  in  workshops  run  by  ADB  consultants  on  good  practice  of  financial \nmanagement  systems.  The  overall  financial  management  capacity  is  adequate  but,  given  the \ncountry risk rating, the project risk is considered moderate. \n \n27. \nProcurement and anticorruption measures. Recruitment of consultants will be carried \nout  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended from \ntime to time). After ADB selects the consultants, the executing agencies will negotiate contracts \nwith them. This recruitment process will help to ensure that consulting services are available in \na timely manner. The procurement rules for the selection of contractors required by international \nfinancial  institutions  such  as  ADB  are  considered  sufficiently  robust  to  deter  corruption  during \nbid selection. National procurement regulations have also improved recently through the Public \nProcurement  Act,  2006,  and  the  related  Public  Procurement  Rules  (2008)  with  subsequent \namendments.  During  implementation  of  the  facility,  reports  will  be  submitted  to  executing \nagencies  and  ADB  in  line  with  submission  milestones  to  ensure  the  quality  and  timeliness  of \nconsultants' work. \n \n                                                \n11 Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of Railways. 2013.

Because the facility is focused on project preparation, it is not expected to \nhave  any  adverse  social  and  environmental  consequences.  The  facility  is  categorized  C  for \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. Follow-on transport projects will \nbe  designed  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  government \nguidelines, regulations, and policies.  During the feasibility  studies, the  consultants  will  prepare \nenvironmental  impact  assessments  or  initial  environmental  examinations,  as  applicable,  along \nwith climate risk and vulnerability assessments, including environmental management plans for \nthe  selected  transport  projects.  Similarly,  resettlement  planning,  indigenous  peoples  planning, \nand gender analyses will be done for the selected transport projects during this stage. Capacity \nbuilding  on  safeguards  implementation  and  coordination  will  be  carried  out  in  parallel  for  the \nRHD. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and \nrisk management plan.13 The integrated benefits are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nDirect payment procedures will be adopted.
