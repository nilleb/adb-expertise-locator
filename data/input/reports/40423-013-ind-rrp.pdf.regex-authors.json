THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to India for the Rural Connectivity Investment Program.1 \nThe report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Institutional Development for \nRural Roads Asset Management and, if the Board approves the proposed investment program, \nI, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \n2.  The investment program proposed for financing by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nwill construct to all-weather standard about 9,000 kilometers (km) of rural roads connecting \naround 4,200 habitations in the investment program states of Assam, Chhattisgarh, Madhya \nPradesh, Odisha, and West Bengal. For the investments in physical infrastructure to be effective \nand sustainable, the investment program will also focus on improving institutional arrangements, \nbusiness  processes,  and  associated  capacity  building,  especially  in  relation  to  design, \noperation, safeguards, finance, road safety, and asset management.2 \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Road map. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy (CPS) for India is closely aligned with \nthe priorities of India\u2019s Eleventh Five Year Plan, 2007\u20132012. The CPS reconfirms continuing \nADB assistance for development of rural roads, which are critical for rural development as they \nprovide  access  to markets,  health,  education, and  administrative  services.  Absence  of  all-\nweather road connectivity is a serious problem, making rural communities inaccessible for up to \n90 days a year. Poor road infrastructure affects economic growth in rural areas, agricultural \nproductivity, and employment, and has a strong link to poverty. The Government of India is \naddressing  this  problem  through  implementation  of  a  nationwide  rural  road  investment \nprogram\u2014the Prime Minister's Rural Roads Program (PMGSY)\u2014aimed at providing all-weather \nroad  connectivity  to  currently  unconnected  eligible  habitations  in  India\u2019s  rural  areas.  The \ninvestment program will support the government\u2019s objectives under the PMGSY. \n \n4.  Strategic context and policy framework. The specific contribution of the PMGSY to \nthe achievement of country strategic development goals includes reducing poverty (faster and \nmore  inclusive  growth),  expanding  and  strengthening  rural  infrastructure  to  accelerate \nagricultural growth and the rural economy, creating jobs, and social development (improved \neducation, health, and social indicators). The PMGSY is also very relevant to the pillars of the \npolicy  framework  in  the  road  sector,  including  sustainability  (promoting  longer-term  road \nmaintenance), road safety (mainstreaming road safety audits and community awareness), and \nseamless connectivity (as rural roads provide the \u2015last mile\u2016 connectivity). \n \n5.  Investment program. The PMGSY identified the investment program states among the \n10 states with large rural populations that lack adequate coverage in terms of all-weather road \nconnectivity. The poverty head count rates in these states are among the highest in India. The \nPMGSY  started  in  2000  and  has  thus  far  constructed  108,637  km  of  rural  roads  in  the \ninvestment program states, connecting 39,721 habitations to a greater transportation network.3 \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB provided project preparatory TA. ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to India for Preparing the Third Rural Road \nSector Investment Program. Manila. \n3  Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh have been provided with ADB assistance under ADB. 2003. Report and \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Technical Assistance Grant to ", "2 \nConstruction of an additional 32,158 km of roads is ongoing. According to the June 2011 \nprogram  update,  85,690  km  of  roads  to  connect  all  remaining  eligible  habitations  in  the \ninvestment program states are yet to be constructed under the PMGSY. \n \n6.  The latest estimate for the remaining PMGSY financing requirement to achieve its goal \nby 2016 in the investment program states is about $7.95 billion, while available PMGSY funding  \nfor the same period is estimated to be around $5.04 billion. While exploring the possibilities for \ndomestic borrowing to close the financial gap, the government has approached ADB to provide \nfunding of $0.8 billion under the investment program to assist with the implementation of the \nPMGSY  in  the  investment  program  states. The  investment  program  is  consistent  with  the \nstrategic objective set out in the CPS, 2009\u20132012 and is included in ADB\u2019s country operations \nbusiness plan, 2011\u20132013. \n \n7.  Lessons learned from the previous ADB rural roads projects in the investment program \nstates (footnote 3) show that, the states also need support in improving business procedures \ncovering the whole life cycle of rural roads, and strengthening related capacities. Specifically, \nwhile the emphasis is shifting from construction to the operation and maintenance of the rural \nroad network,4 the related capacities for rural road network management are lagging. There is \nalso a mismatch between the extent of the rural road network (around 80% of the total road \nnetwork) and supply of skills, as the training of civil engineers, technicians, and site supervisors \nis oriented towards high-category roads. Another lesson learned shows the necessity of better \ndevelopment coordination with the World Bank, which in addition to the geographical delineation \nof effort should strive to achieve synergies of the interventions between the two partners.5  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The long-term impact of the investment program will be reduced poverty and deprivation, \nand inclusive socioeconomic growth in the communities served by the investment program \nroads in Assam, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, and West Bengal. The immediate \noutcome will be improved and sustainable connectivity of rural communities in the investment \nprogram states to markets, district headquarters, and other centers of economic activity. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n9.  The investment program will have six outputs. These include that: (i) selected priority \nrural roads will be constructed to all-weather standard; (ii) the design quality of investment \nprogram roads will be improved; (iii) maintenance of the investment program roads will be \nimproved and sustained; (iv) road safety measures will be incorporated into the life cycle of the \ninvestment program roads; (v) the qualification and skills of PMGSY engineers, technicians, site \nsupervisors, panchayati raj institution staff concerned,6 design consultants, and contractors in \n                                                                                                                                                       \nIndia for the Rural Roads Sector I Project.

More details are in the sector \nassessment summary (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n4  Specifically, more than 65,000 km are currently on 5-year post-construction maintenance, and the length of roads \nbeyond 5-year post-construction maintenance will increase from around 17,000 km to more than 80,000 km by \n2016. \n5   Development coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6  A panchayat is a body of directly elected people responsible for development of activities in an area constituted for \nrural areas under Article 243-B of the Constitution of India. The three levels of panchayati raj institution are the \ngram panchayat at a village level, intermediate panchayat at a block level, and zilla panchayat (called a parishad in \nsome states) at a district level. These panchayats are collectively called \u2015panchayati raj institutions\u2016.  \n ", "3 \nthe  investment  program  states  will  be  improved  and  maintained;  and  (vi)  effective  project \nmanagement will be provided. \n \n10.  Road infrastructure development. Under the investment program, about 9,000 km of \nall-weather rural roads will be constructed in the investment program states, which will connect \naround  4,200  habitations.7 The  investment  program  will  pilot  the  use  of  new  construction \ntechnologies8 and the use of local materials will be increased. The adopted all-weather standard \nwill increase the resilience of communities to the impacts of climate change. All constructed \nroads will be maintained under 5-year performance-based maintenance contracts. Selected \ndistricts will pilot contracts linking payments with the achievement of both the performance \nstandards  and  a  degree  of  consistency  of  performance,  thus  introducing  a  public\u2013private \npartnership  approach  to  road  maintenance.  Another  pilot  will  involve  community-based \nprotection of roads from excessive loads. \n \n11.  Institutional Strengthening. The investment program will support: (i) establishment of \npilot rural road network management units (RRNMUs) for effective and high quality life  cycle \nrural road network management with emphasis on performance-based maintenance of created \nassets; and (ii) establishment of rural connectivity training and research centers (RCTRCs). The \nsupport will include construction of modern facilities along with providing all necessary state-of-\nthe art equipment, systems, and tools.9 Consulting services will include developing training \nmodules, assisting in research and compiling best practices in rural roads, supporting RCTRC \noperations, and rolling out large-scale rural roads-oriented training. A capacity development TA \nwill be provided to assist the roll out of RRNMUs and setting up of RCTRCs. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n12.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n17.  The proposed capacity development TA for Institutional Development for Rural Roads \nAsset  Management  will  support  the  piloting  of  RRNMUs  and  the  establishment  of  the \nRCTRCs.17 Support for RRNMUs will include (i) developing rural road network management \npolicies, business procedures, and associated tools; (ii) providing advisory support in design \nand procurement processes for RRNMU facilities; (iii) providing dedicated rural road network \nmanagement training; (iv) supporting RRNMUs with the implementation of rural road network \nmanagement  tasks;  and  (v)  monitoring  and  analyzing  RRNMU  performance  and  lessons \nlearned. Support for RCTRCs will include (i) formulating the concept, organizational structure, \n                                                \n16 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Detailed terms of reference for each component of the capacity development TA are in Appendixes E and F of \nFacility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nfunding mechanisms, business procedures, and staffing requirements of RCTRCs; (ii) providing \nadvisory  support  in  design  and  procurement  of  RCTRC  facilities;  (iii)  providing  dedicated \ntraining to RCTRC staff; (v) developing an operational plan for the rollout of RCTRCs; and (vi) \nassisting in recruitment of the loan-financed RCTRC consultant. \n \n18.  The  capacity  development  TA  will  be  conducted  over  a  period  of  30  months  from \nDecember  2012  through  June  2015.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $2,300,000 \nequivalent,18 consisting of $1,300,000 equivalent on a grant basis to be financed by the Japan \nFund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB, and $1,000,000 equivalent on a grant \nbasis to be financed from the Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). This \nexcludes the in-kind contribution of the state governments providing counterpart staff, and all \nrelevant information and data. International consulting firms will be recruited by ADB according \nto its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The selection \nwill be in accordance with ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection method using a quality\u2013cost \nratio  of  80:20.  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n19.  PMGSY guidelines will be followed in the selection of roads, and applicable standards of \nthe Indian Road Congress19 will be followed in preparation of designs. The states will also follow \nan improved road design process adopted for the investment program, as related to the design \ncontext, quality control, and incorporation of road safety measures. The project implementation \nconsultants will include safeguard experts to ensure the proper incorporation of safeguards and \ncommunity consultation in the process, and road safety experts to conduct road safety audits of \ndesigns, during and after construction. The technical support consultant will provide training and \nmonitoring of the implementation of the road safety audit recommendations. A feasibility study \nconducted on the representative sample20 in all investment program states has confirmed that \nall subprojects selected following PMGSY guidelines are technically feasible. The study has \nalso confirmed the feasibility of subprojects in terms of the social and environmental impacts. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n20.  A strong body of evidence21 exists documenting the significant benefits provided by \nPMGSY  all-weather  roads,  including  health,  education,  agriculture,  poverty  reduction, \nemployment and income, housing facilities, and moveable assets. As these benefits are not \ncaptured  by  the  economic  analysis,  which  accounts  only  for  transport  cost  savings,  the \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) threshold of 10% for testing economic viability was \nadopted. Economic analysis, which considered only passenger time savings and transport and \noperation costs conducted on the representative sample, indicated that overall the investment \nprogram is economically viable, with EIRRs ranging from 13.9% to 16.4% on a state-by-state \n                                                \n18 The cost estimates and financing plan for each TA component are in Appendix K of Facility Administration Manual \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 The Indian Road Congress is the national body responsible for sharing knowledge on all subjects dealing with \ntransportation. \n20 This consists of 112 roads, including around 59 km in Assam, 100 km in Chhattisgarh, 99 km in Madhya Pradesh, \n64 km in Odisha, and 82 km in West Bengal. \n21 ADB. 2012. Completion Report: Rural Road Sector II Investment Program (Project I).  Manila; ADB. 2011. \nCompletion Report: Rural Roads Sector I Project. Manila; and socioeconomic impact assessment reports for Rural \nRoads Sector I Project and Rural Road Sector II Investment Program (Project I). \n ", "7 \nbasis.22 Sensitivity  analysis  indicated  that,  with  a  15%  increase  in  capital  costs  or  a  15% \ndecrease in benefits, the investment program remains economically viable in all states. With \nboth a 15% increase in capital costs and 15% decrease in benefits, all states except Odisha \ncontinue to have EIRRs of more than 10%; for Odisha, the EIRR is only slightly lower than 10%. \nEconomic analysis was further expanded to conservatively estimate only two out of numerous \nadditional benefits of providing all-weather rural connectivity for a few road sections having \nEIRRs of less than 10%.23 With these benefits accounted for, the EIRR values for such road \nsections  increased  significantly,  reaching  a  minimum  of  10.8%  in  Assam,  12.6%  in \nChhattisgarh,  11.5%  in  Madhya  Pradesh,  and  10.8%  in  Odisha,  thus  confirming  that  the \nproposed investment is economically viable, on both a state-by-state and road-by-road basis. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n21.  Institutional. The investment program states have established equivalents of state rural \nroads development agencies (SRRDAs)24 and field project implementation units to manage the \nPMGSY, and since the start of PMGSY in 2000 have developed adequate implementation \nexperience, qualifications, and capacities. The investment program states will use the services \nof the project implementation consultants to assist with implementing safeguard frameworks and \npiloting  new  road  safety  and  road  maintenance  procedures,  while  the  Ministry  of  Rural \nDevelopment (MORD) and the National Rural Roads Development Agency (NRRDA) will use \nthe services of the technical support consultant for the overall due diligence, training, and \nmonitoring of compliance. Capacity development TA will be provided to further assist with the \nimplementation of the investment program\u2019s institutional strengthening component. \n \n22.  Financial management. The funds flow from MORD to the state governments will follow \nthe pattern of grants-in-aid under the centrally sponsored schemes of the Government of India, \nand its relevant financial rules will apply. This includes providing audited utilization certificates \nfor each fund release from MORD to the state governments and maintaining a separate account \nfor the central government funds in each investment program state. For disbursement of loan \nproceeds  under  the  MFF,  reimbursement  procedures  will  be  used.  Financial  management \nassessment conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Financial Management and \nAnalysis of Projects25 has confirmed that the project executing and implementing agencies have \nconsiderable experience in handling similar ADB-funded projects and are well prepared for \nfinancial management under the investment program.26 \n \n23.  Procurement of civil works and consulting services. All procurement of goods and \nworks  financed  wholly  or  in  part  by  ADB  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Procurement of civil works for construction of \nRRNMU  and  RCTRC  facilities  will  be  based  on  the  ADB  standard  bidding  document  for \nprocurement of works (small contracts). For the road construction, the investment program \nstates will be following the national competitive bidding procurement process with the use of the \n                                                \n22 Few individual roads\u2014mostly those with higher capital costs related to more bridge and/or cross-drainage works \n(such roads may have other more pronounced benefits related to providing all-weather connectivity)\u2014have EIRRs \nbelow 10%. \n23 These benefits are a 25% decrease in transport cost during about 60 days of the rainy season, and increased crop \ndiversification and reduced spoilage resulting in an increase in agricultural revenue of 10%. \n24 The functions of SRRDAs are carried out by the State Road Board in Assam, State Rural Roads Agency in Odisha, \nState Rural Development Agency in West Bengal, and Rural Roads Development Authority in Madhya Pradesh \nand Chhattisgarh. \n25 ADB. 2005. Guidelines on the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n26 Financial management assessment was conducted in each investment program state in 2011. More details are in \nFacility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nstandard  PMGSY  bidding  document  (improved  as  needed  in  agreement  with  ADB)  and \nelectronic procurement (e-procurement).27 Specific procurement procedures adopted under the \ninvestment program are detailed in the FAM (footnote 15). All consultants financed by the loans \nunder the MFF will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time) and other arrangements for recruitment of \nnational consultants acceptable to ADB. Prior ADB review for the recruitment process with \nquality- and cost-based selection with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20 will be followed. \n \n24.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the Government of India and state governments. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the FAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n25.  The investment program states are still lagging behind in terms of various development \nindicators.28 The provision of all-weather roads in rural areas will be a key factor in reducing \npoverty.  Specifically,  (i)  farmers  will  benefit  from  increased  access  to  rural  markets  and \nagricultural productivity contributing to increased incomes, (ii) rural communities will be able to \nshift  from  subsistence  farming  to  more  commercially  oriented  agricultural  production,  (iii) \nmainstreaming of production of high-value perishable products will become possible, (iv) poor \nhouseholds will be able to access better-paying jobs outside their villages, (v) investments in \nnonagricultural enterprises will grow at a faster pace, and (vi) the investment program itself will \ncreate labor opportunities for rural poor. \n \nE.  Gender Impacts \n \n26.  Gender  analysis  highlighted  several  key  benefits  which  the  all-weather  roads \nconstructed under the investment program will bring, including an increased rate of safe child \ndeliveries,  reduction  in  maternal  and  prenatal  deaths  and  the  mortality  of  children,  and \nincreased enrollment of girls in schools and universities. The gender action plan prepared for \nproject 1 incorporates several gender mainstreaming targets, including (i) participation of not \nless than 30% of women in the transect walks;29 (ii) participation of women in the road safety \nawareness sessions carried out for affected communities under the community participation \nframework (CPF); (iii) at least 10% of the households in rural habitations to be connected by \nproject  1  roads  will  be  headed  by  women,  and  at  least  40%  of  inhabitants  will  be  from \nvulnerable groups; (iv) at least 33% of and road maintenance will be done by women; and (v) \nRCTRCs will develop and use gender-sensitive training modules. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n27.  Environmental impact. Project 1 is classified category B in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). In line with the environmental assessment and review \nframework (EARF),30 state initial environmental examinations (IEEs) of all road subprojects will \n                                                \n27 Approval of e-procurement for national competitive bidding in all investment program states was granted by ADB in \n2009\u20132011.  \n28 The number of people living below the poverty line is around 5.57 million in Assam, 9.10 million in Chhattisgarh, \n24.97 million in Madhya Pradesh, 17.85 million in Odisha, and 20.84 million in West Bengal (based on 2004\u20132005 \npoverty level estimates). \n29 Consultation with the affected communities conducted in the process of walking of the community representatives \ntogether with the representatives of project implementation units, project implementation consultant, panchayati raj \ninstitution, and design consultant along the alignment of the proposed rural road. \n30 Endorsed by the NRRDA following prior approval by each state government. \n ", "9 \nbe prepared before each tranche approval; IEEs for project 1 have been prepared and are \ndisclosed on the ADB website. Pursuant to provisions of the EARF, environmental assessment \nof non-road subprojects will be conducted during implementation of the MFF. The IEEs rate the \nscale of environment impacts from the physical interventions of the investment program as \nminor. 31 Mitigation  measures  for  all  impacts  have  been  developed  and  integrated  into \nconstruction works through incorporation of a standard environmental management plan (EMP) \nin the bidding documents and provision of road-specific EMPs with the detailed project reports. \nAssessment of institutional capacities and arrangements confirmed that they are satisfactory to \neffectively implement the requirements of the EARF, IEEs, and EMPs.32  \n \n28.  Involuntary  Resettlement;  Land  Availability. Project 1 is classified category C in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).The construction will be carried out \nmostly within existing rights-of-way, with widening and minor realignments in some cases, which \nwill require narrow strips of land to be made available.  In such cases, the voluntary land \ndonation system will be used as in the preceding ADB interventions in the rural road sector \n(footnote 3). The system has been widely used under the PMGSY and other rural development \nschemes across India and has been proved effective. Projects under the investment program \nare not expected to involve involuntary resettlement and the government will ensure there is no \ninvoluntary  land  acquisition.  Specific  procedural  requirements  involving  comprehensive \nconsultations with the communities are provided in the state specific CPFs, which are disclosed \non the ADB website. Transect walks conducted in the preparation of project 1 have confirmed \nthe effectiveness of the adopted community consultation and social impact mitigation process. \nAssessment of institutional capacities and arrangements confirmed that they are satisfactory to \neffectively implement the requirements of the CPFs.33 \n \n29.  Indigenous  peoples.  Project  1  is  classified  category  C  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009).The social assessment identified the presence of scheduled \ntribes in all investment program states. However, these groups are largely assimilated into the \nlocal population. The investment program will not have any differential impact on scheduled \ntribes: they will receive similar benefits from the investment program to those received by \nnonscheduled  tribe  households,  and  the  impact  on  tribal  and  cultural  identity  will  not  be \nsignificant. All outputs will be delivered in a culturally appropriate and participatory manner. To \nfurther mitigate the risks, the CPFs identify special provisions for all scheduled tribe households, \nensuring that their living standards are not adversely affected as a result of land donation or in \nthe event of any loss of non-land asset and impacts on their livelihoods. \n \n30.  HIV/AIDS and other social safeguards. The social assessments done do not anticipate \nany rise in the incidence of HIV/AIDS as a result of the investment program. Each investment \nprogram state will ensure that works contracts follow all applicable labor laws and regulations \nand include provisions requiring contractors to carry out HIV/AIDS awareness programs for \nthose  employed  during  construction.  The  project  implementation  units  will  conduct  close \nmonitoring and, along with the contractors, will coordinate with the State AIDS Control Society \non conducting HIV/AIDS awareness programs. \n                                                \n31 The predicted environmental impacts are minimal, temporary, and reversible as they are mainly related to \noccupational health and safety and minor issues of dust, noise, and water pollution, which occur mostly during \nconstruction. \n32 Required capacity building of the contractors, PIUs, and PICs on environmental code of practice preparation and \nEMP implementation and monitoring will be organized by the NRRDA and SRRDAs with technical support from \nADB, where necessary. \n33 Required  capacity  building  of  the  contractors,  PIU,  and  PIC  on  CPF  preparation  and  implementation  and \nmonitoring will be organized by the NRRDA and SRRDAs with technical support from ADB, where necessary. \n ", "10 \nG.  Risks and Mitigation Measures \n \n31.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4.  More  details  are \nprovided in the risk assessment and risk management plan.34 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInitial delays in  Advance action for procurement will be used. A new adopted procedure for road design will \nstart of civil  minimize delays caused by design omissions. E-procurement adopted in each investment program \nworks  state will attract more bidders and promote competition, thus reducing rebidding. \nInadequate road  All contracts will include 5-year post-construction road maintenance. Under PMGSY, MORD strictly \nmaintenance  enforces the inbuilt mechanism linking release of central funds for construction with provision of \nadequate maintenance financing by the states. The investment program will further increase the \neffectiveness of the maintenance planning, budgeting, contracting, and administration. \nSustainability of  All states have committed to (i) provide adequate staffing and budget for RCTRCs and RRNMUs, \nRRNMUs and  and normally (ii) not transfer key staff from the RRNMUs for at least 3 consecutive years; (iii) not \nRCTRCs  leave key positions vacant for more than 30 days; and (iv) not transfer more than one key staff \nmember  within  a  6-month  period.  The  consultants  (loan  financed  and  under  the  capacity \ndevelopment TA) will help support the rollout and knowledge transfer. \nMORD  =  Ministry  of  Rural  Development,  PMGSY  =  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Rural  Road  Program,  RCTRC  =  rural \nconnectivity training and research center, RRNMU = rural road network management unit, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n32.  The  Government  of  India  and  the  state  governments  have  assured  ADB  that \nimplementation of the investment program will conform to all applicable ADB policies including \nthose  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting \nservices, and disbursement as described in detail in the FAM and loan documents. \n \n33.  The  Government  of  India  and  the  state  governments  have  given  ADB  certain \nundertakings for the MFF, which are set forth in the FFA. Specific covenants agreed by the \nnational and the state governments with respect to individual tranches under the MFF are set \nforth in the loan agreement and project agreements for the respective tranches. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n34.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the provision of loans under the multitranche financing facility in an aggregate principal \namount not exceeding $800,000,000 to India for the Rural Connectivity Investment Program, \nfrom ADB's ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB's \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the framework financing \nagreement presented to the Board.  \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n21 June 2012 \n                                                \n34 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK FOR THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nReduction in poverty  Three years after completion  Census (2011, next due  PMGSY is prioritized in \nand deprivation, and  of the investment program  around 2018), state and  the Government of \ninclusive  (2020) as compared to 2011:  district statistics  India\u2019s Twelfth Five-\nsocioeconomic growth  Improvement in social    Year Plan and being \nof the communities  indicators in rural areas  Impact monitoring by  implemented in \nserved by the  served by the investment  TSC in a sample of  accordance with the \ninvestment program  program roads by 10%,  villages  PMGSY targets \nroads  including poverty rates,     \nmaternal and infant deaths,  Post-project monitoring  Risks \nsafe delivery, immunization,  by NRRDA  Extreme weather \nemployment opportunities,  condition and severe \nand agricultural revenue  economic downturn \nderail implementation \nOutcome      Assumption \nConnectivity of  By the end of the investment  OMMAS   \nselected rural  program (2017): About 4,200    Continuous allocation \ncommunities in five  rural habitations (with at least  Impact monitoring and  of central and state \ninvestment program  10% of households headed  surveys by TSC   government funds for \nstates of Assam,  by women and 40% of    post-construction road \nChhattisgarh, Madhya  inhabitants from vulnerable  maintenance \nPradesh, Odisha, and  groups) are newly connected \nWest Bengal to  by all-weather investment \nmarkets, district  program roads under long-\nheadquarters, and  term PBMCs. \nother centers of \neconomic activity is \nimproved and \nsustainable. \nOutputs       \n1.
