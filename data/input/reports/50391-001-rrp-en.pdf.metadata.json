It will serve  as  a demonstration for the  PRC  of an  integrated\nelderly care and health care system and will be the first project in GZAR to introduce internationally\naccepted public-private partnership (PPP) principles and standards in the elderly care sector.\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\nII.\n\nTHE PROJECT\n\nThe  PRC  is  facing  a  serious  change  in  its  demographic  structure.  In  2017,  158  million\n3.\npeople\u201411.4% of the population\u2014were aged 65 years and above. The aging rate is expected to\nreach 14% in 2025 and 21% in 2035.1 The aging population increases incidence of age-related\ndiseases. Elderly people typically have chronic diseases and experience multiple morbidities. The\nprimary  cause  of  their  care  dependence  is  the  loss  of  physical  function  resulting  from  chronic\ndiseases and age-associated impairments.2 Further, many elderly people have complex cases of\nmultiple chronic diseases and physical and/or cognitive disabilities which require a continuity of\nservices for both  elderly care  and health  care. Coordination of care  between health sector and\nelderly care sector is necessary to provide seamless care services for elderly people in need and\nto reduce avoidable hospitalization.\n\n4.\nIn  an  aging  society,  elderly  people  tend  to  be  readmitted  to  hospital  because  of lack  of\nappropriate elderly care institutions that allow them to transition back to their homes.3 However, it\nwould be difficult for families to provide adequate care for elderly people who are discharged from\nhospitals and still require medical and elderly care services. Inadequate care at home can cause\nfurther health problems, which may require readmission to hospital. Frequent transitions between\nhospitals and homes or long stays in hospitals further reduce the functional abilities of the elderly.\n\nIn the PRC, more than 100 million elderly people had at least one chronic disease in 2013\n5.\n(footnote 2). The burden of chronic disease is expected to increase by 40% by 2030 from the status\nof  2013.  The  number  of  elderly  people  with  multiple  chronic  conditions  is  also  increasing\nsignificantly in the PRC. Those elderly people would require post-acute care and rehabilitation to\nrestore or stabilize their functionality after discharge from hospital as well as elderly care (long-\nterm care) to maintain their activities of daily living.4 A coordination system, linking the acute phase\ncare, post-acute phase care, rehabilitation, and elderly care in an effective and efficient way, is at\n\n1  The aging rate is the ratio of population aged 65 years and above to the total population.

Tokyo.\n\n4  Activities  of  daily  living  are  defined  as  basic  self-care  tasks  such  as  eating;  toileting,  or  actions  associated  with \n\npersonal hygiene; bathing; and transferring or the ability to sit, stand, and walk independently. \n\n\f2 \n\nthe core of integrated health and elderly care. Such a system needs to ensure smooth linkage of \ncare services across the elderly care and health care sectors. \n\n6.\nTo  create  a  coordination  system,  a  functional  hospital  discharge  management  system\nneeds  to  be  established.  The  discharge  management  system  will  (i)  clarify  care  needs  after\nhospitalization, including needs for medical care, medication, rehabilitation, and elderly care; and\n(ii) identify  where  and  how  an  elderly  person  can  access  his  or  her  needed  care.  Such\nindividualized care plans should be prepared based on discussions with the elderly people, their\nfamilies,  medical  experts,  therapists,  social  workers,  and  elderly  care  experts.  Further,  it  is\nnecessary  to  strengthen  the  elderly  care  service  capacity  to  meet  a  range  of  care  needs.  The\nintegration of health and elderly care will provide seamless care services across the two sectors\nbased on needs, and avoid using medical resources for the elderly care service provision.5\n\n7.\nEnhanced private sector involvement is vital to fill the gap in supplying coordinated elderly\ncare and health care services. Quantity of private providers varies greatly across localities, and no\nscheme  has  been  established  to  ensure  their  quality.  Considering  substantial  increase  in  care\nneeds due to rapid aging of the population, it would be unrealistic for the public sector to be the\nmain  provider  of  care  services.  Meanwhile,  the  public  sector  needs  to  take  responsibility  for\nestablishing  standardized  care  needs  assessment  and  service  quality  monitoring  systems.  The\nprivate sector could bring its knowledge and experience to better design facilities, engage skilled\nstaff, and provide efficient services under the guidelines and regulations set by the public sector.\nSuch alignment of responsibilities is not yet clearly established in the PRC elderly care sector.\n\nThe Government of the PRC has recognized the importance of integrated elderly care and\n8.\nhealth care services to respond to its rapidly aging population, and issued a related policy in 2015.6\nIn line with the central policy, the Government of GZAR (GGZAR) in 2016 issued policies on the\nimplementation of elderly care and health care integration, and for enhancing the involvement of\nthe  private  sector  in  care  service  provision  for  elderly  people.7 While  the GGZAR  issued  those\npolicies,  it  has  limited  experience  and  capacity  in  promoting  the  integration  of  elderly  care  and\nhealth care, and private sector involvement in the coordinated care service provision.\n\n9.\nIn order to build the institutional capacity and system, the municipalities of Nanning and\nHezhou were selected as pilot cities for elderly care and health care integration in 2017.8 In the\nsame  year,  people  aged  65  years  and  above  were  0.8  million  and  0.2  million  in  Nanning  and\nHezhou municipalities which account for 11.4% and 10.1 % of the population, respectively. More\nthan  85%  of  those  elderly  people  have  at  least  one  chronic  disease  and  about  60%  have\nmultimorbidity. The integration of elderly care and health care is necessary to provide needed care\nservices  for  those  elderly  people.  However,  most  elderly  patients  directly  return  home  after\ndischarge from tertiary level hospitals. A functional coordination system is not established between\nhospitals and elderly care facilities in those municipalities. The inter-sectoral coordination among\nbureaus, such as the civil affairs bureaus and the health commission, needs to be established.\n\n5  The PRC\u2019s social security system includes medical insurance, which helps finance medical care services. The PRC \nhas  not  yet  established  a  long-term  care  insurance  system.  Most  local  governments  provide  some  capital  and \noperational subsidies for elderly care institutions. \n\n6  Government of the PRC, State Council. 2015.

Lessons from those initial experiences suggested a strong need\nfor strengthening the governments\u2019 knowledge and capacities in elderly care and PPP.9 ADB has\nextended its support for the central government to establish an overall policy framework for the\nPRC\u2019s elderly care system.10 Previous ADB interventions focused on the three-tiered elderly care\nsystem and indicated that coordination of health care and elderly care services is a challenge in\nthe PRC, which requires urgent policy action. Building on ADB\u2019s experiences and knowledge in\nthe elderly care sector, the project will further support GZAR to achieve its policy target of elderly\ncare and health care integration to better adapt to the needs of its aging population (footnote 7).\n\n11.\nThe  project  also  supports  Healthy  China  2030,  highlighting  the  optimization  of  health\nservices  as  a  critical  development  challenge  in  the  PRC.11  It  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  (i)  country\npartnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020, focusing on inclusive growth; (ii) Operational Plan\nfor  Health,  2015\u20132020,  which  has  elderly  care  as  a  focus  area;  and  (iii)  Strategy  2030,  as  it\n(a) demonstrates the \u201cOne ADB\u201d approach with the Office of Public\u2013Private Partnership\u2019s support\nfor  catalyzing  investments  through  PPP  and  delivering  integrated  solutions,  and  (b)  supports\noperational priorities 1 (addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequality) and 2 (accelerating\nprogress in gender equality).12 The project addresses issues of upper middle-income countries,\nas in ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, through strengthening institutions, developing a demonstrative project,\nexpanding PPPs, and responding to critical social issues, i.e., the aging population. The project\u2019s\ndemonstrative  and  innovative  experiences  in  the  areas  of  elderly  care  and  PPP  will  have  an\nessential knowledge  transfer  impact  not  only  on  other provinces  in  the PRC  but  also  on  other\ndeveloping member countries facing challenges regarding their aging populations.\n\nB.\n\nImpact and Outcome\n\n12.\nThe project is aligned with the following impact: integrated elderly care and health care\nservices in GZAR established (footnote 7). The project will have the following outcome: utilization\nof coordinated health care and elderly care services in GZAR increased.13\n\nC.\n\nOutputs\n\n13.\nOutput 1: Coordinated care services and facilities improved.

Design\noptions in feasibility study reports were compared and least-cost alternatives were selected. The\narchitectural design (layouts), following relevant PRC regulations, incorporated international and\nnational  standards  as  well  as  good  practices,  and  follows  age-friendly,  elderly  care-focused,\nefficient, and inclusive principles. Low-carbon, seismic structure, and resource-efficient measures\n(including solar hot water systems, intelligent lighting control, and passive energy-saving designs)\n\n\f7 \n\nwill be adopted. The facility design should meet respective functionalities and suitable operation \nof elderly care facilities. To ensure proper facility design, preliminary and detailed designs will be \nreviewed by an elderly care architect and cleared by ADB. \n\nB.\n\nEconomic and Financial\n\nEconomic. The project foresees the provision of coordinated elderly care and health care\n23.\nservices  to  the  rapidly  aging  populations  in  Nanning  and  Hezhou  municipalities.  The  cost-\neffectiveness approach was used for economic analysis, in accordance with ADB guidelines.20\nThe  approach  required  that  the  elderly  care  facilities  and  a  medical  facility  be  compared  with\nalternative designs, which aim to achieve the same number of elderly people served during the\nsame time frame as the project design. The results of the cost-effectiveness analysis showed that\nthe net present value of the alternative designs would cost $3.64 million more than the project\nscenario over the 20-year operation period, making the project the more cost-effective option.\n\n24.\nFinancial.  The  financial  analysis  was  conducted  to  determine  the  viability  and\nsustainability of the proposed subprojects. It examined the possible revenues to be generated by\nsubprojects  and  assessed  their  projected  incremental financials  over  a  life  cycle  period  in real\nterms. The financial internal rate of return of 10.82% for a subproject (medical facility), which is\nhigher than the weighted average cost of capital of 2.27%, shows its financial viability. A fiscal\nsustainability  analysis  conducted  for  the  elderly  care  facility  subprojects  showed  that  the  total\nproject incremental costs will have a negligible impact on the budgets of those municipalities, thus\nconfirming their project sustainability. The maximum impact of the incremental costs will be less\nthan 0.8% of the annual fiscal revenues of the municipalities.\n\nC.\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial  management  assessment.  The  financial  management  assessment  was\n25.\nconducted in accordance with ADB guidelines.21 It considered the financial management capacity\nof  Nanning  Municipal  Government,  HMG,  and  PIEs.  The  assessment  covered  fund  flow\narrangements, staffing, accounting and financial reporting systems, internal and external auditing\narrangements,  and  financial  information  systems.  The  GPMO  has  experience  in  implementing\nADB-financed projects and has a proven record in project financial management. The financial\nmanagement risk is moderate mainly because the PIEs have no experience in implementing ADB\nprojects, and their staff will need to be familiarized with ADB policies and procedures. Mitigation\nmeasures  to  address  identified  deficiencies  were  agreed  with  the  executing  and  implementing\nagencies, and PIEs. The financial management actions are included in the PAM (footnote 18).\n\nProcurement  risk  assessment.  The  procurement  risk  assessment  was  conducted  in\n26.\naccordance  with  ADB  guidelines. 22  It  confirmed  that  the  GPMO,  implementing  agencies,  and\nPIEs,  acting  through  a  procurement  agency  and  with  the  assistance  of  ADB  and  project\nimplementation support consultants, will have adequate capacity to facilitate compliance with the\nADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for\nADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). The project procurement risk was rated\nmedium. The GPMO has experience in implementing ADB-financed projects and is familiar with\nADB procurement procedures. However, the PIEs lack ADB project experience, and their staff\n\n20 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila.\n21 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.

Mitigation measures to address \nidentified deficiencies have been agreed with the GPMO, implementing agencies, and PIEs. \n\n27.\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed\nwith  the  government  and  the  GGZAR.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary\nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 18).\n\nD.\n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender\n\nA poverty and social analysis  was conducted in Nanning and Hezhou municipalities by\n28.\nfocusing  on  care  needs  of  elderly  people  and  the  availability  of  care  services.  The  household\nsurvey presented that about 20% of elderly people reported their self-rated health status as poor.\nFurther, about 15% of respondents showed physical and/or cognitive impairments at moderate to\nsevere  levels.23  Meanwhile,  the  systematic  coordination  between  medical  and  elderly  care\ninstitutions has not yet been established. The capacity of needed care, such as rehabilitation, is\nalso  significantly  limited.24  The  elderly  people  in  need  are  not  able  to  receive  adequate  care\nservices. The project will improve the provision of coordinated care services, thereby providing\nelderly people with better access to urgently needed care services.25\n\n29.\nThe project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. Better coordinated elderly care\nand health care services will alleviate the burden of the young, especially young women, from\ninformal  family  care  responsibilities,  and  enable  them  to  concentrate  on  improving  their\nprofessional  skills  and  finding  jobs.  The  project  will  support  the  gender-sensitive  facility  use,\nenhance job opportunities for women during the construction and operation phases, and provide\ntraining opportunities for women to strengthen their skills and capacity.\n\nE.\n\nSafeguards\n\n30.\ncategories are as follows.26\n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard\n\n31.\nEnvironment  (category  B).  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE),  including  an\nenvironmental  management  plan  (EMP),  was  prepared  for  five  elderly  care  facilities27  and  a\nmedical facility, and was disclosed on the ADB website in June 2019.28 The IEE concluded that\nthe anticipated environmental impacts can be mitigated through effective EMP implementation.\nDuring construction, impacts anticipated\u2014including noise, air pollutants, demolition waste, and\nrisk to community and occupational health and safety\u2014are localized and short-term and can be\neffectively  mitigated  by  implementing  good  construction  practices.29  Contractors  will  address\nmanagement  of  wastewater  and  drainage,  medical  waste,  and  their  linkage  with  associated\nfacilities, as required in the IEE and EMP. The EMP lists mitigation procedures that must be strictly\n\n23 The data were collected from the household survey conducted in Nanning and Hezhou municipalities.

Manila (TA 9437-PRC).  \n\n24 The ratio of physical therapists to beds is very low, i.e., 0.005\u20130.01, even in hospitals. \n25 The project will provide direct, cumulative benefits to an estimated 2,000 elderly people. \n26 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n27 Includes four elderly care facilities under output 1 and one facility under output 2. \n28 The  IEE  was  prepared  based  on  a  domestic  environmental  impact  assessment  in  Chinese  language  and  will  be \n\napproved by the Nanning or Hezhou Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau. \n\n29 If any asbestos-containing materials are found during the demolition of old facilities, the executing agency will engage \nthe  services  of  a  certified  agency  capable  of  handling  and  disposing  of  the  asbestos-containing  materials  in \naccordance with international best practices. \n\n\f9 \n\nfollowed  in  compliance  with  PRC  regulations  and  ADB  guidelines.  The  executing  agency  has \nconfirmed  its  commitment  and  capacity  to  implement  the  EMP.  Further  capacity  building  is \nproposed in the EMP. It will assign a safeguards officer within the GPMO to supervise effective \nimplementation of the EMP. The procedures, reporting timelines, and roles and responsibilities of \nrelevant  agencies  are  described  in  the  EMP.  Environmental  complaints  will  be  handled  in \naccordance with the grievance redress mechanism established for the project by the GPMO. \n\n32.\nClimate change. A climate risk and vulnerability assessment found that all project sites\nwould  have  a  medium  risk  to  climate  change  impact.  Flood  resilient  designs  and  evacuation\ndevices are the principal measures to mitigate the anticipated impact. Electrical and other water-\nsensitive facilities will not be installed in the basement and lower floors to avoid incidents related\nto  flooding.  Air  drying,  heating,  and  cooling  systems  will  be  installed  to  help  disadvantaged\ncitizens adapt to extreme climate conditions. All buildings will achieve energy efficiency standards,\nas required by official regulations. Preserving existing buildings, using renewable energy such as\nsolar heaters, and resource saving such as minimizing the use of cement are main methods to\nmitigate  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  The  implementing  agencies  and  PIEs  will  ensure  these\nmeasures are incorporated in the detailed designs as proactive adaptation measures.\n\n33.\nInvoluntary resettlement (category B). The project requires 11.38 hectares (ha) of land,\ncomprising 4.94 ha of rural collective lands and 6.44 ha of state-owned lands. Rural collective\nlands  will  be  acquired  for  the  second  elderly  care  facility  under  the  Hezhou  People\u2019s  Hospital\nsubproject  and  will  affect  56  households  with  296  persons  in  Xiadao  village,  of  which\n26 households with 152 persons will be significantly impacted because of house demolition.30 The\nincome losses for households with land impacts has been assessed to be insignificant, with less\nthan 1% of their household incomes affected. A draft resettlement plan was prepared following\nthe  laws  and  regulations  of  the  PRC,  GZAR,  and  Hezhou  Municipality;  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard\nPolicy Statement (2009). HMG will be responsible for paying compensation and assisting affected\npersons before land acquisition and relocation. The other five facilities will be located on state-\nowned  lands,  and  the  resettlement  due  diligence  confirmed  that  there  is  no  past  nor  present\nconcerns  related  to  involuntary  resettlement.  During  project  implementation,  the  GPMO  and\nresettlement management staff of implementing agencies and PIEs will be trained in involuntary\nresettlement procedures. A grievance redress mechanism has been established, and an external\nagency will be engaged for semiannual resettlement monitoring and evaluation.\n\nIndigenous peoples (category C). In subproject areas of Nanning Municipality, ethnic\n34.\nminorities  account  for  50%  of  the  total  population.  In  the  subproject  area  in  Pinggui  District,\nHezhou  Municipality,  they  account for  2%  of the total  population. The  Zhuang  is the  dominant\nethnic  minority  in  Nanning while  the  Yao  is  the  dominant  ethnic  minority  in  Hezhou.  Ethnic\nminorities live in harmony with others and anticipate no obstruction or discrimination in accessing\nimproved  elderly  care  and  health  care  services  under  the  project.  The  subprojects  will  not\nadversely  affect  their  community  identities,  beliefs,  religions,  or  customs.  Therefore,  an  ethnic\nminority development plan to ensure that they receive improved elderly care services and health\nservices is not required.\n\n30 Among the 56 households, land acquisition will affect 30 households with 144 persons, house demolition will impact \n11  households  with  88  persons,  and  both  land  acquisition  and  house  demolition  will  affect  15  households  with \n64 persons.  \n\n\f10 \n\nF.\n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan\n\nThe overall benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs and risks involved.\n35.\nThe overall risk is rated moderate. Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in\nTable 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.31\n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nPIEs are unfamiliar with ADB\u2019s \nfinancial management guidelines and \nprocedures \nPIEs are unfamiliar with ADB\u2019s \nprocurement guidelines and \nprocedures \nInadequate functionality and facility \ndesign of elderly care institutions \nPIEs\u2019 limited capacity in adequate \ncoordination between hospitals and \nelderly care institutions \nLimited experience of GPMO, HMG, \nand PIE in structuring the PPP \nsubproject \nADB = Asian Development Bank, GPMO = Guangxi project management office, HMG = Hezhou Municipal Government, \nOPPP = Office of Public\u2013Private Partnership, PIE = project implementing entity, PPP = public\u2013private partnership. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nTraining on ADB financial management requirements will be undertaken \nunder the project implementation support.
