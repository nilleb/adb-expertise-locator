The  project  is  market  oriented  and  demand  driven,  and  will  increase \nfarmers\u2019 incomes and enhance food security in Bangladesh.3 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nBangladesh,  one  of  the  world's  poorest  countries,  is  at  high  risk  from  climate  change \nparticularly because of its low-lying position along the Bay of Bengal. Poverty incidence in the west \nof  the  country  is  14 percentage  points  higher  than  in  the  east.4 Land,  and  its  cultivation,  is  the \ncountry\u2019s most basic resource with more than 75% of the population directly or indirectly engaged \nin  agriculture.  Rice  is  the  dominant  crop  contributing  most  to  self-sufficiency  in  food  grains  and \nhence  food  security.  However,  the  emphasis  on  rice  production  has  resulted  in  increased \ndependency on imported food, particularly HVCs including fruit, which remain unaffordable to many \npoor  consumers.  Therefore,  increasing  HVC  production  is  of  critical  importance  for  reducing \nimports and enhancing affordable and varied nutritious diets for the poor. Fertile and well-drained \nsoils,  a  varied  climate  that  favors  a  range  of  crops,  and  low  daily  wage  rates  contribute  to  the \ncomparative advantage for growing HVCs in Bangladesh. \n \nThe government\u2019s overall objective in the National Agriculture Policy5 is to make the nation \n4. \nself-sufficient in food and ensure a dependable food security system by increasing production of all \ncrops,  including  HVCs.  In  the  National  Strategy  for  Accelerated  Poverty  Reduction  II,  the \ngovernment  gives  highest  priority  to  the  development  of  the  agriculture  sector  in  addressing  and \nrapidly reducing poverty, and reaffirms its commitment to make the country self-sufficient in food by \n2013. 6  The  strategy  outlines  medium-term  policies  and  strategies  to  foster  agriculture  sector \ngrowth  that  include  (i)  increasing  crop  yield,  (ii)  providing  broad-based  policy  support,  (iii) \ndiversifying  into  HVCs,  (iv)  intensifying  agricultural  research  and  technology  generation,  (v) \ndisseminating  technology  among  farmers,  (vi)  revamping  the  agricultural  marketing  system,  (vii) \npromoting agroprocessing activities, (viii) adopting climate change adaptive technologies, and (ix) \nundertaking  irrigation  schemes  and  flood  protection  measures.  The  Second  Crop  Diversification \nProject  directly  supports  government  policy  on  food  security  and  agriculture  sector  growth, \nparticularly  for  the  following  intervention  areas  prioritized  in  the  National  Food  Policy  Plan  of \nAction:  (i) agricultural  marketing  and  trade  (reducing  marketing  costs  of  agricultural  products  and \nstrengthening  value-chain  integration),  (ii)  agricultural  diversification  into  HVCs  and  a  focus  on \ninvolving  women,  (iii)  agricultural  credit  (increasing  formal  credit  to  agriculture,  especially  to \nmarginal, small, and medium farmers), and (iv) market infrastructure development.7 \n                                                 \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  HVCs are defined as agricultural crops that give a higher rate of return per hectare than high-yielding winter (boro) rice. \n3  Project preparatory technical assistance was provided.

Dhaka. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) is supporting inclusive economic growth and poverty \n5. \nreduction  in  Bangladesh  through  its  strategic  priorities  as  identified  in  the  country  strategy  and \nprogram for 2006\u20132010.8 The project is a follow-on to the successful ADB-assisted Northwest Crop \nDiversification  Project  (NCDP)  completed  in  June  2009. 9  The  NCDP  substantially  raised  the \nincomes of small and marginal farmers in the northwest region.10 The proposed project will build on \nthe  successful  NCDP  activities  and  expand  into  new  areas,  especially  the  southwest  of \nBangladesh.  The  project  will  complement  the  NCDP  and  other  ADB  support,  such  as  the \nAgribusiness  Development  Project, 11  particularly  by  promoting  value  addition \nto  HVCs, \nstrengthening  value-chain  integration  by  developing  backward  and  forward  linkages  between \nfarmers  and  consumers,  and  including  service  provision  by  private  sector  agribusinesses  and \ntechnically and financially qualified microfinance institutions (MFIs) and wholesale banks. \n \nThe  project  is  consistent  with  the  ADB  country  strategy  and  in  conformity  with \n6. \nrecommendations made in the recent country assistance program evaluation in Bangladesh.12 The \nevaluation found that lack of agricultural diversification is one of the country's binding constraints to \ngrowth,  and  confirmed  that  agricultural  and  rural  development  is  one  of  the  government's  top \npriorities and key to reducing rural poverty. The project is also consistent with the ADB Operational \nPlan  for  Sustainable  Food  Security,13 which  suggests  enhancing  ADB\u2019s  multisector  food  security \nengagement by increasing synergy and value addition in backward and forward linkages along the \nfood  and  agriculture  value  chain,  with  particular  attention  to  small  farmers  and  farm  households \nheaded  by  women  and  other  vulnerable  groups.  The  project  will  be  a  pioneer  in  mainstreaming \nclimate  change  adaptation  into  project  design  and  implementation,  following  the  South  Asia \nDepartment  Climate  Change  Implementation  Plan  for  Bangladesh. 14  Climate-resilient  crop \nvarieties,  and  cropping  patterns  and  technology  will  be  tested  and  disseminated  to  help  farmers \nadapt to climate change. \n \n7. \nThe project will actively pursue liaison, cooperation, and synergies with other development \npartners,  including  (i)  the  World  Bank-assisted  National  Agricultural  Technology  Project,  2008\u2013\n2013; (ii) Danish International Development Agency-assisted Agricultural Sector Program Support \nPhase  II,  2006\u20132011;  (iii)  ADB  and  International  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development-assisted \nParticipatory  Small-Scale  Water  Resources  Sector  Project,  2009\u20132017;  (iv)  Islamic  Development \nBank-assisted  Greater  Rangpur  District  Agricultural  and  Rural  Development  Project,  2006\u20132011; \nand  (v)  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization-supported  Livelihood  Adaptation  to  Climate  Change \nProject, which is piloting short-, medium-, and long-term climate adaptation changes for farmers. \n \n8. \nparticularly the NCDP, including the following: \n\nThe  project  design  incorporates  lessons  from  other  projects  in  the  agriculture  sector, \n\n(i) \n\nAgriculture  projects  continue  to  be  important  for  promoting  social  inclusiveness, \nparticularly  of  women  and  ethnic  minorities,  in  the  economic  development  process \nand for reducing income poverty by creating opportunities for employment and asset \ncreation.

Manila. \n\n\f(ii) \n\nannum),  sector  growth must  come  from  productivity  gains  linked  to  more  intensive \nland use and diversification into HVCs. \nAccess to finance is essential for farmers. Providing a very small agricultural loan is \nexpensive for banks, and obtaining such a loan from banks is inconvenient, difficult, \nand costly for a farmer. Credit through MFIs enables farmers investing in HVCs. \nProject  planning  and  implementation  must  involve  grassroots  stakeholders  and \navoid  use  of  top\u2013down  approaches.  Farmer  organizations  involving  women  and \nsmall farmers need to be strengthened to increase their bargaining capability.  \n(iv)  More  cooperation  between  the  public  and  private  sectors  is  necessary  to  ensure \n\n(iii) \n\n(v) \n\nprogress in commercializing agriculture. \nEffective  linkages  with  external  markets  are  needed  for  women,  considering  their \nrealities  in  the  community.

The outcome will be improved efficiency and value addition of HVC production. The \ndirect beneficiaries will be marginal, small and medium farmers with landholdings up to 3 hectares. \nLandless  people  will  benefit  through  generated  employment  opportunities  in  rural  areas.  The \nproject area, comprising (i) 43 upazilas (subdistricts) in 18 districts of Barisal, Dhaka, and Khulna \ndivisions in the southwest; and (ii) 9 upazilas in 9 districts of Rajshahi and Rangpur divisions in the \nnorthwest,15 contains some of the country's poorest people and least economically developed and \nmost climate-vulnerable16 areas. The project focus helps address the growing east\u2013west divide in \nthe incidence of poverty and economic development of the country. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n10. \nOutputs  include  (i)  increased  HVC  production  and  commercialization;  (ii)  reduced  HVC \npostharvest losses, improved product quality and value addition, and enhanced market efficiency; \n(iii) enhanced capacity of public sector institutions and participating partners to support farmers to \nincrease  their  incomes;  and  (iv)  increased  participation  of  women  in  commercial  agricultural \nactivities. The outputs will be delivered through five components. \n \n\n1. \n\nHigh-Value Crop Production Support \n\n11. \nProject  farmers  will  be  provided  with  the  latest  HVC  production  technology  using  lessons \nfrom  the  NCDP  and  closely  consulting  with  farmers.  Extension  will  be  through  institutional  and \nfield-based  training,  demonstration  plots  and  cross-field  learning,  dissemination  of  brochures, \nmotivational tours, agricultural fairs, and ongoing extension services provided by the Department of \nAgricultural  Extension  (DAE).  Technologies  will  include  integrated  pest  management  techniques; \nreduced and zero tillage practices; green and organic manure application; controlled environment \nagricultural  technology;  and  mechanization  for  cultivation,  harvesting,  and  postharvest  handling. \nHigh-quality planting material will be supplied to farmers from the horticulture development training \n\n                                                 \n15  The NCDP only covers the northwest of the country. Though the project covers the same districts as the NCDP in the \n\nnorthwest, the project\u2019s targeted upazilas are different from the NCDP upazilas. \n\n16  Center  for  Global  Change.  2009.

Dhaka. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fcenter (HDTC) nurseries.17 Women will be trained, equally with men, and have equal access to all \nproject benefits. \n \n12. \nThe focus will be on crops with a proven market demand, high profitability per hectare, and \npotential  for  commercialization  in  comparison  to  high-yielding  boro  rice.  A  range  of  high-value \nfruits,  vegetable,  pulses,  and  spices  will  be  supported  as  well  as  cut  flowers,  potted  plants  and \nfoliage production, and value addition to coconuts (such as coir and virgin coconut oil production). \nProfitable  farming  systems  involving  intercropping  will  be  promoted.  The  project  will  pilot  test \nclimate-resilient  (drought-,  flood-,  and  saline-tolerant)  varieties  of  crops  to  facilitate  adaptation  by \nHVC farmers. These activities will focus on pilot locations in drought-prone areas in the northwest, \nand  areas  vulnerable  to  cyclones,  flood  surges,  and  salinity  in  the  southwest,  following  a \nvulnerability assessment to develop effective adaptation options and strategies. \n \n\n2. \n\nValue Addition Support \n\n13. \nTo  take  advantage  of  value  addition  options  and  improve  marketing  efficiency,  marginal, \nsmall  and  medium  farmers  must  aggregate  their  produce  to  achieve  the  necessary  economy  of \nscale, capacity, or knowledge to operate beyond the basic farm-gate level. The project will provide \nfarmers  and  farmer  community  groups 18 with  training  and  awareness-raising  in  value  addition \noptions  to  improve  their  production  and  marketing  decisions,  and  increase  their  marketing \nefficiency and profitability. \n \n14. \nTo  reduce  postharvest  losses  and  improve  produce  quality  on  a  cost-sharing  basis,  the \nproject  will  support  farmer  community  investment  in  low-cost,  on-farm,  small-scale  infrastructure \n(OFSSI), which may include (i) on-farm (or near-farm) collection and postharvest handling centers, \nincluding washing, drying, sorting, grading, and packaging facilities; and (ii) small-scale cool, cold, \nand  dry  storage  and  market-related  transport  facilities.  Farmer  communities,  supported  by  DAE \nand contracted service providers, will be responsible for identifying the investment, preparing and \nsubmitting  a  proposal  to  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  for  evaluation,  providing  land,  and \noperating  and  maintaining  the  OFSSI  facilities.  The  Local  Government  Engineering  Department \n(LGED), under a memorandum of understanding, will assist the PMU in evaluating proposals and \ncontractors  to  be  hired  through  a  PMU-led  tendering  process.  LGED  field  staff  will  supervise \nconstruction works through to completion. \n \n\n3. \n\nCredit Support \n\nFunds  required  for  HVC  diversification  exceed  the  savings  of  most  small  farmers.19 The \n15. \nproject will provide access to credit to about 175,000 HVC farmers through financially sound MFIs \nexperienced  in  agriculture  credit,  following  a  similar  and  successful  partnership  approach \ndemonstrated  under  the  NCDP  and  the  Agribusiness  Development  Project.  Credit  phasing  will \nfollow and be linked to DAE farmer training and the establishment of demonstration plots. \n \n\n4. \n\nInstitutional Strengthening \n\nTrainers  and  staff  in  DAE  and  participating  MFIs,  at  upazila  and  district  levels,  will  be \n16. \ninstructed on the provision of training and extension services in HVC production and value addition \n\n                                                 \n17  The project will rehabilitate and upgrade six HDTCs in the southwest of Bangladesh under component 4. HDTCs in the \n\nnorthwest were upgraded and rehabilitated under the NCDP. \n\n18  Existing farmer community groups, including those already operating under component 1 and those under other aid-\n\nfunded projects with the same beneficiaries as the project, can be supported under this component. \n\n19  Subborrowers  rarely  have  more  than  Tk1,500  in  savings.  HVC  investment  for  0.2  hectares,  the  average  land  size \n\navailable for HVCs for small and medium farmers, requires Tk12,000 on average. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fto  farmers.  Department  of  Agricultural  Marketing  staff  will  also  participate  in  the  value  addition \ntraining.  Training  will  cover  gender  awareness  and  environmental  issues,  including  adaptation  of \nfarming systems to climate change. \n \n17. \nFollowing  surveys  and  needs  assessments,  DAE  district  and  upazila  offices  and  HDTCs, \nprimarily in the southwest, will be rehabilitated and equipped. Vehicles will be provided, mainly in \nthe  upazilas,  to  facilitate  communication  between  project  implementers  and  farmers,  and  to \ntransport  planting  and  other  necessary  materials  for  farmer  field  days  and  demonstrations.  The \nproject  will  undertake  a  feasibility  study  on  setting  up  a  quality  standards  certification  system  for \nfruits and vegetables farms to facilitate access to domestic retail markets, including supermarkets, \nand to reduce food contamination. \n \n\n5. \n\nProject Implementation Support \n\nin \n\nand \n\ntraining \n\nfarmers \n\n18. \nA  PMU  and  two  regional  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  will  provide  implementation \nsupport, comprising staff, office facilities and equipment, transport, consulting services, and liaison \nand development coordination with other ministries and development partners. The PMU will hire \none  community  facilitator  for  each  upazila  to  (i)  assist  DAE  staff  in  identifying  communities,  and \nmobilizing \nproject;  \ninterested \n(ii) help with gender awareness activities; (iii) liaise with MFIs; and (iv) help promote value addition \nactivities  within  communities.  A  project  performance  management  system  will  be  established. \nBaseline  surveys,  and  regular  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  undertaken.  The  PMU  will \nestablish  and  maintain a  project  website  to  disclose information  about project  activities, including \nprocurement procedures and results. LGED will appoint a project coordinator to liaise with DAE on \nOFSSI activities. \n \nD. \n \n19. \nTable 1. \n \n\nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $45.81  million.

An  MFI  selection  committee  comprising  the  project  director,  and \nauthorized representatives from Bangladesh Bank, Microcredit Regulatory Authority, BASIC Bank, \nand Eastern Bank will be responsible for the final selection of up to 10 participating MFIs based on \nthe selection criteria and financial due diligence assessments. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nA. \n \n24. \nAdoption  of  HVCs  will  lead  to  increased  agricultural  productivity  and  more  sustainable \nresource  use,  and  contribute  to  more  flexible  and  adaptive  management  of  climate  change \nimpacts.  The  project  will  lead  to  increased  HVC  production,  greater  diversification  of  sources  of \nincome, and higher net returns for marginal, small and medium farmers. Direct project beneficiaries \nwill  include  about  240,000  HVC-growing  households,  of  which  175,000  will  receive  credit.  The \nproject  is  expected  to  generate  more  than  37,500  person-years  of  annual  employment;  much  of \nthis employment will be among landless rural workers, including women. The financial internal rate \nof return of the project over 15 years is estimated at 46.7% and the economic internal rate of return \nat 38.6%. Sensitivity analyses incorporating a range of feasible risks show economic internal rates \nof  return  range  from  24%  to  38%.  These  risks  cover  a  20%  decline  in  the  project  area  and  20% \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fdecline  in  crop  yields.  The  economic  internal  rates  of  return  indicate  the  project  is  robust  and \nattractive from an investment point of view. \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed \n25. \nwith the Government of Bangladesh, DAE and Bangladesh Bank. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual. \n \nDAE  and  Bangladesh  Bank  have  implemented  numerous  aid-assisted  projects  and  have \n26. \nthe organizational structure, skills, and financial management system to implement the project. A \nprocurement  assessment  found  that  DAE  had  satisfactory  procurement  capacity.  A  financial \nmanagement assessment and due diligence were completed for the proposed executing agencies \nand  participating  financial  institutions.  Project-specific  measures  to  enhance  governance  and \nprevent  corruption  include  (i)  advance  selection  of  the  wholesale  banks  on  the  basis  of  agreed \ncriteria;  (ii)  formation  of  a  committee  of  stakeholders  to  select  participating  MFIs  according  to \nagreed  criteria;  (iii)  use  of  standardized  procedures  of  Bangladesh  Bank  in  its  supervision  of \nwholesale banks and, through them, the MFIs; (iv) the requirement for the PMU and PIUs to follow \ngovernment rules and procedures for all expense and capital items, including cash, and to properly \nmaintain  financial  records;  and  (v)  establishment  of  a  project  website  at  the  PMU  to  provide \ntransparency  on  project  details  including  procurement.  Further,  within  9  months  of  project \neffectiveness,  the  PMU  will  prepare  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  acceptable  to  ADB.  An \nindependent  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB  will  annually  audit  all  project-related  accounts  and \nstatements  of  expenditure  and  revenue,  and  provide  a  separate  audit  opinion  on  the  use  of  the \nimprest accounts and statement of expenditure procedure. \n \nC. \n \n27. \nThe project will contribute to economic growth and food security as well as directly benefit \nthe poor by creating employment opportunities in HVC on-farm and off-farm activities. Poor farmers \nwill  benefit  from  increased  incomes  due  to  returns  from  crop  production  and  increased  value \naddition through marketing interventions. The landless poor will benefit as agricultural laborers due \nto  the  creation  of  additional  employment  opportunities  in  HVCs  and  ancillary  industries.  Of  the \nanticipated 240,000 HVC farmer beneficiaries, 122,800 (50.8%) are living below the poverty line. In \nthe southwest and northwest areas, 51% of agricultural households are poor compared with 37% \nin  divisions  outside  the  project  area.  The  project  will  raise  incomes  of  farmers  by  Tk73,000  per \nhectare of HVC. Poor households growing HVCs will benefit from increased labor employment of \nTk3,230  per  household  and  Tk12,170  from  increased  crop  income  based  on  an  average  0.167 \nhectares  in  HVC  production  per  household.  In  total,  this  represents  an  increase  in  income  of \nTk15,400 per household (40% increase). \n \nThe project will have a positive impact on gender equality. The number of women involved \n28. \nin  commercial  agricultural  activities  is  expected  to  increase  by  10%  by  the  end  of  the  project  in \n2016. Women will improve their knowledge and capacity to undertake HVC production, postharvest \nhandling, and marketing activities through institutional and field-based training and participation in \nwomen\u2019s  forum  groups.  Furthermore,  the  use  of  MFIs  as  credit  providers,  with  their  pro-women \nattitude, will ensure greater involvement of women as loan recipients (20% increase by 2016) and \nin  cosigning  loans  with  their  husbands.  Participation  in  the  project  activities,  as  observed  in  the \nNCDP, will raise the social standing of women in the communities and improve their access to a \nbroader range of services. \n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nD. \n \n29. \nSafeguards  were  categorized  for  the  project.  The  project  falls  under  category  C  for \ninvoluntary resettlement, B for indigenous people, and B for environment. The envisioned project \ninterventions  will  not  entail  adverse  social  or  resettlement  impacts.  The  project  will  work  with \nfarmers  working  on  their  own  or  leased  land.  Limited  construction  will  be  on  government  land, \nexisting rights-of-way, or lands owned by the beneficiaries themselves. The project will exclude any \nsubprojects  that  entail  land  acquisition  or  any  involuntary  resettlement  including  relocation.  The \nproject  will  use  surveys  to  identify  the  presence  of  indigenous  people  when  starting  project \nimplementation in each project upazila. If identified, the indigenous people will be supported to be \ninvolved in crop diversification and value addition activities, through developing and implementing \nan indigenous people action plan as specified in the indigenous peoples development framework \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n \n30. \nThe project may have minor adverse environmental impacts like soil erosion, and harmful \neffects  from  inappropriate  use  of  chemical  fertilizers  and  pesticides  by  farmers  not  yet  fully \nknowledgeable  concerning  recommended  techniques.  Measures  to  mitigate  such  effects  and \nmonitoring  and  compliance  tasks  are  outlined  in  the  initial  environment  examination  and \nenvironmental assessment and review procedures to ensure the project's compliance with ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002)  and  all  applicable  environmental  laws  and  regulations  of  Bangladesh. \nSpecial consideration will be given to the potential impacts of climate change on the project goals \nto  promote  HVCs;  the  project  incorporates  detailed  adaptation  options  including  developing  and \ndisseminating  new  climate  change-resilient  crop  species.  Moreover,  actions  and  measures  are \nincluded  to  strengthen  the  in-house  capacity  of  DAE  in  dealing  with  environmental  issues  with \nspecial reference to climate change impacts. \n \nE. \n \n31.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4.  The  integrated  benefits \nand impacts of the project are expected to outweigh the potential costs from risks. \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nNatural disasters such as \nfloods and cyclones, and \nnegative impacts of \nclimate change \nDelays to the start-up of \nproject implementation \n\nPoor market connectivity \naffecting food and input \nprices and diversification \ninto HVCs \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nUpazilas with very high natural disaster risk were not selected for the \nproject. Extension advice and training provided by the project will help \nfarmers adapt to climate change impacts on HVCs. Climate-resilient crop \nproduction will be encouraged. \nThe project will reduce delays through the proposed retention of \nexperienced and capable implementation staff from the NCDP and use of \nthe project preparatory technical assistance savings to support project \nreadiness activities including the preparation of the government \ndocument\u2014the development project proposal. \nADB and development partners are supporting rural infrastructure \ndevelopment in the southwest and northwest areas to greatly open up \nmarket and social access for farmers. The proposed high-priority national \nproject, the Padma Multipurpose Bridge, will accelerate development of the \nimpoverished southwest and greatly broaden the marketing opportunities \nof HVCs from the project area. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, HVC = high-value crop, MFI = microfinance institution, NCDP = Northwest Crop \nDiversification Project. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nincluding \n\nThe government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set \n\nThe  government  has  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  will  conform  to  all \n32. \napplicable  ADB  policies \nthose  concerning  anticorruption,  safeguards,  gender, \nprocurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as  described  in  the  project  administration \nmanual and loan documents. \n \n33. \nforth in the loan agreement and project agreement. \n \n34. \nConditions for disbursement.
