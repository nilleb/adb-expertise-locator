Mongolia  is  experiencing  an  unprecedented  period  of  strong \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \neconomic  performance.  Real  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  averaged  7.9%  over   \n2003\u20132005 and rose to 8.4% in 2006, aided by sharp increases in copper and gold prices and a \nrecovery  of  the  livestock  herd  after  three  devastating  winters.  As  incomes  have  grown,  the \nexpansion  has  spilled  over  to  other  sectors  of  the  economy  including  construction,  financial \nservices,  and  the  retail  sector.  After  a  brief  upward  spike  in  2005,  inflation  has  been  brought \nback down to the mid-single digits (average of 8.4% over 2003\u20132005 and 6% in 2006), and the \nbudget has moved into surplus (a surplus of 3.9% of GDP in 2006 from a 7.7% deficit in 2000). \nStrong  monetary  growth  has  been  buoyed  by  economic  growth,  expanding  credit,  and \nincreasing financial depth. The exchange rate policy of Bank of Mongolia (the central bank) has \nkept the currency, the tugrik, fairly stable and free of swings over the past 5 years. The balance \nof  payments  has  been  in  surplus  since  2000,  reflecting  external  assistance,  a  strong  flow  of \nremittances  from  overseas  workers,  and  moderating  trade  and  current  account  deficits. \nInternational  reserves,  which  were  heavily  drawn  down  in  late  2003  in  connection  with  the \nsettlement of Mongolia\u2019s pre-1991 debt to the Russian Federation, have been reconstituted to \nmore  favorable  levels.  Total  external  debt  has  stayed  at  approximately  $1.6  billion  during  the \nperiod 2004 -2006, and most of it is concessional. Mongolia is rated B+/B+ by both Standard & \nPoor\u2019s  and  Fitch,  and  Ba2/B2  by  Moody\u2019s,  for  foreign  and  local  currency  long-term  debt \n(Appendix 1). \n \n3. \nEconomic Outlook and Challenges. The medium-term economic outlook for Mongolia \nis  positive\u2014assuming  stable  commodities  prices,  continued  foreign  direct  investment  inflows, \ngood macroeconomic management, and political stability. Projections are for GDP growth of 7%, \ninflation  of  6%,  and  a  current  account  surplus  of  2%  of  GDP  for  the  period  2007\u20132008. \nManufacturing, livestock, and services will all contribute to ongoing GDP growth. However, with \nsome large minerals deposits expected to come into production in 2009\u20132010, the country is on \nthe  verge  of  a  potential  mining  sector  boom,  which  will  be  a  major  driver  of  GDP  expansion. \nNevertheless,  the  economy  remains  susceptible  to  weather  and  commodity  price  shocks,  and \ngrowth is geographically concentrated with a narrow economic base. \n \nFinancial and Banking Sector. With combined assets amounting to over 80% of GDP \n4. \nand  over  90%  of  financial  sector  assets  in  2006,  the  banking  sector  dominates  Mongolia\u2019s \nfinancial  sector.  The  banking  sector  is  comprised  of  16  commercial  banks,  all  of  which  have \nbeen privatized, with four having foreign ownership. Following a series of banking crises in 1994, \n1996, and 1998, the financial performance of the banks has, in general, improved over the last \n3 years and the sector was profitable between 2000 and 2006. The banks generally adhere to \nBasel  Core  Principles  and  are  preparing  for  the  adoption  of  the  Basel  II  accord.  The  total \ncapital-to-asset  ratio  of  the  banking  sector  increased  from  below  4%  in  1998  to  17%  in  2005. \nAsset  quality  for  the  banks  has  also  improved,  despite  the  rapid  growth  in  lending\u2014annual \ncredit grew on average by 81.5% between 2000 and 2005, and by 42% in 2006, primarily driven \nby economic recovery, a more competitive financial market structure, and foreign capital inflows. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nCorporate Lending Trends and Prospects \n\nThe  officially  reported  nonperforming  loans  (NPLs)  ratio  declined  from  54%  in  1999  to  9%  in \n2006,  while  loan  loss  reserves  increased,  in  line  with  Bank  of  Mongolia  guidelines. \nNotwithstanding  this  improvement,  the  banking  sector  remains  at  an  early  stage  of  overall \ndevelopment, as indicated by the fact that most lending remains short-term and collateral-based \nand interest rates are high, reflecting a shortage of term funding and inadequate credit appraisal \nsystems at many banks (Appendix 2). \n \nB. \n \n5. \nCorporate Development in Mongolia. Recent changes in the income tax regime have \ncreated a favorable environment for business consolidation and the growth of larger companies. \nNew  tax  laws  enacted  in  June  2006  lowered  the  corporate  income  tax  rate  and  modified  the \ndual taxation system that until then was inducing companies to split in order to avoid a higher \ntax bracket. The new regime reduces the two corporate income tax rates from 15% and 30% to \n10%  and  25%,  and  also  increases  the  threshold  of  the  higher  rate  from  MNT100  million \n($85,000)  to  MNT3  billion  ($2.5  million).  Many  enterprises  that  officially  operated  as  individual \nsmall  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  in  the  past  to  avoid  the  higher  tax  rate  are  now \nmore  likely  to  officially  declare  their  true  organizational  structure  and  function  as  larger \ncompanies. There is considerable potential for  the development of corporate banking services \nand financial products that specifically meet the needs of corporate clients. \n \n6. \nLack of Financial Services as a Constraint to Corporate Growth. Traditionally, banks \nin  Mongolia  have  concentrated  on  retail  banking  and  collateral-based  lending  to  small \nenterprises. Few banks have corporate banking divisions and fewer still have concentrated on \ndeveloping corporate banking products tailored to the needs of larger corporations. As a result, \nthose  larger  companies  that  exist  attempt  to  their  meet  long-term  financing  needs  with  high \ninterest  rate,  short-term,  collateral-based  loans  and  often  find  it  difficult  to  meet  their  working \ncapital requirements. With the economy expected to grow substantially over the medium term, \nMongolian enterprises are expected to face rapidly growing demand. Without access to efficient \nfinancial  services,  these  enterprises  will  be  constrained  in  their  ability  to  expand  and  upgrade \ntheir  operations  to  meet  growing  demand,  heightening  the  need  for  long-term  financing  to \nsupport their growth.   \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE BORROWER \n\nBackground \n\n \nA. \n \n7. \nKhan  Bank  was  established  in  1991  as  the  Agricultural  Cooperative  Bank  of  Mongolia \nfrom the assets of the former State Bank, which was liquidated at the end of the communist era. \nKhan Bank was created with the specific goal of serving the rural sector. During its early years \nof  operation,  it  faced  serious  financial  problems  related  to  poor  management  and  political \nfavoritism in the disbursement of loans. In 1999, the World Bank made reforming Khan Bank a \ncondition of its Financial Sector Adjustment Credit Program for Mongolia, and the U.S. Agency \nfor  International  Development  (USAID)  agreed  to  provide  funds  for  an  outside  management \ncontract. In 2000, a contract was signed with Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI) of Bethesda, \nMaryland,  USA,  to  manage  Khan  Bank.  Management\u2019s  mission  was  to  (i)  restore  financial \nsoundness to Khan Bank, (ii) bring financial services to the country\u2019s rural population, and (iii) \nprepare Khan Bank to operate independently as a precursor to privatization. \n \n8. \nThe Bank was privatized in March 2003, with the purchase of 100% of the shares by H.S. \nSecurities  Company  Ltd.  (H.S.  Securities),  a  Japanese  conglomerate.  H.S.  Securities \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3\n\nsubsequently sold 40% of its shares to Tavan Bogd Trade, a local Mongolian conglomerate. In \n2004,  the  International  Finance  Corporation  (IFC)  purchased  a  9.1%  share  in  Khan  Bank  and \nDAI purchased an additional 2.2% share. In 2006, the chief executive officer purchased a 0.3% \nshareholding in Khan Bank \n \n9. \nKhan Bank is the main provider of financial services, both retail and business lending, in \nthe rural areas of Mongolia and increasingly in Ulanbaatar where it now has 54 branches and is \npenetrating the SME and corporate markets. With the largest branch network in the country\u2014\n440 locations, 88% of which are in rural areas\u2014Khan Bank provides deposit and loan products \nto almost 80% of the households in Mongolia. Looking to build on its success in the rural sector,  \nits growing penetration in Ulanbaatar and its solid reputation in the market, Khan Bank believes \nthat it is well placed to expand the scope of its operations with the aim of becoming the principal \nnationwide financial services company in Mongolia in the next 5 years, delivering a full range of \nbanking,  investment  banking,  leasing,  securities  and  possibly  insurance  services  in  both  rural \nand urban areas. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED LOAN \n\n \n\nADB Loan \n\nMain Terms and Conditions \n\n \nA. \n \nKhan Bank has identified a need to source US dollar financing in order to expand its US \n10. \ndollar lending activities. ADB proposes to provide a US dollar-denominated senior loan of up to \n$10 million to Khan Bank.  \n \nB. \n \n11. \nThe loan documentation will include financial covenants as well as covenants relating to \nADB\u2019s  policies. 1   ADB  will  ensure  that  its  rights  to  accelerate  and  enforce  its  debt  will  be \ntriggered under cross-default provisions with any outstanding debt facility.  \n \nC. \n \nADB will consider the possibility of including Khan Bank under ADB\u2019s regional technical \n12. \nassistance  (TA)  Capacity  Building  for  Financial  Institutions  program. 2   Possible  areas  of \nassistance under the TA would be capacity building for internal control procedures.  \n \n\nProvision of Technical Assistance \n\nV. \n\nINVESTMENT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nJustification of ADB Loan \n\n1. \n\nInvestment Objective \n\n \n13. \nADB\u2019s objective in the proposed transaction is to improve financial sector efficiency and \ndepth,  and  contribute  to  the  diversification  of  the  Mongolian  economy.  The  growth  of  larger \ncorporations  is  essential  to  the  sustainable  diversification  of  the  economy.  The  growth  of \n\n                                                 \n1  These  covenants  include  (i)  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  and  social  safeguard  policies;  (ii)  compliance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  policies  to  combat  money  laundering,  terrorism  financing,  and  corruption;  (iii)  the  maintenance  of \nadequate  debt  service  coverage  ratio,  accounts  receivables,  and  total  liabilities  to  net  worth  ratio;  and  (iv)  a \nnegative pledge on Khan Bank\u2019s existing assets.  \n\n2 ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance for Capacity Building for Financial Institutions. Manila. \n\n \nA. \n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\ncorporations is conditional on the availability of corporate lending services and financial services \nthat meet the specific needs of larger companies. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Outcome \n\n \n14. \nExpansion  of  Corporate  Banking  Activity.  The  growth  of  Mongolian  enterprises  to \noptimal  size  is  constrained  by  the  availability  of  term  lending  and  financial  services.  The \noutcome of  ADB\u2019s proposed loan will be to expand corporate banking activity and  provide the \nneeded financial services to allow the growth of Mongolian enterprises to optimal size. \n \n\n3. \n\nValue Added of ADB  \n\n15. \ngrow its corporate banking business. \n \n\nADB\u2019s proposed loan will add value by enabling Khan Bank to offer longer maturities and \n\n4. \n\nDesign and Monitoring Framework \n\n \n16. \nADB  will  measure  the  expected  development  impact  of  the  loans.  The  performance \nmeasures  will  follow  the  multilateral  development  banks\u2019  Evaluation  Cooperation  Group's \nStandards for Evaluation of Private Sector Investment Operations. Development impact will be \nmeasured in three distinct categories: (i) private sector development, (ii) business performance, \nand (iii) economic sustainability (Appendix 9).  \n \n\n5. \n\nFit to Sector and Country Strategy  \n\n \nOne  of  the  two  pillars  of  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP)  for  Mongolia 3  \n17. \napproved in 2005 aims to diversify the sources of growth. The CSP explicitly aims to develop a \nsound financial system with improved efficiency and outreach. The proposed loan will contribute \ndirectly  to  the  implementation  of  the  CSP  by  strengthening  financial  intermediation  for \nbusinesses  and  fostering  economic  diversification.  The  ADB  intervention  assists  in  deepening \nfinancial markets and providing long-term finance that meets the needs of entities that are most \nlikely to provide much-needed diversification of the Mongolian economy. \n \n18. \nADB\u2019s public sector operations for Mongolia also support the objectives described in this \nsection through projects including the Financial Regulation and Governance Program Loan4 and \nTA provided in association with the program, including assistance aimed at capacity building of \nthe  Financial  Regulatory  Commission.  The  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  Project 5  \ncurrently  under  preparation  expects  to  develop  the  export  capacity  of  larger  agro-processing \nenterprises, and the availability of adequate financial services will be crucial to the sustainable \ndevelopment  of  these  enterprises.  The  proposed  loan  is  therefore  also  in  line  with  activities \ncurrently undertaken by the East Asia Regional Department of ADB.   \n \nB. \n\nSocial and Environmental Safeguard Policies  \n\nThe proposed loan has been assigned an \u201cFI\u201d environmental classification and a \u201cC\u201d with \n19. \nrespect  to  indigenous  people  and  resettlement.  Khan  Bank  will  be  required  to  establish  an \nenvironmental management system, within a timeframe to be specified, following the prescribed \n\n                                                 \n3 ADB. 2005.

(ADB will review and \napprove  the  developed  EMS.)  Further,  Khan  Bank  will  build  capacity  for  implementing  it  in \naccordance with its specific business needs and with the help of ADB, and will send at least one \nKhan Bank officer to attend an ADB-sponsored environmental management training.  \n \n20. \nGiven Khan Bank\u2019s lengthy relationship with IFC, the Bank is familiar with the concept of \nan EMS, and has guidelines in place to help it in developing one appropriate to its business and \nneeds. The Bank is also interested in participating in ADB\u2019s EMS training program. \n \nC. \n\nAnticorruption Policy: Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of \nTerrorism \n\n \nKhan Bank was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and \n21. \npolicy  relating  to  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism 6.  Consistent \nwith  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  will  require \nKhan  Bank  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and  controls  following \ninternational  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism.  Further,  Khan  Bank  will  be  required  to \ncovenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. The documentation between ADB \nand Khan Bank will further allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these \nundertakings.   \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nThe  proposed  loan  would,  once  approved  by  the  Board,  represent  69%  of  ADB\u2019s  total \n22. \nnon-sovereign  exposure7  in  Mongolia,  and  would  increase  its  investment  in  (i)  Mongolia  from \n0.19% to 0.45%, and (ii) exposure in banking systems from 22.79% to 22.83%. The proposed \ninvestment  is  within  ADB\u2019s  aggregate,  country,  industry,  group,  and  single  project  exposure \nlimits for non-sovereign investments.  \n \n23. \nADB  will  enter  into  suitable  loan  agreements  following  approval  of  the  proposed \nfinancing  by  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors.  These  agreements  will  be  on  terms  and  conditions \nsatisfactory to ADB. \n \n24. \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nMongolian  Government  will  be  requested  to  confirm  that  it  has  no  objection  to  the  proposed \nADB loan to Khan Bank. No loan will be disbursed until ADB receives such confirmation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2003.

Recent  economic  performance  has  been  very  robust,  with \nstrong,  broad-based  growth,  declining  inflation,  growing  budget  and  balance  of  payments \nsurpluses, and improving confidence in the banking system. Real gross domestic product (GDP) \nis  estimated  to  have  risen  by  8.4%  in  2006,  higher  than  the  average  pace  achieved  during \n2002\u20132005.  The  minerals  sector  has  been  a  key  engine  of  growth,  supported  by  record  high \nprices for copper and gold; some increases in production volumes; and investment at the new \nIvanhoe copper and gold mine, which has not yet come on stream. Outside the mining sector, \ngrowth  has  also  been  supported  by  favorable  weather  conditions,  buoyant  residential  and \ncommercial construction, and rapid growth in financial services. Growth is projected at about 7% \nin 2007. \n \n27. \nInflation.  After  spiking  higher  in  the  first  half  of  2005,  inflation  has  since  slowed  to  a \nmoderate rate. The year-on-year inflation rate jumped from 10.5% in December 2004 to 17.5% \nin June 2005, partly because of a temporary shortage in the supply of meat which sent prices \nsoaring.  As  the  supply  shock  was  reversed,  inflation  declined  to  1.8%  (year-on-year)  in  July \n2006, the lowest level in 4 years. Inflation subsequently registered 5.1% for 2006. \n \nFiscal Indicators. The fiscal position has improved markedly in recent years, driven by \n28. \nthe rapid increase in copper prices and by faster-than-expected economic growth. The overall \nbudget balance shifted from a deficit of 4% of GDP in 2003 to a surplus of 3% in 2005 and 3.9% \nin  2006.  Underlying  the  dramatic  improvement  in  fiscal  performance  has  been  a  sevenfold \nincrease in mining revenues between 2003 and 2006 caused by (i) sharply higher copper and \ngold  prices,  and  (ii)  the  imposition  of  a  new  windfall  tax  on  copper  and  gold  in  June  2006. \nMeanwhile,  total  expenditure  has  fallen  from  42%  of  GDP  in  2003  to  an  estimated  31.5%  in \n2006, despite the 2006 introduction of a 30% wage increase and an expansion of social welfare \ntransfers.  Delays  in  the  execution  of  some  investment  projects  also  slowed  the  pace  of \nspending.  As  fiscal  performance  has  improved,  the  net  present  value  of  public  debt  dropped \nfrom  80%  of  GDP  at  the  end  of  2003  to  45%  at  the  end  of  2005.  As  of  year-end  2006,  it  fell \nfurther to 35%. \n \n29.  Monetary  Developments.  Monetary  aggregates  have  been  growing  rapidly.  Reserve \nmoney  growth  picked  up  from  20%  (year-on-year)  in  December  2005  to  27%  in  September \n2006. The acceleration in reserve money reflected strong foreign exchange inflows, which more \nthan  offset  a  substantial  decline  in  net  central  bank  credit  to  government.  For  the  banking \nsystem as a whole, broad money increased by 35% in 2006. Net domestic assets of the banking \nsystem declined in 2006, as a sharp drop in net credit to government  exceeded the impact of \nrapid  growth  in  credit  to  the  private  sector.  The  subdued  response  to  date  of  inflation  to  the \nrapid  monetary  growth  reflects  an  ongoing  process  of  re-intermediation  as  (i)  incomes  have \nrisen, (ii) confidence in the banking system has improved,  and (iii)  the gradual  appreciation  of \nthe exchange rate has helped to restrain the prices of imported goods.  \n \nExternal  Developments.  The  current  account  was  in  surplus  for  the  third  consecutive \n30. \nyear in 2006, and is expected to be about 2% in 2007 and 2008. The increase in the surplus has \nbeen  driven  by  a  marked  improvement  in  the  terms  of  trade,  which  more  than  offset  a  rise  in \nimport volume growth and higher investment income payments. With increased inflows of direct \ninvestment in the mining sector and a recovery in disbursements of concessional official loans, \ngross international reserves reached $687.3 million (5 months of imports of goods and services) \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nas of year-end 2006, while the net present value of external public debt fell to 32% of GDP, half \nthe level at year-end 2003. \n \n31. \nExchange  Rate.  Exchange  rate  developments  have  reflected  the  improvements  in  the \nterms  of  trade  and  capital  inflows.  The  real  effective  exchange  rate  of  the  togrog  has \nappreciated  by  about  18%  since  the  end  of  2004.  In  terms  of  the  US  dollar,  the  togrog \ndepreciated by 0.5% in 2005 but appreciated by 4% during the course of 2006. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n9\n\nBANKING SECTOR OVERVIEW AND PEER ANALYSIS \n \n\nA. \n\nBackground \n\nWith  combined  assets  amounting  to  over  80%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  and \n1. \nover 90% of financial sector assets, the banking sector dominates Mongolia\u2019s financial sector. \nThe sector has evolved since transition and has recently experienced considerable growth. After \na number of crises and bank failures after transition\u2014most severely in 1994, 1996, and 1998\u2013\n1999\u2014the stock of bank lending had remained in a range of MNT30 billion\u2013MNT40 billion up to \n2000. Since 2001, however, loan growth has risen substantially upon completion of substantial \nbanking  sector  reforms.1  The  total  capital-to-asset  ratio  of  the  banking  sector  has  increased \nfrom below 4% in 1998 to 17% in 2005. Annual credit grew on average by 81.5% between 2000 \nand  2005,  and  by  42%  in  2006,  primarily  driven  by  economic  recovery,  a  more  competitive \nfinancial  market  structure,  and  foreign  capital  inflows.  All  16  commercial  banks  have  been \nprivatized,  with  four  have  foreign  ownership.  Financial  performance  of  banks  in  general  has \nimproved in the last 3 years, and the sector was profitable during 2000\u20132006. \n \nB. \n\nRegulation and Supervision \n\n2. \nThe Banking Law, enacted in 1996 and amended a number of times since, provides the \nlegal basis for the Bank of Mongolia to regulate and supervise the banking sector. The Bank of \nMongolia\u2019s  supervisory  capacity  over  the  banking  sector,  just  as  its  role  as  the  regulator,  was \nextremely  weak  for  several  years.  However,  with  the  assistance  of  the  International  Monetary \nFund, the Bank of Mongolia has made substantial progress in strengthening its supervisory and \nregulatory  capacities.  As  part  of  this  process,  the  Bank  of  Mongolia  has  implemented  several \nreform  measures.  Among  the  most  significant  of  the  reform  measures  has  been  the  gradual \nincrease  in  the  minimum  capital  requirement  for  banks  (minimum  paid-in  capital  doubled  from \nMNT4 billion to MNT8 billion) and the strengthening of loan provisioning. There is now general \nadherence  to  Basel  Core  Principles.  Preparation  for  the  adoption  of  the  Basel  II  accord  is \nongoing. \n \n3. \n \n\nBank of Mongolia prudential regulations are summarized in Table A2.1.  \n\nTable A2.1: Bank of Mongolia Prudential Regulations \n\n \nCapital Adequacy \n\nBorrower Limits: \n \n   Single Borrower \n   Related Party \n   Aggregate Related Party \n\nAsset Quality: Classifications and Provisioning \n \n   In Arrears (up to 90 days past due) \n   Substandard (91\u2013180 days past due) \n   Doubtful (181\u2013270 days past due) \n   Loss (>270 days past due) \n\nTier I capital to net risk-weighted assets (5%) \nCapital to net risk-weighted assets (10%) \nTier I capital to total assets (5%) \n \n \n \n20% of bank capital \n5% of bank capital \n20% of bank capital \n \nProvision: \n \n                 5% \n                40% \n                75% \n               100% \n\n                                                 \n1  These included the restructuring of ailing banks, improvements in banking sector skills, accounting standards, the \n\nGovernment distancing itself from the banking sector, and foreign participation in the banking industry. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nLiquidity \n\nForeign Exchange Risk \n \n \n\n \n\nSource: Bank of Mongolia. \n \nC. \n\nPeer Analysis \n\nRatio of fixed assets <8% \n \nPrudential ratio of foreign assets and liabilities:  \n    For a given currency (+/-15%) \n    For total foreign currency (+/-40%) \n \n\n4. \nThe Mongolian banking industry is evolving into a two-tier system, consisting of a group \nof larger banks with strong shareholder support (most with foreign ownership) and a collection \nof smaller, mainly locally owned banks, some of which will have difficulty competing as they are \nundersized  and  under-matched.  Khan  Bank  is  considered  one  of  four  top-tier  banks  together \nwith  Trade  and  Development  Bank,  Golomt  Bank,  and  Anod  Bank.  Of  the  smaller  second-tier \nbanks, XAC Bank, Savings Bank, and Post Bank compete with Khan Bank in the rural sector. \n \nTrade  and  Development  Bank  is  the  largest  bank  in  Mongolia  in  terms  of  total  assets \n5. \nand  is  rated  Ba2  by  Moody\u2019s.  Primarily  a  corporate  bank,  its  competitive  position  could  be \nfurther  bolstered  because  of  a  recent  ownership  change  that  could  prompt  a  merger  with  two \nother  banks\u2014UB  City  Bank  and  Capitron  Bank\u2014and  expand  its  position  in  the  small  and \nmedium-sized  enterprise  (SME)  market.  The  Bank  of  Mongolia  is,  however,  scrutinizing  the \ntransaction  as  to  the  source  of  funds  applied  to  the  purchase.  Golomt  Bank,  also  a  largely \ncorporate-based bank, is aggressively expanding its Ulaanbaatar business, but it lacks a strong \nretail  network.  Anod  Bank  is  suffering  from  periodic  liquidity  problems  and  recent  growth  has \nbeen poor.  \n \n6. \nOf the smaller banks, XAC Bank, which has largely focused on microfinance in the past, \nis making a push into the SME market. XAC Bank has a well-managed franchise network in the \nrural  regions,  strong  profitability,  and  a  solid  capital  position  with  superior  asset  quality.  It  is \nrated  Ba2  by  Moody\u2019s.  However,  its  true  performance  is  uncertain  because  of  its  diverse \nsources of funds and donor support.
