THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Azerbaijan for the Countercyclical Support Facility Program. The report also \ndescribes the proposed technical assistance (TA) for Improving Public Sector Efficiency, and if \nthe Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The proposed countercyclical support facility (CSF) program will, in the short term, help \nthe government mitigate the significant negative economic impact caused by the crash in oil \nprices and the recession in the country\u2019s trading partners, which has triggered recession in \nAzerbaijan. The government\u2019s ongoing and planned fiscal stimulus expenditure includes social \nassistance programs, and promotion of inclusive private sector development and employment. \nThe country\u2019s compliance status with the access criteria for a CSF is in Appendix 4.1 The \nproposed TA will facilitate design of structural reforms covering macro fiscal management, \nstate-owned enterprise (SOE) reform, and finance sector development as well as augment \ncapacity of relevant government departments for implementation of the reforms. The medium-\nterm structural reforms could be supported further under a planned policy-based loan in 2017. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale  \n \n3.  Sharp  economic  downturn  caused  by  drop  in  oil  prices.  Azerbaijan  has  been \nexperiencing distresses, which has led to lower growth rate, fiscal uncertainty, and finance \nsector instability. Oil prices have fallen sharply, by almost 55% from June 2014 to October 2016 \n(Figure 1). Given that oil and gas revenues account for about 30% of gross domestic product \n(GDP), 60% of budget revenues, and over 90% of export revenues, the crash in oil prices had a \nsignificant negative effect on the economic growth. All components of GDP experienced a \nsudden drop including government expenditures, investments, consumption and net exports. \nGDP growth fell from 2.8% in 2014 to 1.1% in 2015. Azerbaijan entered into recession, with \nnegative GDP growth of 3.9% in the first three quarters of 2016 and a negative 2.4% forecast \nfor 2016 as projected by the International Monetary Fund (IMF; Figure 2). Asian Development \nOutlook 2016 also projects negative 2.5% growth in 2016. 2  \n \n4.  The  recession  stems  from  lower  hydrocarbon  revenues,  contraction  in  public \ninvestments (especially construction affecting private sector activity), and a tightened domestic \ndemand. The current account evaporated from a surplus of 14% of GDP at end-2014 to a deficit \nof 4.5% in the first half of 2016, and is expected to be negative 0.6% in 2016. Lower commodity \nprices resulted in a 47% decrease in export revenues in 2015, while the inflow of remittances \n(mainly  from  the  Russian  Federation)  suddenly  dropped  by  31%  to  $1.2  billion  hitting,  in \nparticular, the rural population. Exports further declined by 4.1% in the first half of 2016. The \ncurrency devaluation of major trading partners put substantial pressure on the national currency \nmanat  with  a  sharp  decline  in  foreign  exchange  supply.  Assets  of  the  State  Oil  Fund  of \nAzerbaijan (SOFAZ) declined by $3.5 billion to $33.6 billion (9.5%) in 2015, limiting the fiscal \nspace for budget transfers and leading to a reduction in economic activities financed by SOFAZ.   \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government  of  Azerbaijan,  State  Statistical  Committee.

Recession  adversely  affecting  real  incomes.  Given  the  economy\u2019s  hydrocarbon \nexport structure and public investment framework, the oil price shock had a strong impact on the \nreal economy. Real consumption growth decreased from 12% in 2014 to 8% in 2015 as the \npurchasing power of the population fell following depreciation of the manat. The Central Bank of \nAzerbaijan (CBA) devalued the manat by 49.4% in 2015 from 0.78 manat to a dollar in February \n2015 to 1.55 in December 2015, moving to a managed floating exchange rate regime. The \nmanat depreciated another 10.9% in 2016 to its current rate of 1.74. Consumer price inflation is \nexpected to rise to almost 12% in 2016 from 1.4% in 2014 (Figure 3). The high inflation is \nprimarily the result of the massive currency devaluation increasing the price of the consumption \nbasket. The devaluations also contributed to a significant drop in per capita income (current \nprices) from $8,055 in 2014 to $3,702 forecasted for 2016 (Figure 4). This fall in per capita \nincome will have significant adverse impact on imports of key consumer goods. The sharply \nrising debt service burden of individual borrowers, especially for enterprises and housing loans \ndenominated in foreign currency also negatively affected the purchasing power. 3 \n \n \nFigure 3: Inflation  Figure 4: Per Capita Income \n15 12.8    10,000\n8,000\n10 6,000\n4,000\n4.0 \n5 2.4  2,000\n1.4 \n0\n0 2013 2014 2015 2016\n2013 2014 2015 2016\u2026 (forecast)\n   \n Source: International Monetary Fund. 2016.

The CBA\u2019s foreign exchange reserves plummeted by \n71%  from  $13.7  billion  in  December  2014  to  $4.1  billion  in  October  2016.  The  currency \ndevaluation caused a loss of public confidence in the manat. This led to large-scale dollarization \n                                                \n3  The proportion of foreign currency denominated credit in total credit was 27% in January 2015 which increased to \n48% by August 2016. \n \n ", "3 \nof deposits\u2014from 38.5% in 2014 to 85% in 2016\u2014resulting in significant drop in bank deposits \nin local currency. Moreover, the devaluation severely affected the asset quality of bank loans to \ncustomers   prompting  sharply  increasing  loan  loss  provision  requirements,  and  as  a \nconsequence severely  affecting  profitability  and  eroding  banks\u2019  capitalization.  A  number of \nbanks were unable to mobilize additional equity injections by their shareholders and lost their \nlicenses. Twelve of the country\u2019s 36 banks were closed in the first three quarters of 2016. The \ncredit  growth  in  local  currency  turned  negative  due  to  non-availability  of  loanable  funds \ncontributing to credit crunch.4 For example, the number of rural borrowers serviced by the \nleading lenders has almost halved in 2016 since the first devaluation in February 2015. The cost \nof  sovereign  and  nonsovereign  borrowing  from  international  capital  markets  increased \nsignificantly following the country\u2019s credit rating downgrade by major rating agencies raising the \nrisk premium for borrowing.5  \n \n7.  Rising fiscal deficit and declining fiscal space. The impact of the oil shock can be \nillustrated as follows. Oil-related state budget revenues averaged $4.1 billion per quarter in the \nfirst three quarters of 2014. With the collapsing hydrocarbon price, oil revenue dropped to $2.4 \nbillion per quarter in 2015 and $0.9 billion per quarter in the first three quarters of 2016.6 \nCompared with the pre-shock period, the budget is receiving $3.2 billion or 79% less per quarter \nin 2016, which is large given the size of Azerbaijan\u2019s budget. Consequently, the consolidated \nbudget position changed from a surplus of 3.2% of GDP in 2014 to a deficit of 6.8% of GDP in \n2015, and the deficit is expected to rise to 9.9% of GDP in 2016. Falling oil revenues led to cuts \nin capital expenditures, slowing the economic growth.7 \n \n8.  Countercyclical  development  expenditures.  In  February  2016,  the  government \ninitiated a countercyclical stimulus package. To ensure the effectiveness and quality of such \nexpenditures, the government adopted a three-pronged strategy covering social assistance \nprograms, economic diversification toward strengthening the non-oil sector, and employment \ngeneration and additional SOFAZ expenditures. The government has budgeted $1.4 billion for \ncountercyclical measures in 2016 (Table 1).8 The accommodative budget in 2016 is appropriate \nfor this purpose; however the government is planning to revert to fiscal consolidation measures \nbuilding on preliminary steps taken in 2016.9 \n \nTable 1: Fiscal Stimulus Summary ($ million) \nGroups  2016 \nA.

To enhance social protection of the \nvulnerable population, the government took the following one-off measures in \n                                                \n4  The proportion of manat credit in in total credit fell from 73% in January 2015 to 52% in August 2016. \n5  On 24 March 2016, Azerbaijan\u2019s Southern Gas Corridor Company sold $1 billion in a 10-year Eurobond, which was \n80 basis points above Azerbaijan\u2019s sovereign bonds, with a coupon of 6.875%. \n6  Government of Azerbaijan, Ministry of Finance. Information (operative) on the execution of the state budget for \n2015. http://www.maliyye.gov.az/node/1871 \n7  The consolidated budget includes the state budget, SOFAZ budget, social protection fund budget, external \nborrowings, and the budget for the autonomous region of Nakhchivan. \n8  This figure does not include 1 year\u2019s salary of 31,500 minimum wage workers.  \n9  Going forward, the government has agreed not to repeat the 2016 pensions, wages, and social spending \nincreases, to resume capital spending reductions and to lower pension deficits with the new pension legislation. \n ", "4 \nMarch 2016 targeting an estimated 3.7 million people representing more than \none third of the population: (a) the wages of public employees were increased by \n10% in the social security, education, science, culture, and agriculture sectors; \n(b) the floor for retirement benefits was raised by 10% to AZN110 monthly; (c) \nthe amount of social benefits, health benefits, and food allowance for both public \nand  private  workers  and  refugees  increased  by  10%;  and  (d)  an  additional \nAZN20 million was allocated from the Reserve Fund of the President to support \nlow-income  families.  The  government  has  also  made  additional  budgetary \nprovision for social housing and tax benefits targeting low-income population. \nThe  State  Housing  Agency  has  been  established,  with  an  approved \norganizational structure, regulations, and staff, to provide social housing to low-\nincome and vulnerable groups. The government has allotted to build affordable \napartments benefiting around 9,000 people.10 It has also established a student \ncredit fund to cover tuition fees for students from low-income families during the \neconomic downturn. The fund provides grants and concessional loans via credit \norganizations. \n(ii)  Stronger focus on economic diversification. The crisis, which was triggered \nby the plummeting hydrocarbon prices, reminded the government of the need to \ntransform the hydrocarbon-driven economy into a private sector-driven economy \nwith well-diversified activities in non-oil sectors. The government has provided \nadditional incentives to private investors, such as tax preferences and promotion \nof non-oil exports. Amendments to the Tax Code and the decree of the President \nof Azerbaijan \u201cOn additional measures to promote export of non-oil products\u201d \nprovide investors who invest in priority sectors with a certificate of incentives, as \nwell as exemption from land and property taxes, and customs duties on imported \nequipment, for 7 years. Moreover, 50% of investor earnings are tax-exempt for 7 \nyears, and exporters will receive a special export promotion compensation of 3% \nof the value of exported non-oil products. \n(iii)  Stimulating  employment  generation  and  efficiency  in  labor-intensive \nsectors. The recession has increased unemployment, which rose to 5% in 2015. \nAzerbaijan\u2019s growth has been less inclusive because of the capital intensive \nnature of the economy, the dominance of the oil sector and limited private sector \nactivity. Consequently, the government is introducing reforms in labor market \ninstitutions and policies by modernizing vocational education, initiating life-long \nlearning  and  prioritizing  employment  of  youth,  women,  and  disabled  and \ninternally displaced persons. Such countercyclical measures are addressing the \nfollowing labor market challenges: (a) low-value agriculture due to small-sized \ncrops production and limited access to finance; (b) lack of business skills and \ninnovation from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); (c) preference for \npublic sector employment as compared to the private sector; and (d) the supply \ndemand labor skills mismatch, which does not meet market needs. Additional \nsteps  taken  include  measures  for  supporting  entrepreneurial  activities  and \nstimulating  SMEs  for  creating  jobs.  Additional  investment  by  SOFAZ  for \nrestructuring  state-owned  enterprises  and  revenue  generating  infrastructure \nprojects is also expected to revive growth and generate employment.11 \n \n                                                \n10 The State Housing Agency is administering the project, with an administrative budget of AZN10 million and 60 \nstaff.  \n11 SOFAZ.

Sound  pre-shock  record  of  macroeconomic  management.  Until  the  oil  shock, \nmacroeconomic management was largely effective in achieving economic growth and stability. \nThe CBA\u2019s monetary policy and exchange rate measures were effective in addressing price \nstability, with inflation averaging 1.6% during 2012\u20132014, and in managing the exchange rate. \nPublic finances and budgetary frameworks were sound, with debt\u2013GDP at 11.2% in 2014. The \nstate budget was in surplus until 2014. SOFAZ capital increased from $22.8 billion in 2010 to \n$37.1 billion in 2014, providing a large buffer to shocks and transforming hydrocarbon revenues \ninto long-term investment returns for the country. Consequently, Azerbaijan had international \ncredit rating of investment grade before the shock.  \n \n10.  Adequate macroeconomic policy response during crisis. The recession triggered \nmonetary and financial stability measures during 2015 and 2016, which aimed at maintaining \nprice  stability  and  restructuring  the  banking  system,  while  preventing  a  post-devaluation \neconomic slump. In December 2015, the CBA moved to a managed floating exchange rate \nregime and instituted the exchange rate band to allow more market-based price discovery and \naiming for inflation targeting in the medium term. The CBA tightened the monetary policy stance \nto limit inflationary pressure and to restore trust in the local currency. The CBA raised the \nrefinancing rate five times in 2016 from 3% to 15% cumulatively, and initiated deposit auctions \nby holding 10 auctions in 2016, increasing the interest rate on deposits from 6.5% to 9.5%. The \nextension of the deposit insurance guarantee to cover all deposits, subject to interest rate \nrestrictions, was another policy response to address the large-scale dollarization in the banking \nsystem.12 To prevent further deposit withdrawals from banks, the interest income on deposits \nearned by individuals was made tax-exempt for 3 years starting February 2016. \n \n11.  Managing  banking  sector  crisis  and  restoring  confidence.  The  regulatory  and \nsupervisory functions of the banking, insurance, and capital markets are consolidated under the \nFinancial Markets Supervision Authority (FMSA), the new single regulator and supervisor. To \naccommodate banks\u2019 management of the increased exchange rate volatility, the FMSA widened \nthe  regulatory  limit  for  open  currency  positions  to  regulatory  capital.  In  mid-2015,  the \ngovernment created a bad bank special purpose vehicle to manage nonperforming assets \ntransfered from International Bank of Azerbaijan, a state-owned bank and the largest bank in \nthe country. To restore confidence in the banking system, the FMSA is currently  pursuing \nconsolidation of banks and has so far closed 12 insolvent banks. The FMSA is assessing all \nbanks and agreed on specific restructuring plans with banks that have solvency issues with a \nclear road map and timeline to address such issues. In July 2016, a Financial Stability Board, \nchaired by the Prime Minister, was established with representation of CBA, MOF, FMSA, and \nSOFAZ to monitor the financial sector performance and recommend remedial actions based on \ninternational  experience.  Under  the  attached  TA,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will \nsupport the FMSA in developing capital markets to support diversification of the economy and \nexpansion of the private sector.  \n \n12.  The shocks highlighted the urgent need for structural reforms. The recession has \nexposed the limitations of the country\u2019s economic development model and the need to move \naway from growth driven mostly by public capital investments towards the one focused on \nprivate sector activity as professed in the development strategy \u201cAzerbaijan 2020: Look into the \nFuture.\u201d13 In February 2016, the President of Azerbaijan appointed a presidential focal point on \n                                                \n12  Limited to deposits denominated (i) in manat priced at interest rates up to 12%, and (ii) in foreign currency priced at \nup to 3%. \n13  Office of the President of Azerbaijan. 2012. Azerbaijan 2020: Look Into the Future Concept of Development. \nhttp://www.president.az/files/future_en.pdf \n ", "6 \neconomic reforms, and established an interagency working group to develop and coordinate the \nexecution  of  a  strategy  for  economic  diversification  comprising  governance  reforms, \ndevelopment of non-oil export sector and improvement of the business climate.  \n \n13.  Governance  reforms.  Strengthening  macroeconomic  and  fiscal  management  and \nmanaging state-owned enterprises (SOE) is a government priority. Overall, public financial \nmanagement  systems  are  effective  but  the  recession  pointed  to  important  gaps  that  the \ngovernment is planning to address.14 These include (i) rule-based fiscal management that would \nrequire building capability for medium-term expenditure and macroeconomic forecasting, (ii) \naligning  sector  strategies  with  long-term  national  development  strategy,  (iii)  integration  of \nfinancial management systems and better analysis of planned and actual budget data through \nintroduction of program budgeting, (iv) strengthening public investments by improving feasibility \nand  project  management  capacities,  and  (v)  developing  a  medium-term  public  debt \nmanagement strategy. Many of the country\u2019s 10,540 SOEs are incurring losses and receiving \nbudget subsidies.15 As part of the planned SOE reforms, the president of Azerbaijan issued a \ndecree  in  September  2016  to  facilitate  entrepreneurship  and  competition  in  SOEs  by \nencouraging participation of private investors. The decree sets a time bound plan to (i) formulate \nrules for evaluating the performance of SOEs, (ii) develop corporate governance principles and \napply international management practices, and (iii) introduce international financial reporting \nsystems and necessary structural reforms to increase financial transparency and efficiency of \nlarge SOEs. The government has started listing SOEs for privatization beginning in 2016. The \nattached TA will support these reforms. \n \n14.  Development of non-oil sector. In the wake of oil shock, transformation to an export-\noriented economy characterized by non-oil sector growth and expanding non-oil export potential \nis a major priority of the government. A presidential decree issued in March 2016 implemented \nmeasures to stimulate the export of non-oil products.  These include opening new e-government \nservice  centers;  improving  public  construction  tenders;  simplifying  customs  clearance; \nincreasing  electronic  payments;  creating  regional  industrial  zones;  extending  agriculture, \ntourism,  and  environmental  reforms;  and  promoting  regional  economic  integration.  The \ngovernment  intends  to  enact  a  new  pension  legislation  in  2017  that  would  increase  the \nretirement  age  and  contribution  periods;  this  is  expected  to  cut  pension  fund  deficits.  To \nstimulate the development of SMEs, the entrepreneurship law was amended in March 2016. \nAttached  TA  will  assist  the  government  in  developing  an  SME  institutional  and  financing \nstrategy for inclusive finance. The government is also pursuing efforts to diversify the economy \nby improving the business climate and by expanding the financial sector. Azerbaijan\u2019s financial \nsystem is underdeveloped with vulnerabilities to external systemic risks. The binding constraints \nbeing  addressed  include  underdeveloped  financial  markets,  nascent  government  securities \nmarket, and limited financial inclusion due to the lack of local currency lending, especially for \nmicroenterprises, farmers, and small businesses. \n \n15.  ADB\u2019s proposed program. In the short-term, ADB will provide CSF program to mitigate \nthe adverse impact of the economic recession. ADB and the government also agreed that \ntransforming Azerbaijan into a dynamic and diversified economy will require comprehensive \nimprovements in governance, ease of doing business, and fostering competition in the economy. \nAs highlighted in the development policy letter, the government has, therefore, sought ADB\u2019s \nassistance to support structural reforms in the medium-term related to the three broad directions. \n                                                \n14 World Bank. 2014.

Budget Package-2015. Baku. \n ", "7 \nThese  directions  will  be  incorporated  in  a  planned  policy-based  loan,  which  will  cover  (i) \nstrengthening macroeconomic and fiscal management by establishing medium-term fiscal and \ndebt  management  frameworks;  (ii)  improving  public  sector  efficiency  and  accountability  by \ndeveloping  a  public  investment  framework,  as  well  as  restructuring  and  preparing  the \nprivatization of SOEs; and (iii) deepening the finance sector and expanding the role of the \nprivate sector by developing securities and capital markets and promoting SME development.  \n \n16.  Public debt remains sustainable. A realistic oil price scenario in line with the Asian \nDevelopment  Outlook  2016  and  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  April  2016  World \nEconomic Outlook would see Azerbaijan\u2019s public debt\u2013GDP ratio rise from 28.3% in 2015 to \n38.2% (37.5% is the IMF estimate) in 2016 and stabilize thereafter.16 Thus, the public debt ratio \nwill remain manageable.17 This scenario reflects improved primary deficits, higher economic \ngrowth, as well as a projected rise in asset revenues. Traditionally, Azerbaijan has not borrowed \nto fund budget deficits. Instead, deficits have been financed mainly by transfers from SOFAZ, \nwhich contributed about 40% to total government revenues over 2010\u20132014. The projected \npublic  indebtedness,  including  the  potential  impact  of  the  prospective  CSF  borrowing,  is \nsustainable as the ADB loan comprises a small portion of the country\u2019s overall financing needs. \nThe medium-term outlook is acceptable in terms of creditworthiness.18 \n \n17.  Coordination with the International Monetary Fund. The ADB team has consulted \nand  coordinated  closely  with  the  IMF  on  Azerbaijan\u2019s  macroeconomic  situation  and  future \nprospects. It overlapped with the IMF Article IV mission that concluded in June 2016. The IMF \nmission confirmed that shocks adversely affected Azerbaijan\u2019s economy, especially the fall in oil \nprices, slowdown in economic growth, and currency depreciations in Azerbaijan and its main \ntrading partner economies. As a result, the IMF projects economic growth to turn negative (\u2013\n2.4%) in 2016. The IMF supports the government\u2019s response to the weak external environment, \nincluding moving to a floating exchange rate regime, raising interest rates in 2016 to address \nrising inflation, and implementing a countercyclical fiscal stimulus in 2016 that focuses on \nraising wages, pensions, targeted social assistance, employment generation, and completing \nexisting investment projects. The government has agreed with IMF on the appropriateness of \ncountercyclical spending but to embark on consolidation from 2017. \n \n18.  The IMF also strongly endorses the government\u2019s planned move to a new economic \nmodel  focused  on  private  sector-led  growth  driven  by  the  non-oil  economy  as  the  main \nchallenge  is  to  align  macro  policies  with  the  new  external  environment  while  modernizing \nmonetary and fiscal frameworks. The structural reform agenda needs to be implemented, with \ngovernance strengthened, the cost of doing business reduced and competition enhanced. The \ngovernment has agreed with the IMF on instituting a rule-based fiscal framework and strong \ninstitutional  arrangements  to  preserve  fiscal  sustainability  in  the  medium  term.  The  IMF \nunderscored  that  a  rule-based  framework  supplemented  by  a  strong  public  financial \nmanagement system, detailed multiyear budgets and a public debt strategy will strengthen fiscal \ndiscipline. In addition, expanding debt securities market will help in deepening the country\u2019s \nfinancial sector.   \n \n                                                \n16 The realistic scenario is based on an oil price of $38 in 2016 and increasing to $50 per barrel in 2020. ADB. 2016. \nAsian  Development  Outlook  2016:  Asia\u2019s  Potential  Growth.  Manila;  IMF.  2016.  World  Economic  Outlook. \nWashington, DC. \n17 The size and composition of SOFAZ assets have a strong bearing on the country\u2019s debt sustainability. IMF analysis \nalso suggests that the debt\u2013GDP ratio will remain manageable (IMF Assessment Letter accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 More details are in Debt Sustainability Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n19.  ADB\u2019s value addition. ADB has agreed on a medium-term development engagement \nframework  with  the  government.  In  the  short  term,  ADB  is  supporting  the  government\u2019s \nimplementation of countercyclical expenditure program by helping to reduce the risks of fiscal \nand debt sustainability. In the medium to long term, ADB is engaging with the government on \ndesign and implementation of structural reforms by providing TA and planned policy based \nprogram (paras 15 and 26). ADB\u2019s support for infrastructure investment especially in energy, \ntransport, and urban infrastructure will complement the CSF. ADB has coordinated closely with \nthe IMF and the World Bank in identifying policy and program areas. The World Bank is \nsupporting the government on finance sector modernization including the business environment, \ncompetition policies, pension reforms, and banking sector restructuring. The IMF is providing TA \non banking and finance sector oversight and planning a TA to help address fiscal issues. ADB \nwill coordinate with IMF on implementation of the TA. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome  \n \n20.  The  impact  will  be  sustained  broad-based  inclusive  growth.  The  outcome  will  be \nexpenditures for fiscal stimulus introduced. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n21.  The CSF will have four outputs: (i) measures to provide a social safety net to citizens \nimplemented, (ii) measures to facilitate social housing implemented, (iii) measures to create \nadditional jobs implemented, and (iv) measures to identify and initiate specific structural reforms \nfor economic diversification implemented. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n22.  SOFAZ transfers to the state budget form the basis of the government\u2019s fiscal policy, \nand have provided a large buffer to enable an expansionary fiscal policy. The activities carried \nout  by  SOFAZ  contribute  to  (i)  maintaining  macroeconomic  stability,  (ii)  financing  national \nprojects crucial to socioeconomic development, and (iii) ensuring intergenerational transfer of oil \nrevenues. Procedures governing SOFAZ financing and spending are determined by a statutory \npolicy that postulates reserving 25% of revenues for savings and intergenerational purposes. \nExpenditures  incurred  by  SOFAZ  are  part  of  a  consolidated  budget  that  is  approved  by \nParliament annually. SOFAZ has an independent investment strategy, and 82.1% (as of 2015) \nof its assets are invested in securities. Since 2013, the government has been downwardly \nadjusting transfers from SOFAZ to maintain critical assets to satisfy its long-term investment \nobjective and stimulate an increase in non-oil fiscal revenues.  \n \n23.  However,  to  meet  budget  expenditures  in  2016,  the  government  transferred  an \nadditional  $1  billion  from  SOFAZ  to the  state  budget.  Despite this  transfer,  the  estimated \nconsolidated budget deficit of 9.9% of GDP ($3.4 billion) will remain in 2016. The government \nbelieves that additional transfers from SOFAZ are not in line with the government policy of \nensuring intergenerational equity and sustainability of oil revenues. Further transfers would also \nnot be prudent since oil production is expected to further decline in 2016\u20132019, with oil prices \nbelow historical averages, and any increase in SOFAZ transfers would increase the scale of the \nfiscal deficit. Some 90% of Azerbaijan\u2019s currency reserves comprise SOFAZ assets. It is critical \nto preserve these assets to maintain the country\u2019s international credit rating.19 \n \n                                                \n19 Azerbaijan was rated BB+ (Negative) by Fitch, BB+ (Negative) by Standard and Poor\u2019s, and Ba1 (negative) by \nMoody\u2019s in 2016, a notch below the investment grade. \n ", "9 \n24.  To fill the budget deficit, the government will need to tap capital markets or access \ninternational financial institutions. The cost of borrowing from the market has increased because \nof the higher perceived country risk, as shown by market indicators like credit default swap \nspreads and the international credit rating downgrade resulting from the economic recession \nand fall in oil prices. To mitigate this risk, the government has requested ADB to provide a loan \nof $500 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. The remaining portion of the consolidated \ndeficit will be financed through the issuance of international bonds and from internal sources. \nThe  interest  rate  for  the  CSF  loan  will  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility  plus  200 basis  points;  a  5-year  term, \nincluding a grace period of 3 years; a commitment charge of 75 basis points on undisbursed \nloan balances; and such other terms and conditions as are in accordance with those set forth in \nthe draft loan agreement.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n25.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  CSF.  The \ngovernment, through MOF, will monitor budget execution and flow of funds for countercyclical \nmeasures. The government, through MOF, will submit to ADB reports on expenditures made \nfrom the state budget to support the countercyclical measures. The program implementation \nperiod is January 2016 to February 2017. \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n26.  To  support  the  preparation  of  a  planned  policy-based  loan  in  2017  that  builds  on \nstructural reforms initiated in 2016, policy and advisory TA for Improving Public Sector Efficiency  \nis proposed, with total cost of $1.3 million, of which $1.2 million will be financed by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources) .  The  government  will  provide \ncounterpart support in the form of staff, office, administrative and logistics support, interpretation, \nand other in-kind contributions. The TA outputs and activities are (i) public debt management, \nincluding a review of the legal framework, and designing a medium-term debt management \nstrategy and system; (ii) macro-fiscal management, including the development of medium-term \nfiscal and expenditure frameworks, program-based budgeting, training and capacity building, \nand mitigating fiscal risks and contingent liabilities related to SOEs; (iii) SME development, \nincluding a review of the legal and regulatory framework, designing an SME development \nstrategy, and capacity building; and (iv) SOE management and capital market development, \nincluding a review of the legal and institutional framework, diagnosis of the securities market, \nand improving the financial management and governance of select SOEs.20  \n \n27.  The TA will also assess and report on the effectiveness of the countercyclical measures. \nIt will be implemented from January 2017 to January 2019. MOF will be the executing agency, \nand Ministry of Economy and the FMSA will be the implementing agencies. All consultants will \nbe recruited in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from \ntime to  time).  All  disbursements  under the TA  will  be  made  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n20  Rail transport is one of the subsectors being considered for in-depth SOE work. \n ", "10 \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Governance \n \n28.  Budget comprehensiveness and transparency, as well as predictability and control in \nbudget execution, have improved significantly since 2014. Weaknesses remain in external and \ninternal audit, especially in the line ministries, which have been taken up in the Public Financial \nManagement Action Plan adopted by MOF. Azerbaijan currently uses an adhoc fiscal policy \nframework with drawdown from SOFAZ not following any formal fiscal rules. 21 A rule-based \nfiscal framework is needed to promote fiscal discipline. Improvement of fiscal management is a \nkey reform being addressed under the attached TA. Corporate governance in SOEs is not \nadequately developed. The Ministry of Economy has made several awareness-building efforts \nto  promote  corporate governance  principles  in  SOEs  by  organizing  seminars  and  training. \nHowever, the use of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Principles of \nCorporate Governance is limited, which makes it difficult to assess the performance of SOEs by \ninternational standards. The policy and advisory TA will help address corporate governance \nissues. The government has placed combating corruption high on its agenda, announcing a \u201cno \ntolerance\u201d policy toward corruption in 2011. Efforts on combating corruption since 2005 indicate \nimportant  improvements  that  are  acknowledged  by  regional  anticorruption  bodies.  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment. \n \nB.  Poverty and Social \n \n29.  The poverty ratio has declined sharply, from 49% in 2001 to 11% in 2009 and 5% in 2014. \nThis has mainly been driven by strong economic growth, a rise in wages, and successful social \nprotection measures. Sustaining high growth and maintaining social protection initiatives have \ncome under severe stress after the oil price shocks and the ensuing economic recession. The \nCSF program plays a critical role in this context. Government initiatives supported under the loan \nwill help mitigate price and income shocks, especially to the vulnerable population. The proposed \nfacility is expected to be followed by a policy-based loan to help the government transform the \neconomy  into  a  diversified  and  dynamic  economy  that  supports  inclusive  growth.  Reforms \nproposed under the policy-based loan will improve the allocative efficiency of public resources, \nparticularly in health, education, and other social services. There is also a gender pay gap \nattributed to high levels of vertical segregation in the labor market. Women are concentrated in \nlower-paid public sector activities such as education, health, and social services. Government \nmeasures  to  increase  salary  in  these  sectors under  the  countercyclical  fiscal  package  will \ncontribute in protecting the purchasing power of women. \n \nC.  Safeguards \n \n30.  Following an assessment of the outputs, the CSF program will not have any likely social \nor environmental safeguard issues, and will not trigger ADB\u2019s safeguard policies. It is assigned \ncategory C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \n                                                \n21 Azerbaijan is an early member of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and was given compliant \nstatus in 2009. The EITI redefined its standards in 2013 and now includes more comprehensive requirements for \ncivil society engagement. Against these new standards, Azerbaijan was downgraded to candidate status in 2015. \nDuring its October 2016 meetings, EITI\u2019s board concluded that Azerbaijan has made meaningful progress with \nconsiderable improvements, maintaining the country\u2019s candidate status. The government is expected to continue \nimplementing corrective actions to regain compliant status in 2017. \n ", "11 \nD.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n31.

Adverse impact of the crisis  In 2014, Azerbaijan encountered economic slowdown due to slump \n  in global oil prices. Oil prices fell sharply by 57% from their peak in \n2014 to August 2016. Given the fact that oil and gas revenues \naccount for more than 30% of GDP, 60% of budget revenues, and \nmore than 90% of Azerbaijan\u2018s exports, the drop in the oil price has \nhad  a  significant  negative  effect  on  the  economy  and  growth. \nOverall,  all  components  of  GDP  experienced  a  sudden  drop \nincluding government expenditures, investments, consumption and \nnet exports. The shock was felt through various channels: (i) fall in \nbudget revenues and contraction in public investments (especially \nconstruction)  and  hence  private  sector  activity,  (ii)  evaporated \ncurrent account surplus, (iii) pressure on local currency in light of \ndevaluations in neighboring and trading countries, and (iv) sudden \ndrop in remittances(mainly from the Russian Federation) hitting, in \nparticular, the rural population. Eventually, CBA devalued manat \nand switched to the floating exchange rate regime and national \ncurrency lost its cumulative value by 57% in 2015. \ni.  Azerbaijan experienced a  GDP growth fell from 2.8% in 2014 to 1.1% in 2015, with non-oil \nsignificant reduction in  GDP growth falling from 6.9% in 2014 to 1.1 in 2015. In the first \ngrowth, exports and  nine months of 2016, GDP growth was negative 3.9% and non-oil \nremittances; increase in  GDP growth was negative 6.1% This decline stems from a lower \ndollarization; and a  hydrocarbon  output,  contraction  of  public  investments  and  a \ncontraction in bank lending  tightened domestic demand. It is expected that GDP may decline \n  by 2.4% in 2016.  \n   \nLower  commodity  prices  together  with  reduced  growth  and \ndevaluation of local currencies in trading partners in 2014-2015 \nresulted  in a 47% decrease in export revenues in 2015,  while \nremittances decreased by 31% to $1.2 billion. Given the economy\u2019s \nhydrocarbon export structure and public investment framework, oil \nprice  shock  had  a  strong  impact  on  the  real  economy.  Real \nconsumption growth \u2013 another key economic growth driver, fell \nfrom 12% in 2014 to 8% in 2015, due to the devaluation of the \nmanat and decline in consumer lending. \n \nThe current account turned into a deficit of 0.4% of GDP by 2015 \nfrom a surplus of 14% of GDP in 2014. The current account is \nexpected to remain in deficit in 2016. These developments put \nsubstantial pressure on the foreign exchange market with a sharp \ndecline in foreign exchange supply and a rise in foreign exchange \ndemand. The official international reserves of the CBA plummeted \nby about $2.3 billion during December 2014 and January 2015 \nalone. In an attempt to respond to these external shocks, CBA \ndevalued manat, the national currency, by 57% in 2015. At the \nsame time the CBA announced a shift from pegged exchange-rate \nsystem to a managed float. The currency devaluations resulted in a \nloss of credibility of monetary policy and confidence in the manat. \nThis  led  to  a  large-scale  dollarization  worsening  bank  balance \nsheets  and  aggravating  liquidity  risks  in  the  banking  sector,  in \nparticular. \n \nDevaluation  of  the  local  currency  had  an  adverse  impact  on \n ", "  Appendix 4  21 \nCountercyclical Support  Asian Development Bank Assessment \nFacility Criteria and Indicators \ninflation in 2015 because half of consumption is imported. The \nnegative impact will persist, and inflation is expected to remain high \nin 2016 at around 12%. \n \nThe banking sector was hit hard by currency depreciation, as credit \nrepayment  ability  of  households  and  businesses  deteriorated, \nleading  to  higher  non-performing  loans  and  lending  problems. \nAdditionally,  the  value  of  credits  went  down  by  $6.2  billion, \nequivalent to 26% in 2015, and lack of credit availability negatively \naffected the capital formation in the country. Credit growth turned \nnegative  due  to  weak  economic  activity,  mismatches  in  banks\u2019 \ncurrency positions and expectations of further devaluations. The \ndrop  in  credit  to  the  economy  affected  the  rural  economy \nsignificantly. Since the first devaluation in February 2015 when the \ntwo leading lenders serviced loans to 280,000 rural borrowers, the \nclientele dropped by nearly 50% to about 150,000. \n \nThe banking system faced increasing non-performing loan ratios \ndue  to currency mismatches as bank credits were mainly in dollar \nterms, while wage and salaries of people in national currency. In \naddition,  decelerating  economic  activity  in  the  country  and  the \nclosure of workplaces (40,000 workplaces closed in 2015) made it \nharder to repay loans in manat.  \n \nSince 2000, income per capita (current prices) steadily increased to \n$8,055 in 2014, but declined to $5,739 in 2015, and is expected to \ndecline further to $3,702 in 2016. Additionally, the share of income \ndevoted to final consumption increased to 75.7% in 2015, from \n68.8%  in  2014,  which  means  the  savings  rate  of  population \ndeclined and larger portions of personal income were allocated to \nrepayment of credits.  \nii.

The consolidated budget changed from surplus in \ndue to oil crisis.   2014 to deficit in 2016. The consolidated budget deficit is expected \nto be almost 10% of GDP in 2016 despite additional transfer from \nSOFAZ.  Reduced oil revenues resulted in budget expenditure cuts, \nespecially public investment with far reaching adverse impacts on \ngrowth.  \niii.

The cost \nborrowing.  of  sovereign  borrowing  from  international  capital  markets  have \nincreased following Azerbaijan\u2019s credit rating downgrade by major \nglobal rating agencies. As a result, perceived credit risks have \nincreased, limiting Azerbaijan\u2019s ability to raise funds in international \nmarkets at a low cost. On March 24th, 2016, Azerbaijan's Southern \nGas Corridor company issued $1 billion in a 10-year Eurobond, \nwhich  was  sold  80  basis  points  above  Azerbaijan\u2019s  sovereign \nbonds,  with  a  coupon  of  6.875%.

The  introduction  of  electronic  visa  that  is \ngranted in 3 working days at the cost of $20 and tax-free system \nhave already been found to be effective in attracting nearly 1 million \ntourists in the first half of 2016.

Additional investment by SOFAZ \npublic infrastructure.  on restructuring of the state-owned enterprises and on revenue \n  generating infrastructure projects is also expected to revive growth \nand  generate  employment.  Overall  Azerbaijan\u2019s  infrastructure \nspending in 2016 is around $2 billion, which includes financing of \nSouth  Gas  Corridor,  counterpart  share  of  externally  financed \nprojects and other critical investment projects. \n \nGovernment also established and enhanced a student credit fund \nto fund the payment of tuition fees for students from low-income \nfamilies  during  the  economic  downturn.  The  fund  acts  as  an \nintermediary  in  the  provision  of  concessional  loans  by  credit \norganizations and grants by various agencies and individuals. The \ngovernment has established a State Housing Agency approving its \norganizational structure, regulations and staffing. The agency is \ntasked to provide  affordable  social housing to low income and \nvulnerable groups. The government has allotted 11.6 hectares of \nland in the Yasamal district of Baku to build affordable apartments. \nThe number of beneficiaries is expected to be around 9,000. The \nproject is being administered by the State Housing Agency with an \nadministrative budget of 10 million manat and a staff of 60. The \nstate budget has allocated funds for development of accessible \ninfrastructure and inclusive education targeting the disabled people. \niii. The countercyclical  Despite  the  increasing  pressure  on  budget  revenues,  social \ndevelopment  protection areas have been increased in the revised budget. To \nexpenditure/policy program  enhance social protection of the population and counteract inflation \nhas a social safety net  the  following  one-off  measures  were  introduced:  (i)  wages  of \nscheme and employment  workers have been increased by 10% as of 1 March, 2016 in a \ngeneration targeting the  number of state budget sectors (social security, education, science, \npoor and vulnerable  culture, agriculture); ii) the basic amount of retirement benefits was \ngroups.  raised by 10% as of 1 February 2016 and now equals 110 manats. \n  It is estimated that about 140 million manats will be allocated for \n ", "  Appendix 4  23 \nCountercyclical Support  Asian Development Bank Assessment \nFacility Criteria and Indicators \nthis purpose; iii) the amount of social benefits, benefits for workers \nwho  lost  their  health,  food  allowance  for  refugees  have  been \nincreased  by  10%  as  of  1  February,  2016;  iv)  targeted  social \nassistance of $129 million has been provided with additional 20 \nmillion  manats  will  be  allocated  from  the  reserve  fund  of  the \nPresident to support social securityof low-income families.  \n \nApproximately  40,000  layoffs  since  the  onset  of  economic \nrecession created serious social problem in the short term. The \ngovernment responded immediately by creating 35,000 short-term \ncontractual jobs mostly in state owned enterprises and in local \ngovernments. Free trade zones and economic districts across the \nregions  are  being  established.  The  government  is  introducing \nreforms in labor market institutions and policies by modernizing \nvocational  education,  initiating  life-long  learning  and  prioritizing \nemployment of youth, women, disabled and internally displaced \npersons. It is expected that through these initiatives, and due to \nadditional  public  and  private  nvestment,  additional  jobs  will  be \ncreated. \n3.  Sound macroeconomic  Macroeconomic  management  until  the  oil  shock  largely  proved \nmanagement  effective in achieving growth and stability of the economy. Monetary \n  policy and exchange rate measures by the CBA proved effective in \nmanaging single-digit inflation and managing the fixed exchange \nrate regime. Moreover, there has been a state budget surplus till \n2014 with the country enjoying investment grade status.   \ni.  Monetary policy addresses  CBA has demonstrated high credibility in terms of addressing price \nprice stability as one of its  stability in the country. A number of actions were taken to prevent \ncore objectives. Inflation is  further loss of confidence in the local currency, while keeping in \ncontrolled.  view the scarcity of long-term funding and take control of a large-\n  scale  dollarization  process  in  the  banking  system.  Since  the \nDecember 2015 devaluation, the CBA moved to a managed floating \nexchange  rate  regime  and  instituted  the  exchange  rate  bands \nlimiting market interventions to preserve reserves. CBA also plans \nto move gradually to inflation targeting in the medium term. To \nreduce dollarization in the economy, the government raised the \ncoverage of local currency deposit insurance scheme to 100% with \ninterest rate of up to 12. Moreover, the annual interest income paid \non deposits of individuals was made tax-exempt for a period of 3 \nyears starting from February, 2016 to prevent outflow of deposits \nfrom the savings banks. \n \nSince the onset of the crisis, it was clear that financial sector will \nrequire structural reforms to make financial intermediation efficient. \nThe most significant reform has been the establishment of Financial \nMarkets Supervision Authority (FMSA) in 2016. FMSA was set up \nto improve the licensing, regulation and supervision of securities \nmarket and oversee the operations of other financial companies, as \nwell as to prevent money laundering activities. Since its inception, \nFMSA  has  already  taken  a  number  of  steps  in  regulating  the \nactivities in the financial sector through measures such as closure \nof insolvent banks and warning those engaged in risky practices.  \n \nFMSA is assessing all the banks and has agreed on a specific \nrestructuring plan with each bank with a clear roadmap and timeline \nto address capital adequacy and management issues. In July 2016, \n ", "24  Appendix 4 \nCountercyclical Support  Asian Development Bank Assessment \nFacility Criteria and Indicators \na Financial Stability Board was established chaired by the Prime \nMinister with representation of CBA, MOF and FMSA. The Board is \nto monitor the current situation in the financial-credit sector and \nrecommend actions based on international experience to address \nthe existing challenges. \nii.  In Azerbaijan, public  The  government\u2019s  fiscal  policy  is  to  stabilize  the  budget  and \nfinances are sound, and  manage drawdowns from the SOFAZ by (i) developing a consistent \nseveral fiscal adjustments  medium-term  macro-fiscal  framework;  (ii)  increasing  the \nand reforms have been  sustainability of the non-oil deficit over the medium-term; and (iii) \nplanned.  reducing the non-oil deficit, which is currently 40-45% of GDP\u2013still \n  above  the  30-35%  sustainability  level  recommended  by  the \n  permanent income rule under a conservative scenario of oil and \ngas production. Major improvements have been made over the past \nyears  on  comprehensiveness  and  transparency  of  the  budget, \npredictability and control in budget execution as reported by the \nlatest  assessment  of  Public  Expenditure  and  Financial \nAccountability  (PEFA)  by  the  World  Bank.  Major  weaknesses \nremain in the area of external and internal audit, which have been \ntaken up in the  PFM Action  Plan subsequently developed and \napproved by MOF in 2015. \n \nThe  state  budget  has  been  in  surplus  till  2014.  Based  on \ngovernment\u2019s current macroeconomic and fiscal projections, the \npublic debt to the GDP ratio is expected to be 21% in 2016. With \nproposed structural reforms in the areas of fiscal management, the \nfiscal position of the Government is expected to remain sustainable \nin the medium to long-run. \n4.  Structural Reforms  Implementing critical structural reforms for the development of non-\noil export sector, improvement of the business climate and fiscal \nand  financial  governance  are  government\u2019s  top  priority. \nGovernment has also taken strong initiatives to mobilize additional \nnon-tax revenue by revising the wholesale and retail power tariffs in \nJuly 2016. The power tariffs have not been revised since 2007. \nWater supply tariffs have increased by 38% and power tariffs have \nbeen increased by 16% in 2016. \ni.  Azerbaijan is taking  To identify and implement critical structural reforms in in the above \ncredible steps to address  areas over next 2-3 years, a Presidential Advisor on Economic \nthe underlying structural  Reforms was appointed and a special interagency Working Group \nissues to counteract future  established to develop long-term strategic development plans for \neconomic crisis  the  national  economy  and  its  different  sectors  for  achieving \nsustainability  of  economic  growth.  The  recession  exposed  the \nlimitations of country\u2019s economic development model that is based \non hydrocarbon exports of over 90%.  \n \nStrengthening  macroeconomic  and  fiscal  management  is  a \ngovernment priority both at the central level and in managing state-\nowned enterprises (SOE).  Overall,  public financial  management \n(PFM) systems are effective but the recession pointed to important \ngaps  that  need  to  be  addressed.  These  include:  (i)  building \ncapability  for  medium  term  expenditure  and  macroeconomic \nforecasting, (ii) aligning sector strategies with long-term national \ndevelopment  strategy,  (iii)  integration  of  financial  management \nsystems and better analysis of planned and actual budget data \nthrough introduction of program budgeting, (iv) strengthening public \ninvestments  by  improving  feasibility  and  project  management \n ", "  Appendix 4  25 \nCountercyclical Support  Asian Development Bank Assessment \nFacility Criteria and Indicators \ncapacities,  and  (v)  developing  a  medium  term  public  debt \nmanagement strategy.  \n \nThere are currently 10,540 SOEs, many of which are incurring \nlosses and receiving budget subsidies. As part of the planned SOE \nreforms, the president of Azerbaijan issued a decree in September \n2016 to facilitate entrepreneurship and competition in SOEs by \nencouraging participation of foreign and local investors. The decree \nsets a time bound  plan  to (i) formulate rules for  evaluation  of \nperformance efficiency of SOEs, (ii) develop corporate governance \nprinciples and apply international practices in the management of \nenterprises;  and  (iii)  introduce  international  financial  reporting \nsystems  and  necessary  structural  reforms  to  increase  financial \ntransparency and efficiency of large SOEs. The government has \nstarted listing  non-strategic SOEs for  privatization in 2016; this \nprocess will continue over the coming years.  \n \nIn  the  wake  of  oil  shock,  transformation  to  an  export-oriented \neconomy  characterized  by  robust  non-oil  sector  growth  and \nexpanding its export potential is a major priority of the government. \nA presidential decree signed in March 2016 implemented measures \nto stimulate the export of non-oil products.  These include opening \nnew e-government service centers, improving public construction \ntenders;  simplifying  customs  clearance;  increasing  electronic \npayments; creating regional industrial zones; extending agriculture, \ntourism  and  environmental  reforms  and  promoting  regional \neconomic  integration.  The  government  intends  to  enact  a  new \npension legislation in 2017 that would increase the retirement age \nand  contribution  periods;  this  is  expected  to  cut  pension  fund \ndeficits. To stimulate the development of SMEs in the country, \nentrepreneurship  law  was  amended  in  March  2016.  The \ngovernment is also pursuing efforts to diversify the economy by \nimproving  the  business  climate  and  by  expanding  the  financial \nsector. Azerbaijan\u2019s financial system is small and a costly source of \nfinance  remaining  vulnerable  to  external  systemic  risks.  The \nbinding constraints being addressed by the government include \nunderdeveloped financial markets, nascent government securities \nmarket, limited access to finance especially for small businesses \nand lack of financial inclusion. \nii.  Azerbaijan is engaging  ADB and the government agreed that transforming Azerbaijan into \nwith ADB to prepare a  a  dynamic  and  diversified  economy  will  require  improving \npolicy based program to  governance in a comprehensive manner, strengthening ease of \nenhance the effectiveness  doing business, and enhancing competition in the economy. As \nof these reforms.   highlighted in the development policy letter, the government has, \ntherefore, sought ADB\u2019s assistance to support structural reforms in \nareas related to the three broad directions. Government is in initial \ndiscussions with ADB to develop a policy based program. The \nobjective of the proposed Public Sector Efficiency and Management \nprogram is to strengthen fiscal and financial management, improve \npublic sector performance and facilitate development of the private \nsector.  For  this  purpose  a  technical  assistance  grant  is  being \nprovided to help prepare the program and to build capacities in the \nrelevant government agencies. The program will have three policy \nareas as described below. \n \n ", "26  Appendix 4 \nCountercyclical Support  Asian Development Bank Assessment \nFacility Criteria and Indicators \nPolicy  Area  1  will  help  strengthen  macroeconomic  and  fiscal \nmanagement.  The  policy  actions  may  include:  (i)  design  and \nintegration of rolling multi-year medium term fiscal framework and \nmedium-term expenditure framework in budget making, (ii) amend \nthe Law on State Debt and secondary regulations to consolidate \nlegal framework on government debt management, (iii) design and \nadopt a medium term debt management strategy covering loan \nportfolio, goals and principles of incurring new debt, issues of debt \nsustainability and development of domestic government securities \nmarket,  (iv)  improve  the  analytical  function  of  the  public  debt \nmanagement office with an upgraded debt management and risk \nanalysis system integrated with budget and treasury systems, (v) \nstrengthen internal audit in the Line Ministries and in MOF through \nadoption of risk-based internal audit, and (vi) design and enact \ncomprehensive amendments to Budget System Law and secondary \nlegislation related to medium term fiscal framework, fiscal rules and \nprogram based budgeting.  \n \nPolicy  Area  2  will  improve  public  sector  efficiency  and \naccountability.  The  policy  actions  may  include:  (i)  design  and \ndevelop  Public  Investment  framework  to  introduce  formal  and \nobjective  appraisal  of  the  state  investment  programs  based  on \nproject management cycle, (ii) ascertain the fiscal position, audited \nfinancial position and extent of contingent liabilities of SOEs, (iii) on \nthe basis of the fiscal position of select SOEs, put in place a \nfinancial  restructuring  and  debt  restructuring  plan  for  financial \nviability in select SOEs, (iv) develop corporate governance rules for \nbetter  management  of  the  SOEs,  and  (v)  introduce \ncommercialization and private partnership in delivery of services in \nselect SOEs. \n \nPolicy Area 3 will deepen the financial sector and expand private \nsector participation. The policy actions may include: (i) adopt the \nLaw on Full Deposit Insurance to generate more confidence in the \nbanking system, (ii) implement the new Law on Capital Markets and \nrelevant bye laws to increase access to finance for businesses, (iii) \ndevelop  and  expand  the  liquid  interbank  money  market,  (iv) \ndevelop and expand the liquid government securities market, (v) \nincrease  employment  opportunities  in  the  regions  thru  financial \ninclusion and SME financing and skills building, (vi) establishment \nof a single financial industry mega regulatory authority in order to \nstrengthen  financial  sector  regulation,  stability  and  coordination \nmechanism, (vii) implement steps to strengthen \u201cEase of Doing \nBusiness\u201d including Single-Window Clearance for SMEs, and (viii) \nadopt the Law on Funded Part of Labor Pensions and Law on \nPrivate Pension Funds required for the establishment of the funded \ncomponent of the pension system and for the development of non-\nstate pension institutions. \n5.  Debt Sustainability  The projected public debt to GDP ratio indicates that debt level is \n  sustainable including the potential impact of the prospective CSF \nborrowing,  as  the  ADB  loan  comprises  a  small  portion  of \nAzerbaijan\u2019s overall financing needs. \ni.  Relevant indicators are  An oil price scenario in line with the Asian Development Outlook \nbased on the DSA done by  2016 and the IMF\u2019s April 2016 World Economic Outlook would see \nEconomics Research  Azerbaijan\u2019s public debt-to-GDP ratio rise from 28.3% in 2015 to \n ", "  Appendix 4  27 \nCountercyclical Support  Asian Development Bank Assessment \nFacility Criteria and Indicators \nDepartment of ADB in line  38.2%  in 2016 and stabilize thereafter.   According to IMF, the \nwith the International  public debt is manageable as the public debt ratio will not breach \nMonetary Fund methods  the 50% threshold that requires \u201chigher scrutiny\u201d, in line with IMF \nand MOF data.  DSA practice. It should be noted that the 50% threshold for market-\naccess countries in the IMF DSA framework serves as an indicative \nmark against which a country is deemed requiring closer scrutiny, \nin order to more broadly assess the specific factors bearing on that \ncountry\u2019s sustainability. For example, one such factor would be the \nsize and composition of Azerbaijan\u2019s state oil fund. \n \nThis scenario reflects improved primary deficits, higher economic \ngrowth, as well as a projected rise in asset management revenues. \nAs a result, the public debt ratio would increase, yet remain well \nwithin the 50% threshold throughout the projection horizon. Under \nthe conservative scenario oil prices to drop by nearly half from last \nyear\u2019s level, to then increase gradually but not beyond US$40 by \n2021. Combined with macroeconomic and fiscal assumptions of the \ngovernment,  and  assuming  debt  financing,  such  an  oil  price \nscenario could potentially translate into increases in both the public \ndebt ratio and the external debt ratio. For example, public debt to \nGDP ratio is expected to be at 67% in 2020 as against 43% under \nmore realistic oil price assumptions. In this scenario, authorities \nmake  no  additional  SOFAZ  transfers  on  top  of  the  \u201cnormal\u201d \ntransfers  to  the  budget\u2014assumed  40%  of  total  government \nrevenues\u2014and  meet  any  fiscal  shortfalls  instead  by  new \ndebt/borrowing in the local or international markets. The 40% share \nis based on the average historical share of SOFAZ transfers to total \ngovernment  revenues  between  2010  and  2015.  However,  ADB \nanalysis suggests that additional SOFAZ transfers could be used \njudiciously  to  stabilize  the  debt  below  50%  of  GDP  under  the \nconservative oil price scenario.  \nii.  International reserves are  The foreign currency reserves of CBA are $4.1 billion. The assets \ndetermined to be  of the SOFAZ are $35.8 billion. In terms of the import coverage \nadequate, taking into  ratio, the strategic currency reserves of Azerbaijan are sufficient to \naccount the imports  cover the 25-month imports of goods and services. \ncoverage ratio and the   \nshort-term external debt \nfinancing requirement.  \n6.  Coordination with IMF  ADB  has  been  coordinating  with  IMF  and  other  development \npartners including World Bank for (1) designing the countercyclical \nfacility; and (2) identifying critical reforms that will help the country \nto diversify economic activities. \ni.  Azerbaijan had  Article IV mission concluded in June 2016 underscored a series of \nconstructive consultations  negative shocks to the Azerbaijan\u2019s economy especially the fall in \nwith IMF on Article IV  oil  prices,  and  slowdown  and  currency  depreciations  in  trading \nmission concluded in June  partners\u2019 economies. As a result, economic growth fell to 1.1% in \n2016.  2015 and is projected to turn negative (-2.4%) in 2016. IMF is \nsupportive  of  government\u2019s  response  to  the  weak  external \nenvironment. These include moving to a managed float exchange \nrate regime, raising interest rates in 2016 to address rising inflation, \nand implementing a countercyclical fiscal stimulus which focuses \non raising wages, old-age pensions and targeted social assistance, \nas well as completing existing investment projects. Government \nhas  agreed  with  IMF  on  the  appropriateness  of  countercyclical \nspending but to embark on consolidation from 2017. \n ", "28  Appendix 4 \nCountercyclical Support  Asian Development Bank Assessment \nFacility Criteria and Indicators \n \nIMF also strongly endorses government\u2019s planned move to a new \neconomic model focused on private sector led growth driven by the \nnon-oil  economy.  The  structural  reform  agenda  needs  to  be \nimplemented,  with  governance  strengthened,  the  cost  of  doing \nbusiness  reduced  and  competition  enhanced.  Government  has \nagreed with the IMF on instituting a rule-based fiscal framework \nand  strong  institutional  arrangements  to  preserve  fiscal \nsustainability in the medium term. IMF underscored that a rule-\nbased  framework  supplemented  by  a  strong  public  financial \nmanagement system, detailed multi-annual budgets and a public \ndebt strategy will strengthen fiscal discipline. In addition, expanding \ndebt securities market will help in deepening the country\u2019s financial \nsector.   \n \nIMF  is  providing  technical  and  advisory  assistance  to  the \ngovernment  in  improving  public  expenditure  and  financial \naccountability,  enforcing  fiscal  rules,  and  strengthening  banking \nsupervision. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CBA = Central Bank of Azerbaijan, DSA = debt sustainability analysis, GDP = gross \ndomestic product, IMF= International Monetary Fund, MOF= Ministry of Finance, PFM= public financial management, \nSME = small and medium-sized enterprises, SOE = state-owned enterprise, SOFAZ = State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan.  \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"Producer": "GPL Ghostscript 9.14", "CreationDate": "D:20161116144354+08'00'", "ModDate": "D:20161116144354+08'00'", "Author": "ADB", "Creator": "PDF24 Creator", "Title": "Report and Recommendation of the President", "Keywords": "adb rrp report recommendation president"}, "author_page": "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 November 2016) \n \nCurrency unit  \u2013  Azerbaijan manat/s (AZN) \nAZN1.00  =  $0.5743 \n$1.00  =  AZN1.7414 \n \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  CBA  \u2013  Central Bank of Azerbaijan \n  CSF  \u2013  countercyclical support facility \n  EITI  \u2013  Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative \n  FMSA  \u2013  Financial Markets Supervision Authority \n  GDP  \u2013  gross domestic product \n  IMF  \u2013  International Monetary Fund \n  LIBOR  \u2013  London interbank offered rate \n  MOF  \u2013  Ministry of Finance \n  SMEs  \u2013  small and medium-sized enterprises \n  SOE  \u2013  state-owned enterprise \n  SOFAZ  \u2013  State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan \n  TA  \u2013  technical assistance \n  TASF  \u2013  Technical Assistance Special Fund \n \n \nNOTE \n \nIn this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars. \n \n \nVice-President  W.
