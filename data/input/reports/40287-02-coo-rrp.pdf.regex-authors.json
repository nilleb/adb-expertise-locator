THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nsupplementary loan; and (ii) the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the \nClimate Change Fund;1 both to the Cook Islands for the Avatiu Port Development Project.2 \n \n2.  Avatiu port, located on the island of Rarotonga, is the principal international port for the \nCook Islands, as well as the transshipment port for cargo to the second most populated island \nof Aitutaki and the less populated outer islands. Two loans, one from the ordinary capital \nresources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the other from the Asian Development \nFund (ADF) were approved on 20 November 2008 for the Avatiu Port Development Project.3 \nThe project will rehabilitate and expand the capacity of the port. The project comprises (i) \nwidening the harbor entrance, (ii) dredging to increase the depth alongside the wharf plus \ndredging and enlarging the ship turning area, and (iii) reconstructing and realigning the quay \nand repairing the adjacent wharf deck.4  The cost of the civil works has increased as a result of \ncurrency realignment and an underestimation of input prices. A supplementary loan is therefore \nrequired to meet the increased cost of the project. \n \nII.  THE APPROVED PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The country is heavily reliant on international imports by sea to support its tourism \nindustry\u2014the mainstay of the country\u2019s economy\u2014as well as for general imports and exports. \nThe continued efficient operation of the port, its security against periodic cyclone events, and its \ndevelopment to accommodate changes in regional shipping methods are therefore critical to the \nCook Islands\u2019 economy and the social well-being of its population. \n \n4.  The wharf is weak, aging, and vulnerable to damage from storms and impact from \nvessels. The port is at the margin of safe operations for international cargo vessels currently \nserving the Cook Islands. Meanwhile, longer, deeper-draft, and more efficient cargo vessels are \nplanned for the Pacific islands\u2019 trade in the next few years, with the existing vessels being \nremoved from service. The larger ships cannot be handled through Avatiu Port at present, \nbecause of the limited depth alongside the wharf and in the harbor, berthing length limitations, \nand an inadequate turning area within the harbor. The length limitation also prevents larger \ncruise vessels from berthing at Avatiu Port, thus limiting the economic benefit to be gained from \nthis part of the tourism market. Without the project, there will be escalating costs for periodic \nrepair of the wharf and the port\u2019s use will need to be restricted to smaller vessels. Costs will be \nhigher, and there will be adverse economic impacts.  \n \n5.  The harbor cannot handle ships longer than about 90 meters (m), and the berth is limited \nto a 6 m draft. That effectively excludes cargo vessels above 4,000 tons and most cruise ships, \nwhich have to transfer passengers by the ship\u2019s boats. The port has suffered periodic damage \n                                                \n1   Administered by ADB. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  ADB. 2008.

Manila (R254-08, Loans 2472-COO and 2473-COO[SF], accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n4  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance (TA). ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to the Cook Islands \nfor Preparing the Infrastructure Development Project. Manila (TA 7022-COO, approved on 12 December 2007, for \n$700,000). ", "2 \nfrom cyclones and emergency procedures are in place to minimize losses when cyclones occur. \nThe existing wharf was constructed in 1989. It is in a state of advanced deterioration because of \ndeficiencies in the design and poor construction. The quay face and parts of the wharf deck are \nvulnerable to sudden failure, which could be triggered by a storm or vessel impact. Such failures \nwill involve unplanned and increasingly expensive emergency repairs as the wharf continues to \ndeteriorate.  Full  reconstruction  of  the  quay  is  urgently  needed,  along  with  deepening  and \nwidening of the harbor to accommodate the next generation of cargo vessels and larger cruise \nships. Once the project is completed, at least 70% of all cruise ships that currently call will be \nable to berth at the wharf. \n \n6.  In 2007, the government adopted a 20-year Preventive Infrastructure Master Plan that \nwas prepared under a technical assistance (TA) from ADB5 as an integral part of the National \nSustainable Development Plan 2007\u20132010 (NSDP).6 The plan assessed the condition and \nmanagement  of  existing  infrastructure,  concluding  that  lack  of  investment  in  maintenance, \nrehabilitation, and upgrading has resulted in aging systems that do not provide appropriate \nlevels of service for current demand and that this places sustained economic development at \nrisk.  Following  the  Plan,  ADB  funded  project  preparatory  TA  for  the  preparation  of  an \ninfrastructure  development  project  with  detailed  feasibility  studies  for  a  number  of  priority \ninfrastructure investments including Avatiu port development.7 \n \n7.  The  development  of  Avatiu  port  was  accorded  high  priority  because  of  the  risk  of \ncatastrophic failure. By safeguarding the continued efficient operations and expansion of the \nport, the project will ensure that facilities required for private sector-led economic growth are \nstrengthened and risks to operational efficiency are removed. \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  2008\u20132012  recognizes  that  maintaining \nmacroeconomic  stability  depends  on  removing  the  binding  constraints  to  environmentally \nsustainable  private  sector-led  economic  growth  and  improving  the  quality  of  public  sector \ngovernance.8 The strategic focus of the partnership strategy is derived from the NSDP and \naddresses these constraints through improved economic and social infrastructure and public \nsector service delivery. This directly supports implementation of the NSDP. \n \nB.  Objectives and Scope \n9.  The impact of the project will be continued economic growth and well-being of the \npopulation. The outcome of the project will be a secure and efficient port infrastructure in \nRarotonga with constraints and safety risks removed. The project will enhance safety and bring \nship berthing and maneuvering within the harbor more closely into line with accepted maritime \nindustry practice.  \n \n10.  The physical outputs of the project are: (i) harbor dredged to 8 m below chart datum \n(from the current depth of about 6 m), (ii) widened harbor entrance (by approximately 10 m), (iii) \ndemolition of the outer and inner berths and replacement of them by a continuous quay (total \nstraight wharf face of 270 m), (iv) new sheet piling along the new quay wall, (v) rehabilitation of \nthe wharf deck back to 20 m from the wharf face, (vi) demolition of the old slip and patrol boat \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2006.

Interest during construction has been computed at the \n5-year forward London interbank offered rate plus a spread of 0.2% for the ordinary capital \nresources loan and at 1% for the Asian Development Fund loan. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n12.   ADB has provided a blend of two loans totaling $15.5 million equivalent, comprising an \nordinary capital resources (OCR) loan of $8.6 million and an ADF loan of SDR4.524 million \n($6.9 million equivalent) (collectively, the original loans).9 The ADF loan has a maturity of 32 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years. The OCR loan has a term of 25 years with a grace \nperiod  of  5  years. The  original  loans  were  approved  on  20  November  2008  and  became \neffective on 10 September 2009. A subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and the \nCook Islands Ports Authority (CIPA) provides for the loan proceeds to be onlent to CIPA on the \nsame financial terms and conditions, as those of the original loans. \n \n13.  ADB agreed to finance 85.2% of the total project cost, including taxes and duties, with \nthe government funding the balance (14.8%).10 The original cost estimates are summarized by \nfinancing source in Table 2. \n \n                                                \n9  SDR4.524 million is approximately $7.07 million at 28 January 2011. \n10 The country cost-sharing ceiling is up to 99% for lending and nonlending products.

Status of Project Implementation \n14.   As a result of delays in selecting and appointing a firm of consultants for design and \nconstruction supervision, the project is currently 7 months behind schedule. The delays were \ndue to CIPA\u2019s inexperience with ADB\u2019s processes. However, CIPA, the executing agency, has \nestablished the project office and the project management team in accordance with the original \nimplementation  plan.  Consultants  were  appointed  in  January  2010  and  detailed  design, \ntendering, and award of contract for the civil works were accomplished without further delay by \nDecember 2010.11 No further procurement actions are required. The successful bidder has \nprovided an accelerated construction program, which will, if achieved, result in completion of the \ncivil works by February 2012. The contractual completion date including the contractors\u2019 float12 \nis July 2012. Completion of construction was originally expected by April 2012, and therefore \nthere  is  currently  a  reasonable  expectation  that  the  original  completion  date  will  be  met. \nImplementation progress is therefore satisfactory. \n \n15.  The original report and recommendation of the President (the original RRP) stated that \nthe project will climate-proof the wharf by replacing the existing structure that is extremely \nvulnerable to wave action and associated forces with one that is fully resistant to such forces. \nAdditionally, the wharf will be designed so that it can be raised along with the container yard at \nsome future date, if required by a rise in sea level. Similarly, the design of the anchorage points \nfor the fendering system will allow the fenders to be set at a higher level if required. The detailed \ndesign of the works has incorporated these features and has identified the cost of doing so. A \ngrant of $0.8 million (to be administered by ADB) was provided from the Climate Change Fund \n(CCF) to meet the additional costs.13  \n \n16.  CIPA has fully complied with safeguard-related assurances. However, the government \nhas not yet complied with an assurance that it will pay the cost of the community services \nprovided by CIPA. Progress in this regard was delayed in 2010 because of political instability \nthat significantly hampered government decision making processes. Elections took place in \nNovember 2010 and dialogue will be renewed with the incoming government during 2011. A \nnew deadline of 30 November 2011 for the satisfaction of these assurances has been approved \nby ADB on 4 February 2011 through a minor change in project scope. \n \n                                                \n11 ADB advised CIPA of its \u201cno objection\u201d to the proposed contract, which was awarded on 14 December 2010. \n12 \u201cFloat\u201d is the time that a contractor allows in the construction schedule for unforeseen delays. The total time, \ninclusive of \u201cfloat\u201d is the contractual time for completion. \n13 Approved by the Climate Change Steering Committee on 17 February 2011. \n ", "5 \nIII.  THE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Cost Overrun \n17.   The physical scope of the project is unchanged from that identified in the original RRP. \nThe  cost  overrun  has  resulted  from  a  combination  of  currency  movement  and  an \nunderestimation of the cost of the civil works. The financing plan in the original RRP allowed \nNZ$24.2 million for civil works (at mid-2008 prices, inclusive of 27.5% contingencies). However, \nthe accepted bid price is NZ$27.2 million, which is 12.4% more than the appraisal estimate in \nNew Zealand dollar terms. However, in US dollar terms, the civil works cost has increased \n27.8% from $16.2 million to $20.7 million. The cost estimates in the original RRP were based on \nan exchange rate of NZ$1.00 = $0.67 whereas the revised cost estimate is based on the \nprevailing rate of NZ$1.00 = $0.76. Fifty-five percent of the increase (or about $2.4 million) is \nattributable to exchange rate movements and 45% (or about $2.1 million) is attributable to \nunderestimation of the cost. The civil works contract attracted sufficient interest for the bidding \nprocess  to  be  considered  competitive.  Twenty-three  entities  requested  prequalification \nquestionnaires, and 7 firms were prequalified. Four firms submitted bids, 2 of which were below \nthe engineer\u2019s updated estimate. The reasons for the cost underestimation are volatility in the \ncost of construction materials, the relative isolation of the project site, and  volatile market \nconditions. These considerations made cost estimation difficult, with the contingency allowance \nproving insufficient.  \n \nB.  Impact on the Project \n18.  The project comprises a single civil works contract that must be completed in order to \nachieve the development objectives. The government is committed to implementing the project \nas soon as possible. It has demonstrated its commitment by authorizing CIPA to award the civil \nworks contract before the expiry of the bid validity period, while recognizing that additional \nfinance  will  be  required.  Potential  impacts  on  project  implementation  have  therefore  been \navoided. \n \nC.  Rationale \n19.  The  scope  of  works  for  the  project  is  a  least-cost  solution  to  meeting  the  future \noperational needs of Avatiu port. The scope cannot be reduced without significant loss of \nbenefits. The existing wharf is in poor condition and risks catastrophic failure. The overall \nrationale for upgrading the port therefore remains as described in the original RRP. \n \nD.  Revised Investment and Financing Plan \n20.  The revised total cost estimate of the project is estimated to be $24.64 million. The \nrevised project investment plan is in Table 3. \n \n \n \n   \n ", "6 \n \nTable 3: Revised Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n \nItem    Amountsa \nA.  Base Costb    \n  1.

The  government  has  requested  a  supplementary  loan  of  $4.70  million  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources to help finance the project. The supplementary loan will have a 25-\nyear term, including a grace period of 5 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge \nof 0.15% per year (the interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in the \nloan), and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement for the \nsupplementary loan (the Supplementary loan agreement). The supplementary loan will finance \nthe additional cost of the civil works, inclusive of taxes and duties, that is not covered by the \noriginal loans or grants. Consideration has been given to the amount of taxes and duties, and \nthese do not constitute an excessive share of project costs.14 The government has provided \nADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility \nbased on these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own \nindependent decision and not made on the basis of on any communication or advice from ADB. \nTo finance the climate change adaptation measures, the CCF has provided the CCF grant of \n$0.80 million towards the cost of civil works (exclusive of taxes and duties). \n \n22.  The government will onlend the proceeds of the supplementary loan to CIPA through a \nsubsidiary loan agreement on terms and conditions acceptable to ADB. The subsidiary loan \nagreement shall be executed on the same financial and other terms and conditions as required \nin the supplementary loan agreement. The government will bear the foreign exchange and \ninterest rate variation risk of the loan. Similarly, the government will provide the proceeds of the \nCCF Grant to CIPA through a subsidiary grant agreement on terms and conditions acceptable \nto ADB. \n                                                \n14 The amount of taxes and duties to be financed (i) is within the thresholds identified in the Cook Islands country \npartnership strategy 2008\u20132012, (ii) does not represent an excessive share of the project investment plan, and (iii) \nis material and relevant to the success of the project. \n ", "7 \n \n23.

Technical aspects of the project remain unchanged since appraisal for the original loans. \nDetailed designs have been completed and a construction contract has been awarded. The \nproject remains technically feasible. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n27.  The project economic benefits remain as assessed in Appendix 9 of the original RRP. \nHowever, because of the increased construction cost, the economic internal rate of return is \nnow estimated to be 13.9% (15.9% at the appraisal for the original loans). The net present value \nis  now  estimated  to  be  $2.12  million  ($5.49  million  at  appraisal).  In  terms  of  financial \nsustainability, the financial internal rate of return is reduced from 6% to 4.2%. However, the \nweighted average cost of capital is 0.58% because interest rates are lower than at appraisal and \nbecause of the grant financing element from the CCF. The project remains economically viable \nand financially sound. \n \nC.  Governance \n28.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and CIPA. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the project administration manual (footnote 17). \n \nD.  Safeguards \n29.  The project is  category B, B, and C for environment, resettlement, and indigenous \npeoples, respectively.  As the supplementary loan does not involve a change in scope, the \ncategorizations  are  unchanged  from  those  determined  for  the  original  loans.  An  initial \nenvironmental examination (including an environmental management plan) has been prepared \nfor the project and is available as a supplementary appendix to the original RRP. The current \ndesign  and  implementation  of  the  project  meets  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009) \nrequirements for the CCF-funded activities, and the range of any additional potential impact that \n ", "9 \ncould occur due to the CCF-funded activities can be adequately addressed by the project\u2019s \nexisting environment management plan. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n30.  Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the original RRP. Financial \nrisks were identified as the management effectiveness and financial control exercised by CIPA \nover its port operating costs, as well as in setting levels of port charges to adequately recover \nthese  costs  and  to  meet  CIPA\u2019s  debt  service  and government  dividend  obligations.  Since \nappraisal for the original loans, CIPA has increased its operating revenues (for both FY2009 \nand  FY2010)  through  efficiency  improvements  and  a  10%  increase  in  port  charges, \nnotwithstanding a downturn in shipping volumes. The downturn was due to (i) global economic \nconditions during FY2008 through FY2010, and (ii) the loss of scheduled visits by Forum \nShipping Line. In the latter case, Pacific Direct Line resumed the Forum schedule in April 2010. \nGDP is expected to grow by 2.9% in FY2011, 9.1% in FY2012, and 7.4% in FY2013, reflecting \ngrowth in real GDP and inflation. Significant growth is forecast to result from the adoption of \naggressive marketing for tourism, including the expansion of air services, though underlying \ngrowth will be dependent on the rate of growth of the global economy (footnote 15). Rapid \nexpansion of tourism is expected to result in significantly increased demand for cargo services. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n31.  The government and CIPA have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement, as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n32.  The government and CIPA have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \nwhich  are  set  forth  in  the  supplementary  loan  agreement,  the  grant  agreement,  and  the \namended project agreement. \n \n33.  In addition to the standard conditions for effectiveness, the following conditions apply (i) \nthe subsidiary loan agreement for the supplementary loan, satisfactory to ADB, shall have been \nduly executed and delivered on behalf of the government and CIPA and shall have become \nlegally binding upon the government and CIPA; and (ii) the subsidiary grant agreement for the \nCCF grant, satisfactory to ADB, shall have been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the \ngovernment and CIPA and shall have become legally binding upon the government and CIPA.  \n \n34.  No withdrawals shall be made under the supplementary loan until the loan proceeds \nallocated for works under the original loans have been fully disbursed. \n \n35.  No disbursements shall be made from the CCF grant until the project\u2019s supervising \nengineer has certified that the project described in schedule 1 to the grant agreement has been \nconstructed to his satisfaction and has certified payment to the contractor. \n   \n ", "10 \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n36.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n \n(i)  the loan of $4,700,000 to the Cook Islands for the Avatiu Port Development \nProject from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility; for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft  supplementary  loan  and  amended  project  agreement  presented  to  the \nBoard; and \n \n(ii)  the administration by ADB of a grant not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 to \nthe Cook Islands for the Avatiu Port Development Project, to be provided by the \nClimate Change Fund. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n2 March 2011\n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \nImpact    Assumptions \nGovernment statistics \nContinued economic  Sustained average annual  Stable global \ngrowth and well-being of  GDP growth of more than  Project performance  macroeconomic \nthe population  2.5%  evaluation report   conditions \n \nInternational freight rates  Growth in cargo \nPublic reports of \nfor cargoes delivered at  volumes sustained \ncommerce \nAvatiu do not increase by \n  Financial and \nmore than 10% of their \nSchedule of port tariffs  operational \nreal value as of July 2008 \n  management of CIPA \nby 2016, apart from fuel \nPublished freight charges  improved \ncost-related increases. \n \nCargo delivery cost \nLower socioeconomic  CIPA annual reports \nsavings are passed \ngroups do not face \nHousehold income and  through to consumers. \ndisproportionate increases \nexpenditure survey   \nin the price of imported \ngoods (base data from  Risks \n2008 household income  Fuel costs rise \nand expenditure survey).  substantially in real \nterms. \n     \nCompetition in cargo \n   \nand fuel delivery to the \nCook Islands \ndecreases \nOutcome   \nAssumptions \nSecure and efficient port  Project performance \nCompliance with  Port bylaws formally \ninfrastructure in  evaluation report \ninternational maritime  adopted to permit CIPA \nRarotonga   \nstructures standards  control and use of port \nADB project review \nBS6349 and AS4997 by  land \nreports \nDecember 2011 \n  Fees for rental property \nAverage annual marine  Project performance  transferred from CIIC \naccidents in the harbor  statistics  to CIPA \nenvirons reduced from 2   \nPort services operating \n(2002\u20132007) to 0 by April  Ship agent\u2019s reports on \nin accordance with \n2012  cargo handling \nstandards established \n \nCapacity to accommodate  by sector policy \nHarbormaster\u2019s statistics \nvessels up to 6,000  documents and asset \nfor traffic and cargo \ndeadweight tons deployed  management plans by \nvolumes \nby the modern shipping  June 2012 \n \nindustry by April 2012 \nHarbormaster\u2019s incident  Government \nNumber of cruise ships  reports   compensates CIPA for \nberthing alongside    the cost of community \nincreased from 2 (2007) to  Schedule of port tariffs  service obligations \n25 per year by end 2012   \nPublic reports of the Cook  Risk \nNumber of larger (>100- Islands Audit Office on the  Inadequate \nmeter length overall)  operational efficiency of  government support for \nvessels calling at least 12  CIPA and pricing of port  plans to implement \nper year by end 2012  services  improved oversight of \nReduced cost of port    the sector by CIIC and \nservices in real terms  Public sector financial and  the public auditor  \n(baseline schedule of port  management performance \ntariffs for FY2009)  reports \nAn operating profit of not \nless than 2% to be earned \n ", "12  Appendix 1 \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \nby CIPA on average net \nrevalued fixed assets in \nservice at Avatiu port \nOutputs  Assumption \nCompletion of quay and  Award of contracts \n1.
