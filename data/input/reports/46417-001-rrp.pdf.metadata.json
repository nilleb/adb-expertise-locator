I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto India for the Jaipur Metro Rail Line 1-Phase B Project.1 \n \n2.  The project is to build Line 1-Phase B of the metro rail network in the city of Jaipur, India, \nconsisting of underground rail infrastructure of 2.3 kilometers (km) and two stations. It will \nextend Line 1-Phase A, which is being undertaken by the government of Rajasthan, and is \ncritical to ensuring that the combined overall impact is optimized and benefits are reaped in a \ntimely manner. The project also includes support to study and update a future development plan \nfor Line 2. The metro rail network is expected to provide mass rapid transit capacity for the city\u2019s \nmajor mobility corridors, aiming to reverse the rising shift to private cars and achieve a vision of \nan improved public transport system in Jaipur\u2014optimizing general mobility, enhancing quality of \nlife, and making the city more pleasant to live and work in. The outcome of the project supports \nthe  country\u2019s  National  Urban  Transport  Policy  and  the  strategic  objectives  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in the transport sector, which aim to increase movement of people \nand goods in a more efficient, safe, and sustainable manner. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Jaipur, the capital of the Indian state of Rajasthan, is the 10th largest city and one of the \nfastest growing cities in India. It is a center of both traditional and modern industries, and is a \nvery popular tourist destination for cultural heritage and historic architecture. The population of \nJaipur city was 3.1 million in 2011, and it is projected to reach 8.1 million by 2031.2 The fast-\npaced industrial and commercial development has resulted in a steep rise in travel demand, but \nthe city\u2019s existing public transport infrastructure is inadequate in terms of capacity and service. \nWith the growing economy, passengers are shifting to private modes of transport, as evident in \nthe rise in vehicle ownership, aggravating congestion and pollution. The modal share for public \ntransport was 19% in 2009\u2014one of the lowest in cities with more than 3 million inhabitants in \nIndia.3 \n   \n4.  In  2009,  Jaipur  Development  Authority  developed  a  comprehensive  mobility  plan, \nseeking to provide an overall transport plan, up to 2031, that emphasizes the preeminence of \npublic transport for the movement of people, not just vehicles, and integrating land use with \ntransport networks.4 It prioritized mobility corridors, which can be utilized to optimize movement \nof people, focusing on mass transport, rather than vehicular traffic; and identified solutions \nincluding  bus  fleet  augmentation,  bus  rapid  transit  system,  and  a  high-capacity  rail-based \nsystem (metro). The city bus fleet has been augmented with modern buses and the bus rapid \ntransit system is being introduced.5 However, the main road corridors cannot accommodate \nsegregated bus lanes, while the city\u2019s radial development pattern is generating high demand for \ntrips to and from the central business and commercial districts. To meet the increasing mobility \nrequirement and avoid further congestion, high capacity metro lines were recommended along \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The population, including the immediate surrounding area outside of the Jaipur Development Authority, was \n4.5 million in 2011, and is projected to reach 9.3 million by 2031. \n3  Other modes and their respective shares are non-motorized transport (32%), auto-rickshaw (6%), two-wheelers \n(27%), car or van (8%), and taxi (8%). \n4  Jaipur Development Authority. 2010. Comprehensive Mobility Plan for Jaipur. Jaipur. \n5  Under the Government of India\u2019s Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission. ", "2 \nthe city\u2019s two backbone arterial corridors. These consist of Line 1 for the east\u2013west corridor of \n12 km from Mansarovar to Badi Chopar, and Line 2 for the north\u2013south corridor of 23 km from \nAmbabadi to Sitapura. The metro lines are mainly elevated along the major arterial roads and \nunderground beneath the city\u2019s busy central zone. \n \n5.  In  January  2010,  the  government  of  Rajasthan  established  the  Jaipur  Metro  Rail \nCorporation (JMRC) as a special purpose vehicle to implement the metro rail lines. Line 1-\nPhase A (9.7 km elevated portion from Mansarovar to Chandpole), estimated to cost about \n$400 million and financed entirely by the government, is nearing completion and is expected to \nbegin commercial operation in late 2013. The proposed ADB loan is to help finance Line 1-\nPhase B, consisting of the 2.3 km underground portion from Chandpole to Badi Chopar, with \ntwo stations for completion and operation by early 2018. Line 2 for the north\u2013south corridor is \nbeing planned, and the proposed financing includes consulting services for JMRC to update the \ndetailed project report, which includes updating traffic demand, reviewing route selection, the \npreliminary engineering and cost estimate, and assessing economic and financial viability. It will \nhelp JMRC identify viable financing options and implementation arrangements to take the next \nsteps  toward  achieving  comprehensive  improvements  for the  mass  rapid  transit  system  in \nJaipur. \n \n6.  Line 1-Phase A and Phase B comprise a single and continuous urban railway system, \nand will integrate with feeder routes of the bus rapid transit system under construction. The \nproject location for Line 1-Phase B encompasses the core central business district, and is \nexpected to generate about 61% of total trips for the entire Line 1, although only about 19% in \ntotal length. Therefore, the completion and operation of Line 1-Phase B is critical to ensuring the \noverall impact is optimized and benefits are reaped in a timely manner. The average daily \nnumber of passengers on Line 1-Phase B is forecast to reach 126,000 during the first full year \nof operation in 2019. \n \n7.  The primary reason for locating Line 1-Phase B underground is to minimize physical \ncongestion in the busy central business district, and preserve its cultural heritage and historic \narchitecture. The estimated cost per km for Line 1-Phase B is comparable to the construction of \nsimilar underground metro systems in the country.6 Although capital-intensive, the cash flow \nprojection indicates the project would generate sufficient cash resources to meet its operation \nand maintenance cost and debt service obligation.7 \n \n8.  The project is consistent with the country\u2019s development goal of achieving faster, more \ninclusive and sustainable growth. It is well aligned with the National Urban Transport Policy to \naddress mobility challenges and improve the quality of life in the urban cities of India. The \nproject supports initiatives undertaken by the state government, and it is harmonized within the \nComprehensive Mobility Plan for Jaipur, ensuring integrated land use and coordinated urban \ntransport planning. It will help ADB achieve its strategic objective in the transport sector\u2014to \nincrease movement of people and goods in a more efficient, safe, and sustainable manner. The \nproposed ADB loan is included in the country operations business plan, 2013\u20132015. \n  \n                                                 \n6  The cost per km of underground civil works for Line 1-Phase B is about $43.1 million, comparable to about \n$40.6 million for Bangalore Metro Phase I and about $40.8 million for Delhi Metro Phase II (in 2010 prices).  \n7   Economic and Financial Analysis; Cash Flow Projection for Line 1-Phase B (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n ", "3 \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be improved public transport in Jaipur. The immediate outcome will be \nimproved mass rapid transit system in Jaipur.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n10.  The outputs will be (i) Line 1-Phase B, comprising the underground rail infrastructure of \n2.3 km and two stations; and (ii) Line 2 plans updated, including a detailed project report. \n \n11.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n17.  The technical viability is sound, with the use of proven technology. The engineering \ndesign and system selection are optimized for economy and efficiency in accordance with \napplicable international design standards. The construction method is reliable and conventional, \nusing a shield tunnel boring machine for the underground section and top\u2013down cut-and-cover \nmethod to construct stations.11 To ensure operational reliability and safety, the signal, train \ncontrol, and telecommunications will be identical to the tried and tested system under Line 1-\nPhase A, and will be integrated for standardization and technical compatibility. An accessibility \naudit will be conducted to check the status and suggest possible improvements for facility \naccess by people with disabilities, including underground station facilities and amenities, and \naccess areas for entry and exit.12 The climate risk screening indicated a low to medium risk to \nurban flash floods, and waterproofing measures are being adapted in the design, including \ndrainage pipes along the tunnel, with sump pumps located at low points; gaskets for segmental \nconcrete lining; seepage pumps for each station; and waterproofing of underground station \nstructures.13 \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n18.  Economic analysis was carried out by comparing the societal cost of transportation with \nand without the project, considering the benefits of Line 1-Phase B in terms of savings in vehicle \noperating costs derived from a reduction of traffic on the east\u2013west corridor from vehicles\u2019 \nreduced  and  improved  speed;  and  travel  time  savings  for  trips  using  the  metro  and  for \nremaining  vehicle  users  with  improved  speed.  Also  considered  are  savings  resulting  from \nreduced road accidents and reduced air pollution from reduced vehicle-km, which have been \nquantified and included in the analysis. The economic internal rate of return for Line 1-Phase B \nis estimated at 13.8%, indicating that the project is viable in social cost\u2013benefit terms. Under a \nsensitivity analysis, testing the effects of possible unfavorable scenarios resulting from changes \nin the key parameters that determine the project\u2019s costs and benefits, the economic viability \nremained satisfactory with an economic internal rate of return of 12% or above. A marginal \ndecrease to 11.4% is possible only when the cost increase and benefit reduction are considered \nsimultaneously.  Even  under  this  scenario,  considering  the  contribution  to  realizing  the  full \n                                                 \n11 Cut-and-cover is a simple method of construction for shallow tunnel where a trench is excavated with side support \nwalls and capping beams from ground level, and roofed with overhead support system. \n12  JMRC will incorporate possible improvements in the design of the underground stations and immediate access \nareas. Findings regarding the pedestrian sidewalks, footpath, and road crossing will be shared with the Jaipur \nDevelopment Authority as recommended improvements for future upgrading work in the area. \n13  Climate Change: Project Adaptation Action Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \npotential and combined benefit of metro Line 1 to help sustain the city\u2019s economic growth, the \nproject is recommended for implementation. \n \n19.  Financial  analysis  was  carried  out  to  assess  the  viability  of  the  proposed  project \ninvestment based on the incremental earnings and operational cost savings that would accrue \nto JMRC as a result of implementing Line 1-Phase B. The analysis was carried out on an \nincremental basis using the discounted cash flow method and calculating the internal rate of \nreturn of the project. The capital cost includes construction of the metro line and the associated \nfacilities, and the rolling stock cost. The operation and maintenance cost includes staff costs, \nexpenditure toward the upkeep and maintenance of the system, and energy costs. The revenue \nis generated from fare box collection, advertisements, and rentals at metro stations. All financial \nprojections are made in 2013 nominal Indian rupees with no adjustment for inflation. The \nestimated financial internal rate of return for the project in real terms is 3.7%, which is above the \nestimated weighted average capital cost of 1.65% for Line 1-Phase B. The cash flow projections \nindicate that the project would generate sufficient liquid cash resources to allow the project to \nmeet its operation and maintenance costs and debt service obligations. \n \nC.  Governance \n20.  Policy, legal, and institutional capacity. JMRC is a wholly owned company of the \ngovernment of Rajasthan, incorporated on 1 January 2010 under the Companies Act of 1956, \nand established to provide a mass rapid transit system in the city of Jaipur via a metro rail \nnetwork. JMRC is headed by a chairperson and managing director, with about 470 staff and a \nboard of directors of 14 members.14 The corporate organization has been developed on good \npractice principles, and a sound culture is emerging with an understanding of company values\u2014\naiming to provide high-class standards in regard to safety, reliability, punctuality, comfort, and \nuser satisfaction; and to operate on sound ethical standards. As JMRC has been in existence \nfor a relatively short time, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation has been providing professional support \nin project engineering and operation and management expertise.15 JMRC has recruited an \nadequate number of staff necessary for metro operation, and the critical training for start-up and \nmaintenance is being conducted at the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Training Institute in Delhi. \nTo implement the proposed project for Line 1-Phase B, JMRC at its own cost will retain Delhi \nMetro Rail Corporation as the project management consultant for engineering, procurement, \nand supervision. \n \n21.  Financial  management.  A  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted, \nconsidering the capacity of JMRC, including funds-flow arrangements, governance, staffing, \nbudgeting, accounting and financial reporting systems, internal control procedures, financial \ninformation systems, and internal and external auditing arrangements. JMRC has an accounting \nsystem that allows for the proper recording of project financial transactions, following the accrual \naccounting system and reporting process, in accordance with the generally accepted accounting \nprinciples in India, and in compliance with the accounting standards issued by the Institute of \nChartered Accountants of India and the relevant provisions of the Companies Act of 1956 to the \nextent applicable. JMRC will maintain separate project records and accounts to identify the \nfinancing resources received and expenditures made for the project, ensuring an adequate audit \n                                                 \n14  The chairperson and managing director is from the Indian Administrative Service. Senior administrative and \ntechnical staff have experience with the state government, Indian Railways, and other metro rail corporations in \nIndia. \n15  Delhi Metro Rail Corporation has assisted JMRC with the implementation of Line 1-Phase A, which is nearing \ncompletion on time and within budget. It has a sound reputation and track record of executing metro systems in \nDelhi, and assisting with start-ups in other major cities in India. \n ", "7 \ntrail, and will cause the annual financial statements to be audited by an auditor acceptable to \nADB in accordance with auditing standards acceptable to ADB. \n \n22.  Procurement  and  anticorruption.  All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be \nundertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to \ntime). All consultants will be recruited according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  general  procurement  environment  is  being \nstrengthened with the recently enacted Rajasthan Transparency in Public Procurement Act of \n2012, to regulate public procurement with the objectives of ensuring transparency, fair and \nequitable treatment of bidders, promoting competition, enhancing efficiency and economy, and \nsafeguarding integrity in the procurement process.  \n \n23.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  of  India,  government  of  Rajasthan,  and  JMRC.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual \n(footnote 10).  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n24.  Poverty reduction and social impact. The urban poverty level in the state of Rajasthan \nis higher than the national average of about 41.8%.16 The incidence of rural poverty declined \nfrom FY1994 to FY2004, but the urban poverty level has remained almost at the same level \nduring the same period, in contrast to the significant decline at national level. As part of the \npoverty and social assessment, households were surveyed and focus group discussions held. \nThe  majority  of  people  indicated  that  the  project  will  increase  economic  and  employment \nopportunities  by  improving  linkages  to  markets,  production  centers,  and  public  and  social \nservice facilities, while providing a safe and reliable mode of public transportation. The project is \nexpected  to  have  significant  development  impacts  since  economic  growth  and  delivery  of \ninfrastructure and social services to the population are instrumental for poverty alleviation. It \nsupports the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, which, among other things, \nseeks to bring about comprehensive improvements in urban infrastructure to provide easy and \nsustainable flow of goods and peoples in order to support the required level of economic \nactivity.17 \n \n25.  Gender.  The  improved  access  to  markets  and  basic  social  and  other  services  will \ncontribute to improved health and education outcomes, particularly among women and children. \nFocus group discussions undertaken with women in the project influence area indicate that \ncurrent travel by public transport is an uncomfortable experience\u2014especially for women, the \nelderly, and persons with disabilities\u2014as the buses and minibuses are congested. The metro \nrail will be a safe, comfortable, and reliable mode of public transportation, reducing journey time \nconsiderably and providing better access to markets, workplaces, higher education, health \nfacilities, and employment opportunities. Reserved seats for women, the elderly, and persons \nwith  disabilities  are  some  of  the  features  planned.  For  the  convenience  and  safety  of  all \npassengers,  especially  women  and  the  vulnerable,  station  facilities  include  public \n                                                 \n16  The estimates of the Planning Commission in FY2009 set the poverty line in Rajasthan at Rs846 per month \n(Rs28.20 per day) in urban areas and Rs755 per month (Rs25.16 per day) in rural areas. This is a jump from \nRs568.15 per month (Rs18.93 per day) in urban areas and Rs478 per month (Rs15.23 per day) in rural areas for \nFY2004. \n17  India\u2019s urban population of about 285 million is expected to almost double to 550 million over the next 20 years\u2014\nan average addition of more than 11 million new urban residents each year.

The proposed project will also provide job opportunities for women in the \noperation and maintenance of the metro rail systems such as ticketing staff, station personnel, \nas well as in the technical aspects of driving the trains and other engineering-related jobs. The \nbidding documents provide clauses to ensure that all civil works contractors comply with labor \nlaws by not employing child labor; encouraging the employment of the poor, particularly women; \nand not offering different wages to men and women for work of equal value. \n \n26.  Sexually transmitted infections. Combating HIV/AIDS is one of the UN Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, which aims to halt the spread of HIV/AIDS by 2015. The Government of \nIndia, along with the National AIDS Control Organisation and Rajasthan State AIDS Control \nSociety, has been successfully carrying out awareness campaigns and free health care to \nminimize the spread of HIV/AIDS in various parts of the country. Under the National Aids \nControl Program Phase III, district AIDS prevention and control units have been established in \nseven out of 32 districts in the state, as priority districts based on HIV Sentinel Surveillance \n2004\u20132006. Based on the poverty and social assessment, the project does not anticipate any \nrise in the risk of HIV/AIDS incidence. Contractors will carry out HIV/AIDS awareness activities \nfor laborers at work sites, which will be monitored by JMRC. \n \nE.  Safeguards  \n1.  Involuntary Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples \n \n27.  Land acquisition and resettlement. The project is classified category C in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The underground stations will be constructed by \ncut and cover with the top\u2013down method. No private land acquisition is envisaged as the entry \nand  exit  structures  are  planned  in  public  squares,  which  have  sufficient  unencumbered \ngovernment  land  available.  If  any  changes  or  additional  land  requirements  or  involuntary \nresettlement impacts are identified, a resettlement plan will be prepared in accordance with the \nSafeguard Policy Statement for ADB approval before award of the related civil works contract, \nand for implementation before commencement of the relevant section of the civil works, as \napplicable. Due diligence on land acquisition and resettlement was carried out for Line 1-Phase \nA  (existing  facility  being  completed),  financed  by  the  Government  of  India  and  the  state \ngovernment, to review the resettlement actions conducted by JMRC and whether any reputation \nrisk was involved for ADB in financing Line 1-Phase B. The due diligence conducted for Line 1-\nPhase A suggests that adequate and appropriate compensation has been paid to the affected \npersons.  In  the  majority  of  cases,  mitigation  measures  included  compensation,  relocation, \nlivelihood rehabilitation measures, and ensuring restoration of incomes of both titled and non-\ntitled affected persons.18 \n \n28.  Impact on indigenous peoples. No impact on indigenous peoples is envisaged, as no \nphysical  or  economic  displacement  will  be  required.  Therefore,  the  project  is  classified \ncategory C. If any adverse impacts are identified during implementation, JMRC will ensure that \nthe indigenous peoples plan is prepared in accordance with the Safeguard Policy Statement for \n                                                 \n18 All land acquisition and other mitigation measures for resettlement, rehabilitation, and relocation were completed \nfor Line 1-Phase A, prior to ADB involvement in Line 1-Phase B.

Environment \n \n29.  The project is categorized A in accordance with the Safeguard Policy Statement, as a \nresult  of  potential  impacts  on  heritage  structures  located  in  the  area  under  which  the \nunderground metro section will be passing through. An EIA has been conducted to identify all \nsensitive issues and recommend mitigation measures. An environmental audit has also been \nconducted for Line 1-Phase A (existing facility), which is under construction with financing from \nthe Government of India and the state government. Key findings show that the contractors are \nstrictly abiding by the requirements of the safety, health, and environment (SHE) guidelines \nincluded in the contract agreements. The SHE guidelines form a comprehensive document that \nincludes stringent requirements on environmental safeguards. The requirement of compliance \nwith the SHE guidelines will be continued for the ADB-financed Line 1-Phase B. In addition, a \nsite-specific environmental management plan (EMP) and environmental monitoring plan will be \nincluded in the contract agreements for the construction of Line 1-Phase B.  \n \n30.  As Line 1-Phase B is an underground section, the key issues are anticipated to be \nvibration impacts on the heritage structures above ground, generation of large quantities of \nwaste from the tunneling works, and occupational health and safety impacts. Measures to \naddress  these  concerns  have  been  taken  through  technical  modifications  in  the  structural \ndesign by referring to lessons from similar construction undertaken in the Delhi metro project, \nthe  requirement  of  continuous  monitoring  of  heritage  structures  above  ground,  and  strict \ncompliance with the SHE guidelines and site-specific EMP and environmental monitoring plan. \nConsultations have been carried out, and stakeholder concerns have been addressed in the \nproject design and EIA. Stakeholder concerns will continue to be addressed during construction \nthrough  the  grievance  redress  mechanism  in  the  EIA.  In  accordance  with  the  120  days \ndisclosure requirement of the Safeguard Policy Statement for environment category A projects, \nthe draft EIA report was disclosed on the ADB website on 21 June 2013. \n \n31.  JMRC has a system in place for executing safeguards during the implementation of \nLine 1-Phase  A.  This  will  be  enhanced,  with  clear  demarcation  of  responsibilities  for  the \nsafeguards cell in JMRC, improving the grievance redress mechanism, and ensuring rigorous \nmonitoring of the heritage sites. The safeguards cell will include a senior officer with two \nassistant officers responsible for social and environmental safeguards. The safeguards cell will \nbe  responsible  for  the  overall  coordination  of  compliance  with  environmental  safeguard \nrequirements  under  the  project.  The  project  management  consultant  assisting  JMRC  with \nconstruction supervision will include an environmental specialist and a heritage site expert to \nensure  compliance  with  the  SHE  guidelines  and  site-specific  EMP  and  environmental \nmonitoring plan. The contractors will have a health and safety officer on site, responsible for \nday-to-day  compliance  with  the  SHE  guidelines  and  site-specific  EMP  and  environmental \nmonitoring plan. A coordination meeting, along with a training workshop to clarify roles and \nresponsibilities  and  reporting  requirements  will  be  held  before  construction  works  begin. \nQuarterly monitoring reports will be prepared and submitted to ADB for disclosure on the ADB \nwebsite.  \n \n ", "10 \nF.
