THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nIndia for the Integrated Urban Flood Management for the Chennai\u2013Kosasthalaiyar Basin Project.   \n \n2.  The project will strengthen climate and disaster resilience in the Chennai\u2013Kosasthalaiyar \nRiver basin. It will reduce the exposure of 1.9 million people to seasonal flooding by (i) improving \nclimate-resilient urban flood protection infrastructure; (ii) enhancing urban flood preparedness of \nthe Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC), the civic body that governs the city of Chennai, and \nproject communities; and (iii) establishing measures for sustaining the operation and maintenance \n(O&M) of the stormwater drainage system in the GCC.1  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Vulnerability of an urban economic center. Chennai is the fourth largest metropolitan \narea in India, with an estimated population of 10.7 million.2 The population density is about \n26,000 persons  per  square  kilometer  (km2),  with  a  high  concentration  of  businesses  and \nindustries. It is one of India\u2019s fastest-growing major cities, with an annual economic growth rate \nof  6%.  Its  economy  has  diversified  substantially  over  the  past  2  decades,  now  including \nautomobile, information technology, and health care industries; financial services; and post-\nsecondary educational institutions, as well as a manufacturing base producing various other types \nof hardware. Automobile and electronic goods are important export-oriented industries, making \nChennai the largest exporting hub in India. The city is in the East Coast Economic Corridor\u2014\nIndia\u2019s first coastal corridor, as defined by the Government of India and the Asian Development \nBank (ADB)\u2014stretching more than 2,500 kilometers (km) from West Bengal to Tamil Nadu to \nstimulate economic growth by promoting manufacturing and creating jobs.3 Chennai is a key \nplayer in the state and national economies, contributing 60% of Tamil Nadu\u2019s manufacturing \noutput and 60% of India\u2019s automotive exports.4 \n \n4.  While rapid urbanization has fueled the local economy, the city is challenged to keep pace \nwith demand for urban services while protecting its fragile environment. Chennai\u2019s jurisdiction \nexpanded in 2011 from 174 km2 to 426 km2. An increasing number of migrant workers have settled \nin the city and its suburbs,5 and slums have grown to house 18.9% of the city\u2019s population.6 Lack \nof appropriate planning has allowed urban expansion to alter the natural landscape and land use, \nshrinking water bodies and expanding impermeable areas. The water retention capacity of the \ncity\u2019s  water  bodies  is  reduced  through  increased  encroachment  and  unplanned  area \n \n1  The GCC is headed by a mayor and legally distinct from the state government. It is mandated to provide and maintain \ndrainage systems within its boundaries following the Chennai City Municipal Corporation Act, 1919. \n2  The population is projected using the Census 2011 figure of 8.9 million people and 2.32% annual growth.

Half of the 19 major water bodies in the city \nhave been encroached upon, severely limiting the available surface water storage potential and \nits ability to mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events. Such environmental degradation \nheightens the risk of widespread damage and loss to the economy and livelihoods from flooding. \nIndustrial enterprises are exposed to worsening risks of severe asset damage and income loss \nfrom prolonged inundation, undercutting the area\u2019s ability to attract investment. Many slum \nresidents live in substandard housing in flood-prone zones. Their average family income is less \nthan half of non-slum households\u2019 income.7 With limited access to basic services, urban low-\nincome households lack the capacity to cope with floods. \n \n5.  Increasing flood risk with extreme weather events. Chennai is located on the highly \nexposed southeast  coast  of  India and is  relatively  low  and flat,  with  average elevation of \n6.7 meters (m) above sea level. Three major rivers\u2014the Adyar, Cooum, and Kosasthalaiyar\u2014\ntraverse a coastal bowl, which frequently inundates following even short periods of rain. In the \npast decade, the city has endured more frequent and intense flood and drought extremes. In \n2015, Chennai recorded rainfall depth of 348 millimeters (mm) over a 24-hour period, exceeding \nthe 1:100-year annual recurrence interval rainfall depth estimate, following multiple torrential \nrainfall events in the course of a month. This caused severe flooding, which claimed more than \n400 lives.8 Of the 859 locations across the city inundated during the flood, 306 reported inundation \ndepths of 0.6\u20131.5 m for more than 10 days. More than 12,000 residents of Chennai were sheltered \nin 170 relief centers for more than 20 days.9 The floods destroyed property and livelihoods, \nparticularly of the poor and other vulnerable groups residing next to water bodies. Impacts on the \nenvironment and public health were high, as sanitation worsened and vector-borne, waterborne, \nand airborne diseases spread.10 \n \n6.  The Climate Change Vulnerability Index of 2021 ranks Chennai the highest among large \nIndian cities in terms of exposure to climate change-related threats.11 Another study shows that \nChennai  is  ranked  the  most  socioeconomically  vulnerable  to  climate  change  among  the \nmetropolitan cities in India.12 The risk of flooding in Chennai is expected to worsen with climate \nchange. Climate models project an 11% increase in heavy rainfall under the Representative \nConcentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 16% under the RCP 8.5 to 2050, which will likely cause \nmore frequent and damaging floods if drainage infrastructure is not improved. The rise in sea \nlevel, projected at 4\u20136 mm per year under the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 to 2050, will worsen coastal \nflooding and the tide-locking of drainage outlets, requiring greater drainage capacity. Higher storm \nsurges from tropical cyclones can prevent the free drainage of stormwater and increase reliance \non pumping. Higher temperatures and more frequent droughts are expected to exacerbate water \nscarcity in the city. These issues are identified in the Tamil Nadu State Action Plan on Climate \n \n7  The average monthly family income of slum households in Chennai is \u20b911,394, while that of non-slum households is \n\u20b927,044.

Challenges  to  strengthening  climate  and  disaster  resilience  in  the  Chennai\u2013\nKosasthalaiyar basin. The Kosasthalaiyar River basin spans 3,757 km2 across two states: \nTamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. The basin within the boundaries of the GCC, called the \nChennai\u2013Kosasthalaiyar basin, measures 128 km2 and covers 30% of the GCC land area. Most \nof this area was added to the GCC when it expanded in 2011. A review of land use shows that \nmost new development in Greater Chennai occurs in this area and includes a high concentration \nof industry, raising demand for land for both industrial plants and housing. Further growth is \nexpected as the GCC improves connectivity to city business centers. With rapid urbanization, \nfloodwater retention capacity is constrained and diminished by (i) reduced groundwater infiltration \ncapacity  with  the  spread  of  impermeable  surfaces,  reduced  green  cover,  and  degraded \necosystem services; (ii) inadequate and deteriorating flood protection infrastructure such as \nstormwater  drains,  water  storage  bodies,  large  channels  linking  water  bodies,  and  pump \nstations;14 and (iii) inadequate O&M of flood management infrastructure because of poor asset \nmanagement, lack of performance monitoring, and insufficient O&M budget allocation. Further, \nflood risk management is inadequate as (i) urban land use planning and development control \nregulations, such as flood zoning regulations, do not sufficiently recognize current and future \nhazards; (ii) flood forecasting and early warning systems are limited; and (iii) capacity and \nawareness shortfalls render the GCC and city residents unable to respond quickly to flooding. \n \n8.  Consequently,  about  63%  of  the  Chennai\u2013Kosasthalaiyar  basin  is  flood-prone,  with \n15.9 km2 highly or very highly vulnerable.15 In 2015, floods inundated more than 80% of the \nproject area. Only about one-third of the area has drains, and some places have inadequate \ncapacity to convey flood flows likely to occur once every 2 years (1:2-year return period). \nIndustries  and  residents  are  increasingly  vulnerable  to  frequent,  intense,  hazardous,  and \ndestructive floods. Climate change can have knock-on effects on industrial supply chains. Severe \nflooding disrupts manufacturing operations in low-lying areas and interrupts physical distribution \nto downstream companies. Ensuring business continuity requires additional costs and contingent \nlogistics, adversely impacting small businesses. Slum dwellers are susceptible to loss of livelihood \nbecause  of  their  low  flood  risk  awareness  and  limited  access  to  basic  services  and  job \nopportunities. Women suffer disproportionately from floods, reflecting their limited involvement in \ndecision-making within their communities and potential discrimination against them at shelters. \nRecognizing these socioeconomic impacts and the complex meteorologic and hydrologic causes \nof flooding in the Chennai\u2013Kosasthalaiyar basin, strengthening flood resilience requires robust \nand holistic approaches to flood risk management. Interventions should be adaptive to future \nuncertainty by optimally combining (i) structural measures to reduce flood risk by controlling the \nflow of water through hard-engineered structures and green solutions, and (ii) nonstructural \nmeasures  to  keep  people  safe  from  floods  through  improved  preparedness  planning  and \npromoting behavioral change to build resilience over the long-term. Along with climate-resilient \ninfrastructure, Chennai City requires integrated urban planning linking flood hazard zoning with \nland use planning and enhancing the municipal resource mobilization, to ensure the sustainable \nprovision of quality services to the citizens.   \n \n \n13 Government of Tamil Nadu. 2014. State Action Plan on Climate Change: Towards Balanced Growth and Resilience. \nChennai. \n14 Most drains in the Chennai\u2013Kosasthalaiyar basin were constructed 2 decades ago. A nearby canal in low-lying \ncoastal areas is elevated above the lowest part of the catchment, worsening floods in 2015. \n15 Very high vulnerability is defined as inundation above 1.5 m and high vulnerability above 0.9\u20131.5 m. \n ", "4 \n9.  Government strategy. A strong rationale supports government involvement in reducing \nclimate and disaster risk to communities and businesses. The Tamil Nadu Vision 2023 and the \nTamil Nadu Sustainable Water Security Mission envisage a more resilient future by ensuring more \nstrategic, holistic, and integrated interventions to address the interconnected problems that cause \nfloods. 16 The  GCC,  in  its  City  Disaster  Management  Plan,  envisions  enhanced  disaster \npreparedness to maximize its ability to cope with disasters and significantly reduce the loss of \nlives, livelihoods, and property (footnote 9). The GCC prioritizes the restoration and protection of \nits water bodies to boost their stormwater retention capacity by recharging the groundwater \naquifer. The World Bank has supported GCC efforts to improve drainage in the Adyar and Cooum \nriver basins in the central zone and will develop an early flood warning system for the entire \nChennai  metropolitan  area.  German  development  cooperation  through  KfW  finances  the \nimprovement of stormwater drainage systems in the Kovalam River basin in southern Chennai. \nGiven the city\u2019s high climate hazard risks, the governments of India and Tamil Nadu have \nrequested ADB support to strengthen the stormwater drainage network in the remaining river \nbasin, the Kosasthalaiyar.  \n \n10.  Lessons.  Global  experience  has  shown  that  (i)  flood  risk  management  should  be \nintegrated with urban planning and management, (ii) combining structural and nonstructural \nmeasures is the most effective strategy to manage flood risk, (iii) flood management measures \ncan have multiple co-benefits from nature-based solution such as increased amenity value and \nbiodiversity improved by the greening of urban spaces and water body rejuvenation, and (iv) \nadequate O&M of flood management assets is key to sustainable management.17 An ADB \nregional working paper suggests an integrated urban management approach in which urban \nstormwater management is supported by the management of other urban utilities, such as \nsewage  collection  and  treatment,  and  solid  waste  collection  and  disposal.18 Urban  flood \nmanagement projects in Kolkata supported by ADB have shown that awareness campaigns \neffectively improve people\u2019s preparedness for flooding.19  \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n11.  The project is aligned with the following impact: Chennai City made a safe place to live in, \nwith reduced vulnerability to disaster (footnote 9). The project will have the following outcome: \nclimate and disaster resilience in the Chennai\u2013Kosasthalaiyar River basin strengthened.20 \n \n12.  Output 1: Climate-resilient urban flood protection infrastructure improved in the \nChennai\u2013Kosasthalaiyar  River  basin.  This  will  include  structural  measures  such  as \n(i) constructing 588 km of new stormwater drains; (ii) rehabilitating or replacing 175 km of \nstormwater drains; (iii) improving 11 km stretches in the Ambattur, Ariyallur, Kadappakkam, and \n \n16 Government of Tamil Nadu. 2012.

This  will  include \n(i) performance-based incentives (PBIs) for zonal offices linked to operational efficiency and the \nsustainability of stormwater drainage systems; (ii) a plan formulated to improve the sustainable \nand inclusive O&M of stormwater drainage systems; (iii) a road map for enhancing municipal \nresource mobilization by the GCC; (iv) improved knowledge of GCC staff on sustainable O&M of \ndrainage systems, and management of solid waste and flood risk; and (v) improved knowledge \nand skills of desilting and conservancy workers on cleaning and maintaining stormwater drainage \n \n21 These are surplus channels that constitute the primary drainage system, receiving runoff from one or more sub-\nbasins and carrying it to the final discharge points. \n22 A gender-responsive and socially inclusive relief camp will have the following features: (i) at least one female worker \nor caretaker with supplies of sanitary napkins, soap, and a basic first aid kit with medicines; (ii) safe spaces (affording \nprivacy and security) for women, especially nursing mothers and adolescent girls; (iii) well-lit and clean toilets for \nmen and women, with barrier-free access for people with disabilities and older persons; water, hooks, ledges, and \nshelves in the toilet; and provisions for washing and disposal of menstrual products; (iv) regular (daily) visits by \nfemale student volunteers and awareness generation on women\u2019s vulnerability to violence and trafficking; (v) regular \ninteraction between volunteers and people with disabilities within the relief camp; and (vi) helpline numbers displayed \non walls. \n23 The design adopts a 1:2-year return period in line with national standards (2013) at the time of design stage and \ndesign standards adopted for other drainage basins in the GCC area, able to handle rainfall intensity of 68 mm per \nhour. As Chennai is at high risk from climate change (paras. 5 to 8), the drain design was tested for climate change \nimpacts under an RCP 8.5 scenario and found to safely withstand the projected impact by 2050, or rainfall intensity \nof 79 mm per hour. The proposed stormwater drains will be covered with curb inlets or inlets from the rainwater \ncatchpits through gratings. This will help in avoiding solid waste choking the drains and reducing the water-carrying \ncapacity. \n ", "6 \nsystems. The PBIs will be awarded based on a reporting system and database of key performance \nindicators for all zonal offices that will be established by 2023, with a focus on improving GCC \nmanagement of drainage systems with timely maintenance services. The incentive payments will \nbe used for additional activities that support the project\u2019s objective.24 The Sustainable O&M \nImprovement Plan will enable the GCC to ensure adequate O&M of the created assets, based on \nthe newly established asset management system and the experiences of the PBI program. The \nRoad Map for Enhanced Municipal Resource Mobilization will provide a strategic implementation \nplan to improve revenue management in terms of revenue coverage, valuation, liability, collection, \nand taxpayer services; strengthen information interlinkage with other utilities; and promote digital \ntransformation with enhanced data analytics. With robust economic growth and rising populations, \nthe GCC is poised to increase its own municipal revenues. The road map will help it create an \nenabling framework for efficient, equitable, and accountable revenue management while phasing \nin improvements that are socially acceptable and operationally efficient. \n \n15.  Alignment with ADB priorities. The project aligns with ADB Strategy 2030 by supporting \nkey operational priorities: addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities; accelerating \nprogress in gender equality; tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and \nenhancing  environmental  sustainability;  making  cities  more  livable;  and  strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity.25 It aligns with the water security policy recommendations \n,\nof the Asian Water Development Outlook 2020 by promoting urban water security through \nmitigation of disaster risk especially for the urban poor, and strengthening preparedness and \nresilience to counter current and future water-related disasters.26 The project reinforces pillars 2 \nand  3  of  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  India,  2018\u20132022  by  supporting  inclusive \nurbanization and improving climate and disaster resilience.27 It aligns with ADB\u2019s strategic priority \nin the East Coast Economic Corridor by providing disaster-resilient infrastructure (para. 3).  \n \nC.

With ADB support, the project design includes (i) a more robust and adaptive integrated \napproach to cope with a wide range of climate change and disaster risks through structural and \nnonstructural measures, contributing to the adaptation and resilience-related goal of the Paris \nAgreement, and to the priorities of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction; (ii) green \nsolutions such as a green infrastructure design manual, and PBIs for green infrastructure; \n(iii) integrated urban planning, by linking flood hazard zoning with spatial and land use planning; \n(iv) making future flood resilience measurable by establishing a benchmark and developing a \nframework  to  improve  the  city\u2019s  performance  in  natural,  economic,  social,  physical,  and \ninstitutional dimensions; (v) a citizen-centric flood observatory system to gather local information \nin larger areas and complement the early flood warning system being developed by the GCC; \n(vi)  an incentive mechanism, operation and maintenance improvement plan, and resource \nmobilization road map to promote sustainable O&M of stormwater drainage systems; and (vii) \nenhanced  gender  responsiveness  and  social  inclusion  to  mitigate  the  long-term  social \nconsequences of flooding. These project interventions will help the GCC to transform the project \narea into a livable city. Integrated urban planning, along with climate-resilient infrastructure, will \nimprove  municipal  revenues  through  effective  land  value  capturing,  enabling  sustainable \nprovision of quality municipal services to the citizens. \n \n18.  To further add value, a project grant from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) \nis being processed as cofinancing to improve the management of flood and pandemic risks in \nflood-prone low-income communities in the Chennai\u2013Kosasthalaiyar basin. Chennai is among the \ncities in India most severely affected by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), with more than \n540,000  confirmed  cases  as  of  15  August  2021. 32 Low-income  urban  communities  are \nincreasingly vulnerable to multiple crises from COVID-19 outbreaks and climate-related disasters. \nThe JFPR grant will improve infection prevention and control of COVID-19 through interventions \nto enhance (i) water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) at schools and community health centers;33 \n(ii) water quality and disease surveillance;34  and (iii) community preparedness and response \ncapacity to deal with the dual crises of pandemics and floods.

Replication and scaling up strategy. The project\u2019s innovative designs and interventions \nfor climate-resilient flood management along with integrated urban planning and enhanced \nmunicipal resource mobilization can be widely replicated for cities that are increasingly exposed \nto climate and disaster risks in India and beyond. To promote replication, ADB will capture the \nexperience and knowledge gained from the project into knowledge products, and disseminate \nthese to the government through workshops and regional forums, and through the Capacity \nDevelopment Resource Center in ADB\u2019s India Resident Mission. The COVID-19 response being \nprocessed for JFPR cofinancing (para. 18) will be a pilot intervention of ADB COVID-19 and \nWASH nexus support in India, and a model of an integrated response to epidemics and disasters \nin urban areas across South Asia. An innovative disease surveillance and epidemic response can \nbe applied in settings with few resources. Successful implementation will encourage scaling up \nof the model across the region through knowledge publications and workshops. Further, good \npractices and lessons on water body rejuvenation to be financed through the GEF grant being \nprocessed (para. 18) will be shared with cities in India\u2014through a platform under the National \nInstitute for Urban Affairs\u2014and globally under the GEF Sustainable Cities Global Platform. The \nglobal platform will deliver technical services such as thematic training, support for innovation on \nurban planning, and peer-to-peer learning to more than 50 cities across 17 countries, including \n33 cities in Asia. The experience and approaches of the project including the nature-based \nsolution of water body rejuvenation will be relevant to cities around the world searching for \nintegrated solutions to urban water resources management and flood risk mitigation. \n \nD.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n24.  The project will address the major root causes of floods by constructing integrated flood \nmanagement infrastructure in the Chennai\u2013Kosasthalaiyar basin and strengthening the capacity \nof the GCC and communities to operate these assets. The drainage design of the proposed \nGCC\u2019s system ensures the integration of eight major lakes and three other surplus channels \nmaintained by the Tamil Nadu Public Works Department in the Chennai\u2013Kosasthalaiyar basin. \nThe climate risk and adaptation assessment was prepared as part of the technical due diligence. \nThe proposed stormwater drainage system features a climate-resilient design to cope with \nintensifying rainfall, a higher sea level rise, and a storm surge caused by a cyclone (para. 12). \nCatchpits will boost groundwater recharge in paved areas of a region at risk of water scarcity.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n25.  Economic analysis. The economic rationale for government intervention is sound, as the \nproject aims to improve basic urban services in Chennai City, focusing on flood risk management. \nThe economic analysis for the project assesses direct and indirect damage and losses for flood \nevents.39 The benefits associated with the project interventions include (i) avoided flood damage \ncosts  to  assets  and  physical  infrastructure,  and  (ii)  other  avoided  costs.40 The  probability \ndistribution function of these costs is estimated based on the frequency of floods with different \nintensities. The net benefits are calculated as the difference between the without-project and with-\nproject scenarios. The estimated economic internal rate of return of the project is 13.5%, which is \n \n39 The project will directly benefit 1.9 million people living in the flood-prone areas, and indirectly benefit 2.8 million \npeople in the project area through an improved drainage system. \n40 Other avoided costs include savings in residential flood maintenance costs, road maintenance costs, income loss to \nresidents during flooding days, and income loss to commercial units. \n ", "11 \nhigher than the minimum required economic opportunity cost of capital of 6.0%,41 indicating \nsignificant economic returns. Sensitivity analysis results were satisfactory, including in a scenario \nthat combines a 20% increase in capital and O&M costs, a 20% reduction in project benefits, and \nan  implementation  delay  of  1  year.  The  economic  viability  is  expected  to  strengthen  if \nunquantifiable benefits such as environmental improvement, industrial development, and savings \nin health expenditures are included in the analysis. \n \n26.  Financial analysis. The project does not generate revenue. There is no project-specific \nrevenue stream that would cover O&M expenses. Historical and future cash flow analysis was \nconducted for the GCC, which will operate and maintain the assets to be constructed under this \nproject. Analysis found that the GCC (i) shows an operating surplus in recent years, except fiscal \nyear 2018; (ii) depends largely on its own income, while the Government of Tamil Nadu has \nprovided adequate revenue grants and subsidies as needed to improve the GCC\u2019s operating \nrevenue;  (iii)  has  recently  maintained  adequate  operating  revenue  to  cover  operating \nexpenditures; and (iv) has the financial capacity for the O&M of the project, especially for the initial \nyears of operation of the assets to be created under the loan. The financial sustainability risk is \nthus categorized moderate. The GCC is taking the initiative to increase property tax revenues by \nconducting streetwise enumeration using drone cameras, with a door-to-door physical survey, \nand developing a geographic information system-based map and database. The GCC will ensure \nthe long-term O&M sustainability of the assets via a PBI program for zonal offices, a plan for \nsustainable O&M, and a revenue enhancement road map under output 3 (para. 14).42 \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n27.  Operational capacity will be strengthened through a PBI program for GCC zonal offices, \nwhich will establish performance indicators and incentives for achieving threshold scores. The \nkey  performance  indicators  include  zonal  offices  regularly  reporting  on  their  maintenance \nactivities and flood status, the completion of maintenance activities, and the incidence of flooding \nand inundation in zonal areas. The GCC will adopt the Sustainable O&M Plan of the stormwater \ndrainage system, forecasting the O&M expenditures and committing to adequate allocation in its \nyearly budget. The plan will promote community participation, of women in particular, which is \nrequired for sustainable O&M. The project will also support the GCC to prepare and adopt a road \nmap  to  enhance  its  resource  mobilization  by  conducting  situational  analysis  and  strategic \nassessment. The road map will provide revenue administration reform in the short term and \nrevenue policy reform in the medium term. The project features capacity building to improve GCC \nstaff  knowledge  of  integrated  urban  flood  management  and  the  skills  that  desilting  and \nconservancy workers need to clean and maintain stormwater drainage systems.  \n \nD.  Governance \n \n28.  Financial management. A financial management assessment of the GCC was conducted \nin accordance with ADB guidelines.43 The GCC has adequate financial management capacity to \n(i) record the required financial transactions, (ii) provide reliable annual financial statements and \naudit  reports,  and  (iii)  safeguard  financial  assets.  The  assessed  pre-mitigation  financial \nmanagement risk is substantial mainly because (i) accounts staff lack knowledge of ADB financial \nreporting and audit requirements and disbursement procedures because the GCC has not \n \n41 ADB. 2017.

The risk will be mitigated by (i) engaging an accounts and finance expert to \nsupport the project, (ii) providing training on ADB financial reporting and audit requirements and \nits disbursement procedures, and (iii) including comprehensive financial information in quarterly \nprogress reports. Moreover, the project financial statements will be audited annually by an \nindependent  auditor  following  auditing  standards  acceptable  to  ADB.  A  detailed  financial \nmanagement action plan is included in the PAM (footnote 36). \n \n29.  Procurement. All procurement of goods and works and consultant recruitment will adhere \nto  the  ADB  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). Value for money is \nachieved by consolidating packages based on market analysis of medium-sized companies in a \nbalanced, competitive environment. Other factors considered are ease of implementation, the use \nof electronic government procurement to improve transparency, and the use of post-review \nsampling to improve procurement time. Conformance-based specification is adopted to achieve \na high degree of cost certainty. With these arrangements, the GCC has achieved high project \nreadiness, with all civil works contracts under the loan already awarded. \n \n30.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the governments of India and Tamil Nadu and the GCC. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 36). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n31.  Poverty and social. The project will reduce the vulnerability of Chennai\u2013Kosasthalaiyar \nbasin residents to frequent and destructive floods, which have in recent years destroyed property \nand livelihoods and greatly complicated day-to-day life. The project area includes 395 slums that \nhouse 11.7% of its population.44 Many of these slums are densely populated and located \nalongside watercourses and low-lying areas, making the poor increasingly vulnerable to flooding. \nWhile improved flood protection infrastructure will directly benefit all residents in the project area, \nthe socially excluded and vulnerable groups\u2014income poor, women, older persons, children, and \npeople with disabilities\u2014are anticipated to benefit greatly from the project. The nonstructural \nmeasures will further reduce their vulnerability by enhancing flood preparedness to protect their \nlives and property.  \n \n32.  Gender. The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. Affirmative measures \npromoting gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment include (i) upgrading flood relief camps to \nmake  them  gender-responsive  and  socially  inclusive;  (ii)  enhancing  community  capacity, \nincluding of women, in green infrastructure investments and rainwater harvesting; (iii) conducting \nawareness programs targeting women on flood risks and the links that connect flooding, solid \nwaste management, and the protection of water bodies; (iv) conducting audience-segmented \nbehavior change communication campaigns in slums to raise awareness of the vulnerabilities of \nwomen, children, older persons, and people with disabilities in the context of flooding; (v) training \nvulnerable  slum  dwellers,  especially  women,  to  enhance  their  employability  or  alternative \nlivelihoods;  and  (vi)  providing  staff  training  for  institutional  strengthening  and  gender \nsensitization.45 \n \n44 Government of Tamil Nadu, Housing and Urban Development Department. 2016.

The  project  implementation  unit  will  prepare  semiannual  environmental  and  social \nmonitoring reports for ADB review and disclosure. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard categories are as follows.46 \n \n34.  Environment (category B). The GCC has prepared an initial environmental examination \n(IEE) report, including an environmental management plan, for the proposed improvement of \nstormwater drainage systems. The project is located in urban and peri-urban areas along the Bay \nof Bengal coast. The IEE shows that project activities are unlikely to have significant adverse \nenvironmental impacts that are unprecedented or irreversible. Predicted impacts are short term, \nsite-specific, and experienced mainly during construction, and they can be mitigated or minimized \nto an acceptable level with good construction practices and the mitigation measures defined in \nthe environmental management plan, which has a health and safety plan specific to COVID-19. \nNo works will commence in the Coastal Regulation Zone until clearance is obtained. Meaningful \nstakeholder consultations were conducted during project preparation and will continue throughout \nimplementation. The GCC will implement an institutional mechanism to manage safeguards, as \ndetailed in the PAM (footnote 36).47 The IEE has been disclosed on the ADB and GCC websites \nand updated before the contract award. \n \n35.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). The GCC has prepared three resettlement plans \nto  cover  all  project  components.  No  land  acquisition  is  envisaged.  Livelihood  impacts  are \nanticipated to be temporary, for a maximum of 15 days each, to 650 business owners (2,192 \nfamily members) and 23 kiosks (79 family members). Loss of minor structures, such as steps or \nramps during construction, is anticipated for 1,873 property owners (7,133 family members) and \nwill be restored by the contractor. Compensation and assistance following the entitlement matrix \nwill be provided before displacement. The proposed mitigation measures and safeguard plans \nadequately address the assessed impacts. A grievance redress mechanism will be established \nand disclosed to beneficiaries and affected persons. Although the GCC demonstrated its capacity \nto meet multilateral development bank safeguard policy requirements while implementing a World \nBank project, this will be its first ADB-financed project. Thus, capacity building on ADB social \nsafeguard  requirements  is  proposed.
