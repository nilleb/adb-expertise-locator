Upon approval, the \nBoard  delegated  authority  to  the  President  to  approve  loans  and/or  grants  to  each  targeted \ncountry for qualifying projects. \n \n2. \nThe facility will finance a grant to Tuvalu for the Increasing Access to Renewable Energy \nProject.  The  project  will  help  the  Government  of  Tuvalu  expand  access  to  modern  energy \nservices; improve the quality, reliability, and climate resilience of service; reduce reliance on fossil \nfuels for power generation; and reduce the cost of generation. The project will decrease the cost \nof supply by partially replacing diesel power with solar power. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nCountry background. Tuvalu is a Polynesian country in the Pacific region, about 1,200 \nkilometers (km) north of Fiji. The country has a total land area of 26 square km and an exclusive \neconomic zone of 900,000 square km. It is composed of nine atolls and islands, of which Funafuti \nis the most populated. It is extremely remote from all markets and most resources. Like many \nother small Pacific islands, Tuvalu\u2019s electricity production relies heavily on imported diesel fuel, \ntransported over long distances across the ocean and subject to climate change\u2013related supply \ndisruptions. As of September 2017, more than 72% of electricity in Tuvalu was diesel generated. \nThis  heightened  climate  change  and  energy  security  problems  and  caused  high  per  capita \n3 Tuvalu has  about  16% renewable  energy  generation  with  98%  of \ngreenhouse gas  emissions.2F\nhouseholds having access to electricity. The focus of the government is to increase the renewable \nenergy penetration on the outer islands to 100%, to be followed by Funafuti. About 7%\u201310% of \ngross domestic product (GDP) is spent on imported fuel (depending on oil prices), making energy \nthe costliest sector of the Tuvalu economy. \n \n4. \nThe vision of Tuvalu\u2019s eighth national development plan, Te Kakeega III: National Strategy \nfor  Sustainable  Development  2016\u20132020,  foresees  a  more  protected,  secure,  and  prosperous \nTuvalu; healthier people who are more engaged in national, regional, and international forums; \nand a government that encourages community input to improve project development, such that \ndevelopment efforts are sustained and adopted by the community. \n \n5. \nLimited renewable electricity access and reliance on diesel. The state-owned Tuvalu \nElectricity Corporation (TEC) is tasked to provide and maintain a safe, secure, stable, financially \nviable, and economically sound power supply. The power systems on Tuvalu\u2019s outer islands of \nNukulaelae, Nukufetau, and Nui were transformed from diesel\u2013powered systems offering 12\u201316 \nhours/day of power supply into hybrid solar\u2013battery\u2013diesel systems in 2015 offering continuous \n\n \n\n1  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2017.

Intended Nationally Determined Contributions. Funafuti (communicated to the United \n\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change [UNFCCC]). \n\n\f2 \n\npower supply, through funding from the European Union. The systems have been achieving 60%\u2013\n70%  annual renewable energy  contribution,  still below  the  100%  government target.  However, \nthree northern islands have reached around 90% through funding from the Government of New \nZealand. \n \n6. \nThe existing Fongafale power system on the main island of Funafuti in 2019 consists of \nthree  600-kilowatt  (kW)  diesel  generators,  735  kilowatt-peak  (kWp)  of  solar  photovoltaic \ngeneration capacity, and a further 82 kWp solar capacity that is nonoperational. The peak load \nobserved is about 1,360 kW. The system has a fuel saver control system installed that applies an \neffective limit on solar output of 415 kW. The combination of this limit and inadequate redundancy \nin  the  system  results  in  diesel  generation  remaining  the  main  source  of  electricity  production. \nBased  on  energy  balance  modeling,  the  existing  system  would  have  a  renewable  energy \ncontribution of only 15% in 2020, and averages 10% over a 25-year period from 2020. The draft \n4 found  that  to  achieve  a  100% \nroad  map  developed  under  ADB\u2019s  technical  assistance  (TA)3F\nrenewable contribution for Funafuti by 2025 would require 7.6 megawatts (MW) of photovoltaic \ncapacity and 3 MW and 14 megawatt-hours (MWh) of a battery energy storage system (BESS), \n5 \nrequiring investments of more than $24 million.4F\n  \n7. \nVolatile revenue base and vulnerable fiscal sustainability. Tuvalu is a micro economy \nin the Pacific, remote from major markets with a narrow production base and with growth mainly \ndriven by public expenditure. In the energy sector, the government intends to reduce the country\u2019s \nreliance on overseas fuel markets. Tuvalu\u2019s economic performance has picked up on the back of \nseveral large infrastructure projects and stimulus from high public expenditure. It is estimated that \nreal  GDP  growth accelerated to 4.3%  in 2018 (from  3.2%  in 2017)  and a slight  fall  to  4.1%  is \nprojected  for  2019.  The  Tuvalu  economy  is  highly  vulnerable  to  external  shocks  and  heavily \ndependent  on  external sources  of  revenue  (fishing  license  fees  and  foreign  aid)  and  imported \nfood and fuel. The public sector dominates the economy. For 2019, the government estimates a \n$1.3 million negative fiscal balance versus a $14.0 million fiscal surplus in 2018 (as a result of \na more than 50% increase in actual receipts of fishing license revenues). External debt is 22% \nas a percentage of GDP, which is within sustainable levels. \n \n8. \nVulnerability  to  climate  change.  Like  many  other  small  island  developing  states, \nespecially  in  the  Pacific,  Tuvalu  is  highly  vulnerable  to  external  economic  shocks  and  climate \nchange. Climate change cuts across all 12 priority areas of Te Kakeega III, as sea-level rise poses \nthe most significant threat to Tuvalu\u2019s survival. Climate change and extreme weather events\u2014\nsuch as increased temperatures; reduced solar radiation; and increased frequency and intensity \nof  rainfall  and  cyclones,  storm  surges,  and  tsunamis\u2014pose  additional  threats  to  energy \ninfrastructure  sustainability.  Climate  change  impacts  will  worsen  existing  development \nchallenges such as deterioration of  infrastructure,  water  shortages, rise  in noncommunicable \ndiseases, population pressures on limited resources, and fuel and food supply disruptions. \n \n9. \nProposed  solutions.  The  project,  ADB\u2019s  first  in  Tuvalu\u2019s  energy  sector,  will  help  the \ngovernment (i) transform the Funafuti and outer island power systems from manual, diesel-based \npower  systems  into  modern,  automated,  power  systems  based  on  a  high  level  of  renewable \nenergy;  improve  the  quality,  reliability,  and  climate  resilience  of  service;  reduce  reliance  on \nimported fuels for power generation; and reduce the cost of generation by partially replacing diesel \n\n4  ADB. 2016.

The old powerhouse was flooded during Cyclone Pam. \n \n21. \nOn Funafuti, however, there is little benefit in adding further solar photovoltaic capacity to \nthe  existing  power  system  without  providing  technology  that  can  remove  the  solar  output \nconstraint. This is a key benefit of installing a BESS as this will remove that constraint, and in the \nearly years will even allow short periods where the diesel generators could be turned off (zero \ndiesel operation). With the proposed addition of 500 kW of rooftop photovoltaic capacity and a \n1.0 MW, 2.0 MWh BESS, the renewable energy contribution in Funafuti is modeled to increase \nfrom 15% to 32% in 2020, and average 21% over the 25-year period from 2020. Replacement of \nthe diesel generators will be required multiple times over the 25-year period, and the addition of \na  fourth  and  then  fifth  diesel  generator  will  also  be  required  to  service  forecast  increases  in \nelectricity demand. By sizing the BESS larger than is currently required by the amount of solar \nphotovoltaic capacity in the system, the power system will be set up to optimally install a further \n3.2  MW  of  solar  photovoltaic  capacity.  When  this  capacity  is  added  to  the  power  system,  the \nrenewable  energy  contribution  on  Funafuti  is  modeled  to  increase  to  58%  in  the  first  year  of \ninstallation (nominally 2023), and average 50% over the 25-year period from 2020. The addition \nof such solar capacity is likely to see the deferral of diesel generator replacement and reduce the \nneed for additional diesel generators. A further stage of development in 2025 with the addition of \nmore solar and BESS capacity would move the Fongafale power system close to achieving the \ngoal of 100% renewable energy penetration. \n \n22. \nTo ensure technical and financial sustainability, the project will also incorporate lessons \nlearnt from previous solar projects in its design and specifications, including on ensuring structural \nintegrity  and  resilience  of  roofs  and  foundations,  and  early  community  engagement. 15 It  will \ninclude support for consulting services for project management and for construction supervision. \nIt will also (i) include a comprehensive and inclusive institutional capacity development program \ncovering technical aspects (photovoltaic and BESS design, construction, testing, commissioning, \noperation,  and  maintenance),  financial  and  economic  analyses,  financial  management, \nenvironmental and social safeguards, gender, community engagement, procurement, tariff, and \ngovernance; and (ii) use various methods and modalities such as workshops, lectures, hands-on \ntraining, certified training, and academic degree scholarships, with special focus on gender and \ninclusion.  \n \nB. \n \nThe project  provides  reliable  and sustainable  electricity  supply  in  locations  where even \n23. \nmarginal changes in the costs of essential services have a severe impact on the viability of the \naffected communities. Solar power will displace diesel generation, which is difficult to maintain \nand  operate  sustainably,  emits  greenhouse  gases,  and  is  subject  to  wide  price  swings  from \noverseas markets. Capital costs of the project include the base cost, covering civil and electrical \nworks, equipment, logistics, and transport and physical contingencies. Cost of asset replacements \nfor inverters, BESS cells, photovoltaic arrays, and backup diesel generators were included. The \nFunafuti BESS accounts for a large portion of the cost ($2.3 million, excluding contingencies) and \nby itself does not produce energy, but rather enables renewable energy to be utilized. The BESS \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \n\n15 This  includes  projects  funded  by  the  European  Union,  Japan,  the  United  Arab  Emirates  and  the  World  Bank. \nCyclones, storm surges and rising sea levels caused leaks on rooftops with solar panels and flooded powerhouses. \nAlso, in land-constrained Tuvalu, social safeguards issues caused delays in processing and implementation.  Early \nand constant consultation with the community and landowners ensured acceptance and timely project processing.    \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\n7F\n\n4F\n\n8F\n\n5F\n\n6F\n\n18  and  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects. 1\n\ncan support a further 3.2 MW of solar photovoltaic capacity and for the purpose of the  project \nfinancial and economic analyses it is assumed that the renewable energy connectivity potential \nof the BESS is fully utilized.16 The diesel savings have been priced using the average fuel price \nat the TEC and projected in step with the World Bank Commodity Price Forecast for crude oil in \n17 The economic analysis adopted a cost\u2013benefit analysis for the four subprojects \nconstant prices.1\n19  The \ncombined1\nguidelines specify the greenhouse gas emission value as $36.3 per ton of CO2e in 2016 prices, \nincreasing by 2% in real terms annually (i.e., equivalent to $38.54 per ton in 2019, and increasing \nby  2%  every  year  thereafter).  Under  the  above  estimated  costs,  system  performance,  and \nquantified benefits, the economic internal rate of return of the combined project is 9%, which is \n20 and  is  robust  to  reasonable  adverse  variations  in  the  key  cost  and \nabove  the  6%  threshold,1\nbenefit  parameters.  Financial  analysis  was  conducted  following  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Management \n21 The project has a positive financial internal rate of return of \nand Analysis of Projects guidelines. 1\n6.9% but is below the 7.1% weighted average cost of capital. However, each year the project\u2019s \nfuel  cost  saving  benefits  outweigh  the  incremental  operation  and  maintenance  costs  and, \ntherefore, the project is financially sustainable. \n \n24. \nA financial performance analysis of the TEC was conducted, and it was determined that \nthe tariff has remained unchanged for several years and that TEC faces a severe cash flow crisis \nwith mounting arrears from customers. The government agrees to (i) make continuous efforts to \nincrease tariffs progressively to achieve full cost recovery and in accordance with national tariff \npolicies  and  regulations;  (ii)  undertake  a  periodic  gender-sensitive  review  of  tariffs  and  fees, \nincluding  an  assessment  of  their  impact  on  low-income  households;  and  (iii)  initiate  an \nimplementation plan to achieve inclusive, gender-responsive, cost-recovery tariffs. \n \nC. \n \n22 Country-level  risks \n25. \nhave been  assessed moderate  and relate  to those associated  with  a  very  small  economy  and \ngovernment, such as recruiting and retaining qualified and experienced staff, and segregation of \nduties to facilitate effective internal control. Entity-specific risk is assessed high because the TEC \nhas no previous experience with ADB, and project-specific risks are assessed low because it is a \nturnkey project. The integrity due diligence conducted on the TEC assessed it as low risk. The \noverall  inherent  risk  rating  is  moderate.  The  overall  control  risk  has  been  assessed  moderate \nalthough, in the following areas, the control risk is assessed high because of (i) lack of an internal \naudit  function  at  the  TEC,  and  (ii)  incorrect  adoption  of  International  Financial  Reporting \nStandards in relation to accounting for government grants and impairment of assets. The project \nwill  address  these  high-risk  areas  as  follows:  (i)  the  government  agreeing  to  prioritize  the \npreparation and implementation of an internal audit program for the TEC through the utilization of \nthe  central  internal  audit  unit,  and  (ii)  the  TEC  initiating  the  process  of  restating  its  financial \nstatements  with the  agreement of  its  external  auditor.

Detailed internal control and risk assessments and the financial management action plan \nhave been prepared and are detailed in the PAM (footnote 14). \n \n26. \nProcurement capacity. ADB completed a project procurement risk assessment, noting \nthat the TEC will require external support to mitigate the procurement-related risks to the project \n(PAM,  section  VI).  Through  support  by  the  already  engaged  TA  consultant  (footnote  4),  direct \nADB assistance to consultant recruitment (via joint recruitment) and the engagement of additional \nconsultants  (individuals  and  firm)  at  the  implementation stage,  procurement  risk  related  to the \nproject is substantially mitigated. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government, the MOF, MTET, and TEC. The PAM describes \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures (footnote 14). \n \nD. \n \n27. \nThe project will add additional small-scale solar photovoltaic and battery infrastructure that \nwill increase renewable energy contribution and displace more diesel fuel and, as a result, help \nto reduce and stabilize generation costs. The gender-sensitive tariff review being conducted under \nADB\u2019s  TA  has  a  two-pronged  objective  of  ensuring  full  cost  recovery  of  TEC  operations  with \nprovisions for asset replacement and arriving at a more equitable subsidy distribution which will \nbenefit low-income consumers, including vulnerable groups. A more sustainable and equitable \npower supply will not only benefit the entire population but will also contribute to narrowing the \ngap  between  poor  people  and  the  rest  of  the  population.  Women  will  be  among  the  key \nbeneficiaries as they are the main energy consumers at the household level through cooking and \ncleaning activities. They can also maximize power use for productive income-generating activities \nthrough the use of skills gained from the project\u2019s capacity building events. \n \nThe project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. A gender action plan has \n28. \n23 Design features and targets include (i) arranging stakeholder consultations to \nbeen prepared.2\nachieve 50% participation of women overall; (ii) if local workers are hired, having a target of at \nleast  25%  female  local  workers  overall  for  construction,  administration,  maintenance,  security, \nand supervision; (iii) developing and implementing formal TEC human resource gender policies, \nincluding equal pay for equal work between men and women by the end of 2020; (iv) funding and \nawarding in 2020 two academic and/or training scholarships of up to 2 years each for two Tuvalu \nwomen and then hiring them on graduation to technical positions in the TEC; (v) developing a \nhousehold electricity demand management public awareness program; (vi) training women and \nmen  on  business  skills  and  carrying  out  the  program  nationally,  beginning  in  Funafuti,  with \npresenters, 50% of whom are female, trained to present courses to outer islands; (vii) ensuring a \ngender-sensitive  tariff  review  of  residential  accounts  with  analysis  and  recommendations  on \nsubsidies and tariffs to support low-income households, including households headed by women; \nand (viii) initiating the implementation plan of the inclusive, gender-responsive, cost-recovery tariff \nreview recommendations. \n \nE. \n \n29. \nEnvironment.  The  project  has  been  screened  and  categorized  B  for  environment \nbecause  the  impacts  will  largely  be  site  specific,  with  a  small  footprint  generated  during  the \n\nSafeguards \n\n0F\n\n23 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\n1F\n\n24 \n\nconstruction stage and for which mitigation measures can be readily designed and implemented. \nThe environmental assessment has been prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009) and will be updated, following detailed design, to also comply with the laws and \nregulations  of  Tuvalu.  The  potential  impacts  include  earthworks  and  site  preparations,  limited \nvegetation removal, dust and noise generation, import and haulage of equipment and materials, \npresence of foreign workers, and health and safety risks. To manage and mitigate impacts during \noperation,  the  TEC  will  implement measures  identified in the  environmental  management  plan \ncovering correct disposal of used equipment such as batteries and inverters. Adequate mitigation \nmeasures have been incorporated into the environmental management plan. The climate change \nassessment conducted will inform the design and technical specifications.2\n \n30. \nInvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The project is classified category C \nfor involuntary resettlement, with no land acquisition required. Project impacts will also not cause \nany  physical  or  economic  displacement.  For  subprojects  in  the  outer  islands,  the  sites  in \nNukulaelae and Nukufetau will utilize land under an existing lease with the TEC, with the site in \nNui requiring an extension of the site under an existing lease agreement and an amendment of \nthe lease with the local town council to include some near-shore tidal flat area. On Funafuti, the \nproject will install additional solar photovoltaic equipment on government building rooftops and \ninstall BESS capacity in the existing TEC compound, both subject to an agreed memorandum of \nunderstanding  between  the  Funafuti  Native  Lands  Trust  Board  and  the  government.  A  due \ndiligence report has been prepared and will be updated after detailed design and before award of \n25 The project is classified category C for indigenous peoples according to \nthe turnkey contract.2\nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  No  distinct  and  vulnerable  indigenous  peoples  will  be \naffected, and all project activities will be implemented in a culturally appropriate and participatory \nmanner. \n \nF. \n \nNo  significant  issues  are  expected  to  arise  in  implementing  the  project.
