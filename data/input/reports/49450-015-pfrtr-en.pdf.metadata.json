BACKGROUND \n \n1.  On 22 June 2017, the Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved \nthe Pacific Renewable Energy Investment Facility.1 The facility will finance renewable energy \n0F\nprojects in the 11 smallest Pacific island developing member countries (DMCs).2 It has an overall \n1F\nestimated cost of $750 million, including ADB financing of up to $200 million. Upon approval, the \nBoard delegated authority to the President to approve loans and/or grants to each targeted \ncountry for qualifying projects. \n \n2.  The facility will finance a grant to Tuvalu for the Increasing Access to Renewable Energy \nProject. The project will help the Government of Tuvalu expand access to modern energy \nservices; improve the quality, reliability, and climate resilience of service; reduce reliance on fossil \nfuels for power generation; and reduce the cost of generation. The project will decrease the cost \nof supply by partially replacing diesel power with solar power. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Country background. Tuvalu is a Polynesian country in the Pacific region, about 1,200 \nkilometers (km) north of Fiji. The country has a total land area of 26 square km and an exclusive \neconomic zone of 900,000 square km. It is composed of nine atolls and islands, of which Funafuti \nis the most populated. It is extremely remote from all markets and most resources. Like many \nother small Pacific islands, Tuvalu\u2019s electricity production relies heavily on imported diesel fuel, \ntransported over long distances across the ocean and subject to climate change\u2013related supply \ndisruptions. As of September 2017, more than 72% of electricity in Tuvalu was diesel generated. \nThis heightened climate change and energy security problems and caused high per capita \ngreenhouse gas emissions.3 Tuvalu has about 16% renewable energy generation with 98% of \n2F\nhouseholds having access to electricity. The focus of the government is to increase the renewable \nenergy penetration on the outer islands to 100%, to be followed by Funafuti. About 7%\u201310% of \ngross domestic product (GDP) is spent on imported fuel (depending on oil prices), making energy \nthe costliest sector of the Tuvalu economy. \n \n4.  The vision of Tuvalu\u2019s eighth national development plan, Te Kakeega III: National Strategy \nfor Sustainable Development 2016\u20132020, foresees a more protected, secure, and prosperous \nTuvalu; healthier people who are more engaged in national, regional, and international forums; \nand a government that encourages community input to improve project development, such that \ndevelopment efforts are sustained and adopted by the community. \n \n5.  Limited renewable electricity access and reliance on diesel. The state-owned Tuvalu \nElectricity Corporation (TEC) is tasked to provide and maintain a safe, secure, stable, financially \nviable, and economically sound power supply. The power systems on Tuvalu\u2019s outer islands of \nNukulaelae, Nukufetau, and Nui were transformed from diesel\u2013powered systems offering 12\u201316 \nhours/day of power supply into hybrid solar\u2013battery\u2013diesel systems in 2015 offering continuous \n \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2017. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: \nProposed Pacific Renewable Energy Investment Facility. Manila. The facility streamlines ADB\u2019s procedures, \nincluding single source selection of engaged consultants to prepare other ensuing projects under the facility \n2 The Cook Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, Solomon \nIslands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. \n3  Government of Tuvalu. 2015. Intended Nationally Determined Contributions. Funafuti (communicated to the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change [UNFCCC]). \n ", "2 \npower supply, through funding from the European Union. The systems have been achieving 60%\u2013\n70% annual renewable energy contribution, still below the 100% government target. However, \nthree northern islands have reached around 90% through funding from the Government of New \nZealand. \n \n6.  The existing Fongafale power system on the main island of Funafuti in 2019 consists of \nthree  600-kilowatt  (kW)  diesel  generators,  735  kilowatt-peak  (kWp)  of  solar  photovoltaic \ngeneration capacity, and a further 82 kWp solar capacity that is nonoperational. The peak load \nobserved is about 1,360 kW. The system has a fuel saver control system installed that applies an \neffective limit on solar output of 415 kW. The combination of this limit and inadequate redundancy \nin the system results in diesel generation remaining the main source of electricity production. \nBased  on  energy  balance  modeling,  the  existing  system  would  have  a  renewable  energy \ncontribution of only 15% in 2020, and averages 10% over a 25-year period from 2020. The draft \nroad map developed under ADB\u2019s technical assistance (TA)4 found that to achieve a 100% \n3F\nrenewable contribution for Funafuti by 2025 would require 7.6 megawatts (MW) of photovoltaic \ncapacity and 3 MW and 14 megawatt-hours (MWh) of a battery energy storage system (BESS), \nrequiring investments of more than $24 million.5 \n4F\n  \n7.  Volatile revenue base and vulnerable fiscal sustainability. Tuvalu is a micro economy \nin the Pacific, remote from major markets with a narrow production base and with growth mainly \ndriven by public expenditure. In the energy sector, the government intends to reduce the country\u2019s \nreliance on overseas fuel markets. Tuvalu\u2019s economic performance has picked up on the back of \nseveral large infrastructure projects and stimulus from high public expenditure. It is estimated that \nreal GDP growth accelerated to 4.3% in 2018 (from 3.2% in 2017) and a slight fall to 4.1% is \nprojected for 2019. The Tuvalu economy is highly vulnerable to external shocks and heavily \ndependent on external sources of revenue (fishing license fees and foreign aid) and imported \nfood and fuel. The public sector dominates the economy. For 2019, the government estimates a \n$1.3 million negative fiscal balance versus a $14.0 million fiscal surplus in 2018 (as a result of \na more than 50% increase in actual receipts of fishing license revenues). External debt is 22% \nas a percentage of GDP, which is within sustainable levels. \n \n8.  Vulnerability  to  climate  change.  Like  many  other  small  island  developing  states, \nespecially in the Pacific, Tuvalu is highly vulnerable to external economic shocks and climate \nchange. Climate change cuts across all 12 priority areas of Te Kakeega III, as sea-level rise poses \nthe most significant threat to Tuvalu\u2019s survival. Climate change and extreme weather events\u2014\nsuch as increased temperatures; reduced solar radiation; and increased frequency and intensity \nof  rainfall  and  cyclones,  storm  surges,  and  tsunamis\u2014pose  additional  threats  to  energy \ninfrastructure  sustainability.  Climate  change  impacts  will  worsen  existing  development \nchallenges such as deterioration of infrastructure, water shortages, rise in noncommunicable \ndiseases, population pressures on limited resources, and fuel and food supply disruptions. \n \n9.  Proposed solutions. The project, ADB\u2019s first in Tuvalu\u2019s energy sector, will help the \ngovernment (i) transform the Funafuti and outer island power systems from manual, diesel-based \npower systems into modern, automated, power systems based on a high level of renewable \nenergy; improve the quality, reliability, and climate resilience of service; reduce reliance on \nimported fuels for power generation; and reduce the cost of generation by partially replacing diesel \n \n4  ADB. 2016.

Alignment of development plans. Tuvalu\u2019s 2009 National Energy Policy set a national \ntarget of 100% renewable energy for power generation by 2025. The policy is also detailed in the \nEnetise Tutumau 2012\u20132020 Master Plan for Renewable Electricity and Energy Efficiency in \nTuvalu and in Te Kaniva 2012 (Climate Change Policy) and is supported by Te Kakeega III: \nNational Strategy for Sustainable Development 2016\u20132020. Tuvalu\u2019s Infrastructure Strategy and \nInvestment Plan 2016\u20132025 prioritizes A$213 million of investments in maritime transportation, \ninformation and communication technology, and renewable energy. \n \n11.  The  project  aligns  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030 operational  priorities  of  (i)  addressing \nremaining poverty and reducing inequalities in poor island communities; (ii) accelerating progress \nin gender equality; and (iii) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and \nenhancing environmental sustainability.7 The project is in line with the objectives of ADB\u2019s 2009 \n6F\nEnergy Policy,8 and with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. The project is \n7F\nconsistent with ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach 2016\u20132020,9 under which ADB\u2019s infrastructure program \n8F\nwill harness renewable energy to drive down the cost of electricity, reduce risks, and reduce fossil \nfuel imports. The project is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for the 11 smallest \nPacific island DMCs for 2019\u20132021.10 \n9F\n \n12.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n20.  Due diligence and modeling found that the optimum solution to achieve the goal of more \nthan 90% renewable energy contribution in the three outer islands is to increase the solar \nphotovoltaic capacity installed on each island without increasing the existing battery capacity. \n \n13  Formerly the Ministry of Public Utilities and Infrastructure prior to reorganization in September 2019. \n14  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "6 \nClimate-resilient designs will be used for all island systems, including raised foundations for the \nnew powerhouse in Nukulaelae. The old powerhouse was flooded during Cyclone Pam. \n \n21.  On Funafuti, however, there is little benefit in adding further solar photovoltaic capacity to \nthe  existing  power  system  without  providing  technology  that  can  remove  the  solar  output \nconstraint. This is a key benefit of installing a BESS as this will remove that constraint, and in the \nearly years will even allow short periods where the diesel generators could be turned off (zero \ndiesel operation). With the proposed addition of 500 kW of rooftop photovoltaic capacity and a \n1.0 MW, 2.0 MWh BESS, the renewable energy contribution in Funafuti is modeled to increase \nfrom 15% to 32% in 2020, and average 21% over the 25-year period from 2020. Replacement of \nthe diesel generators will be required multiple times over the 25-year period, and the addition of \na fourth and then fifth diesel generator will also be required to service forecast increases in \nelectricity demand. By sizing the BESS larger than is currently required by the amount of solar \nphotovoltaic capacity in the system, the power system will be set up to optimally install a further \n3.2 MW of solar photovoltaic capacity. When this capacity is added to the power system, the \nrenewable energy contribution on Funafuti is modeled to increase to 58% in the first year of \ninstallation (nominally 2023), and average 50% over the 25-year period from 2020. The addition \nof such solar capacity is likely to see the deferral of diesel generator replacement and reduce the \nneed for additional diesel generators. A further stage of development in 2025 with the addition of \nmore solar and BESS capacity would move the Fongafale power system close to achieving the \ngoal of 100% renewable energy penetration. \n \n22.  To ensure technical and financial sustainability, the project will also incorporate lessons \nlearnt from previous solar projects in its design and specifications, including on ensuring structural \nintegrity and resilience of roofs and foundations, and early community engagement.15 It will \ninclude support for consulting services for project management and for construction supervision. \nIt will also (i) include a comprehensive and inclusive institutional capacity development program \ncovering technical aspects (photovoltaic and BESS design, construction, testing, commissioning, \noperation,  and  maintenance),  financial  and  economic  analyses,  financial  management, \nenvironmental and social safeguards, gender, community engagement, procurement, tariff, and \ngovernance; and (ii) use various methods and modalities such as workshops, lectures, hands-on \ntraining, certified training, and academic degree scholarships, with special focus on gender and \ninclusion.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n23.  The project provides reliable and sustainable electricity supply in locations where even \nmarginal changes in the costs of essential services have a severe impact on the viability of the \naffected communities. Solar power will displace diesel generation, which is difficult to maintain \nand operate sustainably, emits greenhouse gases, and is subject to wide price swings from \noverseas markets. Capital costs of the project include the base cost, covering civil and electrical \nworks, equipment, logistics, and transport and physical contingencies. Cost of asset replacements \nfor inverters, BESS cells, photovoltaic arrays, and backup diesel generators were included. The \nFunafuti BESS accounts for a large portion of the cost ($2.3 million, excluding contingencies) and \nby itself does not produce energy, but rather enables renewable energy to be utilized. The BESS \n \n15 This includes projects funded by the European Union, Japan, the United Arab Emirates and the World Bank. \nCyclones, storm surges and rising sea levels caused leaks on rooftops with solar panels and flooded powerhouses. \nAlso, in land-constrained Tuvalu, social safeguards issues caused delays in processing and implementation. Early \nand constant consultation with the community and landowners ensured acceptance and timely project processing.    \n ", "7 \ncan support a further 3.2 MW of solar photovoltaic capacity and for the purpose of the project \nfinancial and economic analyses it is assumed that the renewable energy connectivity potential \nof the BESS is fully utilized.16 The diesel savings have been priced using the average fuel price \nat the TEC and projected in step with the World Bank Commodity Price Forecast for crude oil in \nconstant prices.17 The economic analysis adopted a cost\u2013benefit analysis for the four subprojects \n14F\ncombined18 and  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects.19 The \n15F 16F\nguidelines specify the greenhouse gas emission value as $36.3 per ton of CO e in 2016 prices, \n2\nincreasing by 2% in real terms annually (i.e., equivalent to $38.54 per ton in 2019, and increasing \nby 2% every year thereafter). Under the above estimated costs, system performance, and \nquantified benefits, the economic internal rate of return of the combined project is 9%, which is \nabove the 6% threshold,20 and is robust to reasonable adverse variations in the key cost and \n17F\nbenefit parameters. Financial analysis was conducted following ADB\u2019s Financial Management \nand Analysis of Projects guidelines.21 The project has a positive financial internal rate of return of \n18F\n6.9% but is below the 7.1% weighted average cost of capital. However, each year the project\u2019s \nfuel  cost  saving  benefits  outweigh  the  incremental  operation  and  maintenance  costs  and, \ntherefore, the project is financially sustainable. \n \n24.  A financial performance analysis of the TEC was conducted, and it was determined that \nthe tariff has remained unchanged for several years and that TEC faces a severe cash flow crisis \nwith mounting arrears from customers. The government agrees to (i) make continuous efforts to \nincrease tariffs progressively to achieve full cost recovery and in accordance with national tariff \npolicies and regulations; (ii) undertake a periodic gender-sensitive review of tariffs and fees, \nincluding  an  assessment  of  their  impact  on  low-income  households;  and  (iii)  initiate  an \nimplementation plan to achieve inclusive, gender-responsive, cost-recovery tariffs. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n25.  A financial management assessment was conducted for the TEC.22 Country-level risks \n19F\nhave been assessed moderate and relate to those associated with a very small economy and \ngovernment, such as recruiting and retaining qualified and experienced staff, and segregation of \nduties to facilitate effective internal control. Entity-specific risk is assessed high because the TEC \nhas no previous experience with ADB, and project-specific risks are assessed low because it is a \nturnkey project. The integrity due diligence conducted on the TEC assessed it as low risk. The \noverall inherent risk rating is moderate. The overall control risk has been assessed moderate \nalthough, in the following areas, the control risk is assessed high because of (i) lack of an internal \naudit  function  at  the  TEC,  and  (ii)  incorrect  adoption  of  International  Financial  Reporting \nStandards in relation to accounting for government grants and impairment of assets. The project \nwill address these high-risk areas  as follows: (i) the government agreeing to prioritize the \npreparation and implementation of an internal audit program for the TEC through the utilization of \nthe central internal audit unit, and (ii) the TEC initiating the process of restating its financial \nstatements with the agreement of its external auditor. Although TEC staff are not familiar with \n \n16  Government has sought and ADB is exploring financing for this additional solar capacity by 2023. Cofinancing from \nthe Global Environment Facility and the Government of Australia are being considered. \n17  World Bank Commodity Price Forecast, 29, October 2018. \n18  The combined approach is justified since benefits are for the entire country to help achieve the 100% national target. \n19  ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/ \ninstitutional-document/32256/economic-analysis-projects.pdf \n20  The social discount rate of 6.0% is justified since the project serves remote communities on poor, remote islands; \n26.3% of the population lives below the poverty line; and 46.7% of the population lives on $5.50 or less per capita \nper day. \n21  ADB. 2005.

", "8 \nADB  accounting  and  disbursement  procedures,  the  government  agrees  to  use  in-country \nexperience through the Outer Island Maritime Infrastructure Project (funded by ADB and the \nWorld Bank) project management unit and the ADB-assisted Central Procurement Unit of the \nMOF. Detailed internal control and risk assessments and the financial management action plan \nhave been prepared and are detailed in the PAM (footnote 14). \n \n26.  Procurement capacity. ADB completed a project procurement risk assessment, noting \nthat the TEC will require external support to mitigate the procurement-related risks to the project \n(PAM, section VI). Through support by the already engaged TA consultant (footnote 4), direct \nADB assistance to consultant recruitment (via joint recruitment) and the engagement of additional \nconsultants (individuals and firm) at the implementation stage, procurement risk related to the \nproject is substantially mitigated. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government, the MOF, MTET, and TEC. The PAM describes \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures (footnote 14). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n27.  The project will add additional small-scale solar photovoltaic and battery infrastructure that \nwill increase renewable energy contribution and displace more diesel fuel and, as a result, help \nto reduce and stabilize generation costs. The gender-sensitive tariff review being conducted under \nADB\u2019s TA has a two-pronged objective of ensuring full cost recovery of TEC operations with \nprovisions for asset replacement and arriving at a more equitable subsidy distribution which will \nbenefit low-income consumers, including vulnerable groups. A more sustainable and equitable \npower supply will not only benefit the entire population but will also contribute to narrowing the \ngap  between  poor  people  and  the rest  of the  population.  Women  will  be  among  the  key \nbeneficiaries as they are the main energy consumers at the household level through cooking and \ncleaning activities. They can also maximize power use for productive income-generating activities \nthrough the use of skills gained from the project\u2019s capacity building events. \n \n28.  The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. A gender action plan has \nbeen prepared.23 Design features and targets include (i) arranging stakeholder consultations to \n20F\nachieve 50% participation of women overall; (ii) if local workers are hired, having a target of at \nleast 25% female local workers overall for construction, administration, maintenance, security, \nand supervision; (iii) developing and implementing formal TEC human resource gender policies, \nincluding equal pay for equal work between men and women by the end of 2020; (iv) funding and \nawarding in 2020 two academic and/or training scholarships of up to 2 years each for two Tuvalu \nwomen and then hiring them on graduation to technical positions in the TEC; (v) developing a \nhousehold electricity demand management public awareness program; (vi) training women and \nmen on business skills and carrying out the program nationally, beginning in Funafuti, with \npresenters, 50% of whom are female, trained to present courses to outer islands; (vii) ensuring a \ngender-sensitive tariff review of residential accounts with analysis and recommendations on \nsubsidies and tariffs to support low-income households, including households headed by women; \nand (viii) initiating the implementation plan of the inclusive, gender-responsive, cost-recovery tariff \nreview recommendations. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n29.  Environment.  The  project  has  been  screened  and  categorized  B  for  environment \nbecause the impacts will largely be site specific, with a small footprint generated during the \n \n23 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) ", "9 \nconstruction stage and for which mitigation measures can be readily designed and implemented. \nThe environmental assessment has been prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009) and will be updated, following detailed design, to also comply with the laws and \nregulations of Tuvalu. The potential impacts include earthworks and site preparations, limited \nvegetation removal, dust and noise generation, import and haulage of equipment and materials, \npresence of foreign workers, and health and safety risks. To manage and mitigate impacts during \noperation, the TEC will implement measures identified in the environmental management plan \ncovering correct disposal of used equipment such as batteries and inverters. Adequate mitigation \nmeasures have been incorporated into the environmental management plan. The climate change \nassessment conducted will inform the design and technical specifications.24 \n21F\n \n30.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The project is classified category C \nfor involuntary resettlement, with no land acquisition required. Project impacts will also not cause \nany  physical  or  economic  displacement.  For  subprojects  in  the  outer  islands,  the  sites  in \nNukulaelae and Nukufetau will utilize land under an existing lease with the TEC, with the site in \nNui requiring an extension of the site under an existing lease agreement and an amendment of \nthe lease with the local town council to include some near-shore tidal flat area. On Funafuti, the \nproject will install additional solar photovoltaic equipment on government building rooftops and \ninstall BESS capacity in the existing TEC compound, both subject to an agreed memorandum of \nunderstanding between the Funafuti Native Lands Trust Board and the government. A due \ndiligence report has been prepared and will be updated after detailed design and before award of \nthe turnkey contract.25 The project is classified category C for indigenous peoples according to \n22F\nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  No  distinct  and  vulnerable  indigenous  peoples  will  be \naffected, and all project activities will be implemented in a culturally appropriate and participatory \nmanner. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n31.  No significant issues are expected to arise in implementing the project.
