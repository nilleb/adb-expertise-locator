For \n\nrefinancing  housing \n\nto  affordable  housing \n\nThe Socialist Republic of Viet Nam \n \nPoverty classification: Poverty intervention \nThematic: Human development \n \nCategory  C.  Environmental  implications  were  reviewed  and  no \nsignificant environmental impact was identified. \n \nThe  Project  will  support  the  establishment  of  a  sustainable \nhousing  finance  market  in  Viet  Nam,  which  would  ultimately \nmobilize  substantial  capital  for  housing  finance  and  facilitate  the \nlong-term  establishment  of  a  strong  mortgage-based  collateral \nmarket to provide housing loans to all sections of the population. \nThe loan will be used as a line of credit to the State Bank of Viet \nloans  originated  by \nNam \nparticipating financial institutions (PFIs) for urban low-income and \npoor  households  (ULIPHs)  through  a  newly  established  housing \nfinance  facility  (HFF).  The  Project  will  assist  approximately \n137,000  urban  low-income  and  poor  persons  improve  their \nhousing,  health  standards,  and  economic  well-being  by  giving \nthem  access \nthe  poor \nhouseholds that cannot afford to buy a new house, the Project will \nprovide market-based lending for housing improvement and own-\nbuild  options \ninstitutions \n(CFIs).  \n \nRapid  population  growth  and  rural-urban  migration  have  created \nserious problems in access to housing in the urban centers of Viet \nNam. Almost 40% of households in urban areas occupy a usable \nhousing  area  of  less  than  36  square  meters  (m2),  with  16%  of \nhouseholds occupying an area of less than 24 m2. The majority of \nthe population live in semipermanent houses. Only 26% of urban \nhouseholds  have  permanent  housing  types  and  20%  have \ntemporary,  unstable  structures.  The  problem  affects  particularly \nULIPHs  who  lack  access  to  affordable  options  to  finance  their \nhouse improvements or new housing in the absence of an efficient \nhousing finance system.  \n \nThe  lack  of  access  to  long-term  credit  funds  prevents  financial \ninstitutions from providing long-term loans for housing. The lack of \nlong-term loans makes access to housing finance unaffordable for \nalmost 65% of the urban population. Short-term loans require high \ndebt  service  repayment.  To  make  housing  loans  affordable  to \nULIPHs,  it  is  necessary  to  establish  an  efficient  housing  finance \nsystem  that  can  provide  long-term  financing  for  purchase  of \nhousing  and  financing  options  for  the  poor  to  upgrade  or  build \ntheir own house. \n \n \n\nthrough  community-based \n\nfinancial \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nObjectives  \n\n \n\nThe development of an efficient housing mortgage market in Viet \nNam  requires  the  establishment  of  a  HFF  that  will  refinance \nhousing  loans  originated  by  qualified  PFIs.  HFF  will  be  initially \nestablished within SBV and would become the apex institution for \nhousing finance in Viet Nam. In the long term, HFF will become an \nindependent mortgage refinance agency (MRA) that would act as \na conduit to attract additional funds to the sector through the issue \nof bonds or securities. All loans to PFIs will be channeled through \nHFF,  which  will  act  as  a  refinance  facility  (revolving  fund)  in \ncharge of disbursement to the PFIs and repayments on a regular \nbasis.  The  establishment  of  a  HFF  is  justified  to  (i)  promote \ncommon  standards,  procedures,  documentation,  and  good \npractices  among  PFIs  for  the  development  of  an  efficient  and \ntransparent  primary  mortgage  market  accessible  to  ULIPHs;  and \n(ii) build up basic requirements for the emergence of a secondary \nmortgage  market.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  loan  is \nneeded to (i) provide initial resources to HFF to start its operations \non a pilot basis; and (ii) provide capacity-building activities for HFF \nand PFIs, with the objective of developing human resources in the \nnational  housing  finance  sector.  The  establishment  of  HFF  will \nprovide an opportunity to test mechanisms for loan disbursement \nto ULIPH, and act as a catalyst to facilitate the progress of policy \nand legal reforms in the sector.  \n \nADB\u2018s involvement in housing finance is justified to (i) develop the \ninstitutional  and  policy  framework  for  a  housing  finance  system \nthat  integrates  housing  and  finance  issues;  (ii) make  housing \nloans  affordable  to  ULIPHs  and  so  reduce  poverty  and  enhance \nthe  quality  of  their  life;  and  (iii)  create  employment  and  business \nopportunities in the construction, and banking sectors. \n \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  goal  is  to  improve  the  quality  of  life  for  ULIPHs \nthrough improved housing. The specific objective of the Project is \nto  promote  the  establishment  in  Viet  Nam  of  a  sustainable \nhousing  finance  market  accessible  to  ULIPHs.  The  Project  will \nprovide  approximately  27,500  housing  finance  loans  for  over \n137,000  people,  disbursed  through  PFIs,  in  the  first  round  of \nlending. The  Project  consists  of  three  parts:  (i) mortgage  lending \nto urban low-income households through participating commercial \nbanks (PCBs), (ii) housing microfinance to urban poor households \nthrough  CFIs,  and  (iii)  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity \nbuilding. The Project will support the establishment of a HFF that \nwill  become  the  apex  institution  for  the  housing  finance  sector, \nand the implementation of a policy and institutional reform action \nplan  that  will  facilitate  the  development  of  the  housing  finance \nsystem.   \n \n \n\n\fCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n  v\n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $51.8  million \nequivalent,  including  all  the  investments  in  new  and  improved \nhousing  expected  to  be  generated  through  the  catalytic  effect  of \nthe  ADB-financed  subloans.  The  cost  estimates  assume  that  the \nULIPHs receiving housing loans through the Project will invest an \namount  equal  to  at  least  30%  of  the  value  of  the  total  housing \nexpenditure. This beneficiary contribution is conservative and was \nbased  on  information  from  commercial  banks  currently  providing \nhousing  loans  and  on  results  of  household  surveys  and  focus \ngroup discussions conducted during project preparation.  \n \nIt is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $30 million equivalent to \nfinance about 57.9% of the total project cost. ADB will finance the \nentire  foreign  exchange  cost  of  $8.5  million  and  $21.5  million \nequivalent (49.7%) of the local currency cost. The balance will be \nborne  by  the  PFIs  and  the  Government  as  well  as  by  the \nbeneficiary  households  from  their  own  resources.  The  PFIs \ncontribution  represents  12.3%  of  the  total  project  cost.  This \ncontribution is regarded as important, as it means the PFIs share \nsome  of  the  risks  associated  with  lending  to  the  target  group. \nBeneficiaries  will  contribute  some  28.8%  of  the  project  cost.  The \ngovernment  contribution  arises  from  incremental  administration \ncosts associated with project management and operation of HFF. \n \n\n         ($ million) \n\nLocal \n\n \n\nCurrency  Total Cost \n\n \nSource \n  \nADB \nPFIs \nGovernment \nBeneficiaries \nTotal \n\nForeign \nExchange\n \n\n8.5 \n\n \n \n \n\n8.5 \n\n \n21.5 \n6.4 \n0.5 \n14.9 \n43.3 \n\n \n30.0 \n6.4 \n0.5 \n14.9 \n51.8 \n\nPercent \n  \n57.9 \n12.3 \n1.0 \n28.8 \n100.0 \n\n  ADB = Asian Development Bank, PFIs = participating financial institutions. \n \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  The  equivalent  of  SDR22.438  million  ($30.0  million)  will  be \nprovided  in  various  currencies  from the  Special  Funds  resources \nof  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  for  a  term  of  32  years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, and with an interest charge at \nthe rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter.  \n \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement \n\n \n\nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  enter  into  a  financing \nagreement  with  SBV  with  a  loan  term  of  20  years  and  a  grace \nperiod of 5 years. Funds will flow from MOF to HFF established in \nSBV  in  dong,  which  will  be  the  currency  for  all  subsequent  fund \nflows.  The  funds  for  the  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity \nbuilding  component  will  be  provided  by  MOF  to  HFF  as  a  grant. \nEach PFI will sign a housing finance credit (HFC) loan agreement \nwith  HFF.  HFF  will  refinance  loans from  PFIs  at  a  reference rate \ndefined  as  the  weighted  average  of  all  time  deposits  in  the \nbanking system of Viet Nam. HFF will have a fixed management \nfee for handling the housing loan funds, agreed at 1% annually on \nthe outstanding subloans and payable quarterly from PFI subloan \nrepayments to HFF. MOF will bear the foreign exchange risk from \nthe remaining interest payments from PFIs to HFF, after deducting \nof  the  HFF  management  fee.  PFIs  will  be  free  to  set  the  onlend \ninterest  rate  to  the  final  subborrower.  PFIs  will  be  required  to \nprovide  from  their  own  resources  capital  equal  to  20%  of  all \nsubloans  to  borrowers  from  PCBs  and  10%  of  all  subloans  to \nborrowers from CFIs.  \n \nUntil June 2008 \n \n31 December 2007 \n\n \nA project steering committee (PSC) will be established to oversee \noverall  project  implementation.  The  PSC,  to  be  chaired  by  a \ndeputy  governor  of  SBV,  will  consist  of  representatives  from  the \nMinistry  of  Construction,  MOF,  Ministry  of  Planning  and \nInvestment,  Ministry  of  Natural  Resources  and Environment,  and \nMinistry of Justice. The PSC will meet at least quarterly to review \nthe progress of the Project. These arrangements are expected to \nestablish  more  effective  links  between  government  agencies  for \ndeveloping  the  housing  finance  system  and  implementing  the \npolicy  and  institutional  reform  action  plan.  A  housing  finance \nconsultative  group  (HFCG)  will  assist  HFF  in  coordinating  the \nProject. Members of the HFCG will initially be HFF and the PFIs.  \n \n \nState Bank of Viet Nam \n \nGoods  and  works  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n\n\fConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n  vii\n\nA  total  of  38  person-months  of  international  and  26  person-\nmonths  of  domestic  consulting  services  will  support  capacity \nbuilding  and  project  implementation.  HFF  will  select  and  engage \nall consultants in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants and other arrangements acceptable to ADB for \nselecting  and  engaging  domestic  consultants.  Consultants  will \nguide on-the job training to HFF officials involved in implementing \nthe Project. \n \nULIPHs  will  improve  their  houses  with  the  available  affordable \nlong-term  funding.  It  will  (i)  reduce  their  vulnerability  to  natural \ndisasters  by  providing  a  safer  space  to  live,  (ii)  increase  the \nresidential  and  household  stability  due  to  the  possession  of  a \nvaluable  asset,  (iii) provide  an  alternative  source  of  income  in \nemergencies  when  the  house  is  used  as  collateral  to  obtain \nadditional credit, and (iv) reduce rent costs. Improved housing will \ncreate  a  healthier  environment,  particularly  for  women,  children, \nand  students  who  spend  much  of  their  time  in  the  house.  The \nhealth  of  family  members  and  the  education  performance  of \nstudents will in turn improve. Work productivity can also increase \nfor those households that use their own house as their workplace, \nas is common in Viet Nam. \n \nThe project beneficiaries will be ULIPHs willing to take loans from \nPFIs for purchasing, constructing, or improving their houses, and \nwith the capacity to repay subloans by installments. Approximately \n32% of the total project beneficiaries are expected to be poor. The \nProject will benefit more than 137,000 urban low-income and poor \npersons  including  about  44,000  urban  poor.  Under  the  Project, \nPFIs will refinance housing and house upgrading loans to ULIPHs \nwith  monthly  incomes  of  D0.35  millon-3.5  million  ($20-233 \nequivalent). The PCBs will focus on urban low-income households \n(ULIHs)  in  the  D0.75  million-3.5  million  ($50-233  equivalent) \nmonthly household income range who can afford to finance a new \nor  existing  housing  unit  at  a  cost  of  D100  million  ($6,666 \nequivalent) at 70% financing or could upgrade housing for a cost \nup to D20 million ($1,333 equivalent), at commercial interest rates \nand  a  maturity  of  up  to  20  years.  The  CFIs  will  focus  on  urban \npoor households (UPHs) under the poverty line in the D350,000\u2013\n750,000  ($23-50  equivalent)  monthly  income  range.  Affordable \noptions for the poor consist of (i) a building materials loan for self-\nhelp housing, and, (ii) smaller housing improvement for a cost up \nto D15 million ($1,000 equivalent) at commercial interest rates but \nat maturities of 5\u201310 years. \n \n\n\fviii \n\n \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\nfrom  PFIs;  (iv)  HFF\u2019s \n\nrisks  associated  with  project \n\nimplementation  and \nSeveral \nsustainability  were \nidentified  and  assessed  during  project \npreparation: (i) the leakage of project subloans to income groups \nabove the target ULIPHs; (ii) PFI unwillingness to lend to ULIPHs \nbecause  they  are  considered  risky;  (iii)  ULIPHs\u2019  unwillingness  to \nborrow \ninefficient  management  and \nmonitoring  systems;  (v)  ULIPHs\u2019  nonrepayment  of  the  subloans \nfrom  PFIs;  (vi)  PFIs  nonrepayment  of  the  loans  from;  (vii)  slow \nissue  of  land  use  rights  certificates  (LURCs);  and  (viii)  slow \nimplementation  of  the  policy  and  institutional  action  plan.  Each \nrisk  was  carefully  assessed,  taking  due  account  of  past  lessons \nfrom  similar  projects  in  developing  countries,  and  risk  mitigation \nimplementation \nmeasures \nprocedures. \n \n\nidentified  and  built \n\ninto  project \n\n\f \n\n \n1. \nthe Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Housing Finance Project. \n\nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed  loan  to \n\nI.  \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n\nII.  \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \nThe urban population in Viet Nam has increased by about 6 million over the last 10 years at \n2. \nan  average  annual  increase  of  3.8%.  By  2000  the  urban  population  had  reached  19  million  and \naccounted for 23% of the total population. The Government estimates that the rate of urbanization \nwill increase to 45% of the population, with 46 million people living in urban areas by 2020. With the \ngrowing  pressure  on  urban  land  due  to  population  growth  and  rural-urban  migration,  access  to \nhousing has become increasingly problematic in the major urban centers, particularly in Ho Chi Minh \nCity  (HCMC),  Hanoi,  and  other  large  cities.  Making  land  and  finance  for  housing  available  to  the \nurban  population,  especially  the  low-income  and  poor,  at  affordable  rates  is  a  challenge  for  the \nGovernment.  \n \n3. \nIn  the  last  decade,  the  total  housing  area  increased  considerably  by  739  million  square \nmeters (m2) throughout Viet Nam, of which about 185 million m2 is in the urban areas. Upgraded and \nnewly  built  housing  by  owners  accounted  for  75%  of  total  housing,  while  housing  generated  by \nconstruction  companies  accounted  for  25%.  Per  capita  living  space  in  the  urban  areas  increased \nfrom 8.2 m2 to 10.4 m2. Notwithstanding this significant progress, housing conditions for a growing \nsegment  of  the  population  have  deteriorated  despite  the  Government  effort  to  provide  low-income \nhouses through housing projects. The housing shortage is serious in urban areas, and low-income \ngroups live in narrow and poor-quality accommodations. Almost 40% of households in urban areas \noccupy a usable housing area of less than 36 m2, including 16% of households that occupy an area \nof less than 24 m2. The majority of the population live in semipermanent houses. Only 26% of urban \nhouseholds have permanent housing types and 20% live in temporary, unstable structures.  \n \n4. \nThe  units  constructed  by  the  Government  were  insufficient  to  satisfy  the  huge  need  and \ndemand  for  housing  in  urban  areas,  particularly  for  the  lower-income  groups,  given  the  relatively \nlarge units provided \u2013 which are attractive to middle-income groups \u2013 and inappropriate locations of \nthe  units.  With  the  expected  rapid  growth  of  the  population  and  increased  urbanization  and  rural-\nurban  migration,  the  imbalance  in  demand  and  supply  of  the  housing  stock  in  urban  areas  will \nincrease.  The  Ministry  of  Construction  (MOC)  targets  the  construction  of  some  60  million  m2  of \nhousing in urban areas nationwide (24 million m2 to be built through projects and 36 million m2 to be \nbuilt  by  the  people  themselves)  by  2005.  After  2005,  the  average  housing  area  per  capita  is \nexpected  to  reach  12  m2,  with  housing  unit  averaging  50  m2.  MOC  has  not  clearly  identified  the \nsource for financing house construction on this scale. \n \n5. \nThe  lack  of  appropriate  financing  mechanisms  has  denied  urban  low-income  and  poor \nhouseholds  (ULIPHs)  access  to  affordable  options  for  housing  construction  or  improvement. \nAppraisal  forecasts  indicated  the  potential  ULIPH  requirements  to  upgrade  and  replace  current \nhousing to be 65 million m2, involving a cost of D59 trillion ($3.9 billion equivalent) and current latent \nhousing  demand  is  assessed  at  8.1  million  m2,  involving  a  cost  of  D16.3  trillion  ($1.1  billion \nequivalent). The average annual ULIPH new space demand is estimated at 5.6 million m2, involving \na cost of D11.2 trillion ($750 million equivalent) during 2000\u20132010, rising to 6.5 million m2, involving \na  cost  of  D13.0  trillion  ($900  million  equivalent),  during  2010\u20132020.  A  detailed  analysis  of  low-\nincome housing demand projections is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n\n\f2\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n6. \nAbout 80% of housing finance credit (HFC) in Viet Nam comes from the informal sector. That \nincludes  moneylenders,  friends,  relatives,  and  informal  rotating  savings  and  credit  associations \n(ROSCAs).  Friends  and  relatives  provide  loans  without  charging  interest,  while  moneylenders  will \ncharge  5\u201320%  monthly.  Less  than  20%  of  HFC  comes  from  the  formal  banking  or  Government \nsectors.  Government  finance  has  declined  dramatically  since  1986,  as  the  Government  shifted \nhousing ownership from the State to individual households. However, the Government is still actively \ninvolved with providing direct housing finance, particularly to the poor and low-income groups. The \nGovernment share of housing finance mobilization is around 10% of the total, but is declining rapidly \ndue  to  lack  of  funds.  Formal  housing  finance  is  still  relatively  underdeveloped,  but  is  increasing \nrapidly. Commercial retail banks providing housing loans to house owners represent about 10% of \nthe  total  housing  finance  market.  The  more  successful  commercial  banks  have  experienced  rapid \ngrowth in housing loan  origination and seen the housing loan share of their loan portfolio increase \nsteadily over the last 3 years. The seven commercial banks most involved in retail housing finance \nloans increased their total housing finance loan portfolio from D1.3 trillion ($95 million equivalent) in \n1998 to D3.0 trillion ($197.7 million equivalent) in 2001, recording an average annual growth rate of \n32%. For some commercial banks, housing finance loans are the fastest growing segment of their \nloan portfolio. \n \n7. \nMost  banks  giving  housing  loans  lack  significant  access  to  long-term  credit  funds  for  long-\nterm  loans,  an  important  prerequisite  for  developing  a  strong  housing  finance  market.  At  present, \nless  than  10%  of  the  total  funding  of  these  organizations  is  long-term  credit.  Consequently,  most \nhousing loans originating from these institutions have a relatively short duration \u2013 no longer than 5 \nyears \u2013 and are available only to medium and high-income groups. ULIPHs cannot afford the high \ndebt service required to repay short-term loans. Average housing loan sizes from the banks suggest \nthe loans are made predominantly to medium and higher-income groups.  \n \nB. \n \n8. \nThe comprehensive poverty reduction and growth strategy that the Government approved in \nMay  2002  recognizes  the  multifaceted  nature  of  poverty  and  poverty  reduction.  In  the  strategy, \nurban housing programs and housing finance for the poor and low-income groups are referred to in \nthe  context  of  efforts  and  programs  to  reduce  urban  poverty.  Considerable  emphasis  is  placed  on \nupgrading  urban  poor  areas,  providing  land  and  infrastructure,  formulating  small-scale  credit  and \nsavings  programs,  and  mobilizing  the  community.  The  ADB  country  strategy  and  program  for  Viet \nNam  identifies  housing  finance  for  low-income  households  as  one  of  the  priority  sectors  for  ADB \ninterventions in the urban sector.  \n \nIt  is  recognized  that  the  housing  sector  has  the  potential  to  enhance  the  quality  of  life  and \n9. \nreduce poverty and vulnerability. Lack of access to credit has prevented ULIPHs from breaking out \nof  poverty  by  developing  the  household\u2019s  asset  base.  Lack  of medium-  and  long-term finance  has \nbarred  ULIPHs  from  access  to  affordable  credit  for  their  priority  housing  improvement  and  new \nhousing.  Except  beneficiaries  of  limited  Government  housing  projects,  ULIPHs  below  the  mean \nincome  level  do  not  have  access  to  any  housing  credit  beyond  very  short-term  finance,  often  at \nexorbitant terms and conditions. \n \n10.  MOC  prepared  a  broad  policy,  planning  and  program  document  for  housing  development \nand  management  in  Viet  Nam  during  2001,1  paying  more  attention  to  housing  for  urban  people, \nespecially  low-income  and  poor  people.  The  document  formed  the  basis  for  two  major  housing \nsector  papers  delivered  at  the third  national  housing  conference  in  Hanoi  during  March  20022  that \n                                                 \n1   Orientation  for  Housing  Development  2001\u20132010,  prepared  by  the  Ministry  of  Construction,  presents  the  orientation, \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nobjectives, and detailed solutions for housing development. \n\n2   Housing Development and Management Action Plan for 2001\u20132005, Report on Housing Development and Management \n\nduring 1991\u20132000, and Major Objectives and Measures for the Period 2001\u20132010. \n\n\f \n\n3\n\noutlined the current housing sector policies, plans, and programs in Viet Nam. Government housing \npolicy  initiatives  have  involved  the  sale  of  state  housing  to  residents;  access  to  state  land  for \nhousing  developments;  subsidies  for  the  costs  of  infrastructure  for  land  development;  subsidized \nhousing for sale or rent to low-income and priority groups; land, house, and rental price regulation; \nland  and  other  property  tax  exemptions;  and  property  management  and  maintenance  support. \nGovernment housing policy initiatives on the demand side have been limited to providing subsidized \nhousing  credit,  at  zero  or  less  than  market  interest  rates,  to  poor  and  low-income  households. \nAccess  to  such  credit  has  been  limited  to  a  small  proportion  of  total  urban  households  in  that \ncategory, and is generally associated  with resettlement projects in major cities and replacement of \nflood-prone  housing  in  the  Mekong  Delta  and  other  regions.  Supplementary  Appendix  B  describes \nthe housing finance system in Viet Nam. \n \n11. \nAlthough  these  reforms  have  had  a  significant  impact  on  the  housing  sector,  many \nconstraints still remain, including lack of (i) a national housing finance policy that is integrated with \noverall  financial  and  housing  policies;  (ii)  an  institutional  and  regulatory  framework  for  the  housing \nfinance  sector;  (iii)  long-term  capital  financing  for  housing;  (iv) savings  schemes  linked  to  housing \nimprovements  and  development;  (v)  a  system  of  transparent,  well-justified,  and  targeted  subsidies \nfor  poor  households;  and  (vi)  a  well-functioning  legal  system  for  mortgages  and  valuation  of \nproperties. \n \n12. \nThe financial  system  is  in  poor  health.  Profitability  is  low,  the  capital  base  is  low,  and  non-\nperforming loans (NPLs) are a major problem. In the last few years, the Government has prepared a \n3-year  reform  program  with  the  assistance  of  the  International  Monetary  Fund  and  World  Bank,3 \nunder  the  poverty  reduction  and  growth  facility  and  poverty  reduction  support  credit.  The \nGovernment\u2019s reform program for the banking sector consists of the following elements: (i) phasing \nout policy and noncommercial directed lending by state owned commercial banks (SOCBs), except \nfor a few cases in the transition where explicit Ministry of Finance (MOF) guarantees are provided; \n(ii)  phasing  the  recapitalization  of  each  SOCB  over  a  3-year  period,  conditional  on  the  SOCB\u2019s \nsatisfactory  annual  performance  on  key  actions  and  key  operational  targets  specified  in  their \nindividual  restructuring  plans;  (iii)  resolving  NPLs  of  SOCBs  through  their  own  asset  management \ncompanies  and  loan  workout  units;  (iv)  international  auditors  conducting  annual  independent \ninternational account audits; and (v) raising the share of credit to the private sector. ADB under two \nfinance sector program loans,4 supported the Government efforts to develop alternative channels of \nfinancial  intermediation  through  money/capital  markets,  insurance  and  leasing  subsectors,  and \nfinancial infrastructure to enhance public confidence in the system. Improvements in the nonbanking \nsubsector and capital market will provide long-term funds and investment capital, largely lacking in \nViet Nam, which could fund mortgage refinancing. The Project has taken into consideration all these \ninterventions and is consistent with them. \n \n13. \nThe housing finance problem in Viet Nam can be defined in several ways: (i) from the point \nof view of a household the problem is the possibility of obtaining a loan at affordable terms; (ii) for \nMOC, the problem is the lack of resources to carry out public housing projects; and (iii) for MOF and \nState  Bank  of  Viet  Nam  (SBV)  the  problem  is  to  prevent  financial  instability  and  to  increase \nconfidence  in  the  financial  system.  The  Project  will  support  the  establishment  of  a  sustainable \nhousing  finance  system  that  will  reconcile  three  partially  conflicting  objectives  (i)  affordability  to \nhouseholds, (ii) viability of financial institutions, and (iii) resource mobilization to expand the sector.  \n\n                                                 \n3   The  International  Monetary  Fund  approved  a  poverty  reduction  and  growth  facility  for  SDR290  million  ($368  million \nequivalent) on 6 April 2001 and the World Bank approved a poverty reduction support credit for $250 million on 4 June \n2001. The areas of reform are comprehensive, covering the private sector, state-owned enterprises, banking, trade, and \npublic expenditure management. \n\n4   ADB. 1996.

Satisfying  the  requirements  for  low-\nincome  HFC  is  beyond  the  reach  of  Government  funding  or  international  external  assistance.  The \nsolution  lies  in  mobilizing  domestic  capital  finance  by  facilitating  the  development  of  the  primary \nhousing finance market and the longer term development of a secondary mortgage market. Housing \nfinance needs to be viewed as a key component of both housing sector and financial sector policies. \nThe Government needs to increase housing policy initiatives to the demand side through a strategy \nthat  includes  (i)  establishing  an  efficient  institutional  framework,  and  improving  regulations  and \npractices for the housing finance market; (ii) creating new savings products linked to housing loans; \n(iii)  developing  the  primary  mortgage  market  and  establishing  the  basis  for  a  future  secondary \nmarket;  and  (iv)  establishing  specific  measures  to  support  the  poor,  particularly  through  urban \nupgrading  and  own-build  options,  and  transparent  targeted  subsidies.  The  Project  will  support  the \nGovernment  in  developing  a  housing  finance  orientation  (policy  document)  that  will  have  those \nelements  and  promote  housing  finance  as  a  main  element  in  the  national  housing  and  finance \npolicies.  \n \n15. \nInstitutional Framework for Housing Finance. No particular institution in Viet Nam has the \nmandate to develop the demand side of the housing finance market. The development of an efficient \nhousing mortgage market in Viet Nam requires the establishment of a housing finance facility (HFF) \nthat  will  be  placed  initially  within  SBV  and  will  refinance  housing  loans  from  qualified  participating \nfinancial  institutions  (PFI).  The  HFF  would  become  an  independent  mortgage  refinance  agency \n(MRA) and apex institution for housing finance. The Project will provide (i) initial resources to HFF to \nstart  its  operations  on  a  pilot  basis;  and    (ii) capacity  building  and  training  activities  for  HFF  and \nparticipating  financial  institutions  (PFIs),  with  the  objective  of  developing  the  national  housing \nfinance  system.  The  establishment  of  HFF  will  be  an  opportunity  to  test  the  mechanisms  for  loan \ndisbursement  to  ULIPHs,  and  act  as  a  catalyst  to  facilitate  reforms  in  the  housing  finance  sector. \nHFF  will lead to (i) the development of an efficient primary mortgage market accessible to ULIPHs \nby  institutionalizing  standards,  procedures,  and good  practices  among  PFIs;  and  (ii)  building  up of \nbasic requirements for the emergence of a secondary mortgage market.  \n \nEstablishing  HFF  within  an  existing  commercial  bank  was  considered  during  project \n16. \npreparation;  however,  international  experience  has  shown  that  this  option  would  prevent  the \ndevelopment of a sustainable housing loan refinancing market because of (i) the conflict of interest \nbetween  that  bank\u2019s  apex  wholesale  banking  function  and  its  retail  housing  finance  function;  and \n(ii) the inhibiting influence of competitive retail banks disclosing retail housing finance activities to a \ncompetitor.  Once  the  primary  mortgage  market  has  been  developed,  and  HFF  has  acquired  a \nreputation  as  an  efficient,  low-risk,  and  stable  facility,  HFF  would  become  an  independent  MRA. \nInitially, however, it is more appropriate to establish HFF inside SBV, as the implicit authority of SBV \nwill ensure sound principles of effective governance and prompt PFIs to accept prudential operating \nstandards.  Relocating  HFF  will  be  examined  in  the  project  midterm  review,  and  ADB  and  the \nGovernment will agree on a timetable for establishing it as an independent MRA, at the latest, at the \nend of the Project implementation period.  \n \n17. \nLong-Term Finance and Expansion of the Housing Finance System. A key constraint to \ndeveloping an effective housing finance market is the absence of long-term credit funds in the Viet \nNam banking system. This disproportionately affects ULIPHs. To expand ULIPH\u2019s access to housing \nloans, the Project will provide a long-term HFC line to HFF to refinance housing loans originated by \nPFIs.  Providing  medium-  and  long-term  loans  for  housing  will  catalyze  the  development  of  the \nhousing  finance  market.  Furthermore,  as  capital  markets  and  institutional  investors  such  as \ninsurance  companies  and  pension  funds  develop  in  Viet  Nam,  a  sustainable  domestic  capital  flow \ninto HFF/MRA could develop. This will require transforming HFF into a completely independent MRA \nthat would act as a secondary market facility (SMF) with its own capital, efficient management, and \ntransparent procedures, and able to attract long-term capital to the housing sector.  The MRA/SMF \ncould purchase performing housing mortgage loans from PFIs, thus providing new capital to create \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nfurther housing loans and enlarge the housing finance market in Viet Nam. The Project will support \nthe  Government  to  conceive  and  design  features  for  mortgage  bonds  to  be  issued  by  a  potential \nSMF for long-term institutional investors, and to establish the basis for the long-term of objective of \ndeveloping a secondary mortgage market. \n \nSavings  Schemes  Linked  to  Housing  Improvement  and  Development.  No  particular \n18. \nproducts in the banking system link formal savings with mortgage lending for housing. Access to the \nformal  housing  finance  sector  can  be  enhanced  through  the  development  of  contractual  housing-\nsaving  schemes,  where  a  ULIPH  undertakes  to  save  a  given  amount  over  a  prescribed  period  of \ntime  and  the  housing finance  institution  agrees  to  provide  a  housing  loan  at  the  end  of the  saving \nperiod  for  an  amount  and  term  dependent  on  the  accumulated  savings  amount.  Such  schemes \nreduce  the  element  of  uncertainty  for  both  the  ULIPH  and  the  bank.  The  Project  will  promote  the \nestablishment  of  these  long-term  savings  instruments  linked  to  housing  in  the  participating \ncommercial  banks  (PCBs).  In  the  CFIs,  microcredit  deposit  saving  schemes  would  help  poor \nhouseholds  to  access  the  formal  housing  finance  sector  through  a  group  savings  and  lending \nmechanism.  Such  schemes  will  be  developed  and  administered  under  the  Project  by  sustainable \nmicrofinance  organizations,  generally  working  through  mass  organizations  such  as  the  Women\u2019s \nUnion  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs).  This  mechanism  will  involve  microcredit \norganizations lending for home improvement to groups of poor households on the strength of prior \ncollective  group  savings,  with  the  groups  being  responsible  for  dealing  with  individual  savings \ncollection, lending, and loan repayments themselves. \n \n19. \nHousing Finance Awareness and Marketing Campaign. ULIPHs have limited knowledge \nof and access to the formal housing finance sector. Survey data collected during project preparation \nindicated  that  ULIPHs  were  interested  to  learn  more  about  housing  loans  from  financial  lending \ninstitutions and would consider sourcing housing finance from the formal sector rather than from the \ninformal market  sources,  particularly  moneylenders. To  ensure that  ULIPHs  better  understand  and \nutilize the project subloans, the Project will enable an awareness and marketing program specifically \ntargeted ULIPHs. \n  \nDatabase  of  Housing  Finance  Demand.  There  is  a  large  demand  for  new  and  improved \n20. \nhousing  for  ULIPHs  in  resettlement  areas,  shanty  housing  improvement  projects,  industrial  estate \nemployee  housing  projects,  as  well  as  government  employees.  However,  commercial  banks  have \ndifficulties  identifying  these  opportunities  for  lending  to  ULIPHs.  The  Project  will  help  PFIs  assess \nthe  housing  demand  of  ULIPHs  by  gathering  information  on  opportunities  from  particular  social \ngroups.  Under  the  Project,  HFF  will  establish  a  database  of  ULIPHs.  The  database  will  include \nnational  registers  of  resettlement,  shanty  housing  improvement,  and  industrial  estate  employee \nhousing projects, as well as government employees requiring housing finance. \n \n21. \nLegal Improvements of Mortgage System. The right to grant a mortgage to secure a loan \nusing land use right (LUR) is one of the rights established under the Land Law. There is no legal bar \nto  mortgages  being  used  in  all  cases  where  land  use  rights  certificates  (LURCs)  or  building \nownership and land use certificates (BOLUCs), have been granted or existing historical rights have \nbeen or are entitled to be recognized. However, commercial banks are reluctant to use mortgages \ndue to the uncertainty in calling up property in case of default. While the Land Law and Civil Code \npermit  mortgages  and  the  right  to  sell  land  in  case  of  loan  default,  this  right  is  seldom  exercised \nbecause the spread and confusion of legislation on mortgages make it difficult for judges to interpret \nand  implement the  law.  To make  it  easier for  both  credit  institutions  and  borrowers  to  understand, \naccept  and  use  mortgages  over  LUR  and  houses,  the  laws  relating  to  mortgages  of  LURs  and \nbuildings attached to land should be revised and consolidated to (i) remove all constraints imposed \nby  Government  or  local  authorities  on  the  unrestricted  transfer,  exchange,  or  lease  of  residential \nland,  with  or  without  buildings;  and  (ii) more  clearly  define  the  procedures  to  be  followed  when \ncalling up a mortgage in default, selling the mortgaged LUR and house, and defining the extent of \n\n\f6\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nthe  court\u2019s  jurisdiction  in  such  cases.  An  interministerial  committee  chaired  by  SBV  will  be \nestablished with senior representatives from MOC, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment \n(MNRE),  and  Ministry  of  Justice  (MOJ)  to  prepare  legal  reforms  required  to  ensure  the \nestablishment of a transparent and efficient legal framework for mortgages. The Project will support \nthis process and the preparation of appropriate legislation on mortgages. \n \n22. \nValuation of Housing Mortgage Collateral. Decree 178/1999 requires credit organizations \nto  use  frame  prices  when  valuing  land  used  as  collateral  for  housing  mortgage  loans.  The  land \nframe  prices  in  urban  areas  are  outdated,  arbitrary,  and  inaccurate,  as  they  had  been  set  by \nprovincial people\u2019s committees (PPC) based on the national frame price set by the Government in \n1994.  Frame  prices  for  urban  land  are  generally  significantly  lower  than  the  actual  market  value. \nThis  decree  requirement  restricts  credit  institutions  from  making  their  own  value  and  risk \nassessments and frequently disadvantages borrowers, as it limits the size of the loan. For ULIPHs \nthis requirement is particularly onerous as it increases the proportion of deposit they are required to \nmeet  from  savings  or  additional  borrowings.  While  the  credit  organization  obtains  better  collateral \ndue to the small loan size relative to the actual land value, the borrower\u2019s access to appropriate loan \nlevels  is  restricted.  When  they  borrow  from  more  than  one  source  to  meet  the  high  deposit \nrequirement,  the  additional  repayment  requirements  are  onerous  and  in  some  cases  lead  to  loan \ndefaults. In addition, some ULIPHs are unable to access such credit facility, as they cannot meet the \nhigh  deposit  and/or  repayment  requirements.  The  Project  will  address  this  issue  in  the  policy  and \ninstitutional  action  plan  by  eliminating  the  use  of  frame  prices  by  credit  organizations  valuing  land \ncollateral,  and  providing  support  for  the  establishment  of  a  market-based  valuation  system  for \nproperties. \n \n23. \nIssue of Land and Building Title Certificates. The slow grant of LURCs and BOLUCs has \nbeen a serious problem in the urban areas in Viet Nam. It is estimated that approximately 18% of the \nurban population have a title certificate for their properties although in particular areas almost half of \nthe population do. Without a BOLUC or LURC, landholders cannot use their land and building assets \nas  security  under  a  mortgage.  This  issue  arises  from  the  lack  of  sufficient  numbers  of  suitably \ntrained  and  experienced  cadastral,  administration,  and  legal  staff  in  the  Department  of  Land \nAdministration  (DLA)  or  Department  of  Land  Administration  and  Housing  (DLAH)  in  each  city, \nprovince, district, and town, and from the complexity of the mechanism required to obtain the title. As \na result, the land and housing registers maintained by DLAs and DLAHs are incomplete and have \nlimited  use  as  the  basis  for  registering  mortgages.  MNRE  is  actively  engaged  in  improving  the \nsystem for issuing LURC and BOLUC in cooperation with DLAs and DLAHs of the major cities and \nprovinces.  The  Government  has  assured  that  issuing  of  titles  will  continue  with  the  support  of \nseveral development partners.  \n \n24. \nExternal Assistance to the Sector. External assistance to housing finance related sectors \nhas  been  extensive  and  has  advanced  the  legal  and  institutional  framework  for  developing  the \nhousing  finance  market  in  the  last  10  years.  External  assistance  has  focused  on  (i)  land \nadministration  reform,  (ii)  housing  sector,  (iii)  urban  development,  and  (iv)  financial  and  banking \nsectors. The external assistance to the urban, housing and financial sector is presented in Appendix \n1. \n \nLessons  Learned.  Key  lessons  from  past  developing  country  experience  with  low-income \n25. \nhousing loan projects include (i) subsidized interest rates on subloans to ULIPHs invariably leak to \nhigher  income  groups,  regardless  of  the  criteria  on  income  qualification  criteria;  (ii)  supply-side \napproaches  involving  the  provision  of  sites,  services,  and  housing  for  ULIPH  borrowers  generally \nresult  in  high  cost  and  inappropriate  housing  unaffordable  to  the  target  beneficiaries;  (iii)  housing \nsubloan origination and repayment management practices frequently lead to leakage of subloans to \nnontarget  beneficiaries  and  high  subborrower  repayment  delinquency  and  loan  default,  unless \nsustainable  capacity  building  technical  assistance  is  provided  and  monitoring  systems  are \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nestablished;  and  (iv)  secondary  mortgage  markets  are  unsustainable  unless  a  primary  mortgage \nmarket has developed based on sound land titling and, valuation, and legal provisions for mortgage \nloan recovery. These lessons have been factored into the design of the Project. \n \n\nIII.  \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\n \nA. \n\nObjective \n\n26. \nThe Project\u2019s goal is to improve the quality of life for ULIPHs through improved housing. The \nspecific  objective  is  to  promote  the  establishment  of  a  sustainable  housing  finance  market  in  Viet \nNam  accessible  to  ULIPHs.  The  Project  will  provide  approximately  27,500  housing  finance  loans \ndisbursed through qualified PFIs, and will benefit over 137,000 people in the first round of lending.5 \nThe Project will support the establishment of a HFF that would become the apex institution for the \nhousing  finance  sector.  All  loans  to  PFIs  will  be  channeled  through  HFF,  which  will  become  a \nrefinance facility (revolving fund) in charge of disbursement to the PFIs and repayments on a regular \nbasis. The Project will have an institutional strengthening and capacity building program and a policy \nand institutional reform action plan. The Project framework is in Appendix 2. A policy and institutional \naction plan is presented in Appendix 3. \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nThe  Project  consists  of  three  parts:  (i)  mortgage  lending  to  urban  low-income  households \n27. \n(ULIHs);  (ii)  housing  microfinance  to  urban  poor  households  (UPHs);  and  (iii)  institutional \nstrengthening and capacity building. \n \n\n1. \n\nMortgage Lending to Urban Low-Income Households \n\n \n28. \nHousing  mortgage  loans  to  ULIHs  through  PCBs  will  be  provided  through  two  subprojects: \n(i) mortgage loans for housing purchase (up to D100 million per housing unit cost); and (ii) mortgage \nloans for housing upgrade (up to D20 million per housing project cost). Approximately 4,100 ULIHs \nwill  obtain  loans  to  buy  or  build  houses  and  about  14,600  will  obtain  loans  to  upgrade/improve \nexisting houses. \n \n\n2. \n\nHousing Microfinance to Urban Poor Households \n\n29. \nThrough  established  microfinance  community-based  financial  institutions  (CFIs),  housing \nmicrofinance  loans  to  UPHs  existing  depositors  will  be  provided  through  two  subprojects:  (i)  loans \nfor small home improvement (up to D15 million per housing project cost); and (ii) loans for own-build \nhousing (up to D15 million housing project materials cost). At least 6,700 UPHs will obtain loans to \nupgrade/improve existing houses, and 2,100 will obtain loans to own-build new houses. \n \n\n3. \n\nInstitutional Strengthening and Capacity Building \n\n30. \nThe  Project  will  support  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  building  to  develop  the \nhousing finance system in Viet Nam. The subcomponents follow: (i) support for establishing an HFF \nthat  would  become  the  apex  institution  for  the  housing  finance  sector,  (ii)  a  training  and  capacity \nbuilding  for  HFF  and  PFIs,  (iii)  a  housing  finance  awareness  and  marketing  program,  and \n(iv) establishment of a housing demand database for ULIPHs.  \n \nThe Project will include a significant institutional strengthening and capacity building program \n31. \nto facilitate the development of a sustainable and effective housing finance market in Viet Nam. All \n                                                 \n5   It  is  possible  that  the  number  of  beneficiaries  over  the  loan  term  will  increase  2-3  times  with  housing  loan  rollovers, \n\ndepending on the experienced average length of the loan term. \n\n\f8\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nstakeholders  will  benefit  from  capacity  building  activities  to  develop  and  enhance  management \nprocedures  and  staff  technical  capabilities.  The  Project  will  (i)  train  PFIs  to  attract  new  customers \n(savers and borrowers) by designing new savings and lending instruments for housing; (ii) train PFIs \nto  reinforce  their  capacity  in  marketing  strategy  for  housing  finance,  particularly  for  ULIPH  target \ngroups;  (iii)  provide  advisory  services  to  SBV  and  PFIs  for  standardizing  mortgage  instruments, \nunderwriting,  and  servicing  procedures;  (iv)  assist  SBV  and  the  Government  in  designing  an \nadequate  housing-savings  scheme  that  will  increase  the  long-term  domestic  savings  available  for \nthe  housing  sector;  (v)  assist  the  financial  authorities  in  developing  new  instruments  based  on \nhousing mortgages to be offered in the capital market; (vi) establish the basis for issuing mortgage \nbonds and developing a sustainable secondary mortgage market; (vii) support MNRE, MOC, MOJ, \nand SBV in consolidating and improving the laws, regulations, and practices relating to mortgages \nand valuation of LURs and houses; and (viii) support the Government in preparing a housing finance \norientation (policy document). \n \n32. \nSome key characteristics of the Project are that (i) housing loans will be demand-driven, in \ncontrast to the supply-driven approach of sponsored housing development programs involving very \nlimited housing option choices; (ii) the interest rate structure will be at full market rates, without any \nsubsidies,  subject  to  competitive  market  influences;  (iii)  Government  subsidies  through  free  or \nsubsidized land, infrastructure services, tax rebates, or direct cash advances to UPHs, given through \ntransparent procedures, could complement the Project, but are not required; (iv) housing loans will \nbe available for flexible terms of 5-20 years at levels affordable to ULIPH; and (v) housing finance for \nnew and existing houses and house upgrading, will be provided only for urban areas.  \n \n33. \nThe four key outputs of the Project are (i) the establishment of HFF to monitor project funds, \nestablish procedures and documentation, and act as a think-tank in developing the housing finance \nsector;  (ii)  refinancing  through  HFF  to  PFIs  originating  ULIPH  housing  loans;  (iii) establishment  of \nlinkages  between  CFIs and  NGOs  and  people\u2019s  committees (PCs)  to facilitate  small  loans  to  UPH \nfor  own-build  and  house  improvement;  and  (iv)  capacity  building  and  institutional  strengthening \nthrough  HFF,  resulting  in  effective  project  management  systems  in  PFIs,  a  housing  finance \norientation (policy document), and improvements in legislation on mortgages and valuation. \n \n34. \nA wide range of potential PFIs (PCBs and CFIs) have been identified and assessed. Recent \nfinancial statements and operating data, experience in housing finance, and commitment to develop \ntheir  housing  finance  portfolio  for  low-income  households  were  reviewed.  Six  PCBs  and  two  CFIs \nwere  prequalified  as  PFIs  that  could  participate  in  the  Project,  provided  they  comply  with  all  the \nconditions  established  to  qualify.  The  selection  of  the  prequalified  PFIs  was  based  on  their  past \nexperience in housing finance, commitment to participate in the Project and financial indicators. The \nprequalified  PCBs  are  the  Bank  of  Investment  and  Development  of  Viet  Nam,  Industrial  and \nCommercial  Bank  of  Viet  Nam,  Housing  Development  Bank  of  Mekong  Delta,  Asia  Commercial \nBank,  Ho  Chi  Minh  City  Housing  Bank,  and  Sacombank.  The  pre-qualified  CFIs  are  the  People\u2019s \nCredit Funds network, and Viet Nam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development. Other CFIs could \nbe  prequalified  after  the  Government  completes  the  legal  framework  for  microfinance  institutions. \nIndependent auditors will prepare a detailed due diligence analysis of the PFIs before they are fully \nqualified  and  can  access  project  funds.  A  summary  of  the  key  PFI  financial  performance  and \nfinancial forecasts for 10 PCBs and 2 CFIs are in Supplementary Appendix C.  \n \n35. \nPFIs  must  sign  a  HFC  loan  agreement  with  HFF  before  they  can  access  housing  loan \nrefinancing  for  beneficiary  subloans.  The  HFC  loan  agreement  will  outline  (i)  eligible  housing \nsubborrowers;  (ii)  subloan  terms  and  conditions;  (iii)  subloan  management;  and  (iv)  audit, \nsupervision,  and  reporting  requirements.  The  HFC  loan  agreement  will  have  these  key  features \n(i) eligible  housing  subborrowers  have  a  monthly  income  in  the  range  of  D0.35  million-3.5  million; \n(ii) the  maximum  subloan  for  house  purchase  and  home  improvement/upgrade  is  equal  to  70%  of \nthe value of house or house upgrade cost, requiring a 30% subborrower equity contribution; (iii) the \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nmaximum price of the house eligible for a subloan is D100 million; (iv) maximum subloan term is 20 \nyears; (v) subborrower provides LURC or, where appropriate, BOLUC as collateral for all subloans \nfrom PCBs, while for housing microfinance from CFI, other forms of collateral will be allowed (e.g., \nindividual or group guarantees); (vi) HFC loans from HFF to PFIs will be for the term of the subloans; \n(vii) HFC loans from the HFF to PFIs will be at a variable interest rate adjusted quarterly and set at \nthe weighted average of all time deposits in the banking system; (viii) interest rates for subloans will \nbe  in  accordance  with  the  interest  rate  policy  of  each  PFI;  subborrowers  can  choose  a  fixed  rate \n(prevailing variable rate as defined above plus a premium) for the term of the subloan, or a variable \nrate  periodically  adjusted;  (ix)  PCBs  will  be  required  to  lend  20%  of  each  subloan  from  their  own \nfunds,  while  CFIs  due  to  their  lower  equity  base  will  be  required  to  contribute  only  10%  of  each \nsubloan from their own funds; (x) when PFI fails  to repay the principal and/or interest due on a HFC \nloan from HFF, the HFF has the right to call either the outstanding balance of the PFI\u2019s entire HFC \nloan portfolio or the specific HFC loan(s) in default (based on the circumstances of that default and \nthe financial condition of the PFI) and suspend the right of the PFI to obtain further HFC loans; and \n(xi) all risks inherent to subloans by PFIs will be borne by PFIs. \n  \n36. \nLoan terms and conditions for loans to PFIs and subloans to individual households under the \nProject  have  been  developed  after  extensive  consultation  with  potential  PCBs  and  CFIs  currently \nengaged in housing finance lending to ULIPHs as well as survey and focus group discussions with \nULIPHs. A summary of survey findings during project preparation is in Appendix 4. \n \nC. \n \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nInstitutional Development \n\n \nThe  establishment  of  HFF  will  be  the  basis  for  developing  institutions  and  organizing  the \n37. \nhousing  finance  sector  in  Viet  Nam.  HFF  will  carry  out  the  following  responsibilities:  (i) coordinate \ninstitutional  support  and  technical  assistance  to  PFIs;  (ii)  be  the  think-tank  for  conceiving  new \nfinancial  instruments  and  developing  the  primary  and  secondary  markets  for  housing  finance; \n(iii) refinance  housing  loans  from  qualified  PFIs;  and  (iv)  advise  SBV  and  the  Government  on \nhousing  finance  strategy  and  policy  matters.  Initially  HFF  would  (i)  establish  assessment  and \nmonitoring procedures for PFIs; (ii) complete the process of qualification of PFI, selected among the \nprequalified PFIs; and (iii) monitor the qualified PFIs and ensure that onlending terms to ULIPHs are \napplied. HFF will be an autonomous unit within SBV. In the medium-term, HFF will ideally become \nan  independent  MRA  that  could  act  as  a  commercial  wholesale  facility  for  refinancing  mortgage \nloans. In the long-term, it could become a SMF, with its own capital, able to attract additional long-\nterm funds to the housing sector through the issuance of bonds and mortgage-backed securities. \n \n \n \n38. \nPolicy  dialogue  has  centered  on  issues  that  will  facilitate  the  development  of  a  sustainable \nhousing finance market: (i) a national housing finance orientation (policy document) that integrates \nhousing and finance policy concerns and objectives and establishes the framework for developing a \nsustainable  housing  finance  market  will  be  prepared  and  approved  by  the  Government; \n(ii) consolidating  and  rationalizing  mortgage  legislation  and  preparing  regulations  for  effective \nimplementation;  (iii) releasing organizations from the requirement to use or be influenced by frame \nprices  when  assessing  the  value  of  LURC,  and  promoting  international,  market-based  valuation \ntechniques and best practices; (iv) continuing the policy reform agenda of the Government in areas \nthat  affect  housing  finance  such  as  the  increased  issuance  of  LURCs  and  BOLUCs,  and  banking \nsector  reform;  (v)  preparing  the  basis  and  assessing  options  for  the  long-term  expansion  of  the \nhousing  finance  system  by  developing  contractual  savings  schemes  linked  to  mortgages,  a \nmortgage insurance scheme, and issuance of bonds by a SMF. In many of these areas, policy and \nlegal reform has been an ongoing process and significant positive changes have occurred in recent \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\n2. \n\n\f10\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3. \n\nPoverty Intervention \n\nyears.  In the  banking  sector, for  example,  interest  rate  controls  were  completely  liberalized  from  1 \nJune 2002, when the interest rate for lending and deposit rates were deregulated. The project policy \nreforms  are  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  national  policy  objective  of  moving  from  Government \nsubsidized and control policies to an open market economy.  \n \n \n \n39. \nThe  Project  has  been  classified  as  a  poverty  intervention.  Approximately  32%  of  the  total \nproject beneficiaries are expected to be poor. Approximately 43,700 urban poor will benefit from the \nProject  directly  through  the  microfinance  component.  Official  estimates  indicate  9%  of  urban \nhouseholds were below the poverty line in 1997/98 Viet Nam Living Standards Survey (VLSS), but \nthis is believed to be an underestimate, as participatory poverty assessments showed that the VLSS \ndid  not  cover  unregistered  migrants  (whose  number  is  significant  in  the  larger  urban  areas).  The \nproportion  of  urban  households  below  the  poverty  line  is  estimated  to  be  around  15%.  Such \nhouseholds are classified as poor, while households with incomes above the poverty line, but below \nthe  average  income  are  classified  as  low-income  for  the  purpose  of  the  Project.  Nationally,  two \npoverty lines are in use \u2013 one based on the VLSS analysis, and one used by the Ministry of Labor, \nInvalids  and  Social  Affairs  (MOLISA).  For  urban  areas  these  poverty  lines  were  estimated  at \nD873,000  ($58  equivalent)  and  D750,000  ($50  equivalent)  per  household  per  month,  while  the \naverage household income was D3,550,000 ($237 equivalent) per month. The Project has used the \nMOLISA poverty line to classify the beneficiaries as poor. A poverty reduction and social strategy is \npresented in Appendix 5. \n \n40. \nParticular  groups  of  UPHs  with  stable  income  could  especially  benefit  from  the  Project \nincluding (i) resettlement households associated with infrastructure development projects; (ii) canal \nand  shanty  area  households  designated  for  rehabilitation;  and  (iii)  housing  projects  for  selected \ngovernment and major employer worker groups. Resettlement projects have the advantage that land \n(including the grant of LURC) and infrastructure service costs for resettlement housing are generally \nincluded in the project or contributed by the relevant people\u2019s committee (PC) from their own funds. \nAdditionally,  the  compensation  package,  provided  to  affected  households  at  replacement  cost, \nprovides the households with enough funds to pay for a significant part of an improved house unit, if \nthey decide to use the opportunity for a larger or better house. Resettlement projects also have the \nadvantage that they usually have a choice of appropriate housing options for target UPHs. Finally, \nsome  resettlement  projects  have  social  survey  inputs,  community  consultation,  and  savings  credit \nschemes to  prepare  households  for  relocation.  In  all,  resettlement  projects  offer  an  opportunity for \nthe Project to provide the vital, and usually lacking, long-term housing credit facility to resettlement \nand rehabilitation projects, without the need to develop an entire housing and infrastructure project. \nAccess  to  housing  loans  for  resettlement  households  would  be  in  addition  to  the  house \ncompensation entitlements to which resettlement-affected people are already eligible. \n \n \n \n41. \nAffordability analyses were carried out to ensure that project loans will not create an undue \nfinancial burden on the ultimate beneficiaries. Loan repayments for different average loan sizes for \neach component were calculated on a monthly basis and the minimum household income required \nto  service  the  loan  amount  was  estimated  for  each  case.  The  Project  provides  a  wide  array  of \nhousing  options  for  ULIPHs  wishing  to  improve  their  current  housing  standards,  including  house \npurchase,  own-build  housing,  and  house  upgrading.  These  options  provide  access  to  affordable \nhousing credit for all low-income households and even households  with a relatively steady income \nstream  who  are  below  the  poverty  line.  Households  with  monthly  incomes  at  the  top  of  the  low-\nincome  housing  range  (between  D1.8  million-3.5  million  per  month)  can  readily  afford  housing \nfinance  to  buy  a  new  house  or  apartment  at  commercial  bank  rates  (around  10%  per  annum). \nHouseholds with monthly household incomes below D1.8 million can readily afford to upgrade their \n\nAffordability \n\n4. \n\n\f \n\n11\n\n5.  \n\nFlow of Funds and Onlending Arrangements \n\nexisting houses or take the own-build option. Households at the bottom of the low-income band (less \nthan D1 million per month) and poor households (above D350,000 per month) will be able to afford \nthe existing house improvement or own-build options. The affordability of different loan products is \npresented in Appendix 6, and a detailed sensitivity analysis is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n \n \n42.  MOF  will  enter  into  a  financing  agreement  with  SBV,  which  will  establish  a  HFF-project \nmanagement unit (PMU). Funds will flow from MOF to SBV/HFF in dong, which will be the currency \nof all subsequent fund flows. Qualified PFIs will be required to sign a HFC loan agreement with HFF \nbefore  they  can  access  housing  loan  refinancing  for  beneficiary  subloans.  HFF  will  provide  credit \nlines for each HFC of a maximum of $2 million for PCBs and $1 million for CFIs. The maximum total \naccumulated HFC amount for any PFI will be $7 million. PFIs will provide from their own resources \ncapital equal to 20% of all subloans to borrowers from PCBs and 10% of all subloans to borrowers \nfrom  CFIs.  Subborrowers  will  contribute  some  30%  of  their  housing  costs,  ensuring  they  have \nsignificant equity in their housing project.   \n \n43.  MOF  and  SBV  will  sign  a  financing  agreement  acceptable  to  ADB  providing  for  (i)  the \ntransfer of the funds for the institutional strengthening and capacity building component as a grant; \n(ii) the transfer of the loan from MOF to SBV/HFF for purposes of the Project with a loan term of 20 \nyears and a grace period of 5 years; and (iii) SBV/HFF to pay MOF all interest rate funds on the loan \ndisbursed except 1% for a management fee to be retained by HFF. HFF will use this management \nfee (i) to cover the cost of operating HFF-PMU (including training and capacity building for HFF-PMU \nand PFIs), (ii) to cover the cost of conducting marketing campaigns to ULIPHs to advise them of the \nProject,  (iii)  to  accumulate  reserves for  working  capital  when  HFF  becomes  an  independent  MRA, \nand (iv) to relend to project beneficiaries. The management fee will be calculated at 1% annually on \nthe outstanding subloans, and payable quarterly to HFF from PFI subloan repayments to HFF. MOF \nwill  bear  the  foreign  exchange  risk  from  the  remaining  interest  payments  from  PFIs  to  HFF,  after \ndeducting  the  HFF  management  fee.  The  financial  arrangements  for  the  Project  are  presented  in \nAppendix 7. \n \n \n \nThe Project will initiate the process to develop a sustainable market-based facility to provide \n44. \nhousing finance to ULIPHs. The use of market-based interest rates will lead to sustainability of the \nProject. The establishment of a revolving fund at HFF for refinancing mortgage loans from PFIs will \nensure the sustainability and reuse of the funds. The commitment from PCBs and CFIs to provide \n20% and 10%, respectively of the total loan value will also ensure sustainability. In the medium-term, \nstandardizing the housing loan underwriting procedures, practices, and documentation will facilitate \nthe  establishment  of  appropriate  control  mechanisms,  and  in  the  long-term  attract  capital  to  the \nsector  for  the  development  of  a  secondary  market.  The  long-term  sustainability  of  the  housing \nfinance sector will be strengthened. \n \n \n \nThe  beneficiaries  will  be  ULIPHs,  who  are  willing  to  take  loans  from  PFIs  for  purchasing, \n45. \nconstructing,  or  improving  their  houses,  and  have  the  capacity  to  repay  the  subloan  proceeds  by \ninstallments.  The  Project  will  benefit  more  than  137,000  urban  low-income  and  poor  persons \nincluding more than 43,000 urban poor. Under the Project, PFIs will refinance housing and housing \nupgrade loans to ULIPHs with monthly incomes of D0.35 million-3.5 million. The PCBs will primarily \nfocus on ULIHs in the D0.75 million-3.5 million monthly household income range who can afford to \nfinance a new or existing housing unit at a cost of D100 million at 70% financing, or could upgrade \nthe house for a cost up to D20 million, at commercial interest rates and a maturity of up to 20 years. \n\nProject Beneficiaries \n\nSustainability \n\n7.  \n\n6. \n\n\f12\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n9. \n\n8.  \n\nQualifying Criteria for PFIs \n\nInvolvement of NGOs and Local Community Groups \n\nThe CFIs will focus on UPHs below below the poverty line in the D350,000\u2013750,000 monthly income \nrange.  Affordable  options  for  this  household  segment  follow:  (i) a  building  materials  loan  for  own-\nbuild  housing;  and  (ii)  smaller  home-improvement  loans.  PFIs  will  also  benefit  directly  from  the \nProject, while construction companies will benefit indirectly. \n \n \n \n46. \nThe  loan  delivery  mechanism  for  smaller  own-build  and  house  improvement  loans  will  be \nimplemented  through  CFI-managed  credit  schemes  administered  with  the  assistance  of  PCs,  local \ncommunity groups, and NGOs. These intermediaries will facilitate scaling of UPHs\u2019 individual small \nsavings  and  lending  activities  to  a  larger  group  scale  more  attractive  to  CFIs.  NGOs  could  also \nparticipate  by  preparing  and  implementing  a  social  intermediation  program  that  will  be  part  of  the \nawareness  and  marketing  program  to  promote  housing  finance.  The  role  of  the  NGOs  will  be \nparticularly  important  in  implementing  the  housing  microfinance  component  and  will  enhance  the \nsustainability  of  group-based  long-term  lending  schemes.  The  role  and  contributions  of  these \nintermediary  organizations  and  the  community  group  support  mechanism  are  described  in \nSupplementary Appendix E. \n \n \n \n47. \nThe  qualifying  criteria  for  PFIs  are  outlined  in  Appendix  7.  The  prequalified  PFIs  should \ncomply  with  all  the  required  criteria  to  become  qualified  PFIs  including:  (i)  legality  standards  that \nrequire  PFIs  to  be  established,  organized,  and  operate  in  compliance  with  regulations  of  SBV;  (ii) \nsolvency  standards  that  assess  PFIs  in  terms  of  loan  portfolio  quality  and  capital  adequacy;  (iii) \nliquidity standards that assess the capacity of PFIs in converting assets into cash or liquid assets to \ncover short-term liabilities; (iv) profitability and efficiency standards that assess the capacity of PFIs \nin utilizing resources; and (v) standards on management quality of staff that address whether PFIs \nhave staff with managerial and professional skills in accordance with SBV-stipulated regulations.  \n \nD. \n \n48. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $51.8  million  equivalent,  including  all  the \ninvestments in new and improved housing expected to be generated through the catalytic effect of \nthe  ADB-financed  subloans.  The  cost  estimates  assume  that  the  ULIPHs  receiving  housing  loans \nthrough  the  Project  will  invest  an  amount  equal  to  at  least  30%  of  the  value  of  the  total  housing \nexpenditure.  This  beneficiary  contribution  is  conservative  and  was  based  on  information  from \ncommercial banks currently providing housing loans and on results of household surveys and focus \ngroup  discussions  conducted  during  project  preparation.  Project  cost  and  impact  by  number  of \nbeneficiaries is presented in Appendix 8. \n \nE. \n \n49. \nIt is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $30 million equivalent to finance about 57.9% of the \ntotal project cost. ADB will finance the entire foreign exchange cost of $8.5 million and $21.5 million \nequivalent  (49.7%)  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The  balance  will  be  borne  by  the  PFIs  and  the \nGovernment  as  well  as  by  the  beneficiary  households  from  their  own  resources.  The  PFIs \ncontribution represents 12.3% of the total project cost. This contribution is regarded as important, as \nit means the PFIs share some of the risks associated with lending to the target group. Beneficiaries \nwill contribute some 28.8% of the project cost. The government contribution arises from incremental \nadministration costs associated with project management and operation of HFF. \n\nCost Estimates \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n\fTable 1: Project Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\n \n\n13\n\nItem \n\n \n\n1.

The  relatively  high  level  of  local  currency  support  is \njustified,  as  there  is  insufficient  opportunity  for  ADB  to  achieve  its  objectives  by  foreign  currency \nlending  alone.    The  local  currency  component  of  the  Project  is  high  because  most  housing \nconstruction materials are produced locally, particularly for the upgrading and own-build components \nfor UPHs. \n \n\n                                                 \n6  R1-95: Review for Local Foreign Exchange for Local Currency Expenditures on Projects. \n\n\f14\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n52. \nA project preparatory technical assistance to the Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet \nNam in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 was provided for preparing the Housing \nFinance  Project.7  The  portion  of  the  initial  grant  that  exceeds  $250,000  equivalent  will  be  charged \nagainst the project loan (part C), and recovered from it. \n \nF. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \nThe Executing Agency (EA) for the Project will be SBV. A project steering committee (PSC) \n53. \nwill be established within 3 months of loan effectiveness to oversee overall project implementation. \nThe  PSC,  to  be  chaired  by  a  deputy  governor  of  SBV,  will  comprise  representatives  from  MOC, \nMOF,  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment  (MPI),  MNRE,  and  Ministry  of  Justice  (MOJ).  The  PSC \nwill meet at least quarterly to review progress of the Project, particularly the institutional, policy, and \nlegal aspects. These arrangements are to establish effective links between government agencies for \ncollaboration in developing the housing finance system and implementing the policy and institutional \nreform action plan. \n \n54. \nHFF  will  be  the  PMU  established  within  the  international  credit  projects  management  unit \n(ICPMU) in SBV, to be headed by a project director, who has already been selected. HFF-PMU will \nbe in charge of (i) monitoring the channeling of funds and recovery of the ADB loan; (ii) coordinating \nthe  institutional  support  and  capacity  building  program,  including  recruiting  and  supervising \nconsultants; (iii) developing new financial and savings instruments to attract additional funds to the \nhousing sector; and (iv) advising SBV and the Government on a housing finance strategy and policy \nmatters.  HFF-PMU  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  management,  and  monitoring  of  all  project \nactivities,  including  coordination  with  SBV  departments,  government  ministries,  and  agencies,  and \nPFIs. HFF-PMU will have a staff of at least 15 professionals, including a project director and a full-\ntime  project  manager,  and  supported  by  international  and  domestic  consultants.  A  solid  financial \nmanagement  system  for  HFF-PMU  including  internal  financial  and  accounting  controls  will  be \nestablished before the first disbursement to refinance the subloans under the Project.  \n \n55. \nTo facilitate  implementation,  and  ensure the  credibility  and  standardization  of the mortgage \nfinancing  facility  in  the  marketplace,  a  Housing  Finance  Consultative  Group  (HFCG)  will  assist  in \ncoordinating the Project. Members of the HFCG will initially consist of HFF and the PFIs.  \n \n56. \nProject  implementation  units  (PIUs)  as  separate  housing  finance  units  will  also  be \nestablished  in  each  PFI  to  manage  the  loans  provided  under  the  Project.  The  HFF  role  and \nresponsibilities,  and  organizational  structure  are  described  in  Appendix  9.  A  project  organization \nchart is presented in Appendix 10. \n \n\n \n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n57. \nThe Project will be implemented over 5 years and is expected to be completed by December \n2007.  To  ensure  timely  implementation  and  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  emphasis  on  the \ndisbursement  readiness  of  approved  loans,  HFF  will  prepare  a  detailed  disbursement  plan  for  the \nfirst  year  of  the  Project,  and  thereafter  annually,  based  on  disbursement  plans  submitted  by  PFIs. \nWithin  9  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  HFF  will  develop  appropriate  lending,  monitoring,  and \nreporting procedures for PFIs, and finalize HFC loan agreements with individual PFIs. New housing \nloans are expected to come from qualified PFIs within 12 months of loan effectiveness. During this \nperiod,  the  consultants  will  be  recruited,  will  provide  capacity  building  services  to  HFF,  and  will \n                                                 \n7   This technical assistance was financed initially as a grant, but was subject to the reimbursement arrangements set forth \nin the Board papers on Technical Assistance Operations (Doc. R51-77, dated 20 May 1977) and Streamlining Technical \nAssistance Operations (Doc. R44-88, dated 21 March 1988). \n\n\f \n\n15\n\ndesign  and  implement  training  programs  for  HFF  and  PFI  personnel.  Within  2  years  of  loan \neffectiveness,  the  consultants  will  review  the  operations  of  HFF  and  analyze  the  feasibility  of \ndeveloping  a  plan  and  timetable  for  the  evolution  of  HFF  into  an  independent  MRA.  The  status  of \nHFF and the creation of an independent MRA  will be evaluated during the midterm project review. \nThe project implementation schedule is in Appendix 11. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n58. \nGoods  and  works  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  In  procuring  goods  and  services  to  be  financed  out  from  the  loan \nproceeds,  the  borrowers  will  satisfy  ADB  that  the  procurement  procedures  they  applied  are \nappropriate  in  the  circumstances.  Moreover,  they  will  ensure,  and  certify  to  ADB  if  requested, that \nthe goods and services to be financed are purchased at reasonable prices, account being taken of \nrelevant  factors  such  as  time  of  delivery,  efficiency,  and  reliability  of  goods;  their  suitability;  the \navailability of maintenance facilities and spare parts; and, in the case of services, their quality and \nthe competence of the parties rendering them. Equipment items that are locally available and cost \nless  than  $100,000  equivalent  may  be  procured  through  direct  purchase  in  accordance  with \nprocedures satisfactory to ADB. Indicative contract packaging for equipment and a vehicle for HFF is \npresented in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n59. \nA  total  of  38  person-months  of  international  and  26  person-months  of  domestic  consulting \nservices  will  be  required  for  capacity  building  and  project  implementation  support.  HFF  will  select \nand  engage  all  consultants  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and \nother  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for  selecting  and  engaging  domestic  consultants.  A \nconsulting firm will be engaged by HFF to provide all services required using the ADB quality-and-\ncost-based selection method. Individual consultants may be engaged to provide specific services if \napproved  by  ADB.  Consultants  will  provide  on-the-job  training  to  HFF  officials  implementing  the \nProject. Appendix 12 presents the outline terms of reference for consulting services. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \nThe  Borrower  will  disburse  funds  under  the  Project  through  two  imprest  accounts  (one  for \n60. \nconsulting services  and equipment,  and  the  other for  subloans refinancing), to  be  established  at a \ncommercial bank acceptable to ADB immediately after loan effectiveness. The imprest accounts will \nreceive  an  initial  advance  equivalent  to  the  Borrower\u2019s  anticipated  disbursements  to  HFF  and  to \nsubborrowers  over  a  6  month  period.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be  established,  managed, \nreplenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2001),  as \namended  from  time  to  time.  ADB's  statement  of  expenditures  (SOE)  procedure  will  be  used  to \nliquidate  advances  into  the  imprest  accounts  or  for  reimbursements.  However,  each  individual \npayment  reimbursed  or  liquidated  using  the  SOE  procedure  will  not  exceed  $100,000  equivalent; \notherwise, HFF needs to submit supporting documents. To monitor the subloan repayments by PFIs \nto HFF, the PFIs and HFF need to attach a copy of the subloan repayment account statement as a \nsupport document for further uses of the ADB loan proceeds. \n \n61. \nEach PFI will submit the first 10 subloans to be refinanced by HFC loans individually with all \nrelevant loan appraisal documentation to be reviewed by HFF. Subsequently, HFF will disburse HFC \nloans  to  PFIs  on  the  basis  of  lists  of  subloans  (LOS)  of  not  less  than  D500  million  ($33,333 \nequivalent).  Initially,  the  LOS  will  be  accompanied  by  relevant  loan  appraisal  documentation,  and \nHFF will review and approve the documentation for 5 subloans included in the LOS before approving \nthe disbursement of HFC loans. After the submission of the third LOS by any  individual PFI, HFF, \nwith the concurrence of ADB, may suspend submission by that PFI of loan appraisal documentation \n\n\f16\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nfor  that  PFI  and  rely  on  monitoring  the  appraisal  documentation  during  the  6  monthly  review \nsessions. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \nHFF-PMU  will  maintain  records  and  accounts  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting \n62. \nprinciples,  with  sufficient  details  to  identify  the  type  and  number  of  subloans  financed  by  the  loan \nproceeds. Auditors acceptable to ADB will audit annually all the accounts, financial statements and \nstatements of expenditures and revenues. Audited project accounts, together with the report of the \nauditor,  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  within  6  months  of the  close  of  the fiscal  year.  In  addition to the \naudited project accounts, HFF-PMU  will submit audited annual financial statements throughout the \nlife  of  the  loan.  HFF-PMU  will  also  submit  to  ADB,  not  later  than  6  months  after  the  loan  closing \ndate,  a  completion  report  on  loan  utilization,  subproject  implementation,  and  the  performance  of \nPFIs  and  subborrowers  with  respect  to  onlending  funds  to  ULIPHs  for  housing  purchase, \nimprovement,  and  own-build  housing.  In  addition,  under  the  HFC  loan  agreements  between  HFF \nand each PFI, the PFIs will be required to maintain full records on the subloans. HFF and ADB may \nreview and audit these records on a random basis. \n \n63. \nAn  administration  and  reporting  division  to  be  established  within  HFF-PMU  will  be \nresponsible  for  project  supervision,  monitoring,  and  reporting.  HFF-PMU,  on  behalf  of  MOF  and \nSBV, will submit to ADB a quarterly progress report on commitments and disbursements, problems \nencountered  during  the  quarter  under  review  including  any  material  or  adverse  change  in  the \nProject\u2019s  activities,  actions  taken  or  proposed  to  be  taken  to  remedy  the  problems,  and  expected \nprogress  during  the  following  quarter.  HFF-PMU  will  keep  records  of  all  onlending  activities  under \nthe  Project,  identifying  the  subborrower  or  intermediary;  the  purpose  and  use  of  loans  to  the \nbeneficiaries;  the  size,  term,  and  interest  rate  of  the  subloans  to  subborrowers;  and  the  estimated \nnumber and income levels of ULIPH beneficiaries. The PFI will maintain adequate records to show \nthat ADB funds were used to finance 80% of total lending through PCBs, and 90% of total lending \nthrough CFIs. \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n64. \nThe Project includes a project performance monitoring system (PPMS) to be undertaken by \nHFF  with  the  help  of  consultants.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  a  PPMS  is  implemented  to \nmonitor  and  evaluate  the  technical  performance  and  social  and  economic  benefits  of  the  Project, \nespecially to the ULIPHs, and to ensure the target beneficiaries realize the anticipated benefits. The \nPPMS  will  (i)  monitor  the  Project\u2019s  implementation  performance,  dealing  mainly  with  the  efficiency \nand  effectiveness  of  the  subloan  lending  arrangements;  (ii)  monitor  the  Project\u2019s  operational \nperformance, mainly in relation to the PFIs performance in meeting their respective lending targets; \nand  (iii)  evaluate  the  Government\u2019s  performance  during  and  after  project  implementation.  The  key \nmonitoring indices, in addition to targets and actions outlined in the project framework and the policy \nand institutional action plan, will be (i) internal efficiency of sublending operations, (ii) satisfaction of \nULIPHs\u2019  demand  for  housing  finance;  (iii)  level  of  beneficiary  contribution;  (iv)  sustainability  of \nmicrocredit  CFIs  and  associated  linkages  with  supporting  mass  organizations  (Women\u2019s  Union, \nWorkers\u2019  Union,  Veterans  Union)  and  NGOs;  and  (v)  socio-economic  impact  on  the  ULIPH \nbeneficiaries. In the first quarterly report for each calendar year, the Government will provide ADB \nwith information produced under the PPMS. \n \n65.  Within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  HFF,  assisted  by  the  consultants,  will  finalize  and \nrefine the project performance indicators and establish baseline conditions in consultation with PFIs \nand other stakeholders for the purpose of project monitoring and evaluation. This will include socio-\neconomic  data  to  monitor  and  measure  project  impacts.  SBV  and  HFF  will  refine  the  PPMS \nframework, confirm achievable goals, firm up monitoring and recording arrangements, and establish \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nsystems  and  procedures  within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness.  Baseline  and  annual  data  will  be \nreported  at  regular  intervals  by  HFF,  which  will  be  responsible  for  analyzing  and  consolidating  the \ndata  through  its  management  information  system.  The  PPMS  will  be  designed  to  permit  adequate \nflexibility  to  adopt  remedial  action  related  to  project  design,  schedule,  activity,  and  development \nimpacts.  \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n66. \nADB will conduct reviews every 6 months from the date of loan effectiveness during the first \n2  years.  The  reviews  will  assess  matters relating  to  the  implementation  of the  subloan  refinancing \ncredit  line  to  PFIs,  including  percentage  of  loan  proceeds  disbursed;  the  type  of  subborrowers \n(particularly  household  income  levels)  and  category  of  subprojects  (house  purchase,  house \nupgrade,  and  own  build  house);  interest rates charged  to  PFIs  and  subborrowers;  loan  repayment \nperformance;  and  appropriateness  of  the  eligibility  criteria  for  qualified  PFIs.  The  findings  of  the \nreviews  will be taken into account in further implementation of the Project. PFIs will be required to \nprovide  subborrower  socioeconomic  data  on  income,  type  of  housing  activity  financed,  lending \nterms, and other aspects determined by HFF. In addition to regular reviews to be undertaken during \nthe project implementation period, the Government and ADB will jointly  carry out a comprehensive \nmidterm  review  approximately  2  years  and  half  after  loan  effectiveness,  to  monitor  progress  and \nachievements,  and  particularly  to  agree  with  the  Government  on  a  program  and  timetable  for \ncreating  an  independent  MRA  as  the first  step  in  moving  HFF  along the  path to  a fully  functioning \nSMF. Outline terms of reference for the midterm review mission are in Appendix 13.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n \n \nThis  Project  will  support  the  establishment  of  a  sustainable  housing  finance  market  in  Viet \n67. \nNam that would ultimately mobilize substantial capital for housing finance and facilitate the long-term \nestablishment of a strong mortgage-based collateral market to provide housing loans to all sections \nof  the  population.  The  Project  will  directly  assist  137,000  urban  low-income  and  poor  persons  to \nimprove  their  housing,  health  standards,  and  economic  well-being  by  giving  them  access  to  long-\nterm  housing  finance.  ULIPH  housing  financing  mechanisms  are  expected  to  develop  through  the \nformal  financial  sector,  leading  to  a  gradual  shift  in  housing  finance  from  the  constrained  and, \nsometimes  expensive,  informal  finance  sector  to  formal  housing  finance  institutions.  The \nGovernment\u2019s high-level targets for the number of housing units and space upgrade standards may \nprove  more  reachable  as  the  formal  housing  finance  market  develops.  A  strong  housing  finance \nmarket will create demand for more appropriate housing \u2013 in terms of size, standards, and quality \u2013 \nwhich will, in turn, lead to more demand-driven housing development activities and the emergence \nof market-driven housing development companies. \n \n68. \nA  sustainable  housing  finance  market  will  be  a  source  of  small-  and  medium-sized \ndevelopment finance and will unlock underutilized capital currently tied up in residential property that \nis inaccessible because there is no established instrument for property mortgage as collateral. The \nProject  will  also  have  an  impact  on  the  construction  industry  and  stimulate  the  production  of  local \nconstruction materials. This activity will, in turn, increase employment in the construction sector, one \nof the most labor-intensive industries. Employment could also increase in the banking sector. \n \n69. \nThe  development  of  the  housing  finance  subsector  will  facilitate  linkages  between  the \nhousing  and  the  finance  sectors.  This  linkage  will  create  a  flow  of  long-term  credit  funds  into  the \nsubsector that will allow the creation of outflows of long-term mortgage loans to householders. The \nProject will provide initial long-term credit funds to test long-term mortgage lending mechanisms that \nwill  in  turn  attract  additional  long-term  credit  funds  into  the  subsector.  The  impacts  of  the  housing \nfinance subsector on the housing and finance sectors will foster a strengthened and more market-\ndriven approach to housing creation in both sectors, particularly for ULIPHs. \n\n\f18\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nThe Project will help mobilize private savings and channel them toward the housing sector. \n70. \nThe  limited  public  resources  raised  by  the  Government  could  then  be  used  as  leverage  for \nexpanding  private  savings.  The  Project  will  assist  the  Vietnamese  banking  sector  in  raising  long-\nterm resources, implementing sound working methods, and offering adequate savings products and \nlong-term mortgage instruments to their customers. In the medium term, the Project will contribute to \nthe development of the conditions for the creation of efficient housing finance primary and secondary \nmarkets comprising (i) a well- functioning titling and mortgage registration system; (ii) standardized \nmortgages; (iii)  proper  housing  loan  and  mortgage  origination  techniques;  (iv)  proper  housing  loan \nservicing  techniques;  and  (v) existence  of  a  conduit  (MRA)  that  will  make  housing  mortgages \nattractive to potential investors.  \n \n71.  With the availability of affordable long-term funding, ULIPHs will (i) reduce their vulnerability \nto  natural  disasters  by  having  a  safer  space  to  live  in,  (ii)  increase  the  residential  and  household \nstability  due  to  the  possession  of  a  valuable  asset,  (iii)  have  an  alternative  source  of  income  in \nemergencies  by  using  the  house  as  collateral  to  obtain  additional  credit,  and  (iv)  reduce  their  rent \ncosts.  Improved  housing  will  create  a  healthier  environment,  particularly  for  women,  children,  and \nstudents  who  spend  much  of  their  time  in  the  house.  The  health  of  family  members  and  the \neducation  performance  of  students  could  improve.  Work  productivity  can  also  increase  for  people \nthat use their own house as the work place, as is common in Viet Nam. \n \nRisks. Several risks associated with project implementation and sustainability were identified \n72. \nand assessed during project preparation. They include the following: (i) project subloans may go to \nhouseholds  in  income  groups  above  the  target  ULIPHs;  (ii)  PFIs  are  unwilling  to  lend  to  ULIPHs \nbecause the latter are considered credit risky; (iii) ULIPHs do not want to borrow from PFIs; (iv) HFF \ndoes  not  establish  efficient  management  and  monitoring  systems;  (v)  ULIPHs  do  not  repay  the \nsubloans to PFIs; (vi) PFIs do not repay the loans to HFF; (vii) the issuance of LURCs is slow; and \n(viii)  implementation  of  the  policy  and  institutional  action  plan  is  slow.  Each  risk  was  carefully \nassessed, taking due account of lessons learned from similar projects in developing countries. Risk \nmitigation  measures  were  identified  and  built  into  the  project  implementation  procedures.  The \nProject will not trigger ADB\u2019s policies on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples since it will \nfocus on mortgage lending to individual ULIPH and strengthening and capacity building for housing \nfinance in urban areas. \n \n73. \nRisk Mitigation. A number of mechanisms will be incorporated in the Project to ensure that \nsubloans are initiated by PFIs in accordance with the proposed project components, and reach the \ntarget ULIPHs. (i) Household income eligibility criteria for subloan borrowers are incorporated in the \nHFC  loan  agreements  between  HFF  and  PFIs.  As  household  incomes  of  ULIPHs  are  difficult  to \nassess  and  validate,  this  criterion  is  supplemented  by  limiting  the  maximum  subloan  size  and  the \ntotal cost of the house to individual ULIPH borrowers. These measures will make it very unlikely that \nsuch  subloans  will  attract  higher-income  borrowers.  (ii) Subloan  interest  rates  will  be  at  financial \nmarket  interest  rates  without  any  subsidy.  This  criterion  will  ensure  that  higher  income  borrowers \ngain no financial advantage, even if they try to finance a small part of their housing finance needs \nfrom project subloans. (iii) The housing finance awareness and marketing campaign will explain the \nadvantages  of  mortgage  lending  and  clarify  procedures  so  as  to  reduce  ULIPHs\u2019  reluctance  to \nborrow  and  to  manage  risks.  (iv)  The  potential  establishment  of  a  Government-backed  mortgage \nguarantee  fund  or  a  mortgage  insurance  scheme  will  correct  commercial  banks\u2019  perception  of \nULIPHs  as  risks.  (v) The  development  of  housing  deposit-loan  products  will  assist  PFIs  to  assess \nmore  objectively  the  credit  value  of  ULIPH  customers  and  will  reduce  the  risk  of  lending  to  them. \n(vi) The  establishment  of  an  effective  management  information  system  by  HFF  will  mitigate  risks \nassociated with nonpayment of subloans by ULIPH borrowers and repayment of the HFC loans by \nPFIs.  The  HFC  loans  and  ULIPH  subloans  will  be  monitored  monthly  and  recovery  procedures \noutlined in the HFC loan agreement between HFF and PFIs. Consultants will be recruited to assist in \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nestablishing the system. PFIs will bear the credit risks of ULIPH subloans and will partially contribute \nwith their own funds. (vii) Risks associated with any slowing of policy and institutional reforms will be \nmonitored through the activities of the PSC, regular EA reports required by the Project and project \nreview missions. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government and SBV will be requested to give \n\n74. \nthe following assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nThe  Government  will  undertake  the  actions  described  in  the  policy  and  institutional \naction plan (Appendix 3) within the agreed upon time frame, and will advise ADB of \nits  progress  through  the  quarterly  reports.  Lack  of  sufficient  progress  in  complying \nwith  the  plan  in  a  timely  manner,  in  the  opinion  of  ADB,  will  lead  to  suspension  of \ndisbursement of the funds.  \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  qualified  PFIs  will  comply  with  the  eligibility \ncriteria  agreed  upon  by  the  Government  and  ADB,  including  the  prudential  norms \nissued by SBV.

External  assistance  has  focused  on  four  areas:  (i)  land  administration \nreform, (ii) housing sector, (iii) urban development, and (iv) financial and banking sector.  \n \n2. \nIn  land  administration  reform, the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  has \nbeen assisting the Government in legal reform in the housing sector. The Swedish International \nDevelopment Assistance (Sida) has been assisting General Department of Land Administration \n(GDLA)  through  the  Viet  Nam-Sweden  Cooperation  Program  on  Land  Administration  Reform \n(CPLAR). The first phase of CPLAR, which started in 1997 and was completed in 2001, focused \non  land  registration,  cadastral  mapping,  land-use  planning,  land-use  mapping,  land  valuation, \nand  land  information  systems.  It  has  implemented  training  activities  in  those  areas  in  nine \nprovinces.  Sida  is  currently  discussing  the  second  phase  of  the  project  with  the  Government. \nNew  Zealand  Asian  Development  Aid  Facility  has  been  assisting  GDLA  in  assessing  and \nrecommending improvements to the Land Law and its administration and developing a pilot land \nand property valuation system with greater emphasis on rural areas. \n \n3. \nThe World Bank funded a project for implementation of land policies during 1998-1999 \nthat focused on (i) registration procedures and implementation of a simple land policy reflected \nin a stable land law, (ii) implementation of a unified registry of real estate property transactions, \nand  (iii)  creation  of  an  effective  mortgage  system.  The  World  Bank  is  currently  considering  a \ncadastral mapping systems project component for the cities participating in its future Viet Nam \nUrban Upgrading Project (VUUP) under preparation. This project component would support the \nproject cities (Ho Chi Minh City, Haiphong, Can Tho and Nam Dinh). Such inteventions will be \ninstrumental in accelerating the grant of land use right (LUR) and the issuance of land use rights \ncertificates  (LURC)  and  building  ownership  and  land  use  certificates,  as  one  of  the  major \nimpediments  to  the grant  of  LUR  is  the  large  amount  of  work  needed  for  a  detailed  survey  of \neach parcel of land. \n \n4. \nIn  the  housing  sector,  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  produced  a  report \non  the  evolution  of  and  recommendations  for  the  sector  in  1999,  including  a  component  on \nhousing finance. The Japan International Cooperation Agency has been assisting the Ministry of \nConstruction  on  housing  policies  since  1999  providing  a  seconded  full-time  housing  policy \nspecialist. The World Bank, under a 2001 Cities Alliance project to enhance access of the urban \npoor and vulnerable groups in Viet Nam to basic infrastructure and housing, included such tasks \nin  the  housing  sector  as:  (i)  assessing  constraints  faced  by  the  urban  poor  in  housing  and \ninfrastructure;  (ii)  reviewing  recent  and  ongoing  urban  upgrading  programs;  (iii) developing \nnational  strategy  on  scaling  up  programs  and  providing  better  housing  and  services  for  the \nurban poor; and (iv) developing a detailed action plan for a selected city. The proposed VUUP \nunder  preparation  has  two  proposed  housing  sector  components:  (i) microfinance  capital  for \nlow-income housing upgrading credits \u2013 a credit line will be set up in each project city to provide \nmedium-term financing to house upgrading in the project areas; and (ii) appropriate resettlement \nhousing  for  low-income  households  and/or  serviced  sites  for  self-build  housing.  Financing  will \nalso  be  made  available  to  prepare  sites  serviced  with  basic  infrastructure  so  that  relocated \nhouseholds  can  build  housing  themselves.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB), World  Bank, \nUnited Nations Development Programme, and most bilateral sources are extensively involved in \nurban  infrastructure  projects,  and  many  of  which  have  resettlement  housing  components  that \nmay provide prospective home loan borrowers for the Project. \n \n\n\f22 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nExternal assistance in the banking and financial sector has been predominantly through \n5. \nADB, World Bank, and International Monetary Fund. Assistance is focused on creating a sound \nbanking system in Viet Nam. The key elements of the banking sector reform program: (i) State \nBank of Viet Nam (SBV) is leading a D30 trillion ($2 billion equivalent) reform and restructuring \nprogram over the next 5 years; (ii) D7 trillion ($0.47 million equivalent) will be spent on settling \nbad debts of state-owned enterprises (SOENs); (iii) SBV is to strengthen the risk protection fund \nand set up an asset management company to buy bad bank loans; first step is for the banks to \nestablish their own asset management units; (iv) the above capital is to come from commercial \nbanks, nonconvertible Government bonds, public bills, and foreign aid; (v) the average capital of \ncommercial  banks  will  be  increased  from  the  current  $70  million  to  $200  million  in  a  3-year \nprogram involving independent auditing of the banks; (vi) SBV was to shut down or merge the \nless  viable  of  48  mainly  small  joint-stock  banks;  (vii) the  Government  will  halt  politically \nmotivated  lending  to  SOENs,  except  when  a  Government  guarantee  is  provided  in  special \ncases; and (viii) the restructure or closure of 5,500 inefficient SOENs that consume more than \nhalf of all available bank credit but employ only 10% of the workforce.

However, \nthe Government has not \nadopted a formal housing \nfinance orientation (policy \ndocument). \n\nJurisdictional rules \nregulating loan and \nsecurity components of \nmortgage finance are not \nclearly defined in Viet \nNam. While the Land Law \nand Civil Code permit \nmortgages and right to \nsell land in case of loan \ndefault, this right is \nseldom exercised due to \nthe confusion of \nlegislation on mortgages, \nwhich allows too much \nflexibility for the judges to \ninterpret and apply the \nlaw in a manner that can \neffectively defeat the \nvalue of the security. \n\n \nPrepare a National Housing \nFinance Orientation (policy \ndocument) that includes principles, \nobjectives, roles, and \nresponsibilities of Government \nagencies, commercial banks, and \nmicro-finance institutions and \nspecial measures to reach low-\nincome and poor households.

Household  surveys  were  conducted  in  Hanoi  and  eight  other  urban \ncenters,  covering  1,000  households  with  5,100  household  members.  Twelve  focus  group \ndiscussion  sessions  were  conducted  in  five  urban  centers  with  participants  including  (i)  low-\nincome  housing experts of  Government  agencies, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and \nmass  organizations  (e.g.,  Youth,  Women\u2019s  and  Trade  Unions);  (ii)  project  management  unit \n(PMU)  members  of  savings-credit  group  projects;  (iii)  ULIPHs  with  member  experience  of \nmicrocredit deposit savings and lending groups; (iv) ULIPHs who have previously participated in \nresettlement  or  slum  upgrading  schemes  (e.g.,  Binh  Trung  Dong  Ward  Ho  Chin  Minh  City \n(HCMC) residents, HCMC canal relocation schemes, Hanoi housing redevelopment schemes); \n(v)  ULIPHs  currently  involved  with  resettlement  or  slum  upgrading  processes,  but  not  yet \nrelocated; and (vi)  ULIPH  people  with  a  stable  income  base.  The  main  secondary  information \nsources were official statistics from the Population Census and Vietnam Living Standard Survey \n(VLSS). \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe primary objective of the surveys was to profile ULIPHs to establish their willingness \nto  invest  in  housing  and  affordability  of  the  investment.  The  surveys  involved (i) assessing \nULIPH  socioeconomic  characteristics,  their  housing  needs,  and  their  potential  demand  for \nhousing finance; (ii) developing an understanding of ULIPH capacity to absorb housing finance; \n(iii)  identifying  existing  sources  and  constraints  related  to  housing  finance  for  ULIPHs; \n(iv) investigating forms of collateral for ULIPH housing finance subloans; (v) assessing technical \nimprovements;  and \nand  capacity-building  support  required \n(vi) assessing  the  impact  of  improved  housing  on  poverty  reduction  and  the  empowerment  of \nwomen. \n \nThe objectives of the focused group discussions,  based on experiences of savings and \n3. \ncredit  group  projects  and  resettlement  projects,  aimed  to  obtain  the  following  information: \n(i) saving capacity and housing expenditure of  ULIPHs; (ii) affordability of housing to  ULIPHs; \n(iii) commercial  bank  accessibility  for  ULIPH  housing  finance;  (iv)  advantage,  disadvantage, \ndemand, and needs of  ULIPHs  related  to housing issues; and (v) experiences of savings and \ncredit group activities. \n \nC. \n \n\nloan-financed  housing \n\nKey Survey Findings \n\nfor \n\n1. \n\nHousehold Demographics \n\n \n4. \nThe  ULIPHs  showed  demographic  characteristics  similar  to  those  reported  in  the \nPopulation  Census  and  VLSS  statistics.  The  average  household  size  was  5.4  persons,  with \n66%  of  households  having  5  or  more  resident  members.  Some  60%  of  ULIPH  residents  had \nfinished high school and an additional 10% had progressed to graduate or postgraduate level. \nMore  than  one  half  of  ULIPHs  were  income  earners  slightly.  More  than  30%  were  in \nnonprofessional  jobs  and  just  less  than  25%  were  professionals.  Some  20%  were  retired  and \none-fourth were less than 15 years of age. Some 90% of ULIPHs had resided in their existing \nhousing for more than 10  years. The monthly household income profile was concentrated in the \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n29 \n\nD1 million-2 million band, accounting for almost 70% of ULIPHs surveyed. Only 2% had monthly \nhousehold  incomes  above  D3.5  million  and  20%  had  incomes  below  D1  million  per  month. \nExpenditure  levels  tended  to  be  lower,  indicating  that  savings  does  occur,  with  some  35%  of \nULIPHs surveyed reporting monthly expenditures below D1 million. \n \n\n2. \n\nExisting Housing Characteristics \n\n \n5. \nHousing  occupied  by  the  surveyed  ULIPHs  was  significantly  concentrated in the small \nsize  range,  with  some  65%  occupying  housing  units  with  less  than  50  square  meters  (m2) of \nliving space, mostly less than 35 m2 (45% of ULIPHs interviewed). Most housing had little land \narea outside the house; slightly less than 70% of ULIPHs had a land area less than 50 m2. The \nresults were validated by other surveys. A survey of ULIPHs in the Tan Hoa-Lo Gom area of Ho \nChi Min City (2000) revealed that some 60% of ULIPHs were living in housing less than 35 m2. \nMore  than  90%  of  ULIPHs  housing  units  were  older  than  10  years,  predominantly  of  semi \npermanent materials, and without LURC. While access to social services (kindergarten, school, \nhealth  care,  market,  shops)  was  regarded  as  satisfactory,  some  60%  of  ULIPHs  surveyed \nregarded the public water supply and drainage and wastewater system services as poor.  \n \n\n3. \n\nHousing Demand and Preferences \n\n \nThere is a significant demand for new housing, with some 75% of ULIPHs requiring new \n6. \nhousing  or  housing  improvements,  predominantly  in  attached  houses  (60%  of  ULIPHs),  and \ngenerally in the same area (40% of ULIPHs) or district of city (additional 20% of ULIPHs). The \nlower down the income scale, the higher is the preference for home improvements rather than \nnew house purchase. Around 80% of ULIPHs indicated their existing house structures were bad \nand  75%  had  undertaken  some  form  of  dwelling  improvement  in  the  past  (40%  once,  20% \ntwice, and 15% more than twice). The majority of ULIPHs (55%) preferred housing units in the \nsize range 30-50 m2, while 35% preferred units larger than 50 m2. \n \n7. \nFocus  group  ULIPHs  indicated  a  past  experience  and  a  strong  interest  to  invest  in \nhousing  as  an  asset  to  generate  income  through  at-home work and to use capital gains from \nlandholdings  purchased  and  their  existing  small  houses  to  purchase  and/or  build  larger  and \nimproved housing. There was clear evidence that, through the informal real estate and housing \nfinance  market  segments,  some  ULIPHs  are  actively  engaged  in  buying  and  selling  land  and \ntheir  houses  to  upgrade  to  improved  housing.  If  ULIPHs  had  improved  access  to  long-term \nhousing finance loans, they would use this source to accelerate their current slow progress with \nimproving their housing circumstances. The resultant spin-off would be that the existing housing \nstock would be released to ULIPHs lower down the chain, inducing the generally lower income \nlevel ULIPHs to purchase their own house or upgrade from housing of poorer condition. \n \n\n4. \n\nHousing Finance Sources and Accessibility \n\n \n8. \nSources  for  housing  finance  come  from  savings  (30-60%),  loans  without  interest  from \nrelatives and friends, and a maximum one third from bank loans. Some households spend more \nmoney  than  their  capacity  and  estimated  budget  for  a  new  house  and  need  to  borrow  from \nmoneylenders (D2 million-5 million) at high interest rates (5-20% per month). Where there are \nno savings-credit groups, ULIPHs in the lower income levels find it difficult to save and repay (at \nlevel of D2 million-3 million per year). Few ULIPHs have experience with commercial banks and \nthink they are difficult to access for both deposit and borrowing purposes. The reasons for not \nusing  bank  loans  were  nonavailability  of  collateral  (55%  of  ULIPHs)  and  the  complicated \nprocedures  (30%  of  ULIPHs).  There  was  significant  interest  from  ULIPHs  in  obtaining  more \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n30 \n \n\ninformation  on  bank  lending  for  housing  and  a  strong  desire  for  public  information  programs \noutlining housing finance loan opportunities and procedures. \n \n\n5. \n\nWillingness to Borrow Using Housing Loans \n\n \n9. \nSome  one  third  of  ULIPHs  interviewed  expressed  a  current  interest  to  access  bank \nhousing finance for loans in the range D5 million-200 million, with an average loan level at D47 \nmillion, for a new house and D20 million for house upgrading.  Because repayment capacity is \nlimited,  most  ULIPHs  do  house  upgrading  step  by  step.  Many  ULIPHs  prefer  3-5  year  loan \nterms for housing upgrading and 5-10 years for new houses. Poor households prefer a loan size \nof D5 million-10 million for step-by-step house upgrading. ULIPHs supported a one-third deposit \ncondition for a housing finance loan.  \n \n\n6. \n\nCapacity to Repay Loans \n\n \n10. \nULIPHs prefer to repay housing loans as soon as they can, as there is a strong culturally \ningrained obligation to repay debt in Viet Nam. This preference has been influenced by the lack \nof long-term loan availability for housing finance. Repayments of 30% of income are generally \nconsidered to leave sufficient income for food and other necessities, and with the current short-\nterm financing for housing in Viet Nam, much higher percentages ?  up to 50% of income ?  are \ncommon.  Currently,  typical  loan  sizes  of  D40  million-50  million  are  serviced  by  ULIPHs,  and \nthose with a salary or stable income can easily repay a D15 million loan over 3 years, but it is \nless  easy  for  those  who  have  a  small  business  without  stable  income.  Preferred  monthly \nrepayment levels indicated by ULIPHs interviewed were an average level up to D1.2 million in \nsome areas and an overall average of D780,000. \n \n\n7. \n\nGender Issues \n\n \nTraditionally, a husband is the household head, though, some 32% of all households in \n11. \nViet Nam have a female head. Women are the ones who manage household expenditure and \nsavings, while men earn money and are responsible for housing. Women play the role of saving \nand repaying, but have not been  able to obtain loans. Most ULIPHs thought it is better if loans \nare  issued  in  both  husband  and  wife's  names  to  prevent  the  husband  from  improperly  using \nand, sometimes, transferring land use rights certificates (LURCs) without the consent of the wife \nor  other  members  of  the  household.  At  present,  women  are  more  involved  in  savings-credit \ngroups  and  improve  their  knowledge  and  skills.  Women  have  lower  levels  of  education  and \ncommunication  skill,  so  they  feel  inadequate  in  discussing  business  matters  with  banks, \nespecially  if  their  names  do  not  appear  on  the  LURC  or  building  ownership  and  land  use \ncertificate  (BOLUC).  Savings-credit  programs  supported  by  the  Women's  Union  (WU)  and \nnongovernmental  organizations  (NGOs)  have  strongly  encouraged  the  role  of  women  in loan \nactivities. Such programs have helped residents, especially women, to improve their knowledge \nand skills in savings and repayment management. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n31 \n\nPOVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n\nLinkages to Country Poverty Analysis \n\nA.  \n \nThe  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy  recognizes  the  multifaceted \n1. \nnature of poverty and poverty reduction. Urban housing programs and housing finance for the poor \nand  low-income  groups  are  referred  to  in  the  context  of  efforts  and  programs  to  reduce  urban \npoverty.  Emphasis  is  on  (i)  upgrading  urban  poor  areas,  (ii)  providing  land  and  infrastructure, \n(iii) formulating small-scale credit and savings programs; and (iv) mobilizing communities. \n \n2. \nIt  is  recognized  that  the  housing  sector  has  the  potential  to  bring  the  efforts  together  in \nurban  upgrading  programs,  building  on  individual  household  efforts.  The  Government's  role  is  an \nenabling one ?  facilitating the provision of land and land tenure, neighborhood infrastructure and \naccess to credit. Lack of credit ?  directly income -generating activities, as well as credit to develop \nthe  household's  asset  base  ?  has prevented  urban  low  income  and  poor households (ULIPHs) \nfrom  breaking  out  of  property.  Lack  of  finance  at  terms  of  more  than  1-2  years  has  hindered \nULIPHs  from  undertaking  priority  housing  improvement  and  affordable  new  housing.  Except  for \nbeneficiaries of limited Government housing projects, ULIPHs do not have access to any housing \ncredit beyond very short-term finance, often at exorbitant terms and conditions. \n \nHousing  finance  currently  exists  in  rudimentary  form,  with  some  banks  and  microcredit \n3. \ninstitutions  providing  a  limited  volume  of  short-term  housing  loans.  The  Project  will  support  the \ndevelopment of the housing finance subsector by providing participating financial institutions (PFIs) \nhousing  subloans  to  refinance  house  and  housing  upgrade  to  ULIPHs  with  monthly  incomes of \nD0.3 million-3.5 million. ULIPHs in this range comprise about 50% of all urban households in Viet \nNam. \n \nB. \n \n4. \nIn 1999, Viet Nam's urban population was estimated at 17.9 million (4.0 million households \nand 23.5% of national population). Urban population growth is expected to be 3.0% per year for the \nperiod 2000-2010. Viet Nam living standard survey (VLSS) indicate 9% of urban households were \nbelow the poverty line in 1997/98, but the figure is believed to be an underestimate, as the survey \ndid  not  cover  unregistered  migrants  (of  which  there  are  significant  numbers  in  the  larger  urban \nareas), as indicated by participatory poverty assessments carried out. By these assessments, the \nproportion  of  urban  households  below  the  poverty  line  is  around  15%.  Such  households  are \nclassified  as  poor,  while  households  with  incomes  above  the  poverty  line,  but  below  the  average \nincome,  are  classified  as  low-income  for  the  purpose  of  this  project.  Nationally,  there  are  two \npoverty lines in use, one based on the above VLSS analysis, and one used by Ministry of Labor, \nInvalids  and  Social  Affairs  (MOLISA).  For  urban  areas,  these  poverty  lines  were  estimated  at \nD873,000  and  D750,000  per  household  per  month  in  early  2002,  while  the  average  household \nincome was estimated at D3,500,000 per month, for the purpose of the Project. \n \n5. \nGovernment's achievements in reducing poverty are very significant, with poverty levels in \nboth  urban  and  rural  areas  now  reduced  significantly  (according  to  VLSS  data,  from  25%  in \n1992/93 to 9% in 1997/98 for urban areas, and from 66% to 45% in rural areas in the same years \n?  But as noted above, urban poverty incidence is underestimated). Still, some elements of poverty \nreduction  have  lagged,  while  some  dimensions  of  poverty  have  become  more  acute.  With  the \ncontinuing  significant  difference  in  population  growth  between  urban  and  rural  areas  (national \nannual average population growth rate projected at 1.1% per year for 2000-2001 and at 3.0-3.2% \nin urban areas), poverty is becoming urbanized along with these demographic changes. \n\nPoverty Analysis \u2013 Proposed Classification: Poverty Reduction \n\n\f \n32 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \n\nPoverty  related  to  housing  in  urban  areas  has  not  been  reduced;  urban  poor  households \n6. \n(UPHs) still face significant bottlenecks in access to (i)  land use rights (LURs), (ii) community-level \ninfrastructure, and (iii) medium- to long-term finance for shelter. Insufficiently serviced urban land \nfor  buildings  has  come  on  the  market  but  issuing  the  land  use  rights  certificates  (LURCs)  and \nbuilding ownership and land use certificates (BOLUCs) has lagged behind the demand spurred by \nurban population growth. \n \n7. \nWith growing pressure on urban land and the absence of comprehensible and enforceable \nplanning regulations, access to minimum infrastructure has increasingly become problematic in the \nmajor  urban  centers,  particularly  in  HCMC  and  Hanoi.  The  lack  of  appropriate  financing \nmechanisms  has  denied  UPHs  access  to  affordable  housing.  Housing  conditions  for  a  growing \nsegment  of  the  population  have  deteriorated  despite  Government  efforts  to  provide  low-income \nhousing  through  the  Ministry  of  Construction  (MOC)  project-based housing development model. \nThe  units  produced  by  this  model  were  insufficient  to  make  a  difference,  particularly  since  the \nrelatively  large  unit  sizes  make  them  attractive  to  both  middle-income  groups  and  ULIPHs,  and \nthere  are  problems  with  inappropriate  locations  of  the  units.  Private  sector  developer  housing  is \nlimited and out of reach for ULIPHs. Thus, the overwhelming majority of ULIPHs continue to rely on \ntheir own efforts to provide shelter. \n \n8. \nA  critical  challenge  is  to  overcome  the  indicated  bottlenecks  in  access  to  land,  local \ninfrastructure, and services,1 and to appropriate housing finance loans. The Project will support the \ninitial  stages  of  development  of  a  targeted  housing  finance  system,  and  will  provide  housing \nfinance  credit  (HFC)  loans  to  PFIs  to  refinance  house  and  house  upgrading  subloans  to  ULIPHs \nwith  monthly  incomes  of  D0.3  million-3.5  million.  A  variety  of  housing  options  are  affordable  to \nhouseholds in this income range, as demonstrated by the affordability analysis in Appendix 6. \n \n9. \nThe  participating  commercial  banks  (PCBs)  will  focus  primarily  on  ULIHs  in  the  D0.75 \nmillion-D3.5 million monthly household income range who can afford to finance a new or existing \nhousing unit at a cost up to D190 million at 70% financing, or could upgrade their house for a cost \nup  to  D20  million,  at  commercial  interest  rates  and  maturity  of  up  to  20  years.  The  microfinance \ncommunity-based  financial  institutions  (CFIs)  will  focus  on  UPHs  below  the  poverty  line  in  the \nD300,000-D750,000 monthly income range. Affordable options for this household segment are (i) a \nbuilding materials loan up to D15 million subproject cost; and (ii) smaller home-improvement loans \nup to D15 million subproject cost, at commercial interest rates and terms of 5-10 years. The Project \nwill  benefit  approximately  137,000  urban  low-income  and  poor  people.  Around  32%  of  the \nbeneficiaries (43,700) will be below the poverty line. \n \n10. \nThe Project will focus on the major urban areas. It is likely that the impact of the Project will \nbe  felt  particularly  in  HCMC  and  Hanoi  where  (i)  urban  poverty  is  highly  significant,  (ii)  local \nauthorities have already started to address land and infrastructure issues, and (iii) which have the \nonly exclusively urban-based and well-developed CFIs. \n \n11. \nFor the UPH, reliance will be placed on group-supported or group-based savings and loans \nstrategies, in line with the current practice of already active CFIs. A major support mechanism to \nensure adequate participation of eligible groups (and particularly women heads of households) is \nthe involvement of the Women's Union (WU) in forming solidarity groups. Households will generally \n\n                                                 \n1   Local  authorities  in  urban  centers  have  become  increasingly  aware  of  such  issues,  and recently implemented slum \nupgrading  and  began  reviewing  sites -and-service  resettlement  schemes.  Planning  standards  are  being  modified \n(downward)  to  make  them  more  responsive  to  target  group  requirements  and  affordable,  and  to  make  them  less \nattractive to competing demand from more affluent social groups. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n33 \n\nborrow  individually,  but  in  solidarity  groups  of  five  borrowers,  supported  by  the  WU  in  the  ward \nconcerned (through a center leader supporting on average eight such groups in the ward). The WU \ncenter leader facilitates initial loan preparation and documentation, and acts as a collection agent \nfor CFI branches. Other mass organizations, such as the Veterans Union, Youth Union, and Labor \nUnion, as well as selected nongovernment organizations, will play similar roles. \n \n12.  Where  appropriate,  this  group-supported  approach  will  be  supplemented  by  group-based \nlending,  in  which  the  CFI  will  lend  to  groups,  with  the  groups  themselves  being  responsible  for \ndealing  with  individual  savings  collection,  lending,  and  loan  repayments.  In  many  cases,  this \nmeans  intermediation  to  existing  informal  rotating  savings  and  credit  associations,  which  have \nlimited experience in the major urban centers. \n \nSuch  group-based  mechanisms  will  be  reinforced  by  the  introduction  of  a  new,  largely \n13. \ngroup-based savings for housing loan programs by the CFIs, in which 2-3 years prior savings will \nbe  required  to  provide  guaranteed  access  to  a  housing  loan  of  at  least  four  times  the  built-up \nsavings.

The loan will be from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources and will have a term of 32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years. A service charge of 1% will be levied on the loan during the \ngrace period and 1.5% during the amortization period. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will enter into \na financing agreement1 with the State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV) acting as Executing Agency, where \nthe housing finance facility (HFF) will be set up as an independent project management unit. Funds \nwill flow from MOF to SBV/HFF in dong which will be the currency for all subsequent fund flows. \nThe  funds  for  the  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  building  component  will  be  provided  by \nMOF to HFF as a grant.

HFF  will  have  a  fixed  management  fee  for \nhandling  the  housing  loan  funds.  PFIs  will  be  free  to  set  the  onlend  interest  rate  based  on  the \nnegotiation between PFIs and their subborrowers. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nHFF  will  retain  a  1%  management  fee  for  handling  subloan  disbursement  to  PFIs.  This \nmanagement  fee  will  be  retained  exclusively  for  the  use  of  HFF  in  a  special  account  under  its \ncontrol,  to  be  used  (i)  to  cover  the  operating  costs  of  HFF-PMU (including training and capacity \nbuilding for HFF-PMU and PFIs), (ii) to cover the cost of conducting marketing campaigns to urban \nlow-income  and  poor  households  (ULIPHs)  to  advise  them  of  the  Project,  (iii)  to  accumulate \nreserves for working capital when HFF becomes an independent entity, and (iv) to relend to project \nbeneficiaries. The management fee will be calculated at  1% annually on the outstanding subloans, \nand  payable  quarterly  to  HFF  from  PFI  subloan  repayments  to  HFF.  MOF  will  bear  the foreign \nexchange  risk,  from  the  remaining  interest  payments  from  PFIs  to  HFF,  after  deducting  the  HFF \nmanagement fee. \n \nC. \n\nAccounts, Disbursement, and Payment Procedures \n\n4. \nHFF  will  be  required  to  keep  at  least  four  separate  accounts.  Two  separate  imprest \naccounts  will  be  opened  for  (i)  loan  fund  disbursement  for  consulting  services  and  equipment \npurchases,  and  (ii)  subloan  disbursements.  Funds  will  flow  from  MOF  to  these  imprest  accounts. \nPayments  from  the  subloan  imprest  account  will  flow  to  PFIs  to  refinance  housing  subloan \npackages approved by HFF. In addition to the two imprest accounts, HFF will also maintain at least \ntwo  other  accounts.  One  of  such  accounts  will  be  established  to  hold  quarterly  repayments  on \nloans from the PFIs. Payments out of this account will be to PFIs to refinance further subloans, with \nfunds  from  this  account  to  be  disbursed  before  drawing  down  funds  from  the  subloans  imprest \naccount. The other account will be established to hold quarterly interest payments on HFC loans \nfrom the PFIs. HFF will deduct and retain the management fee from this account.  \n \n5. \nMOF will deposit an initial amount from the ADB loan into the imprest accounts. Each PFI \nwill  submit  the  first  10  subloans  to  be  refinanced  by  HFC  loans  individually, and all relevant loan \nappraisal documentation to be reviewed by HFF. Subsequently, HFF will disburse housing finance \ncredit (HFC) loans to PFIs, for subloan refinancing, on the basis of lists of subloans (LOS) of not \nless  than  D500  million.  Initially,  the  LOS  will  be  accompanied  by  relevant  loan  appraisal \ndocumentation, and HFF will review and approve the documentation for 5 subloans included in the \nLOS before disbursement of HFC loans is approved. After the submission of the third LOS by any \nindividual  PFI,  HFF,  with  the  concurrence  of  ADB,  may  suspend  submission  by  PFI  of  loan \nappraisal  documentation  and  rely  on  monitoring  the  appraisal  documentation  during  review \nsessions that will be held at least twice a year.  \n \n6. \nEach  PFI  will  be  allocated  a  guaranteed  credit  line  up  to  $2  million  for  participating \ncommercial banks (PCBs) and up to $1 million for community-based financial institutions (CFIs) for \ndrawdown over 3 years. There will be a residual HFC loan pool for the balance of loan funds to be \navailable for any PFI after it has used its guaranteed credit line, on a first-come first-served basis. \nHFF  will  review  individual  PFI  drawdown  of  the  guaranteed  credit  line  annually,  and  where \ndrawdown  has  been  less  than  30%,  HFF  may  revise  the  credit  line  and  reallocate  it  to  the  HFC \nloan  pool.  The  maximum  total  accumulated  principal  amount  for  any  PFI  will  be  $7  million.  This \nmechanism  will  provide  some  measure  of  guarantee  for  PFIs  to  commit  to  development  and \nmarketing programs and at the same time provide an incentive to originate subloans quickly. \n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n38 \n \n\nPFI Qualify Criteria \n\nParticipating Financial Institutions (PFIs) \n\nThe  project  funds  and  the  subloan  repayments  will  provide  a  revolving  line  of  credit  for \n7. \nhousing finance for additional end users. Repayment of funds from HFF to MOF will be made twice \na year to correspond with the Government\u2019s loan repayments to ADB. \n \nD. \n \n8. \nSix PCBs and two CFIs were selected as prequalified PFIs, which can qualify to participate \nin  the  Project,  provided  they  comply  with  all  the  conditions  established.  Selection  was  based  on \ntheir  past  experience  in  housing  finance,  commitment  to  participate  in  the  Project,  and  financial \nindicators.  The  prequalified  PCBs  are  the  Asia  Commercial  Bank  (ACB),  the  Bank  of  Investment \nand  Development  of  Viet  Nam  (BIDV),  Housing  Development  Bank  of  Mekong  Delta  (MHB),  Ho \nChi  Minh  City  Housing  Bank  (HHB),  Industrial  and  Commercial  Bank  of  Viet  Nam  (ICBV),  and \nSaigon  Commercial  Joint  Stock  Bank  (Sacombank).  Prequalified  CFIs  are  the  People\u2019s Credit \nFunds (PCF) network, and Viet Nam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (VBARD). Other \nCFIs could be prequalified after the completion of the legal framework for microfinance institutions \nthat  the  Government  will  prepare  in  the  following  months.  Independent  auditors  will  prepare  a \ndetailed due diligence analysis before the PFIs are fully qualified and can access project funds. \n \nE. \n \nThe qualifying criteria to be applied to PFIs are outlined in Table A7.1. Some criteria vary \n9. \nslightly  between  PCBs  and  CFIs.  The  broad  qualifying  standards  follow.  (i)  Legality  standards \nrequire  PFIs  to  be  established,  organized  and  operate  in  compliance  with  regulations  of  SBV. \n(ii) Solvency  standards  assess  PFIs  in  terms  of  loan  portfolio  quality  and capital adequacy. Two \nmajor  financial  indicators  reflect  the  loan  portfolio  quality:  total  overdue  balance  over  total  loan \nportfolio  and  net  bad  debts  over  total  loan  portfolio.  Capital  adequacy  is  reflected  by  the  own \ncapital  or  net  equity  over  risk  assets:  the  lower  the  overdue  rate  and  the  higher  the  capital \nadequacy  ratio,  the  more  solvent  the  PFI  will  be.  (iii) Liquidity standards assess the capacity of \nPFIs  to  convert  assets  into  cash  or  liquid  assets  to  cover  short-term  liabilities,  indicated  by  the \ncurrent  ratio  and  the  medium-  and  long-term  loan  portfolio  over  medium-  and  long-term sources. \n(iv)  Profitability  and  efficiency  standards  assess  the  capacity  of  PFIs  in  utilizing  resources,  which \nare  reflected  by  return  on  equity  (ROE)  and  return  on  assets (ROA). (v) Management quality of \nstaff  standards  address  whether  PFIs  have  staff  with  managerial  and  professional  skills  in \naccordance with SBV-stipulated regulations.  \n \n10. \nThe  eligibility  for  qualification  of  PFIs  and  rates  defined  are  derived  from  international \nstandards and the prudential norms issued by SBV (e.g., capital adequacy, liquidity, classification \nand  provisioning  for  nonperforming  loans,  and  lending  concentration). HFF is entitled to consider \nthe  refinement  of  specific  qualifying  criteria  in  concurrence  with  ADB  in  the  process  of  PFI \nqualification.  When  calculating  the  financial  ratios,  the  results  of  the  last  3  completed  financial \nyears will be used, to take account of abnormal annual fluctuations. The criteria were applied to the \nprequalified PFI during appraisal and the results are in Table A7. 2.  \n \nF. \n \n11. \nQualified PFIs will be required to sign a housing finance credit (HFC) loan agreement with \nHFF  before  housing  loan  refinancing  for  beneficiary  subloans  can  be  accessed.  The  HFC  loan \nagreement  will  define  (i)  eligible  housing  subborrowers;  (ii)  subloan  terms  and  conditions; \n(iii) subloan management; and (iv) audit, supervision, and reporting requirements.  \n \n\nPFI Loan Arrangements \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n39 \n\nBefore  starting  disbursements,  each  PFI  will  establish  a  specially  dedicated  project \n12. \nimplementation  unit  (PIU)  to  manage  all  aspects  of  the  HFC  loan  and  subloan  origination  and \nmanagement procedures. \n \nG. \n \n\nPFI Loan Terms \n\n1. \n\nEligible Subborrowers and Subloan Purpose \n\n \nEligible housing subborrowers will be defined in the loan agreements as households having \n13. \na monthly income in the range of D350-750,000 for CFIs and D0.75-3.5 million for PCBs. Eligible \nsubloan purposes for PCBs will be housing purchase with a maximum subloan value of D70 million \n(maximum house price of D100million) and small home improvement with a maximum value of D20 \nmillion. For CFIs, eligible loans will be for small home improvement and own-build housing with a \nmaximum  cost  of  D15  million.  The  maximum  subloan \nfor  new  housing  and  home \nimprovement/upgrade will be equal to 70% of the house value or house upgrade cost.  \n \nDuring  project  preparation,  extensive  discussions  were  undertaken  with  potential  PFIs, \n14. \nhousing  construction  companies,  housing  development  agencies,  as  well  as  surveys  and  focus \ngroup discussions with urban low-income and poor households (ULIPHs) to get a cross section of \ninformation  and  views  on  appropriate  ULIPH  loan  eligibility  criteria  and  maximum  levels.  The \nmaximum housing component levels were set based on appropriate existing and proposed ULIPH \nhousing  projects  successfully  completed  and  sold,  detailed  feasibility  studies  of  planned  ULIPH \nprojects and the experience of ULIPHs purchasing such housing. Subloan terms were developed \nin consultation with potential PFIs, and reflect the experience of existing ULIPH housing loans from \nbanks specializing in this category of borrowers, and the views of ULIPHs surveyed (see Appendix \n4 \u2013 Summary of Survey Findings, for details). \n \n\n2. \n\nCapital Contribution and Risk \n\n \n15. \nPFIs  will  provide  from  their  own  resources  capital  equal  to  20%  of  the  subloans  to \nborrowers from PCBs and 10% of the subloans to borrowers from CFIs, reflecting the lower capital \nbase of most microfinance CFIs. This contribution is regarded as important, as it means PFIs share \nsome  of  the  risk  associated  with  lending  to  the  target  group.  Subborrowers  will  contribute  some \n30%  of  their  housing  costs,  ensuring  they  have  significant  equity  in  their  housing  project.  In  line \nwith the move into a commercially driven domestic market economy, all risks inherent to subloans \nmade  by  PFIs  will  be  borne  by  the  PFI  that  originates  the  subloan.  Upon  the  failure  of  a  PFI  to \nrepay  the  principal  and  or  interest  due  on  a  HFC  loan,  HFF  will  have  the  right  to  call  either  the \noutstanding  balance  of  the  PFI\u2019s  entire  HFC  loan  portfolio  or  the  specific  HFC  loan  or  loans  in \ndefault  (based  on  the  circumstances  of  that  default  and  the  financial  condition  of  the  PFI)  and \nsuspend the right of the PFI to obtain further HFC loans. \n \n\n3. \n\nInterest Rates \n\n \n16. \nHFC loans from the HFF to PFIs will be at a variable interest rate adjusted quarterly and set \nat the weighted average of all time deposits in the banking system as computed and informed by \nSBV at the end of each  quarter. Interest rates for subloans will be in accordance with the interest \nrate policy of each PFI. Subborrowers will be given a choice of fixed rate (prevailing variable rate \nas  defined  above  plus  a  premium)  for  the  term  of  the  subloan,  or  a  variable  rate periodically \nadjusted. \n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n40 \n \n\n4. \n\nCollateral \n\n \n17. \nSubloans through  PCBs  will  be  mortgage  based,  requiring  subborrowers  to  provide  land \nuse rights certificates (LURCs) or, where appropriate, building ownership and land use certificates \n(BOLUCs) for collateral. Microfinance CFI subborrowers will generally provide individual or group \nguarantees  or  similar  collateral  (both  physical  and  moral  guarantees),  though  the  provision  of \nLURC and BOLUC will be encouraged for subloans more than D10 million.  \n \n\n5. \n\nOther Subloan Conditions \n\n \n18. \nterm of the subloans.  \n\n \n\nThe maximum subloan term would be 20 years.

To address this constraint, banks specializing in housing \nfinance  have  three  alternatives:  (i)  be  heavily  capitalized,  (ii)  raise  institutional  savings  on  the \ncapital market, or (iii) create long-term saving instruments to offer to their clients. The first option \nis  presently  being  addressed  in  the  banking  sector  reform  program  through  individual  bank \nrecapitalization  plans.  The  second  option  will  develop  with  the  emergence  of  pension  funds, \ninsurance  funds,  and  long-term  institutional  investors  in  Viet  Nam.  The  third  option  can  be \nimmediately  implemented  should  the  banks  develop  innovative  loan-savings  products  and \nimprove  their  marketing.  Vietnamese  banks  have  limited  experience  in  the  retail  sector  and \nmarketing  savings  products  that  could  satisfy  people  presently  resorting  to  land  purchase  or \ndeposits for the purpose of capital appreciation. Banks have to offer their customers new savings \nproducts,  most  likely  (i)  linked  to  loan  access;  (ii)  incorporating  a  higher  interest  differential  for \nlong-term savings accounts; (iii) with multiple interest rate levels; and (iv) more sophisticated than \nsimply  based  on  a  single  interest  rate.  The  deposits  raised  by  banks  are  still  too  short  term \ndespite  the  incentive  provided  by  State  Bank  of  Viet  Nam  (SBV),  which  does  not  impose  any \nreserve requirement on deposits of more than one year. \n \n2. \nThe core  of  the  strategy  in  Viet  Nam\u2019s  housing  finance  sector  should  be  to  boost  the \nmobilization  of  private  savings  and  channel  them  toward  the  housing  sector.  The  limited  public \nresources  raised  by  the  Government  should  be  used  only  as  leverage  for  expanding  private \nsavings,  for  instance,  through  the  provision  of  urban  infrastructure.  The  short-term  strategic \napproach  should  aim  at  assisting  the  whole  Vietnamese  banking  sector  in  raising  long-term \nresources,  implementing  sound  working  methods,  and  offering  adequate  savings  products  and \nlong term mortgage instruments to their customers to develop the primary mortgage market. The \nmedium-term  strategic  approach  should  aim  at  creating  a  secondary  market  facility  (SMF)  in \nhousing finance. The creation of a SMF requires the existence of an efficient primary mortgage \nmarket  whose  main  prerequisites  are  (i)  a  stable  macroeconomic  environment,  (ii)  a  well-\nfunctioning  titling  and  mortgage  registration  system,  (iii)  mortgages  that  are  attractive \ninvestments,  (iv) standardization  of  mortgages,  (v) proper  origination  techniques,  (vi)  proper \nservicing  techniques,  and  (vii)  existence  of  potential  investors.  Not  all  these  prerequisites  are \nsatisfied  in  Viet  Nam  and  there  is  a  need  to  prepare  both  the  conditions  for  a  more  efficient \nprimary market and the conditions for an emerging secondary mortgage market in the near future. \n \n3. \nThe development of an efficient housing mortgage market in Viet Nam, then, requires the \nestablishment  of  a  specialized  agency,  the  housing  finance  facility  (HFF)  that  will  be  initially \nplaced within SBV. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan will provide initial resources to HFF \nto start its operations on a pilot basis with the objective of developing the national housing finance \nsector. The establishment of HHF with support from an ADB loan will lead to the (i) development \nof an efficient primary mortgage market accessible to ULIPHs by  institutionalizing the standards \nand procedures of the HFF within the participating financial institutions (PFIs); and (ii) building up \nof basic requirements for the emergence of a secondary mortgage market in the future. \n \n4. \nThis institutional creation and development process provides the primary reason why HFF \nneeds  to  be  an  apex  institution  and  distinguishes  the  revolving  fund  activities  of  HFF  from  a \nproject  involving  only  subloan  distribution  and  recycling  activity.  Setting  up  revolving  funds  in \neach PFI would diffuse housing finance sector policy and development activity and would not lead \nto the creation of a sustainable housing loan refinancing market. Establishing an apex HFF within \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nMandate and Objectives \n\nan  existing  commercial  bank  would  also  inhibit  the  development  of  a  sustainable  housing  loan \nrefinancing  market  because  of  (i)  the  conflict  of  interest  between  that  bank\u2019s  apex  wholesale \nbanking  function  and  its  retail  housing  finance  function;  and  (ii)  the  inhibiting  influence  of \ncompetitive commercial banks disclosing retail housing finance activities to a competitor. Ideally, \nHFF  should  be  a  separately  incorporated  and  independent  agency,  but  as  this  is  a  pilot  loan \ntesting mechanism, it is appropriate to initially establish HFF inside SBV, as the implicit authority \nof  SBV  will  ensure  sound  principles  of  effective  governance  and  facilitate  the  acceptance  of \nprudential  operating  standards.  The  relocation  of  HFF  will  be  examined  in  the  project  midterm \nreview,  and  the  necessary  steps  will  be  to  transform  it  into  an  independent  mortgage  refinance \nagency (MRA) agreed upon before the end of project implementation. \n \nB. \n \nThe mandate of HFF is to develop a sound and self-sustaining housing finance system in \n5. \nViet  Nam  by  establishing  a  network  of  housing  finance  outlets  across  the  country.  Its  primary \nobjectives  will  be  to  (i)  promote  and  assist  the  housing  finance  sector,  (ii)  provide  advisory \nservices and technical assistance in operational policies to PFIs, (iii) mobilize new resources for \nthe housing sector, and (iv) address legal and institutional constraints to the development of the \nhousing finance system. \n \nC. \n \n6. \n \n\nHFF will perform the following functions: \n\nFunctions \n\nBe a project management unit with responsibilities for managing the ADB loan; \n\nRefinance subloans originated by PFIs; \n\n(iii) \n\nPromote prudential techniques and procedures in the housing finance sector; \n\nDevelop and institutionalize standardized mortgage loan terms and originating and \nservicing procedures; \n\nDevelop  a  management  information  system  (MIS)  that  will  allow  for  a  rapid \nclearance and refinance mechanism; \n\nAssist  the  banking  sector  to  develop  (a)  short-,  medium-,  and  long-term hedging \ninstruments  to  facilitate  term  lending  and  minimize  debt  management  risk  in  the \nmortgage  market,  (b)  industry  driven  rules  and  regulations  on  trading  and \nsettlement of bundled mortgage assets between HFF and PFIs; and (c) a MIS that \nwill ensure timely clearance/settlement and monitoring; \n\n(vii)  Monitor  the  PFIs  targeting  of  ULIPHs,  particularly  in  relation  to  resettlement  and \n\nother housing projects included in the HFF database; \n\n(viii)  Develop a housing finance consultative group (HFCG) to act as an advisory body\u2013 \n\nwith representatives of the PFIs; \n\nAssist  PFIs  and  the  government  to  develop  and  promote  new  deposit  and  loan \nproducts to increase access and the affordability of housing finance to ULIPHs; \n\nAssess  possibilities  for  creating  a  mortgage  guarantee  fund,  or  a  mortgage \ninsurance scheme that would benefit ULIPHs; and \n\n(i) \n \n(ii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n47\n\n(xi) \n\nPrepare  the  basis  for  the  future  creation  of  a  sustainable  secondary  housing \nmortgage  market  to  attract  additional  capital  to  the  sector,  including  the  future \npossibility of issuing bonds to be purchased by institutional investors. \n\nStatus of HFF \n\nHFF Tasks as PMU of the Project \n\n \nD. \n \n7. \nHFF  will  be  an  autonomous  operating  unit,  with  its  own  operational  budget,  financial \naccounts, suitable equipment, and permanent staff under the authority of a Project director. The \ndirector of HFF will report to the governor of SBV.  \n \nE. \n \n8. \nHFF will be responsible for managing the ADB loan revolving fund, as the apex institution \nfor  subloan  refinancing  and  repayments  through  the  PFIs,  with  the  default  risk  of  subloans \nremaining with the PFIs. HFF will be the focal point for ADB and the local organizations in respect \nof all matters relating to implementation, management, and coordination of the Project, including \n(i)  qualification  of  PFIs  and  monitoring  their  financial  performance;  (ii)  approving  PFIs'  subloan \napplications  according  to  housing  finance  credit  (HFC)  loan  agreement  terms;  (iii)  monitoring \nproject implementation and preparing reports; (iv) paying principal and interest to the Ministry of \nFinance (MOF) for repayment of the ADB Loan; (v) carrying out studies and surveys pertaining to \nhousing finance development in the country; (vi) selecting, contracting and supervising capacity \nbuilding and institutional strengthening consulting and training services; (vii) providing support to \nSBV and MOF in policy matters relating to housing finance; (viii) carrying out  accounting for all \nproject activities, including bookkeeping, disbursement to PFIs, and recording of collections and \nrepayments;  and  (ix)  carrying  out  procurement  activities  under  the  Project.  A  more  detailed \noutline of selected specific tasks to be undertaken by HFF follows. \n \n\n1. \n\nContractual Housing-Savings Schemes \n\n \nSuch  schemes  are  an  effective  way  to  finance  housing  through  a  mechanism  where  an \n9. \nULIPH  undertakes  to  save  a  specified  amount  over  a  prescribed  period  of  time  and  the  PFI \nundertakes  to  grant,  at  the  end  of  that  period,  a  loan  whose  amount  and  term  depend  on  the \namount of savings accumulated. The advantage of such a scheme is that it reduces the element \nof uncertainty, both for the PFI, which can more easily project its financial commitments, and for \nthe ULIPH, who knows for certain that it can obtain a housing loan at the end of the agreed upon \nperiod.  A  specific  task  of  HFF  will  be  to  facilitate  the  development  and  introduction  of  such \nschemes through a consultative and product development support program to PFIs. \n \n\n2. \n\nMicrocredit Deposit Savings Schemes \n\n \n10. \nThe  rationale  of  saving  for  housing  loan  products  derives  from  the  principles  that \n(i) private deposits are the backbone of any financial institution; (ii) households perceive housing \nas the first objective worth saving for; (iii) knowing the savings behavior of the future borrowers \nhelps in assessing the personal credit risk; and (iv) by linking prior savings and borrowing by the \nsame household, it is possible to use the savings as collateral for the loan. Applying this rationale, \nmicrocredit  organizations  lend  for  home  improvement  to  groups  of  poor  households  on  the \nstrength of prior collective group savings. The groups are responsible for dealing with individual \nsavings  collection,  lending,  and  loan  repayments  themselves.  In  many  cases,  this  means \nintermediation, with cost savings for the microcredit intermediary institution, as it has to deal with \nonly  one  (larger)  loan  for  the  group,  rather  than  with  a  number  of  smaller  loans  for  individuals. \nThe outreach is better and, even if the net cost of the additional layer as reflected in the interest \nrate for the end user is higher, credit still reaches the households at more favorable terms than \nthose of informal sources of funds accessible to them. A specific task of HFF will be to facilitate \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\ndeveloping  and  introducing  such  schemes  through  a  consultative  and  product  development \nsupport program to PFIs. Common features of these products include: (i) 2-3 years prior savings \nwill be required to provide guaranteed access to a housing loan of at least four times the built-up \nsavings; (ii) credit terms will be market based, with a medium- to long-term repayment period; and \n(iii) the savings-for-loan product will generally be group-based, supported by mass organizations \nsuch as the Women\u2019s Union and by nongovernment organizations (NGOs.)  \n \n\n3. \n\nAwareness and Marketing Campaign \n\n \nULIPHs  have  limited  knowledge  of  and  access  to  PFIs,  particularly  participating \n11. \ncommercial banks (PCBs). To maximize access to the project subloans at PFIs, it is important to \nensure that ULIPHs are aware of the Project and the ease of access to such subloans. In addition \nto the normal loan product marketing that PFIs will undertake at their own expense, HFF needs to \nprovide  a  generic  housing  finance  awareness  and  marketing  program.  This  program  will \nspecifically target ULIPHs and will aim to inform them of the (i) purpose and benefits of long-term \nhousing loans; (ii) cost and affordability of long term loans through PFIs; (iii) ULIPH eligibility for \nsubloans; (iv) eligible housing finance  subloan  purposes,  maximum  loan  levels,  and  other  loan \nconditions;  (v)  procedures  for  obtaining  information  and  applying  for  such  loans;  (vi)  contact \ndetails  for  obtaining  further  information;  and  (vii)  a  step-by-step  checklist  for  determining  their \neligibility for a project subloan and obtaining approval for such subloan. Such an awareness and \nmarketing program will emphasize simplicity and ease of access. \n \n\n4. \n\nHFF Housing Finance Demand Database \n\n \n12. \nThere  are  a  large  number  of  housing  development  projects  to  resettle  ULIPHs,  upgrade \nshanty  areas,  provide  major  employee  housing,  and  improve  government  employee  housing  in \nthe urban areas of Viet Nam. As no central database of such projects exists, it is essential that \nHFF  develop  such  a  database  and  assist  PFIs  to  directly  target  ULIPHs  associated  with  such \nprojects.  These  projects  have  a  number  of  advantages:  (i)  land  and  infrastructure  service  costs \nfor  resettlement  housing  areas  are  generally  included  in  the  external  assistance  projects  or \ncontributed by the relevant People\u2019s Committee agency from their own funds, thus reducing total \nhousing costs if they are passed on to the resettled households; (ii) they usually have designated \nhousing  resettlement  areas  and  a  choice  of  appropriate  housing  options;  (iii)  most  resettled \nhouseholds  receive  compensation  at  replacement  cost,  providing  a  contribution  to  the  deposit \nrequirements  for  housing  loans  if  they  decide  to  improve  their  houses;  and  (iv)  often  they  have \nsocial survey inputs, community consultation, and savings credit schemes to prepare households \nfor relocation. These groups include a significant proportion of the project target ULIPHs. Few, if \nany, belong to higher income groups, thus eliminating a potential leakage of project loan funds to \nincome groups above the low-income band.  \n \n\n5. \n\nMortgage Guarantee Fund/Mortgage Insurance Scheme  \n\n \n13. \nPFIs  have  concerns  about  the  risks  of  lending  to  ULIPHs,  particularly  regarding  the \nsecurity  of  household  earnings.  This  concern  could  be  limited  through  either  a  Government- \nbacked mortgage guarantee fund, or through a mortgage insurance scheme. It could involve joint \ncontributions by Government and PFIs to build up a fund that could be accessed to pay part or all \nof  the  residual  debts  arising  from  defaulting subloans. A mortgage insurance scheme could be \nestablished through an insurance company willing to provide a special housing finance protection \npolicy  that  covers  housing  subloan  payments  for  subborrowers  who  experience  earning  losses \ndue to job loss, temporary or permanent disability, or death as well as property loss due to fire. \nThis  is  a  premium-based  insurance  product  and  the  monthly  premium  can  be  added  to  a \nsubborrower\u2019s  subloan  repayment  schedule.  The  HFF  will  conceive  and  design  features  of  a \nmortgage insurance scheme targeting low-income households. \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n49\n\nHFF Organizational Structure and Staff  \n\nF. \n \n14.   HFF will be managed by a project director and a full-time project manager and staffed with \nat least 15 full-time professional staff including the project director and project manager, and five \nsupporting staff.

The  objectives \nare  to  (i) assess  progress  in  implementing  the  Project,  mainly  dealing  with  the  efficiency  and \neffectiveness  of  the  subloan  lending  arrangements;  (ii)  monitor  the  Project\u2019s  operational \nperformance, mainly in terms of the PFIs performance in meeting their respective lending targets; \n(iii)  assess  the  development  of  the  primary  mortgage  market  and  the  suitability  of  creating  an \nindependent  mortgage  refinance  agency  (MR A),  at  the  latest,  before  the  end  of  project \nimplementation;  (iv)  assess  progress  in  the  implementation  of  the  policy  and  institutional \ndevelopment plan; and (v) formulate, within the updated housing finance sector and related sector \npolicy  environment  and  other  changing  circumstances  at  the  time  of  the  review,  the  necessary \ncourses of action for the Government and ADB to ensure successful project implementation. \n \nThe specific scope of the midterm review may be reexamined and modified as appropriate \n2. \nin  light  of  the  actual  progress  made  and  issues  identified  during  the  first  half  of  project \nimplementation. Prior to the review, the project steering committee (PSC) will, with the assistance \nof the housing finance facility project management unit (HFF-PMU) and consultants, develop and \nundertake  a  preliminary  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS)  benefit  monitoring \nevaluation survey to determine the (i) internal efficiency of sublending operations, (ii) satisfaction of \nthe demand for housing finance from urban low income and poor households (ULIPHs); (iii) level of \nbeneficiary  contribution;  (iv)  sustainability  of  community-based  microcredit  financial  institutions \n(CFIs)  and  associated  linkages  with  supporting  mass  organizations  (Women\u2019s  Union,  Workers\u2019 \nUnion, Veterans Union, nongovernment organizations [NGOs], etc.); and (v) socioeconomic impact \non  the  ULIPH  beneficiaries.  In  addition,  the  survey  will  include  feedback,  through  focus  group \nintermediary \ndiscussions  or  other  mechanisms, \norganizations  involved  with  microfinance  mechanisms,  on  the  project  benefits  as  well  as  specific \nactions  that  will  enhance  the  Project\u2019s  impact.  The  results  of  the  survey  will  be  incorporated  into \nthe midterm review findings \n \nB. \n\nfrom  beneficiary  households,  PFIs,  and \n\nSpecific Terms of Reference  \n \n1. \n\nPolicy Review \n\n \n3. \nThe  review  will  carefully  examine  progress  made  by  the  Government  in  key  policy  areas \nimpacting  on  the  development  of  the  housing  finance  sector,  namely,  (i)  developing  a  national \nhousing finance orientation (policy); (ii) increasing the number of urban land use certificates issued \nand  improvement  in  registration  procedures;  (iii);  improving  in  the  legal  procedures  for  calling  up \ndefaulting  mortgages  and  selling  mortgaged  land  and  houses;  (iv)  improving  the  mortgage \nregistration system; (v) improving the valuation system for land and houses; (vi) improving banking \nsector  performance;  (vii)  promoting  household  savings  in  PFIs  for  housing  purchase  and \nimprovement; (viii) attracting additional funds to the housing sector; and (ix) introducing a mortgage \ninsurance  scheme  or  mortgage  guarantee  fund.  In  addition,  the  review  will  examine  compliance \nwith other conditions and covenants of the Project. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Performance \n\n \n4. \nThe  review  will  (i)  compare  the  actual  implementation  performance  with  the  agreed-upon \nimplementation  program  and  will  determine  the  Project\u2019s  success  to  date  in  meeting  the \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n \n\nestablished targets; (ii) critically assess the achievements and limitations of the Project based on \nthe  first  2  \u00bd  years\u2019  performance  and  identify  existing  and  possible  constraints  impeding  project \nperformance;  and  (iii)  formulate  and  recommend  appropriate  countermeasures  and  modifications \nto overcome the identified weaknesses and deficiencies. \n \n\n3. \n\nPerformance of PFIs \n\n \n5. \nThe  review  will  evaluate  PFI  compliance  with  the  participation  criteria,  including  the \nbeneficiary household income range, lending terms, and use of subloan funds. The effectiveness \nof  these  criteria  and  of  the  PFIs  to  increase  ULIPH  access to housing finance will be assessed, \nand modifications will be proposed as required. The drawdown rate of the PFIs will be evaluated \nand, if insufficient, changes will be proposed to increase the funding available to ULIPH borrowers. \n \n\n4. \n\nHFF Evaluation \n\n \n6. \nThe review will assess the progress of HFF toward a MRA as a first step along the path to a \nfully functioning secondary market facility (SMF). The review will consider (i) the functioning status \nof  the  titling  and  mortgage  registration  system;  (ii)  quality  and  standardization  of  mortgage \ndocumentation;  (iii)  procedures  and  quality  of  mortgage  origination  in  PFIs;  (iv)  PFI  housing  loan \nmanagement  and  defaulting  loan  procedures;  (v)  level  of  development  of  the  primary  mortgage \nmarket;  (vi)  status  and effectiveness of  legal procedures for calling up defaulting mortgages and \nselling mortgaged land and houses; (vii) existence of mortgage market potential investors or long- \nterm finance credit lines; and (viii) stage of mortgage refinancing activity attained by the HFF. The \nreview  will  examine  the  merits  of  keeping  HFF  as  an  independent  operating  unit  within  SBV, \nconsider  alternative  locations  and  the  desirability  of  establishing  it  as  an  independent  MRA,  and \nrecommend a timetable for this evolutionary process. A timetable will be agreed upon by ADB and \nthe  Government  to  establish  it  as  a  separate  independent  MRA,  at  the  latest,  at  the  end  of  the \nproject implementation period. \n \n\n5. \n\nReview of Implementation Arrangements \n \na. \n\nConsultants\u2019 Performance \n\n \n7. \nThe review will assess (i) the consultant\u2019s performance in terms of work output in relation to \ntheir  terms  of  reference,  and  assistance  provided  to  HFF  and  PFIs  among  others;  (ii)  the \nrelationship  among  the  consultants,  HFF,  government  agencies,  and  PFIs;  (iii)  the  consultant\u2019s \noverall  compliance  with  the  agreed-upon  terms  of  reference;  and  (iv)  any  further  needs  for \nconsulting  services.
