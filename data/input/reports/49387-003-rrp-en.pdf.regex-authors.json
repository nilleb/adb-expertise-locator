I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Second Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Tourism \nInfrastructure for Inclusive Growth Project. This is one of three associated loans and grants; the \nothers are for Cambodia and the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR).1 \n \n2.  The  project  will  help  transform  secondary  towns  in  the  GMS  eastern  corridor  into \neconomically inclusive, competitive tourism destinations by improving transport infrastructure, \nurban services, and capacity to sustainably manage tourism growth. It will expand trade in \nservices by promoting cross-border tourism and deepen GMS and Association of Southeast Asian \nNations (ASEAN) regional cooperation and integration. About 168,000 residents of Hoa Binh, \nNghe An, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, and Thua Thien Hue provinces are expected to directly benefit \nfrom climate-resilient infrastructure development, improved urban green space, cleaner public \nbeaches, and better access to economic opportunities. Project areas and investments are \nprioritized in the ASEAN Tourism Strategic Plan and GMS Tourism Sector Strategy.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Sector overview and performance. About 80% of global travel is intraregional. Forecasts \nsuggest that Asia and the Pacific will be the world\u2019s fastest-growing region through 2030, when it \nwill receive 535 million tourists, or 30% of the global market share. In 2016, ASEAN countries \nreceived 116 million international tourists, up 42% compared with 2011. ASEAN arrivals are \nexpected to grow 5.1% per year and reach 187 million in 2030.3  \n \n4.  Within ASEAN, Viet Nam, Cambodia, and the Lao PDR closely cooperate to promote \nregional  tourism  standards,  tourism  investment,  and  multicountry  tours  that  connect  their \neconomies with larger, more affluent regional markets. Collaboration with neighboring countries \nhelped boost Viet Nam\u2019s international tourist arrivals to 10.0 million in 2016, after increasing by \njust over 10% annually since 2009. Top source markets include the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(27%), the Republic of Korea (15%), and Japan (7%). Tourism contributes nearly 5% to Viet \nNam\u2019s gross domestic product and generates 72% of service exports, directly supporting 1.9 \nmillion jobs\u2014the majority held by women in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The \ngovernment  targets  a  10%  gross  domestic  product  contribution  by  2020,  when  tourism  is \nexpected to generate $32.5 billion and sustain 1.05 million new jobs. \n \n5.  Government efforts to upgrade gateway airports, transnational railways and highways, \nand secondary roads to boost travel and trade are supported by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and other development partners. Regional policies to liberalize transport services and ease \ncross-border tourism complement physical infrastructure investments.4 For example, Viet Nam \npermits prearranged tourist visas on arrival for 182 countries and grants 15-day tourist visa \n                                                \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided transaction technical assistance to help design the project and prepare \nthe Greater Mekong Subregion Tourism Sector Strategy 2016\u20132025.

Key challenges. Even with these strengths and opportunities, in 2016 Viet Nam ranked \n6th in ASEAN and 67th among 136 economies evaluated in the World Travel and Tourism \nCompetitiveness  Index,  mainly  because  secondary  destinations  lack  quality  transport \ninfrastructure,  urban  services,  and  tourist  service  infrastructure.  Other  underlying  problems \ninclude inadequate infrastructure maintenance, weak tourism planning, and ineffective destination \nmarketing,  which  collectively  undermine  the  business-enabling  environment  for  tourism. \nConsequently, Viet Nam\u2019s share of ASEAN international tourist arrivals is only 8.6%. Another \nconsequence of underinvestment in secondary destinations is imbalanced tourism growth within \nthe country, with Ha Noi, Ho Chi Minh City, Da Nang, and Quang Ninh province\u2019s Ha Long Bay \narea receiving more than half of international tourist arrivals and corresponding benefits.5 \n \n7.  Climate vulnerability. Secondary towns in Viet Nam\u2019s segment of the GMS eastern \ncorridor are vulnerable to climate change and natural disasters. Risks include stronger and more \nfrequent typhoons, coastal storm surges, and intensifying rainfall and flooding. These risks are \nexacerbated by limited capacity to integrate adaptation and mitigation solutions. Countering \nclimate change and natural disasters requires finance and knowledge to retrofit and construct \nclimate-resilient infrastructure and promote resource efficiency programs. Public awareness to \npromote environmentally friendly tourism services and emissions offsets are also needed. \n   \n8.  Project response. To help remove these constraints, the project builds on ADB\u2019s ongoing \nGMS Tourism Infrastructure for Inclusive Growth Project in Viet Nam (2014\u2013) and the successful \nGMS Sustainable Tourism Development Project (2008\u20132014) by selectively financing climate-\nresilient transport infrastructure, urban infrastructure and service improvements, and capacity \nbuilding for better destination management, all of which is needed to boost tourist arrivals and \nspending in secondary destinations.6 Prioritized investments are (i) road improvements to link \nsmall  towns  with  rural  community-managed  tourist  attractions;  (ii)  ferry  ports  to  increase \npassenger handling capacities and give private operators the facilities needed to expand water \ntransport and recreation services; (iii) sanitation and drainage improvements, seawalls, and \ncoastal revetments in flood-prone areas; and (iv) capacity building to support the implementation \nof ASEAN tourism standards and strengthen infrastructure operation and maintenance (O&M). \nThe integrated design will assist project provinces attract more and higher-spending visitors, thus \ncontributing to more balanced tourism growth and employment-intensive SME development.   \n \n9.  Strategic Fit. The project is consistent with Viet Nam\u2019s Socioeconomic Development \nStrategy  2011\u20132020  objectives  to  foster  climate-resilient  urban  infrastructure  development, \nenvironmentally sustainable growth, gender equity, regional cooperation and integration, and \nprivate sector development. It aligns with the operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 (Table \n1), ADB country partnership strategy for Viet Nam 2016\u20132020, and the Strategy for Tourism \n                                                \n5  Sector Assessment (Summary): Tourism in Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, and Viet Nam \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6  ADB. 2014.

Development coordination. Project activities harmonize with tourism vocational training \nand tourism-related SME promotion support from the Government of Luxembourg and the Swiss \nState Secretariat for Economic Affairs. The Japan International Cooperation Agency and the \nWorld Bank Group also support transport and urban development in the GMS corridors. Regional \nassistance is coordinated by GMS tourism, transport, and urban development working groups \ncomprising senior officials, ADB and other development partners, civil society organizations, and \nprivate advisors. Working groups meet at least once a year to direct strategic programming, share \nknowledge and good practices, and coordinate joint activities. The Ministry of Culture, Sports and \nTourism and Viet Nam National Administration of Tourism coordinate national planning and policy \ndialogue with development partners and industry associations. \n \n11.  Value added by ADB assistance. ADB\u2019s value addition includes support to prepare the \ncomprehensive government-endorsed GMS Tourism Sector Strategy 2016\u20132025. The $58.7 \nbillion strategy provides GMS governments and the private sector with a blueprint for competitive, \nbalanced, and sustainable destination development that aligns with ASEAN regional integration \nobjectives. ADB facilitated public\u2013private dialogue and consensus building to select project \ninvestments that foster synergies with agriculture, transport, and urban development initiatives. \nClimate risk assessments were prepared for all infrastructure subprojects with support from ADB\u2019s \nProject Readiness Improvement Trust Fund.8 Capacity building for destination management \nintegrates the Mekong Innovative Startup in Tourism accelerator to identify and scale innovative \ntechnologies that drive tourism growth in secondary destinations. The Mekong Business Initiative, \nsupported by ADB and the Government of Australia, created the platform. \n \n12.  Lessons. To reinforce sustainability and inclusiveness, the project design assimilates key \nlessons from ADB\u2019s past GMS tourism projects.

Third, ASEAN tourism standards target small \nenterprises that are predominately led by and employ women. Fourth, institutional strengthening \npromotes women\u2019s attainment of managerial and leadership roles. Finally, early capacity building \nfor infrastructure O&M will ensure that suitable asset management systems are in place before \nworks are commissioned.9 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The project is aligned with the following impact: sustainable, inclusive, and more balanced \ntourism  development  achieved. 10  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  tourism \ncompetitiveness of secondary towns in Viet Nam increased.11 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n14.  Output 1: Urban\u2013rural access infrastructure and urban environmental services \nimproved. This output focuses on improving roads, water transport infrastructure, and flood \nprotection in tourist sites. It will (i) upgrade 31 kilometers of district and rural roads, including rest \nareas and scenic points; (ii) construct or improve 13 passenger piers; (iii) rehabilitate and extend \nthe 5.5-kilometer seawall, revetments, and beachfront promenade in Cua Lo town with public \ngreen space, walkways, crossroads, drainage, and public toilets; and (iv) improve the existing \nCua Viet\u2013Cua Tung beachfront promenade in Quang Tri by rehabilitating public green space and \nwalkways, drainage, parking areas, public toilets, and small shops that are leased to local vendors. \nAbout 83,500 residents in districts with road improvements will benefit from better access to \neconomic opportunities and social services. Passenger piers will improve water transport and \nrecreation services in Dong Hoi, Dong Ha, and Hue city. The piers will benefit about 24,500 \nresidents, including 130 small ferry and tour boat operators. The improved seawall and drainage \nin Cua Lo town will protect a 228-hectare urban area, directly benefiting about 60,000 residents, \n400 restaurants, and 300 hotels and guesthouses. \n \n15.  Output 2: Capacity to implement ASEAN tourism standards strengthened. This \noutput will (i) strengthen assessment frameworks, certification bodies, and compliance monitoring \nfor the ASEAN green hotel, homestay, clean tourist city, and clean public toilet standards; and (ii) \ndevelop incentives and conduct training to enable standards adoption by tourism and urban \nservice providers. Counterpart resources will support capacity building to help Cua Lo, Dong Ha, \nDong Hoi, and Hue city attain the ASEAN Clean Tourist City Standard. All public toilets financed \nby the project will be constructed to the ASEAN Clean Public Toilet Standard. The project will pilot \nASEAN green hotel and homestay standards to demonstrate how accommodation SMEs can \nboost their competitiveness by improving service quality and consumer confidence. Attaining the \nASEAN Clean Tourist City Standard in the four targeted towns will improve the environment for \nabout 1.1 million residents and more than 8.0 million annual visitors.   \n \n16.

MCST will monitor output 2 and 3 progress and coordinate reporting \nto the government and ADB. PMUs will enhance project readiness by preparing basic designs for \nall infrastructure subprojects with counterpart resources and advertising detailed engineering and \nsafeguards  consulting  services  before  loan  signing.  The  5-year  implementation  period  is \nconsidered sufficient because the provinces will carry out decentralized infrastructure design and \nprocurement simultaneously for the project\u2019s eight small works packages. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n23.  The project is technically feasible. Engineering solutions were selected considering cost, \ndurability, climate, environmental and social impacts, and O&M capacities. Preliminary designs \ncomply  with  Viet  Nam\u2019s  construction  standards  and  local  contracting  industry  capabilities. \nClimate-resilience measures include stronger road base and pavement structures, correctly sited \nrobust seawalls and revetments with suitable foundation levels and crest heights, higher capacity \ndrainage, energy efficient lighting, and bio-engineered river embankment and slope protection. \nPassenger piers incorporate sturdy elevated concrete and steel structures able to withstand \nprojected storm surges and river flow velocities. Programs to build destination management \ncapacity were designed based on stakeholder consultations and institutional analyses of tourism, \ntransport,  and urban management  entities.  ASEAN  tourism  standards  will  be  implemented \nfollowing approved manuals and criteria. Special design features to uphold long-term sustainable \nmaintenance of project investments include maximum use of robustly engineered, steel reinforced \nconcrete roads and structures with lower life cycle O&M costs, and resources to strengthen \nprovincial  and  district  infrastructure O&M  planning  and  budgeting. The  project  will  procure \nappropriate equipment and assist management entities to incorporate maintenance requirements \ninto ferry pier and tourism services management contracts. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n24.  Economic analyses were prepared for the integrated project components following ADB \nguidelines.14 Costs comprise infrastructure and capacity-building investments and the market \nvalue of land to be acquired. Benefits quantified conservatively include (i) increased tourism \nreceipts from incremental annual visitor arrivals (0.3%\u20135.8%) and additional length of stay (0.1\u2013\n0.5 days) in project areas, and (ii) vehicle operating cost savings from reductions in road \nroughness.15 Base-case economic internal rates of return range from 11.9% to 14.8% for road \nimprovement subprojects, from 11.5% to 25.5% for the ferry piers, and 29.8% for coastal \nprotection and public space improvements. All subprojects remain viable under adverse scenarios \nwhereby costs are 10% higher, benefits 10% lower, there are 10% fewer tourist arrivals, or \nimplementation is delayed by 1 year. The expected economic benefits are consistent with ADB\u2019s \ncompleted GMS tourism projects in Viet Nam, which generated economic internal rates of return \nof 22.8%\u201382.2% for similar road and pier improvements in secondary tourist destinations.16 \n   \n                                                \n14 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 International visitor arrival increases range from 2% in Quang Binh province to 32% in Thua Thien Hue province. \n16 ADB. 2017. Completion Report: Greater Mekong Subregion Sustainable Tourism Development Project. Manila. \n ", "8 \n25.  Financial analyses prepared in line with ADB guidelines confirm the financial viability of \nthe following  revenue-generating  subprojects: (i)  Nhat  Le\u2013Long  Dai  river  and  road  access \nimprovements, (ii) Con Co island access improvements, and (iii) Hue tourist piers improvements. \nQuantified revenue streams comprising passenger fees, berthing and parking fees, and rent were \nassessed in nominal terms. Base-case financial internal rates of return range from 7.4% to 23.0%, \nhigher than the 3.0% weighted average cost of capital. Non-revenue-generating roads, coastal \nprotection,  and  urban  space  improvements  will  require  minor  additional  annual  provincial \nbudgetary allocations for routine and periodic maintenance. Loan assurances require each \nprovince to ensure that their annual budget includes sufficient O&M funding for project facilities, \nunderscoring the Government\u2019s commitment to fund sustainable asset maintenance.17 \n \nC.  Governance \n \n26.  The financial management and procurement risks for the executing and implementing \nagencies are assessed substantial. The main constraints are the lack of qualified accountants \nand procurement specialists in provinces. Risk mitigation measures in the financial management \naction plans emphasize hands-on disbursement and procurement training for PMUs by ADB staff \nand consultants, and requirements to use standard ADB-approved procurement documents for \nADB-financed transactions. All executing agencies except Hoa Binh have significant experience \nin managing advance accounts and statement-of-expenditure procedures. The terms of reference \nfor external auditors were agreed with the executing agencies during project preparation and form \npart of the PAM. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed  with  the  government  and  agencies  involved  in  the  project.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n27.  The project will directly benefit about 168,000 people. Project support to implement \nASEAN Clean Tourism City Standard will improve the livability of Cua Lo, Dong Ha, Dong Hoi, \nand Hue cities, benefitting an additional 1.1 million residents, of which 50% are women and girls. \nPoverty rates in project areas range from 7.3% to 17.8%, all higher than the 7.0% national average \nbecause of low incomes, insufficient productive assets, undereducation, and limited skills and \ntraining opportunities. The project\u2019s integrated investments are designed to minimize these \nconstraints and diversify employment and income sources for rural and urban lower-income \nhouseholds. Stakeholder communication and participation plans include activities to help women \nand vulnerable groups recognize and avoid social risks associated with tourism. \n \n28.  Gender. The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. The participating \nprovinces  prepared  the  gender  action  plan  in  consultation  with  female  and  male  project \nbeneficiaries and government officials. Each PMU will implement and monitor the gender action \nplan. Specific actions to promote gender equality include (i) separate consultations with women \nand men to ensure gender-sensitive detailed engineering designs; (ii) requirements to involve \nwomen in infrastructure construction and management; (iii) equal participation in sanitation \nawareness and information and education campaigns to prevent HIV/AIDS, human trafficking, \nand child exploitation; and (iv) appointment of women as managers and leaders of tourism \nstandards  assessment  boards  and  project  management  entities.  The  project  performance \nmanagement system will compile sex- and ethnic-disaggregated data to monitor and evaluate \nresults. \n                                                \n17 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nE.  Safeguards \n \n29.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguards \ncategorization is B for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.18 All \nsafeguards documents were prepared based on meaningful consultations with affected people \nand communities, endorsed by government authorities, and disclosed on the ADB website \nfollowing  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy  2011.  Grievance  redress,  monitoring,  and \nreporting  procedures  are  properly  established  in  all  safeguards  documents.  During  project \nimplementation, all safeguards documents will be updated based on detailed engineering designs, \nreviewed by ADB, and publicly disclosed. The project includes adequate resources to update all \nsafeguards  documents  and  implement  environmental  and  social  monitoring.  PPCs  have \nadequate capacity to ensure compliance with the project\u2019s safeguards requirements. \n \n30.  Environment  (category  B).  The  participating  provinces  prepared  one  initial \nenvironmental examination and five environmental management plans (EMPs), each covering the \nproject\u2019s  area  of  influence  and  all  road,  ferry  pier,  coastal  protection,  and  public  space \nimprovement subprojects. The EMPs provide adequate measures to mitigate the expected minor \nand  temporary  construction  impacts  and  the  potential  adverse  environmental  impacts  of \nincreased tourism activity, particularly in coastal environments and near protected areas.19 Better \nroads, drainage and flood protection, safe ferry piers, improved public green space, and the \nadoption of ASEAN tourism standards are expected to generate overall net environmental \nbenefits. Loan covenants require contractors and destination management agencies to comply \nwith initial environmental examination and EMP mitigation measures. \n \n31.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). Land acquisition and business disruption will \naffect 176 households (759 affected people) in four provinces (Hoa Binh, Nghe An, Quang Tri, \nand Thua Thien Hue). There are 20 severely affected households (86 severely affected people). \nOne house-cum-shop will be physically displaced, and 72 households are classified vulnerable \nincluding 56 Muong ethnic minority households. Due diligence confirms at preliminary design \nthere are no involuntary resettlement impacts expected in Quang Binh. Three resettlement plans \nand one combined resettlement and ethnic minority development plan were prepared by the \nprovincial executing agencies with the assistance of social development specialists. All plans \nreflect  meaningful  consultations  with  affected  households  and  include  suitable  livelihood \nimprovement  programs  and  grievance  redress  mechanisms.  The  initial  resettlement  and \ncompensation costs are estimated at $813,256. This amount is considered adequate based on \nthe inventories of losses prepared in consultation with the affected households. PPCs will appoint \nqualified PMU staff to properly implement the plans using project resources. \n \n32.  Indigenous peoples (category B). The project will positively affect Muong ethnic people \nby creating culturally appropriate jobs, diversifying income, and strengthening their involvement \nin tourism management and decision making. Ethnic groups will equally benefit from improved \naccess to economic opportunities and social services, better destination management, and \ncapacity building. The project will not displace ethnic households from traditional or customary \nlands or negatively impact ethnic minority identity, culture, or customary livelihood systems. The \nresettlement and ethnic minority development plan identifies the potential negative impacts, and \ncontains adequate measures to mitigate them. \n \n                                                \n18 ADB.

ASSURANCES \n \n34.  The government and Hoa Binh, Nghe An, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, and Thua Thien Hue \nPPCs have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all applicable ADB \npolicies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, procurement, \nconsulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \nThe government and the executing agencies have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject, which are set forth in the loan and project agreements. \n \n35.
