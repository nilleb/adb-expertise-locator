The  Program  is \nanchored in the Government\u2019s reforms in secondary education.  \n \nThe SESDP is aimed at improving the average learning outcome \namong  secondary  students  through  three  outputs:  effective  and \naccountable management of secondary education, improvements in \nquality  for  international  competitiveness,  and  better  access  and \nequity  for  disadvantaged  groups.  The  SESDP  will  comprise  the \nfollowing  activities:  (i) updating  the  Secondary  Education  Sector \nMaster Plan 2011\u20132015, (ii) developing new national standards for \nsecondary schools, (iii) establishing a national accreditation board \nfor  secondary  schools,  (iv) introducing  a  new  human  resource \nmanagement strategy for secondary teachers, (v) issuing certificates \nto secondary teachers, (vi) introducing a new learning assessment \nsystem, (vii) participating in the Programme for International Student \nAssessment  of  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and \nDevelopment,  (viii) upgrading  the  curriculum,  (ix) expanding \ncontinuing  education,  (x) expanding  integrated  education  for \ndisabled students, and (xi) pilot-testing the conditional cash transfer \nprogram. \n   \nRationale  Viet Nam has enjoyed rapid economic growth over the past decade \non the strength of higher farm incomes, strong domestic demand, \nand fast export growth. Exports are growing by 15%\u201320% per year \nin value terms, and foreign direct investment inflows by 10% per \nyear.  \n \nRecent economic growth has changed the sectoral composition of \nthe economy. In 1999, the country was primarily agricultural: 76% of \nthe population lived in the countryside and agricultural production \naccounted  for  26%  of gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  (1998).  By \n2007, the share of agriculture, forestry, and fishery had declined to \n14.2% of GDP. Industry, on the other hand, has increased its share \nof GDP to 43.3%, while services now make up 42.5%. Such a shift\n ", "ii   \n \n \nwill  require  an  educated  and  skilled  workforce  to  support  an \neconomy based on services, technology, and industry.  \n \nThere is a growing need for more than just equitable compulsory \neducation.  Parents,  particularly  those  from  the  increasingly \nprosperous middle class, aspire to have their children succeed in the \nmarket economy and view the acquisition of academic qualifications \nand professional skills as a key strategy toward that objective. They \nrealize that primary education alone will not secure employment in \nmodern  industries  and  well-paid  professional  careers.  Secondary \neducation is considered an entry-level requirement that can provide \nthe basic competencies and skills for technology management and \nproblem solving. \n \nViet Nam  must  improve  the  quality  of  its  labor  force  to  stay \ncompetitive within the region and sustain economic growth. In 2006, \nViet Nam had a work force (15\u201360 years of age) of 45.6 million, 3% \nmore than in 2005. Nearly half (45.5%) were below the age of 34. \nYoung  people  must  become  proficient  in  information  and \ncommunication  technology,  foreign  languages,  and  other \nprofessional skills and areas of knowledge. The quality of schooling \nand the learning outcomes must be equivalent to those in other \ncountries for Viet Nam to continue to compete internationally. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The expected impact of the program is enhanced learning outcomes \nand  competitiveness  of  secondary  school  students.  The  program \noutcome  will  be  improved  quality  and  equity  of  the  secondary \neducation system by 2015. \n \nProgram Loan  Until recently Viet Nam was largely concerned with the supply side \nof education. Now it can pay greater attention to making sure that \nthe  secondary  education  system  is  well  connected  and  has \nappropriate means to give all students access to good education, \nregardless of their location and personal circumstance.  \n \nWhile the Government sets national policies and programs, local \ngovernments have long had autonomy in management decisions. \nThis arrangement has encouraged local ownership, but it has also \nresulted in critical gaps in access and quality of service provision in \nsome districts. To address concerns over the inconsistent quality of \neducation across provinces and districts, the central Government \nmust  provide  a  clear  and  relevant  policy  reform  agenda  and \neducation policy framework, and have local governments adopt it in \ntheir decision making.  \n \nThe program loan will support the Government\u2019s ongoing reform \nagenda  for  improving  quality,  access,  efficiency,  and \ncompetitiveness in secondary education. The policy actions under \nthe  program  loan  will  deal  with  three  key  subsector  constraints: \n(i) sector management and accountability, (ii) quality and relevance, \nand (iii) access and equity. \n   \n ", "  iii\nOverall Financing Plan  To help finance the estimated cost of the SESDP of $71 million \nequivalent, the Government of Viet Nam has requested the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for a sector development program loan of \n$60 million  equivalent  (84.5%  of  the  total)  from  Special  Funds \nresources (Asian Development Fund)\u2014a program loan of $20 million \nand  a  project  loan  of  $40  million.  The  Government  will  provide \ncounterpart funds of $11 million equivalent (15.5%)\u2014$7.3 million \nequivalent  (10.28%)  from  the  central  budget  and  $3.7  million \n(5.21%)  from  provincial  budgets\u2014for  a  construction  site  survey, \nmaintenance  of  facilities,  equipment  to  be  procured  under  the \nSESDP, and taxes and duties. The financing plan for SESDP is \nsummarized in the table below. \n \nTotal \nSource  ($ million)  % \nAsian Development Bank: Program Loan (ADF)   20.00   28.17 \nAsian Development Bank: Project Loan (ADF)  40.00   56.34 \nGovernment, Central    7.30   10.28 \nGovernment, Provincial    3.70     5.21 \n  Total                       71.00  100.00 \nADF = Asian Development Fund. \n Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \nProgram Loan Terms  The  program  loan  of  $20  million  will  have  a  term  of  24  years, \nand Tranching  including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest rate charge of \n1% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year after that. \nThe size of the program loan was determined by the strength of the \npolicy package and its development impact. The loan amount covers \npart of the adjustment costs for the measures in the policy matrix to \nbe implemented over the first 3 years of loan implementation. The \nprogram loan will be released in two tranches. The first tranche of \n$5 million will be released after the Government meets the agreed \nconditions  in  the  policy  reform  matrix.  The  second  tranche  of \n$15 million  is  expected  to  be  released  24  months  after  loan \neffectiveness provided that ADB is satisfied that the Government has \nmade  enough  progress  in  implementing  the  Program  and,  in \nparticular, has met all the conditions in the policy reform matrix for \nthe release of the second tranche.  \n   \nProgram Period  January 2008\u2013December 2012 \n   \nProcurement  The proceeds of the program loan will be used to finance the full \nforeign exchange costs of items  produced and procured in ADB \nmember countries, excluding ineligible items and imports financed \nfrom other bilateral and multilateral sources.  \n   \nProject Loan  The  project  loan  will  support  activities  that  transform  the  policy \nprogram into local actions targeted at identified areas of need. Its \noutputs will be coordinated with those of the program loan. One \nadditional  output  will  provide  overall  financial  and  administrative \nsupport for program implementation and monitoring. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  The  project  loan  of  $40  million  will  cover  the  base  costs  of  the \n ", "iv   \n \nproject activities, physical and price contingencies, and interest and \nother charges during implementation. The loan will have a term of 32 \nyears,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  an  interest  rate \ncharge of 1% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year \nafter that. \n   \nPeriod of Loan  31 December 2015 \nUtilization \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2015 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  The  Government  will  form  a  steering  committee,  comprising \nArrangements  representatives from the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET), \nthe Ministry of Finance, the Office of Government, the Ministry of \nPlanning and Investment, and the State Bank of Viet Nam to guide \nand supervise the overall management of the SESDP. MOET will be \nresponsible for overall program management and guidance as the \nExecuting Agency. A central project management unit (CPMU) will \nbe created in MOET to oversee day-to-day project implementation. \nThe CPMU will comprise a qualified full-time project manager and \nkey technical staff. A provincial project management unit (PPMU) will \nbe formed in the department of education and training (DOET) of \neach  target  province.  The  PPMUs  will  implement,  coordinate, \nmonitor, and report activities in the province with instruction and \nguidance from the CPMU.  \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) \n   \nProcurement  All procurement of goods and works to be financed under an ADB \nloan  will  conform  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). The CPMU, in close cooperation with \nthe  PPMUs,  will  be  responsible  for  all  procurement.  MOET  will \ndevelop  and  update  the  procurement  plan  with  the  contract \npackages, and have it reviewed and approved by ADB. Within 1 year \nof loan effectiveness MOET will submit for ADB\u2019s approval a revised \nprocurement plan that captures all procurement that is ongoing or \nplanned for the next 18 months. The plan will be updated yearly in \nthe same way throughout the Program. \n   \nConsulting Services  Consultants will be recruited in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). For smooth \nstart-up, the international and national project facilitation advisers will \nbe  selected  and  hired  individually  to  help  CPMU  develop  a  solid \nimplementation framework. The rest of the services will be provided \nby an international firm, to be selected and hired through quality- and \ncost-based selection, at the standard quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. The \nProgram will provide 388 person-months of consulting services\u201468 \ninternational and 320 national. Overseas training providers will be \nselected through fixed-budget selection.  \n   \n ", "  v\n \n \nProgram Benefits and  The  secondary  education  sector  will  benefit  directly  from \nBeneficiaries  (i) strengthened  quality  control  and  assessment  of  secondary \nteachers and schools; (ii) improved learning outcomes of students, \nmeasured  through  internationally  standardized  tests; \n(iii) more-effective teaching and learning with the use of information \nand  communication  technology;  and  (iv) narrower  gaps  between \nmales  and  females,  between  income  groups,  and  between  ethnic \ngroups at the secondary level. \n \nThe major economic benefits will include improved productivity of \nsecondary  school  graduates  and  cost  savings  due  to  increased \nsystem  efficiency.  The  Program  will  (i) increase  the  number  of \nsecondary school graduates; (ii) improve the skills and performance \nof  secondary  school  graduates  in  the  labor  market,  leading  to \nincreased earnings; and (iii) reduce the unit costs of schooling per \nstudent  through  improved  participation  and  completion  rates  in \nsecondary education. \n \nThe  Program  will  directly  benefit  ethnic-minority,  poor,  and  female \nstudents  by  making  secondary  education  more  accessible  and \naffordable. The pilot conditional cash transfer program will address \ndemand-side constraints and reduce the direct and indirect costs of \neducation. The pilot program is expected to have significant impact in \nincreasing  attendance  and  transition  rates  among  the  poor,  ethnic \nminorities, and females from primary to lower secondary education, and \nfrom lower secondary education to upper secondary education, and in \nincreasing the number of years of education completed by poor children \nand girls. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  There are still concerns about potential local government resistance \nto some of the proposed reforms. Efforts will be made to obtain the \nsupport  of  local  authorities  through  consultations  to  explain  the \noutputs and benefits of the reform actions. \n \nThe success of the Program requires substantial technical knowledge \nand management capacity. Institutional capacity development through \ntimely staff training will be essential. \n \nTo ensure that the proceeds of the program loan are used to support \nthe agreed policy reforms, the loan amount has been earmarked for \nthe policy reform actions and both MOET and the Ministry of Finance \nwill be responsible for the timely fulfillment of the target actions. Close \ninterministerial coordination and a solid and transparent funds flow \narrangement will be the key to the successful implementation of the \nProgram. \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogram loan, and (ii) a proposed project loan, both to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the \nSecondary Education Sector Development Program. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.  \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Indicators and Analysis of Performance \n  1.  Country Context \n2.  Socioeconomic development. Viet Nam has enjoyed rapid economic growth over the \npast decade. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita increased from $489.9 in 2003 to \n$1,052.7 in 2008. The real economic growth rate accelerated from 7.3% to 8.5% between 2003 \nand 2007 before dropping to 6.2% in 2008. This progress rests on fast export growth, higher \nfarm incomes, and strong domestic demand. Exports are growing by 15%\u201320% per year in \nvalue terms, and foreign direct investment inflows by 10% per year.  \n \n3.  As  a  consequence  of  the  recent  economic  growth,  the  sectoral  composition of the \neconomy has also drastically changed. In 1999, the country was primarily agricultural, with 76% \nof the population living in the rural areas and agricultural production accounting for 26% of GDP \n(1998). By 2007, the share of agriculture, forestry, and fishery had declined to 14.2% of GDP. \nThe share of industry, on the other hand, has been climbing and is now at 43.3%, while the \nshare of services has risen to 42.5%. By 2010, it is estimated that the agricultural labor force will \nhave dropped to 50% but the labor force in industry and construction will have increased to 24% \nand the service labor force to 26%. Such a shift will require an educated and skilled workforce to \nsupport an economy based on services and industry.  \n \n4.  There is a growing need for more than just equitable compulsory education. Parents, \nparticularly those from the increasingly prosperous middle-income stratum of society, hold high \naspirations for their children to succeed in the market economy and view the acquisition of \nacademic qualifications and professional skills as a key strategy toward that objective. The \nfamilies realize that primary education alone will not secure employment for their children in \nmodern industries and well-paid professional careers. Secondary education is considered an \nentry-level  requirement  that  can  provide  the  basic  competencies  and  skills  for  technology \nmanagement and problem solving. \n \n5.  Enhancing the quality of the labor force is a critical element for Viet Nam to retain \nregional competitiveness and sustained economic growth. In 2006 Vietnam had a work force \n(15 years to 60 years of age) of 45.6 million people, an increase of 3% from 2005. Of this, \nnearly half or 45.5% are below the age of 34. Thus, it is important to equip young people with \nprofessional skills and knowledge such as information and communication technology (ICT) and \nproficiency in foreign languages. The quality of schooling and the learning outcomes of students \nneed to be equivalent with other countries for Viet Nam to remain internationally competitive.  \n \n6.  Government\u2019s development strategy. The Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) \n2006\u20132010 underscores the Government\u2019s commitment to 14 major economic and social policy \ntargets, including (i) a slower population growth rate of 1.14%, (ii) reduced poverty, (iii) universal \n ", "2 \nlower secondary education (LSE),1 (iv) a reduction in the agricultural labor force to 50% of the \ntotal, (v) job creation and a stable unemployment rate, and (vi) less malnutrition. Key features of \nSEDP 2006\u20132010  are  an  emphasis  on  the  equitable  delivery  of  social  services  to \ndisadvantaged groups, and a strong results orientation, with performance indicators including \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the localized Viet Nam Development Goals. \n \n7.  Viet Nam\u2019s high rate of economic growth has had a positive impact on poverty and \ncontributed to progress in achieving the MDGs and the Viet Nam Development Goals. Poverty \nincidence was reduced from more than 58% in 1993 to less than 20% in 2007. Youth literacy \nhas reached 93%,2 and Viet Nam is close to achieving universal primary education. Most of the \ntargets related to health care have been met. These significant achievements have raised \nViet Nam\u2019s human development index to a high level relative to that for other countries in the \nsame income group.  \n \n8.  Persistent development inequalities by region, ethnicity, disability, and gender. \nHaving achieved impressive overall economic growth rates, there has been a shift in poverty \nincidence\u2014from being widespread throughout the population it is now concentrated in specific \ngroups that are harder to reach. Four groups are particularly vulnerable: rural poor, ethnic \nminorities, people with disabilities, and women and girls. \n \n9.  In 2006, 20.4% of rural households were poor, compared with 3.9% of urban households. \nThere are also significant differences between geographic regions. Poverty is highest in the \nNorth West region, at 51.9%, and lowest in the South East, at 6.1%.3 Ethnic minorities, in \nparticular, have not progressed to the same extent as other groups. In 2006, 52.3% of ethnic \nminority households were poor, compared with 10.3% of ethnic Kinh and Chinese households. \nPoverty  among  ethnic  minority  groups  is  closely  associated  with  low  or  limited  access  to \nopportunities  for  education  and  training,  often  resulting  in  low  agricultural  productivity  and \nexclusion from participation in local governance. \n \n10.  As of March 2008, about 12.8 million persons have physical or mental disabilities in Viet \nNam.4 While the Government has provided financial support programs to the disabled, they \nremain restricted in accessing education opportunities leading to lack of life skills and job \nopportunities. Provision of schooling at secondary level is particularly limited. Until 2000, there \nwas only one lower secondary school in the country which was able to accept disabled children \nand provide integrated education. In the school year (SY) 2007/2008, Viet Nam had 99,941 \ndisabled students receiving schooling; 80,187 students at primary schools, but only 17,329 at \nlower secondary school (LSS) and 2,425 at upper secondary school (USS).  \n \n11.  Gender inequalities continue to be a major development constraint in remote, poor \nprovinces. Literacy among adults (15 years and over) in 2000\u20132005 was 94% for males and \n87% for females.5 One of the remaining inequalities in secondary education in the country is the \ndisparity between female and male enrollments at all levels\u2014LSE, upper secondary education \n(USE), and professional secondary education\u2014and especially in LSE. While gender disparities \nin education have declined in recent years, it persists in all ethnic groups and geographic \nregions. The percentage of students in secondary school is generally the same for Kinh and \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

This gender gap \nvaries  between  ethnic  groups  and  geographic  regions,  but  several  study  findings  and \nconsultations identify ethnic minority females as the most disadvantaged group in secondary \neducation.  \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Education Sector Performance Indicators  \n12.  Key investment option for development. Viet Nam considers education to be strongly \nlinked  to  economic  growth  and  gives  it  priority  in  investments  for  the  socioeconomic \ndevelopment of the country. The central goal of education is rapid human resource development \nto meet labor needs in a highly competitive market economy while ensuring a high level of \nequity. Viet Nam\u2019s educated and low-cost workforce is an advantage, although this constitutes \nonly 27% of the national labor force, compared with 50% in some other developing countries in \nthe region.6 The Government plans to increase this proportion to 40% by 2010, and 60% by \n2020. However, achieving these goals will depend on whether education in Viet Nam can \nproduce a workforce with the creative and analytical skills needed to compete in an increasingly \nindustrial and knowledge-based economy.  \n \n13.  Education sector performance. Sustained efforts by the Government and development \npartners have resulted in relatively solid performance in education. In SY 2007\u20132008, the gross \nenrollment  rate  reached  95.2%  for  primary  education,  92%  for  LSE,  and  56.7%  for  USE. \nParticipation rate in higher education was 13% in 2008. Having achieved near-universal primary \neducation, as indicated in SEDP 2006\u20132010, the Government has made it the principal goal of \nthe education sector to achieve universal LSE by 2015 and improve the education system and \ncontent by 2015. Overall, the Government has gradually shifted the focus of public services \nfrom equitable provision to better quality of services. However, a remaining critical need is \ndelivering  education  services  to  the  hardest-to-reach  groups  in  parallel  with  improving  the \nquality  and  effectiveness  of  secondary  education.  The  education  sector  is  analyzed  in \nAppendix 2. \n \n14.  Education finance. Public education expenditure is increasing at a steady rate, favoring \ndisadvantaged areas. The current sector and subsector policy frameworks emphasize these \ntrends. In SY2006/07, education accounted for 19.8% of total public expenditure and 5.1% of \nGDP. In subsector share of education expenditure, there were clear shifts in priorities between \n2001 and 2008 (i) from technical training (24.1% to 18.9%) to general education (75.8% to \n81.0%); (ii) from primary education (32.7% to 29.2%) to secondary education (LSE and USE) \n(30.4% to 40.59%); and (iii) from relatively wealthy regions to remote, ethnic minority regions, in \nparticular, the Northern Mountainous, Central Highlands, and the Mekong River Delta regions.7 \n \n15.  Education sector policy and strategies. Secondary education development is guided \nby  the  (i) Education  Strategic  Development  Plan  2001\u20132010,  now  being  updated  as  the \nEducation  Sector  Strategic  Development  (ESSD)  for  2011\u20132020;  and  (ii) the  Secondary \nEducation Sector Master Plan 2006\u20132010.  \n \n                                                 \n6  Address by Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung to the National Assembly, 27 November 2006. \n7  ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Preparing Secondary Education Sector \nDevelopment Program. Manila (final draft). \n ", "4 \n16.  Education Sector Strategic Development 2011\u20132020. The key policy targets of the \nESSD  are  (i) a  99%  net  enrollment  rate  for  primary  education  and  LSE;  (ii) an  80%  net \nenrollment rate for USE or its equivalent; (iii) a 90% completion rate for primary education, LSE, \nand USE; (iv) vocational training for 60% of the labor force; (v) a 21% share for education in \nstate expenditures; (vi) secondary school students with subject knowledge, lifelong skills, a \ngeneral understanding of science and technology, a vocational orientation, and proficiency in \nforeign languages; (vii) better-quality continuing education through diversified programs; (viii) a \n70% schooling participation rate for people with disabilities; (ix) foreign-language training for all \nstudents from grade 3 onward; and (x) increased attention to the education of gifted students. \n \n17.  Secondary Education Sector Master Plan 2006\u20132010.8 The Secondary Education Sector \nMaster Plan 2006\u20132010 was developed with the assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nand other partners. The plan sets out to (i) achieve universal LSE nationwide by 2010; (ii) improve \nthe quality of learning outcomes; and (iii) strengthen capacity for better resource management and \nmobilization, as key subsector targets. A new secondary education master plan will be developed \nfor 2011\u20132015 in accordance with the ESSD 2011\u20132020.  \n  2.  Subsector Challenges  \n18.  An interim review of progress and achievement against the performance targets under \nSESMP 2006\u20132010 has indicated some emerging needs, which have been incorporated into the \ndraft ESSD 2011\u20132020. Among these are better international benchmarking and performance \nassessment, strengthened foreign-language training, and greater use of ICT in learning and \nteaching. The subsector performance assessment has also identified issues that still need to be \naddressed. The key sector constraints are shown in the program problem tree in Appendix 3.  \na.  System Management \n19.  Need for a new subsector strategy. While significant progress has been made under \nSESMP 2006\u20132010 in expanding secondary schools, the key policy objective has shifted from \nwider coverage of general secondary education to improved quality of education and targeted \nsupport for more-equitable access for disadvantaged groups. An updated subsector strategy is \nneeded to provide the framework for secondary education and guide future investments and \nactions in the subsector. The new strategy must deal comprehensively with quality, relevance, \nand efficiency issues. \n \n20.  Outdated national school standards. The Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) \nhas been using outdated national school standards (NSSs)9 for secondary education, which are \nof insufficient quality or relevance to allow students to acquire the skills and knowledge they \nneed to compete in modern society. The Government issued a directive for the updating of the \nNSSs for secondary education in 2005, but limited financial and human resources have delayed \nthis upgrading. NSSs that will equate better with international best practice but also recognize \nlocal circumstances are needed. These NSSs will not only promote world-class education but \nalso address issues of equity for all students.  \n \n21.  Ineffective  accreditation  system.  MOET\u2019s  Department  of  Education  Quality  and \nAccreditation is responsible for accrediting public schools. Accreditation is now done only on \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Strategic Secondary Education Planning \nand Cooperation. Manila. \n9  Viet Nam uses three levels of school standards for primary and secondary education: (i) international standards, \n(ii) national standards, and (iii) fundamental school quality. The current NSSs were developed in 2001. \n ", "  5\nrequest, so many rural secondary schools have not yet taken part in this important quality \nassurance process. Moreover, the quality of accreditation suffers from the lack of adequate \nstandards. To ensure that all secondary schools are accredited objectively against the same \nbenchmarks, a more rigorous system operating under an independent agency, and based on \nthe new NSS, is needed. \n \n22.  Weak quality assurance of private schools. The quality of nonpublic schools, with \ntheir poor teachers and facilities, and uncertain finances, is a source of particular concern. As \nthese schools are deemed part of the national education system (sharing in incentives related to \nfacilities, land, taxes, fees, credit, insurance, and commendation and reward systems), the \nGovernment expects them to meet the same standards as public schools. The Government \ntherefore plans to extend the accreditation system to cover both public and private schools to \nmake sure that they all provide at least a minimum quality of schooling. \n \n23.  Poor human resource management of teachers. Currently, adequate numbers of \nteachers are being trained, although demand exceeds supply in some subject areas such as \nEnglish, music, and ICT. There is no shortage of graduates qualified to teach, but few can be \ninduced to teach in rural and isolated areas. The incentive system set up by the Government to \nattract teachers to rural areas, particularly remote, ethnic-minority areas needs to be refined and \nexpanded. As full-day schooling becomes more accessible and more is expected of teachers, \ntheir salaries and circumstances will have to be reviewed and improved to keep teaching jobs \ncompetitive with other forms of employment. \nb.  Quality and Relevance \n24.  No professional certification of teachers. While more than 80% of the present crop of \nsecondary teachers have the required academic qualifications and adequate subject knowledge, \nsome lack practical teaching skills to motivate students to learn. Current teacher standards center \non academic qualifications and not actual teaching skills. Besides, there is no professional teacher \ncertification. While teachers are required to participate in some in-service teacher training programs, \nonce they graduate from a teacher training college (TTC) or a teacher training university (TTU), their \nprofessional status as teachers is secured.  \n \n25.  Teachers need to upgrade their qualifications\u2014both in subject knowledge and teaching \nskills\u2014in order to meet the standards required for registration. There is also a pressing need for \nthem to be brought up-to-date with the latest education technology. Qualified teachers seeking \nre-entry  into  the  teaching  workforce  need  a  similar  range  of  in-service  courses.  The \ndevelopment of teacher standards will provide a clearer indication of the teaching skills, subject \nknowledge and attributes needed by teachers and will be incorporated into both pre-service and \nin- service programs. \n \n26.  Poor assessment of learning outcomes. The concept of \u201clearning outcomes\u201d is new to \nViet Nam. Learning outcomes are often seen as amounts of memorized knowledge rather than \nthe acquired ability to think analytically, solve problems, and take a suitable attitude to learning \nrequired to compete successfully in the international labor market. MOET has established an \nassessment  monitoring  and  management  system  for  all  levels  of  education  including  the \nprovincial departments of education and training (DOETs) and the district bureaus of education \nand training. \n \n27.  A valid and reliable system and standard for students\u2019 performance and attainments is \nstill  being  developed,  although  MOET  has  been  monitoring  student  performance  through \n ", "6 \nnational tests and examinations. New assessment instruments are being developed under the \nnational achievement monitoring (NAM) program for primary education, but so far there has \nbeen no such initiative for secondary education.  \n \n28.  To improve the assessment of learning outcomes, MOET plans to participate by 2012 in \nthe Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) of the Organisation for Economic \nCo-operation  and  Development  (OECD).  PISA  compares  the  performance  of  15  year-old \nstudents  near  the  end  of  basic  education  across  different  countries  using  internationally \nstandardized assessment tests. Toward the end of compulsory education, it evaluates the \nadequacy of knowledge and skills acquired by students for full participation in society. The \ndomains of reading, mathematical and scientific literacy, problem-solving skills, and analytical \nskills are covered.  \n \n29.  Low-quality secondary curriculum. There are two major issues related to curriculum \nreform:  (i) there  is  no  regulatory  framework  for  the  periodic  review  and  upgrading  of  the \nsecondary curriculum, and (ii) the curriculum content still mainly emphasizes rote learning and \ndoes not help secondary students develop more problem-solving skills and analytical abilities. \nAs the curriculum is the starting point of all other educational inputs, a system for the constant \nsupervision of curricular content, relevance, and application in schools must be established. \nCurriculum reform will thus shift from the ad hoc updating of subject content to the periodic, \ncomprehensive improvement of student learning outcomes through cognitive development and \nmore-innovative teaching. \n \n30.  Limited  use  of  information  and  communication  technology.  While  tertiary \ninstitutes\u2014universities,  technical  colleges,  and  other  training  institutes\u2014have  increasingly \nintegrated the use of ICT into their programs, ICT in secondary schools is, still too often, \nnarrowly associated with the use of computers and the internet in classrooms. In addition, the \nconcept of \u201cICT capability\u201d in secondary learning and teaching is still new to many education \npolicy makers and teachers. For a smooth and effective transition from school to further study or \nwork, all secondary students must be skilled in the use of ICT to learn more, and learn better, in \nschool and be prepared for future study or work. Students are expected to source material \nthrough the web; use web-based tools to create, analyze, and evaluate data; and submit all \nreports and assignments online. Similarly, industry uses ICT as a critical tool and requires \nworkers to have enough computer-based knowledge and technical skills to work efficiently and \neffectively.  \n \n31.  Outmoded  foreign-language  training.  The  limited  number  of  qualified \nforeign-language teachers and the outmoded teaching methods and instructional equipment at \nsecondary  schools  are  sources  of  great  concern.  English-speaking  teachers  often  leave \nteaching for better-paid jobs in the private sector and in urban areas. Viet Nam has decided to \nmake English-language skills a major feature of its school curriculum from grade 3 onward and \nto support that decision with additional funding at preservice teacher education institutions and \nin-service  teacher  training.  However,  a  vast  cadre  of  qualified  English  teachers  must  be \ndeveloped, and the teacher training program and instruction materials urgently need to be \nupgraded.  \nc.  Access and Equity \n32.  Despite the impressive growth in secondary education, inequality in the distribution of \nquality  schooling  has  remained  a  critical  challenge.  Ethnic  minorities,  girls,  children  from \ndisadvantaged and poor families, mentally and physically challenged children, children who are \noverage for their grade level, isolated rural populations, and recent urban migrants have not had \n ", "  7\naccess to the same quantity or quality of instructional services as have other, more-privileged, \nsubgroups. This deficiency must be remedied through the provision of good-quality schools and \neducation, distributed according to need throughout Viet Nam. \n \n33.  Low-quality  schooling  for  out-of-school  youth.  While  the  Government  needs  to \nincrease access to secondary schooling to achieve universal LSE, it is also necessary to \nimprove the quality of continuing education (CE)10 for disadvantaged youth. On average, 47% of \nthe students attending continuing education are ethnic-minority children and overage students \nwho could not start schooling at the regular age. CE programs generally constitute bridging \ncourses that create equivalency for years 7 and 9, and allow entry back into formal education or \ncreate a pathway to higher or vocational education for disadvantaged youth. The courses are \nprovided at continuing education centers (CECs) in the provinces, districts, and communes. The \nCECs serve youth who have dropped out of the system, including the poor who cannot afford \nthe cost of education; youth in special need of protection; youth affected by HIV/AIDS; and \nyouth in the juvenile justice system. The aim of the equivalency programs is to draw these youth \nback into the education system and thereby improve their life chances and social opportunities. \n \n34.  Limited  participation  of  disabled  children.  A lack of social awareness regarding \ndisability  issues,  combined  with  traditional  negative  stereotypes,  can  restrict  educational \nopportunities for children with disabilities. Parental attitudes may also hinder enrollment and \nsupport for the child to attend school. Many disabled children in Viet Nam are marginalized and \nexcluded from access to education, particularly at the secondary level. The high direct costs of \neducation for families are also a deterrent, as families do not value the education of disabled \nchildren or spend much of their earnings caring for the disabled child.  \n \n35.  While considerable effort has been made to promote access to and participation in \nsecondary  education  for  students  with  disabilities,  reaching  the  2020  target  of  a  70% \nparticipation rate for disabled children will be a major task. Moreover, students must be able to \nparticipate in the full curriculum and realize their intellectual potential. As special schools cost a \ngreat deal to build and operate, one alternative would be to start by equipping classrooms in \none LSS in each province. Students could be integrated into mainstream classes for some \ncourses, and attend special classes for others. \n \n36.  Low participation of the poor, ethnic minorities, and females. The Government has \nallocated substantial resources to improving education for all through the mainstream MOET \nstate budget and other targeted initiatives such as the National Targeted Program on education. \nHowever, the participation of poor, ethnic minority, and female students is still substantially \nlower than the national averages. In SY2008\u20132009, girls made up 47.8% of lower secondary \nstudents nationwide, but, in the Northwest, where 82% of lower secondary students come from \nminorities,  less  than  44%  of  students  are  girls.  Dropout  rates  also  tend  to  be  higher  for \nminorities: in 2007\u20132008, the dropout rate for the Mekong River Delta region was 11%, almost \ntwice the national average of 6%.  \n \n37.  Low participation is caused partly by supply-side constraints such as poor infrastructure, \nphysical isolation, language and cultural barriers, the small number and poor quality of teachers, \nand unsuitability of the curriculum to local needs. However, demand-side problems due to the \nsubstantial  direct  and  indirect  costs  of  education,  coupled  with  high  opportunity  costs, \n                                                 \n10  In Viet Nam, the term \u201ccontinuing education\u201d does not mean adult education or lifelong learning, but nonformal \neducation. Continuing education at the secondary level can be better tailored to the needs of overage students and \nout-of-school youth for vocational and life skills while earning them a secondary leaving certificate. The SESMP \n2006\u20132010 emphasis on improving access to and the quality of CECs is a key measure for the realization of \nuniversal secondary education. \n ", "8 \nincreasingly prevent poor parents from sending their children to school. A large part of the \nopportunity cost, which increases at the LSE level as children get older, is the loss of child labor \nfrom  household  production.  Poor  families  are  reluctant  to  invest  in  children\u2019s  education, \nparticularly for their daughters, as the contribution of the child to the family income may be more \nimportant to the household in the short term. Children from the poorest quintile of the population \nwork twice as many hours as children from the richest quintile, and females work 20%\u201350% \nmore  than  males  across  all  income  quintiles  and  ethnic  groups.  There  is  a  need  for \nawareness-raising  programs  to  promote  the  longer-term  benefits  of  investing  in  children\u2019s \nsecondary  education,  and  for  innovative  and  targeted  assistance  to  bring  the  most \ndifficult-to-reach groups, such as ethnic minorities and girls in the poorest communes, into \nsecondary education. \n3.  External Assistance to the Education Sector \n38.  Official development assistance for the education sector. Many donor agencies and \nnongovernment organizations have been involved in the education sector. The Government \ngives high priority to education and training, and has called for increased investment in the \nsector by development partners. In the past several years, official development assistance \n(ODA) funds for education and training composed 5.5%\u20136.0% of total public expenditures for \neducation. Thirteen loan and grant projects totaling $782 million are providing ongoing support \nfor education sector development. While basic education has the largest share of ODA funds, all \nlevels  of  education,  from  nursery  to  tertiary,  have  received  substantial  assistance  from \ndevelopment partners. A donor coordination matrix is in Appendix 4. \n \n39.  Multilateral  partners. The World Bank has supported primary, tertiary, and special \neducation. The World Bank and the Like-Minded Donor Group11 have been working toward a \nmedium-term expenditure framework in primary education. The European Commission has \nrecently completed a teacher quality improvement project for basic education, and is providing \nongoing support to the education sector including the Support for the Renovation of Education \nManagement and the Sector Policy Support Programme for Education for All, which is being \nimplemented  with  other  donors.  The  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural \nOrganization (UNESCO) is also a key development partner in both primary and secondary \neducation. It is a focal agency for the National Action Plan for Education for All and for girls\u2019 \neducation,  the  capacity  development  of  local  education  authorities,  literacy  though  adult \neducation, and HIV/AIDS preventive education. The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) \nis active in early childhood care and education, bilingual education for ethnic minority youth, and \nthe introduction of \u201cchild-friendly\u201d schools.  \n \n40.  Bilateral partners. France is the largest bilateral partner in the education sector. The \nGovernment of France on average allocates 8% of its ODA to education, mainly for language \ntraining, research studies, scholarships, and vocational training. The Government of Japan is \nalso a key bilateral donor to the sector. The Japan International Cooperation Organization \n(formerly  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency)  has  been  working  mainly  on  primary \neducation through school construction and equipment provision since the early 1990s, but \nrecently indicated a shift in priority from primary to secondary and tertiary education. Germany \nprovides  financial  and  technical  support  for  the  Technical  and  Vocational  Education  and \nTraining through German development cooperation (GTZ and KfW). Australia and Belgium have \nalso financed scholarships and have provided grant assistance to LSE as cofinanciers of some \n                                                 \n11  A group of 10 bilateral donors that share a common commitment to Viet Nam\u2019s Comprehensive Poverty Reduction \nand Growth Strategy for promoting pro-poor growth and aligning official development assistance. \n ", "  9\nof ADB\u2019s technical assistance projects. The United Kingdom has similarly participated in World \nBank projects as a cofinancier. \n \n41.  Donor  coordination  and  harmonization. ADB is one of the principal development \npartners in the education sector in Viet Nam together with the World Bank, the Government of \nFrance,  and  the  European  Commission.  It  maintains  close  collaboration  with  the  key \ndevelopment partners, in particular with the World Bank, to ensure a coordinated approach \nacross all education subsectors and to harmonize efforts within each subsector. ADB is a \nmember  of  the  sector  donor  coordination  framework,  the  Education  Sector  Group  (ESG), \ncomprising most development partners active in the sector. The major functions of ESG include \nproviding  consolidated  comments  on  various  government  education  policies  and  decrees, \nsharing information on ongoing and upcoming education projects financed by ESG members, \nand organizing joint retreats and field trips among members. Since 2007, ADB has contributed \nto  the  formulation  of  several  new  education  policy  initiatives  and  joint  studies  with  other \ndevelopment partners.  \n \n42.  ADB\u2019s education sector strategy and interventions. Under the country strategy and \nprogram (CSP) for Viet Nam 2007\u20132010, ADB is committed to long-term support for secondary \neducation as one of four key assistance areas. ADB investments in education have so far been \nmainly in secondary education, although support has also been provided more recently for \nvocational  training  and  higher  education.  ADB\u2019s  current  education  and  training  portfolio  is \nvalued at about $195 million, and the pipeline for 2010\u20132012 at about $230 million. All of the \nongoing projects will assist the Government in achieving the MDG and SESMP performance \ntargets for specific education levels and population groups.  \n \n43.  ADB\u2019s education investments have significantly contributed to progress in meeting the \nSESMP  development  targets:  (i) loans  2115  and  2384  have  helped  to  increase  LSE \nparticipation  rates  through  support  for  school  construction  and  LSS  teacher  development; \n(ii) loan 1979 has helped increase the USE participation rate by providing more then 2,000 \nclassrooms  and  school  dormitories;  (iii) loan  2384  has  helped  preserve  ethnic-minority \nlanguages through the development of language textbooks and instructional materials and \nthrough  multilingual  teacher  training;  and  (iv) a  public  expenditure  review  of  secondary \neducation and related capacity development programs, under TA 4603, laid the groundwork for \nan increase in the share of education to 20% of total government expenditure.  \n4.  Lessons Identified \n44.  Key lessons identified from all these projects are that to meet future challenges as Viet \nNam becomes increasingly self-reliant requires that (i) improved institutional capacity building be \na key focus of future projects; (ii) policies be reviewed to improve and coordinate sector wide \nstrategic  decisions;  (iii)  inclusiveness  be  redefined  to  include  groups  currently  not  receiving \nsufficient support; and (iv) innovation and research be better utilized to improve effectiveness and \nefficiency. How the Secondary Education Sector Development Program (SESDP) will incorporate \nthese issues is discussed in the Special Features section of this report (paras. 88\u201391).  \n \n45.  Long-term capacity building. Project-driven and project-based activities have not been \nfully successful in eliminating persistent weaknesses in equity, quality, systemic accountability, \nand  institutional  capacity.  A  comprehensive  and  dedicated  plan  for  institutional  and  human \nresource development  must  be designed to carry out  and sustain educational reforms in a \ndynamic socioeconomic environment to meet the country\u2019s new and emerging challenges. The \nreform actions, when implemented, will also protect ongoing investments in other development \nprojects in the sector.  \n ", "10 \n \n46.  Sector development program approach. Most ADB education projects in Viet Nam \nhave been primarily concerned with specific short-term development needs, in particular access \nand equity. These investment projects have assisted the country in meeting the urgent need to \nexpand and upgrade facilities and services and to increase enrollment, with expected positive, \ntangible, and quantifiable results. These investment projects have significantly helped improve \nenrollment,  transition,  retention,  and  teacher  training  in  the  secondary  school  subsector. \nHowever, a comprehensive approach to more-complex, systemic, issues of quality, efficiency, \nand capacity constraints demands policy-related reforms and initiatives.  \n \n47.  The sector development program (SDP) is thought to be superior to traditional project \napproaches  to  sustaining  reform.  An  SDP  is  an  appropriate  combination  of  policy  and \ninvestment  initiatives  that  will  enable  Viet  Nam  to  deal  more  effectively  with  the  major \nconstraints  on  secondary  education,  with  the  help  of  specific  supporting  investments.  The \nproposed  SESDP  responds  to  the  overall  subsector  difficulties  and  constraints  and \nrecommends policy and program initiatives for coping with these difficulties and constraints.  \n \n48.  Limited inclusiveness. Out-of-school youth and those with physical disabilities have \nnot received enough support under past policies and programs. Both of these groups must \nreceive targeted support to realize the key goals of universal access. Innovative programs will \nhave  to  be  pilot-tested  and  their  effectiveness  monitored  for  the  effective  use  of  limited \nresources within a new national policy framework. \n \n49.  Implementation  issues.  A  number  of  ADB\u2019s  education  projects  have  started  late \nbecause  of  delayed  loan  effectiveness.  With  better-harmonized  procedures  for  project \nadministration, the performance of projects has gradually improved. However, there are still \ndelays caused by such factors as the slow and complex approval of procurement plans and the \nlimited number of staff in the State Treasury assigned to the education sector.  \nIII.  THE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n50.  The expected impact of the program is enhanced learning outcomes and competitiveness \nof secondary school students. The program outcome will be improved quality and equity of the \nsecondary education system by 2015. \n \n51.  The proposed SESDP will support the Government\u2019s policy reform agenda for improving \nthe quality, accessibility, efficiency, and competitiveness of secondary education. It will involve a \nprogram loan for policy reforms and an accompanying investment loan to support local actions \nrelated to three key constraints on the subsector: sector management and accountability, quality \nand relevance, and access and equity. The implementation of the program and project loans will \nbe coordinated.  \nB.  Program Loan \n52.  Policy  reforms. The secondary education sector has achieved many of its current \nnational targets. Access has improved, due to the introduction of targeted national programs \nand effective use of support from development partners. However the challenge is in moving the \nsystem from the achievement of equitable access to schooling, to one where both access and \n ", "  11\nquality move towards international standards. For this next stage, the strengthening of the \neducation system is linked to poverty reduction. Viet Nam, which has emphasized the supply \nside of education, now has an opportunity to turn its attention to the demand for secondary \neducation that can ensure access to good education for all students, regardless of their location \nand personal circumstances.  \n \n53.  While the Government is responsible for setting national policies and programs, local \nautonomy for management decision has been a long-standing feature of Viet Nam's political \nlandscape. Local ownership has grown as a result, but fundamental difficulties have also arisen \nin relation to the clarity of functional assignments, financial management, accountability, and the \nmonitoring and evaluation of the efficiency of educational expenditure programs. The significant \ndifferences in outcomes and performance across local governments have created critical gaps \nin access and quality of service provision in some districts.  \n \n54.  In order to address concerns over the inconsistent quality of local delivery of educational \nservices there is an increasing need for the central government to ensure that its policy reform \nagenda and actions emphasize government leadership and ownership. This is a complex task \nwithin a devolved system and requires that the education policy framework is clear and relevant \nand adopted as the underpinning framework for local decision-making. As national policies and \nprograms apply at the local level, there is a need to establish clear policies, goals and measures \nincluding rewards and sanctions, all linked to the principles of access for all, equity of outcomes \nand an expectation of excellence and transparency of processes and outcomes that underpin \nthe achievement of the MDGs. The policy reform matrix is in Appendix 5 and the Policy Letter is \nin Appendix 6. \n \n55.  The program loan will support various outputs, as follows. \na.  Output 1: Effective and Accountable Management of Secondary \nEducation  \n56.  New subsector policy developed. The current subsector master plan, SESMP 2006\u2013\n2010, will expire in 2010. A new secondary education subsector master plan should be part of \nESSD 2011\u20132020, now being prepared by the Government. The MOET has issued the Decision \n7674/QD-BGDDT on the development of the new SESMP 2011\u20132015 and a draft concept paper \nin 2009. The preparation of the new SESMP will begin with a review of the progress made \nunder SESMP 2006\u20132010. After the draft SESMP 2011\u20132015 is approved, the new SESMP will \nstart functioning as a base subsector policy for secondary education by 2012. All provinces and \ndistricts will be brought under the national policy and accountability framework of this SESMP \nfor consistency of educational outcomes with ESSD 2011\u20132020.  \n \n57.  All secondary schools accredited. The MOET will develop and approve a new set of \nnational standards for secondary schools, last updated in 2007, in two phases\u2014a draft version in \n2009 and a modified version by 2012\u2014to make sure that all schools have appropriate school \nbuildings and facilities, and adequate numbers of teachers and instructional materials. These \nNSSs are especially important in the rural areas, where costs are often higher but incomes lower. \nAll schools, no matter where they are built, must meet the national standards for effective teaching \nand  learning.  A  conceptual  framework  for  quality  assurance  for  secondary  education  is  in \nAppendix 7. \n \n58.  MOET has issued Decision 83/2008/QD-BGDDT on procedure, criteria and standards of \nthe accreditation of all secondary schools. An independent accrediting agency (the National \n ", "12 \nAccreditation Board [NAB]) will be formed to undertake transparent and regular nationwide \naccreditation of all secondary schools\u2014public, semipublic, and private schools\u2014using the new \nNSSs. The nationwide accreditation will start by 2012.  \n \n59.  Improved  working  conditions  for  secondary  teachers.  Equitable,  effective,  and \nsuccessful human resource management has always been a concern of the Government. It has \nstriven to train people, use their talents and expertise efficiently and effectively, and suitably \nreward them for their efforts. The sustainable provision of qualified teachers to secondary \nschools in remote, ethnic-minority areas has also been a long-standing challenge. \n \n60.  MOET has finalized the ongoing review of its human resource management (HRM) \nstrategy, covering teacher recruitment reform,12 and draft a new HRM strategy to attract more \nqualified secondary school teachers. An improved HRM framework, including new regulations, \nwill be developed to match teacher placements to need and reward teachers for their efforts and \neffectiveness. There is also an urgent need for a new reward system to motivate teachers who \nlive and work in difficult conditions. The project survey of 20 disadvantaged provinces has \nshown  that  the  rewards  can  take  the  form  of  better  teacher  housing,  more-equitable \nopportunities for promotion through tailored career guidance, and instruction materials that meet \nlocal needs. By 2012, the MOET is expected to develop, pilot-test in selected provinces, and \napprove a comprehensive HRM strategy covering not only recruitment but also performance \nevaluation, transfers, incentives, and career development for secondary teachers.  \n    b.  Output 2: Improved Quality for International Competitiveness  \n61.  Secondary school teachers are certified and upgraded. The academic qualifications, \nknowledge, and teaching skills of secondary teachers must be systematically assured and \nmanaged. MOET has approved the new standards for secondary school teachers through \ncircular 30/2009/TT-BGDDT. The new standards identify the knowledge and skills that teachers \nmust have to teach more effectively. Three areas have been explored: (i) the subject knowledge \nrequired to teach effectively, (ii) the teaching skills needed to motivate students to learn, and \n(iii) the  attributes  required  of  teachers  to  be  highly  effective.  MOET  will  start  assessing \nsecondary teachers on the basis of the new standards, and will issue professional certificates to \nqualified teachers who meet the standards.  \n \n62.  The teacher standards describe different levels or standards of excellence, from those \nthat apply to a beginning teacher to those that define an excellent teacher, and will be used to \nreward excellence and to guide the professional development of teachers. They should replace \npromotion  and  reward  systems  based  on  years  of  service  with  a  competitive  system  of \npromotions and rewards based on the capacity of teachers to demonstrate excellence and \neffectiveness.  Teaching  standards  must  also  be  continuously  developed,  as  educational \nsystems recognize the centrality of teacher performance in high-quality outcomes of students. \nThese  new  national  standards  establish  a  clear  policy  framework  for  assessing  teacher \neffectiveness. The first nationwide teacher quality assessment will be undertaken and the first \nprofessional teacher certificates issued to qualified teachers by 2012.  \n \n63.  Learning assessment system is upgraded. Decision 51/2008/QD-BGDDT from MOET \npertains to the updating of the learning assessment system for secondary education. Under the \nproposed  SESDP,  two  new  learning  assessment  programs  will  be  supported:  (i) the  NAM \nprogram; and (ii) the OECD\u2019s PISA.  \n \n                                                 \n12 Decision 62/ 2007/QD-BGDDT: Recruitment of teachers of preschools, general education schools, and CECs. \n ", "  13\n64.  The NAM will start providing reliable and objective data on learning outcomes, which can \nbe used by MOET in planning its policies and by schools and teachers in improving their \neffectiveness. Its policy framework will guide local and national strategic decisions, especially in \ndirecting  resources  to  areas  of  concern.  MOET  will  develop,  approve,  and  pilot-test  the \nimplementation of the draft NAM  program by 2012. The results of the 2012 NAM  will be \nconsidered in the curricular reform scheduled for 2015. MOET has also officially approved the \ncountry\u2019s  participation  in  PISA  through  Decision  286/TB-BGDDT  (issued  on  5 May  2009). \nViet Nam will thus become the third country in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n(ASEAN), after Thailand and Indonesia, to participate in PISA. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) \nand MOET will register Viet Nam\u2019s participation in PISA and clear the technical and financial \nrequirements for the OECD assessment mission by 2012. The pilot-testing for PISA will start in \nselected LSSs.  \n \n65.  Secondary school curricula are updated regularly. Viet Nam has had few policies or \nregulations for systematic and periodic curriculum review. The school curriculum is therefore \nrevised ad hoc and according to curricular development theory and methods that do not meet \ninternational standards. As a result, the current secondary curriculum does not always meet the \nrequirements of society or the labor market. To improve the quality of the school curriculum, the \ncurriculum must be upgraded regularly. Minor revisions could be made every 5 years and a new \ncurriculum  developed  every  10  years.  Institutional  capacity  to  systematically  upgrade  the \nsecondary school curriculum according to international standards must also be strengthened.  \n \n66.  The regular review and upgrading of the secondary education curriculum is the subject of \nthe MOET Decision 7436/QD-BGDDT issued in 2008. MOET will create a task force to improve \nthe curriculum upgrading system. The curriculum will be reviewed regularly and revised every 5\u2013\n10 years to match content to the actual learning needs of society. The NAM program results will \nprovide added impetus for improving the problem-solving and analytical skills of students, which \nprevious curricular reviews and upgrading did not fully take up. MOET will issue a decision or \ncircular approving the new curriculum upgrading system by 2012. The new system will contribute \nto the development and pilot-testing of the draft secondary curriculum in selected provinces, which \nwill start in 2012.  \n \n67.  Information  and  communication  technology  is  promoted. ICT use in secondary \nschools is currently limited to school administration (e.g., e-mail communication between MOET \nand  its  local  offices)  and  basic  computer  courses  for  students.  MOET  has  issued \nDirective 55/2008/CT-BGDDT  (Enhancing  ICT  Application  for  Education  Sector  2008\u20132012) \npromoting the use of ICT in education. By 2012, MOET will approve a supplementary directive \non  the  use  of  ICT  to  support  effective  teaching  and  learning  in  secondary  schools.  The \nsupplementary decision will also define more clearly the expected impact of ICT use on the \nquality of education, and will include guidelines on the operation and maintenance of ICT \nfacilities in schools. The new ICT teacher training and institutional materials will be pilot-tested \nin selected schools, starting in 2012.  \n  c.  Output 3: Improved Access to and Equity of Education for \nDisadvantaged Groups \n68.  Continuing education is enhanced. Continuing education has been a key alternative \nlearning opportunity for disadvantaged youth who have no access to regular LSS because of \npoverty, distance to school, and the need to engage in seasonal labor. However, the poor \nquality of the programs and the limited facilities at CECs have been key obstacles to universal \nLSE. To improve the quality of continuing education and make it more accessible, MOET issued \nCircular 48/2008/TT-BGDDT (Guidance for Quality Standards and Assessment for Continuing \n ", "14 \nEducation  Centers),  which  redefines  continuing  education  and  sets  quality  standards.  A \nsupplementary MOET directive approving the expansion of the equivalency program for LSE at \nCECs will result in more-equitable opportunities for disadvantaged youth. By 2012, MOET will \nupgrade and approve the new CEC standards and LSE equivalency program and start its \npilot-testing in selected disadvantaged provinces.  \n \n69.  Opportunities for Disabled Students are Expanded. While the World Bank has been \nproviding some support to enable physically-disabled children to access primary education, \nthere has been no support provided to students with disabilities at secondary level. As a result, \nstudents with physical disabilities often need to give up secondary education since very few LSS \ncan  provide  these  students  safe  and  appropriate  learning  spaces,  particularly  in  the  poor \nprovinces. At household level, the families have a tendency in prioritizing their children without \ndisabilities for schooling since those families do not have incentives in sending their disabled \nchildren to normal schools which are often not affordable for the disadvantaged families. \n \n70.  To achieve universal LSE, it is necessary to provide learning opportunities for physically-\ndisabled students. MOET has issued the Decision 23/2006/QD-BGD&DT on changes to special \neducation from a \u2018separation approach\u2019 to an \u2018inclusive approach\u2019. The policy shift will ensure \nthat more disabled students are able to access mainstream schools with ensuing improvements \nin LSE participation rates. In 2009, MOET has prepared an action plan to integrate \"secondary\" \neducation in accordance with the above Decision. By 2012, MOET will: (i) develop and approve \nthe guidelines for integration of physically disabled children in mainstream secondary education; \nand  (ii)  establish  model  integrated  LSS  in  selected  provinces.  The  Program  will  start \nestablishing \"model integrated LSSs\" for physically-disabled students in all provinces and the \nawareness raising activities for integration education.   \n \n71.  Conditional cash transfer program is piloted. Decision 289/QD-TTg/2008 on targeted \nsupport for ethnic-minorities and poor households, issued by the Prime Minister, is expected to \nimprove the participation of ethnic-minority and female students in education. In 2009, MOET \nissued the Decision 7660/QD-BGDDT regarding the pilot-testing of a conditional cash transfer \n(CCT) program for LSE in 10 selected disadvantaged provinces. The program will provide \nfinancial incentives for sending children to school, to answer demand-side constraints that \ncontinue to limit the participation of poor ethnic-minority and female students. By 2012, MOET \nwill review the results of the CCT test run and compare the CCT approach with other existing \npolicies for scholarships and financial support. The results will inform future support for poor and \ndisadvantaged students. \nC.  Project Loan \n72.  The outputs of the proposed project loan (the Project) will be the same as those of the \nprogram loan except for an additional output (output 4), involving advisory support and capacity \ndevelopment activities for the effective and transparent implementation of the program activities. \nThe  target  provinces,  districts,  and  schools  covered  by  the  project  loan  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix A. The outputs to be supported by the project loan will be as follows. \na.  Output 1: Effective and Accountable Management of Secondary \nEducation \n73.  Updating of the secondary education sector master plan. The Project will provide \noverseas management training to relevant agencies in strategic policy planning for secondary \neducation. After SESDP 2011\u20132015 is developed, three national workshops (for dissemination, \ninterim review, and final achievement assessment) will be organized.  \n \n ", "  15\n74.  Updating of national secondary school standards. MOET will be assisted in updating \nthe NSSs for the nationwide accreditation of all secondary schools by the NAB. Overseas \ntraining (accreditation and quality assurance training for 60 person-days) and in-country training \nwill be provided to 1,260 persons from MOET, the DOETs, LSSs, and USSs. Females will \ncompose at least 40% of the participants in all overseas and in-country training. The draft \nstandards will be pilot-tested, and dissemination workshops on the new standards will be held \nfor the DOETs and schools.  \n \n75.  Establishment  of  the  National  Accreditation  Board. The Project will support the \nGovernment\u2019s decision to establish an independent accreditation and quality assurance agency \nfor all schools, both public and private. The support will cover training to establish and develop \nthe  capacity  of  the  NAB,  and  the  cost  of  the  first  nationwide  school  accreditation.  Staff \ndevelopment programs in quality assurance, including a degree program overseas, will total \nabout 800 person-days. The necessary equipment for the new office of the NAB will also be \nprovided.  In  addition,  the  project  loan  will  support  research  for  the  nationwide  school \naccreditation.  \n \n76.  Introduction of new human resource management strategy. The Project will support \nin-country training and a series of workshops in the new HRM strategy for secondary school \nteachers. DOET officers in charge of personnel and secondary school principals will be trained \nto apply the new strategy in schools. The new HRM strategy will undergo interim review and \nassessment in 2012 under the project loan. \nb.  Output 2: Improved Quality for International Competitiveness  \n77.  Certification and upgrading of secondary school teachers. The Project will (i) issue \nprofessional  teacher  certificates  to  teachers  who  qualify  in  the  nationwide  assessment  of \nteacher quality using the new secondary teacher standards, and (ii) provide in-service training to \n\u201cunqualified\u201d teachers to enable them to meet the standards. A survey to gauge the impact of \nthe new teacher standards on instruction will also be supported. The Project will provide the \nnecessary training and equipment to the relevant departments of MOET and to TTCs and TTUs \nto upgrade the training of unqualified teachers. The project loan will support the MOET and its \nregional offices in the first nationwide teacher assessment by 2012.  \n \n78.  Upgrading of the learning assessment system. The Project will help (i) develop the \nnew  NAM  system,  and  (ii) increase  participation  in  PISA  through  related  overseas  and \nin-country  training.  MOET  and  the  Institute  for  Education  and  Science  will  be  assisted  in \nestablishing  a  professionally  competent  assessment  unit  that  can  undertake  periodic, \nsample-based  assessments  of  learning  outcomes,  using  modern  methods.  Training \n(3,200 person-days), equipment and software, and the cost of pilot-testing and implementing the \nNAM system and PISA will be covered by the project loan. \n \n79.  Regular upgrading of the secondary school curriculum. Overseas and in-country \ntraining and the necessary sample instructional materials will be provided to strengthen the \ninstitutional  capacity  of  MOET  and  the  relevant  institutes  and  agencies  to  systematically \nupgrade  the  secondary  school  curriculum.  The  Project  will  support  the  development, \npilot-testing, and dissemination of the new secondary school curriculum for both LSE and USE \nin 2015, using information obtained in the NAM and the first PISA results available after 2012. \nStaff will be trained in the international standard method and practice of curriculum reform and \ntextbook  writing.  The  project  loan  will  cover  the  pilot-testing  of  the  draft  curriculum  and \n ", "16 \ntextbooks, based on the revised curriculum, and equipment for teaching practice centers under \nsix TTUs. \n \n80.  Promotion  of  information  and  communication  technology  use. The Project will \ndevelop and provide comprehensive technical support and background materials to facilitate the \npreparation  and  approval  of  a  supplementary  directive  on  the  use  of  ICT  in  secondary \neducation. It will include the development of a comprehensive plan including software and \nhardware requirements, ICT training programs for teaching and maintenance, and detailed \ncosting  and  plan  for  the  sustainable  financing  of  ICT.  An  appropriate  number  of  personal \ncomputers,  compatible  and  licensed  software,  and  supporting  accessories  for  effective \nclassrooms, as well as foreign-language training, will be provided to selected schools and TTUs \nnationwide.  The  Project  will  also  support  overseas  training  in  ICT-related  postgraduate \nuniversity  programs  in  countries  where  ICT  investments  have  been  empirically  linked  to \nimprovements in student learning outcomes.  \n \n81.  Improvement of foreign-language training. The Project will help MOET improve the \nquality of foreign-language training and facilities by developing a new program for the teaching \nof  English  to  speakers  of  other  languages  and  providing  training  based  on  the  program. \nEquipment  for language laboratories, overseas training for English teachers, and intensive \nEnglish training programs will be provided to 20 English teachers in TTCs and TTUs. In-country \nlanguage training will be provided to English teachers in 153 secondary schools and 423 subject \nteachers of specialized schools who teach their subjects in English.  \n \n82.  Support for gifted students. Previously a small number of special schools existed for \nstudents with exceptional talents in some subjects such as mathematics. However, MOET has \nconverted  the  specialized  schools  into  experimental  schools,  where  innovative  education \ntheories and practices are pilot-tested and practiced. The experimental schools have been \nestablished in 63 provinces and contribute to the improvement of the quality of teaching and \nlearning in regular secondary schools in the provinces. The Project will provide academically \nadvanced instructional materials and equipment and related teacher training. A tracer study of \ngraduates from the specialized schools and overseas training in the development of advanced \ninstructional materials and teaching methods for talented students will also be provided under \nthe Project. \nc.  Output 3: Improved Access to and Equity of Education for \nDisadvantaged Groups \n83.  Improved continuing education. The Project will help develop continuing education by \n(i) providing 234 classrooms, 20 laboratories, 7 libraries, 32 sanitation facilities, and instructional \nmaterials  to  17  CECs  in  the  most  disadvantaged  provinces;  and  (ii) developing  the  new \nequivalency program, including instructional materials and teacher training. An impact survey on \nthe enrollment rate of disadvantaged youth in continuing education will be conducted under the \nProject. \n \n84.  Increased access for physically disabled students. The Project will help establish \n63 model integrated LSSs in all provinces for physically disabled students by renovating and \nupgrading existing school buildings. Civil works will include the installation of ramps for students \nusing wheelchairs and crutches, and the renovation of school infirmaries including sanitation \nfacilities. Equipment and school furniture specifically designed to accommodate the needs of \npersons  with  disabilities  will  be  provided.  The  Project  will  address  demand-side  issues  in \nintegrated  education  by  raising  public  awareness  of  the  importance  and  value  of  LSE  to \n ", "  17\nphysically disabled children. The Project will also support the first large-scale in-service training \nfor special education teachers at the secondary level, targeting 1,260 teachers nationwide.  \n \n85.  Improved access and retention of poor, female, and ethnic minorities through \nconditional cash transfers. The Project will support MOET in pilot-testing a CCT program that \nbuilds  on  international  best  practices  for  improving  school  enrollment,  participation,  and \nretention by providing conditional grants to households and LSSs. The household grants will \nprovide about $120 per student per year in cash to very-poor families with children 11\u201314 years \nof age on the condition that the children enroll in LSSs and attend at least 85% of the classes. \nFemale students will be eligible for slightly higher grants of $140 per student per year. The \namounts correspond to the estimated direct and indirect costs of sending children to school. \nPayments will be made to beneficiary mothers at 3-month intervals, with an up-front payment of \nthe grant equivalent for 1 month upon the signing of the agreement, to help households enroll \ntheir children in school. \n \n86.  The school block grants will address supply-side concerns such as teacher availability, \nteacher housing, textbooks, classrooms, and sanitary facilities. Its use will be determined by a \nschool\u2013community board composed of local stakeholders including representatives of DOETs, \nschool administration, parents\u2019 associations, the Vietnam Women\u2019s Union, and ethnic minority \ngroups. The household and school grants will be transferred from MOET to the district bureau of \neducation and training offices, and from there to the individual school boards and households. \nThe CCT program will begin with a pre-pilot to test administrative, logistics, and other aspects of \nprogram implementation. The implementation plan for the CCT pilot program is in Appendix 8 \nand a detailed CCT report is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n  d.  Output 4: Program Implementation and Monitoring Support \n87.  Strengthened program implementation and monitoring capacity. The Project will \nsupport  program-specific  monitoring  and  assessment  of  results  based  on  the  performance \nindicators in the Program\u2019s design and monitoring framework. Related training programs will \nalso  be  provided  to  the  central  project  management  unit  (CPMU)  and  provincial  project \nmanagement units (PPMUs) and selected program implementation partners. In addition, the \nProject  will  provide  external  audit  services  covering  the  full  period  of  project  loan \nimplementation.  \n \n88.  Provision of implementation support. The Project will provide equipment, vehicles, \ncomputers  and  software,  and  other  necessary  materials  and  furniture  for  the  SESDP \nimplementation  units  of  MOET  and  the  PPMUs,  the  participating  academic  institutes,  and \nselected agencies to ensure smooth project management and implementation. The Project will \nalso provide expert international and national consultants to help MOET and other related \nagencies implement a timely and high-quality program. \nD.  Special Features \n89.  Sector  development  program  approach.  The  SESDP  will  be  the  first  SDP  in \nViet Nam\u2019s education sector. Like all other SDPs, the SESDP comprises a set of interlinked \npolicy  reforms  and  investments.  The  three  key  policy  domains  are  fully  compatible  with \nESSD 2011\u20132020 and are anchored in the Government\u2019s policy reform agenda for secondary \neducation. The Program recognizes recent key policy actions while supporting the complex \nreform program in the medium term. The proposed investments are consistent with these \npolicies and support their effective implementation. The improvement of the quality of secondary \n ", "18 \neducation with an equitable approach to resource utilization is the overall objective. The SDP \nmechanism allows simultaneous progress on both policy and project fronts. \n \n90.  Expansion of targeted support. Past and ongoing ADB projects have been poverty \noriented, and the investment priority has primarily centered on access to schooling for the \ndisadvantaged such as ethnic minorities and girls. SESDP will continue to assist them but will \nalso target other disadvantaged groups that have been identified as vital to achieving universal \nLSE, such as physically disabled students. \n \n91.  Pilot-testing of the conditional cash transfer program. SESDP will pilot-test a CCT \nprogram that provides financial support to poor families to encourage increased enrollment, \nparticipation, and retention of poor, female, and ethnic-minority students. Previously, financial \nsupport was mainly provided through scholarships to students in disadvantaged regions who \nwere already enrolled in school. To achieve universal LSE, out-of-school youth from the poorest \nfamilies must be brought into the school system. The CCT pilot program introduces a new and \ninnovative approach to achieving universal LSE by addressing demand-side constraints on poor \nfamilies who cannot afford to send their children to school. At the same time, the pilot program \nwill respond to the remaining supply-side needs through school block grants.  \nE.  Loan Amounts, Terms, and Financing Plan \n92.  Overall financing plan. To help finance the estimated cost of the SESDP of $71 million \nequivalent, the Government of Viet Nam has requested ADB for an SDP loan of $60 million \nequivalent  (84.5%  of  the  total)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  (Asian  Development \nFund)\u2014a program loan of $20 million (equivalent to SDR12,539,000) and a project loan of $40 \nmillion (equivalent to SDR25,079,000). The Government will provide counterpart funds of $11 \nmillion equivalent (15.5%)\u2014$7.3 million equivalent (10.28%) from the central budget and $3.7 \nmillion (5.21%) from provincial budgets\u2014for a construction site survey, maintenance of facilities, \nequipment to be procured under the SESDP, and taxes and duties. The financing plan for \nSESDP is summarized in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Financing Plan \n \nTotal \nSource  ($ million)    % \nAsian Development Bank: Program Loan (ADF)  20.00     28.17 \nAsian Development Bank: Project Loan (ADF)  40.00     56.34 \nGovernment, Central    7.30     10.28 \nGovernment, Provincial    3.70     5.21 \n  Total    71.00    100.00 \nADF = Asian Development Fund. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \n93.  Terms and tranches of the program loan. The program loan of $20 million will have a \nterm of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest rate charge of 1% per year \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per year after that. The size of the program loan was \ndetermined by the strength of the policy package and its development impact. The loan amount \ncovers  part  of  the  adjustment  costs  for  the  measures  included  in  the  policy  matrix  to  be \nimplemented over the first 3 years of loan implementation. The proceeds of the program loan \nwill be disbursed in accordance with the State Budget Law to cover the following expenditures: \n(i) costs of legal procedures for the development and approval of new circulars and directives; \n(ii) human resource and operating costs of various task forces and agencies such as NAB, \n ", "  19\nwhich will be established under the SESDP; (iii) costs involved in the upgrading of the teaching \nand management staff; (iv) costs of interministerial consultation and coordination for each policy \nreform action; and (v) other costs related to reform actions. The adjustment costs for the policy \nreforms are identified in Appendix 9. \n \n94.  The program loan will be released in two tranches. The first tranche of $5 million will be \nreleased  after  the  Government  meets  the  agreed  conditions  in  the  policy  reform  matrix \n(Appendix 5). The second tranche of $15 million is expected to be released 24 months after \nloan  effectiveness  provided  that  ADB  is  satisfied  that  the  Government  has  made  enough \nprogress in implementing the Program and, in particular, has met all the conditions in the policy \nreform matrix for the release of the second tranche.  \n \n95.  Project loan terms and investment plan. The project loan of $40 million will cover the \nbase costs of the project activities, physical and price contingencies, and interest and other \ncharges during implementation. The loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period \nof 8 years, and an interest rate charge of 1% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per \nyear after that. The costs are summarized in Table 2.

Project  management.  The  Government  will  establish,  within  3  months  of  loan \neffectiveness, an SESDP steering committee chaired by the vice minister of education and \ntraining to guide and supervise the overall management of the SESDP. The steering committee \nwill comprise representatives from the relevant ministries and agencies including the Office of \nGovernment, MOET, MOF, the Ministry of Planning and Investment, and the State Bank of \nViet Nam.  \n \n97.  MOET will be responsible for overall program management as the Executing Agency. It \nwill guide the CPMU, the implementation agency to be established in MOET to oversee day-to-\nday SESDP implementation. The CPMU will comprise a qualified full-time project manager, a \ndeputy project manager, and key technical staff including specialists in learning assessment, \ncurriculum and instructional materials, finance, procurement, civil works, teacher training and \n ", "20 \ndevelopment, monitoring and evaluation, social and community development, and ICT. The \nCPMU manager and staff will be appointed by the Government, and the appointments will be \napproved by ADB. \n \n98.  PPMUs will be formed, within 3 months of loan effectiveness, in the DOETs of all target \nprovinces, given their success in past and ongoing project implementation. The PPMUs will \nimplement, coordinate, monitor, and report activities in the provinces with instruction and guidance \nfrom the CPMU. The TTUs and TTCs will be involved in the SESDP implementation under the \nguidance of the CPMU. The implementation organization chart is in Appendix 11. \n \n99.  Implementation period. The program loan will be implemented from January 2008 to \nDecember 2012, and the project loan from June 2010 to June 2015. The project loan will close \non 31 December 2015. The detailed implementation schedule is in Appendix 12. \n \n100.  Procurement. For the program loan, the loan proceeds will be used to finance the full \nforeign exchange costs of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding \nineligible items in Appendix 13 and imports financed from other bilateral and multilateral sources. \nFor the project loan, all procurement of goods and works to be financed under an ADB loan will be \ncarried out according to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \nThe CPMU, in close cooperation with relevant PPMUs, will be responsible for all procurement.  \n \n101.  Contract packages for goods valued at more than $1.0 million (or its equivalent) will be \nprocured through international competitive bidding. Contract packages for goods valued at less \nthan $1.0 million (or its equivalent) but more than $100,000 (or its equivalent) will be procured \nthrough national competitive bidding (NCB) consistent with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. Since \nthe proposed civil works will involve only small-scale construction such as the extension of CECs \nor the renovation of the integrated lower secondary schools to install ramps to accommodate \nwheelchairs and crutches, all civil works contracts will be procured through NCB. Modifications \nand clarifications that need to be made in the Borrower\u2019s NCB procedures must be agreed on by \nADB and the Borrower. Goods packages and (where appropriate) works packages valued below \n$100,000 (or its equivalent) will be procured through shopping, according to ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines.   \n \n102.  MOET will develop and update the procurement plan with the contract packages for the \nproject loan (Appendix 14), and have it reviewed and approved by ADB. Within 1 year of loan \neffectiveness MOET will submit for ADB\u2019s approval a revised procurement plan that captures all \nprocurement that is ongoing or planned for the next 18 months. The plan will be updated yearly \nin the same way throughout the Program. MOET will undertake advance procurement action for \nthe recruitment of an individual consultant in the case of the international project facilitation \nadviser. ADB\u2019s concurrence with advanced action does not commit ADB to finance related \nexpenditure under the SESDP or to finance the SESDP.  \n \n103.  Consulting services. Consultants will be recruited in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). For smooth start-up, the international \nand national project facilitation advisers will be selected and hired individually to help CPMU develop \na solid implementation framework. The rest of the services will be provided by an international firm, \nto be selected and hired through quality- and cost-based selection, at the standard quality\u2013cost ratio \nof 80:20.  \n \n104.  The Project will provide 388 person-months of consulting services\u201468 international and \n320 national. The international consultants, to be recruited through an international firm, will \ncomprise experts in (i) education system and curriculum improvement, (ii) school standards and \n ", "  21\naccreditation, (iii) learning assessment, (iv) ICT for education, (v) inclusive education, (vi) CCT, \n(vii) gender and ethnic minorities, and (viii) procurement. The national consultants will have \nexpertise in (i) education system and policy development, (ii) school accreditation, (iii) teacher \ncertification and accreditation, (iv) teacher assessment, (v) national achievement monitoring, (vi) \ninternational-standard learning assessment and PISA support, (vii) curriculum and instructional \nmaterial  upgrading,  (viii)  ICT  for  education,  (ix)  foreign-language  training,  (x)  continuing \neducation, (xi) civil works, (xii) inclusive education, (xiii) CCT, (xiv) gender and ethnic minorities, \n(xv) procurement, and (xvi) monitoring and evaluation. A summary of the consulting services is \nin Appendix 15 and details are in Supplementary Appendix C.  \n \n105.  Overseas training will be provided by international training providers, including research \ninstitutes and universities, which will be selected through fixed-budget selection. Detailed terms \nof reference and selection criteria for the overseas training providers will be developed by \nCPMU with the assistance of international consultants during implementation.  \n \n106.  Governance  and  anticorruption  measures. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the Government. Consistent with its \ncommitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to \ninvestigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive \npractices  relating  to  the  Program.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the bidding documents for the \nProgram. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Program shall \ninclude provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of \nthe MOET and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate \nto the Program.  \n \n107.  In addition to these requirements, to deter corruption and increase transparency, the \nGovernment will disclose information about public procurement, including that related to the \nProgram, on the procurement website. For each contract, the list of participating bidders, the \nname of the winning bidder, basic details on the bidding procedures adopted, the amount of the \ncontract award, and the list of goods and services procured, among other things, will be found \non  MOET\u2019s  project  website.  Within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  shall \nestablish a grievance redress task force at the MOET, to the satisfaction of ADB, to receive and \nresolve complaints and grievances or act upon reports from stakeholders on misuse of funds \nand other irregularities, including ay grievance related to the CCT pilot program. The task force \nwill (i) review and address grievances of stakeholders of the Program, in relation to either the \nProgram, any of the service providers, or any person responsible for carrying out any aspect of \nthe Program; and (ii) proactively and constructively respond to them. \n \n108.  Disbursement  arrangements.  For  the  program  loan,  as  provided  in  ADB\u2019s \nSimplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans,13 the \nproceeds will be disbursed to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam as the Borrower. No supporting \nimport documentation will be required, provided that the value of Viet Nam\u2019s total imports, minus \nimports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official \ndevelopment assistance, is at least equal to the amount of the loan to be disbursed. The \nGovernment will certify its compliance with this formula with its withdrawal request. Otherwise, \nimport documentation under existing procedures will be required. ADB will have the right to \naudit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification. As such, \nthe procedures for procurement and disbursement of funds, and the use of counterpart funds, \nare felt to be satisfactory. \n                                                 \n13  ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n ", "22 \n \n109.  For  the  project  loan,  the  ADB  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  according  to  the \nprocedures in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). To \nspeed  up  project  implementation  through  the  timely  release  of  loan  proceeds  for  eligible \nexpenditures, a dollar imprest account will be established by the Government at a commercial \nbank chosen by the State Bank of Viet Nam and acceptable to ADB. The ceiling of the account \nand the initial amount deposited in it will not exceed $2 million equivalent or the estimated \nexpenditures for the next 6 months to be funded through the imprest account, whichever is less. \nThe  imprest  account  will  be  managed  and  administered  by  the  CPMU.  The \nstatement-of-expenditures  (SOE)  procedure  may  be  used  when  seeking  reimbursement  of \neligible expenditures and liquidating advances made into the imprest account according to the \nguidelines. Each payment to be reimbursed or liquidated under the SOE will not exceed the \nequivalent of $100,000. The funds flow arrangement is in Appendix 16. \n \n110.  Accounting,  auditing,  and  reporting.  MOET,  on  behalf  of  the  Government,  will \nmaintain separate records and accounts for the Project to identify goods and services financed \nfrom the loan proceeds. Project accounts, including financial statements, and SOE and imprest \naccount records, will be audited yearly by independent external auditors selected through a \ncompetitive procedure acceptable to ADB, according to the provisions of the Loan Agreement. \nThe auditors\u2019 services will be financed from the loan proceeds. The audit report and copies of \nthe certified accounts and related financial statements will be submitted to ADB no later than \n6 months after each fiscal year. The audit report will include the auditors\u2019 opinion on the use of \nloan proceeds, compliance with loan covenants, and the use of the imprest account under \nADB\u2019s SOE procedure. A separate audit opinion will be issued on the use of the imprest \naccount  and  the  SOE  procedure.  The  financial  management  assessment  and  fiduciary \nassessment, including the risk management and mitigation of procurement and corruption risk \nassessed under the midterm review of the CSP for Viet Nam 2008\u20132010, is in Supplementary \nAppendix D. \n \n111.  The CPMU will prepare quarterly reports on project implementation and submit them to \nADB  within  30  days  after  each  quarter.  These  reports,  which  will  include  data  on  the \nimplementation targets and their fulfillment, the problems and constraints faced, and proposed \nactions and solutions, will be submitted in English, in a format acceptable to ADB. Within \n3 months after the physical completion of the Project, the CPMU will submit to ADB a project \ncompletion report providing details of project implementation, accomplishments, and impact.  \n \n112.  Program and project performance monitoring and evaluation. To monitor the overall \nprogress made by the SESDP in achieving the expected outcomes, MOET will establish a \nperformance  monitoring  system  using  the  results-based  monitoring  indicators  from \nSESMP 2011\u20132015 with baseline information from MOET\u2019s existing education management \ninformation system. CPMU will collect the education sector performance indicators annually and \nassess the progress and impact of the SESDP. The Government and ADB will conduct joint \nSESDP  reviews,  including  an  inception  mission,  regular  reviews,  a  midterm  review,  and \ncompletion reviews. The reviews will examine and assess (i) the implementation and progress \nof the Program and its outcomes, activities, inputs, administration, financial performance, policy \nreforms provided in the development policy letter, and institutional and sustainability aspects \nincluding aid coordination; and (ii) compliance with social, environmental, financial, and other \ncovenants in the Loan Agreement.  \n \n113.  Stakeholder  participation  and  consultation. The Program will be implemented in \nclose consultation with central and local stakeholders. For the policy reform program, the MOET \nand the MOF will share the responsibility for interministerial consultation and coordination to \n ", "  23\nobtain consensus on the procedures and expected outcomes that will fulfill the conditions for \ntranche release. The participation of local stakeholders, including communities, nongovernment \norganizations,  and  district  governments  in  the  SESDP  activities,  is  essential  for  the \nimplementation of some subcomponents in the disadvantaged regions. Communication and \nconsultation strategies will generate support from ethnic-minority communities, particularly for \nparticipation in LSE. Such strategies can use village assemblies and other state-sponsored \nvillage organizations. Ethnic minorities tend to be organized around the village and village \nauthorities that have considerable legitimacy as a result.14 The gia lang (village council) can \nbecome a program strategy for reaching ethnic-minority communities. It will be appropriate to \nseek the support of nongovernment organizations and prominent ethnic-minority intellectuals \nwith close links with their communities of origin. \nIV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACT, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impact \n114.  Sector  benefits.  The  secondary  education  sector  will  benefit  directly  from \n(i) strengthened  quality  control  and  assessment  of  secondary  teachers  and  schools; \n(ii) improved  learning  outcomes  of  students,  measured  through  internationally  standardized \ntests,  which  will  provide  information  for  the  upgrading  of  the  secondary  curriculum  and \ntextbooks; (iii) more-effective teaching and learning with the use of ICT and other modernized \ninstructional  materials;  and  (iv) a  significant  increase  in  secondary  school  coverage  with \nnarrower  gaps  between  males  and  females,  between  income  groups,  and  between  ethnic \ngroups. \n \n115.  Economic and financial benefits. The major economic benefits of the Program will \ninclude improved productivity of secondary school graduates and cost savings due to increased \nsystem efficiency. The Program will (i) increase the number of secondary school graduates; \n(ii) improve the skills and performance of secondary school graduates in the labor market, \nleading to increased earnings; and (iii) reduce the unit costs of schooling per student through \nimproved  participation  and  completion  rates  in  secondary  education.  The  economic  and \nfinancial analysis of the Program is in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n \n116.  Social impact. The Program will directly benefit ethnic-minority and poor students by \nmaking  secondary  education  more  accessible  and  affordable.  The  pilot  CCT  program  will \naddress demand-side constraints and reduce the direct and indirect costs of education. It will \nimprove the human capital of children of poor households and reduce intergenerational poverty \nin the future. The pilot program will also address supply gaps in the sector through community \nparticipation and school block grants. Community awareness-raising activities will demonstrate \nthe benefits of school participation. The pilot program is expected to have significant impact in \nreducing the poverty of poor households, improving the attendance of children enrolled in \nschool, improving transition rates to LSS and from LSS to USS, increasing the number of years \nof education completed by poor children, and reducing child labor. In addition, support for \ncontinuing education and improved access for students with disabilities will address long-term \nconstraints on equitable access to secondary education for groups that have traditionally been \nexcluded from attaining education beyond primary school. The summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy is in Appendix 17. \n \n                                                 \n14  ADB. 2002. Indigenous Peoples/Ethnic Minorities and Poverty Reduction in Viet Nam. Manila. \n ", "24 \n117.  Gender impact. There are considerable and well-documented gains to society from \nimproved  educational  attainment,  and  social  benefits  are  particularly  profound  where  girls\u2019 \neducation  is  improved.  Empirical  evidence  demonstrates  that  educated  girls  have  reduced \nfertility rates, provide better nutrition for their families, and are more likely to use health services. \nEducated mothers are more likely to send their own daughters to school, thus breaking the \nintergenerational  transmission  of  poverty.  The  Program  will  directly  address  the  limited \nenrollment of female students by providing larger cash transfers to girls through the CCT pilot \nprogram. Families will thus have financial incentives to address the larger opportunity costs of \nsending  girls  to  school.  Channeling  the  funds  directly  to  mothers  will  promote  women\u2019s \nempowerment.  In  addition,  gender  issues  will  be  incorporated  into  the  overall  program.  A \ngender action plan has been developed to ensure participation, equal access, and equitable \nbenefits to men and women from program activities. Specific actions will ensure that women are \nequitably  represented  in  all  training  programs,  and  are  key  project  stakeholders  and \nbeneficiaries.  Curricula  and  laws  supported  by  the  Program  will  be  screened  for \ngender sensitivity, and the Government will see to it that all activities are consistent with the Law \non Gender Equality. The gender and ethnic-minority action plan is in Appendix 18. \n \n118.  Impact on ethnic minorities. The Program is not expected to have any negative impact \non ethnic minorities and will not discriminate against ethnic minorities or other marginalized \ngroups. In accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998), the Program has been \nclassified as category B. Specific actions have been included to ensure that (i) ethnic minorities \nand other vulnerable groups are part of all capacity-building and training processes, (ii) minority \nand marginalized groups are represented on community-school boards in proportion to their \noverall  population  in  the  community,  and  (iii) ethnic  minorities  benefit  proportionally  from \nimproved access to and quality of secondary education. These actions are further detailed in the \ngender and ethnic-minority action plan in Appendix 18. \n \n119.  Resettlement. No involuntary resettlement or land acquisition is foreseen under the \nSESDP.  \n \n120.  Environmental aspects. No negative environment impact from the Program is foreseen. \nThe  Program  will  finance  only  minor  civil  works  involving  the  construction  of  additional \nclassrooms in existing CECs or the renovation of selected secondary schools to install ramps to \naccommodate wheelchairs for disabled students.  \nB.  Assumptions and Risks \n121.  Local support for reforms. The SESDP outlines a range of policy initiatives that require \nthe support of the Government. While ADB has been undertaking intensive policy dialogue with \nMOET and other government agencies and confirmed their commitment to the proposed reform \nactions, there are still concerns about potential local government resistance to some of the \nproposed reforms. The reforms related to human resource management in particular are not \neasy for the local governments to accept, as they are responsible for recruiting and paying the \nsalaries of LSE teachers. Efforts will be made to obtain the support of local authorities through \nconsultations to explain the outputs and benefits of the reform actions. \n \n122.  Technical  capacity  constraints.  The  success  of  the  Program  requires  substantial \ntechnical knowledge and management capacity. In particular, the establishment of the NAB and \nthe development and adoption of the NAM and PISA need staff with expertise in educational \ntesting and psychometrics, and the management of an independent organization. Institutional \ncapacity development through timely staff training will be essential.  \n ", "  25\n123.  Program loan utilization. To ensure that the proceeds of the program loan are used to \nsupport the agreed policy reforms, the loan amount has been earmarked for the policy reform \nactions and both MOET and MOF will be responsible for the timely fulfillment of the target \nactions. Close interministerial coordination and a solid and transparent funds flow arrangement \nwill be the key to the successful implementation of the Program.   \nV.   ASSURANCES \n124.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The Government will ensure that the counterpart funds for project implementation \nare provided on time, and that MOET makes available all funds and resources \nnecessary for construction and operation and maintenance of the Program on a \ntimely  basis.  The  Government  will  also  make  timely  submission  of  annual \nbudgetary  appropriation  requests  and  ensure  prompt  disbursement  of \nappropriated funds during each year of program implementation. \n(ii)  The  Government  will  cause  the  MOET  to  ensure  that  the  gender  and \nethnic-minority action plan agreed on between the Government and ADB is fully \nimplemented and budgeted for and that all program activities are designed and \nimplemented in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998) \nand Policy on Indigenous People. This includes, but is not limited to, ensuring that \n(a) 40% female representation in Program-supported training programs; (b) ethnic \nminority  representation  in  training  supported  by  the  Program  is  at  least \nproportionate to their representation in the training pool and not less than 10%; and \n(c) all monitoring and evaluation data is disaggregated by sex and ethnicity. \n(iii)  MOET will design, construct, and operate the physical facilities to be upgraded or \nconstructed under the Program in line with the Government\u2019s environmental laws \nand regulations and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). In case of discrepancies \nbetween  the  Government\u2019s  laws,  regulations,  and  procedures  and  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy, ADB\u2019s policy will prevail. \n(iv)  The Government will establish, by December 2011, the monitoring framework, \nwhich will enable the progress tracking of secondary graduates in both higher \neducation  institutions  and  the  work  environment  and  generate  feedback  for \nimproving  the  relevance,  management  and  implementation  of  secondary \neducation. \n(v)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  (a) the  CCT  program  is  implemented,  and \n(b) agreements  are  executed  with  the  selected  households  for  CCT  support \nensuring that their children will enroll in LSSs and attend at least 85% of classes; \nand \n(vi)  The Government will ensure that (a) transparent and merit-based selection citeria \nare  developed  and  agreed  on  between  the  Government  and  ADB  for  the \noverseas  training  of  the  teachers  and  the  teachers  are  strictly  selected  in \naccordance with the agreed selection criteria; and (b) agreements are executed \nwith all selected candidates for receiving overseas training, financed under the \nProgram, ensuring that the training recipients continue working with the same \nministry or institution from which they were originally selected for at least 3 years \nafter completing the overseas training program.  \n \n125.  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, MOET will establish and submit to ADB for \napproval, the baseline data and monitoring and evaluation indicators, paying particular attention \nto gender-disaggregated data. \n ", "26 \n \nVI.

Sector overview. Viet Nam has experienced significant economic success over recent \nyears. This success has resulted from considerable effort being directed at developing a skilled \nand knowledgeable workforce through a focus on improving educational opportunities for all. \nWhile this success is applauded, a closer analysis of the situation indicates that only 27% of the \nnational  labor  force  meets  international  training  standards,  compared  with  50%  for  other \ndeveloping  countries  in  the  region.  However,  the  Government  recognizes  that,  to  remain \ncompetitive, it must increase the educational levels of the workforce. It has therefore set for itself \nthe target of improving the proportion of the workforce with the required formal skills to 40% by \n2010, and to 60% by 2020. \n \n2.  This need to build capacity through a greater focus on policy development, as well as \ncontinued support for targeted programs, stems in part from the reality that Viet Nam is rapidly \nadvancing toward an average per capita income of $1,000, which it is expected to achieve by \n2010. This will result in its being accorded middle-income country status and eventually lead to \ngreater internal funding of educational programs. For the country to make a successful transition \nfrom aid dependence to increased financial self-reliance, it must develop greater policy and \nstrategic planning capacity. This will require improved internal capacity to collect and analyze \ndata as the basis for identifying future areas of need, and to use resources effectively to improve \naccess to and the quality of capacity building programs.  \n \n3.  Policy planning and finance under decentralization. The Ministry of Education and \nTraining  (MOET)  oversees  the  education  sector  and  is  responsible  for  setting  broad  policy \ndirections for all levels of education. However, management responsibility for school buildings, \nstaffing,  and  distribution  of  financial  resources  has  been  progressively  decentralized,  with \nuniversities being directly managed by MOET, upper secondary education schools (USSs) and \nprofessional secondary schools being managed at the provincial level by the departments of \neducation and training, and lower secondary schools and primary schools being managed locally \nin the districts or communes by district bureaus of education and training. Service provision has \nbecome increasingly decentralized through the removal of controls from the center and the \nincrease in revenue-raising powers at the local level.  \n \n4.  While  all  local  governments  must  adopt  national  policies,  there  are  considerable \ndifferences in educational outcomes between regions and provinces. Reducing gaps in regional \neducational performance outcomes is central to improving national performance and is one of the \nbiggest challenges facing both developing and developed countries. All students, irrespective of \ntheir local circumstances, must have access to good-quality schooling. The central Government \nmust therefore play a major role in seeing to it that all schools meet minimum performance \nstandards by implementing national policies that are constantly reviewed and amended on the \nbasis of periodic and comprehensive monitoring and assessment of sector performance and \nresults. Part of this process will be reviewing funding arrangements, although this will be an \nactivity over the longer term, when more valid and reliable national data become available. \n \n5.  School funding is a complex process, with revenue provided at the State, province, and \nlocal levels. Funds provided by the State are distributed according to a per-capita weighted index \nof disadvantage. This is supplemented at the local level through the application of fees that cover \nnecessary teaching and learning expenses and school development. Through targeted programs, \nthe State provides fee relief and scholarships to students who are policy beneficiaries, such as \nethnic minorities, students who live in difficult circumstances, the poor, and excellent learners in \nboth public and nonpublic schools at all levels of schooling. \n ", "34  Appendix 2 \n  \n6.  Quality assurance of secondary schools. While secondary school provision continues \nto expand, many rural and isolated students still have considerable difficulty gaining access to \ngood-quality secondary education. Many poorer communities have secondary schools whose \nfacilities are not suited to the modern pedagogical approaches adopted by teachers. With limited \nfacilities, teachers cannot use small-group and problem-solving approaches that are central to \nimproving learning outcomes.  \n \n7.  Several standards have been developed to assist in the establishment of quality schools. \nInternational standards provide broad guidelines for lower secondary schools (LSSs) and USSs \nand assist in the development of national standards to guarantee access to facilities that facilitate \ngood-quality learning for all students. National standards are now being developed, but these \nmust  undergo  quality  assurance  to  make  certain  that  the  standards  equate  with  current \ninternational standards. As part of this process, fundamental school quality levels are being \ndeveloped for LSSs; similar standards must also be developed for USSs, as part of future \ninvestment projects. While high national standards are a central part of a strong national policy \nframework, they must apply nationwide and all schools must meet these standards irrespective of \nlocation or local circumstances. \n \n8.  Private provision of schooling. The majority of formal education and training is publicly \nprovided  through  state-run  schools,  colleges,  universities,  and  training  centers.  There  are, \nhowever,  a  number  of  nonpublic  institutions  operating  at  each  level.  The  Government  has \nestablished a policy of encouraging the development of nonpublic or private schools, although the \neducation  law  states  that  private,  people-funded,  and  semipublic  schools  all  belong  to  and \ncontribute to the national education system. Nonpublic schools therefore benefit from incentives \nrelated to facilities, land, taxes, fees, credit, insurance, and commendation and reward systems. \nThe  same  expectations  and  laws  apply  to  both  nonpublic  and  public  schools  in  the \nimplementation  of  the  objectives,  contents,  curriculum,  textbooks,  teaching  methods,  and \nregulations relating to enrollment, teaching and learning, examinations, completion requirements, \ndiploma certification, and other matters. The nonpublic school system has been established at all \neducation levels, from early childhood care to higher education. \n  \n9.  However, what is apparent is the lack of quality control across all schools and of national \nstandards for the quality of facilities and for the competencies and professional skills required for \neffective teaching, as well as an improved curriculum. Current policies will have to be reviewed \nand new strategic plans developed for a coordinated national approach to improvement.  \n \n10.  While the need to develop national standards has been mentioned, these standards must \napply to all schools. Current performance data highlight considerable national variation in the \nquality of schools and in student achievement. To improve national consistency and reliability, an \nindependent, specialized agency must be established to accredit schools, so that all students, \nirrespective  of  their  local  circumstances,  have  access  to  good  schools  and  programs.  This \nagency will also assist in strategic decision making, as areas of need are identified through \nindependent, objective analysis of performance, and provide the Government with relevant and \naccurate data for the effective deployment of resources. \n \n11.  Quality assurance of secondary teachers. There is considerable evidence that the \nquality of teaching is central to improving student learning outcomes, as good teachers are \nknowledgeable and able to use a range of pedagogical approaches to improve student learning \noutcomes. Recent research on what teachers should know and should be able to do has been \nused to develop a range of teacher standards. This development has been critical to improving \nteacher performance, as it has enabled analytical and objective analysis of performance. Many \n ", "Appendix 2  35\nsystems use teacher standards to make certain that all teachers have the skills, knowledge, and \nattributes  to  teach  well.  These  standards  inform  training  programs  and  focus  professional \ndevelopment programs on improving teacher effectiveness.  \n \n12.  They are also used as the basis for initial selection and promotion, as there is a high \ncorrelation between standards and student learning outcomes. While student learning outcomes \nare critical to evaluating teacher effectiveness, they should be used within a broader teacher \nstandards framework, as not all students come from backgrounds that assist learning. Processes \nare being developed to measure the \u201cvalue-added\u201d component of teacher effectiveness, where \nstudent background factors are acknowledged and measured, enabling judgments to be made \nabout what an individual teacher adds to a student\u2019s learning irrespective of background factors. \nFor teacher standards to be effectively used, support must be given for their use as the basis for \ninitial training, for the upgrading of qualifications and skills, and for promotion. \n \n13.  Human resource management of teachers. Effectively managing teachers is critical to \nimproving student learning nationwide. To start with, a teacher workforce plan that identifies \nfuture teacher needs must be developed on the basis of projected enrollment and teacher attrition. \nThis analysis must be refined to identify locations and specialist subject teachers where future \nshortages are likely. Teacher training can thus be planned so that sufficient, but not excessive, \nnumbers of teachers are trained to meet projected needs. Incentives may have to be provided to \nmeet expected vacancies in hard-to-staff locations.  \n \n14.  The initial process of selecting potential teachers must also be better planned to better \nensure that those who enter teacher training have the required attributes and abilities to develop \ninto successful teachers. Countries like Singapore and Finland use rigorous selection based on \nteacher  standards  to  select  candidates  for  teacher  training.  National  teacher  graduation \nstandards also make certain that all teacher-training graduates meet national standards, and that \nstudents,  irrespective  of  location,  are  taught  by  teachers  who  meet  the  national  standards. \nGraduates also require support in their first years of teaching, and the support must be of high \nquality.  Teacher  standards  for  experienced  and  highly  effective  teachers  allow  teacher \neffectiveness, and no longer years of service, to be used as the basis for promotion.  \n \n15.  Good teachers are critical to improving student-learning outcomes, but so are highly \ncompetent school principals. Many educational systems, recognizing the centrality of school \nleadership, have established leadership colleges and developed standards for school leaders and \nprincipals.  Many  require  prospective  principals  to  demonstrate  that  they  meet  leadership \nstandards before they can be considered for appointment. \n \n16.  Many of the aspects associated with effective human resource management of teachers \nare currently under development, but much more is needed before a national and consistent \napproach to the overall management of teachers is achieved. Such an approach is central to \nimproving teacher effectiveness and improving student learning outcomes. \n \n17.  Learning assessment system. National tests that are more valid, more reliable, and \nfairer are proposed. Viet Nam\u2019s participation in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment (OECD) Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) in 2012 would \nenable educational policy planners to analyze performance between provinces and districts, and \nto compare national performance against international norms. Better strategic decisions would be \nmade, equalizing opportunities as well as highlighting national areas for further development. It is \nanticipated that participation in PISA will enable 15-year old students to apply the knowledge and \nskills  they  have  acquired  to  solve  problems,  and  teachers  to  gain  an  increased  focus  on \nmore-effective educational practices instead of rote learning. \n ", "36  Appendix 2 \n \n18.  While PISA will provide an invaluable assessment of national performance, it uses only a \nsmall sample of students to measure national performance. Current assessment practices must \nbe improved at all levels of schooling. These assessment practices must be both formative and \nsummative. Formative assessment allows teachers to monitor student learning progressively and \nuse the information gained to improve teaching practice. As teachers become more competent \nand professional, they can meet identified learning needs by adopting a range of approaches to \nteaching. This is especially important in meeting the individual and group needs of particular \nstudents and addressing concerns over different learning styles often associated with ethnicity \nand gender. A range of teacher support material will have to be developed so that teachers have \naccess to a variety of materials that will meet the particular needs of various students. Summative \nassessment, which has traditionally measured what has been learned after a study unit or subject \nis completed, is still important but new and more innovative assessment practices should be \nfurther explored to ensure that the assessment covers both knowledge and the student\u2019s ability to \nuse the knowledge and skills acquired. \n \n19.  At  the  national  level  there  is  the  opportunity  to  develop  assessment  materials  that \ndemonstrate to teachers how they can assess a student\u2019s ability to apply knowledge to solve \nproblems. Such sample assessment materials encourage teachers to see that the application of \nknowledge and skills is central to achieving high-quality learning outcomes that are relevant in the \nworkplace and  central  to  economic  and  social  progress.  This  focus  on  analytical skills  and \nproblem solving must be central to the development of teacher standards and the effective use of \ndifferent pedagogies and assessment practices. \n \n20.  Curriculum and textbook upgrading. Processes must be put in place for the systematic \nreview of the curriculum to ensure that it supports the achievement of national goals, including \nimproved competence in English. This is critically important, as the Government has made clear \nits reliance on the ability of the educational system to produce high-quality graduates who can \ndrive future economic growth, as well as to increase social harmony and reduce the gap between \nthe advantaged and the disadvantaged.  \n \n21.  The  relevance  and  quality  of  the  curriculum  and  the  assessment  practices  used  to \nmeasure success must be ensured. A broad range of people, including teachers, principals, \nemployers, and international experts, must be involved in this process. Approaches to effective \nteaching should be constantly reviewed, together with the curriculum and the support materials \nprovided to teachers. A number of nations are creating teacher \u201cidea banks,\u201d where teachers post \neffective approaches to teaching on a dedicated website. Because these idea banks undergo \nquality assurance, what is available is typically of high quality. Such practices make possible the \nstrategic review of the curriculum and the introduction of systematic improvements to meet \nchanging needs and put new technologies to the best use to improve student learning. \n \n22.  As teachers increase their professionalism, they will move from using a single prescribed \ntext to using a variety of materials that better enable them to achieve the learning outcomes \nsought. This will require a move from a single prescribed text to recommending several texts that \ncan be used depending on the preference of the teacher and the learning style of the student. \nThis practice also helps students prepare better for university and further study, where they will \nbe required to source information and learning from various sources, including the internet. \n \n23.  Continuing education. While considerable effort has been targeted to ethnic minorities, \nthere are ongoing concerns that the Government\u2019s policies that place a high priority on supporting \nethnic-minority students have not  achieved the outcomes sought. New policies and support \nprograms must be explored and pilot studies undertaken to identify how current performance and \n ", "Appendix 2  37\naccess gaps can be reduced. The central Government will have to take a leadership role to \nensure that more effective policies and practices are adopted nationally in this key area of \ndisadvantage.  The  pilot-testing  of  new  approaches  will  better  ensure  that  targeted  support \nachieves the goal of improving secondary educational outcomes for the poor. Approaches such \nas conditional cash transfers, which tie support to the successful participation and involvement of \nfamilies, provide the opportunity to refine national policies and programs so that educational \nparticipation and success are better assured. This will help achieve the goal of universal lower \nsecondary education by 2015 (only 48 of 63 provinces had achieved this goal by 2008). \n \n24.  Education  for  children  with  special  needs.  The Government has decreed that all \nstudents,  irrespective  of  background  circumstances,  should  receive  a  good  education.  This \nespecially applies to students with disabilities, as there is a need to ensure that their abilities and \naspirations are recognized and addressed. As students with disabilities live within the broader \ncommunity there are increasing trends to educate these students as part of mainstream schooling. \nStudents such as those with physical disabilities and those with limited sight or hearing are being \nincreasingly integrated into mainstream schools. They are thus provided with access to the full \nrange of programs available to other students, who go through the experience of living and \nlearning with these disabled students. This process provides greater opportunities to disabled \nstudents and develops a greater appreciation of their skills and abilities in the rest of the students. \nSuch  an  inclusive  approach  to  disability  better  ensures  that  all  students  develop  increased \nunderstanding of diversity and improved social harmony. \n \n25.  For such an approach to succeed, specialist teachers must be trained to support disabled \nstudents through direct teaching and other forms of support, possibly involving specialist classes \nfor part of the day as well as support for particular students within mainstream classes.  \n \n26.  Transition  to  postsecondary  education.  As  a  country  committed  to  having  a \nknowledgeable and effective workforce operating within a harmonious society, Viet Nam aspires \nto have its people involve themselves in lifelong learning. This starts with school graduates either \ncontinuing with their education in tertiary institutes or, if moving directly to work, participating in \nwork-based learning programs. For this to be effective, plans must be developed to facilitate the \ntransition from school to further study or work. In this process, students are counseled in school in \nselecting subjects that provide a pathway to further study or work that meets their aspirations, \ninterests, and abilities. Work experience programs may be developed so that school students \nwork for a short time within an industry or profession to gain a better understanding of post-school \noptions. Employers and tertiary institutes must take increased interest in school programs to \nensure continuity and relevance of learning. Final school assessment practices must also reflect \nthe various post-school pathways open to students. Some assessment programs will require \nstudents to demonstrate academic excellence; others will be based on particular competencies. \nWhichever approach is deemed to be more suitable, all will need to ensure that they encourage \nlearning to be seen as dynamic and personally fulfilling.  \n \n ", "38  Appendix 2 \n \nFigure A2: The National Education and Training System of Viet Nam \n \n \nAge   \n \n27 \n \n \n26  Doctorate \n \n(2\u20134 years) \n25    Masters Degree \n(2 years) \n24   \n \n23 \n \n22   \n   \nUniversity \n21  College \n  First Degree \n(3 years) \n20    (4-6 years) \n19   \n \n18  Professional \n   Secondary  Vocational Training \n17 \n  Upper Secondary (3 years)  (3\u20134 years)  Long-term (1\u20133 years)  N\n16    Short-term (< 1 year)  o\nn\n15    -fo\n  rm\n \n14    Lower Secondary (4 years)  al E\n13  d\n  u\nc\n12    atio\n11    n \n \n10 \n \n \n9  Primary (5 years) \n \n8 \n \n7   \n6   \n \n5 \n  Kindergarten \n4 \n \n3   \n2 years   \nNursery \n2   \nmonths   \n \nSource: Ministry of Education and Training. \n \n \n \n \n ", " \nPROBLEM TREE FOR THE SECONDARY EDUCATION SUBSECTOR \nWeak Education Policy and System Resulting in Low Learning \nAchievement and Inequity of Access \nPoor Management  Out of School \nNoncompetitive \nSystems and Tools  Disadvantaged \nEducation Quality  \nGroups  \nNo   Can't afford \ncomprehensive  Language  schooling \nWeak learning \nsubsector policy  barrier \nassessment \nframeworks \nsystem \nLimited \nscholarships \nMale sibling  Ethnic Minorities \nOld national  No teacher  Irrelevant  prioritized   \nstandards for \nstandards  curriculum  Poor households \naccreditation \n  Limited \nRemote areas  dormitories \nLack of  \n \nrole model \naccrbeoNdaoirt adt ion  Nceor ttiefiacachteesr   lanPgouoarg e  ILCimT iutesde   OveraGgier l sc ohort  lotnog s dcihsotaonlsc e \ntraining  Low social \n \nawareness \nDisabled children \nNo quality  Unattractive \nassurance of  HRM for \nschools  teachers  Low quality  No job after  limited special \nnonpublic schools  graduation  schools \n \n   \n  ICT = information and communication technology, HRM = human resource management. \n           Source: Asian Development Bank. \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nix\n 3\n \n3\n9\n \n ", " \nDONOR COORDINATION MATRIX \nTeacher  4\nPre-Primary Primary Secondary  Non-formal Capacity Development 0\nTraining  \n  Multilateral Donors\nA\n2nd Lower Secondary Education  Teacher Training  PPTA for Higher Education  p\np\nDevelopment Project, $55m, Loan,  Project, $25m, Loan,  Sector Development  e\nn\n2004\u20132010: Upper Secondary  1999\u20132007: Upper  Program; $1m, Grant,  d\nEducation Development Project,  Secondary and  2009\u20132010 ix\n 4\n$55m, Loan, 2002\u20132009: Technical  Professional Teacher   \nand Vocational Education Project,  Development Project, \n$50m, Loan, 1999\u20132008: Secondary  $33m, Loan, \nADB\nEducation Sector Master Plan,  2006\u20132011                     \n$600,000, Grant, 2006\u20132010: \nCapacity Development for Upper \nSecondary Education, $420,000, \nGrant, 2003\u20132004, LSE for the Most \nDisadvantaged Regions Project, \n$50m, Loan, 2007\u20132013\nEducation for  Educational Innovation for  Secondary Education Sector Master  Policy Research on  Community  Capacity Building in \nAll, $96,000,  Development Program,  Plan, Advisory Support, 2006\u20132010 Teacher  Learning  Provincial Educational \nGrant,  n.a.

Introduction \n1.  While Viet Nam\u2019s high economic growth in the past decade has significantly reduced \npoverty, about 16% of the population remains poor. Poverty is associated with poor access to \neducation and illiteracy, and lack of basic education excludes the uneducated from economic \nopportunities and limits access to higher incomes.  \n \n2.  Viet Nam has made great progress in improving the quality of education at the primary \nand  secondary  levels,  and  national  statistics  show  little  difference  in  school  achievement \nbetween boys and girls. However, national statistics do not reflect the differences, including the \ngender gap, between ethnic groups and regions, especially between ethnic-minority girls and \nboys in poor districts. While the national net enrollment rate for lower secondary school (LSS) is \n80%, in the Northwest provinces, where 39% of the people remain poor, the net enrollment rate \nis only 60%, and only 73% of the women are literate, compared with 90% of the men.  \n \n3.  The cost of education is a key reason cited for the lower schooling outcomes of the poor \nand ethnic minorities. In recent years, the cost of schooling has increased by 47%, adversely \naffecting the access of the poor and girls to education. Average expenditure on education in \nschool year 2005\u20132006 increased in comparison with 2003\u201320042 and, on average, households \npaid  D1.211  million  per  person.  School  fees,  expenditure  for  extra  classes,  and  other \neducational expenditure accounted for large proportions of education expenditure of household \nmembers. Costs also include school supplies, clothes, and adequate food. For the poorest \nquintile, education expenditure represents 6%\u20137% of total household expenditure. A survey of \nProgram 135 communes gave the following main reasons for dropping out of school or not \nattending school (i) cost of education (62%), (ii) unwillingness to attend school (59%), and \n(iii) the need to work (27%) (footnote 2). \n \n4.  Conditional cash transfers (CCTs) have generated significant attention in addressing \neducation attendance and outcomes by compensating the parents for the cost of sending their \nchildren to school. As the findings from the 2006 Viet Nam Household Living Standard Survey \n(VHLSS) suggest that the opportunity costs of sending children to school are high, financial \nincentives such as CCTs could be effective in addressing education access and outcomes. \nHowever, in addition to demand-side issues of school enrollment and attendance related to \nfinancial barriers, the quality of schools and distance to them must be addressed.  \n \n5.  Pilot  conditional  cash  transfer  program  in  communities.  The  proposed  pilot \ncommunity CCT program for Viet Nam\u2019s lower secondary students is aimed at reducing extreme \npoverty  and  hunger  among  families,  and  improving  the  human  capital  of  children  of  poor \nhouseholds.  The  pilot  program  will  also  address  supply  gaps  in  the  subsector  through \ncommunity participation and school block grants. The Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) \nhas gained significant experience in implementing targeted programs for the poor and is in a \nposition to implement the proposed community CCT program. The proposed program will also \ntake advantage of the high social capital in rural areas that has proven to be a great source of \nassistance, enabling communities to take collective action to tackle common demand-side and \nsupply-side problems to improve access to services.  \n                                                 \n1  A more detailed description is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n2  Ministry of Labor. 2006. Household Survey. Hanoi. \n ", "Appendix 8  53\nB.  Description of the Pilot Program \n6.  The community CCT program will provide grants to households and LSSs conditioned on \nthe completion of education activities (households) and the improvement of education conditions \n(communities and schools). It will involve two kinds of grants: household grants and school block \ngrants. \n \n7.  Households grants. The household grant will provide cash (about $120 per student per \nyear for 4 years) to extreme poor families with children 11\u201314 years of age on the condition that \nthe children enroll in LSSs and attend at least 85% of classes. The cash transfers will be made \nevery quarter and will be paid to mothers or those responsible for the care of children, upon \nverification that the families have met the conditions. A slightly higher allocation will be given if a \nstudent is a girl (about $140 per year for 4 years).  \n \n8.  To  receive  the  initial  grant,  households  must  sign  an  agreement  with  the  project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU)  that  they  are  willing  to  abide  by  the  conditions  of  the  program. \nContinuation of the grant is based on regular attendance in classes (85% of classes), as verified \nby the school boards. The grant will be paid to mothers whose children have completed the \nrequired attendance of over 85% of school classes. If the mother is not present in the household, \nthe payment will be made to the household head. The grant will be given for all LSS students in \nthe household who fulfill the conditions regardless of the LSS year attended, excluding students \ncurrently receiving scholarships. However, if a household has three students in LSS and only \none is on scholarship, the two remaining students will be eligible for the CCT program. \n \n9.  School block grants. The program will also provide block grants to participating LSSs \nto address supply-side concerns such as teacher availability (lodging houses for teachers), \ntextbooks, classrooms, and sanitary facilities. The use of the block grant will be determined by a \nschool\u2013community board composed of representatives of MOET (the local bureau of education \nand training), commune administration, school administration, parents\u2019 association, Viet Nam \nWomen\u2019s Union, and ethnic minority groups. The size of the block grant will depend on the \npopulation size of the commune. The average amount is $5,000 per school for 4 years. A \ncondition for participation in the program is the communities\u2019 commitment to improve education \nconditions.  \n \n10.  The grant will be used to improve the quality of education and ensure that supply-side \nissues are addressed. The use of the funds will be decided by the school board, after a review \nof the results of a supply-side assessment done at the start of the program. Examples of eligible \nactivities or investments include but are not limited to: \n \n(i)  paying the transportation costs of teachers or teaching assistants from ethnic \nminority groups; \n(ii)  providing housing for teachers or teaching assistants from ethnic minority groups; \n(iii)  improving living and housing conditions in boarding or semi-boarding schools; \n(iv)  improving the water and sanitation facilities in schools; \n(v)  improving infrastructure and facilities for schools and teachers, such as physical \ninfrastructure (solid construction for walls, floors, and roofs), adequate lighting, \nand teaching aids (such as blackboard per classroom, tables and chairs, and \ninstructional materials); \n(vi)  contracting private providers or nongovernment organizations to provide services \nin villages; \n(vii)  supporting community mobilization and social pressure toward current nonusers; \n ", "54  Appendix 8 \n(viii)  providing small access infrastructure such as roads and bridges, which lead to \neducation service; \n(ix)  assisting with transportation costs and educational materials for lower secondary \nschooling; and \n(x)  providing teaching aids and instructional materials (textbooks, teaching manuals, \nand other guides). \n \n11.  Although the block grants can be used for anything villagers collectively agree on, the \nfunds  must  be  used  to  improve  the  conditionalities.  Service  use  and  coverage  of  these \nconditionalities will be closely monitored and recorded. All schools must also develop operations \nand maintenance plans for the school grant investments. \n \n12.  The program will be implemented by MOET under the direction of a steering committee \ncomposed of MOET; the Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs; and the Ministry of \nPlanning and Investment. The project management unit for the Secondary Education Sector \nDevelopment Program will support the steering committee. The departments of education and \ntraining at the provincial level will support the program implementation in the field. Community \nschool boards will take the lead in the implementation of the community CCT program. They will \nbe primarily responsible for ensuring that beneficiaries are selected properly, cash transfers are \ndone in a timely and adequate manner, verification of conditions is undertaken, complaints and \ngrievances are resolved, adequate educational services exist or are provided, and that families \nand schools meet the conditions of the program.  \n \n13.  Size of the program. The program will begin in the school year of 2011 for about \n3,000\u20133,500 school-age children and 35\u201340 LSSs in the poorest districts in 10 poor provinces.  \n \n14.  Targeting of beneficiaries. Viet Nam\u2019s current antipoverty programs rely heavily on \ngeographic targeting of poor households. The main instrument used in targeting the poor is a \ncombination of commune-level vetting and the VHLSS.  \n \n15.  Eligible  households  must  meet  the  following  criteria.  They  must  (i) reside  in  the \ncommunes  selected  for  the  CCT  pilot  program;  (ii) be  considered  \u201cpoor\u201d  according  to  the \ndefinition in the latest (2006) VHLSS (per capita income of D250,000); (iii) have children from \n11 to 14 years of age or older who are willing to undergo lower secondary schooling; and \n(iv) agree to meet their obligations under the program. \n \n16.  In determining eligible families, MOET will follow a multistep process. First, it will select \nthe poorest provinces and districts. The selection has already been made by the General \nStatistics Office and is being used in the ongoing Program 135. Second, it will select the poorest \ncommunes within the districts. This will be done in coordination with provincial and commune \npeople\u2019s councils and departments. Finally, it will select households within the communes that \nmeet the above eligibility criteria. The selection of beneficiary households will be based on three \nkey factors: (i) information from the provincial people\u2019s committees and commune people\u2019s \ncommittees (CPCs), (ii) degree of poverty as certified by CPCs (under the 2006 VHLSS), and \n(iii) a rapid survey by the school boards. This list will be prepared by the provincial people\u2019s \ncommittees and CPCs, in coordination with the district Bureau of Education and Training offices, \nand reviewed by the school boards. \n \n17.  From the areas selected for household beneficiaries, data from LSSs will be gathered \nfrom the heads of schools in order to choose beneficiary schools for school grants. The data will \nconsist of information on educational attainment, school enrollment, attendance, promotion, and \n ", "Appendix 8  55\ndropout and completion rates. About two schools will be selected to receive the school grants in \neach district. A ranking will be developed for the schools and those with a large number of \nstudents from poor households or CCT beneficiaries will be identified. Large gaps that emerge \nin the rapid assessment will be prioritized.  \n  \n18.  Payments to beneficiary mothers will generally be made at 3-month intervals. The first \npayment to households, however, will be only for the first month and will be made upon the \nsigning of the agreement with the central project management unit (CPMU) and the school \nboards.  This  payment  will  help  households  enroll  their  children  in  schools.  Subsequent \npayments will be conditional. Payment to schools will be based on plans submitted to the CPMU \nand will be in two tranches of 50% each, conditioned on progress in completing funded activities.  \n \nTable A8: Payment and Condition Schedule \n \nHousehold Grant  School Grant \nPayment  Condition / requirement  Payment  Condition/Requirement \nA.

Program Flow and Implementation \n19.  Project cycle. The community CCT will follow a cycle consisting of five main stages: \n(i) information dissemination, (ii) school board planning and selection, (iii) distribution of grants, \n(iv) verification of compliance with conditions, and (v) performance monitoring and evaluation.  \n \n20.  The  information  dissemination  stage  will  provide  an  orientation  on  the  project \nbackground to provincial, district, and commune administrators, school administrators, parents\u2019 \nassociations, and representatives of the Viet Nam Women\u2019s Union and ethnic minorities in the \nlocalities where the program will be implemented. The rationale, objectives, and process flow of \nthe program will be discussed with the different groups, and their responsibilities in the program \nclarified. This stage will culminate in the creation of a school board composed of the different \ngroups involved in the program. \n ", "56  Appendix 8 \n \n21.  School boards will then take the lead in assessing the qualifications of households and \nLSSs to become beneficiaries of the program. They will also plan activities for the target schools \nto be financed from the school block grants. Schools boards will also approve subsequent \nreleases of funds to households and school administrators. \n \n22.  The grants will be distributed in tranches. For households, an initial 1-month allocation \nwill  be  given  upon  the  signing  of  their  agreement  with  the  program  and  its  conditions. \nSubsequent releases will be based on compliance with the condition of enrollment and school \nattendance. Schools will receive grants based on the plans submitted and approved by the \nDOET. Subsequent releases will depend on the progress of funded activities. \n \n23.  Verification of compliance will occur between the first and subsequent fund releases. This \nwill be initiated by teachers (for school attendance) and the school administrators (for school block \ngrant activities). Compliance will be reviewed by the school boards and appropriate action will be \ndecided by them to assist households and schools in case of difficulties in meeting conditions. \n \n24.  Monitoring and evaluation. In collaboration with the Government Statistics Office, an \nimpact evaluation of the program will be developed to measure program benefits. Community \nCCT areas and households will be compared with similar but nonparticipating communes and \nfamilies. Before the program starts, a baseline survey measuring consumption, education, and \nother  socioeconomic  variables  will  be  conducted  for  a  random  sample  of  beneficiary  and \nnon-beneficiary families and LSSs. This will determine the baseline indicators against which \nprogress  will  be  measured.  The  program  will  also  have  a  monitoring  component  to  track \nprogress in implementation, and compliance with conditions.  \n \n25.  Grievance and complaints resolution. Households and communities can direct their \nquestions or complaints to the PMU or directly to the school board, to representatives of parents \nand  ethnic  minority  groups,  or  school  administrators.  The  school  board  will  function  as  a \ncomplaints  handling  unit.  Noncompliance  with  the  conditions  of  the  program  and  the  of \nresources for activities other than those approved will be penalized.  \n \n26.  Penalties will take the form of warning, temporary suspension, or permanent suspension \nfrom the benefits of the program. A warning will be issued to mothers or other household heads \nand schools that do not meet commitments after one payment cycle. Temporary suspension will \nbe imposed on mothers or other household heads and schools that fail to meet the conditions \nfor two consecutive payment cycles. Mothers and schools may however request readmission to \nthe program. In all cases, the school board will investigate the cause of noncompliance and \ndevelop an action plan with the mother and school administrator to assist the household or \nschool in complying with conditions. Permanent suspension will be imposed on households and \nschools that fail to meet conditions after 1 year. No readmission will be allowed in this case.  \nD.  Cost and Financing \n27.  Total Cost: $3 million. The total cost of the community CCT program is $3 million. \nHousehold grants account for 55.5% of total; school block grants, 26.7%; meetings and training, \n8.7%; monitoring and evaluation, 5%; and consultants, 4.1%.  \n ", "Appendix 9  57\nREFORM ACTIONS AND ASSOCIATED ADJUSTMENT COSTS \n \nReform Actions for First-Tranche Release  Adjustment Costs ($5 million) \nOutput 1: Effective and Accountable Management of Secondary Education \nMOET has issued Decision 7674/QD-BGDDT on development of the  Consultation with stakeholders \nnew Secondary Education Sector Master Plan (SESMP) 2011\u20132015 and  Legal procedure for development of the \nprepared the draft concept paper  new master plan \nMOET  issued  Decision  83/2008/QD-BGDDT  on  the  accreditation  Consultation with stakeholders \nprocedure, criteria, and standards for all public, semipublic, and private   \nschools.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Government of Viet Nam recognizes secondary education as one of the principal mechanisms for \nachieving  economic  growth,  poverty  reduction  and  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs).  The \nSecondary Education Sector Development Program (SESDP) supports Viet Nam\u2019s 5-year Socio-Economic \nDevelopment Plan (SEDP) 2006\u20132010, which targets universal secondary education as a key priority. Special \nemphasis is placed on reaching ethnic minorities in remote areas for equitable and inclusive development. Key \ntargets include (i) universal upper secondary education in all provinces, (ii) a reduction in poverty to 10%\u201311% \nof households, (iii) an increase to 90% in the net enrollment rate among children of lower secondary school \nage, and (iv) an increase to more than 50% in the net enrollment rate among children of upper secondary \nschool  age.  The  Secondary  Education  Sector  Master  Plan  2006\u20132010  identifies  three  core  issues:  (i) \npersistent inequality of access to schooling, (ii) weak system and strategies for improving the quality of \nteaching and learning, and (iii) lack of an accountability framework for effective delivery.  \n \nThe country partnership strategy (CPS) for Viet Nam 2007\u20132010a of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is \ndirectly linked to supporting the SEDP\u2019s targeted outcomes, including expanded access to good-quality \nservices, especially for ethnic minorities. The Program responds to both Government and ADB priorities by \nsupporting fundamental legal and policy reforms related to improving secondary education in Viet Nam.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis         Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention\u2013non-income Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (TI-M) \n1.   Key Issues  \n \nViet Nam continues to make impressive progress in poverty reduction and socioeconomic development and \nthe national poverty rate has fallen from 58.1% in 1993 to less than 20% in 2007. Viet Nam has already \nachieved the poverty target under the MDGs and is on track to achieve most of the MDG targets by 2015. \nMost  human  development  indicators  have  risen  steadily  and  are  now  comparable  with  those  of \nmiddle-income countries.  \n \nDespite the steady progress reflected in national statistics, wide variations and inequities persist. In 2006, \n20.4% of rural households were poor, compared with 3.9% of urban households, and 52.3% of ethnic \nminorities were poor compared with 10.3% of ethnic Kinh and Chinese households. In 2006, close to 9% of \nrural households and 29% of ethnic minority households also suffered hunger during some periods of the \nyear. While the urban poverty rate is relatively low, it also appears to have stagnated or even increased, \nsuggesting that economic growth alone will not reduce poverty in urban centers, and that inflation and other \nfactors may be pushing more people below the poverty line. Households whose consumption is just over the \npoverty line are vulnerable to external shocks and remain at risk of falling back below the poverty line, \nparticularly in the current global financial environment.  \n \nPoverty, particularly among minority groups, is closely associated with low or limited access to education. \nThe main barriers to access are lack of infrastructure, physical inaccessibility, language and cultural barriers, \nlack of good-quality teachers, curricula that are not suited to local needs or languages, and high costs. The \nopportunity costs for many ethnic minority and poor families of sending their children to secondary school \nversus  working  for  the  family  are  high.  Fee  exemption  policies  are  often  insufficient  to  cover  all \neducation-related costs associated with attending secondary education and many families cannot afford to \nsend their children to school because of these financial constraints. The financial obligations are only \nexacerbated  in  rural  and  remote  regions  of  the  country,  and  this  places  a  large  burden  on  already \ncash-strapped families. Financial constraints were among the top two reasons students from 42 provinces in \n2004 were unable to attend school. \n \n ", "74  Appendix 17 \n2. Design Features \n \nThe Program supports the Government\u2019s poverty reduction and social development goals by supporting a \nmore  equitable  distribution  of  high-quality  secondary  education.  It  will  provide  direct  benefits  to \nethnic-minority and poor students by increasing access to and affordability of lower secondary education \n(LSE). The pilot conditional cash transfer (CCT) will address demand-side constraints and alleviate the direct \nand indirect costs of education. It will improve the human capital of children of poor households and reduce \nintergenerational poverty in the future. The pilot program will also address supply gaps in the sector through \ncommunity participation and school block grants, and community awareness-raising activities will focus on \ndemonstrating the benefits of school participation. The pilot program is expected to have significant impact \nin reducing poverty for poor households, increasing school attendance, increasing transition rates from lower \nsecondary school (LSS) to upper secondary school (USS), increasing the years of education completed by \npoor children, and reducing child labor.  \n         \nC. Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n \nThe policy reforms included in the Program are expected to positive impact, especially for the poor and \nthose living in remote areas.  \n \n(i)  The new national standards for secondary schools will ensure that all schools have appropriate \nlevels of school buildings and facilities and provision of adequate numbers of quality instructional \nmaterials. This is especially important in rural areas, where costs of education are often higher \nbut incomes lower. The updated school standards will ensure that no matter where a school is \nbuilt, it will meet national standards for effective teaching and learning.  \n \n(ii)  The human resource management framework will ensure that teacher placements are matched \nto need and that teachers, particularly those who live and work in difficult conditions, are \nrewarded for efforts and effectiveness.  \n \n(iii)  The Decision on Regulations and Roles for Continuing Education Centers redefines the function \nof and quality standards for continuing education and will promote greater equity of opportunities \nfor disadvantaged youth. Continuing education has been a key alternative learning opportunity \nfor disadvantaged youth who cannot access or remain in the regular LSSs because of poverty, \nlong distance to school, or the need to engage in seasonal labor. However, poor quality of the \nprograms and limited facilities, which cannot absorb increasing demand, have been a key \nobstacle to the universalization of LSE. \n \n(iv)  The Decision on an \u201cinclusive approach\u201d to special education will ensure that more disabled \nstudents are able to gain access to mainstream schools. \n \n(v)  CCTs will promote poverty reduction and enhanced access to education for poor families.  \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nPoverty rates and education indicators lag substantially behind in the Northwest and Central Highlands \nregions,  in  rural  areas,  and  among  the  most  marginalized  ethnic  groups.  Viet  Nam  has  54  officially \nrecognized ethnic groups, with the ethnic Kinh composing over 86%. Except for the ethnic Chinese, Khmer, \nand Cham, ethnic minorities reside mainly in remote, mountainous, and other disadvantaged areas. While \nthey represent less than 15% of the population, these minorities accounted for 44% of the poor and 59% of \nthe hungry in 2006. Viet Nam\u2019s ethnic minorities are extremely heterogeneous, and their relative positions \nappear to be shifting significantly. While the ethnic Chinese, Khmer, and Cham have improved theire \nposition relative to the Kinh majority, the relative positions of several Northern and Central Highlands \nminority groups have actually worsened. Poor access to health care and education, lack of good-quality \nfarmland in upland areas, limited access to markets, and lack of fluency in the Vietnamese language are \ncontributing factors. These findings underscore the importance of tailoring the activities under the Program \nto the different needs and constraints of the most marginalized ethnic minority groups. \n \n ", "Appendix 17  75 \nThere  is  a  significant  gap  in  access  to  secondary  education  between  students  living  in  remote  and \nmountainous regions and those residing in delta regions. Grade repetition and dropout rates are much \nhigher in mountainous and rural regions than in predominantly delta and urban areas. There is also a \nrecognizable  quality  education  gap  between  these  regions,  including  disparities  in  teacher  training, \ninfrastructure standards, and curricular offerings (e.g., information technology, textbook availability, and \naccess to electricity). There is also a gap between rural and urban areas. Economic opportunities and \nperceived improvements in the quality of life in urban and costal-port regions draw large numbers of migrant \nfamilies from remote mountainous and rural regions of the country. While the overall national secondary \neducation student cohort is decreasing over time, student enrollments in urban centers are increasing. This \nurban increase is projected through the next two decades, with the addition of up to 1 million people \nmigrating to major urban areas by the year 2020. This population shift to follow greater job opportunities \nincludes a major education component. While not all migrant workers bring their families with them to the \ncities, many do. The dropout rate among unregistered migrant secondary education students is four times \nhigher than among regular residents in urban centers. \n \nThere is also disparity between female and male enrollments at all levels, and especially at the lower \nsecondary level. While education gender disparity has declined in recent years, it persists among all ethnic \ngroups and geographic regions. There are generally no differences in the percentage of students attending \nsecondary  schools  between  Kinh  and  ethnic  minority  males  (roughly  73%  for  both),  but  there  is  a \n10 percentage  point  difference  in  female  enrollments  by  ethnicity  (71%  for  Kinh  and  61%  for  ethnic \nminorities). This gender gap varies between ethnic groups and geographic region, but several study findings \nand  multiple  consultations  identify  ethnic  minority  females  as  the  most  disadvantaged  group  at  the \nsecondary education level. Semi-boarding at school is particularly difficult for girls because of security and \nprivacy concerns. Sociocultural factors also play a role in keeping girls out of school: minority girls tend to \nmarry early, especially in the Hmong culture. Many children drop out of school in the absence of parental \nencouragement and discipline, and when parents do not see the relevance of education they do not object. \nOpportunity costs become higher as children enter their teens and are needed for agricultural work, or family \ncare in the case of girls.  \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \n1. Consultation and participation process during the project preparation: \nStakeholders have been actively engaged in the design of the Program through individual consultations, \nworkshops, and field visits to secondary schools, to provincial and district education departments, and with \nstudents, parents and teachers, village residents, and other key informants. Consultation workshops with \nnational and provincial stakeholders were organized to review policy and design issues.  \n \n2.

Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues \n \nDespite considerable progress in key education outcomes as reflected in national statistics, there are wide \nvariations and persistent inequities in health indicators between regions and province, between the urban \nand  rurals,  and  and  between  ethnic  groups.  Women  and  adolescent  girls  in  poor,  remote,  and \nethnic-minority  communities,  and  migrant  women,  are  particularly  affected  by  the  limited  access  to \neducational opportunities. Gender in the education workforce varies by level and subject. While there has \nbeen progress in increasing the number of female teachers and administrators in all education subsectors, \n ", "76  Appendix 17 \nthere remains a significant gender gap nationwide in some key positions, including principals of LSS, USS, \nand professional secondary schools. There is a negative correlation between school level and female \nadministrators: the higher the school level, the fewer the number of females in administrative positions.  \n    \n2.  Key  Actions.

A gender and ethnic minority action plan (GEMAP) has been prepared to ensure that the \nProgram  fully  supports  gender  equality,  ethnic  inclusion  and  equity.  The  GEMAP  aims  to \nintegrate equity concerns in all outputs of the Program. The Government will ensure that all \nactivities under the Program are consistent with the Gender Equality Law. The GEMAP is based \non a poverty and social analysis of the education sector. It is in accordance with current \nViet Nam laws, policies, and regulations and with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Policy on \nGender and Development (1998) and Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998).  \nA.  Institutional and Legal Framework  \n2.  A  strong  policy  and  institutional  environment  supporting  gender  equality  has  been \ninstrumental  in  empowering  Vietnamese  women  and  reducing  gender  gaps.  The  National \nCommittee  for  the  Advancement  of  Women  is  the  formal  state  machinery  responsible  for \npromoting gender equality. It is a high-level multi-sectoral committee that reports directly to the \nPrime Minister. The Vietnam Women\u2019s Union is a mass-based organization for women that \nfacilitates  the  implementation  of  projects  and  programs  at  the  local  level,  in  addition  to \nrepresenting their members in national policy dialogue. The newly issued Gender Equality Law \n(2007) provides leverage for addressing priority gender issues by redressing gender disparities \nin existing laws, calling for gender mainstreaming in public administration, and providing for \ntargets and quotas for women\u2019s participation in decision making. \n \n3.
