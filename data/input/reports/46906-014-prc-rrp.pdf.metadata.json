In  urban  areas,  untreated  waste  can  find  its  way  into \ndrinking water and put its safety at risk, which will expose the population at large, but especially \nthe  urban  poor,  to  infectious  diseases  and  other  health  problems.  Inadequately  treated  waste \nwill threaten food production and security in rural areas, as nutrients contained in straw cannot \nbe recycled into the fields without proper treatment. Even if burned, direct incineration of straw \nin the fields has a thermal impact on the soil, leading to deterioration of organic matter and loss \nof moisture. Uncontrolled direct incineration of agricultural waste can also generate fumes and \nfly ash, which have become a major source of environmental pollution and respiratory diseases. \n \nThe PRC is the world\u2019s biggest generator of agricultural waste,1 with an average growth \n3. \nof 5%\u201310% annually. According to the Government of the PRC, the total yield of crop straw in \n2010  reached  over  700  million  tons.  However,  about  45%  of  the  straw  was  directly  burned  or \nabandoned  in  2010  due  to  lack  of  technology,  funding,  and  awareness  of  local  farmers.  The \nPRC is also the world\u2019s second largest generator of municipal solid waste (MSW)2\n due to rapid \neconomic growth and urbanization.  MSW was estimated to reach 221 million tons annually by \nthe  end  of  2010.  In  2010,  36.5%  of  total  MSW  collected  was  untreated.  Therefore,  improving \nwaste management in the PRC is an important and urgent task. \n \nThe  common goal  of agricultural  waste  and  MSW management  is to  treat the  waste  in \n4. \nan environmentally and socially acceptable manner with appropriate clean technologies. ADB\u2019s \npublic  sector  operations  have  been  supporting  broad-based  policy  and  regulatory  reforms  for \nefficient  agricultural  waste  management  since  19943 and  MSW  management  since  2000.4\n All \nwaste  disposal  alternatives  eventually  decompose  organic  materials  into  simpler  carbon \n\n                                                \n1  Agricultural waste includes crop residues and byproducts of agricultural produce. \n2  Municipal  solid  waste  consists  mainly  of  household  waste,  but  includes  commercial  waste,  generated  in  urban \n\n3  ADB. 1994.

Manila. \n\n\f2             \n\nmolecules  such  as  carbon  dioxide  and/or  methane,  but  incineration  is  recognized  as  a \nparticularly  effective  method  for  waste  treatment.  It  reduces  waste  volume  by  90%  and \neliminates methane emissions, and waste-to-energy (WTE) technologies recover the waste heat \nfrom the incineration process and steadily produce electricity and heat. By replacing fossil fuel \ncombustion and avoiding methane, WTE helps avoid greenhouse gas emissions and mitigates \nclimate  change.  Therefore,  using  abundant  agricultural  waste  and  MSW  as  fuel  makes  WTE \nplants attractive and dependable sources of renewable energy. \n \nThe  incineration  option  for  agricultural  waste  has  further  merits  as  it  yields  additional \n5. \nincome to farmers who sell agricultural waste and also to small and medium-sized enterprises in \ncharge  of  waste  collection  and  transportation.  In  addition,  the  treated  bottom  ash  could  be \nharnessed as an organic agricultural fertilizer for the domestic community. \n \n6. \nWTE for agricultural waste and MSW treatment is a very important and attractive option \nfor the PRC since the government sets the development of a recycling economy as a national \ngoal  and  promotes  renewable  energy.  ADB  has  undertaken  a  study5\n which  showed  that  the \nPRC  could  readily  utilize  crop  straw  for  electricity  generation,  through  direct  combustion  in \nparticular.  To  mitigate  environmental  degradation  and  produce  cleaner  electricity, \nthe \ngovernment  aims  to  install  agricultural  WTE  capacity  of  up  to  24 gigawatts  (GW),  almost  four \ntimes  the  current  capacity,  which  represents  less  than  1.0%  of  the  total  energy  mix  and \nconsumes  2.5%  of  the  total  available  agricultural  waste.  The  government  has further  issued a \nseries  of  policies  and  regulations  to  support  agricultural  WTE:  (i)  full  offtake  of  electricity \ngenerated by biomass plants, including WTE plants; (ii) national targets by 2020 including 15% \nof  the  total  energy  to  be  generated  from  renewable  energy  sources  and  biomass  capacity  to \nreach 30 GW; (iii) value-added tax refund; (iv) exclusivity of agricultural WTE plants by allowing \nonly  one  plant  in  each  county  or  within  a  100-kilometer  radius;  (v)  utilization  of  75%  of  total \navailable straw by 2013 and 80% by 2015; and (vi) feed-in tariffs of CNY0.75 per kilowatt-hour \n(kWh) for agricultural WTE and CNY0.65/kWh for municipal WTE. \n \n7. \nAgainst  this  backdrop,  China  Everbright  International  Limited  (CEIL)  decided  to  extend \nits  operation  to  the  agricultural WTE  business.  CEIL  has  implemented  the  Municipal Waste  to \nEnergy Project with ADB assistance since 2009, which supports the construction and operation \nthrough  public\u2013private  partnerships  of  its  municipal  WTE  projects  with  advanced  clean \ntechnologies,  including  grate  incinerator  technology  and  advanced  flue  gas  emission  control.6\n \nThe ADB facility has been utilized for the development of CEIL\u2019s clean municipal WTE plants in \nJiangyin,  Jinan,  Suzhou,  and  Zhenjiang.  Considering  the  successful  implementation  of  the \nmunicipal WTE project, CEIL requested ADB to consider extending assistance to its agricultural \nwaste  management  business,  as  it  plans  to  scale  up  the  business  given  the  vast  market \nopportunities  and  potential  development  impacts.  CEIL  has  also  requested  to  support  further \nexpansion  of  its municipal WTE  project  into  new  municipalities  to  establish  a  solid  operational \nbase from which penetration into the agricultural WTE market in the surrounding areas can be \nsought.  While  the  projects  are  of  homogeneous  nature  (i.e.,  same  technology,  same  raw \nmaterial collection method, and same offtaker), local banks cannot finance these as a portfolio \nsince  a  branch  cannot  operate  beyond  its  territory.  This  lending  limitation  results  in  fairly  high \ntransaction costs. \n\n                                                \n5  ADB. 2010. Rural Biomass Energy 2020. Manila. \n6  ADB. 2009. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Technical \nAssistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Municipal Waste to Energy Project. Manila. On 4 June 2009, \nthe ADB Board approved (i) an A loan of up to $100 million, (ii) a B loan of up to $100 million, and (iii) technical \nassistance of up to $653,000 to China Everbright Environmental Energy Limited, a fully owned subsidiary of CEIL. \nThe B loan was subscribed among six banks through successful syndication. \n\n\f3 \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n8. \nLeveraging  the  successful  operation  of  the  municipal  WTE  projects,  CEIL  applies  its \nclean technologies to utilize agricultural waste to produce clean energy. The primary objective of \nthe project is to support CEIL in extending its operations to agricultural WTE projects. In parallel, \nbut to a lesser extent, municipal WTE projects will also be supported. Under the project, CEIL \naims  to  develop  and  invest  in  agricultural  and  municipal  WTE  projects  to  treat  approximately \n7,300  tons  of  waste  daily  with  installed  capacity  of  210  megawatts  (MW)  to  generate \napproximately 1,240 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity annually by 2016.  \n \n9. \nEach plant incinerates waste, recovers waste heat for power generation, purifies waste \ngas,  and  disposes  ash.  CEIL\u2019s  wholly  owned  subsidiaries,  CEBEIL  and  CEEEL,  will  hold  its \nagricultural and municipal WTE operations. To ensure that the focus of the project is agricultural \nWTE, 60% of the total assistance from ADB will be channeled to agricultural WTE, while support \nto municipal WTE will be limited at 40%. \n \nThe ADB assistance is to provide a credit line to fund through the borrowers a series of \n10. \nWTE  projects  in  CEIL\u2019s  investment  plan.  The  plan  includes  civil  works,  equipment  and \nmaterials,  other  procurement,  and  working  capital  for  9\u201312  WTE  projects  from  2012  to  2015. \nThe ADB loan will play  a catalytic role to enable borrowing from the local banks at the project \ncompanies owned by the borrowers. \n \n\n3. \n\nThe Borrowers and Sponsor \n\nThe  project  is  sponsored  and  guaranteed  by  CEIL,  a  private  sector  company  listed  on \n11. \nthe  Hong  Kong  Stock  Exchange  (stock  code  257).  Since  its  establishment  in  1993,  CEIL  has \nbecome  a  leading  company  in  environment  protection  business  in  the  PRC.  The  principal \nactivities  of  CEIL  are  waste  management  projects  such  as  WTE  plants,  environmental  water \nprojects such as wastewater treatment plants, alternative energy projects such as methane-to-\nenergy  power  plants  and  photovoltaic  energy  power  plants,  environmental  technology,  and \nconstruction management. In 2006, CEIL began commercial operation of its first municipal WTE \nproject to implement advanced clean technologies. In 2010, CEIL entered the agricultural waste \nmanagement business to leverage its clean municipal WTE technologies to agricultural waste. \n \n12. \nCEIL\u2019s largest shareholder is the China Everbright Holdings Company Limited (CEHCL), \na  company  established  in  Hong  Kong  that  holds  approximately  50.2%  of  CEIL\u2019s  issued  share \ncapital.  CEHCL  is,  in  turn,  owned  by  the  China  Everbright  Group.  CEIL  posted  revenues  of \nHK$3.67 billion ($472 million); earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization of \nHK$1.44 billion; and net profit of HK$845 million in 2011.  \n \nThe borrowers are both wholly owned and controlled by CEIL. CEBEIL, incorporated in \n13. \nHong Kong, was set up to own agricultural WTE projects. CEEEL is incorporated in the British \nVirgin Islands, and is an investment platform to own all the municipal WTE projects.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n\n\f4             \n\nADB\u2019s  review  of  these  entities  does  not  give  ADB  cause  to  believe  that  such  entities \n14. \nhave  been  established,  or  are  being  used  for  cross-border  tax  evasion,  money  laundering,  or \nterrorism financing in the jurisdictions involved in the project.7\n \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nImpact \n\nImprovements  in  waste  management. The project will contribute to the improvement \n15. \nof both agricultural and municipal waste management in the PRC. Uncontrolled incineration of \nagricultural  waste  and  untreated  MSW  emit  harmful  gases  and  contaminate  soil  and \ngroundwater.  The \nimpact  of  demonstrating  and  deploying  clean  waste  management \ntechnologies  will  result  in  avoidance  or  mitigation  of  environmental  issues  in  both  rural  and \nurban areas. \n \n16. \nIncrease  in  energy  generation  from  agricultural  and  municipal  waste. The  project \nfeatures  a  strong  model  for  private  sector  participation  in  agricultural  WTE  through  a  public\u2013\nprivate  partnership  for  multiple  projects.  The  impact  of  catalyzing  private  sector  investment  in \nthe PRC\u2019s emerging biomass industry goes beyond the project\u2019s specific interventions. Energy \ngeneration from agricultural and municipal WTE plants will result in reduction of greenhouse gas \nemissions by replacing electricity otherwise generated by coal-fired plants.  \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\nThe project\u2019s outcome is increased production of energy from viable and environmentally \n17. \nsustainable WTE power plants in the PRC. The WTE plants to be supported under the project \nwill ultimately generate 1,240 GWh of clean energy annually and reduction of greenhouse gas \nemission by approximately 638,000 tons per annum. \n \n\n3. \n\nOutputs \n\n18.  \n The  project\u2019s  output  will  be  the  construction  of  at  least  nine  WTE  plants  with  an \naggregate capacity of 210 MW.8 All the plants will be built in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (2009),  and  will  also  meet  the  new  national  emissions  standard  of  the  PRC, \nwhich took effect from January 2012.9\n \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\nThe  project  is  consistent  with  ADB's  Strategy  2020,10\n\n which  defines  infrastructure  and \n19. \nenvironment as two of the five core operational areas. On infrastructure, the project will embody \nthe  strategy,  which  sets  forth  that  ADB  will  (i)  help  expand  the  supply  of  energy;  (ii)  promote \n                                                \n7  British  Virgin  Islands  (BVI)  is  on  the  \u2018White  List\u2019  of  Organization  for  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD) \njurisdictions  that  have  substantially  implemented  the  internationally  agreed  tax  standard.  According  to  the  2011 \nProgress Report issued by OECD Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange on Information for Tax Purposes, \nBVI passed Phase 1 peer review and is going forward to Phase 2 peer review. \n\n8  Based on five agricultural WTE plants of 30 MW capacity each and four municipal WTE plants of 15 MW capacity \n\n9  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n10 ADB.  2008.

With respect to the environment, the project is in \nline with the strategy's focus on climate change and complementary actions. \n \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy (CPS) 11 for the PRC is based on three development \n20. \npillars: (i) inclusive growth, (ii) environmentally sustainable growth, and (iii) regional cooperation \nand  integration.  The  drivers  of  change  are  (i)  knowledge  solution,  (ii)  private  sector \ndevelopment, (iii) good governance and capacity development, and (iv) gender equity. The CPS \nalso sets out four priority sectors: (i) natural resources and agriculture, (ii) energy, (iii) transport, \nand (iv) urban development. The project will increase the production of energy from renewable \nbiomass  sources  and  thus  contribute  to  the  CPS  objective  of  supporting  environmentally \nsustainable  growth  in  the  PRC.  The  project  also  complements  ADB\u2019s  public  sector  assistance \nfor efficient waste management, in particular the recent projects with biomass focus.12\n  \n \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Sector Strategy \n\nThe  project  is  consistent  with  ADB's  Energy  Policy. 13\n\n Under  the  policy,  ADB\u2019s \n21. \ninvestments  will  focus  on  energy  efficiency  and  renewable  energy  projects,  as  well  as \nexpansion of energy access. The policy states that support for renewable energy projects will be \nprioritized  and  broadened  with  an  objective  to  create  a  framework  that  makes  investing  in \nrenewable  energy commercially  viable.  The  policy  envisages that,  in the process  of facilitating \ndirect private sector investments in renewable energy, ADB will assume greater\u2014but thoroughly \nassessed\u2014risks  and  act  as  a  catalyst  for  investments  that  the  private  sector  might  not \notherwise be willing to make. \n \nD. \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\nCEIL\u2019s investment plan indicates a total investment of $656 million to treat approximately \n22. \n7,300  tons  of  waste  daily  with  installed  capacity  of  210  MW  to  generate  about  1,240 GWh  of \nelectricity annually by 2018. The plan includes civil works, equipment and materials, other local \nprocurement, and working capital for WTE projects between 2012 and 2015. \n \n23. \nADB will provide a credit line that consists of A loans of up to $100 million and B loans of \nup  to  $100  million.

The project company will also enter into an \ninvestment agreement with the respective municipal government. \nFor municipal WTE projects, each project company will be awarded a concession, \nand the concession agreement and other relevant agreements set out the MSW \ntreatment fee and the minimum amount of waste to be supplied by the municipal \ngovernment. \nBoth agricultural WTE and municipal WTE projects will be supervised and \nmanaged by CEIL. \nOctober 2012\u2013October 2015 \n\nGoods and services will be required to be procured in a transparent manner, \nthrough local competitive bidding procedures in accordance with CEIL\u2019s \nprocurement guidelines. Each project company will enter into engineering, \nprocurement, and construction contracts with subcontractors. CEIL usually adopts \na progress payment arrangement with the subcontractors, which have supported \nits strong track record by implementing existing projects in accordance with the \nschedule and sometimes even ahead of it. \n\nAll project companies will sell electricity to the State Grid. A power purchase \nagreement will be executed between a project company and a local grid, owned by \nthe State Grid, for the total annual generation. For agricultural WTE projects, a \nfeed-in tariff of CNY0.75/kWh will be applied. Municipal WTE projects will enjoy a \nfeed-in tariff of CNY0.65/kWh. \nFor agricultural WTE projects, each project company will enter into fuel supply \nagreements with local partners and agricultural cooperatives. The fuel supply \nagreements will set out the specification of waste including size, water content, \nimpurity, and minimum quantity, and the price. There are no fuel costs for \nmunicipal WTE projects, as a municipal government will guarantee fuel supply and \npay a waste management fee to a project company. \n\nOperation and maintenance  Operation and maintenance will generally be handled by each project company\u2019s \n\nPerformance monitoring \n\nstaff, who will be transferred from CEIL and/or recruited from outside.  \nKey performance indicators, including output and outcome indicators, and \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements, will be reported by the borrowers \nand CEIL. \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  CEIL  =  China  Everbright  International  Limited,  kWh  =  kilowatt-hour,  MSW  = \nmunicipal solid waste, WTE = waste to energy. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nF. \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\nThe project is financially viable because  the financial internal rates of return  are higher \n25.  \nthan  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital.  The  project  is  economically  sustainable  as  the \neconomic internal rates of return are higher than the social discount rate of 10%.15\n \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n                                                \n15 The  Evaluation  Cooperation  Group's  Good  Practice  Standards  for  Private  Sector  Investment  Operations  rates  a \n\nproject satisfactory if the economic internal rate of return is 10% or higher. \n\n\f7 \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\nADB will provide A loans of up to $60 million to CEBEIL and $40 million to CEEEL. The \n26. \nA loans will be funded by ADB and supported by a full, irrevocable guarantee from CEIL. The \nproposed  loans  will  have  a  maturity  of  up  to  10  years,  including  a  3-year  grace  period  on \nprincipal repayments. Repayments will be in equal installments of principal.  \n \n27. \nThe B loans of up to $60 million to CEBEIL and $40 million to CEEEL will be funded by \ninternational commercial banks, have a maturity equal to or shorter than that of the A loans, and \nbe on terms and conditions agreed by the borrowers, CEIL, participating banks, and ADB. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n28. \n\nThe proposed transaction merits ADB\u2019s assistance for the following reasons: \n(i) \n\nADB US dollar loans are essential for the borrowers to invest in US dollar, as is \noften  required  by  municipal  governments,  and  will  also  serve  as  a  leverage  to \nmobilize  local  currency  financing  from  local  banks  that  are  unfamiliar  with  the \nsector and the technologies that the project will employ. \nThe project structure will enable ADB to extend its reach to multiple agricultural \nand  municipal  WTE  projects  that  would  be  difficult  to  assist  directly,  while \nleveraging  the  experience  and  know-how  of  an  experienced  developer  and  its \nadvanced technologies in municipal WTE and other sectors. \n\n(ii) \n\n \nC. \n\nRisks  \n\n29. \nFuel  (waste)  supply  risk. Availability of an adequate quantity and quality of waste will \naffect the performance of the WTE plants. Deterioration in waste quality can lead to less energy \nproduction.  An  increase in  the  agricultural  waste price  will  also  have  a  negative  impact  on the \ncash flow. With regard to the agricultural WTE plants, the risk will be mitigated by (i) diversifying \nfuel  suppliers,  and  (ii) by  monitoring  the  waste  quality  delivered  to  the  plant.  As  for  municipal \nWTE  plants,  this  risk  will  be  mitigated  by  guaranteed  daily  minimum  waste  supply  from  the \nrelevant municipality in the concession agreement. \n \n30. \nProject sponsor credit risk. Debt service will be fully guaranteed by CEIL. This raises \nthe issue of CEIL\u2019s capacity to undertake such commitments. The credit analysis shows that the \nCEIL's financial performance is stable due to its contract-based, utility-like business that is not \nsensitive  to  economic  cycles,  and  has  geographic  diversity.  CEIL  has  achieved  stable  growth \nwhile  improving  its  balance  sheet.  The  credit  strengths  of  CEIL  include  (i)  strong  regulatory \nenvironment,  (ii)  stable  and  recurrent  revenues  under  long-term  contracts  with  creditworthy \ncounterparts, (iii) sound term structure and sufficient liquidity, and (iv) top-tier market position. \n \n31. \nCompletion risk. The project involves high initial capital expenditure for the construction \nof each WTE plant, making cost overrun and delay another potential risk. This risk is mitigated \nby  CEIL\u2019s  strong  technical  expertise  and  efficient  cost-control  measures,  including  a  progress \npayment arrangement with the subcontractors. \n \n\n\f8             \n\nElectricity  tariff  risk.  Insufficient tariffs  could  adversely  affect  project  profitability.  This \n32. \nrisk will be mitigated by strong government support which requires the grid utility to purchase all \nelectricity generated by the qualified agricultural and municipal WTE plants, and pay them feed-\nin  tariffs  of  CNY0.75/kWh  for  agricultural  WTE  plants  and  CNY0.65/kWh  for  municipal  WTE \nplants. While there  is  no  defined  tenor for these feed-in  tariffs,  a  CNY0.25/kWh  premium  over \nthe benchmark tariff will still be applicable for 15 years from commercial operation in the worst \ncase,  i.e.,  if  the  feed-in  tariffs  are  abolished.  As  for  the  offtaker,  the  State  Grid  is  a  large, \nestablished state-owned entity and the risk of payment default is considered low. \n \n33. \nOperation and maintenance risk. Operation and maintenance will be handled by each \nWTE project company\u2019s staff, who will be transferred from CEIL or recruited from outside. This \nrisk  will  be  mitigated  by  CEIL\u2019s  strong  in-house  technical  and  management  expertise  and  its \nreliable track record in existing WTE plants. \n \n34. \nForeign  exchange  fluctuation  risk.  This  risk  arises  from  currency  mismatches \nbetween the borrower's foreign debt service obligation and local currency receipts of the project \ncompanies. The risk will be partly mitigated by yuan-denominated loans from local banks. \n \n35. \nStructural  subordination  risk.  As  the  ADB  loans  will  be  extended  to  the  borrowers, \nCEIL\u2019s  offshore  holding  companies,  and  not  directly  to  the  project  companies,  they  will  be \nstructurally  subordinated  to  loans  provided  directly  to  the  project  companies.  This  risk  will  be \nmitigated  by  various  measures  which  are  based  on  the  measures  employed  under  ADB\u2019s \nexisting facility to CEEEL as well as other ADB projects with similar project structure. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n36. \nThe  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environment,  category  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement, and category C for indigenous peoples. The sites for CEIL\u2019s municipal WTE plants \nare  selected  by  the  respective  municipal  governments,  and  to  minimize  impacts  on  the \nenvironment and communities. CEIL's agricultural WTE projects will be generally small in scale \n(30 MW or less) and will be in nonsensitive areas with abundant biomass supply. The municipal \nWTE projects have been voluntarily in compliance with the European Union 2000 standard for \ndioxin, which is 10 times more stringent than the PRC national standard, and this practice will \ncontinue  for  CEIL\u2019s  new  municipal  WTE  projects.  Fly  ash  is  solidified  and  applies  cement \nstabilization technology before disposal in a landfill. Bottom ash is reused for various end-uses. \nWastewater is treated on-site and is both reused and recycled. For its agricultural WTE projects, \nthe company has adopted procedures and guidelines to manage potential impacts on air quality \nthrough the use of appropriate air emission-control equipment, and on water quality and quantity \nthrough  treatment,  recycling,  and  reuse.  Guidelines  also  govern  bottom  and  fly  ash \nmanagement through recycling by supplying to the fertilizer and construction industry. \n \n37. \nCEIL\u2019s  environmental  and  social  management  system  incorporates measures  to  avoid, \nminimize,  and  mitigate  the  potential  adverse  environmental  and  social  impacts  of  its  projects. \nThe  audit  of  CEIL\u2019s  implementation  of  its  environmental  and  social  management  system  is \nfound  to  be  satisfactory.  CEIL\u2019s  experience  with  its  existing  WTE  plants  ensures  that  the \nenvironmental  and  social  impacts  of  future  municipal  and  agricultural  WTE  plants  will  have \nadequate  mitigating  measures  and  monitoring  programs.  The  institutional  capacity  and \n\n\f9 \n\ncommitment  of  CEIL  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and  environmental  impacts  are  deemed \nadequate.  To  ensure  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,16\n the  borrowers  will \nbe required to prepare an environmental assessment report and a resettlement planning report \nfor each project and submit to ADB for review and approval, and implement the approved plans. \nThe borrowers will also be required to submit annual monitoring reports. \n \n38. \nThe borrowers will comply with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy and report regularly to \nADB  on  their  compliance  (including  contractors)  with  national  labor  laws  and  adherence  to \ninternationally recognized core labor standards.17\n \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\nthe \n\nthat \n\nThe borrowers were advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice \n39. \nrelating  to  combating  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.  ADB  will \nensure \nincludes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting \ncorruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event \nof noncompliance. \n \nC. \n\ninvestment  documentation \n\nInvestment Limitations  \n\nThe  proposed  direct  loans  are  within  the  medium-term,  country,  industry,  group,  and \n\n40. \nsingle-project exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD. \n\nAssurances \n\nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the \n41. \nCharter),18\n the Government\u2019s no objection to the proposed assistance to the Borrowers will be \nobtained. ADB will enter into suitable finance agreements, in form and substance satisfactory to \nADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan facility would comply with the Articles of Agreement \n42. \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve a loan facility of \nup  to  $200  million  without  government  guarantee  for  the  Agricultural  and  Municipal  Waste  to \nEnergy Project in the Peoples Republic of China, comprising: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\na  loan  to  China  Everbright  Biomass  Energy  Investment  Limited  of  up  to \n$120,000,000, consisting of (a) an A loan of up to $60,000,000 to be funded from \nADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  and  (b)  a  B  loan  of  up  to  $60,000,000  to  be \nfunded by international commercial banks on terms and conditions to be mutually \nagreed upon between the borrower, such participating banks, and ADB; and \nChina Everbright Environmental Energy Limited of up to $80 million, consisting of \n(a)  an  A  loan  of  up  to  $40,000,000  to  be  funded  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources  and  (b)  a  B  loan  of  up  to  $40,000,000  to  be  funded  by  international \ncommercial banks on terms and conditions to be mutually agreed upon between \nthe borrower, such participating banks, and ADB,  \n\n                                                \n16  ADB. 2009.
