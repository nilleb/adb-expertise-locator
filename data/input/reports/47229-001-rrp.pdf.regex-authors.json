I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto India for the Uttarakhand Emergency Assistance Project.1  \n \n2.  Under the project, basic infrastructure damaged by unprecedented disaster in June 2013 \nwill be reconstructed.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The disaster. About 90% of Uttarakhand\u2019s land area is mountainous and most is prone \nto natural disasters. During 15\u201317 June 2013, major cloudbursts, incessant rains, and floods \nresulted  in  heavy  loss  of  life,  the  destruction  of  livelihoods,  and  severe  damage  to  basic \ninfrastructure. The districts of Bageshwar, Chamoli, Pithoragarh, Rudraprayag, and Uttarkashi \nwere the worst affected. These also happen to be important pilgrimage destinations, and the \ndisaster occurred during the peak pilgrimage season. The floods washed away towns and \ndestroyed a large number of houses, public buildings, roads and bridges, rural and urban water \nand sanitation facilities, power transmission and distribution lines, telecommunications towers, \nand irrigation systems. Close to 1 million people were affected. Almost 600 lives were lost and \nmore than 5,400 people are still reported missing.   \n \n4.  Government response. The state government of Uttarakhand and the Government of \nIndia,  including  the  army,  air  force,  police,  and  the  National  Disaster  Response  Force, \nresponded to the disaster through immediate rescue and evacuation operations. They followed \nthis with the supply of emergency shelter,  medical assistance, cash transfers to the most \naffected,  and  basic food  supplies.  State governments,  the  private  sector,  and  civil  society \nincluding national and international nongovernment organizations helped with the relief effort. \nThe  United  Nations  Disaster  Management Team  also  provided  support, first  with  situation \nreports and later with damage and needs assessments in key areas. The next phase of the \nemergency  response  involves  restoring  livelihoods  and  rebuilding  damaged  infrastructure. \nLivelihood  support  will  be  handled  directly  by  the  government  of  Uttarakhand  and  the \nGovernment of India. Infrastructure rehabilitation is the area for which the government has \nformally sought assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank. \n \n5.  Damage and needs assessment. A joint rapid damage and needs assessment was \nundertaken  by  the  government  of  Uttarakhand,  ADB,  and  the  World  Bank.2 Because  of \npersistent  bad  weather, floods,  and  landslides,  physical  access  to  the  affected  areas  was \nvirtually impossible. The assessment relied instead on data collected by the government of \nUttarakhand during relief operations. The damage and needs estimate is close to $700 million, \nwith roads and bridges accounting for $450 million. This is still a preliminary and conservative \nestimate. Some observers suggest the final damage may be more than $1 billion.  \n \n6.  Request for assistance. The government requested emergency assistance from ADB \nand  the  World  Bank.  The  finance  will  be  allocated  to  rebuilding  basic  infrastructure.  The \nGovernment of India and the government of Uttarakhand will focus on livelihoods. ADB already \nhas operations in the state (in roads, energy, urban infrastructure, and tourism) and will focus in \n                                                \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 Joint Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  ", "2 \n \nthese  areas. The rehabilitation  of  damaged facilities  in  the  energy  sector  will  be  financed \nthrough an existing ADB multitranche financing facility, which still has sufficient funds for this \npurpose.3 World Bank assistance will focus on housing, public buildings, district and village \nroads, rural water supply and sanitation, and disaster risk management and response systems. \nConsultants  will  help  the  government  of  Uttarakhand  with  subproject  preparation  and \nimplementation (including procurement), the adoption of modern road building technologies, \nroad maintenance practices, and overall project management. The consultants will also help \nwith the execution of safeguards and financial management plans.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The  emergency  loan  will  help  economic  and  social  recovery  in  Uttarakhand  in  the \naftermath of the June 2013 disaster. The outcome will be the rehabilitation of basic public and \nsocial infrastructure, as well as improvements to disaster preparedness, project management, \nand institutional effectiveness.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n8.  The project outputs include: \n \n(i)  Roads and bridges. Rehabilitate and/or reconstruct damaged sections of state \nhighways  and  district  roads  for  a  total  length  of  1,800  kilometers  (km). \nRehabilitate sections of road built in the past with ADB finance (total length 600 \nkm). Sixteen damaged bridges will also be repaired and/or reconstructed.  \n(ii)  Urban infrastructure. Repair and upgrade water supply facilities in 8\u201310 towns, \nwater treatment plants, 56-km water pipeline, and about 20 km of urban roads.  \n(iii)  Tourism infrastructure and trekking routes. Rehabilitate and/or reconstruct \ninfrastructure in five districts, including 10 trekking routes, eco-trails, rest houses, \nand public amenities.  \n(iv)  Disaster preparedness. Build about 50 helipads, heliports, or helidromes with \nassociated amenities for emergency evacuation and relief operations.  \n \n9.  Nonphysical outputs include strengthening of disaster risk management systems through \nstudies on carrying capacity and tourist regulation. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n10.  Total emergency works could cost more than $1 billion, although the initial damage and \nneeds estimate is close to $700 million. The project is estimated to cost $205 million (Table 1). \nMore details are given in the project administration manual (PAM).4 \n   \n                                                \n3 ADB. 2006.

The government  has requested  a  loan  of $200  million from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  straight-line  repayment  method,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB's  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan and project agreements. Based on this, the average loan maturity is 15.25 years and the \nmaturity premium payable to ADB is 0.10% per annum. The government has provided ADB with \n(i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility based on \nthese terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent \ndecision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The loan will \ncover 97.56%5 of project costs and includes taxes and duties.6 The Government of India and the \ngovernment of Uttarakhand will finance all the financial charges and the execution of safeguards \nplans (Table 2). The government of Uttarakhand has given assurance that it will provide all the \nnecessary counterpart funds, wherever necessary. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan  \n($ million) \nSource  Total  Percent \nAsian Development Bank     \nOrdinary Capital Resources  200.0  97.56 \nGovernment  5.0    2.44 \n  Total  205.0  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n \n                                                \n5 The average share of ADB in cost sharing is within the ceiling of 80% for the loan portfolio of the prevailing country \npartnership strategy. ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: India, 2009-2012. Manila. \n6 Overall taxes and duties in India are considered reasonable and nondiscriminatory. The taxes and duties under the \nproject cost are reasonable and do not constitute an excessively high share of total cost. \n  \n \n \n   \n ", "4 \n \nE.   Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  The executing agency for the emergency project will be the government of Uttarakhand  \nacting  through  the  State  Disaster  Management  Authority  (SDMA).  A  core  committee  for \nmonitoring and review of disaster management will oversee all the reconstruction work (chaired \nby the chief secretary, government of Uttarakhand) and coordinate the activities financed by \nADB and the World Bank. A project management unit will be set up in the SDMA to help with \nthis work. The implementing agencies will be the Public Works Department (roads, bridges, \ntrekking routes,7 and urban roads), the Department of Tourism and the Uttarakhand Tourism \nDevelopment  Board,  Garhwal  Mandal  Vikas  Nigam  and/or  Kumaon  Mandal  Vikas  Nigam \n(tourism  infrastructure),  the  Uttarakhand  Civil  Aviation  Development  Authority  (helipads, \nheliports, or helidromes), and Uttarakhand Jal Sansthan (urban water supply). The emergency \nworks will be implemented over 3 years, which is longer than the typical period of 2 years for \nemergency assistance loans. The 3-year implementation period is justified because the terrain \nconditions in Uttarakhand make the execution of physical works difficult, especially in winter and \nthe  rainy  season.  However,  some  of  the  works  under  the  project  are  expected  to  be \nimplemented sooner than that.  \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  October 2013-September 2016 \nEstimated  completion  30 September 2016 \ndate \nManagement   \n(i) Oversight body  Monitoring Committee chaired by Chief Secretary \n(ii) Executing agency  Government of Uttarakhand acting through  \nState Disaster Management Authority  \n(iii)  Key  implementing  Public Works  Department  for  roads,  bridges,  trekking  routes  and  urban \nagencies  roads;  \nDepartment of Tourism and the Uttarakhand Tourism Development Board, \nGarhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam, and/or Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam for \ntourism infrastructure;  \nUttarakhand Civil Aviation Development Authority for helipads, heliports, or \nhelidromes;  \nUttarakhand Jal Sansthan for urban water supply \n(iv) Implementing Units  Project implementation units of the respective implementation agencies in \nthe field \nRetroactive financing and  For eligible expenditures incurred after 16 June 2013, but not earlier than 12 \n/or advance contracting   months before the date of the loan agreement, and to a maximum of 30% of \nthe loan amount \nDisbursement  The  ADB  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. \n \n13.  Retroactive financing. Retroactive financing will apply to eligible expenditures incurred \nafter 16 June 2013 but not earlier than 12 months before the date of the loan agreement. \nAdvance actions are being taken in relation to the procurement of goods, services, and work. \nThe government has been advised that approval of advance action and/or retroactive financing \ndoes not commit ADB to finance any part of the project. \n \n                                                \n7 The implementation of trekking routes may be assigned to various government departments and agencies. ", "  5  \n \n14.  Procurement. The procurement of goods and works will be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). The PAM gives \ndetails of this. National competitive bidding with a shortened bidding period of 2 weeks will be \nthe  preferred  mode  of  procurement.  The  use  of  shopping  and  limited  competitive  bidding \nprocedures  based  on  the  government  of  Uttarakhand\u2019s  existing  registration  system  for \ncontractors will also be acceptable for goods, small civil works, and related services. Civil works \ncontracts estimated at up to $40 million will be procured through national competitive bidding. \nBidding documents based on post-qualification with single-stage two-envelope procedures is \none procurement option. For procurement of goods, small works, and related services estimated \nto cost less than $100,000, the use of limited competitive bidding and shopping procedures will \nbe followed. This will mean inviting bids from registered class A contractors by the government \nof Uttarakhand. For small, specialized equipment and materials contracts valued at less than \n$20,000, direct contracting procedures acceptable to ADB will be followed, where relevant. The \ndamaged trekking routes and eco-trails may be reconstructed under the force account method \nby the various departments and agencies of the government of Uttarakhand. Under ongoing \nADB-funded projects in Uttarakhand, contractors executing the rehabilitation and reconstruction \nworks will qualify for the restoration of works through contract variations under their respective \ncontracts, where appropriate.  \n \n15.  ADB  will  conduct  prior  reviews  of  bid  evaluation  reports  and  contract  award \nrecommendations for the first two contracts for each implementing agency irrespective of the \ncontract values. All subsequent contracts estimated to cost up to $3 million will be subject to \npost procurement reviews in the field conducted semiannually. All implementing agencies will \nretain a record of all procurement documents including copies of the signed contracts and the \nbid evaluation reports, to be available for post procurement reviews in the field. All contracts \nvalued at more than $3 million will be subject to prior review by ADB. ADB will conduct capacity \nbuilding workshops for the staff of executing and implementing agencies on ADB\u2019s procurement \nand  consultant  recruitment  procedures,  as  well  as  for  prior  and  post  procurement  review \nrequirements. If ADB determines during the procurement review that the agreed procurement \nprocedures were not followed, it has the option to not approve the award or terms of the \ncontract, meaning that the government will not be able to use loan proceeds to finance these \ncontracts. If the loan proceeds have already been used to finance such contracts at the time of \nsuch determination, the government will refund to ADB the expenditures made. Rebidding and \nextension of bid validity for contracts estimated to cost $3 million and above will be subject to \nADB\u2019s prior approval. Community participation in procurement of small works of a simple nature \nwill be encouraged.\n \n \n16.  Consulting  services.  All  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). It is estimated that \n5\u20136 national design and construction supervision consulting firms will be recruited under the \nemergency project. Experts will also be engaged to deal with financial management needs, \nsafeguards,  procurement,  training,  road  building  technologies,  disaster  preparedness, \ncommunications, and overall project management and reporting. The consulting firms will be \nrecruited through quality- and cost-based selection using simplified or full technical proposals as \nneeded  and  acceptable  to  ADB.  Individual  consultants  may  be  engaged  through  open \ncompetition  acceptable  to  ADB.  Since  the  project  will  be  completed  within  36  months, \nrecruitment and mobilization of consultants will be done expeditiously with an option of reduced \nproposal submission periods of 1\u20132 weeks at each stage for expressions of interest and for \n  \n \n \n   \n ", "6 \n \nrequests for proposals. If requested by the executing agency, ADB may assist in selecting \nindividual consultants for the executing agency and implementing agencies. \n  \n17.  Reporting. The executing agency will provide ADB with quarterly progress reports on \nthe work done, in all cases backed by consolidated annual audits. The executing agency, in \nconsultation  with  the  implementing  agencies,  will  set  up  a  project  performance  monitoring \nsystem within 6 months of loan effectiveness using the targets, indicators, assumptions, and \nrisks in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). Further details are provided in the \nPAM.  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical  \n \n18.  A list of indicative subprojects has been agreed with the government of Uttarakhand. All \nsubprojects need detailed preparation and this work will be part of the implementation plan. \nWhenever necessary, consultants will help with this work. The screening of priority projects will \nbe led by the executing and implementing agencies. The objective is to rebuild to the same \nstandard or better. The approval of subprojects will follow subproject selection criteria and \napproval  procedures8 already  agreed  with  the  authorities,  which  includes  adherence  to \nsafeguards requirements and technical and economic viability.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n19.  Economic assessments will be undertaken for all subprojects in accordance with the \nselection criteria and approval process once the first set of priority investments has been agreed.    \nThe economic evaluation will be undertaken covering all the key areas of economic analysis, as \nacceptable to ADB. The subproject will demonstrate an economic internal rate of return of at \nleast 12% or the chosen technical option will be the least cost option for providing the essential \nneeds and services. If there is a justification that the economic benefits cannot be entirely \nquantified, the economic rate of return of 10% instead of 12% can be acceptable. The capacity \nof the executing agency and implementing agencies in undertaking economic assessment will \nbe improved through consultant support. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n20.  A financial management assessment of the executing and implementing agencies was \nconducted for the purposes of the emergency project.9 One finding is that financial reporting and \ninternal controls require strengthening. Experts will be engaged to help with this work.  \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  of  India,  government  of  Uttarakhand,  SDMA,  and  all  implementing \nagencies. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the \nPAM. \n \n \n                                                \n8 Subproject Selection Criteria and Approval Procedures (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n9 Review of financial management systems of the Uttarakhand Civil Aviation Development Authority could not be \nundertaken as this is a new agency. ", "  7  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n22.  Under the project, basic infrastructure will be rehabilitated and reconstructed. This is \ncritical for key economic and social activities in the state. The reconstruction effort will contribute \nto welfare in the state, as well as to poverty reduction.  \n \n23.  The emergency project is supported by a gender action plan. This will ensure that \ngender concerns and other social vulnerabilities are addressed during the reconstruction period. \nThe works will create employment and livelihood opportunities for women. Awareness raising \nwill be undertaken on core labor standards, including those that are gender specific, such as \nequal pay for work of equal value. Contractors will carry out HIV/AIDS awareness programs \nwithin the project influence area in a gender-sensitive manner. The improved road connectivity \nwill provide better access to health services, education, economic opportunities, and social \ninteraction. Improved connectivity, increased tourism, and improved urban water supply will \nresult  in  more  time  spent  on  productive  activities,  self-development,  and  empowerment  of \nwomen.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n24.  Because of bad weather conditions, continued flooding, landslides, and lack of access to \nthe affected areas, field visits and other investigations for safeguards assessments could not be \nconducted. This means that individual safeguards plans could not be prepared for identified \nsubprojects. Under the emergency loan provisions of the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), \nsafeguards  frameworks  can  be  prepared  instead.  These  guided  subproject  selection  and \nscreening, and later the preparation of safeguards planning documentation.    \n \n25.  Environment. Environmental impacts for most of the subprojects are expected to be \nconstruction related, as well as temporary and reversible in nature. However, some of the \nsubprojects are likely to be in close proximity to, or within, environmentally sensitive areas such \nas national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and biospheres, and therefore the possibility of significant \nadverse  environmental  impacts  is  not  ruled  out.  As  all  the  subprojects  will  be  selected, \nappraised, and approved during the implementation phase, the emergency project is classified \ncategory A for environment. Since the project is supported through an emergency assistance \nloan, and furthermore follows a sector loan modality, the disclosure standard requirements for \nenvironmental impact assessments for subprojects in category A will be changed from the 120 \ndays prior to ADB Board of Directors approval to 120 days prior to the award of contracts under \nthe related subproject.10  \n \n26.  An environmental assessment and review framework has been prepared and disclosed \non the ADB website.11 It includes subproject selection criteria and environmental guidelines to \navoid and minimize adverse impacts during the identification and finalization of subprojects. \nThese impacts will be mitigated through environmental impacts assessment (for category A) \nand  initial  environmental  examination  reports  (for  category  B)  including  environmental \n                                                \n10 Para. 14 of Section D7/OP of the Operations Manual provides that management can waive the 120-day rule for \ndisclosure of environmental assessment reports for category A projects (those with a potentially significant \nenvironmental impact) on a project-by-project basis for procedural flexibility in the application of safeguards \nrequirements in case of emergency assistance loans. ADB. 2004. Disaster and Emergency Assistance. Operations \nManual. OM D7/OP. Manila. \n11 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n  \n \n \n   \n ", "8 \n \nmanagement and monitoring plans that will be incorporated into related contract documents and \nmonitored  by  the  implementing  agencies.  The  environmental  assessment  documents  for \nsubprojects will be disclosed on the ADB website. The agencies will conduct consultations with \nlocal communities during implementation. Some of these agencies are already implementing \nADB-funded projects. Their capacity to deal with safeguards is reasonably good. However, this \nwill be further improved through consultant support and training. ADB will not finance projects \nthat do not comply with its Safeguard Policy Statement, nor will it finance projects that do not \ncomply with India\u2019s environmental laws and regulations, including those projects that infringe \nlaws covering India\u2019s obligations under international treaties, as set forth in the environmental \nassessment and review framework. In addition, ADB will not finance activities on the prohibited \ninvestment activities listed in Appendix 5 of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. Environmental \nreporting to ADB by the executing agency will be done annually for category B subprojects and \nsemiannually  for  category  A  subprojects,  and  will  be  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website.  All \ncomplaints from  affected  people  will  be  addressed  through  a  dedicated  grievance  redress \nmechanism. \n \n27.  Social. Reconstruction works are expected to be within existing rights-of-way and on \ngovernment land. No major land acquisition is envisaged. However, the realignment of some \nroad sections, construction of helipads, heliports, or helidromes, and trekking routes are likely to \ncause minor land acquisition and involuntary resettlement impacts. No impact on indigenous \npeoples is envisaged. The project is classified category B for involuntary resettlement and \ncategory C for indigenous peoples. Subproject selection criteria have been formulated to avoid \nland acquisition, resettlement impacts, and social risks. However, should a need arise during \nimplementation to undertake subprojects classified category A for involuntary resettlement or \ncategory  B  for  indigenous  peoples,  a  suitable  recategorization  will  be  undertaken  and  a \nresettlement  plan  or  indigenous  peoples  plan  prepared.  A  resettlement  framework  and \nindigenous  peoples  planning  framework  has  been  prepared  and  disclosed  on  the  ADB \nwebsite.12 The capacity of the executing agency and implementing agencies in resettlement \nplanning and implementation is not adequate to meet ADB requirements and will be improved \nthrough  consultant  support  and  training.  Extensive  consultations  will  be  undertaken  with \nstakeholders in all project areas during implementation. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n28.  The overall risk associated with the rehabilitation of basic infrastructure is medium, while \nthe integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. The risk assessment \nand risk management plan for the project provides details on key risks.13 The most important \nrisks  relate  to  the  limited  capacity  of  the  executing  and  implementation  agencies,  limited \nfinancial management systems, and inadequate capacity of contractors. In view of poor access \nto work sites, limited working season and unpredictable weather, the low participation and \ncapacity of contractors is another risk. Climate change is also an emerging issue.  \n \n29.  The  capacity  of  executing  and  implementing  agencies  will  be  improved  by  the \ndeployment of experts in project preparation and implementation. Training and capacity building \nworkshops will be conducted on these and other areas. Governance and fiduciary risks will be \ncontained through the engagement of professionals with experience in financial management, \nauditing,  and  accounting.  The  participation  of  quality  contractors  will  be  encouraged  by \n                                                \n12 Resettlement Framework; Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n13 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "  9  \n \norganizing business opportunity workshops. The cost estimates will be prepared taking into \nconsideration the poor access to work sites and construction activities will be scheduled to \nutilize  the  limited  working  season  efficiently.  Climate  change  could  escalate  existing \nvulnerabilities  (social,  ecological,  economic,  and  cultural).  The  reconstruction  effort  will \nincorporate  climate-resilient  design  options.  The  disaster  risk  management  system  will  be \nsupported by World Bank technical assistance. ADB will also underpin this work.  \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n30.  The Government of India, government of Uttarakhand, SDMA, and all the implementing \nagencies have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all applicable \nADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender, \nprocurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as  described  in  detail  in  the  project \nadministration manual and loan documents.  \n \n31.  The  Government  of  India,  government  of  Uttarakhand,  SDMA,  and  implementing \nagencies have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the \nloan agreement and project agreement.   \n \n32.  As a condition for disbursement of the loan, the Government of India, government of \nUttarakhand,  SDMA,  and  all  the  implementing agencies  will  ensure  that  the  high-powered \ncommittee, project management unit, and project implementing units are in place with adequate \nstaffing acceptable to ADB. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n33.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$200,000,000 to India for the Uttarakhand Emergency Assistance Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 \nyears; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n21 October 2013 \n \n  \n \n \n   \n ", "10                            Appendix 1 \n \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact       \nImproved economic and  By 2020:     Risk \nsocial conditions in  (i)  Tourist arrivals increased  Tourist arrival data by  Extreme \nUttarakhand after the  by 20% from pre-disaster level  state tourism  weather events \n2013 disaster    department  occur \n     \n(ii)  State gross domestic  Report by central \nproduct increased by 20% from  statistical office \npre-disaster level   \nOutcome       \nBasic public and social  By 2016:    For all indicators:  Assumption  \ninfrastructure restored,      Coordinated \nand disaster  (i)  80% of damaged  Periodic project  and timely \npreparedness, project  infrastructure (state roads,  progress reports by  response by \nmanagement and  major district roads, bridges,  executing agency  government \ninstitutional  urban roads, tourism  (government of  and donors \neffectiveness improved  infrastructure, and water supply  Uttarakhand acting   \n  lines) in the project area  through State Disaster   \nreconstructed and rehabilitated  Management Authority)  \nwith climate-resilient features  \n(ii)  Water supply to about \n20,000 households restored to \nservice level standards of \nGovernment of India in the \naffected urban areas, reducing \ntime spent by women and girls \nin water collection and \nmanagement \nOutputs       \n1.
