The Project will enhance poor \nfarmers\u2019  capacity  to  adopt  innovative  agricultural  production  and \nmarketing  methods  by  better  targeting  village-level  public \ninvestments  to  location-specific  needs,  providing  farmers  with \naccess  to  information,  and  reorienting  the  focus  of  agricultural \nresearch to the needs of marginal rainfed areas. Nongovernment \norganizations  working  through  elected  village  facilitators  and \nsupported by government and private agencies will help farmers to \nidentify  innovations,  and  undertake  the  necessary  public \ninvestments to support adoption. \n   \nClassification  Primary: Core poverty intervention \nSecondary: Gender and development \n   \nEnvironmental  Category  B:  Environmental  implications  were  reviewed  and \nAssessment  environmental  interventions  incorporated  as  required.  An  initial \nenvironmental examination for sample subprojects was undertaken, \nand the summary is in Appendix 13. \n   \nRationale  To improve their incomes, poor farmers have to be able to innovate \nin  agricultural  production  and  marketing  in  response  to  market \nopportunities. However, they are constrained from doing so because \nof a lack of appropriate technologies, village-level investments in \npublic goods, and access to information. While the Government is \ntaking steps to fill the gaps in providing public goods support for \nagriculture, and increasingly for nonrice crops, additional support is \nneeded to target village-level public investments to the needs of \npoor farmers, to increase the access of poor farmers to information, \nand  to  increase  the  availability  of  technologies  needed  by  poor \nfarmers. The Project responds to the above by empowering farmers \nto undertake simple village-level investments, providing support for \nthe development of appropriate technologies for marginal rainfed \nareas,  and  providing  farmers  with  the  relevant  information \nresources. \n   \nObjectives and Scope  The  long-term  development  goal  is  increased  innovation  in \nagricultural  production  and  marketing  by  poor  farmers.  The \nimmediate objectives of the Project are (i) improved targeting of \nvillage-level  public  investments  to  location-specific  needs  of \nagricultural  and  rural  development,  (ii)  increased  access  of  poor \nfarmers  to  information,  and  (iii)  a  reorientation  of  the  focus  of \nagricultural research to the needs of marginal rainfed areas. The\n ", "iii \n  Project will comprise four components to be implemented over 5\nyears: (i) poor farmer empowerment, (ii) development of national \nand  local  agricultural  information  resources,  (iii)  support  for \nagricultural  innovation  development  and  dissemination,  and  (iv) \nproject management. \n   \nCost Estimates  The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $70.92  million  equivalent, \nincluding  physical  and  price  contingencies,  interest  during \nconstruction, taxes, and duties. Of the total cost, $15.28 million or \n21% is the foreign exchange cost and $55.64 million equivalent is \nthe local currency cost. \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million)\n  Local   Foreign      \nSource  Currency  Exchange  Total  Percent \n         \nADB  40.72  15.28  56.00  79.0 \nIndonesian Government  7.18  0.00  7.18  10.2 \nDistrict Government    0.99  0.00  0.99  1.4 \nBeneficiaries  6.75  0.00  6.75  9.5 \nTotal  55.64  15.28  70.92  100 \n  ADB = Asian Development Bank.  \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide a loan equivalent to \nSDR 42.09 million ($56.0 million equivalent) from its Special Funds \nResources  to  finance  $15.28  million  equivalent  of  the  foreign \nexchange cost and $40.72 million equivalent of the local currency \ncost. The loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period \nof 8 years and an interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2008. \n   \nImplementation  The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) will establish a national steering \nArrangements  committee (NSC) chaired by the Secretary General, MOA. The NSC \nwill include representatives of other agencies of MOA, BAPPENAS \n(National Development Planning Agency), Ministry of Finance, and \nother stakeholders. The NSC will oversee project implementation \nand  provide  policy  guidance  in  the  coordination  of  project \nimplementation.  The  Agency  for  Agricultural  Research  and \nDevelopment  of  MOA  will  establish  a  project  coordination  and \nmonitoring  unit  (PCMU).  The  PCMU  will  prepare  project \nimplementation during year 1 of the Project and then assist the NSC \nthroughout  implementation  by  serving  as  its  secretariat.  District \ncoordination committees consisting of private and public agencies \nwill  be  convened  and  chaired  by  heads  of  district  governments \n(bupatis)  in  each  project  district  to  backstop  the  preparation  of \nvillage investment plans as required, to ensure the sustainability of \nnew  projects  undertaken  by  villages,  and  to  harmonize  village\n ", "iv \n  investments with the Government\u2019s own district-level investments. \nProject  implementation  units  (PIUs)  will  be  established  in  each \nproject  district  to  manage,  coordinate,  and  monitor  the \nimplementation of project activities at the district level. Project inter-\nvillage forums (PIVFs) consisting of elected heads of the village \nproject  investment  committees  (VPICs)  and  the  elected  woman \nfacilitators  from  each  project  village  in  the  subdistrict  will  be\nestablished at the subdistrict level to be the sole village investment \napproval body. One VPIC will be established in every eligible project \nvillage to validate and consolidate investments proposed by farmer \ngroups, present these at PIVF meetings, undertake implementation, \nand manage funds. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Agency for Agricultural Research and Development of MOA \n   \nProcurement  Procurement  under  the  Project  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement. Contracts for civil works will be relatively simple for \nrenovation  of  district  offices,  valued  at  less  than  $100,000 \nequivalent,  and  will  be  carried  out  by  the  PIUs  using  local \ncompetitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB. The PIU will also \nbe  responsible  for  procurement  of  office  furniture  through  local \ncompetitive  bidding.  The  PCMU  will  carry  out  procurement  of \nvehicles and equipment estimated to cost more than $100,000 but \nless than $500,000 using international shopping procedures. Civil \nworks  for  community-managed  village  infrastructure,  including \ntubewell irrigation schemes and access roads, financed from the \nvillage  investment  funds  may  be  carried  out  by  communities. \nCommunities  shall  provide  labor  and  appropriate  technologies. \nMaterials and services for such civil works estimated to cost less \nthan $30,000 equivalent shall be procured through direct purchase.  \n \nConsulting Services  A team of 24 consultants for a total input of 796 person-months of \nthe following international and domestic consulting services will be \nrequired to prepare a detailed implementation plan and procedures \nfor the Project during the first year, and support the subsequent 4-\nyear  implementation  phase.  Person-months  are  given  in \nparentheses.  The  international  experts  (54)  will  be  specialists  in \n(i)  project  implementation  (team  leader)  (27);  (ii)  management \ninformation  systems  (12);  (iii)  participatory  planning  (4); \n(iv) agricultural marketing (4); (v) economics/financial analysis (4); \nand (vi) information management (3).

The quality and cost-based selection method \nwill be used for engaging consultants. \n \nA national NGO with extensive experience in agriculture and rural \nlivelihoods  will  be  recruited  by  the  PCMU  through  competitive \nbidding based on eligibility and evaluation criteria established by the \nProject  to  supervise  and  coordinate  local  NGOs  or  community \norganizations  in  implementing  the  village  level  activities  of  the \nFarmer Empowerment component. The national NGO will identify \nlocal implementing NGOs/community organizations that are capable \nof participating in the Project and meet criteria established by the \nProject  and  sign  agreements  with  them  to  implement  project \nactivities at the village level.  \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2007 \nCompletion Date \n   \nProject Benefits and  The  Project  will  benefit  farmers  in  five  districts  with  about  2.75 \nBeneficiaries  million poor people and overall poverty rate of 66%\u2014almost twice \nthe national average. The components for farmer empowerment, \ndevelopment  of  national  and  local  information  resources,  and \nsupport for agricultural innovation development and dissemination \nare expected to benefit these poor people by facilitating agricultural \nand marketing innovations and increasing incomes. The Project will \ntarget villages in which 75% of the households are poor. Typical \nproject beneficiaries will be poor farmers who have low productive \nlandholdings  of  less  than  0.1  hectare  and  who  generally  only \ncultivate  staples.  They  have  an  average  income  of  less  than \nRp1,000,000  per  capita  per  year,  and  often  use  communal \nresources such as the sea and the forest to supplement their income \nwhich is often not able to meet their basic needs. The village-level \ninvestments will directly raise the incomes or food security of about \n400,000 poor households to levels above the poverty line. Women \nwill directly benefit from active involvement in the planning of village \ninvestments, capacity building, and targeting of village investments \nespecially to women. \n \n ", "vi \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Indonesia for the Poor Farmers\u2019 Income Improvement through Innovation \nProject. \n \nII.  INTRODUCTION \n2.  The Project is based on the findings of Asian Development Bank missions;1 inputs from \nthe Government; the consultants\u2019 feasibility study resulting from a technical assistance (TA) \ngrant to the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) Bureau of Planning;2 socioeconomic surveys; an initial \nenvironmental  examination;  and  consultations  with  regional  and  local  governments, \nbeneficiaries,  private  banks  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  external  funding \nagencies, and consultants. The project framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nIII.  BACKGROUND \nA.  Sector Description \n1.  The Agriculture Sector \n3.  ADB\u2019s 2001 country operational strategy (COS), poverty assessment in Indonesia,4 and \n1998 agriculture sector strategy study and update in 2000,5 provide the overall context for \nagricultural and rural development in Indonesia. Agriculture provides employment to a large \npercentage of Indonesia\u2019s population; substantially meets the country\u2019s food requirements; and \nprovides most raw materials for manufacturing, particularly for exports. However, agricultural \ngrowth has stagnated and lagged behind growth of the nonagriculture sectors. Policy distortions \nhave constrained growth. While recent initiatives to deregulate the sector have improved sector \nincentives for farmers, (i) inadequate technology development, (ii) deficient physical and social \ninfrastructure, (iii) weak institutions, and (iv) improper incentives continue to restrict the ability of \nfarmers to improve incomes. \n \n4.  Constraints are particularly severe in marginal rainfed areas, particularly in the drier \neastern half of Indonesia. Technology development for these areas has lagged far behind that \nfor well-endowed irrigated areas. Much government agricultural support is planned centrally and \ndoes not adequately address location-specific, village-level causes of low and unstable yields \nand inadequate market access. Inadequate horizontal communication and vertical access to \ninformation reduce the access of farmers to technologies, potential markets for their products, \nmarket prices, input sources and prices, and potential solutions to farm problems. \n \n5.  The  Government  recently  has  been  taking  steps  to  improve  the  agricultural  policy \nenvironment  and  to  incorporate  larger  agricultural  and  rural  development  goals  within  a \n                                                 \n1  Loan fact-finding from 23 July to 24 August 2001; a preappraisal mission from 23 October to 14 November 2001; \nand an appraisal mission from 1\u201311 April 2002. \n2  ADB. 2000.

Many \nreforms  recommended  by  ADB\u2019s  sector  strategy  (footnote  5)  have  been  undertaken. \nGovernment agricultural programs are moving to a bottom-up planning approach but continue to \nbe focused on stimulating production of crops important to food security. The centrally planned \nagricultural  support  system  continues  to  be  aimed  at  rice  and  rice  farmers  on  productive \nirrigated areas, mainly in western Indonesia. Even with decentralization, government support \nservices  often  cannot  adequately  address  location-specific  constraints  to  improvements  in \nagricultural production and marketing. \n \n6.  Nearly all programs of international assistance to the agriculture sector are increasing \nthe  emphasis  on  poverty  and  good  governance;  encouraging  regional  autonomy  and \nenvironmental  protection;  and  supporting  human  development  through  social  sector,  social \ninfrastructure, and social protection efforts. This similarity requires heightened aid coordination \nto avoid duplication. In preparing the Project, close coordination with agencies and countries \nproviding external aid has been maintained to ensure complementarity and compatibility and to \navoid overlap. Extensive discussions were held with the World Bank in particular, to avoid \noverlap and ensure complementarity with ongoing projects of the World Bank.6 \n \n2.  Poverty and Agriculture \n7.  Agricultural growth and rural development have always been key to directly reducing \npoverty in Indonesia. The decline in poverty during the 1970s was due in large part to the rapid \ngrowth  in  agricultural  production  and  the  resulting  job  creation  in  off-farm  employment  in \nagricultural processing, transport, and trade. Poverty reduction impacts have been low since the \nmid-1980s as agricultural productivity stagnated and returns to farming declined. During the \neconomic crisis, however, agriculture provided a safety net to workers shifting out of declining \nsectors.  Despite  the  declining  importance  of  agriculture  in  the  economy,  about  58%  of \nIndonesia\u2019s poor derive their income primarily from agriculture. About 40% of those engaged in \nagriculture are poor (the highest poverty rate in any economic sector in Indonesia). \n \n8.  Similarly,  rural  development\u2014which  is  centered  upon  agriculture\u2014has  important \nimplications for poverty reduction. Almost 90% of the rural poor and near poor derive their \nincome primarily from agriculture. Quality of life of the rural poor is very low. Eighty percent of \nthe rural population have less than 5 years of formal education. One third of rural infants are \nmalnourished, while more than 50% of rural women suffer from micronutrient deficiencies. \nThese low living standards prevent the rural poor from accessing the benefits of economic \ngrowth\u2014bad health and illiteracy renders them unsuitable for many forms of employment. \nTherefore, apart from the direct impact of improvements on quality of life that is normally \nassociated with an increase in incomes, rural development will also increase access of the poor \nto the benefits of economic growth by improving quality of life. \n \n9.  For poor farmers, the constraints identified by ADB\u2019s COS manifest themselves as \nimpediments  to  adopting  production  and  marketing  innovations  necessary  to  engage  in \ncommercial production and access the benefits of wider economic growth. While technology has \nbeen developed for some upland and rainfed areas, many marginal and rainfed areas typically \ninhabited by poor farmers lag behind well-endowed areas in terms of options for technological \n                                                 \n6  World Bank loans: 4007: Sulawesi Agriculture Area Development Project, for $42.6 million, approved in 1996; \n3984: Nusa Tenggara Agricultural Area Development Project, for $41.1 million, approved in 1996; 3888: Village \nInfrastructure Project, for $72.5 million, approved in 1995; 4330: Kecamatan Development Project (KDP), for \n$225.0 million, approved in 1998; and Loan 46270: Second Kecamatan Development Project, for $421.5 million, \napproved in 2001.  ", "3 \ninnovation  available.  Location-specific  public  investments  for  village  roads,  storage,  minor \nirrigation, soil and water conservation works, assessment and dissemination of technology in \nvillages, and farmer training have not received adequate support. Information development and \ndissemination has often not been designed for poor farmers, but rather aimed at promoting \nincreases in food production. This in effect has locked poor farmers into a low-level equilibrium \ntrap preventing them from accessing the benefits of wider economic growth. Consequently, the \nwider rural economy remains at a low level of commercial activity restricting rural nonfarm \nactivities,  depressing  wages  of  landless  laborers,  and  propagating  rural  poverty.  Detailed \nstudies undertaken as part of the feasibility study for the Project identified several village \ninvestments that can allow farmers to adopt innovative production and marketing methods, and \nbegin commercial production. \n \nB.  Lessons Learned \n10.  ADB\u2019s  country  synthesis  of  lessons  learned  from  projects  in  Indonesia7  and  sector \nsynthesis  of  lessons  learned  from  projects  under  agriculture  and  natural  resources8  are \nparticularly relevant for the Project. ADB\u2019s agriculture projects in Indonesia have not performed \nas  well  as  projects  in  many  other  sectors  because  they  are  complex  and  target  diverse \nenvironments.  Overly  rigid  implementing  arrangements  and  design  features  often  impede \nproject  success  because  they  do  not  allow  the  flexibility  to  adjust  to  evolving  economic, \ntechnical,  and  social  circumstances  and  local  conditions.  Well-defined  project  formats  and \nprocedures ensure acceptable standards for procurement, financial management, and project \nquality.  Implementation  arrangements  must  be  based  on  the  realistic  capacities  of  sector \ninstitutions if project benefits are to be sustained beyond project completion because no means \nremain to replicate and sustain project activities. \n \n11.  Community participation improves project quality, targeting, and sustainability, but has to \nbe well supported through training and technical support. Community control over project funds \ninduces communities to allocate resources according to priorities and potential, but the transfer \nof  funds  to  communities  without  social  preparation  has  led  to  unsatisfactory  results.9 \nCommunities cannot be left to their own resources to design and implement projects. Skilled \ntechnical  and  social  facilitation  and  backstopping  from  external  sources  is  crucial  for  the \nsuccess of community projects. Experience has also shown that group mobilization is most \neffective if a member of the local community facilitates it, and that the participation of women \nincreases project effectiveness and sustainability. NGOs and community organizations have \nsuccessfully  trained  community-based  organizations  in  fund  management,  microenterprise \nmanagement,  participatory  monitoring  and  evaluation,  marketing,  and  technology  adoption. \nContractor management in Indonesia is poor and complaints are rarely addressed. This in turn \nadversely  impacts  on  project  sustainability  and  ownership  by  beneficiaries.  This  can  be \nremedied by making contractors directly accountable to end users. Small-scale infrastructure \n                                                 \n7  Country Synthesis: Lessons Learned for Projects in Indonesia.

Postevaluation \nInformation System, ADB internal database. \n9 ADB\u2019s evaluation of its support for credit programs has shown that these are best executed by institutions that \nfunction as financial intermediaries, have financial discipline, and are supervised by an appropriate regulatory body \nto ensure public confidence. Since project areas do not all have such institutions, the Project does not include a \ncredit component. Funds are to be used only for public investments and thus are transferred to communities as \ngrants. Local or regional authorities or suitable NGOs do not possess lending experience but have been shown to \nbe able to provide appropriate technical and social inputs in making communities creditworthy. The Project will \nprepare communities to receive funds and link these communities with sound financial intermediaries where \navailable. ", "4 \nprojects using village-based planning and community labor have resulted in substantial savings \nas compared with central planning and implementation. \n \nC.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy \n12.  The Project directly addresses the focal points of ADB\u2019s COS, which include creating \nand strengthening basic institutions; improving regional equity, especially targeting rural areas \nand less-developed islands; undertaking human and social development; and enhancing the \nrole of women.10 The COS emphasizes participatory project design and administration, which is \nat the core of the proposed Project. The COS highlights the benefits of diverse and stable \ncropping systems, the development of rural infrastructure, and access to finance\u2014all expected \nfrom the Project. The Project is in line with the COS as it supports a demand driven and \nparticipatory process for agricultural innovation, and a transparent and inclusive implementation \napproach. The process to be developed by the Project is in itself a major output that meets \nADB\u2019s development priorities. \n \nD.  Policy Dialogue \n13.  ADB\u2019s agriculture sector strategy study (footnote 5) provided the basis for a dialogue \nwith the Government on levies on agricultural commodities, value-added tax on agribusiness, \nand decentralization of agriculture support services. Other ongoing programs are continuing the \ndialogue  and  a  favorable  resolution  will  enhance  project  benefits.11  District  coordination \ncommittees (DCCs) and project intervillage forums (PIVFs), proposed through the Project, will \nimprove communication between farmers and decentralized agricultural support services. The \nProject will reorient attention to district roads, which are an important determinant of rural \ndevelopment. Since the Asian financial crisis, budgetary constraints have caused district roads \nto fall into disrepair. District governments have agreed to prioritize their road rehabilitation \nactivities so that they complement project investments. \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n1.  Project Rationale \n14.  Recently  improved  terms  of  trade,  depreciated  currency,  deregulation,  and  farmer-\nsupport programs initiated after the financial crisis offer poor farmers in Indonesia an opportunity \nto improve incomes through the adoption of innovative production and marketing methods. \nHowever, they lack the means to do so. While the Government is taking steps to fill the gaps in \nproviding public goods support for agriculture, and increasingly for nonrice crops, additional \nsupport is needed to target village-level public investments to the needs of poor farmers, to \nincrease the availability of technologies needed by poor farmers, and to increase the access of \npoor farmers to information to support agricultural production and marketing innovations.  \n \n15.  Systems of planning, delivering, and managing village-level public investments are key \nto  effective  targeting.  Government  planning  through  its  agencies  and  delivery  by  outside \n                                                 \n10 The first country strategy and program (CSP), currently being prepared, includes a much more comprehensive \ndiscussion of sector issues, priorities, and ADB\u2019s strategy than is available in the COS. \n11 For example, the decentralization group of the Consultative Group for Indonesia is reviewing the illegal collection of \nroadside  levies  as  part  of  improving  governance  in  local  government.  The  proposed  agriculture  and  rural \ndevelopment sector strategy study will look into the impact of value-added tax on agribusiness. ", "5 \ncontractors is not an efficient means of targeting village-level public investments to location- \nspecific  problems.12  An  efficient  alternative,  which  has  been  shown  to  work  in  other \ndevelopment  projects  (most  notably  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Kecamatan  Development  Project \n(footnote 6) and ADB\u2019s TA for Participatory Approaches to Sustainable Income Generation13) is \nto  empower  farmers  themselves  to  undertake  simple  village  investments\u2014develop  their \ncapacity to do so, develop the proper institutions to support them, and give them control over \nthe funds required to implement the investments. \n \n16.  Innovation requires a sound technological base and a vibrant information environment. \nBecause marginal rainfed areas typically inhabited by poor farmers had low priority in the \nGovernment\u2019s food-security-centered development program, information on the natural base of \nthese areas has often been lacking, agricultural research for these areas has received less \nsupport than that for well-endowed irrigated areas, and information dissemination has not been \ntargeted to them. Therefore, the technological base for farmer innovation in marginal rainfed \nareas is not well developed and adequate information on available technologies, potential \nmarkets for products, market prices, input sources and prices, and potential solutions to farm-\nlevel problems is often lacking. \n \n17.  The  Project  is  aimed  at  promoting  innovation  development  and  adoption  by  poor \nfarmers. The Project recognizes that if poor farmers are empowered to undertake simple village-\nlevel investments, support is provided for the development of proper technologies for rainfed \nareas, and farmers have access to relevant information, poor farmers will be able to adopt \ninnovative production and marketing methods and break out of their low-level equilibrium trap. \n \n2.  Coordination with other ADB Projects \n18.  The Project dovetails with ADB\u2019s initiatives to reduce rural poverty in Indonesia. Through \nthe Participatory Development of Agricultural Technology Project (PAATP), ADB is increasing \ncapacity for adaptive research in response to farmer needs.14 The proposed Project will better \ninterface this capacity with farmer needs and increase the participation of farmers in adaptive \nresearch, thus enhancing the benefits of the PAATP. \n \n19.  The  Project\u2019s  focus  on  agriculture  differs  from  the  more  general  rural  development \napproach of ADB\u2019s Community Empowerment for Rural Development Project, which develops \naccess  to  efficient  local  government,  rural  finance,  and  markets.15  While  the  Community \nEmpowerment for Rural Development Project will make government planning agencies more \n                                                 \n12 Government planning and implementing agencies necessarily operate at an aggregated level and do not have the \nresources to plan and implement with the detail required for village-level investments. Nor is it efficient for \ngovernment agencies to plan and implement with such a level of detail. For village-level investments, the \ninformation costs of incorporating the required information into a top-down planning model and then responding to \nlocation-specific  needs  are  very  high.  Such  investments  undertaken  by  government  agencies  often  fail  to \nincorporate the requisite degree of design detail, are not adequately flexible to adapt to unexpected information \ndiscovered during implementation, and therefore often fail to meet the requirements of farmers. Further, past \nexperience  has  shown  that  farmers  themselves  can  efficiently  undertake  the  implementation  of  the  public \ninvestments. Also, lessons from previous projects show that contractor management in Indonesia has been poor \nand that small-scale village-level projects using community labor inputs can be implemented at substantial savings \nas compared with implementation by national agencies or outside contractors. \n13 ADB. 1999.

", "6 \nresponsive to the demands of local communities, the proposed Project will enhance the benefits \nof this responsiveness by helping poor farmers to better express their needs.  \n \n20.  The Project will not provide credit to farmers. It will however develop capacity at the \nvillage level for fund management and investment identification, and establish institutions to \ndovetail with a proposed project for rural microfinance.16 More generally, since the Project will \nmake poor villagers viable recipients of the microfinance funds with minimum additional social \npreparation, villagers will also be able to access funds from established financial intermediaries \nsuch as Bank Rakyat Indonesia. The proposed Project will also link up with the proposed \nParticipatory Irrigation Sector Project.17 When the capacity to identify and implement village-\nlevel irrigation projects has been developed, farmer groups will be able to access funds to be \nprovided by the proposed irrigation project.18 \n \n21.  The foundation for participatory village-level planning and implementation has been laid \nby previous ADB projects. The advisory TA for Participatory Approaches to Sustainable Income \nGeneration (footnote 13) developed a methodology for the development of household business \nplans. This methodology will be used with modifications in the Project. The Integrated Pest \nManagement for Smallholder Estate Crops Project has established the capacity within some \nfarmer groups to address pest problems.19 This capacity can be developed with modifications as \nnecessary in project locations. The Rural Income Generation Project has established a method \nof village-level fund management through village finance units.20 This method of village-level \nfund management can now be applied to project areas. \n \nB.  Objectives and Scope \n \n1.  Objectives \n \n22.  The long-term development goal is increased innovation in agricultural production and \nmarketing by poor farmers. The immediate project objectives are (i) improved targeting of \nvillage-level public investments to location-specific needs of agricultural and rural development, \n(ii) increased access of poor farmers to information, and (iii) a reorientation of agricultural \nresearch to marginal rainfed areas. \n \n2.  Scope \n23.  The  Project  will  comprise  four  components:  (i)  poor  farmer  empowerment,  \n(ii)  development  of  national  and  local  agricultural  information  resources,  (iii)  support  for \nagricultural  innovation  development  and  dissemination,  and  (iv)  project  management.  All \ncomponents are directed to the overall objective of increased innovation and are described in \nAppendix 2. The Project will be implemented over 5 years in about 1,000 villages in the five \n                                                 \n16 Proposed INO: Rural Microfinance Project, for $150 million, for approval in 2003. \n17 Proposed INO: Participatory Irrigation Sector Project, for $100 million, for approval in 2002. \n18 Since the Project will develop the capacity among farmer groups to identify and implement public investments, \nfarmer groups are expected to be able to access more mainstream sources of funds for identified investments after \nthe completion of the Project and thereby sustain project benefits. Moreover, if farmers recognize the value of NGO \nassistance in these activities, they will pay for the services of NGOs after project completion. Examples of such \nsustained payments beyond project completion are available from other projects and most notably from the ADB \nsupported Participatory Approaches to Sustainable Income Generation Project (footnote 13). \n19 ADB. 1996.

The  component  will  empower  farmers  to  plan  and  implement  village-level  public \ninvestments to support innovations in agricultural production and marketing. This will involve \nthree subcomponents: (i) mobilization of farmer groups and village planning, (ii) institutional \ndevelopment, and (iii) village-level public investments. \n \n25.  The  Project  will  engage  local  NGOs  (or  community  organizations)  with  ongoing \ncommunity partnerships to work through elected facilitators from the village to mobilize farmer \ngroups. Group formation will be based on village social assessments and ensure that socially \ndisadvantaged farmers will be able to participate in decision making. The NGOs/community \norganizations will train and support the facilitators, and help establish links between farmer \ngroups and government and private agencies that can support farmers. These design features \nare intended to maximize beneficiary participation, social preparation, local facilitation, technical \nbackstopping, and the involvement of NGOs and community organizations, all of which have \ncontributed to the success of similar projects. \n \n26.  The  Project  will  establish,  develop  capacity,  and  support  the  operations  of  three \ninstitutions:  village  project  investment  committees  (VPICs),  PIVFs,  and  DCCs.  The  three \ninstitutions  will  work  together  to  consolidate,  scrutinize,  approve,  support,  implement,  and \nmonitor investments proposed by farmer groups. These institutions mirror institutions prescribed \nby the law on decentralization to increase project sustainability and effectiveness. \n \n27.  The Project will support participatory planning in eligible villages to identify innovations \nand public investments necessary for their adoption. The Project will support PIVFs in their \nevaluation of village investments. The Project will provide grants of a maximum of $30,000 per \nvillage in the form of village investment funds administered by VPICs to implement approved \ninvestments.21 The VPICs will be assisted by NGOs/community organizations, development \npartners  with  whom  the  VPICs  have  developed  investment  proposals,  the  DCC,  and \ngovernment  agencies  delegated  by  the  bupati.  Funds  will  not  be  disbursed  for  private \ninvestments or to finance operating costs such as input purchase. Eligibility criteria for village \ninvestments are provided in Appendix 3. Investments will be for public goods shown to promote \ninnovations in agricultural production or marketing. Other projects have shown the benefits of \nincreasing the community participation in investment design, implementation, and monitoring \nand delegating responsibility for fund management and contractor supervision to end users. \n \nb.  Development of National and Local Agricultural Information \nResources \n28.  Capacity-building activities of the Project will address village problems, but realization of \nhigher incomes and poverty reduction requires a favorable broader context within which poor \n                                                 \n21 The estimate of $30,000 per village is based upon investment plans developed by villages during the feasibility \nstudy for the Project. Construction or repair of farm-to-market roads and irrigation systems were by far the most \nexpensive and most common investment proposed. These cost between $12,000 and $50,000. These were \nfollowed by proposals for the establishment of marketing associations at costs ranging from $5000\u2013$15,000; \ntraining in pest management ($1,900 to $7,000); and postharvest facilities\u2014storage, drying facilities, primary \nprocessing ($500\u2013$ 2,000). Investment proposals are detailed in a supplementary appendix and indicative cost \nestimates and financial analyses for investments are provided. ", "8 \nfarmers  can  identify  and  exploit  opportunities  for  innovation.  This  component  will  develop \ninformation resources of importance to poor farmers and facilitate poor farmers\u2019 access to them. \nBy accessing these resources, farmers will be able to better align production with comparative \nadvantage, improve access to agricultural input and output markets, and improve their incomes. \nSpecifically,  the  Project  will  support  staffing,  operational  costs,  equipment,  and  consultant \nsupport to (i) upgrade the agricultural market information system of MOA to expand its coverage \nand scope, and to increase the frequency of its updates; (ii) develop a national farming web site \nthat will become a source of information and eventually a platform for agricultural trade; and (iii) \ndevelop information centers at the district agriculture offices that will be linked to the information \nnetwork  of  MOA  and  also  will  disseminate  information  through  traditional  media.  This \ncomponent builds upon existing MOA activities with minimal incremental demands on scarce \ngovernment resources to increase the chance of sustainability and ownership. The potential for \nprivate sector participation in the operation of the farming web site has been explored and will \nbe further pursued by MOA. The district information centers will be partly self-sustaining after \nthe Project because they will charge for services. \n \nc.  Support for Agricultural Innovation Development and Dissemination \n29.  In addition to the grass-root activities at the core of the Project, upstream initiatives to \ndevelop  innovations  for  poor  farmers  and  their  dissemination  to  farmers  will  enhance  the \neffectiveness of village investments and lay the long-term foundation for improving in incomes of \npoor farmers. Upstream research programs for marginal rainfed areas need to be developed \nafter careful needs assessments and thereafter funded. The private sector is rarely interested in \nagricultural research for marginal areas because although returns to this research in terms of \nincome and welfare improvements are high, beneficiaries are often not able to pay for research \nand private companies are not able to recover research costs. \n \n30.  The Government is trying to reorient its upstream technology development activities to \nthe needs of poor farmers in marginal rainfed areas. This agricultural innovation component will \nassist the Government by supporting staffing, operational costs, civil works, equipment, and \nconsulting services (i) to develop human resources, basic knowledge, and support infrastructure \nwithin Agency for Agricultural Research and Development (AARD) of MOA, (ii) to support \nnational agricultural research institutes to develop agricultural innovations relevant to project \nareas (and for marginal rainfed agriculture in general), and (iii) to develop outreach programs to \ninform farmers of potential innovations to improve agricultural production. The component will \nalso establish a fund to be administered by the provincial assessment institutes for agricultural \ntechnology (BPTPs) in each province that contains a project district. This fund will support \ninitiatives of national and local universities, researchers, field technicians, extension workers, \nthe private sector, NGOs, and other agencies to develop innovations for poor farmers in the \ntarget area. The fund will also support activities to promote information exchange and capacity \nbuilding among DCC members, district government staff, and farmers from project as well as \nnonparticipating villages. \n \nd.  Project Management \n31.  The Project will finance (i) operational costs of the national steering committee (NSC); \n(ii)  staffing,  operational  costs,  equipment,  minor  civil  works,  and  consultant  support  for  a \nnational project coordination and monitoring unit (PCMU); (iii) support to develop a project \nperformance management system (PPMS); (iv) costs, including costs of minor civil works, of the \nproject implementation units (PIUs); (v) costs of external audits and independent reviews of \nNGOs and village implementation bodies; and (vi) costs of the Executing Agency\u2019s project ", "9 \ncompletion report. District governments will support the operational and other costs of the DCCs \nand PIVFs beyond project completion. \n \n3.  Poverty Focus \n32.  Selection of the project area is primarily motivated by poverty considerations and the \nimportance of agriculture to the incomes of the poor. Three of the 5 project districts are among \nIndonesia\u2019s 20 poorest districts of 20 provinces screened.22 For the five project districts, the \noverall poverty rate is about 66% according to the village potential data, which uses the Family \nPlanning Agency\u2019s household surveys.23 This poverty rate is almost twice the national average \nbased on these data. More than 2.75 million poor people live in the project districts. \n \n33.  Poverty targeting of poor farmers will be strengthened beyond the targeting of poor \ndistricts because investments will be targeted to poorer villages within these poor districts. \nVillages within the target districts have been ranked according to their poverty incidence based \nupon the village potential data. Only villages with more than 40% of households classified as not \nyet prosperous or minimally prosperous according to these data will be eligible for project \nsupport.24 Further, the ranked list of eligible villages will be provided to district governments, \nwhich will prioritize villages after giving due consideration to their poverty ranking and their \ndependence on agriculture (but also taking into account their own development and poverty \nreduction priorities). The top half of prioritized villages in a district will be eligible to submit \ninvestment proposals during year 1 of implementation in a district, and all villages will be eligible \nduring year 2, thereby according an advantage to poorer villages. \n \n34.  The village participatory process has been designed to ensure that project benefits are \ndirected primarily to the poor within villages without causing social tensions. Groups will be \nformed only after a social assessment by the NGOs/community organizations has determined \nthe optimal means of group formation to benefit poor farmers.25 Since the core of the Project is \nthe development of the participatory process, investment selection criteria are primarily related \nto the process itself and also aim to ensure that investments meet project objectives.26 \n \n \n                                                 \n22 Urban provinces, provinces with widespread civil disorder, and provinces outside ADB\u2019s proposed geographic \nfocus were excluded. Two districts were selected to maintain continuity with previous ADB assistance. \n23 Potensi desa/kelurahan, or village potential. This is a household survey attached to and conducted during every \ntype of census: agricultural, economic, and population.  \n24 The Family Planning Agency uses a simple screening device to categorize households as not yet prosperous, \nminimally prosperous, or higher (prosperous). Households are classified as not yet prosperous if they fail to meet \nany of the following conditions: (1) in general, family members are able to eat two meals a day; (2) a minimum of \ntwo different sets of clothes for home/work; or (3) house floor made of earth. Households are classified as \nminimally prosperous if they meet all of the above conditions but fail to fulfill any of the following conditions: (1) \nonce in a week, able to eat meat or egg or fish, (2) a new set of clothes once a year, (3) floor space less than 8 \nsquare meters per family member. \n25 To prevent social tensions, the process will also ensure that nonpoor stakeholders with characteristics such as (i) \ndependence on the Project, (ii) interest in the outcome of the Project, (iii) ability to influence the Project, (iv) ability \nto be affected by the Project, and (v) ability to work against the Project are given adequate consideration \nthroughout the process of development of the village investment plans. Sometimes, homogenous farmer groups \nwill be necessary to ensure that the needs of disadvantaged groups are adequately addressed. In other areas, \nmore heterogeneous groups will be appropriate. \n26 Since the Project is centered on promoting innovations in agricultural production or marketing, it will directly benefit \nthose engaged in agricultural activities, including those landless poor engaged in nonfarm agricultural activities \nsuch as livestock rearing, fisheries, postharvest activities, and agricultural support services. The Project will benefit \nlandless farm laborers indirectly through the wider agricultural growth that it will engender. ", "10 \nC.  Cost Estimates \n \n35.  The cost of the Project is estimated at $70.92 million equivalent, including physical and \nprice contingencies, interest during construction, taxes, and duties. Of the total cost, $15.28 \nmillion or 21% is the foreign exchange cost and $55.64 million equivalent is the local currency \ncost. A summary of the cost estimates is in Table 1.

Financing Plan \n36.  Indonesia\u2019s  fiscal  constraints  continue  to  be  severe  after  the  financial  crisis.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  resources  are  strained  by  the  requirements  of  macroeconomic  stabilization, \ncorporate sector restructuring, bank recapitalization, and augmentation of resources for social \nsafety nets. In view of these constraints, other funding agencies such as the World Bank and \nJapan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  have  relaxed  their  cost-sharing  requirements  for \nIndonesia. The Project is classified as a core-poverty intervention and will not generate directly \ntaxable revenues. Under these circumstances, it is proposed that ADB\u2019s 60% cost-sharing limit \nfor project financing be relaxed. This proposal is in accordance with the graduation policy, which \nallows ADB financing to exceed the country cost-sharing limit under exceptional circumstances \nand where justified on country and project grounds.27 The Government has requested that ADB \nfinance79% of the total project cost. \n \n37.  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $56 million from its Special Funds resources. \nThe loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest \ncharge of 1% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year during the remaining term. \nADB will finance 100% of the foreign exchange cost of the Project and 73% of the local cost. \nThe Government will finance about $7.19 million equivalent and district governments about \n$0.99 million equivalent in local costs. Farmers will provide about $6.75 million equivalent in in-\nkind  contributions.  The  financing  plan  is  summarized  in  Table  2,  with  details  provided  in \nAppendix 4. The Government will bear the foreign exchange risk. \n \n \n                                                 \n27  ADB. 1998. Graduation Policy. Manila.

The Executing Agency \n \n38.  The Executing Agency of the Project will be AARD of MOA. AARD will be responsible for \noverall  coordination  of  project  implementation  and  for  implementing  the  Development  of \nNational and Local Information Resources and Support for Agricultural Innovation Development \nand Dissemination components. \n \n39.  AARD is responsible for agricultural research and development in Indonesia. AARD is \none of the few MOA agencies that maintain line agencies at the provincial level. The AARD \nsecretariat  is  responsible  for  finance,  administration,  organization,  procedures,  and  human \nresource development. A number of centers provide general backstopping to the AARD system. \nAARD  has  been  satisfactorily  implementing  projects  for  international  organizations,  and  is \nsatisfactorily implementing ADB\u2019s PAATP. Particularly relevant to the Project, the PAATP has \ndeveloped the capacity within AARD\u2019s BPTPs to undertake participatory research. Procedures \nfor farmer interaction have been established. The BPTPs are now ready to respond to more \norganized expression of farmer demand and to provide guidance to district governments in their \nefforts to organize agriculture development programs at the district level. Project reporting \nprocedures have been established within AARD for the PAATP, and AARD staff are familiar \nwith ADB procedures and guidelines. ADB has evaluated AARD\u2019s implementation of research \nand development components as satisfactory in two ADB-financed integrated area development \nprojects. AARD\u2019s performance in implementing World Bank projects has been evaluated as fully \nsatisfactory. \n \n40.  Whereas earlier, AARD concentrated on production innovations, it has recently started \npaying  greater  attention  to  innovations  in  agricultural  marketing,  the  development  of \nagribusiness, and larger rural development activities. Through applied economic research by its \nCenter for Agro Socioeconomic Research and Development and the catalytic role of BPTPs, \nAARD has been encouraging the adoption of innovative agricultural production and marketing \nmethods as part of larger rural development initiatives. Through its BPTPs, AARD is particularly \nsuited  to  playing  the  advisory  and  coordinating  role  that  is  required  for  the  Project  by  a \ngovernment agency. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  The Implementing Agencies  \n41.  The implementing agencies for the Poor Farmer Empowerment component will be the \noffices of the district bupatis in the project districts. A national NGO, contracted by MOA, will be \nresponsible  for  supervising  and  coordinating  local  NGOs  or  community  organizations  in ", "12 \nimplementing the village activities of the Farmer Empowerment component. The VPICs will \nimplement village-level investments. \n \n42.  Before decentralization, separate district services (dinas) were provided for food crops, \nlivestock, estate crops, fisheries, and forestry. As a result of decentralization, district agricultural \nservices have been restructured. In many cases, the services have combined two or three \nformer services. No common pattern is followed across districts. However, in all cases, the \nservices ultimately report to the office of the district bupati. Bupatis, therefore, are in the best \nposition to implement the Project at the district level. Detailed institutional analyses of the district \nagricultural  services  for  target  districts  were  conducted  during  the  feasibility  study.  This \ninstitutional analysis demonstrates a strong capacity among district agencies to perform the \ncoordinating, backstopping, and technical advisory roles that are key to project success. District \nbupatis  have  been  provided  with  results  of  the  institutional  analysis  and  will  assign \nresponsibilities based upon this analysis and their own assessments of the capacities of the \ndistrict services. \n \n2.  Project Management and Coordination \n43.  An organization chart for project implementation is in Appendix 5. The proposed village, \nsubdistrict,  and  district  bodies  parallel  those  required  to  be  organized  according  to  the \nGovernment\u2019s decentralization laws. This will ensure sustainability and avoid the development \nof a project-specific management structure. Detailed project implementation arrangements are \ndescribed in Appendix 6. Major responsibilities and roles of the participating agencies and \norganizations are outlined below. \n \na.  National Steering Committee \n44.  The Government will establish an NSC comprised of representatives of agencies of \nMOA, National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS), Ministry of Finance (MOF), and \nother  stakeholders  to  oversee  project  implementation  and  provide  policy  guidance  on \ncoordinating project implementation. The NSC will play a monitoring and supervisory role in the \nProject. In particular, the NSC will coordinate project implementation roles across government \nagencies as required and facilitate liaison between central and district government agencies. \n \nb.  Project Coordination and Monitoring Unit \n45.  AARD will establish a PCMU headed by a project coordinator. The PCMU will prepare \nproject  implementation  during  year  1  of  the  Project,  and  then  assist  the  NSC  through \nimplementation by serving as its secretariat. The project coordinator will be assisted by AARD \nstaff assigned full-time to the PCMU and consultants supported by the Project. The PCMU will \nensure that implementation structures are in place before implementation; establish formats, \nprocedures, and guidelines for implementation; and establish the PPMS. The PCMU will be \nresponsible for implementing the Development of National and Local Information Resources, \nSupport for Agricultural Innovation Development and Dissemination, and Project Management \ncomponents. The PCMU will prepare annual work plans, conduct monitoring and evaluation, \ncoordinate  the  recruitment  of  consultants  and  NGOs  and  procurement,  ensure  that  all \nestablished procedures and guidelines are followed, establish a project web site and update it \nwith information on project progress, and provide all required reports and communications to \nADB. \n ", "13 \nc.  District Coordination Committees \n46.  A DCC will be chaired and convened by the bupati in each project district. Members of \nthe  DCC  will  include  representatives  of  the  local  parliament,  local  NGOs/community \norganizations, the regional advisory committee (established under PAATP); and staff of relevant \ndistrict government services officially assigned by the bupati. The DCC will prioritize target \nvillages within the district, and under the direction of the bupati, coordinate project activities with \nthe development activities of the district government, particularly the roads rehabilitation plan of \nthe district and the district budget allocation. The DCC will be a forum through which farmer \ngroups establish partnerships with agencies that can support their innovation. The DCC will \nmonitor project implementation in the district and address problems as necessary. \n \nd.  Project Implementation Unit  \n47.  PIUs will be established in each project district to manage, coordinate and monitor the \nimplementation of project activities at the district level. The bupati will appoint a project manager \nto head the PIU and assign adequate staff full-time to the PIU. The PIU will support the PCMU \nin project preparation at the district level. It will prepare annual work plans and budgets for the \ndistricts and serve as the secretariat for the DCC and the PIVFs. The bupati will assign technical \nstaff from the relevant district government agencies to the PIU to act as a technical committee \nthat can be consulted by the PIVF as necessary to validate the technical feasibility of proposed \ninvestments. The PIU will be responsible for compiling required information from the district and \nreporting to the PCMU. It will regularly report to the DCC on subdistrict activities and plans \napproved. The PIU will be responsible for the funds disbursement process at the district level. It \nwill be the primary intermediary between the DCC, PCMU, regional advisory committee, and \nother agencies. The PIU will undertake procurement of minor civil works and equipment needed \nfor  project  management.  It  will  monitor  physical  and  financial  progress;  prepare  relevant \nprogress reports to the DCC, and PCMU; and maintain consolidated project accounts. \n \ne.  Project Intervillage Forum \n48.  PIVFs will be established at the subdistrict level. Members of the PIVF will be elected \nheads  of  the  VPIC  and  elected  woman  facilitators  from  each  village  in  the  subdistrict.  In \naddition,  representatives  of  NGOs/community  organizations  and  facilitators  working  in  the \nvillages, a representative of the agricultural subdistrict services office, and extension workers \nwill be invited to attend meetings of the PIVF as observers and advisers. The PIVF will be the \nsole village investment approval body. It will also be responsible for monitoring the approved \nvillage  investments.  After  project  completion,  the  PIVF  will  be  supported  by  the  district \ngovernment. The PIVF will ensure that guidelines are followed in the preparation of village \ninvestments and that the proposed investments are socially, economically, technically, and \nenvironmentally sound. The PIVF will prepare a detailed annual plan and cash flow for approved \nand forecast investments. It will monitor implementation progress, review financial management, \ndevelop specific action plans for resolving problems, and report on project progress to the DCC \nthrough the PIU. \n \nf.  Village Project Investment Committee \n49.  A five-member VPIC will be elected in every project village to validate and consolidate \ninvestments proposed by farmer groups, present these at PIVF meetings, mediate to resolve \ndisputes,  and  implement  village  investments.  The  VPIC  will  establish  and  operate  a  bank \naccount  to  manage  funds  for  investments  approved  by  the  PIVF  and  disburse  funds  for ", "14 \napproved investments. The VPIC will ensure that implementation is in line with proposals and in \naccordance with guidelines. Implementation progress and disbursements will be posted on a \nvillage bulletin board. The VPIC will maintain accounts accessible to the public. \n \n3.  The Participation of NGOs  \n50.  A national NGO with extensive experience in agriculture and rural livelihoods will be \nrecruited by the PCMU through competitive bidding based on eligibility and evaluation criteria \nestablished  by  the  Project.  Local  NGOs/community  organizations,  through  a  series  of \nconsultations  during  the  first  year  of  the  Project,  will  identify  a  set  of  NGOs/community \norganizations that are capable of participating in the Project and meet criteria established by the \nProject.  The  national  NGO  will  work  with  the  PCMU  to  select  local  implementing \nNGOs/community organizations from this identified set and sign implementation arrangements \nwith them to implement project activities at the village level. The national NGO will train the local \nNGOs/community organizations, supervise and monitor implementation at the village level, and \nprovide technical backstopping as necessary. Eligibility criteria for NGO/community organization \nselection are in Appendix 7. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 8. Eligibility criteria and \nterms  of  reference  were  developed  after  extensive  consultations  with  NGOs,  government \nagencies, and with reference to ADB\u2019s Study of the Role of NGOs in ADB Projects.28 \n \n4.  Implementation Schedule \n51.  Project  implementation  will  take  5  years.  Appendix  9  provides  the  schedule  of \nimplementation.  The  first  year  will  mainly  be  preparatory  to  implementation,  including, \nestablishment of offices, systems, and processes for project coordination and management, and \nissuance of required decrees by national and district governments. Preparation will include the \nengagement of consultants and the national NGO; the establishment of DCCs, PIUs, VPICs, \nand PIVFs; and engagement and training of local NGOs/community organizations. During year \n1 of project implementation, eligible villages will be prioritized by the DCCs in consultation with \ndistrict governments. Investment proposals will be accepted for approval by the PIVFs three \ntimes a year, beginning the last quarter of the second year of implementation. Implementation of \ninvestments is expected to require 1 year.  \n  \n5.  Procurement \n52.  Procurement under the Project will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Contracts \nfor civil works will be relatively simple for renovation of district offices, valued at less than \n$100,000  equivalent,  and  will  be  carried  out  by  the  PIUs  using  local  competitive  bidding \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. The PIU will also be responsible for procurement of office \nfurniture through local competitive bidding. The PCMU will carry out procurement of vehicles \nand equipment estimated to cost more than $100,000 but less than $500,000 using international \nshopping  procedures.  Civil  works  for  community-managed  village  infrastructure,  including \ntubewell irrigation schemes and access roads, financed from the village investment funds may \nbe carried out by communities. Communities shall provide labor and appropriate technologies. \nMaterials and services for such civil works estimated to cost less than $30,000 equivalent shall \nbe  procured  through  direct  purchase.  Indicative  Procurement  Packages  are  provided  in \nAppendix 10. \n \n                                                 \n28 ADB. 1999. Special Evaluation Study of the Role of Nongovernment Organizations in ADB Projects. Manila. ", "15 \n6.  Consulting Services \n53.  A team of 24 consultants for a total input of 796 person-months of international and \ndomestic consulting services will be required to prepare a detailed implementation plan and \nprocedures  for  the  Project  during  the  first  year,  and  support  the  subsequent  4-year \nimplementation phase. Person-months are given in parentheses. The internationally recruited \nexperts (54) will be specialists in (i) project implementation (team leader) (27); (ii) management \ninformation  systems  (12);  (iii)  participatory  planning  (4);  (iv)  agricultural  marketing  (4);  (v) \neconomics/financial analysis (4); and (vi) information management (3). The domestic experts \n(742) will be specialists in (i) project implementation (60); (ii) district liaison (five officers) (240); \n(iii) participatory planning (27); (iv) national monitoring and evaluation (60); (v) district monitoring \nand evaluation (five persons) (240); (vi) economics/financial analysis (6); (vii) gender (27); (viii) \nmanagement information systems (16); and (ix) information management (6); as well as an \nombudsperson (60). An international consulting firm in association with domestic consultants \nwill be selected using the full technical proposal procedure in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of \ndomestic  consultants.  The  quality  and  cost-based  selection  method  will  be  used  for  the \nengagement of consultants. The expertise required and outline terms of reference for consulting \nservices are provided in Appendix 11.  \n \n7.  Fund Flow and Disbursement \n54.  For ADB loan funds, direct payment, reimbursement, and imprest account procedures \nwill be used. Detailed fund flow and disbursement arrangements and fiduciary controls at each \nstep of fund flow are presented in Appendix 12. Funds for village-level investments will be \ndisbursed through the imprest account as grants directly to the village bank accounts held by \nthe VPICs. These grants will be subject to the maximum amount established by the Project for \neach district (based on the total number of eligible villages in the district), the maximum amount \nestablished  for  the  district  for  the  particular  budget  year  (based  on  the  implementation \nschedule), and a maximum (of $30,000) for each village in the district. The PIU will monitor \nthese limits. The project management component will be managed by the PCMU and the PIU. \nFor district project management costs, the PIU will establish a bank account at the district level \nto manage its own project management costs and the costs of the DCC and the PIVF. These \nwill be clearly defined in an implementation agreement between the PCMU and the PIU. The \nPCMU will directly manage fund flow for other components. The national NGO contract will \nprovide  funds  for  national  and  local  NGO/community  organization  staff,  training  and  non-\nagricultural technical support for village planning (including VPIC expenses), and remuneration \nfor village facilitators. \n \n55.  The imprest account will be established and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook. The initial deposit will be $3.5 million and is based on expected \ndisbursements for the first 6 months of implementation. The statement of expenditures (SOE) \nprocedure may be used for reimbursement of eligible expenditures for village investment plans, \ngood and services contracts, and individual and consulting firm contracts, and to liquidate \nadvances provided into the Imprest Account, in accordance with ADB\u2019s \"Loan Disbursement \nHandbook\" and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the Government and ADB.  Any \nindividual payment to be reimbursed or liquidated under the SOE procedure shall not exceed \nthe equivalent of $100,000. Statement of expenditure documentation will be retained at the PIU \nor the PCMU depending on where the expenditure is incurred.   \n ", "16 \n8.  Accounts, Audits, and Reporting Requirements \n56.  The PCMU and PIU will maintain records and accounts to identify goods and services \nfinanced out of loan proceeds and to disclose the use thereof. The PCMU will maintain all \naccounts  for  expenditures  for  the  Support  for  Agricultural  Innovation  Development  and \nDissemination and the Development of National and Local Agricultural Information Resources \ncomponents.  The  PIUs  will  maintain  their  own  records  for  expenditure  out  of  their  bank \naccounts. The VPICs through their finance units will maintain accounts as specified by ADB\u2019s \nRural  Income  Generation  Project  and  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Nusa  Tenggara  Agriculture  Area \nDevelopment Project (footnote 6), and their books and records will be open to public access. \nSummary information on village-level expenditures will be posted on office white boards for \npublic view. The National NGO will maintain records and accounts for community development \nactivities  including  payments  to  local  NGOs/community  organizations,  development  and \ntechnical verification costs of investment plans, payments to facilitators, and other expenses. \n \n57.  The PCMU will prepare financial statements for the Project, and have them audited \nannually in accordance with sound auditing principles by independent auditors acceptable to \nADB. Certified copies of audited accounts and auditors\u2019 reports will be submitted to ADB within \n9 months after the end of each fiscal year.  \n \n58.  The PIUs will prepare and submit to the PCMU semiannual progress reports during the \nimplementation period within 15 days after the end of the reporting period, a midterm review \nreport, and a project completion report 3 months after project completion. The PCMU will \nconsolidate progress reports (incorporating financial and physical data) to be submitted to ADB \nno later than 30 days after the end of the reporting period. Reports will include progress made \nand problems encountered, steps taken or proposed to be taken to remedy these problems, and \nthe proposed program of activities and expected disbursements for the following period.  \n \n9.  Project Performance Management System \n59.  The PCMU will have overall responsibility for project monitoring and evaluation. Assisted \nby consultants, it will design, execute, and analyze baseline, midterm, and completion surveys, \nas well as any special studies that may be required.29 A monitoring unit within the PIUs assisted \nby  consultants  will  monitor  the  field  activities  for  the  farmer  empowerment  component. \nConsultants will assist in (i) setting up a computer-based, gender-disaggregated PPMS, in \naccordance with the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s reporting requirements; (ii) selecting a set of \nmonitorable development indicators; (iii) designing the various surveys; and (iv) organizing \nworkshops  and  an  on-the-job  training  program  for  staff  assigned  to  the  monitoring  and \nevaluation section, including those of the PIUs. The PPMS will be designed to enable the PCMU \nto (i) keep track of physical implementation; (ii) coordinate and assess the various inputs of the \nProject  to  achieve  the  targets;  (iv)  assess  project  impact  from  a  set  of  quantifiable  and \nqualitative indicators of social, environmental, gender, and economic impacts; and (v) produce \ndata for reporting purposes. The indicators will include data to allow valuation and monitoring of \nenvironmental and gender-specific benefits. The project design framework will be used as a \nstarting point to design the PPMS and will be revised iteratively as appropriate during project \nimplementation. \n \n                                                 \n29 Indicators will be selected to monitor achievement of the targets established in the project framework (Appendix 1). \nInformation will be required on present value of agricultural production, crop losses, farm-market price differentials, \nincome levels of women, degree of satisfaction with village-level public investments, ease of access to information, \nresearch budgets of the central Government by type of agriculture, group dynamics, etc. ", "17 \n60.  At  the  village  level,  monitoring  will  be  participatory  with  farmer  groups  themselves \nmonitoring progress and reporting it in farmer meetings and through a public village bulletin \nboard.  Formally,  the  VPIC  will  monitor  the  implementation  of  the  investments  by  direct \nobservation.  The  village  local  government  will  monitor  the  implementation  through  written \nreports prepared by the implementation unit of the VPIC. A public village bulletin board will be \nset up upon which the VPIC will post information on progress to date, labor usage, use of funds, \nand outstanding balance. A monthly farmer group meeting will be organized by the village \nfacilitators and local NGOs/community organizations to produce a report on the progress of \nactivities  and  financial  status.  Farmer  group  members,  village  local  government,  informal \nleaders, and NGO representatives will attend the meeting. The report will contain a review of \nprogress to date, constraints or problems encountered during implementation, financial reports, \nand a report on the performance of the external agency providing implementation support. The \nsecretariat of the PIVF will convene a meeting of the PIVF to present the output of the monthly \nfarmer  group  meeting.  The  district  PIU  will  compile  reports  of  the  PIVF  meetings  into \nsemiannual reports to the PCMU. These reports will in turn be compiled and submitted to the \nNSC, and then with NSC endorsement to ADB. \n \nG.  Environmental and Social Measures \n1.  Environment \n61.  The Project is classified as category B, and an initial environmental examination (IEE) \nfor sample subprojects in four villages (Bale and Pili Makuzawa villages in Central Sulawesi, \nand Caruban and Klepu villages in Central Java) was prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental assessment requirement. A summary IEE is presented in Appendix 13. The IEE \nfound  that  the  Project  would  not  create  any  significant  environmental  impacts.  The \nenvironmental impacts associated with increasing agriculture productivity will be minor and \nmainly relate to increased exposure to agrochemicals, and therefore could potentially increase \nhealth problems related to agrochemical use. To mitigate this problem, training on health and \nsafety for utilizing agrochemicals will be included in the curriculum of the village facilitator \ntraining program. The other potential impacts are primarily related to civil works, particularly for \nrehabilitation and improvement of village roads and irrigation. Mitigation measures to address \nenvironmental impacts are provided in the management plan of the IEE. A possible exception \nmight  arise  in  the  case  of  subprojects  located  adjacent  to  protected  areas  (e.g.,  Rinjani \nProtected Area and Lore Lindu National Park). In view of the environmental sensitivity of these \nareas,  the  Project  will  not  support  any  physical  interventions,  e.g.,  rehabilitation  and \nimprovement  of  roads  or  irrigation  systems,  introduction  of  a  new  species  in  agriculture \nimprovement,  and  livestock  raising  in  these  areas  without  the  endorsement  of  local \nenvironmental NGOs, the appropriate local government authority, the NSC, and ADB. Local \nenvironmental  NGOs  are  expected  to  take  a  role  in  monitoring  implementation  of  these \nmitigation measures. \n \n2.  Social Analysis \n62.  A detailed social analysis was conducted for the target areas. While Indonesia is an \nethnically diverse country, a large degree of homogeneity often exists at the village level and \nsocial stratification varies across regions. More remote project areas face a greater range of \nproblems, many specifically related to their isolation. These include a more stratified society, \nless development activity, limited access to markets and information, and often limited access to \ninformation on legal rights. The strengthening of local traditional and informal institutions to \nmake them more inclusive, accountable, and effective at meeting community self-identified ", "18 \nagricultural development needs, will be emphasized through the Project to address location-\nspecific issues. \n \n63.  The roles of women and men in agriculture are quite similar across target regions. \nWomen have traditional tasks and areas of responsibility. However, women\u2019s participation in \nvillage life, and decision making is variable as are their specific problems. Active and high-\nquality  rural  development  programs  appear  to  have  had  some  impact  on  women\u2019s \nempowerment  at  the  village  level.  However,  women  were  rarely  involved  in  nontraditional \nagricultural activities. Women can become involved in production of high-value crops, as long as \nsuch crops are suitable for cultivation on small areas of land, such as upland crops. The Project \nintends to maximize its focus on women\u2019s activities. \n \n64.  The social realities of project areas make it imperative that group mobilization and \nparticipatory  methods  used  by  the  Project  pay  particular  attention  to  ethnic  group  variety, \ntraditional institutions (adat), and limited interaction with external communities. Since the Project \nwill work through local community organizations with ongoing community partnerships and \nthrough  village  facilitators  elected  from  the  villages,  local  customs  and  institutions  will \nautomatically  receive  primary  importance  in  the  process  of  group  formation  and  decision \nmaking. Group formation will also rely upon tools of social interaction that have been tried and \ntested in Indonesia in diverse surroundings. A national implementing NGO will be chosen to \nmaximize experience in the use of these tools. The first step in group mobilization will be a \nsocial assessment of the target community by the local NGO/community organization following \nADB\u2019s guidelines for social assessment appropriately adapted by the participatory specialist \nengaged by the Project. Special attention will be paid to the needs of indigenous people and \nwomen in this social assessment. \n \n65.  Throughout the process of mobilization and decision making, utmost efforts will be made \nto  prevent  exclusion  of  vulnerable  sections  of  the  community.  The  Project  proposes  to \nimplement  village-level  activities  through  village  facilitators  to  provide  assistance  during \ndiscussions and for problem solving and consensus building. To minimize exclusion, group \nmobilization will be preceded by an adequate stakeholder analysis, and a participation plan will \nbe  developed  to  obtain  agreement  and  support  of  all  stakeholders.  Adequate  gender \nsensitization training will precede group mobilization. Further, since facilitators will be from the \nvillage,  they  will  be  capable  of  using  local  ethnic  languages  especially  to  encourage  the \nparticipation of women and minorities. The Project will encourage the formation of homogenous \ngroups where possible and ensure that the poorest are represented in the groups. The Project \nwill encourage investments that will improve the income of poor women farmers. A gender \nspecialist  will  be  engaged  by  the  Project  to  ensure  that  gender  issues  are  adequately \nincorporated during implementation. At least one facilitator in every project village will be a \nwoman. This will avoid any exclusion of indigenous peoples that might otherwise result from the \nunsuitability of group mobilization methods to local customs and traditions. \n \n66.  Eligibility criteria have been defined for village investments to ensure the participation of \nthe poorest in their development and gender and poverty impacts. Specific assurances have \nbeen put in place to ensure the desired gender impacts of village investments, the adequate \nparticipation  of  women  in  decision  making,  and  a  greater  role  for  women  in  government \nadministrative structures. A gender action plan developed for the Project provides specific \nrecommendations for various stages of project preparation and implementation. The project \ndesign has particularly tried to ensure that market information is accessible and widely available \nto farmers and agricultural communities at the village level.  \n ", "19 \nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION \nA.  Economic Benefits and Impact on Poverty \n1.  Economic Benfits \n67.  The  Project  does  not  lend  itself  to  the  traditional  economic  analysis  of  projects. \nQuantifiable benefits will arise from village investments as increased agricultural incomes, but \nbecause  beneficiaries  determine  investments,  inputs  and  outputs  cannot  be  accurately \npredicted. The farmer empowerment component provides capacity development of poor farmers \nto solve common problems, and of local NGOs/community organizations to support farmer \ngroups. Government capacity will increase through the development of information systems and \nhuman resources for research. The innovation component promotes a demand-driven focus for \nagricultural research and development to meet location-specific needs of poor farmers, typically \nin marginal, rainfed areas underrepresented in past government research and development. \nSuch benefits are project objectives for which input costs are identifiable, but outputs and \noutcomes cannot be predicted with accuracy. Studies of the economic impact of research show \nhighly positive returns and technological innovations are examples of the public goods sought \nby the Project to create nonexclusionary benefits to improve poor farmers\u2019 incomes. \n \n2.  Impact on Poverty \n68.  Survey and census data of the Central Bureau of Statistics allow highly cost-efficient \ntargeting of the poor down to the village level using measures of consumption, diet, housing, \nmalnutrition,  and  the  like.  The  data  show  that  rich  and  poor  communities  exist  in  most \nprovinces, districts, and subdistricts; and targeting at these levels result in substantial leakage of \nbenefits to the nonpoor. Targeting at the village level allows this Project to identify a beneficiary \npopulation in which 75% of households are poor. \n \n69.  The Central Bureau\u2019s statistics show simple head-count shares of the poor as (i) 75% of \nbeneficiary households; (ii) 66% of households in project districts; and (iii) 12.1% of taxes based \non their share of national expenditure. However, the 75% head count of poor households \nunderstates the poverty impact of the Project as it is concerned only with the share of benefits, \nwhile ADB\u2019s prescribed analysis also incorporates share of costs, mostly by taxes to which the \npoor contribute only 12.1%. The analysis ratios are (i) poverty impact ratio of the net benefits to \nthe poor to total net benefits, and (ii) net benefits to the poor as a ratio to project cost. \n \n70.  The poor\u2019s high share in benefits and low share in costs will result in a favorable poverty \nimpact ratio. If benefits from quantifiable but uncertain village investments give returns in an \nexpected range of 15% to 20%, then (i) the poverty impact ratio ranges from 3.7 to 1.8, \ndemonstrating a substantial distributional effect in favor of the poor; and (ii) the ratio of net \nbenefits of the poor to the present value of project costs range from 66% to 91%. Village plans \nreviewed show typical financial internal rates of return of some 25%, to give project economic \nreturns providing a poverty impact ratio of about 2.5 and net benefits to the poor at 75% of \nproject costs. Though uncertain in detail, the range suggests the Project is soundly poverty \nfocused,  and  efficient  and  effective  in  delivering  benefits  to  the  poor.  The  poverty  impact \nassessment is discussed in greater detail in Appendix 14. \n ", "20 \n3.  Delivery Efficiency \n71.  Delivering  village  level  public  investments  is  more  efficient  through  the  Project\u2019s \nproposed mechanism: (i) decision making authority and implementing responsibility delegated \nto  farmers  themselves,  and  (ii)  funds  controlled  by  farmers  than  through  planning  by \ngovernment agencies and delivery through outside contractors. After decentralization, village-\nlevel public investments are delivered through a three-stage process: (i) information gathering at \nthe  village  level  through  an  extension  agent  or  field  staff  of  the  agricultural  service;  (ii) \nconsolidation of village information and central investment priorities at the district agricultural \noffice,  development  of  investment  plans,  and  identification  of  village  investments;  and  (iii) \ndelivery  of  village  investments  typically  through  contractors  supervised  by  government \nagencies. Rough estimates show that delivering $30,000 of village investments through the \nexisting government structures would cost between $4,505 and $4,675. In contrast, the annual \ncost  of  delivering  proposed  project  investments  using  village  decision  making  with  NGO \ncoordination and technical backstopping is estimated at $1,648. Cost savings are achieved \nbecause technical backstopping is provided only as needed; information collection and planning \nat the village level have very low costs; and the cost of relaying information from the village to \nthe district level, incorporating this information in a wider development planning mechanism, and \ntranslating this information into investment plans is avoided. \n \nB.  Environment  \n72.  An important feature of the Project is its focus on developing the capacity of village \nfacilitators  to  involve  farmers  in  actively  identifying  and  implementing  village  investments. \nTherefore, the approach to raising environmental awareness in the Project will be to integrate \nenvironmental assessments into the formulation of village investments, rather than to try to \nimpose another layer of environmental intervention. The village plans will take into account \nenvironmental aspects (e.g., rainfall, evaporation, soils, consumption of agrochemical) with the \nassistance  of  competent  local  expertise  identified  by  local  and  national  NGOs.  Applicable \ngovernment  regulations  will  be  strictly  adhered  to  in  the  implementation  of  all  village \ninvestments.  Therefore,  the  Project  will  offer  potential  environmental  benefits  by  avoiding \nenvironmental costs resulting from failure to take into account environmental conditions in \nselecting the right inputs for agriculture and other economic activities. \n \nC.  Social Dimensions \n73.  The Project will directly enhance the capacity of poor farmers to innovate in agricultural \nproduction  and  marketing.  Since  the  type  of  agricultural  technology  chosen  will  take  into \nconsideration local social and physical conditions of the project areas, agricultural production \nrisk will be reduced. Vulnerable groups will, therefore be accorded security of income streams \nand welfare. The Project will work together with local village facilitators, local NGOs/community \norganizations, and competent local expertise such as district agriculture extension workers, who \nunderstand  the  local  social  conditions  and  who  will  use  this  knowledge  as  a  basis  for \nstrengthening  participatory  development.  This  will  increase  the  participation  of  the  poorer \nsections in public decision making. This empowerment of the poor is expected to sustain itself \nbeyond the life of the Project. The organizations put in place by the Project are expected to be \ninstitutionalized in the target districts and expanded to other districts. The Project is, therefore, \nexpected to have benefits beyond its implementation period and area. Since the Project will \nhave a significant impact on reducing isolation by improving access to markets and increasing \nthe flow of information, the Project will address social problems that are specifically related to \nthe isolation of areas. Furthermore, the Project\u2019s attention to the formation of homogenous ", "21 \ngroups and ensuring that the poorest are represented in decision making groups will ensure that \nactivities are implemented that are specifically targeted to the disadvantaged sections of the \ncommunities. The Project will not entail any resettlement. Where project investments cause any \nhouseholds  to  lose  assets,  income,  or  livelihoods,  the  households  will  be  adequately \ncompensated for the loss. \n \n74.  The  high  involvement  of  women  in  agriculture  as  farmers,  sharecroppers,  and \nagricultural laborers means that women will directly benefit from project investments. Specific \nassurances have been formulated to mitigate the possible exclusion of women and other more \ndisadvantaged groups from actively participating in project activities. The Project stipulates that \nhalf the members of the PIVFs will be women. This will increase the importance accorded to \nwomen\u2019s activities in investment selection. The development of socialization materials in local \nlanguages will increase the reflection of women\u2019s views in investment proposals. Indicators of \nthe successful functioning of the groups will be high women\u2019s attendance rates at meetings, \ntheir decision to start new group activities on their own, and the spontaneous emergence of \nwomen\u2019s groups desiring to join the Project. Monitoring and evaluation mechanisms will be built \ninto the Project so that activities can be continuously assessed to verify the extent to which men \nand women farmers are reached with the different types of project services and resources.  \n \nD.  Risks  \n75.  Years  of  top-down  centralized  agricultural  investments  have  left  farmers  with  little \ncapacity to innovate. Little village expertise exists in implementing investments and managing \nfunds. The success of the Project will depend upon (i) the effectiveness of NGOs to train and \nassist village facilitators, and (ii) the establishment of effective VPICs. The Project will pay \ncareful attention to the training of village facilitators and VPICs, and to the selection of local \nNGOs/community organizations and their training. \n \n76.  Self-help  projects  sometimes  do  not  work  because  beneficiaries  do  not  have  the \nexpertise  to  undertake  activities  they  have  themselves  identified.  Effective  links  with  local \nagencies that can provide technical expertise will be crucial to project success. Such direct links \nto  farmers  have  not  been  the  norm,  particularly  for  government  agencies.  The  efficient \nfunctioning of the DCC and the initiative of the NGOs/community organizations will be key to \nforging links between farmers and sources of technical expertise. The first year of project \nimplementation  will  be  spent  establishing  such  links  and  identifying  the  modalities  for \npartnerships between farmer groups and external agencies. \n \n77.  NGOs have sometimes had a tense relationship with external funding agencies and the \nGovernment. A healthy working relationship between NGOs and the PIUs, DCCs, PCMU, and \nPIVF are essential for project success. The relative autonomy accorded to the NGOs, the direct \ncontrol of investment funds by farmers, and the monitoring of the Project by independent groups \nwill reduce some of the tensions between government agencies and NGOs. However, some \nlocal friction could still arise in some project areas and this will have to be resolved through \nmediation by local NGOs, the national NGO, and perhaps by ADB missions. \n \n78.  As with almost every project, the risk of appropriation of benefits by the more powerful \nsections of society is a risk also in this Project. To mitigate this risk, the Project will ensure that \ndecision making groups empower poor farmers. The Project will attempt to mitigate this risk by \nmaximizing the transparency of the process and building in adequate accounting, auditing, and \nreporting requirements without placing undue administrative burden on poor villages. Strong \nsupervision by ADB will be key in identifying problems when they arise. The Project will also ", "22 \nestablish a complaints and grievance system. Complaints received will be investigated quickly \nto establish confidence in the system. The Project will specifically support an independent \nombudsperson and monitoring by an independent group. \n \n79.  The complexity of the Project makes its success crucially contingent upon efficient \nimplementation.  Centralized  management  of  such  a  complex  project  is  impossible  without \nincurring  excessive  project  management  costs.  However,  the  use  of  NGOs/community \norganizations with ongoing community partnerships is a novel approach to resolving problems \nof  managing  local  implementation.  Appropriate  monitoring  and  reporting  formats  will  be \nestablished to ensure that the decentralized implementation of the Project does not detract from \nits intended benefits. \n \n80.  Decentralization has resulted in uncertainties related to financial autonomy, revenue-\nraising powers of districts, and regulations on the use of external funds. These uncertainties \ncould potentially cause delays in project implementation and friction between central and district \ngovernments. Particularly, in the absence of guidelines on the responsibility for the repayment \nof loans from external funding agencies, districts are unsure of their loan repayment liabilities. If \ncentral  Government  guidelines  require  project  districts  to  assume  responsibility  for  the \nrepayment of the loan in the future, district governments could delay their use of loan funds until \na satisfactory resolution is reached. This would delay project implementation. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n81.  The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances  in  addition  to  the  standard \nassurances which have been incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Counterpart funds. The Government will prepare and cause the governments of \nthe project districts to prepare, by 31 December of each year, an annual plan for \nthe next year to ensure that during each year of project implementation adequate \nbudgetary allocation of required counterpart funds is made and such funds are \nreleased by the relevant authorities on a timely and regular basis to facilitate \nproject implementation. The annual plan will include (i) the allocation of sufficient \ncounterpart funds for project implementation, (ii) proposed budgetary allocation \nfor the rehabilitation of roads, and (iii) financing plan for the project. \n(ii)  Use of earmarked funds. Except as ADB may otherwise agree, the Government \nwill ensure that, throughout project implementation, the loan proceeds will be \ndisbursed  to  the  project  districts  by  budgetary  transfers  earmarked  for  such \npurposes. \n(iii)  Laws 22 and 25. The Government will ensure and cause the governments of the \nproject districts to ensure that the provision from the loan proceeds, and the \ncounterpart  contributions,  necessary  for  financing  project  activities  continue \nthroughout project implementation notwithstanding any reallocation of authority \nor  responsibility  for  channeling  external  assistance,  and  for  provision  of \ncorresponding counterpart contributions, between the national Government and \ndistricts; or any requirements for providing matching counterpart contributions for \nfunding  project  activities  from  the  project  districts  arising  from  the  full \nimplementation of laws 22 and 25 of 1999, unless otherwise agreed to by ADB. \nThe Government will: ", "23 \n(a) provide timely updates to ADB on the process of decentralization undertaken \nin accordance with the provisions of laws 22 and 25, and any implementing \nregulations issued thereunder, and take into account any views expressed by \nADB thereon; and \n(b) ensure that if existing project districts are subdivided during or before project \nimplementation as a result of the decentralization process, villages in newly \nformed  districts  will  be  eligible  to  receive  project  funds  if  new  district \ngovernments make commitments to project implementation similar to those \nmade by the governments of the project districts in their commitment letters \naddressed to ADB.  \n(iv)  PIVFs and DCCs. The Government will ensure that upon project completion, \nproject  activities  will  be  sustained  and  incorporated  into  the  planning  and \nbudgetary processes of the governments of the project districts and be funded \nthrough regular budgetary allocations of the governments of the project districts. \n(v)  Environmental.  The  Government  will  ensure,  or  cause  the  project  district \ngovernments to ensure, that \n(a) project  implementation  is  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  existing  \nenvironmental  laws,  regulations  and  standards  of  Indonesia  and  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental procedures, requirements and guidelines; \n(b) all monitoring and mitigation measures indicated in the IEE are undertaken \nfor  the  Project\u2014in  particular,  no  physical  intervention  (e.g.,  rehabilitation \nand/or construction of new roads or irrigation systems, introduction of a new \nspecies in agriculture improvement and livestock) in the villages adjacent to \nnational parks or other protected areas, specifically, to Rinjani Protected Area \nand Lore Lindu National Park,  will be undertaken without endorsement of \nlocal environmental NGOs, the appropriate local government authority, the \nNSC, and ADB on a case by case basis; and the public shall have free \naccess to environmental information pertaining to the Project; \n(c) as part of each village investment plan assessment, the PIVFs will carry out \nenvironmental screening, and where applicable, obtain  an IEE in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  requirements  and  the  relevant \nprocedures of the Government.   Any negative environmental impact that may \noccur as a result of the implementation of a village investment plan will be \nmitigated as indicated in the IEE. \n(vi)  Social assessment. As part of each village investment plan assessment, the \nPIVFs will carry out social assessments of each village investment plan, as \nnecessary, to ensure that there is no displacement of people from land, income \nsources, housing or other assets as a result of village investment activities. In \ncase  of  any  loss  of  land,  income  sources,  housing  or  other  assets,  the \nGovernment will ensure that affected parties are compensated at replacement \ncost agreed upon by those affected and endorsed in writing by the farmer group \nundertaking the investment. \n(vii)  Gender. The Government will ensure, or cause the governments of the project \ndistricts  to  ensure,  that  the  gender  action  plan  developed  for  the  Project  is \ncomplied with during the implementation of the Project so that ", "24 \n(a)  at least one facilitator in every project village will be a woman and that a \nwoman facilitator will be one of three signatories to the VPIC account for \nreceiving funds for investments approved by the PIVF; \n(b) the woman village facilitator from each project village will be a member of the \nPIVF;  and \n(c) village investment plan selection criteria will provide additional weighting to \ninvestments  that  improve  welfare  of  women  and  include  components  or \nfeatures  to  promote  and  facilitate  women\u2019s  involvement  in  investment \nimplementation. \n(viii)  Participatory  processes.  The  Government  will  ensure,  or  cause  the \ngovernments of project districts to ensure, that assessment, processing, and \nimplementation of village investment plans are carried out in compliance with the \nparticipatory processes agreed to by the Government and ADB.   \n(ix)  Eligibility criteria for village level investments. The Government will ensure \nthat  during  the  first  year  of  project  implementation  the  PCMU  will  formalize \neligibility criteria initially agreed to by the Government and ADB for selection of \nvillage investments, and that such refined criteria are, with the approval of ADB, \napplied to all village investments during project implementation and thereafter.  \n(x)  Midterm review. In the third year of project implementation, the Government will \nsubmit to ADB a midterm review report following which the Government and ADB \nwill undertake a midterm review of the Project to assess the initial impact of \ncompleted  project  outputs,  and  to  make  adjustments,  as  necessary,  to \nsubsequent  project  implementation.  In  particular,  the  review  will  assess  the \nadequacy of the budget allocations, disbursement of loan proceeds, the targeting \nmechanisms, and delivery of project inputs.   \n(xi)  Project  performance  management  system.  Within  the  first  12  months  of \nproject  implementation,  the  Government  will  establish  a  project  performance \nmanagement system (PPMS), satisfactory to ADB. The PPMS will monitor social \nimpact, gender impact, impact on agricultural productivity and marketing, etc. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n82.  The following are conditions for the loan effectiveness: \n \n(i)  the  Government  will  have  prepared  a  detailed  Project  Administration \nMemorandum acceptable to ADB; \n(ii)  the Government will have certified to ADB that adequate counterpart funds have \nbeen allocated for all activities outlined in the work plan for the first year of \nproject implementation; \n(iii)  the Government will have developed and submitted to ADB selection procedures, \nacceptable to ADB, for the selection of the national and local NGOs or local \ncommunity organizations for the Project; and \n(iv)  the Government will have issued a decree on project implementation, satisfactory \nto ADB, clearly specifying (i) the respective roles and responsibilities of district \ngovernments and government agencies in project implementation; and (ii) the \nflow of funds between these parties. ", "25 \n \nC.  Conditions for Disbursement of Loan Proceeds \n83.  No disbursement shall be made \n \n(i)  from the imprest account to a project district for expenditures under the Part A of \nthe Project until the bupati has established the DCC and the PIU, the government \nof  the  project  district  has  submitted  to  ADB  its  rehabilitation  program  for \nprioritized  roads,  and  a  satisfactory  implementation  agreement  has  been \nexecuted between the PCMU and the PIU in that project district. \n(ii)  from the imprest account for expenditures for research programs or equipment \nunder Part C of the Project until AARD has undertaken assessments of research \nat all participating NARIs, identified technology gaps, and formulated research \nprograms for marginal rainfed agriculture.    \n(iii)  to a VPIC account until a VPIC and village facilitators have been elected in that \nproject village, and a satisfactory implementation agreement has been concluded \nbetween that VPIC and the PIU.  \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n84.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various currencies equivalent to \nSpecial Drawing Rights 42,091,000 to Republic of Indonesia for the Poor Farmers\u2019 Income \nImprovement through Innovation Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with a term of 32 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n \n \n  TADAO CHINO \n  President \n \n \n15 July 2002  ", "26  Appendix 1 \nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \n \nDesign  Performance Indicators/Targets  Monitoring  Assumptions \nSummary  Mechanisms  and Risks \nGoal      Purpose to Goal \n       \n\u2022 Increased  \u2022 Poor farmers innovate in production,  \u2022 Village potential  \u2022 Districts governments \ninnovations in  marketing, and agribusiness to  data survey  and villages will \nagricultural  increase value of agricultural  \u2022 Project completion  continue to support the \nproduction and  production by at least 25%; or  report  institutions established \nmarketing by poor  decrease crop losses by at least 25%;  \u2022 Independent  by the Project after \nfarmers  and decrease farm-market price  audits  project completion. \n  differentials by at least 25% in target  \u2022 Postcompletion  \u2022 Effective links can be \nvillages three years after project  studies  established with the \ncompletion.

The Project will comprise four components to be implemented over 5 years.  \n \nA.  Poor Farmer Empowerment \n2.  This component will undertake three subcomponents: mobilization of farmer groups and \nvillage planning, institutional development, and village-level public investments. \n \n3.  Mobilization of Farmer Groups and Village Planning. The Project will engage local \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) or community organizations to undertake this activity. \nThe national NGO will select the local NGO through a prescribed selection process and provide \ntraining to the NGO as necessary if the appropriate capacity to implement the project is found \nlacking within the local NGO. This activity will, in every eligible village, involve three steps. \n \n4.  First, establish a method of farmer group organization that will take into account the \nsocial dynamics of agricultural production and marketing. The activity will begin with a social \nassessment  of  the  village  by  the  local  NGO  according  to  social  assessment  guidelines \ndeveloped by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The method for group formation selected for \nthe village will reflect the findings of the social assessment and thus incorporate the village \nsocial dynamics relevant to achieving project objectives in ensuring that socially disadvantaged \nfarmers will be able to participate in village decision making. In some cases focus group \ndiscussions at the hamlet level might be sufficient to represent the hamlet decisions. However, \nin some cases, subgroups within hamlets may be necessary.  \n \n5.  Second, provide skills training to two facilitators per village\u2014elected by villagers either \nthrough direct election or through consensus (masyarah)\u2014on participatory methods, information \ntechnology  and  data  retrieval,  preparation  of  investment  plans,  and  on-farm  trials  and \ndemonstrations. One facilitator will be a woman from the village. The training methods of the \nWorld Bank\u2019s Kecamantan Development Project and the Food and Agriculture Organization \ncommunity Integrated Pest Management program will be used extensively in facilitator training. \nThe national NGO will develop the training curriculum and training program during the first year \nof the Project. The facilitators will be paid a salary through project funds administered by the \nnational NGO. However, at the end of the Project, villages themselves are expected to pay the \nsalaries if they recognize the value of facilitators to improving incomes in the village. This will be \nmade clear to the villagers at the beginning of the Project. Also, through the project intervillage \nforum (PIVF), villages are expected to be able to engage the appropriate agencies to train \nfacilitators as necessary after the project completion. \n \n6.   Third, establish a participatory planning process at the village level to identify priority \ninvestments to support innovation. The local NGO will work with the facilitator to establish \nparticipatory  planning  processes  for  villages  to  identify  priority  investments  to  improve \nagricultural production and market access. Guidelines for the process were developed during \nthe project preparatory technical assistance and will be provided to the NGOs. The participatory \nprocess will ensure that group decisions are representative of the needs of the group as a whole \nand cannot be appropriated by a few powerful group members. The local NGO will adapt the \nprocess for each village after an initial social assessment of the village according to social \nassessment guidelines developed by ADB. The local NGOs will receive training on preparing \nsocial assessments and designing participatory processes to account for location-specific social \ndynamics through the national NGO from the participatory methods expert engaged by the \nProject.  This  training  will  be  conducted  once  at  the  district  level  in  year  1  of  project ", "32  Appendix 2 \nimplementation in that district. Once this capacity has been developed within local NGOs, the \ncapacity is expected to be sustained if it is adopted in the regular operations of these NGOs. \nThe process will be discussed and endorsed at the district level by all NGOs working in the \ndistrict. Also party to this discussion will be the gender specialists to be engaged through the \nProject, the participatory methods specialist, and a representative of the national NGO. \n \n7.  Institutional Development. This activity will establish the institutions to support farmers \nin village planning and implementation of investments. These institutions will also formally \nincorporate village planning into the wider planning of the district government. The activity will \nconsist of three activities. \n \n8.  First, through the local NGOs and facilitators, establish, develop the capacity of, and \nsupport in each eligible village for a village project investment committee (VPIC). In particular, \nthe Project will, through the local NGOs, train VPIC members in basic investment assessment, \ncash flow analysis, benefit-cost analysis, funds management and basic accounting, and basic \nbenefit monitoring and evaluation. The Project will provide the funds for regular meetings of the \nVPIC and through the local NGO provide a budget to the VPIC to perform administrative duties. \nThe operational costs of the VPIC will be borne by the village after project completion. Training \ncosts for VPIC members after project completion will be borne by the district government. \n \n9.  Second, support the establishment and functioning of the PIVF in each subdistrict in \nwhich the Project will be implemented. The Project will support the development of operational \nguidelines and procedures for the PIVF; and the development of formats, templates, and other \nmaterials that will be used for screening and selecting village investments. Support will be \nprovided to operate the secretariat of the PIVF through a unit in the district PIU and to hold \nregular  meetings  of  the  PIVF.  In  addition,  a  budget  will  be  provided  for  monitoring  and \nevaluation activities, for verifying the feasibility of proposed village investments as required, to \nallow village parliament members from nonparticipating districts to observe meetings of the \nPIVF,  and  for  regular  seminars  and  workshops  for  PIVF  members  to  improve  their \nunderstanding of rural development, information technology, and innovation. \n \n10.  Third, through the office of the bupati, and in close coordination with the provincial \nAssessment  Institutes  for  Agricultural  Technology  (BPTP)  and  other  appropriate  provincial \ninstitutions, establish a district coordination committee (DCC) consisting of NGOs, government \nagricultural technical staff, agricultural educators, private and government agencies that can \nassist  farmers  in  addressing  village-level  constraints,  village  facilitators,  and  other \nrepresentatives of civil society (newspaper reporters, advocacy groups). In addition to bearing \nthe operational costs of the DCC, the Project will support the development of a district database \nof potential partners for village investments, provide basic training to DCC members in concepts \nof rural development, support exchange visits for DCC members to visit other districts and \nparticipate  in  meetings  of  other  DCCs,  and  support  the  participation  of  representatives  of \nnonparticipating districts in DCC meetings. \n \n11.  Village  Public  Investments  to  Support  Innovation.  This  activity  will  have  three \nelements. \n \n12.  First, provide support at the village level to all poor villages in selected subdistricts to \nallow the farmer groups to use the established participatory process to prepare village plans that \nidentify and cost investments that will improve agricultural production and market access. Local \nNGOs will work with the village facilitators and appropriate partner agencies selected by farmer \ngroups to develop these plans. Links to the partner agencies will be established with the ", "  Appendix 2  33 \nassistance of NGOs with support from consultants engaged by the Project. Village plans will \nidentify investments, provide a cash-flow analysis for the investments, a simple benefit-cost \nanalysis, technical feasibility, an implementation plan including the sources of external support \nand the costs of this support, and clearly identify beneficiaries of the investments. The plans will \nhave to clearly demonstrate poverty impacts of the investments. Environmental impact and \nsocial and gender analysis will be presented in a format finalized at project Inception. NGOs will \nbe provided with a budget (through the national NGO contract) to perform this assessment \naccording to guidelines established by project preparation consultants engaged by the Project. \n \n13.  Second, support the subdistrict-level PIVFs in their evaluation of village investments by \nfinancing the required meetings and providing support through district government agencies for \nverifying the feasibility of the investments as required.  \n \n14.  Third, support the implementation of investments approved by the PIVFs through direct \ntransfers of funds to bank accounts held by VPICs. Support VPICs in the implementation of \ninvestments through the local NGOs and through government and nongovernment agencies \nthat are part of the DCCs. \n \nB.  Development of National and Local Agricultural Information Resources \n15.  The  Information  Resources  component  will  support  staffing,  operational  costs, \nequipment, and consultant support for three activities. \n \n16.  First, upgrade the agricultural market information system of the Center for Agricultural \nData  and  Information  of  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  to  increase  its  coverage,  frequency  of \nupgrades, and scope of its content to include more general agricultural market information. \nMOA will continue to operate the system after project completion.  \n \n17.  Second, develop a national farming web site that will become a source of information \nand eventually a platform for agricultural trade for importers, investors, traders, processors, and \nothers who might be interested in sourcing from or supplying to the Indonesian agriculture \nsector. The web site will be hosted on MOA\u2019s server and will be maintained by the Center for \nAgricultural  Data  and  Information.  MOA  will  continue  to  maintain  the  site  after  project \ncompletion.  \n \n18.  Third, establish information centers within district agricultural offices or the offices of the \nbupati (as determined by the district bupati) from which farmer representatives can access the \nagricultural  information  system,  which  will  function  as  \u201cone-stop-shops\u201d  for  information \nexchange where farmer representatives can find useful information relevant to innovations in \nagricultural  production  and  marketing.  District  governments  will  continue  to  support  the \ninformation centers after project completion. \n \nC.  Support for Agricultural Innovation Development and Dissemination \n19.  The  Innovation  Development  and  Dissemination  component  will  support  selected \nnational  agricultural  research  institutes  (NARIs)  and  BPTPs  to  develop  and  disseminate \nagricultural technologies relevant to project areas (and for rainfed agriculture in general); and to \ndevelop outreach programs to inform farmers of potential technological innovations to improve \nagricultural  production.  The  Project  will  support  the  Agency  for  Agricultural  Research  and \nDevelopment (AARD) in its efforts to develop upstream research programs specifically targeted \nto  rainfed  and  marginal  areas.  The  Project  will  provide  support  for  backstopping  farmer ", "34  Appendix 2 \ninnovations  through  technology  development.  Specifically,  the  Project  will  support  staffing, \noperational costs, equipment, and consultant support for six activities. \n \n20.  First, identify technologies that are appropriate for the project area. The Project will \nsupport a review of the existing shelf of technologies at a selected subset of relevant NARIs and \na rapid rural appraisal in project areas to identify technologies that are appropriate for the \nproject area. \n \n21.  Second, develop and undertake outreach programs for each of the relevant NARIs to \nmake farmers aware of the income improvement potential of the relevant technologies. One \noutreach program will be developed for all NARIs and modifications will be made to adapt the \nprototype to specific NARIs. AARD, through an appropriate work unit, will use the outreach \nprogram  as  a  model  and  implement  it  in  BPTPs  and  NARIs  not  covered  by  the  Project \nindependently of the Project. The outreach programs will utilize traditional means of agricultural \ncommunication. However, they will also use information technology using networks of MOA. \nSupport will be provided to strengthen these networks through the following specific activities: \n \n(i)  Prepare and make available in electronic format existing technical agricultural \ninformation  that  can  assist  farmers  in  adopting  innovations  in  agricultural \nproduction and marketing. The Center for Agricultural Library and Technology \nDissemination (CALTD) will convert existing hardcopy extension materials into \nelectronic format and make this available via the Internet and CD-ROM. The \nProject will acquire equipment, train staff, and establish work systems to ensure \nsmooth functioning and sustainability of the unit. Extension materials will include \n(i) leaflets, booklets, and brochures produced by BPTPs and their predecessor \nagricultural  information  centers;  (ii)  extension  materials  produced  by  projects \nwithin the MOA; (iii) technical guides produced by various directorates-general of \nMOA.  \n(ii)  Capture and make available new information that is of relevance to innovations \nby poor farmers. CALTD will develop a system to capture new publications from \nAARD and other MOA units as the publications are produced and to make them \navailable through the same interface as above. Initially this system will likely \nconsist of submission of documents via e-mail from the BPTPs to CALTD for \nprocessing  and  inclusion  in  the  collection.  Eventually,  it  may  consist  of  an \nintegrated document-management system for AARD.  \n(iii)  Assist the BPTPs to develop web sites. CALTD will continue to assist BPTPs \nthroughout Indonesia to develop web sites of their own that contain information \nuseful  to  poor  farmers,  extension,  nongovernment  organizations,  the  private \nsector, and other clients in their area. In addition, CALTD will hold a series of \nshort training courses for BPTP staff on web design for agricultural development, \nconverting  information  to  a  user-friendly  format,  accessing  agricultural \ninformation via the Internet, and improving information-management skills within \nthe BPTPs. \n \n22.  Third, identify thematic gaps in research programs of NARIs that need to be filled to \nadequately  address  problems  of  rainfed  agriculture.  The  Project  will  support  a  series  of \nworkshops of senior researchers to identify gaps in research programs of relevant NARIs due to \nwhich problems of rainfed areas remain unaddressed in Indonesia. The series of workshops will \nbe used to develop research programs at NARIs to fill gaps in existing research programs in \norder to address problems of rainfed areas.  ", "  Appendix 2  35 \n \n23.  Fourth, develop and support specific research programs for marginal rainfed agriculture \nin target NARIs. These programs will be time-bound and will be shown to have clearly identified \nbenefits  for  agriculture  and  rural  development  in  marginal  rainfed  areas  in  general,  but \nspecifically for target areas of the Project. \n \n24.  Fifth, support local initiatives to develop innovations for poor farmers in the target area. \nThe Project will establish a fund to be administered by the provincial BPTPs in each project \nprovince to provide grants for developing innovations requested by farmers. Each BPTP will \nreceive a grant fund. Universities, national and local researchers, field technicians, extension \nworkers, the private sector, and NGOs will be eligible to receive grants from this fund. BPTPs \ncan themselves also utilize the funds. Proposals will have to be endorsed by farmer groups as \nmeeting their needs. Proposals will fall in the category of agricultural production innovations or \nagricultural  marketing  innovations,  including  innovations  for  agribusiness.  Decisions  on  the \neligibility of innovation development will be made by the DCC and approved by the director of \nthe BPTP. Upon receiving the funds, the implementation of the innovation development will be \nthe responsibility of the proposing agency and will be monitored by village facilitators and the \nBPTP. In most cases the innovation development will involve a pilot test in proposing villages. If \nsuccessful, the innovation development site will serve as a demonstration site. The Project will \nsupport visits to the demonstration site by farmer groups to learn about the innovations. \n \n25.  Sixth, support BPTPs in organizing activities to encourage information and capacity \ndevelopment among district institutions and farmers. Each of the four BPTPs relevant to the \ntarget districts will receive a fund to be used with the endorsement of the national steering \ncommittee to undertake exchange visits, training, seminars, farmer field days, farmer fairs, and \nother activities to promote the exchange of information and capacity building. Targets of these \nactivities will be DCC members, district government staff, and farmers from target villages, as \nwell as nonparticipating villages. \n \nD.  Project Management \n26.  This  component  will  provide  support  for  the  preparation  of  project  implementation, \nadministrative  support;  and  monitoring  and  supervision  related  to  project  implementation, \nparticularly in relation to the operations of the NGOs. The Project will provide \n \n(i)  semiannual meeting costs and a travel budget for a national steering committee \nthat  will  oversee  and  provide  policy  guidance  in  the  coordination  of  project \nimplementation;   \n(ii)  staffing,  operational  costs,  equipment,  and  consultant  support  for  a  national \nproject coordination and monitoring unit to be established in AARD, to prepare \nproject implementation, and to assist the national steering committee throughout \nthe implementation period serving as its secretariat; in particular, support for \nconsultant costs of preparing project reporting formats; simple guidelines for \npresentation  of  economic,  social,  and  poverty  impact  analysis  in  village \ninvestment  plans;  and  other  project  documents,  and  to  set  up  a  project \nperformance management system; \n(iii)  staffing,  operational  costs,  equipment,  and  consultant  support  for  project \nimplementation units to be established within the office of the bupati of every \ntarget district; in particular, consultant and other support for the establishment ", "36  Appendix 2 \nand operation of district level modules of the PPMS to be coordinated with the \nnational level PPMS; \n(iv)  support  for  external  audits  and  independent  reviews  of  NGOs  and  village \nimplementation bodies by national and local NGO consortia, independent press \ngroups, and government officials, and financial audits by independent auditors; \nand \n(v)  support for preparing a project completion report. \n \n27.  District governments will support the operational and other costs of the DCCs, and \nPIVFs beyond project completion. \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 3  37 \nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR VILLAGE INVESTMENTS \n (to be checked by project intervillage forums with the assistance  \nof the project implementation unit as required) \n \n \nCriterion  Description  Certified by  Indicators \nPoverty Impact  Village investments should  Nongovernment  Participation register \nbenefit mainly poor farmers  organization/village  shows that poor \nfacilitator/beneficiaries  farmers participate \n  fully in the preparation \n  of the investment \n  proposals  \n   \nNGO/partner agency  Simple cash flow of \n  innovations produced \n  and benefits to \n  different beneficiaries \n  identified and show \n  that 75% of the \n  benefits from an \n  investment go to \n  farmers who have \n  been identified as not \n  yet prosperous by \n  National Family \n  Planning Coordinating \n  Board surveys. \n   \nNGO/village  A transparent \nfacilitator/  mechanism \nbeneficiaries  established by \n  consensus to resolve \n  conflicts in the use of \n  the investment is \n  accepted by all \n  beneficiaries. \n \nTechnical  Investments and ensuing  NGO/ partner agency/  Investment designs \ninnovations should be  district liaison officer/  and profiles of \ntechnically feasible.  competent local  innovations certified \nexpertise  by relevant competent \n(government or  authority as to their \nnongovernment)  technical feasibility. \n \nEnvironmental  No adverse impacts to the  NGO/district liaison  Investment designs \nenvironment will be caused by  officer/competent  and profiles of \nthe investments or the ensuing  government authority  innovations certified \ninnovations.    by relevant \ngovernment authority \nshow no unacceptable \nadverse impacts. \n \n \n ", "38  Appendix 3 \nCriterion  Description  Certified by  Indicators \nFinancial  Innovations result in higher  NGO/partner agency/  Simple cash flow/farm \nand more stable agricultural  competent local  budgets compared \nprofitability.  expertise  with cash \n  flow/budgets for \nexisting activities \nshows increases of at \nleast 20 percent or \ndecreases in \ninstability of at least \n20%. \n \nGender Impact  The investment plan is gender  NGO/female village  Gender disaggregated \nsensitive.

The Project is classified as a \u201c Category B\u201d Project and therefore, the initial environment \nexamination (IEE) and its summary were prepared in accordance with the ADB\u2019s guidelines on \nEnvironmental Assessment of the Asian Development Bank.1 This appendix is a summary of the \nIEE report. \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n \n2.  The Project will be implemented in about 1,000 villages in five districts in the four \nprovinces of Central Java, Central Sulawesi, East Nusa Tenggara, and West Nusa Tenggara. In \ngeneral, the Project will involve (i) enhancing farmer capacity for agricultural improvement, \nwhich will develop the capacity of farmer groups to identify and address agricultural production \nand  marketing  constraints,  and  provide  necessary  infrastructures  to  improve  agriculture \nproductivity;  (ii)  developing  national  and  local  information  resources;  and  (iii)  developing \ninnovations for improving agriculture production.    \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n3.  Four  villages  in  two  provinces  were  appraised  at  the  IEE  stage  and  the  particular \nphysical characteristics recorded from those village plans will provide a sketch of the variation. \n \n1.  Bale Village \n4.  Bale village is located about 50 kilometers (km) northeast of the administrative center of \nPalu in Central Sulawesi. It lies in a narrow valley drained by a stream flowing west from the \nsteep mountain range that forms the spine of the northern peninsular joining central to north \nSulawesi. The steep slopes and instability of the geological formations have combined to cause \nsevere local stream-bank erosion. The topography of this area is gently to moderately sloping, \nbut rises steeply onto the confining hills and mountains in the east. Within the village, there is \nlittle flat land (20%). Most is either sloping (30%) or steep and mountainous (50%).  \n \n5.  The valley floor was developed previously as a coconut plantation, and the original \nlowland rainforest has been extensively cleared. Minor remnants of forest remain in some \ndrainage lines on the confining steep hillslopes, but these are under pressure from shifting \nagriculture.  Plantation  remnants  remain,  while  the  stand  has  elsewhere  been  thinned  or \nremoved to provide for housing and cropping. \n \n6.  Small fishponds have been dug in a few locations but the presence of cobble layers in \nthe soils will limit where permanent pond locations are possible. The only wildlife now reported \nfrom the village, apart from domestic cattle, are wild pigs and monkeys that are pests of the \ncultivated crops and coconuts respectively. There are 1,128 people living in 301 households. Of \nthe working age population of 766 adults, 98% are farmers involved in field cropping, rainfed \npaddy rice, and cattle grazing. \n \n                                                 \n1 Based on the Indonesian Environmental Regulation on Environmental Assessment particularly the Ministerial \nDecree No. 3 of 2000, this proposed project does not require an environmental impact assessment report. \n ", "  Appendix 13  67 \n2.  Pili Makuzawa Village \n7.  Pili Makuzawa village lies about 100 km south of Palu on the Gumbasa River, which \nflows in one of a number of rift valleys that lie between steep mountain ridges that comprise this \nregion  of  Sulawesi.  The  river  system  has  a  high  gradient,  carries  a  heavy  bedload  and \ndischarges into the ocean at Palu. The mountains to the east of much of the access road to Pili \nMakuzawa  village  comprise  the  217,000-hectare  Lore  Lindu  National  Park  that  is  still \nextensively forested. The geology is complex in that the mountains have been steeply folded \nand the bedded fine metamorphics and interbedded soft conglomerate beds form unstable \nslopes, with one massive recent landslide along a ridge crest in the primary forest itself. \n \n8.  The rainfall is seasonal with about 2,000 millimeter (mm) at the village, although this \nvaries  with  altitude,  so  seasonal  runoff  and  hence  erodibility  and  flooding  in  the  river  is \ninfluenced by the mountain regime. While mountains in the park have an altitude up to 2,280 \nmeters, the valley floor at the village is about 380 meters, but cocoa plantations have been \nestablished  in  foothills  up  to  700  meters.  This  is  a  prior  land  use  that  is  the  subject  of \ncontroversy between villagers and the administrators of the National Park. \n \n9.  Seven forest ecosystems have been described2 in Lore Lindu National Park, and the \nmain lower montane forest has traditionally been important as a source of forest products, \nespecially rattan. The continuing exploitation of this resource is again a point of controversy \nbetween park administration and villages along the edge of the park. The park itself is important \nfor its fauna3, including unique mammals (dwarf buffalo, pig deer, an endemic macaque, palm \ncivet) and two species of marsupial cuscus. The park also hosts 194 species of land birds \nincluding 66 species endemic to Sulawesi. The birds include the red-knobbed hornbill with a \nwing span of over a meter, while six nesting grounds of the Maleo are known, where the ground \nbird lays its large egg in sand heated and hatched by underground hot springs. The park is \nlisted as a Man and the Biosphere Reserve by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and \nCultural Organization, and this Project will take particular care to avoid activities that could \nexacerbate existing impacts and controversies mainly along the park perimeters.  \n \n3.  Caruban Village \n10.  Caruban village is located 117 km from the Central Java capital, Semarang and is 8 km \nnorth the city of Temanggung. Rainy season of about six months begins in November making \nthis region one of the more reliable rainfall areas, although still only sufficient for a single rainfed \nrice crop in the absence of irrigation.  The area is typical of villages in this densely populated \nregion of Central Java where much of the land has been terraced for agriculture and no original \nforest remains. The tree cover on upland areas comprises fast-growing pioneers such as Cassia \nand Albizzia species with low shrub undergrowth. No original wildlife remains. \n \n4.  Klepu Village \n11.  Klepu village is located 78 km from the capital city of Central Java, Semarang, 9 km from \nthe district capital Temanggung. Most of the land is classed as upland, on a midslope area \nforming part of an extensive apron below prominent dormant volcanoes. The land is almost \nentirely terraced, and most is used for a single rainfed rice crop during the wet season from \n                                                 \n2 The Nature Conservancy (2000) Vegetation Mapping: Lore Lindu National Park.

", "68  Appendix 13 \nNovember to May, with dryland mixed cropping subsequently. There is no formal irrigation \navailable. The land has been almost completely altered by terracing and farm-related activity. \nNo forest and wild animals remain. The streams are reliable, although dry season flows are low. \nKlepu  village  has  2,511  inhabitants  (1,248  men  and  1,263  women)  living  in  about  617 \nhouseholds. There are 110 landless households involved in fattening and raising cattle, but only \nas sharecroppers. The village is pioneering the environmentally positive production of compost \nusing stall-fed cattle. \n \nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n12.  The village plans, from these sample project areas, have identified a number of activities \nor subprojects, such as (i) construction of village to market road links; (ii) provision for better \ncommunications, training, extension, and finance fund management, which could involve the \nconstruction of suitable buildings; (iii) upgrading of, or installation of new local irrigation systems; \nand (iv) introduction of new and better seeds and livestock including cattle, goats, and in some \nareas, pigs that could involve the construction of stalls.   \n \n13.  No major impacts are associated with the design, construction, or operation of the \nproposed subproject. Most of the impacts are associated with infrastructure developments that \nare associated with rehabilitation and improvement of  local roads and irrigation systems.  \n \n14.  The potential impacts of road rehabilitation and improvement into village fringe areas \nwhere shifting agriculture is practiced can be high, and exceed direct impacts from logging or \nforest product harvesting. The most dangerous will occur from burning, if others are induced to \nfollow. The geology of the dry areas is commonly such that there is fragile soil and burning can \nirreversibly destroy stable vegetation. Therefore, road rehabilitation carried out within the Project \nwill have to meet the general criterion, to eventually make upper slope shifting agriculture \nunattractive for villagers. The mitigation measures for road rehabilitation and improvement will \ninclude (i) adherence to simple safety and operating procedures to limit and contain discarding \nof fuel, oil, and solid debris from servicing equipment; (ii) adherence to designed road locations; \n(iii) adherence to a designed strategy for containing and spreading spoil to avoid dangerous \nstockpiling;  and  (iv)  adherence  to  the  designed  locations  and  specifications  of  culverts \ndischarging storm water. \n \n15.  Dams  and  canals  must  be  constructed  to  the  specifications  developed  for  each \nindividual site, and the location of each structure has to be confirmed by the project manager \nand the civil engineer before construction begins. Impacts arising from a small dam failure can \ninclude death and the destruction of downstream property in addition to the value of losses of \nthe structure, contained fish, lost crop, and lost future crop potential. \n \n16.  Some village plans include increasing livestock numbers as a significant component. \nAdequate preparation is required before a large increase in herd size can be accommodated \nwithin the village framework. In particular, feed must be planted at least 2, and up to 6 months \nbefore livestock are obtained to ensure there is sufficient to eat. Fencing has to be adequate to \ncontain the animals if they are not in stalls with provision for fresh water and fodder. Should any \none of these requirements not be met, monetary loss is likely flowing from degeneration in the \nherd and secondary impacts on adjacent lands on to which livestock are turned out. The \ntechnical service groups will be responsible for making recommendations for village plans to \naddress these issues and for village plans to then implement the required measures. \n ", "  Appendix 13  69 \n17.  Village plans that provide for the introduction of new stock or the rapid building up of \nexisting herd sizes are vulnerable to endemic and exotic diseases, and veterinary services are \ncommonly sporadic and expensive. A required veterinary backup should be in place before any \nmajor expansion in herd numbers occurs, and at least low-level animal health training should be \nincorporated into the plan for key farmers. Those villages that are in regions with a marked dry \nseason will also face a potential impact damaging for the stock from dry season fires that \ndeplete pasture availability at the most susceptible time. Village control over burning, helped by \na general interest in establishing better herds, is the method with best potential for controlling \nfires. \n \n18.  Villagers traditionally coexist with wild pigs and monkeys, which are both locally serious \npests. The village plans that include the construction of pest-proof fences expect to achieve \nbenefits by keeping the animals away from enclosed crop areas. If the plan leads to the planting \nof susceptible crops, regular maintenance of the fences and reinforcing of weak areas will be \nneeded to maintain the barriers.  \n \nE.  Institutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program \n19.  The  responsibility  for  mitigating  adverse  impacts  rests  ultimately  with  the  project \nmanager, but the effectiveness and timeliness of mitigation procedures will be enhanced if these \nrequirements are discussed with village groups as part of the consultative process. The project \nmanager and civil engineer will be responsible for ensuring that village people engaged in \nnonfamiliar work are taught how to identify safety hazards and engage in safe working habits. \nNational safety standard posters and displays can be used for the purpose. \n \n20.  Village groups assisted by technical support will develop village plans, and the Project \nwill provide funds to implement those plans. All planning will be participatory, and in developing \nvillage plans, the groups will also propose mitigation procedures and identify responsible parties \nto monitor the impacts. Therefore, a sensible approach to raising environmental awareness in \nthe Project must be developed by integrating environmental assessments into the village plan, \ninstead  of  imposing  another  layer  of  planning  on  the  process.  The  village  plans  interpret \nphysical  characteristics,  rather  than  provide  technical  data  for  independent  variables  (for \ninstance, for rainfall, evaporation, soil, etc.) so the precision of data may be less than that of a \ndetailed  environmental  study.  Introducing  the  assessment  of  risk  as  part  of  village  plan \ndevelopment through health and safety would also make the environmental concept easier to be \nappreciated by the farmers. The information available is expected to be sufficient to use as a \nbasis for assessing any impact associated with the proposed local investment.  In this context, \nthe role of the technical support (including trainers and NGOs) to produce \u201cenvironmentally \nsound village plans\u201d is very important.     \n \nF.  Findings and Recommendations \n21.  The IEE of the sample subprojects in four sample project areas has shown that no major \nimpacts will arise from the Project. However, it recommends that the Project (i) should not \nprovide funding for developing a new road; (ii) should not provide funding for any physical work \nor  physical  intervention  in  areas  categorized  as  sensitive  areas  if  no  comprehensive \nenvironmental  assessment  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  and  the  Government\u2019s  guidelines  on \nenvironmental assessment are to be carried out; (iii) should be able to provide competent \nservice providers capable of offering environmental awareness courses as part of the training \npackage for other service providers and farmer group leaders; and (iv)  should be able to  link ", "70  Appendix 13 \nenvironment,  health  and  safety  as  a  key  approach  for  all  future  training,  monitoring  and \nmitigation programs undertaken within the Project. \n \nG.  Conclusion \n22.  The IEE has shown that no major impacts will arise from the Project that warrant \nexamination by a full environmental impact assessment. The scope of the Project does not \ntrigger a requirement for a similar comprehensive examination under Indonesian law. It has \nshown that the aims of the Project can be achieved by providing awareness courses compatible \nwith  the  overall  training  programs,  and  implementing  simple  monitoring  to  increase \nenvironmental awareness. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 14  71 \nPOVERTY IMPACT ASSESSMENT \n \nA.  Benefits \n \n1.  The Project will provide community development to enhance the ability of groups of poor \nfarmers to identify and resolve common problems during and after project implementation. This \nprocess will also increase the capacity of local and regional nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs)  to  support  farmers  in  group  organizations  and  provide  access  to  problem  solving \nservices. This NGO capacity will help target villages, districts, and other areas in which they \noperate. Government capacity will increase through the development of market and technology \ninformation dissemination systems. Such capacity-building benefits are major objectives for \nwhich inputs are identifiable, but outputs and outcomes cannot be predicted with accuracy. \n \n2.  The  Support  for  Agricultural  Innovation  Development  and  Dissemination  component \npromotes a demand-driven focus for research and development on location-specific needs of \npoor farmers, typically in marginal rainfed areas underrepresented in past government research \nand development. Quantifiable benefits of innovations adopted by poor farmers reduce poverty \nthrough higher productivity, reduced costs, diversification to higher-value agriculture and/or \nimproved  market  orientation.  Assessing  such  benefits  at  the  design  stage  is  difficult  and \nspeculative, especially before research assessment and planning is undertaken in the first \npreparatory year of the Project. However, most studies of the economic impact of research \nshow highly positive returns, and technological innovations from such research are an example \nof the public goods sought by the Project to create nonexclusionary benefits to improve poor \nfarmers\u2019 incomes. \n \n3.  The Farmer Empowerment component\u2019s village funds will finance parts of the planned \ninvestments that meet required criteria, up to a maximum level of funding. This is the major use \nof project funds, but as part of the input to empower poor farmers rather than being the primary \nobjective. The investments will give quantifiable benefits of improved incomes and economic \ndevelopment.  However,  in  participatory  processes,  farmer  groups  and  communities  select \nactivities, so outputs and outcomes are uncertain. This is inevitable when beneficiaries are \ndecisions makers rather than implementers of top-down decisions. Village plans developed in \nproject preparation have been analyzed to demonstrate viability of the process at the village \nlevel and details of the analyses are included in a supplementary appendix.1 Proposals include \naccess roads, small-scale irrigation, farmer credit/cooperative groups, livestock breeding, tree \ncrop nurseries, and \u201cliving fences.\u201d Analyses show viability of the process and investment \nproposals, as with research and development, for confidence of viability rather than for detailed \nprediction of economic returns. \n \nB.  Poverty Impact \n \n4.  The Handbook for Integrating Poverty Impact in Economic Analysis of Project\u2019 of the \nAsian Development Bank sets out a methodology for assessing poverty impact, best applied to \nclearly defined inputs and outputs. Community-based participatory processes lack such simple \ndefinitions. The handbook notes that, even with clearly defined inputs and outputs, assessment \nis hampered by imprecision in assigning shares to the poor and nonpoor. This Project has high \nprecision in targeting the poor to assign benefits to the poor and nonpoor. \n \n                                                 \n1  Supplementary Appendix: Financial and Economic Analysis of Village Plan Proposals.

National Socioeconomic Survey (SUSENAS) data of the Central Bureau of Statistics \ngives  nationwide  data  for  application  of  poverty  selection  criteria  with  the  three  yearly \nexpenditure survey having the most detail. The survey measures consumption by prices and \nquantities of food and nonfood consumption, allowing estimation of calories consumed and a \npoverty definition based on a 2,100 kilocalorie diet and a standard nonfood bundle. The most \nrecent survey, in 1999, is reviewed in ADB\u2019s Poverty Assessment for Indonesia in 20002. \nSelected results are summarized in Table A14.1. The national poverty rate was assessed at \n23.3%,  rural  poverty  at  26.0%,  and  poverty  in  agriculture  at  39.7%\u2014the  highest  of  any \neconomic sector. \n \nTable A14.1: National Level Poverty Rates \n \nArea  Poverty Rate  % of Total Poor \nTotal Indonesia  23.3%  100.0% \nRural Areas  26.0%  67.4% \nAgriculture  39.7%  58.4% \nSource: National Socioeconomic Survey, 1999. \n \n6.  The survey also assesses expenditure by household quintiles, shown in Table A14.2. \nThe poorest quintile has 24.6% of the population, similar to the 23.3% national poverty rate. The \npoverty impact assessment in this appendix uses this coincidence to assign 12.1% of national \nGovernment costs to the poor, based on the lowest household quintile\u2019s share in expenditure \nrather than using a head count figure. \n \nTable A14.2: Distribution of Expenditure by Household Quintiles: 1999 \n \nQ1  Q2  Q3  Q4  Q5 \nArea \n% Pop\u2019n  % Exp  % Pop\u2019n  % Exp  % Pop\u2019n % Exp  % Pop\u2019n % Exp  % Pop\u2019n % Exp \nIndonesia  24.6  12.1  21.6  14.9 19.8 17.4 18.2 20.9  15.8 34.7\nSource: National Socioeconomic Survey, 1999. \n \n7.  Survey data show that inequality exists in every province and that poor farmers can be \nfound in every province, making provincial poverty targeting ineffective: \n \n(i)  poverty rates differ much less between provinces than between districts within \nprovinces: rich North Sumatera has 18.9% poverty but includes Nias district with \n46.3%; poor NTT has 26.8% poverty but includes Kupang district with only 9.4%;  \n(ii)  55% of Indonesia\u2019s poor and some of the poorest districts are in Java, and are \nneighbors of some of the richest districts, while some outer provinces have few \npoor, lower poverty rates, and none of the poorest districts. \n  \n8.  Thus, targeting must be at the district level or lower, and this can be achieved at low cost \nusing existing survey data. SUSENAS data can be used for district level targeting and the \nconsumption module survey of 65,000 households every 3 years provides a cost effective way \nto do this. However, large differences in poverty exists within districts and the size of districts \ncan lead to substantial leakage of benefits to the nonpoor. Thus, targeting below the district \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2000.  Poverty Assessment for Indonesia.

The Central Bureau of Statistics\u2019 PODES (Village Potential) survey covers all villages as \na census rather than sample, drawing data from several sources. The most recent PODES is for \n2000 and poverty data for target districts is summarized in a supplementary appendix. Setting a \ndefinition of a poor village at 40% or more poor households,3 the 5 target districts have 64 \nsubdistricts of which only 1 appears to have no village with 40% or more of poor households. \nOnly in 44% of subdistricts are all the villages poor, while in 55% of subdistricts there is a mix of \npoor and nonpoor villages, averaging 80% but ranging from 8% to 98%. \n \n10.  At the extreme, in Marawola subdistrict in Donggala, 45% of households are poor and \nover 58% of villages have over 40% poor households, but this poor subdistrict includes two \nvillages with 100% poor households and two villages with no poor households. Village targeting \nis needed for effective poverty focus, while subdistrict targeting will incur substantial leakage to \nthe nonpoor, and district or provincial poverty targeting is likely to have little meaning. \n \n11.  Project targeting based on villages with at least 40% of poor households gives the list of \n1,000 villages ranked in the supplementary appendix based on the 2000 PODES data. Table \nA14.3 summarizes the village data to the district level, showing that the proportion of poor \nvillages ranges from 47% in Donggala to 75% in East Lombok with an overall 66% of villages in \nthe five districts classified as poor. Village targeting gives 75% poor households in the target \n1,000 villages, 93% of all the poor households in the five districts. Such targeting uses available, \npublished data and is highly cost effective. \n \nTable A14.3: Poverty Populations and Rates in Project Districts and Sub-Districts \n \nPraKS&KSI Poor Households  Villages \nTotal \nName  Population  Range of Villages \nHouseholds  No.  %  Total  Poor  % \nMax % Min % Factor \nBlora      819,328       207,975   149,702  72% 100% 4% 23.55      295      268  91%\nTemanggung      672,545       157,913     96,559  61% 100% 3% 38.23      288      231  80%\nEast Lombok      967,579       227,254   170,966  75% 100% 27% 3.73      109      106  97%\nEnde      231,572        46,029     31,458  68% 100% 13% 7.91      172      156  91%\nDonggala      696,135       154,119     72,251  47% 100% 0% n.a.      370      239  65%\nTotal   3,387,159       793,290   520,936  66% 100% 0% n.a.   1,234   1,000  81%\nTarget Villages   2,760,016       650,428   484,866  75% 100% 40% 2.53   1,000   1,000  100%\nTarget %  81%  82%  93%   81%  100%\nSource: PODES 2000, Central Bureau of Statistics, Jakarta \n \n12.

Table A14.2 shows the poorest 20% of households as home to 24.6% of the population, indicating poor \nhouseholds are larger than average. Thus, the 40% of households adopted as a definition for poor villages \nprobably indicates a poor village population closer to 50%.

Government  receives  some  taxes,  but  its  major  role  is  to  pay  project \ndevelopment  and  operational  costs  and  repay  the  loan,  representing  a  transfer  from  tax \npayments\u2014of which only 12.1% is paid by the poor\u2014to the beneficiaries, of whom 75% are \npoor. The ratios used in ADB\u2019s poverty analysis are \n \n(i)  poverty impact ratio, the ratio of the net benefits to the poor to the total net \nbenefits; and \n(ii)  the net benefits to the poor as a ratio to project cost. \n \n15.  The combination of high share of the poor in benefits and low share in costs suggests \nhigh poverty impact. If the economic returns resulting from quantifiable but uncertain benefits of \nvillage plans are in the range of 15% to 20%, as expected, then the poverty impact ratio will be \nin the range of 3.7 to 1.8, falling as overall net present value rises to increase the denominator \nin the formula. Over a similar range, the ratio of net benefits of the poor to the present value of \nproject costs would rise from about 66% to 91%, as benefits rise in relation to the fixed project \ncosts.  Village  investment  proposals  reviewed  suggest  typical  financial  returns  to  village \ninvestments of the order of 25% to give project economic returns providing a poverty impact \nratio of the order or 2.5 and a ratio of net benefits to the poor at some 74% of project costs. \nAlthough uncertain in detail, the range suggests the Project is soundly poverty focused, and \nefficient and effective in delivering benefits to the poor. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20020725082235", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 4.0 for Windows", "ModDate": "D:20020918095243+08'00'"}}
