The Project will enhance poor \nfarmers\u2019  capacity  to  adopt  innovative  agricultural  production  and \nmarketing  methods  by  better \ntargeting  village-level  public \ninvestments  to  location-specific  needs,  providing  farmers  with \naccess  to  information,  and  reorienting  the  focus  of  agricultural \nresearch  to  the  needs  of  marginal  rainfed  areas.  Nongovernment \norganizations  working \nfacilitators  and \nsupported  by  government  and  private  agencies  will  help  farmers  to \nidentify \nthe  necessary  public \ninvestments to support adoption. \n \nPrimary: Core poverty intervention \nSecondary: Gender and development \n \nCategory  B:  Environmental \nreviewed  and \nenvironmental  interventions  incorporated  as  required.  An  initial \nenvironmental examination for sample subprojects was undertaken, \nand the summary is in Appendix 13. \n \nTo improve their incomes, poor farmers have to be able to innovate \nin  agricultural  production  and  marketing  in  response  to  market \nopportunities. However, they are constrained from doing so because \nof  a  lack  of  appropriate  technologies,  village-level  investments  in \npublic  goods,  and  access  to  information.  While  the  Government  is \ntaking  steps  to  fill  the  gaps  in  providing  public  goods  support  for \nagriculture,  and  increasingly  for  nonrice  crops,  additional  support  is \nneeded  to  target  village-level  public  investments  to  the  needs  of \npoor farmers, to increase the access of poor farmers to information, \nand  to  increase  the  availability  of  technologies  needed  by  poor \nfarmers. The Project responds to the above by empowering farmers \nto  undertake  simple  village-level  investments,  providing  support  for \nthe  development  of  appropriate  technologies  for  marginal  rainfed \nareas,  and  providing \ninformation \nresources. \n \ninnovation \nin \nThe \nincreased \nagricultural  production  and  marketing  by  poor \nfarmers.  The \nimmediate  objectives  of  the  Project  are  (i)  improved  targeting  of \nvillage-level  public \nlocation-specific  needs  of \nagricultural  and  rural  development,  (ii)  increased  access  of  poor \nfarmers  to  information,  and  (iii)  a  reorientation  of  the  focus  of \nagricultural  research  to  the  needs  of  marginal  rainfed  areas.

The loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period \nof 8 years and an interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n \nUntil 30 June 2008. \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Agriculture  (MOA)  will  establish  a  national  steering \ncommittee (NSC) chaired by the Secretary General, MOA. The NSC \nwill  include  representatives  of  other  agencies  of  MOA,  BAPPENAS \n(National  Development  Planning  Agency),  Ministry  of  Finance,  and \nother  stakeholders.  The  NSC  will  oversee  project  implementation \nin \nand  provide  policy  guidance \nthe  coordination  of  project \nimplementation.  The  Agency \nfor  Agricultural  Research  and \nDevelopment  of  MOA  will  establish  a  project  coordination  and \nmonitoring  unit \n(PCMU).  The  PCMU  will  prepare  project \nimplementation during year 1 of the Project and then assist the NSC \nthroughout  implementation  by  serving  as  its  secretariat.  District \ncoordination  committees  consisting  of  private  and  public  agencies \nwill  be  convened  and  chaired  by  heads  of  district  governments \n(bupatis)  in  each  project  district  to  backstop  the  preparation  of \nvillage  investment  plans  as  required,  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of \nnew  projects  undertaken  by  villages,  and  to  harmonize  village\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement \n\nConsulting Services \n\nless \n\nto  manage,  coordinate,  and  monitor \n\ninvestments  with  the  Government\u2019s  own  district-level  investments. \nProject  implementation  units  (PIUs)  will  be  established  in  each \nproject  district \nthe \nimplementation of project activities at the district level.

Contracts  for  civil  works  will  be  relatively  simple  for \nrenovation  of  district  offices,  valued  at \nthan  $100,000 \nequivalent,  and  will  be  carried  out  by  the  PIUs  using  local \ncompetitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB. The PIU will also \nbe  responsible  for  procurement  of  office  furniture  through  local \ncompetitive  bidding.  The  PCMU  will  carry  out  procurement  of \nvehicles  and  equipment  estimated  to  cost  more  than  $100,000  but \nless  than  $500,000  using  international  shopping  procedures.  Civil \nincluding \nworks \ntubewell  irrigation  schemes  and  access  roads,  financed  from  the \nvillage  investment  funds  may  be  carried  out  by  communities. \nCommunities  shall  provide  labor  and  appropriate  technologies. \nMaterials  and  services  for  such  civil  works  estimated  to  cost  less \nthan $30,000 equivalent shall be procured through direct purchase.  \n \nA  team  of  24  consultants  for  a  total  input  of  796  person-months  of \nthe  following  international  and  domestic  consulting  services  will  be \nrequired  to  prepare  a  detailed  implementation  plan  and  procedures \nfor  the  Project  during  the  first  year,  and  support  the  subsequent  4-\nyear \nin \nparentheses.

The quality and cost-based selection method \nwill be used for engaging consultants. \n \nA  national  NGO  with  extensive  experience  in  agriculture  and  rural \nlivelihoods  will  be  recruited  by  the  PCMU  through  competitive \nbidding based on eligibility and evaluation criteria established by the \nProject  to  supervise  and  coordinate  local  NGOs  or  community \norganizations  in  implementing  the  village  level  activities  of  the \nFarmer  Empowerment  component.  The  national  NGO  will  identify \nlocal implementing NGOs/community organizations that are capable \nof  participating  in  the  Project  and  meet  criteria  established  by  the \nProject  and  sign  agreements  with  them  to  implement  project \nactivities at the village level.  \n \n31 December 2007 \n\n \nThe  Project  will  benefit  farmers  in  five  districts  with  about  2.75 \nmillion  poor  people  and  overall  poverty  rate  of  66%\u2014almost  twice \nthe  national  average.  The  components  for  farmer  empowerment, \ndevelopment  of  national  and  local  information  resources,  and \nsupport  for  agricultural  innovation  development  and  dissemination \nare expected to benefit these poor people by facilitating agricultural \nand marketing innovations and increasing incomes. The Project will \ntarget  villages  in  which  75%  of  the  households  are  poor.  Typical \nproject  beneficiaries  will  be  poor  farmers  who  have  low  productive \nlandholdings  of  less  than  0.1  hectare  and  who  generally  only \ncultivate  staples.  They  have  an  average  income  of  less  than \nRp1,000,000  per  capita  per  year,  and  often  use  communal \nresources such as the sea and the forest to supplement their income \nwhich  is  often  not  able  to  meet  their  basic  needs.  The  village-level \ninvestments will directly raise the incomes or food security of about \n400,000  poor  households  to  levels  above  the  poverty  line.  Women \nwill directly benefit from active involvement in the planning of village \ninvestments,  capacity  building,  and  targeting  of  village  investments \nespecially to women. \n\n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Poor  Farmers\u2019  Income  Improvement  through  Innovation \nProject. \n \n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nThe Project is based on the findings of Asian Development Bank missions;1 inputs from \n2. \nthe  Government;  the  consultants\u2019  feasibility  study  resulting  from  a  technical  assistance  (TA) \ngrant to the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) Bureau of Planning;2 socioeconomic surveys; an initial \nenvironmental  examination;  and  consultations  with \nlocal  governments, \nbeneficiaries,  private  banks  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  external  funding \nagencies, and consultants. The project framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \n\nregional  and \n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND \n\nA. \n\nSector Description \n\n1. \n\nThe Agriculture Sector \n\nADB\u2019s 2001 country operational strategy (COS), poverty assessment in Indonesia,4 and \n3. \n1998  agriculture  sector  strategy  study  and  update  in  2000,5  provide  the  overall  context  for \nagricultural  and  rural  development  in  Indonesia.  Agriculture  provides  employment  to  a  large \npercentage of Indonesia\u2019s population; substantially meets the country\u2019s food requirements; and \nprovides  most  raw  materials  for  manufacturing,  particularly  for  exports.  However,  agricultural \ngrowth has stagnated and lagged behind growth of the nonagriculture sectors. Policy distortions \nhave constrained growth. While recent initiatives to deregulate the sector have improved sector \nincentives for farmers, (i) inadequate technology development, (ii) deficient physical and social \ninfrastructure, (iii) weak institutions, and (iv) improper incentives continue to restrict the ability of \nfarmers to improve incomes. \n \nConstraints  are  particularly  severe  in  marginal  rainfed  areas,  particularly  in  the  drier \n4. \neastern half of Indonesia. Technology development for these areas has lagged far behind that \nfor well-endowed irrigated areas. Much government agricultural support is planned centrally and \ndoes  not  adequately  address  location-specific,  village-level  causes  of  low  and  unstable  yields \nand  inadequate  market  access.  Inadequate  horizontal  communication  and  vertical  access  to \ninformation reduce the access of farmers to technologies, potential markets for their products, \nmarket prices, input sources and prices, and potential solutions to farm problems. \n \nThe  Government  recently  has  been  taking  steps  to  improve  the  agricultural  policy \n5. \nenvironment  and  to  incorporate  larger  agricultural  and  rural  development  goals  within  a \n                                                 \n1   Loan fact-finding from 23 July to 24 August 2001; a preappraisal mission from 23 October to 14 November 2001; \n\nand an appraisal mission from 1\u201311 April 2002. \n\n2   ADB.  2000.

Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\ndevelopment strategy that has so far concentrated mainly on increasing food production. Many \nreforms  recommended  by  ADB\u2019s  sector  strategy  (footnote  5)  have  been  undertaken. \nGovernment agricultural programs are moving to a bottom-up planning approach but continue to \nbe focused on stimulating production of crops important to food security. The centrally planned \nagricultural  support  system  continues  to  be  aimed  at  rice  and  rice  farmers  on  productive \nirrigated  areas,  mainly  in  western  Indonesia.  Even  with  decentralization,  government  support \nservices  often  cannot  adequately  address  location-specific  constraints  to  improvements  in \nagricultural production and marketing. \n \n6. \nNearly  all  programs  of  international  assistance  to  the  agriculture  sector  are  increasing \nthe  emphasis  on  poverty  and  good  governance;  encouraging  regional  autonomy  and \nenvironmental  protection;  and  supporting  human  development  through  social  sector,  social \ninfrastructure, and social protection efforts. This similarity requires heightened aid coordination \nto  avoid  duplication.  In  preparing  the  Project,  close  coordination  with  agencies  and  countries \nproviding external aid has been maintained to ensure complementarity and compatibility and to \navoid  overlap.  Extensive  discussions  were  held  with  the  World  Bank  in  particular,  to  avoid \noverlap and ensure complementarity with ongoing projects of the World Bank.6 \n \n\n2. \n\nPoverty and Agriculture \n\nAgricultural  growth  and  rural  development  have  always  been  key  to  directly  reducing \n7. \npoverty in Indonesia. The decline in poverty during the 1970s was due in large part to the rapid \ngrowth  in  agricultural  production  and  the  resulting  job  creation  in  off-farm  employment  in \nagricultural processing, transport, and trade. Poverty reduction impacts have been low since the \nmid-1980s  as  agricultural  productivity  stagnated  and  returns  to  farming  declined.  During  the \neconomic crisis, however, agriculture provided a safety net to workers shifting out of declining \nsectors.  Despite  the  declining  importance  of  agriculture  in  the  economy,  about  58%  of \nIndonesia\u2019s poor derive their income primarily from agriculture. About 40% of those engaged in \nagriculture are poor (the highest poverty rate in any economic sector in Indonesia). \n \n8. \nSimilarly,  rural  development\u2014which  is  centered  upon  agriculture\u2014has  important \nimplications  for  poverty  reduction.  Almost  90%  of  the  rural  poor  and  near  poor  derive  their \nincome primarily from agriculture. Quality of life of the rural poor is very low. Eighty percent of \nthe  rural  population  have  less  than  5  years  of  formal  education.  One  third  of  rural  infants  are \nmalnourished,  while  more  than  50%  of  rural  women  suffer  from  micronutrient  deficiencies. \nThese  low  living  standards  prevent  the  rural  poor  from  accessing  the  benefits  of  economic \ngrowth\u2014bad  health  and  illiteracy  renders  them  unsuitable  for  many  forms  of  employment. \nTherefore,  apart  from  the  direct  impact  of  improvements  on  quality  of  life  that  is  normally \nassociated with an increase in incomes, rural development will also increase access of the poor \nto the benefits of economic growth by improving quality of life. \n \n9. \nFor  poor  farmers,  the  constraints  identified  by  ADB\u2019s  COS  manifest  themselves  as \nimpediments  to  adopting  production  and  marketing  innovations  necessary  to  engage  in \ncommercial production and access the benefits of wider economic growth. While technology has \nbeen developed for some upland and rainfed areas, many marginal and rainfed areas typically \ninhabited by poor farmers lag behind well-endowed areas in terms of options for technological \n                                                 \n6   World  Bank  loans:  4007:  Sulawesi  Agriculture  Area  Development  Project,  for  $42.6  million,  approved  in  1996; \n3984:  Nusa  Tenggara  Agricultural  Area  Development  Project,  for  $41.1  million,  approved  in  1996;  3888:  Village \nInfrastructure  Project,  for  $72.5  million,  approved  in  1995;  4330:  Kecamatan  Development  Project  (KDP),  for \n$225.0  million,  approved  in  1998;  and  Loan  46270:  Second  Kecamatan  Development  Project,  for  $421.5  million, \napproved in 2001.  \n\n\f3 \n\ninnovation  available.  Location-specific  public  investments  for  village  roads,  storage,  minor \nirrigation,  soil  and  water  conservation  works,  assessment  and  dissemination  of  technology  in \nvillages, and farmer training have not received adequate support. Information development and \ndissemination  has  often  not  been  designed  for  poor  farmers,  but  rather  aimed  at  promoting \nincreases in food production. This in effect has locked poor farmers into a low-level equilibrium \ntrap preventing them from accessing the benefits of wider economic growth. Consequently, the \nwider  rural  economy  remains  at  a  low  level  of  commercial  activity  restricting  rural  nonfarm \nactivities,  depressing  wages  of  landless  laborers,  and  propagating  rural  poverty.  Detailed \nstudies  undertaken  as  part  of  the  feasibility  study  for  the  Project  identified  several  village \ninvestments that can allow farmers to adopt innovative production and marketing methods, and \nbegin commercial production. \n \nB. \n\nLessons Learned \n\nADB\u2019s  country  synthesis  of  lessons  learned  from  projects  in  Indonesia7  and  sector \n10. \nsynthesis  of  lessons  learned  from  projects  under  agriculture  and  natural  resources8  are \nparticularly relevant for the Project. ADB\u2019s agriculture projects in Indonesia have not performed \nas  well  as  projects  in  many  other  sectors  because  they  are  complex  and  target  diverse \nenvironments.  Overly  rigid  implementing  arrangements  and  design  features  often  impede \nproject  success  because  they  do  not  allow  the  flexibility  to  adjust  to  evolving  economic, \ntechnical,  and  social  circumstances  and  local  conditions.  Well-defined  project  formats  and \nprocedures  ensure  acceptable  standards  for  procurement,  financial  management,  and  project \nquality.  Implementation  arrangements  must  be  based  on  the  realistic  capacities  of  sector \ninstitutions if project benefits are to be sustained beyond project completion because no means \nremain to replicate and sustain project activities. \n \n11. \nCommunity participation improves project quality, targeting, and sustainability, but has to \nbe well supported through training and technical support. Community control over project funds \ninduces communities to allocate resources according to priorities and potential, but the transfer \nof  funds  to  communities  without  social  preparation  has  led  to  unsatisfactory  results.9 \nCommunities  cannot  be  left  to  their  own  resources  to  design  and  implement  projects.  Skilled \ntechnical  and  social  facilitation  and  backstopping  from  external  sources  is  crucial  for  the \nsuccess  of  community  projects.  Experience  has  also  shown  that  group  mobilization  is  most \neffective  if  a  member  of  the  local  community  facilitates  it,  and  that  the  participation  of  women \nincreases  project  effectiveness  and  sustainability.  NGOs  and  community  organizations  have \nsuccessfully  trained  community-based  organizations  in  fund  management,  microenterprise \nmanagement,  participatory  monitoring  and  evaluation,  marketing,  and  technology  adoption. \nContractor management in Indonesia is poor and complaints are rarely addressed. This in turn \nadversely  impacts  on  project  sustainability  and  ownership  by  beneficiaries.  This  can  be \nremedied  by  making  contractors  directly  accountable  to  end  users.  Small-scale  infrastructure \n\n                                                 \n7   Country  Synthesis:  Lessons  Learned  for  Projects  in  Indonesia.

Since project areas do not all have such institutions, the Project does not include a \ncredit  component.  Funds  are  to  be  used  only  for  public  investments  and  thus  are  transferred  to  communities  as \ngrants. Local or regional authorities or suitable NGOs do not possess lending experience but have been shown to \nbe  able  to  provide  appropriate  technical  and  social  inputs  in  making  communities  creditworthy.  The  Project  will \nprepare  communities  to  receive  funds  and  link  these  communities  with  sound  financial  intermediaries  where \navailable. \n\n\f4 \n\nprojects using village-based planning and community labor have resulted in substantial savings \nas compared with central planning and implementation. \n \nC. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy \n\n12. \nThe  Project  directly  addresses  the  focal  points  of  ADB\u2019s  COS,  which  include  creating \nand  strengthening  basic  institutions;  improving  regional  equity,  especially  targeting  rural  areas \nand  less-developed  islands;  undertaking  human  and  social  development;  and  enhancing  the \nrole of women.10 The COS emphasizes participatory project design and administration, which is \nat  the  core  of  the  proposed  Project.  The  COS  highlights  the  benefits  of  diverse  and  stable \ncropping systems, the development of rural infrastructure, and access to finance\u2014all expected \nfrom  the  Project.  The  Project  is  in  line  with  the  COS  as  it  supports  a  demand  driven  and \nparticipatory process for agricultural innovation, and a transparent and inclusive implementation \napproach.  The  process  to  be  developed  by  the  Project  is  in  itself  a  major  output  that  meets \nADB\u2019s development priorities. \n \nD. \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\n13. \nADB\u2019s  agriculture  sector  strategy  study  (footnote  5)  provided  the  basis  for  a  dialogue \nwith  the  Government  on  levies  on  agricultural  commodities,  value-added  tax  on  agribusiness, \nand decentralization of agriculture support services. Other ongoing programs are continuing the \ndialogue  and  a  favorable  resolution  will  enhance  project  benefits.11  District  coordination \ncommittees  (DCCs)  and  project  intervillage  forums  (PIVFs),  proposed  through  the  Project,  will \nimprove  communication  between  farmers  and  decentralized  agricultural  support  services.  The \nProject  will  reorient  attention  to  district  roads,  which  are  an  important  determinant  of  rural \ndevelopment. Since the Asian financial crisis, budgetary constraints have caused district roads \nto  fall  into  disrepair.  District  governments  have  agreed  to  prioritize  their  road  rehabilitation \nactivities so that they complement project investments. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n1. \n\nProject Rationale \n\n14. \nRecently  improved  terms  of  trade,  depreciated  currency,  deregulation,  and  farmer-\nsupport programs initiated after the financial crisis offer poor farmers in Indonesia an opportunity \nto  improve  incomes  through  the  adoption  of  innovative  production  and  marketing  methods. \nHowever, they lack the means to do so. While the Government is taking steps to fill the gaps in \nproviding  public  goods  support  for  agriculture,  and  increasingly  for  nonrice  crops,  additional \nsupport  is  needed  to  target  village-level  public  investments  to  the  needs  of  poor  farmers,  to \nincrease the availability of technologies needed by poor farmers, and to increase the access of \npoor farmers to information to support agricultural production and marketing innovations.  \n \nSystems of planning, delivering, and managing village-level public investments are key \n15. \nto  effective  targeting.  Government  planning  through  its  agencies  and  delivery  by  outside \n\n                                                 \n10  The  first  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP),  currently  being  prepared,  includes  a  much  more  comprehensive \n\ndiscussion of sector issues, priorities, and ADB\u2019s strategy than is available in the COS. \n\n11 For example, the decentralization group of the Consultative Group for Indonesia is reviewing the illegal collection of \nroadside  levies  as  part  of  improving  governance  in  local  government.  The  proposed  agriculture  and  rural \ndevelopment sector strategy study will look into the impact of value-added tax on agribusiness. \n\n\f5 \n\ncontractors  is  not  an  efficient  means  of  targeting  village-level  public  investments  to  location- \nspecific  problems.12  An  efficient  alternative,  which  has  been  shown  to  work  in  other \ndevelopment  projects  (most  notably  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Kecamatan  Development  Project \n(footnote 6) and ADB\u2019s TA for Participatory Approaches to Sustainable Income Generation13) is \nto  empower  farmers  themselves  to  undertake  simple  village  investments\u2014develop  their \ncapacity  to  do  so,  develop  the  proper  institutions  to  support  them,  and  give  them  control  over \nthe funds required to implement the investments. \n \nInnovation  requires  a  sound  technological  base  and  a  vibrant  information  environment. \n16. \nBecause  marginal  rainfed  areas  typically  inhabited  by  poor  farmers  had  low  priority  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s food-security-centered development program, information on the natural base of \nthese  areas  has  often  been  lacking,  agricultural  research  for  these  areas  has  received  less \nsupport than that for well-endowed irrigated areas, and information dissemination has not been \ntargeted  to  them.  Therefore,  the  technological  base  for  farmer  innovation  in  marginal  rainfed \nareas  is  not  well  developed  and  adequate  information  on  available  technologies,  potential \nmarkets for products, market prices, input sources and prices, and potential solutions to farm-\nlevel problems is often lacking. \n \n17. \nThe  Project  is  aimed  at  promoting  innovation  development  and  adoption  by  poor \nfarmers. The Project recognizes that if poor farmers are empowered to undertake simple village-\nlevel  investments,  support  is  provided  for  the  development  of  proper  technologies  for  rainfed \nareas,  and  farmers  have  access  to  relevant  information,  poor  farmers  will  be  able  to  adopt \ninnovative production and marketing methods and break out of their low-level equilibrium trap. \n \n\n2. \n\nCoordination with other ADB Projects \n\n18. \nThe Project dovetails with ADB\u2019s initiatives to reduce rural poverty in Indonesia. Through \nthe  Participatory  Development  of  Agricultural  Technology  Project  (PAATP),  ADB  is  increasing \ncapacity for adaptive research in response to farmer needs.14 The proposed Project will better \ninterface  this  capacity  with  farmer  needs  and  increase  the  participation  of  farmers  in  adaptive \nresearch, thus enhancing the benefits of the PAATP. \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  focus  on  agriculture  differs  from  the  more  general  rural  development \n19. \napproach  of  ADB\u2019s  Community  Empowerment  for  Rural  Development  Project,  which  develops \naccess  to  efficient  local  government,  rural  finance,  and  markets.15  While  the  Community \nEmpowerment  for  Rural  Development  Project  will  make  government  planning  agencies  more \n\n                                                 \n12 Government planning and implementing agencies necessarily operate at an aggregated level and do not have the \nresources  to  plan  and  implement  with  the  detail  required  for  village-level  investments.  Nor  is  it  efficient  for \ngovernment  agencies  to  plan  and  implement  with  such  a  level  of  detail.  For  village-level  investments,  the \ninformation costs of incorporating the required information into a top-down planning model and then responding to \nlocation-specific  needs  are  very  high.  Such  investments  undertaken  by  government  agencies  often  fail  to \nincorporate  the  requisite  degree  of  design  detail,  are  not  adequately  flexible  to  adapt  to  unexpected  information \ndiscovered  during  implementation,  and  therefore  often  fail  to  meet  the  requirements  of  farmers.  Further,  past \nexperience  has  shown  that  farmers  themselves  can  efficiently  undertake  the  implementation  of  the  public \ninvestments. Also, lessons from previous projects show that contractor management in Indonesia has been poor \nand that small-scale village-level projects using community labor inputs can be implemented at substantial savings \nas compared with implementation by national agencies or outside contractors. \n\n13  ADB.  1999.

Manila. \n\n\f6 \n\nresponsive to the demands of local communities, the proposed Project will enhance the benefits \nof this responsiveness by helping poor farmers to better express their needs.  \n \n20. \nThe  Project  will  not  provide  credit  to  farmers.  It  will  however  develop  capacity  at  the \nvillage  level  for  fund  management  and  investment  identification,  and  establish  institutions  to \ndovetail  with  a  proposed  project  for  rural  microfinance.16  More  generally,  since  the  Project  will \nmake poor villagers viable recipients of the microfinance funds with minimum additional social \npreparation, villagers will also be able to access funds from established financial intermediaries \nsuch  as  Bank  Rakyat  Indonesia.  The  proposed  Project  will  also  link  up  with  the  proposed \nParticipatory  Irrigation  Sector  Project.17  When  the  capacity  to  identify  and  implement  village-\nlevel  irrigation  projects  has  been  developed,  farmer  groups  will  be  able  to  access  funds  to  be \nprovided by the proposed irrigation project.18 \n \n21. \nThe foundation for participatory village-level planning and implementation has been laid \nby previous ADB projects. The advisory TA for Participatory Approaches to Sustainable Income \nGeneration (footnote 13) developed a methodology for the development of household business \nplans.  This  methodology  will  be  used  with  modifications  in  the  Project.  The  Integrated  Pest \nManagement  for  Smallholder  Estate  Crops  Project  has  established  the  capacity  within  some \nfarmer groups to address pest problems.19 This capacity can be developed with modifications as \nnecessary in project locations. The Rural Income Generation Project has established a method \nof  village-level  fund  management  through  village  finance  units.20  This  method  of  village-level \nfund management can now be applied to project areas. \n \nB. \n \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n1. \n\nObjectives \n\n \n22. \nThe  long-term  development  goal  is  increased  innovation  in  agricultural  production  and \nmarketing  by  poor  farmers.  The  immediate  project  objectives  are  (i)  improved  targeting  of \nvillage-level public investments to location-specific needs of agricultural and rural development, \n(ii)  increased  access  of  poor  farmers  to  information,  and  (iii)  a  reorientation  of  agricultural \nresearch to marginal rainfed areas. \n \n\n2. \n\nScope \n\nThe  Project  will  comprise \n\n23. \nfarmer  empowerment,  \n(ii)  development  of  national  and  local  agricultural  information  resources,  (iii)  support  for \nagricultural  innovation  development  and  dissemination,  and  (iv)  project  management.  All \ncomponents  are  directed  to  the  overall  objective  of  increased  innovation  and  are  described  in \nAppendix  2.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years  in  about  1,000  villages  in  the  five \n\nfour  components: \n\n(i)  poor \n\n                                                 \n16 Proposed INO: Rural Microfinance Project, for $150 million, for approval in 2003. \n17 Proposed INO: Participatory Irrigation Sector Project, for $100 million, for approval in 2002. \n18  Since  the  Project  will  develop  the  capacity  among  farmer  groups  to  identify  and  implement  public  investments, \nfarmer groups are expected to be able to access more mainstream sources of funds for identified investments after \nthe completion of the Project and thereby sustain project benefits. Moreover, if farmers recognize the value of NGO \nassistance  in  these  activities,  they  will  pay  for  the  services  of  NGOs  after  project  completion.  Examples  of  such \nsustained payments beyond project completion are available from other projects and most notably from the ADB \nsupported Participatory Approaches to Sustainable Income Generation Project (footnote 13). \n\n19 ADB. 1996.

This  will  involve \nthree  subcomponents:  (i)  mobilization  of  farmer  groups  and  village  planning,  (ii)  institutional \ndevelopment, and (iii) village-level public investments. \n \n25. \nThe  Project  will  engage  local  NGOs  (or  community  organizations)  with  ongoing \ncommunity partnerships to work through elected facilitators from the village to mobilize farmer \ngroups.  Group  formation  will  be  based  on  village  social  assessments  and  ensure  that  socially \ndisadvantaged  farmers  will  be  able  to  participate  in  decision  making.  The  NGOs/community \norganizations  will  train  and  support  the  facilitators,  and  help  establish  links  between  farmer \ngroups and government and private agencies that can support farmers. These design features \nare intended to maximize beneficiary participation, social preparation, local facilitation, technical \nbackstopping,  and  the  involvement  of  NGOs  and  community  organizations,  all  of  which  have \ncontributed to the success of similar projects. \n \nThe  Project  will  establish,  develop  capacity,  and  support  the  operations  of  three \n26. \ninstitutions:  village  project  investment  committees  (VPICs),  PIVFs,  and  DCCs.  The  three \ninstitutions  will  work  together  to  consolidate,  scrutinize,  approve,  support,  implement,  and \nmonitor investments proposed by farmer groups. These institutions mirror institutions prescribed \nby the law on decentralization to increase project sustainability and effectiveness. \n \n27. \nThe  Project  will  support  participatory  planning  in  eligible  villages  to  identify  innovations \nand  public  investments  necessary  for  their  adoption.  The  Project  will  support  PIVFs  in  their \nevaluation of village investments. The Project will provide grants of a maximum of $30,000 per \nvillage  in  the  form  of  village  investment  funds  administered  by  VPICs  to  implement  approved \ninvestments.21  The  VPICs  will  be  assisted  by  NGOs/community  organizations,  development \npartners  with  whom  the  VPICs  have  developed  investment  proposals,  the  DCC,  and \ngovernment  agencies  delegated  by  the  bupati.  Funds  will  not  be  disbursed  for  private \ninvestments  or  to  finance  operating  costs  such  as  input  purchase.  Eligibility  criteria  for  village \ninvestments are provided in Appendix 3. Investments will be for public goods shown to promote \ninnovations  in  agricultural  production  or  marketing.  Other  projects  have  shown  the  benefits  of \nincreasing  the  community  participation  in  investment  design,  implementation,  and  monitoring \nand delegating responsibility for fund management and contractor supervision to end users. \n \n\nb. \n\nDevelopment of National and Local Agricultural Information \nResources \n\n28. \nCapacity-building activities of the Project will address village problems, but realization of \nhigher  incomes  and  poverty  reduction  requires  a  favorable  broader  context  within  which  poor \n\n                                                 \n21  The  estimate  of  $30,000  per  village  is  based  upon  investment  plans  developed  by  villages  during  the  feasibility \nstudy  for  the  Project.  Construction  or  repair  of  farm-to-market  roads  and  irrigation  systems  were  by  far  the  most \nexpensive  and  most  common  investment  proposed.  These  cost  between  $12,000  and  $50,000.  These  were \nfollowed  by  proposals  for  the  establishment  of  marketing  associations  at  costs  ranging  from  $5000\u2013$15,000; \ntraining  in  pest  management  ($1,900  to  $7,000);  and  postharvest  facilities\u2014storage,  drying  facilities,  primary \nprocessing  ($500\u2013$  2,000).  Investment  proposals  are  detailed  in  a  supplementary  appendix  and  indicative  cost \nestimates and financial analyses for investments are provided. \n\n\f8 \n\nfarmers  can  identify  and  exploit  opportunities  for  innovation.  This  component  will  develop \ninformation resources of importance to poor farmers and facilitate poor farmers\u2019 access to them. \nBy accessing these resources, farmers will be able to better align production with comparative \nadvantage, improve access to agricultural input and output markets, and improve their incomes. \nSpecifically,  the  Project  will  support  staffing,  operational  costs,  equipment,  and  consultant \nsupport to (i) upgrade the agricultural market information system of MOA to expand its coverage \nand scope, and to increase the frequency of its updates; (ii) develop a national farming web site \nthat will become a source of information and eventually a platform for agricultural trade; and (iii) \ndevelop information centers at the district agriculture offices that will be linked to the information \nnetwork  of  MOA  and  also  will  disseminate  information  through  traditional  media.  This \ncomponent  builds  upon  existing  MOA  activities  with  minimal  incremental  demands  on  scarce \ngovernment resources to increase the chance of sustainability and ownership. The potential for \nprivate sector participation in the operation of the farming web site has been explored and will \nbe  further  pursued  by  MOA.  The  district  information  centers  will  be  partly  self-sustaining  after \nthe Project because they will charge for services. \n \n\nc. \n\nSupport for Agricultural Innovation Development and Dissemination \n\n29. \nIn  addition  to  the  grass-root  activities  at  the  core  of  the  Project,  upstream  initiatives  to \ndevelop  innovations  for  poor  farmers  and  their  dissemination  to  farmers  will  enhance  the \neffectiveness of village investments and lay the long-term foundation for improving in incomes of \npoor  farmers.  Upstream  research  programs  for  marginal  rainfed  areas  need  to  be  developed \nafter careful needs assessments and thereafter funded. The private sector is rarely interested in \nagricultural  research  for  marginal  areas  because  although  returns  to  this  research  in  terms  of \nincome and welfare improvements are high, beneficiaries are often not able to pay for research \nand private companies are not able to recover research costs. \n \n30. \nThe  Government  is  trying  to  reorient  its  upstream  technology  development  activities  to \nthe needs of poor farmers in marginal rainfed areas. This agricultural innovation component will \nassist  the  Government  by  supporting  staffing,  operational  costs,  civil  works,  equipment,  and \nconsulting services (i) to develop human resources, basic knowledge, and support infrastructure \nwithin  Agency  for  Agricultural  Research  and  Development  (AARD)  of  MOA,  (ii)  to  support \nnational  agricultural  research  institutes  to  develop  agricultural  innovations  relevant  to  project \nareas (and for marginal rainfed agriculture in general), and (iii) to develop outreach programs to \ninform  farmers  of  potential  innovations  to  improve  agricultural  production.  The  component  will \nalso establish a fund to be administered by the provincial assessment institutes for agricultural \ntechnology  (BPTPs)  in  each  province  that  contains  a  project  district.  This  fund  will  support \ninitiatives  of  national  and  local  universities,  researchers,  field  technicians,  extension  workers, \nthe  private  sector,  NGOs,  and  other  agencies  to  develop  innovations  for  poor  farmers  in  the \ntarget area. The fund will also support activities to promote information exchange and capacity \nbuilding  among  DCC  members,  district  government  staff,  and  farmers  from  project  as  well  as \nnonparticipating villages. \n \n\nd. \n\nProject Management \n\n31. \nThe  Project  will  finance  (i)  operational  costs  of  the  national  steering  committee  (NSC); \n(ii)  staffing,  operational  costs,  equipment,  minor  civil  works,  and  consultant  support  for  a \nnational  project  coordination  and  monitoring  unit  (PCMU);  (iii)  support  to  develop  a  project \nperformance management system (PPMS); (iv) costs, including costs of minor civil works, of the \nproject  implementation  units  (PIUs);  (v)  costs  of  external  audits  and  independent  reviews  of \nNGOs  and  village  implementation  bodies;  and  (vi)  costs  of  the  Executing  Agency\u2019s  project \n\n\f9 \n\ncompletion report. District governments will support the operational and other costs of the DCCs \nand PIVFs beyond project completion. \n \n\n3. \n\nPoverty Focus \n\n32. \nSelection  of  the  project  area  is  primarily  motivated  by  poverty  considerations  and  the \nimportance of agriculture to the incomes of the poor. Three of the 5 project districts are among \nIndonesia\u2019s  20  poorest  districts  of  20  provinces  screened.22  For  the  five  project  districts,  the \noverall poverty rate is about 66% according to the village potential data, which uses the Family \nPlanning Agency\u2019s household surveys.23 This poverty rate is almost twice the national average \nbased on these data. More than 2.75 million poor people live in the project districts. \n \nPoverty  targeting  of  poor  farmers  will  be  strengthened  beyond  the  targeting  of  poor \n33. \ndistricts  because  investments  will  be  targeted  to  poorer  villages  within  these  poor  districts. \nVillages within the target districts have been ranked according to their poverty incidence based \nupon the village potential data. Only villages with more than 40% of households classified as not \nyet  prosperous  or  minimally  prosperous  according  to  these  data  will  be  eligible  for  project \nsupport.24  Further,  the  ranked  list  of  eligible  villages  will  be  provided  to  district  governments, \nwhich  will  prioritize  villages  after  giving  due  consideration  to  their  poverty  ranking  and  their \ndependence  on  agriculture  (but  also  taking  into  account  their  own  development  and  poverty \nreduction  priorities).  The  top  half  of  prioritized  villages  in  a  district  will  be  eligible  to  submit \ninvestment proposals during year 1 of implementation in a district, and all villages will be eligible \nduring year 2, thereby according an advantage to poorer villages. \n \nThe village participatory process has been designed to ensure that project benefits are \n34. \ndirected  primarily  to  the  poor  within  villages  without  causing  social  tensions.  Groups  will  be \nformed  only  after  a  social  assessment  by  the  NGOs/community  organizations  has  determined \nthe optimal means of group formation to benefit poor farmers.25 Since the core of the Project is \nthe development of the participatory process, investment selection criteria are primarily related \nto the process itself and also aim to ensure that investments meet project objectives.26 \n \n \n\n                                                 \n22 Urban  provinces,  provinces  with  widespread  civil  disorder,  and  provinces  outside  ADB\u2019s  proposed  geographic \n\nfocus were excluded. Two districts were selected to maintain continuity with previous ADB assistance. \n\n23  Potensi  desa/kelurahan,  or  village  potential.  This  is  a  household  survey  attached  to  and  conducted  during  every \n\ntype of census: agricultural, economic, and population.  \n\n24  The  Family  Planning  Agency  uses  a  simple  screening  device  to  categorize  households  as  not  yet  prosperous, \nminimally prosperous, or higher (prosperous). Households are classified as not yet prosperous if they fail to meet \nany of the following conditions: (1) in general, family members are able to eat two meals a day; (2) a minimum of \ntwo  different  sets  of  clothes  for  home/work;  or  (3)  house  floor  made  of  earth.  Households  are  classified  as \nminimally  prosperous  if  they  meet  all  of  the  above  conditions  but  fail  to  fulfill  any  of  the  following  conditions:  (1) \nonce in a week, able to eat meat or egg or fish, (2) a new set of clothes once a year, (3) floor space less than 8 \nsquare meters per family member. \n\n25 To prevent social tensions, the process will also ensure that nonpoor stakeholders with characteristics such as (i) \ndependence on the Project, (ii) interest in the outcome of the Project, (iii) ability to influence the Project, (iv) ability \nto  be  affected  by  the  Project,  and  (v)  ability  to  work  against  the  Project  are  given  adequate  consideration \nthroughout  the  process  of  development  of  the  village  investment  plans.  Sometimes,  homogenous  farmer  groups \nwill  be  necessary  to  ensure  that  the  needs  of  disadvantaged  groups  are  adequately  addressed.  In  other  areas, \nmore heterogeneous groups will be appropriate. \n\n26 Since the Project is centered on promoting innovations in agricultural production or marketing, it will directly benefit \nthose  engaged  in  agricultural  activities,  including  those  landless  poor  engaged  in  nonfarm  agricultural  activities \nsuch as livestock rearing, fisheries, postharvest activities, and agricultural support services. The Project will benefit \nlandless farm laborers indirectly through the wider agricultural growth that it will engender. \n\n\f10 \n\n \n \nItem \nA.  Base Costs \n\nCost Estimates \n\nC. \n \n35. \nThe cost of the Project is estimated at $70.92 million equivalent, including physical and \nprice  contingencies,  interest  during  construction,  taxes,  and  duties.  Of  the  total  cost,  $15.28 \nmillion or 21% is the foreign exchange cost and $55.64 million equivalent is the local currency \ncost. A summary of the cost estimates is in Table 1.

The \n36. \nGovernment\u2019s  resources  are  strained  by  the  requirements  of  macroeconomic  stabilization, \ncorporate  sector  restructuring,  bank  recapitalization,  and  augmentation  of  resources  for  social \nsafety  nets.  In  view  of  these  constraints,  other  funding  agencies  such  as  the  World  Bank  and \nJapan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  have  relaxed  their  cost-sharing  requirements  for \nIndonesia. The Project is classified as a core-poverty intervention and will not generate directly \ntaxable revenues. Under these circumstances, it is proposed that ADB\u2019s 60% cost-sharing limit \nfor project financing be relaxed. This proposal is in accordance with the graduation policy, which \nallows ADB financing to exceed the country cost-sharing limit under exceptional circumstances \nand where justified on country and project grounds.27 The Government has requested that ADB \nfinance79% of the total project cost. \n \nIt is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $56 million from its Special Funds resources. \n37. \nThe  loan  will  have  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  with  an  interest \ncharge  of  1%  per  year  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  year  during  the  remaining  term. \nADB  will  finance  100%  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost  of  the  Project  and  73%  of  the  local  cost. \nThe  Government  will  finance  about  $7.19  million  equivalent  and  district  governments  about \n$0.99 million equivalent in local costs. Farmers will provide about $6.75 million equivalent in in-\nkind  contributions.  The  financing  plan  is  summarized  in  Table  2,  with  details  provided  in \nAppendix 4. The Government will bear the foreign exchange risk. \n \n \n                                                 \n27  ADB. 1998. Graduation Policy.

AARD will be responsible for \noverall  coordination  of  project  implementation  and  for  implementing  the  Development  of \nNational and Local Information Resources and Support for Agricultural Innovation Development \nand Dissemination components. \n \n39. \nAARD  is  responsible  for  agricultural  research  and  development  in  Indonesia.  AARD  is \none  of  the  few  MOA  agencies  that  maintain  line  agencies  at  the  provincial  level.  The  AARD \nsecretariat  is  responsible  for  finance,  administration,  organization,  procedures,  and  human \nresource development. A number of centers provide general backstopping to the AARD system. \nAARD  has  been  satisfactorily  implementing  projects  for  international  organizations,  and  is \nsatisfactorily  implementing  ADB\u2019s  PAATP.  Particularly  relevant  to  the  Project,  the  PAATP  has \ndeveloped the capacity within AARD\u2019s BPTPs to undertake participatory research. Procedures \nfor  farmer  interaction  have  been  established.  The  BPTPs  are  now  ready  to  respond  to  more \norganized expression of farmer demand and to provide guidance to district governments in their \nefforts  to  organize  agriculture  development  programs  at  the  district  level.  Project  reporting \nprocedures  have  been  established  within  AARD  for  the  PAATP,  and  AARD  staff  are  familiar \nwith  ADB  procedures  and  guidelines.  ADB  has  evaluated  AARD\u2019s  implementation  of  research \nand development components as satisfactory in two ADB-financed integrated area development \nprojects. AARD\u2019s performance in implementing World Bank projects has been evaluated as fully \nsatisfactory. \n \n40.  Whereas  earlier,  AARD  concentrated  on  production  innovations,  it  has  recently  started \nthe  development  of \npaying  greater  attention \nagribusiness, and larger rural development activities. Through applied economic research by its \nCenter  for  Agro  Socioeconomic  Research  and  Development  and  the  catalytic  role  of  BPTPs, \nAARD  has  been  encouraging  the  adoption  of  innovative  agricultural  production  and  marketing \nmethods as part of larger rural development initiatives. Through its BPTPs, AARD is particularly \nsuited  to  playing  the  advisory  and  coordinating  role  that  is  required  for  the  Project  by  a \ngovernment agency. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nin  agricultural  marketing, \n\ninnovations \n\nto \n\n1. \n\nThe Implementing Agencies  \n\n41. \nThe  implementing  agencies  for  the  Poor  Farmer  Empowerment  component  will  be  the \noffices of the district bupatis in the project districts. A national NGO, contracted by MOA, will be \nresponsible  for  supervising  and  coordinating  local  NGOs  or  community  organizations  in \n\n\f12 \n\nimplementing  the  village  activities  of  the  Farmer  Empowerment  component.  The  VPICs  will \nimplement village-level investments. \n \n42. \nBefore decentralization, separate district services (dinas) were provided for food crops, \nlivestock, estate crops, fisheries, and forestry. As a result of decentralization, district agricultural \nservices  have  been  restructured.  In  many  cases,  the  services  have  combined  two  or  three \nformer  services.  No  common  pattern  is  followed  across  districts.  However,  in  all  cases,  the \nservices  ultimately  report  to  the  office  of  the  district  bupati.  Bupatis,  therefore,  are  in  the  best \nposition to implement the Project at the district level. Detailed institutional analyses of the district \nagricultural  services  for  target  districts  were  conducted  during  the  feasibility  study.  This \ninstitutional  analysis  demonstrates  a  strong  capacity  among  district  agencies  to  perform  the \ncoordinating, backstopping, and technical advisory roles that are key to project success. District \nbupatis  have  been  provided  with  results  of  the  institutional  analysis  and  will  assign \nresponsibilities  based  upon  this  analysis  and  their  own  assessments  of  the  capacities  of  the \ndistrict services. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Management and Coordination \n\n43. \nAn organization chart for project implementation is in Appendix 5. The proposed village, \nsubdistrict,  and  district  bodies  parallel  those  required  to  be  organized  according  to  the \nGovernment\u2019s  decentralization  laws.  This  will  ensure  sustainability  and  avoid  the  development \nof a project-specific management structure. Detailed project implementation arrangements are \ndescribed  in  Appendix  6.  Major  responsibilities  and  roles  of  the  participating  agencies  and \norganizations are outlined below. \n \n\na. \n\nNational Steering Committee \n\n44. \nThe  Government  will  establish  an  NSC  comprised  of  representatives  of  agencies  of \nMOA,  National  Development  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS),  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  and \nother  stakeholders  to  oversee  project  implementation  and  provide  policy  guidance  on \ncoordinating project implementation. The NSC will play a monitoring and supervisory role in the \nProject.  In  particular,  the  NSC  will  coordinate  project  implementation  roles  across  government \nagencies as required and facilitate liaison between central and district government agencies. \n \n\nb. \n\nProject Coordination and Monitoring Unit \n\nAARD  will  establish  a  PCMU  headed  by  a  project  coordinator.  The  PCMU  will  prepare \n45. \nproject  implementation  during  year  1  of  the  Project,  and  then  assist  the  NSC  through \nimplementation by serving as its secretariat. The project coordinator will be assisted by AARD \nstaff assigned full-time to the PCMU and consultants supported by the Project. The PCMU will \nensure  that  implementation  structures  are  in  place  before  implementation;  establish  formats, \nprocedures,  and  guidelines  for  implementation;  and  establish  the  PPMS.  The  PCMU  will  be \nresponsible  for  implementing  the  Development  of  National  and  Local  Information  Resources, \nSupport  for  Agricultural  Innovation  Development  and  Dissemination,  and  Project  Management \ncomponents.  The  PCMU  will  prepare  annual  work  plans,  conduct  monitoring  and  evaluation, \ncoordinate  the  recruitment  of  consultants  and  NGOs  and  procurement,  ensure  that  all \nestablished procedures and guidelines are followed, establish a project web site and update it \nwith  information  on  project  progress,  and  provide  all  required  reports  and  communications  to \nADB. \n \n\n\f13 \n\nc. \n\nDistrict Coordination Committees \n\nlocal  parliament, \n\ninclude  representatives  of \n\nA DCC will be chaired and convened by the bupati in each project district. Members of \n46. \nthe  DCC  will \nlocal  NGOs/community \nthe \norganizations, the regional advisory committee (established under PAATP); and staff of relevant \ndistrict  government  services  officially  assigned  by  the  bupati.  The  DCC  will  prioritize  target \nvillages within the district, and under the direction of the bupati, coordinate project activities with \nthe development activities of the district government, particularly the roads rehabilitation plan of \nthe  district  and  the  district  budget  allocation.  The  DCC  will  be  a  forum  through  which  farmer \ngroups  establish  partnerships  with  agencies  that  can  support  their  innovation.  The  DCC  will \nmonitor project implementation in the district and address problems as necessary. \n \n\nd. \n\nProject Implementation Unit  \n\n47. \nPIUs  will be established in  each project district to manage, coordinate and monitor the \nimplementation of project activities at the district level. The bupati will appoint a project manager \nto head the PIU and assign adequate staff full-time to the PIU. The PIU will support the PCMU \nin project preparation at the district level. It will prepare annual work plans and budgets for the \ndistricts and serve as the secretariat for the DCC and the PIVFs. The bupati will assign technical \nstaff from the relevant district government agencies to the PIU to act as a technical committee \nthat can be consulted by the PIVF as necessary to validate the technical feasibility of proposed \ninvestments. The PIU will be responsible for compiling required information from the district and \nreporting  to  the  PCMU.  It  will  regularly  report  to  the  DCC  on  subdistrict  activities  and  plans \napproved. The PIU will be responsible for the funds disbursement process at the district level. It \nwill  be  the  primary  intermediary  between  the  DCC,  PCMU,  regional  advisory  committee,  and \nother agencies. The PIU will undertake procurement of minor civil works and equipment needed \nfor  project  management.  It  will  monitor  physical  and  financial  progress;  prepare  relevant \nprogress reports to the DCC, and PCMU; and maintain consolidated project accounts. \n \n\ne. \n\nProject Intervillage Forum \n\n48. \nPIVFs  will  be  established  at  the  subdistrict  level.  Members  of  the  PIVF  will  be  elected \nheads  of  the  VPIC  and  elected  woman  facilitators  from  each  village  in  the  subdistrict.  In \naddition,  representatives  of  NGOs/community  organizations  and  facilitators  working  in  the \nvillages,  a  representative  of  the  agricultural  subdistrict  services  office,  and  extension  workers \nwill be invited to attend meetings of the PIVF as observers and advisers. The PIVF will be the \nsole  village  investment  approval  body.  It  will  also  be  responsible  for  monitoring  the  approved \nvillage  investments.  After  project  completion,  the  PIVF  will  be  supported  by  the  district \ngovernment.  The  PIVF  will  ensure  that  guidelines  are  followed  in  the  preparation  of  village \ninvestments  and  that  the  proposed  investments  are  socially,  economically,  technically,  and \nenvironmentally sound. The PIVF will prepare a detailed annual plan and cash flow for approved \nand forecast investments. It will monitor implementation progress, review financial management, \ndevelop specific action plans for resolving problems, and report on project progress to the DCC \nthrough the PIU. \n \n\nf. \n\nVillage Project Investment Committee \n\n49. \nA  five-member  VPIC  will  be  elected  in  every  project  village  to  validate  and  consolidate \ninvestments  proposed  by  farmer  groups,  present  these  at  PIVF  meetings,  mediate  to  resolve \ndisputes,  and  implement  village  investments.  The  VPIC  will  establish  and  operate  a  bank \naccount  to  manage  funds  for  investments  approved  by  the  PIVF  and  disburse  funds  for \n\n\f14 \n\napproved investments. The VPIC will ensure that implementation is in line with proposals and in \naccordance  with  guidelines.  Implementation  progress  and  disbursements  will  be  posted  on  a \nvillage bulletin board. The VPIC will maintain accounts accessible to the public. \n \n\n3. \n\nThe Participation of NGOs  \n\n50. \nA  national  NGO  with  extensive  experience  in  agriculture  and  rural  livelihoods  will  be \nrecruited  by  the  PCMU  through  competitive  bidding  based  on  eligibility  and  evaluation  criteria \nestablished  by  the  Project.  Local  NGOs/community  organizations,  through  a  series  of \nconsultations  during  the  first  year  of  the  Project,  will  identify  a  set  of  NGOs/community \norganizations that are capable of participating in the Project and meet criteria established by the \nProject.  The  national  NGO  will  work  with \nimplementing \nNGOs/community organizations from this identified set and sign implementation arrangements \nwith them to implement project activities at the village level. The national NGO will train the local \nNGOs/community organizations, supervise and monitor implementation at the village level, and \nprovide technical backstopping as necessary. Eligibility criteria for NGO/community organization \nselection are in Appendix 7. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 8. Eligibility criteria and \nterms  of  reference  were  developed  after  extensive  consultations  with  NGOs,  government \nagencies, and with reference to ADB\u2019s Study of the Role of NGOs in ADB Projects.28 \n \n\nthe  PCMU \n\nto  select \n\nlocal \n\n4. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n51. \nProject  implementation  will  take  5  years.  Appendix  9  provides  the  schedule  of \nimplementation.  The  first  year  will  mainly  be  preparatory  to  implementation,  including, \nestablishment of offices, systems, and processes for project coordination and management, and \nissuance of required decrees by national and district governments. Preparation will include the \nengagement  of  consultants  and  the  national  NGO;  the  establishment  of  DCCs,  PIUs,  VPICs, \nand PIVFs; and engagement and training of local NGOs/community organizations. During year \n1 of project implementation, eligible villages will be prioritized by the DCCs in consultation with \ndistrict  governments.  Investment  proposals  will  be  accepted  for  approval  by  the  PIVFs  three \ntimes a year, beginning the last quarter of the second year of implementation. Implementation of \ninvestments is expected to require 1 year.  \n  \n\n5. \n\nProcurement \n\n52. \nProcurement under the Project will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Contracts \nfor  civil  works  will  be  relatively  simple  for  renovation  of  district  offices,  valued  at  less  than \n$100,000  equivalent,  and  will  be  carried  out  by  the  PIUs  using  local  competitive  bidding \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  PIU  will  also  be  responsible  for  procurement  of  office \nfurniture  through  local  competitive  bidding.  The  PCMU  will  carry  out  procurement  of  vehicles \nand equipment estimated to cost more than $100,000 but less than $500,000 using international \nshopping  procedures.  Civil  works  for  community-managed  village  infrastructure,  including \ntubewell irrigation schemes and access roads, financed from the village investment funds may \nbe carried out by communities. Communities shall provide labor and appropriate technologies. \nMaterials and services for such civil works estimated to cost less than $30,000 equivalent shall \nbe  procured  through  direct  purchase.  Indicative  Procurement  Packages  are  provided  in \nAppendix 10. \n \n\n                                                 \n28 ADB. 1999. Special Evaluation Study of the Role of Nongovernment Organizations in ADB Projects. Manila. \n\n\f15 \n\n6. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n53. \nA  team  of  24  consultants  for  a  total  input  of  796  person-months  of  international  and \ndomestic  consulting  services  will  be  required  to  prepare  a  detailed  implementation  plan  and \nprocedures  for  the  Project  during  the  first  year,  and  support  the  subsequent  4-year \nimplementation  phase.  Person-months  are  given  in  parentheses.  The  internationally  recruited \nexperts (54) will be specialists in (i) project implementation (team leader) (27); (ii) management \ninformation  systems  (12);  (iii)  participatory  planning  (4);  (iv)  agricultural  marketing  (4);  (v) \neconomics/financial  analysis  (4);  and  (vi)  information  management  (3).  The  domestic  experts \n(742) will be specialists in (i) project implementation (60); (ii) district liaison (five officers) (240); \n(iii) participatory planning (27); (iv) national monitoring and evaluation (60); (v) district monitoring \nand evaluation (five persons) (240); (vi) economics/financial analysis (6); (vii) gender (27); (viii) \nmanagement  information  systems  (16);  and  (ix)  information  management  (6);  as  well  as  an \nombudsperson  (60).  An  international  consulting  firm  in  association  with  domestic  consultants \nwill be selected using the full technical proposal procedure in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of \ndomestic  consultants.  The  quality  and  cost-based  selection  method  will  be  used  for  the \nengagement of consultants. The expertise required and outline terms of reference for consulting \nservices are provided in Appendix 11.  \n \n\n7. \n\nFund Flow and Disbursement \n\n54. \nFor  ADB  loan  funds,  direct  payment,  reimbursement,  and  imprest  account  procedures \nwill be used. Detailed fund flow and disbursement arrangements and fiduciary controls at each \nstep  of  fund  flow  are  presented  in  Appendix  12.  Funds  for  village-level  investments  will  be \ndisbursed  through  the  imprest  account  as  grants  directly  to  the  village  bank  accounts  held  by \nthe VPICs. These grants will be subject to the maximum amount established by the Project for \neach district (based on the total number of eligible villages in the district), the maximum amount \nestablished  for  the  district  for  the  particular  budget  year  (based  on  the  implementation \nschedule),  and  a  maximum  (of  $30,000)  for  each  village  in  the  district.  The  PIU  will  monitor \nthese limits. The project management component will be managed by the PCMU and the PIU. \nFor district project management costs, the PIU will establish a bank account at the district level \nto manage its own project management costs and the costs of the DCC and the PIVF. These \nwill  be  clearly  defined  in  an  implementation  agreement  between  the  PCMU  and  the  PIU.  The \nPCMU  will  directly  manage  fund  flow  for  other  components.  The  national  NGO  contract  will \nprovide  funds  for  national  and  local  NGO/community  organization  staff,  training  and  non-\nagricultural technical support for village planning (including VPIC expenses), and remuneration \nfor village facilitators. \n \n55. \nThe imprest account will be established and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook.  The  initial  deposit  will  be  $3.5  million  and  is  based  on  expected \ndisbursements  for  the  first  6  months  of  implementation.  The  statement  of  expenditures  (SOE) \nprocedure may be used for reimbursement of eligible expenditures for village investment plans, \ngood  and  services  contracts,  and  individual  and  consulting  firm  contracts,  and  to  liquidate \nadvances  provided  into  the  Imprest  Account,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  \"Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook\"  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  between  the  Government  and  ADB.    Any \nindividual  payment  to  be  reimbursed  or  liquidated  under  the  SOE  procedure  shall  not  exceed \nthe equivalent of $100,000. Statement of expenditure documentation will be retained at the PIU \nor the PCMU depending on where the expenditure is incurred.   \n \n\n\f16 \n\n8. \n\nAccounts, Audits, and Reporting Requirements \n\n56. \nThe  PCMU  and  PIU  will  maintain  records  and  accounts  to  identify  goods  and  services \nfinanced  out  of  loan  proceeds  and  to  disclose  the  use  thereof.  The  PCMU  will  maintain  all \naccounts  for  expenditures  for  the  Support  for  Agricultural  Innovation  Development  and \nDissemination  and  the  Development  of  National  and  Local  Agricultural  Information  Resources \ncomponents.  The  PIUs  will  maintain  their  own  records  for  expenditure  out  of  their  bank \naccounts.  The  VPICs  through  their  finance  units  will  maintain  accounts  as  specified  by  ADB\u2019s \nRural  Income  Generation  Project  and  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Nusa  Tenggara  Agriculture  Area \nDevelopment  Project  (footnote  6),  and  their  books  and  records  will  be  open  to  public  access. \nSummary  information  on  village-level  expenditures  will  be  posted  on  office  white  boards  for \npublic view. The National NGO will maintain records and accounts for community development \nactivities  including  payments  to  local  NGOs/community  organizations,  development  and \ntechnical verification costs of investment plans, payments to facilitators, and other expenses. \n \n57. \nThe  PCMU  will  prepare  financial  statements  for  the  Project,  and  have  them  audited \nannually  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing  principles  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to \nADB. Certified copies of audited accounts and auditors\u2019 reports will be submitted to ADB within \n9 months after the end of each fiscal year.  \n \nThe PIUs will prepare and submit to the PCMU semiannual progress reports during the \n58. \nimplementation  period  within  15  days  after  the  end  of  the  reporting  period,  a  midterm  review \nreport,  and  a  project  completion  report  3  months  after  project  completion.  The  PCMU  will \nconsolidate progress reports (incorporating financial and physical data) to be submitted to ADB \nno later than 30 days after the end of the reporting period. Reports will include progress made \nand problems encountered, steps taken or proposed to be taken to remedy these problems, and \nthe proposed program of activities and expected disbursements for the following period.  \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Management System \n\n59. \nThe PCMU will have overall responsibility for project monitoring and evaluation. Assisted \nby consultants, it will design, execute, and analyze baseline, midterm, and completion surveys, \nas well as any special studies that may be required.29 A monitoring unit within the PIUs assisted \nby  consultants  will  monitor  the  field  activities  for  the  farmer  empowerment  component. \nConsultants  will  assist  in  (i)  setting  up  a  computer-based,  gender-disaggregated  PPMS,  in \naccordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  and  ADB\u2019s  reporting  requirements;  (ii)  selecting  a  set  of \nmonitorable  development  indicators;  (iii)  designing  the  various  surveys;  and  (iv)  organizing \nworkshops  and  an  on-the-job  training  program  for  staff  assigned  to  the  monitoring  and \nevaluation section, including those of the PIUs. The PPMS will be designed to enable the PCMU \nto (i) keep track of physical implementation; (ii) coordinate and assess the various inputs of the \nProject  to  achieve  the  targets;  (iv)  assess  project  impact  from  a  set  of  quantifiable  and \nqualitative indicators of social, environmental, gender, and economic impacts; and (v) produce \ndata for reporting purposes. The indicators will include data to allow valuation and monitoring of \nenvironmental  and  gender-specific  benefits.  The  project  design  framework  will  be  used  as  a \nstarting  point  to  design  the  PPMS  and  will  be  revised  iteratively  as  appropriate  during  project \nimplementation. \n \n                                                 \n29 Indicators will be selected to monitor achievement of the targets established in the project framework (Appendix 1). \nInformation will be required on present value of agricultural production, crop losses, farm-market price differentials, \nincome levels of women, degree of satisfaction with village-level public investments, ease of access to information, \nresearch budgets of the central Government by type of agriculture, group dynamics, etc. \n\n\f17 \n\nAt  the  village  level,  monitoring  will  be  participatory  with  farmer  groups  themselves \n60. \nmonitoring  progress  and  reporting  it  in  farmer  meetings  and  through  a  public  village  bulletin \nboard.  Formally,  the  VPIC  will  monitor  the  implementation  of  the  investments  by  direct \nobservation.  The  village  local  government  will  monitor  the  implementation  through  written \nreports prepared by the implementation unit of the VPIC. A public village bulletin board will be \nset up upon which the VPIC will post information on progress to date, labor usage, use of funds, \nand  outstanding  balance.  A  monthly  farmer  group  meeting  will  be  organized  by  the  village \nfacilitators  and  local  NGOs/community  organizations  to  produce  a  report  on  the  progress  of \nactivities  and  financial  status.  Farmer  group  members,  village  local  government,  informal \nleaders,  and  NGO  representatives  will  attend  the  meeting.  The  report  will  contain  a  review  of \nprogress to date, constraints or problems encountered during implementation, financial reports, \nand a report on the performance of the external agency providing implementation support. The \nsecretariat of the PIVF will convene a meeting of the PIVF to present the output of the monthly \nfarmer  group  meeting.  The  district  PIU  will  compile  reports  of  the  PIVF  meetings  into \nsemiannual  reports  to  the  PCMU.  These  reports  will  in  turn  be  compiled  and  submitted  to  the \nNSC, and then with NSC endorsement to ADB. \n \nG. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures \n\n1. \n\nEnvironment \n\nthat \n\nthe  Project  would  not  create  any  significant  environmental \n\n61. \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  category  B,  and  an  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE) \nfor  sample  subprojects  in  four  villages  (Bale  and  Pili  Makuzawa  villages  in  Central  Sulawesi, \nand  Caruban  and  Klepu  villages  in  Central  Java)  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental assessment requirement. A summary IEE is presented in Appendix 13. The IEE \nfound \nimpacts.  The \nenvironmental  impacts  associated  with  increasing  agriculture  productivity  will  be  minor  and \nmainly relate to increased exposure to agrochemicals, and therefore could potentially increase \nhealth  problems  related  to  agrochemical  use.  To  mitigate  this  problem,  training  on  health  and \nsafety  for  utilizing  agrochemicals  will  be  included  in  the  curriculum  of  the  village  facilitator \ntraining program. The other potential impacts are primarily related to civil works, particularly for \nrehabilitation  and  improvement  of  village  roads  and  irrigation.  Mitigation  measures  to  address \nenvironmental impacts are provided in the management plan of the IEE. A possible exception \nmight  arise  in  the  case  of  subprojects  located  adjacent  to  protected  areas  (e.g.,  Rinjani \nProtected Area and Lore Lindu National Park). In view of the environmental sensitivity of these \nareas,  the  Project  will  not  support  any  physical  interventions,  e.g.,  rehabilitation  and \nimprovement  of  roads  or  irrigation  systems,  introduction  of  a  new  species  in  agriculture \nimprovement,  and  livestock  raising  in  these  areas  without  the  endorsement  of  local \nenvironmental  NGOs,  the  appropriate  local  government  authority,  the  NSC,  and  ADB.  Local \nenvironmental  NGOs  are  expected  to  take  a  role  in  monitoring  implementation  of  these \nmitigation measures. \n \n\n2. \n\nSocial Analysis \n\nA  detailed  social  analysis  was  conducted  for  the  target  areas.  While  Indonesia  is  an \n62. \nethnically  diverse  country,  a  large  degree  of  homogeneity  often  exists  at  the  village  level  and \nsocial  stratification  varies  across  regions.  More  remote  project  areas  face  a  greater  range  of \nproblems,  many  specifically  related  to  their  isolation.  These  include  a  more  stratified  society, \nless development activity, limited access to markets and information, and often limited access to \ninformation  on  legal  rights.  The  strengthening  of  local  traditional  and  informal  institutions  to \nmake  them  more  inclusive,  accountable,  and  effective  at  meeting  community  self-identified \n\n\f18 \n\nto  have  had  some \n\nagricultural  development  needs,  will  be  emphasized  through  the  Project  to  address  location-\nspecific issues. \n \n63. \nThe  roles  of  women  and  men  in  agriculture  are  quite  similar  across  target  regions. \nWomen  have  traditional  tasks  and  areas  of  responsibility.  However,  women\u2019s  participation  in \nvillage  life,  and  decision  making  is  variable  as  are  their  specific  problems.  Active  and  high-\nquality  rural  development  programs  appear \nimpact  on  women\u2019s \nempowerment  at  the  village  level.  However,  women  were  rarely  involved  in  nontraditional \nagricultural activities. Women can become involved in production of high-value crops, as long as \nsuch crops are suitable for cultivation on small areas of land, such as upland crops. The Project \nintends to maximize its focus on women\u2019s activities. \n \nThe  social  realities  of  project  areas  make  it  imperative  that  group  mobilization  and \n64. \nparticipatory  methods  used  by  the  Project  pay  particular  attention  to  ethnic  group  variety, \ntraditional institutions (adat), and limited interaction with external communities. Since the Project \nwill  work  through  local  community  organizations  with  ongoing  community  partnerships  and \nthrough  village  facilitators  elected  from  the  villages,  local  customs  and  institutions  will \nautomatically  receive  primary  importance  in  the  process  of  group  formation  and  decision \nmaking. Group formation will also rely upon tools of social interaction that have been tried and \ntested  in  Indonesia  in  diverse  surroundings.  A  national  implementing  NGO  will  be  chosen  to \nmaximize  experience  in  the  use  of  these  tools.  The  first  step  in  group  mobilization  will  be  a \nsocial assessment of the target community by the local NGO/community organization following \nADB\u2019s  guidelines  for  social  assessment  appropriately  adapted  by  the  participatory  specialist \nengaged  by  the  Project.  Special  attention  will  be  paid  to  the  needs  of  indigenous  people  and \nwomen in this social assessment. \n \n65. \nThroughout the process of mobilization and decision making, utmost efforts will be made \nto  prevent  exclusion  of  vulnerable  sections  of  the  community.  The  Project  proposes  to \nimplement  village-level  activities  through  village  facilitators  to  provide  assistance  during \ndiscussions  and  for  problem  solving  and  consensus  building.  To  minimize  exclusion,  group \nmobilization will be preceded by an adequate stakeholder analysis, and a participation plan will \nbe  developed  to  obtain  agreement  and  support  of  all  stakeholders.  Adequate  gender \nsensitization training will precede group mobilization. Further, since facilitators will be from the \nvillage,  they  will  be  capable  of  using  local  ethnic  languages  especially  to  encourage  the \nparticipation of women and minorities. The Project will encourage the formation of homogenous \ngroups where possible and ensure that the poorest are represented in the groups. The Project \nwill  encourage  investments  that  will  improve  the  income  of  poor  women  farmers.  A  gender \nspecialist  will  be  engaged  by  the  Project  to  ensure  that  gender  issues  are  adequately \nincorporated  during  implementation.  At  least  one  facilitator  in  every  project  village  will  be  a \nwoman. This will avoid any exclusion of indigenous peoples that might otherwise result from the \nunsuitability of group mobilization methods to local customs and traditions. \n \n66. \nEligibility criteria have been defined for village investments to ensure the participation of \nthe  poorest  in  their  development  and  gender  and  poverty  impacts.  Specific  assurances  have \nbeen  put  in  place  to  ensure  the  desired  gender  impacts  of  village  investments,  the  adequate \nparticipation  of  women  in  decision  making,  and  a  greater  role  for  women  in  government \nadministrative  structures.  A  gender  action  plan  developed  for  the  Project  provides  specific \nrecommendations  for  various  stages  of  project  preparation  and  implementation.  The  project \ndesign has particularly tried to ensure that market information is accessible and widely available \nto farmers and agricultural communities at the village level.  \n \n\n\f19 \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Benefits and Impact on Poverty \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Benfits \n\n67. \nThe  Project  does  not  lend  itself  to  the  traditional  economic  analysis  of  projects. \nQuantifiable  benefits  will  arise  from  village  investments  as  increased  agricultural  incomes,  but \nbecause  beneficiaries  determine  investments,  inputs  and  outputs  cannot  be  accurately \npredicted. The farmer empowerment component provides capacity development of poor farmers \nto  solve  common  problems,  and  of  local  NGOs/community  organizations  to  support  farmer \ngroups. Government capacity will increase through the development of information systems and \nhuman resources for research. The innovation component promotes a demand-driven focus for \nagricultural research and development to meet location-specific needs of poor farmers, typically \nin  marginal,  rainfed  areas  underrepresented  in  past  government  research  and  development. \nSuch  benefits  are  project  objectives  for  which  input  costs  are  identifiable,  but  outputs  and \noutcomes cannot be predicted with accuracy. Studies of the economic impact of research show \nhighly  positive  returns  and  technological  innovations  are  examples  of  the  public  goods  sought \nby the Project to create nonexclusionary benefits to improve poor farmers\u2019 incomes. \n \n\n2. \n\nImpact on Poverty \n\n68. \nSurvey  and  census  data  of  the  Central  Bureau  of  Statistics  allow  highly  cost-efficient \ntargeting  of  the  poor  down  to  the  village  level  using  measures  of  consumption,  diet,  housing, \nmalnutrition,  and  the  like.  The  data  show  that  rich  and  poor  communities  exist  in  most \nprovinces, districts, and subdistricts; and targeting at these levels result in substantial leakage of \nbenefits to the nonpoor. Targeting at the village level allows this Project to identify a beneficiary \npopulation in which 75% of households are poor. \n \n69. \nThe Central Bureau\u2019s statistics show simple head-count shares of the poor as (i) 75% of \nbeneficiary households; (ii) 66% of households in project districts; and (iii) 12.1% of taxes based \non  their  share  of  national  expenditure.  However,  the  75%  head  count  of  poor  households \nunderstates the poverty impact of the Project as it is concerned only with the share of benefits, \nwhile ADB\u2019s prescribed analysis also incorporates share of costs, mostly by taxes to which the \npoor contribute only 12.1%. The analysis ratios are (i) poverty impact ratio of the net benefits to \nthe poor to total net benefits, and (ii) net benefits to the poor as a ratio to project cost. \n \n70. \nThe poor\u2019s high share in benefits and low share in costs will result in a favorable poverty \nimpact  ratio.  If  benefits  from  quantifiable  but  uncertain  village  investments  give  returns  in  an \nexpected  range  of  15%  to  20%,  then  (i)  the  poverty  impact  ratio  ranges  from  3.7  to  1.8, \ndemonstrating  a  substantial  distributional  effect  in  favor  of  the  poor;  and  (ii)  the  ratio  of  net \nbenefits of the poor to the present value of project costs range from 66% to 91%. Village plans \nreviewed show typical financial internal rates of return of some 25%, to give project economic \nreturns  providing  a  poverty  impact  ratio  of  about  2.5  and  net  benefits  to  the  poor  at  75%  of \nproject  costs.  Though  uncertain  in  detail,  the  range  suggests  the  Project  is  soundly  poverty \nfocused,  and  efficient  and  effective  in  delivering  benefits  to  the  poor.  The  poverty  impact \nassessment is discussed in greater detail in Appendix 14. \n \n\n\f20 \n\n3. \n\nDelivery Efficiency \n\n71. \nDelivering  village  level  public  investments  is  more  efficient  through  the  Project\u2019s \nproposed  mechanism:  (i)  decision  making  authority  and  implementing  responsibility  delegated \nto  farmers  themselves,  and  (ii)  funds  controlled  by  farmers  than  through  planning  by \ngovernment  agencies  and  delivery  through  outside  contractors.  After  decentralization,  village-\nlevel public investments are delivered through a three-stage process: (i) information gathering at \nthe  village  level  through  an  extension  agent  or  field  staff  of  the  agricultural  service;  (ii) \nconsolidation  of  village  information  and  central  investment  priorities  at  the  district  agricultural \noffice,  development  of  investment  plans,  and  identification  of  village  investments;  and  (iii) \ndelivery  of  village  investments  typically  through  contractors  supervised  by  government \nagencies.  Rough  estimates  show  that  delivering  $30,000  of  village  investments  through  the \nexisting government structures would cost between $4,505 and $4,675. In contrast, the annual \ncost  of  delivering  proposed  project  investments  using  village  decision  making  with  NGO \ncoordination  and  technical  backstopping  is  estimated  at  $1,648.  Cost  savings  are  achieved \nbecause technical backstopping is provided only as needed; information collection and planning \nat the village level have very low costs; and the cost of relaying information from the village to \nthe district level, incorporating this information in a wider development planning mechanism, and \ntranslating this information into investment plans is avoided. \n \nB. \n\nEnvironment  \n\n72. \nAn  important  feature  of  the  Project  is  its  focus  on  developing  the  capacity  of  village \nfacilitators  to  involve  farmers  in  actively  identifying  and  implementing  village  investments. \nTherefore,  the  approach  to  raising  environmental  awareness  in  the  Project  will  be  to  integrate \nenvironmental  assessments  into  the  formulation  of  village  investments,  rather  than  to  try  to \nimpose  another  layer  of  environmental  intervention.  The  village  plans  will  take  into  account \nenvironmental aspects (e.g., rainfall, evaporation, soils, consumption of agrochemical) with the \nassistance  of  competent  local  expertise  identified  by  local  and  national  NGOs.  Applicable \ngovernment  regulations  will  be  strictly  adhered  to  in  the  implementation  of  all  village \ninvestments.  Therefore,  the  Project  will  offer  potential  environmental  benefits  by  avoiding \nenvironmental  costs  resulting  from  failure  to  take  into  account  environmental  conditions  in \nselecting the right inputs for agriculture and other economic activities. \n \nC. \n\nSocial Dimensions \n\nThe Project will directly enhance the capacity of poor farmers to innovate in agricultural \n73. \nproduction  and  marketing.  Since  the  type  of  agricultural  technology  chosen  will  take  into \nconsideration  local  social  and  physical  conditions  of  the  project  areas,  agricultural  production \nrisk will be reduced. Vulnerable groups will, therefore be accorded security of income streams \nand welfare. The Project will work together with local village facilitators, local NGOs/community \norganizations, and competent local expertise such as district agriculture extension workers, who \nunderstand  the  local  social  conditions  and  who  will  use  this  knowledge  as  a  basis  for \nstrengthening  participatory  development.  This  will  increase  the  participation  of  the  poorer \nsections in public decision making. This empowerment of the poor is expected to sustain itself \nbeyond the life of the Project. The organizations put in place by the Project are expected to be \ninstitutionalized in the target districts and expanded to other districts. The Project is, therefore, \nexpected  to  have  benefits  beyond  its  implementation  period  and  area.  Since  the  Project  will \nhave a significant impact on reducing isolation by improving access to markets and increasing \nthe  flow  of  information,  the  Project  will  address  social  problems  that  are  specifically  related  to \nthe  isolation  of  areas.  Furthermore,  the  Project\u2019s  attention  to  the  formation  of  homogenous \n\n\f21 \n\ngroups and ensuring that the poorest are represented in decision making groups will ensure that \nactivities  are  implemented  that  are  specifically  targeted  to  the  disadvantaged  sections  of  the \ncommunities. The Project will not entail any resettlement. Where project investments cause any \nhouseholds  to  lose  assets,  income,  or  livelihoods,  the  households  will  be  adequately \ncompensated for the loss. \n \n74. \nThe  high  involvement  of  women  in  agriculture  as  farmers,  sharecroppers,  and \nagricultural  laborers  means  that  women  will  directly  benefit  from  project  investments.  Specific \nassurances have been formulated to mitigate the possible exclusion of women and other more \ndisadvantaged groups from actively participating in project activities. The Project stipulates that \nhalf  the  members  of  the  PIVFs  will  be  women.  This  will  increase  the  importance  accorded  to \nwomen\u2019s  activities  in  investment  selection.  The  development  of  socialization  materials  in  local \nlanguages  will  increase  the  reflection  of  women\u2019s  views  in  investment  proposals.  Indicators  of \nthe  successful  functioning  of  the  groups  will  be  high  women\u2019s  attendance  rates  at  meetings, \ntheir  decision  to  start  new  group  activities  on  their  own,  and  the  spontaneous  emergence  of \nwomen\u2019s groups desiring to join the Project. Monitoring and evaluation mechanisms will be built \ninto the Project so that activities can be continuously assessed to verify the extent to which men \nand women farmers are reached with the different types of project services and resources.  \n \nD. \n\nRisks  \n\n75. \nYears  of  top-down  centralized  agricultural  investments  have  left  farmers  with  little \ncapacity  to  innovate.  Little  village  expertise  exists  in  implementing  investments  and  managing \nfunds. The success of the Project will depend upon (i) the effectiveness of NGOs to train and \nassist  village  facilitators,  and  (ii)  the  establishment  of  effective  VPICs.  The  Project  will  pay \ncareful  attention  to  the  training  of  village  facilitators  and  VPICs,  and  to  the  selection  of  local \nNGOs/community organizations and their training. \n \nSelf-help  projects  sometimes  do  not  work  because  beneficiaries  do  not  have  the \n76. \nexpertise  to  undertake  activities  they  have  themselves  identified.  Effective  links  with  local \nagencies that can provide technical expertise will be crucial to project success. Such direct links \nto  farmers  have  not  been  the  norm,  particularly  for  government  agencies.  The  efficient \nfunctioning  of  the  DCC  and  the  initiative  of  the  NGOs/community  organizations  will  be  key  to \nforging  links  between  farmers  and  sources  of  technical  expertise.  The  first  year  of  project \nimplementation  will  be  spent  establishing  such  links  and  identifying  the  modalities  for \npartnerships between farmer groups and external agencies. \n \n77. \nNGOs have sometimes had a tense relationship with external funding agencies and the \nGovernment. A healthy working relationship between NGOs and the PIUs, DCCs, PCMU, and \nPIVF are essential for project success. The relative autonomy accorded to the NGOs, the direct \ncontrol of investment funds by farmers, and the monitoring of the Project by independent groups \nwill  reduce  some  of  the  tensions  between  government  agencies  and  NGOs.  However,  some \nlocal  friction  could  still  arise  in  some  project  areas  and  this  will  have  to  be  resolved  through \nmediation by local NGOs, the national NGO, and perhaps by ADB missions. \n \n78. \nAs with almost every project, the risk of appropriation of benefits by the more powerful \nsections of society is a risk also in this Project. To mitigate this risk, the Project will ensure that \ndecision making groups empower poor farmers. The Project will attempt to mitigate this risk by \nmaximizing the transparency of the process and building in adequate accounting, auditing, and \nreporting  requirements  without  placing  undue  administrative  burden  on  poor  villages.  Strong \nsupervision  by  ADB  will  be  key  in  identifying  problems  when  they  arise.  The  Project  will  also \n\n\f22 \n\nestablish a complaints and grievance system. Complaints received will be investigated quickly \nto  establish  confidence  in  the  system.  The  Project  will  specifically  support  an  independent \nombudsperson and monitoring by an independent group. \n \nThe  complexity  of  the  Project  makes  its  success  crucially  contingent  upon  efficient \n79. \nimplementation.  Centralized  management  of  such  a  complex  project  is  impossible  without \nincurring  excessive  project  management  costs.  However,  the  use  of  NGOs/community \norganizations with ongoing community partnerships is a novel approach to resolving problems \nof  managing  local  implementation.  Appropriate  monitoring  and  reporting  formats  will  be \nestablished to ensure that the decentralized implementation of the Project does not detract from \nits intended benefits. \n \nDecentralization  has  resulted  in  uncertainties  related  to  financial  autonomy,  revenue-\n80. \nraising  powers  of  districts,  and  regulations  on  the  use  of  external  funds.  These  uncertainties \ncould potentially cause delays in project implementation and friction between central and district \ngovernments. Particularly, in the absence of guidelines on the responsibility for the repayment \nof loans from external funding agencies, districts are unsure of their loan repayment liabilities. If \ncentral  Government  guidelines  require  project  districts  to  assume  responsibility  for  the \nrepayment of the loan in the future, district governments could delay their use of loan funds until \na satisfactory resolution is reached. This would delay project implementation. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances  in  addition  to  the  standard \n\n81. \nassurances which have been incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nCounterpart funds. The Government will prepare and cause the governments of \nthe project districts to prepare, by 31 December of each year, an annual plan for \nthe next year to ensure that during each year of project implementation adequate \nbudgetary  allocation  of  required  counterpart  funds  is  made  and  such  funds  are \nreleased  by  the  relevant  authorities  on  a  timely  and  regular  basis  to  facilitate \nproject implementation. The annual plan will include (i) the allocation of sufficient \ncounterpart  funds  for  project  implementation,  (ii)  proposed  budgetary  allocation \nfor the rehabilitation of roads, and (iii) financing plan for the project. \n\nUse of earmarked funds. Except as ADB may otherwise agree, the Government \nwill  ensure  that,  throughout  project  implementation,  the  loan  proceeds  will  be \ndisbursed  to  the  project  districts  by  budgetary  transfers  earmarked  for  such \npurposes. \n\nLaws 22 and 25. The Government will ensure and cause the governments of the \nproject  districts  to  ensure  that  the  provision  from  the  loan  proceeds,  and  the \ncounterpart  contributions,  necessary  for  financing  project  activities  continue \nthroughout  project  implementation  notwithstanding  any  reallocation  of  authority \nor  responsibility  for  channeling  external  assistance,  and  for  provision  of \ncorresponding  counterpart  contributions,  between  the  national  Government  and \ndistricts; or any requirements for providing matching counterpart contributions for \nfull \nfunding  project  activities \nimplementation of laws 22 and 25 of 1999, unless otherwise agreed to by ADB. \nThe Government will: \n\nthe  project  districts  arising \n\nfrom \n\nfrom \n\nthe \n\n\f23 \n\n(a)  provide timely updates to ADB on the process of decentralization undertaken \nin accordance with the provisions of laws 22 and 25, and any implementing \nregulations issued thereunder, and take into account any views expressed by \nADB thereon; and \n\n(b)  ensure that if existing project districts are subdivided during or before project \nimplementation  as  a  result  of  the  decentralization  process,  villages  in  newly \nformed  districts  will  be  eligible  to  receive  project  funds  if  new  district \ngovernments  make  commitments  to  project  implementation  similar  to  those \nmade by the governments of the project districts in their commitment letters \naddressed to ADB.  \n\n(iv) \n\nPIVFs  and  DCCs.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  upon  project  completion, \nproject  activities  will  be  sustained  and  incorporated  into  the  planning  and \nbudgetary  processes  of  the  governments  of  the  project  districts  and  be  funded \nthrough regular budgetary allocations of the governments of the project districts. \n\n(v) \n\nEnvironmental.  The  Government  will  ensure,  or  cause  the  project  district \ngovernments to ensure, that \n\n(a)  project  implementation  is  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  existing  \nenvironmental  laws,  regulations  and  standards  of  Indonesia  and  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental procedures, requirements and guidelines; \n\n(b)  all  monitoring  and  mitigation  measures  indicated  in  the  IEE  are  undertaken \nfor  the  Project\u2014in  particular,  no  physical  intervention  (e.g.,  rehabilitation \nand/or construction of new roads or irrigation systems, introduction of a new \nspecies  in  agriculture  improvement  and  livestock)  in  the  villages  adjacent  to \nnational parks or other protected areas, specifically, to Rinjani Protected Area \nand  Lore  Lindu  National  Park,    will  be  undertaken  without  endorsement  of \nlocal  environmental  NGOs,  the  appropriate  local  government  authority,  the \nNSC,  and  ADB  on  a  case  by  case  basis;  and  the  public  shall  have  free \naccess to environmental information pertaining to the Project; \n\n(c)  as part of each village investment plan assessment, the PIVFs will carry out \nenvironmental screening, and where applicable, obtain  an IEE in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  requirements  and  the  relevant \nprocedures of the Government.   Any negative environmental impact that may \noccur  as  a  result  of  the  implementation  of  a  village  investment  plan  will  be \nmitigated as indicated in the IEE. \n\nSocial  assessment.  As  part  of  each  village  investment  plan  assessment,  the \nPIVFs  will  carry  out  social  assessments  of  each  village  investment  plan,  as \nnecessary, to ensure that there is no displacement of people from land, income \nsources,  housing  or  other  assets  as  a  result  of  village  investment  activities.  In \ncase  of  any  loss  of  land,  income  sources,  housing  or  other  assets,  the \nGovernment  will  ensure  that  affected  parties  are  compensated  at  replacement \ncost agreed upon by those affected and endorsed in writing by the farmer group \nundertaking the investment. \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii)  Gender.  The  Government  will  ensure,  or  cause  the  governments  of  the  project \ndistricts  to  ensure,  that  the  gender  action  plan  developed  for  the  Project  is \ncomplied with during the implementation of the Project so that \n\n\f24 \n\n(a)   at  least  one  facilitator  in  every  project  village  will  be  a  woman  and  that  a \nwoman  facilitator  will  be  one  of  three  signatories  to  the  VPIC  account  for \nreceiving funds for investments approved by the PIVF; \n\n(b)  the woman village facilitator from each project village will be a member of the \n\nPIVF;  and \n\n(c)  village  investment  plan  selection  criteria  will  provide  additional  weighting  to \ninvestments  that  improve  welfare  of  women  and  include  components  or \nfeatures  to  promote  and  facilitate  women\u2019s  involvement  in  investment \nimplementation. \n\n(viii)  Participatory  processes.  The  Government  will  ensure,  or  cause \n\nthe \ngovernments  of  project  districts  to  ensure,  that  assessment,  processing,  and \nimplementation of village investment plans are carried out in compliance with the \nparticipatory processes agreed to by the Government and ADB.   \n\nEligibility  criteria  for  village  level  investments.  The  Government  will  ensure \nthat  during  the  first  year  of  project  implementation  the  PCMU  will  formalize \neligibility  criteria  initially  agreed  to  by  the  Government  and  ADB  for  selection  of \nvillage investments, and that such refined criteria are, with the approval of ADB, \napplied to all village investments during project implementation and thereafter.  \n\nMidterm review. In the third year of project implementation, the Government will \nsubmit to ADB a midterm review report following which the Government and ADB \nwill  undertake  a  midterm  review  of  the  Project  to  assess  the  initial  impact  of \ncompleted  project  outputs,  and  to  make  adjustments,  as  necessary,  to \nsubsequent  project  implementation.  In  particular,  the  review  will  assess  the \nadequacy of the budget allocations, disbursement of loan proceeds, the targeting \nmechanisms, and delivery of project inputs.   \n\nProject  performance  management  system.  Within  the  first  12  months  of \nproject  implementation,  the  Government  will  establish  a  project  performance \nmanagement system (PPMS), satisfactory to ADB. The PPMS will monitor social \nimpact, gender impact, impact on agricultural productivity and marketing, etc. \n\n \nB. \n\n82. \n \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\nThe following are conditions for the loan effectiveness: \n\nthe  Government  will  have  prepared  a  detailed  Project  Administration \nMemorandum acceptable to ADB; \n\nthe Government will have certified to ADB that adequate counterpart funds have \nbeen  allocated  for  all  activities  outlined  in  the  work  plan  for  the  first  year  of \nproject implementation; \n\nthe Government will have developed and submitted to ADB selection procedures, \nacceptable  to  ADB,  for  the  selection  of  the  national  and  local  NGOs  or  local \ncommunity organizations for the Project; and \n\nthe Government will have issued a decree on project implementation, satisfactory \nto  ADB,  clearly  specifying  (i)  the  respective  roles  and  responsibilities  of  district \ngovernments  and  government  agencies  in  project  implementation;  and  (ii)  the \nflow of funds between these parties. \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n\f25 \n\n \nConditions for Disbursement of Loan Proceeds \n\nNo disbursement shall be made \n\nC. \n\n83. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nfrom the imprest account to a project district for expenditures under the Part A of \nthe Project until the bupati has established the DCC and the PIU, the government \nof  the  project  district  has  submitted  to  ADB  its  rehabilitation  program  for \nprioritized  roads,  and  a  satisfactory  implementation  agreement  has  been \nexecuted between the PCMU and the PIU in that project district. \n\nfrom  the  imprest  account  for  expenditures  for  research  programs  or  equipment \nunder Part C of the Project until AARD has undertaken assessments of research \nat  all  participating  NARIs,  identified  technology  gaps,  and  formulated  research \nprograms for marginal rainfed agriculture.    \n\nto a VPIC account until a VPIC and village facilitators have been elected in that \nproject village, and a satisfactory implementation agreement has been concluded \nbetween that VPIC and the PIU.  \n\n \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n84. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  42,091,000  to  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Poor  Farmers\u2019  Income \nImprovement through Innovation Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with a term of 32 \nyears,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1%  per \nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n15 July 2002  \n\nTADAO CHINO \nPresident \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n \n\nDesign \nSummary \n\nGoal \n \n\u2022  Increased \n\ninnovations in \nagricultural \nproduction and \nmarketing by poor \nfarmers \n\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n\nPerformance Indicators/Targets \n\n \n \n\u2022  Poor farmers innovate in production, \n\nmarketing, and agribusiness to \nincrease value of agricultural \nproduction by at least 25%; or \ndecrease crop losses by at least 25%; \nand decrease farm-market price \ndifferentials by at least 25% in target \nvillages three years after project \ncompletion.

The  Project  will  engage  local \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  or  community  organizations  to  undertake  this  activity. \nThe national NGO will select the local NGO through a prescribed selection process and provide \ntraining to the NGO as necessary if the appropriate capacity to implement the project is found \nlacking within the local NGO. This activity will, in every eligible village, involve three steps. \n \n4. \nFirst,  establish  a  method  of  farmer  group  organization  that  will  take  into  account  the \nsocial  dynamics  of  agricultural  production  and  marketing.  The  activity  will  begin  with  a  social \nassessment  of  the  village  by  the  local  NGO  according  to  social  assessment  guidelines \ndeveloped by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The method for group formation selected for \nthe  village  will  reflect  the  findings  of  the  social  assessment  and  thus  incorporate  the  village \nsocial dynamics relevant to achieving project objectives in ensuring that socially disadvantaged \nfarmers  will  be  able  to  participate  in  village  decision  making.  In  some  cases  focus  group \ndiscussions at the hamlet level might be sufficient to represent the hamlet decisions. However, \nin some cases, subgroups within hamlets may be necessary.  \n \n5. \nSecond,  provide  skills  training  to  two  facilitators  per  village\u2014elected  by  villagers  either \nthrough direct election or through consensus (masyarah)\u2014on participatory methods, information \ntechnology  and  data  retrieval,  preparation  of  investment  plans,  and  on-farm  trials  and \ndemonstrations.  One  facilitator  will  be  a  woman  from  the  village.  The  training  methods  of  the \nWorld  Bank\u2019s  Kecamantan  Development  Project  and  the  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization \ncommunity Integrated Pest Management program will be used extensively in facilitator training. \nThe national NGO will develop the training curriculum and training program during the first year \nof  the  Project.  The  facilitators  will  be  paid  a  salary  through  project  funds  administered  by  the \nnational NGO. However, at the end of the Project, villages themselves are expected to pay the \nsalaries if they recognize the value of facilitators to improving incomes in the village. This will be \nmade clear to the villagers at the beginning of the Project. Also, through the project intervillage \nforum  (PIVF),  villages  are  expected  to  be  able  to  engage  the  appropriate  agencies  to  train \nfacilitators as necessary after the project completion. \n \n6. \n Third,  establish  a  participatory  planning  process  at  the  village  level  to  identify  priority \ninvestments  to  support  innovation.  The  local  NGO  will  work  with  the  facilitator  to  establish \nparticipatory  planning  processes  for  villages  to  identify  priority  investments  to  improve \nagricultural  production  and  market  access.  Guidelines  for  the  process  were  developed  during \nthe project preparatory technical assistance and will be provided to the NGOs. The participatory \nprocess will ensure that group decisions are representative of the needs of the group as a whole \nand  cannot  be  appropriated  by  a  few  powerful  group  members.  The  local  NGO  will  adapt  the \nprocess  for  each  village  after  an  initial  social  assessment  of  the  village  according  to  social \nassessment  guidelines  developed  by  ADB.  The  local  NGOs  will  receive  training  on  preparing \nsocial assessments and designing participatory processes to account for location-specific social \ndynamics  through  the  national  NGO  from  the  participatory  methods  expert  engaged  by  the \nProject.  This  training  will  be  conducted  once  at  the  district  level  in  year  1  of  project \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nimplementation  in  that  district.  Once  this  capacity  has  been  developed  within  local  NGOs,  the \ncapacity  is  expected  to  be  sustained  if  it  is  adopted  in  the  regular  operations  of  these  NGOs. \nThe  process  will  be  discussed  and  endorsed  at  the  district  level  by  all  NGOs  working  in  the \ndistrict.  Also  party  to  this  discussion  will  be  the  gender  specialists  to  be  engaged  through  the \nProject, the participatory methods specialist, and a representative of the national NGO. \n \n7. \nInstitutional Development. This activity will establish the institutions to support farmers \nin  village  planning  and  implementation  of  investments.  These  institutions  will  also  formally \nincorporate  village  planning  into  the  wider  planning  of  the  district  government.  The  activity  will \nconsist of three activities. \n \n8. \nFirst,  through  the  local  NGOs  and  facilitators,  establish,  develop  the  capacity  of,  and \nsupport in each eligible village for a village project investment committee (VPIC). In particular, \nthe Project will, through the local NGOs, train VPIC members in basic investment assessment, \ncash  flow  analysis,  benefit-cost  analysis,  funds  management  and  basic  accounting,  and  basic \nbenefit monitoring and evaluation. The Project will provide the funds for regular meetings of the \nVPIC and through the local NGO provide a budget to the VPIC to perform administrative duties. \nThe operational costs of the VPIC will be borne by the village after project completion. Training \ncosts for VPIC members after project completion will be borne by the district government. \n \nSecond,  support  the  establishment  and  functioning  of  the  PIVF  in  each  subdistrict  in \n9. \nwhich the Project will be implemented. The Project will support the development of operational \nguidelines and procedures for the PIVF; and the development of formats, templates, and other \nmaterials  that  will  be  used  for  screening  and  selecting  village  investments.  Support  will  be \nprovided  to  operate  the  secretariat  of  the  PIVF  through  a  unit  in  the  district  PIU  and  to  hold \nregular  meetings  of  the  PIVF.  In  addition,  a  budget  will  be  provided  for  monitoring  and \nevaluation activities, for verifying the feasibility of proposed village investments as required, to \nallow  village  parliament  members  from  nonparticipating  districts  to  observe  meetings  of  the \nPIVF,  and  for  regular  seminars  and  workshops  for  PIVF  members  to  improve  their \nunderstanding of rural development, information technology, and innovation. \n \n10. \nThird,  through  the  office  of  the  bupati,  and  in  close  coordination  with  the  provincial \nAssessment  Institutes  for  Agricultural  Technology  (BPTP)  and  other  appropriate  provincial \ninstitutions, establish a district coordination committee (DCC) consisting of NGOs, government \nagricultural  technical  staff,  agricultural  educators,  private  and  government  agencies  that  can \nassist \nfacilitators,  and  other \nrepresentatives  of  civil  society  (newspaper  reporters,  advocacy  groups).  In  addition  to  bearing \nthe operational costs of the DCC, the Project will support the development of a district database \nof potential partners for village investments, provide basic training to DCC members in concepts \nof  rural  development,  support  exchange  visits  for  DCC  members  to  visit  other  districts  and \nparticipate  in  meetings  of  other  DCCs,  and  support  the  participation  of  representatives  of \nnonparticipating districts in DCC meetings. \n \n11. \nelements. \n \n12. \nFirst,  provide  support  at  the  village  level  to  all  poor  villages  in  selected  subdistricts  to \nallow the farmer groups to use the established participatory process to prepare village plans that \nidentify and cost investments that will improve agricultural production and market access. Local \nNGOs will work with the village facilitators and appropriate partner agencies selected by farmer \ngroups  to  develop  these  plans.  Links  to  the  partner  agencies  will  be  established  with  the \n\nVillage  Public  Investments  to  Support  Innovation.  This  activity  will  have  three \n\nin  addressing  village-level  constraints,  village \n\nfarmers \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n33 \n\nassistance  of  NGOs  with  support  from  consultants  engaged  by  the  Project.  Village  plans  will \nidentify  investments,  provide  a  cash-flow  analysis  for  the  investments,  a  simple  benefit-cost \nanalysis, technical feasibility, an implementation plan including the sources of external support \nand the costs of this support, and clearly identify beneficiaries of the investments. The plans will \nhave  to  clearly  demonstrate  poverty  impacts  of  the  investments.  Environmental  impact  and \nsocial and gender analysis will be presented in a format finalized at project Inception. NGOs will \nbe  provided  with  a  budget  (through  the  national  NGO  contract)  to  perform  this  assessment \naccording to guidelines established by project preparation consultants engaged by the Project. \n \n13. \nSecond, support the subdistrict-level PIVFs in their evaluation of village investments by \nfinancing the required meetings and providing support through district government agencies for \nverifying the feasibility of the investments as required.  \n \n14. \nThird, support the implementation of investments approved by the PIVFs through direct \ntransfers  of  funds  to  bank  accounts  held  by  VPICs.  Support  VPICs  in  the  implementation  of \ninvestments  through  the  local  NGOs  and  through  government  and  nongovernment  agencies \nthat are part of the DCCs. \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment of National and Local Agricultural Information Resources \n\nThe \n\nInformation  Resources  component  will  support  staffing,  operational  costs, \n\n15. \nequipment, and consultant support for three activities. \n \n16. \nFirst,  upgrade  the  agricultural  market  information  system  of  the  Center  for  Agricultural \nData  and  Information  of  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  to  increase  its  coverage,  frequency  of \nupgrades,  and  scope  of  its  content  to  include  more  general  agricultural  market  information. \nMOA will continue to operate the system after project completion.  \n \nSecond,  develop  a  national  farming  web  site  that  will  become  a  source  of  information \n17. \nand eventually a platform for agricultural trade for importers, investors, traders, processors, and \nothers  who  might  be  interested  in  sourcing  from  or  supplying  to  the  Indonesian  agriculture \nsector. The web site will be hosted on MOA\u2019s server and will be maintained by the Center for \nAgricultural  Data  and  Information.  MOA  will  continue  to  maintain  the  site  after  project \ncompletion.  \n \n18. \nThird, establish information centers within district agricultural offices or the offices of the \nbupati (as determined by the district bupati) from which farmer representatives can access the \nagricultural  information  system,  which  will  function  as  \u201cone-stop-shops\u201d  for  information \nexchange  where  farmer  representatives  can  find  useful  information  relevant  to  innovations  in \nagricultural  production  and  marketing.  District  governments  will  continue  to  support  the \ninformation centers after project completion. \n \nC. \n\nSupport for Agricultural Innovation Development and Dissemination \n\nThe  Innovation  Development  and  Dissemination  component  will  support  selected \n19. \nnational  agricultural  research  institutes  (NARIs)  and  BPTPs  to  develop  and  disseminate \nagricultural technologies relevant to project areas (and for rainfed agriculture in general); and to \ndevelop outreach programs to inform farmers of potential technological innovations to improve \nagricultural  production.  The  Project  will  support  the  Agency  for  Agricultural  Research  and \nDevelopment (AARD) in its efforts to develop upstream research programs specifically targeted \nto  rainfed  and  marginal  areas.  The  Project  will  provide  support  for  backstopping  farmer \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\ninnovations  through  technology  development.  Specifically,  the  Project  will  support  staffing, \noperational costs, equipment, and consultant support for six activities. \n \n20. \nFirst,  identify  technologies  that  are  appropriate  for  the  project  area.  The  Project  will \nsupport a review of the existing shelf of technologies at a selected subset of relevant NARIs and \na  rapid  rural  appraisal  in  project  areas  to  identify  technologies  that  are  appropriate  for  the \nproject area. \n \nSecond,  develop  and  undertake  outreach  programs  for  each  of  the  relevant  NARIs  to \n21. \nmake  farmers  aware  of  the  income  improvement  potential  of  the  relevant  technologies.  One \noutreach program will be developed for all NARIs and modifications will be made to adapt the \nprototype  to  specific  NARIs.  AARD,  through  an  appropriate  work  unit,  will  use  the  outreach \nprogram  as  a  model  and  implement  it  in  BPTPs  and  NARIs  not  covered  by  the  Project \nindependently of the Project. The outreach programs will utilize traditional means of agricultural \ncommunication.  However,  they  will  also  use  information  technology  using  networks  of  MOA. \nSupport will be provided to strengthen these networks through the following specific activities: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nPrepare  and  make  available  in  electronic  format  existing  technical  agricultural \ninformation  that  can  assist  farmers  in  adopting  innovations  in  agricultural \nproduction  and  marketing.  The  Center  for  Agricultural  Library  and  Technology \nDissemination  (CALTD)  will  convert  existing  hardcopy  extension  materials  into \nelectronic  format  and  make  this  available  via  the  Internet  and  CD-ROM.  The \nProject will acquire equipment, train staff, and establish work systems to ensure \nsmooth functioning and sustainability of the unit. Extension materials will include \n(i)  leaflets,  booklets,  and  brochures  produced  by  BPTPs  and  their  predecessor \nagricultural  information  centers;  (ii)  extension  materials  produced  by  projects \nwithin the MOA; (iii) technical guides produced by various directorates-general of \nMOA.  \n\nCapture and make available new information that is of relevance to innovations \nby poor farmers. CALTD will develop a system to capture new publications from \nAARD and other MOA units as the publications are produced and to make them \navailable  through  the  same  interface  as  above.  Initially  this  system  will  likely \nconsist  of  submission  of  documents  via  e-mail  from  the  BPTPs  to  CALTD  for \nprocessing  and  inclusion  in  the  collection.  Eventually,  it  may  consist  of  an \nintegrated document-management system for AARD.  \n\nAssist  the  BPTPs  to  develop  web  sites.  CALTD  will  continue  to  assist  BPTPs \nthroughout  Indonesia  to  develop  web  sites  of  their  own  that  contain  information \nuseful  to  poor  farmers,  extension,  nongovernment  organizations,  the  private \nsector,  and  other  clients  in  their  area.  In  addition,  CALTD  will  hold  a  series  of \nshort training courses for BPTP staff on web design for agricultural development, \nconverting \nformat,  accessing  agricultural \ninformation via the Internet, and improving information-management skills within \nthe BPTPs. \n\nto  a  user-friendly \n\ninformation \n\n \n22. \nThird,  identify  thematic  gaps  in  research  programs  of  NARIs  that  need  to  be  filled  to \nadequately  address  problems  of  rainfed  agriculture.  The  Project  will  support  a  series  of \nworkshops of senior researchers to identify gaps in research programs of relevant NARIs due to \nwhich problems of rainfed areas remain unaddressed in Indonesia. The series of workshops will \nbe  used  to  develop  research  programs  at  NARIs  to  fill  gaps  in  existing  research  programs  in \norder to address problems of rainfed areas.  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n35 \n\n \n23. \nFourth, develop and support specific research programs for marginal rainfed agriculture \nin target NARIs. These programs will be time-bound and will be shown to have clearly identified \nbenefits  for  agriculture  and  rural  development  in  marginal  rainfed  areas  in  general,  but \nspecifically for target areas of the Project. \n \n24. \nFifth, support local initiatives to develop innovations for poor farmers in the target area. \nThe  Project  will  establish  a  fund  to  be  administered  by  the  provincial  BPTPs  in  each  project \nprovince  to  provide  grants  for  developing  innovations  requested  by  farmers.  Each  BPTP  will \nreceive  a  grant  fund.  Universities,  national  and  local  researchers,  field  technicians,  extension \nworkers, the private sector, and NGOs will be eligible to receive grants from this fund. BPTPs \ncan themselves also utilize the funds. Proposals will have to be endorsed by farmer groups as \nmeeting their needs. Proposals will fall in the category of agricultural production innovations or \nagricultural  marketing  innovations,  including  innovations  for  agribusiness.  Decisions  on  the \neligibility of innovation development will be made by the DCC and approved by the director of \nthe BPTP. Upon receiving the funds, the implementation of the innovation development will be \nthe  responsibility  of  the  proposing  agency  and  will  be  monitored  by  village  facilitators  and  the \nBPTP. In most cases the innovation development will involve a pilot test in proposing villages. If \nsuccessful, the innovation development site will serve as a demonstration site. The Project will \nsupport visits to the demonstration site by farmer groups to learn about the innovations. \n \n25. \nSixth,  support  BPTPs  in  organizing  activities  to  encourage  information  and  capacity \ndevelopment  among  district  institutions  and  farmers.  Each  of  the  four  BPTPs  relevant  to  the \ntarget  districts  will  receive  a  fund  to  be  used  with  the  endorsement  of  the  national  steering \ncommittee to undertake exchange visits, training, seminars, farmer field days, farmer fairs, and \nother activities to promote the exchange of information and capacity building. Targets of these \nactivities  will  be  DCC  members,  district  government  staff,  and  farmers  from  target  villages,  as \nwell as nonparticipating villages. \n \nD. \n\nProject Management \n\n26. \nThis  component  will  provide  support  for  the  preparation  of  project  implementation, \nadministrative  support;  and  monitoring  and  supervision  related  to  project  implementation, \nparticularly in relation to the operations of the NGOs. The Project will provide \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nsemiannual meeting costs and a travel budget for a national steering committee \nthat  will  oversee  and  provide  policy  guidance  in  the  coordination  of  project \nimplementation;   \n\nstaffing,  operational  costs,  equipment,  and  consultant  support  for  a  national \nproject  coordination  and  monitoring  unit  to  be  established  in  AARD,  to  prepare \nproject implementation, and to assist the national steering committee throughout \nthe  implementation  period  serving  as  its  secretariat;  in  particular,  support  for \nconsultant  costs  of  preparing  project  reporting  formats;  simple  guidelines  for \npresentation  of  economic,  social,  and  poverty  impact  analysis  in  village \ninvestment  plans;  and  other  project  documents,  and  to  set  up  a  project \nperformance management system; \n\n(iii) \n\nstaffing,  operational  costs,  equipment,  and  consultant  support  for  project \nimplementation  units  to  be  established  within  the  office  of  the  bupati  of  every \ntarget  district;  in  particular,  consultant  and  other  support  for  the  establishment \n\n\fand  operation  of  district  level  modules  of  the  PPMS  to  be  coordinated  with  the \nnational level PPMS; \n\n(iv) \n\nsupport  for  external  audits  and  independent  reviews  of  NGOs  and  village \nimplementation  bodies  by  national  and  local  NGO  consortia,  independent  press \ngroups,  and  government  officials,  and  financial  audits  by  independent  auditors; \nand \n\n(v) \n\nsupport for preparing a project completion report. \n\nDistrict  governments  will  support  the  operational  and  other  costs  of  the  DCCs,  and \n\n36 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n27. \nPIVFs beyond project completion. \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n37 \n\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR VILLAGE INVESTMENTS \n (to be checked by project intervillage forums with the assistance  \nof the project implementation unit as required) \n \n \n\nCriterion \n\nPoverty Impact \n\nVillage investments should \nbenefit mainly poor farmers \n\nDescription \n\nCertified by \n\nIndicators \n\nNongovernment \norganization/village \nfacilitator/beneficiaries \n \n \n \n \nNGO/partner agency \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNGO/village \nfacilitator/ \nbeneficiaries \n \n \n \n \n \n\nNGO/ partner agency/ \ndistrict liaison officer/ \ncompetent local \nexpertise \n(government or \nnongovernment) \n \nNGO/district liaison \nofficer/competent \ngovernment authority \n \n\nParticipation register \nshows that poor \nfarmers participate \nfully in the preparation \nof the investment \nproposals  \n \nSimple cash flow of \ninnovations produced \nand benefits to \ndifferent beneficiaries \nidentified and show \nthat 75% of the \nbenefits from an \ninvestment go to \nfarmers who have \nbeen identified as not \nyet prosperous by \nNational Family \nPlanning Coordinating \nBoard surveys. \n \nA transparent \nmechanism \nestablished by \nconsensus to resolve \nconflicts in the use of \nthe investment is \naccepted by all \nbeneficiaries. \n \nInvestment designs \nand profiles of \ninnovations certified \nby relevant competent \nauthority as to their \ntechnical feasibility. \n\nInvestment designs \nand profiles of \ninnovations certified \nby relevant \ngovernment authority \nshow no unacceptable \nadverse impacts. \n \n \n \n\nTechnical \n\nInvestments and ensuing \ninnovations should be \ntechnically feasible. \n\nEnvironmental \n\nNo adverse impacts to the \nenvironment will be caused by \nthe investments or the ensuing \ninnovations. \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nCriterion \n\nDescription \n\nCertified by \n\nIndicators \n\nFinancial \n\nInnovations result in higher \nand more stable agricultural \nprofitability. \n\nNGO/partner agency/ \ncompetent local \nexpertise \n \n\nGender Impact \n\nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\nThe investment plan is gender \nsensitive.

In \ngeneral,  the  Project  will  involve  (i)  enhancing  farmer  capacity  for  agricultural  improvement, \nwhich will develop the capacity of farmer groups to identify and address agricultural production \nand  marketing  constraints,  and  provide  necessary  infrastructures  to  improve  agriculture \nproductivity;  (ii)  developing  national  and  local  information  resources;  and  (iii)  developing \ninnovations for improving agriculture production.    \n \nC. \n \n3. \nphysical characteristics recorded from those village plans will provide a sketch of the variation. \n \n\nFour  villages  in  two  provinces  were  appraised  at  the  IEE  stage  and  the  particular \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n1. \n\nBale Village \n\n4. \nBale village is located about 50 kilometers (km) northeast of the administrative center of \nPalu  in  Central  Sulawesi.  It  lies  in  a  narrow  valley  drained  by  a  stream  flowing  west  from  the \nsteep  mountain  range  that  forms  the  spine  of  the  northern  peninsular  joining  central  to  north \nSulawesi. The steep slopes and instability of the geological formations have combined to cause \nsevere local stream-bank erosion. The topography of this area is gently to moderately sloping, \nbut rises steeply onto the confining hills and mountains in the east. Within the village, there is \nlittle flat land (20%). Most is either sloping (30%) or steep and mountainous (50%).  \n \n5. \nThe  valley  floor  was  developed  previously  as  a  coconut  plantation,  and  the  original \nlowland  rainforest  has  been  extensively  cleared.  Minor  remnants  of  forest  remain  in  some \ndrainage  lines  on  the  confining  steep  hillslopes,  but  these  are  under  pressure  from  shifting \nagriculture.  Plantation  remnants  remain,  while  the  stand  has  elsewhere  been  thinned  or \nremoved to provide for housing and cropping. \n \nSmall fishponds have been dug in a few locations but the presence of cobble layers in \n6. \nthe soils will limit where permanent pond locations are possible. The only wildlife now reported \nfrom  the  village,  apart  from  domestic  cattle,  are  wild  pigs  and  monkeys  that  are  pests  of  the \ncultivated crops and coconuts respectively. There are 1,128 people living in 301 households. Of \nthe  working  age  population  of  766  adults,  98%  are  farmers  involved  in  field  cropping,  rainfed \npaddy rice, and cattle grazing. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  Based  on  the  Indonesian  Environmental  Regulation  on  Environmental  Assessment  particularly  the  Ministerial \n\nDecree No. 3 of 2000, this proposed project does not require an environmental impact assessment report. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n67 \n\n2. \n\nPili Makuzawa Village \n\n7. \nPili  Makuzawa  village  lies  about  100  km  south  of  Palu  on  the  Gumbasa  River,  which \nflows in one of a number of rift valleys that lie between steep mountain ridges that comprise this \nregion  of  Sulawesi.  The  river  system  has  a  high  gradient,  carries  a  heavy  bedload  and \ndischarges into the ocean at Palu. The mountains to the east of much of the access road to Pili \nMakuzawa  village  comprise  the  217,000-hectare  Lore  Lindu  National  Park  that  is  still \nextensively  forested.  The  geology  is  complex  in  that  the  mountains  have  been  steeply  folded \nand  the  bedded  fine  metamorphics  and  interbedded  soft  conglomerate  beds  form  unstable \nslopes, with one massive recent landslide along a ridge crest in the primary forest itself. \n \n8. \nThe  rainfall  is  seasonal  with  about  2,000  millimeter  (mm)  at  the  village,  although  this \nvaries  with  altitude,  so  seasonal  runoff  and  hence  erodibility  and  flooding  in  the  river  is \ninfluenced  by  the  mountain  regime.  While  mountains  in  the  park  have  an  altitude  up  to  2,280 \nmeters,  the  valley  floor  at  the  village  is  about  380  meters,  but  cocoa  plantations  have  been \nestablished  in  foothills  up  to  700  meters.  This  is  a  prior  land  use  that  is  the  subject  of \ncontroversy between villagers and the administrators of the National Park. \n \nSeven  forest  ecosystems  have  been  described2  in  Lore  Lindu  National  Park,  and  the \n9. \nmain  lower  montane  forest  has  traditionally  been  important  as  a  source  of  forest  products, \nespecially  rattan.  The  continuing  exploitation  of  this  resource  is  again  a  point  of  controversy \nbetween park administration and villages along the edge of the park. The park itself is important \nfor its fauna3, including unique mammals (dwarf buffalo, pig deer, an endemic macaque, palm \ncivet)  and  two  species  of  marsupial  cuscus.  The  park  also  hosts  194  species  of  land  birds \nincluding  66  species  endemic  to  Sulawesi.  The  birds  include  the  red-knobbed  hornbill  with  a \nwing span of over a meter, while six nesting grounds of the Maleo are known, where the ground \nbird  lays  its  large  egg  in  sand  heated  and  hatched  by  underground  hot  springs.  The  park  is \nlisted  as  a  Man  and  the  Biosphere  Reserve  by  the  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and \nCultural  Organization,  and  this  Project  will  take  particular  care  to  avoid  activities  that  could \nexacerbate existing impacts and controversies mainly along the park perimeters.  \n \n\n3. \n\nCaruban Village \n\n10. \nCaruban village is located 117 km from the Central Java capital, Semarang and is 8 km \nnorth the city of Temanggung. Rainy season of about six months begins in November making \nthis region one of the more reliable rainfall areas, although still only sufficient for a single rainfed \nrice  crop  in  the  absence  of  irrigation.    The  area  is  typical  of  villages  in  this  densely  populated \nregion of Central Java where much of the land has been terraced for agriculture and no original \nforest remains. The tree cover on upland areas comprises fast-growing pioneers such as Cassia \nand Albizzia species with low shrub undergrowth. No original wildlife remains. \n \n\n4. \n\nKlepu Village \n\n11. \nKlepu village is located 78 km from the capital city of Central Java, Semarang, 9 km from \nthe  district  capital  Temanggung.  Most  of  the  land  is  classed  as  upland,  on  a  midslope  area \nforming  part  of  an  extensive  apron  below  prominent  dormant  volcanoes.  The  land  is  almost \nentirely  terraced,  and  most  is  used  for  a  single  rainfed  rice  crop  during  the  wet  season  from \n\n                                                 \n2  The  Nature  Conservancy  (2000)  Vegetation  Mapping:  Lore  Lindu  National  Park.

Indonesia Program Information Sheet SPP 1. \n\n\f68 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nNovember  to  May,  with  dryland  mixed  cropping  subsequently.  There  is  no  formal  irrigation \navailable.  The  land  has  been  almost  completely  altered  by  terracing  and  farm-related  activity. \nNo forest and wild animals remain. The streams are reliable, although dry season flows are low. \nKlepu  village  has  2,511  inhabitants  (1,248  men  and  1,263  women)  living  in  about  617 \nhouseholds. There are 110 landless households involved in fattening and raising cattle, but only \nas sharecroppers. The village is pioneering the environmentally positive production of compost \nusing stall-fed cattle. \n \nD. \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n12. \nThe village plans, from these sample project areas, have identified a number of activities \nor  subprojects,  such  as  (i)  construction  of  village  to  market  road  links;  (ii)  provision  for  better \ncommunications,  training,  extension,  and  finance  fund  management,  which  could  involve  the \nconstruction of suitable buildings; (iii) upgrading of, or installation of new local irrigation systems; \nand (iv) introduction of new and better seeds and livestock including cattle, goats, and in some \nareas, pigs that could involve the construction of stalls.   \n \n13. \nNo  major  impacts  are  associated  with  the  design,  construction,  or  operation  of  the \nproposed subproject. Most of the impacts are associated with infrastructure developments that \nare associated with rehabilitation and improvement of  local roads and irrigation systems.  \n \n14. \nThe  potential  impacts  of  road  rehabilitation  and  improvement  into  village  fringe  areas \nwhere  shifting  agriculture  is  practiced  can  be  high,  and  exceed  direct  impacts  from  logging  or \nforest product harvesting. The most dangerous will occur from burning, if others are induced to \nfollow. The geology of the dry areas is commonly such that there is fragile soil and burning can \nirreversibly destroy stable vegetation. Therefore, road rehabilitation carried out within the Project \nwill  have  to  meet  the  general  criterion,  to  eventually  make  upper  slope  shifting  agriculture \nunattractive  for  villagers.  The  mitigation  measures  for  road  rehabilitation  and  improvement  will \ninclude (i) adherence to simple safety and operating procedures to limit and contain discarding \nof fuel, oil, and solid debris from servicing equipment; (ii) adherence to designed road locations; \n(iii)  adherence  to  a  designed  strategy  for  containing  and  spreading  spoil  to  avoid  dangerous \nstockpiling;  and  (iv)  adherence  to  the  designed  locations  and  specifications  of  culverts \ndischarging storm water. \n \n15. \nDams  and  canals  must  be  constructed  to  the  specifications  developed  for  each \nindividual  site,  and  the  location  of  each  structure  has  to  be  confirmed  by  the  project  manager \nand the civil engineer before construction begins. Impacts arising from a small dam failure can \ninclude death and the destruction of downstream property in addition to the value of losses of \nthe structure, contained fish, lost crop, and lost future crop potential. \n \nSome  village  plans  include  increasing  livestock  numbers  as  a  significant  component. \n16. \nAdequate  preparation  is  required  before  a  large  increase  in  herd  size  can  be  accommodated \nwithin the village framework. In particular, feed must be planted at least 2, and up to 6 months \nbefore livestock are obtained to ensure there is sufficient to eat. Fencing has to be adequate to \ncontain the animals if they are not in stalls with provision for fresh water and fodder. Should any \none of these requirements not be met, monetary loss is likely flowing from degeneration in the \nherd  and  secondary  impacts  on  adjacent  lands  on  to  which  livestock  are  turned  out.  The \ntechnical  service  groups  will  be  responsible  for  making  recommendations  for  village  plans  to \naddress these issues and for village plans to then implement the required measures. \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n69 \n\nVillage  plans  that  provide  for  the  introduction  of  new  stock  or  the  rapid  building  up  of \n17. \nexisting herd sizes are vulnerable to endemic and exotic diseases, and veterinary services are \ncommonly sporadic and expensive. A required veterinary backup should be in place before any \nmajor expansion in herd numbers occurs, and at least low-level animal health training should be \nincorporated into the plan for key farmers. Those villages that are in regions with a marked dry \nseason  will  also  face  a  potential  impact  damaging  for  the  stock  from  dry  season  fires  that \ndeplete pasture availability at the most susceptible time. Village control over burning, helped by \na  general  interest  in  establishing  better  herds,  is  the  method  with  best  potential  for  controlling \nfires. \n \n18. \nVillagers traditionally coexist with wild pigs and monkeys, which are both locally serious \npests.  The  village  plans  that  include  the  construction  of  pest-proof  fences  expect  to  achieve \nbenefits by keeping the animals away from enclosed crop areas. If the plan leads to the planting \nof  susceptible  crops,  regular  maintenance  of  the  fences  and  reinforcing  of  weak  areas  will  be \nneeded to maintain the barriers.  \n \nE. \n\nInstitutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program \n\n19. \nThe  responsibility  for  mitigating  adverse  impacts  rests  ultimately  with  the  project \nmanager, but the effectiveness and timeliness of mitigation procedures will be enhanced if these \nrequirements are discussed with village groups as part of the consultative process. The project \nmanager  and  civil  engineer  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring  that  village  people  engaged  in \nnonfamiliar work are taught how to identify safety hazards and engage in safe working habits. \nNational safety standard posters and displays can be used for the purpose. \n \n20. \nVillage  groups  assisted  by  technical  support  will  develop  village  plans,  and  the  Project \nwill provide funds to implement those plans. All planning will be participatory, and in developing \nvillage plans, the groups will also propose mitigation procedures and identify responsible parties \nto  monitor  the  impacts.  Therefore,  a  sensible  approach  to  raising  environmental  awareness  in \nthe Project must be developed by integrating environmental assessments into the village plan, \ninstead  of  imposing  another  layer  of  planning  on  the  process.  The  village  plans  interpret \nphysical  characteristics,  rather  than  provide  technical  data  for  independent  variables  (for \ninstance, for rainfall, evaporation, soil, etc.) so the precision of data may be less than that of a \ndetailed  environmental  study.  Introducing  the  assessment  of  risk  as  part  of  village  plan \ndevelopment through health and safety would also make the environmental concept easier to be \nappreciated  by  the  farmers.  The  information  available  is  expected  to  be  sufficient  to  use  as  a \nbasis for assessing any impact associated with the proposed local investment.  In this context, \nthe  role  of  the  technical  support  (including  trainers  and  NGOs)  to  produce  \u201cenvironmentally \nsound village plans\u201d is very important.     \n \nF. \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\n21. \nThe IEE of the sample subprojects in four sample project areas has shown that no major \nimpacts  will  arise  from  the  Project.  However,  it  recommends  that  the  Project  (i)  should  not \nprovide funding for developing a new road; (ii) should not provide funding for any physical work \nor  physical  intervention  in  areas  categorized  as  sensitive  areas  if  no  comprehensive \nenvironmental  assessment  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  and  the  Government\u2019s  guidelines  on \nenvironmental  assessment  are  to  be  carried  out;  (iii)  should  be  able  to  provide  competent \nservice  providers  capable  of  offering  environmental  awareness  courses  as  part  of  the  training \npackage for other service providers and farmer group leaders; and (iv)  should be able to  link \n\n\f70 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nenvironment,  health  and  safety  as  a  key  approach  for  all  future  training,  monitoring  and \nmitigation programs undertaken within the Project. \n \nG. \n\nConclusion \n\nthe  overall \n\ntraining  programs,  and \n\n22. \nThe  IEE  has  shown  that  no  major  impacts  will  arise  from  the  Project  that  warrant \nexamination  by  a  full  environmental  impact  assessment.  The  scope  of  the  Project  does  not \ntrigger  a  requirement  for  a  similar  comprehensive  examination  under  Indonesian  law.  It  has \nshown that the aims of the Project can be achieved by providing awareness courses compatible \nwith \nincrease \nenvironmental awareness. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nimplementing  simple  monitoring \n\nto \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n71 \n\nPOVERTY IMPACT ASSESSMENT \n \n\nBenefits \n\nA. \n \nThe Project will provide community development to enhance the ability of groups of poor \n1. \nfarmers to identify and resolve common problems during and after project implementation. This \nprocess  will  also  increase  the  capacity  of  local  and  regional  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs)  to  support  farmers  in  group  organizations  and  provide  access  to  problem  solving \nservices.  This  NGO  capacity  will  help  target  villages,  districts,  and  other  areas  in  which  they \noperate. Government capacity will increase through the development of market and technology \ninformation  dissemination  systems.  Such  capacity-building  benefits  are  major  objectives  for \nwhich inputs are identifiable, but outputs and outcomes cannot be predicted with accuracy. \n \n2. \nThe  Support  for  Agricultural  Innovation  Development  and  Dissemination  component \npromotes  a  demand-driven  focus  for  research  and  development  on  location-specific  needs  of \npoor farmers, typically in marginal rainfed areas underrepresented in past government research \nand development. Quantifiable benefits of innovations adopted by poor farmers reduce poverty \nthrough  higher  productivity,  reduced  costs,  diversification  to  higher-value  agriculture  and/or \nimproved  market  orientation.  Assessing  such  benefits  at  the  design  stage  is  difficult  and \nspeculative,  especially  before  research  assessment  and  planning  is  undertaken  in  the  first \npreparatory  year  of  the  Project.  However,  most  studies  of  the  economic  impact  of  research \nshow highly positive returns, and technological innovations from such research are an example \nof  the  public  goods  sought  by  the  Project  to  create  nonexclusionary  benefits  to  improve  poor \nfarmers\u2019 incomes. \n \n3. \nThe  Farmer  Empowerment  component\u2019s  village  funds  will  finance  parts  of  the  planned \ninvestments that meet required criteria, up to a maximum level of funding. This is the major use \nof project funds, but as part of the input to empower poor farmers rather than being the primary \nobjective.  The  investments  will  give  quantifiable  benefits  of  improved  incomes  and  economic \ndevelopment.  However,  in  participatory  processes,  farmer  groups  and  communities  select \nactivities,  so  outputs  and  outcomes  are  uncertain.  This  is  inevitable  when  beneficiaries  are \ndecisions  makers  rather  than  implementers  of  top-down  decisions.  Village  plans  developed  in \nproject  preparation  have  been  analyzed  to  demonstrate  viability  of  the  process  at  the  village \nlevel and details of the analyses are included in a supplementary appendix.1 Proposals include \naccess  roads,  small-scale  irrigation,  farmer  credit/cooperative  groups,  livestock  breeding,  tree \ncrop  nurseries,  and  \u201cliving  fences.\u201d  Analyses  show  viability  of  the  process  and  investment \nproposals, as with research and development, for confidence of viability rather than for detailed \nprediction of economic returns. \n \nB. \n \n4. \nThe  Handbook  for  Integrating  Poverty  Impact  in  Economic  Analysis  of  Project\u2019  of  the \nAsian Development Bank sets out a methodology for assessing poverty impact, best applied to \nclearly defined inputs and outputs. Community-based participatory processes lack such simple \ndefinitions. The handbook notes that, even with clearly defined inputs and outputs, assessment \nis hampered by imprecision in assigning shares to the poor and nonpoor. This Project has high \nprecision in targeting the poor to assign benefits to the poor and nonpoor. \n \n\nPoverty Impact \n\n                                                 \n1   Supplementary Appendix: Financial and Economic Analysis of Village Plan Proposals. \n\n\f72 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nNational  Socioeconomic  Survey  (SUSENAS)  data  of  the  Central  Bureau  of  Statistics \n5. \ngives  nationwide  data  for  application  of  poverty  selection  criteria  with  the  three  yearly \nexpenditure  survey  having  the  most  detail.  The  survey  measures  consumption  by  prices  and \nquantities  of  food  and  nonfood  consumption,  allowing  estimation  of  calories  consumed  and  a \npoverty  definition  based  on  a  2,100  kilocalorie  diet  and  a  standard  nonfood  bundle.  The  most \nrecent  survey,  in  1999,  is  reviewed  in  ADB\u2019s  Poverty  Assessment  for  Indonesia  in  20002. \nSelected  results  are  summarized  in  Table  A14.1.  The  national  poverty  rate  was  assessed  at \n23.3%,  rural  poverty  at  26.0%,  and  poverty  in  agriculture  at  39.7%\u2014the  highest  of  any \neconomic sector. \n \n\nTable A14.1: National Level Poverty Rates \n \nPoverty Rate \n23.3% \n26.0% \n39.7% \n\nArea \nTotal Indonesia \nRural Areas \nAgriculture \nSource: National Socioeconomic Survey, 1999. \n\n% of Total Poor \n100.0% \n67.4% \n58.4% \n\n \n6. \nThe  survey  also  assesses  expenditure  by  household  quintiles,  shown  in  Table  A14.2. \nThe poorest quintile has 24.6% of the population, similar to the 23.3% national poverty rate. The \npoverty impact assessment in this appendix uses this coincidence to assign 12.1% of national \nGovernment  costs  to  the  poor,  based  on  the  lowest  household  quintile\u2019s  share  in  expenditure \nrather than using a head count figure. \n \n\nTable A14.2: Distribution of Expenditure by Household Quintiles: 1999 \n \n\nArea \n\nQ1 \n\nQ3 \n% Pop\u2019n  % Exp  % Pop\u2019n  % Exp  % Pop\u2019n % Exp  % Pop\u2019n % Exp  % Pop\u2019n % Exp \n34.7\n\n20.9 \n\n21.6 \n\n24.6 \n\n18.2\n\n15.8\n\n14.9\n\n17.4\n\n19.8\n\nQ4 \n\nQ2 \n\nQ5 \n\n12.1 \n\nIndonesia \nSource: National Socioeconomic Survey, 1999. \n \n7. \nfound in every province, making provincial poverty targeting ineffective: \n \n\nSurvey data show that inequality exists in every province and that poor farmers can be \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\npoverty  rates  differ  much  less  between  provinces  than  between  districts  within \nprovinces: rich North Sumatera has 18.9% poverty but includes Nias district with \n46.3%; poor NTT has 26.8% poverty but includes Kupang district with only 9.4%;  \n\n55%  of  Indonesia\u2019s  poor  and  some  of  the  poorest  districts  are  in  Java,  and  are \nneighbors of some of the richest districts, while some outer provinces have few \npoor, lower poverty rates, and none of the poorest districts. \n\n  \n8. \nThus, targeting must be at the district level or lower, and this can be achieved at low cost \nusing  existing  survey  data.  SUSENAS  data  can  be  used  for  district  level  targeting  and  the \nconsumption module survey of 65,000 households every 3 years provides a cost effective way \nto  do  this.  However,  large  differences  in  poverty  exists  within  districts  and  the  size  of  districts \ncan  lead  to  substantial  leakage  of  benefits  to  the  nonpoor.  Thus,  targeting  below  the  district \n\n                                                 \n2   ADB. 2000.  Poverty Assessment for Indonesia. Manila, provides a discussion of the poverty data and guidelines \nfor poverty-oriented policy and project design. The sections on agriculture are particularly relevant to this Project \nand provide a framework within which the Project can be seen as part of a coherent strategy. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n73 \n\nlevel  is  desirable,  but  the  SUSENAS  sample  size  and  cluster  sampling  technique  does  not \nproduce consistently significant statistics below the district level. \n \n9. \nThe Central Bureau of Statistics\u2019 PODES (Village Potential) survey covers all villages as \na census rather than sample, drawing data from several sources. The most recent PODES is for \n2000 and poverty data for target districts is summarized in a supplementary appendix. Setting a \ndefinition  of  a  poor  village  at  40%  or  more  poor  households,3  the  5  target  districts  have  64 \nsubdistricts of which only 1 appears to have no village with 40% or more of poor households. \nOnly in 44% of subdistricts are all the villages poor, while in 55% of subdistricts there is a mix of \npoor and nonpoor villages, averaging 80% but ranging from 8% to 98%. \n \n10. \nAt  the  extreme,  in  Marawola  subdistrict  in  Donggala,  45%  of  households  are  poor  and \nover  58%  of  villages  have  over  40%  poor  households,  but  this  poor  subdistrict  includes  two \nvillages with 100% poor households and two villages with no poor households. Village targeting \nis needed for effective poverty focus, while subdistrict targeting will incur substantial leakage to \nthe nonpoor, and district or provincial poverty targeting is likely to have little meaning. \n \n11. \nProject targeting based on villages with at least 40% of poor households gives the list of \n1,000  villages  ranked  in  the  supplementary  appendix  based  on  the  2000  PODES  data.  Table \nA14.3  summarizes  the  village  data  to  the  district  level,  showing  that  the  proportion  of  poor \nvillages ranges from 47% in Donggala to 75% in East Lombok with an overall 66% of villages in \nthe  five  districts  classified  as  poor.  Village  targeting  gives  75%  poor  households  in  the  target \n1,000 villages, 93% of all the poor households in the five districts. Such targeting uses available, \npublished data and is highly cost effective. \n \n\nTable A14.3: Poverty Populations and Rates in Project Districts and Sub-Districts \n \n\nName \n\nPopulation \n\nTotal \nHouseholds \n\nPraKS&KSI Poor Households \n\nVillages \n\nNo. \n\n% \n\nRange of Villages \nMax % Min % Factor \n\nTotal \n\nPoor \n\n% \n\nBlora \nTemanggung \nEast Lombok \nEnde \nDonggala \n\n    819,328 \n    672,545 \n    967,579 \n    231,572 \n    696,135 \nTotal   3,387,159 \n 2,760,016 \n81% \n\n     207,975 \n     157,913 \n     227,254 \n      46,029 \n     154,119 \n     793,290 \n     650,428 \n82% \n\n 149,702 \n   96,559 \n 170,966 \n   31,458 \n   72,251 \n 520,936 \n 484,866 \n93%\n\nTarget Villages \nTarget % \nSource: PODES 2000, Central Bureau of Statistics, Jakarta \n \n12. \npublished, low-cost data, including \n \n\n72% 100%\n61% 100%\n75% 100%\n68% 100%\n47% 100%\n66% 100%\n75% 100%\n\n4% 23.55 \n3% 38.23 \n3.73 \n7.91 \n\n27%\n13%\n\n0% n.a. \n0% n.a. \n\n40%\n\n2.53 \n \n\n    295 \n    288 \n    109 \n    172 \n    370 \n 1,234 \n 1,000 \n81% \n\n    268 \n    231 \n    106 \n    156 \n    239 \n 1,000 \n 1,000 \n100%\n\n91%\n80%\n97%\n91%\n65%\n81%\n100%\n\nDuring  the  first  year  of  the  Project  the  targeting  can  be  refined  further  using  available \n\n(i) \n\nFamily  Planning  Agency  (BKKBN)  measures  of  family  prosperity  using  tests, \nsuch as: ability to eat two meals per day; minimum two sets of clothes; ability to \neat meat, eggs or fish once per week; and floor space per family member; this is \navailable for every village from the Central Bureau of Statistics; and \n\n                                                 \n3   PODES data is concerned with households while SUSENAS data predominantly assesses poverty on a per capita \nbasis.  Table  A14.2  shows  the  poorest  20%  of  households  as  home  to  24.6%  of  the  population,  indicating  poor \nhouseholds  are  larger  than  average.  Thus,  the  40%  of  households  adopted  as  a  definition  for  poor  villages \nprobably indicates a poor village population closer to 50%. Conservatively, this poverty analysis does not allow for \nthe larger size of poor households so understates the poverty impact. \n\n\f74 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n(ii) \n\nvillage  infant  malnutrition  data  from  local  government  health  stations  monthly \nweighing of most babies; Ministry of Health annual sampling of some 1.9 million \ninfants. \n\n \nFrom  these  statistics,  the  simple  head-count  share  of  the  poor  in  the  populations  are  \n13. \n(i)  based  on  PODES,  75%  of  beneficiary  households  are  poor;  (ii)  based  on  PODES,  66%  of \nhouseholds in target districts are poor; and (iii) based on SUSENAS, the poor\u2019s share of central \nGovernment finance is 12.1% based on their share of expenditure. However, the 75% of poor \nhouseholds among beneficiaries understates the poverty impact of the Project \n \n14. \nADB\u2019s poverty analysis, costs are distributed by net present values of investment cash \nflows,  but  while  village  plan  benefits  are  assumed  to  go  to  farmers,  most  of  the  costs  are \nincurred by national and district governments in which the poor have smaller shares, indicated \nin  the  statistics.  Government  receives  some  taxes,  but  its  major  role  is  to  pay  project \ndevelopment  and  operational  costs  and  repay  the  loan,  representing  a  transfer  from  tax \npayments\u2014of  which  only  12.1%  is  paid  by  the  poor\u2014to  the  beneficiaries,  of  whom  75%  are \npoor. The ratios used in ADB\u2019s poverty analysis are \n \n\n(i) \n\npoverty  impact  ratio,  the  ratio  of  the  net  benefits  to  the  poor  to  the  total  net \nbenefits; and \n\n(ii) \n\nthe net benefits to the poor as a ratio to project cost. \n\n \n15. \nThe combination of high share of the poor in benefits and low share in costs suggests \nhigh poverty impact. If the economic returns resulting from quantifiable but uncertain benefits of \nvillage plans are in the range of 15% to 20%, as expected, then the poverty impact ratio will be \nin the range of 3.7 to 1.8, falling as overall net present value rises to increase the denominator \nin the formula. Over a similar range, the ratio of net benefits of the poor to the present value of \nproject costs would rise from about 66% to 91%, as benefits rise in relation to the fixed project \ncosts.  Village  investment  proposals  reviewed  suggest  typical  financial  returns  to  village \ninvestments  of  the  order  of  25%  to  give  project  economic  returns  providing  a  poverty  impact \nratio  of  the  order  or  2.5  and  a  ratio  of  net  benefits  to  the  poor  at  some  74%  of  project  costs. \nAlthough  uncertain  in  detail,  the  range  suggests  the  Project  is  soundly  poverty  focused,  and \nefficient and effective in delivering benefits to the poor. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n", " \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of November 2001) \n", "Currency Unit\nRp1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "rupiah (Rp) \n$ 0.0001          \nRp 10,000 \n", " \nABBREVIATIONS \n", "AARD \nADB \nBAPPENAS \n", "BIPP \n", "BPTP \n", "CADI \nCOS \nDCC \nIEE \nM&E \nMIS \nMOA \nNARI \nNGO \nNSC \nPAATP \nPCMU \nPIU \nPIVF \nPPMS \nSUSENAS \n", "TA \nVPIC \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Agency for Agricultural Research and Development \nAsian Development Bank \nBadan Perencanaan Pembangunan Nasional  \n(National Development Planning Agency) \nBalai Informasi Penyuluhan Pertanian \n(Information Center for Agricultural Extension) \nBalai Pengkajian Teknologi Pertanian  \n(Assessment Institutes for Agricultural Technology) \nCenter for Agricultural Data and Information  \ncountry operational strategy  \ndistrict coordination committee \ninitial environment examination \nmonitoring and evaluation \nmanagement information system \nMinistry of Agriculture \nnational agriculture research institute \nnongovernmental organization \nnational steering committee \nParticipatory Development of Agricultural Technology Project \nproject coordination and monitoring unit \nproject implementation unit \nproject intervillage forum \nproject performance management system \nSurvei Sosial Ekonomi Nasional  \n(National Socioeconomic Survey) \ntechnical assistance \nVillage Project Investment Committee \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December. \n", "(ii) \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", "CONTENTS \n \n", "MAP \n", "I. \n", "II. \n", "III. \n", "IV. \n", "V. \n", "VI. \n", "LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY \n", "THE PROPOSAL \n", "INTRODUCTION \n", "BACKGROUND \nA. \nB. \nC. \nD. \n", "Sector Description \nLessons Learned \nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy \nPolicy Dialogue \n", "Rationale \n", "THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA. \nB.
