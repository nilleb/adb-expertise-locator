I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) a proposed grant, both to Nepal for the Bagmati River Basin Improvement Project. \nThe report also describes proposed administration of technical assistance (TA) to be provided \nby the Multi-Donor Trust Fund1 under the Water Financing Partnership Facility, and if the Board \napproves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under the  authority  delegated to me  by  the  Board, \napprove the TA. \n \n2.  The project will complement ongoing efforts of the Government of Nepal and civil society \nto improve water management and the river environment in the Bagmati River Basin (BRB). The \nproject will invest in forming a river basin organization with adequate capacity and decision \nsupport  systems  for  integrated  water  resources  management  (IWRM).  It  will  finance  the \nconstruction of upstream water storage, riverbed oxygenating weirs, riverbank beautification, \nand community initiatives to improve the river environment in Kathmandu Valley.2  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The BRB has significant cultural and economic values for the people of Nepal. The \nBagmati river water is considered holy and is used for cultural and ritual ceremonies practiced at \nthe many significant temples along the river\u2019s banks. The river flows through Kathmandu Valley, \nwhich is the administrative and economic center of the country as well as Nepal\u2019s gateway for \ntourism. It provides most of the city\u2019s drinking water in its upper basin, hydropower generation in \nthe middle basin, and large-scale irrigation in the lower basin. \n \n4.  The  BRB  is  considered  the  most  water-stressed  basin  in  Nepal  with  (i)  declining \navailable water resources due to natural and anthropogenic causes, (ii) significant increases in \nfreshwater demand from the expanding population and industry sector, and (iii) a continuous \nneed for irrigated agriculture. The rapid and unplanned expansion of Kathmandu City has \nplaced  tremendous  pressure  on  water  resources  of  the  upper  BRB.  In  the  absence  of \nappropriate solid waste and wastewater management, the river has become the main waste \ncollector  drain  and  now  carries  high  fecal  contamination,  pathogenic  bacteria,  and \nphysicochemical pollutants. The absence of effective pollution control measures is causing \nserious health hazards for local residents, livestock, and aquatic flora and fauna. The physical \ndeterioration of the riverine environment has led to a loss of cultural and recreational amenities \nfor local communities that no longer respect or cherish the river environment.  \n \n5.  Rapid urbanization has also increased demand on the valley\u2019s water supply distribution. \nDuring dry season, about 80% of the upper Bagmati River flow is diverted for domestic use \nleaving very little for irrigation and other sectors, including the environment. Current utilization of \nsurface water is only 10% of the annual river runoff because of the lack of water storage \nfacilities.  As  a  result, municipalities,  individuals,  and  companies  extract groundwater  at  an \nunsustainable rate, estimated to be 4 to 5 times higher than the natural recharge. The water \ntable has retreated by 35 meters (m) since 1993. The situation is aggravated by the conversion \nof recharge areas into residential areas and upstream catchment degradation. In Kathmandu \nValley, the river is biologically dead; the remaining discharge is mainly heavily polluted sewage \n                                                \n1  Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. \n2  ADB. 2011.

", "2 \nwater  that  endangers  the  health  of  the  capital\u2019s  population  and  downstream  water  users, \nespecially the poor and vulnerable households. Throughout the basin, frequent floods and \nriverbank erosion are the main threat to infrastructure and people\u2019s lives and livelihoods.  \n \n6.  The planning, development, and management of water resources in the BRB have been \ngenerally ad hoc, uncoordinated, and reactive. Government agencies have operated in isolation \nleading to ineffective investments and inequitable allocation of water for human needs and \nproductive use, including the environment. This hampers the government\u2019s development efforts \nto  improve  water  security  in  the  basin.  The  government  recognizes  the  importance  of \naddressing these problems by moving away from a silo-management approach and the need to \nembrace the principles of IWRM.3 The current Water Resources Act (1993) has sought to \nquantify  existing  use  and  allocation  rights.4 Subsequent  strategy  and  planning  documents \nrecognize  the  importance  of  IWRM  and  established  the  need  for  holistic  and  systematic \nmanagement  and  development  of  water  resources.5 They  also  commit  to  conservation  of \nresources and protection of the environment. The Bagmati River Basin Improvement Project will \nsupport the development of appropriate legal and institutional frameworks to operationalize the \nIWRM approach and develop a model that can be replicated in other basins of the country.  \n7.  In 2009, the government approved the Bagmati Action Plan, 2009\u20132014 to address the \npoor state of the upper BRB.6 The plan\u2019s vision is for \u201ca clean, green and healthy river system \nthat is full of life and valued by all.\u201d The plan provides a long list of interventions that collectively \naim  to  restore  and  conserve  the  river  health7 in  Kathmandu  Valley.  The  High  Powered \nCommittee for the Integrated Development of the Bagmati Civilization (HPCIDBC) is already \nimplementing some of these, but lack of capacity and funds means that many of the plan\u2019s \nrecommendations have not yet been implemented. The government has also sought to address \ndrinking water scarcity and improve wastewater management in Kathmandu Valley through \nseveral Asian Development Bank (ADB)-financed projects.8 While these projects will address \nimmediate human needs, they do not resolve other critical priorities of the basin inhabitants or \nprovide a long-term sustainable management framework for the BRB.  \n \n8.  Such priorities were identified and developed under a capacity development TA that \nstrategically assessed current and planned interventions from a river-basin perspective.9 The TA \nproduced a basin strategic investment road map and initiated studies aimed at resolving critical \npriorities. In particular, it produced a water balance and quality model to assess interventions \nrequired to restore the health of the upper Bagmati River and achieve bathing standards at \nPashnupatinath and Gokarna temples. Interventions identified include (i) physical restoration of \nthe urban riparian environment and social mobilization to reconnect riverine communities with \ntheir river, (ii) increase of river-water availability during the dry season to increase the river\u2019s \n                                                \n3  Silo management approach refers to an approach where each water user sector develops plans to utilize water in \nisolation, without considering the impact on other sectors\u2019 requirements. \n4  The act provided only 18 months to assess existing water rights. As the assessment could not be completed within \nthis period, subsequently water use could not be managed or monitored, or allocations enforced. \n5  Government of Nepal. 2002.

The need for a flood forecasting and early warning system was \nidentified as a critical priority, particularly in the lower basin where communities are regularly \nexperiencing extreme flood hazards. \n \n9.  Lessons from past projects indicate the need to consider IWRM as a process rather than \na finite intervention. Projects trying to address many basin issues at one time have often proven \ntoo complex to implement. Through a programmatic and gender-inclusive participatory process, \nthe project will follow a phased approach and initially focus on priority issues identified by the \nbasin  stakeholders  to  (i)  strengthen  river  basin  governance  through  legal  and  institutional \nreform, (ii) improve the river environment in Kathmandu Valley, and (iii) reduce water-induced \ndisaster impacts throughout the basin.  \n \n10.  The  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  Nepal,  which \nsupports Nepal\u2019s peace and development by promoting (i) broad-based and inclusive economic \ngrowth,  (ii)  inclusive  social  development,  (iii)  governance  and  capacity  building,  and  (iv) \nenvironmental sustainability.10 The project will improve governance, build capacity, and improve \nenvironmental sustainability. The project fits into the priority sector of agriculture and natural \nresources and theme of environment sustainability outlined in the country partnership strategy. \nIt is included in the country operations business plan, 2013\u20132015.11 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact will be increased water security in the BRB. The outcome will be improved \nriver health and flood management. The project is the first attempt in Nepal to apply the concept \nand principles of IWRM since its adoption under the 2005 National Water Plan. \n \nC.  Outputs  \n12.  The project focuses on priority issues selected by the basin stakeholders from the basin \nstrategic investment road map. The road map is based on the 2009 Bagmati Action Plan and \nfurther consultations with basin stakeholders. The project has five outputs: \n(i)  Established  systems  and  capacity  for  integrated  and  participatory  river \nbasin  management.  Activities  include  (a)  provide  legal  and  institutional \nstrengthening  for  IWRM  and  formation  of  a  river  basin  organization  (RBO), \n(b) mobilize  basin  stakeholders,  (c) build  capacity  for  increasing  RBO \ncompetence, (d) establish a central water resources information system including \na decision support system and an operating water quality monitoring network, \nand (e) prepare a 15-year participatory integrated river basin master plan. \n(ii)  Improved riverbank environment in urban areas. Activities include (a) remove \ncontaminated  riverbed  material;  (b) construct  weirs  and  provide  phyto-\nremediation  to  enhance  the  river\u2019s  self-cleaning  capacity;  (c)  stabilize  and \nbeautify the riverbank; (d) mobilize, raise awareness, and build capacity of local \ngovernment and communities for riverbank management and maintenance; and \n(e) collaborate with the private sector, which has expressed interest in setting up \nrecreational businesses along the riverbanks through public\u2013private partnerships \nor finance maintenance as part of social corporate activities. \n(iii)  Increased  water  availability  in  the  basin  during  the  dry  season  and \nwatershed  conservation.

Construction equipment, material, and labor are all readily and locally available. \nThe size of the dam and reservoir was determined based on stakeholder priorities and using \ndetailed  water  quantity  and  quality  models  accounting  for  future  developments  including \npopulation growth, urbanization, and investments in water (Melamchi Water Supply Project) and \nwastewater management (Kathmandu Valley Wastewater Management Project).14 Feasibility \nstudies for the dams included hydrologic and geotechnical investigations as well as seismic \nhazard and dam break analysis. Design standards for the dams are based on the Guidelines of \nthe International Commission on Large Dams and Australian National Committee on Large \nDams. The Dhap dam is a moderate-size dam: 24 m high with 861,000 m3 storage. While it is \nnot classified as an extreme hazard dam, prudent conservative design criteria were adopted:  \n(i)  earthquake  standard  of  1:100  annual  exceedence  probability  and  maximum  credible \nearthquake associated with the closest active fault to the site; and (ii) probable maximum flood \ndesign accounting for anticipated impacts of climate change. Machinery used to construct the \ndams will access the site via an existing road that will be upgraded in places under the project. \nConstruction  machinery,  equipment,  materials,  and  labor  are  readily  and  locally  available. \nInternational specialists reviewed the final designs.  \n \n21.  Climate  change.  An  analysis  of  likely  changes  of  temperature  and  rainfall  was \nconducted to  appraise the  resilience  of  the  proposed  infrastructure  investments  to climate \nchange. The analysis used the latest downscaled projections including those from a 2010 TA.15 \nThe analysis revealed the average mean maximum temperature in the BRB will increase by \n1.5\u00b0\u20132.1\u00b0 Celsius under various emission scenarios for 2070\u20132099 compared with 1970\u20131999. \nSimilarly, annual rainfall in the upper BRB is projected to decrease by 2% and monsoon rainfall \nby 8% from 2020 to 2040, and by 11% and 6% from 2041 to 2060 compared with 1994\u20132000. \nThe reduction in rainfall during the first 20 years may not affect the filling capacity of the Dhap \nreservoir as current available runoff is estimated at 160% of reservoir capacity. Variations from \nyear-to-year  are  projected  to  increase  with  more  extremes.  Therefore,  regulation  through \nreservoirs will be beneficial in maintaining the required flow in the river during the dry season.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial  \n22.  The  estimated  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  14.5%;  the  net  present  value  is  \n$4.5 million. The economic internal rate of return is higher than the economic opportunity cost of \ncapital estimated at 12.0%, indicating sufficient economic return. The sensitivity analysis with \nadverse variation in the project costs and project benefits indicates an economic internal rate of \nreturn above 12.0% even with increased costs and reduced benefits. The risk analysis confirms \nthat the project is resilient to downside risks. \n                                                \n14  ADB. 2011.

A financial sustainability analysis of the project assessed the capacity of implementing \nagencies to sustain project-related recurrent expenditure and its debt service obligations. In \n2011\u20132012, the Department of Irrigation, HPCDIBC and WECS, had total recurrent expenditure \nof NRs97 million. The project recurrent expenditure is estimated at NRs6.2 million, which is 6% \nof the recurrent expenditure of the implementing agencies. Therefore the project will not impose \na significant burden on the recurrent expenditure of these agencies.  \n \nC.  Governance  \n24.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MOUD, and specific measures were built into the project design to \nmitigate risk, including (i) a project communication strategy, (ii) reduced number of contracts, \nand (iii) provision of procurement consultant expertise. Financial management and procurement \ncapacity assessments of the implementing agencies were conducted and mitigation measures \nadopted to address the weaknesses. Other risk assessments were conducted during project \ndesign with tools specifically designed for Nepal. Based on these assessments, some mitigation \nmeasures incorporated in the project design are to (i) implement the project communication \nstrategy for regular disclosure of project-related information to citizens; (ii) develop and regularly \nupdate a project website to enhance transparency in project implementation, procurement, and \nsafeguards; and (iii) establish a grievance redress mechanism to ensure effective resolution. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social  \n25.  The  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  A  poverty  and  social \nanalysis was completed. While the primary project beneficiaries are the people living in the \nBRB, the project specifically includes the poor and socially excluded. Investment activities for  \n(i) improved water security, (ii) conservation of watershed and augmentation of water in the \nriver, (iii) improved sanitation due to better river environment, (iv) reduction of flood hazards,  \n(v) good governance through establishing a dedicated RBO, and (vi) capacity development of \nlocal residents will directly benefit all, including the poor and the socially excluded. A gender \nequality and social inclusion action plan was prepared with clear targets, responsibilities, and \nresource allocation. Specific gender design features are included in 50% or more of project \noutputs. The project will contribute to improving women's access to benefits from the project; \n30% of employment generated from rehabilitation works will be reserved for women. The project \nhas prepared a stakeholder communication strategy for community awareness and participation \nto help mobilize key stakeholders for widespread and meaningful participation. \n \nE.  Safeguards  \n26.  Social safeguards. The project is classified as category C for involuntary resettlement \nand indigenous peoples. A resettlement framework was prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  as  a  prudent  measure  to  address  any  involuntary \nresettlement-related uncertainty during project implementation, should any issue arise. The \nproject does not include any component that will require land acquisition leading to involuntary \nresettlement, or involve involuntary restrictions on land use or on access to legally designated \nparks and protected areas. All civil works related to the Bagmati River channel improvement will \nbe limited to the existing government-owned right-of-way, and the proposed Dhap dam will be \nlocated within a national park (it is proposed to submerge an older dam). No adverse impacts on \nindigenous peoples are anticipated. Indigenous peoples living in the river basin area will benefit \nfrom the project like other residents. The project does not directly or indirectly affect the dignity, \nhuman rights, livelihood systems, or culture of indigenous peoples or affect the territories or \nnatural or cultural resources that indigenous peoples may own, use, occupy, or claim as their \n ", "9 \n \nancestral domain. The project preparatory team has carried out meaningful consultations with \nrelevant stakeholders and MOUD will continue to do so with all communities in the project area, \nespecially with reference to community mobilization for a better environment. \n \n27.  Environment safeguards. The project is classified as category A and an environmental \nimpact assessment (EIA) including environmental management plan (EMP) was prepared in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and is uploaded on ADB\u2019s website. The \nEIA covers proposed project interventions, including the construction of an 850,000 m3 storage \nreservoir (Dhap dam) with a 24 m high dam, constructed 375 m downstream of an existing dam \nwithin Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park (SNNP). Construction of the new dam will increase the \ninundation area from 1.5 hectares to 12.5 hectares. The EIA also assesses the impacts of the \ninclusion of a second reservoir, the Nagmati dam, which is to be located downstream of the \nDhap dam, also within SNNP, for which only detailed designs are to be prepared. The main \nadverse impact of the project is the inundation of land within a protected area. Due to past \nactivities in SNNP, the forest area within these two sites is re-grown forest and contains only a \nfew large mature trees. Among impacts to flora and fauna, construction of the Dhap dam will \nresult in habitat loss of approximately 0.03%. The EIA confirms that the small loss of habitat will \nnot adversely affect the nesting, feeding ground, and reproduction system of wild fauna in the \narea, as similar habitats are found within SNNP. Any residual impact will be offset by the \nconservation of watershed of the area, which is supported by the project. Several alternatives \nwere considered for augmenting river flows, including interbasin transfers and alternative dam \nlocations within and outside SNNP. The analysis demonstrates that the options selected under \nthe project are the most feasible. The project will not lead to significant negative cumulative \nimpacts on biodiversity, water quality, or ecological flows. \n \n28.  The EMP includes measures to minimize negative impacts and the dam design includes \na minimum environmental flow to support the limited aquatic fauna and fish supported by the \nriver\u2019s ecosystem. Given the high pollution within the Bagmati River, the project will result in \nseveral  positive  impacts,  which  will  outweigh  the  negative.  The  positive  impacts  include  \n(i) improved water quality and urban river environment; (ii) increased groundwater recharge; and \n(iii) ensured bathing water quality standard at the Pashupatinath temple to meet the community \nritual requirements during cultural festivals in the dry season.  \n \n29.  An environment specialist will be engaged to update the EMP after detailed designs are \ncompleted, supervise its implementation, and provide capacity building to implementing agency \nstaff.  The  Department  of  Irrigation  and  HPCIDBC  will  supervise  EMP  implementation.  An \nindependent  environment  consultant  will  monitor  EMP  implementation.  Stakeholders  were \nconsulted during project design; this will continue during project implementation in accordance \nwith  the  project\u2019s  communication  strategy.  The  project  will  establish  a  grievance  redress \nmechanism for resolving grievances of project-affected people. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n30.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.16The integrated benefits and impacts of the \n \nproject are expected to outweigh the costs.  \n \n \n \n                                                \n16 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nNepal adopts a federal structure that  The project adopts the IWRM approach for subbasins rather \nfails to recognize water as a state  than whole basin. \nsubject. \nParliament is not in place for adoption of  MOUD, with support from ADB and the technical assistance, \nnecessary policy, legal, and institutional  will secure approval to establish an RBO through Presidential \nreforms, including RBO establishment.  ordinance.  \nWWTP effluent quality at Gokarna and  MOUD is also the KVWMP executing agency.
