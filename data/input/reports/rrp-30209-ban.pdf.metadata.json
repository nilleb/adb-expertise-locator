The  project  design  builds  on  the  lessons\nlearned  from  the  ongoing  Small-Scale  Water  Resources\nDevelopment Sector Project (SSWRDSP) that was successfully\nimplemented in 300 subprojects in the western part of the country.\nThe Project aims to improve livelihoods and reduce poverty by\nundertaking a further 300 subprojects located in the eastern and\nwestern parts of the country. The Project will assist stakeholders\nto form water management associations and to upgrade physical\nfacilities  including  (i)  flood  management,  (ii)  drainage\nimprovement,  (iii)  water  conservation,  and  (iv)  command  area\ndevelopment.    The  Project  accorded  high  priority  under  the\nGovernment\u2019s medium- and long-term investment plan for small-\nscale water resources development.\nClassification Poverty Intervention\nThematic: Economic Growth\nEnvironmental Category B. An initial environmental examination was undertaken\nAssessment and the summary is included in an appendix.\nRationale Since  90  percent  of  the  country\u2019s  poor  people  live  in  rural\nBangladesh,  agriculture  and  rural  development  are  critical\nelements of the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy.   Key\nconstraints for rural poverty reduction include (i) lack of physical\ninfrastructure;  (ii)  lack  of  support  services  including  extension,\nmarketing,  and  financial  services;  (iii)  lack  of  high-quality\nagricultural inputs; (iv) suboptimal utilization of water resources;\nand  (v)  lack  of  access  to  basic  social  services.  Water  is  the\nfoundation for many rural livelihood activities of the rural poor, and\neffective  water  resource  management  is  fundamental  to\naddressing  pervasive  rural  poverty  problems  while  promoting\neconomic growth in Bangladesh. This critical water resource has\nto be managed in a strategic, integrated, and participatory manner\nthat includes the mobilization, organization, and empowerment of\nstakeholders.  Based  on  the  Government\u2019s  main  instrument  to\nhave the strategy implemented, the SSWRDSP was launched in\n1996 to enhance rural incomes by developing community-based\nwater  management  associations  (WMAs)  and  community-\nmanaged, small-scale  infrastructure;  this  has  proved  to  be  an\neffective  means  to  reduce  rural  poverty.  Participatory  water\nresources  development  and  management  is  necessary  to\neffectively  implement  key  principles  by  strengthening  the\nimplementation  framework;  this  was  demonstrated  under  the", "iii\nSSWRDSP.  Expansion  of  small-scale  water  resources\ndevelopment is one of the key elements in effectively reducing\nrural poverty.\nObjectives and The overall goal of the Project is to support the Government\u2019s\nScope poverty reduction effort by increasing sustainable agricultural and\nfishery production. The project objective is to develop sustainable\nstakeholder-driven,  small-scale  water  resource  management\nsystems  with  special  attention  to  the  poorer  section  of  the\npopulation.  The  objectives  will  be  achieved  by  (i)  developing\nimproved  means  of  beneficiary  participation  in  the  selection,\ndesign, implementation, and operation and maintenance of small-\nscale  water  resource  management  development  systems;  (ii)\nrehabilitating  and  constructing  small-scale  water  resource\nmanagement  infrastructure  with  appropriate  agricultural\nextension, fisheries extension, and aquaculture development; (iii)\ndeveloping  effective  management  of  environmental  and  social\nimpacts of subprojects, including on those engaged in practicing\nfloodplain  capture  fisheries;  and  (iv)  developing  institutional\nstrengthening and capacity building of relevant Government and\nstakeholder organizations to ensure adequate support for small-\nscale water resources development at all levels.\nCost Estimates Total  project  costs  are  estimated  at  $78.0  million  equivalent,\nconsisting of $15.9 million in foreign exchange costs (20 percent)\nand $62.1 million equivalent (80 percent) of local currency costs.\nFinancing Plan ($million)\nForeign Local Total\nSource Exchange Currency Cost Percent\nADB 7.6 26.4 34.0 44\nNetherlands 8.3 16.0 24.3 31\nGovernment 0.0 17.3 17.3 22\nBeneficiaries 0.0   2.4   2.4   3\n        Total      15.9 62.1 78.0 100\nADB = Asian Development Bank.\nLoan Amount The equivalent in various currencies of SDR26,985,000  from the\nand Terms Special Funds resources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).\nThe term will be 32 years including a grace period of 8 years, with\nan interest charge of 1.0 percent per annum during the grace\nperiod and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter.\nPeriod of Utilization Until 31 December 2009\nExecuting Agency Local  Government  Engineering  Department  (LGED)  under  the\nMinistry  of  Local  Government,  Rural  Development  and\nCooperatives.\nImplementation A  project  steering  committee  will  be  formed  and  consist  of\nArrangements representatives  of  all  ministries  and  agencies  concerned.

INTRODUCTION\n2. The  Government  of  Bangladesh  sought  assistance  from  ADB  in  1999  to  finance\npreparation of a project aimed at improving water management to magnify the impacts of the\nongoing Small-Scale Water Resources Sector Project (SSWRDSP).2 Project preparation was\ncarried out under ADB-financed technical assistance (TA).3 Following completion of the TA, fact-\nfinding was carried out in 2000 and ADB appraised the Project from 12-25 March 2001.4 This\nreport  is  based  on  the  feasibility  study  and  the  Appraisal  Mission\u2019s  discussions  with\nrepresentatives  of  Government  agencies,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  target\nbeneficiaries and their communities, and bilateral and multilateral aid agencies in Bangladesh.\nThe project design is summarized in the project framework in Appendix 1.\nIII.      BACKGROUND\nA.  Sector Description\n1.  Rural Poverty in Bangladesh\n3. Bangladesh remains one of the poorest countries in the world with a per capita income\nof approximately $360 in 1999. With a population of over 130 million living in a total area of 148\nthousand square kilometers (or 880 persons per square kilometer), it is one of the most densely\npopulated countries in the world. Among this population, over 80 percent live in rural areas\nmainly engaged in agriculture and related nonfarm activities. Endowed with limited land and\nother natural resources, and with a high population density, poverty is a pervasive problem in\nrural Bangladesh. The recent countrywide income poverty data shows that the head count index\nof poverty in 1995/96 was 51 percent in rural areas compared with the urban index of 26\npercent, and the national average of 46 percent.5 In monetary terms, the annual per capita\n                  \n1  Schemes with a command area of less than 1,000 hectares.\n2  Loan 1381-BAN: Small-Scale Water Resources Development Sector Project, for $32.0 million, approved on 26\nSeptember 1995 and cofinanced by International Fund for Agricultural Development, for $10.4 million, on 7\nDecember 1995, is being implemented in the western divisions of Bangladesh and will be completed in 2002. This\nproject is being supported by TA 2564-BAN: Beneficiary Participation and Project Management, approved on 2\nMay 1996 and funded by the Government of Netherlands for $6.8 million.\n3 TA 3358-BAN: Second Small-Scale Water Resources Development Sector Project, for $400,000, approved on 22\nDecember 1999. Loan 1381-BAN(SF): Small-Scale Water Resources Development Sector Project, for $32 million,\napproved on 26 September 1995. A participatory process has been adopted in preparing the Project. Two national\nworkshops were conducted by inviting concerned stakeholders. Several local workshops were also conducted to\nconsult with beneficiaries of the ongoing project.\n4\n   The Mission comprised Toshio Kondo, Senior Project Economist/Mission Leader; K. Yokoyama, Project Engineer;\nS. Wendt, Social Development Specialist; and A. Goswami, Counsel. P. de Vries and M. Verwijk, First Secretaries,\nRoyal Netherlands Embassy in Dhaka, and two experts, J. Luijendijk and B. Woersem participated in the Mission.\nO. Shresta, K. H. Ryu, and K. Talukdar from the Bangladesh Resident Mission assisted the Mission.\n5 Sen, Binayak. 2000. Bangladesh Poverty Analysis: Trends, Policies and Institutions. Prepared with financial\nsupport from ADB.", "2\nincome at the level of moderate and extreme poverty was estimated at Tk6,100 (about $120\nequivalent) and Tk5,100 ($100) respectively for 1999.6\n4. Poverty in rural Bangladesh is multifaceted, reflected in low standards of living, poor\nhealth and nutrition, and lack of education and health services, abandonment in particular of\nwomen and children, and vulnerability to natural disasters such as floods and cyclones. The\nbasic causes of poverty are lack of access to productive resources (mainly land and water) and\nbasic infrastructure (such as road and electricity), to public services such as education and\nhealth services, and to employment opportunities. Lack of social and government safety-net\nentitlements makes poor people particularly vulnerable. These phenomena are largely attributed\nto insufficient economic growth in rural areas. Given that nearly 90 percent of poor people live in\nrural  areas,  enhancing  poverty  reduction  in  rural  areas  through  rural  and  agricultural\ndevelopment is the key challenge facing the country. Subprojects under the ongoing SSWRDSP\nhave  already  generated  substantial  benefits  to  rural  people.  These  subprojects  have  also\nprovided substantial incremental opportunities to the landless.\n2.  Water Resources\n5. For the country\u2019s rural residents, access to productive resources is of fundamental\nimportance to their livelihood. For the poor, water resources are particularly important. Water is\nthe  foundation  for  many  traditional  livelihood  activities,  including  the  country\u2019s  main  rural\nactivities\u2014agriculture and inland and coastal fishing, transportation, water supply, and rural\nindustries. However, located at the confluence of three major river systems of the South Asia\nregion\u2014the  Brahmaputra,  Ganges,  and  Meghna\u2014managing  water  resources  poses  an\nextraordinary challenge for the country. These river systems bring about massive floods in the\nmonsoon season7 and severe water scarcity in the dry season, along with serious riverbank\nerosion threatening the livelihood of vulnerable people living along the rivers, and siltation of\nwatercourses  causing  widespread  drainage  congestion.  Periodic  natural  disasters  such  as\ncyclones and tidal surges exacerbate hardships by decimating life and property in coastal areas.\n6. In addition to these severe physical challenges, the demands of water management that\nhave evolved in Bangladesh are complex and diverse. Agriculture, particularly rice cultivation, is\nthe most dominant activity in rural life, and often calls for the protection of agricultural land from\nseasonal floods to ensure sufficient income and food security to rural people. However, many\nrural families, particularly the poor, also need water for capture fisheries, livestock breeding, jute\nprocessing, and other economic activities for subsistence purposes in the monsoon season.\nMost waterways of the country also serve as an important transport network. Rural households\nneed access to adequate and safe domestic water, which is increasingly under competition with\ngroundwater exploitation for irrigation purposes in the dry season, and is also in many cases\nthreatened by arsenic contamination. Finally, water is a vital resource for the maintenance of the\ncountry\u2019s natural ecosystems and biodiversity, particularly wetlands, which are deemed to be\namong the richest in the world. Given these diverse interests in water resource use against a\nbackdrop of poverty the paramount need of the country is to manage this critical resource in a\nstrategic, integrated, and participatory manner.\n                  \n6 Japan Overseas Consultants Co. Ltd. et al. Poverty Impact Study: Southwest Road Network Development Project\n(ADB Loan 1478 BAN-SF).\n7\n   Monsoon floods inundate about 30 percent of the land on average.", "3\n3. Water-Related Economic Activities\n7. Agriculture is Bangladesh's major economic activity, and supports the vast majority of its\npopulation. While the sector\u2019s share has declined to 32 percent of gross domestic product and\n13 percent of exports in recent years, it employs about 60 percent of the country's labor force of\n56 million. Food crops represent about 72 percent of the value added by agriculture, followed by\nfisheries (11 percent), livestock (10 percent), and forestry (7 percent). Fisheries and livestock\nactivities are of particular importance to the rural poor who have limited access to land. As many\nas 70 percent of rural households are partly or fully involved in subsistence fishing, whereas\nlivestock activities employ about 20 percent of the rural labor force. Fisheries also have strong\nimplications for the nutritional status of the poor, accounting for over 60 percent of the animal\nprotein intake.\n8. The  food  grain  production  in  fiscal  year  1999/20008  has  exceeded  the  food  self-\nsufficiency target. The resulting reduction in food grain prices has particularly benefited the poor\nnot only in urban but also in rural areas, given that 70 percent of rural households are net\npurchasers of rice. This robust growth is largely attributed to increased groundwater irrigation\nand adequate supply of key agricultural inputs such as fertilizer, fuel, and high-yielding varieties\nof seeds at stable prices, and increased availability of agricultural credit. The Government\u2019s\nproactive  policies  have  also  contributed  to  this  process,  including  the  removal  of  import\nrestriction on irrigation pumps, and liberalization of trade in agricultural inputs.\n9. Notwithstanding this achievement, continued significant growth of food crop production\nis critically needed to tackle rural poverty problems. Efforts to increase food grain production\nneed to be continued to keep pace with the growth of Bangladesh\u2019s population and to ensure\nfood security for the poor.9 Providing effective and sustainable water management infrastructure\nis an important part of these challenges.\n10. Inland  fishery  production,  which  comprises  capture  and  culture  fisheries,  has  also\nstrongly performed in the late 1990s, achieving an annual growth rate of over 8 percent. Given\nthe importance of fisheries resources to the rural poor as a source of income as well as\nnutrition, enhancement of this trend is essential.\n11. The importance of providing enabling physical infrastructure for poverty reduction is well\ndocumented. Studies have concluded that water resource infrastructure such as embankments,\nroads, and water control structures have impacts in terms of (i) improving income opportunities\nfor food crop production; (ii) developing culture fisheries in areas protected by embankments,\n(iii)  ensuring  access  for  the  poor  to  public  water  bodies;  and  (iv)  inducing  relevant\nnonagricultural activities that have forward linkages that are engaged by the poor.\n4. Water Sector Institutions\n12. The  country\u2019s  sector  institutions  including  the  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and\nBangladesh Water Development Board have been relatively weak in addressing complex water\nmanagement issues. Past planning efforts have tended to focus on construction of infrastructure\nfor the protection of agriculture and urban land that often overlooked this multidimensional\naspect of the country\u2019s water resources. Operation and maintenance (O&M) of the infrastructure\n                  \n8\n  Food grain production for 1999/2000 was 24.9 million tons. Food supply has barely exceeded demand in recent\nyears.\n9 The annual rate of population growth decreased between 1991 and 1998 from about 2.2 percent to an estimated\n1.7 percent.", "4\nhas remained underresourced and inadequate, with little beneficiary participation and support\nfor local resource mobilization. The Government\u2019s efforts to address these challenges and\ninstitutional constraints were initiated in the 1990s, and are included in the National Water Policy\n(NWP) of 1999.\n13.   During  the  implementation  of  the  SSWRDSP,  the  Local  Government  Engineering\nDepartment  (LGED)10  demonstrated  adequate  ability  to  identify  and  operate  effective\nprocedures and arrangements in undertaking community-based, participatory, water resources\nmanagement schemes. With the majority of their staff placed at district and subdistrict (or\nupazila) levels with substantial decentralization in decision making, LGED is well placed to\nassist local government institutions (LGIs) to develop water management systems and local\nstakeholder institutions to manage those systems. At the central level, LGED has also managed\nthe  process  of  defining  the  national  Guidelines  for  Participatory  Water  Management11\nincorporating procedures established under the SSWRDSP. While LGED\u2019s capabilities have\nfully met the standards required for the sector lending modality adopted for the SSWRDSP,\nfurther strengthening in terms of the skills sets required for decentralized small-scale water\nresources development is required.\n14. The  development  of  water  management  associations  (WMAs)  is  critical  to  the\ninstitutional development of community participation in small-scale water resources schemes\nand the sustainability of such schemes based on decentralized participation. However, legal\nframework improvements for WMA institutional development and operationalization under a\nreformed or alternative legal framework remains a continuing challenge for the sector.\n5. Key Sector Issues\na. Implementation of the National Water Policy\n15. The  policy  framework  for  addressing  complex  water  resources  issues  in  a\ncomprehensive and sustainable manner has been weak in Bangladesh. The adoption of the\nNWP by Bangladesh in 1999 has provided clear policy goals and principles for integrated and\nparticipatory water management, decentralization, improved governance, and sustainable O&M\ncombined with transfer of management.12 However, the NWP identifies that the setting of an\nappropriate legislative framework is fundamental to effective implementation of the policy\u2019s\nprinciples and policy goals. The adoption of such a legislative framework in the form of a\nnational water code is still outstanding.\nb. Framework for Integrated and Participatory Development of Water\n                        Resources\n16. Given the complexity and diversity of interests among stakeholders in water resources in\nBangladesh, water management interventions must be identified, formulated, and implemented\nwith cross sectoral perspectives and stakeholder consultation. The Government approved the\nGuidelines  for  Participatory  Water  Management  in  November  2000.  These  guidelines\nemphasize  stringent  stakeholder  consultation  at  the  identification  stage,  agreement  with\n                  \n10  The Executing Agency for the ongoing SSWRDSP, under the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development\nand Cooperatives, has a strong background in rural development.\n11   The Guidelines for Participatory Water Management approved in November 2000 recommended that initially the\nbeneficiaries be registered under the Cooperative Societies Ordinance (1984) and Cooperatives Societies Rules\n(1987) as amended. These guidelines will enhance the active participation of stakeholders.\n12  The NWP adopted the principle of management transfer of small and medium schemes (up to 5,000 hectares of\ncommand area) to water users associations, which will take responsibility for O&M of the schemes.", "5\nstakeholders prior to construction of physical works, and sound institutional development and\neffective use of NGOs for stakeholder participation through the WMAs. Properly operationalizing\nthese principles requires a legal framework that provides an adequate platform for the operation\nof cooperatives and enables the injection of effective competition to cooperatives as instruments\nof  WMA  implementation.  The  current  Cooperatives  Ordinance  of  1984  and  Cooperatives\nSocieties Rules of 1987, as amended, do not sufficiently serve this purpose and no enabling\nlegal provisions are yet available for alternative forms of WMAs.\nc. Decentralization, Institutional Capacity, and Governance\n17. The NWP stipulates that small-scale water resources development schemes with an\narea of less than 1,000 hectares must be placed under the responsibility of LGIs, whereas\nmedium- to large-scale schemes are under the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB).\nUnder this delineation, LGED assists LGIs in appraising and implementing new and existing\nself-help groups, other stakeholders, and NGOs assisting the participatory process. Past water\nmanagement interventions in Bangladesh were centrally oriented leading to single purpose,\ninfrastructure-orientated  projects  that  overlooked  diverse  social  concerns.  Lengthy  decision\nmaking and inflexibility in adapting to local needs exacerbated poor performance. The NWP\naims  to  provide  increased  local  autonomy  and  foster  participation,  thereby  enhancing\nsustainable cost recovery and O&M. In particular, LGIs are given responsibility for small-scale\nschemes  below  1,000  ha  with  the  support  of  LGED.  However,  if  the  benefits  of  such\ndecentralized  water  management  are  to  be  realized,  LGED\u2019s  capacity  to  support  such\ndevelopment  must  be  adequately  built.  This  must  include  the  ability  to  address  local\ncoordination, ensure more effective identification and formulation of interventions by LGED\nmanagement from an integrated perspective, and address social and environmental concerns\nthrough effective monitoring.\n18. In  addition  to  LGED  reorganization  to  serve  such  needs,  effective  water  sector\ngovernance is required to realize the potential benefits of decentralization. This includes the\nneed to (i) build contractual frameworks that ensure water service infrastructure providers are\nheld  accountable  to  communities;  such  a  framework  lies  at  the  heart  of  effective  water\nmanagement; (ii) empower communities through WMA-based participation approaches to small-\nscale  water  resource  schemes;  (iii)  develop  appropriate  water  and  usage  rights  under\npredictable legal framework; and (iv) improve accountability and performance monitoring to\nensure  quality  infrastructure  by  providing  technical,  social,  and  financial  audits  for  WMA-\nmanaged completed schemes.\nB. Government Policies and Plans\n19. The Government\u2019s water resources sector investment plan is documented in (i) the\nBangladesh Water and Flood Management Strategy (BWFMS) approved in 1995 and updated\nin 1998 following the Ganges Water Treaty with India, and (ii) the Fifth Five-Year Plan (FFYP)\n1997-2002. The BWFMS provides strategies, programs, and the short-term investment portfolio\nup to 2000 and the medium-term up to 2010. These are integrated into the FFYP, which\npursues  as  its  primary  investment  portfolio  objectives  of  poverty  reduction,  employment\ngeneration, and food self-sufficiency.\n20. During the preparation of the Flood Action Plan (FAP),13 the deficiencies of past water\nsector operations were widely acknowledged. Such interventions ended to be top-down, and\n                  \n13 The FAP proposed subdividing flood-protected areas into small components to be managed locally in order to\nsecure an environment for intensive agriculture, aquaculture, and integrated rural development.", "6\nsingle-purpose of a major structural type that tended to cause adverse social and environmental\nimpacts and poor O&M sustainability. As a result, Government and civil society recognized the\nneed to (i) set up sound policies and an enabling institutional framework to develop integrated,\nparticipatory, and sustainable water resource management; and (ii) define a long-term sector\npolicy and plan. The BWFMS therefore called for the preparation of the NWP and the National\nWater Management Plan (NWMP) as the most urgent requirements.\n21. The core water sector strategies in the BWFMS and FFYP include (i) strengthening\nwater  sector  institutions,  (ii)  undertaking  comprehensive  studies  on  major  investments,  (iii)\nincreasing  efficiency  of  completed  water  resource  schemes  by  rehabilitating  works  and\ntransferring  management  to  local  beneficiary  organizations,  and  (iv)  providing  riverbank\nprotection and channel maintenance. In the investment portfolio, small-scale water resources\ninterventions have been given high priority in the short- and medium-term because they reflect\nrelatively  lower  costs  and  higher  returns,  quicker  gestation  periods,  more  manageable\nstakeholder conflicts, and smaller environmental impacts, and hence greater opportunities to\naddress rural poverty problems in a holistic manner. The medium-term target is to provide water\nmanagement facilities identified by local people to a total area of 270,000 ha by 2010.\n22. The NWMP14 will set forth strategies and programs up to 2025 with an investment\nportfolio of priority programs. These are to be prepared both at national and regional levels.\nBased  on  intensive  studies  of  the  lessons  learned  in  past  interventions,  the  NWMP  will\nemphasize the provision of an enabling institutional environment called for by the NWP.\n23. In the small-scale water resources subsector, the NWMP will build on the experience of\nthe SSWRDSP. The NWMP is to provide for improved strategies with a strong poverty reduction\norientation. The emerging strategies over the next five years will focus on institutionalization of\nprocedures  and  arrangements  for  stakeholder-driven,  community-based,  small-scale  water\nresources development schemes established under the SSWRDSP, and the building of capacity\nof sector institutions to establish effective water management associations and infrastructure.\nC.        External Assistance to the Sector\n24.  In the 1980s, major external assistance to the water resources sector was provided in a\nseries  of  large  flood  control,  drainage,  and  irrigation  projects  with  support  from  ADB,  the\ngovernments of Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, and the World Bank. Loans amounting to over\n$300 million were provided by ADB for the implementation of such projects during the 1980s.\nFollowing  the  catastrophic  floods  in  1987  and  1988,  external  assistance  focused  on  the\npreparation of an FAP aimed at managing floods in a more systematic manner.\n25. After the completion of the FAP, major efforts have been directed to preparing the NWP\nand NWMP, and implementing high-priority projects. Most water sector projects initiated in the\n1990s, particularly after the FAP studies and the related pilot interventions, explicitly address\nthe  critical  issue  of  the  sustainability  of  water  management  infrastructure,  and  emphasize\nparticipation and coordination of local stakeholders to achieve this end.\n26. The major external funding agencies are now focusing on the implementation of the key\nelements of the NWP through reforms of water sector institutions, and effective preparation of\nthe NWMP. While NWMP preparation is funded by the World Bank, the process is under careful\n                  \n14  The NWMP is due to be finalized in November 2001. It will define the coordination strategy for the improved water\nsector performance with stakeholder participation in the planning process. ADB has been contributing to the\nfinalization of the NWMP which is consistent with ADB\u2019s water policy.", "7\nreview  within  the  framework  of  the  local  consultative  group  of  external  funding  agencies\nparticipated in by the World Bank, ADB, and other financiers. The World Bank is also preparing\nthe Water Sector Improvement Project, which seeks to promote institutional improvement of\nBWDB and participatory rehabilitation of small- and medium-scale water resources development\nschemes (between 1,000 and 15,000 ha) constructed by BWDB, with a view to transferring the\nmanagement of smaller schemes (up to 5,000 ha) to WMAs. Appendix 2 summarizes external\nassistance to the sector.\nD.        Lessons Learned\n27. The  experience  of  ADB,  other  funding  agencies,  and  NGOs  indicate  that  water\nresources development projects in Bangladesh have complex social, technical, institutional, and\nenvironmental dimensions. Projects need to be formulated with close attention to each of these\naspects to achieve the envisaged benefits in a sustainable manner. Key requirements include (i)\nstakeholder participation at all stages of the project cycle including resource mobilization by\nproject  beneficiaries  for  sustainable  O&M;  (ii)  simple  technical  design  reflecting  the  local\nconditions followed by careful construction quality control; (iii) strong capacity development of\nbeneficiary organizations and of project management institutions; and (iv) careful environmental\nimpact assessments, monitoring, and management, in particular the impacts on fisheries, which\nis the main source of income  and protein for the poorest segment of the society in general.\n28. The ongoing ADB-financed SSWRDSP was initiated in 1996 incorporating these lessons\ninto project design. This project has been implementing about 300 small-scale water resources\ndevelopment schemes to establish water control structures and self-sustaining WMAs, covering\nan area of about 150,000 ha in the western divisions of Bangladesh. The review missions\nfielded between 1999 and 2001 concluded that project performance was satisfactory in terms of\ncompliance  with  covenants,  although  improvement  was  needed  in  terms  of  stakeholder\nparticipation, construction quality, and ensuring sustainable O&M managed by WMAs. A status\nreport of the SSWRDSP that includes preliminary project impacts and lessons learned is given\nin Appendix 3. Key lessons learned can be summarized as follows.\n(i)  Diverse stakeholder interests in rural society need to be taken into account\nduring an early phase of project preparation and be reflected in the organization\nof the stakeholder participation and project design. Mechanisms for effective\nconflict resolution should also be ensured.\n(ii)  Subprojects need to be implemented with well-defined strategies and perspective\nplans for small-scale water resource interventions at local and regional levels.\n(iii)  The number of subprojects should be limited to ensure adequate resources for\nquality control of subprojects. Sufficient time and resources should be provided\nfor the feasibility studies and formation of WMAs.\n(iv)  A firm institutional basis should be established before initiating physical works.\nThe  approach  of  ensuring  sufficient  membership  registration  and  financial\ncontributions from beneficiaries prior to physical works is sound.\n(v)  While the cooperatives framework provides an effective legal basis for WMAs,\nthe existing rules are administratively complex and need to be improved. An\nalternative  institutional  framework  specialized  for  WMAs  could  be  developed\nbased on ongoing experience.", "8\n(vi)  Ensuring the quality of infrastructure is essential for WMAs to effectively take\nover O&M. This should be pursued through sufficient field surveys and design,\nbeneficiary consultation, and careful construction quality control.\n(vii)  Environmental  management  and  land  acquisition  should  be  undertaken  in  a\ntimely and clear fashion with implementation of necessary mitigation measures\nfor those affected by the project.\n(viii)  Monitoring of completed schemes using sound, annual, technical, social, and\nfinancial audits of WMAs is of crucial importance. Activities to institutionalize\nWMA-managed O&M should be initiated at the early stages of the subprojects.\n(ix)  The  capacity  of  project  management  institutions  is  crucial  to  fulfill  the\nmultidisciplinary tasks of promoting small-scale, stakeholder-driven sustainable\nwater  resources  management.  Sufficient  institutional  support  needs  to  be\nprovided.\n(x)  The role and capacity of local government institutions must be strengthened to\nsupport small-scale water resource schemes in line with the NWP and ongoing\nlocal government reforms.\n29. These  lessons  are  adequately  reflected  in  the  design,  implementation,  and  O&M\nmanagement of the proposed Project.\nE.         ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n30. The  Poverty  Reduction  Partnership  Agreement  signed  between  ADB  and  the\nGovernment in April 2000, consistent with ADB\u2019s country operational strategy for Bangladesh,\nidentified poverty reduction as its overarching objective.15 This will be pursued by promoting four\npriority  areas  including  (i)  faster  private  sector-led  economic  growth,  (ii)  creation  of  better\ndevelopment opportunities for the poor in rural and urban areas, (iii) improvement of human\ndevelopment,  and  (iv)  environmental  protection.  The  country  operational  strategy  also\nadvocates sharpening the focus of ADB operations on policy and institutional development\nthrough long-term involvement in a limited number of priority sectors. Agriculture and rural\nsectors have been accorded high priority, with operational focus on crop and agribusiness\ncredit, rural infrastructure, water resources development, and microfinance.\n31.  In the water resources sector, ADB\u2019s strategy is to support integrated and sustainable\nwater resources development and management by enhancing stakeholder participation and\nempowerment,  improving  financial  efficiency  and  sustainability,  and  improving  the  living\nconditions for the poor rural population, while not disturbing the natural environment. Developing\nthe  necessary  policies  and  institutional  framework  and  capacities  of  central  and  local\ngovernments, and community organizations to enable these processes is accorded high priority.\nADB\u2019s short-term operational focus is placed on (i) effective upgrading and rehabilitation of\nsmall-scale water resource infrastructure along with the development of WMAs, which have\ndemonstrated growth and poverty reduction benefits in rural areas across a wide range of\nstakeholders in the rural areas; and (ii) institutional development for sound water resource\nmanagement  and  service  delivery  systems,  including  capacity  development  for  strategic,\n                  \n15  ADB. 1999.

The Government has been committed to improving sector performance and has agreed\nwith the following policy actions and implementation time frames. Appendix 4 summarizes these\nelements.\n1. National Water Policy\n33. The SSWRDSP has implemented measures in support of the NWP, particularly for the\n(i) development of participatory processes to involve local communities, including the NGOs as\nfacilitators, in identification, planning, design, construction, and O&M of community-based water\nmanagement schemes; (ii) approval of identified projects through the upazila development\ncoordination  committee  and  the  district-level  interagency  project  evaluation  committee;  (iii)\ninstitutionalization  of  WMAs;  (iv)  establishment  of  a  system  for  signing  an  implementation\nagreement  before  the  commencement  of  construction;  and  (v)  establishment  of  formal\narrangements for the training of personnel and for handover of O&M responsibility to the WMA.\n34. The NWP envisages that the ownership of schemes implemented under the SSWRDSP\nwill eventually be transferred to local governments,16 beginning with facilities that WMAs operate\nand  maintain  in  a  sustainable  manner.  Furthermore,  subprojects  implemented  under  the\nSSWRDSP do not always sufficiently take into account their interaction with existing or planned\nwater management infrastructure in the surrounding areas and the policy thrust of the NWP.\nThe Project has built in adequate mechanisms to address these gaps, in particular through the\nstructuring of contractual rights and obligations under implementation agreements and O&M\nagreements, as well as eventual transfer of ownership agreements between LGED and the\nLGIs.  In  addition,  to  ensure  the  deepening  of  the  SSWRDSP  initiatives  and  legislative\ntranslation of critical NWP measures across the water resources sector, the Government has\nundertaken to enact the national water code within 18 months after loan effectiveness. Among\nother  things,  this  new  legislation  will  define  the  role  of  local  government  in  the  planning,\nimplementation, and operation of small-scale water resources management and acquisition of\nwater rights by a variety of water users in line with the NWP.\n2. Framework for Participatory Water Resources Management\n35. The ongoing SSWRDSP has established the legal framework for WMAs by revising the\nexisting Cooperatives Societies Rules (1987) under the Cooperatives Act. These rules have\nbeen amended to allow for registration by and contractual capacity of cooperatives to cater to\nWMAs.  While  this  framework  has  allowed  WMAs  to  collect  fees  from  beneficiaries,  the\nexperience  of  the  SSWRDSP  has  showed  that  the  existing  framework  is  administratively\ncomplex. The Government is in the process of reforming the Cooperatives Act with a view to\nsimplifying  administrative  procedures,  enhancing  transparency,  and  reducing  Government\nintervention both directly and indirectly by encouraging the financial soundness of autonomous\ncooperatives. The draft law is expected to be approved by Cabinet within six months of the\neffective date with a view to enactment within one year of the effective date. Policy dialogue with\nADB has indicated that the Government regards such enactment as important in fostering the\n                  \n16  Both the Union Parishad Act and the Upazila Parishad Act confer upon these two local government levels the\nauthority to assume the role of owner of small-scale water management infrastructure.", "10\nviability  of  cooperatives  as  continuing  instruments  of  implementation  of  WMA  beneficiary\nparticipation for sustainable small-scale water resources schemes.\n36. Under the Project, the WMAs will conclude implementation and O&M agreements with\nLGED and LGIs.  These agreements need to more clearly reflect (i) the local government's\nownership of the infrastructure, (ii) the conferral by the local government upon the WMAs of the\nright to use and the obligation to maintain the infrastructure, and (iii) the role of LGED to assist,\nin line with its mandate, local government in building the infrastructure and ensuring that it is\nused appropriately and maintained in good repair. Before loan negotiations, the Government\nagreed to ensure that these elements were included in a draft implementation agreement and\nO&M agreement.\n37. In addition to developing the long-run institutional sustainability of WMAs for small-scale\nwater resources projects through changes to the legal framework for cooperatives linked with\ncontractual agreements, the NWP referred broadly to the need to develop water user groups\nwithout restricting these to cooperatives. Consequently, policy dialogue tested the willingness of\nthe Government to evaluate options for institutionalizing WMAs through types of organizations\nother  than  cooperatives.  The  Government  indicated  its  willingness  to  explore  competitive\nalternatives to cooperatives as a means of forming WMAs. In the interest of seeking to introduce\ncompetitive pressures to enhance performance on small-scale water resources schemes, time-\nbound covenants were agreed with the Government to identify enabling legal provisions for\nalternative forms of WMA and pilot test alternative forms of WMA under the Project.\n3.   Reorganization of LGED\n38. An  ADB-financed  study  completed  in  1998  proposed  the  organizational  reform  and\nstrengthening of LGED.17 In general that study proposed that the need to create a larger\nnumber of nonengineering positions within LGED so as to strengthen LGED\u2019s capacity to\nimplement small-scale water management schemes should be reviewed, to take into account\nthe needs of participatory water management. On the basis of this study and policy dialogue,\nstrengthening is required in the areas of (i) increasing understanding water management issues;\n(ii) developing relevant nonengineering skills; (iii) building capacity of community organizers at\nthe field level; and (iv) building managerial capacity of national level staff, including planning and\nnonengineering  aspects  of  water  management  infrastructure.  In  particular,  the  following\npositions will need to be created: (i) senior headquarters staff in the areas of institutional\ndevelopment, environment, agriculture, and aquaculture; (ii) socioeconomists in the districts;\nand (iii) community organizers at the upazilas.\n39. To ensure a time-bound and appropriate alteration in LGED\u2019s skills mix, policy dialogue\nwith the Government resulted in the Government agreeing to reorganize LGED\u2019s organizational\nstructure and staff functions within three years of the effective date. The Government provided\nin principle approval of the reorganization of LGED in terms of nonengineering positions in an\nadjusted  organization;  50  percent  of  the  proposed  positions  are  to  be  established  in  the\nIntegrated Water Resources Development Unit (IWRD) of LGED within one year after loan\neffectiveness and all the proposed nonengineering positions are to be established within three\nyears after loan effectiveness.\n                  \n17\n  TA 1809-BAN: Strengthening LGED\u2019s Management Capability, for $470,000, approved on 21 December 1992.\nThe same recommendation has been made by the ADB-financed TA 3358 (footnote 3).", "11\n4. Holistic Water Resources Development\n40. Water  resources  development  benefits  those  engaged  in  fisheries.  However,  water\nresources  development  may  also  result  in  some  local  stakeholders,  particularly  fisherfolk\npracticing floodplain capture fishery, being adversely affected by such interventions without\nhaving the opportunity to share in the intervention's benefits. To mitigate this, the Government\nagreed, during policy dialogue, that by the conclusion of the implementation arrangements,\nfisheries development plans would be in place in accordance with the Government\u2019s Guidelines\non Participatory Water Management and National Fisheries Policy as well as ADB\u2019s fisheries\npolicy.  The  Government  will  provide  the  funding  for  the  fisheries  development  plans  for\nbalanced and holistic water resources development from counterpart funds and charges, fees,\nand dues collected for services and facilities by WMAs from members and nonmembers.\n5.  Water Sector Governance\n41. ADB\u2019s policy dialogue with the Government highlighted the importance of water sector\ngovernance. The Government agreed to enhance the accountability of water infrastructure\nprovider to WMA-based local communities through implementation agreements and sustainable\ncost  recovery  for  small-scale  water  resources  infrastructure  based  on  local  community\nparticipation  through  O&M  agreements  and  transfer  agreements  to  LGIs.  In  addition  to\ndeepening  local  participation  to  support  sustainable  cost  recovery  through  contractual\nagreements, the Government also agreed to time-bound covenants requiring the Government to\nensure that annual external performance monitoring by a reputable, private, external consulting\nfirm  could  be  effectively  carried  out  and  external  evaluation  by  an  external  institute\naccomplished within one year of the effective date.\nIV.      THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n42. Since 90 percent of the country\u2019s poor live in rural Bangladesh, agriculture and rural\ndevelopment are critical elements of the poverty reduction strategy of the Government. Key\nconstraints for rural poverty reduction include (i) lack of physical infrastructure; (ii) lack of\nsupport services including extension, marketing, and financial services; (iii) lack of high-quality\nagricultural inputs; (iv) suboptimal utilization of water resources; and (v) lack of access to basic\nsocial services. These were also identified as priority areas of intervention under the framework\nof the partnership agreement signed by the Government and ADB in April 2000.\n43. Water is the foundation for many rural livelihood activities of the rural poor, including\nfisheries, transportation, water supply, and agriculture.  Effective water resources management,\nthen,  is  fundamental  when  addressing  pervasive  rural  poverty  problems  while  promoting\neconomic growth in Bangladesh. This critical water resource has to be managed in a strategic,\nintegrated,  and  participatory  manner  that  includes  mobilizing,  organizing,  and  empowering\nstakeholders.\n44. The Government\u2019s commitment to a system of sound water resources management\naddressing these issues was reflected in the BWFMS and FFYP developed by the mid-1990s.\nBased on the Government\u2019s main instrument to have the strategy implemented, the SSWRDSP\nwas launched in 1996 to enhance rural incomes by developing community-based WMAs and\ncommunity-managed, small-scale infrastructure. It has been an effective means to reduce rural\npoverty.", "12\n45.  Participatory water resources development and management is necessary to effectively\nimplement  key  principles  by  strengthening  the  implementation  framework;  this  has  been\ndemonstrated under the SSWRDSP. Key elements still be incorporated include (i) ensuring\nstringent coordination of stakeholders at the earliest stages of the project cycle through effective\ninternal quality control and support; (ii) delineating increasing roles for LGI involvement in line\nwith the local government reforms along with necessary capacity development of LGIs; (iii)\nreorganizing  LGED  as  an  effective  water  resources  sector  agency  with  the  necessary\nmanagerial capacity for nonengineering issues; and (iv) supporting completed subprojects with\nsound  financial,  social,  and  technical  audits.  Expansion  of  small-scale  water  resources\ndevelopment is one of the key elements to reducing rural poverty effectively.\nB.       Objectives and Scope\n46. The overall goal of the Project is to support the Government\u2019s poverty reduction effort by\nincreasing sustainable agricultural and fishery production. The Project\u2019s objective is to develop\nsustainable stakeholder-driven, small-scale water resources management systems with special\nattention to the poorer section of the population. This objective will be achieved by (i) developing\nimproved means of beneficiary participation in the selection, design, implementation, and O&M\nof  small-scale  water  resources  management  development  systems;  (ii)  rehabilitating  and\nconstructing  small-scale  water  resources  management  infrastructure  with  appropriate\nagricultural  extension,  fisheries  extension,  and  aquaculture  development;  (iii)  developing\neffective management of environmental and social impacts of subprojects, including on those\nengaged in practicing floodplain capture fisheries; and (iv) developing institutional strengthening\nand  capacity  building  of  relevant  Government  and  stakeholder  organizations  to  ensure\nadequate support for small-scale water resources development at all levels.\n47. During the project preparatory (footnote 3), a comprehensive study was carried out in the\nfour  sample  subprojects,  which  were  selected  to  represent  about  300  small-scale  water\nresources schemes scattered in the entire country. The study indicates that these subprojects\nwill  deliver  agricultural  benefits  meeting  local  needs  priorities.  Environmental,  social,  and\npoverty impacts are expected to be positive. Approximately 75 percent of the farmers in the four\nsubproject areas are smallholders and marginal and landless farmers. The proportion of poor (a\nrange from 60 percent to 70 percent) among project beneficiaries is larger than their proportion\nin the overall population of the country (46 percent).\n48. The Project will be implemented in 61 of the country\u2019s 64 districts.18  While the ongoing\nSSWRDSP  concentrated  on  the  western  parts  of  the  country,  the  new  project  will  be\nimplemented across the entire nation in line with medium- and long-term investment plans for\nsmall-scale water resources development. Approximately 300 planned subprojects are expected\nto result in sustainable water engagement infrastructure benefiting between 180,000 ha, and\n200,000  ha  of  land  cultivated  by  over  280,000  farm  households.  Subprojects  will  cover  a\ncommand area of up to 1,000 ha with an average of some 650 ha of benefited area in line with\nexperience to date. Consistent with a sector approach and in accordance with the NWMP and\nNWP, the Project will help the Government develop sustainable small-scale water resources for\nbetter sector performance. The Project will be implemented by strengthening LGED, which has\nperformed satisfactorily under the SSWRDSP.\n                  \n18  The Project will not be operating in the Chittagong Hill Tracts considering the different physical, institutional, and\nsociocultural conditions. Interventions for submersible embankments in the northwest region will be considered\nonly if it can be proven that beneficiaries have the capacity to sustainably manage such structures, given the\nunsatisfactory experience with such structures in the past.", "13\n49. The project activities are grouped into two components: Participatory Water Resources\nDevelopment, and Institutional Strengthening of the Small-Scale Water Resources Sector.\n1. Component A: Participatory Water Resources Development\n50. Component A will support participatory development of the anticipated 300 small-scale\nwater resource subprojects. To achieve this, the Project will utilize a process of subproject\nselection, appraisal, and design involving area stakeholders throughout its implementation.\nWMAs will be established and provided with substantial institutional support for 3.5 years before\nand during construction.  The WMAs are expected to be involved in design discussions as well\nas in overseeing the construction process and will later take full responsibility for O&M once the\nsubprojects are handed over to them. To expedite beneficiaries\u2019 productive adjustment to their\nnew water regimes, postconstruction fishery and agricultural programs will work with the WMAs.\nMonitoring and quality control mechanisms will gauge environmental and benefit attainment\nissues in each subproject.\na.  Mobilization of Beneficiary Participation\n51. The Project will provide extensive training for mobilizing beneficiaries to participate in\nsubproject selection, planning, implementation, and O&M.  Participatory rural appraisals (PRAs)\nwill be conducted to assess stakeholder\u2019s needs and their concept of the proposed subprojects.\nSubproject appraisals will go through the selection process as well as provide the foundation for\ndesigns that will incorporate appropriate social, economic, and engineering aspects. NGOs will\nbe contracted to facilitate WMA development in subproject areas. This will include (i) training\nand  fielding  of  male  and  female  facilitators  and  community  organizers;  (ii)  organizing  and\ntraining  labor  contracting  societies  (LCSs);  and  (iii)  training  of  upazila  and  district-level\nengineers  on  the  procedures  and  skills  required  for  beneficiary  participation  and  WMA\ndevelopment. The training of WMA members will include the basic requirements regarding\ncooperative management and administration, construction supervision, and O&M planning and\nmanagement. The full backing of each local community will be focused through the WMAs and\nany resource-use conflicts identified (and, if possible, resolved) at the outset of the process.\nb.  Community-Based Infrastructure Development\n52. The  Project  will  support  the  development  of  new  civil  works  to  rehabilitate  and/or\nupgrade the following types of water management schemes:\n(i)  Flood management.  Rehabilitate and construct embankments and/or sluice gates\nto reduce the extent and duration of flooding of farmland.\n(ii)  Drainage improvement. Reexcavate drainage canals to increase the capacity of\ndrainage systems to benefit fisheries and local navigation as well as agriculture.\n(iii)  Water conservation. Develop the water retention capacity of existing baors, beels,\nand canals to increase availability of irrigation water by installing a water retention\nstructure and by reexcavating of the bed of the water body.\n(iv)  Command area development. Improve the existing irrigation system by providing\nbetter distribution systems (improved canal networks, lining of canals, installation of\nwater control structures, etc.) to extend the irrigable area.\nWhere needed, fish-friendly structures will be incorporated into the designed infrastructure.", "14\n53. Designed by private Bangladeshi consulting firms, the water management infrastructure\nwill be built by local contractors. The design and operating modalities of the infrastructure will\nminimize the negative impact on fisheries and provide for appropriate mitigation measures such\nas controlled partial flooding of the subproject area. The WMAs will be closely involved in design\nand construction, and responsible for the eventual O&M of the infrastructure.\nc.  Water Resources Oriented Support Programs\n54. The Project will provide agricultural extension services in the subproject area through\nlocal offices of the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) to promote rapid adoption of\nimproved, environmentally sound agricultural practices made possible or more attractive to\nfarmers through their subproject\u2019s water resources development.  In particular, the Project will\nsupport  (through  training  and  services  such  as  soil  testing)  (i)  introducing  integrated  pest\nmanagement to encourage optimum use of agrochemicals, (ii) expanding production of high\nyielding variety rice crops, and (iii) diversifying cropping patterns to increase farm revenues and\nimprove nutrition. These activities address (i) measures necessary to adjust cropping patterns\nand intensity in the subproject area, and (ii) mitigation of the loss of floodplain fisheries.\n55. The Department of Fisheries (DOF) will provide fisheries extension to the concerned\nstakeholders  and  train  them  in  managing  the  fisheries  resources  available  to  them  in  the\nsubproject area's beels, khals and other open and semiopen water bodies. Culture fishery\nopportunities such as those created in the khals behind water retention structures will be\nreserved for the poor and those having lost access to floodplain fisheries. Khas water bodies\nwithin the subproject boundaries will be leased out to the poor for a nominal fee.\nd.  Monitoring and Quality Control\n56. The Project will ensure the effective identification and management of environmental\nimpacts at each subproject site by applying procedures and guidelines developed under the\nSSWRDSP for (i) undertaking an initial environmental examination (IEE) environmental impact\nassessment (EIA) during the PRAs and feasibility study periods; (ii) preparing an environmental\nmanagement plan; and (iii) monitoring and managing impacts, both inside and outside the\nsubproject benefit area. Environmental indicators, including water quality, will be monitored\nduring  construction  of  the  infrastructure  and  during  the  infrastructure's  subsequent  O&M.\nAppropriate corrective measures will be taken in cases where the value of an indicator is found\nto lie outside the acceptable range of values. A biodiversity baseline study will be carried out.\nAs part of the environmental program, a selection of local stakeholders will receive training in\nthe use of sensitive ecosystems. Such training is intended to both encourage responsibility for\nactivities  relative  to  the  environment  and  enable  local  people  to  more  effectively  monitor\nenvironmental effects of their subprojects.\n57. A monitoring system will be utilized to enable project management to effectively control\nthe quality of both institutional and construction aspects of the Project. In addition, benefit\nmonitoring functions will help track the effectiveness of completed subprojects in fulfilling the\nProject\u2019s objectives of enhanced agricultural production and poverty reduction.\n2. Component B: Institutional Strengthening of the Small-Scale Water\n Resources Sector\n58. Institutional strengthening provided under component B will enhance the capacity of\nconcerned  sector  organizations  to  effectively  participate  in  small-scale  water  resources", "15\ndevelopment. This program will include (i) the advisory services of an international consulting\nfirm in association with a national firm or firms, and (ii) the training of organizations (other than\nWMAs)19 involved in the Project's implementation.\na. Support for Project Management\n59. Consulting services will be provided to assist LGED in building up its capacity at the\nnational, district, and upazila levels to manage the planning and construction of small-scale\nwater  management  infrastructure  and  in  managing  the  use  and  maintenance  of  the\ninfrastructure on behalf of local government. Assistance will primarily be provided to (i) refine\nand develop the systems and procedures established under the SSWRDSP for subproject\nplanning, design, construction, O&M, environmental monitoring, social monitoring, and benefit\nmonitoring  and  evaluation;  (ii)  refine  the  systems  and  procedures  established  under  the\nSSWRDSP to prepare environmental reports and implement mitigation plans and monitoring of\nenvironmental impacts; (iii) review bylaws for WMAs; (iv) facilitate the planning, programming,\nand  quality  control  of  subprojects;  and  (v)  guide  LGED  in  meeting  ADB's  reporting\nrequirements. By the end of the Project, LGED will be expected to have an improved capacity to\nundertake small-scale water resources development without substantial additional TA.\nb. Capacity Building for Sustainable Management\n60. According  to  perceived  needs,  the  Project  will  provide  training  for  institutional\nstrengthening within various organizations involved in the small-scale water resources sector.\nWhile some of this strengthening is aimed at enhancing performance in the implementation of\nthe  water  resources  development  activities  of  the  Project,  the  training  program  is  largely\nintended to enhance the long-term abilities of the institutional stakeholders involved to carry out\nsmall-scale  water  resources  development  according  to  the  NWP.  The  Project  will  support\nestablishment of a water resources development unit within LGED headquarters capable of\nmanaging the development process. The training program will develop awareness of upazila-\nand district-level staff of the principal engineering and nonengineering dimensions of small-scale\nwater resources development; and build capacity of staff to play a meaningful role in the\nparticipatory  identification  and  planning  of  subprojects,  and  to  effectively  manage  the\nimplementation of subprojects.\n61. The consulting services team will design the programs, select and contract competent\nagencies  to  provide  the  training,  and  supervise  and  evaluate  the  delivery  of  the  training\nprogram.  The training will be designed in response to well-defined needs and provided in\naccordance with priorities based on the urgency of those needs.\nC.        Cost Estimates\n62. The project cost is estimated at $78.0 million, of which $15.9 million is the foreign\nexchange cost (20 percent) and $62.1 million equivalent (80 percent) the local currency cost.\nTable 1 summarizes these cost estimates, the details of which are set out in Appendix 5.\n                  \n19  Training of the WMAs is part of the mobilization of beneficiary participation subcomponent of component A.", "16\n    Table 1: Cost Estimates\n            ($ million)\nComponent   Foreign    Local  Total\nExchange Currency   Cost\nA:   Participatory Water Resources 10.7        55.9 66.6\n      Development\nB:  Institutional Strengthening of Small-Scale           4.2 6.2 10.4\n      Water Resources Sector\n      Subtotal (A&B) 14.9 62.1 77.0\nService Charge   1.0 0.0   1.0\n      TOTAL 15.9 62.1 78.0\nD.  Financing Plan\n63. ADB will provide a loan equivalent to $34.0 million from its Special Funds resources to\nfinance about 44 percent of the total cost of the Project. The loan will finance foreign exchange\ncosts estimated at $7.6 million (48 percent of the total foreign exchange cost) and $26.4 million\nof the local currency cost. The Government of the Netherlands confirmed that it will provide\ngrant funds totaling $24.3 million (to cover $8.3 million of the foreign exchange cost and $19.8\nmillion of the local currency cost) for part of component A for NGO services and civil works, and\nmost of component B for consulting services and training. The Government will provide the local\ncurrency cost estimated at $17.3 million equivalent (22 percent of total cost) for incremental\nproject  staff,  taxes  and  duties,  and  land  acquisition  and  compensation.  In  addition,  the\nbeneficiaries are expected to contribute approximately $2.4 million equivalent in the form of\nO&M costs incurred during the project implementation. The financing plan is summarized in\nTable 2 and details are provided in Appendix 5.\n                        Table 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nSource of      Foreign       Local     Total\nFinancing    Exchange    Currency     Cost  Percent\nAsian Development Bank         7.6        26.4      34.0     44\nNetherlandsa         8.3        16.0      24.3     31\nGovernment         0.0        17.3      17.3     22\nBeneficiaries         0.0          2.4        2.4       3\n      Total       15.9        62.1      78.0    100\na\n The Netherlands Government has assured ADB that grant funds would be approved before loan effectiveness\nscheduled for the fourth quarter of 2001. About $8.53 million equivalent will be provided for consulting services.\nThe consultants will be selected by ADB, and engaged and administered by the Government of Bangladesh.\nE. The Executing Agency\n64. The LGED under Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives\n(MOLGRDC) will be the Executing Agency for the Project.", "17\nF.        Implementation Arrangements\n1. Organizational Arrangements\n65. The implementation arrangements developed under the SSWRDSP will be applied for\nthe Project with improvements. A project steering committee will be formed and consist of\nrepresentatives of all ministries and agencies concerned.20 The committee will be chaired by the\nsecretary of MOLGRDC, with the chief engineer, LGED as member-secretary. Representatives\nfrom  ADB\u2019s  Bangladesh  Resident  Mission  and  the  Government  of  the  Netherlands  will\nparticipate in the committee as observers. Committee meetings will be held semiannually during\nthe first year and annually from the second year to provide overall coordination, or whenever an\nissue requiring interministerial coordination arises.\n66. The organization chart in Appendix 6 shows the relationships of the various entities\nparticipating in project implementation. The project management office (PMO), established at\nLGED  headquarters  in  Dhaka  since  July  1995  to  manage  implementation  of  the  ongoing\nSSWRDSP, will be transformed to the PMO for the proposed Project by 31 October 2001. A\nsenior engineer of LGED of the rank of executive engineer or higher heads the PMO as project\ndirector. The PMO will have full authority to execute the Project and liaise with ADB. The PMO\nwill (i) coordinate with other agencies concerned; (ii) prepare an overall implementation plan and\nannual project work plans and budgets; (iii) review and approve subproject appraisals; (iv)\nreview and approve designs; (v) supervise LGED district offices in preparing tender documents,\nevaluating bids, and awarding contracts for equipment, civil works, and other project activities;\n(vi) maintain financial accounts; (vii) prepare periodic reports on implementation progress; and\n(viii) monitor project progress and evaluate environmental impact,21 social impact, and project\nbenefits for poor people.\n67.  Under  close  guidance  and  supervision  of  the  PMO,  LGED  district  offices  will  be\nresponsible for the day-to-day implementation at the subproject level with assistance from the\nLGED upazila offices. The LGED district executive engineer will act as subproject manager and\n(i) prepare individual subproject implementation plans in consultation with local stakeholders; (ii)\ncoordinate  with  other  agencies  and  NGOs,  firms,  and  institutes  concerned;  (iii)  help  local\nstakeholders to organize into WMAs with support from NGO, and firm facilitators and LGED\ncommunity organizers; (iv) carry out field surveys with support from the PMO quality control\nassurance  (design)  unit;22  (v)  supervise  construction  activities  and  make  payments  to\ncontractors; and (vi) monitor and report subproject development to the PMO.\n68. A  district-level  small-scale  water  resources  development  committee  chaired  by  the\ndeputy  commissioner with the  assistance of the LGED district  executive engineer,  as\nmember-secretary  will  meet when  required  to  coordinate   the  activities  of  the  Government\n                  \n20\n The Project Steering Committee will include Ministry of Finance Ministry of Water Resources, BWDB, Water\nResources Planning Organization, Ministry of Agriculture, Department of Agricultural Extension, NGO Affairs\nBureau, Ministry of Land, Ministry of Youth and Sports, Department of Youth Development, Department of\nWomen's Affairs, Rural Development and Cooperatives Division of MOLGRDC, Department of Cooperatives,\nMinistry  of  Fisheries  and  Livestock,  DOF,  Department  of  Environment,  Economic  Relations  Division,\nImplementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division, and Planning Commission.\n21  The results of monitoring the environmental impact will be submitted to Department of Environment.\n22 This unit will recruit a senior design engineer, hydrologist, four midlevel engineers, four junior water resource\nengineers, and supporting staff.", "18\nagencies.23  MOLGRDC will issue an order requiring the Upazalial Development Coordination\nCommittee, composed of the union chairpersons and upazila-level officials, to put the review of\nthe subproject progress on the agenda of all its regular meetings. LGED district offices will\nmaintain close coordination with BWDB through the Inter-Agency Project Evaluation Committee\nto ensure that proposed subprojects do not conflict with planned or existing BWDB projects.\n69. In  support  of  LGED\u2019s  implementation,  DAE  will  provide  technical  input  during\nidentification, appraisal, and design of each subproject, and training and extension for increased\ncrop  production  and  diversification.  DOF  will  provide  technical  input  during  identification,\nappraisal, and design of each subproject. DOF will contribute to the fisheries development\nactivities focusing on the support to the project-affected persons. Department of Environment\nwill review the IEEs/EIAs of subprojects and monitor the environmental impact of the Project\nindependently. Qualified national NGOs, firms, or institutes will be recruited for PRAs and\nbeneficiary mobilization of the WMAs to ensure effective subproject screening and stakeholder\ninvolvement and to form and train WMAs and LCSs. Such NGOs, firms, or institutes will be\nselected by the PMO in consultation with the consultants. NGOs will also assist the LCS\nparticipants in identifying sources for credit and other assistance.\n2.  Subproject Selection, Processing, and Environmental Assessment\n70. To qualify for inclusion under the Project, a subproject must meet the following criteria:  \n \n(i)  The subproject must be in line with the district strategies and guidelines for small-\nscale  water  resources  interventions  to  be  developed  during  the  process  of  the\nNWMP as approved.\n(ii)  More than 40 percent of the subproject benefit area will be operated by landless\nsharecroppers, and marginal or small farmers (up to 1.0 ha); preference will be given\nto subprojects with higher percentages of land operated by these farmers and to\nsubprojects located in food-deficit areas.24\n(iii)  Each  subproject  will  entail  rehabilitating  or  upgrading  an  existing  water  control\nsystem, which may include new supplementary structures in existing systems.\n(iv)  Not more than 30 percent of the households depend on full-time or part-time capture\nfisheries within the subproject area.\n(v)  The subproject cost must not exceed $1,000/ha for command area development\nschemes and $500/ha for other schemes without ADB approval.\n(vi)  The benefited area served by the subproject must be more than 50 ha and must not\nexceed 1,000 ha.\n(vii)  Each subproject must be technically feasible; economically viable (the economic\ninternal rate of return [EIRR] should be more than 12 percent); and socially and\nenvironmentally sound (requiring no or minimal displacement of people and land\nacquisition.\n(viii)  The  IEE  or  EIA  study  has  been  undertaken  and  appropriately  approved  after\nconsulting the beneficiaries and those affected by the project, concluding that the\nsubproject  is  environmentally  sound  and  the  negative  consequences  can  be\nmitigated.\n                  \n23\n  It will include the additional deputy commissioner (revenue), the concerned LGED upazila engineer, and the\ndistrict-level representatives of DAE, Department of Cooperatives, DOF, Department of Women\u2019s Affairs and\nDepartment of Youth Development. The meeting will address issues like access of WMAs to the public water\nbodies and land acquisition.\n24  This will be applied to ensure that the proportion of poor among project beneficiaries will be substantially higher\nthan national average.", "19\n(ix)  Local stakeholders of each subproject must have indicated support for the proposed\nsubproject and willingness to form a WMA, or in the case of a subproject with mainly\nfisheries benefits, fisherfolk must support the undertaking.\n(x)  Recurrent maintenance costs of each subproject beneficiary will be covered by the\nO&M budget of the WMA's O&M committee, and funds collected from the direct\nsubproject beneficiaries in proportion to the benefit they receive.\n71. On the basis of the selection criteria and in consultation with stakeholders, the union\nparishad  will  initiate  a  subproject  proposal.  The  LGED  upazila  engineer  will  prepare  the\nsubproject proposal and submit it to the UDCC for clearance. Then, the LGED upaliza engineer\nwill submit the proposal to the PMO through the LGED district executive engineer. The PMO will\nprescreen the proposal during a multidisciplinary field reconnaissance visit. This is followed by\n(i) a PRA with the engagement of contracted NGOs, firms, or institutes, and (ii) a feasibility\nstudy with the engagement of private firms, both undertaken by the PMO in consultation with\nbeneficiaries  and  affected  persons,  Union  Parishad,  and  the  Upazalial  Development\nCoordination  Committee.  Viable  subprojects  will  be  cleared  by  the  Inter-Agency  Project\nAppraisal Committee.  The detailed design will be prepared by the PMO after the prescreening\nof the subproject proposal.\n3.  Water Management Associations and Infrastructure Development\n72. Following subproject approval, the process of establishing WMAs will be initiated under\nthe legal framework of the Cooperatives Societies Ordinance (1984) and Cooperative Societies\nRules (1987) as amended; the new Cooperatives Act, which is due to be enacted; or alternative\nlegal framework, which may be framed pursuant to the recommendations of the Interagency\nTask  Force  on  Guidelines  for  Participatory  Water  Management.  Contracted  facilitators  will\npromote membership enrollment, collection of beneficiary contributions, preparation for election,\nconflict resolution, and registration. The PMO will also undertake engineering design work in\nconsultation with stakeholders. A resettlement (land acquisition) plan, if relevant, along with an\nenvironmental mitigation plan will also be drafted in consultation with those affected,25 with\nunion parishads providing coordination support.26 This process will culminate in the signing of a\nformal implementation agreement by the WMA, local government representatives, and LGED\u2019s\ndistrict  executive  engineer.  To  sign  the  implementation  agreement,  the  WMA  must  have\nachieved a number of preconditions including  (i) WMA enrollment of at least 70 percent of\nbeneficiary households;27 (ii) collection of beneficiary contributions equivalent to an annual O&M\nrequirement, deposited in a joint account by LGED and the WMA; and (iii) Borrower\u2019s approved\nplans in consultation with people-affected by the environmental mitigation and resettlement.\n73. Subsequent to the implementation agreement, tender invitation and LCS training will be\ninitiated. The WMA will actively participate in observing construction and may complain to the\nupazila  engineer  or  higher  authorities  under  a  complaints  procedure.  Final  payment  to\ncontractors will only be effected after sign off by a quality control engineer before the final bill.\nLGED  will  also  undertake  effective  internal  office  inspection  and  performance  audits  with\n                  \n25  The resettlement plan and the environmental mitigation plan will be signed-off by LGED and WMA to confirm that\nthose are prepared in order.\n26  For conflicts that cannot be resolved at this level, the matter will be raised to a committee established for this\npurpose through a notice in the official gazette issued by MOLGRDC called the Local Conflict Resolution\nCommittee. Until there is an elected chairperson at the upazila, the committee will be chaired by the upazila\nnirbahi officer. The members will be authorized to conduct inquiries and to take measures to enforce its decisions\nand to take preemptive action. The facilitators will facilitate this process.\n27  At the same time, enrollment of at least the same percentage of large- and medium-sized farm households will\nalso be checked and confirmed.", "20\nqualified engineers from the PMO and the consulting team. To direct benefits to the poor, all\nearthworks of the Project will be carried out by an LCS comprising vulnerable persons; destitute\nwomen will be given particular preference. The WMA will also receive DAE and DOF support to\nprepare agriculture and fisheries development plans. DAE and DOF will organize training for\nWMA representatives who will work as liaison extensionists to beneficiaries.\n4. Operation and Maintenance Arrangements\n74. In line with the NWP, each water control system rehabilitated and/or upgraded under the\nProject will be turned over to the WMA concerned within one year after completion. The WMAs\nwill have primary responsibility for O&M, including all routine and periodic maintenance, while\nthe Government will provide assistance for major improvements and repair of catastrophic\ndamage  due  to  events  exceeding  the  design  standards  of  the  infrastructure.  Through\nregistration of WMAs and leases of Government land, WMAs will be ensured adequate authority\nto implement their O&M responsibilities, including enforcing decisions, mobilizing resources\nfrom beneficiaries through fees, and managing embankment lands, waters, and other parts of\nthe  scheme.  The  Government  land  comprising  water  bodies,  embankments,  and  drainage\ncanals will be leased to the WMAs, which will promote income generating activities that use\nscheme facilities, such as tree planting on embankments and aquaculture in ponds and canals.\nThese will be targeted at providing opportunities for the poor.\n75. To establish sustainable O&M arrangements, the WMA will form an O&M committee\nduring the construction period, which will prepare a takeover schedule, beneficiary list and\nmaps, and an O&M plan comprising operating guidelines, maintenance plan, and resource\nmobilization plan, with assistance from the PMO. After civil works are completed, the PMO will\nprovide on-the-job training to the WMA for up to a full year to undertake (i) annual inspection\nthrough  a  joint  walk-through  by  the  WMA  and  LGED  upazila  staff,  (ii)  identification  of\nmaintenance needs, (iii) preparation and implementation of an annual O&M plan, and (iv)\nraising  and  collecting  of  O&M  fees.  After  this  period  and  satisfaction  of  preconditions  for\nsustainable O&M, the WMA will enter into a formal O&M agreement with the local government\non project facilities. After the O&M agreement is signed, the WMA will have access to the funds\nplaced  as  the  beneficiary  contribution,  which  will  be  jointly  managed  by  district  executive\nengineer and the WMA. To ensure sustainable operation of the WMA, LGED upazila staff will\nconduct annual inspections and provide technical guidance as needed. Annual audits will be\nundertaken by Department of Cooperatives.\n5.        Institutional Framework of WMAs\n76. The Project will help the Government study alternatives to cooperatives, such as WMAs,\nby (i) assessing the effectiveness of the existing institutional framework in attaining its objective\nof sustainable O&M, (ii) identifying potential measures for improvement including the possibility\nof  defining  an  alternative  legal  framework,  and  (iii)  preparing  actions  for  pilot  testing,\nestablishing, and operating the potential improved measures. The study will be conducted at the\nearly stage of project implementation after inception, in collaboration with the interagency task\nforce that prepared the Government\u2019s guidelines for Participatory Water Management, which\nhas endorsed the existing institutional framework of WMAs under ongoing SSWRDSP.\n6.  Implementation Schedule\n77. The Project will be implemented over seven years, including one-year for O&M support.\nImplementation  of  40  subprojects  whose  WMA  formation  was  initiated  under  the  ongoing", "21\nSSWRDSP will commence in the first and the second year. These subprojects are followed by\n260 new subprojects. The proposed implementation schedule is given in Appendix 7.  An\nimplementation schedule comprising four batches of subprojects (one batch commenced per\nyear  for  four  years)  has  been  prepared  on  this  basis,  with  adequate  overprogramming  of\nsubprojects under the institutional development process. The Project will also monitor and\nsupervise the O&M of schemes developed under the SSWRDSP.\n78. A typical subproject will take about two years for development of the WMA followed by\ntwo years for construction and an additional year for guidance on O&M, concurrently with\nagricultural  and  fishery  extension  support,  totaling  five  years  from  identification  to  O&M\nturnover. Project progress will be jointly reviewed biannually by the Bangladesh Government,\nADB, and the Government of the Netherlands to ensure that the required rate of progress is\nachieved without compromising project quality.\n7. Procurement\n79. Supplies to be procured under the Project, estimated to cost about $2.4 million and\nconsisting generally of service vehicles, construction equipment, computers, and survey and\nlaboratory equipment, will be packaged, procured, and awarded in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement.  Supply  contracts  not  anticipated  to  exceed  the  equivalent  of\n$500,000  will  be  awarded  in  accordance  with  international  shopping  procedures.  Other\nmiscellaneous equipment and supplies, with each package valued below the equivalent of\n$100,000, will be procured by direct purchase procedures.\n80. Civil  works  envisaged  under  the  Project  will  consist  mainly  of  small  labor-intensive\nconstruction activities at widely dispersed locations.  Construction techniques will be simple and\nof a type extensively used in Bangladesh.  The total cost of civil works contracts is estimated at\n$37 million, with an average cost of about $125,000 per contract. Such small contracts are\nunlikely to attract international contractors and are within the capability of local contractors.\nTherefore, all civil works contracts, except small earthwork contracts with LCSs will be awarded\nunder local competitive bidding procedures following standard LGED procedures acceptable to\nADB. A summary of prequalified contractors and the results of prequalification will be provided\nto ADB for information. Award of contracts valued above $300,000 equivalent will be subject to\nprior approval of ADB. Small earthwork contracts valued at less than $5,000 equivalent will be\ncarried out by LGED\u2019s force account utilizing LCSs of disadvantaged poor groups.\n8. Consulting Services\n81. The consultants will be selected by ADB and engaged by the Government in accordance\nwith  ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other  arrangements  on  the  use  of\ndomestic consultants satisfactory to ADB. A total of 937 person-months of consulting services is\nrequired, including 808 person-months of domestic and 129 person-months of international\nconsulting inputs. The total cost of the consulting services is estimated at about $8.3 million\nequivalent, and will be financed by the Government of the Netherlands on an untied grant basis.\nThe grant will be administered by ADB. Appendix 8 shows the outline terms of reference for\nconsulting services.\n9.       Loan Disbursements\n82. To ensure timely release of funds for small payments, an imprest account will be opened\nin  the  name  of  the  Project  at  a  commercial  bank  designated  by  the  Bangladesh  Bank", "22\nimmediately after loan effectiveness. The initial deposit of the imprest account will not exceed\n$3 million and be based on estimated expenditures of the first six months of project expenditure.\nThe statements of expenditure procedure will also be adopted to facilitate reimbursement and\nliquidation of a large number of small contracts, with a ceiling of $50,000 per contract in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2001).\n10. Monitoring and Evaluation\n83. The monitoring and evaluation of subprojects will be carried out under the direction of\nthe PMO. Necessary surveys will follow the prescriptions of ADB\u2019s Handbook on Benefit and\nMonitoring and Evaluation  (1992),  Environmental Guidelines for Selected Agricultural and\nNatural Development Projects (1991), Guidelines on Incorporation of Social Dimension in Bank\nOperations (1993), and Environmental Assessment Requirements and Environmental Review\nProcedures of the Asian Development Bank (1993). Within six months of loan effectiveness,\nLGED will have established a management information system based on the system developed\nfor SSWRDSP. This management information system will be used, among other things, for\ncontinuous effect monitoring and evaluation of all subprojects in the implementation plan of the\nSSWRDSP and the proposed Project in a manner acceptable to ADB.28 Specific indicators to be\nmonitored will include crop type, area, and yields; fisheries production and beneficiaries; water\nlevels, infrastructure operational status, water quality, institutional membership, financial status,\nmeetings, and elections, and O&M budgets, plans, funds collected, and funds disbursed.\n84. BME requires useful and statistically valid assessments and, to be meaningful, will be\ncarried out by independent specialized organizations contracted by the PMO. BME studies will\nbe  conducted  on  10  percent  of  subprojects  in  the  implementation  plan  and  the  impact\nassessment study will be carried out five years after subproject completion. The Government\nwill engage an organization, which will be contracted to carry out both the baseline and the\nimpact assessment studies. The BME shall assess farm income for different farm categories,\ndaily  wages,  additional  employment  creation  (gender  disaggregated),  in/out  migration,\ndistributive impacts of changes in fish production (distinguishing between capture and culture\nfishery), and perceptions of subproject benefits.\n85. In  addition,  the  Government  will  engage  a  consulting  team:  11  person-months  of\ninternational consulting and 22 person-months of domestic consulting to undertake external\nperformance monitoring and evaluation throughout the duration of the Project. This team will\nreview  work  progress  against  implementation  plans,  assess  the  quality  of  institutional\ndevelopment and construction activities, and provide advice leading to an overall improvement\nin project performance.\n11. Accounts, Audit, and Reports\n86. LGED will establish and maintain accounts for expenditures incurred under the Project.\nBased on successful performance of accounts, the Government will ensure that all accounts\nand related financial statements are audited by auditors acceptable to ADB. An audit report with\ncertified accounts and financial statements will be submitted to ADB within 12 months after the\nend of each fiscal year. The imprest account and expenditures reimbursement or replenished\nand liquidated under the statement of expenditures procedure will be included in the audit\n                  \n28 Data quality is expected to improve in the proposed Project because baseline data collection will be outsourced;\ntrained permanent staff of LGED will collect postproject effect data.", "23\nreport, and the opinion will be included separately in the audit report. The audit may be carried\nout as part of the regular annual audit of LGED\u2019s general accounts.\n87. The  PMO  will  prepare  quarterly  progress  reports  giving  details  on  progress  in  the\nstandard format described in the project administration memorandum, and will submit them to\nADB and the Royal Netherlands Embassy in Dhaka, within one month after the end of the\nperiod under review.  The PMO will also submit benefit monitoring and evaluation reports, the\nmidterm review report, and the project completion report (three months before the loan closing\ndate).\n88. The Project will contain a component for external performance review for monitoring the\nsubprojects of the ongoing SSWRSP and the proposed Project on the (i) status of WMA\ndevelopment and sustainability, (ii) progress of social and environmental measures, (iii) quality\nand functional status of infrastructure, and (iv) condition of O&M. Annual external performance\nmonitoring will be conducted by separate consulting firms.\n      12. Advance Procurement Action\n89. Upon  request  of  the  Government,  ADB  management  has  approved  advance\nprocurement action to facilitate timely implementation of the Project. Advance procurement\naction  was  required  for  procurement  of  urgently  needed  consulting  services,  materials,\nequipment, and vehicles. The Government was advised that approval of advance procurement\naction does not commit ADB to finance the Project.\n13.       Midterm Review\n90. A  comprehensive  midterm  review  will  be  conducted  jointly  by  the  Bangladesh\nGovernment, ADB, and the Government of the Netherlands, in the third year of implementation.\nThe review will include (i) progress of the Project, including planning and design, stakeholder\nparticipation, physical works construction quality, irrigation/drainage area rehabilitated and/or\nupgraded, and possibilities for modifying the project scope; (ii) future implementation plans and\ntargets;  (iii)  allocation  of  funds  among  loan  categories;  (iv)  effectiveness  of  the  project\nmanagement structures and implementation arrangements including TA consultants, and any\nneed  for  modifications;  (v)  environmental,  social,  economic,  and  technical  aspects  of  the\nProject; and (vi) institutional sustainability and progress on developing an adequate institutional\nframework at all levels. Compliance with loan covenants and reporting requirements will also be\nreviewed.\nG. Environmental and Social Measures\n1. Environmental Measures\n91. The Project is classified under environmental category B. IEEs were carried out in four\nsample subproject areas in accordance with ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines to assess possible\nadverse impacts arising from the Project. These subprojects include the four main types of\ninfrastructure  development  to  be  carried  out:  flood  control  and  management,  drainage\nimprovement, water conservation, and command area development. All the subprojects were\nconsidered environmentally sound as the possible negative consequences can be mitigated to\nan acceptable level. A summary IEE is attached as Appendix 9.", "24\n92. An IEE or EIA will be carried out for all subprojects, at the feasibility study level. When\nwarranted, a full-scale EIA, or other studies to deal with specific issues, will be undertaken.\nLGED will consult with the stakeholders about the environmental assessments prior to approval\nof all the subprojects to be constructed and forward a copy to the Department of Environment.\nBefore  undertaking  subproject  construction,  the  subproject  must  be  shown  to  be\nenvironmentally feasible and that any negative consequences can be mitigated to an acceptable\ndegree. Reports for subprojects that cost more than $1 million equivalent, must be submitted to\nADB for approval before their implementation. At its discretion, ADB may request to review a\nreport  before  implementation  of  subprojects  with  costs  estimated  at  less  than  $1  million\nequivalent.  Baseline  water  quality  information  will  be  established  by  taking  and  analyzing\nrepresentative samples of surface and groundwater for each subproject.\n93. The water management schemes to be upgraded and/or rehabilitated under the Project\nare relatively small. They are generally within existing flood control, drainage, and irrigation\nsystems, and as such, will not significantly affect the hydrology of the system. Most subprojects\nidentified will improve flood control and drainage, and reduce the effects of early floods during\nthe premonsoon period and water logging during the postmonsoon period; they will have a\nfavorable  environmental  impact.  Other  subprojects  will  provide  water  storage  to  enable\nadditional irrigation during the dry season.\n94. LGED has established an environmental monitoring program for the Project to quantify\neffects on the environment in environmentally sensitive subproject areas. The Government has\nrecognized  potential  problems  associated  with  intensive  agricultural  production  and  has\nsupported initiatives to introduce integrated pest management. The Project will continue to\nexpand integrated pest management activities through training and extension services, and the\nprovision of essential equipment for monitoring water quality.\n95. LGED capacity will be developed to support the imparting sustainable resource use ethic\namong beneficiaries.  This will form an integral part of an expanded training program for O&M\npersonnel  in  the  WMAs  and  local  LGED  staff,  as  well  as  representatives  from  the  union\nparishad.  An important aim of this approach is to ensure wetland and aquatic habitat is\npreserved as fish breeding sanctuaries and important biodiversity sites are not violated.\n96. To  reduce  any  adverse  impact  on  subsistence  floodplain  fisheries,  subprojects  will\ninclude improved design and management for sluice gate operation to ensure environmental\nrequirements are met for fish migration and land inundation during critical periods. Aquaculture\nwill be introduced in canals, borrow pits, ponds, and beels.\n2.  Social Measures\n97. A socioeconomic analysis was carried out in four subproject areas,29 to assess the\nexpected socioeconomic impact of the Project. The majority of farmers in the subproject areas\nare marginal farmers, with 0.2 to 0.5 ha of land (40 percent), and small-scale farmers, with 0.5\nto 1.0 ha (25 percent); 10 percent are landless farmers, and 25 percent have medium- and\nlarge-size holdings. The incidence of poverty is high. The landless and marginal farmers live\nbelow the extreme poverty line and the majority of smallholders fall below the moderate poverty\nline. The Project will contribute to increased agricultural production, improve food security, and\naddress the viability of poor rural people. Agriculture benefits from the subprojects are likely to\naccrue mainly to landowners. However, the project design ensures that the poor, including\n                  \n29  Abatpur, Choto Kumira, Purba Sayedpur, and Sriramkandi.", "25\nlandless and marginal farmers, at least share equally in the distribution of the income growth\nbenefit from the Project through increased agricultural production and employment opportunities\n(Appendix 10). The benefit gained by landowners due to increased value of land is expected to\nbe marginal.\n98. Groups of fisherfolk may be negatively affected by the Project. Where neither design,\nnor planning, nor implementation can reduce these groups\u2019 losses, mitigation measures will\nensure access to new opportunities for those who have lost out in capture fisheries. A fisheries\ndevelopment plan will be developed in a participatory manner in accordance with the Guidelines\non Participatory Water Management and ADB\u2019s fisheries policy ensuring that affected people\nmaintain their original standard of living at a level at least equal to what they enjoyed prior to the\nProject. Compensation will be provided by ensuring user rights to water bodies within the project\narea for the affected poor people (priority will be given to poor fisherfolk and destitute women)\nand by providing training to poor fisherfolk to increase the possibility of accessing alternative\nincome-generating activities. To facilitate this process the Project will provide assistance to\nestablish contact with existing microfinance programs. Additionally, preference will be given to\npoor fisherfolk and destitute women in terms of access to working opportunities generated by\nthe Project.\n99. Indigenous peoples issues are not anticipated to be significant in the Project (Appendix\n10). However, where issues related to indigenous peoples may be identified, ADB\u2019s Policy on\nIndigenous Peoples (1999) will be applied.\n100. The SSWRDSP found that women\u2019s equal participation and involvement in small-scale\nwater management projects is essential for the sustainability of subprojects. A gender strategy\nwill be developed for this Project,30 to ensure that gender concerns are addressed and dealt\nwith in the most effective and efficient manner. The Project will provide training (confidence\nbuilding and management skills) for women to enable them to participate in WMAs and will also\ngive specific attention to employment of female staff at all levels. Priority will be given to local\npoor women in (i) formation of LCSs, (ii) employment opportunities generated by the Project,\nand (iii) O&M work of the Project. Additionally, all relevant training activities included in the\nProject will address gender concerns, and at least 30 percent of participants in training activities\nshould be women. All facilitators, community organizers, socioeconomists, assistant engineers,\nand engineers will be trained in gender issues within the sector, and special training will be\nprovided for women on various aspects, such as vegetable gardening and production.\n101. Resettlement and land acquisition effects are not anticipated to be significant in the\nProject (Appendix 11). However, where land acquisition may be required, a land acquisition plan\nand resettlement plan will be prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement policy\nand Handbook on Resettlement  (1998), as amended from time to time.\n                  \n30 An international gender specialist and a national gender specialist will be posted at the PMO to develop and\nimplement a gender strategy for the Project.", "26\nV.      PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Financial and Economic Analyses\n1. Financial Analysis\n102. With the Project, farm financial returns (as indicated by increased net cropped income\nfor benefited farms) are expected to range from Tk4,400 to Tk6,100 per ha, a 25 to 56 percent\nincrease, depending on the subproject. To produce this additional agricultural output, labor\ndemand will also increase.  Labor income (combining both wage income and returns to family\nlabor) will, on a per ha basis, be expected to rise by an additional Tk1,900 to Tk2,600.  The ratio\nof expected benefits to regular O&M costs (for which landed beneficiaries are responsible)\nranges from 12 to 1 for Abatpur to 47 to 1 for Choto Kumira.  Financial returns, in other words,\nare such that farmers can easily undertake their O&M responsibilities and still have a large\nincentive to adopt the more intensive crop production made possible by the Project.\n103. The poor (including marginal farmers and smallholder households, as well as the actual\nand functionally landless) are expected to have a share in this increased income. The annual\nincome per household (from both agricultural production and increased labor usage) of this\ngroup is expected to rise by Tk3,000 to Tk3,900 (depending on the subproject). The share of\ntotal incremental financial benefits going to the poor is calculated to range from 44 percent in\nChoto Kumira to 62 percent in Purba Sayedpur.  In economic terms, in which the opportunity\ncost of labor in the whole country is taken into account, the share of total incremental benefits\naccruing to the poor, however, may range only from 35 to 56 percent (with a per/ha weighted\naverage of 39 percent); this more closely approximates the proportion of land owned by the\npoor within their respective subprojects.  The efficiency of the Project in delivering benefits to\nthe poor can be calculated (also in economic terms) by taking the ratio of the present value of\nbenefits going to the poor to the present value of public investment in the four subprojects. By\nthis measure, the poor can be expected to receive Tk1.4 in project benefits for every taka of\npublic investment.\n104. Based on the analysis of the sample subprojects, for the Project as a whole various\nresults can be expected: (i) rice production will increase by 180,000 tons, producing incremental\nnet crop income from rice of Tk820 million/year;  (ii) overall net crop income will rise by Tk975\nmillion (or 35 percent) in project areas; (iii) local labor demand will increase by 7.8 million days a\nyear (or about Tk420 million); (iv) about 280,000 households (1.7 million people) will benefit, at\nan average of Tk4,900/year/household; (v) beneficiaries will cover Tk47 million in regular O&M\ncosts, saving the Government (which would otherwise be responsible) $870,000 equivalent per\nyear  or  $17.4  million  over  the  20-year  life  of  the  Project.  The  incremental  benefits  of\nparticipating beneficiaries will sustain O&M costs of subprojects.\n2.  Economic Analysis\n105. The  Project  is  expected  to  cover  roughly  195,000  ha  incorporated  in  about  300\nsubprojects.  Over 280,000 farm families (1.7 million people) live in this aggregated area. While\ndirect beneficiaries will be families with land, many smallholders and marginal farmers as well\nas  the  functionally  landless  will  attain  some  level  of  output  benefit.  In  addition,  increased\ncropping intensity and a shift to high-yielding crop varieties will increase labor usage and family\nwage income.", "27\n106. Drainage infrastructure can bring more land into production and/or allow land to be\nproductive  throughout  more  of  the  year.  Flood  management  projects  reduce  losses  from\nflooding and allow the use of high-yielding varieties on more land.  Water conservation schemes\nwill allow supplementary irrigation in addition to increasing retained soil moisture after the rainy\nseason. Command area development directly increases irrigation and leads to a shift to higher\nproductivity irrigated agriculture.\n107. Four sample subprojects (Abatpur, Choto Kumira, Purba Sayedpur, and Sriramkandi)\nwere studied. The economic analysis (Appendix 12) of these subprojects produced EIRRs\nranging from 21 to 36 percent. Sensitivity analyses showed these results to be fairly robust.\nTests were conducted to see what would happen to returns if the rice price dropped (despite the\nWorld  Bank  projections  for  an  increase)  or  general  benefits  were  to  decrease.  Additional\nsensitivity  scenarios  included  a  possible  increase  in  the  cost  of  construction,  a  delay  in\nconstruction completion, and a decrease in subproject life (which might occur if beneficiaries do\nnot adequately fulfill their O&M responsibilities). While the subprojects remain economically\nviable at the tested levels of all of these items, the greatest risk to project returns would appear\nto be a substantial delay in construction completion.  A decrease in subproject life, on the other\nhand, would seem to have limited effect on returns; the minimum subproject life span of 4 to 7\nyears (compared with the 20 years assumed for the base case) would still produce an EIRR of\nat least 12 percent.\n108. The sample subprojects can be seen as reasonably representative of their types flood\nmanagement and water conservation schemes); these types comprise 83 percent of the 300\nexpected subprojects to be constructed.  To get a picture of the expected results for the full\nProject, the economic results from these sampled subprojects can be extrapolated on a per ha\nbasis.    The  overall  project  EIRR  based  on  this  method  is  19  percent  when  costs  of  the\nparticipatory water resource development component (including social mobilization, subproject\nselection,  project  management,  monitoring,  and  postconstruction  agricultural  and  fisheries\nprograms) are included.  If the costs of the institutional strengthening component are also\nincluded, the EIRR becomes 17 percent.\nB.        Environment\n109. Traditional agricultural practice in Bangladesh includes small-scale fish farming in private\nor village-owned ponds. These ponds also serve as homes for fish stock during the dry season\nand for floodplain fisheries during the wet season. Farming of fish in rice fields is also practiced.\nA significant part of farmers\u2019 income is derived from this source. Because of these practices\nwater management at the local level must be closely integrated to ensure that benefits from\nmultiple uses can be maximized. The technical design of subprojects aims to balance these\nneeds to maximize benefits. In undertaking the economic analysis for the Project, income from\nfarming,  fishing,  and  aquaculture  sources  have  been  included.  The  cultivated  areas  of\nfloodplains and wetlands also form important breeding grounds for natural fish stock in lakes,\nrivers, and coastal areas. Lower areas in floodplains form biodiversity sanctuaries for fish, birds,\nsmall  mammals,  insects,  and  vegetation.  These  areas  will  be  identified  in  environmental\nmanagement plans and maintained in subproject areas. Where reasonable to do so, they will be\nrehabilitated.  A  biodiversity  component  is  included  in  the  environmental  monitoring\narrangements for the Project.\n110. The  intensified  agricultural  and  fisheries  development  that  will  occur  as  a  result  of\nimplementing  the  Project  will  bring  with  it  increased  use  of  fertilizers  and  pesticides  with\nassociated environmental and economic risks. The Government has supported initiatives to", "28\nintroduce  integrated  pest  management  programs.  The  Project  will  continue  to  expand  the\nintroduction of integrated pest management by supporting this initiative through training and\nextension services for landholders in subproject areas. The Project will support capacity building\nin LGED by providing essential equipment for monitoring water and soil quality, and training in\ncarrying out these activities. Capacity building will be provided to all levels of LGED staff to\nsupport the planning and management functions to ensure sustainable use of natural resources\nby beneficiaries in subproject areas. This will also form an integral part of an expanded training\nprogram  for  O&M  personnel  in  the  WMAs  and  representatives  of  union  parishads.  The\nimportant aim of this is to ensure that the wetlands and aquatic habitats will be preserved as\nprotected fish-breeding areas.\nC. Impact on Poverty\n111. The Project will have direct positive impacts on the income employment opportunities\nand the food security situation of poor people in the subproject areas included in the Project.\nOver  280,000  families  (1.7  million  people)  live  in  this  area.  The  Project  will  contribute  to\nimproving the rural economy by enhancing agricultural production. Drainage infrastructure can\nbring more land into production and/or allow land to be productive throughout more of the year.\nFlood management subprojects reduce losses from flooding and allow the use of high-yielding\nvarieties on more land. Water conservation schemes allow supplementary irrigation in addition\nto increasing retained soil moisture after the raining season. Command area development\ndirectly increases irrigation and leads to a shift to higher productivity irrigated agriculture.\n112. Agricultural benefits from the subprojects are likely to accrue mainly to the landowners.\nThe poor, defined as landless, marginal, and smallholders, however, can also be expected to\nbenefit in the with project scenario as labor income from the land area owned by the poor will\nincrease and the poor will be hired on a wage basis to cover a part of the increased labor needs\nof medium and large landholders. In addition, labor for earthworks and other project-related\nconstruction and maintenance work will be drawn from local poor households. Overall, when\ncombining crop production and labor income, the poor may attain a total of 49 percent of local\nbenefits (in financial terms) of the project in Abatpur, 44 percent in Choto Kumira, 62 percent in\nPurba Sayedpur, and 58 percent in Sriramkandi. Finally, in some subproject areas, the Project\nwill generate employment opportunities due to increased access to captured fisheries.31\n113. In Choto Kumira, 853 poor households live within the project area (small, marginal\nfarmers, landless laborers, and destitute women). While distribution within this group is likely to\nbe uneven, the average incremental annual income per household (in financial terms) among\nthe poor is expected to be Tk3,025 per year. In Purba Sayedpur 585 poor households are\nexpected to benefit by Tk3,162 per year. In Abatpur and Sriramkandi subproject areas, 540 and\n254 poor households, respectively, are anticipated to receive an average incremental annual\nincome of Tk3,630 per year and Tk3,940 per year respectively.\n114. The rise in local household income and agricultural production will result in improved\nwelfare for the population in subproject areas. Water conservation is likely to have multiple uses\nin addition to irrigation, namely for livestock and domestic purposes. Adequate provision of\nwater supply for domestic purposes can reduce the time spent for women collecting water, lead\nto better health, and improve vegetable growing. Additionally, SSWRDSP subprojects have\n                  \n31\n  In five subprojects implemented under the SSWRDSP, 4 person-months of employment were created for 670\nindividuals benefiting close to 4,000 family members. The average daily income was around Tk75, combined with\nthe volume of work (average 4 months per individual), this had a considerable poverty reduction impact on the\nfamilies concerned.", "29\nshown that the SSWRDSP has had an impact in terms of crop diversification. Production of\nsugarcane, vegetables, and chilies has increased, generating employment opportunities for\nlandless farmers and women in harvesting, cleaning, and drying.\n115. The  Project  is  based  on  participatory  processes  during  selection,  design,\nimplementation, and O&M of subprojects. Participatory processes empower people and the\ninstitutions that affect their lives, to enable them to influence decisions that are made about their\ndevelopment  and  the  resources  involved.  The  Project  contributes  to  poor  beneficiaries\nmanaging and controlling water resources that are essential to their livelihood. Managing and\ncontrolling  water  resources  reduce  the  vulnerability  of  marginal  farmers  and  smallholders\nsignificantly, and thereby improves the possibility that they can move out of poverty.\nD. Risks\n116. Project risks center around areas of sustainability and project implementation capacity.\nThese risks are addressed by the Project.\n117. Much attention in project design has been paid to the sustainability of the subprojects to\nbe developed. O&M is to be the responsibility of those benefiting most from a subproject and\nwho are closest to it. The WMAs must demonstrate their ability and intent to undertake their\nO&M responsibilities by contributing an amount equivalent to 3 percent of the construction costs\nof earthworks and 1.5 percent of the cost of concrete structures, before construction can begin.\nThis amount is equivalent to the average annual amount that O&M functions are expected to\ncost. During subproject preparation, construction, and a postconstruction break-in period, a\ngreat deal of effort is to be put into preparing the beneficiaries to take over these O&M tasks.\nThe result should be WMAs that are both capable of and willing to perform their O&M tasks.\n118. Project sustainability will be further assured by the reorganization of LGED, which will\ncontinuously support small-scale water resources development activities in a much improved\nmanner. In addition, an increased sense of ownership of subprojects implemented under the\nproposed Project will contribute to improved maintenance of small-scale water resources.\n119. During  the  SSWRDSP,  management  capacity  has  steadily  increased  its  rate  of\nsubproject implementation.  Systems are in place and will be improved by the Project for survey\nand data collection, the feasibility analysis of subprojects, and construction management. The\nmobilization of effective WMAs has been troublesome in the past. However, for the Project, an\nimproved  system  of  contracting  effective  NGOs  to  be  fully  responsible  for  community\nmobilization is planned to be in place. The Project is also designed to have substantial input into\nstrengthening  the  small-scale  water  resources  sector,  which  should  have  the  payoff  of\nimproving implementation of development activities within the sector. Disruption of existing\nproduction systems during the construction will be minimized because construction activities will\nbe  scheduled  in  the  dry  season  (November-May)  when  construction  will  not  disrupt  the\ncultivation of monsoon crops or increase flood risk.\nVI.      ASSURANCES\nA. Specific Assurances\n120. The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents.", "30\n(i)  Within 18 months after the effective date, the Government will have enacted a\nnational water code satisfactory to ADB based on the NWP and the Guidelines\nfor  Participatory  Water  Management,  including  provisions  governing  the\nownership of small-scale water resources projects by LGIs, the role of LGIs and\nWMAs  in  the  development  of  small-scale  water  resources  projects,  an\nappropriate accompanying regulatory framework, and acquisition of water rights\nin accordance with ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines and  ADB\u2019s water policy.\n(ii)  Within  six  months  of  the  effective  date,  the  Cabinet  will  have  approved  a\ncooperatives  bill  satisfactory  to  ADB,  including  provisions  that  address  the\nrequirements of implementation and O&M agreements between WMAs and LGIs\npursuant to the Government\u2019s Guidelines on Participatory Water Management.\n(iii)  Within one year after the effective date, the Government will have enacted a\nCooperatives Act satisfactory to ADB.\n(iv)  Within six months of the effective date, the Interagency Task Force on Guidelines\nfor Participatory Water Management (the Interagency Task Force), including the\nWater Resources Planning Organization, will have established terms of reference\nsatisfactory  to  ADB  to  examine  the  identification  of  alternative  water\nmanagement  organizations,  the  need  for  enabling  legal  provisions  for  viable\nalternative water management organizations, and the feasibility of pilot testing\nalternative water management organizations.\n(v)  The  Government  shall  ensure  that  the  recommendations,  if  any,  of  the\nInteragency Task Force will be taken into account prior to enactment of the\nnational water code.\n(vi)  Within three months from the effective date, the Government will have issued an\nNWMP satisfactory to ADB based on the NWP and the BWFMS.\n(vii)  Within one year of the effective date, the Government will have implemented 50\npercent of the nonengineering positions within the integrated water resources\nunit  of  LGED  under  the  reorganization  of  LGED\u2019s  adjusted  organizational\nstructure and staffing functions to meet the requirements of small-scale water\nresources development in accordance with the Government- sanctioned action\nplan of LGED satisfactory to ADB.\n(viii)  Within three years of the effective date, the Government will have completed\nimplementation  of  all  the  positions  under  the  reorganization  of  the  LGED\u2019s\nadjusted organizational structure and staffing functions to meet the requirements\nof small-scale water resources development in accordance with the Government-\nsanctioned action plan of LGED satisfactory to ADB.\n(ix)  To  enable  annual  external  performance  monitoring  for  the  Project,  the\nGovernment will ensure that all necessary data, information, and cooperation will\nbe provided on a timely basis to a reputable, private, external consulting firm\nwhose experience, qualifications, and terms of reference are acceptable to ADB.\nTo enable an external evaluation of the Project within one year of the effective\ndate,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  all  necessary  data,  information,  and", "31\ncooperation  is  provided  on  a  timely  basis  to  an  institute  whose  experience,\nqualifications, and terms of reference are acceptable to ADB.\n(x)  The Government will ensure that prior to concluding implementation agreements\nbetween  LGED,  LGIs,  and  WMAs  under  the  Project,  there  will  be  fisheries\ndevelopment plans agreed upon with ADB in accordance with the Government\u2019s\nNational Fisheries Policy, the Government\u2019s Guidelines for Participatory Water\nManagement, and the fisheries policy of ADB.\nB.        Conditions for Loan Effectiveness\n121. Prior to loan effectiveness\n(i) the  Local  Government  Division  of  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government,  Rural\nDevelopment and Cooperatives will have approved the project proforma for the\nProject; and\n(ii) the Government will have obtained the Netherlands grant or have made other\narrangements, satisfactory to ADB, to commit the provision of foreign exchange\nfunds intended to be provided by the Netherlands grant.\nC.

Status of Implementation\n1. The  objective  of  Small-Scale  Water  Resources  Development  Sector  Project\n(SSWRDSP)1 is to attain sustainable growth in agricultural production and incomes in western\nBangladesh by establishing infrastructure and self-sustaining institutions for small-scale water\nresources management, covering an area of about 150,000 hectares. As of March 2001, 280\nsubprojects had water management associations (WMAs) formed, 192 had initiated construction\nof infrastructure, and 52 were completed respectively. The overall implementation progress was\nestimated at 66 percent against a loan elapsed period of 73 percent of the project period. A\nproject midterm review undertaken in October 1999 noted that the project implementation was\ngenerally satisfactory, and would be completed as per original objectives and scope, although\nimprovement was required in terms of (i) increasing beneficiary participation, and (ii) improving\nthe quality of construction. These findings were also reaffirmed by reviews in May and October\n2000,  and  February  2001.  The  Government  has  been  progressively  developing  its  own\ncapacity. The loan covenants have generally been complied with.\nB.  Preliminary Project Benefits and Poverty Impacts\n2. The envisaged project benefits include (i) cereal and noncereal production by 75,000\ntons per annum by 2005, and (ii) incremental employment opportunities of hired and family\nagricultural labor by 2.81 million person-days per annum. According to the Project\u2019s effect\nmonitoring and evaluation system, the data collected in the completed schemes covering about\n18,000 ha indicate that targets for cereal and noncereal production are being achieved.\n3. A preliminary assessment of poverty reduction impacts for completed representative\nsubprojects are shown in Table A3.1. The percentage of poor households among beneficiaries\nin  these  subprojects  is  higher  than  the  national  average.  These  subprojects  have  already\ngenerated substantial benefits for rural people. In terms of agriculture, production has increased\nby  30\u2013130  percent,  thereby  substantially  improving  the  food  security  for  low-income  farm\nhouseholds. Vulnerability to external shocks such as floods has also been reduced from the\ncompleted flood protection works. These subprojects have also provided substantial incremental\nemployment opportunities to the landless, marginal, and small farm households. In terms of\nfisheries, the subprojects have also demonstrated strong impacts. The experience of Jabusha\nBeel subproject is illustrative, with the substantial increase in fishery production benefiting the\nsignificant  proportion  of  subproject  households  including  the  poor.2  Likewise,  the  sample\nsubprojects  have  also  showed  strong  impacts  in  terms  of  social  mobilization  of  the  poor,\nproviding opportunities for participating in key decision making of the WMAs and their activities\nby accounting for the majority of their membership.\nC.  Lessons Learned\n4. Important lessons can be learned from the implementation of the SSWRDSP for the\ndesign  of  the  Second  Small-Scale  Water  Resources  Development  Project;  these  are\nsummarized in Table A3.2.\n                                                          \n1 Loan 1381-BAN: Small-Scale Water Resources Development Sector Project, for $32.0 million, approved on 26\nSeptember 1995; Loan 391-BAN: Small-Scale Water Resources Project, for SDR7.0 million, approved on 7\nDecember 1995; and TA 2564-BAN: Beneficiary Participation and Project Management, for $6.8 million, a grant\nprovided by the Government of the Netherlands, and administered by ADB, approved on 2 May 1996.\n2  The subprojects located in coastal areas have similar potential through fish culture.", "Table A3.1: SSWRDSP \u2013 Poverty-Related Impacts of Selected Subprojects\nSubproject Name Jabusha Beel FCD Brajamul Bhitikhal FCD Rampur FCD\nTotal Benefit Area (ha) 790 504 212\nBeneficiary\n1,090 616 400\nHouseholds\n% of Poor Households\n 56%  53%  49%\nAmong Beneficiaries\nProject Facilities - Embankment resectioning: 5.7 km - Embankment resectioning: 1.2 km - Embankment resectioning: 1.4 km\n- Canal reexcavation: 5.2 km - Canal reexcavation: 2.8 km - Canal reexcavation: 1.9 km\n- Regulators: 5 locations - Regulators: 3 locations - Regulator: 1 location\nMain Project Benefits - [Monsoon] Protection from saline - [Monsoon] Flood protection - [Monsoon] Flood protection\n   water intrusion - [Dry season] Drainage improvement - [Dry season] Water retention\n- [Dry season] Water retention in dry - [Dry season] Water retention\nseason\nAgriculture Benefits - Rice production increased by 130% to -  Rice production increased by 30% to - Cereal production increased by 70%\n2,500 tons 2,500 tons to 950 tons, with crop diversification\n- Substantial reduction of food deficit in - Noncereal production increased by over - Substantial reduction of food deficit\nmany households 50 percent in many households\n4\n- Hired labor increased by 20,000 - Hired labor increased by 25,000 person- - Hired labor increased by 2,500 0\n   person-days for landless and marginal days, for landless and marginal farmers person-days for landless and\nfarmers Reduced vulnerability to floods marginal farmers\n- Reduced vulnerability to floods\nFishery Benefits - Fish production increased by 135 tons -  Culture fishery was introduced to - No fish production pre-project\nthrough tidal water retention valued at produce 9 tons or Tk0.7 million, - WMA is initiating fish culture with the\nTk11 million      engaging genuine fisherfolk engagement of the landless\n420 farmers, 40 genuine fishers, and\n100 landless are engaged\nSocial and - The subproject helped local people to -  WMA initiated microcredit to the poor - WMA initiated microcredit to the poor\nParticipatory Issues to unite and regain control over land that using shares and savings; they are using shares and savings A\np\nReduce Poverty had been taken up by outsiders for engaged for rice husking, - Poor people participate in WMA p\ne\nsaline water shrimp cultivation     poultry rearing, transport , and    decisions as members n\nd\n- With majority of members who are     fishery   - 14 poor WMCA members received ix\npoor, WMA is providing fish culture -  Poor people participate in WMA an average Tk1,000 microcredit loan  3\n,\n   benefits to the poor     decisions as members  p\na\n-  39 poor Water Management g\ne\n    Cooperative Association members got\n \n2\non average Tk2,500 microcredit loan\nFCD = flood control and drainage, ha = hectare, km = kilometer, WMCA = Water Management Cooperative Association, WMA = water management\nassociation.", "Table A.3.2: Summary of Lessons Learned in SSWRDSP and Measures Taken for the Proposed SSWRDSP\nKey Issues Lessons Learned/Recommendations Measures Taken in the Proposed SSWRDSP\nA.

Introduction\n1. This appendix describes the summary initial environmental examination (SIEE) prepared\nfrom the initial environmental examination (IEE) reports with respect to three representative core\nsample  areas  selected  for  feasibility  study  for  the  Second  Small-Scale  Water  Resources\nDevelopment Sector Project.\n2. On the basis of site-specific existing problems and probable solutions, the sites were\nclassified by type of activity as follows:\n(i)  Choto Kumira khal\u2014water conservation,\n(ii)  Purba Sayedpur\u2014drainage improvement and water conservation, and\n(iii)  Sriramkandi\u2014flood management and drainage improvement.\nB.  Description of the Project\n3. The proposed Project falls under Category B of the environmental classification of the Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB). The project area encompasses the entire country of Bangladesh from\nthe northern hills through the southern coast of the Bay of Bengal. The main objective of the\nProject  is  to  achieve  sustainable  agricultural  development  through  institutionalization  of\nstakeholders for integrated management of water resources. Enhancement of accessibility for\nemployment for the landless poor and women is another target of the Project. The Project is\nexpected to benefit approximately 200,000 hectares (ha) of land cultivated by over 180,000 farm\nhouseholds.\n4. The Project will include approximately 300 subprojects of different categories with a unit\narea of 1,000 ha or less. The subproject types will be water conservation, drainage improvement,\nflood management, and command area development. The major physical interventions for these\ntypes  of  subprojects  will  be  reexcavation/excavation  of  canals,  rehabilitation/construction  of\nembankments, and construction of water-regulating structures. The time frame for the proposed\nProject will be 2002-2009.\nC. Description of the Environment\n5. The Environmental Profile of Bangladesh1 states that the country\u2019s environment is seriously\nthreatened by deforestation (3.3 percent of the forest is lost per year), declining soil productivity\nand land degradation, biodiversity loss, poor water management, and water quality degradation\nand water pollution. The report also mentions nine points mainly responsible for environmental\ndegradation in Bangladesh, of which, the following three are of prime concern to the Project.\n(i)  high population pressure and low environmental awareness at all levels;\n(ii)  improper cropping sequences, unbalanced use of fertilizer, and pesticide misuse in\nagriculture; and\n(iii)  poorly designed flood control, drainage, and irrigation works without environmental\nimpact assessment.\n6. To make matters worse, Bangladesh is now facing a serious problem due to pollution of\ngroundwater with arsenic. This problem has spread all over the country and a number of people\nhave been diagnosed with arsenic poisoning. A report published by the Water Resources Planning\n                  \n1  Asian Development Bank. 1998. Environmental Profile of Bangladesh. Policy Coordination Unit, Office of the Director,\nPrograms Department (West), Manila.", "53\nAppendix 9, page 2\nOrganization,2 states that the problem is acute in tube wells, which abstract groundwater from\ndepths of more than 10 meters and less than 100 meters in the southeast, south-central, and\nsouthwest regions. Also affected, although to a lesser extent, is the eastern part of the northeast\nregion, and the very southern fringe of the north central and northwest regions along the Ganges\nRiver.  More  than  20  million  people  are  estimated  to  drink  water  exceeding  the  Bangladesh\nstandard for arsenic of 0.05 milligram/liter (mg/l) and this standard is more liberal than that of the\nWorld Health Organization guidelines that establish the tolerable level of arsenic in potable water\nat 0.01 mg/l. Thousands of cases of arsenic poisoning have been recorded with some deaths also\nbeing reported.\nD. Choto Kumira Khal Water Conservation Subproject\n7. The subproject has a gross area of 1,290 ha of which the net cultivable area is 987 ha.\nHomesteads, water bodies, roads, forest, etc. cover about 303 ha. The subproject area is located\non the tidal floodplain at the foot of the Chandranath Hills. The area is gently sloping with land\nelevations  ranging  from  4.5  meters  (m)  along  the  highway  down  to  3.2  m  near  the  coastal\nembankment. The village platforms with their associated gardens are above 4.5  m.\n8. The area is very prone to flash flooding from storms in the hills, and water congests in low\nareas  along  the  embankment.  However,  the  area  has  no  significant  wetlands.  The  khal3  is\nregarded as perennial, but with little base flow in the rabi4 season. It has a strong tidal flow, with\nthe larger tides penetrating to the highway and water within this reach of the channel is saline\nbetween November and April. About 75 percent of the area is used for agriculture. Because of the\nland type, soil characteristics, and water available for irrigation, the area is dominated by rice\ncropping. Double cropping is practiced on most of the land. A large portion of this double-cropped\nland consists of local variety broadcast aus5 followed by local variety and high-yielding variety\ntransplant aman.6 The present cropping intensity is 186 percent.\n9. The area has little wildlife. Wildlife comprises mainly coastal bird species, reptiles, and\namphibians endemic to the area. The aquatic habitat is limited to Choto Kumira khal. The mudflats\noutside the embankment have been planted to mangroves. The area is one segment of a long\nidentical coastal plain and has no special ecological features.\n10. The population density is 600 per square kilometer, which is much less than the national\naverage of 850. The area is accessible by village roads from a number of points on the highway to\nSayedpur Ghat and the embankment. Sayedpur has one bridge, the remainder are footbridges.\nThe khal can no longer be used for navigation. One growth center is located on the highway. The\nsubproject area has no items of cultural or heritage significance in the area.\nE. Purba Sayedpur Drainage, Irrigation, and Water Conservation Subproject\n11. The gross area of the subproject is 892 ha of which the net cultivated area is about 565 ha.\nThe homesteads, homestead gardens, water bodies, roads, forest, etc. cover about 327 ha of the\ntotal area of the subproject. The subproject area includes mostly highland (F0 i.e., 0-30 cm flood\ndepth) and medium low (F1 i.e., 30-90 cm flood depth) type of land, which covers 565 ha of\nagricultural land. The terrain is flat and surrounded by dendretic channels of the Lower Meghna\n                  \n2  Water Resources Planning Organization. 1999.

Kochua khal and beel7 are located in the central part to the area. Both water bodies are\naffected by tidal flow and also by flooding from upstream. Large numbers of coconut, date palm,\nand betel nut trees are found around the homesteads and native forest remains on the higher\nground in the south. Trees and homestead platforms surround the central beel and cover about 30\npercent of the gross area forming refuges and corridors for wildlife. The agricultural landscape and\nbeel are treeless. The area has no special ecological features distinct from the surrounding district.\n12. The environment has been considerably modified by human activity:\n(i)  the area is now protected from tidal surge by the Rahmatkhali khal regulator,\n(ii)  the open water fishery has been depleted by overexploitation and obstruction to\nspawning migration,\n(iii)  Kochua khal is largely an artificial borrowpit excavated to construct a road,\n(iv)  the khal is pumped out annually to irrigate the boro8 crop,\n(v)  the beel wetland has been drained by a network of canals, and\n(vi)  native forest has been cleared for rice fields from 60 percent of the area.\n13. This notwithstanding, the landscape is very attractive, and does not appear to be suffering\nfrom any environmental problems. Because of the land type, soils, and availability of irrigation\nwater, rice crops dominate the subproject area. Double cropping, which covers about 378 ha of net\ncultivated area, is practiced on most of the land and single cropping occurs on about 26 ha of land.\nA large portion of this double-cropped area consists of high-yielding variety boro followed by\ntransplanted  aman  (both  local  and  high-yielding  varieties).  Present  cropping  intensity  is  139\npercent.\n14. Within the community, 64 percent of the households depend directly on farming. About 12\npercent of these households are landless people and depend on farm employment. The remaining 36\npercent of the households have other occupations as their major source of income. However, at least\n15 percent of these including entrepreneurs, fisherfolk, unemployed, and some women are indirectly\ndependent on farming. Unemployment is a problem, particularly among the younger people and\nwomen. About 25 percent of the labor force is working in towns or out of the country. Among the\nfarmers, the average landholding is 0.66 ha. However, large- and medium-size landholders own 45\npercent of the land.  For half of this group, farming is not their primary occupation. Twenty-two percent\nof the land is owned by the nonfarming sector. Marginal farmers and landless, who comprise 45\npercent of the area population own 15 percent of the land.\nF. Sriramkandi Flood Management Drainage and Irrigation Subproject\n15. The gross area of the subproject is 333 ha, including 38 ha of noncultivated highland occupied\nby homesteads, 275 ha of net area, and 20 ha of noncultivated permanent water bodies. The land\nelevations range from 5 m to 7 m with highland located mostly in the northern half of the area near the\nriver. The mean annual rainfall is 1,878 mm and the mean monsoon flood level is 6.75 m. This causes\ninundation of extensive areas on both sides of the river. The riverine environment surrounding the\nsubproject  has  been  extensively  influenced  by  flood  control,  irrigation,  and  river  improvement\ninterventions. The subproject area includes mostly medium low (F2) land, which includes 245 ha of\nagricultural land. The major crops grown in the area are transplanted aman, boro, pulses, sugar cane,\noil seeds, and jute. The present cropping intensity is 170 percent. The project area has been\nextensively cleared for agriculture, which covers 80 percent of the landscape. Life in the area is still\ndominated by flooding.  Floods exceeding 6.75 m can occur at any time between July and October.\nFlooding of the lower land is much more frequent and can occur between June and October.

There are\ncontinuous stands of riparian vegetation along both streams, and remnant patches throughout the\nnorthern embankments. The village platforms with their associated gardens are located against the\nriver in this northern half providing a forested perimeter. The southern polder is largely treeless\nagricultural land, with an extensive swamp in the southern corner. The area is one part of an extensive\nfloodplain and has no special ecological features. The aquatic habitat is extensive but badly damaged.\nIt has the full range of habitats with the two rivers, the internal khal, the seasonal beels, the floodplain,\nand an estimated 20 ha of village ponds. Few fish exist in the rivers, and as a result all of the river\nfisherfolk have moved on.\n16. The population of the subproject area is estimated at about 2,800 with a population density of\n850 persons per square kilometer. About 470 families live in five villages. The Noapara\u2013Modhukali\nroad, and the Bhatiapara railway are located on either side of the project area, the later forming a\nflood refuge.  A metal road from Noapara comes within 1 kilometer of the area. It enters the area as a\ngravel road via a concrete bridge over the Chandana River and runs on the embankment across the\ncenter of the area to Bhimpur Bazar. Bhimpur Bazar has a growth center but no industries. The\nsubproject area has no apparent items of cultural or heritage significance.\nG.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n1. Choto Kumira Khal Water Conservation Subproject\n17. The proposed construction of a 2.7 meter diameter rubber dam across the Choto Kumira\nkhal will serve a net area of up to 957 ha for rice and vegetables cultivation with dry season\nirrigation. The estimated storage volume is 163 000 m3. The expected benefits are an increase in\nannual  production  by  20  percent  (Tk7,018,000).  Saline  intrusion  in  the  dry  season  will  be\nprevented upstream of the dam. Downstream, the brackish section of the khal will not be affected\nas no brackish nursery zone or mangrove plants exist within the boundary. Choto Kumira khal will\nbecome a more permanent pool in the dry season. This occurs now with the construction of mud\nbunds, so is not expected to significantly affect the water quality and other components of the\naquatic  environment.  Reduction  of  the  salinity  level  may  improve  the  present  water  quality\ncondition. Baseline water quality data will be established as part of the design process for the\nsubproject and water quality will be monitored on a regular basis. Construction of the dam will raise\nthe water level in the pools of the khal by a minimum additional depth of 0.3 m. This will create a\ncongenial environment for fish. Some seasonal siltation may exist at the khal head, but this will be\nminimal as the dam is only inflated in times of low flow during the dry season.\n18. The operation of the rubber dam proposed for Choto Kumira khal will be operated to take\nadvantage  of  the  annual  cycle  of  movement  and  breeding  of  fish  and  prawns.  Agricultural\nproduction is expected to increase significantly by 1,150 tons, including 685 tons of rice and 460\ntons of vegetables. This amounts to 90 kilograms (kg) of vegetables per person living in the area.\nThe improved food supply will potentially be reflected in better nutritional status, health, and\ngeneral well-being of the community. Employment in farming is expected to increase by 21 percent\nmainly as the result of increased vegetable production specially beans. On the other hand, use of\nchemical fertilizer and pesticide will increase. This will impose a negative impact on agricultural soil\nquality and water quality in the khal as well. Application of integrated pest management techniques\ncould mitigate these adverse impacts in the agricultural fields. Soil analysis and soil fertility level\ndetermination in the crop fields could better manage the soil resources without further degradation.\n19. The fish population of the khal has been significantly reduced by existing embankments and\nregulators, the current use of mud bunds and extreme fishing pressure, particularly around the\nstructures and in drainage ditches. Inflation of the rubber dam during the lean period is unlikely to", "56\nAppendix 9, page 5\naffect fish breeding. Provision has been made for a bypass to provide environmental flows if\nrequired.\n2. Purba Sayedpur Drainage Improvement and Water Conservation Subproject\n20. The proposed construction of a 9 m wide x 2.6 m high automatic gate on Kochua khal at\nPurba Sayedpur will retain an estimated 700,000 cubic m of water for irrigation and improve flood\nsecurity. It will facilitate cultivation of irrigated boro, wheat, winter crops, and fish culture. During\npremonsoon rainfall, Kochua beel will be unaffected, as the gate will open automatically if up-\nstream levels exceed 2.8 m and the tide level is lower. This level is lower than the land level of\nKochua beel. Drainage from the beel will also be unaffected. So, mostly there will be no impact.\nTidal flooding on the other hand will be reduced, as the smaller tides up to 3.8 m will be excluded.\nThis level is exceeded in 17 percent (1 in 5) of years and the highest level reached is 4.4 m. The\ngate chosen has been designed specifically to meet environmental concerns, including ensuring\nfish passage in the Zandvlei estuary in South Africa and is considered the most suitable available.\nThe operation of the gate could be refined in the final design if required. Gate operation will be set\nto  take  advantage  of  the  annual  cycle  of  movement  and  breeding  of  fish  and  prawns.  The\noperation is detailed in the IEE of the subproject. The automatic gate has been considered more\nlikely to allow fish access than the possible alternative structures, such a regulator. The timing and\nfrequency of openings is likely to be more suited to fish movement and the larger opening and\nlower velocity flow should allow fish to pass. The Project will not result in a reduction of agricultural\nland, but it may allow cultivation to extend further into the beel. This will depend on water level\nbehavior once the more frequent tidal flooding is removed.\n21. Farm outputs are expected to increase by 27 percent (Tk9,313,000) and employment in\nfarming should increase by 66,930 person-days worth Tk37,50,000. Use of chemical fertilizer and\npesticides will increase. Consequently, the soil of agricultural lands may be degraded. Application\nof integrated pest management techniques can mitigate this impact. Soil analysis and soil fertility\nlevel determination in the crop fields can protect the lands from degradation effects. It is not likely\nto have any adverse impact on open water fisheries. Rather, introduction of rice-fish culture is\nexpected to increase floodplain fish production.\n3. Sriramkandi Flood Management and Drainage Improvement Subproject\n22. The proposed resectioning and completion of the embankments with sluice will exclude all\nbut the most severe floods and allow drainage when river levels permit. This will have a positive\nimpact on agriculture by protecting the boro crop and aus crops from premonsoon floods and allow\na good start to the aman crop. In line with agricultural crop production, use of chemical fertilizer\nand pesticide will also increase. Application of integrated pest management in crop fields, and\nagricultural land management through soil analysis and soil fertility level determination, will mitigate\nthe possible impacts of soil quality degradation and water quality deterioration.\n23. The floodplain in the subproject area may be affected significantly. The northern wetland\nwill be maintained by internal run-off unless the drainage is improved, however it will become\nseasonal and be smaller in size. The khal is still likely to have some permanent water. The\nsouthern wetland is expected to drain completely once the entrance khal is built and the area is\nused for increased agricultural production.\n24. The riverine fishery is already badly damaged and may not suffer a measurable loss from\nso small a project. However, the loss of the floodplain fishery is likely to impact both on the species\navailable in the area and the fish biomass. Those who catch fish and those who depend on the\nopen water fishery to supplement their diet will share this fishery impact. The floodplain fish loss\ncan be compensated by introducing aquaculture practice in the area. An increase in the yield per", "57\nAppendix 9, page 6\nha of the 20 ha pond area from existing 1,200 kg to 2,050 kg is quite possible following the modern\nproduction technology.\n25. The floodplain fish loss can be reduced to a minimum by allowing entry of fish/prawn seeds,\njuveniles, and young through the regulator gate. This will require opening of the gate intermittently\nat the onset of flood and during monsoon. The frequency and duration of gate opening at the peak\nperiod of breeding (mid July) will be increased.\nH.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program\n26. Subproject beneficiaries are the caretakers of their local resources and they will be the\nultimate manager of water control structures. Thus, they must understand the sustainable use of\nnatural resources, be able to manage them properly, and operate the structures in a planned and\nresponsible way. So, an extensive general awareness training program needs to be conducted\ninitially to make them understand the human role in changing the environment, measures for\nprotection  and  conservation  of  the  environment,  environmental  legislation,  best  use  of  water\nresources with maintenance of water quality standards, etc. In the second stage, a training of\ntrainers course needs to be held with the most competent attendees of the general awareness\ntraining  program.  The  prepared  trainers  are  expected  to  organize  and  continue  the  future\nawareness training program in their own locality. This concept is working well in the ongoing\nsubprojects  of  the  ongoing  Small-Scale  Water  Resources  Development  Sector  Project\n(SSWRDSP).\n27. To mitigate adverse impacts arising from increased pesticide use, a total of 62 integrated\npest management field farmers schools (FFS) have been established in 59 subprojects of the\nSSWRDSP; 1,240 farmers have received training. These farmers subsequently worked with 3,879\nother  farmers  to  encourage  them  to  adopt  the  technology.  To  protect  against  any  kind  of\nenvironmental degradation as well as to encourage economical fertilizer use, a soil health card has\nbeen introduced among 300 farmers who are now fixing fertilizer doses themselves according to\nsoil requirements in their croplands.  In the fisheries sector, a new concept for simultaneous use of\ninundated floodplains to cultivate two crops: rice and fish together has been introduced. This has\nresulted in partial compensation for floodplain natural fish loss, economic benefit to the farmers,\nand maintenance of communal harmony between agricultural crop producers and fish farmers. All\nthese activities need to give due attention during planning phase for environmentally sustainable\ninstitutional capacity building of the beneficiaries of the proposed Project.\n28. The Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) has two environmentalists in the\nproject  management  office,  one  environmental  specialist  and  one  environmental  laboratory\nspecialist with the advisory technical assistance. Three laboratory facilitators and 11 laboratory\nassistants are located in the LGED district laboratories. LGED has established three regional\nenvironmental laboratories with additional facilities and sophisticated instrumental set up at Barisal,\nKhulna,  and  Rangpur,  and  11  greater  district  laboratories  in  the  western  half  of  Bangladesh\nequipped with water test kits usable in the field. These laboratories are in operation for the\nSSWRDSP\u2019s  water  quality  monitoring  activities  in  selected  subprojects.  The  same  kind  of\nlaboratory is to be set up in the eastern part of the country for the same monitoring purposes. Most\nimportantly, LGED does not have enough qualified technical personnel to handle and operate\nthese  instruments  to  conduct  analytical  works  in  such  laboratories.  To  develop  the  in-house\ntechnical capability of LGED\u2019s laboratory staff, training on environmental laboratory and water\nquality testing is ongoing, and a similar program needs to be designed for the proposed Project\nwith recruitment of additional technical human resources.", "58\nAppendix 9, page 7\nI.  Findings and Recommendations\n29. The water conservation and drainage improvement type of subprojects are likely to have no\ndirect  negative  environmental  consequences.  These  subprojects  are  expected  to  benefit  the\nagriculture sector by extending dry season irrigation facility in highland areas and quick drainage of\ntidal water in coastal areas. The water conservation subprojects are also expected to have positive\nimpact  on  fisheries  production  in  the  khals.  An  indirect  negative  impact  is  likely  in  water\nconservation and drainage improvement types of subprojects as the result of increased use of\nagro-chemicals.  To  mitigate  this  impact  integrated  pest  management  training  with  the\nestablishment of field farmers schools will be necessary. Moreover, farmers will be required to\nassist  and  support  agricultural  land  and  soil  management.  The  flood  management  type  of\nsubprojects may have little adverse environmental impact for floodplain fisheries production. But\nthis can be partially mitigated by proper design and structure operation, for example, construction\nof  submersible  embankments,  and  timely  operation  of  sluice  gates.  The  fisherfolk  in  flood\nmanagement subprojects will be partially affected by the impact on floodplain fish. This impact can\nbe  compensated  by  imparting  training  to  the  fishers  on  rice-fish  culture  on  floodplains.  Fish\ncultivators can also benefit from the same training. If properly adopted then the floodplain fish\nproduction  loss  can  easily  be  overcome  through  rice-fish  culture  as  well  as  alternative  fish\nproduction in ponds.\n30. The experiences from the ongoing SSWRDSP show that all the subprojects including those\nof  the  command  area  development  type  have  positive  impact  on  quality  of  life  values.  The\nproposed Project can therefore be recommended with appropriate mitigation measures, monitoring\nrequirements, compensatory plan, and other components of the environmental management plan\nas summarized here:\n(i)  integrated pest management training for the farmers and establishment of field\nfarmers integrated pest management schools to mitigate the adverse impact of\nchemical fertilizer and pesticides use;\n(ii)  establishment  of  an  environmental  laboratory  to  strengthen  LGED\u2019s  institutional\ncapability;\n(iii)  water  quality  impact  monitoring  to  verify  any  long-term  impact  on  fresh  water\necology;\n(iv)  soil analysis and soil fertility level examination to assist farmers in determining\nfertilizer mixes and applications, and to verify any long-term effect on soil quality\ndegradation;\n(v)  biodiversity impact monitoring to verify any long-term impact on aquatic habitat and\nwetland species diversity;\n(vi)  environmental education and training for raising awareness among the stakeholders\non sustainable use of local resources; and\n(vii)  fish  production  training  to  compensate  for  the  partial  loss  of  floodplain  fish\nproduction and to introduce modern aquaculture technology in khals and ponds.\nJ.  Conclusions\n31. The SSWRDSP II is environmentally feasible and can be implemented provided that all the\nenvironmental issues discussed here are taken into account and the respective measures are put\nin place within the scheduled time frame and with proper allocation of fund as in the environmental\nmanagement plan. A full-scale environmental impact assessment is not required at this stage.", "59\nAppendix 10, page 1\nSOCIAL DIMENSIONS AND POVERTY ASSESSMENT\nA.  Poverty and Social Characteristics\n1. Bangladesh has made notable progress in income-poverty reduction since the 1970s. At\nthe national, poverty has declined from 70.6 percent to 46.5 percent, and the percentage of rural\npeople living below the poverty line declined from 71 percent in 1973/74 to 51 percent in\n1995/96.1 The human poverty index (HPI), which captures human deprivations in longevity,\nknowledge,  and  economic  provisioning,  also  shows  that  incidence  of  human  poverty  has\ndeclined from 61.3 percent in 1981-1983 to 47.2 percent in 1993-1994 and to 40.1 percent in\n1995-1997.2 However, inequality in income distribution has worsened since the early 1990s,\nrising from 35 percent in 1983/84 to 38.4 percent in 1995/96.\n2. Poverty in rural Bangladesh is multifaceted. It is reflected in low standards of living, poor\nhealth, lack of education, abandonment of women and children, and vulnerability of most rural\nhouseholds to natural and manmade disasters. The basic causes of poverty are lack of access\nto productive resources (mainly water and land), to public resources such as health provisions,\neducation, and transport and to particular employment. Lack of social and governmental safety-\nnet entitlements makes the land-poor and landless particular vulnerable. The large and medium-\nsize landholders have access to credit and other necessary agricultural input. Their access to\ncash  has  allowed  many  of  them  to  diversify  into  nonfarm  activities  and  act  as  local\nmoneylenders, often a very lucrative business. This, combined with their status as landlords and\npolitical connections, has secured them a comfortable position in rural society. However, even\nwithin the social group of medium-size landholders, about 25 percent live below the poverty line\n(footnote 1).\n3. Rural poverty is very much related to land. The incidence of poverty in the category of\nlandless (less than 0.2 hectares (ha) of land) is as high as 64 percent compared with only 16\npercent recorded for large landowners (owning more than 2 ha).3 The incidence of poverty is\nconsiderable among marginal farmers as well; 44 percent of this group lives below the poverty\nline, and among small landholders, 34 percent live below the poverty line.\n4. Rural households are often involved in a bundle of income-generating and cash-saving\nactivities. A household may be farming some of its land, leasing in a plot from someone else\nwhile at the same time leasing out one or more of its own plots. One or more members of the\nhousehold may work off and on as a day laborer. Others may move off to towns and cities to\nseek employment. Homestead land is often used to produce vegetables, fruits, poultry, and\nlivestock. Traditionally fisheries are a major part of rural livelihood strategies. The many rivers,\nkhals, boars, haors, ponds, etc., are ideal for fish production. Fisheries for subsistence use are\nwidespread among all categories of rural households. However, fish stock has been limited\nsignificantly over the last decades. The scope for aquaculture seems considerable, although\npartly restricted by multiple ownership of water bodies.4\n5. The four subproject areas, Abatpur, Choto Kumira, Purba Sayedpur, and Sriramkandi,\nare dominated by a rural economy, on average 80 percent of the households in the areas are\n                  \n1 Sen, Binayak, 2000.

A significant feature in the subprojects is the high number\nof small and marginal farmers, and unequal distribution of land. In Abatpur and Purba Sayedpur,\nlarge and medium-size landholders (44 percent and 33 percent of all farmers) own 44 percent\nand 63 percent of the total arable land in the two subproject areas. Marginal and landless\nfarmers (44 percent), on the other hand, own only 15 percent in Purba Sayedpur and 17 percent\nin Abatpur. Figures on cultivated land per household indicate that marginal and landless farmers\ngain access to and cultivate on average 20 percent of the total arable land in subproject areas.\nEven  though  sharecropping  is  mainly  found  among  landless,  small  and  medium-size\nlandholders may also work as sharecroppers. The most common system of share cropping is\nthat  the  sharecroppers  and  the  landowners  share  the  benefits  gained  from  agricultural\nproduction (50/50). Exact figures on the prevalence of sharecroppers in the project areas is not\navailable; however, the majority of sharecroppers are likely among the landless and marginal\nfarmers. In addition, to sharecropping, landless farmers supplement their income through fishery\nand vegetable growing. In Choto Kumira, the landless owned on average 0.08 ha of pond and\nhomestead land.\n6. The  occupational  distribution  within  the  agriculture  sector  also  reflects  the  unequal\ndistribution of land. On average, 40 percent of household heads farm their own land, 30 percent\nare sharecroppers, and 10 percent depend on farm labor. The remaining 20 percent depend on\njobs such as rickshaw-pulling, daily labor, fishing, trade, and business. Women are employed in\ndomestic duties, harvest works, and cottage industries. Poor women collect fuel and work as\nwage laborers. Destitute women reported earth work and domestic labor as the main sources of\nincome.\n7. The majority of the male population in the four subproject areas are engaged in full-time\nemployment (between 65-76 percent), and 25 percent of the male population are inadequately\nemployed.5 Studies indicate that the groups most affected by unemployment are youths, day\nand agricultural laborers, small holders, sharecroppers, and destitute women. Destitute women\nreported having 4 months of unemployment during the monsoon period.\n8. According to the detailed poverty study in the four subproject areas, the annual income\nper  household  is  Tk27,900  for  landless  and  Tk24,600  for  marginal  farmers.  Medium-size\nlandholders have an annual income on Tk77,500. The average income of destitute women is\napproximately  Tk15,000,  and  household  expenses  are  managed  within  this  income.  On\naverage, 75 percent of spending is on food. The per capita income adopted for moderate\npoverty is Tk6,000 and for extreme poverty Tk5,000.6 Based on a household population of six,\nthe group of landless and marginal farmers falls below the extreme poverty line.\n                  \n5 They are employed less than 10 hours a day.\n6 Local Government Engineering Department. 1999.

The main problems in the four subproject areas, as identified by the landless and\nmarginal  farmers  are  shortage  of  land  and  income  opportunities.  The  community  groups\nexpectations of the benefits and impacts of the Project are (i) increased income opportunities,8\n(ii) development of road and water communication, (iii) increase in the value of mortgaged\nagricultural land by between 15-25 percent per hectare, (iv) increase fish production, and (v)\nmore  opportunities  for  disadvantaged  groups  to  become  involved  in  farming.  All  women\ninterviewed expected to benefit from the Project mainly through employment opportunities,\nbetter  pay,  and  general  improved  socioeconomic  conditions  through  postharvest  work  and\nearthwork in particular.\nB.  Social Dimensions\n1. Vulnerable Groups - Fisherfolk\n10. Where  neither  design,  nor  planning,  nor  implementation  can  reduce  fishery  losses,\nmitigation measures can often do so. Most often these measures will focus on culture (instead\nof capture) fisheries. Ensuring not only an increase in production, but also accesses to new\nopportunities for those who have lost out capture fisheries is essential. To compensate fisherfolk\nfor their losses (if any) and ensure that they are not worse off due to the Project, fisheries\ndevelopment plans will be developed in a participatory manner in accordance with Guidelines\non  Participatory  Water  Management  and  ADB\u2019S  fisheries  development  plans  prior  to  the\nconclusion of implementation agreements. The funding of fisheries development plans will be\nunderpinned with Government counterpart funds and charges, fees, and dues collected for\nservices and facilities by WMA.\n2. Indigenous People\n11. In Bangladesh, 20 ethnic minority groups are recognized, they are mostly found in plans\nor  hills  of  Chittagong  Hill  tracts.  As  the  Project  does  not  include  Chittagong  Hill  tracts,\n                  \n7  See financial and economic analysis, Appendix 12 of the RRP.\n8 In regard to the increased possibilities for income-generating activities, construction/earth work was mentioned,\nrickshaw-pulling, increased fish production, and more possibilities for sharecropping.", "62\nAppendix 10, page 4\nindigenous peoples issues are not anticipated to be significant in the Project. However, where\nindigenous peoples may be affected by subprojects, ADB\u2019S Policy on Indigenous People will be\napplied.\n3. Resettlement and Land Acquisition\n12. Resettlement and land acquisition effects are not anticipated to be significant for the\nProject.  However,  reflecting  the  importance  ADB  places  on  careful  and  effective\nimplementation, a land acquisition and compensation plan will be prepared based on ADB\nguidelines. A summary resettlement plan is in Appendix 11.\n4. Participatory Development\n13. The Project is driven by the needs and demands of the communities that recognize\nwater management as important to realize the productive potential of their land and captured\nfisheries. Subproject selection is based on participatory consultations at the village level in\nconjunction with the district level administration and nongovernment organizations (NGOs).\nThese stakeholders will also be involved in project preparation, implementation, and monitoring\nand evaluation. Women will have an equal opportunity to participate in project activities, and\nthey will be adequately represented in training and other project activities.\n5. Gender Issues\n14. The issues of gender in the water sector do not simply involve access to water. They\ninvolve questions of rights, responsibilities, and participation at all levels. When women do not\nget the opportunity to participate in water management, they are simultaneously delinked from\nthe urgent effort to protect these vital natural resources.\n15. The Project will provide training (confidence building and management skills) for women\nto enable them to participate in the water management association 1/3 of the members should\nbe women, and will also give specific attention to employment of female staff at all levels. The\nProject will give priority to local poor women in (i) formation of the local contracting society, (ii)\nemployment opportunities generated by the Project (tree planting, embankment work, etc.), and\n(iii) in operation and maintenance work of the Project. Additionally, all relevant training activities\nincluded in the Project will address gender concerns, and at least 30 percent of participants in\ntraining activities should be women. This includes training of Local Government Engineering\nDepartment  staff  and  water  management  association  members.  All  facilitators,  community\norganizers, socioeconomists, assistant engineers, and upazila engineers will be trained on the\nimportance of women\u2019s involvement in the Project. Special training will be provided for women-\nonly on various aspects, such as homestead, vegetable gardening, duck rearing on on-farm\nincome-generating activities, and seed and vegetable production.\n16. Gender-specific monitoring indicators will be identified and gender-relevant information\nwill be documented. An international and national gender expert will be posted in the project\nmanagement office. The gender experts will among other things develop and implement a\ngender strategy for the Project.\nC. Expected Social and Poverty Impact of the Project\n17. While the Project will not address core poverty interventions, positive and significant\nimpacts  on  poverty  reduction  in  project  areas  are  expected.  Direct  benefits  are  expected", "63\nAppendix 10, page 5\nthrough increased household income in subproject areas both by the incremental net value of\nagricultural production, as well as by the returns to the labor that is involved in that incremental\nproduction. The increase in water supply at critical times of the year for irrigation projects is\nexpected to allow for increased high yield variety rice production as well as additional crops.\nTemporary  employment  opportunities  will  be  generated  through  construction  work  during\nsubproject implementation. Table A10.2 gives a summary of the expected poverty impact of the\nProject.\n18. Overall when combining crop production and labor income, the poor may attain 49\npercent, 45 percent, 63 percent, and 58 percent of the full local financial benefits of the Project\nin Abatpur, Choto Kumira, Purba Sayedpur, and Sriramkandi, respectively.9 On an annual basis\nthe average incremental increase in household income among the poor is expected to be\nTk3,900.00, Tk3,900.00, Tk3,160.00, and Tk3,000.00.\n19. In addition, to the benefits mentioned, indirect or secondary employment opportunities\nare expected to increase due to rise in agricultural production. The rise in local household\nincome and food production will result in an improved status of nutrition and welfare for the\nsubproject population. Water conservation by Projects is likely to have multiple uses in addition\nto irrigation, namely for livestock and domestic purposes. The subprojects in Abatpur and\nSriramkandi also provide opportunities for increased income from fisheries, through construction\nof ponds.\n20. Agricultural production benefits are likely to accrue almost entirely to the owners of the\nland. While the poor (defined as small and marginal farmers, in addition to the actual and\nfunctionally landless)10 own only on average less than half of the total arable land in the\nbenefited areas, they can also be expected to benefit from increased labor income resulting\nfrom  the  subproject  crop  production.  In  addition,  labor  for  earthworks  involved  in  project\nconstruction is likely to be drawn from local poor households.\n21. The efficiency of the Project in delivering benefits to the poor can be calculated by taking\nthe ratio of the present value of benefits going to the poor to the present value of public\ninvestment in the four subprojects. By this measure it can be noted that the poor can be\nexpected to receive Tk1.4 in project benefits for every taka of public investment.\n                  \n9  See the financial and economic analyses of the Project for more detailed information.\n10 The poor own 32 percent of the net benefited area in Choto Kumira subproject, 54 percent in Purba Sayedpur\nsubproject, 32.5 percent in Abatpur, and 43 percent in Sriramkandi.", "64\nAppendix 10, page 6\nTable A10.2: Summary Poverty Impact in the Four Subprojects\nItem Abatpur Choto Kumira Purba Sayedpur Sriramkandi\nBenefit.

One  of  the  components  of  the  Small-Scale  Water  Resources  Development  Sector\nProject is to construct water management infrastructure. Three subprojects were identified and\nassessed in terms of resettlement and land acquisition issues. The assessment indicates that\nnone are expected to have a significant impact in terms of resettlement and land acquisition.\n2. The draft summary resettlement plan provides an estimate based on design data for\nthree subprojects in Sonotala flood control drainage (FCD); Sriramkandi flood control drainage;\nand Madhukhali flood control drainage.\n3. The  resettlement  plan  will  be  updated  prior  to  commencing  works.  Receipt  of  the\nupdated final resettlement plan acceptable to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be a\ncondition for commencing construction. This will be reflected in the loan covenants to ensure\ncompliance.\nB. Resettlement Policy\n4. Resettlement  will  be  implemented  according  to  the  following  legislation  of  the\nGovernment of Bangladesh and in accordance with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement\n(November 1995). The basis under the Constitution and laws of the People\u2019s Republic of\nBangladesh are The Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Ordinance of 1982.\nC. Minimization of Resettlement Impact\n5. The Project will adopt a policy of minimizing adverse resettlement impacts and reducing\nthe  number  of  affected  persons  by  continuously  reviewing  the  design  to  minimize  land\nacquisition and resettlement requirements.\nD. Resettlement Impact\n6. The  three  core  subprojects  assessed  have  only  insignificant  impacts  in  terms  of\nresettlement. In the Sonatala flood control drainage subproject, embankment, canal, regulator,\nand sluice gates have been constructed on 4.72 hectares (ha) of private land and 1.36 ha of\ngovernment (khas) land. To construct infrastructure, 0.0300 ha have been taken from each of\nthe 157 plots (private). Loss to individual owners compared with the benefits is insignificant. The\npeople affected do not need to be resettled or relocated. For the Sriramkandi subproject, a flood\nprotection  embankment  with  two  regulators  will  be  constructed  on  4.00  ha  of  Water\nDevelopment Board (WDB) land and 0.41 ha of private land. Concurrence of the WDB for use of\ntheir land will meet the legal requirements. The private cultivated land will be compensated at an\nagreed rate. Ten households now residing on WDB land as squatters will have to be relocated.\nFor the Ramkrisnapur drainage subproject, no land acquisition or resettlement will be acquired.\nE. Resettlement Principles and Entitlements\n7. Those affected will be assisted to maintain their original standard of living, at least equal\nto what they enjoyed prior to the Project. All possible means will be explored to minimize\nresettlement and land acquisition impacts by modifying the engineering designs. This will be\ncarried out in close consultation with those affected. Plans for acquisition of land and to address", "66\nAppendix 11, page 2\nthose affected  will be implemented in consultation with the people affected to ensure minimal\ndisturbance. Financial and physical resources for compensation will be made available as and\nwhen required.\n8. People  affected  may  resettle  themselves  or  be  resettled  in  close  proximity  to  their\nrespective villages. Legal owners and tenants of land will be compensated and assisted with\nrehabilitation.\n9. No works under any contract awarded under the Project will commence until all required\nfunds  are  made  available  to  the  concerned  land  acquisition  collector  and  compensation\npayments and/or other assistance have been made available to those affected.\n10. When the design of subprojects is finalized, an entitlement matrix will be prepared for\neach subproject in accordance with ADB\u2019s resettlement policy. An independent review of the\nresettlement operation will be commissioned by ADB after completion of the Project to assess\nwhether those affected have regained or improved their livelihoods and standards of living.\nF. Consultations and Grievance Procedures\n11. Social  preparation  is  an  essential  part  of  the  planning  and  implementation  of  the\nresettlement process. The Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) and upazila\nofficers will enlist the assistance of local nongovernment organizations to inform the affected\npersons of the project impacts, and their entitlements and rehabilitation options under the\nresettlement plan. The resettlement plan will be designed and implemented in consultation with\nthe  water  management  association  and  those  affected.  Grievance  redress  of  the  people\naffected may be provided through the local conflict resolution committee, constituted with the\nlocal upazila officer, upazila engineer, LGED, the assistant commissioner (land), local union\nparishad  chairperson,  a  female  member  of  the  union  parishad,  WMA  chairperson,  and  a\nrepresentative of those affected.\nG. Implementation Arrangement\n12. The subprojects under the Project have insignificant resettlement effects and the scope\nfor resettlement will not be large. Therefore establishment of a resettlement unit to take care of\nresettlement issues independently will not be necessary. The project management office may\nextend support through a resettlement and land management consultant.\nH. Cost\n13. Average resettlement cost per subproject has been estimated at Tk250,000.00. The\nestimated  resettlement  cost  of  all  subprojects  will  be  firmed  up  when  the  design  of  the\nsubprojects has been finalized. The full costs of resettlement and compensation will be the\nresponsibility of the Government.", "67\nAppendix 12, page 1\nFINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS\nA. Introduction\n1. The Second Small-Scale Water Resource Development Sector Project will have a direct\nimpact on the rural economy by enhancing agricultural production. Drainage infrastructure can\nbring more land into production and/or allow land to be productive throughout more of the year.\nFlood  management  projects  reduce  losses  from  flooding  and  allow  the  use  of  high-yielding\nvarieties on more land. Water conservation schemes allow supplementary irrigation in addition to\nincreasing retained soil moisture after the rainy season. Command area development directly\nincreases irrigation, leading to a shift to the higher productivity of irrigated agriculture.\n2. This  is  a  sector  development  project  and  the  actual  number  of  subprojects  and  their\ncoverage  areas  are  therefore  not  definitively  mandated  in  advance.  However,  about  300\nsubprojects (covering roughly 195,000 hectares [ha]) are expected to be constructed. Using the\nexperience of the first Small-Scale Water Resources Development Sector Project (SSWRDSP), an\nexpected mix of subproject types (between flood management, drainage, etc.) for the proposed\nProject can be assumed as the Project expands to include the eastern sections of the country.\nFour prospective subprojects have been intensively examined and their expected financial and\neconomic  returns,  discussed  here,  can  be  seen  as  indicative  for  the  remaining  potential\nsubprojects.  An overall project return can then be determined as costs not specific to subproject\ndevelopment are incorporated into the analysis.\n3. To determine the expected direct benefits of the subprojects in question, quantifiable effects\nare valued by comparison of with- and without-project scenarios. In addition to quantifiable benefits\nand  costs  included  in  this  analysis,  however,  the  Project  can  be  expected  to  have  various\nnonquantifiable effects. Flood management and drainage schemes can provide protection for\nhouseholds,  for  example,  and  embankments  can  serve  as  easier  access  to  some  parts  of\nsubproject areas not well served by regular roads. The rise in local household income and food\nproduction will result in an improved status of nutrition and welfare for the subprojects\u2019 populations.\nFish habitat, on the other hand, may change. The quantity of local fish production can be mitigated\nthrough the construction of fish ponds as part of the Project, but access to fisheries by traditional\nusers may be negatively affected in some circumstances and will need to be adjusted through\ninstitutional means.\nB. Approach and Methodology\n4. Prices used in the analysis were identified through a variety of secondary sources in\naddition to field trips to the proposed subproject areas. Basic assumptions used in the economic\npart of the analysis include the following:\n(i)  A world price numerair is used.\n(ii)  Values are expressed in constant year 2000 prices to exclude inflation.\n(iii)  The Bangladesh taka (Tk) is the unit of account; the rate of exchange used here is\nthe prevailing rate at the time of appraisal: Tk 54 per US dollar.\n(iv)  For  nontraded  goods  and  services,  a  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.9  and  a\nshadow wage rate of 0.85 are used.1\n                  \n1  The derivation of economic values in the water sector in Bangladesh is laid out in the Government of the People\u2019s\nRepublic of Bangladesh. August 2000. Draft Development Strategy, Volume No. 8, Annex J: Economics, National\nWater Management Plan Project, Water Resources Planning Organization, Ministry of Water Resources. Dhaka.", "68\nAppendix 12, page 2\n(v)  For major tradable commodities, economic values are based on border parity pricing\n(footnote 1).  Standard methods of deriving farmgate output/input prices are applied.\n(vi)  Transfer payments such as taxes and subsidies are excluded in the calculation of\neconomic values.\n5. The four sample subprojects analyzed are\n(i)  Sriramkandi (Faridpur) flood management,\n(ii)  Abatpur (Sunamgonj) (flood management partially submersible embankment),\n(iii)  Purba Sayedpur (in Lakshmipur District) water conservation scheme, and\n(iv)  Choto Kumira (Chittagong) water conservation scheme.\n6. For each of these subprojects cropping patterns and technologies both with and without the\nProject have been estimated based on the expected changes in land use due to flood protection\nand/or increased availability of water for crops. Per hectare costs of production and returns for\nrelevant crops have also been calculated for both situations and translated into economic values.\nFor the subprojects\u2019 net benefited area, the incremental value of production was calculated. To be\nconservative about field data, for the calculation of economic returns agricultural benefits have\nbeen adjusted to 90 percent of their nominal values.\n7. Some subprojects (for example Sriramkandi) may be expected to have an effect upon\ncapture fisheries. These subprojects typically involve the building of embankments and control\nstructures and have the possible side effect of preventing the normal production of fish in low-lying\nareas. While flood protection may actually increase production in privately owned fish ponds, for\nthe more open areas harboring fish when flooded, flood management structures may damage\nproduction. When such conditions are expected, appropriate adjustments to benefits are made\nand/or provision is made for fishponds to be included in subproject implementation plans so as to\nmitigate the expected fishery effects.\n8. Given the available information on the planned structures and earthworks to be built, the\ncost of each subproject has been determined.  These costs have also been converted to economic\nvalues. Operation and maintenance (O&M) costs (to be borne by benefiting farmers) have also\nbeen estimated at 3 percent of construction costs for earthworks and 1.5 percent of the cost of\nstructures\u2014with some exceptions where higher rates are used. For example, 6 percent O&M is\nassumed for the partially submersible embankments in Abatpur. In addition, an allowance in the\ncalculation is made for a major repair of the infrastructure in year 15 of project life\u2014generally\nassumed to be equivalent to 40 percent of the original construction cost.\n9. Both benefits and costs are expressed as cash flow streams over an expected 20 years of\nsubproject life. From these cash flows, net present values and the economic rates of return are\ncalculated. Finally, sensitivity analyses are performed on the results by assuming various scenarios\nrelating to particular risk factors such as shortened project life due to poor O&M, delays in project\nimplementation, increased construction costs, decreased benefits, and a drop in the price of rice.2\n10. Expected subproject impacts on poverty are also examined. Agricultural production benefits\nare generally assumed to accrue to landowners. Household income is expected to increase from\n                  \n2  World Bank commodity price projections of April 2000 predict a general rise in rice prices over the next decade and a\ndecline of prices for two of the three fertilizer prices of relevance (with some rise in the third). While these predictions\nmay indicate little price risk, the possibility of future price changes that may negatively impact the project is dealt with\nthrough the sensitivity analysis regarding the price of rice. To be somewhat more conservative than the World Bank\nprice projections, the base analysis is built on the assumption of constant relative prices.", "69\nAppendix 12, page 3\nincremental labor utilization with the subprojects. Improved water resource regimes allow farmers\nto more fully adopt high-yielding variety technology, and labor inputs can be expected to rise to\nsome extent. Assuming the degree of unemployment and underemployment that is typical of rural\nBangladesh, in local financial terms this increase in labor income (either through wages or as\nreturns to labor on a household\u2019s own land) can add substantially to household income, particularly\nthat of the poor. On a national level, however, the economic opportunity cost of labor must be\ntaken into account and the incremental wage effect on poverty is a good deal less than it is in local\nfinancial terms.\nC. Economic and Financial Appraisal\n11. To consider the results of the economic and financial analysis, one of the four sample\nsubprojects is examined in some detail in this text and in tables A12.1 and A12.2.  Full comparable\ndetails in tabular form, however, can be found for all four subprojects in tables A12.3 and A12.4.\n1.  Sriramkandi\n12. Sriramkandi  subproject  in  Faridpur  district  is  designed  to  provide  flood  management\nbenefits for farms covering 275 ha.  When the area is better protected from floods with the Project,\nfarmers\u2019 choices of cropping pattern, intensity, and technology are expected to adapt positively to\nthe new opportunities. In financial terms, once farmers have fully adapted to their new water\nregime, the value of net incremental crop production is expected to be about Tk1.3 million a year,\nor Tk4,660 per hectare (Table A12.1). Of this, Tk1.1 million will be from incremental rice production\n(261 tons) and Tk0.2 million from other crops. Cropping intensity is expected to rise from its\npresent 170 percent to 184 percent with the Project. Rice output/ha is expected to rise by about 14\npercent, due to higher inputs on the existing mix of rice varieties and a shift to more high-yielding\nvarieties.\n13. This subproject, however, is expected to have a fisheries effect. Without the Project, in\nroughly 5 years out of 10, approximately 250 ha of floodplain can be expected to be flooded with\nsufficient water to provide a temporary habitat for fish. This fish production (expanded to an\naverage  annual  basis)  is  valued  at  over  Tk300,000  and  will  be  lost  once  the  subproject  is\nimplemented. To mitigate for this effect, 7 ha of fishponds are proposed to be constructed within\nthe subproject area. These ponds are expected to provide a catch worth over Tk400,000 per year\n\u2014enough to compensate for lost fish production and for the pond cost.\n14. The construction cost of the subproject is estimated at Tk4.2 million, which will lead to an\nexpected Tk71,300 in annual O&M expenditures. In addition, the proposed fishponds will cost\nTk300,000 and incur annual O&M costs for stocking, pumping, and embankment maintenance\ntotaling Tk32,750. Total regular O&M is, then, Tk105,050, or about Tk380 per ha.  A comparison of\nfinancial benefits per ha with this expected O&M figure would indicate that project beneficiaries\nshould have no problem meeting their O&M responsibilities. Assuming funds are put aside for the\nprojected year 15 major repair, this cost can be covered by an additional Tk365/year/ha.\n15. In Table A12.2 the economic valuations of the subproject\u2019s costs and benefits can be\nseen.3  The life of the Project is expected to be 20 years and the agricultural benefits are phased in\nover the first four years following construction. The economic net present value (NPV), assuming a\n12 percent opportunity cost of capital, is Tk2.6 million. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR)\nis 21 percent and the benefit-cost ratio is 2.4/1.\n                  \n3  These figures assume the 90 percent adjustment noted earlier.", "70\nAppendix 12, page 4\n16. Various sensitivity analysis scenarios focus on a number of risks that may face the Project.\nWhat will happen to returns if the rice price drop (despite World Bank projections for an increase)\nor general benefits are less than estimated? Similarly, if the cost of construction increases or the\nconstruction period is prolonged (delaying project benefits), what would happen to the EIRR? Or, if\nO&M is not adequately performed and project life is subsequently shortened to less than 20 years,\nhow much will returns be affected?\n(i)  If the price of rice (the primary crop in this subproject) were to drop by 20 percent,\nthe EIRR would decrease to a still-acceptable 16 percent. The sensitivity indicator\nfor this drop is 3.2, meaning that a drop in rice price causes a proportionately 3.2\ntimes larger drop in returns (as measured in NPV).\n(ii)  If general benefits were to drop by 20 percent, the EIRR would decrease to 14\npercent. The sensitivity indicator is 3.9 and the switching value (the percentage\ndecrease in general benefits beyond which the EIRR drops below the 12 percent\ncutoff) is 25 percent.\n(iii)  If construction costs (and associated O&M costs) were to be 20 percent higher than\nestimated, the EIRR would drop to 17 percent. Here the sensitivity indicator is 1.7\nand the switching value is 160 percent of estimated construction costs.\n(iv)  If the project life were to be shortened by 5 years (to 15), the EIRR would be\nminimally affected\u2014decreasing only to 20 percent. The NPV would decrease by a\nquarter. The switching value, indicating the minimum number of years of project life\nthat would maintain at least a 12 percent EIRR is 7 years.\n(v)  If construction is prolonged for an additional 2 years, in effect delaying the start of\nproject benefits, the EIRR would drop to 16 percent, and be associated with a 46\npercent decrease in NPV.\n17. Overall, these sensitivity tests indicate that the economic viability of this subproject can\nwithstand the levels of change in the risk factors that have been tested. Sensitivity indicators and\nswitching values would imply that substantial deterioration in the levels of the risk factors could\njeopardize subproject performance, with the exception of the risk of shortening subproject life for\nwhich there appears to be a good deal of leeway. Generally, however, these results can be seen\nas  moderately  robust,  and  indicate  a  level  of  returns  that  are  at  a  sufficiently  high  level  to\naccommodate  a  reasonable  share  of  the  overall  Project\u2019s  additional  costs  of  management,\nsubproject selection, monitoring, etc.\n18. Household income in the subproject area is likely to increase both by the incremental net\nvalue of agricultural production as well as by the returns to the labor that is involved in that\nincremental production. Assuming the degree of unemployment and underemployment that is\ntypical of rural Bangladesh, in financial terms the households of the area are likely to benefit from\nan increase in wage income (or its equivalent in on-farm returns to family labor) of more than\nTk700,000 per year. On a per ha basis (to make it comparable to the incremental value of crop\nproduction), this incremental labor income is expected to be about Tk2,560/ha.\n19. The poor own 43 percent of the 275 ha of net benefited area within the subproject. They\nare expected to get, then, 43 percent of the incremental production income from the Project. In\naddition, they can also be expected to benefit from the with-project increased labor income from\ntheir own land, and to be hired on a wage basis to cover a part (50 percent is assumed here) of the\nincreased labor needs of medium and large landholders. The poor may, then, claim something\nover 70 percent of the incremental wage income resulting from the subproject. In addition, labor for\nearthworks involved in project construction is likely to be drawn from local poor households.\nOverall, when combining crop production and labor income, the poor may attain 58 percent of the", "71\nAppendix 12, page 5\nfull local financial benefits of the project. On an annual basis this group is likely to gain Tk1.0\nmillion per year. Two hundred and fifty-four subproject households are classified as small and\nmarginal farmers, or laborers and landless. While distribution within this group is likely to be\nuneven, the average incremental increase in household income among the poor is expected to be\nTk3,945 per year. (In economic terms, in which the national opportunity cost of labor is included,\nthe poor are expected to receive 47 percent of total project benefits, which is Tk615,000 or an\naverage of Tk2,420 per poor household.)\n2.  Summary of Four Sample Subprojects\n20. Tables A12.3 and A12.4 present a number of financial and economic statistics for all four\nsubprojects including Sriramkandi. The EIRRs range from 21 percent for Sriramkandi to 36 percent\nfor Choto Kumira. NPVs range from Tk2.7 million in Sriramkandi up to Tk13.5 million in Choto\nKumira. As for poverty impacts, in local financial terms benefited poor households may expect a\nrise in annual income of Tk3,020 to Tk3,940, depending on their subproject. In economic terms,\nthis annual income rise for poor households is calculated to range from Tk1,660 to Tk2,600.\n3.  Full Project\n21. The four sample subprojects can be seen as reasonably representative of their types (flood\nmanagement and water conservation scheme), and their types comprise 83 percent of the 300\nexpected subprojects that will be constructed by the Project. For various reasons, two other\npossible types of subproject (drainage and command area development) were not included among\nthe sampled subprojects. Nevertheless, an approximation of full project returns can be devised if\nthe results of the sample subprojects are extrapolated on a per ha basis to the entire project area\n(estimated to be about 195,000 ha) and the nonconstruction project costs (in economic valuation\nterms) are included in the calculation. The Project as a whole can be expected to have an EIRR of\n19 percent when costs of the subproject development component (including social mobilization,\nselection,  project  management,  monitoring,  and  postconstruction  agricultural  and  fisheries\nprograms) are included.  If the costs of the institutional strengthening component are also included,\nthe EIRR is 17 percent.\n22. Aside from economic returns, a number of additional full project figures can be calculated\nby extrapolation from the four sample subprojects: (i) rice production will increase by 180,000 tons,\nproducing incremental net crop income from rice of Tk820 million/year;  (ii) overall net crop income\nwill rise by Tk975 million (or 35 percent) in project areas; (iii) increased local labor demand will be\n7.8 million days a year (or about Tk420 million); (iv) about 280,000 households (1.7 million people)\nwill benefit, at an average of Tk4,900/year/household; (v) beneficiaries will handle Tk47 million in\nregular O&M costs, saving the Government (which would otherwise be responsible) $870,000\nequivalent (per year or $17.4 million equivalent) over the 20 year life of the Project.", "Table A12.1: Net Agricultural Income With and Without the Sriramkandi Subproject, Faridpur \n(cid:19)(cid:26)(cid:22)(cid:4)(cid:14)\n(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:3)(cid:8)(cid:4)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:5)(cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:13)(cid:3) (cid:27)(cid:2)(cid:28)(cid:14)(cid:28)(cid:13)(cid:2)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:29)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:6)(cid:9)(cid:30) (cid:31)(cid:13)(cid:5)(cid:28)(cid:5) (cid:2)(cid:13)(cid:29)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:6)(cid:9)(cid:30)\n(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4) (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4) (cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:11)(cid:12) (cid:13)(cid:11)(cid:14)(cid:4) (cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:2)(cid:6)(cid:2)(cid:16)(cid:3)(cid:6)(cid:7) (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4) (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4) (cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:11)(cid:12) (cid:13)(cid:11)(cid:14)(cid:4) (cid:17)(cid:16)(cid:11)(cid:2)(cid:11)(cid:18)(cid:3)(cid:16)\n(cid:19)(cid:3)(cid:9)(cid:7)(cid:20) (cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:11)(cid:12) (cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:11)(cid:20)(cid:8)(cid:16)(cid:4)(cid:3)(cid:11)(cid:2) (cid:23)(cid:22)(cid:11)(cid:14)(cid:14) (cid:11)(cid:12) (cid:24)(cid:9)(cid:4) (cid:25)(cid:2)(cid:16)(cid:22)(cid:9)(cid:18)(cid:9)(cid:2)(cid:4) (cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:11)(cid:12) (cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:11)(cid:20)(cid:8)(cid:16)(cid:4)(cid:3)(cid:11)(cid:2) (cid:23)(cid:22)(cid:11)(cid:14)(cid:14) (cid:11)(cid:12) (cid:24)(cid:9)(cid:4) (cid:25)(cid:2)(cid:16)(cid:22)(cid:9)(cid:18)(cid:9)(cid:2)(cid:4)\n(cid:26)(cid:22)(cid:9)(cid:6) (cid:27)(cid:6)(cid:4)(cid:9) (cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:11)(cid:20)(cid:8)(cid:16)(cid:4)(cid:3)(cid:11)(cid:2) (cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:11)(cid:20)(cid:8)(cid:16)(cid:4) (cid:13)(cid:11)(cid:14)(cid:4) (cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:11)(cid:20)(cid:8)(cid:16)(cid:4)(cid:14) (cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:11)(cid:20)(cid:8)(cid:16)(cid:4)(cid:3)(cid:11)(cid:2) (cid:25)(cid:2)(cid:16)(cid:11)(cid:18)(cid:9) (cid:28)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:14) (cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:11)(cid:20)(cid:8)(cid:16)(cid:4) (cid:13)(cid:11)(cid:14)(cid:4) (cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:11)(cid:20)(cid:8)(cid:16)(cid:4)(cid:14) (cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:11)(cid:20)(cid:8)(cid:16)(cid:4)(cid:3)(cid:11)(cid:2) (cid:25)(cid:2)(cid:16)(cid:11)(cid:18)(cid:9) (cid:28)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:14)\n(cid:13)(cid:22)(cid:11)(cid:31)(cid:14)  (cid:29)(cid:6)!
