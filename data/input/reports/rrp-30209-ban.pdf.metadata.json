Key\nconstraints  for  rural  poverty  reduction  include  (i)  lack  of  physical\ninfrastructure;  (ii)  lack  of  support  services  including  extension,\nmarketing,  and \nlack  of  high-quality\nagricultural  inputs;  (iv)  suboptimal  utilization  of  water  resources;\nand  (v)  lack  of  access  to  basic  social  services.  Water  is  the\nfoundation for many rural livelihood activities of the rural poor, and\nto\neffective  water \naddressing  pervasive  rural  poverty  problems  while  promoting\neconomic growth in Bangladesh. This critical water resource has\nto be managed in a strategic, integrated, and participatory manner\nthat includes the mobilization, organization, and empowerment of\nstakeholders.  Based  on  the  Government\u2019s  main  instrument  to\nhave  the  strategy  implemented,  the  SSWRDSP  was  launched  in\n1996  to  enhance  rural  incomes  by  developing  community-based\nwater  management  associations \n(WMAs)  and  community-\nmanaged,  small-scale  infrastructure;  this  has  proved  to  be  an\neffective  means  to  reduce  rural  poverty.

THE PROPOSAL\n\nII.      INTRODUCTION\n\n2.\nThe  Government  of  Bangladesh  sought  assistance  from  ADB  in  1999  to  finance\npreparation  of  a  project  aimed  at  improving  water  management  to  magnify  the  impacts  of  the\nongoing  Small-Scale  Water  Resources  Sector  Project  (SSWRDSP).2  Project  preparation  was\ncarried out under ADB-financed technical assistance (TA).3 Following completion of the TA, fact-\nfinding was carried out in 2000 and ADB appraised the Project from 12-25 March 2001.4  This\nreport  is  based  on  the  feasibility  study  and  the  Appraisal  Mission\u2019s  discussions  with\nrepresentatives  of  Government  agencies,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs), \ntarget\nbeneficiaries and their communities, and bilateral and multilateral aid agencies in Bangladesh.\nThe project design is summarized in the project framework in Appendix 1.\n\nIII.      BACKGROUND\n\nA. \n\nSector Description\n\n1. \n\nRural Poverty in Bangladesh\n\n3.\nBangladesh remains one of the poorest countries in the world with a per capita income\nof approximately $360 in 1999. With a population of over 130 million living in a total area of 148\nthousand square kilometers (or 880 persons per square kilometer), it is one of the most densely\npopulated  countries  in  the  world.  Among  this  population,  over  80  percent  live  in  rural  areas\nmainly  engaged  in  agriculture  and  related  nonfarm  activities.  Endowed  with  limited  land  and\nother  natural  resources,  and  with  a  high  population  density,  poverty  is  a  pervasive  problem  in\nrural Bangladesh. The recent countrywide income poverty data shows that the head count index\nof  poverty  in  1995/96  was  51  percent  in  rural  areas  compared  with  the  urban  index  of  26\npercent,  and  the  national  average  of  46  percent.5  In  monetary  terms,  the  annual  per  capita\n\n                  \n1  Schemes with a command area of less than 1,000 hectares.\n2    Loan  1381-BAN: Small-Scale Water Resources Development Sector Project,  for  $32.0  million,  approved  on  26\nSeptember  1995  and  cofinanced  by  International  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development,  for  $10.4  million,  on  7\nDecember 1995, is being implemented in the western divisions of Bangladesh and will be completed in 2002. This\nproject  is  being  supported  by  TA  2564-BAN:  Beneficiary Participation and Project Management,  approved  on  2\nMay 1996 and funded by the Government of Netherlands for $6.8 million.\n\n3 TA 3358-BAN: Second Small-Scale Water Resources Development Sector Project, for $400,000, approved on 22\nDecember 1999. Loan 1381-BAN(SF): Small-Scale Water Resources Development Sector Project, for $32 million,\napproved on 26 September 1995. A participatory process has been adopted in preparing the Project. Two national\nworkshops  were  conducted  by  inviting  concerned  stakeholders.  Several  local  workshops  were  also  conducted  to\nconsult with beneficiaries of the ongoing project.\n\n4\n\n   The Mission comprised Toshio Kondo, Senior Project Economist/Mission Leader; K. Yokoyama, Project Engineer;\nS. Wendt, Social Development Specialist; and A. Goswami, Counsel. P. de Vries and M. Verwijk, First Secretaries,\nRoyal Netherlands Embassy in Dhaka, and two experts, J. Luijendijk and B. Woersem participated in the Mission.\nO. Shresta, K. H. Ryu, and K. Talukdar from the Bangladesh Resident Mission assisted the Mission.\n\n5  Sen,  Binayak.  2000.  Bangladesh Poverty Analysis: Trends, Policies and Institutions.  Prepared  with  financial\n\nsupport from ADB.\n\n\f2\n\nincome  at  the  level  of  moderate  and  extreme  poverty  was  estimated  at  Tk6,100  (about  $120\nequivalent) and Tk5,100 ($100) respectively for 1999.6\n\n4.\nPoverty  in  rural  Bangladesh  is  multifaceted,  reflected  in  low  standards  of  living,  poor\nhealth  and  nutrition,  and  lack  of  education  and  health  services,  abandonment  in  particular  of\nwomen  and  children,  and  vulnerability  to  natural  disasters  such  as  floods  and  cyclones.  The\nbasic causes of poverty are lack of access to productive resources (mainly land and water) and\nbasic  infrastructure  (such  as  road  and  electricity),  to  public  services  such  as  education  and\nhealth  services,  and  to  employment  opportunities.  Lack  of  social  and  government  safety-net\nentitlements makes poor people particularly vulnerable. These phenomena are largely attributed\nto insufficient economic growth in rural areas. Given that nearly 90 percent of poor people live in\nrural  areas,  enhancing  poverty  reduction  in  rural  areas  through  rural  and  agricultural\ndevelopment is the key challenge facing the country. Subprojects under the ongoing SSWRDSP\nhave  already  generated  substantial  benefits  to  rural  people.  These  subprojects  have  also\nprovided substantial incremental opportunities to the landless.\n\n2. \n\nWater Resources\n\n5.\nFor  the  country\u2019s  rural  residents,  access  to  productive  resources  is  of  fundamental\nimportance to their livelihood. For the poor, water resources are particularly important. Water is\nthe  foundation  for  many  traditional  livelihood  activities,  including  the  country\u2019s  main  rural\nactivities\u2014agriculture  and  inland  and  coastal  fishing,  transportation,  water  supply,  and  rural\nindustries.  However,  located  at  the  confluence  of  three  major  river  systems  of  the  South  Asia\nregion\u2014the  Brahmaputra,  Ganges,  and  Meghna\u2014managing  water  resources  poses  an\nextraordinary challenge for the country. These river systems bring about massive floods in the\nmonsoon  season7  and  severe  water  scarcity  in  the  dry  season,  along  with  serious  riverbank\nerosion  threatening  the  livelihood  of  vulnerable  people  living  along  the  rivers,  and  siltation  of\nwatercourses  causing  widespread  drainage  congestion.  Periodic  natural  disasters  such  as\ncyclones and tidal surges exacerbate hardships by decimating life and property in coastal areas.\n\n6.\nIn addition to these severe physical challenges, the demands of water management that\nhave evolved in Bangladesh are complex and diverse. Agriculture, particularly rice cultivation, is\nthe most dominant activity in rural life, and often calls for the protection of agricultural land from\nseasonal  floods  to  ensure  sufficient  income  and  food  security  to  rural  people.  However,  many\nrural families, particularly the poor, also need water for capture fisheries, livestock breeding, jute\nprocessing,  and  other  economic  activities  for  subsistence  purposes  in  the  monsoon  season.\nMost waterways of the country also serve as an important transport network. Rural households\nneed access to adequate and safe domestic water, which is increasingly under competition with\ngroundwater  exploitation  for  irrigation  purposes  in  the  dry  season,  and  is  also  in  many  cases\nthreatened by arsenic contamination. Finally, water is a vital resource for the maintenance of the\ncountry\u2019s  natural  ecosystems  and  biodiversity,  particularly  wetlands,  which  are  deemed  to  be\namong  the  richest  in  the  world.  Given  these  diverse  interests  in  water  resource  use  against  a\nbackdrop of poverty the paramount need of the country is to manage this critical resource in a\nstrategic, integrated, and participatory manner.\n\n6  Japan Overseas Consultants Co. Ltd. et al.

While the sector\u2019s share has declined to 32 percent of gross domestic product and\n13 percent of exports in recent years, it employs about 60 percent of the country's labor force of\n56 million. Food crops represent about 72 percent of the value added by agriculture, followed by\nfisheries  (11  percent),  livestock  (10  percent),  and  forestry  (7  percent).  Fisheries  and  livestock\nactivities are of particular importance to the rural poor who have limited access to land. As many\nas  70  percent  of  rural  households  are  partly  or  fully  involved  in  subsistence  fishing,  whereas\nlivestock activities employ about 20 percent of the rural labor force. Fisheries also have strong\nimplications  for  the  nutritional  status  of  the  poor,  accounting  for  over  60  percent  of  the  animal\nprotein intake.\n\nThe  food  grain  production  in  fiscal  year  1999/20008  has  exceeded  the  food  self-\n8.\nsufficiency target. The resulting reduction in food grain prices has particularly benefited the poor\nnot  only  in  urban  but  also  in  rural  areas,  given  that  70  percent  of  rural  households  are  net\npurchasers  of  rice.  This  robust  growth  is  largely  attributed  to  increased  groundwater  irrigation\nand adequate supply of key agricultural inputs such as fertilizer, fuel, and high-yielding varieties\nof  seeds  at  stable  prices,  and  increased  availability  of  agricultural  credit.  The  Government\u2019s\nproactive  policies  have  also  contributed  to  this  process,  including  the  removal  of  import\nrestriction on irrigation pumps, and liberalization of trade in agricultural inputs.\n\n9.\nNotwithstanding  this  achievement,  continued  significant  growth  of  food  crop  production\nis  critically  needed  to  tackle  rural  poverty  problems.  Efforts  to  increase  food  grain  production\nneed to be continued  to keep pace with the growth of Bangladesh\u2019s population and to ensure\nfood security for the poor.9 Providing effective and sustainable water management infrastructure\nis an important part of these challenges.\n\nInland  fishery  production,  which  comprises  capture  and  culture  fisheries,  has  also\n10.\nstrongly performed in the late 1990s, achieving an annual growth rate of over 8 percent. Given\nthe  importance  of  fisheries  resources  to  the  rural  poor  as  a  source  of  income  as  well  as\nnutrition, enhancement of this trend is essential.\n\n11.\nThe importance of providing enabling physical infrastructure for poverty reduction is well\ndocumented. Studies have concluded that water resource infrastructure such as embankments,\nroads, and water control structures have impacts in terms of (i) improving income opportunities\nfor  food  crop  production;  (ii)  developing  culture  fisheries  in  areas  protected  by  embankments,\n(iii)  ensuring  access  for  the  poor  to  public  water  bodies;  and  (iv)  inducing  relevant\nnonagricultural activities that have forward linkages that are engaged by the poor.\n\n4.\n\nWater Sector Institutions\n\n12.\nThe  country\u2019s  sector  institutions  including  the  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and\nBangladesh Water Development Board have been relatively weak in addressing complex water\nmanagement issues. Past planning efforts have tended to focus on construction of infrastructure\nfor  the  protection  of  agriculture  and  urban  land  that  often  overlooked  this  multidimensional\naspect of the country\u2019s water resources. Operation and maintenance (O&M) of the infrastructure\n\n                  \n\n   Food grain production for 1999/2000 was 24.9 million tons. Food supply  has barely exceeded demand in  recent\n\n9 The annual rate of population growth decreased between 1991 and 1998 from about 2.2 percent to an estimated\n\n8\n\nyears.\n\n1.7 percent.\n\n\f4\n\nhas  remained  underresourced  and  inadequate,  with  little  beneficiary  participation  and  support\nfor  local  resource  mobilization.  The  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  address  these  challenges  and\ninstitutional constraints were initiated in the 1990s, and are included in the National Water Policy\n(NWP) of 1999.\n\nto \n\n  During  the  implementation  of  the  SSWRDSP,  the  Local  Government  Engineering\n13.\nDepartment  (LGED)10  demonstrated  adequate  ability \nidentify  and  operate  effective\nprocedures and arrangements in undertaking community-based, participatory, water resources\nmanagement  schemes.  With  the  majority  of  their  staff  placed  at  district  and  subdistrict  (or\nupazila)  levels  with  substantial  decentralization  in  decision  making,  LGED  is  well  placed  to\nassist  local  government  institutions  (LGIs)  to  develop  water  management  systems  and  local\nstakeholder institutions to manage those systems. At the central level, LGED has also managed\nthe  process  of  defining  the  national  Guidelines  for  Participatory  Water  Management11\nincorporating  procedures  established  under  the  SSWRDSP.  While  LGED\u2019s  capabilities  have\nfully  met  the  standards  required  for  the  sector  lending  modality  adopted  for  the  SSWRDSP,\nfurther  strengthening  in  terms  of  the  skills  sets  required  for  decentralized  small-scale  water\nresources development is required.\n\n14.\nThe  development  of  water  management  associations  (WMAs)  is  critical  to  the\ninstitutional  development  of  community  participation  in  small-scale  water  resources  schemes\nand  the  sustainability  of  such  schemes  based  on  decentralized  participation.  However,  legal\nframework  improvements  for  WMA  institutional  development  and  operationalization  under  a\nreformed or alternative legal framework remains a continuing challenge for the sector.\n\n5.\n\nKey Sector Issues\n\na.\n\nImplementation of the National Water Policy\n\nframework \n\nThe  policy \n\nfor  addressing  complex  water \n\nin  a\n15.\ncomprehensive  and  sustainable  manner  has  been  weak  in  Bangladesh.  The  adoption  of  the\nNWP by Bangladesh in 1999 has provided clear policy goals and principles for integrated and\nparticipatory water management, decentralization, improved governance, and sustainable O&M\ncombined  with  transfer  of  management.12  However,  the  NWP  identifies  that  the  setting  of  an\nappropriate  legislative  framework  is  fundamental  to  effective  implementation  of  the  policy\u2019s\nprinciples  and  policy  goals.  The  adoption  of  such  a  legislative  framework  in  the  form  of  a\nnational water code is still outstanding.\n\nresources \n\nissues \n\nb.\n\nFramework for Integrated and Participatory Development of Water\n\n                        Resources\n\nGiven the complexity and diversity of interests among stakeholders in water resources in\n16.\nBangladesh, water management interventions must be identified, formulated, and implemented\nwith  cross  sectoral  perspectives  and  stakeholder  consultation.  The  Government  approved  the\nGuidelines  for  Participatory  Water  Management  in  November  2000.  These  guidelines\nemphasize  stringent  stakeholder  consultation  at  the  identification  stage,  agreement  with\n\n                  \n\n10  The Executing Agency for the ongoing SSWRDSP, under the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development\n\nand Cooperatives, has a strong background in rural development.\n\n11   The Guidelines for Participatory Water Management approved in November 2000 recommended that initially the\nbeneficiaries be registered under the Cooperative Societies Ordinance (1984) and Cooperatives Societies Rules\n(1987) as amended. These guidelines will enhance the active participation of stakeholders.\n\n12  The NWP adopted the principle of management transfer of small and medium schemes (up to 5,000 hectares of\n\ncommand area) to water users associations, which will take responsibility for O&M of the schemes.\n\n\f5\n\nstakeholders  prior  to  construction  of  physical  works,  and  sound  institutional  development  and\neffective use of NGOs for stakeholder participation through the WMAs. Properly operationalizing\nthese principles requires a legal framework that provides an adequate platform for the operation\nof cooperatives and enables the injection of effective competition to cooperatives as instruments\nof  WMA  implementation.  The  current  Cooperatives  Ordinance  of  1984  and  Cooperatives\nSocieties  Rules  of  1987,  as  amended,  do  not  sufficiently  serve  this  purpose  and  no  enabling\nlegal provisions are yet available for alternative forms of WMAs.\n\nc.\n\nDecentralization, Institutional Capacity, and Governance\n\n17.\nThe  NWP  stipulates  that  small-scale  water  resources  development  schemes  with  an\narea  of  less  than  1,000  hectares  must  be  placed  under  the  responsibility  of  LGIs,  whereas\nmedium- to large-scale schemes are under the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB).\nUnder  this  delineation,  LGED  assists  LGIs  in  appraising  and  implementing  new  and  existing\nself-help groups, other stakeholders, and NGOs assisting the participatory process. Past water\nmanagement  interventions  in  Bangladesh  were  centrally  oriented  leading  to  single  purpose,\ninfrastructure-orientated  projects  that  overlooked  diverse  social  concerns.  Lengthy  decision\nmaking  and  inflexibility  in  adapting  to  local  needs  exacerbated  poor  performance.  The  NWP\naims  to  provide  increased  local  autonomy  and  foster  participation,  thereby  enhancing\nsustainable cost recovery and O&M. In particular, LGIs are given responsibility for small-scale\nschemes  below  1,000  ha  with  the  support  of  LGED.  However,  if  the  benefits  of  such\ndecentralized  water  management  are  to  be  realized,  LGED\u2019s  capacity  to  support  such\ndevelopment  must  be  adequately  built.  This  must  include  the  ability  to  address  local\ncoordination,  ensure  more  effective  identification  and  formulation  of  interventions  by  LGED\nmanagement  from  an  integrated  perspective,  and  address  social  and  environmental  concerns\nthrough effective monitoring.\n\n18.\nIn  addition  to  LGED  reorganization  to  serve  such  needs,  effective  water  sector\ngovernance  is  required  to  realize  the  potential  benefits  of  decentralization.  This  includes  the\nneed  to  (i)  build  contractual  frameworks  that  ensure  water  service  infrastructure  providers  are\nheld  accountable  to  communities;  such  a  framework  lies  at  the  heart  of  effective  water\nmanagement; (ii) empower communities through WMA-based participation approaches to small-\nscale  water  resource  schemes;  (iii)  develop  appropriate  water  and  usage  rights  under\npredictable  legal  framework;  and  (iv)  improve  accountability  and  performance  monitoring  to\nensure  quality  infrastructure  by  providing  technical,  social,  and  financial  audits  for  WMA-\nmanaged completed schemes.\n\nB.\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n19.\nThe  Government\u2019s  water  resources  sector  investment  plan  is  documented  in  (i)  the\nBangladesh Water and Flood Management Strategy (BWFMS) approved in 1995 and updated\nin 1998 following the Ganges Water Treaty with India, and (ii) the Fifth Five-Year Plan (FFYP)\n1997-2002. The BWFMS provides strategies, programs, and the short-term investment portfolio\nup  to  2000  and  the  medium-term  up  to  2010.  These  are  integrated  into  the  FFYP,  which\npursues  as  its  primary  investment  portfolio  objectives  of  poverty  reduction,  employment\ngeneration, and food self-sufficiency.\n\nDuring  the  preparation  of  the  Flood  Action  Plan  (FAP),13  the  deficiencies  of  past  water\n20.\nsector  operations  were  widely  acknowledged.  Such  interventions  ended  to  be  top-down,  and\n\n                  \n\n13  The  FAP  proposed  subdividing  flood-protected  areas  into  small  components  to  be  managed  locally  in  order  to\n\nsecure an environment for intensive agriculture, aquaculture, and integrated rural development.\n\n\f6\n\nsingle-purpose of a major structural type that tended to cause adverse social and environmental\nimpacts and poor O&M sustainability. As a result, Government and civil society recognized the\nneed to (i) set up sound policies and an enabling institutional framework to develop integrated,\nparticipatory,  and  sustainable  water  resource  management;  and  (ii)  define  a  long-term  sector\npolicy and plan. The BWFMS therefore called for the preparation of the NWP and the National\nWater Management Plan (NWMP) as the most urgent requirements.\n\n21.\nThe  core  water  sector  strategies  in  the  BWFMS  and  FFYP  include  (i)  strengthening\nwater  sector  institutions,  (ii)  undertaking  comprehensive  studies  on  major  investments,  (iii)\nincreasing  efficiency  of  completed  water  resource  schemes  by  rehabilitating  works  and\ntransferring  management  to  local  beneficiary  organizations,  and  (iv)  providing  riverbank\nprotection  and  channel  maintenance.  In  the  investment  portfolio,  small-scale  water  resources\ninterventions have been given high priority in the short- and medium-term because they reflect\nrelatively  lower  costs  and  higher  returns,  quicker  gestation  periods,  more  manageable\nstakeholder  conflicts,  and  smaller  environmental  impacts,  and  hence  greater  opportunities  to\naddress rural poverty problems in a holistic manner. The medium-term target is to provide water\nmanagement facilities identified by local people to a total area of 270,000 ha by 2010.\n\nThe  NWMP14  will  set  forth  strategies  and  programs  up  to  2025  with  an  investment\n22.\nportfolio  of  priority  programs.  These  are  to  be  prepared  both  at  national  and  regional  levels.\nBased  on  intensive  studies  of  the  lessons  learned  in  past  interventions,  the  NWMP  will\nemphasize the provision of an enabling institutional environment called for by the NWP.\n\n23.\nIn the small-scale water resources subsector, the NWMP will build on the experience of\nthe SSWRDSP. The NWMP is to provide for improved strategies with a strong poverty reduction\norientation. The emerging strategies over the next five years will focus on institutionalization of\nprocedures  and  arrangements  for  stakeholder-driven,  community-based,  small-scale  water\nresources development schemes established under the SSWRDSP, and the building of capacity\nof sector institutions to establish effective water management associations and infrastructure.\n\nC.        External Assistance to the Sector\n\n In the 1980s, major external assistance to the water resources sector was provided in a\n24.\nseries  of  large  flood  control,  drainage,  and  irrigation  projects  with  support  from  ADB,  the\ngovernments of Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, and the World Bank. Loans amounting to over\n$300  million  were  provided  by  ADB  for  the  implementation  of  such  projects  during  the  1980s.\nFollowing  the  catastrophic  floods  in  1987  and  1988,  external  assistance  focused  on  the\npreparation of an FAP aimed at managing floods in a more systematic manner.\n\n25.\nAfter the completion of the FAP, major efforts have been directed to preparing the NWP\nand NWMP, and implementing high-priority projects. Most water sector projects initiated in the\n1990s,  particularly  after  the  FAP  studies  and  the  related  pilot  interventions,  explicitly  address\nthe  critical  issue  of  the  sustainability  of  water  management  infrastructure,  and  emphasize\nparticipation and coordination of local stakeholders to achieve this end.\n\n26.\nThe major external funding agencies are now focusing on the implementation of the key\nelements of the NWP through reforms of water sector institutions, and effective preparation of\nthe NWMP. While NWMP preparation is funded by the World Bank, the process is under careful\n\n                  \n\n14  The NWMP is due to be finalized in November 2001. It will define the coordination strategy for the improved water\nsector  performance  with  stakeholder  participation  in  the  planning  process.  ADB  has  been  contributing  to  the\nfinalization of the NWMP which is consistent with ADB\u2019s water policy.\n\n\f7\n\nreview  within  the  framework  of  the  local  consultative  group  of  external  funding  agencies\nparticipated in by the World Bank, ADB, and other financiers. The World Bank is also preparing\nthe  Water  Sector  Improvement  Project,  which  seeks  to  promote  institutional  improvement  of\nBWDB and participatory rehabilitation of small- and medium-scale water resources development\nschemes (between 1,000 and 15,000 ha) constructed by BWDB, with a view to transferring the\nmanagement of smaller schemes (up to 5,000 ha) to WMAs. Appendix 2 summarizes external\nassistance to the sector.\n\nD.        Lessons Learned\n\n27.\nThe  experience  of  ADB,  other  funding  agencies,  and  NGOs  indicate  that  water\nresources development projects in Bangladesh have complex social, technical, institutional, and\nenvironmental dimensions. Projects need to be formulated with close attention to each of these\naspects to achieve the envisaged benefits in a sustainable manner. Key requirements include (i)\nstakeholder  participation  at  all  stages  of  the  project  cycle  including  resource  mobilization  by\nproject  beneficiaries  for  sustainable  O&M;  (ii)  simple  technical  design  reflecting  the  local\nconditions  followed  by  careful  construction  quality  control;  (iii)  strong  capacity  development  of\nbeneficiary organizations and of project management institutions; and (iv) careful environmental\nimpact assessments, monitoring, and management, in particular the impacts on fisheries, which\nis the main source of income  and protein for the poorest segment of the society in general.\n\n28.\nThe ongoing ADB-financed SSWRDSP was initiated in 1996 incorporating these lessons\ninto project design. This project has been implementing about 300 small-scale water resources\ndevelopment schemes to establish water control structures and self-sustaining WMAs, covering\nan  area  of  about  150,000  ha  in  the  western  divisions  of  Bangladesh.  The  review  missions\nfielded between 1999 and 2001 concluded that project performance was satisfactory in terms of\ncompliance  with  covenants,  although  improvement  was  needed  in  terms  of  stakeholder\nparticipation, construction quality, and ensuring sustainable O&M managed by WMAs. A status\nreport of the SSWRDSP that includes preliminary project impacts and lessons learned is given\nin Appendix 3. Key lessons learned can be summarized as follows.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nDiverse  stakeholder  interests  in  rural  society  need  to  be  taken  into  account\nduring an early phase of project preparation and be reflected in the organization\nof  the  stakeholder  participation  and  project  design.  Mechanisms  for  effective\nconflict resolution should also be ensured.\n\nSubprojects need to be implemented with well-defined strategies and perspective\nplans for small-scale water resource interventions at local and regional levels.\n\nThe  number  of  subprojects  should  be  limited  to  ensure  adequate  resources  for\nquality  control  of  subprojects.  Sufficient  time  and  resources  should  be  provided\nfor the feasibility studies and formation of WMAs.\n\nA  firm  institutional  basis  should  be  established  before  initiating  physical  works.\nThe  approach  of  ensuring  sufficient  membership  registration  and  financial\ncontributions from beneficiaries prior to physical works is sound.\n\n(v)  While  the  cooperatives  framework  provides  an  effective  legal  basis  for  WMAs,\nthe  existing  rules  are  administratively  complex  and  need  to  be  improved.  An\nalternative  institutional  framework  specialized  for  WMAs  could  be  developed\nbased on ongoing experience.\n\n\f8\n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\nEnsuring  the  quality  of  infrastructure  is  essential  for  WMAs  to  effectively  take\nover  O&M.  This  should  be  pursued  through  sufficient  field  surveys  and  design,\nbeneficiary consultation, and careful construction quality control.\n\nEnvironmental  management  and  land  acquisition  should  be  undertaken  in  a\ntimely  and  clear  fashion  with  implementation  of  necessary  mitigation  measures\nfor those affected by the project.\n\n(viii)  Monitoring  of  completed  schemes  using  sound,  annual,  technical,  social,  and\nfinancial  audits  of  WMAs  is  of  crucial  importance.  Activities  to  institutionalize\nWMA-managed O&M should be initiated at the early stages of the subprojects.\n\nthe\nThe  capacity  of  project  management \nmultidisciplinary  tasks  of  promoting  small-scale,  stakeholder-driven  sustainable\nwater  resources  management.

ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\nThe  Poverty  Reduction  Partnership  Agreement  signed  between  ADB  and \n\n30.\nthe\nGovernment  in  April  2000,  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  operational  strategy  for  Bangladesh,\nidentified poverty reduction as its overarching objective.15 This will be pursued by promoting four\npriority  areas  including  (i)  faster  private  sector-led  economic  growth,  (ii)  creation  of  better\ndevelopment  opportunities  for  the  poor  in  rural  and  urban  areas,  (iii)  improvement  of  human\ndevelopment,  and  (iv)  environmental  protection.  The  country  operational  strategy  also\nadvocates  sharpening  the  focus  of  ADB  operations  on  policy  and  institutional  development\nthrough  long-term  involvement  in  a  limited  number  of  priority  sectors.  Agriculture  and  rural\nsectors  have  been  accorded  high  priority,  with  operational  focus  on  crop  and  agribusiness\ncredit, rural infrastructure, water resources development, and microfinance.\n\n31.\n In the water resources sector, ADB\u2019s strategy is to support integrated and sustainable\nwater  resources  development  and  management  by  enhancing  stakeholder  participation  and\nempowerment,  improving  financial  efficiency  and  sustainability,  and  improving  the  living\nconditions for the poor rural population, while not disturbing the natural environment. Developing\nthe  necessary  policies  and  institutional  framework  and  capacities  of  central  and  local\ngovernments, and community organizations to enable these processes is accorded high priority.\nADB\u2019s  short-term  operational  focus  is  placed  on  (i)  effective  upgrading  and  rehabilitation  of\nsmall-scale  water  resource  infrastructure  along  with  the  development  of  WMAs,  which  have\ndemonstrated  growth  and  poverty  reduction  benefits  in  rural  areas  across  a  wide  range  of\nstakeholders  in  the  rural  areas;  and  (ii)  institutional  development  for  sound  water  resource\nmanagement  and  service  delivery  systems,  including  capacity  development  for  strategic,\n\n15  ADB. 1999. Bangladesh Country Operational Strategy: Responding to the Challenge of Poverty. Manila.\n\n                  \n\n\f9\n\nintegrated,  and  participatory  planning  and  implementation  of  water  resource  management\nschemes.  This is in line with ADB\u2019s water policy.\n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n32.\nThe Government has been committed to improving sector performance and has agreed\nwith the following policy actions and implementation time frames. Appendix 4 summarizes these\nelements.\n\n1.\n\nNational Water Policy\n\n33.\nThe SSWRDSP has implemented measures in support of the NWP, particularly for the\n(i) development of participatory processes to involve local communities, including the NGOs as\nfacilitators, in identification, planning, design, construction, and O&M of community-based water\nmanagement  schemes;  (ii)  approval  of  identified  projects  through  the  upazila  development\ncoordination  committee  and  the  district-level  interagency  project  evaluation  committee;  (iii)\ninstitutionalization  of  WMAs;  (iv)  establishment  of  a  system  for  signing  an  implementation\nagreement  before  the  commencement  of  construction;  and  (v)  establishment  of  formal\narrangements for the training of personnel and for handover of O&M responsibility to the WMA.\n\nThe NWP envisages that the ownership of schemes implemented under the SSWRDSP\n34.\nwill eventually be transferred to local governments,16 beginning with facilities that WMAs operate\nand  maintain  in  a  sustainable  manner.  Furthermore,  subprojects  implemented  under  the\nSSWRDSP do not always sufficiently take into account their interaction with existing or planned\nwater  management  infrastructure  in  the  surrounding  areas  and  the  policy  thrust  of  the  NWP.\nThe Project has built in adequate mechanisms to address these gaps, in particular through the\nstructuring  of  contractual  rights  and  obligations  under  implementation  agreements  and  O&M\nagreements,  as  well  as  eventual  transfer  of  ownership  agreements  between  LGED  and  the\nLGIs.  In  addition,  to  ensure  the  deepening  of  the  SSWRDSP  initiatives  and  legislative\ntranslation  of  critical  NWP  measures  across  the  water  resources  sector,  the  Government  has\nundertaken to enact the national water code within 18 months after loan effectiveness. Among\nother  things,  this  new  legislation  will  define  the  role  of  local  government  in  the  planning,\nimplementation,  and  operation  of  small-scale  water  resources  management  and  acquisition  of\nwater rights by a variety of water users in line with the NWP.\n\n2.\n\nFramework for Participatory Water Resources Management\n\n35.\nThe ongoing SSWRDSP has established the legal framework for WMAs by revising the\nexisting  Cooperatives  Societies  Rules  (1987)  under  the  Cooperatives  Act.  These  rules  have\nbeen amended to allow for registration by and contractual capacity of cooperatives to cater to\nWMAs.  While  this  framework  has  allowed  WMAs  to  collect  fees  from  beneficiaries,  the\nexperience  of  the  SSWRDSP  has  showed  that  the  existing  framework  is  administratively\ncomplex.  The  Government  is  in  the  process  of  reforming  the  Cooperatives  Act  with  a  view  to\nsimplifying  administrative  procedures,  enhancing  transparency,  and  reducing  Government\nintervention both directly and indirectly by encouraging the financial soundness of autonomous\ncooperatives.  The  draft  law  is  expected  to  be  approved  by  Cabinet  within  six  months  of  the\neffective date with a view to enactment within one year of the effective date. Policy dialogue with\nADB has indicated that the Government regards such enactment as important in fostering the\n\n                  \n\n16    Both  the  Union  Parishad  Act  and  the  Upazila  Parishad  Act  confer  upon  these  two  local  government  levels  the\n\nauthority to assume the role of owner of small-scale water management infrastructure.\n\n\f10\n\nviability  of  cooperatives  as  continuing  instruments  of  implementation  of  WMA  beneficiary\nparticipation for sustainable small-scale water resources schemes.\n\n36.\nUnder  the  Project,  the  WMAs  will  conclude  implementation  and  O&M  agreements  with\nLGED  and  LGIs.    These  agreements  need  to  more  clearly  reflect  (i)  the  local  government's\nownership of the infrastructure, (ii) the conferral by the local government upon the WMAs of the\nright to use and the obligation to maintain the infrastructure, and (iii) the role of LGED to assist,\nin  line  with  its  mandate,  local  government  in  building  the  infrastructure  and  ensuring  that  it  is\nused  appropriately  and  maintained  in  good  repair.  Before  loan  negotiations,  the  Government\nagreed to ensure that these elements were included in a draft implementation agreement and\nO&M agreement.\n\nIn addition to developing the long-run institutional sustainability of WMAs for small-scale\n37.\nwater  resources  projects  through  changes  to  the  legal  framework  for  cooperatives  linked  with\ncontractual  agreements,  the  NWP  referred  broadly  to  the  need  to  develop  water  user  groups\nwithout restricting these to cooperatives. Consequently, policy dialogue tested the willingness of\nthe Government to evaluate options for institutionalizing WMAs through types of organizations\nother  than  cooperatives.  The  Government  indicated  its  willingness  to  explore  competitive\nalternatives to cooperatives as a means of forming WMAs. In the interest of seeking to introduce\ncompetitive pressures to enhance performance on small-scale water resources schemes, time-\nbound  covenants  were  agreed  with  the  Government  to  identify  enabling  legal  provisions  for\nalternative forms of WMA and pilot test alternative forms of WMA under the Project.\n\n3. \n\n Reorganization of LGED\n\n38.\nAn  ADB-financed  study  completed  in  1998  proposed  the  organizational  reform  and\nstrengthening  of  LGED.17  In  general  that  study  proposed  that  the  need  to  create  a  larger\nnumber  of  nonengineering  positions  within  LGED  so  as  to  strengthen  LGED\u2019s  capacity  to\nimplement  small-scale  water  management  schemes  should  be  reviewed,  to  take  into  account\nthe  needs  of  participatory  water  management.  On  the  basis  of  this  study  and  policy  dialogue,\nstrengthening is required in the areas of (i) increasing understanding water management issues;\n(ii) developing relevant nonengineering skills; (iii) building capacity of community organizers at\nthe field level; and (iv) building managerial capacity of national level staff, including planning and\nnonengineering  aspects  of  water  management  infrastructure.  In  particular,  the  following\npositions  will  need  to  be  created:  (i)  senior  headquarters  staff  in  the  areas  of  institutional\ndevelopment,  environment,  agriculture,  and  aquaculture;  (ii)  socioeconomists  in  the  districts;\nand (iii) community organizers at the upazilas.\n\n39.\nTo ensure a time-bound and appropriate alteration in LGED\u2019s skills mix, policy dialogue\nwith the Government resulted in the Government agreeing to reorganize LGED\u2019s organizational\nstructure and staff functions within three years of the effective date. The Government provided\nin principle approval of the reorganization of LGED in terms of nonengineering positions in an\nadjusted  organization;  50  percent  of  the  proposed  positions  are  to  be  established  in  the\nIntegrated  Water  Resources  Development  Unit  (IWRD)  of  LGED  within  one  year  after  loan\neffectiveness and all the proposed nonengineering positions are to be established within three\nyears after loan effectiveness.\n\n                  \n\n17\n\n    TA  1809-BAN: Strengthening LGED\u2019s Management Capability,  for  $470,000,  approved  on  21  December  1992.\n\nThe same recommendation has been made by the ADB-financed TA 3358 (footnote 3).\n\n\f11\n\n4.\n\nHolistic Water Resources Development\n\n40. Water  resources  development  benefits  those  engaged  in  fisheries.  However,  water\nresources  development  may  also  result  in  some  local  stakeholders,  particularly  fisherfolk\npracticing  floodplain  capture  fishery,  being  adversely  affected  by  such  interventions  without\nhaving the opportunity to share in the intervention's benefits. To mitigate this, the Government\nagreed,  during  policy  dialogue,  that  by  the  conclusion  of  the  implementation  arrangements,\nfisheries development plans would be in place in accordance with the Government\u2019s Guidelines\non  Participatory  Water  Management  and  National  Fisheries  Policy  as  well  as  ADB\u2019s  fisheries\npolicy.  The  Government  will  provide  the  funding  for  the  fisheries  development  plans  for\nbalanced and holistic water resources development from counterpart funds and charges, fees,\nand dues collected for services and facilities by WMAs from members and nonmembers.\n\n5. \n\nWater Sector Governance\n\n41.\nADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  highlighted  the  importance  of  water  sector\ngovernance.  The  Government  agreed  to  enhance  the  accountability  of  water  infrastructure\nprovider to WMA-based local communities through implementation agreements and sustainable\ncost  recovery  for  small-scale  water  resources  infrastructure  based  on  local  community\nparticipation  through  O&M  agreements  and  transfer  agreements  to  LGIs.  In  addition  to\ndeepening  local  participation  to  support  sustainable  cost  recovery  through  contractual\nagreements, the Government also agreed to time-bound covenants requiring the Government to\nensure that annual external performance monitoring by a reputable, private, external consulting\nfirm  could  be  effectively  carried  out  and  external  evaluation  by  an  external  institute\naccomplished within one year of the effective date.\n\nIV.      THE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\n42.\nSince  90  percent  of  the  country\u2019s  poor  live  in  rural  Bangladesh,  agriculture  and  rural\ndevelopment  are  critical  elements  of  the  poverty  reduction  strategy  of  the  Government.  Key\nconstraints  for  rural  poverty  reduction  include  (i)  lack  of  physical  infrastructure;  (ii)  lack  of\nsupport services including extension, marketing, and financial services; (iii) lack of high-quality\nagricultural inputs; (iv) suboptimal utilization of water resources; and (v) lack of access to basic\nsocial services. These were also identified as priority areas of intervention under the framework\nof the partnership agreement signed by the Government and ADB in April 2000.\n\n43. Water  is  the  foundation  for  many  rural  livelihood  activities  of  the  rural  poor,  including\nfisheries, transportation, water supply, and agriculture.  Effective water resources management,\nthen,  is  fundamental  when  addressing  pervasive  rural  poverty  problems  while  promoting\neconomic growth in Bangladesh. This critical water resource has to be managed in a strategic,\nintegrated,  and  participatory  manner  that  includes  mobilizing,  organizing,  and  empowering\nstakeholders.\n\n44.\nThe  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  a  system  of  sound  water  resources  management\naddressing these issues was reflected in the BWFMS and FFYP developed by the mid-1990s.\nBased on the Government\u2019s main instrument to have the strategy implemented, the SSWRDSP\nwas  launched  in  1996  to  enhance  rural  incomes  by  developing  community-based  WMAs  and\ncommunity-managed, small-scale infrastructure. It has been an effective means to reduce rural\npoverty.\n\n\f12\n\n Participatory water resources development and management is necessary to effectively\n45.\nimplement  key  principles  by  strengthening  the  implementation  framework;  this  has  been\ndemonstrated  under  the  SSWRDSP.  Key  elements  still  be  incorporated  include  (i)  ensuring\nstringent coordination of stakeholders at the earliest stages of the project cycle through effective\ninternal  quality  control  and  support;  (ii)  delineating  increasing  roles  for  LGI  involvement  in  line\nwith  the  local  government  reforms  along  with  necessary  capacity  development  of  LGIs;  (iii)\nreorganizing  LGED  as  an  effective  water  resources  sector  agency  with  the  necessary\nmanagerial capacity for nonengineering issues; and (iv) supporting completed subprojects with\nsound  financial,  social,  and  technical  audits.  Expansion  of  small-scale  water  resources\ndevelopment is one of the key elements to reducing rural poverty effectively.\n\nB.       Objectives and Scope\n\n46.\nThe overall goal of the Project is to support the Government\u2019s poverty reduction effort by\nincreasing sustainable agricultural and fishery production. The Project\u2019s objective is to develop\nsustainable stakeholder-driven, small-scale water resources management systems with special\nattention to the poorer section of the population. This objective will be achieved by (i) developing\nimproved means of beneficiary participation in the selection, design, implementation, and O&M\nof  small-scale  water  resources  management  development  systems;  (ii)  rehabilitating  and\nconstructing  small-scale  water \ninfrastructure  with  appropriate\nresources  management \nagricultural  extension,  fisheries  extension,  and  aquaculture  development;  (iii)  developing\neffective  management  of  environmental  and  social  impacts  of  subprojects,  including  on  those\nengaged in practicing floodplain capture fisheries; and (iv) developing institutional strengthening\nand  capacity  building  of  relevant  Government  and  stakeholder  organizations  to  ensure\nadequate support for small-scale water resources development at all levels.\n\n47.\nDuring the project preparatory (footnote 3), a comprehensive study was carried out in the\nfour  sample  subprojects,  which  were  selected  to  represent  about  300  small-scale  water\nresources schemes scattered in the entire country. The study indicates that these subprojects\nwill  deliver  agricultural  benefits  meeting  local  needs  priorities.  Environmental,  social,  and\npoverty impacts are expected to be positive. Approximately 75 percent of the farmers in the four\nsubproject areas are smallholders and marginal and landless farmers. The proportion of poor (a\nrange from 60 percent to 70 percent) among project beneficiaries is larger than their proportion\nin the overall population of the country (46 percent).\n\nThe Project will be implemented in 61 of the country\u2019s 64 districts.18  While the ongoing\n48.\nSSWRDSP  concentrated  on  the  western  parts  of  the  country,  the  new  project  will  be\nimplemented  across  the  entire  nation  in  line  with  medium-  and  long-term  investment  plans  for\nsmall-scale water resources development. Approximately 300 planned subprojects are expected\nto  result  in  sustainable  water  engagement  infrastructure  benefiting  between  180,000  ha,  and\n200,000  ha  of  land  cultivated  by  over  280,000  farm  households.  Subprojects  will  cover  a\ncommand area of up to 1,000 ha with an average of some 650 ha of benefited area in line with\nexperience to date. Consistent with a sector approach and in accordance with the NWMP and\nNWP, the Project will help the Government develop sustainable small-scale water resources for\nbetter sector performance. The Project will be implemented by strengthening LGED, which has\nperformed satisfactorily under the SSWRDSP.\n\n                  \n\n18  The Project will not be operating in the Chittagong Hill Tracts considering the different physical, institutional, and\nsociocultural  conditions.  Interventions  for  submersible  embankments  in  the  northwest  region  will  be  considered\nonly  if  it  can  be  proven  that  beneficiaries  have  the  capacity  to  sustainably  manage  such  structures,  given  the\nunsatisfactory experience with such structures in the past.\n\n\f13\n\nThe project activities are grouped into two components: Participatory Water Resources\n\n49.\nDevelopment, and Institutional Strengthening of the Small-Scale Water Resources Sector.\n\n1.\n\nComponent A: Participatory Water Resources Development\n\n50.\nComponent  A  will  support  participatory  development  of  the  anticipated  300  small-scale\nwater  resource  subprojects.  To  achieve  this,  the  Project  will  utilize  a  process  of  subproject\nselection,  appraisal,  and  design  involving  area  stakeholders  throughout  its  implementation.\nWMAs will be established and provided with substantial institutional support for 3.5 years before\nand during construction.  The WMAs are expected to be involved in design discussions as well\nas in overseeing the construction process and will later take full responsibility for O&M once the\nsubprojects are handed over to them. To expedite beneficiaries\u2019 productive adjustment to their\nnew water regimes, postconstruction fishery and agricultural programs will work with the WMAs.\nMonitoring  and  quality  control  mechanisms  will  gauge  environmental  and  benefit  attainment\nissues in each subproject.\n\na. \n\nMobilization of Beneficiary Participation\n\n51.\nThe  Project  will  provide  extensive  training  for  mobilizing  beneficiaries  to  participate  in\nsubproject selection, planning, implementation, and O&M.  Participatory rural appraisals (PRAs)\nwill be conducted to assess stakeholder\u2019s needs and their concept of the proposed subprojects.\nSubproject appraisals will go through the selection process as well as provide the foundation for\ndesigns that will incorporate appropriate social, economic, and engineering aspects. NGOs will\nbe  contracted  to  facilitate  WMA  development  in  subproject  areas.  This  will  include  (i)  training\nand  fielding  of  male  and  female  facilitators  and  community  organizers;  (ii)  organizing  and\ntraining  labor  contracting  societies  (LCSs);  and  (iii)  training  of  upazila  and  district-level\nengineers  on  the  procedures  and  skills  required  for  beneficiary  participation  and  WMA\ndevelopment.  The  training  of  WMA  members  will  include  the  basic  requirements  regarding\ncooperative management and administration, construction supervision, and O&M planning and\nmanagement. The full backing of each local community will be focused through the WMAs and\nany resource-use conflicts identified (and, if possible, resolved) at the outset of the process.\n\nb. \n\nCommunity-Based Infrastructure Development\n\nThe  Project  will  support  the  development  of  new  civil  works  to  rehabilitate  and/or\n\n52.\nupgrade the following types of water management schemes:\n\n(i)  Flood  management.    Rehabilitate  and  construct  embankments  and/or  sluice  gates\n\nto reduce the extent and duration of flooding of farmland.\n\n(ii)  Drainage  improvement.  Reexcavate  drainage  canals  to  increase  the  capacity  of\ndrainage systems to benefit fisheries and local navigation as well as agriculture.\n(iii)  Water  conservation.  Develop  the  water  retention  capacity  of  existing baors, beels,\nand canals to increase availability of irrigation water by installing a water retention\nstructure and by reexcavating of the bed of the water body.\n\n(iv)  Command  area  development.  Improve  the  existing  irrigation  system  by  providing\nbetter distribution systems (improved canal networks, lining of canals, installation of\nwater control structures, etc.) to extend the irrigable area.\n\nWhere needed, fish-friendly structures will be incorporated into the designed infrastructure.\n\n\f14\n\nDesigned by private Bangladeshi consulting firms, the water management infrastructure\n53.\nwill  be  built  by  local  contractors.  The  design  and  operating  modalities  of  the  infrastructure  will\nminimize the negative impact on fisheries and provide for appropriate mitigation measures such\nas controlled partial flooding of the subproject area. The WMAs will be closely involved in design\nand construction, and responsible for the eventual O&M of the infrastructure.\n\nc. \n\nWater Resources Oriented Support Programs\n\nThe  Project  will  provide  agricultural  extension  services  in  the  subproject  area  through\n54.\nlocal  offices  of  the  Department  of  Agricultural  Extension  (DAE)  to  promote  rapid  adoption  of\nimproved,  environmentally  sound  agricultural  practices  made  possible  or  more  attractive  to\nfarmers through their subproject\u2019s water resources development.  In particular, the Project will\nsupport  (through  training  and  services  such  as  soil  testing)  (i)  introducing  integrated  pest\nmanagement  to  encourage  optimum  use  of  agrochemicals,  (ii)  expanding  production  of  high\nyielding variety rice crops, and (iii) diversifying cropping patterns to increase farm revenues and\nimprove  nutrition.  These  activities  address  (i)  measures  necessary  to  adjust  cropping  patterns\nand intensity in the subproject area, and (ii) mitigation of the loss of floodplain fisheries.\n\n55.\nThe  Department  of  Fisheries  (DOF)  will  provide  fisheries  extension  to  the  concerned\nstakeholders  and  train  them  in  managing  the  fisheries  resources  available  to  them  in  the\nsubproject  area's  beels,  khals  and  other  open  and  semiopen  water  bodies.  Culture  fishery\nopportunities  such  as  those  created  in  the  khals  behind  water  retention  structures  will  be\nreserved  for  the  poor  and  those  having  lost  access  to  floodplain  fisheries. Khas  water  bodies\nwithin the subproject boundaries will be leased out to the poor for a nominal fee.\n\nd. \n\nMonitoring and Quality Control\n\n56.\nThe  Project  will  ensure  the  effective  identification  and  management  of  environmental\nimpacts  at  each  subproject  site  by  applying  procedures  and  guidelines  developed  under  the\nSSWRDSP for (i) undertaking an initial environmental examination (IEE) environmental impact\nassessment (EIA) during the PRAs and feasibility study periods; (ii) preparing an environmental\nmanagement  plan;  and  (iii)  monitoring  and  managing  impacts,  both  inside  and  outside  the\nsubproject  benefit  area.  Environmental  indicators,  including  water  quality,  will  be  monitored\nduring  construction  of  the  infrastructure  and  during  the  infrastructure's  subsequent  O&M.\nAppropriate corrective measures will be taken in cases where the value of an indicator is found\nto  lie  outside  the  acceptable  range  of  values.  A  biodiversity  baseline  study  will  be  carried  out.\nAs  part  of  the  environmental  program,  a  selection  of  local  stakeholders  will  receive  training  in\nthe use of sensitive ecosystems. Such training is intended to both encourage responsibility for\nactivities  relative  to  the  environment  and  enable  local  people  to  more  effectively  monitor\nenvironmental effects of their subprojects.\n\n57.\nA monitoring system will be utilized to enable project management to effectively control\nthe  quality  of  both  institutional  and  construction  aspects  of  the  Project.  In  addition,  benefit\nmonitoring  functions  will  help  track  the  effectiveness  of  completed  subprojects  in  fulfilling  the\nProject\u2019s objectives of enhanced agricultural production and poverty reduction.\n\n2.\n\nComponent B: Institutional Strengthening of the Small-Scale Water\n Resources Sector\n\n58.\nInstitutional  strengthening  provided  under  component  B  will  enhance  the  capacity  of\nconcerned  sector  organizations  to  effectively  participate  in  small-scale  water  resources\n\n\f15\n\ndevelopment.  This  program  will  include  (i)  the  advisory  services  of  an  international  consulting\nfirm in association with a national firm or firms, and (ii) the training of organizations (other than\nWMAs)19 involved in the Project's implementation.\n\na.\n\nSupport for Project Management\n\n59.\nConsulting  services  will  be  provided  to  assist  LGED  in  building  up  its  capacity  at  the\nnational,  district,  and  upazila  levels  to  manage  the  planning  and  construction  of  small-scale\nwater  management  infrastructure  and  in  managing  the  use  and  maintenance  of  the\ninfrastructure  on  behalf  of  local  government.  Assistance  will  primarily  be  provided  to  (i)  refine\nand  develop  the  systems  and  procedures  established  under  the  SSWRDSP  for  subproject\nplanning,  design,  construction,  O&M,  environmental  monitoring,  social  monitoring,  and  benefit\nmonitoring  and  evaluation;  (ii)  refine  the  systems  and  procedures  established  under  the\nSSWRDSP to prepare environmental reports and implement mitigation plans and monitoring of\nenvironmental  impacts;  (iii)  review  bylaws  for  WMAs;  (iv)  facilitate  the  planning,  programming,\nand  quality  control  of  subprojects;  and  (v)  guide  LGED  in  meeting  ADB's  reporting\nrequirements. By the end of the Project, LGED will be expected to have an improved capacity to\nundertake small-scale water resources development without substantial additional TA.\n\nb.\n\nCapacity Building for Sustainable Management\n\n60.\nAccording  to  perceived  needs,  the  Project  will  provide  training  for  institutional\nstrengthening  within  various  organizations  involved  in  the  small-scale  water  resources  sector.\nWhile some of this strengthening is aimed at enhancing performance in the implementation of\nthe  water  resources  development  activities  of  the  Project,  the  training  program  is  largely\nintended to enhance the long-term abilities of the institutional stakeholders involved to carry out\nsmall-scale  water  resources  development  according  to  the  NWP.  The  Project  will  support\nestablishment  of  a  water  resources  development  unit  within  LGED  headquarters  capable  of\nmanaging  the  development  process.  The  training  program  will  develop  awareness  of  upazila-\nand district-level staff of the principal engineering and nonengineering dimensions of small-scale\nwater  resources  development;  and  build  capacity  of  staff  to  play  a  meaningful  role  in  the\nparticipatory  identification  and  planning  of  subprojects,  and  to  effectively  manage  the\nimplementation of subprojects.\n\n61.\nThe  consulting  services  team  will  design  the  programs,  select  and  contract  competent\nagencies  to  provide  the  training,  and  supervise  and  evaluate  the  delivery  of  the  training\nprogram.    The  training  will  be  designed  in  response  to  well-defined  needs  and  provided  in\naccordance with priorities based on the urgency of those needs.\n\nC.        Cost Estimates\n\n62.\nThe  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $78.0  million,  of  which  $15.9  million  is  the  foreign\nexchange  cost  (20  percent)  and  $62.1  million  equivalent  (80  percent)  the  local  currency  cost.\nTable 1 summarizes these cost estimates, the details of which are set out in Appendix 5.\n\n19  Training of the WMAs is part of the mobilization of beneficiary participation subcomponent of component A.\n\n                  \n\n\f16\n\n    Table 1: Cost Estimates\n    ($ million)\n\n       \n\nComponent\n\nA:   Participatory Water Resources\n      Development\nB:  Institutional Strengthening of Small-Scale\n      Water Resources Sector\n      Subtotal (A&B)\nService Charge\n      TOTAL\n\nD. \n\nFinancing Plan\n\n  Foreign\nExchange\n\n10.7\n\n          4.2\n\n14.9\n  1.0\n15.9\n\n   Local\nCurrency\n       55.9\n\n6.2\n\n62.1\n0.0\n62.1\n\n Total\n  Cost\n66.6\n\n10.4\n\n77.0\n  1.0\n78.0\n\n63.\nADB will provide a loan equivalent to $34.0 million from its Special Funds resources to\nfinance about 44 percent of the total cost of the Project.

Implementation Arrangements\n\n1.\n\nOrganizational Arrangements\n\nThe  implementation  arrangements  developed  under  the  SSWRDSP  will  be  applied  for\n65.\nthe  Project  with  improvements.  A  project  steering  committee  will  be  formed  and  consist  of\nrepresentatives of all ministries and agencies concerned.20 The committee will be chaired by the\nsecretary of MOLGRDC, with the chief engineer, LGED as member-secretary. Representatives\nfrom  ADB\u2019s  Bangladesh  Resident  Mission  and  the  Government  of  the  Netherlands  will\nparticipate in the committee as observers. Committee meetings will be held semiannually during\nthe first year and annually from the second year to provide overall coordination, or whenever an\nissue requiring interministerial coordination arises.\n\n66.\nThe  organization  chart  in  Appendix  6  shows  the  relationships  of  the  various  entities\nparticipating  in  project  implementation.  The  project  management  office  (PMO),  established  at\nLGED  headquarters  in  Dhaka  since  July  1995  to  manage  implementation  of  the  ongoing\nSSWRDSP,  will  be  transformed  to  the  PMO  for  the  proposed  Project  by  31  October  2001.  A\nsenior engineer of LGED of the rank of executive engineer or higher heads the PMO as project\ndirector. The PMO will have full authority to execute the Project and liaise with ADB. The PMO\nwill (i) coordinate with other agencies concerned; (ii) prepare an overall implementation plan and\nannual  project  work  plans  and  budgets;  (iii)  review  and  approve  subproject  appraisals;  (iv)\nreview and approve designs; (v) supervise LGED district offices in preparing tender documents,\nevaluating bids, and awarding contracts for equipment, civil works, and other project activities;\n(vi) maintain financial accounts; (vii) prepare periodic reports on implementation progress; and\n(viii)  monitor  project  progress  and  evaluate  environmental  impact,21  social  impact,  and  project\nbenefits for poor people.\n\n67. \nUnder  close  guidance  and  supervision  of  the  PMO,  LGED  district  offices  will  be\nresponsible  for  the  day-to-day  implementation  at  the  subproject  level  with  assistance  from  the\nLGED upazila offices. The LGED district executive engineer will act as subproject manager and\n(i) prepare individual subproject implementation plans in consultation with local stakeholders; (ii)\ncoordinate  with  other  agencies  and  NGOs,  firms,  and  institutes  concerned;  (iii)  help  local\nstakeholders  to  organize  into  WMAs  with  support  from  NGO,  and  firm  facilitators  and  LGED\ncommunity  organizers;  (iv)  carry  out  field  surveys  with  support  from  the  PMO  quality  control\nassurance  (design)  unit;22  (v)  supervise  construction  activities  and  make  payments  to\ncontractors; and (vi) monitor and report subproject development to the PMO.\n\n68.\nA  district-level  small-scale  water  resources  development  committee  chaired  by  the\ndeputy    commissioner  with  the    assistance  of  the  LGED  district    executive  engineer,    as\nmember-secretary  will  meet when  required  to  coordinate   the  activities  of  the  Government\n\n                  \n\n20\n\n  The  Project  Steering  Committee  will  include  Ministry  of  Finance  Ministry  of  Water  Resources,  BWDB,  Water\nResources  Planning  Organization,  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Department  of  Agricultural  Extension,  NGO  Affairs\nBureau,  Ministry  of  Land,  Ministry  of  Youth  and  Sports,  Department  of  Youth  Development,  Department  of\nWomen's  Affairs,  Rural  Development  and  Cooperatives  Division  of  MOLGRDC,  Department  of  Cooperatives,\nMinistry  of  Fisheries  and  Livestock,  DOF,  Department  of  Environment,  Economic  Relations  Division,\nImplementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division, and Planning Commission.\n\n21  The results of monitoring the environmental impact will be submitted to Department of Environment.\n22  This  unit  will  recruit  a  senior  design  engineer,  hydrologist,  four  midlevel  engineers,  four  junior  water  resource\n\nengineers, and supporting staff.\n\n\f18\n\nagencies.23    MOLGRDC  will  issue  an  order  requiring  the  Upazalial  Development  Coordination\nCommittee, composed of the union chairpersons and upazila-level officials, to put the review of\nthe  subproject  progress  on  the  agenda  of  all  its  regular  meetings.  LGED  district  offices  will\nmaintain close coordination with BWDB through the Inter-Agency Project Evaluation Committee\nto ensure that proposed subprojects do not conflict with planned or existing BWDB projects.\n\n69.\nIn  support  of  LGED\u2019s  implementation,  DAE  will  provide  technical  input  during\nidentification, appraisal, and design of each subproject, and training and extension for increased\ncrop  production  and  diversification.  DOF  will  provide  technical  input  during  identification,\nappraisal,  and  design  of  each  subproject.  DOF  will  contribute  to  the  fisheries  development\nactivities  focusing  on  the  support  to  the  project-affected  persons.  Department  of  Environment\nwill  review  the  IEEs/EIAs  of  subprojects  and  monitor  the  environmental  impact  of  the  Project\nindependently.  Qualified  national  NGOs,  firms,  or  institutes  will  be  recruited  for  PRAs  and\nbeneficiary mobilization of the WMAs to ensure effective subproject screening and stakeholder\ninvolvement  and  to  form  and  train  WMAs  and  LCSs.  Such  NGOs,  firms,  or  institutes  will  be\nselected  by  the  PMO  in  consultation  with  the  consultants.  NGOs  will  also  assist  the  LCS\nparticipants in identifying sources for credit and other assistance.\n\n2. \n\nSubproject Selection, Processing, and Environmental Assessment\n\nTo qualify for inclusion under the Project, a subproject must meet the following criteria:  \n\n70.\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nThe  subproject  must  be  in  line  with  the  district  strategies  and  guidelines  for  small-\nscale  water  resources  interventions  to  be  developed  during  the  process  of  the\nNWMP as approved.\nMore  than  40  percent  of  the  subproject  benefit  area  will  be  operated  by  landless\nsharecroppers, and marginal or small farmers (up to 1.0 ha); preference will be given\nto  subprojects  with  higher  percentages  of  land  operated  by  these  farmers  and  to\nsubprojects located in food-deficit areas.24\nEach  subproject  will  entail  rehabilitating  or  upgrading  an  existing  water  control\nsystem, which may include new supplementary structures in existing systems.\nNot more than 30 percent of the households depend on full-time or part-time capture\nfisheries within the subproject area.\nThe  subproject  cost  must  not  exceed  $1,000/ha  for  command  area  development\nschemes and $500/ha for other schemes without ADB approval.\nThe benefited area served by the subproject must be more than 50 ha and must not\nexceed 1,000 ha.\nEach  subproject  must  be  technically  feasible;  economically  viable  (the  economic\ninternal  rate  of  return  [EIRR]  should  be  more  than  12  percent);  and  socially  and\nenvironmentally  sound  (requiring  no  or  minimal  displacement  of  people  and  land\nacquisition.\n\n(viii)  The  IEE  or  EIA  study  has  been  undertaken  and  appropriately  approved  after\nconsulting  the  beneficiaries  and  those  affected  by  the  project,  concluding  that  the\nsubproject  is  environmentally  sound  and  the  negative  consequences  can  be\nmitigated.\n\n                  \n\n23\n\n24\n\n    It  will  include  the  additional  deputy  commissioner  (revenue),  the  concerned  LGED  upazila  engineer,  and  the\ndistrict-level  representatives  of  DAE,  Department  of  Cooperatives,  DOF,  Department  of  Women\u2019s  Affairs  and\nDepartment  of  Youth  Development.  The  meeting  will  address  issues  like  access  of  WMAs  to  the  public  water\nbodies and land acquisition.\n\n  This will be applied to ensure that the proportion of poor among project beneficiaries will be substantially higher\n\nthan national average.\n\n\f19\n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\nLocal stakeholders of each subproject must have indicated support for the proposed\nsubproject and willingness to form a WMA, or in the case of a subproject with mainly\nfisheries benefits, fisherfolk must support the undertaking.\nRecurrent  maintenance  costs  of  each  subproject  beneficiary  will  be  covered  by  the\nO&M  budget  of  the  WMA's  O&M  committee,  and  funds  collected  from  the  direct\nsubproject beneficiaries in proportion to the benefit they receive.\n\nOn  the  basis  of  the  selection  criteria  and  in  consultation  with  stakeholders,  the  union\n71.\nparishad  will  initiate  a  subproject  proposal.  The  LGED  upazila  engineer  will  prepare  the\nsubproject proposal and submit it to the UDCC for clearance. Then, the LGED upaliza engineer\nwill submit the proposal to the PMO through the LGED district executive engineer. The PMO will\nprescreen the proposal during a multidisciplinary field reconnaissance visit. This is followed by\n(i)  a  PRA  with  the  engagement  of  contracted  NGOs,  firms,  or  institutes,  and  (ii)  a  feasibility\nstudy  with  the  engagement  of  private  firms,  both  undertaken  by  the  PMO  in  consultation  with\nbeneficiaries  and  affected  persons,  Union  Parishad,  and \nthe  Upazalial  Development\nCoordination  Committee.  Viable  subprojects  will  be  cleared  by  the  Inter-Agency  Project\nAppraisal Committee.  The detailed design will be prepared by the PMO after the prescreening\nof the subproject proposal.\n\n3. \n\nWater Management Associations and Infrastructure Development\n\n72.\nFollowing subproject approval, the process of establishing WMAs will be initiated under\nthe legal framework of the Cooperatives Societies Ordinance (1984) and Cooperative Societies\nRules (1987) as amended; the new Cooperatives Act, which is due to be enacted; or alternative\nlegal  framework,  which  may  be  framed  pursuant  to  the  recommendations  of  the  Interagency\nTask  Force  on  Guidelines  for  Participatory  Water  Management.  Contracted  facilitators  will\npromote membership enrollment, collection of beneficiary contributions, preparation for election,\nconflict  resolution,  and  registration.  The  PMO  will  also  undertake  engineering  design  work  in\nconsultation with stakeholders. A resettlement (land acquisition) plan, if relevant, along with an\nenvironmental  mitigation  plan  will  also  be  drafted  in  consultation  with  those  affected,25  with\nunion parishads providing coordination support.26 This process will culminate in the signing of a\nformal implementation agreement by the WMA, local government representatives, and LGED\u2019s\ndistrict  executive  engineer.  To  sign  the  implementation  agreement,  the  WMA  must  have\nachieved  a  number  of  preconditions  including    (i)  WMA  enrollment  of  at  least  70  percent  of\nbeneficiary households;27 (ii) collection of beneficiary contributions equivalent to an annual O&M\nrequirement, deposited in a joint account by LGED and the WMA; and (iii) Borrower\u2019s approved\nplans in consultation with people-affected by the environmental mitigation and resettlement.\n\n73.\nSubsequent to the implementation agreement, tender invitation and LCS training will be\ninitiated.  The  WMA  will  actively  participate  in  observing  construction  and  may  complain  to  the\nupazila  engineer  or  higher  authorities  under  a  complaints  procedure.  Final  payment  to\ncontractors will only be effected after sign off by a quality control engineer before the final bill.\nLGED  will  also  undertake  effective  internal  office  inspection  and  performance  audits  with\n\n                  \n\nthose are prepared in order.\n\n25  The resettlement plan and the environmental mitigation plan will be signed-off by LGED and WMA to confirm that\n\n26    For  conflicts  that  cannot  be  resolved  at  this  level,  the  matter  will  be  raised  to  a  committee  established  for  this\npurpose  through  a  notice  in  the  official  gazette  issued  by  MOLGRDC  called  the  Local  Conflict  Resolution\nCommittee.  Until  there  is  an  elected  chairperson  at  the  upazila,  the  committee  will  be  chaired  by  the  upazila\nnirbahi officer. The members will be authorized to conduct inquiries and to take measures to enforce its decisions\nand to take preemptive action. The facilitators will facilitate this process.\n\n27    At  the  same  time,  enrollment  of  at  least  the  same  percentage  of  large-  and  medium-sized  farm  households  will\n\nalso be checked and confirmed.\n\n\f20\n\nqualified  engineers  from  the  PMO  and  the  consulting  team.  To  direct  benefits  to  the  poor,  all\nearthworks of the Project will be carried out by an LCS comprising vulnerable persons; destitute\nwomen will be given particular preference. The WMA will also receive DAE and DOF support to\nprepare  agriculture  and  fisheries  development  plans.  DAE  and  DOF  will  organize  training  for\nWMA representatives who will work as liaison extensionists to beneficiaries.\n\n4.\n\nOperation and Maintenance Arrangements\n\nIn line with the NWP, each water control system rehabilitated and/or upgraded under the\n74.\nProject will be turned over to the WMA concerned within one year after completion. The WMAs\nwill  have  primary  responsibility  for  O&M,  including  all  routine  and  periodic  maintenance,  while\nthe  Government  will  provide  assistance  for  major  improvements  and  repair  of  catastrophic\ndamage  due  to  events  exceeding  the  design  standards  of  the  infrastructure.  Through\nregistration of WMAs and leases of Government land, WMAs will be ensured adequate authority\nto  implement  their  O&M  responsibilities,  including  enforcing  decisions,  mobilizing  resources\nfrom  beneficiaries  through  fees,  and  managing  embankment  lands,  waters,  and  other  parts  of\nthe  scheme.  The  Government  land  comprising  water  bodies,  embankments,  and  drainage\ncanals  will  be  leased  to  the  WMAs,  which  will  promote  income  generating  activities  that  use\nscheme facilities, such as tree planting on embankments and aquaculture in ponds and canals.\nThese will be targeted at providing opportunities for the poor.\n\n75.\nTo  establish  sustainable  O&M  arrangements,  the  WMA  will  form  an  O&M  committee\nduring  the  construction  period,  which  will  prepare  a  takeover  schedule,  beneficiary  list  and\nmaps,  and  an  O&M  plan  comprising  operating  guidelines,  maintenance  plan,  and  resource\nmobilization plan, with assistance from the PMO. After civil works are completed, the PMO will\nprovide  on-the-job  training  to  the  WMA  for  up  to  a  full  year  to  undertake  (i)  annual  inspection\nthrough  a  joint  walk-through  by  the  WMA  and  LGED  upazila  staff,  (ii)  identification  of\nmaintenance  needs,  (iii)  preparation  and  implementation  of  an  annual  O&M  plan,  and  (iv)\nraising  and  collecting  of  O&M  fees.  After  this  period  and  satisfaction  of  preconditions  for\nsustainable O&M, the WMA will enter into a formal O&M agreement with the local government\non project facilities. After the O&M agreement is signed, the WMA will have access to the funds\nplaced  as  the  beneficiary  contribution,  which  will  be  jointly  managed  by  district  executive\nengineer and the WMA. To ensure sustainable operation of the WMA, LGED upazila staff will\nconduct  annual  inspections  and  provide  technical  guidance  as  needed.  Annual  audits  will  be\nundertaken by Department of Cooperatives.\n\n5.        Institutional Framework of WMAs\n\n76.\nThe Project will help the Government study alternatives to cooperatives, such as WMAs,\nby (i) assessing the effectiveness of the existing institutional framework in attaining its objective\nof sustainable O&M, (ii) identifying potential measures for improvement including the possibility\nof  defining  an  alternative  legal  framework,  and  (iii)  preparing  actions  for  pilot  testing,\nestablishing, and operating the potential improved measures. The study will be conducted at the\nearly stage of project implementation after inception, in collaboration with the interagency task\nforce  that  prepared  the  Government\u2019s  guidelines  for  Participatory  Water  Management,  which\nhas endorsed the existing institutional framework of WMAs under ongoing SSWRDSP.\n\n6. \n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n77.\nThe Project will be implemented over seven years, including one-year for O&M support.\nImplementation  of  40  subprojects  whose  WMA  formation  was  initiated  under  the  ongoing\n\n\f21\n\nSSWRDSP will commence in the first and the second year. These subprojects are followed by\n260  new  subprojects.  The  proposed  implementation  schedule  is  given  in  Appendix  7.    An\nimplementation  schedule  comprising  four  batches  of  subprojects  (one  batch  commenced  per\nyear  for  four  years)  has  been  prepared  on  this  basis,  with  adequate  overprogramming  of\nsubprojects  under  the  institutional  development  process.  The  Project  will  also  monitor  and\nsupervise the O&M of schemes developed under the SSWRDSP.\n\n78.\nA typical subproject will take about two years for development of the WMA followed by\ntwo  years  for  construction  and  an  additional  year  for  guidance  on  O&M,  concurrently  with\nagricultural  and  fishery  extension  support,  totaling  five  years  from  identification  to  O&M\nturnover.  Project  progress  will  be  jointly  reviewed  biannually  by  the  Bangladesh  Government,\nADB,  and  the  Government  of  the  Netherlands  to  ensure  that  the  required  rate  of  progress  is\nachieved without compromising project quality.\n\n7.\n\nProcurement\n\nSupplies  to  be  procured  under  the  Project,  estimated  to  cost  about  $2.4  million  and\n79.\nconsisting  generally  of  service  vehicles,  construction  equipment,  computers,  and  survey  and\nlaboratory  equipment,  will  be  packaged,  procured,  and  awarded  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement.  Supply  contracts  not  anticipated  to  exceed  the  equivalent  of\n$500,000  will  be  awarded  in  accordance  with  international  shopping  procedures.  Other\nmiscellaneous  equipment  and  supplies,  with  each  package  valued  below  the  equivalent  of\n$100,000, will be procured by direct purchase procedures.\n\nCivil  works  envisaged  under  the  Project  will  consist  mainly  of  small  labor-intensive\n80.\nconstruction activities at widely dispersed locations.  Construction techniques will be simple and\nof a type extensively used in Bangladesh.  The total cost of civil works contracts is estimated at\n$37  million,  with  an  average  cost  of  about  $125,000  per  contract.  Such  small  contracts  are\nunlikely  to  attract  international  contractors  and  are  within  the  capability  of  local  contractors.\nTherefore, all civil works contracts, except small earthwork contracts with LCSs will be awarded\nunder local competitive bidding procedures following standard LGED procedures acceptable to\nADB. A summary of prequalified contractors and the results of prequalification will be provided\nto ADB for information. Award of contracts valued above $300,000 equivalent will be subject to\nprior approval of ADB. Small earthwork contracts valued at less than $5,000 equivalent will be\ncarried out by LGED\u2019s force account utilizing LCSs of disadvantaged poor groups.\n\n8.\n\nConsulting Services\n\n81.\nThe consultants will be selected by ADB and engaged by the Government in accordance\nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other  arrangements  on  the  use  of\ndomestic consultants satisfactory to ADB. A total of 937 person-months of consulting services is\nrequired,  including  808  person-months  of  domestic  and  129  person-months  of  international\nconsulting  inputs.  The  total  cost  of  the  consulting  services  is  estimated  at  about  $8.3  million\nequivalent, and will be financed by the Government of the Netherlands on an untied grant basis.\nThe  grant  will  be  administered  by  ADB.  Appendix  8  shows  the  outline  terms  of  reference  for\nconsulting services.\n\n9.       Loan Disbursements\n\n82.\nTo ensure timely release of funds for small payments, an imprest account will be opened\nin  the  name  of  the  Project  at  a  commercial  bank  designated  by  the  Bangladesh  Bank\n\n\f22\n\nimmediately  after  loan  effectiveness.  The  initial  deposit  of  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed\n$3 million and be based on estimated expenditures of the first six months of project expenditure.\nThe  statements  of  expenditure  procedure  will  also  be  adopted  to  facilitate  reimbursement  and\nliquidation  of  a  large  number  of  small  contracts,  with  a  ceiling  of  $50,000  per  contract  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2001).\n\n10.\n\nMonitoring and Evaluation\n\nThe  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  subprojects  will  be  carried  out  under  the  direction  of\n83.\nthe  PMO.  Necessary  surveys  will  follow  the  prescriptions  of  ADB\u2019s Handbook on Benefit and\nMonitoring  and  Evaluation  (1992),  Environmental  Guidelines  for  Selected  Agricultural  and\nNatural Development Projects (1991), Guidelines on Incorporation of Social Dimension in Bank\nOperations  (1993),  and Environmental Assessment Requirements and Environmental Review\nProcedures of the Asian Development Bank  (1993).  Within  six  months  of  loan  effectiveness,\nLGED will have established a management information system based on the system developed\nfor  SSWRDSP.  This  management  information  system  will  be  used,  among  other  things,  for\ncontinuous effect monitoring and evaluation of all subprojects in the implementation plan of the\nSSWRDSP and the proposed Project in a manner acceptable to ADB.28 Specific indicators to be\nmonitored will include crop type, area, and yields; fisheries production and beneficiaries; water\nlevels, infrastructure operational status, water quality, institutional membership, financial status,\nmeetings, and elections, and O&M budgets, plans, funds collected, and funds disbursed.\n\n84.\nBME  requires  useful  and  statistically  valid  assessments  and,  to  be  meaningful,  will  be\ncarried out by independent specialized organizations contracted by the PMO. BME studies will\nbe  conducted  on  10  percent  of  subprojects  in  the  implementation  plan  and  the  impact\nassessment  study  will  be  carried  out  five  years  after  subproject  completion.  The  Government\nwill  engage  an  organization,  which  will  be  contracted  to  carry  out  both  the  baseline  and  the\nimpact  assessment  studies.  The  BME  shall  assess  farm  income  for  different  farm  categories,\nin/out  migration,\ndaily  wages,  additional  employment  creation  (gender  disaggregated), \ndistributive  impacts  of  changes  in  fish  production  (distinguishing  between  capture  and  culture\nfishery), and perceptions of subproject benefits.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Government  will  engage  a  consulting  team:  11  person-months  of\n85.\ninternational  consulting  and  22  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  to  undertake  external\nperformance  monitoring  and  evaluation  throughout  the  duration  of  the  Project.  This  team  will\nreview  work  progress  against  implementation  plans,  assess  the  quality  of  institutional\ndevelopment and construction activities, and provide advice leading to an overall improvement\nin project performance.\n\n11.\n\nAccounts, Audit, and Reports\n\n86.\nLGED will establish and maintain accounts for expenditures incurred under the Project.\nBased  on  successful  performance  of  accounts,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  all  accounts\nand related financial statements are audited by auditors acceptable to ADB. An audit report with\ncertified accounts and financial statements will be submitted to ADB within 12 months after the\nend  of  each  fiscal  year.  The  imprest  account  and  expenditures  reimbursement  or  replenished\nand  liquidated  under  the  statement  of  expenditures  procedure  will  be  included  in  the  audit\n\n                  \n\n28 Data quality is expected to improve in the proposed Project because baseline data collection will be outsourced;\n\ntrained permanent staff of LGED will collect postproject effect data.\n\n\f23\n\nreport, and the opinion will be included separately in the audit report. The audit may be carried\nout as part of the regular annual audit of LGED\u2019s general accounts.\n\n87.\nThe  PMO  will  prepare  quarterly  progress  reports  giving  details  on  progress  in  the\nstandard  format  described  in  the  project  administration  memorandum,  and  will  submit  them  to\nADB  and  the  Royal  Netherlands  Embassy  in  Dhaka,  within  one  month  after  the  end  of  the\nperiod under review.  The PMO will also submit benefit monitoring and evaluation reports, the\nmidterm review report, and the project completion report (three months before the loan closing\ndate).\n\n88.\nThe Project will contain a component for external performance review for monitoring the\nsubprojects  of  the  ongoing  SSWRSP  and  the  proposed  Project  on  the  (i)  status  of  WMA\ndevelopment and sustainability, (ii) progress of social and environmental measures, (iii) quality\nand functional status of infrastructure, and (iv) condition of O&M. Annual external performance\nmonitoring will be conducted by separate consulting firms.\n\n     \n\n12.\n\nAdvance Procurement Action\n\nUpon  request  of \n\n89.\nthe  Government,  ADB  management  has  approved  advance\nprocurement  action  to  facilitate  timely  implementation  of  the  Project.  Advance  procurement\naction  was  required  for  procurement  of  urgently  needed  consulting  services,  materials,\nequipment, and vehicles. The Government was advised that approval of advance procurement\naction does not commit ADB to finance the Project.\n\n13.       Midterm Review\n\n90.\nA  comprehensive  midterm  review  will  be  conducted  jointly  by  the  Bangladesh\nGovernment, ADB, and the Government of the Netherlands, in the third year of implementation.\nThe  review  will  include  (i)  progress  of  the  Project,  including  planning  and  design,  stakeholder\nparticipation,  physical  works  construction  quality,  irrigation/drainage  area  rehabilitated  and/or\nupgraded, and possibilities for modifying the project scope; (ii) future implementation plans and\ntargets;  (iii)  allocation  of  funds  among  loan  categories;  (iv)  effectiveness  of  the  project\nmanagement  structures  and  implementation  arrangements  including  TA  consultants,  and  any\nneed  for  modifications;  (v)  environmental,  social,  economic,  and  technical  aspects  of  the\nProject; and (vi) institutional sustainability and progress on developing an adequate institutional\nframework at all levels. Compliance with loan covenants and reporting requirements will also be\nreviewed.\n\nG.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironmental Measures\n\n91.\nThe Project is classified under environmental category B. IEEs were carried out in four\nsample subproject areas in accordance with ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines to assess possible\nadverse  impacts  arising  from  the  Project.  These  subprojects  include  the  four  main  types  of\ninfrastructure  development  to  be  carried  out:  flood  control  and  management,  drainage\nimprovement,  water  conservation,  and  command  area  development.  All  the  subprojects  were\nconsidered environmentally sound as the possible negative consequences can be mitigated to\nan acceptable level. A summary IEE is attached as Appendix 9.\n\n\f24\n\nAn IEE or EIA will be carried out for all subprojects, at the feasibility study level. When\n92.\nwarranted,  a  full-scale  EIA,  or  other  studies  to  deal  with  specific  issues,  will  be  undertaken.\nLGED will consult with the stakeholders about the environmental assessments prior to approval\nof all the subprojects to be constructed and forward a copy to the Department of Environment.\nto  be\nBefore  undertaking  subproject  construction, \nenvironmentally feasible and that any negative consequences can be mitigated to an acceptable\ndegree. Reports for subprojects that cost more than $1 million equivalent, must be submitted to\nADB  for  approval  before  their  implementation.  At  its  discretion,  ADB  may  request  to  review  a\nreport  before  implementation  of  subprojects  with  costs  estimated  at  less  than  $1  million\nequivalent.  Baseline  water  quality  information  will  be  established  by  taking  and  analyzing\nrepresentative samples of surface and groundwater for each subproject.\n\nthe  subproject  must  be  shown \n\nThe water management schemes to be upgraded and/or rehabilitated under the Project\n93.\nare  relatively  small.  They  are  generally  within  existing  flood  control,  drainage,  and  irrigation\nsystems, and as such, will not significantly affect the hydrology of the system. Most subprojects\nidentified will improve flood control and drainage, and reduce the effects of early floods during\nthe  premonsoon  period  and  water  logging  during  the  postmonsoon  period;  they  will  have  a\nfavorable  environmental  impact.  Other  subprojects  will  provide  water  storage  to  enable\nadditional irrigation during the dry season.\n\nLGED has established an environmental monitoring program for the Project to quantify\n94.\neffects on the environment in environmentally sensitive subproject areas. The Government has\nrecognized  potential  problems  associated  with  intensive  agricultural  production  and  has\nsupported  initiatives  to  introduce  integrated  pest  management.  The  Project  will  continue  to\nexpand integrated pest management activities through training and extension services, and the\nprovision of essential equipment for monitoring water quality.\n\n95.\nLGED capacity will be developed to support the imparting sustainable resource use ethic\namong beneficiaries.  This will form an integral part of an expanded training program for O&M\npersonnel  in  the  WMAs  and  local  LGED  staff,  as  well  as  representatives  from  the  union\nparishad.    An  important  aim  of  this  approach  is  to  ensure  wetland  and  aquatic  habitat  is\npreserved as fish breeding sanctuaries and important biodiversity sites are not violated.\n\n96.\nTo  reduce  any  adverse  impact  on  subsistence  floodplain  fisheries,  subprojects  will\ninclude  improved  design  and  management  for  sluice  gate  operation  to  ensure  environmental\nrequirements are met for fish migration and land inundation during critical periods. Aquaculture\nwill be introduced in canals, borrow pits, ponds, and beels.\n\n2. \n\nSocial Measures\n\nA  socioeconomic  analysis  was  carried  out  in  four  subproject  areas,29  to  assess  the\n97.\nexpected socioeconomic impact of the Project. The majority of farmers in the subproject areas\nare marginal farmers, with 0.2 to 0.5 ha of land (40 percent), and small-scale farmers, with 0.5\nto  1.0  ha  (25  percent);  10  percent  are  landless  farmers,  and  25  percent  have  medium-  and\nlarge-size  holdings.  The  incidence  of  poverty  is  high.  The  landless  and  marginal  farmers  live\nbelow the extreme poverty line and the majority of smallholders fall below the moderate poverty\nline. The Project will contribute to increased agricultural production, improve food security, and\naddress the viability of poor rural people. Agriculture benefits from the subprojects are likely to\naccrue  mainly  to  landowners.  However,  the  project  design  ensures  that  the  poor,  including\n\n                  \n29  Abatpur, Choto Kumira, Purba Sayedpur, and Sriramkandi.\n\n\f25\n\nlandless  and  marginal  farmers,  at  least  share  equally  in  the  distribution  of  the  income  growth\nbenefit from the Project through increased agricultural production and employment opportunities\n(Appendix 10). The benefit gained by landowners due to increased value of land is expected to\nbe marginal.\n\n98.\nGroups  of  fisherfolk  may  be  negatively  affected  by  the  Project.  Where  neither  design,\nnor  planning,  nor  implementation  can  reduce  these  groups\u2019  losses,  mitigation  measures  will\nensure access to new opportunities for those who have lost out in capture fisheries. A fisheries\ndevelopment plan will be developed in a participatory manner in accordance with the Guidelines\non  Participatory  Water  Management  and  ADB\u2019s  fisheries  policy  ensuring  that  affected  people\nmaintain their original standard of living at a level at least equal to what they enjoyed prior to the\nProject. Compensation will be provided by ensuring user rights to water bodies within the project\narea for the affected poor people (priority will be given to poor fisherfolk and destitute women)\nand  by  providing  training  to  poor  fisherfolk  to  increase  the  possibility  of  accessing  alternative\nincome-generating  activities.  To  facilitate  this  process  the  Project  will  provide  assistance  to\nestablish contact with existing microfinance programs. Additionally, preference will be given to\npoor  fisherfolk  and  destitute  women  in  terms  of  access  to  working  opportunities  generated  by\nthe Project.\n\n99.\nIndigenous peoples issues are not anticipated to be significant in the Project (Appendix\n10).  However,  where  issues  related  to  indigenous  peoples  may  be  identified,  ADB\u2019s Policy on\nIndigenous Peoples (1999) will be applied.\n\n100.\nThe SSWRDSP found that women\u2019s equal participation and involvement in small-scale\nwater management projects is essential for the sustainability of subprojects. A gender strategy\nwill  be  developed  for  this  Project,30  to  ensure  that  gender  concerns  are  addressed  and  dealt\nwith  in  the  most  effective  and  efficient  manner.  The  Project  will  provide  training  (confidence\nbuilding and management skills) for women to enable them to participate in WMAs and will also\ngive specific attention to employment of female staff at all levels. Priority will be given to local\npoor  women  in  (i)  formation  of  LCSs,  (ii)  employment  opportunities  generated  by  the  Project,\nand  (iii)  O&M  work  of  the  Project.  Additionally,  all  relevant  training  activities  included  in  the\nProject will address gender concerns, and at least 30 percent of participants in training activities\nshould be women. All facilitators, community organizers, socioeconomists, assistant engineers,\nand  engineers  will  be  trained  in  gender  issues  within  the  sector,  and  special  training  will  be\nprovided for women on various aspects, such as vegetable gardening and production.\n\n101. Resettlement  and  land  acquisition  effects  are  not  anticipated  to  be  significant  in  the\nProject (Appendix 11). However, where land acquisition may be required, a land acquisition plan\nand resettlement plan will be prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement policy\nand Handbook on Resettlement  (1998), as amended from time to time.\n\n                  \n\n30  An  international  gender  specialist  and  a  national  gender  specialist  will  be  posted  at  the  PMO  to  develop  and\n\nimplement a gender strategy for the Project.\n\n\f26\n\nV.      PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA. \n\nFinancial and Economic Analyses\n\n1.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\n102. With  the  Project,  farm  financial  returns  (as  indicated  by  increased  net  cropped  income\nfor benefited farms) are expected to range from Tk4,400 to Tk6,100 per ha, a 25 to 56 percent\nincrease,  depending  on  the  subproject.  To  produce  this  additional  agricultural  output,  labor\ndemand will also increase.  Labor income (combining both wage income and returns to family\nlabor) will, on a per ha basis, be expected to rise by an additional Tk1,900 to Tk2,600.  The ratio\nof  expected  benefits  to  regular  O&M  costs  (for  which  landed  beneficiaries  are  responsible)\nranges from 12 to 1 for Abatpur to 47 to 1 for Choto Kumira.  Financial returns, in other words,\nare  such  that  farmers  can  easily  undertake  their  O&M  responsibilities  and  still  have  a  large\nincentive to adopt the more intensive crop production made possible by the Project.\n\nThe poor (including marginal farmers and smallholder households, as well as the actual\n103.\nand  functionally  landless)  are  expected  to  have  a  share  in  this  increased  income.  The  annual\nincome  per  household  (from  both  agricultural  production  and  increased  labor  usage)  of  this\ngroup  is  expected  to  rise  by  Tk3,000  to  Tk3,900  (depending  on  the  subproject).  The  share  of\ntotal  incremental  financial  benefits  going  to  the  poor  is  calculated  to  range  from  44  percent  in\nChoto  Kumira  to  62  percent  in  Purba  Sayedpur.    In  economic  terms,  in  which  the  opportunity\ncost of labor in the whole country is taken into account, the share of total incremental benefits\naccruing to the poor, however, may range only from 35 to 56 percent (with a per/ha weighted\naverage  of  39  percent);  this  more  closely  approximates  the  proportion  of  land  owned  by  the\npoor  within  their  respective  subprojects.    The  efficiency  of  the  Project  in  delivering  benefits  to\nthe poor can be calculated (also in economic terms) by taking the ratio of the present value of\nbenefits going to the poor to the present value of public investment in the four subprojects. By\nthis  measure,  the  poor  can  be  expected  to  receive  Tk1.4  in  project  benefits  for  every  taka  of\npublic investment.\n\n104. Based  on  the  analysis  of  the  sample  subprojects,  for  the  Project  as  a  whole  various\nresults can be expected: (i) rice production will increase by 180,000 tons, producing incremental\nnet crop income from rice of Tk820 million/year;  (ii) overall net crop income will rise by Tk975\nmillion (or 35 percent) in project areas; (iii) local labor demand will increase by 7.8 million days a\nyear (or about Tk420 million); (iv) about 280,000 households (1.7 million people) will benefit, at\nan average of Tk4,900/year/household; (v) beneficiaries will cover Tk47 million in regular O&M\ncosts, saving the Government (which would otherwise be responsible) $870,000 equivalent per\nyear  or  $17.4  million  over  the  20-year  life  of  the  Project.  The  incremental  benefits  of\nparticipating beneficiaries will sustain O&M costs of subprojects.\n\n2. \n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n105.\nThe  Project  is  expected  to  cover  roughly  195,000  ha  incorporated  in  about  300\nsubprojects.  Over 280,000 farm families (1.7 million people) live in this aggregated area. While\ndirect beneficiaries will be families with land, many smallholders and marginal farmers as well\nas  the  functionally  landless  will  attain  some  level  of  output  benefit.  In  addition,  increased\ncropping intensity and a shift to high-yielding crop varieties will increase labor usage and family\nwage income.\n\n\f27\n\n106. Drainage  infrastructure  can  bring  more  land  into  production  and/or  allow  land  to  be\nproductive  throughout  more  of  the  year.  Flood  management  projects  reduce  losses  from\nflooding and allow the use of high-yielding varieties on more land.  Water conservation schemes\nwill allow supplementary irrigation in addition to increasing retained soil moisture after the rainy\nseason. Command area development directly increases irrigation and leads to a shift to higher\nproductivity irrigated agriculture.\n\n107.\nFour  sample  subprojects  (Abatpur,  Choto  Kumira,  Purba  Sayedpur,  and  Sriramkandi)\nwere  studied.  The  economic  analysis  (Appendix  12)  of  these  subprojects  produced  EIRRs\nranging  from  21  to  36  percent.  Sensitivity  analyses  showed  these  results  to  be  fairly  robust.\nTests were conducted to see what would happen to returns if the rice price dropped (despite the\nWorld  Bank  projections  for  an  increase)  or  general  benefits  were  to  decrease.  Additional\nsensitivity  scenarios  included  a  possible  increase  in  the  cost  of  construction,  a  delay  in\nconstruction completion, and a decrease in subproject life (which might occur if beneficiaries do\nnot  adequately  fulfill  their  O&M  responsibilities).  While  the  subprojects  remain  economically\nviable at the tested levels of all of these items, the greatest risk to project returns would appear\nto be a substantial delay in construction completion.  A decrease in subproject life, on the other\nhand, would seem to have limited effect on returns; the minimum subproject life span of 4 to 7\nyears (compared with the 20 years assumed for the base case) would still produce an EIRR of\nat least 12 percent.\n\n108.\nThe  sample  subprojects  can  be  seen  as  reasonably  representative  of  their  types  flood\nmanagement  and  water  conservation  schemes);  these  types  comprise  83  percent  of  the  300\nexpected  subprojects  to  be  constructed.    To  get  a  picture  of  the  expected  results  for  the  full\nProject, the economic results from these sampled subprojects can be extrapolated on a per ha\nbasis.    The  overall  project  EIRR  based  on  this  method  is  19  percent  when  costs  of  the\nparticipatory  water  resource  development  component  (including  social  mobilization,  subproject\nselection,  project  management,  monitoring,  and  postconstruction  agricultural  and  fisheries\nprograms)  are  included.    If  the  costs  of  the  institutional  strengthening  component  are  also\nincluded, the EIRR becomes 17 percent.\n\nB.        Environment\n\n109.\nTraditional agricultural practice in Bangladesh includes small-scale fish farming in private\nor village-owned ponds. These ponds also serve as homes for fish stock during the dry season\nand for floodplain fisheries during the wet season. Farming of fish in rice fields is also practiced.\nA  significant  part  of  farmers\u2019  income  is  derived  from  this  source.  Because  of  these  practices\nwater  management  at  the  local  level  must  be  closely  integrated  to  ensure  that  benefits  from\nmultiple  uses  can  be  maximized.  The  technical  design  of  subprojects  aims  to  balance  these\nneeds to maximize benefits. In undertaking the economic analysis for the Project, income from\nfarming,  fishing,  and  aquaculture  sources  have  been  included.  The  cultivated  areas  of\nfloodplains  and  wetlands  also  form  important  breeding  grounds  for  natural  fish  stock  in  lakes,\nrivers, and coastal areas. Lower areas in floodplains form biodiversity sanctuaries for fish, birds,\nsmall  mammals,  insects,  and  vegetation.  These  areas  will  be  identified  in  environmental\nmanagement plans and maintained in subproject areas. Where reasonable to do so, they will be\nrehabilitated.  A  biodiversity  component \nthe  environmental  monitoring\narrangements for the Project.\n\nincluded \n\nin \n\nis \n\nThe  intensified  agricultural  and  fisheries  development  that  will  occur  as  a  result  of\n110.\nimplementing  the  Project  will  bring  with  it  increased  use  of  fertilizers  and  pesticides  with\nassociated  environmental  and  economic  risks.  The  Government  has  supported  initiatives  to\n\n\f28\n\nintroduce  integrated  pest  management  programs.  The  Project  will  continue  to  expand  the\nintroduction  of  integrated  pest  management  by  supporting  this  initiative  through  training  and\nextension services for landholders in subproject areas. The Project will support capacity building\nin LGED by providing essential equipment for monitoring water and soil quality, and training in\ncarrying  out  these  activities.  Capacity  building  will  be  provided  to  all  levels  of  LGED  staff  to\nsupport the planning and management functions to ensure sustainable use of natural resources\nby beneficiaries in subproject areas. This will also form an integral part of an expanded training\nprogram  for  O&M  personnel  in  the  WMAs  and  representatives  of  union  parishads.  The\nimportant  aim  of  this  is  to  ensure  that  the  wetlands  and  aquatic  habitats  will  be  preserved  as\nprotected fish-breeding areas.\n\nC.\n\nImpact on Poverty\n\n111.\nThe  Project  will  have  direct  positive  impacts  on  the  income  employment  opportunities\nand  the  food  security  situation  of  poor  people  in  the  subproject  areas  included  in  the  Project.\nOver  280,000  families  (1.7  million  people)  live  in  this  area.  The  Project  will  contribute  to\nimproving the rural economy by enhancing agricultural production. Drainage infrastructure can\nbring more land into production and/or allow land to be productive throughout more of the year.\nFlood management subprojects reduce losses from flooding and allow the use of high-yielding\nvarieties on more land. Water conservation schemes allow supplementary irrigation in addition\nto  increasing  retained  soil  moisture  after  the  raining  season.  Command  area  development\ndirectly increases irrigation and leads to a shift to higher productivity irrigated agriculture.\n\n112. Agricultural benefits from the subprojects are likely to accrue mainly to the landowners.\nThe  poor,  defined  as  landless,  marginal,  and  smallholders,  however,  can  also  be  expected  to\nbenefit in the with project scenario as labor income from the land area owned by the poor will\nincrease and the poor will be hired on a wage basis to cover a part of the increased labor needs\nof  medium  and  large  landholders.  In  addition,  labor  for  earthworks  and  other  project-related\nconstruction  and  maintenance  work  will  be  drawn  from  local  poor  households.  Overall,  when\ncombining crop production and labor income, the poor may attain a total of 49 percent of local\nbenefits (in financial terms) of the project in Abatpur, 44 percent in Choto Kumira, 62 percent in\nPurba Sayedpur, and 58 percent in Sriramkandi. Finally, in some subproject areas, the Project\nwill generate employment opportunities due to increased access to captured fisheries.31\n\n113.\nIn  Choto  Kumira,  853  poor  households  live  within  the  project  area  (small,  marginal\nfarmers, landless laborers, and destitute women). While distribution within this group is likely to\nbe  uneven,  the  average  incremental  annual  income  per  household  (in  financial  terms)  among\nthe  poor  is  expected  to  be  Tk3,025  per  year.  In  Purba  Sayedpur  585  poor  households  are\nexpected to benefit by Tk3,162 per year. In Abatpur and Sriramkandi subproject areas, 540 and\n254  poor  households,  respectively,  are  anticipated  to  receive  an  average  incremental  annual\nincome of Tk3,630 per year and Tk3,940 per year respectively.\n\n114.\nThe  rise  in  local  household  income  and  agricultural  production  will  result  in  improved\nwelfare for the population in subproject areas. Water conservation is likely to have multiple uses\nin  addition  to  irrigation,  namely  for  livestock  and  domestic  purposes.  Adequate  provision  of\nwater supply for domestic purposes can reduce the time spent for women collecting water, lead\nto  better  health,  and  improve  vegetable  growing.  Additionally,  SSWRDSP  subprojects  have\n\n                  \n\n31    In  five  subprojects  implemented  under  the  SSWRDSP,  4  person-months  of  employment  were  created  for  670\nindividuals benefiting close to 4,000 family members. The average daily income was around Tk75, combined with\nthe  volume  of  work  (average  4  months  per  individual),  this  had  a  considerable  poverty  reduction  impact  on  the\nfamilies concerned.\n\n\f29\n\nshown  that  the  SSWRDSP  has  had  an  impact  in  terms  of  crop  diversification.  Production  of\nsugarcane,  vegetables,  and  chilies  has  increased,  generating  employment  opportunities  for\nlandless farmers and women in harvesting, cleaning, and drying.\n\nThe  Project \n\nis  based  on  participatory  processes  during  selection,  design,\n115.\nimplementation,  and  O&M  of  subprojects.  Participatory  processes  empower  people  and  the\ninstitutions that affect their lives, to enable them to influence decisions that are made about their\ndevelopment  and  the  resources  involved.  The  Project  contributes  to  poor  beneficiaries\nmanaging  and  controlling  water  resources  that  are  essential  to  their  livelihood.  Managing  and\ncontrolling  water  resources  reduce  the  vulnerability  of  marginal  farmers  and  smallholders\nsignificantly, and thereby improves the possibility that they can move out of poverty.\n\nD.\n\nRisks\n\n116. Project risks center around areas of sustainability and project implementation capacity.\nThese risks are addressed by the Project.\n\n117. Much attention in project design has been paid to the sustainability of the subprojects to\nbe  developed.  O&M  is  to  be  the  responsibility  of  those  benefiting  most  from  a  subproject  and\nwho  are  closest  to  it.  The  WMAs  must  demonstrate  their  ability  and  intent  to  undertake  their\nO&M responsibilities by contributing an amount equivalent to 3 percent of the construction costs\nof earthworks and 1.5 percent of the cost of concrete structures, before construction can begin.\nThis  amount  is  equivalent  to  the  average  annual  amount  that  O&M  functions  are  expected  to\ncost.  During  subproject  preparation,  construction,  and  a  postconstruction  break-in  period,  a\ngreat deal of effort is to be put into preparing the beneficiaries to take over these O&M tasks.\nThe result should be WMAs that are both capable of and willing to perform their O&M tasks.\n\n118. Project  sustainability  will  be  further  assured  by  the  reorganization  of  LGED,  which  will\ncontinuously  support  small-scale  water  resources  development  activities  in  a  much  improved\nmanner.  In  addition,  an  increased  sense  of  ownership  of  subprojects  implemented  under  the\nproposed Project will contribute to improved maintenance of small-scale water resources.\n\n119. During  the  SSWRDSP,  management  capacity  has  steadily  increased  its  rate  of\nsubproject implementation.  Systems are in place and will be improved by the Project for survey\nand  data  collection,  the  feasibility  analysis  of  subprojects,  and  construction  management.  The\nmobilization of effective WMAs has been troublesome in the past. However, for the Project, an\nimproved  system  of  contracting  effective  NGOs  to  be  fully  responsible  for  community\nmobilization is planned to be in place. The Project is also designed to have substantial input into\nstrengthening  the  small-scale  water  resources  sector,  which  should  have  the  payoff  of\nimproving  implementation  of  development  activities  within  the  sector.  Disruption  of  existing\nproduction systems during the construction will be minimized because construction activities will\nbe  scheduled  in  the  dry  season  (November-May)  when  construction  will  not  disrupt  the\ncultivation of monsoon crops or increase flood risk.\n\nA.\n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nVI.

Implementation\n\n1.\nThe  objective  of  Small-Scale  Water  Resources  Development  Sector  Project\n(SSWRDSP)1 is to attain sustainable growth in agricultural production and incomes in western\nBangladesh  by  establishing  infrastructure  and  self-sustaining  institutions  for  small-scale  water\nresources  management,  covering  an  area  of  about  150,000  hectares.  As  of  March  2001,  280\nsubprojects had water management associations (WMAs) formed, 192 had initiated construction\nof infrastructure, and 52 were completed respectively. The overall implementation progress was\nestimated  at  66  percent  against  a  loan  elapsed  period  of  73  percent  of  the  project  period.  A\nproject midterm review undertaken in October 1999 noted that the project implementation was\ngenerally satisfactory, and would be completed as per original objectives and scope, although\nimprovement was required in terms of (i) increasing beneficiary participation, and (ii) improving\nthe quality of construction. These findings were also reaffirmed by reviews in May and October\n2000,  and  February  2001.  The  Government  has  been  progressively  developing  its  own\ncapacity. The loan covenants have generally been complied with.\n\nB. \n\nPreliminary Project Benefits and Poverty Impacts\n\n2.\nThe  envisaged  project  benefits  include  (i)  cereal  and  noncereal  production  by  75,000\ntons  per  annum  by  2005,  and  (ii)  incremental  employment  opportunities  of  hired  and  family\nagricultural  labor  by  2.81  million  person-days  per  annum.  According  to  the  Project\u2019s  effect\nmonitoring and evaluation system, the data collected in the completed schemes covering about\n18,000 ha indicate that targets for cereal and noncereal production are being achieved.\n\n3.\nA  preliminary  assessment  of  poverty  reduction  impacts  for  completed  representative\nsubprojects are shown in Table A3.1. The percentage of poor households among beneficiaries\nin  these  subprojects  is  higher  than  the  national  average.  These  subprojects  have  already\ngenerated substantial benefits for rural people. In terms of agriculture, production has increased\nby  30\u2013130  percent,  thereby  substantially  improving  the  food  security  for  low-income  farm\nhouseholds.  Vulnerability  to  external  shocks  such  as  floods  has  also  been  reduced  from  the\ncompleted flood protection works. These subprojects have also provided substantial incremental\nemployment  opportunities  to  the  landless,  marginal,  and  small  farm  households.  In  terms  of\nfisheries,  the  subprojects  have  also  demonstrated  strong  impacts.

Processing: Participatory rural appraisal (PRA) is\nnongovernment\nundertaken \norganizations  (NGOs),  but  its  quality  is  not  always\nappropriate.\n\ncontracted \n\nby \n\n-  Efforts should be made to ensure meaningful\n\nconsultation with all stakeholders. Mechanisms for\neffective conflict solution should be strengthened.\n\nA.  Policy-Related Issues\n\nPresent  Cooperatives  Act:  Water  management\nthe\nassociations  (WMAs)  are \nformed \ncooperatives \nrules,  which  are  administratively\ncomplex.\n\nfollowing \n\nB.  Subproject Selection and Processing\nB-1. Identification:  While  the  Project  takes  a  strong\ndemand-driven  approach,  subprojects  are  identified\nat the field level without clear strategic guidance.\n\nB-3. Feasibility  Studies:  The  standard  of  feasibility\nreports  for  subprojects  needs  improvement  including\ntheir  compliance  with  the  social  and  environmental\nguideline of the Asian Development Bank. The process\nis constrained by lack of time and resources as well as\nsupervision.\nC. Beneficiary Participation\nC-1. Formation of WMAs: WMAs are formed with the\nsupport  of  NGO  facilitators.  In  earlier  subprojects\nconstruction  was  initiated  without  sufficient  WMA\nformation.\n\nC-2. Beneficiary  contribution:  The  Project  requires\n\ncapital cost recovery.\n\n-  The administrative requirements of cooperatives\nrules need to be simplified to suit the WMAs.\n\n-  Cooperatives rules will be revised based on\npolicy dialogue. Assessment of alternative\nframework will also be pursued.\n\n-  Strategies and guidelines must be defined for\n\n-  The Local Government Engineering\n\nproject identification. Given diverse stakeholder\ninterests, selecting interventions with minimum\nconflicts should be the prime principle.\n\nDepartment (LGED) is developing district-\nlevel strategies and guidelines within 2001.\nSubproject selection criteria are also\nimproved to select subprojects with minimum\nconflicts.\n\n-  Quality of PRA has been improved by\n\nengaging more experienced NGOs, firms, or\ninstitutions.\n\n-  Sufficient time and resources should be allocated\n\n-  More detailed data collection and field\n\nfor the feasibility field survey and analysis.\n\nsurveys are mandated.\n\n4\n1\n\n-  The number of subprojects should be limited to\nensure adequate resources for ensuring quality.\n\n-  The total number of subprojects is fixed at\n300 based on the SSWRDSP experience.\n\n-  Sufficient time and motivational input should be\n\nprovided for the formation of sound WMAs.  A firm\ninstitutional basis should be established before\ninitiating the physical works.\n\n-  These procedures and arrangements were\nestablished for the SSWRDSP, and are\noperational with improved quality control\narrangements.\n\n- The approach of collecting financial contributions\nup front is sound. The fund should be used for\noperation and maintenance (O&M) activities of\nWMAs in line with National Water Policy (NWP).\n\n- This recommendation will be operational in\n\nthe proposed SSWRDSP.\n\nC-3. Environmental and Social Issues:\n\nEnvironmental mitigation plans and land acquisition\nplans are duly prepared, but their implementation\nand monitoring systems need strengthening.\n\n-  Plans to ensure quality of environmental\n\nmanagement and land acquisition should be firmly\nput in place.\n\n-  These are to be ensured during the WMA\n\ndevelopment stage through highly qualified\nNGOs/firms. More stringent internal quality\ncontrol arrangements are also applied.\n\nIdentification of affected persons and preparation of\nmitigation plan should be done during the WMA\ndevelopment stage, prior to physical works.\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n3\n\n,\n \n\np\na\ng\ne\n \n3\n\n\fKey Issues\n\nLessons Learned/Recommendations\n\nMeasures Taken in the Proposed SSWRDSP\n\nD. Water Resource Infrastructure Development\nD-1. Field data and engineering design: Available\ntopographical maps are old and of less credible\nquality.\n\nD-2. Quality of construction: Scope exists for\n\nimproving the quality of construction in particular of\nthe hydraulic structures and embankments.\n\n-  The quality of the field data needs to be ensured\n\nthrough sufficient field surveys. The design\nprocess should be carried out with beneficiary\nconsultation.\n\n-  LGED\u2019s capacity in hydraulic structures is limited\n\nand requires strengthening. LGED needs to\nestablish sound construction quality control\nsystem.\n\n-  Design specifications of maps and figures will\nbe improved. Design firms will also be given\ntraining on participatory design.\n\n-  A quality control engineer will be fielded\n\nunder technical assistance (TA).\n\n-  LGED improved internal office inspection and\n\nperformance audit.\n\nE.  O&M of Water Resource Infrastructure by WMA\n-  So far management of 30 subprojects have been\n\n-  Intensive activities to institutionalize O&M by the\n\n-  Operational in the SSWRDSP.\n\nturned over to WMAs. The sustainability of all WMAs\nestablished under the Project needs to be ensured.\n\nWMAs should be initiated at early stages of\nsubproject implementation cycle.\n\n-  Supervising completed schemes through sound\nannual technical, social, and financial audits of\nWMAs is of crucial importance.\n\n-  Operational in the SSWRDSP, but the\n\nproposed SSWRDSP will increase their focus\nas more subprojects enter the O&M stage.\n\nF. Institutions for Project Implementation\nF-1. LGED: LGED\u2019s capacities for small-scale water\nresources development are improving through\ntraining and management of subprojects, although\noperational capacities are still limited for sustainable\nwater resource interventions.\n\n-  LGED\u2019s capacity at national and local levels still\n\nneed to be strengthened particularly in integrated\nwater resource planning and scheme\nimplementation addressing nonengineering\nissues.\n\n-  These capacities will be further developed in\naccordance with the capacity development\nplan through the institutional strengthening\nactivities.\n\n4\n2\n\nF-2 Local government institutions (LGI): LGIs\n\ncapacities are not systematically strengthened. The\nunion parishad (UP) plays a role in the project\npreparation phase, but is not actively taking part at\nall stages of the project cycle.\n\n-  The role of local governments for small-scale\nwater resources schemes should be clearly\ndefined, including effective transition\narrangements and ownership transfer issues.\n\n-  A specific training package and modules should\nbe developed, especially for UP leaders/office\nbearers.\n\n-  Ministry of Local Government, Rural\n\nDevelopment and Cooperatives (MOLGRDC)\nwill define the roles of the LGIs in small-scale\nwater resources management in accordance\nwith the NWP with the assistance of TA.\n\n- Developed under the SSWRDSP.

The project area encompasses the entire country of Bangladesh from\nthe  northern  hills  through  the  southern  coast  of  the  Bay  of  Bengal.  The  main  objective  of  the\nProject \ninstitutionalization  of\nstakeholders  for  integrated  management  of  water  resources.  Enhancement  of  accessibility  for\nemployment  for  the  landless  poor  and  women  is  another  target  of  the  Project.  The  Project  is\nexpected  to  benefit  approximately  200,000  hectares  (ha)  of  land  cultivated  by  over  180,000  farm\nhouseholds.\n\nto  achieve  sustainable  agricultural  development \n\nthrough \n\nis \n\n4.\nThe  Project  will  include  approximately  300  subprojects  of  different  categories  with  a  unit\narea of 1,000 ha or less. The subproject types will be water conservation, drainage improvement,\nflood  management,  and  command  area  development.  The  major  physical  interventions  for  these\ntypes  of  subprojects  will  be  reexcavation/excavation  of  canals,  rehabilitation/construction  of\nembankments,  and  construction  of  water-regulating  structures.  The  time  frame  for  the  proposed\nProject will be 2002-2009.\n\nC.\n\nDescription of the Environment\n\nThe Environmental Profile of Bangladesh1 states that the country\u2019s environment is seriously\n5.\nthreatened  by  deforestation  (3.3  percent  of  the  forest  is  lost  per  year),  declining  soil  productivity\nand  land  degradation,  biodiversity  loss,  poor  water  management,  and  water  quality  degradation\nand  water  pollution.  The  report  also  mentions  nine  points  mainly  responsible  for  environmental\ndegradation in Bangladesh, of which, the following three are of prime concern to the Project.\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nhigh population pressure and low environmental awareness at all levels;\nimproper cropping sequences, unbalanced use of fertilizer, and pesticide misuse in\nagriculture; and\npoorly designed flood control, drainage, and irrigation works without environmental\nimpact assessment.\n\nTo  make  matters  worse,  Bangladesh  is  now  facing  a  serious  problem  due  to  pollution  of\n6.\ngroundwater  with  arsenic.  This  problem  has  spread  all  over  the  country  and  a  number  of  people\nhave been diagnosed with arsenic poisoning. A report published by the Water Resources Planning\n\n1  Asian Development Bank. 1998. Environmental Profile of Bangladesh. Policy Coordination Unit, Office of the Director,\n\n                  \n\nPrograms Department (West), Manila.\n\n\f53\n\nAppendix 9, page 2\n\nOrganization,2  states  that  the  problem  is  acute  in  tube  wells,  which  abstract  groundwater  from\ndepths  of  more  than  10  meters  and  less  than  100  meters  in  the  southeast,  south-central,  and\nsouthwest regions. Also affected, although to a lesser extent, is the eastern part of the northeast\nregion, and the very southern fringe of the north central and northwest regions along the Ganges\nRiver.  More  than  20  million  people  are  estimated  to  drink  water  exceeding  the  Bangladesh\nstandard for arsenic of 0.05 milligram/liter (mg/l) and this standard is more liberal than that of the\nWorld Health Organization guidelines that establish the tolerable level of arsenic in potable water\nat 0.01 mg/l. Thousands of cases of arsenic poisoning have been recorded with some deaths also\nbeing reported.\n\nD.\n\nChoto Kumira Khal Water Conservation Subproject\n\nThe  subproject  has  a  gross  area  of  1,290  ha  of  which  the  net  cultivable  area  is  987  ha.\n7.\nHomesteads, water bodies, roads, forest, etc. cover about 303 ha. The subproject area is located\non  the  tidal  floodplain  at  the  foot  of  the  Chandranath  Hills.  The  area  is  gently  sloping  with  land\nelevations  ranging  from  4.5  meters  (m)  along  the  highway  down  to  3.2  m  near  the  coastal\nembankment. The village platforms with their associated gardens are above 4.5  m.\n\n8.\nThe area is very prone to flash flooding from storms in the hills, and water congests in low\nareas  along  the  embankment.  However,  the  area  has  no  significant  wetlands.  The  khal3  is\nregarded as perennial, but with little base flow in the rabi4 season. It has a strong tidal flow, with\nthe  larger  tides  penetrating  to  the  highway  and  water  within  this  reach  of  the  channel  is  saline\nbetween November and April. About 75 percent of the area is used for agriculture. Because of the\nland  type,  soil  characteristics,  and  water  available  for  irrigation,  the  area  is  dominated  by  rice\ncropping. Double cropping is practiced on most of the land. A large portion of this double-cropped\nland  consists  of  local  variety  broadcast  aus5  followed  by  local  variety  and  high-yielding  variety\ntransplant aman.6 The present cropping intensity is 186 percent.\n\nThe  area  has  little  wildlife.  Wildlife  comprises  mainly  coastal  bird  species,  reptiles,  and\n9.\namphibians endemic to the area. The aquatic habitat is limited to Choto Kumira khal. The mudflats\noutside  the  embankment  have  been  planted  to  mangroves.  The  area  is  one  segment  of  a  long\nidentical coastal plain and has no special ecological features.\n\n10.\nThe  population  density  is  600  per  square  kilometer,  which  is  much  less  than  the  national\naverage of 850. The area is accessible by village roads from a number of points on the highway to\nSayedpur  Ghat  and  the  embankment.  Sayedpur  has  one  bridge,  the  remainder  are  footbridges.\nThe khal can no longer be used for navigation. One growth center is located on the highway. The\nsubproject area has no items of cultural or heritage significance in the area.\n\nE.\n\nPurba Sayedpur Drainage, Irrigation, and Water Conservation Subproject\n\n11.\nThe gross area of the subproject is 892 ha of which the net cultivated area is about 565 ha.\nThe homesteads, homestead gardens, water bodies, roads, forest, etc. cover about 327 ha of the\ntotal area of the subproject. The subproject area includes mostly highland (F0 i.e., 0-30 cm flood\ndepth)  and  medium  low  (F1  i.e.,  30-90  cm  flood  depth)  type  of  land,  which  covers  565  ha  of\nagricultural  land.  The  terrain  is  flat  and  surrounded  by  dendretic  channels  of  the  Lower  Meghna\n\n2  Water Resources Planning Organization. 1999.

Kochua khal and beel7 are located in the central part to the area. Both water bodies are\naffected  by  tidal  flow  and  also  by  flooding  from  upstream.  Large  numbers  of  coconut,  date  palm,\nand  betel  nut  trees  are  found  around  the  homesteads  and  native  forest  remains  on  the  higher\nground in the south. Trees and homestead platforms surround the central beel and cover about 30\npercent of the gross area forming refuges and corridors for wildlife. The agricultural landscape and\nbeel are treeless. The area has no special ecological features distinct from the surrounding district.\n\n12.\n\nThe environment has been considerably modified by human activity:\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\nthe area is now protected from tidal surge by the Rahmatkhali khal regulator,\nthe  open  water  fishery  has  been  depleted  by  overexploitation  and  obstruction  to\nspawning migration,\nKochua khal is largely an artificial borrowpit excavated to construct a road,\nthe khal is pumped out annually to irrigate the boro8 crop,\nthe beel wetland has been drained by a network of canals, and\nnative forest has been cleared for rice fields from 60 percent of the area.\n\n13.\nThis notwithstanding, the landscape is very attractive, and does not appear to be suffering\nfrom  any  environmental  problems.  Because  of  the  land  type,  soils,  and  availability  of  irrigation\nwater, rice crops dominate the subproject area. Double cropping, which covers about 378 ha of net\ncultivated area, is practiced on most of the land and single cropping occurs on about 26 ha of land.\nA  large  portion  of  this  double-cropped  area  consists  of  high-yielding  variety  boro  followed  by\ntransplanted  aman  (both  local  and  high-yielding  varieties).  Present  cropping  intensity  is  139\npercent.\n\n14.\nWithin  the  community,  64  percent  of  the  households  depend  directly  on  farming.  About  12\npercent of these households are landless people and depend on farm employment. The remaining 36\npercent of the households have other occupations as their major source of income. However, at least\n15 percent of these including entrepreneurs, fisherfolk, unemployed, and some women are indirectly\ndependent  on  farming.  Unemployment  is  a  problem,  particularly  among  the  younger  people  and\nwomen.  About  25  percent  of  the  labor  force  is  working  in  towns  or  out  of  the  country.  Among  the\nfarmers, the average landholding is 0.66 ha. However, large- and medium-size landholders own 45\npercent of the land.  For half of this group, farming is not their primary occupation. Twenty-two percent\nof  the  land  is  owned  by  the  nonfarming  sector.  Marginal  farmers  and  landless,  who  comprise  45\npercent of the area population own 15 percent of the land.\n\nF.\n\nSriramkandi Flood Management Drainage and Irrigation Subproject\n\n15.\nThe gross area of the subproject is 333 ha, including 38 ha of noncultivated highland occupied\nby  homesteads,  275  ha  of  net  area,  and  20  ha  of  noncultivated  permanent  water  bodies.  The  land\nelevations range from 5 m to 7 m with highland located mostly in the northern half of the area near the\nriver. The mean annual rainfall is 1,878 mm and the mean monsoon flood level is 6.75 m. This causes\ninundation  of  extensive  areas  on  both  sides  of  the  river.  The  riverine  environment  surrounding  the\nsubproject  has  been  extensively  influenced  by  flood  control,  irrigation,  and  river  improvement\ninterventions. The subproject area includes mostly medium low (F2) land, which includes 245 ha of\nagricultural land. The major crops grown in the area are transplanted aman, boro, pulses, sugar cane,\noil  seeds,  and  jute.  The  present  cropping  intensity  is  170  percent.  The  project  area  has  been\nextensively cleared for agriculture, which covers 80 percent of the landscape. Life in the area is still\ndominated by flooding.  Floods exceeding 6.75 m can occur at any time between July and October.\nFlooding  of  the  lower  land  is  much  more  frequent  and  can  occur  between  June  and  October.

There  are\ncontinuous  stands  of  riparian  vegetation  along  both  streams,  and  remnant  patches  throughout  the\nnorthern  embankments.  The  village  platforms  with  their  associated  gardens  are  located  against  the\nriver  in  this  northern  half  providing  a  forested  perimeter.  The  southern  polder  is  largely  treeless\nagricultural land, with an extensive swamp in the southern corner. The area is one part of an extensive\nfloodplain and has no special ecological features. The aquatic habitat is extensive but badly damaged.\nIt has the full range of habitats with the two rivers, the internal khal, the seasonal beels, the floodplain,\nand an estimated 20 ha of village ponds. Few fish exist in the rivers, and as a result all of the river\nfisherfolk have moved on.\n\n16.\nThe population of the subproject area is estimated at about 2,800 with a population density of\n850  persons  per  square  kilometer.  About  470  families  live  in  five  villages.  The  Noapara\u2013Modhukali\nroad,  and  the  Bhatiapara  railway  are  located  on  either  side  of  the  project  area,  the  later  forming  a\nflood refuge.  A metal road from Noapara comes within 1 kilometer of the area. It enters the area as a\ngravel road via a concrete bridge over the Chandana River and runs on the embankment across the\ncenter  of  the  area  to  Bhimpur  Bazar.  Bhimpur  Bazar  has  a  growth  center  but  no  industries.  The\nsubproject area has no apparent items of cultural or heritage significance.\n\nG. \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n\n1.\n\nChoto Kumira Khal Water Conservation Subproject\n\n17.\nThe  proposed  construction  of  a  2.7  meter  diameter  rubber  dam  across  the  Choto  Kumira\nkhal  will  serve  a  net  area  of  up  to  957  ha  for  rice  and  vegetables  cultivation  with  dry  season\nirrigation. The estimated storage volume is 163 000 m3. The expected benefits are an increase in\nannual  production  by  20  percent  (Tk7,018,000).  Saline  intrusion  in  the  dry  season  will  be\nprevented upstream of the dam. Downstream, the brackish section of the khal will not be affected\nas no brackish nursery zone or mangrove plants exist within the boundary. Choto Kumira khal will\nbecome a more permanent pool in the dry season. This occurs now with the construction of mud\nbunds,  so  is  not  expected  to  significantly  affect  the  water  quality  and  other  components  of  the\naquatic  environment.  Reduction  of  the  salinity  level  may  improve  the  present  water  quality\ncondition.  Baseline  water  quality  data  will  be  established  as  part  of  the  design  process  for  the\nsubproject and water quality will be monitored on a regular basis. Construction of the dam will raise\nthe water level in the pools of the khal by a minimum additional depth of 0.3 m. This will create a\ncongenial environment for fish. Some seasonal siltation may exist at the khal head, but this will be\nminimal as the dam is only inflated in times of low flow during the dry season.\n\n18.\nThe operation of the rubber dam proposed for Choto Kumira khal will be operated to take\nadvantage  of  the  annual  cycle  of  movement  and  breeding  of  fish  and  prawns.  Agricultural\nproduction is expected to increase significantly by 1,150 tons, including 685 tons of rice and 460\ntons of vegetables. This amounts to 90 kilograms (kg) of vegetables per person living in the area.\nThe  improved  food  supply  will  potentially  be  reflected  in  better  nutritional  status,  health,  and\ngeneral well-being of the community. Employment in farming is expected to increase by 21 percent\nmainly as the result of increased vegetable production specially beans. On the other hand, use of\nchemical fertilizer and pesticide will increase. This will impose a negative impact on agricultural soil\nquality and water quality in the khal as well. Application of integrated pest management techniques\ncould  mitigate  these  adverse  impacts  in  the  agricultural  fields.  Soil  analysis  and  soil  fertility  level\ndetermination in the crop fields could better manage the soil resources without further degradation.\n\n19.\nThe fish population of the khal has been significantly reduced by existing embankments and\nregulators,  the  current  use  of  mud  bunds  and  extreme  fishing  pressure,  particularly  around  the\nstructures and in drainage ditches. Inflation of the rubber dam during the lean period is unlikely to\n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 9, page 5\n\naffect  fish  breeding.  Provision  has  been  made  for  a  bypass  to  provide  environmental  flows  if\nrequired.\n\n2.\n\nPurba Sayedpur Drainage Improvement and Water Conservation Subproject\n\n20.\nThe proposed construction of a 9 m wide x 2.6 m high automatic gate on Kochua khal at\nPurba Sayedpur will retain an estimated 700,000 cubic m of water for irrigation and improve flood\nsecurity.  It  will  facilitate  cultivation  of  irrigated  boro,  wheat,  winter  crops,  and  fish  culture.  During\npremonsoon  rainfall,  Kochua  beel  will  be  unaffected,  as  the  gate  will  open  automatically  if  up-\nstream  levels  exceed  2.8  m  and  the  tide  level  is  lower.  This  level  is  lower  than  the  land  level  of\nKochua  beel.  Drainage  from  the  beel  will  also  be  unaffected.  So,  mostly  there  will  be  no  impact.\nTidal flooding on the other hand will be reduced, as the smaller tides up to 3.8 m will be excluded.\nThis level is exceeded in 17 percent (1 in 5) of years and the highest level reached is 4.4 m. The\ngate  chosen  has  been  designed  specifically  to  meet  environmental  concerns,  including  ensuring\nfish passage in the Zandvlei estuary in South Africa and is considered the most suitable available.\nThe operation of the gate could be refined in the final design if required. Gate operation will be set\nto  take  advantage  of  the  annual  cycle  of  movement  and  breeding  of  fish  and  prawns.  The\noperation is detailed in the IEE of the subproject. The automatic gate has been considered more\nlikely to allow fish access than the possible alternative structures, such a regulator. The timing and\nfrequency  of  openings  is  likely  to  be  more  suited  to  fish  movement  and  the  larger  opening  and\nlower velocity flow should allow fish to pass. The Project will not result in a reduction of agricultural\nland,  but  it  may  allow  cultivation  to  extend  further  into  the  beel.  This  will  depend  on  water  level\nbehavior once the more frequent tidal flooding is removed.\n\nFarm  outputs  are  expected  to  increase  by  27  percent  (Tk9,313,000)  and  employment  in\n21.\nfarming  should  increase  by  66,930  person-days  worth  Tk37,50,000.  Use  of  chemical  fertilizer  and\npesticides will increase. Consequently, the soil of agricultural lands may be degraded. Application\nof integrated pest management techniques can mitigate this impact. Soil analysis and soil fertility\nlevel determination in the crop fields can protect the lands from degradation effects. It is not likely\nto  have  any  adverse  impact  on  open  water  fisheries.  Rather,  introduction  of  rice-fish  culture  is\nexpected to increase floodplain fish production.\n\n3.\n\nSriramkandi Flood Management and Drainage Improvement Subproject\n\n22.\nThe proposed resectioning and completion of the embankments with sluice will exclude all\nbut  the  most  severe  floods  and allow drainage when river levels permit. This will have a positive\nimpact on agriculture by protecting the boro crop and aus crops from premonsoon floods and allow\na  good  start  to  the  aman  crop.  In  line  with  agricultural  crop  production,  use  of  chemical  fertilizer\nand  pesticide  will  also  increase.  Application  of  integrated  pest  management  in  crop  fields,  and\nagricultural land management through soil analysis and soil fertility level determination, will mitigate\nthe possible impacts of soil quality degradation and water quality deterioration.\n\n23.\nThe  floodplain  in  the  subproject  area  may  be  affected  significantly.  The  northern  wetland\nwill  be  maintained  by  internal  run-off  unless  the  drainage  is  improved,  however  it  will  become\nseasonal  and  be  smaller  in  size.  The  khal  is  still  likely  to  have  some  permanent  water.  The\nsouthern  wetland  is  expected  to  drain  completely  once  the  entrance  khal  is  built  and  the  area  is\nused for increased agricultural production.\n\n24.\nThe riverine fishery is already badly damaged and may not suffer a measurable loss from\nso small a project. However, the loss of the floodplain fishery is likely to impact both on the species\navailable  in  the  area  and  the  fish  biomass.  Those  who  catch  fish  and  those  who  depend  on  the\nopen  water  fishery  to  supplement  their  diet  will  share  this  fishery  impact.  The  floodplain  fish  loss\ncan be compensated by introducing aquaculture practice in the area. An increase in the yield per\n\n\f57\n\nAppendix 9, page 6\n\nha of the 20 ha pond area from existing 1,200 kg to 2,050 kg is quite possible following the modern\nproduction technology.\n\n25.\nThe floodplain fish loss can be reduced to a minimum by allowing entry of fish/prawn seeds,\njuveniles, and young through the regulator gate. This will require opening of the gate intermittently\nat the onset of flood and during monsoon. The frequency and duration of gate opening at the peak\nperiod of breeding (mid July) will be increased.\n\nH. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program\n\n26.\nSubproject  beneficiaries  are  the  caretakers  of  their  local  resources  and  they  will  be  the\nultimate  manager  of  water  control  structures.  Thus,  they  must  understand  the  sustainable  use  of\nnatural resources, be able to manage them properly, and operate the structures in a planned and\nresponsible  way.  So,  an  extensive  general  awareness  training  program  needs  to  be  conducted\ninitially  to  make  them  understand  the  human  role  in  changing  the  environment,  measures  for\nprotection  and  conservation  of  the  environment,  environmental  legislation,  best  use  of  water\nresources  with  maintenance  of  water  quality  standards,  etc.  In  the  second  stage,  a  training  of\ntrainers  course  needs  to  be  held  with  the  most  competent  attendees  of  the  general  awareness\ntraining  program.  The  prepared  trainers  are  expected  to  organize  and  continue  the  future\nawareness  training  program  in  their  own  locality.  This  concept  is  working  well  in  the  ongoing\nthe  ongoing  Small-Scale  Water  Resources  Development  Sector  Project\nsubprojects  of \n(SSWRDSP).\n\n27.\nTo  mitigate  adverse  impacts  arising  from  increased  pesticide  use,  a  total  of  62  integrated\npest  management  field  farmers  schools  (FFS)  have  been  established  in  59  subprojects  of  the\nSSWRDSP; 1,240 farmers have received training. These farmers subsequently worked with 3,879\nother  farmers  to  encourage  them  to  adopt  the  technology.  To  protect  against  any  kind  of\nenvironmental degradation as well as to encourage economical fertilizer use, a soil health card has\nbeen  introduced  among  300  farmers  who  are  now  fixing  fertilizer  doses  themselves  according  to\nsoil requirements in their croplands.  In the fisheries sector, a new concept for simultaneous use of\ninundated floodplains to cultivate two crops: rice and fish together has been introduced. This has\nresulted  in  partial  compensation  for  floodplain  natural  fish  loss,  economic  benefit  to  the  farmers,\nand maintenance of communal harmony between agricultural crop producers and fish farmers. All\nthese  activities  need  to  give  due  attention  during  planning  phase  for  environmentally  sustainable\ninstitutional capacity building of the beneficiaries of the proposed Project.\n\nThe  Local  Government  Engineering  Department  (LGED)  has  two  environmentalists  in  the\n28.\nproject  management  office,  one  environmental  specialist  and  one  environmental  laboratory\nspecialist  with  the  advisory  technical  assistance.  Three  laboratory  facilitators  and  11  laboratory\nassistants  are  located  in  the  LGED  district  laboratories.  LGED  has  established  three  regional\nenvironmental laboratories with additional facilities and sophisticated instrumental set up at Barisal,\nKhulna,  and  Rangpur,  and  11  greater  district  laboratories  in  the  western  half  of  Bangladesh\nequipped  with  water  test  kits  usable  in  the  field.  These  laboratories  are  in  operation  for  the\nSSWRDSP\u2019s  water  quality  monitoring  activities  in  selected  subprojects.  The  same  kind  of\nlaboratory is to be set up in the eastern part of the country for the same monitoring purposes. Most\nimportantly,  LGED  does  not  have  enough  qualified  technical  personnel  to  handle  and  operate\nthese  instruments  to  conduct  analytical  works  in  such  laboratories.  To  develop  the  in-house\ntechnical  capability  of  LGED\u2019s  laboratory  staff,  training  on  environmental  laboratory  and  water\nquality  testing  is  ongoing,  and  a  similar  program  needs  to  be  designed  for  the  proposed  Project\nwith recruitment of additional technical human resources.\n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 9, page 7\n\nI. \n\nFindings and Recommendations\n\n29.\nThe water conservation and drainage improvement type of subprojects are likely to have no\ndirect  negative  environmental  consequences.  These  subprojects  are  expected  to  benefit  the\nagriculture sector by extending dry season irrigation facility in highland areas and quick drainage of\ntidal water in coastal areas. The water conservation subprojects are also expected to have positive\nimpact  on  fisheries  production  in  the  khals.  An  indirect  negative  impact  is  likely  in  water\nconservation  and  drainage  improvement  types  of  subprojects  as  the  result  of  increased  use  of\nthe\nagro-chemicals.  To  mitigate \nestablishment  of  field  farmers  schools  will  be  necessary.  Moreover,  farmers  will  be  required  to\nassist  and  support  agricultural  land  and  soil  management.  The  flood  management  type  of\nsubprojects  may  have  little  adverse  environmental  impact  for  floodplain  fisheries  production.  But\nthis can be partially mitigated by proper design and structure operation, for example, construction\nof  submersible  embankments,  and  timely  operation  of  sluice  gates.  The  fisherfolk  in  flood\nmanagement subprojects will be partially affected by the impact on floodplain fish. This impact can\nbe  compensated  by  imparting  training  to  the  fishers  on  rice-fish  culture  on  floodplains.  Fish\ncultivators  can  also  benefit  from  the  same  training.  If  properly  adopted  then  the  floodplain  fish\nproduction  loss  can  easily  be  overcome  through  rice-fish  culture  as  well  as  alternative  fish\nproduction in ponds.\n\nintegrated  pest  management \n\ntraining  with \n\nimpact \n\nthis \n\nThe experiences from the ongoing SSWRDSP show that all the subprojects including those\n30.\nof  the  command  area  development  type  have  positive  impact  on  quality  of  life  values.  The\nproposed Project can therefore be recommended with appropriate mitigation measures, monitoring\nrequirements, compensatory plan, and other components of the environmental management plan\nas summarized here:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nintegrated  pest  management  training  for  the  farmers  and  establishment  of  field\nfarmers  integrated  pest  management  schools  to  mitigate  the  adverse  impact  of\nchemical fertilizer and pesticides use;\nestablishment  of  an  environmental  laboratory  to  strengthen  LGED\u2019s  institutional\ncapability;\nwater  quality  impact  monitoring  to  verify  any  long-term  impact  on  fresh  water\necology;\nsoil  analysis  and  soil  fertility  level  examination  to  assist  farmers  in  determining\nfertilizer  mixes  and  applications,  and  to  verify  any  long-term  effect  on  soil  quality\ndegradation;\nbiodiversity impact monitoring to verify any long-term impact on aquatic habitat and\nwetland species diversity;\nenvironmental education and training for raising awareness among the stakeholders\non sustainable use of local resources; and\nfish  production  training  to  compensate  for  the  partial  loss  of  floodplain  fish\nproduction and to introduce modern aquaculture technology in khals and ponds.\n\nJ. \n\nConclusions\n\n31.\nThe SSWRDSP II is environmentally feasible and can be implemented provided that all the\nenvironmental issues discussed here are taken into account and the respective measures are put\nin place within the scheduled time frame and with proper allocation of fund as in the environmental\nmanagement plan. A full-scale environmental impact assessment is not required at this stage.\n\n\f59\n\nAppendix 10, page 1\n\nSOCIAL DIMENSIONS AND POVERTY ASSESSMENT\n\nA. \n\nPoverty and Social Characteristics\n\nBangladesh has made notable progress in income-poverty reduction since the 1970s. At\n1.\nthe national, poverty has declined from 70.6 percent to 46.5 percent, and the percentage of rural\npeople  living  below  the  poverty  line  declined  from  71  percent  in  1973/74  to  51  percent  in\n1995/96.1  The  human  poverty  index  (HPI),  which  captures  human  deprivations  in  longevity,\nknowledge,  and  economic  provisioning,  also  shows  that  incidence  of  human  poverty  has\ndeclined  from  61.3  percent  in  1981-1983  to  47.2  percent  in  1993-1994  and  to  40.1  percent  in\n1995-1997.2  However,  inequality  in  income  distribution  has  worsened  since  the  early  1990s,\nrising from 35 percent in 1983/84 to 38.4 percent in 1995/96.\n\n2.\nPoverty in rural Bangladesh is multifaceted. It is reflected in low standards of living, poor\nhealth, lack of education, abandonment of women and children, and vulnerability of most rural\nhouseholds to natural and manmade disasters. The basic causes of poverty are lack of access\nto productive resources (mainly water and land), to public resources such as health provisions,\neducation, and transport and to particular employment. Lack of social and governmental safety-\nnet entitlements makes the land-poor and landless particular vulnerable. The large and medium-\nsize  landholders  have  access  to  credit  and  other  necessary  agricultural  input.  Their  access  to\ncash  has  allowed  many  of  them  to  diversify  into  nonfarm  activities  and  act  as  local\nmoneylenders, often a very lucrative business. This, combined with their status as landlords and\npolitical connections, has secured them a comfortable position in rural society. However, even\nwithin the social group of medium-size landholders, about 25 percent live below the poverty line\n(footnote 1).\n\n3.\nRural poverty is very much related to land. The incidence of poverty in the category of\nlandless (less than 0.2 hectares (ha) of land) is as high as 64 percent compared with only 16\npercent  recorded  for  large  landowners  (owning  more  than  2  ha).3  The  incidence  of  poverty  is\nconsiderable among marginal farmers as well; 44 percent of this group lives below the poverty\nline, and among small landholders, 34 percent live below the poverty line.\n\nRural households are often involved in a bundle of income-generating and cash-saving\n4.\nactivities.  A  household  may  be  farming  some  of  its  land,  leasing  in  a  plot  from  someone  else\nwhile at the same time leasing out one or more of its own plots. One or more members of the\nhousehold may work off and on as a day laborer. Others may move off to towns and cities to\nseek  employment.  Homestead  land  is  often  used  to  produce  vegetables,  fruits,  poultry,  and\nlivestock. Traditionally fisheries are a major part of rural livelihood strategies. The many rivers,\nkhals, boars, haors, ponds, etc., are ideal for fish production. Fisheries for subsistence use are\nwidespread  among  all  categories  of  rural  households.  However,  fish  stock  has  been  limited\nsignificantly  over  the  last  decades.  The  scope  for  aquaculture  seems  considerable,  although\npartly restricted by multiple ownership of water bodies.4\n\nThe  four  subproject  areas,  Abatpur,  Choto  Kumira,  Purba  Sayedpur,  and  Sriramkandi,\n5.\nare dominated by a rural economy, on average 80 percent of the households in the areas are\n\n                  \n\n1  Sen, Binayak, 2000. Bangladesh Poverty Analysis: Trends, Policies and Institutions. Prepared with financial\n\nsupport from ADB.\n\n2  HPI substantially varies at district level, HPI of 17 districts out of 64 total districts are higher than 40.1.\n3 The  categorization  of  farmers  is  based  on  following  definition:  marginal  farmers  own  between  0.2-0.5  ha,\n\nsmallholders 0.5-1 ha, medium-size landholders 1-2 ha, and large landholders more than 2 ha.\n\n4 In some places, flood protection has enhanced the scope for aquaculture by protecting ponds from flooding.\n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\ndependent on or involved in farming. A significant feature in the subprojects is the high number\nof small and marginal farmers, and unequal distribution of land. In Abatpur and Purba Sayedpur,\nlarge and medium-size landholders (44 percent and 33 percent of all farmers) own 44 percent\nand  63  percent  of  the  total  arable  land  in  the  two  subproject  areas.  Marginal  and  landless\nfarmers (44 percent), on the other hand, own only 15 percent in Purba Sayedpur and 17 percent\nin Abatpur. Figures on cultivated land per household indicate that marginal and landless farmers\ngain access to and cultivate on average 20 percent of the total arable land in subproject areas.\nEven  though  sharecropping  is  mainly  found  among  landless,  small  and  medium-size\nlandholders  may  also  work  as  sharecroppers.  The  most  common  system  of  share  cropping  is\nthat  the  sharecroppers  and  the  landowners  share  the  benefits  gained  from  agricultural\nproduction (50/50). Exact figures on the prevalence of sharecroppers in the project areas is not\navailable;  however,  the  majority  of  sharecroppers  are  likely  among  the  landless  and  marginal\nfarmers. In addition, to sharecropping, landless farmers supplement their income through fishery\nand vegetable growing. In Choto Kumira, the landless owned on average 0.08 ha of pond and\nhomestead land.\n\nThe  occupational  distribution  within  the  agriculture  sector  also  reflects  the  unequal\n6.\ndistribution of land. On average, 40 percent of household heads farm their own land, 30 percent\nare sharecroppers, and 10 percent depend on farm labor. The remaining 20 percent depend on\njobs such as rickshaw-pulling, daily labor, fishing, trade, and business. Women are employed in\ndomestic  duties,  harvest  works,  and  cottage  industries.  Poor  women  collect  fuel  and  work  as\nwage laborers. Destitute women reported earth work and domestic labor as the main sources of\nincome.\n\nThe majority of the male population in the four subproject areas are engaged in full-time\n7.\nemployment (between 65-76 percent), and 25 percent of the male population are inadequately\nemployed.5  Studies  indicate  that  the  groups  most  affected  by  unemployment  are  youths,  day\nand agricultural laborers, small holders, sharecroppers, and destitute women. Destitute women\nreported having 4 months of unemployment during the monsoon period.\n\n8.\nAccording to the detailed poverty study in the four subproject areas, the annual income\nper  household  is  Tk27,900  for  landless  and  Tk24,600  for  marginal  farmers.  Medium-size\nlandholders  have  an  annual  income  on  Tk77,500.  The  average  income  of  destitute  women  is\napproximately  Tk15,000,  and  household  expenses  are  managed  within  this  income.  On\naverage,  75  percent  of  spending  is  on  food.  The  per  capita  income  adopted  for  moderate\npoverty is Tk6,000 and for extreme poverty Tk5,000.6 Based on a household population of six,\nthe group of landless and marginal farmers falls below the extreme poverty line.\n\n                  \n\n5 They are employed less than 10 hours a day.\n6 Local Government Engineering Department. 1999.

The  community  groups\nexpectations of the benefits and impacts of the Project are (i) increased income opportunities,8\n(ii)  development  of  road  and  water  communication,  (iii)  increase  in  the  value  of  mortgaged\nagricultural  land  by  between  15-25  percent  per  hectare,  (iv)  increase  fish  production,  and  (v)\nmore  opportunities  for  disadvantaged  groups  to  become  involved  in  farming.  All  women\ninterviewed  expected  to  benefit  from  the  Project  mainly  through  employment  opportunities,\nbetter  pay,  and  general  improved  socioeconomic  conditions  through  postharvest  work  and\nearthwork in particular.\n\nB. \n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n1.\n\nVulnerable Groups - Fisherfolk\n\n10. Where  neither  design,  nor  planning,  nor  implementation  can  reduce  fishery  losses,\nmitigation measures can often do so. Most often these measures will focus on culture (instead\nof  capture)  fisheries.  Ensuring  not  only  an  increase  in  production,  but  also  accesses  to  new\nopportunities for those who have lost out capture fisheries is essential. To compensate fisherfolk\nfor  their  losses  (if  any)  and  ensure  that  they  are  not  worse  off  due  to  the  Project,  fisheries\ndevelopment  plans  will  be  developed  in  a  participatory  manner  in  accordance  with  Guidelines\non  Participatory  Water  Management  and  ADB\u2019S  fisheries  development  plans  prior  to  the\nconclusion  of  implementation  agreements.  The  funding  of  fisheries  development  plans  will  be\nunderpinned  with  Government  counterpart  funds  and  charges,  fees,  and  dues  collected  for\nservices and facilities by WMA.\n\n2.\n\nIndigenous People\n\n11.\nIn Bangladesh, 20 ethnic minority groups are recognized, they are mostly found in plans\nor  hills  of  Chittagong  Hill  tracts.  As  the  Project  does  not  include  Chittagong  Hill  tracts,\n\n                  \n\n7  See financial and economic analysis, Appendix 12 of the RRP.\n8  In  regard  to  the  increased  possibilities  for  income-generating  activities,  construction/earth  work  was  mentioned,\n\nrickshaw-pulling, increased fish production, and more possibilities for sharecropping.\n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 10, page 4\n\nindigenous peoples issues are not anticipated to be significant in the Project. However, where\nindigenous peoples may be affected by subprojects, ADB\u2019S Policy on Indigenous People will be\napplied.\n\n3.\n\nResettlement and Land Acquisition\n\nResettlement  and  land  acquisition  effects  are  not  anticipated  to  be  significant  for  the\n12.\nProject.  However, \nimportance  ADB  places  on  careful  and  effective\nimplementation,  a  land  acquisition  and  compensation  plan  will  be  prepared  based  on  ADB\nguidelines. A summary resettlement plan is in Appendix 11.\n\nreflecting \n\nthe \n\n4.\n\nParticipatory Development\n\n13.\nThe  Project  is  driven  by  the  needs  and  demands  of  the  communities  that  recognize\nwater  management  as  important  to  realize  the  productive  potential  of  their  land  and  captured\nfisheries.  Subproject  selection  is  based  on  participatory  consultations  at  the  village  level  in\nconjunction  with  the  district  level  administration  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs).\nThese stakeholders will also be involved in project preparation, implementation, and monitoring\nand  evaluation.  Women  will  have  an  equal  opportunity  to  participate  in  project  activities,  and\nthey will be adequately represented in training and other project activities.\n\n5.\n\nGender Issues\n\n14.\nThe  issues  of  gender  in  the  water  sector  do  not  simply  involve  access  to  water.  They\ninvolve questions of rights, responsibilities, and participation at all levels. When women do not\nget the opportunity to participate in water management, they are simultaneously delinked from\nthe urgent effort to protect these vital natural resources.\n\nThe Project will provide training (confidence building and management skills) for women\n15.\nto enable them to participate in the water management association 1/3 of the members should\nbe women, and will also give specific attention to employment of female staff at all levels. The\nProject will give priority to local poor women in (i) formation of the local contracting society, (ii)\nemployment opportunities generated by the Project (tree planting, embankment work, etc.), and\n(iii) in operation and maintenance work of the Project. Additionally, all relevant training activities\nincluded in the Project will address gender concerns, and at least 30 percent of participants in\ntraining  activities  should  be  women.  This  includes  training  of  Local  Government  Engineering\nDepartment  staff  and  water  management  association  members.  All  facilitators,  community\norganizers, socioeconomists, assistant engineers, and upazila engineers will be trained on the\nimportance of women\u2019s involvement in the Project. Special training will be provided for women-\nonly  on  various  aspects,  such  as  homestead,  vegetable  gardening,  duck  rearing  on  on-farm\nincome-generating activities, and seed and vegetable production.\n\n16.\nGender-specific  monitoring  indicators  will  be  identified  and  gender-relevant  information\nwill  be  documented.  An  international  and  national  gender  expert  will  be  posted  in  the  project\nmanagement  office.  The  gender  experts  will  among  other  things  develop  and  implement  a\ngender strategy for the Project.\n\nC.\n\nExpected Social and Poverty Impact of the Project\n\n17. While  the  Project  will  not  address  core  poverty  interventions,  positive  and  significant\nimpacts  on  poverty  reduction  in  project  areas  are  expected.  Direct  benefits  are  expected\n\n\f63\n\nAppendix 10, page 5\n\nthrough increased household income in subproject areas both by the incremental net value of\nagricultural production, as well as by the returns to the labor that is involved in that incremental\nproduction.  The  increase  in  water  supply  at  critical  times  of  the  year  for  irrigation  projects  is\nexpected  to  allow  for  increased  high  yield  variety  rice  production  as  well  as  additional  crops.\nTemporary  employment  opportunities  will  be  generated  through  construction  work  during\nsubproject implementation. Table A10.2 gives a summary of the expected poverty impact of the\nProject.\n\nOverall  when  combining  crop  production  and  labor  income,  the  poor  may  attain  49\n18.\npercent, 45 percent, 63 percent, and 58 percent of the full local financial benefits of the Project\nin Abatpur, Choto Kumira, Purba Sayedpur, and Sriramkandi, respectively.9 On an annual basis\nthe  average  incremental  increase  in  household  income  among  the  poor  is  expected  to  be\nTk3,900.00, Tk3,900.00, Tk3,160.00, and Tk3,000.00.\n\n19.\nIn  addition,  to  the  benefits  mentioned,  indirect  or  secondary  employment  opportunities\nare  expected  to  increase  due  to  rise  in  agricultural  production.  The  rise  in  local  household\nincome  and  food  production  will  result  in  an  improved  status  of  nutrition  and  welfare  for  the\nsubproject population. Water conservation by Projects is likely to have multiple uses in addition\nto  irrigation,  namely  for  livestock  and  domestic  purposes.  The  subprojects  in  Abatpur  and\nSriramkandi also provide opportunities for increased income from fisheries, through construction\nof ponds.\n\n20.\nAgricultural production benefits are likely to accrue almost entirely to the owners of the\nland.  While  the  poor  (defined  as  small  and  marginal  farmers,  in  addition  to  the  actual  and\nfunctionally  landless)10  own  only  on  average  less  than  half  of  the  total  arable  land  in  the\nbenefited  areas,  they  can  also  be  expected  to  benefit  from  increased  labor  income  resulting\nfrom  the  subproject  crop  production.  In  addition,  labor  for  earthworks  involved  in  project\nconstruction is likely to be drawn from local poor households.\n\n21.\nThe efficiency of the Project in delivering benefits to the poor can be calculated by taking\nthe  ratio  of  the  present  value  of  benefits  going  to  the  poor  to  the  present  value  of  public\ninvestment  in  the  four  subprojects.  By  this  measure  it  can  be  noted  that  the  poor  can  be\nexpected to receive Tk1.4 in project benefits for every taka of public investment.\n\n                  \n\n9  See the financial and economic analyses of the Project for more detailed information.\n10 The poor own 32 percent of the net benefited area in Choto Kumira subproject, 54 percent in Purba Sayedpur\n\nsubproject, 32.5 percent in Abatpur, and 43 percent in Sriramkandi.\n\n\f64\n\n987\n853\n\n44.3\n\n34.6\n\n1,663\n\nTable A10.2: Summary Poverty Impact in the Four Subprojects\n\nItem\n\nAbatpur\n\nChoto Kumira Purba Sayedpur\n\nSriramkandi\n\nAppendix 10, page 6\n\n531\n540\n\n48.8\n\n38.7\n\n2,594\n\nBenefit.

Three subprojects were identified and\nassessed  in  terms  of  resettlement  and  land  acquisition  issues.  The  assessment  indicates  that\nnone are expected to have a significant impact in terms of resettlement and land acquisition.\n\n2.\nThe  draft  summary  resettlement  plan  provides  an  estimate  based  on  design  data  for\nthree subprojects in Sonotala flood control drainage (FCD); Sriramkandi flood control drainage;\nand Madhukhali flood control drainage.\n\n3.\nThe  resettlement  plan  will  be  updated  prior  to  commencing  works.  Receipt  of  the\nupdated  final  resettlement  plan  acceptable  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  be  a\ncondition  for  commencing  construction.  This  will  be  reflected  in  the  loan  covenants  to  ensure\ncompliance.\n\nB.\n\nResettlement Policy\n\nResettlement  will  be  implemented  according  to  the  following  legislation  of  the\n4.\nGovernment  of  Bangladesh  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement\n(November  1995).  The  basis  under  the  Constitution  and  laws  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of\nBangladesh are The Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Ordinance of 1982.\n\nC.\n\nMinimization of Resettlement Impact\n\n5.\nThe Project will adopt a policy of minimizing adverse resettlement impacts and reducing\nthe  number  of  affected  persons  by  continuously  reviewing  the  design  to  minimize  land\nacquisition and resettlement requirements.\n\nD.\n\nResettlement Impact\n\n6.\nThe  three  core  subprojects  assessed  have  only  insignificant  impacts  in  terms  of\nresettlement. In the Sonatala flood control drainage subproject, embankment, canal, regulator,\nand  sluice  gates  have  been  constructed  on  4.72  hectares  (ha)  of  private  land  and  1.36  ha  of\ngovernment  (khas)  land.  To  construct  infrastructure,  0.0300  ha  have  been  taken  from  each  of\nthe 157 plots (private). Loss to individual owners compared with the benefits is insignificant. The\npeople affected do not need to be resettled or relocated. For the Sriramkandi subproject, a flood\nprotection  embankment  with  two  regulators  will  be  constructed  on  4.00  ha  of  Water\nDevelopment Board (WDB) land and 0.41 ha of private land. Concurrence of the WDB for use of\ntheir land will meet the legal requirements. The private cultivated land will be compensated at an\nagreed rate. Ten households now residing on WDB land as squatters will have to be relocated.\nFor the Ramkrisnapur drainage subproject, no land acquisition or resettlement will be acquired.\n\nE.\n\nResettlement Principles and Entitlements\n\n7.\nThose affected will be assisted to maintain their original standard of living, at least equal\nto  what  they  enjoyed  prior  to  the  Project.  All  possible  means  will  be  explored  to  minimize\nresettlement  and  land  acquisition  impacts  by  modifying  the  engineering  designs.  This  will  be\ncarried out in close consultation with those affected. Plans for acquisition of land and to address\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 11, page 2\n\nthose affected  will be implemented in consultation with the people affected to ensure minimal\ndisturbance. Financial and physical resources for compensation will be made available as and\nwhen required.\n\nPeople  affected  may  resettle  themselves  or  be  resettled  in  close  proximity  to  their\n8.\nrespective  villages.  Legal  owners  and  tenants  of  land  will  be  compensated  and  assisted  with\nrehabilitation.\n\nNo works under any contract awarded under the Project will commence until all required\n9.\nfunds  are  made  available  to  the  concerned  land  acquisition  collector  and  compensation\npayments and/or other assistance have been made available to those affected.\n\n10. When  the  design  of  subprojects  is  finalized,  an  entitlement  matrix  will  be  prepared  for\neach  subproject  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  resettlement  policy.  An  independent  review  of  the\nresettlement operation will be commissioned by ADB after completion of the Project to assess\nwhether those affected have regained or improved their livelihoods and standards of living.\n\nF.\n\nConsultations and Grievance Procedures\n\n11.\nSocial  preparation  is  an  essential  part  of  the  planning  and  implementation  of  the\nresettlement  process.  The  Local  Government  Engineering  Department  (LGED)  and  upazila\nofficers  will  enlist  the  assistance  of  local  nongovernment  organizations  to  inform  the  affected\npersons  of  the  project  impacts,  and  their  entitlements  and  rehabilitation  options  under  the\nresettlement plan. The resettlement plan will be designed and implemented in consultation with\nthe  water  management  association  and  those  affected.  Grievance  redress  of  the  people\naffected  may  be  provided  through  the  local  conflict  resolution  committee,  constituted  with  the\nlocal  upazila  officer,  upazila  engineer,  LGED,  the  assistant  commissioner  (land),  local  union\nparishad  chairperson,  a  female  member  of  the  union  parishad,  WMA  chairperson,  and  a\nrepresentative of those affected.\n\nG.\n\nImplementation Arrangement\n\nThe subprojects under the Project have insignificant resettlement effects and the scope\n12.\nfor resettlement will not be large. Therefore establishment of a resettlement unit to take care of\nresettlement  issues  independently  will  not  be  necessary.  The  project  management  office  may\nextend support through a resettlement and land management consultant.\n\nH.\n\nCost\n\n13.\nAverage  resettlement  cost  per  subproject  has  been  estimated  at  Tk250,000.00.  The\nestimated  resettlement  cost  of  all  subprojects  will  be  firmed  up  when  the  design  of  the\nsubprojects  has  been  finalized.  The  full  costs  of  resettlement  and  compensation  will  be  the\nresponsibility of the Government.\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 12, page 1\n\nFINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS\n\nA.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe  Second  Small-Scale  Water  Resource  Development  Sector  Project  will  have  a  direct\n1.\nimpact  on  the  rural  economy  by  enhancing  agricultural  production.  Drainage  infrastructure  can\nbring  more  land  into  production  and/or  allow  land  to  be  productive  throughout  more  of  the  year.\nFlood  management  projects  reduce  losses  from  flooding  and  allow  the  use  of  high-yielding\nvarieties on more land. Water conservation schemes allow supplementary irrigation in addition to\nincreasing  retained  soil  moisture  after  the  rainy  season.  Command  area  development  directly\nincreases irrigation, leading to a shift to the higher productivity of irrigated agriculture.\n\nThis  is  a  sector  development  project  and  the  actual  number  of  subprojects  and  their\n2.\ncoverage  areas  are  therefore  not  definitively  mandated  in  advance.  However,  about  300\nsubprojects  (covering  roughly  195,000  hectares  [ha])  are  expected  to  be  constructed.  Using  the\nexperience of the first Small-Scale Water Resources Development Sector Project (SSWRDSP), an\nexpected  mix  of  subproject  types  (between  flood  management,  drainage,  etc.)  for  the  proposed\nProject  can  be  assumed  as  the  Project  expands  to  include  the  eastern  sections  of  the  country.\nFour  prospective  subprojects  have  been  intensively  examined  and  their  expected  financial  and\neconomic  returns,  discussed  here,  can  be  seen  as  indicative  for  the  remaining  potential\nsubprojects.  An overall project return can then be determined as costs not specific to subproject\ndevelopment are incorporated into the analysis.\n\n3.\nTo determine the expected direct benefits of the subprojects in question, quantifiable effects\nare valued by comparison of with- and without-project scenarios. In addition to quantifiable benefits\nand  costs  included  in  this  analysis,  however,  the  Project  can  be  expected  to  have  various\nnonquantifiable  effects.  Flood  management  and  drainage  schemes  can  provide  protection  for\nhouseholds,  for  example,  and  embankments  can  serve  as  easier  access  to  some  parts  of\nsubproject  areas  not  well  served  by  regular  roads.  The  rise  in  local  household  income  and  food\nproduction will result in an improved status of nutrition and welfare for the subprojects\u2019 populations.\nFish habitat, on the other hand, may change. The quantity of local fish production can be mitigated\nthrough the construction of fish ponds as part of the Project, but access to fisheries by traditional\nusers  may  be  negatively  affected  in  some  circumstances  and  will  need  to  be  adjusted  through\ninstitutional means.\n\nB.\n\nApproach and Methodology\n\n4.\nPrices  used  in  the  analysis  were  identified  through  a  variety  of  secondary  sources  in\naddition  to  field  trips  to  the  proposed  subproject  areas.  Basic  assumptions  used  in  the  economic\npart of the analysis include the following:\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nA world price numerair is used.\nValues are expressed in constant year 2000 prices to exclude inflation.\nThe Bangladesh taka (Tk) is the unit of account; the rate of exchange used here is\nthe prevailing rate at the time of appraisal: Tk 54 per US dollar.\nFor  nontraded  goods  and  services,  a  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.9  and  a\nshadow wage rate of 0.85 are used.1\n\n                  \n\n1  The  derivation  of  economic  values  in  the  water  sector  in  Bangladesh  is  laid  out  in  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s\nRepublic  of  Bangladesh.  August  2000.  Draft  Development  Strategy,  Volume  No.  8,  Annex  J:  Economics, National\nWater Management Plan Project, Water Resources Planning Organization, Ministry of Water Resources. Dhaka.\n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 12, page 2\n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nFor major tradable commodities, economic values are based on border parity pricing\n(footnote 1).  Standard methods of deriving farmgate output/input prices are applied.\nTransfer  payments  such  as  taxes  and  subsidies  are  excluded  in  the  calculation  of\neconomic values.\n\n5.\n\nThe four sample subprojects analyzed are\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nSriramkandi (Faridpur) flood management,\nAbatpur (Sunamgonj) (flood management partially submersible embankment),\nPurba Sayedpur (in Lakshmipur District) water conservation scheme, and\nChoto Kumira (Chittagong) water conservation scheme.\n\nFor each of these subprojects cropping patterns and technologies both with and without the\n6.\nProject have been estimated based on the expected changes in land use due to flood protection\nand/or  increased  availability  of  water  for  crops.  Per  hectare  costs  of  production  and  returns  for\nrelevant crops have also been calculated for both situations and translated into economic values.\nFor the subprojects\u2019 net benefited area, the incremental value of production was calculated. To be\nconservative  about  field  data,  for  the  calculation  of  economic  returns  agricultural  benefits  have\nbeen adjusted to 90 percent of their nominal values.\n\nSome  subprojects  (for  example  Sriramkandi)  may  be  expected  to  have  an  effect  upon\n7.\ncapture  fisheries.  These  subprojects  typically  involve  the  building  of  embankments  and  control\nstructures and have the possible side effect of preventing the normal production of fish in low-lying\nareas.  While  flood  protection  may  actually  increase  production  in  privately  owned  fish  ponds,  for\nthe  more  open  areas  harboring  fish  when  flooded,  flood  management  structures  may  damage\nproduction.  When  such  conditions  are  expected,  appropriate  adjustments  to  benefits  are  made\nand/or provision is made for fishponds to be included in subproject implementation plans so as to\nmitigate the expected fishery effects.\n\n8.\nGiven  the  available  information  on  the  planned  structures  and  earthworks  to  be  built,  the\ncost of each subproject has been determined.  These costs have also been converted to economic\nvalues.  Operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  (to  be  borne  by  benefiting  farmers)  have  also\nbeen  estimated  at  3  percent  of  construction  costs  for  earthworks  and  1.5  percent  of  the  cost  of\nstructures\u2014with  some  exceptions  where  higher  rates  are  used.  For  example,  6  percent  O&M  is\nassumed  for  the  partially  submersible  embankments  in  Abatpur.  In  addition,  an  allowance  in  the\ncalculation  is  made  for  a  major  repair  of  the  infrastructure  in  year  15  of  project  life\u2014generally\nassumed to be equivalent to 40 percent of the original construction cost.\n\n9.\nBoth benefits and costs are expressed as cash flow streams over an expected 20 years of\nsubproject  life.  From  these  cash  flows,  net  present  values  and  the  economic  rates  of  return  are\ncalculated. Finally, sensitivity analyses are performed on the results by assuming various scenarios\nrelating to particular risk factors such as shortened project life due to poor O&M, delays in project\nimplementation, increased construction costs, decreased benefits, and a drop in the price of rice.2\n\nExpected subproject impacts on poverty are also examined. Agricultural production benefits\n10.\nare generally assumed to accrue to landowners. Household income is expected to increase from\n\n                  \n\n2  World Bank commodity price projections of April 2000 predict a general rise in rice prices over the next decade and a\ndecline of prices for two of the three fertilizer prices of relevance (with some rise in the third). While these predictions\nmay indicate little price risk, the possibility of future price changes that may negatively impact the project is dealt with\nthrough the sensitivity analysis regarding the price of rice. To be somewhat more conservative than the World Bank\nprice projections, the base analysis is built on the assumption of constant relative prices.\n\n\f69\n\nAppendix 12, page 3\n\nincremental labor utilization with the subprojects. Improved water resource regimes allow farmers\nto  more  fully  adopt  high-yielding  variety  technology,  and  labor  inputs  can  be  expected  to  rise  to\nsome extent. Assuming the degree of unemployment and underemployment that is typical of rural\nBangladesh,  in  local  financial  terms  this  increase  in  labor  income  (either  through  wages  or  as\nreturns to labor on a household\u2019s own land) can add substantially to household income, particularly\nthat  of  the  poor.  On  a  national  level,  however,  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  labor  must  be\ntaken into account and the incremental wage effect on poverty is a good deal less than it is in local\nfinancial terms.\n\nC.\n\nEconomic and Financial Appraisal\n\n11.\nTo  consider  the  results  of  the  economic  and  financial  analysis,  one  of  the  four  sample\nsubprojects is examined in some detail in this text and in tables A12.1 and A12.2.  Full comparable\ndetails in tabular form, however, can be found for all four subprojects in tables A12.3 and A12.4.\n\n1. \n\nSriramkandi\n\n12.\nSriramkandi  subproject  in  Faridpur  district  is  designed  to  provide  flood  management\nbenefits for farms covering 275 ha.  When the area is better protected from floods with the Project,\nfarmers\u2019 choices of cropping pattern, intensity, and technology are expected to adapt positively to\nthe  new  opportunities.  In  financial  terms,  once  farmers  have  fully  adapted  to  their  new  water\nregime, the value of net incremental crop production is expected to be about Tk1.3 million a year,\nor Tk4,660 per hectare (Table A12.1). Of this, Tk1.1 million will be from incremental rice production\n(261  tons)  and  Tk0.2  million  from  other  crops.  Cropping  intensity  is  expected  to  rise  from  its\npresent 170 percent to 184 percent with the Project. Rice output/ha is expected to rise by about 14\npercent, due to higher inputs on the existing mix of rice varieties and a shift to more high-yielding\nvarieties.\n\nThis  subproject,  however,  is  expected  to  have  a  fisheries  effect.  Without  the  Project,  in\n13.\nroughly 5 years out of 10, approximately 250 ha of floodplain can be expected to be flooded with\nsufficient  water  to  provide  a  temporary  habitat  for  fish.  This  fish  production  (expanded  to  an\naverage  annual  basis)  is  valued  at  over  Tk300,000  and  will  be  lost  once  the  subproject  is\nimplemented. To mitigate for this effect, 7 ha of fishponds are proposed to be constructed within\nthe subproject area. These ponds are expected to provide a catch worth over Tk400,000 per year\n\u2014enough to compensate for lost fish production and for the pond cost.\n\nThe construction cost of the subproject is estimated at Tk4.2 million, which will lead to an\n14.\nexpected  Tk71,300  in  annual  O&M  expenditures.  In  addition,  the  proposed  fishponds  will  cost\nTk300,000  and  incur  annual  O&M  costs  for  stocking,  pumping,  and  embankment  maintenance\ntotaling Tk32,750. Total regular O&M is, then, Tk105,050, or about Tk380 per ha.  A comparison of\nfinancial  benefits  per  ha  with  this  expected  O&M  figure  would  indicate  that  project  beneficiaries\nshould have no problem meeting their O&M responsibilities. Assuming funds are put aside for the\nprojected year 15 major repair, this cost can be covered by an additional Tk365/year/ha.\n\nIn  Table  A12.2  the  economic  valuations  of  the  subproject\u2019s  costs  and  benefits  can  be\n15.\nseen.3  The life of the Project is expected to be 20 years and the agricultural benefits are phased in\nover the first four years following construction. The economic net present value (NPV), assuming a\n12 percent opportunity cost of capital, is Tk2.6 million. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR)\nis 21 percent and the benefit-cost ratio is 2.4/1.\n\n3  These figures assume the 90 percent adjustment noted earlier.\n\n                  \n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 12, page 4\n\nVarious sensitivity analysis scenarios focus on a number of risks that may face the Project.\n16.\nWhat will happen to returns if the rice price drop (despite World Bank projections for an increase)\nor general benefits are less than estimated? Similarly, if the cost of construction increases or the\nconstruction period is prolonged (delaying project benefits), what would happen to the EIRR? Or, if\nO&M is not adequately performed and project life is subsequently shortened to less than 20 years,\nhow much will returns be affected?\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nIf the price of rice (the primary crop in this subproject) were to drop by 20 percent,\nthe  EIRR  would  decrease  to  a  still-acceptable  16  percent.  The  sensitivity  indicator\nfor  this  drop  is  3.2,  meaning  that  a  drop  in  rice  price  causes  a  proportionately  3.2\ntimes larger drop in returns (as measured in NPV).\nIf  general  benefits  were  to  drop  by  20  percent,  the  EIRR  would  decrease  to  14\npercent.  The  sensitivity  indicator  is  3.9  and  the  switching  value  (the  percentage\ndecrease  in  general  benefits  beyond  which  the  EIRR  drops  below  the  12  percent\ncutoff) is 25 percent.\nIf construction costs (and associated O&M costs) were to be 20 percent higher than\nestimated,  the  EIRR  would  drop  to  17  percent.  Here  the  sensitivity  indicator  is  1.7\nand the switching value is 160 percent of estimated construction costs.\nIf  the  project  life  were  to  be  shortened  by  5  years  (to  15),  the  EIRR  would  be\nminimally  affected\u2014decreasing  only  to  20  percent.  The  NPV  would  decrease  by  a\nquarter. The switching value, indicating the minimum number of years of project life\nthat would maintain at least a 12 percent EIRR is 7 years.\nIf construction is prolonged for an additional 2 years, in effect delaying the start of\nproject  benefits,  the  EIRR  would  drop  to  16  percent,  and  be  associated  with  a  46\npercent decrease in NPV.\n\n17.\nOverall,  these  sensitivity  tests  indicate  that  the  economic  viability  of  this  subproject  can\nwithstand the levels of change in the risk factors that have been tested. Sensitivity indicators and\nswitching  values  would  imply  that  substantial  deterioration  in  the  levels  of  the  risk  factors  could\njeopardize subproject performance,  with the exception of the risk of shortening subproject life for\nwhich there appears to be a good deal of leeway. Generally, however, these results can be seen\nas  moderately  robust,  and  indicate  a  level  of  returns  that  are  at  a  sufficiently  high  level  to\naccommodate  a  reasonable  share  of  the  overall  Project\u2019s  additional  costs  of  management,\nsubproject selection, monitoring, etc.\n\n18.\nHousehold income in the subproject area is likely to increase both by the incremental net\nvalue  of  agricultural  production  as  well  as  by  the  returns  to  the  labor  that  is  involved  in  that\nincremental  production.  Assuming  the  degree  of  unemployment  and  underemployment  that  is\ntypical of rural Bangladesh, in financial terms the households of the area are likely to benefit from\nan  increase  in  wage  income  (or  its  equivalent  in  on-farm  returns  to  family  labor)  of  more  than\nTk700,000  per  year.  On  a  per  ha  basis  (to  make  it  comparable  to  the  incremental  value  of  crop\nproduction), this incremental labor income is expected to be about Tk2,560/ha.\n\n19.\nThe  poor  own  43  percent  of  the  275  ha  of  net  benefited  area  within  the  subproject.  They\nare  expected  to  get,  then,  43  percent  of  the  incremental  production  income  from  the  Project.  In\naddition,  they  can  also  be  expected  to  benefit  from  the  with-project  increased  labor  income  from\ntheir own land, and to be hired on a wage basis to cover a part (50 percent is assumed here) of the\nincreased  labor  needs  of  medium  and  large  landholders.  The  poor  may,  then,  claim  something\nover 70 percent of the incremental wage income resulting from the subproject. In addition, labor for\nearthworks  involved  in  project  construction  is  likely  to  be  drawn  from  local  poor  households.\nOverall, when combining crop production and labor income, the poor may attain 58 percent of the\n\n\f71\n\nAppendix 12, page 5\n\nfull  local  financial  benefits  of  the  project.  On  an  annual  basis  this  group  is  likely  to  gain  Tk1.0\nmillion  per  year.  Two  hundred  and  fifty-four  subproject  households  are  classified  as  small  and\nmarginal  farmers,  or  laborers  and  landless.  While  distribution  within  this  group  is  likely  to  be\nuneven, the average incremental increase in household income among the poor is expected to be\nTk3,945 per year. (In economic terms, in which the national opportunity cost of labor is included,\nthe  poor  are  expected  to  receive  47  percent  of  total  project  benefits,  which  is  Tk615,000  or  an\naverage of Tk2,420 per poor household.)\n\n2. \n\nSummary of Four Sample Subprojects\n\n20.\nTables A12.3 and A12.4 present a number of financial and economic statistics for all four\nsubprojects including Sriramkandi. The EIRRs range from 21 percent for Sriramkandi to 36 percent\nfor  Choto  Kumira.  NPVs  range  from  Tk2.7  million  in  Sriramkandi  up  to  Tk13.5  million  in  Choto\nKumira.  As  for  poverty  impacts,  in  local  financial  terms  benefited  poor  households  may  expect  a\nrise  in  annual  income  of  Tk3,020  to  Tk3,940,  depending  on  their  subproject.  In  economic  terms,\nthis annual income rise for poor households is calculated to range from Tk1,660 to Tk2,600.\n\n3. \n\nFull Project\n\n21.\nThe four sample subprojects can be seen as reasonably representative of their types (flood\nmanagement  and  water  conservation  scheme),  and  their  types  comprise  83  percent  of  the  300\nexpected  subprojects  that  will  be  constructed  by  the  Project.  For  various  reasons,  two  other\npossible types of subproject (drainage and command area development) were not included among\nthe sampled subprojects. Nevertheless, an approximation of full project returns can be devised if\nthe results of the sample subprojects are extrapolated on a per ha basis to the entire project area\n(estimated to be about 195,000 ha) and the nonconstruction project costs (in economic valuation\nterms) are included in the calculation. The Project as a whole can be expected to have an EIRR of\n19  percent  when  costs  of  the  subproject  development  component  (including  social  mobilization,\nselection,  project  management,  monitoring,  and  postconstruction  agricultural  and  fisheries\nprograms) are included.  If the costs of the institutional strengthening component are also included,\nthe EIRR is 17 percent.\n\nAside from economic returns, a number of additional full project figures can be calculated\n22.\nby extrapolation from the four sample subprojects: (i) rice production will increase by 180,000 tons,\nproducing incremental net crop income from rice of Tk820 million/year;  (ii) overall net crop income\nwill rise by Tk975 million (or 35 percent) in project areas; (iii) increased local labor demand will be\n7.8 million days a year (or about Tk420 million); (iv) about 280,000 households (1.7 million people)\nwill benefit, at an average of Tk4,900/year/household; (v) beneficiaries will handle Tk47 million in\nregular  O&M  costs,  saving  the  Government  (which  would  otherwise  be  responsible)  $870,000\nequivalent (per year or $17.4 million equivalent) over the 20 year life of the Project.\n\n\fTable A12.1: Net Agricultural Income With and Without the
