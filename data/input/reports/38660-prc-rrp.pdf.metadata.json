The summary of the environmental impact assessment was \ncirculated  to  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) and placed on the ADB website on 28 May 2007. \n \n\nProject Description  The Project covers 3,655 square kilometers of the oasis of the Yinchuan \nPlain extending into the Helan Mountains to the west of the Yellow River \nin Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. It comprises three districts and two \ncounties  that  surround  the  ancient  city  of  Yinchuan,  the  capital.  The \nProject will support the policies and plans of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous \nRegion  government  (NHARG)  to  combat  land  degradation  through  an \nintegrated  ecosystem  management  (IEM)  approach.  Since  2003,  the \nPRC  has  been  selectively  introducing  IEM  in  acknowledgment  of  the \nmultidimensional nature of land degradation. IEM approaches emphasize \nthe  links  between  natural  ecosystem  capacities  and  socioeconomic \nactivities,  and  seek  to  holistically  rehabilitate  damaged  ecosystem \nservices and functions by tackling the root causes of damaging practices, \nincluding  reduction  of  rural  poverty.  The  Project  will  reform  enabling \npolicies  and  regulations,  as  well  as  build  institutional,  regulatory,  and \npolicy capacity to combat land degradation using an IEM approach. It will \ndemonstrate measures to achieve improved water and land use planning \nin  poor \nand  management,  support  sustainable \ncommunities  through  contracts  with  commercial  enterprises,  and  link \ncommercial  and  conservation  values  to  rehabilitate  the  degraded \nwetlands and grasslands. A Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant will \nensure  that  an  IEM  approach  is  used  in  project  implementation  and \nprovide  support  measures  to  protect  15  globally  threatened  species.  A \nmarket-based  approach  will  be  taken  to  promote  sustainable  resource \nuse  and  protect  and  conserve  wetlands,  grasslands,  transboundary \nflyways,  and  cultural  sites.  Tourism  and  recreation  opportunities  will  be \nprovided for 1.1 million local residents and visitors.  \n \n\nlivelihoods \n\nrural \n\n \n\nRationale \n\nThe PRC has some of the worst land degradation problems in the world, \nespecially in the vast western region where more than 350 million people \nlive  and  poverty  incidence  is  the  highest.  In  recent  decades,  the \npressures  of  intensified  use,  increased  population,  and  rapid  economic \ngrowth  have  led  to  losses  of  vital  ecosystem  services,  and  reduced \nproductivity  of  grasslands,  farmlands,  wetlands,  forests,  and  mountain \nareas.   \n \n\n\f \nImpact and \nOutcome \n\n \nProject Investment \nPlan \n \nFinancing Plan \n\nii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nthis \n\ntrend \n\nPrograms  to  combat  land  degradation  were  initiated  under  the  9th \n(1996\u25002000)  and  10th  (2001\u25002005)  five\u2013year  plans,  and  have  resulted \nin  some  environmental  improvements.  However,  the  high  cost  of  top-\ndown  and  uncoordinated  sector  approaches  are  of  concern.  The  root \ncauses, such as rural poverty and alternative livelihood options to reduce \nactivities  that  damage  the  environment,  were  inadequately  addressed. \nThe  project  area  typifies  problems  found  in  many  parts  of  the  western \nregion. Very fast economic growth in recent years, overuse of water and \nagrochemicals  in  agriculture,  conversion  of  marginal  desert-edge  lands \nto irrigation for poor farming households, and rapid urban and industrial \nspread  with  high  pollution  have  resulted  in  significant  loss  of  vital \necosystem  services  and  values.  Reversing \nrequires \nstrengthening  the  quality  of  the  policy  and  regulatory  framework, \ncoordinating  land  and  water  planning  and  management,  and  expanding \nthe role of markets in activities that are compatible with the rehabilitation \nof ecosystems and their sustainable future use. \n \nThe impact of the Project will be improved environmental management to \nrehabilitate the ecosystems and increased rural incomes in the Yinchuan \narea.  The  main  outcome  is  to  introduce  an  IEM  approach  to  provide \nsustainable livelihoods for the population of the project area.  \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $221.0  million \nequivalent, including taxes and duties of $4.2 million. \n \nA  loan  of  $100,000,000  from  the  ordinary  capital  resources  of  ADB  will \nbe  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \nlending  facility.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term  including  a  grace \nperiod of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \nAgreement.  NHARG  will  ensure  counterpart  funding  of  $116.5  million \nequivalent. \n \nGEF  grant  cofinancing  of  $4,545,000  equivalent,  to  be  administered  by \nADB, has been approved for the Project. \n\n \n\nSource \nA.

NHARG  will  onlend  part  of  the  loan  proceeds  to  the  participating \nlocal government agencies under the same terms and conditions as the \nADB  loan.  The  subborrowers  will  assume  the  foreign  exchange  and \ninterest rate variation risks for their part of the ADB loan.  \n \n\n \n31 October 2014 \n \n \nNHARG will be responsible for overall implementation of the Project and \nfor coordinating activities of the project implementing agencies and their \nrespective  project  implementation  units.  The  lead  group,  formed  by \nNHARG,  will  ensure  coordination  across  sectors  and  provide  important \ndecision-making  for  key  project  plans,  strategic  decisions,  and  policy \nissues.  The  provincial  project  management  office  (PPMO),  established \nby  NHARG,  will  be  provided  with  adequate  full-time  staff.  It  will  be \nresponsible  for  day-to-day  project  implementation,  and  coordinate  and \nprovide  leadership  in  IEM  approaches.  IEM  capacity  within  the  PPMO \nwill be developed.  \n \nNHARG, through its Finance Department \n \nGoods, works, and related services for ADB-financed and GEF-financed \ncontracts  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Depending  on  the \nvalue,  contracts  for  equipment  and  materials  will  be  awarded  through  a \ncombination  of  international  competitive  bidding,  limited  international \nbidding,  national  competitive  bidding,  direct  contracting,  and  community \nparticipation.  Foreign  contractors  may  bid  on  contracts  using  national \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures.  A  procurement  plan  covering  goods, \nworks,  and  services,  including  the  contract  value,  procurement  method, \nand  prequalification  of  bidders  was  agreed  with  NHARG  at  loan \nappraisal. \n \nThe  Project  will  finance  27  person-months  of  international  and  100 \nperson-months  of  national  consulting  services \nthree  contract \npackages.  \n \nPackage  A,  comprising  4  international  and  7  national  person-months  to \nstrengthen  the  project  management  capabilities  of  the  PPMO,  will  be \nfinanced  from  the  GEF  grant.  Individual  consultant  selection  will  be \napplied.

A \nconsulting  firm  will  be  recruited,  based  on  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection  (80:20),  to  provide  the  required  services.  ADB  will  be \nresponsible for recruitment and the PPMO for contract negotiations and \ncontract management. \n\nin \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \nProject Benefits \nand Beneficiaries  \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\nPackage  C,  comprising  11  international  and  16  national  person-months \nto  provide  specialist  technical  services  in  water  resource  management, \nwill be financed directly from the loan. Individual consultant selection will \nbe  applied.  The  PPMO  will  be  responsible  for  selection,  contract \nnegotiations, and contract management. Consultants will be recruited in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time).  \n \nIncome  benefits  will  be  achieved  for  about  46,400  rural  households, \nincluding previously resettled poor communities and Hui minority people. \nThese  will  result  from  linkages  to  enterprises  in  conservation-oriented \nproduction of beef, dairy, grapes, and other agricultural activities such as \nChinese  dates,  wolfberry,  and  other  fruits;  fodder;  and  significant \nproduction of vegetables, mushrooms, medicinal herbs, and cut flowers. \nVocational  and  technical  training  will  be  provided  for  rural  households. \nAbout  5,200  nonfarming  jobs  will  be  created  in  the  livestock,  perennial \ncrops, and other agricultural industries.  \n \nProject activities will enhance the environment and improve the habitats \nof  Shahu  Lake,  Yuehai  Lake,  and  the  Yinchuan  City  wetlands.  Water \nresources  and  livelihood  improvement  will  directly  benefit  about  10%  of \nthe  land  area  and  an  estimated  32%  of  the  rural  population.  About \n124,195  hectares  of  the  piedmont  zone  of  the  Helan  Mountains, \nwetlands,  and  the  Helan  Nature  Reserve  will  benefit  from  improved \nprotection and conservation management. The benefits from investments \nto  restore  and  conserve  ecosystem  functions,  services,  and  values  to \nhelp  protect  the  habitat  of  threatened  wild  species  have  not  been \nquantified but are believed to be substantial. \n \nThe  Project  adopts  an  ecosystem-based  approach  to  address  the  root \ncauses  of  land  degradation  and  related  issues,  and  the  planning  and \nimplementation  of  project  activities.  Top-down  and  sector-specific \napproaches to land degradation have been expensive and only partially \nsuccessful in the PRC.  \n \nRisks facing successful project management and implementation include \n(i)  lack  of  familiarity  with  ADB  policies  and  procedures;  (ii)  changes  in \nPPMO  personnel;  (iii)  bureaucratic  and  lengthy  procurement  decision-\nmaking;  (iv)  inadequate  management  capacity  that  compounds  delays; \nand  (v)  procurement,  fraud,  and  corruption.  To  mitigate  these  risks,  the \nProject  will  provide  technical  and  management  advisory  support  and \ntraining,  particularly  during  the  first  2  years  of  project  implementation. \nThe multifaceted character of the Project limits its financial and economic \nrisks.  The  risks  to  individual  activities  may  be  significant,  but  are  all \nunlikely to occur, so the overall project risk is low.   \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nMarket  risks  include  (i)  excess  production  could  lower  local  prices  and \nreduce  returns  to  households,  which  would  be  more  likely  if  local \nproduction is not adequately connected to market distribution chains; and \n(ii) tourism demand could fail to grow as expected due to congestion or \nother  negative  impacts.  These  risks  will  be  mitigated  through  planning \nand  coordination  of  producers,  market  diversification,  and  integrated \ntourism  sector  planning.  Some  activities  face  technical  risks,  and  these \nare addressed by ensuring that appropriate contractual relationships are \nin  place;  and  providing  for  adequate  reviews,  technical  assessments, \nand monitoring. \n \nIn  October  2002,  the  PRC  Government  entered  a  strategic  partnership \nwith  GEF  and  other  international  partners  to  develop  and  scale  up \ncomprehensive  resource  management  approaches  that  integrate  the \necological,  economic,  and  social  dimensions  of  the  land  degradation \nproblem  through  an  IEM  approach.  GEF  has  provided  a  grant  of \n$4,545,000,  which  will  be  administered  by  ADB.  The  GEF-financed \nactivities  will  ensure  the  IEM  approach  is  followed  to  contribute  to \nrestoring the productive and protective functions of the area\u2019s ecosystem \nresources. The project area includes 68% of the vertebrate species and \n42%  of  vascular  plants  in  the  Ningxia  Hui  Autonomous  Region;  the \nalluvial  plain  of  the  Yellow  River  system  is  its  most  important  zone. \nFifteen globally threatened species are in the project area, of which nine \nare  permanent  residents  and  the  other  six  are  migratory  birds.  An  IEM \napproach  will  be  followed  for  protecting  resident  and  migratory  species \nand  their  grassland  and  wetland  habitats,  as  well  as  for  building  the \ninstitutional  and  regulatory  capacity  to  rehabilitate,  sustainably  manage, \nand protect the ecosystems in the project area.  \n \n\n \nGEF Grant \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fvii \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n\n \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nloan to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), and (ii) proposed administration of a grant from \nthe  Global  Environment  Facility  (GEF)  for  the  Ningxia  Integrated  Ecosystem  and  Agricultural \nDevelopment Project.  \n \n\nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nIn  August  2005,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  project  preparatory \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  to  help  the  Ningxia  Hui  Autonomous  Region  (NHAR)  of  the  PRC  to \nformulate  the  Project.1 GEF  also  provided  assistance  to  formulate  the  Project.  This  report  is \nbased  on  the  findings  of  the  TA,  feasibility  studies  of  the  Ningxia  Hui  Autonomous  Region \ngovernment  (NHARG), \nfindings  of  ADB  missions,  and  discussions  with  officials  and \nstakeholders. The project design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe PRC has some of the worst land degradation in the world, with more than 40% of its \nland  area,  or  between  3  million  and  4  million  square  kilometers  (km2)  adversely  affected.  The \nvast western region accounts for 71% of the country\u2019s land area and has a population of more \nthan  350  million,  including  many  of  the  most  poor  and  vulnerable.  A  strong  correlation  exists \nbetween  land  degradation  and  poverty  incidence.  Although  the  western  region  has  fewer \nbiodiversity species than the rest of the country, the richness of the endemic species is higher, \nand a serious threat of species extinction coexists with severe to moderate land degradation in \nnearly  half  of  its  area.  The  pressures  of  intensified  use  and  rapid  economic  growth  in  recent \ndecades  have  adversely  impacted  the  quality  of  most  farmland,  grassland,  forests,  wetlands, \nand  mountain  areas  of  the  western  region.  To  respond  to  the  increasing  threat,  the  PRC \nGovernment (the Government) significantly expanded its programs to combat land degradation \nunder the 9th (1996\u20132000) and 10th (2001\u20132005) five-year plans (FYPs), including reforestation, \nclosure and protection of natural forests, grassland improvement, soil and water conservation, \nbiodiversity  protection,  and  renewable  rural  energy.  The  Western  Development  Strategy, \nadopted  in  1999,  aims  to  (i)  reduce  economic  disparities  between  the  western  and  other \nregions, and (ii) ensure sustainable natural resource management. \n \nLocated  in  the  center  of  the  western  region,  Ningxia  is  the  smallest  of  the  PRC\u2019s \n4. \nprovinces, with a land area of 66,400 km2 and a population of only 5.8 million. It is one of the \ncountry\u2019s five ethnic minority regions, with approximately 2.1 million Hui, most of whom maintain \nMuslim traditions. Mostly a dry and desert-like region, it is bordered by the Yinchuan Plain in the \nnorth along the Yellow River, which runs for 397 kilometers (km) from the west to the northeast \nand provides extensive irrigation areas. Semi-arid loess plateau areas in the south and the large \nTenger,  Ulan  Buh,  and  Mu  Us  deserts  border  the  northern  and  eastern  parts  of  Ningxia. \nAlthough it has the second smallest provincial gross domestic product, Ningxia\u2019s economy grew \nquickly with annual growth of 10.9% during the 10th FYP, exceeding the national average and \nsupported by the continuing stimulus of the Western Development Strategy. Infrastructure and \nsocial  indicators  improved  significantly,  and  poverty  decreased.  Urbanization,  at  42%,  is \ngrowing at 9% annually. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

The  TA  is  under  the \nCountry Programming Framework for the PRC\u2013GEF Partnership on Land Degradation in Dryland Ecosystems. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nThe  oasis  of  the  Yinchuan  Plain  has  the  best  natural  resource  endowment  in  Ningxia. \n5. \nThe Yellow River flows through it, and it has areas of good soil in the alluvial plain and irrigation \ncanals  dating  back  more  than  2,000  years.  It  is  protected  from  the  prevailing  winds  and  large \ndeserts to the north by the Helan Mountains. Wetlands provide an international flyway for birds \nmoving seasonally between north Asia and southern areas of the PRC and beyond. The project \narea  lies  in  and  around  this  oasis  on  the  western  side  of  the  Yellow  River,  including  the \npiedmont zone and the Helan Mountains, and covers about 3,655 km2 including three districts \n(Jinfeng,  Xingqing,  and  Xixia),  two  counties  (Helan  and  Yongning),  and  Yinchuan  City. \nYinchuan, the capital, is undergoing a building boom, including a new district to support a large \nnew  government  complex;  it  is  densely  settled  with  a  population  of  1.14  million. 2  Poverty \nincidence is quite low, but the area has pockets of resettled poor migrants (about 74,000) from \nthe southern region of Ningxia. Over time, the quality of the water and land resources has been \ndegraded  because  of  expansion  of  agriculture  onto  marginal  soils,  overgrazing,  and  industrial \nand urban pollution, with significant loss of vital ecosystem functions, including loss of habitat for \nwild  species  and  loss  of  productive  capacity.  However,  the  project  area  has  favorable \nhydrological characteristics; and major features of the Yellow River pass through it; the area has \nconsiderable deep alluvial aquifers in the wetlands and the protected Helan Mountains. These \nconditions  provide  the  area  with  resources  key  to  enterprise  development  in  livestock  raising, \nmeat and dairy production, higher-value horticulture, and tourism-related industries. A review of \nthe sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n6. \nNHARG has taken preliminary measures to conserve water, close the Helan Mountains \nto grazing, promote conservation agriculture, and seek a more comprehensive approach to the \nroot  causes  of  environmental  degradation.  NHARG\u2019s  11th  FYP  (2006\u25002010)  recognizes  the \nchallenge: \u201cThe implementation of the 10th FYP was good, but the weak economic status of the \nNHAR  remains.  We  face  problems  such  as  unsustainable  growth  and  lack  of  integrated \ndevelopment.\u201d3 However,  economic  considerations  dominate  planning  and  the  target  growth \nrate is more than 10% during the 11th FYP. \n \nB. \n \n7. \nincluding  salinity, \ndesertification, soil erosion, polluted waterways, and lack of vegetative cover on farming areas \nand grasslands, are widespread throughout the project area. As the population expanded and \nagricultural,  urban,  and  industrial  influences  grew,  ecosystem  degradation  and  the  lack  of \ncapacity to control it have become key problems. Contributing factors include the following: \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nThe  signs  and  symptoms  of \n\nland  and  water  degradation, \n\n(i) \n\nUnsuitable  agricultural  practices.  On  good  agricultural  land,  excessive  tillage \nand removal of all crop residues exposes soil to high seasonal winds, loss of soil \nquality, and high risk of dust storms. Poor rural households have been resettled \non marginal lands with lighter soils and low water-holding capacity. Crops grown \non these areas require large inputs of water and fertilizers to achieve acceptable \n\n                                                 \n2  The project area is 60% urban and 40% rural, with average per capita income of $919 equivalent in urban areas \n\nand $393 equivalent in rural areas. \n\n3  Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Government. 2006.

Poor management of the lakes \nand  wetlands  along  the  Yellow  River  has  resulted  in  eutrophied  waterways, \npolluted  habitat  for  aquatic  and  birdlife,  and  loss  of  tourism  and  recreation \npotential.  Irrigation  canals  are  mostly  unlined  leading  to  large  losses  and \ninefficient  water  delivery.  Excessive  extraction  of  cheap  groundwater  for \nagriculture,  industry,  and  urban  uses  has  led  to  a  lowering  of  the  groundwater \ntable in some areas. \n\nPoor  management  of  natural  resources.  Ecosystem  elements  have  been \ntreated  in  isolation  from  each  other,  based  on  institutional  mandates.  Land \ndegradation  control  and  ecosystem  rehabilitation  have  emphasized  top-down \nengineering  solutions  on  a  sector  basis  (e.g.,  programs  in  forestry,  agriculture, \nand water resources), and have rarely involved the participation of local residents \nin identifying solutions. Habitat and biodiversity loss from inappropriate land use \nactivities and past poor ecosystem management decisions have resulted.       \n\n \nReversing  ecosystem  degradation  in  the  project  area  requires  that  the  root  causes  be \n8. \naddressed  so  that  rehabilitation  measures  can  be  successful.  Historically,  the  Government\u2019s \nprograms  to  combat  land  degradation  have  not  adequately  addressed  these  basic  causes, \nwhich  include  rural  poverty,  lack  of  alternative  livelihoods  that  avoid  damaging  practices, \ninadequate  land  tenure  arrangements,  and  lack  of  rural  financial  services.  Although  physical \nsigns of improvement can be seen in some areas (e.g., regrowth of vegetation after closure of \nthe  Helan  Mountains  to  grazing),  the  Government  remains  concerned  about  the  top-down \nsector-by-sector  approach,  lack  of  coordination  within  the  institutional  system  to  tackle  cross-\nsector issues, high cost, and need to develop sustainable livelihoods for inhabitants of affected \nareas. 5  As  identified  through  the  work  of  the  ongoing  PRC\u2013GEF  Partnership  on  Land \nDegradation  in  Dryland  Ecosystems,6 including  in  the  NHAR,  and  the  work  of  the  TA  team \n(footnote  1),  the  main  barriers  to  be  overcome  to  address  the  root  causes  of  land  and \necosystem  degradation  in  the  project  area  are  (i)  improving  the  quality  of  the  policy  and  legal \nand/or regulatory framework to provide a consistent, well-understood, and well-coordinated set \nof policies, incentive-based measures, and regulations to ensure adequate land tenure and land \n\n                                                 \n4  For example, in Ningxia, twice as much water is needed to produce a unit of rice compared to the national average. \nThe  intensity  of  agrochemical  use  is  five  times  the  national  average,  while  crop  yield  is  only  half  the  national \naverage. This has heavily contaminated water for agricultural irrigation. From 1986 to 2000, NHAR had the highest \npercentage growth in conversion of steppe and/or desert into irrigated cultivated land area of any province and/or \nregion,  despite  being  one  of  the  driest  areas  in  the  country.  This  has  led  directly  to  further  land  degradation  as \nmany  areas  were  either  unsuitable  for  cultivation  or  were  overcultivated,  contributing  to  loss  of  soil  health,  drier \nsoils, increased exposure to wind erosion, and long-term desertification. \n\n5  Evidence  of  this  is  provided  in  two  recent  evaluation  studies,  (ADB.  2003.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China  for  Poverty  Reduction  in  Key  Forestry  Conservation  Programs.  Manila;  and  ADB.  2003. \nTechnical  Assistance  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Poverty  Reduction  in  the  Grassland  Improvement \nProgram.  Manila),  which  undertook  field  surveys  covering  the  Government\u2019s  major  greenside  environmental \nprograms  in  multiple  provinces  in  2005.  Both  studies  concluded  that  while  some  good  environmental  outcomes \nwere achieved in line with their objectives (e.g., through tree planting and grassland rehabilitation), poverty was not \nsignificantly reduced, livelihood development was not achieved, and sustainability of the programs relied on large \ngovernment  subsidies.  The  studies  identified  key  reforms  to  be  addressed  by  future  programs,  including  \n(i)  reversing  the  top-down  and  centralized  approach  to  planning  and  implementation,  and  (ii)  increasing  the \nparticipation of local people. \n\n6  ADB.  2002.

Farmers  and \n\nuse  arrangements;  (ii)  addressing  inconsistencies  between  sector  approaches  and  area \nplanning,  and  building  institutional  capacity  to  address  resource  management  using  an \necosystem approach, especially for upgrading land and water management; (iii) expanding the \nrole of markets to better serve the income needs of the rural population in industries by making \nmore efficient use of land and water; and (iv) linking commercial and conservation values in the \nfuture management of ecosystems.  \n \n9. \nThe  existing  policy  and  legal  framework  in  the  NHAR  is  reasonably  clear  about  the \nrequirements, responsibilities, and working arrangements for all agencies; as well as the targets \nthey are expected to meet and the policies they have to follow. However, with regard to handling \nmore  complex  multisector  issues,  such  as  the  control  of  land  degradation,  desertification,  and \nbiodiversity protection, no effective mechanism is currently in place to ensure cooperation and \nlack \nconsultation  among  sectors, \nunderstanding  of  the  role  and  functions  of  regulations.  Overlapping  functions  between  the \nagencies  and  overlapping  responsibilities  between  specific  laws,  regulations,  and  policies \nrequire urgent reform and actions to meet the complex environmental challenges of the project \narea.7 Substantial  efforts  and  cooperation  at  all  levels  are  needed  to  remove  the  gaps  and \noverlaps in existing environmental policies, laws, and regulations. Local regulations are not fully \nenforced,  land  tenure  arrangements  are  often  uncertain,  and  land  use  rights  for  rural \ncommunities  require  reform  to  promote  a  long-term  perspective.  Introducing  special  legislative \nprovisions  and  supporting  policy  to  enable  rural  citizens  to  participate  in  decision-making \nprocedures  for  the  use  and  management  of  the  land  they  use  is  an  important  part  of  this \nprocess. \n \nNHARG has made a start in addressing some of the problems of land degradation (e.g., \n10. \nthrough  a  grazing  ban  and  urban  water  conservation  measures),  and  now  plans  a \ncomprehensive integrated ecosystem management (IEM) approach to combat the wider causes \nof  past  environmental  damage,  and  to  ensure  that  future  resource  use  is  sustainable.  This  is \nsupported  by  the  preparation  of  a  land  degradation  strategy  and  action  plan,  authored  by  a \nmultisector  NHAR  task  force.  The  strategy  acknowledges  that  the  existing  institutional \narrangements  are  inadequate  for  a  comprehensive  approach.8 The  lead  group  (para.  42)  and \nsector  specialists  who  contributed  to  this  work  will  have  a  key  role  in  the  management  and \nintellectual leadership of the Project and in ensuring that the IEM approach is institutionalized in \nthe  project  area.  Zoning  of  land  to  align  land  use  with  ecosystem  capacity;  analyses  of  future \nwater  demand  to  balance  urban,  rural,  and  environmental  uses;  provision  of  access  and  free \nsharing between stakeholders of data and information on ecosystem characteristics and trends; \nand multidisciplinary training to develop greater skills and awareness are all needed. Irrigation \nsystem  rehabilitation,  improved  on-farm  water  delivery  and  management,  reduced  agricultural \nrunoff into wetlands, and improved soil quality through the adoption of conservation agriculture \nare changes NHARG will pursue in the project area.  \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n7  Ningxia OP12-Executing Office. November 2006. Strategy and Action Plan on Combating Land Degradation, p. 38, \nnotes, for instance, that (i) the Soil Conservation Law mainly focuses on water erosion and soil loss, but it cannot \nsolve the other root problems of land degradation in wider aspects concerning soil heath and the environment; and \n(ii) the Law on Desertification Prevention and Control mainly focuses on the actions of vegetation reconstruction to \nsolve  the  problems  of  wind  erosion,  but  does  not  address  soil  salinity,  acid  rain,  soil  pollution,  soil  fertility \ndegradation,  and  deterioration  of  soil  biological  and  physical  characters,  which  must  also  be  addressed  for  a \ncomprehensive solution. Work is under way to address these issues. \n\n8  Ningxia OP12-Executing Office (footnote 7). Similar work has been simultaneously prepared in six provinces and/or \n\nautonomous regions: Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia Hui, Qinghai, Shaanxi, and Xinjiang Uygur. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5 \n\nImproving rural incomes through agriculture-based livelihoods with greater choices is an \n11. \nimportant way to reduce poverty and provide an alternative to current unsustainable practices. \nOf  the  450,000  rural  residents  in  the  project  area,  approximately  74,000  have  been  resettled \nfrom  the  very  poor  southern  areas  of  Ningxia  in  six  villages,  known  as  poverty  communities. \nLocated on marginal lands between the alluvial soils of the Yellow River and the rocky piedmont \nzone  of  the  Helan  Mountains,  these  villages  have  a  higher  vulnerability  to  poverty  than  most \nother  rural  dwellers,  with  average  per  capita  income  of  between  the  equivalent  of  $0.41  and \n$0.56  per  day.  Approximately  73%  of  the  population  is  Hui  minority.  Their  per  capita  land \navailability and grain production is also lower than average. In some rural areas, a transition has \ncommenced  away  from  low-yielding  cereals  and  grazing  using  traditional  practices  to  higher-\nvalue  and  more  resource-efficient  industries  with  lower  water  demand  such  as  vineyards  and \nwine  making,  dairy,  halal  meat  products,  medicinal  herbs,  other  perennials,  and  greenhouse-\nbased  horticulture.  The  market  analysis  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A  shows  trends  toward \nincreasing consumption of these goods in general, and in niche markets for some of Ningxia\u2019s \nproducts  in  particular  (e.g.,  halal  market).  Commercial  enterprises  are  leading  this  transition, \nwith  processing,  marketing,  and  export  experience.  The  most  prominent  is  the  Ningxia  State \nFarm Group (NSFG), which either employs or has commercial links with approximately 45% of \nthe  rural  population.9 NSFG  and  several  other  state-owned  enterprises  have  the  capacity  to \nexpand their operations, and offer a range of market-oriented services and opportunities to the \nrural community, including the rural poor.  \n \n12. \nThe cultural, aesthetic, and wildlife habitat values of the ecosystems in the project area, \nwhich  offer  significant  benefits  if  well  protected,  have  eroded  over  time.  In  the  past,  wetlands \nwere  filled  in  to  support  agriculture  and  urban  growth;  on  the  remaining  water  bodies, \ncommercial exploitation took priority over conservation, threatening wildlife, and weakening vital \necosystem functions. These and other tourist venues have not attracted significant numbers of \nvisitors  nor  has  tourism  expanded  strongly  compared  with  neighboring  provinces  due  to  the \nlower quality of the tourism experience offered. Linking commercial enterprises owned by NSFG \nand  Yinchuan  Municipality  with  conservation  objectives  offers  a  good  opportunity  to  inject \nfinance to protect assets of significant value, and to diversify the livelihoods of rural people. \n \n13. \nGovernment Policies and Plans. The Government\u2019s development program is set out in \nthe PRC\u2019s 11th FYP (2006\u25002010). It aims to develop a harmonious society through a science-\nbased and people-centered development approach and continued economic reforms. The plan \nincludes  emphasis  on  resource  conservation,  environmental  protection,  cleaner  production \nsystems, and increased reliance on ecosystem rehabilitation processes. The western region will \nreceive continued attention to address poverty and regional economic imbalances. \n \n14. \nADB  Country  Partnership  Strategy. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy (2008\u25002010) \nemphasizes  continued  support  to  poorer  provinces  and  integrated  rural  development,  and  the \nPRC\u2019s contribution to protecting regional and global public goods.10 The Project supports ADB\u2019s \nstrategic concerns to improve the environment and promote balanced and inclusive growth, as \nset out in the strategy. Project activities are aimed at promoting sustainable rural development \nwith  an  emphasis  on  managing  ecosystems  and  addressing  rural  poverty  through  livelihood \nprograms.  \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n9  NSFG, a part of the Ningxia Agricultural Reclamation Bureau, occupies 78,957 hectares on 9 sites, or about 22% of \n\nthe project area.  \n\n10  ADB. 2008.

To address concerns about the performance of its own programs, \n15. \nand to gain from international experience, the Government entered a strategic partnership with \nGEF  and  other  international  partners  to  develop  and  increase  comprehensive  resource \nmanagement  approaches  that  integrate  the  ecological,  economic,  regulatory,  and  social \ndimensions of  the  land degradation  problem. Land  degradation  severely  endangers  the  PRC\u2019s \nrich  biodiversity,  especially  through  human  activities,  many  of  which  are  illegal  or  poorly \nmanaged  under  the  law  and  destroy  natural  habitats,  especially  through  land  conversion, \nindustrialization,  poor  management  of  water  resources,  and  deforestation.  ADB\u2019s  first  project \nunder  the  PRC\u2013GEF  Partnership  on  Land  Degradation  in  Dryland  Ecosystems,  the  Capacity \nBuilding to Combat Land Degradation Project,11 is ongoing in six provinces and/or autonomous \nregions: Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia Hui, Qinghai, Shaanxi, and Xinjiang Uygur. In Ningxia, \na  multiagency  task  force  prepared  a  provincial  strategy  and  action  plan  for  land  degradation \ncontrol using an IEM approach. In addition, a smaller legal, institutional, and policy review team \nassessed requirements of the legal and policy environment; its findings are incorporated in the \nstrategy.12 Appendix  2  provides  details  of  the  IEM  approach,  and  its  use  internationally  and  in \nthe Project.  \n \n16. \nIn  addition,  the  World  Bank  financed  nine  projects  in  education,  health,  infrastructure, \nand rural development; International Fund for Agricultural Development supported environment \nand  rural  development  projects;  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  supported  three \nprojects for communications, forestry, and education; United Nations Children\u2019s Fund supported \nprojects  for a  range  of social  welfare  improvements;  United  Nations Development  Programme \nsupported projects for agriculture and water resources; and World Food Programme supported \nfour projects (Appendix 3). \n \n17. \nLessons. ADB\u2019s agriculture, environment, and natural resource development projects in \ngeneral,  and  especially  in  the  PRC,  indicate  the  need  for  stakeholder  involvement  and \ncommunity  participation  in  planning  and  implementation,  as  well  as  close  coordination  among \nimplementing  agencies  and  the  private  sector.  Combating  land  degradation  in  the  PRC  has \nmostly  been  through  top-down  application  of  sector-by-sector  engineering  solutions.  In  the \nNHAR,  the  IEM  strategy  task  force  assessed  this  approach  to  be  expensive  and  lack \nsustainability.  Combating  land  degradation  is  effective  if  delivered  as  part  of  a  comprehensive \npoverty  reduction  framework,  particularly  in  areas  where  the  causality  between  degradation of \nfragile  ecosystems  and  poverty  incidence  is  evident.  A  recent  ADB  evaluation  shows  that \nsuccessful poverty reduction interventions link the poor to economic growth centers, commercial \nvalue-adding  enterprises,  and  associated  off-farm  employment  opportunities.13 To  address  the \npoverty-environment  nexus,  ADB  recently  suggested  that  interventions  to  improve  the \nproductivity of land and other natural resources through irrigation, better management of water, \nand  other  environment-related  interventions  would  impact  significantly  on  the  poor.  Poor \nfarmers typically work on low productive marginal land caused by insufficient moisture or other \nsoil  deficiencies  and  aggravated  by  changing  climate  patterns. 14 This  closely  describes  the \nsituation faced by the poverty communities that will be helped by the Project.  \n \n\n                                                 \n11 ADB.  2004.

In these countries, \nfrom the 1930s onward, bottom-up approaches bringing local farmers and/or graziers, scientists, \nbusiness,  and  government  agencies  together  to  solve  local  problems  have  proved  to  be \nsuccessful. Adequate incentives, controls, and financial resources to ensure that environmental \nfunctions and services were rehabilitated and maintained are essential. Large areas that were \nseverely degraded have been rehabilitated and are being used for sustainable agriculture and \nother  purposes,  yielding  higher  output  and  wealth  for  larger  populations  than  in  the  past. \nCommunity organizations, including farmer and water-user associations, and a clear legal and \nregulatory  framework  are  featured.  Market-based  solutions  that  link  rural  populations  with \nprocessors and markets are essential for viable livelihoods. \n \n19. \nA major international review of lessons on the functioning of dryland ecosystems and the \nlivelihood  systems  of  residents  concludes  that  an  integrative,  participatory  approach  that \naddresses land degradation, poverty, safeguarding biodiversity, and protecting cultural heritage \noffers  a  far  higher  probability  of  finding  sustainable  development  solutions  for  the  2.5  billion \nglobal  dryland  residents. 15  The  Project  will  adopt  a  holistic  IEM  approach  with  balanced \nemphasis  on  ecosystem  conservation  and  sustainable  rural \nlivelihoods.  This  requires \ninstitutional  capacity  for  implementation,  especially  when  new  concepts  and  technologies  are \nintroduced. Lessons from similar ADB projects are (i) the provincial government should provide \nthe  project  management  office  with  adequate  financial  and  staff  resources  to  ensure  strong \nownership;  (ii)  a  strong  lead  group  is  necessary  to  provide  leadership  and  guidance;  \n(iii)  commercial  projects  should  be  supported  only  if  an  entity  exists  to  financially  and \nto  promoting  rural  development;  \nmanagerially  back \n(iv)  commercial  operations  should  adopt  a  flexible  approach  and  be  sensitive  to  changes  in \nmarket  demand  and  prices;  and  (v)  consultants  are  required  to  support  institutional  capacity \nbuilding of the stakeholders involved, including project management. The Project will exchange \ninformation  with  other  projects  under  the  umbrella  of  the  PRC\u2013GEF  Partnership  on  Land \nDegradation in Dryland Ecosystems.  \n \n\nthe  proposal,  and \n\nis  committed \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \n20. \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  improved  environmental  management  to  rehabilitate \necosystems  and  increased  rural  incomes  in  the  Yinchuan  area.  An  increased  number  of \nsmallholders  and  poor  rural  communities  will  be  linked  to  enterprises  in  conservation-oriented \nindustries  to  provide  alternatives  to  current  agricultural  practices  that  are  damaging  to \necosystems.  Farmland  degradation  (e.g.,  soil  quality)  and  wetland  water  quality  will  be \nimproved,  and  conservation  agriculture  will  be  practiced  on  35,000  hectares  (ha)  of  farmland. \nThe wildlife conservation area will be approximately 115,360 ha; and wetland conservation will \nbe practiced on 8,825 ha. Visitors to tourism sites will expand to 1.1 million each year. \n \n\n                                                 \n15 Reynolds,  J.  et  al.  2007.

Three aspects will be covered: \n\nIEM  principles, \n\nthe  Project  will  establish  (a) \n\nPolicy,  legal,  and  regulatory  frameworks.16 To  enable  implementation  of  an \nIEM  approach, \nincluding \ncoordination  and  public  participation;  (b)  water  resource  zoning;  (c)  spatial \nplanning  for  land  and  water  use  regulations  according  to  ecosystem  capability; \n(d) creation and management of the Helan piedmont conservation management \narea  (HPCMA);  (e)  control  of  pesticide  and  fertilizer  usage  to  reduce  nonpoint \nsource  pollution;  (f)  a  water  pricing  mechanism  to  support  water  trading  in \nNingxia;  (g)  management  of  wetlands;  (h)  revenue-sharing  arrangements  for \nenterprises  operating  cultural  or \nfarming \narrangements  for  smallholder  farmers;  and  (j)  legal  recognition  of  rural  farmer \nand water-user associations, including contract services. With the assistance of \nspecialist  consultants,  NHARG  staff  will  prepare  the  necessary  policy  papers, \ndraft laws, and regulations for NHARG approval. These provisions will either be \nincorporated in the proposed regulations currently being drafted by NHARG for \nwetland management and the new implementation provisions for the Water Law \n(2002), or incorporated in an IEM policy to be issued by NHARG for the project \narea.  The  IEM  policy  will  be  followed,  in  the  later  stages  of  the  Project,  by \ncomprehensive  IEM  regulations  that  incorporate  the  main  principles  of  the  IEM \npolicy and lessons from project implementation. \n\n(i)  contractual \n\ntourism  sites; \n\n(i) \n\n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n16 The Project\u2019s work will complement and build from the Ningxia-wide policy and regulatory framework reforms that \ncommenced under the TA for Capacity Building to Combat Land Degradation Project (footnote 11). Improved land \ntenure and water rights arrangements for rural households are among the benefits from the proposed reforms. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9 \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nTraining  and  capacity  building. Increased coordination and integration will be \ndeveloped \nthrough  cross-sector  planning  sessions,  and  design  and \nimplementation  of  an  IEM  demonstration  area.  Training  and  study  tours  will  be \nprovided  to  build  institutional  capacity,  develop  skills,  and  provide  vocational \ntraining in the rural community. Based on a training needs assessment, specialist \nconsultants  and  qualified  training  institutions  will  deliver  the  training.17 Training \nconsultants  will  develop  short-term  domestic  training  courses  and  materials. \nAwareness building study tours will expose senior and midlevel managers to IEM \nconcepts and applications. Overall, 35 people will be included in study tours over \n4 years. A total of 76 stakeholder representatives will visit various programs and \napproaches throughout the PRC, including other IEM projects.18 \n\nInformation systems and monitoring. The Project will support development of \nthe  operating  capacity  of  the  NHARG  IEM  information  center.  All  agencies \nrepresented  in  the  provincial  project  management  office  (PPMO)  and  the  lead \ngroup will have access to ecosystem-relevant data through a signed data-sharing \nagreement.  The  public  will  have  free  access  to  the  data  through  a  web-based \nportal; 13 agencies signed an agreement to freely exchange data in April 2007. \nThe  ongoing  monitoring  and  evaluation  methods  being  developed  under  the \nCapacity Building to Combat Land Degradation Project will be used. Agreements \nto ensure use and analysis of data from  service providers including the Ningxia \nRemote Sensing Center, Land Degradation Data Center, and Ningxia University, \nwill be signed. \n\n \nProject  Management.  The  PPMO  has  been  established  under  the  Foreign  Debt \n25. \nManagement Office within the Ningxia Finance Department (NFD), and will be fully staffed once \nthe  Project  is  approved.  The  PPMO  provides  the  office  for  the  lead  group  and  will  be \nresponsible  for  overall  project  implementation  including  overall  planning,  coordination  of  work \nplans, financial management, technical support, stakeholder agency coordination, and reporting. \nIt  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  some  project  activities  including  (i)  IEM  institutional \nstrengthening, \nIEM \ndemonstration and, through the concerned stakeholder agencies, coordinating arrangements to \ndemonstrate new technologies for land management using conservation agriculture. The Project \nwill provide salaries and operating costs for the PPMO, including sector staff and a group of 10 \ntechnical  experts.  Training  will  be  provided \nfinancial  management, \ndisbursement, work planning, and reporting.  \n \n \n \n \n\nthe  HPCMA  management  plan;  and  (ii) \n\nincluding  preparation  of \n\nin  procurement, \n\n                                                 \n17 Training  providers  will  be  leading  universities  and  technical,  research,  and/or  extension  institutes  in  the  PRC, \nNHAR,  and  the  Asia  and  Pacific  region.  A  list  of  training  courses  has  been  agreed,  including  natural  resource \nmanagement,  conservation,  economic  valuation  of  resources  and  ecosystems,  market-based  resource \nmanagement,  ecological  development  and  business,  poverty  and  linkages  to  land  degradation,  water  use \nefficiency,  land  use  and  spatial  planning,  ecosystem  zoning,  management  objectives,  management  regulations, \nconservation agriculture, tourism planning, information and data management systems, natural resource policy, law \nand  regulations,  contract  farming,  market  chains  and  value  addition,  and  community  and  participatory  natural \nresource management. \n\n18 Possible  destinations  include  wetland  management  and  conservation-based  tourism  (Hong  Kong);  ecological \nmanagement  of  land  and  natural  resources  (Qinghai);  fodder,  silage,  and  livestock  production  systems  (Inner \nMongolia  and  Heilongjiang);  conservation  agriculture  in  dryland  agriculture  (Beijing  district);  and  the  World  Bank-\nfinanced Gansu and Xinjiang Pastoral Development Project, and Loess Plateau Watershed Rehabilitation Project. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nLand and Water Resource Management \n\nand \n\nConservation  Agriculture \n\n \n26. \nUnder this output, the Project will establish area planning and build instutional capacity \nto  address  resource  management  on  an  ecosystem  basis.  Interventions  include  (i)  integrated \nwater  resource  planning  and  spatial  planning;  (ii)  conservation  agriculture  demonstrations, \nfarmer field schools, and fertilizer management demonstrations; and (iii) improvement of water \nresource efficiency for 15,000 farmers. \n \nIntegrated  Water  Resource  Management  Plan  (IWRMP)  and  Spatial  Planning. \n27. \nNHARG  (through  the  Ningxia  Water  Resource  Department  [NWRD]  and  assisted  by \nconsultants)  will  prepare  an  IWRMP  within  the  first  2  years  of  the  Project.  This  will  assist  in \nbalancing demand and availability of water (surface and groundwater) and the potential reuse of \nwater,  in  accordance  with  a  long-term  water  conservation  strategy.  The  IWRMP  will  establish \nthe  policy  and  guide  water  investment.  It  will  be  updated  as  new  data  becomes  available.  A \nspatial  planning  framework  will  be  developed  and  implemented  under  the  leadership  of  the \nPPMO,  which  will  work  with  stakeholders  to  define  management  objectives,  management \nzones,  environmentally  sensitive  areas,  conservation  areas,  land  use  options,  and  programs \nneeded  to  achieve  these.  The  process  will  involve  local  participation,  field  assessments,  and \ncoordination between sectors. \n \nFertilizer  Management  Demonstrations.  \n28. \nDemonstrations  of  conservation  agriculture  for  smallholders  will  be  undertaken  at  three  sites \nincluding crop  residue mulching,  minimum  tillage,  crop  rotations,  and improved  pest  and  plant \nnutrient  management. 19 Work  will  build  on  existing  Ningxia  Agricultural  Reclamation  Bureau \n(NARB) demonstrations to increase the adoption of conservation agriculture outside the NSFG \nareas.  The  Project  will  train  trainers  and  then  work  through  existing  farmer  associations  and \nrural  cooperatives.  The  farmer  associations  will  have  linkages  to  machinery  cooperatives  and \nNSFG,  to  enable  smallholders  to  access  the  necessary  farm  equipment.  An  action  research \nprogram will apply site-specific nitrogen management and the economic use of fertilizer within \nthe  catchment  of  Shahu  Lake.  A  nitrogen  balance  model  will  be  developed  to  define  nitrogen \ncrop  demand,  identify  fertilizer  placement  technologies,  and  introduce  nitrogen  stripping \npractices  through  reed-bed  management.  Soil  and  water  testing  will  be  included  within  an \nintensive monitoring program that involves land users and farmer field schools. \n \n29.  Water Resource Efficiency. The Project will support design and construction of part of \nXixia  Canal,  including  15.1  km  of  inverted  siphon  past  the  protected  area  for  Xixia  tombs,  \n16  km  of  the  main  canal,  control  and  monitoring  stations,  21.3  km  of  new  secondary  canals,  \n118 km of secondary canals to be lined, and lining of 632 km of laterals and on-farm distribution. \nXixia  Canal  will  be  extended  (31.1  km)  to  replace  the  current  low-efficiency  Xigan  Canal,  and \nwill  serve  a  15,546  ha  irrigation  area.  The  increased  efficiency  will  enable  water  to  be \ntransferred  to  the  Yinchuan  wetlands,  plus  support  livelihood  development,  including  for  poor \ncommunities. The current irrigation area will be rehabilitated to ensure efficient water distribution \nthrough  canal  lining,  laser  leveling,  and  conversion  to  gravity-fed  irrigation.  To  strengthen \nirrigation  management,  the  Project  will  use  water  scheduling,  monitoring,  and  shorter  return \nperiods to reverse overwatering and salinization risks.  \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n19 The  three  sites  are  (i)  Zhengshaqu  village  in  Yongning  County  (for  spring  corn  trials),  (ii)  Tongchang  village  in \nHelan  County  (trials  for  intercropping  of  winter  wheat  and  silage),  and  (iii)  Xiaodianzi  village  of  Pingluo  County \n(trials for spring wheat and corn). This last site is related to the nitrogen management trials at Shahu Lake. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11 \n\n3. \n\nRural Livelihood Improvement \n\n \n30. \nThe  Project  will  develop  and  implement  sustainable  livelihood  programs  in  the  project \narea.20 Expanding  the  role  of  markets  to  improve  rural  incomes  in  industries  that  make  more \nefficient use of land and water is a vital part of the strategy to reduce ecosystem degradation. \nThrough  NARB,  Yinchuan  Municipality,  and  Ningxia  Administrative  Bureau,  the  Project  will \nsupport demonstrations of the Government\u2019s policy of industry supporting rural smallholders and \ncity to support rural as foreshadowed in the new socialist countryside policies of the 11th FYP. \nThe Project will support enterprises that link with smallholder producers and adopt more benign \nland use systems in higher value markets.  \n \n31. \nUnder  NARB,  beef,  dairy,  and  higher  value  horticultural  production  will  be  expanded \ninvolving  up  to  8,325  households:  (i)  The  existing  beef  herd  will  be  expanded  and  a  halal-\ncertified  beef  slaughterhouse  built.  The  genetic  quality  of  the  central  breeding  herd  will  be \nupgraded, and through artificial insemination services, the quality of smallholder animals will be \nimproved, along with a beef finishing feedlot, and smallholder beef breeding and rearing units. \n(ii) The existing dairy herd on Pingjipu State Farm will be split into five herds and the state farm \nwill  provide  cooperative  milking  platforms  with  breeding  and  technical  support  services  to \nprovide  milk  to  an  existing  milk  processing  plant.  All  livestock  operations  will  involve  the \nconversion  to  perennial  fodder  production  systems  requiring  less  water  and  soil  disturbance.  \n(iii) Up to 670 ha of existing flood-irrigated land will be converted to small contract viniculture to \nsupply  a  processing  facility,  and  market  through  the  existing  local  and  national  distribution \nnetwork.  The  viniculture  will  use  cover  crops  and  water-saving  irrigation  technologies  to \nincrease  the  sustainability  of  land  use.  These  enterprises  will  adopt  biogas,  biofertilizer,  and \nwater-recycling technology. \n \n32. \nIn  Yinchuan  Municipality,  the  Project  will  address  sustainable  land  management  and \npoverty  reduction  through  production  systems  for  up  to  9,800  households,  including  perennial \ncrops. Water and agrochemical use will be reduced compared to current practices. Vocational \nand  technical  training  will  be  provided  for  up  to  3,000  individuals,  including  through  NHARG\u2019s \nongoing programs. Based on past research into alternative cropping and irrigation systems on \nfragile soils on the margin of the piedmont zone, land currently cropped by poor households will \nbe  converted  into  sustainable  systems  where  crops  and  soil  types  are  more  appropriately \nmatched.21  \n \n33. \nUnder  Ningxia  Administrative  Bureau\u2019s  existing  state-owned  enterprise,  the  Project  will \nsupport development of a pilot district involving perennial crops such as Chinese dates (jujube) \nand  alfalfa  along  with  a  beef  feedlot,  contract  fodder,  and  livestock  production  systems  for \nresettled smallholders in poverty villages. Up to 4,680 households will be involved with intensive \nhousehold  production  systems  for  livestock,  fodder,  passive  solar  housing,  and  greenhouse \nproduction.  The  enterprise  will  develop  its  plant  propagation  business  and  infrastructure,  and \nprovide processing and market distribution services to smallholders. Vocational training will be \nprovided  to  give  local  people  new  skills  to  enable  them  to  better  compete  for  off-farm \nemployment.22 \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n20 The sustainable livelihoods approach of the Department for International Development was used in the design of \n\nthe Project. \n\n21 These activities are also called Yinxi alternative livelihoods.  \n22 These activities are also called high technology and ecological agriculture. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n4. \n\nEcosystem Conservation  \n\n \n34. \nThis output is designed to address the threats of further conversion and degradation of \nhabitat, and promote biodiversity conservation. It covers (i) Shahu and Yuehai lakes, (ii) Helan \nMountains  Nature  Reserve  and  its  extension  into  the  piedmont  zone,  (iii)  Yinchuan  wetlands, \nand  (iv)  Yinxi  wetlands.  At  these  sites,  commercial  tourism  will  be  balanced  with  ecosystem \nconservation, habitats for wild species, and preservation of cultural heritage sites and values.  \n \nThe  incorporation  of  conservation  values  will  enable  future  sustainable  use  and  build \n35. \npublic  awareness  of  wetland  functions,  conservation,  and  habitats.  On  NSFG-managed \nwetlands  at  Shahu  Lake,  activities  will  cover  revegetation,  galleries,  viewing  platforms  to  see \nwild  birds,  aquaculture,  and  tourist  accommodation  with  wastewater  treatment  and  a  scientific \neducation  center.  At  Yuehai  Lake,  activities  will  include  aquatic  plants  for  commercial  use,  a \nprocessing  plant  for  aquatic  vegetarian  food,  ecological  rehabilitation,  water  supply  and/or \nheating, and regreening of wetland landscapes. \n \nOn  three  sites  managed  by  Yinchuan  Municipality,  conservation  values  will  be \n36. \nincorporated  into  commercial  tourism  to  rehabilitate  and  protect  ecosystem  services  and \nfunctions,  protect  wildlife,  and  enhance  the  quality  of  tourism  experiences:  (i)  An  extended \nconservation management zone that unifies the current Helan Mountains Nature Reserve with \n53,150 ha of the piedmont zone will be set up as the HPCMA and managed for a biodiversity \nhabitat. Fencing and patrolling west of the new Xixia Canal will prevent illegal grazing, antiquity \ncollection,  and  poachers.  An  IEM  ecological  restoration  demonstration  center  and  support  for \nbiodiversity  conservation  will  emphasize  the  management  of  local  endangered  species  and \ntourism  impacts.  An  integrated  ecotourism  management  plan  will  be  prepared.  (ii)  At  the \nYinchuan  wetlands,  management  planning  and  monitoring  will  be  accompanied  with \nrehabilitation  of  vegetation  and  management  of  wetland  parks  for  recreation  and  sustainable \nuse  of  wetland  resources.  The  current  public  awareness  programs  will  be  upgraded  and \ninvestments  made  in  water  quality  management,  including  water  treatment.  The  Project  will \nsupport  the  existing  Mingcui  training  center  to  build  capacity  of  staff  of  wetland  management \nagencies.  (iii)  At  the  Yinxi  wetlands,  a  program  to  conserve  wildlife  habitats  and  improve  the \nquality of the wetlands will be introduced including restoration of 8,000 ha of natural grassland \nand protection of linked wetlands on each side of Xigan Canal with waterfowl habitat. \n\n \n5. \n\nGEF-Financed Project Activities  \n\n \nGEF  joint  cofinancing  will  support  a  multifocal  approach  to  conserving  biodiversity  and \n37. \ncombating land degradation.23 The GEF-financed activities will ensure that the IEM approach is \nfollowed  to  contribute  to  restoring  the  productive  and  protective  functions  of  ecosystem \nresources. An IEM approach will be followed for the protection of resident and migratory species \nand their grassland and wetland habitats; as well as for building the institutional and regulatory \ncapacity  to  rehabilitate,  sustainably  manage,  and  protect  the  ecosystems.  GEF  will  finance \ncomplementary  activities  in  each  of  the  four  outputs  to  ensure  that  incremental  global \nenvironmental  benefits  above  the  baseline  investment  are  achieved.  For  output  1,  GEF  will \n\n                                                 \n23 GEF operations programs 1, 2, 3, and 4 cover biodiversity conservation in arid and semi-arid regions, freshwater \necosystems,  forest  ecosystems,  and  mountain  ecosystems;  whereas  operations  program  15  covers  sustainable \nland management. Combined, these programs will support an IEM approach under the Project. Following changes \nin GEF\u2019s financial arrangements, OP12 for IEM no longer provides project financing. The GEF project proposal was \nconsidered  at  the  intercessional  council  meeting  in  July  2007.  However,  following  the  deletion  of  the \nsubcomponents relating to Xixia Tombs, Helankou Rock Drawings, and Jiangjun House, which involved a revision \nof  GEF\u2019s  financing  for  the  Project,  the  proposal  was  resubmitted  to  the  GEF  Council  in  March  2008,  and  its \napproval was obtained on 25 July 2008. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13 \n\nSpecial Features \n\nsupport institutional reform and capacity strengthening, reflecting the demonstration value to the \nNHAR  and  the  PRC.  GEF  will  support  equipment  costs  and  training  for  project  management \nand  consulting  services  related  to  the  introduction  of  improved  natural  resource  management, \nconservation  agriculture,  wildlife  conservation,  study  tours,  and  international  and  national \npostgraduate  studies.  For  output  2,  GEF  will  finance  the  IWRMP  and  spatial  planning \nprocesses, conservation agriculture demonstration sites, farmer training program, and fertilizer \nmanagement  demonstrations  reflecting  the  impact  this  is  expected  to  have  on  aquatic \nbiodiversity,  wetland  habitat  functions,  and  migratory  wildlife.  For  output  3,  GEF  will  support \ntraining  of  local  communities  in  appropriate  land  use  technologies,  vocational  training, \nintegrated planning systems, and development of conservation and public education programs. \nFor  output  4,  GEF  will  support  the  establishment  of  the  HPCMA  and  the  capacity  of  staff  to \nmanage  endangered  species;  biodiversity  habitat  protection  and  restoration  planting  programs \nfor  the  Yinxi  wetlands;  and  biodiversity  conservation  management  programs  including \nprotection, bird observation hides and boundary demarcation, and wetland training programs. \n \nC. \n \n38. \nThe  Project  is  under  the  PRC\u2013GEF  Partnership  on  Land  Degradation  in  Dryland \nEcosystems (footnote 6). It is governed by a country programming framework approved by the \nGEF  Council  at  its  Beijing  meeting  in  October  2002.  The  framework  covers  a  programmatic \napproach  over  10 years  (2003\u20132012)  and  seeks  to  combat  land  degradation,  reduce  poverty, \nand  conserve  biodiversity  through  capacity-building  investments  and  development  of  viable \nmodel IEM demonstration investment projects.24 As a comprehensive demonstration investment \nunder  the  PRC\u2013GEF  partnership,  the  Project  is  linked  to  a  network  in  the  PRC,  involving  11 \ngovernment  agencies;  six  provinces  and/or  regions;  policy,  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional \nreforms;  participatory  processes;  and  development  partner  cooperation.  It  is  part  of  a  planned \nlong-term  programmatic  approach,  and  will  provide  and  gain  feedback  and  information  from \nother  parts  of  the  PRC.  The  IEM  approach  is  well  grounded  in  international  experience  of \nsuccessful  dryland  rehabilitation  and  in  some  bilateral  assistance  projects  in  the  PRC.  It  is \nhighly  relevant  to  the  new  socialist  countryside  policies  for  rural  regeneration  under  the  11th \nFYP.  The  ongoing  Capacity  Building  to  Combat  Land  Degradation  Project  has  sensitized  the \nGovernment  to  IEM.  The  proceedings  of  an  international  workshop  on  IEM  endorsed  this \napproach  for  the  PRC,25 and  the  case  for  integrative  approaches  for  the  world\u2019s  drylands  is \nstrongly supported by a recent scientific review of worldwide evidence from the 1930s onward \n(footnote 15).  \n \nThe project area includes 68% of the vertebrate species and 42% of vascular plants in \n39. \nthe  NHAR,  with  the  alluvial  plain  of  the  Yellow  River  system  being  its  most  important  zone. \nFifteen  globally  threatened  species  exist,  of  which  nine  are  permanent  residents  and  six  are \nmigratory birds. GEF will support the protection of these globally threatened species and their \nhabitats, and build institutional capacity to rehabilitate and sustainably manage the ecosystems \nin the project area.  \n \n                                                 \n24 The  initial  focus  (2003\u20132005)  was  on  six  provinces  and/or  autonomous  regions  in  the  western  region  that  are \nnational priority areas and of global significance for land degradation control and biodiversity preservation: Gansu, \nInner Mongolia, Ningxia Hui, Qinghai, Shaanxi, and Xinjiang Uygur with a population of about 120 million. Eleven \ncentral government agencies are involved: Legislative Office of the State Council, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of \nFinance,  Ministry  of  Land  and  Resources,  Ministry  of  Science  and  Technology,  Ministry  of  Water  Resources, \nNational  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  Poverty  Alleviation  Office  of  the  State  Council,  State \nEnvironmental  Protection  Agency,  State  Forestry  Administration,  and  Working  Committee  for  Legislation  of  the \nNational People\u2019s Congress. During 2006\u25002012, the entire western region will be eligible. \n\n25 Jiang,  Z.  2006.  Integrated  Ecosystem  Management:  Proceedings  of  an  International  Workshop.

The loan will have a term of 25 years, including a grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  annum,  and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project  Agreements.  The \nGovernment  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \nthat these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any advice or \ncommunication from ADB. In addition to the ADB loan, which will finance 45.2% of total costs, a \ngrant of $4,545,000 from GEF will finance 2.0% of project costs. The Borrower of the loan will \nbe the PRC. The ADB loan proceeds will be made available to NHARG, which will onlend part \nof  the  loan  proceeds  to  NARB  and  the  Yinchuan  municipal  government  (subborrowers).  The \nonlending  will  be  on  the  same  financial  terms  and  conditions  as  those  of  the  ADB  loan,  with \nNHARG and the subborrowers bearing the exchange rate and interest rate variation risks, and \nperforming the obligations applicable in the Project Agreement, which will be made an integral \npart of the onlending agreements. The financing plan in Table 2 provides details of the project \nimplementing  agencies  (PIAs),  including  the  subborrowers,  which  will  be  responsible  for \nproviding the counterpart funds for the Project. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n26 The final amounts of the ADB loan and GEF grant were agreed following appraisal in 2007.  \n\n \n\n\fTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\n1.

NFD  has  already  formed  the  lead  group,  which  will  ensure \ncoordination across sectors and provide an important decision-making role for key project plans, \nstrategic decisions, and policy issues. NFD has also established the PPMO and assigned core \noffice staff members. The project organization chart is in Appendix 5. NFD will ensure that the \nPPMO is provided with an adequate number of full-time staff members and be the coordinating \npoint  for  project  implementation.  Development  of  IEM  capacity  will  be  undertaken  through  the \nPPMO, which was formed to provide coordination and leadership in IEM approaches, and will \ninvolve  all  stakeholder  agencies.  ADB  will  provide  training  on  project  administration  and \nfamiliarization with ADB\u2019s policies and procedures.  \n \n\n43. \nThe  PIAs,  including  Ningxia  Administrative  Bureau,  NARB,  NWRD,  and  Yinchuan \nMunicipality,  will  be  the  coordinating  bodies  for  implementation  as  each  will  use  a  range  of \nstate-owned  enterprises,  and  state-sponsored  and  public  sector  bureaus  as  project \nimplementation units (PIUs) to implement the subprojects. Twelve PIUs, as well as the PPMO, \nwill implement the 23 subprojects. The implementation capacity of the PIUs was assessed. \n \n \n \n44. \nThe project implementation schedule is in Appendix 6.  \n \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  6  years  from  November  2008  to  October  2014. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \nGoods, related services, and civil works financed partly or wholly by ADB and GEF will \n45. \nbe procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime) and the procurement plan described in Appendix 7, which will be reviewed and updated on \nan annual basis. Contract packages for goods and related services exceeding $1,000,000 will \nbe  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international  competitive  bidding  or  limited  international  bidding, \nwhile  those  costing  between  $100,000  and  $1  million  will  be  awarded  through  national \ncompetitive bidding. Contracts below $100,000 will be procured through shopping. For contracts \nbelow  $10,000,  direct  contracting  can  be  used.  Civil  works  contracts  costing  more  than  \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n$10  million  will  be  procured  using  international  competitive  bidding,  while  those  valued  at  the \nequivalent of $10 million or less can be procured using national competitive bidding procedures \nacceptable  to  ADB.  Small-scale  works  and  contracts  in  rural  areas  may  be  awarded  using \ncommunity participation procedures. The selection of suppliers and/or contractors and award of \ncontracts will be subject to ADB approval.27 The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998,  as  amended  to  date)  will  be  included  in  all  procurement  documents  and  contracts.  A \nprocurement plan setting out an indicative list of all procurement packages and the procurement \nmethods is provided in Appendix 7.  \n \n46. \nThree  PPMO  staff  will  be  assigned  procurement  management  activities,  including \nmonitoring  of  the  procurement  plan  and  coordinating  procurement  activities  under  the  Project. \nMeasures to strengthen the capacity of PPMO staff in undertaking procurement activities will be \nimplemented,  including  the  engagement  of  project  management  consultants,  financed  by  the \nGEF  grant,  to  provide  training  on  procurement  and  other  aspects  of  project  implementation. \nPPMO staff will be nominated to attend ADB-sponsored courses and seminars on procurement \nand project implementation. NFD will appoint a procurement agent to help with procurement and \nto ensure compliance with ADB policies and procedures, on terms and conditions satisfactory to \nADB. \n\n \n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n47. \nThe  Project  will  finance  three  consulting  packages.  Package  A,  financed  by  the  GEF \ngrant,  will  comprise  4  international  and  7  national  person-months  of  individual  consultants  to \nstrengthen  the  project management  capabilities  of  the  PPMO.  ADB  will  be  responsible  for  the \nselection  with  concurrence  of  NHARG  and  the  PPMO  for  contract  negotiations  and  contract \nmanagement.  Package  B,  financed  under  the  GEF  grant,  will  comprise  a  team  of  12 \ninternational  and  77  national  person-months  to  provide  technical  specialists.  In  selecting  the \nfirm, the quality- and cost-based selection method, with a quality-cost weighing of 80:20, will be \nused and short-listed firms will be required to submit simplified technical proposals. The PPMO \nwill be responsible for the selection, contract negotiations, and contract management. Package \nC,  financed  under  the  loan,  will  comprise  11  international  and  16  national  person-months  of \nindividual consulting services in the field of water resource management to be financed directly \nfrom the loan. Individual consultant selection will be applied. The PPMO will be responsible for \nthe  selection,  contract  negotiations,  and  contract  management.  A  summary  of  all  consulting \npackages is included in Appendix 8 while detailed terms of reference for consulting services are \nin  Supplementary  Appendix  C.  All  recruitment  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Procurement and Retroactive Financing  \n\n \nNHARG requested and ADB approved a provision for advance contracting for consulting \n48. \nservices. NHARG also requested retroactive financing for civil works, equipment, and services; \nsetting  out  the  details  in  a  written  request  to  ADB.  ADB  advised  NHARG  that  retroactive \nfinancing could only apply to up to 20% of the ADB loan in respect of expenditures incurred not \nearlier  than  12  months  before  the  signing  of  the  Loan  Agreement.  Further,  all  contracts \nproposed  for  retroactive  financing  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines. Advance action will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof  Consultants  and  Procurement  Guidelines.  The  Government  and  NHARG  were  advised  that \n\n                                                 \n27 ADB  will  require  the  PPMO  to  use  ADB-approved  standard  bidding  documents  to  ensure  high  quality  and \n\nconsistency, and to facilitate ADB review. This is reflected in the project administration memorandum. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17 \n\napproval  of  the  advance  action  and  retroactive  financing  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the \nProject.  \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n \n49. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  NHARG,  NFD,  and  the  PIAs.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB and GEF in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of \nADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  executing  agency;  PIAs;  and  all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. The \nproject  design  and  implementation  arrangements  provide  for  mitigating  corruption  risks.  Risks \nassociated with project management, including procurement and disbursement, will be mitigated \nby  (i)  engaging  an  international  consultant  and  a  national  consultant  to  advise  and  assist  in \nprocuring  goods  and  services,  and  engaging  other  consultants;  (ii)  introducing  a  dual  signing \nsystem  requiring  the  civil  works  contractor  awarded  the  contract  to  sign  an  anticorruption \ncontract  with  the  employer;  and  (iii)  requiring  periodic  inspection  by  the  PPMO  of  the \ncontractor\u2019s activities related to fund withdrawals and settlements. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \n50. \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). Since many of the payments will be made for \nlarge  contracts,  direct  payment,  reimbursement,  and  commitment  procedures  will  be  used  to \nwithdraw  funds  from  the  loan  account.  To  expedite  the  flow  of  funds  and  simplify  document \nprocessing,  the  statement  of  expenditure  procedure  may  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible \nexpenditures for any individual payment not exceeding $100,000. The payments exceeding the \nstatement  of  expenditure  ceiling  will  be  reimbursed  based  on  a  full  documentation  process. \nBefore  disbursement  for  any  activity,  the  Government  will  have  certified  to  ADB  that  the \nonlending  agreement,  which  will  include  the  terms  and  conditions  required  under  the  Loan \nAgreement, has been duly executed and delivered on behalf of NHARG and the subborrowers, \nand is fully effective and binding upon the parties in accordance with its terms. GEF grant funds \nwill  be  channeled  through  ADB.  To  expedite  the  disbursement  of  the  loan  and  GEF  grant \nproceeds, the Government will set up two imprest accounts, one for the loan proceeds and one \nfor  the  GEF  grant,  in  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB.  Disbursements  from  the  imprest \naccounts will be supported by an appropriate withdrawal application and related documentation. \nThe  initial  amounts  to  be  deposited  in  each  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  the  estimated \nexpenditures  for  the  next  6  months  or  10%,  respectively,  of  the  loan  amount  and  GEF  grant, \nwhichever is lower.  \n \n51. \nThe  PPMO  requires  additional  capacity  and  experience  to  deal  efficiently  with  the \noperation  and  withdrawal  procedures  necessary  for  the  operation  of  the  imprest  accounts. \nAccordingly, assistance and training will be provided so that PPMO staff can expedite loan and \nGEF grant disbursements. An assessment of the financial management capability of NFD and \nthe  PIAs  and  the  specific  arrangements  for  managing  the  project  funds  are  provided  in \nSupplementary Appendix D. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n8. \n \n52. \nAll agencies involved in project implementation will maintain records and accounts that \nidentify  goods  and  services  from  loan  proceeds  and  the  GEF  grant,  financing  resources \nreceived,  expenditures  incurred,  and  use  of  local  funds.  These  records  and  accounts  will  be \nestablished and maintained in accordance with sound accounting principles and internationally \naccepted accounting standards, and with the PRC\u2019s Accounting Law. The PPMO will review and \nconsolidate  these  accounts  and  have  them  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound \naccounting practices by the sovereign audit agency of NHARG or other auditors acceptable to \nADB. The audits will be carried out in accordance with the regulations for auditing approved by \nthe State Council and ADB. The audit report will include a statement verifying whether or not the \nfunds disbursed by ADB were used for the purposes for which they were provided, as well as a \nseparate  auditor\u2019s  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  statement  of  expenditures \nprocedures. The PPMO will submit copies of the audited accounts and auditor\u2019s report to ADB \nwithin  6  months  after  the  end  of  each  financial  year.  The  PPMO  will  prepare  consolidated \nsemiannual  reports  indicating  progress  made,  problems  encountered  during  the  period,  steps \ntaken  or  proposed  to  remedy  the  problems,  proposed  program  of  activities,  and  progress \nexpected for the next 6 months. Both the loan and GEF grant will be covered in these reports. \nWithin 6 months of physical completion of the Project, the PPMO will submit a completion report \nto  ADB  describing  achievements  in  relation  to  the  Project\u2019s  expected  impact,  outcome,  and \noutputs.  \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \nTo monitor the progress of the Project in achieving the expected outcome and outputs, \n53. \nthe  PPMO  will  establish  and  maintain  a  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS) \ndesigned  to  permit  adequate  flexibility  to  adopt  remedial  action  regarding  project  design, \nschedules,  activities,  and  development  impacts.  The  PPMS  will  adopt  the  following  agreed \nindicators  (i)  project  progress,  (ii)  enabled  framework  improvements  (harmonization  of  policies \nand  regulations,  and  clear  institutional  mandates),  (iii)  results  of  capacity  development,  \n(iv)  IEM  capacity-building  performance,  (v)  progress  toward  demonstration  and  field  targets,  \n(vi)  environment  improvements,  and  (vii)  related  social  impacts  of  the  Project.  At  project \ninception,  the  PPMO,  in  consultation  with  each  subborrower  and  with  the  assistance  of  the \nconsultants,  will  develop  comprehensive  PPMS  procedures  to  establish  baseline  values  and \nsystematically  generate  data  on  inputs  and  outputs  of  the  project  activities;  and  the \nsocioeconomic, agricultural, and environmental indicators to measure project impacts.  \n \n54. \nThe  PPMO  will  refine  the  PPMS  framework,  confirm  achievable  targets,  firm  up \nmonitoring  and  recording  arrangements,  and  establish  systems  and  procedures  no  later  than  \n6 months after commencing project implementation. The PIAs will report baseline and progress \ndata  at  the  requisite  time  intervals  to  the  PPMO,  including  annual  reporting  on  the \nenvironmental  management  plan  (EMP).  The  PPMO  will  be  responsible  for  analyzing  and \nconsolidating the reported data through its management information system, and reporting the \noutcome to ADB through semiannual progress reports.  \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n55. \nIn addition to regular monitoring reports, project performance will be reviewed twice per \nyear for the first 3 years and once a year thereafter, jointly by ADB and NHARG. The review will \n(i) assess implementation performance and achievement of progress toward project outcomes \nand outputs, and financial progress, (ii) identify issues and constraints affecting implementation, \nand  (iii)  work  out  a  time-bound  action  plan  for  their  resolution.  ADB  and  the  Government  will \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19 \n\nundertake  a  midterm  review  to  assess  implementation  status  and  take  appropriate  measures \nincluding modification of scope and implementation arrangements, and reallocation of loan and \ngrant proceeds, as appropriate, to achieve the Project\u2019s expected impact.  \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\n \nA. \n \nThe Project\u2019s strategy for achieving benefits and impacts has four aspects: (i) building on \n56. \nthe  success  of  commercial  and  state-owned  enterprises  (mostly  within  the  NSFG  group)  and \ntheir  links  to  local,  national,  and  international  markets  and  supply  chains;  (ii)  investment  and \ninstitutional links between these enterprises and poor and marginalized smallholders who do not \nhave  market  opportunities  and  whose  basic  needs  result  in  degradation  of  the  environment;  \n(iii) support for programs that provide skills for the rural labor force thus enabling surplus labor \nto  move  into  nonfarm  work;  and  (iv)  development  of  plans  and  institutions  to  support  the \ntransition  from  a  predominantly  rural  society  to  an  urban  and  industrial  society,  and  the \nchanging demands on land and ecological services. The transition from traditional low-yielding \nand  polluting  agricultural  practices  used  to  produce  grains  to  cleaner  and  more  resource-\nefficient  industries  such  as  greenhouse-based  horticulture,  vineyards  and  winemaking,  other \nperennial  crops;  livestock  products;  and  medicinal  herbs  for  higher-value  and  export  markets \nhas  already  begun,  as  has  tourism.  The  Project  will  support  this  transition.  Conservation \nagriculture  has  commenced  and  will  be  significantly  expanded  under  the  Project.  NHARG  is \nkeen to use the Project to demonstrate that the environment can be rehabilitated in ways that \nwill  bring  income  benefits  to  rural  people  and  ensure  the  effective  conservation  of  ecosystem \nservices,  functions,  and  values  for  future  generations.  The  Project\u2019s  water  resources  and \nlivelihood  improvement  components  will  directly  benefit  some  10%  of  the  land  and  up  to  an \nestimated  46,400  households  or  32%  of  the  rural  population  in  the  project  area.  Improved \nprotection  and  conservation  management  and  conservation  agriculture  will  be  practiced  on \n35,000 ha of farmland, in the Helan Nature Reserve, and on 124,185 ha of wetlands and wildlife \nconservation areas. \n \n57. \nThe  Project  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  rural  livelihoods  through  added  income  to \nindividual rural households from increased annual production of milk (23,800 tons); beef (6,760 \ntons); wine (5,000 tons); Chinese dates (14,000 tons); wolfberry (2,250 tons); grapes and other \nfruits (more than 30,000 tons); fodder (48,000 tons); and production of vegetables, mushrooms, \nmedicinal  herbs,  and  cut  flowers.  Rural  households  and  the  previously  resettled  poor \ncommunities will gain production and supply contracts, with greater certainty of land tenure and \nirrigation services through contracts with enterprises in the case of beef, dairy, perennial crops, \nand ecological agriculture. \n \nProject activities will enhance the environment and improve the habitats of Shahu Lake, \n58. \nYuehai Lake, and Yinchuan City wetlands; and lead to increased visitor numbers and revenues. \nBiodiversity  conservation  benefits  will  accrue  through  restored  habitat  and  protection  for  wild \nplants  and  animals,  including  15  globally  threatened  species  of  birds,  mammals,  and  the \nChinese softshell turtle.  \n \n\n1. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\nSeparate  financial  analysis  was  carried  out  for  11  activities.  For  the  remaining  12 \n59. \nactivities, costs were estimated but direct benefits were not quantified. Financial indicators were \nestimated  for  10  activities,  with  financial  internal  rates  of  return  above  the  weighted  average \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\ncost  of  capital  calculated  for  9  of  them.  This  indicated  their  financial  viability.28 The  financial \ninternal rate of return for the Yinchuan City wetlands was only 0.7%, but this is regarded as a \nvaluable public good by Yinchuan Municipality, which will provide financial subsidies to ensure \nsustainability. No financial internal rate of return was estimated for the overall Project. \n \n60. \nRural  livelihood  improvement  will  significantly  impact  the  incomes  of  most  participating \nhouseholds.  A  range  of  activities  is  included  to  increase  household  incomes  by  between \nCNY2,537  and  CNY37,200  per  year.29 About  10,000  of  households  expected  to  participate  in \nthe Project are currently classified as poor and additional income from project-related activities \nis expected to raise these households out of poverty. Estimated household incremental incomes \nare  above  the  poverty  line  (CNY1,000  per  capita  per  year  in  Yinchuan  Municipality);  these \nexclude  beef  production,  which  is  a  secondary  activity  in  household  farming  and  so  does  not \nrepresent the full household income. Details on the financial analyses are in Appendix 9.  \n \n\n2. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nEconomic  analysis  was  carried  out  for  10  activities  and  the  Project.  Six  are  concerned \n61. \nwith  agricultural  production,  with  benefits  primarily  in  the  form  of  increased  crop  or  livestock \noutputs, and five are wetlands or cultural sites for which measurable benefits are increases in \nvisitor  numbers  and  tourism-related  revenues.  Benefit  estimates  are  based  on  data  capturing \nthe  current  situation  and  on  conservative  assessments  of  future  scenarios  with  the  Project  in \nplace. With- and without-project scenarios are identified. In the project scenarios, particularly for \nagriculture, ongoing damaging practices that lead to ecosystem degradation mean that current \nproduction will likely only be maintained with increasing inputs and costs in the future. Declining \nreturns are likely in the absence of the Project, but these are not included in the without-project \nassumptions. This suggests that for agriculture, project benefits are likely to be underestimated. \nIn  addition  to  the  quantified  benefits  included  in  the  project  financial  and  economic  analyses, \nenvironmental, ecosystem, cultural, and heritage benefits will be generated. \n \n62. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  whole  Project,  including  all  23  activities,  is \nestimated at 14.4% and the net present value at CNY201.4 million. The economic internal rates \nof return for the 10 activities for agriculture and wetlands vary widely, although most are in the \nrange of 13\u201317%. The highest economic internal rates of return are for horticultural viniculture \n(44.5%) and Yuehai Lake (40.3%) subprojects. Yinxi alternative livelihood is 11.3%, but has the \ngreatest  poverty  reduction  impact  so  is  justifiable  on  that  basis.  The  Yinchuan  City  wetlands \ninvestment  is  justified  on  the  basis  of  environmental  protection  benefits,  including  its  role  in \nsupporting  a  unique  and  permanent  collection  of  indigenous  plants  in  the  botanical  garden. \nDetails on the economic analyses are in Appendix 9. \n \n\n3. \n\nSustainability \n\n63. \nThe  Project\u2019s  overall  sustainability  will  be  assisted  by  investments  to  either  generate \nlarge  revenue  streams  to  support  ongoing  operations  or  count  on  the  support  of  NHARG \nagencies  that  are  strongly  committed  to  project  success  should  revenue  shortfalls  occur. \nOngoing fiscal implications for NHARG will be limited. Thirty-five percent of project investments \nwill be made by experienced commercial enterprises that are fully responsible for the financial \noperation  of  the  investment.  NWRD  will  fund  18%  of  investments  in  the  water  resource  area \nusing water fees to cover ongoing operation and maintenance costs. Yinxi alternative livelihoods \naccounts  for  26%  of  project  investments  and  will  incur  low  ongoing  costs  since  new  crops \nestablished under the Project will be operated by individual households.  \n                                                 \n28 The weighted average cost of capital is 4.0%.  \n29 These estimates assume no opportunity cost for household labor applied in project-related activities. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n21 \n\nSocial and Environmental Dimensions \n\nB. \n \n\n1. \n\nSocial Benefits and Poverty \n\n \nThe Project targets rural poor communities and large numbers of rural smallholders in an \n64. \nethnic  minority  region.  Of  the  74,000  previously  resettled  people  from  the  very  poor  southern \narea  of  Ningxia,  approximately  73%  are  Hui  Muslims.  They  reside  in  four  of  six  resettlement \ntownships:  Liangtian,  Mingning,  Naliangtaizi,  and  Xingjing.  From  the  livelihood  survey \ncompleted  during  the  TA  (footnote  1),  the  communities  are  poor  and  have  low  economic \ndevelopment due to low education, especially among women; access to poor quality land with \nhigh  irrigation  costs;  and  heavy  reliance  on  off-farm  income.  Project  design  has  specifically \nincluded contract farming, processing, and alternative livelihoods through links with enterprises, \nvocational  and  technical  training,  and  increased  irrigation  efficiency  measures  to  benefit  these \ncommunities. A gender plan described in Appendix 10 will be developed during implementation. \nNo negative impacts are anticipated for Hui people.  \n \nOverall, up to an estimated 46,400 households will benefit, with the majority of these Hui \n65. \nfrom  previously  resettled  poor  communities,  including  up  to  5,200  individuals  who  will  benefit \nfrom  employment.  The  Project  will  train  approximately  2,200  individuals  in  technical  subjects, \n5,500  farmers  in  field  schools  and  a  demonstration  program  on  conservation  agriculture,  and \nsome  3,000  rural  poor  in  vocational  training  through  which  additional  livelihood  options  will \ndevelop.  Adverse  consequences  are  minor  and  come  from  land  acquisition  for  the  Project. \nThese  will  be  mitigated  by  compensation  payments  and  provision  of  replacement  houses,  if \nnecessary, as per a resettlement plan that will be updated in the final design. Demonstration of \nnew  conservation  agriculture  approaches  to  land  use  management  will  improve  water-use \nefficiency; while integrated pest and nutrient management will aid beneficiaries\u2019 integration into \nhigher-value  market  chains  and  enable  households  to  attain  higher  incomes,  reduce \nvulnerability,  and  increase  their  participation  in  rural  decision  making.  Project-related  human \ncapital  investments  for  rural  households  provided  as  skills  and  vocational  training  will  support \nthe orderly movement of labor into off-farm employment. \n \n\nLand Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement \n\n2. \n \n66. \nFor  the  construction  of  Xixia  Canal,  compensation  will  be  paid  for  (i)  permanent \nacquisition of 18 ha of  orchards and irrigated farmland, and 246.7 ha  of woodland, grassland, \nand  wasteland;  and  (ii)  temporary  acquisition  of  9.3  ha,  including  0.5  ha  of  orchards.  For  the \nirrigation rehabilitation, 34 ha will be temporarily acquired during construction. The owners will \nbe compensated and these lands will be restored and returned to owners once construction is \ncomplete.  A  short  resettlement  plan  was  prepared,  endorsed  by  the  PPMO,  and  posted  on \nADB\u2019s website, covering all the temporary or permanent impacts; it has been disclosed to those \naffected. About 770 households (approximately 3,260 people) will be impacted to a very limited \nextent. The impacts will be confirmed once final project design is completed. The resettlement \nplan will be updated and disclosed to those affected and submitted to ADB for approval prior to \naward  of  civil  works  contracts.  Compensation  payments  and  cost-based  entitlements  will  be  a \nprecondition  for  the  commencement  of  civil  works.  The  estimated  cost  of  resettlement  is  $2.6 \nmillion  equivalent,  including  contingencies.  The  Project  includes  provision  for  external \nresettlement  monitoring  and  reporting.  In  addition,  the  PPMO  will  report  to  ADB  on  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  issues  each  quarter  and  at  project  completion.  The  summary \nresettlement plan is included in Appendix 11. \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\n3. \n\nEnvironmental Impact \n\n \n67. \nThe  project  investments  have  a  range  of  positive  impacts  on  the  environment  through \nchanges  in  land,  water,  wetlands,  and  conservation  management  practices.  The  Project  is \ncategorized as environment category A, following the realignment of the Xixia Canal extension \nto  bypass  Xixia  tombs  within  the  priority  protection  area  of  the  tombs.  Environmental  impacts \nare  addressed  by  10  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs),  one  environmental  impact \nassessment  (EIA),  and  a  consolidated  summary  EIA  (posted  on  ADB\u2019s  website  on  28  May \n2007),  including  a  consolidated  EMP.  The  aesthetics  of  Xixia  tombs  will  be  protected  through \nthe use of an inverted siphon. Key environmental issues relate to wastewater from agricultural \nprocessing  and  livestock  enterprises,  which  will  be  addressed  through  water  treatment  and \nprocessing,  particularly  animal  waste  treatment  using  biodigesters  and  biofertilizer  treatments. \nProject environmental assessments provide strategies to avoid, manage, and mitigate adverse \nimpacts,  and  recommend  monitoring  to  be  undertaken  during  implementation.  The  PPMO  will \nreport  on  the  findings  of  the  monitoring  programs  semiannually.  Final  detailed  designs  will  be \nsubject  to  final  IEE  and  EIA  scrutiny,  and  will  be  reported  to  ADB  for  its  concurrence  and \napproval. \n \nC. \n\nRisks \n\nThe Project will adopt an integrated approach to address land degradation and related \n68. \nissues, and to plan and implement project activities. In the past, sector-specific approaches to \nland degradation have generally been unsuccessful. For the project impact and outcomes, risks \ninclude  (i)  the  IEM  approach  may  be  ineffective  as  Yinchuan  City  and  NHARG\u2019s  economic \ngrowth  ambitions  overwhelm  a  reasonable  balance  between  growth  and  environmental \nrehabilitation and protection, leading to further ecosystem deterioration; and (ii) climate change \nreduces  available  water  resources,  especially  from  the  Yellow  River.  These  risks  can  be \nmitigated  in  part  by  planning,  monitoring,  and  enforcing  appropriate  policies  and  regulations. \nMeasures that reduce water use per unit of agricultural production are especially valuable and \nare  supported  by  the  Project.  Raising  stakeholder  awareness  and  incorporating  conservation \nvalues  into  land-use  planning,  farming  practices,  and  wetland  management  are  essential. \nLeaders  acting  as  high-profile  champions  who  advocate  appropriate  policy  settings  are  also \nimportant.  Other  risks  facing  project  management  and  implementation  include  (i)  lack  of \nfamiliarity with ADB policies and procedures, (ii) changes in PPMO personnel, (iii) bureaucratic \nand lengthy procurement decision making, (iv) inadequate management capacity compounding \ndelays,  and  (v)  procurement  fraud  and  corruption.  To  mitigate  these  risks,  the  Project  will \nprovide technical and management advisory support and training, particularly during the first 2 \nyears of implementation.                                             \n                                                                \n69. \nThe multifaceted character of the Project limits its financial and economic risks. The risks \nto individual subprojects may be significant, but all are unlikely to occur; the overall project risk \nis low. Market risks include (i) excess production could lower local prices and reduce returns to \nhouseholds; this would be more likely if local production is not adequately connected to market \ndistribution chains; and (ii) tourism demand could fail to grow as expected due to congestion or \nother  negative  impacts.  These  risks  will  be  mitigated  through  planning  and  coordination  of \nproducers,  in  particular,  through  market  diversification,  and  with  coordinated  tourism  sector \nplanning.  Technical  activity  risks  are  addressed  by  (i)  ensuring  appropriate  contractual \nrelationships  are  in  place;  and  (ii)  providing  for  adequate  review,  technical  assessment,  and \nmonitoring. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n23 \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n70. \nthe following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government, NHARG, and NFD have given \n\n \n1. \n\nIEM Policy in the Project Area \n\n \n71. \nNHARG  will  issue,  within  5  years  of  commencement  of  the  Project,  the  IEM  policy, \nsatisfactory  to  ADB,  which  will  incorporate  for  the  project  area  (i)  the  recommendations  of  the \nStrategy and Action Plan on Combating Land Degradation in Ningxia (final report); (ii) principles \nof the IEM approach for the NHAR, including the items in para. 24 (i) (a), (c), (h), (i), and (j); and \n(iii) guidance to government agencies on the use of IEM practices in their area of responsibility \n \n72. \nrecommendations and findings for implementation of the IEM policy. \n\nThe  PPMO  will,  prior \n\nthe  Project,  submit \n\nto  completion  of \n\nto  NHARG \n\nits \n\n \n73. \nNHARG  will  formulate  and  gradually  apply  principles  of  conservation  agriculture  within \nthe  policy  for  the  whole  project  area  based  on  an  IEM  approach  to  address  land  degradation \ncontrol. \n \n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental Management  \n\n \nNHARG will, within 3 years of the commencement of the Project, or such other period as \n74. \nwill be agreed between NHARG and ADB, prepare and submit legislation recommendations to \nthe  Standing  Committee  of  the  People\u2019s  Congress  of  the  NHAR,  which  will  include  draft \nregulations  relating  to  wetlands  management,  and  draft  regulations  on  water  resource  zoning, \nsatisfactory to ADB. \n \n75. \nNHARG will, within 3 years of the commencement of the Project, or such other period as \nwill be agreed between NHARG and ADB, prepare and submit legislation recommendations to \nthe  Standing  Committee  of  the  People\u2019s  Congress  of  the  NHAR,  which  will  include  draft \nregulations relating to implementation of the National Water Law (2002), and regulations on the \ncontrol of pesticide and fertilizer usage to reduce nonpoint source pollution, satisfactory to ADB. \n \nNHARG will ensure that, by no later than 31 December 2008, the HPCMA (west of the \n76. \nXixia Canal) will be classified and gazetted as a provincial nature reserve and not be used for \nfuture  activities  that  will  damage  the  original  ecological  environment,  including  agricultural, \nforestry, production, or industrial use. \n \n77. \nOn  the  basis  of  monitoring  methods  to  be  agreed  between  NWRD  and  ADB,  and  in \naccordance with the IWRMP, NHARG will ensure that the provision of Xixia Canal will not result \nin any increased water extraction from the Yellow River for the irrigation system including Meili, \nYaojin, Xigan, and Xixia canals. \n \n78. \nNHARG,  through  NWRD,  within  18  months  of  the  commencement  of  the  Project,  will \nprepare and issue the IWRMP, including a water pricing mechanism to support water trading in \nthe NHAR, satisfactory to ADB. NHARG will ensure that the necessary regulations with respect \nto  implementation  of  the  IWRMP  will  be  incorporated  in  the  draft  regulations  relating  to  the \nimplementation of the National Water Law (2002) as referred to in para. 75.  \n \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation \n\n \n79. \nNHARG  will  establish  the  lead  group,  which  will  ensure  overall  coordination  between \nsectors and agencies. The lead group will be chaired by the governor of Ningxia (or his and/or \nher  representative).  Membership  will  comprise  those  in  charge  of  each  of  the  concerned \ndepartments  of  the  NHAR  including  finance,  forestry,  agricultural  and  animal  husbandry,  and \nwater  resources;  and  representatives  of  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  Environment \nProtection Bureau, Yinchuan Municipality, NARB, and Ningxia Administrative Bureau. The main \nresponsibilities of the lead group include (i) approve important policies and principles relating to \nIEM; (ii) review project plans and ensure that all activities are in accordance with IEM; (iii) refer \ntechnical  plans  and  sector  plans  to  sector  experts  for  review;  (iv)  approve  final  project  work \nplans,  enable  coordination,  and  improve  interagency  communications;  and  (v)  provide \nleadership and guidance to the IEM spatial planning programs. The lead group will meet each \nquarter during implementation and such other times as may be necessary. It will be supported \nby a lead support group which, for the duration of the Project, will be the PPMO.  \n  \nNFD has established the PPMO, which will have a dual role of managing the Project and \n80. \nproviding necessary support to the lead group. The PPMO will be adequately staffed once the \nProject is approved with full-time personnel to properly carry out the tasks assigned to it under \nthe Project. The PPMO will be equipped with skill sets and resources: (i) project administration \nincluding  planning,  financial  management,  and  project  management;  (ii)  sector  focal  points for \neach  of  the  PIAs;  and  (iii)  a  group  of  technical  experts  who  can  review  plans,  proposals,  and \ninvestments to ensure technical correctness and coordination with the relevant departments and \nagencies.  International  and  national  consultants  will  conduct  their  research  and  consultancy \nwork  under  the  direction  of  the  PPMO.  Following  completion  of  the  Project,  the  PPMO  will \ncontinue its role of supporting the lead group. \n \n81. \nthat such onlending in all cases is on the same terms and conditions as the ADB loan. \n \n82. \nNHARG will take all necessary measures to ensure that all the PIAs and PIUs carry out \ntheir respective activities under the Project and the timely provision of all counterpart funding for \nsuccessful implementation of the Project.  \n \n83. \n  NHARG  will  procure  the  necessary  approvals  from  the  Ningxia  Cultural  and  Relic \nManagement Bureau for the alignment of Xixia Canal and report the approval to the State Relics \nManagement Administration.  \n \n84. \nNHARG  will  implement  the  Project  in  concurrence  with  the  gender  action  plan  agreed \nbetween  NHARG  and  ADB,  and  the  participation  plan  to  be  drawn  up  within  6  months  of \ncommencement of the Project. \n \n\nNHARG  will  ensure  that  part  of  the  loan  proceeds  are  onlent  to  the  subborrowers  and \n\n4. \n\nCapacity Building \n\n \nNFD  will  ensure  that  all  PIAs,  PIUs,  and  other  relevant  stakeholders  implement,  in \n85. \naccordance with the implementation plan agreed upon by NHAR and ADB, the capacity building \nand  institutional  strengthening  recommendations  made  by  the  consultants,  as  set  out  as  \noutput 1 of the Project. \n \n86. \nupon selection criteria to be agreed by NHAR and ADB. \n \n\nNFD  will  select  the  most  suitable  and  available  trainers  and  training  institutions  based \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n25 \n\nNFD will ensure that all staff selected for training are suitable for such training and are \n87. \nselected using a transparent and objective methodology.

Project covers a total land area of 3,655 square kilometers (km2), distributed across \n1. \nthe  six  counties  and/or  districts  under  Yinchuan  Municipality.  Rangeland  is  the  largest  land \ncover,  particularly  in  the  most  fragile  Helan  Mountain  foothills.  The  project  area  of  proposed \ninterventions is bounded to the west by the Helan Mountains, to the east by the Yellow River, to \nthe  north  by  a  line  above  the  Shahu  Lake  wetland  region,  and  in  the  south  by  the  southern \nboundary  of  Yongning  County.  The  project  area  is  in  an  arid  part  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nChina  (PRC)  with  adverse  climatic  conditions:  low  precipitation;  high  potential  evaporation; \ngroundwater  with  high  pH  and,  in  places,  high  salinity  and  alkalinity;  cold  winters;  and  mild \nsummers.  However,  the  area  has  favorable  hydrological  characteristics:  major  features  of  the \nYellow River pass through it; the area has considerable wetlands; deep alluvial aquifers; and the \nprotected  Helan  Mountains.  These  conditions  provide  the  area  with  resources  key  to \ndevelopment in the rural sector.  \n \n2. \nDrylands cover about 41% of the world\u2019s land surface and are home to over 38% of the \nworld\u2019s  population.  Severe  land  degradation  is  present  on  10\u250020%  of  these  drylands  and \npoverty  exceeds  that  of  any  other  ecosystem  classification  worldwide.  The  PRC  has  some  of \nthe worst land degradation in the world, with more than 40% of its land area adversely affected; \na  strong  correlation  exists  between  land  degradation  and  the  incidence  of  poverty.  The  PRC \nGovernment\u2019s  past  top-down  and  uncoordinated  sector-by-sector  approach  has  proven \nexpensive  and  only  partially  successful.  Because  the  root  causes  have  not  been  adequately \naddressed, the approach was not sustainable. A recent worldwide review of lessons identified \nfor drylands strongly endorses an integrative approach of the type being taken by the Project, \nbased  on  key  lessons  that  include  the  following: 1  (i)  Desertification 2  has  emerged  from  a \ncombination  of  social  and  biophysical  causal \nis \ncompounded  by  weak  institutions,  poorly  implemented  technologies,  or  exploitative  economic \nsystems.  (ii)  Expansion  of  cropping  into  rangelands  during  wet  periods  often  results  in  crises \nand  environmental  collapse  when  dry  conditions  return,  e.g.,  the  1930s  dust  bowl  (United \nStates)  and  desertification  of  the  PRC\u2019s  Ordos  Plateau  (adjacent  to  the  project  area).  \n(iii)  Development  projects  in  drylands  that  have  been  justified  as  reducing  poverty  have  been \ndriven  by  higher  political  or  economic  objectives  (e.g.,  relocation  of  people).  Out-migration  is \noften  needed  to  sustain  poverty  reduction  in  drylands.  Poverty  trap  thresholds  require  outside \ninterventions  and  livelihood  diversification  to  reduce  dependency  on  highly  variable  natural \nresources.  (iv)  Top-down  policies  often  contradict  local  practices  and  undermine  sustainable \ndevelopment.  An  increased  role  for  local  communities  and  land  users  is  needed  for  win-win \n(environment\u2013development)  outcomes  requiring  rights  to  participate  and  capacity  building \ninitiatives. Combining local environmental knowledge with scientific knowledge can contribute to \nsustainable  management.  (v)  The  critical  dynamics  of  dryland  human\u2013environmental  systems \nare determined by slow variables (e.g., soil fertility, household capital wealth) with long turnover \ntimes,  not  by  fast  variables  (e.g.,  crop  yields,  household  disposable  cash),  which  are  poor \nindicators  of  land  degradation  or  the  need  for  intervention.  However,  most  interventions  focus \non the less strategically important fast variables, leading to confusion and poor designs based \non a lack of understanding of system dynamics. \n\nfactors.

Available at http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/316/5826/847 \n\n2  As described in the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification: \u201cland degradation in arid, semi-arid, and \n\ndry subhumid areas resulting from various factors, including climatic variations and human activities.\u201d \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                                      Appendix 2 \n\n33\n\n   \n\n \n3. \nEcosystem  degradation,  of  which  land  degradation  is  a  major  component,  is  mostly \ncaused  by  interacting  socioeconomic  factors  (e.g.,  overexploitation  of  natural  resources, \npoverty,  and  population  pressure).  Ecosystem  management  attempts  to  address  these  by \ninfluencing the ways in which people use natural resources and benefit from viable ecosystems. \nIntegrated  ecosystem  management  (IEM)  is  a  holistic  approach  to  addressing  the  linkages \nbetween  ecosystem  functions  and  services,  and  social,  economic,  and  production  systems.  It \nrecognizes that people and the natural resources they depend upon directly or indirectly, such \nas land, water, and forests, are inextricably linked. Rather than treat each resource in isolation, \nIEM  offers  the  option  of  treating  all  elements  of  ecosystems  together  to  produce  multiple \nbenefits.  IEM  is  incorporated  in  a  number  of  international  conventions  concerning  the \nenvironment  and  development;  and  international  experience  demonstrates  the  value  of  this \napproach. \n \n4. \nBased  on  lessons  from  dryland  experience  in  industrial  societies  (e.g.,  Australia, \nCanada, and United States), Africa (e.g., Ethiopia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, and Sudan), PRC, and \nSouth America (e.g., El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua); and the experience of \ndryland  research  institutions  such  as  the  International  Center  for  Agricultural  Research  in  the \nDry Areas and the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics; the Global \nEnvironment Facility (GEF) and other development partners have been supporting the PRC to \nchange its approach to combating land degradation. In these countries, from the 1930s onward, \nbottom-up  approaches  bringing \nfarmers  and  graziers,  scientists,  business,  and \ngovernment  agencies  together  to  solve  local  problems  have  proved  successful.  Adequate \nincentives, controls, and financial resources to ensure that environmental functions and services \nare rehabilitated and maintained are essential. Large areas that were severely degraded have \nbeen  rehabilitated  and  used  for  sustainable  agriculture  and  other  purposes,  and  yield  higher \noutput  and  wealth  for  larger  human  populations  than  previously.  Community  organizations, \nincluding farmer and water-user associations, and a clear legal and regulatory framework, are \nfeatured.  Market-based  solutions  that  link  rural  populations  with  processors  and  markets  are \nessential  for  viable  livelihoods.  An  international  workshop  on  IEM,  held  in  Beijing  on  1\u25002 \nNovember  2004,  introduced  the  concepts  and  principles  to  promote  an  understanding  of \novercoming the main barriers to combating land degradation.3 \n \nB. \n \n5. \nThe  PRC  Government  is  adopting  the  IEM  approach  under  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan \n(FYP), as IEM is seen as having a better chance of lasting success than the top-down, sector-\nby-sector  approach,  which  has  been  the  PRC\u2019s  conventional  approach.  The  PRC\u2013GEF \nPartnership on Land Degradation in Dryland Ecosystems is helping introduce the IEM approach.  \n \nThe  first  project  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  under  the  partnership,  the \n6. \nCapacity  Building  to  Combat  Land  Degradation  Project,  is  ongoing  in  six  provinces  and/or \nautonomous  regions:  Gansu,  Inner  Mongolia,  Ningxia  Hui,  Qinghai,  Shaanxi,  and  Xinjiang \nUygur. Its initial focus is for each province and/or region to (i) prepare its own strategic plan for \nland degradation control using an IEM approach; (ii) review relevant policy and legislative and/or \nregulatory  conditions;  (iii)  strengthen  national  and  provincial  coordination,  and  improve \n\nIEM in the PRC \n\nlocal \n\n                                                 \n3  Seven  barriers  to  a  comprehensive  approach  to  land  degradation  in  the  PRC  are  (i)  weak  policy  and  legislative \nframework,  (ii)  uncoordinated  sector  approaches,  (iii)  poor  application  of  lessons  from  previous  experience,  \n(iv)  undeveloped  participatory  approaches,  (v)  poorly  developed  locality-specific  land  use  planning,  (vi)  perverse \nincentives, and (vii) inadequate financial arrangements and incentives.   \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\n     Appendix 2 \n\nprovincial  and  county  operating  arrangements;  (iv)  support  the  capacity  for  future  IEM \ninvestment  projects; 4 (v)  examine  ways  to  improve  and  coordinate  existing  monitoring  and \nevaluation systems; and (vi) support project implementation. A multiagency task force has been \ninvolved in preparing a Ningxia IEM strategy and action plan for land degradation control. The \nfirst draft report was completed in November 2006. In addition, a smaller legal and policy review \nteam  has  undertaken  a  detailed  assessment  of  the  legal  and  policy  environment  required  for \nIEM within Ningxia, and incorporated the findings within the strategy.5 \n \nThrough  the  initial  capacity  building,  awareness  on  IEM  has  been  achieved  among  a \n7. \nrelatively  limited  number  of  government  officials,  planners,  and  technical  experts.  However, \neffective  operationalization  of  the  IEM  strategy,  particularly  through  implementation  of  the \nProject, requires a critical mass of people with not only a good understanding of IEM but also \nthe capacity to plan and implement IEM-based field interventions. The concepts and principles \nof IEM are new to Ningxia. While they are gaining acceptance, time will be required to include \nthem  in  development  policies,  programs,  and  investment  projects,  although  the  principles  are \nincorporated within Ningxia\u2019s 11th FYP. \n \n8. \nPrevious  aid-assisted  projects  in  the  drylands  of  the  PRC  have  used  an  IEM-style \napproach,  e.g.,  local  community  participation,  bottom-up  design,  scientific  resource,  social \nassessments, and detailed monitoring. These include bilateral project assistance from Australia \nand  Canada  in  Inner  Mongolia  and  Qinghai;  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Loess  Plateau  rehabilitation \ninterventions;  and  most  recently,  the  Gansu  and  Xinjiang  Pastoral  Development  Project.  Yet, \ndespite good local results, mainstreaming has not occurred as they were seen as \u201ctoo slow and \ntoo  expensive,\u201d  and  poorly  understood  at  senior  levels.  The  changed  rural  priorities  under  the \n11th  FYP  provide  a  far  better  chance  of  success.  Under  the  Project,  the  links  between  rural \ncommunities  and  commercial  enterprises  to  overcome  poverty  offer  a  more  sustainable \nalternative than a fully public sector-led intervention. \n \nC. \n \n9. \nThe Project is the main instrument through which IEM will be institutionalized in Ningxia. \nFigure  A2  shows  key  links  between  project  area-wide  policy,  regulatory,  and  ecosystem \nlivelihood  development.  The  project \nanalysis \nmanagement  structure  and  role  of  state-owned  enterprises  in  helping  poor  households  exit \npoverty  is  given  in  Supplementary  Appendix  E.  Consultant  services  will  assist  implementation \n(Appendix 8). The following measures will underpin introduction of an IEM approach: \n \n\nthrough  site-specific  conservation  and \n\nIEM Approach under the Project \n\n(i) \n\nProject  management  and  planning.  A  common  understanding  of \nthe \necosystems  of  the  project  area  is  needed  if  an  IEM  approach  is  to  be \nsuccessfully taken. A multisector approach is essential as no agency has all the \ndisciplinary  experts  required  to  solve  the  multidimensional  problems  of  land \ndegradation.  This  requires  coordination  and  cooperation  between  all  sector \n\n                                                 \n4  This includes (i) documenting IEM/land  degradation control-related projects and programs, (ii) identifying lessons \nfrom  past  successes  and  failures  by  assessing  the  impact  of  past  investments,  (iii)  training  a  cadre  of  provincial \nplanners  with  the  skills  required  to  design  land  degradation  control  investment  projects,  and  (iv)  conducting \nfeasibility studies of priority IEM and/or land degradation control project investments eligible for possible financing \nunder the partnership. \n\n5  Ningxia OP12-Executing Office. November 2006. Strategy and Action Plan on Combating Land Degradation. The \nreport  was  prepared  by  a  multidisciplinary  team  of  Chinese  academics,  sector  experts,  and  Ningxia  Hui \nAutonomous Region (NHAR) officials who worked together for 12 months. The final report will be submitted to the \nNHAR government for approval, so that it will become an executable policy document.  \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                                      Appendix 2 \n\n35\n\n   \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\ntakes  place  within \n\nthe  sustainable  capacity  of \n\nagencies,  especially  those  responsible  for  agriculture,  livestock,  forestry,  land \nand  water  resources,  environment,  science  and  technology,  finance,  planning, \nand legislation; and project implementing agencies and the public. Training and \ncapacity development for stakeholder agencies and participants will be provided, \nand regulatory reforms will support improved ecosystem management.  \nSpatial planning, integrated water resource management plan, zoning, and \nIEM  information  center.  The  slow  variables  (para.  2)  will  be  assessed  so  that \nfuture  development \nthe \necosystems.  This  will  provide  all  stakeholder  agencies  and  leaders  with  an \nunderstanding  of  the  capacity  of  the  physical  aspects  of  the  ecosystems,  and \nfuture demands. A signed agreement is already in place between 13 agencies to \nshare information with an open access website, and an IEM information center is \nbeing equipped that will have analysis and mapping capacity.  \nSite-specific  planning  and  sustainable  development.  This  will  include \ngrasslands,  wetlands,  and  irrigated  areas.  It  will  involve  commercial  enterprises \nto  help  small  farmers  exit  poverty  through  links  to  market  opportunities  in \nsustainable production systems, and rehabilitate areas for conservation of natural \nhabitats  that  provide  vital  ecosystem  functions  and  services.  Participation  of \ncommunity  organizations  (e.g.,  114  farmer  associations  and  163  water-user \ngroups  are  in  the  project  area)  is  a  feature  that  will  replace  the  top-down \napproach. Sector and market issues are addressed in paras. 10\u250011. \nTechnology  demonstrations  of  best  practices.  The  focus  will  be  on \nconservation  agriculture,  water  use  efficiency,  fertilizer  management,  wetland \nand  grassland  management,  and  integrated  pest  management,  e.g., substantial \necological and environmental benefits can be gained from adopting conservation \nagriculture practices. This is a holistic approach to agricultural production based \non  enhancing  natural  soil  biological \ninvolving  \n(a) improved soil organic matter management for the efficient use of rainfall, soil \nmoisture, and plant nutrients; and (b) maintenance of soil physical properties by \nkeeping  mechanical  tillage  to  the  absolute  minimum  required  for  direct  planting \nand/or seeding.  \n\nregeneration  processes \n\n \n\nMarket and Sector Issues \n\nD. \n \n10. \nThe current conditions in key sector markets likely to be developed or influenced under \nthe Project are summarized in this appendix. All production interventions under the Project are \nbased on sound assessments of financial and economic aspects of the proposed commodities, \nand  commercial  decisions  by  the  investing  enterprises.  Market  conditions  and  forecasts  of \nfuture market opportunities (i.e., supply, demand, and anticipated price trends) are detailed for \nthe  following  markets:  livestock  raising  and  the  production  of  processed  beef  and  dairy \nfoodstuffs, including halal products for established export markets; vineyards and wine; Chinese \nmedicinal  herbs;  horticulture;  and  the  supply  and  condition  of  existing  tourism  facilities  and \nproducts.  Expectations regarding  future  tourist numbers  likely  to  visit  the  city  of  Yinchuan  and \nsurrounding areas are considered along with assessments of the impact of planned upgrades to \nexisting cultural\u2013historical sites and nature preserves on future visitor arrival figures. Reviewing \nthe  planned  increases  in  output  for  these  commodities  and  increases  in  visitor  numbers \nforecasted to result from the proposed project activities, trends toward increasing consumption \nof  these  goods  in  general,  and  in  niche  markets  for  some  of  Ningxia\u2019s  products  in  particular \n(e.g., halal markets), suggest a highly favorable market environment can be expected to support \nthe planned development activities. \n \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\n     Appendix 2 \n\nIWRMP\n\nZonation\n\nSpatial Plan\n\nLeading Group\nTask Force \n\nWRD Planning Institute \nTask Force \n\n \nFigure A2: Overview of Project Implementation Linkages \n \n\nThe  sustainability  of  the  natural  resource  base  is  analyzed  in  two  detailed  supporting \n11. \ndocuments: (i) Environmental Assessment Report (May 2007), and (ii) the final GEF submission \n(August  2007).

The Project has two types of subprojects: those \nconcerned with  agricultural  production  and  for which  quantifiable  benefits  are  physical  outputs \n(such  as  beef,  wine,  vegetables);  and  the  wetlands  and  cultural  relic  sites  for  which  the \nquantifiable outputs are visitor numbers and visitor receipts. In one case, Yuehai Lake, benefits \nare a combination of visitor receipts and sales of aquatic products from the lake. \n \n3. \nFor subprojects that involve agricultural production, the expected benefits are sufficient \nto  provide  incentives  for  households  to  participate  in  subproject  activities  and  adopt  new \nproduction and management methods that will be introduced by the subprojects. For this group \nof  subprojects,  per  household  annual  incremental  net  benefits  vary  between  CNY2,400  and \nCNY37,000.  Net  benefits  reflect  the  resources,  including  labor,  involved  in  the  production \nactivity. \n \n4. \nBenefit  estimates  are  based  on  the  current  situation  and  data  in  each  case,  and  on \nconservative  assessments  of  future  developments  with  the  Project.  With-  and  without-project \nscenarios  are  identified  for  each  subproject.  However,  agricultural  subprojects  have  a \nbackground issue of land degradation, which was not directly considered in the analysis. Most \nscenarios assume that the future without the Project is more or less the same as the present. \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\n     Appendix 9 \n\nThis  tends  to  overestimate  the  without-project  production  since  given  continued  land \ndegradation, present production is more likely to only be maintained with increasing inputs and \ncosts, and declining returns for producers. \n \nThe Project will generate many nonquantified benefits, most fall into two broad groups: \n5. \nenvironmental and ecosystem benefits, and cultural and heritage benefits. Together, these are \nsignificant benefits that add justification for project implementation. Included in these groups are \n(i)  benefits  accruing  from  the  protection  and  restoration  of  wetlands  and  wildlife  habitats,  and \nimprovements  in  wildlife  populations;  (ii)  improvements  in  biodiversity,  especially  on  the \npiedmont  of  Helan  Mountains;  (iii)  improvements  in  water  quality  from  secondary  treatment  of \nsewage  plant  effluents,  including  the  use  of  selected  plants  to  remove  water  pollutants;  \n(iv) reduction in water pollution from the overuse of nitrogen and other fertilizers on project area \nfarms;  (v)  reduced  land  degradation;  and  (vi)  intangible  benefits  accruing  from  the  protection \nsites of cultural and historical importance. \n \n6. \nFinancial and economic indicators estimated for the activities and the overall Project are \ngiven in Table A9.2. These exhibit a considerable range of values of internal rates of return and \nnet present value, both financial and economic. Only one, Yinchuan City wetlands, has financial \nindicators  below  the  acceptance  level  determined  by  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of \n4.0%.  This  subproject  has  significant  investments  in  wetland  environmental  and  ecological \ninfrastructure, but relatively limited visitor potential because of the size and location. It focuses \non the wetland environment and habitats and does not offer the wide range of leisure activities \nassociated with, for example, Shahu and Yuehai lakes. \n \nOne  subproject,  Yinxi  alternative  livelihoods,  has  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return \n7. \n(EIRR) that is just below the 12% discount rate. The benefits are conservatively estimated, so \nthe EIRR may be underestimated to some extent. This activity has the greatest potential direct \nimpact on poverty reduction as it will involve about 9,800 households, a high proportion of which \ncurrently fall below the poverty line defined by Yinchuan Municipality and all of which can expect \nto have household incomes above the poverty line once the Project is established.   \n \n8. \nThe  EIRR  for  the  whole  Project  is  estimated  at  14.4%  and  the  net  present  value  at \nCNY201.4 million. Because the Project is multifaceted with subprojects across several diverse \nsectors, this result is robust to variation in key variables within any of its component parts. Since \nadverse movements in prices or outputs in tandem are not likely, the effect of variations on the \nwhole Project is limited. For example, if the selling prices for milk, beef, and wine, all important \nquantified  benefits,  were  all  10%  below  the  prices  assumed  in  the  analysis,  the  EIRR  for  the \nwhole  Project  would  still  be  13.1%.  Conversely,  a  reduction  in  total  project  costs  of  6% \nincreases the EIRR only to 14.6%. \n \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n \n9. \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  on  household  incomes  is  summarized  in  Table  A9.3.  These \nincomes  do  not  include  the  value  of  households\u2019  own  labor,  which  in  most  cases  will  be \napproximately equivalent to one full-time person. Household incomes with the Project are above \nthe  poverty  line  (CNY1,000  per  capita  per  year  in  Yinchuan  Municipality)  in  all  these  cases \nexcept for beef production, which is an additional activity to households\u2019 other farming activities, \nand therefore does not represent the full household income. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                                   Appendix 9        \n\n57\n\n   \n\nFinancial indicators for the subproject\u2019s impacts on commercial enterprises are given in \n10. \nTable  A9.2.

The  exchange  rate \nused throughout is CNY7.64 = $1, the prevailing rate at appraisal in April 2007. The project life \nfor  the  analysis  is  25  years.  For  the  economic  analysis,  the  discount  rate  is  12%;  and  for  the \nfinancial  analysis,  a  weighted  average  cost  of capital  of  4.0%  was  estimated  and used.  In  the \nfinancial  analyses  of  the  subprojects,  value-added,  business,  income,  and  consumption  taxes \nand surtax are applied at the rates applicable for the type of business activity concerned.  \n \nFor  most  commodities,  little  or  no  price  distortion  is  apparent  in  the  market.  Current \n13. \nmarket  prices  are  used  for  all  financial  prices,  for  both  traded  and  nontraded  goods.  For  all \ngoods  for  which  a  specific  conversion  has  not  been  estimated,  a  conversion  factor  of  1.0  is \nused. Conversion factors for maize, wheat, and beef are estimated based on calculated import \nparity prices. Tax and other transfer payment calculations are included in the financial analysis \nbut are deleted in the economic analysis. A shadow wage  rate factor of 0.80 is applied to the \nprice  of  unskilled  labor  in  the  economic  analysis.  Conversion  factors  used  in  the  analysis  are \ngiven in Table A9.5. \n \n\nTable A9.5: Conversion Factors \n\nItem \nStandard conversion factor \nFertilizers \nWheat \nFeed concentrate (based on maize) \nIrrigation water \nShadow wage rate factor \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates.          \n\nValue \n1.00 \n1.20 \n0.94 \n1.13 \n5.00 \n0.80 \n\n \n14. \nImport  parity  prices  for  fertilizers,  maize,  wheat,  and  beef  are  estimated  based  on \naverage  commodity  prices  for  2004\u22122006,  as  reported  by  the  World  Bank.  These  calculated \nprices  are  used  to  estimate  conversion  factors  for  these  goods.  For  fertilizers,  a  composite \nconversion factor is estimated based on the ratio for urea, phosphate, and potash of 2:1:1. For \nbeef, the calculated conversion factor is 1.01, which is approximated to 1.0. \n \n15. \neconomic analysis, a shadow wage rate factor of 0.80 is applied. \n \nThe price of irrigation water is generally accepted to not reflect its true resource cost. A \n16. \nrecent  World  Bank  project  used  an  economic  price  for  water  of  CNY0.3  per  cubic  meter  (m3), \n\nThe  price  of  unskilled  labor  in  the  project  area  is  about  CNY25  per  day.  For  the \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                                   Appendix 9        \n\n59\n\n   \n\nwhich is adopted here as well.3 This compares with a current financial price for irrigation water in \nthe project area of CNY0.06 per m3. \n\n \n4. \n\nDistribution and Poverty Impact \n\n \n17. \nAlthough  the  main  focus  of  the  Project  is  on  IEM,  several  subprojects  will  also  have  a \nsignificant  impact  on  poverty  reduction.  Those  that  will  have  the  greatest  impact  are  the  Yinxi \nalternative  livelihoods  and  the  high  technology  agriculture  subprojects.  These  focus  on  the \nneeds  of  the  resettled  population,  which  is  the  poorest  group  in  the  project  area.  Together, \nthese  subprojects  will  benefit  at  least  11,000  households  (55,000  people),  generating \nincremental benefits per capita that in almost all cases will be greater than the present poverty \nline  income  for  Yinchuan  Municipality  of  CNY1,000  per  capita  per  year.  The  high  technology \nagriculture subproject will generate significant demand for daily employment for people living in \nthe area but not directly involved in subproject activities. \n \n18. \nThe  beef  production  and  vineyards  subprojects  will  benefit  a  large  number  of \nhouseholds. Together, these subprojects will improve the livelihoods of about 7,500 households, \nalthough  mostly  Ningxia  State  Farm  Group  households,  which  are  not  currently  below  the \nofficial poverty line. \n \nQuantified benefits of the Project accrue principally to (i) households participating in the \n19. \nagricultural  and \nincomes; \n(ii) households benefiting from increased full- or part-time employment with tourism, processing, \nand  production  activities,  and  through  increased  or  more  regular  household  income;  (iii)  the \ncommercial PIAs and enterprises through increased revenues and profits; and (iv) Ningxia Hui \nAutonomous Region government through increased tax revenues from the Project\u2019s commercial \nactivities  (estimated  at  around  CNY30  million  per  year).  Nonquantified  benefits  in  the  form  of \nstrengthened institutional planning, management, and coordinating skills and capabilities accrue \nto the PIAs and enterprises.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \n1.  Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy, and the sector analysis, describe how \nthe  project  would  directly  or  indirectly  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  and  how  it  is  linked  to  the  poverty  reduction \nstrategy of the partner country. \n \nThe  country  partnership  strategy  (2008\u20132010)a  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nChina (PRC) emphasizes continued support to reduce poverty, improve the quality of life for the millions of people with \nlow incomes, and support for the PRC\u2019s contribution to protect regional and global public goods. The Project supports \nADB\u2019s  strategic  concerns  to  improve  the  environment  and  promote  equitable  and  inclusive  gowth,  as  set  out  in  the \nstrategy.  Nationally,  poor  people  mostly  live  in  the  central  and  western  provinces  that  lag  the  eastern  provinces  in \nachieving  the  Millennium  Development  Goals.  In  these  regions,  poverty  is  mostly  rural  and  strongly  correlated  to \naccess  to  land  and  incidence  of  land  degradation.  The  Project  will  address  poverty  reduction  by  introducing \necologically sound investments that support the livelihoods of the rural poor in obtaining better access to higher-value \nmarket chains and off-farm income, as  well as through improving vocational skills, and reducing vulnerability through \ncontract farming arrangements that include provision of technical, financial, and marketing skills.  \n \nThe PRC and  ADB  will cooperate on a broad range  of activities related  to policy  and regulatory reform and capacity \nbuilding  in  the  environment  sector,  and  support  projects  to  reduce  poverty  as  one  of  the  underlying  causes  of \nenvironment  problems.  Projects  will  be  designed  so  that  the  poor  increase  their  incomes,  while  also  capturing \nenvironmental benefits. To sharpen the poverty focus of environmental  work, the PRC and ADB are addressing land \ndegradation through an integrated ecosystem management (IEM) approach by supporting implementation of the long-\nterm  PRC\u2013Global  Environment  Facility  (GEF)  Partnership  on  Land  Degradation  in  Dryland  Ecosystems.  The \npartnership  addresses  policy,  institutional,  technical,  and  financing  issues  related  to  combating  land  degradation \nthrough a programmatic approach. It aims to arrest land degradation and restore dryland ecosystems to reduce poverty \nin the western region. The Project is one of the demonstration investment projects to be designed as part of the PRC\u2013\nGEF partnership. \n \nThe project area has a population (including Yinchuan City) of 1.14 million with about 60% (690,000) urban and about \n40% (450,000) rural. The project area of 3,655 square kilometers includes three districts (Jinfen, Xingqing, and Xixia) \nand  two  counties  (Helan  and  Yongning).  In  2004,  the  average  annual  urban  income  was  CNY7,200  ($931.13) \ncompared with the rural per capita income of CNY3,080 ($398.32). The project area includes 19 townships in Yinchuan \nand nine state farm enterprises of the wider Ningxia Agricultural Reclamation Bureau. The project area comprises an \nintensively irrigated and cropped alluvial plain with shallow wetlands, an extensive piedmont area of poor quality soils, \nand  the  Helan  Mountains.  Irrigation  water  is  largely  dependent  on  surface  water  from  the  Yellow  River,  which  is \nincreasingly facing new demands and declining availability. Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (NHAR) had the highest \nrate  of  land  conversion  of  all  provinces  in  the  last  decade  with  expansion  of  irrigated  agriculture  on  marginal  soils, \nlinked to increased agrichemical use, increased runoff and salinization, and loss of water quality and grasslands.  \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  strategy  considers  rapid  urbanization  as  an  important  means  for  reducing  poverty.  Rapid \nurbanization  creates  new  challenges.  For  example,  competing  demand  from  urban  and  rural  water  users  will \nnecessitate  reallocation  of  water,  and  increasingly  scarce  water  resources  need  integrated  planning  systems  for \nimproved  water  conservation  and  use  efficiency.  The  Project  will  provide  the  opportunity  to  achieve  the  objective  of \ndemonstrating  and  improving  the  institutional  capacity  to  implement  an  IEM  approach  to  sustainable  use  of  natural \nresources,  agriculture,  and  biodiversity  conservation  by  means  of  (i)  establishing  an  IEM  institutional  framework;  (ii) \ndemonstrating  integrated  land  and  water  resource  management;  (iii)  improving  rural  livelihoods,  through  promoting \nenterprise  development,  and  sustainable  commercial  agricultural  (e.g.,  vineyards  and  processing,  dairy  production, \nhigh-technology agriculture, and greenhouse production); and (iv) integrating conservation and tourism through cultural \nand nature tourism, wetland conservation, and management.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 10     61 \n\n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                         \n\nTargeting Classification: Targeted Intervention \n\u2013Households \n\n  \n\n1.    Key Issues  \n \nPoverty in the  project area remains significant by  world benchmarks. Using the  poverty line of Yinchuan Municipality \n(CNY1,000  per  capita  per  year)b  48,000  people  are  classified  as  poor  and  a  similar  number  deemed  vulnerable  to \npoverty with incomes less than CNY1,500 per capita per year. The majority of poor were resettled into the project area \nthrough  a  government  poverty  reduction  program  from  the  extremely  impoverished  southern  mountainous  area  of \nNingxia during 1983 to 1997. The Project\u2019s poverty classification is Targeted Intervention-Households.  \n \nA social and poverty assessment was carried out for each of the subprojects in compliance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nIncorporation of Social Dimensions in Bank Operations. The assessments included rural livelihood assessment, which \nconfirmed  disparate  growth  rates  between  sectors  resulting  in  large  income  inequities  between  rural  and  urban \nhouseholds and between groups of rural dwellers. Poverty analysis  was undertaken using a field survey of 270 rural \nhouseholds  and  participatory  rapid  assessment  within  three  typical  communities  identified  through  key  informant \ndiscussions within the project area. They are (i) a resettlement community in the transition zone of piedmont and river \nplain, (ii) a community within the irrigated alluvial plain, and (iii) a state farm community. Institutional consultation was \nundertaken  regarding  ongoing  programs  and  experiences  in  poverty  reduction.  The  assessment  concludes  that  rural \npoverty is mostly confined to previously resettled villages on marginal soil between the piedmont and the alluvial plain; \nhowever,  even  households  in  the  irrigation  scheme  displayed  indicators  of  increased  vulnerability  to  poverty.  State-\nfarm  rural  households,  while  having  higher  incomes,  are  found  to  have  weaknesses  in  social  capital  and  housing. \nPoverty is linked closely to limited land per capita, declining productivity, low education, increased migration for work \nand  households  headed  by  women,  increased  dependence  on  straw  and  crop  residues  for  heating  (reducing  soil \nnutrients), and lower salaries for off-farm work. A significant finding was the inability of Hui women, who are Muslim, to \nfind off-farm employment due to their inability to migrate to work for religious reasons and the limited casual local work \nopportunities.  \n \nRural incomes are 50% lower than urban incomes creating incentives for urbanization. The underlying causes of rural \npoverty are (i) lack of reliable irrigation; (ii) small landholdings; (iii) poor soil quality and traditional farming technologies; \n(iv) surplus labor within households and limited off-farm job opportunities; (v) the need for high inputs on marginal land \n(fertilizer,  machinery,  and  irrigation);  and  (vi)  lack  of  diversified  crops,  especially  economic  crops.  The  analysis \nconcludes  that  poverty  is  linked  strongly  to  insufficient  land  per  capita  and  other  resources,  including  water,  limiting \nhouseholds in building sufficient capital to exit poverty. These underlying causes of rural poverty support the need for a \nstrategy that includes facilitating rural labor to move into off-farm employment.  \n \nThe Project\u2019s strategy is to address poverty by (i) addressing the root causes of land degradation, thereby reducing the \nvulnerability of households to poverty; (ii) increasing incomes by linking producers to higher-value crops and markets; \nand (iii) providing opportunities for developing skills for off-farm employment. The design of interventions on improving \nrural livelihoods and poverty reduction will result in productivity improvements and greater market certainty, leading to \nincreased  incomes,  especially  for  poor  smallholders  in  previously  resettled  communities.  Conservation  agriculture \ntechnologies,  land  use  matched  to  soils  and  land-use  capability,  improved  water  use  and  nutrient  efficiency, \nstrengthened  farmer  associations,  access  to  rural  finance,  contract  farming  agreements  linked  to  processing  and \nmarket chains, and capacity development will all contribute to improved sustainable livelihoods and improved resilience \nfor poor rural households.  \n \n \n2.   Design Features \n \nA key design feature builds on the findings of a recent ADB evaluation of poverty exit achievements, which highlighted \nthe success of linking the rural poor to commercial value-adding enterprises and the associated off-farm employment \nopportunities.  The  Project  applies  this  by  promoting  perennial  crops,  grape  and  wine  processing,  ecological \ngreenhouse  systems,  livestock  and  dairy  production,  provision  of  renewable  rural  energy  programs,  as  well  as  the \nintroduction  of  time-saving  technologies  to  enable  movement  of  surplus  labor  into  off-farm  employment.  Vocational \ntraining will enable rural residents to compete for higher paying jobs and reduce poverty in the project area.   \n \nC.

Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nKey Issues \n \nIn  the  project  area,  of  the  74,000  previously  resettled  people  from  the  very  poor  southern  area  of  Ningxia, \napproximately 73% are Hui Muslims. They reside in four of six resettlement townships: Liangtian, Minning, Naliangtaizi, \nand Xinjiang. From the livelihood survey done during the technical assistance, the communities are found to be poor \nand have low economic development due to (i) low education, especially among women; (ii) access to poor quality land \nwith high irrigation costs; and (iii) heavy reliance on off-farm income. To address these issues, the project design has \nspecifically included contract farming, processing, and alternative livelihoods through links with enterprises, vocational \nand technical training, and increased irrigation efficiency measures to benefit these communities.  \n \nOverall, up to an estimated 46,400 households will benefit, with the majority of these Hui from previously resettled poor \ncommunities, including up to 5,200 individuals who will benefit from employment. The Project will train approximately \n2,200  individuals  in  technical  subjects,  5,500  farmers  in  field  schools  and  a  demonstration  program  on  conservation \nagriculture,  and  some  3,000  rural  poor  in  vocational  training  through  which  additional  livelihood  options  will  develop. \nAdverse  consequences  are  minor  and  come  from  land  acquisition  for  the  Project.  These  will  be  mitigated  by \ncompensation  payments  and  provision  of  replacement  houses,  if  necessary,  as  per  a  resettlement  plan  that  will  be \nupdated  in  the  final  design.  Demonstration  of  new  conservation  agriculture  approaches  to  land-use  management  will \nimprove  water-use  efficiency;  while  integrated  pest  and  nutrient  management  will  aid  beneficiaries\u2019  integration  into \nhigher-value  market  chains  and  enable  households  to  attain  higher  incomes,  reduce  vulnerability,  and  increase  their \nparticipation in rural decision making. Project-related human capital investments for rural households provided as skills \nand vocational training will support the orderly movement of labor into off-farm employment.  \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.    Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nThe project design process was linked and extended the ongoing OP12 PRC\u2013GEF Capacity Building to Combat Land \nDegradation Projectc and its development of a Ningxia Land Degradation Strategy and Action Plan using local experts \nworking in a multistakeholder, and multisector planning procedure. For the design of the Project, consultation has taken \nplace  with  stakeholders,  beneficiaries,  and  directly  affected  people,  and  will  continue  during  implementation.  A \nparticipatory  and  consultative  methodology  was  adopted  to  undertake  the  social  analysis  and  rural  livelihood  survey \nduring the project preparatory technical assistance. It involved (i) a formal questionnaire survey with 270 households; \n(ii)  discussions  with  project  stakeholders;  (iii)  a  series  of  stakeholder  workshops  with  the  four  subborrowers;  and \n(iv) interviews  with  key  informants  in  rural  communities,  key  Government  staff  and  nongovernment  organizations, \nethnic  minorities,  and  women.  Detailed  discussions  were  maintained  using  both  sector  and  cross-sector  working \ngroups  that  included  the  provincial  project  management  office  (PPMO)  and  its  expert  groups,  project  implementing \nagencies  and  associated  state-owned  enterprises,  design  institutes,  academics,  and  safeguard  agencies  including \nenvironment  and  poverty  reduction  officials  under  the  leadership  of  the  PPMO.  The  working  groups\u2019  findings  were \ncollectively discussed and reviewed through a series of stakeholder workshops. \n \n2.   What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n Information sharing       \n\n Consultation      \n\n Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \nDuring project implementation, the participation of stakeholders including beneficiaries will continue to be built through \nparticipatory  planning  and  implementation  processes.  For  example,  inclusive  processes  will  be  established  for \nparticipation in water resources planning, IEM spatial planning, conservation, and wetland management planning. The \nuse of demonstrations linked to the involvement of farmer and water user associations in farmer field schools, training \nprograms,  contract  farming  systems,  and  outreach  programs  will  adopt  a  highly  participatory  approach  to  rural \nlivelihood  improvement.  The  extent  and  scope  of  participation  will  require  institutional  capacity  building  early  during \nproject implementation to facilitate successful implementation of IEM approaches. \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nIf  a  C&P  plan  was  prepared,  describe  key  features  and  resources  provided  to  implement  the  plan  (including  budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nNo C&P plan was prepared but it will be developed by the PPMO with assistance from the sociologist included in the \nconsulting package (B) during the first year.  \n \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 10     63 \n\n \nC.  Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues \nGender  roles  are  determined  by  a  combination  of  cultural  factors,  occupations,  environmental  conditions,  education, \nand employment opportunities. In the project area, except for the Ningxia State Farm Group, income inequities create \nincentives for rural males to migrate to urban labor markets, thus resulting in feminization of agriculture (women now \ncontribute up to 70% of the rural workforce). Female participation standards for training (including farmer field schools \nand  formal  training),  vocational  training,  employment,  and  contract  farming  opportunities  have  been  proposed  along \nwith recommendations for female representation in farmer associations and the provision of opportunities in a manner \nthat enables female participation.  \n \n2.  Key Actions \nMeasures  included  in  the  design  to  promote  gender  equality  and  women\u2019s  empowerment\u2014access  to  and  use  of \nrelevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n\n \n\n Gender plan       \n\n Other actions/measures      \n\n No action/measure \n\n \nSummarize  key  design  features  of  the  gender  plan  or  other  gender-related  actions/measures,  including  performance \ntargets, monitorable indicators, resource allocation, and implementation arrangements. \n \nThe Project will not have significant negative impacts on women, but the design aspects ensure gender is addressed to \nachieve equal participation of women in project activities, and equal opportunities for women to access social services, \ntraining, employment, and beneficiary agreements including contract farming arrangements.  \n \nA gender plan will be prepared during implementation and the terms of reference of the consultant to assist in this work \nare included in Appendix 8. Women\u2019s participation in income-earning activities and women\u2019s educational and off-farm \nopportunities are included in the design. \n \n\nIII.

Major  impacts  are  defined  as  involving  affected  people  being  physically \ndisplaced from housing and/or losing 10% or more of their productive, income-generating assets. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 11       65    \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN  \n\nProject Impacts \n\nPolicy and Legal Framework  \n\n \n1. \nThe Project will support activities that require limited land acquisition, house demolition, \nand  resettlement.  In  accordance  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995), a short resettlement plan was prepared by the project implementing \nagencies (PIAs) with assistance from the Foreign Debt Management Office of the Ningxia Hui \nAutonomous Region\u2019s Finance Department, and based on consultation with affected parties. As \nfinal engineering designs are to be completed during implementation, the resettlement plan will \nneed to be updated based on the final design documentation, especially for the proposed Xixia \nCanal extension. \n \nA. \n \n2. \nProject construction will require the permanent acquisition of 264.7 hectares (ha) of land \nfor the Xixia Canal. Of the permanent land being acquired, only 10 ha are irrigated and 8 ha are \norchards.  Temporary  land  acquisition  during  construction  will  be  required  for  the  Xixia  Canal \n(9.3  ha)  and  irrigation  rehabilitation  (34  ha).  No  displacement  of  private  housing  is  required. \nApproximately  3,260  people  in  770  households  will  be  affected,  but  the  impacts  are  relatively \nminor  and  will  be  fully  mitigated  through  compensation  provided  by  the  Project  and  new \nopportunities through investments made by the Project.  \n \nB.  \n \n3. \nThe  resettlement  plan  incorporates  the  legal  requirements  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nChina (PRC) and ADB policy. The main principles guiding these requirements are (i) minimize \nnegative  social  impacts  of  project  design;  (ii)  carry  out  resettlement  and  compensation  to \nimprove,  or  at  least  restore  the  preproject  income  and  living  standards  of  people  affected;  \n(iii) fully inform and consult those affected on compensation options and resettlement planning; \n(iv) provide asset compensation at replacement rates; and (v) compensate in full for lost assets, \nreplacement of assets, and resettlement allowances prior to ground leveling or demolition. \n \n4. \nThe resettlement plan stipulates eligibility and entitlements for land, houses, and income \nlosses, and rehabilitation subsidies in accordance with the 1998 Land Administration Law; State \nCouncil Document No. 28, Deepening Reform on Land Acquisition Systems and Reinforcement \n(2004);  and  ADB\u2019s \nframework  specifies \ncompensation  standards,  and  each  subcomponent  will  determine  compensation  provisions \nbased on stated criteria and how they apply to local land productivity and site features.  \n \n5. \nPeople affected through the permanent acquisition of land will be compensated through \npayment  of  (i)  a  land  compensation  fee,  and  (ii)  a  resettlement  subsidy.  According  to  the \nNingxia Regulation for Land Acquisition (1997) and the Ningxia Land Administration Regulations \n(2000), affected people will also receive compensation for the loss of crops and trees. Yinchuan \nMunicipality has also issued rules for resettlement implementation procedures. \n \nAccording  to  the  policy  and  socioeconomic  conditions  at  the  project  sites,  detailed \n6. \ncompensation  rates  will  be  agreed  upon  with  affected  individuals  or  groups.  For  the  short \nresettlement plan, compensation rates for land compensation, resettlement, relocation support, \nand  subsidy  are  based  on  the  Ningxia  Land  Administration  Regulations.  Under  these \nregulations each PIA has established compensation rates and estimated the cost based on local \nconditions and resettlement impacts.  \n \n\nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy.  The \n\nlegal \n\n \n\n\f66     Appendix 11 \n\nthe  average  of \n\nfrom  annual  crops  are \n\nFor cultivated land, compensation rates are 6\u221210 times output based on the average of \n7. \nthe previous 3-year output by different forms of land use. Noncultivated land is compensated at \n1\u22122 times the average of the previous 3-year annual land output. Compensation rates for lost \nincome \nthe  previous  3-year  annual  output;  \n2\u20133  times  the  average  annual  value  for  perennial  crops.  Land  used  temporarily  during \nconstruction  will  be  compensated  at  a  rate  equivalent  to  production  values  foregone  for  the \nperiod of loss, which is expected to be less than  2 years.  The contractor will restore any land \nrequired temporarily during project construction to its original condition.  \n \n8. \nFor structures to be demolished, replacement value defines compensation to be paid to \naffected households where rates are derived from the prices within affected areas. Those losing \nstructures will receive compensation for their plot and relocation costs. House compensation will \nnot  be  reduced  for  depreciation,  and  people  will  be  allowed  to  salvage  materials  from  their \nhouses.  Miscellaneous  resettlement  support  for  transport  and  temporary  housing  for  those \nbeing resettled is based on three times the average of the previous 3-year land output. \n \nThe provincial project management office (PPMO) and the relevant PIA will ensure that \n9. \nresettlement  entitlements  are  provided  to  affected  people  prior  to  demolition  or  resettlement. \nLand compensation and resettlement subsidies will be paid to those affected or village leaders. \nHousing compensation and compensation for crops and other assets will be provided directly to \nthose affected by the loss of assets.   \n\nResettlement and Rehabilitation \n\nC. \n \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  on  people  and  their  assets  is  considered  to  be  minor. \n10. \nRehabilitation  options  will  be  selected  in  consultation  with  each  individual  household.  Where \nhouseholds are seriously affected and risk being worse off, despite the full set of compensation \npayments,  they  will  receive  the  following  entitlements:  (i)  guarantee  of  hire  for  project \nconstruction  labor,  (ii)  offer  of  permanent  employment  by  the  project  proponent,  (iii)  skills \ntraining, and (iv) priority for involvement in other project components with the township. \n \n11.  When  the  public  sector  is  affected,  the  Ningxia  Hui  Autonomous  Region  government \n(NHARG)  will  help  the  PIAs  arrange  alternative  land,  housing,  and  shop  arrangements.  The \nprocess  requires  each  PIA  to  obtain  the  approval  of  Yinchuan  Municipality  to  proceed,  and \nthereafter the PIA will apply to the Land Reserves Office for alternative premises. The PIA will \nbe  required  to  pay  the  Land  Reserves  Office  in  return  for  the  reallocation  of  premises  from \nwithin the public sector pool.  \n \nD. \n \nBased  on  detailed  cost  estimates  of  the  subcomponents,  the  total  cost  of  land \n12. \nacquisition  and  resettlement  is  $2.6  million  equivalent,  inclusive  of  contingencies  and  taxes. \nThese  costs  are  included  within  the  total  project  costs.  Compensation  for  land  acquisition, \ndemolition  of  structures,  and  other  costs  will  be  paid  directly  to  the  affected  entity  or  person \nthrough  the  project  implementation  unit  of  the  respective  PIA.  According  to  the  compensation \npolicies  and  standards  defined  in  the  resettlement  plan,  the  payment  and  usage  of \ncompensation funds will be undertaken under the supervision of the PPMO, with regular review \nby  an  independent  external  monitoring  agency.  The  funding  for  resettlement  costs  will  be \nprovided through the counterpart funds to be provided by each subborrower. Disbursements will \nbe monitored quarterly to ensure that full compensation has been paid in a timely manner. \n \n\nResettlement Cost and Funding \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 11       67    \n\nInstitutional Responsibilities \n\nInformation Disclosure and Public Participation \n\nThe  main  PIAs  are  (i)  Ningxia  Agricultural  Reclamation  Bureau,  (ii)  Ningxia  Water \n\nE. \n \n13. \nPreliminary  consultation  with  the  identified  affected  people  has  taken  place.  The \nsummary  of  the  Environmental  Assessment  Report  (May  2007)  describes  in  detail  the \nconsultation  process,  which  included  two  rounds  of  public  consultation  on  the  Xixia  Canal \nextension,  plus  other  surveys  and  discussions.  Detailed  consultation  will  follow  the  detailed \ntechnical design.  \n \nThe  resettlement  plan  was  approved  by  ADB  and  posted  on  ADB  website  on  4  June \n14. \n2007. The plan was sent to the PPMO and PIAs for dissemination to the affected people who \nwere  informed  of  the  scope  of  the  Project,  land  compensation  and  resettlement,  their \nentitlements, and the procedure and timelines. Consultation and participation will be continued \nthrough  subproject  implementation,  including  signing  compensation  contracts  and  providing \nreplacement land. \n \nF. \n \n15. \nThe  PPMO  will  be  responsible  for  planning,  finance  and  administration,  and  project \nmanagement staff, as well as the focal point representatives and a group of technical experts. \nThe  PIAs  will  be  responsible  for  borrowing  and  repaying  the  loan,  the  use  of  Global \nEnvironment Facility funds, and Government counterpart funding.  \n \n16. \nResources Department, (iii) Ningxia Administrative Bureau, and (iv) Yinchuan Municipality. \n \n17. \nThe  PPMO  has  responsibility  for  ensuring  procedures  of  the  Government  of  the  PRC, \nNHARG,  and  ADB  are  followed.  The  PIAs  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  resettlement \naccording  to  the  resettlement  plan  and  coordinating  the  planning,  implementation,  financing, \nand reporting of land acquisition and resettlement. The PIAs will take primary responsibility for \nthe resettlement consultation, implementation, and timely delivery of entitlements by appointing \na focal point to be in charge of all resettlement issues. \n \nG. \n \n18. \nComplaints  and  grievance  procedures  for  land  acquisition  in  the  PRC  are  well \nestablished. Affected people will be made aware of grievance procedures through participatory \nmeetings and through the resettlement information booklet provided to village leaders and those \naffected.  Where  no  agreement  is  reached  on  compensation  and/or  resettlement  costs, \ngrievances  can  be  lodged  with  the  village  committee.  If  no  agreement  is  reached  within  \n2  weeks,  the  complainant  has  1  month  to  elevate  the  grievances  to  the  county  land \nmanagement bureau or the PIA. If still unresolved within 2 weeks, the PPMO will try to achieve \na solution. The final redress would be sought, if necessary, in the civil courts, in accordance with \nthe Administrative Procedure Law of the PRC.  \n \nH. \n \n19. \nFollowing  the  requirements  of  ADB,  compensation  and  resettlement  issues  will  be \nmonitored  using  both  internal  and  external  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  monitoring  is  to \nfor  resettlement  and \nestablish \nrehabilitation.  After  completion  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  the  PPMO  will  prepare  a \ncompletion report and submit it to ADB. \n \n\nthat  affected  parties  or  villages  receive  compensation \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\nGrievance Procedures \n\n \n\n\f68     Appendix 11 \n\nInternal  resettlement  monitoring  will  be  carried  out  by  the  respective  PIAs.  During  the \n20. \nland  acquisition  stage,  the  PPMO  will  collect  records  of  impacts,  compensation  payments, \nemployment activities, training, and grievances. The PPMO will compile these individual project \nreports, as relevant, into an overall resettlement progress report for the subprojects and submit \nit  to  ADB  as  part  of  quarterly  reporting  on  the  Project  until  land  acquisition  and  compensation \nactivities are completed.  \n \n21. \nFor external resettlement monitoring and evaluation, a local sociologist will be contracted \nfor 1 person-month per annum for 4 years to assess and report socioeconomic progress based \non independent monitoring and evaluation of land compensation activities. The monitoring and \nevaluation will be based on site visits and key informants. The independent monitor will assess \nwhether (i) project implementation is in compliance with the policies and entitlements set out in \nthe  resettlement  plan,  (ii)  the  affected  people  have  fully  restored  their  livelihoods,  and  (iii)  the \naffected  people  have  directly  benefited \nthe  Project.  The  monitor  should  make \nfrom \nrecommendations  to  improve  implementation.  The  resettlement  monitoring  and  evaluation \nshould  be  carried  out  once  every  year  and  an  annual  report  prepared  for  submission  to  ADB \nand the PPMO. \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["ADB \nEIA \nEIRR \nEMP \nFYP \nGEF \nHPCMA \nIEE \nIEM \nIWRM \nIWRMP \nLIBOR \nNARB \nNFD \nNHAR \nNHARG \nNSFG \nNWRD \nPIA \nPIU \nPPMO \nPPMS \nPRC \nTA \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Currency Unit\nCNY1.00\n$1.00\n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 5 August 2008) \n \n\u2013 \n= \n= \n \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n", "yuan (CNY)  \n$0.14575 \nCNY6.86120 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nenvironmental impact assessment \neconomic internal rate of return  \nenvironmental management plan \nfive-year plan \nGlobal Environment Facility \nHelan piedmont conservation management area \ninitial environmental examination \nintegrated ecosystem management \nintegrated water resource management \nintegrated water resource management plan \nLondon interbank offered rate \nNingxia Agricultural Reclamation Bureau  \nNingxia Finance Department \nNingxia Hui Autonomous Region \nNingxia Hui Autonomous Region government \nNingxia State Farm Group \nNingxia Water Resources Department \nproject implementing agency \nproject implementation unit \nprovincial project management office \nproject performance management system \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \ntechnical assistance \n", " \n \nWEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n \nhectare \nkilometer \nsquare kilometer \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "ha \nkm \nkm2 \n", "NOTES \n \n", " \n \n", " \n", "(i) \n", "(ii) \n", "The fiscal year of the Government and its agencies ends on 31 December.
