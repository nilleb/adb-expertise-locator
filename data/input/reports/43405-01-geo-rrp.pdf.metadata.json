It  will  (i)  improve  infrastructure  by  rehabilitating, \nreconstructing,  and  expanding  WSS  services;  (ii)  strengthen  institutional  effectiveness  by  (a) \nimproving  the  technical  and  management  capacities  of  the  key  WSS  service  provider,  the \nUnited  Water  Supply  Company  of  Georgia  Limited  Liability  Company  (UWSCG),  by  procuring \nthe  services  of  an  internationally  reputed  water  operator  to  act  as  a  management  contractor, \nenabling  it  to  provide  efficient  WSS  services;  and  (b)  developing  the  capacity  of  sector \nregulators  to  regulate  tariffs,  services  standards,  environmental  protection,  and  drinking  water \nquality in the long term; and (iii) support the investment program implementation.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n1. \n\nSocioeconomic Context \n\n3. \nGeorgia  has  a  population  of  4.43  million  and  serves  as  an  important  nodal  point  for \ninterregional trade flows connecting the South Caucasus and landlocked Central Asia with the \nBlack  Sea  and  Mediterranean  basins.  The  country\u2019s  current  gross  domestic  product  is  $10.5 \nbillion,  with  annual  growth  of  5.9%  in  2004\u20132009. With  global  recovery  taking  hold,  Georgia\u2019s \ngross  domestic  product  grew  by  6.6%  in  the  first  half  of  2010  on  account  of  high  growth  in \nmanufacturing, trade, and transportation.  \n \n4. \nForeign  direct  investment  (FDI)  in  Georgia  is  one  of  the  principal  drivers  of  economic \ngrowth over  the  last  5  years  and  is  a major  balancing factor for  a sizeable trade  deficit.  While \nFDI  declined  sharply  in  2008-2009  due  to  global  financial  crisis,  it  was  counterbalanced  by \ngrowing  remittances  and  current  account  surpluses  in  2010.  The  service  sector  accounted \nconsistently for a predominant share of total FDI, averaging nearly 60%, and continues to create \nemployment  in  urban  centers  and  secondary  towns.  Based  on  third  quarter  2010  figures,  the \ngovernment expects FDI to reach 2009 levels and improve over time. By creating employment \nin  secondary  towns,  the  government  will  reduce  poverty  and  complement  its  targeted  social \nassistance program to improve living standards for the poor.3 \n \n5. \nNew  employment  opportunities  will  bring  further  rural-to-urban  migration  and  burden \ninfrastructure and municipal service provision, such as WSS, in cities and secondary towns, with \ngrowing environmental impact and concomitant public health implications.4  Improved municipal \nservices,  and  specifically  WSS,  are  therefore  a  key  government  priority.  This  is  highlighted  in \nthe  context  of  major  urban  centers,  such  as  Kutaisi,  Poti,  Rustavi,  Tbilisi,  and  Zugdidi  where \nlarger  populations  increase  demand  for  municipal  services  and  apply  greater  pressure  on \nservice delivery. Urban centers in traditional tourist destinations such as Kobuleti, Batumi, and, \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to Georgia for Preparing a Multitranche Financing Facility for the Urban Services \n\nImprovement Investment Program. Manila (TA 7487-GEO, for $493,500, approved on 5 January).  \n\n3  Around 21% of the country\u2019s population live in poverty, including 8.8% in extreme poverty. \n4   About 2.34 million people, or 53% of total population, reside in urban centers. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nmost  recently,  Mestia  serve  as  important  magnets  for  tourists  and  are  expected  to  witness \nsimilar pressures on municipal service delivery in the medium term. \n \n\n2. \n\nSector Problems and Constraints \n\n6. \nInstitutional  arrangements.  The  State  Commission  on  Water  Supply  and  Energy \ndirects  WSS  policy,  and  the  Ministry  of  Regional  Development  and  Infrastructure  (MRDI)  is \nresponsible for  developing  infrastructure,  guiding  investment,  and  administering  line  agencies. \nSector  regulatory  bodies  include  the  Georgia  National  Energy  and  Water  Supply  Regulatory \nCommission  (GNEWSRC)  for  service  standard  and  economic  regulation,  the  Ministry  of \nEnvironmental  Protection  and  Natural  Resources  (MEPNR)  for  environmental  monitoring,  and \nthe Ministry of Agriculture (MA) for monitoring drinking water quality.  \n \nService  providers.  Following  reforms  and  consolidation  during  2008\u20132010, 5  WSS \n7. \nservices across Georgia are now provided by (i) Georgia Water and Power Company (GWPC) \nserving  Tbilisi  and  Rustavi,6 (ii)  Batumi  Water  Company  (BWC)  and  Kobuleti  Water  Company \n(KWC)  serving  the  Adjara  Autonomous  Republic,7 and  (iii)  UWSCG8 serving  the  rest  of  the \ncountry.  Improving  WSS  services  delivered  by  UWSCG  is  central  to  the  government\u2019s \nassessment of investment needs in the sector because (i) UWSCG covers 90% of the country\u2019s \ngeographic  area  and  60%  of  its  population,  especially  in  the  economically  strategic  urban \ncenters,  and  (ii)  WSS  services  provided  by  GWPC  and  the  Adjara  water  companies  are \nseparately  governed.  The  services  provided  by  the  privatized  GWPC  are  governed  through  a \ncontract with the government, and services provided by the Adjara organizations are governed \nby the Adjara Autonomous Region. \n \n8. \nTechnical  sustainability  and  environmental  protection.  While  88%  of  the  country\u2019s \nurban  population  has  access  to  piped  water,  only  70%  of  the  urban  population  in  the  region \nserved by UWSCG has piped water supply. Only 15% of the urban population in that region has \naccess to a reticulated sewage disposal system. The absence of sewage treatment plants and \nnonfunctional  sewage  treatment  plants  in  certain  towns  and  cities  harm  the  environment  by \npolluting rivers and streams. \n \nFinancial  sustainability.  UWSCG  is  a  fledgling  organization  and  currently  refining  its \n9. \nbusiness processes with assistance from development partners. UWSCG\u2019s revenue budget for \n2010 was $19.5 million. Its financial management requires significant improvement, as revenue \ncollection  stood  at  72%  (49%  domestic  and  94%  other)  in  the  first  half  of  2010,  during  which \nrevenue  was  $3.62  million  and  expenditure  $6.65  million,  thus  requiring  a  50%  government \nsubsidy.9 The  average  domestic  WSS  tariff  set  by  GNEWSRC  since  2010  is  $0.15  per  cubic \nmeter,  against  a  cost  recovery  tariff  of  $0.21  per  cubic  meter  as  estimated  by  UWSCG.  With \npoor collection efficiency, the operating ratio (expenditures to revenue) is expected to increase \nover time if adequate revenue enhancement measures are not expeditiously pursued. \n\n                                                \n5   Reforms included amalgamating 66 local water companies across the country. \n6   GWPC manages the Gardabani, Mskheta, Rustavi, and Tbilisi water companies, which were privatized in 2008. \n7   WSS improvement in the Adjara Autonomous Republic is financed by German development cooperation through \n\nKfW.  BWC and KWC report to the Adjara Autonomous Region.  \n\n8   UWSCG is a public limited liability company established in 2010 and wholly owned by the government. While it has \nits own day-to-day management team, it is controlled by and reports to MRDI.  Following reform and restructuring, \nUWSCG owns and operates a range of WSS sector assets located in the areas it services, many of which were \nformerly  owned  by  local  governments  and  water  companies.  Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Water  Supply  and \nSanitation (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n9   Revenue collection from domestic consumers is poor because consumers resist paying for poor service. \n\n\f3. \n\nSector Policy, Strategy, and Road Map \n\n10. \nImproved  urban  WSS  service  is  a  key  priority  of  the  government,  as  it  is  essential  to \nimproving the quality of life, attracting investment, and raising productivity and competitiveness. \nRecognizing  the  need  to  overcome  current  problems  and  constraints,  the  government\u2019s  urban \nWSS  sector  development  plan  (SDP)  for  2011\u20132020,  approved  on  31  January  2011,  aims  to \nensure continuous and reliable water supply and safe sanitation services to all urban residents \nby  2020.  The  SDP\u2019s  policy  and institutional  reform  framework  has  a  strong focus  on  technical \nsustainability  of  WSS  services,  environmental  and  natural  resource  protection,  public-private \npartnerships,  tariff  rationalization,  prudent  financial  management,  and \nimproved  sector \nregulation through an enabling legislative and regulatory frameworks for WSS services.  \n \nThe long-term investment plan (2011\u20132020) under the SDP is estimated at $1.65 billion, \n11. \ncomprising  physical10 and  nonphysical  investments  to  address  medium-term  (2011\u20132015)  and \nlong-term (2016\u20132020) needs (Table 1).  \n \n\nTable 1: Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Investment Plan Estimates \n($ million) \n\nItem \nInfrastructure improvement \nInstitutional effectiveness \nProject management \nTotal \n \n\n2011\u20132015 \n1,285.00 \n15.00 \n45.00 \n1,345.00 \n\n2016\u20132020 \n285.00 \n5.00 \n10.00 \n300.00 \n\nTotal \n1,570.00 \n20.00 \n55.00 \n1,645.00 \n\nShare of Total (%) \n95.44 \n1.22 \n3.34 \n100.00 \n\nSource: Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure estimates. \n \n12. \nThe SDP objectives are fully consistent with the approach agreed between Georgia and \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  the  purposes  of  ADB\u2019s  assistance  program  in  the \ncountry11 and  in  line  with  the  principal  elements  of  ADB\u2019s  water  policy12 and  ADB\u2019s  proposed \nwater operational framework 2020. \n \n\n4. \n\nDevelopment Partner Coordination \n\nDevelopment  partner  coordination  has  in  the  past  provided  the  government  with \n13. \nopportunities  to  synergize  interventions  and  capitalize  on  available  best  practices.  The  World \nBank  and  ADB  have  provided  a  significant  portion  of  the  funds  invested  in  improving  the \ncountry\u2019s WSS  infrastructure.13 Lessons  are that  physical  investment  requirements  exceed the \nfinancing  available  from  any  individual  institution  and  should  be  combined  with  significant \nreforms in the sector to improve the quality of WSS services. Regular consultations were held \nwith  the  European  Investment  Bank  and  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and \nDevelopment to coordinate interventions, identify synergies and cooperation opportunities, and \nexclude  overlap  and  duplication.  ADB  will  consider  joint  and  parallel  cofinancing  partnerships \nduring subsequent tranches of the MFF and during investment program implementation. \n \n\n                                                \n10 Physical investments are identified for UWSCG alone, as GWPC, BWC, KWC, and Adjara local self-governments \n\nhave or will develop their own investment plans, given their autonomous management structures. \n\n11 ADB. 2007.

The outcome of the investment program is \nimproved WSS services in these secondary towns.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nComponent 1: Infrastructure Improvement \n\n15. \nThe first component will support infrastructure investments to rehabilitate, improve, and \nexpand WSS facilities  in  six  secondary  towns  and  benefit approximately 335,000 residents,  or \n38% of urban residents in the region served by UWSCG (about 7.6% and 14.3% of the total and \nurban  population,  respectively,  in  Georgia).14 This  includes  system  optimization  and  resource \nrationalization  to  improve  service  efficiency.  It  will  provide  vehicles  and  equipment  for  system \noperation  and  maintenance  and  for  assessing  system  performance  in these  towns.  It  will  also \nhelp  Georgia  reduce  its carbon footprint  by  reducing greenhouse gas  emissions  and installing \nenergy efficient systems. \n \n\n2. \n\nComponent 2: Institutional Effectiveness \n\n16. \nThe second component will develop capacity in MRDI, MEPNR, MA, and GNEWSRC to \nsupport  more  effective  regulation  of  WSS  services.  It  will  finance  the  services  of  an \ninternationally  reputed  water  operator  as  a  management  contractor,  to  improve  UWSCG\u2019s \ntechnical,  management,  and financial  performance,  all  fundamental  for  efficient WSS  delivery. \nThrough these improvements, UWSCG will boost its revenues and creditworthiness. Over a 3-\nyear  period,  the  management  contractor  will  assist  UWSCG  in  managing  its  operations  and \nimproving the delivery of WSS services. By substituting for top and key management staff in the \nUWSCG  head  office  and  regional  branches,  the  management  contractor  will  undertake  long-\nterm  capital  planning  and  asset  strengthening,  procurement,  the  supervision  of  capital \nimprovement works, system operation and maintenance, and improved financial management, \nincluding \nrevenue  collection  efficiency  and  expenditure  management.  The \nmanagement contractor\u2019s fees will have fixed and variable components, with the latter linked to \nperformance  indicators  and  targets.  An  outline  scope  of  work  is  detailed  in  the  facility \nadministration manual (FAM).15 \n \n\nimproved \n\n3. \n\nComponent 3: Project Implementation Support \n\n17. \nThe  third  component  will  support  project  implementation  with  focus  on  detailed \nengineering; construction supervision; procurement; safeguards compliance; preparation of the \nsubsequent  tranches  of  the  investment  program;  and  a  public  awareness  program  on  health, \nhygiene,  sanitation,  and  water  conservation.  Consumer  feedback  through  knowledge,  attitude, \nand practice surveys will inform the design of the capacity-building programs. \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n18. \nGeorgia  has  requested  a  MFF  in  an  amount  up  to  $500  million  from  ADB's  ordinary \ncapital resources (OCR) and Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund (ADF)) to help \n\n                                                \n14 Kutaisi and Poti are being developed as special economic or free industrial zones, Marneuli and Zugdidi have agro-\n\nprocessing industries, and Mestia and Anaklia are being developed as tourist centers. \n15 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\ffinance  the  investment  program,  which  will  support  in  turn  a  slice  of  the  SDP\u2019s  medium-term \ninvestment requirement.

On  account  of  its \nflexibility  and  ability  to  finance  investments  sequentially  as  each  tranche  becomes  ready  for \nimplementation,  the  MFF  allows  Georgia  to  focus  on  implementation  and  strengthen  the \ninstitutional  and  regulatory  framework.  By  phasing  investments  over  time,  the  MFF  approach \nwould  help Georgia  manage  its  development  financing  more  efficiently.  With  the  certainty  that \nthe basic investments will be covered, the MFF will also help Georgia focus on attracting greater \nprivate  sector  participation.  For  instance,  the  government  is  working  with  ADB  to  structure \nconstruction and management of sewage treatment plants on a design-build-operate basis. \n \n20. \nThe  MFF  is  anticipated  to  consist  of  four  tranches,  subject  to  the  government's \nsubmission  of  related  periodic  financing  requests,  execution  of  the  related  loan  and  project \nagreements for each tranche, and fulfillment of terms and conditions and undertakings set forth \nin  the  framework  financing  agreement.  The  OCR  financing  will  follow  the  ordinary  operations \nloan  regulations  applicable  to  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  loans,  subject  to \npossible  modifications  under  individual  loan  agreements.  The  ADF  financing  will  follow  the \nspecial  operations  loan  regulations,  subject  to  possible  modifications  under  individual  loan \nagreements.. \n \nThe first tranche, for $80 million equivalent, will be financed by the ADF and have a 32-\n21. \nyear term, including a grace period of 8 years, an annual interest rate of 1% per annum during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin the loan and project agreements for tranche 1. Interest during construction will be capitalized \nin the loan. For the first tranche, the government will relend  part of the loan to UWSCG under \nthe same terms and conditions, and in dollars. Foreign exchange risk will be borne by UWSCG. \nThe remainder of the loan will be made available to MRDI. The government critically needs ADF \nresources to immediately invest in much-needed infrastructure and limit the financial burden on \nUWSCG.  Since  the  investments  are  accompanied  by  reforms,  ADF  resources  will  provide \nUWSCG  the flexibility  it  requires to  initially  improve  its financial  management  with limited  debt \nburden and position it to absorb OCR resources in the later years. \n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nThe  government  has  specifically  requested  flexibility  in  the  use  of  ADF  resources  for \n22. \nsubsequent  tranches.  It  is  understood that  the  provision  of  any  such  additional  ADF  financing \nwill entail a corresponding reduction in OCR financing available, so that total financing provided \nby  ADB  under  the  MFF  will  not  exceed  the  aggregate  principal  amount  of  $500  million \nequivalent.  Any  additional  ADF  allocation  will  be  subject  to  (i)  the  general  availability  of  ADF \nresources  from  time  to  time,  (ii)  Georgia\u2019s  access  to  such  resources  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  then \napplicable Graduation  Policy16 and  the requirements  of  ADF donors,  and  (iii)  the  availability  of \nsuch resources to Georgia pursuant to ADB\u2019s then applicable policy on the performance-based \nallocation of ADF resources.17 The financing plan is summarized in Table 3. \n \n\nTable 3: Financing Plan \n\nGovernment\u2019s \nInvestment \nPlan \n($ million) \n500.00 \n300.00 \n845.00 \n1,645.00 \n\nTotal \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nCofinanciersa \nGovernment \n \n\u2026 = not available. \na  Under discussion. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nShare of \nTotal \n(%) \n30.40 \n18.24 \n51.36 \n100.00 \n\n \n\nInvestment \nProgram \n($ million) \n500.00 \n\u2026 \n125.00 \n625.00 \n\n \n \n \n \n\nShare \nof \nTotal \n(%) \n80.00 \n\u2026 \n20.00 \n100.00 \n\nProject 1 \n($ million) \n80.00 \n\u2026 \n25.00 \n105.00 \n\nShare of \nTotal \n(%) \n76.19 \n\u2026 \n23.81 \n100.00 \n\n23.  MRDI will be the investment program's executing agency and the implementing agency \nfor  component  2;  UWSCG  will  be  the  implementing  agency for  components  1 and  3. Through \nthe  investment  program,  MRDI  will  play  an  important  role  in  implementing  the  nonphysical \ninvestments identified in the SDP and address its policy and institutional reform agenda.

Project 1 has three components: \n \n\n(i)  Component 1: Infrastructure improvement. (a) Water treatment and supply facilities \nand water transmission systems constructed in Anaklia, Marneuli, Mestia, and Zugdidi; \nand (b) vehicles and system performance assessment and maintenance equipment for \nWSS operation and maintenance procured in six investment program towns. \n\n(ii)  Component  2:  Institutional  effectiveness.  (a)  Management  contractor  support \nthrough  an  international  water  operator  provided  to  UWSCG,  and  (b)  capacity \ndeveloped  in  MRDI,  MEPNR,  MA,  and  GNEWSRC  on  regulatory  functions.  This \ncomponent  will  run  through  the  period  of  project  1  and  overlap  with  subsequent \nprojects.  The  outcomes  of  the  management  contract  will  provide  the  government  a \nbasis and scope for enhancing and extending private sector participation in the sector. \n\n(iii)  Component  3:  Project  implementation  support.  Support  provided  to  UWSCG  for \ndetailed  engineering;  construction  supervision;  procurement;  safeguards  compliance; \npreparing  subsequent  projects  of  the  investment  program;  and  a  public  awareness \nprogram on health, hygiene, sanitation, and water conservation. \n\n \n25. \nAn ongoing ADB technical assistance to develop a geospatial WSS utility management \nsystem18 and consultants appointed for developing detailed engineering designs under advance \ncontracting  actions  will  provide  designs  and  cost  estimates  for  WSS  network  rehabilitation  or \nreconstruction,  and  parameters  for  constructing  treatment  plants  on  a  design-build-operate \nbasis.    Construction  of  WSS  networks  in  all  six  investment  program  towns  will  be  distributed \nacross  subsequent  projects  planned  over  the  next  three  years.  Investments  will  be  packaged \ninto  distinct  contracts  based  on  hydraulic  zones  in  each  town  and  will  include  simultaneous \nconstruction of WSS systems. Sewage treatment plant construction will be staggered based on \nWSS  network  completion  plans.  Civil  works  contracts  will  combine  construction  and  extended \ndefect-liability  periods  to  ensure  contractors  maintain  and  remain  accountable  for  system \nperformance  for  3  years  after  the  completion  and  commissioning  of  the  system.  The  MFF  is \ndesigned to include system operation and maintenance cost over the immediate 3-year period \nbeyond  the  completion  and  commissioning  of  infrastructure  to  provide  funds  for  service \nsustainability. \n\n                                                \n18 ADB.  2010.

Project 1 is financially viable, as the average financial internal rate \nof  return  in  the  base  case  is  7.6%,  which  exceeds  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital, \nestimated at 2.2%. Sensitivity analysis indicates that subprojects\u2019 financial internal rate of return \nis  viable  under  stressed  conditions,  except  for  Zugdidi  under  a  20%  increase  in  capital  costs, \nillustrating  the  need  to  efficiently  estimate  market  rates  for  construction  items  to  reduce \nsubstantial  variance  in  capital  costs,  efficiently  implement  the  project,  and  rapidly  achieve \nphysical  and  financial  targets.  To  achieve  an  operating  ratio  of  less  than  unity,  project  1  will \nensure  (i)  progressive  tariff  increases  based  on  the  principles  of  cost  recovery  and  consumer \naffordability,  and  (ii)  the  availability  of  viability  gap  funding  for  service  sustainability,  including \ncounterpart funds and subventions for operation and maintenance and total debt service.19 \n \nEconomic  analysis.  Economic  analysis  was  based  on  the  results  of  a  socioeconomic \n27. \nsurvey  covering  1,600  randomly  sampled  households  in  six  secondary  towns  and  available \nnational  statistics,  especially  from  the  Department  of  Statistics.  Focus  group  discussions \nprovided  further  substantiation  on  service  perception  and  demand  for  services.  Project  1  is \neconomically viable, as the average economic internal rate of return in the base case is 19.5%, \nwhich  exceeds  the  economic opportunity  cost  of  capital,  assumed  at  12%.  Sensitivity  analysis \nfound economic viability stressed under various conditions, especially increased capital costs.20 \n\n \nGovernance \n\nB. \n\n28. \nPublic  financial  management  reform  is  a  priority  for  the  government,  and  the  Budget \nCode  adopted  in  2009  streamlined  the  budgeting  process.  The  basic  data  and  directions \ndocument  became  binding  with  the  legislation,  and  government  agencies\u2019  budgeting  and \nexpenditure  management  now  follows  the  basic  data  and  directions.  A  financial  management \nassessment  of  UWSCG  indicated  that  significant  work  is  required  to  improve  its  financial \nmanagement,  accounting,  and  auditing,  which  the  proposed  management  contractor  under \ncomponent 2 will be tasked to improve. A procurement assessment indicated the need to build \nUWSCG  staff  capacity  in  ADB  procurement  procedures.  Recognizing  the  requirement  early  in \nproject preparation, ADB supported UWSCG\u2019s procuring consulting services and goods through \nadvance  actions,  thereby  providing  on-the-job  training.  Civil  works  will  be  procured  with \nassistance from consulting firms. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government,  MRDI,  and  UWSCG.  Specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the FAM. \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nC. \n\n29. \nProject  1  will  directly  benefit  100,000  urban  residents  (4.3%  of  the  country\u2019s  urban \npopulation) and improve living conditions and the economic and urban environment of Anaklia, \nMarneuli, Mestia, and Zugdidi. Tourists in Anaklia and Mestia  will benefit from improved water \nsupply. Specifically, beneficiaries will include (i) households affected when members become ill \nbecause  of  insufficient  water  or  its  poor  quality  and  (ii)  the  poor,  internally  displaced,  and \nhouseholds  headed  by  women. 20 The  poverty  and  social  assessment  indicates  that  women \nstrongly  support  the  investment  program.  Women  perceive  that  it  will  improve  their  living \n\n                                                \n19 Analysis and Cash Flow Statements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fenvironment,  create  employment,  and  reduce  the  incidence  of  waterborne  illness.  Gender \nfeatures are integrated into the gender action plan that will include women in consultation and \nsurveys  for  developing  a  marketing  campaign;  women-focused  customer  care  services;  and \nawareness programs on health, hygiene, and consumer rights.21 \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\nthree \n\n(IEEs), \n\nEnvironment.  Based  on \n\ninitial  environmental  examinations \n\n30. \nthe \nenvironmental  classification  for  project  1  is  B,  as  it  will  not  have  significant  irreversible \nenvironmental  impacts  during  or  after  construction. 22  Consultation  was  undertaken  with \nstakeholders, and the IEE documents were translated in Georgian and displayed in each town. \nUWSCG will require the contractor to refine and implement the environmental management plan \nprepared  in  the  IEEs,  which  will  also  form  an  integral  part  of  construction  contracts.  The \ngovernment  adopted  an  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  on  17  December \n2010, and environmental safeguards compliance for subsequent projects will be based on  it.23 \nUWSCG does not meet certain legal requirements for environmental protection, as it discharges \ninto water bodies domestic sewage that does not meet environmental standards. Due to recent \nsector  restructuring,  it  is  not  currently  licensed  to  abstract  water  as  required.  Through  the \ninvestment program, UWSCG will construct sewage treatment plants and secure licenses for all \nwater  abstraction  sites  in  the  six  investment  program  towns,  thereby  ensuring  environmental \nand natural resource protection. \n \n31. \nInvoluntary  resettlement.  Project  1  currently  includes  a  resettlement  plan  for  the \nMestia  water intake and transmission facilities, with impact limited to temporary disturbance to \nland and lost hay within the pipeline corridor.24 As UWSCG will ensure that affected people are \ncompensated  in line  with  detailed  engineering  design estimates  confirming  pipeline  alignment, \nand prior to civil works commencement, project 1 is classified B. The government adopted on 17 \nDecember  2010  a  resettlement  framework  upon  which  social  safeguards  compliance  for \nsubsequent projects will be based.25 \n \n32. \nIndigenous  peoples. The investment program area does not include communities that \nmay  be  defined  as  indigenous  peoples  under  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The \nindigenous peoples' impact classification for all projects is C. \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n33.
