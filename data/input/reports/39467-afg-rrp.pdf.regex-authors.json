The \nsummary is attached as an appendix. \n   \nProject Description  The  Project  is  to  (i)  rehabilitate  the  Mazar-e-Sharif\u2013Dara-i-Suf \nroad  (140.3  kilometers  [km])  and  the  Bamian\u2013Yakawlang  road \n(98.9 km), (ii) install cross-border facilities in Spin Boldak, (iii) \nsupport campaigns to prevent HIV/AIDS and increase awareness \nof human trafficking; (iv) provide support for project management \nand monitoring, and (v) provide project management support to \nthe Ministry of Public Works (MPW).  \n \nRationale  Since rehabilitation of roads started after more than two decades \nof conflict, the focus of the road rehabilitation program has been \nthe reconstruction and completion of the regional highways. Once \nthe  current  or  planned  projects  are  completed  by  2008,  the \nexisting regional highway network will be improved to a two-lane \nbitumen-paved road standard, with certain four-lane sections near \nKabul  and  Kandahar.  In  contrast,  more  than  90%  of  national \nhighways  and  provincial  roads  are  either  earth  or  gravel,  and \nmore than 60% are in poor condition. Many are impassable at \nspecific locations such as rivers and where severe erosion or \nlandslides have occurred. Except for newly constructed bridges, \nmost bridges and culverts along national highways and provincial \nroads are in bad condition. Many are in danger of collapse from \nheavily loaded vehicles or of being washed away.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s next priority is development of the north\u2013south \nand east\u2013west corridors, which connect the ring road horizontally \nand  perpendicularly  and  improves  access  for  people  living  in \nremote areas at the center of the country.  \n \nDuring the first phase of road rehabilitation, after resuming its \noperation in Afghanistan in 2002, the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) gave priority attention to rehabilitation of regional highways, \nparticularly  the  ring  road,  with  emphasis  on  trade  links  to \nneighboring countries, including bridges, disintegrated pavement, \ndrainage  erosion  protection,  and  routine  maintenance.  With \nrehabilitation  of  regional  highways  nearing  completion,  ADB  is \nplacing   priority    on   connecting   the   ring   road   through    the \n ", "ii   \n  north\u2013south corridor or the east\u2013west corridor as recommended \nby  the  road  master  plan  prepared  with  ADB  assistance.  The \nproject roads comprise the north\u2013south and east\u2013west corridors, \nwhich connect the central of the country to the major cities such \nas Mazar-e-Sharif and Kabul, through which the ring road passes. \n \nAfghanistan has made significant progress since the ouster of the \nTaliban regime. The Government has implemented a wide range \nof  structural  reforms  and  adhered  to  almost  all  quantitative \nindicators and structural benchmarks under the Staff-Monitored \nProgram, led by the International Monetary Fund. Notwithstanding \nthese achievements and sustained economic growth over the last \n2  years,  the  economic  and  fiscal  situation  continues  to  be \nextremely fragile. Security, economic, social, and administrative \nchallenges are formidable. Afghanistan continues to need external \ndevelopment finance that does not fiscally burden the nascent \nadministration. To achieve growth targets over the medium term, \nthe  Government  must  aim  for  broad-based  and  sustainable \ndevelopment and identify new drivers of growth. Investment in the \nroad sector is a prerequisite for sustained economic growth, and \nthe grant will greatly help accelerate this transition.  \n \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The Project will help the Government to promote economic and \nsocial  development,  and  reduce  poverty  by  rehabilitating  the \nnational highway network to connect the central remote regions of \nAfghanistan to the ring road.  \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $140.9 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $1.7 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  A loan of $78.2 million and a grant of $40.0 million from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Fund resources will be provided. The proposed loan will \nhave a term of 40 years, including a grace period of 10 years, with \nan annual interest rate of 1% per annum. The total amount of the \ninterest charge during the grace period will be capitalized and \ncharged to the loan account. The grant will finance (i) resettlement \ncosts,  (ii)  civil  works  for  the  Bamian\u2013Yakawlang  road,  (iii) \ncampaigns to prevent HIV/AIDS and human trafficking, and (iv) \nincremental project management support. The loan will finance (i) \ncivil  works  for  the  Mazar-e-Sharif\u2013Dara-i-Suf  road,  (ii)  cross-\nborder facilities, and (iii) project management and monitoring.  \n \nThe ADB loan and grant totaling $118.2 million will finance 84 % \nof  the  project  cost,  excluding  land  acquisition,  and  taxes  and \nduties of $2.7 million, which will be incurred by the Government. \nThe Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction will provide an additional \ngrant  of  $20  million  to  finance  civil  works  for  the  Bamian\u2013\nYakawlang road.  \n   \n ", "  iii\nEstimated Project  31 December 2010 \nCompletion Date \n   \nPeriod of Loan and Grant  Loan: 1 July 2007\u250030 June 2017 \nUtilization  Grant: 30 June 2011 \n   \nExecuting Agencies  Ministry of Public Works (MPW ), Ministry of Finance (MOF), and \nMinistry of Public Health (MOPH) \n   \nImplementation  The  Project  will  be  implemented  by  the  existing  Project \nArrangements  Management Unit, which handles the ongoing ADB road projects. \nMPW  will  assign  a  team  of  two  engineers,  one  land/revenue \nofficer,  and  one  office  administrator  to  the  site  offices  of  the \nproject management consultants so that they can liaise with the \nproject management consultants, contractors, local governments, \nand people in the project areas. MPW staff, stationed in the field, \nwill handle day-to-day project implementation.  \n \nThe component of cross-border facilities will be implemented by \nMOF\u2019s Customs Department. The director general of the Customs \nDepartment  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  project \nimplementation. \n \nMOPH will implement the component on HIV/AIDS prevention and \nanti-human trafficking awareness campaign. \n \n   \nProcurement  Procurement of goods, services, and civil works to be financed \nunder the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines. Civil works contracts will be procured \nthrough  international  competitive  bidding.  A  single-stage,  two-\nenvelope  procedure  (without  prequalification)  will  be  used. \nEquipment for cross-border facilities will be procured by limited \ninternational  bidding.  All  international  procurement  will  be \nundertaken by the Government procurement unit operating under \nthe Afghanistan Reconstruction and Development Services. \n \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n ", "iv   \nConsulting Services  Two consultant teams and two individual consultants will be hired \nto  help  MPW,  MOF,  and  MOPH  implement  the  Project.  The \nconsultant teams will (i) oversee overall project management; (ii) \nsupervise  construction  and  installation  of  equipment,  including \nreviewing detailed designs prepared by contractors; (iii) supervise \nimplementation of the HIV/AIDS component; (iv) certify completed \nworks by contractors; (v) provide on-the-job training for MPW staff \nassigned to the consultant team; and implement and supervise \nthe training component of the Project; and (vi) undertake benefit \nmonitoring and evaluation. The individual consultant will assist (i) \nMPW and the Afghan Reconstruction and Development Services \nin evaluating the technical and financial proposals for supervision \nconsultants, evaluating the proposals for civil works contracts, and \npreparing  final  bid  evaluation  reports;  and  (ii)  the  Customs \nDepartment of MOF in supervising procurement and installation of \ncross-border facilities. All consultants financed from the ADB loan \nwill  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will lead to both direct and indirect poverty reduction \nBeneficiaries  impacts. The direct poverty impact will be on income generation \nand  demand  for  unskilled  labor  and  wages  accruing  during \nconstruction of the project road. Other benefits will be lower travel \ntime  and  travel  costs,  and  higher  agricultural  product  profit \nmargins.  \n \nImproved roads will lead to a shift from subsistence agriculture to \nmarket-based  production  enabling  farmers  to  grow  perishable \ncommercial products like vegetables and fruits and transport them \nmore quickly to markets. The farmers in the provinces will be able \nto  diversify  their  cropping  patterns;  cultivate  high-value  crops; \ngrow larger marketable surpluses to improve their income earning \ncapacities;  and  generate  more  agricultural  wage  employment, \nparticularly benefiting the poor. \n \nImproved  road  conditions  will  lead  to  growth  of  affordable \ntransport  facilities  and  thus  the  poor,  especially  women  and \nchildren will have more reliable, affordable, and timely access to \neducational and medical facilities. Lower transportation costs will \nincrease  mobility  among  the  poor  to  find  employment \nopportunities  in  other  areas.  Increased  access  to  local  and \nnational markets will lead to growth of local trade and production \nactivities,  and  reduced  prices  of  agricultural  commodities  and \nother products. \n ", "  v\n  The benefit of the improved road in terms of reduction of vehicle \noperating costs will not only be transferred to the road users but \nwill  decrease  accident  deaths  and  disabilities  that  result  from \nextremely poor road conditions. Thus increased economic activity \nand easy access to social services are expected to significantly \nincrease household incomes and quality of life thereby reducing \noverall poverty incidence. \n \nRisks and Assumptions  The  risks  are  related  to  (i)  the  Government\u2019s  continued  weak \nimplementation  capacity,  including  the  timely  provision  of \ncounterpart  personnel;  (ii)  the  prevailing  security  situation, \nincluding  a  recent  increase  in  activities  by  antigovernment \nelements; (iii) possible increased trafficking of narcotics along the \nimproved roads; and (iv) an increase in HIV/AIDS transmission \nand/or human trafficking as a result of improved road connectivity \nand increased movement of people.  \n \nThese  risks  will  be  mitigated  to  the  greatest  extent  possible \nthrough (i) allocation of resources under the Project for consulting \nservices to facilitate project management and implementation, as \nwell  as  continued  technical  assistance  to  MPW;  (ii)  continued \nclose  monitoring  and  coordination  with  local  and  central \nauthorities, United Nations agencies, and International Security \nAssistance Force and coalition military establishments to ensure \nadequate  exchange  of  security-related  information;  (iii) \nimprovement of border procedures to contain narcotics trafficking; \nand  (iv)  development  of  mitigating  measures  by  the  project \ncomponent for the HIV/AIDS prevention and anti-human trafficking \nawareness campaign.  \n \n   \n  \nThe views expressed herein are those of

THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, (ii) a proposed grant, and (iii) proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction, in each case to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the \nNorth\u2013South Corridor Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n1.  Road Infrastructure \n \n2.  Afghanistan  is  a  landlocked  country.  With  a  large  area  (about  652,000  square \nkilometers)  and  an  estimated  population  of  22.8  million  widely  spread  across  the  largely \nmountainous terrain, roads are the principal means of transport. The road network comprises \nabout 3,300 kilometers (km) of regional highways, 4,900 km of national highways, 9,700 km of \nprovincial roads, 17,000\u201323,000 km of rural roads, and about 3,000 km of urban roads including \n1,060  km  in  Kabul.  Regional  highways  (comprising  the  2,300  km  ring  road  that  connects \nAfghanistan\u2019s  major  regional  centers  [Herat,  Kandahar,  Mazar-e-Sharif,  Maymaneh,  and \nSheberghan] with Kabul, and the roads linking to neighboring countries) foster regional trade \nand economic linkages between Afghanistan and neighboring countries such as Iran, Pakistan, \nTajikistan,  Turkmenistan,  and  Uzbekistan.  National  highways  extend  regional  highways  to \nprovincial capitals contributing to economic growth and national integration. Provincial roads \nimprove the administrative, trade, and economic contacts between district headquarters and \nrespective provincial capitals, and between important district headquarters; while rural roads \nbring remote areas into commercial contact with markets.  \n \n3.  Since rehabilitation of roads started after more than two decades of conflict, the road \nrehabilitation program has focused on reconstruction and completion of regional highways. \nOnce the current or planned projects are completed by 2008, the existing regional highway \nnetwork will be improved to a two-lane bitumen-paved road standard, with certain four-lane \nsections near Kabul and Kandahar. In contrast, more than 90% of national highways and \nprovincial roads are either earth or gravel, and over 60% are in poor condition. Many are \nimpassable at specific locations such as rivers and where severe erosion or landslides have \noccurred.  Except  for  newly  constructed  bridges,  most  bridges  and  culverts  along  national \nhighways and provincial roads are in poor condition. Many are in danger of collapse from \nheavily loaded vehicles or of being washed away.  \n \n2.  Road Transport Service \n \n4.  The number of vehicles has increased significantly over the past 2 years. According to \nstatistics  provided  in  a  recent  International  Monetary  Fund  country  report  on  Afghanistan, \ntransport of goods by road increased from 1.9 million tons in 2000, to 3.7 million tons in 2001 \nand 5 million tons in 2002, representing an almost fourfold increase. The number of taxicabs \nnearly  doubled  from  17,000  in  2000  to  33,500  in  2002.  More  than  147,000  vehicles  are \nestimated to be registered in Kabul. Most vehicles are owned and operated by the private sector \nas the Ministry of Transport-operated fleet has been severely depleted.  \n \n5.  The Afghan private sector has historically played a dominant role in trucking and has \nmaintained its presence, including individuals and firms that relocated in Pakistan during the war \n ", "2   \nyears. Long distance public transport, linking major cities and neighboring countries, which \ndeteriorated due to road and vehicle conditions as well as suppressed demand for road travel, \nhas been regaining its role. However, security remains a key impediment for its full-scale \nrestoration of operations.  \n \n6.  Urban  transport,  once  dominated  by  the  public  sector,  is  now  mostly  provided  by \nprivately owned buses, taxis, and minivans, but with little regulation. It is constrained by lack of \ntransport capacity; congestion, pollution; lack of accessibility; inadequate route coverage; poor \nroad condition; and lack of depots, stops, and terminals as well as designated road space. The \nurban transport system needs integrated planning. Vehicle fleet support services are mostly \nprivately  provided,  with  government  workshops  operating  poorly,  including  those  at  border \npoints. Forms of regional transport depend on the state of the roads and the availability of \nvehicles.  People  and  goods  move  together,  blurring  distinction  between  passenger  and \ncommercial freight traffic. Private agencies operate provincial and district routes. Some 165 \nregistered long-distance private bus companies are estimated to be operating\u2014101 based in \nKabul, 64 in the provinces\u2014with a total of 14,007 buses, mostly old minibuses and vans. \n \n3.  Road Sector Management \n \n7.  The Ministry of Public Works (MPW) is responsible for development, operation, and \nmaintenance of regional highways, national highways, and provincial roads in the country. It had \na large engineering organization with staff stationed in every major provincial capital carrying \nout work through force account. Over the course of the conflict, MPW lost most of its trained \nstaff. The current staff of 2,900 require substantial skill enhancement to perform their duties. \nThe Ministry of Rehabilitation and Rural Development is responsible for development of rural \ninfrastructure,  including  rural  roads.  Municipalities  are  responsible  for  the  construction  and \nmaintenance of urban roads. \n \n8.  The Ministry of Transport regulates the private sector transport industry. With a current \nstaffing level of 1,180, the ministry\u2019s primary function now is coordinating agreements between \nprivate sector and international transporters, and establishing offices in neighboring countries to \nfacilitate international trade. The ministry\u2019s private sector department sets technical standards \nfor private commercial vehicles and inspects them for compliance during the licensing and \nrenewal process. It collects a fee of 5% per carriage contract from private trucks and 3% per trip \nfrom interprovincial private buses, based on authorized charge rates. These fees are collected \nat national or provincial borders or the outskirts of major cities.  \n \n9.  Appendix 2 presents an analysis of the road sector.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n1.  Government Strategy for Road Sector Development  \n \n10.  The Government has identified reconstruction and rehabilitation of the road system, \nespecially of regional highways, as the country\u2019s top priority in reconstruction. Since 2002, with \nexternal assistance, the Government has been making massive efforts to reestablish the road \nnetwork, particularly for regional highways, to facilitate provision of basic social services to \nremote provinces, to provide security, and to involve all the population in undertaking nation-\nbuilding  activities.  Afghanistan  is  receiving  extensive  assistance  from  the  international  aid \ncommunity to reconstruct and develop the road network. For regional highways, almost $1.2 \nbillion has been provided or committed to rehabilitate 3,100 km of roads. These rehabilitation \n ", "  3\nworks will be completed by 2008. For national highways, about $270 million has been provided \nto reconstruct and improve 1,200 km of roads. These commitments are mainly to rehabilitate \ndamaged roads. \n \n11.  Anticipating the work on regional highways to be completed by 2008, the Government\u2019s \nnext priority is development of the north\u2013south and east\u2013west corridors, which connect the ring \nroad horizontally and perpendicularly and provide better access to people living in remote areas \nin  the  center  of  the  country.  The  Government  is  preparing  the  priority  road  development \nprogram for the next 10 years (2006\u20132015) in line with the recommendation of the road master \nplan being prepared with Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance.1 The least-cost option \nrecommended by the road master plan envisages (i) upgrading 281 km of high-traffic regional \nhighways  to  4  lanes,  (ii)  improving  2,700  km  of  high  priority  national  highways,  and  (iii) \nimproving  5,000  km  of  high  priority  provincial  roads.  The  required  road  expenditure  to \nimplement the recommended option is $1.7 billion, excluding ongoing projects with financing \nresources secured.  \n \n2.  ADB\u2019s Strategy \n \n12.  ADB places its first priority on rehabilitating the road system, which is critical for a \nlandlocked country. According to the Initial Country Strategy and Program (2002\u20132004),2 roads \nare needed to rebuild the economy by establishing major economic linkages domestically and \nwith neighboring countries. The strategic direction for the rehabilitation, reconstruction, and \ndevelopment of the road sector comprises (i) policy and institutional development; (ii) capacity \nbuilding;  (iii)  private  sector  development;  (iv)  employment  generation;  (v)  community \nparticipation; (vi) decentralization of network management; (vii) sustainable sector financing and \ncost  recovery;  (viii)  protection  and  preservation  of  the  environment;  (ix)  avoidance  and \nmitigation of resettlement; and (x) involvement of returnee refugees, ex-combatants, women, \nand the nongovernment organization (NGO) community in road construction and maintenance.  \n \n13.  During the first phase of road rehabilitation, after resuming its operation in Afghanistan in \n2002, ADB gave priority attention to rehabilitating regional highways, particularly the ring road, \nwith  emphasis  on  trade  links  to  neighboring  countries,  including  bridges,  disintegrated \npavement, drainage erosion protection, and routine maintenance. As rehabilitation of regional \nhighways is completed, ADB is focusing on connecting the ring road through the north\u2013south \nand east\u2013west corridors as recommended by the road master plan (para. 11). This is also in line \nwith the Government\u2019s priority investment projects identified for the national transport program. \nAccordingly, the Project is included in the Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008).3  \n \n3.  External Assistance and Aid Coordination \n \n14.  The ring road is being rehabilitated with financial and technical assistance (TA) from \nbilateral  and  multilateral  funding  agencies.  The  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment (USAID) and Japanese government provided support for rehabilitation of the \nKabul\u2013Kandahar road. USAID, and the Japanese and Saudi Arabian governments provided \nfinancing  for  rehabilitating  the  Kandahar\u2013Herat  road.  The  World  Bank  and  the  Islamic \nDevelopment Bank provided support for rehabilitation of the Kabul\u2013Doshi-Pul-e Khumri road, \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004.

Manila. \n ", "4   \nincluding  repair  of  Salang  tunnel.  ADB\u2019s  Emergency  Infrastructure  Rehabilitation  and \nReconstruction Project4 finances rehabilitation of the road from Pul-e Khumri via Mazar-e-Sharif \nto Andkhuouy. For the Herat\u2013Andkhuouy section, Iran provided support for the Herat\u2013Armalik \nroad, while ADB provided support for the Ankhoy\u2013Bala Murghab road. The remaining 183 km of \nthe Armalik\u2013Bala Murghab road will be rehabilitated by support from Saudi Arabia and the \nIslamic Development Bank.  \n \n15.  In 2004, ADB provided TA (footnote 7) for preparation of a road master plan, for a road \ndevelopment program for the next 5\u201310 years. The program is to promote efficient and effective \nroad rehabilitation focusing on identifying major east\u2013west and north\u2013south corridors to cross-\nlink  the  ring  road.  The  TA  will  also  assess  financing  requirements  for  sustainable  road \nmaintenance, and propose desirable and sustainable financing mechanisms. ADB\u2019s next phase \nassistance for road rehabilitation will be based on the road development program. Appendix 3 \nprovides a summary of external assistance provided for the road sector. \n \n4.  Road Maintenance \n \n16.  Routine  road  maintenance  expenditures  are  projected  to  increase  steadily  as  road \nprojects are completed: from $8 million in 2006 to $25 million in 2015. Periodic maintenance will \nnot be required until 2010, when expenditures will increase significantly to about $45 million per \nyear  from  2011  to  2015  when  the  regional  and  national  highway  projects  currently  under \nconstruction will require their first periodic maintenance.  \n \n17.  The most immediate maintenance requirement is for special maintenance works on \nnational highways and provincial roads of which maintenance has long been delayed, beginning \nwith an estimated $26 million in 2006 and gradually decreasing to $14 million in 2015 as the \nbacklog of work is eliminated. During 2006\u20132015, the need for special works will decrease while \nthe need for routine and periodic maintenance will increase, approximately balancing each \nother. During 2006\u20132010 the average annual requirement for routine, periodic, and backlog \nmaintenance ranges from $34 million to $47 million; this will increase to $87 million for 2011\u2013\n2015 because of the significant increase of periodic maintenance. \n \n18.  The expected road revenue falls far short of the required road maintenance expenditure. \nThe  main  source  of  road  revenue,  road  tolls  which  the  Government  will  reinstate  for \nrehabilitated regional highways, is expected to generate $13 million\u2013$23 million for 2006\u20132015 \non the basis of the toll rate of $0.005 per passenger car equivalent per km. Even considering \nvehicle registration fees currently collected and expected to generate $3 million\u2013$6 million per \nyear during 2006\u20132015, the expected road revenue will be able to finance about 30%\u201350% of \nthe road maintenance requirement.  \n \n19.  To relieve the shortfall of road revenue, the Government will evaluate other sustainable \nmethods for revenue generation such as setting up a dedicated road maintenance fund based \non fuel levies, vehicle licensing, and other road-user related taxes; and will complete this \nevaluation by December 2007. At present, fuel prices in Afghanistan rank among the lowest in \nthe region (about $0.5 per liter) with no tax levied except customs duty of 9%. Taxes on fuel in \nother  countries  range  from  13%  to  70%.  Based  on  fuel  usage  and  estimated  number  of \nvehicles, the total amount of fuel used for road transport is estimated at 582 million liters per \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2003.

Manila.  \n ", "  5\nyear, which can translate into $291 million in expenditure for fuel consumed by road users. If a \n10%\u201315% fuel tax is introduced, it will generate $29 million\u2013$48 million of additional road \nrevenue, which will be sufficient to cover the shortfall of current road revenue. The development \npartners\u2019 local consultative group, comprising major financiers such as the Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation, USAID, and World Bank, considers introduction of fuel tax as a key \nagenda item for policy dialogue and will continue its dialogue with the Government to secure \nstable financing sources for sustainable road maintenance. \n \n5.  Capacity Development  \n \n20.  Upon  resuming  its  operation  in  Afghanistan  in  2002,  ADB  focused  its  efforts  on \nstrengthening the capacity of MPW to implement aid-assisted projects. ADB has taken the \napproach of assigning a team of international and domestic experts to MPW to compensate for \nMPW\u2019s lack of capacity to implement large-scale projects, and provide on-the-job training for \nMPW  staff.  Under  the  ongoing  TA  cluster  for  Capacity  Building  for  Reconstruction  and \nDevelopment,5 ADB is providing such assistance for MPW to strengthen its capacity to plan and \nmanage projects. Under the Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project \nand the Andkhuouy\u2013Qaisar Road Project, the Project Implementation Unit established within \nMPW is gradually building capacity to handle day-to-day project implementation with the aid of \nproject management consultants. Several MPW staff have been attached to the contractor and \nthe  supervision  consultants  to  receive  on-the-job  training  in  project  administration  and \nimplementation.  \n \n21.  Although this arrangement of capacity strengthening worked well and contributed to \nbuilding MPW\u2019s capacity for project management, it focused on immediate needs for project \nimplementation  with  little  regard  to  long-term  sustainability  of  these  efforts.  Building  basic \ncapacity immediately after the civil strife and conflict might justify various piecemeal measures \nto quickly attend to urgent requirements. However, as MPW\u2019s operation is normalized with its \nattention shifting to long-term planning and quality control of road works from quick rehabilitation \nof damaged roads, the paradigm for capacity building of MPW needs to be changed from \nmeeting immediate needs to establishing a sustainable arrangement that is self-sufficient, with a \nminimum of external support.  \n \n22.  ADB\u2019s  capacity  building  assistance  is  now  designed  to  set  up  a  self-sustainable \nmechanism in strengthening MPW\u2019s capacity for road sector management. Under the 2005 TA \nfor Capacity Building for Road Sector Institutions6 and 2006 Road Rehabilitation and Capacity \nBuilding Cluster,7 international and domestic consultants will be assigned to MPW and lead the \ndevelopment of sustainable and self-sufficient capacity building mechanisms by twinning key \nplayers including the local construction industry and Kabul Polytechnic University. The TA will \nassist  the  twinned  group  by  strengthening  the  curricula  of  Kabul  Polytechnic  University, \nparticularly for project management and procurement, road database management, and quality \ncontrol of road works, to have a stable supply of qualified engineers. The TA will also involve \nfaculty members of Kabul Polytechnic University to develop and provide retraining courses for \nMPW staff and engineers in the local construction industry, and design exchange programs \nbetween MPW and the local construction industry.  \n                                                 \n5  ADB.  2002.

Other  development  partners  complement  ADB\u2019s  efforts  by  focusing  their  capacity \nbuilding efforts in other areas. The capacity building TA being prepared by the World Bank will \nassist MPW\u2019s restructuring by assigning four international consultants to the capacity building \nunit in MPW for 3 years to support MPW\u2019s restructuring initiatives. In particular, the consultants \nwill assist MPW in applying and obtaining the priority reform and restructuring status in line with \nthe  Government\u2019s  priority  reform  and  restructuring8 scheme.  USAID  provided  an  extensive \ntraining program for MPW staff through the United Nations Office of Project Service covering \nquality assurance and quality control; road operation and maintenance; planning, administration, \nand financing of road construction; contract management; and computer and English skills. The \nprogram will continue to 2007. Japan International Cooperation Agency focuses on capacity \nbuilding of MPW middle management and senior engineers in the area of road maintenance. \n \n6.  Subregional Cooperation for Transport Corridor Development \n \n24.  Afghanistan\u2019s efforts to rehabilitate and reconstruct its shattered road network have \ndrawn much attention from its neighboring countries. An improved road network in Afghanistan \nwill  result  in  an  improved  transport  network  in  the  subregion.  Landlocked  Central  Asian \nrepublics are showing great interest in establishing transport corridors through Afghanistan to \nwarm-water ports on the Arabian Sea and Gulf. Iran and Pakistan are rapidly developing their \nports and improving roads connecting to the ports in expectation of increased import/export and \ntransit shipment  of  goods  through  their  ports.  In  2005, Afghanistan  joined  the  South  Asia \nAssociation for Regional Cooperation and decided to participate in the Central Asia Regional \nEconomic Cooperation program led by ADB. Afghanistan\u2019s role as a land bridge to link two \nsubregions,  South  Asia  and  Central  Asia,  becomes  more  critical  with  Afghanistan\u2019s  active \nparticipation in regional cooperation initiatives. \n \n25.  ADB  has  been  actively  involved  in  this  subregional  initiative  to  develop  effective \ntransport corridors. Under the TA cluster (footnote 5), ADB provided assistance to develop a \nframework and legislation to facilitate cross-border trade. This evolved into the initiative to \nestablish the Central and South Asia Transport and Trade Forum9 in 2003 as an instrument for \nsubregional  cooperation  supported  by  ADB  and  other  development  partners.  It  seeks  to \nencourage opportunities for increasing investment, income, and employment in Central and \nSouth Asia through greater transport connectivity and expanded subregional and interregional \ntrade. Under the TA for Cross-Border Trade and Transport Facilitation approved in 2004,10 ADB \nassists Afghanistan in developing an instrument to facilitate the smooth transportation of goods \nacross the corridors linking Afghanistan with neighboring countries.  \n \n7.  Security Situation \n \n26.  Poor security remains a key constraint to Afghanistan\u2019s reconstruction and development. \nWithout improved security, the country will fail to achieve key national goals for private sector-\nled economic growth, national reconciliation, and social development. Despite the continued \npresence of the International Security Assistance Force and United States-led coalition troops, \n                                                 \n8  Priority reform and restructuring is an institutional reform scheme based on the Presidential Decree on Priority \nReform and Restructuring within Ministries and Government Agencies issued on 12 July 2003. The intent of the \nscheme is to promote the reform and restructuring of ministries and Government agencies. Once ministries and \nGovernment agencies obtain policy reform and restructuring status, employees who fill new posts under the \nrestructured organization are compensated with additional salary in the form of an interim additional allowance.  \n9  The  Central  and  South  Asia  Transport  and  Trade  Forum  comprises  Afghanistan,  Pakistan,  Tajikistan, \nTurkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, with Iran as an observer.  \n10  ADB. 2004. Afghanistan: Cross-Border Trade and Transport Facilitation. Manila. \n ", "  7\nas well as ongoing efforts by the international community to train and strengthen the Afghan \nnational army, incidents involving antigovernment elements have increased over the past year. \nIn addition, the problem of poor security has spread to an increased number of provinces.  \n \n27.  Despite a disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration program aimed at reducing the \nnumber and size of illegal armed groups, in some parts of the country regional warlords and \nmid-level commanders have retained significant military strength as well as political influence. \nAs such, full political normalization has not yet been achieved.  \n \n28.  Continued insecurity may adversely affect project implementation through disruptions or \ndelays  in  construction  work,  including  the  timely  provision  of  raw  materials.  Poor  security \nconditions also may constrain effective supervision of construction work by consultants and \nADB staff. However, the project area is relatively unpopulated and generally has not been \naffected by problems of insecurity.  \n \n29.  As  with  ADB\u2019s  earlier  road  projects,  efforts  will  be  made  to  win  the  support  of \ncommunities near the construction site through consultations with local government officials and \nvillage leaders. ADB also has an ongoing security TA11 that is helping provide a safe work \nenvironment for on-site personnel assigned by contractors and consulting firms.  \n \n8.  Opium-Related Problems \n \n30.  Poppy cultivation and downstream narcotics production and trade constitute a major \nthreat to Afghanistan\u2019s security and stability as the trade in opium, including opium debt, ties the \npoor rural population to regional warlords and international crime syndicates. Afghanistan\u2019s drug \neconomy continues to represent nearly half of the country\u2019s total licit economy. As such, control \nand  eradication  of  opium  poppy  production  and  narcotics  trafficking  represents  a  huge \nchallenge to Afghanistan\u2019s reconstruction and development.  \n \n31.  Afghanistan is the world\u2019s largest producer of illicit opium, comprising 87% of world \nproduction, or some 4,200 metric tons. Narcotics also constitute the largest sector of the Afghan \neconomy; valued at $2.8 billion, the opium economy equaled some 60% of the country\u2019s 2003 \ngross domestic product ($4.6 billion, if only licit activity is measured). Opium is a major source of \ncash income for farmers because of the high profitability of opium poppy compared with other \nagricultural crops, as well as the lack of livelihood alternatives in rural areas. In 2005, more than \n2  million  Afghans,  or  nearly  10%  of  the  country\u2019s  total  population  were  estimated  to  be \nsomehow engaged in the production of opium.  \n \n32.  The  Government\u2019s  overall  antinarcotics  strategy  is  to  eliminate  the  production, \nconsumption, and trafficking of illicit drugs into, within, and from Afghanistan, focusing on the \nprovision of alternative livelihoods for Afghan poppy farmers, extension of drug law enforcement \nthroughout Afghanistan, implementation of drug control legislation, establishment of effective \ninstitutions,  and  introduction  of  prevention  and  treatment  programs  for  addicts.  The \ndevelopment partners are contributing to the Government\u2019s antinarcotics efforts with a focus on \nalternative livelihoods, including rural credit to address problems of opium debt, as well as \nsupport  for  improved  law  enforcement  and  interdiction  and  legal  and  judicial  reform.  The \ndevelopment partners are also attempting to mainstream the antinarcotics agenda into other \ndevelopment activities.  \n                                                 \n11  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the Security of ADB-Financed Projects \nin Afghanistan. Manila. \n ", "8   \n33.  As a key objective of counternarcotics activities is to build stability and the rule of law in \nAfghanistan, the success of such efforts will not only reduce the amount of opium poppy grown \nby Afghan farmers, but curtail the flow of income and accumulation of wealth by traffickers and \ncorrupt Government officials, while at the same time promote growth of the country\u2019s legal \neconomy through alternative livelihoods, employment creation, market diversification, etc. ADB \nsupports the antinarcotics agenda by focusing on helping farm households develop sustainable \nalternatives  to  opium  poppy  cultivation.  ADB  activities  in  this  regard  include  rehabilitating \nirrigation systems and improving water resources management, as well as helping to create an \nenabling environment for the commercialization and diversification of agricultural production. \nADB  recently  completed  a  review  of  its  activities  in  Afghanistan,  including  its  support  to \ntransport, through an antinarcotics perspective. The results of this review will be incorporated in \nADB\u2019s new country strategy and program, and future programming.  \n \n34.  Although irregular border crossings currently are preferred for illegal trafficking, as formal \nborder  crossings  improve  and  volumes  of  cargo  and  passengers  increase,  the  volume  of \nnarcotics trafficked by way of formal border crossings and through the main roads is likely to \nincrease. While the project area is not a main opium-producing region, the link provided by the \nnorth\u2013south corridor may facilitate trafficking in narcotics as well as humans. Thus training of \npolice and customs officers is needed as well as improved interdiction methods, as highlighted \nby an ADB-commissioned report on cross-border law enforcement.12 \n \n9.  HIV/AIDS13 Prevention Strategy \n \n35.  HIV/AIDS prevalence, as reported by the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH), is 51 HIV \ncases and 4 AIDS deaths (as of 2006), although many more cases in the country\u2019s 22 million \npopulation  could  go  undetected  and  unreported.  The  National  HIV/AIDS/STI  (sexually \ntransmitted infection) Control Program, adopted in July 2003, is currently being revised and the \nfirst  draft  of  the  National  Strategic  Plan  of  HIV/AIDS/STI  Control  (2006\u20132010)  has  been \nprepared in consultation with different development partners working in the sector. The strategic \nplan prepared by MOPH outlines the priority areas of intervention: (i) surveillance and research; \n(ii) prevention of HIV/AIDS through an information, education, and communication program for \nhigh-risk groups and the general population; (iii) prevention and management of STIs; (iv) blood \nsafety;  and  (v)  voluntary  counselling  and  testing,  care,  treatment,  and  support.  MOPH  is \nplanning to conduct surveillance surveys and social mapping to identify the behavioral patterns \nof high-risk groups. MOPH together with the Ministry of Religious Affairs and support from \ndevelopment partners (United Nations Children\u2019s Fund and United Nations Population Fund), \norganized the Religious Leaders National Consultative Conference on HIV/AIDS in July 2004, in \nwhich the role of the religious leaders on raising awareness of HIV/AIDS and STIs was identified \nand an action plan prepared. Understanding the sociocultural and economic factors and power \nrelations  between  men  and  women,  among  men,  and  among  women  is  essential  for \nunderstanding the behavioral underpinnings of the spread of HIV/AIDS.  \n \n36.  The Government, with support from United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, will develop an \nevidence-based communication strategy on HIV/AIDS prevention and control by March 2007, \nbased  on  formative  research,  development  of  a  strategic  framework,  appropriate \ncommunications materials, pretesting, finalization of materials based on the pretesting, and \n                                                 \n12  ADB. 2004.

Lessons Learned \n \n37.  A number of lessons can be drawn from past ADB emergency assistance projects, best \npractices, as well as ADB\u2019s initial lending and nonlending operations in Afghanistan since 2002: \n(i) continued emphasis has to be given to capacity building to improve planning, project design \nand implementation, administration, and financial management; (ii) aid coordination through \ngovernment-aid consultative groups or other mechanisms is important to avoid duplication or \ndelays; (iii) aid groups must work closely with a country\u2019s finance ministry and central bank to \ndevelop a viable and working payment system, without which maintaining a flow of funds is \ndifficult; (iv) capacity building in executing agencies is vital, and consulting services for project \ndesign and implementation should explicitly provide for the training of executing agency staff in \nthe  operation  and  maintenance  of  rehabilitated  facilities;  (v)  the  number  of  procurement \npackages should be minimized, given the limited implementation capacity for project execution; \n(vi) ADB\u2019s procurement guidelines should be applied flexibly to allow reduced procurement \nperiods for the urgent delivery of project components; and (vii) law and order situations resulting \nfrom conflict hamper the smooth implementation of projects, and detailed security plans must be \nin place to address possible security hazards in project locations. From experience with project \nimplementation in Afghanistan, lessons include (i) procurement actions need to be taken far in \nadvance to expedite implementation, and (ii) recruitment of consultants should be expedited. \nThese lessons of experience are fully incorporated in the project design, and in particular, \nprocurement actions will proceed in parallel with project processing to avoid any start-up delay \nof project implementation. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n38.  The Project will help the Government promote economic and social development and \nreduce poverty by rehabilitating the national highway network, which will connect remote areas \nin central Afghanistan to the ring road. The project roads pass through Balkh, Bamian, and \nSamangan provinces, which are located at the center of the country and characterized by \nmountainous terrain with altitudes up to 3,500 meters (m). The population of these provinces is \nabout 1.7 million, comprising 8.4% of the total Afghanistan population. Rural farmers make up \nabout  90%  of  the  population;  the  urban  population  comprising  the  remaining  10%  is \nconcentrated in large cities such as Bamian and Mazar-e-Sharif. In Bamian and Dara-i-Suf, \nproduction of coal reserves and iron ore deposits will lead to growth of the mining industry in the \nregion, decreasing dependence on agriculture.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n1.  Rehabilitation of the North\u2013South National Highways \n \n39.  The Project will finance rehabilitation of the Mazar-e-Sharif\u2013Dara-i-Suf road (140.3 km) \nand  the  Bamian\u2013Yakawlang  road  (98.9  km),  which  comprise  the  north\u2013south  corridor \nconnecting the ring road through central Afghanistan. The Project will improve the project road \nto a two-lane asphalt-paved standard that will allow smooth passage of heavy vehicles. The \ntypical cross section suggested for flat and rolling terrains is 3.50 m wide, with two granular \nshoulders of 1.5 m and two verges of 0.5 m, with a total width of 11.0 m. In mountainous terrain, \n ", "10   \nto reduce the construction cost because of slower traffic speeds, the typical cross section \nsuggested is reduced to 9.0 m, by reducing the width of the carriage way to 3.0 m and width of \nthe shoulder to 1.0 m. In exceptional cases where the alignment passes through unavoidable \nconstrained areas such as religious structures, confined river sides, reducing the carriage and \nshoulder width to 6.0 m and 0.50 m is recommended. The current condition of the project road \nand proposed design standards are in Appendix 5. \n \n40.  Road safety measures will be incorporated in the construction design, which will include \nsafety barriers to separate pedestrians from vehicles, marker posts for vehicles to recognize the \nroad at night, and signage to indicate road blind spots, potential accident areas, or proximity to \npublic community buildings such as schools. In areas where alignments provide little space \nbetween housing structures and the road, barriers and underground or bridge walkways will be \nconsidered.  \n \n2.  Provision of Cross-Border Facilities \n \n41.  The Project will finance installation of cross-border customs facilities including gamma-\nray scanner, computers with internet connection, solar panel, and other office equipment in the \nborder point of Spin Boldak where ADB\u2019s previous road project helped with rehabilitation and \nprovision of border access roads.  \n \n3.  HIV/AIDS Prevention and Anti-Human Trafficking Awareness Campaign \n \n42.  The  Project  recognizes  the  importance  of  preventing  HIV/AIDS  as  a  crosscutting \ndevelopment issue, which is linked to and exacerbated by the human trafficking issue. The \nprogram to combat trafficking will help mitigate the spread of HIV/AIDS, and hence is included in \nthe HIV/AIDS prevention and human trafficking awareness campaign. The Project will support \nimplementation of an evidence-based communication strategy on HIV/AIDS prevention and \ncontrol in Afghanistan that will be developed by MOPH with the assistance of the United Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund. The activities under this component include (i) support to MOPH to develop \nMPW  capacity  to  work  with  the  National  HIV/AIDS/STI  Control  Program  in  developing  a \nconcerted approach to HIV/AIDS prevention and transmission in transportation and related road \nconstruction;  (ii)  capacity  development  of  local  NGOs  to  increase  outreach  and  impact  of \nHIV/AIDS  prevention,  trafficking,  and  regulation  of  migration  in  the  project  area;  and  (iii) \nawareness and prevention initiatives to target high-risk groups including injecting drug users \nand commercial sex workers, young people and adolescents, contractors, construction workers, \nand communities along the corridor of influence. Briefing sessions for imams and mullahs will be \nprovided  in  the  districts,  and  for  opinion  leaders  and  community  leaders  in  villages  and \ncommunities. Religious leaders\u2019 role in increasing community awareness of HIV prevention will \nbe  enhanced.  Gender-relevant  aspects  of  HIV/AIDS  prevention,  such  as  counseling  for \nadolescent  girls  and  women,  and  the  prevention  of  parent-to-child  transmission,  will  be \nsupported. Details of cost and implementation arrangements are in Appendix 4. \n \n4.  Project Management and Monitoring \n \n43.  Two consultant teams and two individual consultants will be hired to help MPW, MOPH, \nand the Ministry of Finance (MOF) implement the Project. The consultant teams will closely \ncoordinate  with  the  Project  Management  Unit  (PMU)  established  under  MPW  and  be \nresponsible for (i) overseeing overall project management; (ii) supervising construction and \ninstallation of equipment, including reviewing detailed designs prepared by contractors; (iii) \nsupervising implementation of the HIV/AIDS component; (iv) certifying completed works by \n ", " 11\ncontractors; (v) providing on-the-job training for MPW staff assigned to the consultant team, and \nimplementing and supervising the training component of the Project; and (vi) undertaking project \nperformance monitoring and evaluation. The individual consultant will assist MPW and the \nAfghan Reconstruction and Development Services in evaluating the technical and financial \nproposals for supervision consultants, evaluating the proposals for civil works contracts, and \npreparing final bid evaluation reports. The consultant will also help the Customs Department in \nMOF to supervise procurement and installation of cross-border facilities. The outline terms of \nreference  for  supervision  consulting  services  and  the  individual  consultant  are  provided  in \nsupplementary appendixes A and B. \n \n5.  Incremental Project Management Support \n \n44.  The Project will finance the engagement of external auditors to audit project accounts \nand the payment of additional salary to MPW staff assigned to the PMU and the consultant \nteam. The additional salary to MPW staff will not be higher than that allowed for MPW staff with \npriority reform and restructuring status (footnote 8). MOF will review the request for additional \nsalary  to  MPW  staff  included  in  the  development  budget  request  and  allocate  the  budget \nthrough the regular fiscal budgeting processes.  \n \nC.  ADF IX Grant Component \n \n45.  Under the ADF IX resolution,14 donors agreed that Asian Development Fund (ADF) \ngrants could be used to assist poor countries make the transition from postconflict to peace and \nstability. Afghanistan was identified as one of the poorest postconflict countries and eligible for \nADF  grants. 15  Prolonged  conflict  has  endangered  the  poor,  destroyed  their  economic \nopportunities, damaged infrastructure, and disrupted delivery of basic services to the neediest. \nThe  Bamian\u2013Yakwalang  section  of  the  Project,  due  to  its  remoteness  and  harsh  weather \nconditions, is still in need of continued humanitarian aid and assistance in basic social services. \nImprovement to the road, along with other grant-financed components of resettlement, public \ncampaign on HIV/AIDS and human trafficking, and project management support, will facilitate \naccess to such social services and provide better access to markets for agricultural produce and \nlower transportation costs thereby contributing to development of some of the poorest areas in \nthe region.  \n \n46.  Afghanistan has made significant progress since the ouster of the Taliban regime. The \nGovernment has implemented a wide range of structural reforms and adhered to almost all \nquantitative indicators and structural benchmarks under the Staff-Monitored Program, led by the \nInternational Monetary  Fund. Notwithstanding these achievements and sustained economic \ngrowth over the last 2 years, the economic and fiscal situation continues to be extremely fragile. \nSecurity, economic, social, and administrative challenges are formidable. Afghanistan continues \nto need external development finance that does not fiscally burden the nascent administration. \nTo achieve growth targets over the medium term, the Government must aim for broad-based \nand sustainable development, and identify new drivers of growth. Investment in the road sector \nis a prerequisite for sustained economic growth, and the grant will greatly help accelerate this \ntransition.  \n \n                                                 \n14 Eighth Replenishment of the Asian Development Fund and Third Regularized Replenishment of the Technical \nAssistance Special Fund (ADF IX Resolution). \n15  ADB. 2004.

The grant financing for the Project is referenced in the Country Strategy and Program \nUpdate 2006\u20132008 (footnote 3). The grant effectiveness will be assessed within the broader \ncontext  of  project  performance.  The  Project\u2019s  design  and  monitoring  framework  has  clear \nindicators to measure the inputs, activities, and outputs. \n \nD.  Special Features \n \n48.  A recent International Monetary Fund report expressed serious concern about the fiscal \nsustainability  of  the  Government  payroll  and  security  expenditures,  and  highlighted  the \nimportance of continued assistance from external funding agencies. Moreover, in view of the \nexceptionally difficult postconflict circumstances that continue to prevail in Afghanistan, the \nGovernment has requested more  concessional funding for its transition and reconstruction \nphase. The ADF lending terms from ADB\u2019s Board of Directors, while generous, are not sufficient \nfor sustainable development of Afghanistan. This loan is proposed to be made, similar to \nseveral previous loans since 2002,16 on the following concessional terms: (i) grandfathering pre-\n1999 ADF lending terms so that the loan has a 40-year maturity including a 10-year grace \nperiod, with a 1% interest charge throughout this period, and (ii) capitalizing interest during the \ngrace period. \n \nE.  Project Investment Plan \n \n49.  The project investment cost is estimated at $140.9 million, including taxes and duties of \n$1.7 million as shown in the Table 1.

Manila). \n ", " 13\nF.  Financing Plan \n \n50.  To finance the total project cost of $140.9 million, the Government has requested a loan \nof $78.2 million and a grant of $40.0 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The loan will \nhave a term of 40 years, including a grace period of 10 years, with an annual interest rate of \n1%. The total amount of the interest charge during the grace period will be capitalized and \ncharged to the loan account. The grant will finance (i) resettlement costs, (ii) civil works for the \nBamian\u2013Yakawlang road, (iii) HIV/AIDS and anti-human trafficking awareness campaign, and \n(iv) incremental project management support. The loan will finance (i) civil works for the Mazar-\ne-Sharif\u2013Dara-i-Suf  road,  (ii)  cross-border  facilities,  and  (iii)  project  management  and \nmonitoring.  \n \n51.  The ADB loan and grant totaling $118.2 million will finance 84% of the project cost, \nexcluding taxes and duties of $1.7 million and land acquisition of $1.0 million, which will be \nincurred by the Government. The Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction will provide an additional \ngrant of $20 million to finance a part of civil works for the Bamian\u2013Yakawlang road (the proposal \nis in Appendix 7). \n \n52.  The waiver of cost-sharing limit approved for loans and TA operations for Afghanistan is \napplied  to  the  Project.17 The  Government  will  make  the  grant  available  to  the  Project\u2019s \nExecuting Agency, MPW, and MOPH, through appropriate budgetary allocation. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nSource  Total % \nADB-Loan  78,200 56 \nADB-Grant  40,000 28 \nGovernment 2,700 2 \nJFPR  20,000 14 \nTotal 140,900 100 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, JFPR = Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction. \nSource:ADBestimates.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n53.  MPW will be the Executing Agency responsible for project implementation, except for \nthe components relating to cross-border facilities and HIV/AIDS prevention and anti-human \ntrafficking awareness campaign. The Project will be implemented by the existing PMU, which is \nhandling ongoing ADB road projects. (Appendix 4). The PMU will (i) monitor the progress of \nday-to-day  project  implementation,  (ii)  prepare  withdrawal  applications,  (iii)  prepare  project \nprogress reports, and (iv) maintain project accounts and complete loan financial records for \nauditing. The deputy minister of MPW will have overall responsibility for project management as \nproject director of the PMU. The current PMU includes three engineers, one accountant, and an \noffice administrator who will continue to support the Project and be financed under the Project \nonce ongoing projects are complete. MPW will assign a team of two engineers, one land-\n                                                 \n17 This is in accordance with the Board resolution on the Extension of the Waiver for the Cost-Sharing Limits for \nLoans and TA Operations for Afghanistan (28 January 2005). \n ", "14   \nrevenue  officer,  and  one  office  administrator  to  the  site  office  of  the  project  management \nconsultants to liaise with the project management consultants, contractors, local government, \nand residents of the project area. MPW field staff will handle day-to-day project implementation. \nThe PMU will also be assisted by consultants engaged under the TA cluster:18 the project \nmanagement and TA coordination specialist will continue to assist the PMU with overall project \nmanagement, and the financial management and auditing specialist will assist the PMU with \nfinancial management. The structure of project management is in Appendix 9. \n \n54.  MOPH  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  anti-human \ntrafficking awareness campaign component. A steering committee will be established under \nMOPH  comprising  representatives  from  ADB,  MOPH,  MPW,  and  UNICEF.  The  steering \ncommittee will set the direction for implementation of the evidence-based strategy, supervise \nNGOs  that  will  be  recruited  to  implement  the  public  campaign  in  the  field,  and  monitor \ncomponent progress. MOPH will designate an official who will be responsible for coordinating \nand monitoring the day-to-day execution of the program through the NGOs. \n \n55.  MOF will be the Executing Agency for the component on cross-border facilities; the \ndirector  general  of  the  Customs  Department  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  project \nimplementation. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n56.  The Project will be implemented over 42 months starting from the date of loan and grant \neffectiveness. By employing the design-build contract modality, the lead time required for project \npreparation has been reduced. The consulting services contracts are expected to be awarded \nand consultant teams mobilized by the end of 2006. Civil works contract will be awarded by the \nend of the second quarter of 2007. Civil works will be completed in the second quarter of 2010 \nfor  the  Mazar-e-Sharif\u2013Dara-i-Suf  road  and  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2010  for  the  Bamian\u2013\nYakawlang road. Implementation schedules are in Appendix 9.  \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n57.  Procurement of goods, services, and civil works to be financed under the ADB loan will \nbe carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April 2006). Civil works \ncontracts  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding.  A  single-stage,  two-\nenvelope procedure (without prequalification) will be used. Equipment for cross-border facilities \nwill be procured by limited international bidding. All international procurement will be undertaken \nby the Government procurement unit operating under Afghan Reconstruction and Development \nServices.  The  procurement  plan  is  in  Appendix  10.  Before  the  commencement  of  any \nprocurement activity under national competitive bidding, ADB and the Government will review \nthe  Government\u2019s  public  procurement  law  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines. Any necessary modifications or clarifications will be reflected in the procurement \nplan. Similarly, the Government\u2019s standard procedures for selecting and engaging individual \nconsultants will also be reviewed, and modifications, if any, will be reflected in the procurement \nplan. \n \n58.

Explicit  procurement \nrestrictions  may  preclude  civil  works  contractors  under  the  Project  from  seeking  the  best \nbusiness  terms,  and  ultimately  erode  economic  efficiency.  To  maximize  the  Project\u2019s \ndevelopment  impact  and  economic  efficiency,  Management  proposes  that  civil  works \ncontractors under the Project be allowed to procure the bitumen required for road pavement \nfrom any country, including from countries that are not ADB members.19 This special treatment \nwas applied to three previous transport projects in Afghanistan, i.e., the Regional Airports \nRehabilitation Project, Andkhuouy\u2013Qaisar Road Project, both approved in 2004, and Qaisar\u2013\nBala Murghab Road Project approved in 2005. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n59.  A total of 181 person-months of international consulting and 740 person-months of \nnational consultants will be engaged to supervise construction contracts and implementation of \nthe HIV/AIDS component. A total of 6 person-months of international individual consultants will \nbe engaged for procurement management. All consultants financed from the ADB loan will be \nselected and engaged in accordance with Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian \nDevelopment Bank and Its Borrowers. ADB has approved advanced recruitment of consultants \non the understanding that such action will not necessarily commit ADB to financing the Project. \nAll consultants financed from the ADB loan will be selected and engaged in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants following the quality- and cost-based selection and \nthe full proposal method. \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n60.  ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy20 was explained to and discussed with the Government and \nMPW. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt, \nfraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy are included in the loan and grant regulations \nand the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Project will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of MPW, MOF, and MOPH, and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n61.  The Government will ensure (i) submission of a general procurement notice to ADB for \npublication; and (ii) upon receiving ADB\u2019s no objection to the recommendation of the contract \naward, it will publish in the newspaper dailies circulated nationally, both in English and the local \nlanguage, the results identifying the bid and lot numbers, and also (a) name of each bidder; (b) \nbid prices as read out at bid opening; (c) name and evaluated prices of each bid evaluated; (d) \nnames of bidders whose bids were rejected and the reasons for their rejection; and (e) name of \nthe winning bidder, and the price it offered, as well as the duration and summary scope of the \ncontract awarded.  \n \n62.  The Government will allow and assist ADB's representatives to carry out random spot \nchecks on the work in progress and utilization of funds for the Project. The Government is \n                                                 \n19  This is pursuant to Article 14(ix) of the ADB Charter, which provides that the Board may, by a vote of the directors \nrepresenting not less than two thirds of the total voting power of the members, agree to permit in special \ncircumstances procurement from non-ADB member countries \n20  ADB. 1998.

In  the  interim,  ADB  is  separately  assisting  the \nGovernment to develop a comprehensive transparency and anticorruption strategy.21 \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n63.  Loan and grant funds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (January 2001), as amended from time to time. An imprest account, primarily for \nincremental expenditures related to project management support for MPW, will be established \nfor a loan account and grant account under MOF with a designated treasurer in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The designated treasurer will open a deposit account at \nthe Da Afghanistan Bank to which ADB\u2019s loan and grant proceeds will be transferred and \nagainst which the treasurer\u2019s checks will be issued. The initial amount to be deposited into the \nimprest account will be 6 months of estimated expenditures or 10% of the loan and grant \namount, whichever is lower. Statement of expenditure procedures will be used for reimbursing \neligible expenditures and liquidating the imprest account for any individual payment transaction \nup to $50,000 equivalent.  \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n64.  MPW, the Customs Department of MOF, and MOPH will maintain separate accounts \nand records for the Project in accordance with sound accounting principles, adequate to identify \nthe goods and services financed from the loan proceeds, financing resources, expenditures \nincurred for the Project, and the use of local funds. These project accounts and related financial \nstatements  will  be  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing  standards  by \nindependent auditors acceptable to ADB. MPW, MOF, and MOPH will submit to ADB the \naudited project account for 2007 no later than 8 months after the end of the fiscal year, the \naudited project account for 2008 no later than 7 months after the end of the fiscal year, and the \naudited project account for 2009 and thereafter no later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal \nyear. The annual audits will include an audit of the imprest account, statement of expenditure \nrecords, and a separate opinion on the audit.  \n \n65.  MPW  will  submit  quarterly  progress  reports  for  performance  monitoring,  issues \nresolution, and periodic action plans. The quarterly reports will serve as feedback to update and \nimprove procedures and project implementation. Within 3 months of physical completion of the \nProject, MPW will submit a project completion report on the overall impact of the Project. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n66.  MPW will be responsible for overall project monitoring. The PMU will establish a system \nfor preparing quarterly reports, for performance monitoring and issues resolution, plus periodic \naction plans. Aided by the PMU, MPW will undertake quantitative and qualitative performance \nmonitoring of each project component to evaluate the delivery of the planned facilities and the \nproject benefits accrued. With the help of the project management consultants, no later than 3 \nmonths following loan effectiveness, MPW will develop a comprehensive system for monitoring \nthe Project\u2019s performance. ADB will review and approve this system. ADB and the Government \nwill agree on the performance parameters to be monitored during project implementation and for \n3 months after project completion. \n                                                 \n21  ADB. 2003.

ADB staff will review project implementation through regular or special review missions. \nBased on the project schedule, a midterm review will be carried out about 18 months after \nproject commencement, around July 2008. The Government will submit to ADB a detailed \nprogress report on the Project\u2019s implementation and achievements prior to the midterm review. \nTerms  of  reference  for  the  midterm  review  will  be  included  in  the  project  administration \nmemorandum to be prepared by ADB\u2019s inception mission for the Project.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Social and Poverty Impacts \n \n68.  In Afghanistan, nearly 53% of the population are classified as poor22 and live on less \nthan $1 a day. The project road passes through the provinces of Balkh, Samangan, and Bamian \nand will benefit a total population of 1,735,800.23 Before the war, these provinces were known \nfor their agriculture, livestock, handicrafts, and carpet industry. The existing road condition is the \nbiggest constraint as people are unable to transport their products to market and currently crops \nare grown on a small scale only for household consumption. Poverty in these provinces is \nestimated to be 60% with the majority of the population living in mud houses (80%\u201395%) \nwithout electricity, clean water, proper sanitation facilities, and garbage disposal system. As per \nthe data available, only 10%\u201311% of the households in these three provinces had access to \nclean water; only 10% in Balkh province had a garbage disposal system. The social assessment \nindicates that the population living along the proposed alignment is generally poor with about \n48% having an annual income of less than $600 with an average household size of 9. The \nsurvey also indicates that 75% were engaged in subsistence agriculture and allied activities for \ntheir livelihood, while the rest had small businesses in the town areas.  \n \n69.  The Project will lead to both direct and indirect poverty reduction impacts. The direct \npoverty  impact  will  be  on  income  generation  and  demand  for  unskilled  labor  and  wages \naccruing during construction of the project road. Other benefits will be lower travel time and \ntravel costs, and higher agricultural product profit margins. Improved roads will lead to a shift \nfrom subsistence agriculture to market-based production enabling farmers to grow perishable \ncommercial products like vegetables and fruits and to more quickly transport them to markets. \nImproved road conditions will lead to growth of affordable transport facilities and thus the poor, \nespecially  women  and  children  will  have  more  reliable,  affordable,  and  timely  access  to \neducational and medical facilities. Lower transportation costs will also increase mobility among \nthe poor to find employment opportunities in other areas. Increased access to local and national \nmarkets will lead to growth of local trade and production activities, and reduced prices of \nagricultural commodities and other products. Thus increased economic activity and easy access \nto social services are expected to significantly increase household incomes and quality of life \nthereby reducing overall poverty incidence. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy \nis in Appendix 11. \n \n                                                 \n22  ADB. 2003.

Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n70.  Overall, the land acquisition and resettlement impact for the Project will be significant. \nThe total land requirement for the Project is estimated to be 212.6 hectares (ha), comprising \n162  ha  of  barren  unproductive  government-owned  land  and  50.6  ha  of  privately  owned \nagricultural land. Although most of the improvement works will be carried out within the existing \nright-of-way, a narrow strip of agricultural land to be acquired will affect about 1,515 households \nthat will lose a portion of their total agricultural landholding and 4,000 wood trees. Nearly 59 \nhouseholds will lose a portion of their residential structure; of these only 8 households will \nrequire relocation. About 141 households operating roadside shops/small businesses will be \naffected with the majority losing their building extensions, except for 23 households who will \nrequire  relocation.  No  common  property  resources  or  religious  structures  will  be  affected. \nOverall the Project will affect 2,583 households and 21,517 people. The affected households will \nreceive cash for land and assets at replacement prices. Compensation will be provided for \ntemporary loss of income, relocation assistance, and additional assistance to vulnerable groups. \nNo  indigenous  people  will  be  affected  by  the  Project.  A  summary  resettlement  plan  is  in \nAppendix 12. The summary resettlement plan was translated into Dari and disclosed to those \naffected.  The  resettlement  plan  will  also  be  publicly  available  at  MPW,  ADB  Afghanistan \nResident Mission, and the ADB website. \n \nC.  Economic Analysis \n \n71.  The  economic  analysis  was  conducted  separately  for  the  two  district  roads  in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. The highway design \nand maintenance model (HDM-IV) was used to calculate vehicle operating costs and time costs \nwith modification for conditions in Afghanistan. The major inputs include vehicle characteristics \nand related costs, and construction and maintenance costs. The major benefits are derived from \nsavings of vehicle operating costs and travel time due to rehabilitation of the project road, which \nwill provide a stimulus for economic growth in the project area.  \n \n72.  The economic evaluation resulted in an economic internal rate of return of 29.8% for the \nMazar-e-Sharif\u2013Dara-i-Suf  road  and  20.7%  for  the  Bamian\u2013Yakawlang  road.  The  Project\u2019s \neconomic costs include the resource costs for traded and nontraded costs, materials, and labor. \nAll cost elements are valued at border prices, using a world price numeraire, with all taxes and \nduties excluded. A standard conversion factor of 0.95 was applied to the financial costs of \nnontraded inputs to calculate economic prices.  \n \n73.  The sensitivity of the economic internal rate of return for the project roads was analyzed \nwith respect to changes in the benefit and cost streams such as (i) construction costs increase \nby 20%, (ii) benefits decrease by 20%, (iii) no time savings considered, (iv) no diverted and \ngenerated traffic, and (v) the combination of (i) and (ii). The results show that the quantified \neconomic benefits are robust to various sensitivity tests for the overall project road, even in the \nworst case of no diverted and generated traffic. Details of economic analysis are in Appendix \n13. \n \nD.  Environmental Impacts \n \n74.  Based on the type of project activities and environmental conditions of the project areas, \nthe Project is categorized as \u201cB\u201d in accordance with the ADB Guidelines on Environmental \nAssessment. Therefore the initial environmental examination (IEE) study for rehabilitation and \n ", " 19\nreconstruction of two project roads was undertaken as part of the feasibility study. The IEE \nreport will be submitted to MPW for approval. \n \n75.  The IEE found that the environmental impacts associated with the Project would mostly \noccur during construction. The impacts are temporary and most of the mitigation measures will \nbe incorporated into the contract document. However, careful monitoring needs to be conducted \nfor  blasting  related  activities,  disposal  of  spoiled  (earth  waste)  materials,  and  potential \nlandslides due to location of the Project mostly in mountainous and hilly areas. The contractor \nwill be required to strictly implement the proposed mitigation measures. The IEE recommends \nthat  no  environmental  assessment  study  be  conducted  as  the  environmental  impacts  are \ntemporary and insignificant. The summary of the IEE and environment monitoring plan matrix is \nattached in Supplementary Appendix C.  \n \n76.  The proposed mitigation measures are manageable and most can be incorporated in \nthe  design,  construction,  and  operation  of  the  Project.  The  mitigation  measures  during \nconstruction will be incorporated in the contractor job assignments, therefore the IEE report will \nalso be made available to the contractor. An environmental engineer, who will be hired as part \nof the consultant team supervising civil works for MPW, will assist in preparing contractual \ndocuments so that the bidding documents and other contractual obligations of the contractor \nclearly identify environmental responsibilities and describe penalties for noncompliance. MPW \nthrough its site offices will be responsible for implementing the overall environmental monitoring \nand management plan. Any change on alignment needs to be reported to ADB, and therefore \nthe necessary environmental assessment study would be conducted. In addition, MPW, in close \nconsultation with ADB, will provide remedial measures for unforeseen environmental impacts \nthat were not covered in the IEE report.  \n \nE.  Risks \n \n77.  Implementation of the Project entails a number of risks: \n \n(i)  The overall political and security situation remains volatile. ADB will need to closely \nmonitor the situation and coordinate with local and central authorities and the United \nNations to ensure adequate protection.24 ADB\u2019s TA for the Security of ADB-Financed \nProjects  in  Afghanistan  will  provide  advice  on  how  to  ensure  a  safe  work \nenvironment for on-site personnel assigned by the contractors, subcontractors, and \nconsulting firms. Under the prevailing conditions, however, this security risk cannot \nbe mitigated completely, and delays in project implementation, if security hazards \noccur in project locations, will be inevitable. \n \n(ii)  Regional warlords and militia leaders retain their military strength and consequent \ninfluence in regional politics. Such political instability could hamper smooth supply of \nraw  materials  and  equipment  transported  through  areas  controlled  by  regional \nwarlords and militia leaders, and could constrain supervision of construction works \nby the consultants and ADB staff.  \n \n(iii)  Improved roads can be used as a route to transport opium. As part of the national \ncounternarcotics strategy, the Government will improve border procedures to contain \n                                                 \n24  Coordination with the provincial reconstruction teams providing security for development activities in the project \narea will also be explored.  \n ", "20   \nthe trafficking of narcotics. However, the trafficking of narcotics cannot be completely \ncontained unless opium poppy cultivation is eradicated.  \n \n(iv)  The risks of road connectivity improvements contributing to the spread of HIV/AIDS \nand anti-human trafficking are addressed by the Project\u2019s HIV/AIDS prevention and \nhuman trafficking component.  \n(v)  Because Government implementation capacity remains very weak, implementation \nof key activities may be delayed. Resources will be allocated for consulting services \nto help with project management and implementation. Additional capacity building \ninitiatives focusing on financial management are provided under the TA cluster. The \nGovernment will establish a strong coordination and monitoring mechanism. ADB \nwill field review missions as frequently as necessary. \n \n(vi)  The Government may have difficulty meeting its project cost obligations in a timely \nmanner,  e.g.,  operation  and  maintenance  costs  and  counterpart  funding.  In \nparticular, lack of road sector revenue may constrain MOF\u2019s allocation of sufficient \nroad maintenance budget, which will jeopardize the sustainability of road investment. \nADB will work closely with MPW  to address this issue by examining mitigating \nmeasures to enhance road sector revenues and put in place a mechanism to secure \nsufficient budget for road maintenance (paras. 16-19). \n \n(vii)  The risk of corruption and poor governance will be addressed by ADB\u2019s parallel \nsupport  for  development  of  a  comprehensive  transparency  and  anticorruption \nstrategy, the Government\u2019s disclosure of detailed progress with bid evaluation and \nresults in the newspaper, and ADB\u2019s conduct of random spot checks on work in \nprogress and utilization of funds for the Project.  \n \n78.  The integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs, given the \nlikelihood of the risks occurring and risk mitigation measures to be applied. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n79.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government, MPW , MOF, and MOPH have \ngiven the following specific assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Security. The Government will make its best effort to provide adequate security for \nthe  smooth  and  uninterrupted  implementation  of  the  Project.  In  addition,  the \nGovernment will ensure that all civil works contracts will require the preparation of an \naction plan for adequate security and smooth and uninterrupted implementation of \nthe Project, that the cost of implementing such a plan will be included in the budget \nfor such civil works, and that such a plan is fully implemented. \n \n(ii)  Road maintenance financing. The Government will allocate and make available, in \na timely manner, sufficient funds from its budget for each fiscal year for the operation \nand  proper  maintenance  of  the  project  roads.  The  Government  will  ensure \nimplementation  of  a  toll  collection  system  on  the  ring  road,  which  has  been \nrehabilitated by donors' assistance for its maintenance. The Government will adopt \nadequate procedures to promote transparency and accountability in the collection of \nthe  proceeds  from  the  toll  collection  system  and  will  install  proper  procedures \nincluding spot audits to detect any abuse in collection and use of the proceeds. The \nGovernment will also evaluate other sustainable methods for revenue generation \n ", " 21\nsuch as setting up a dedicated road maintenance fund based on fuel levies, vehicle \nlicensing, and other road user related taxes, and will complete this evaluation by \nDecember 2007. \n \n(iii)  Implementation of the Road Master Plan. Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, \nthe Government will approve the Road Master Plan for Road Network Improvement \nas a document guiding road development and maintenance, and will establish, and \nsufficiently resource and empower, the Master Plan Unit in MPW to program and \nimplement the Road Master Plan. \n \n(iv)  Road safety. The Government will ensure that road safety measures agreed upon \nwith ADB are incorporated in the design of the Project and that public awareness \ncampaigns related to such measures are conducted on a periodic basis. \n \n(v)  Anticorruption.  The  Government  will,  in  addition  to  its  application  of  ADB\u2019s \nanticorruption  policy,  undertake  other  measures  to  ensure  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  including  (a)  submitting  a  general  procurement \nnotice to ADB for publication in accordance with the Procurement Guidelines; (b) \npublishing,  upon  receiving  ADB\u2019s  \u201cno  objection\u201d  to  the  recommendation  of  the \ncontract award, in newspaper dailies circulated nationally, both in English and the \nlocal language (Dari), the results identifying the bid and lot numbers, and also (i) \nname of each bidder; (ii) bid prices as read out at bid opening; (iii) name and \nevaluated prices of each bid evaluated; (iv) names of bidders whose bids were \nrejected and the reasons for their rejection; and (v) name of the winning bidder and \nthe price it offered, as well as the duration and summary scope of the contract \nawarded; and (c) allowing and assisting ADB's representatives to carry out random \nspot checks on the work in progress and utilization of funds for the Project. \n \n(vi)  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  land \nacquisition and resettlement activities will be carried out promptly and efficiently, in \naccordance with (a) all applicable laws and regulations of the Islamic Republic of \nAfghanistan; (b) ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement policy;25 and (c) the agreed-upon \nresettlement plan, The Government will ensure that (a) all people affected are given \nadequate  opportunity  to  participate  in  resettlement  planning  and  implementation, \nparticularly  in  entitlement  and  income  restoration  measures  as  set  out  in  the \nresettlement plan; (b) compensation and other assistance are paid to the affected \npersons in the first section of the project road(s) under each contract package 3 \nmonths prior to their displacement from their houses, land, and assets; and prior to \ncommencement of civil works in such first section; (c) civil works for the subsequent \nsections of the project road(s) under each contract package will not commence until \nthe payment of compensation and other assistance to the affected persons has been \ncompleted prior to their displacement from their houses, land, and assets; (d) MPW \nwill  provide  quarterly  monitoring  reports  to  ADB  on  resettlement  implementation \nincluding detailed compensation assessment and resettlement assistance for each \naffected person, and date and amount of funds disbursed in accordance with the \nresettlement plan, separately for the Government and ADB financed components; (e) \nMPW  will  engage  an  external  monitor,  acceptable  to  ADB  and  with  terms  of \nreference included in the agreed resettlement plan, within 3 months of loan and grant \neffectiveness, who will provide to ADB biannual monitoring and social audit reports \n                                                 \n25  ADB. 1995.

The Government \nwill, prior to the commencement of civil works, prepare an updated resettlement plan \nbased on a final detailed design, which is subject to ADB\u2019s prior approval, and cause \nMPW to (a) disclose the updated resettlement plan and ensure that the information \nwill be available to all affected persons in local form and language, and also by \nposting such information on ADB\u2019s website; (b) submit the progress and completion \nreports on land acquisition and resettlement; (c) recruit NGO(s), acceptable to ADB, \nto facilitate timely and effective implementation and monitoring of the resettlement \nplan; and (d) establish a grievance redress committee as per the resettlement plan to \naddress  environmental,  resettlement,  and  other  social  issues  promptly.  In \naccordance with the updated resettlement plan, the grievance redress committee will \nbe formed with the task of resolving land acquisition and resettlement disputes. In the \nevent that any adverse impacts on indigenous people are identified during project \nimplementation, the Government will prepare an indigenous peoples development \nplan in accordance with ADB\u2019s policy on indigenous people.26 \n \n(viii)  Environmental  protection.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  preparation, \ndesign, construction, implementation, and operation of the Project will be done in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002), the IEE, and the environmental \nmanagement plan. For this purpose the Government will make adequate budget \navailable, and ensure that all mitigating and monitoring measures set out in the IEE \nand  the  environment  management  plan  are  incorporated  in  the  project  design, \nincluding  a  detailed  design  of  the  project  facilities,  and  implemented  during \nconstruction, operation, and maintenance thereof. MPW will forthwith submit the IEE \nreport to the National Environment Protection Agency for its information or approvals, \nas applicable, under the local environmental legislation. MPW shall also submit an \nannual report on its implementation of the environment management plan to ADB, \nNational  Environment  Protection  Agency,  and  other  government  agencies,  as \napplicable. \n \n(ix)  HIV/AIDS  and  Anti-human  trafficking.

27\nROAD SECTOR ANALYSIS \nA.   Road Network \n \n1.  Afghanistan\u2019s road network comprises about 3,300 kilometers (km) of regional highways, \n4,900 km of national highways, 9,700 km of provincial roads, 17,000\u201323,000 km of rural roads,1 \nand about 3,000 km of urban roads including 1,060 km in Kabul. Regional highways, comprising \nthe 2,300 km ring road that connects Afghanistan\u2019s major regional centers (Herat, Kandahar, \nMazar-e-Sharif, Maymaneh, and Sheberghan) with Kabul, and the roads linking to neighboring \ncountries, foster regional trade and economic linkages between Afghanistan and neighboring \ncountries such as Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. National highways \nextend regional highways to provincial capitals contributing to economic growth and national \nintegration. Provincial roads improve the administrative, trade, and economic contacts between \ndistrict  headquarters  and  respective  provincial  capitals,  and  between  important  district \nheadquarters; while rural roads bring remote areas in commercial contact with markets.  \n \nTable A2.1: Road Network in Afghanistan \nRoad Classification   Length (km) \nRegional Highway  3,242 \nNational Highway  4,884 \nProvincial Road  9,656 \n  Subtotal  17,782 \nRural Road (estimate)  17,000 \nTotal  34,782 \nkm = kilometer     \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n2.  Since rehabilitation of roads started after more than two decades of conflict, the focus of \nthe road rehabilitation program has been the reconstruction and completion of the regional \nhighways. Once the current or planned projects are completed by 2007, the existing regional \nhighway network will be improved to a two-lane, bitumen-paved road standard, with certain four-\nlane sections near Kabul and Kandahar. In contrast, more than 90% of national highways and \nprovincial roads are either earth or gravel, and over 60% are in a poor condition. Many are \nimpassable at specific locations such as rivers and sections where severe erosion or landslides \nhave occurred. Except for newly constructed bridges, most bridges and culverts along national \nhighways and provincial roads are in bad condition. Many are in danger of collapse from heavily \nloaded vehicles or of being washed away. Details of road conditions are provided in Table A2.2. \n \n3.  Afghanistan is receiving extensive assistance from the international aid community to \nreconstruct  and  develop  the  road  network.  The  Ministry  of  Public  Works  is  the  primary \nImplementing Agency. The focus of the road program is the reconstruction and completion of \nthe ring road and principal road connections with neighboring countries (the regional highway \nnetwork). Together, the current and planned projects will complete the existing regional highway \nnetwork to a two-lane paved road standard, with certain four-lane sections near Kabul and \nKandahar. The next development stage will be improving high-traffic sections to a four-lane \nstandard.  Other  road  programs  are  being  carried  out  to  reconstruct  or  improve  national \nhighways,  provincial  roads,  and  rural  roads.

Vehicle Fleet and Road Transport Industry \n \n4.  The number of vehicles increased significantly over the past 2 years. According to \nstatistics provided in a recent International Monetary Fund country report,2 transport of goods by \nroad increased from 1.9 million tons in 2000 to 3.7 million tons in 2001 and 5 million tons in \n2002, representing an almost fourfold increase. The number of taxicabs nearly doubled from \n17,000 in 2000 to 33,500 in 2002. More than 147,000 vehicles were estimated to be registered \nin  Kabul,  which  under  certain  assumptions  would  translate  into  about  304,000  vehicles \ncountrywide. Most vehicles are owned and operated by the private sector.  \n                                                 \n2  International Monetary Fund. 2003. Islamic State of Afghanistan: Rebuilding a Macroeconomic Framework for \nReconstruction and Growth. Washington, DC. \n ", "30  Appendix 2 \n5.  The Ministry of Transport (MOT) is the road transport regulator, road transport service \nprovider, as well as policymaker. It regulates the private sector transport industry and manages \nthe government-owned vehicle fleet. Before 1978, freight and long distance bus services were \nleft to the private sector, while the public sector played a role in the Kabul bus service. New \nlegislation in 1978 authorized the Government to provide nationwide freight and passenger \nservices.  In  1990,  MOT  reportedly  controlled  1,600  trucks,  1,000  buses,  and  extensive \nworkshops. During the conflict, however, almost all fleets were lost. MOT provincial checkpoints \nthat once tracked performance and location of its fleets and all other traffic now only monitor \nprivate vehicles. \n \n6.  With  a  current  staffing  level  of  1,180,  MOT\u2019s  primary  function  now  is  coordinating \nagreements between private sector and international transporters, and establishing offices in \nneighboring countries to facilitate international trade. MOT is structured to have 10 departments \nunder the minister and two deputy ministers. Over 70% of the staff is in the private sector \ndepartment, which sets technical standards for private commercial vehicles, inspects them for \ncompliance during the licensing/renewal process, and collects a carriage fee from private trucks \nand  a  trip  fee  from  interprovincial  private  buses.  These  fees  are  collected  at  national  or \nprovincial borders or the outskirts of major cities.  \n \n7.  The  Afghan  private  sector  has  historically  played  a  dominant  role  in  trucking  and \nmaintained its presence, including individuals and firms that relocated in Pakistan during the war \nyears. Long distance public transport, linking major cities and neighboring countries, which \ndeteriorated due to road and vehicle conditions as well as suppressed demand for road travel, \nhas been regaining its role. However, security remains a major impediment for full restoration of \noperations.  \n \n8.  Urban  transport,  once  dominated  by  the  public  sector,  is  now  mostly  provided  by \nprivately owned buses, taxis, and minivans, but with little regulation. It is constrained by lack of \ntransport capacity; congestion; pollution; lack of accessibility; inadequate route coverage; poor \nroad condition; and lack of depots, stops, and terminals as well as designated road space. The \nurban transport system needs integrated planning. Vehicle fleet support services are mostly \nprivately  provided,  with  government  workshops  operating  poorly,  including  those  at  border \npoints. Forms of regional transport depend on the state of the roads and the availability of \nvehicles.  People  and  goods  move  together,  blurring  distinction  between  passenger  and \ncommercial freight traffic. Private agencies operate provincial and district routes. Some 165 \nregistered long-distance private bus companies are estimated to be operating\u2014101 based in \nKabul, 64 in the provinces\u2014with a total of 14,007 buses, mostly old minibuses and vans. \n \n9.  The taxi system in Afghanistan is widespread and well organized. According to MOT, 24 \ntaxi  unions  registered  in  Kabul  and  27  in  the  provinces  have  a  total  of  29,131  vehicles. \nAccording to the Transport Sector Review, the real number of taxis in Kabul is perhaps 30,000. \nTaxis seem to operate freely, with little adherence to zonal or any other rules. In addition, \nintermediate size vehicles of all sizes and shapes transport passengers and goods. \n \nC.   Road Administration \n \n10.  Road administration is highly centralized. Before the protracted hostilities, the Ministry of \nPublic Works (MPW), through its 15 departments, was virtually responsible for all government \nconstruction and maintenance, including roads and bridges, airports, public housing, and water \nsupply.  A  number  of  MPW  construction  units  carried  out  all  aspects  of  planning,  design, \nconstruction,  and  maintenance.  Before  1992,  just  one  of  MPW\u2019s  departments,  Road \n ", "Appendix 2  31\nConstruction and Development, had more than 5,000 employees. In addition, MPW had a \nmultitude of other responsibilities such as city planning and collection of road tolls. Theoretically, \nMPW retains all of these responsibilities. The Ministry of Rehabilitation and Rural Development \nis responsible for development of rural infrastructure, including rural roads. Municipalities are \nresponsible for the construction and maintenance of urban roads. \n \n11.  Over the course of the conflict, the Government ministries lost a majority of their trained \nstaff. In provinces where staff and equipment were retained, they were often under the influence \nof provincial governments and not fully under the control of ministry headquarters in Kabul. This \nsituation is gradually being realigned as the central Government successfully extends its control \noutside Kabul to the provinces. The current staffing level of MPW is about 2,900: 900 are \nemployed on a permanent basis, 1,900 are paid daily wages, and 140 are military officers. Most \nof the current staff require substantial skill enhancement to perform their duties. \n \n12.  To fill the capacity gap, most of the externally funded projects are being implemented \nwith assistance of international consultants in project management. Civil works are packaged \ninto large contracts and bid out through competitive procedures to private sector contractors. \nConsultants engaged by MPW supervise the works of contractors. MPW is being transformed \ninto  a  lean  and  thin  organization  with  its  primary  task  being  nationwide  policy  formation, \nplanning of the countrywide road network, setting of standards (including technical, safety, \nsocial, and environmental safeguards), regulation and enforcement functions, and management \nof roads under its jurisdiction. \n \n \nD.   Road Sector Revenues and Expenditures \n \n13.  Since 2002, with external assistance, the Government has been making massive efforts \nto reestablish the road network, particularly for regional highways, in order to facilitate provision \nof basic social services to remote provinces, provide security, and involve all the population in \nundertaking nation-building activities. Afghanistan is receiving extensive assistance from the \ninternational  aid  community  to  reconstruct  and  develop  the  road  network.  For  regional \nhighways, almost $1.2 billion has been provided or committed to rehabilitate 3,100 km of roads. \nThese rehabilitation works will be completed by 2007. For national highways, about $270 million \nhas been committed to reconstruct and improve 1,200 km of roads. These commitments are \nmainly to rehabilitate damaged roads. \n \n14.  The Government is preparing the priority road development program for the next 10 \nyears  (2006\u20132015)  in  line  with  recommendations  of  the  road  master  plan  currently  being \nprepared with Asian Development Bank assistance. The least-cost option recommended by the \nroad master plan envisages (i) upgrading 281 km of high-traffic regional highways to four lanes, \n(ii) improving 2,700 km of high priority national highways, and (iii) improving 5,000 km of high \npriority provincial roads. The required road expenditure to implement the recommended option \nis $1.7 billion excluding ongoing projects with financing resources secured. Considering the \nlimited prospect for private sector financing of these large investments in the foreseeable future, \nthe public sector and external assistance will continue to be responsible for meeting the road \nexpenditure requirement.  \n \n15.  Routine  road  maintenance  expenditures  are  projected  to  increase  steadily  as  road \nprojects are completed, from $8 million in 2006 to $25 million in 2015. Periodic maintenance will \nnot be required until 2010, but then the expenditure will increase significantly to about $45 \nmillion per year from 2011 to 2015 because the regional and national highway projects currently \nunder  construction  will  require  their  first  periodic  maintenance.  The  most  immediate \n ", "32  Appendix 2 \nmaintenance requirement is for special maintenance work on national highways and provincial \nroads for which maintenance has long been delayed, beginning with an estimated $26 million in \n2006 and gradually decreasing to $14 million in 2015 as the backlog of work is eliminated. \nDuring 2006\u20132015, the need for special works will decrease while the need for routine and \nperiodic maintenance will increase, approximately balancing each other. During 2006\u20132010, the \naverage annual maintenance requirement including routine, periodic, and backlog maintenance \nranges from $34 million to $47 million, increasing to $87 million during 2011\u20132015 because of \nthe significant increase of periodic maintenance. \n \nTable A2.4: Average Annual Maintenance Requirement 2011\u20132015 \n($ million) \n  Regional  National  Provincial   \nItem  Highways  Highways  Roads  Total \nRoutine Maintenance  10  8  4  22 \nPeriodic Maintenance  28  9  9  46 \n  Subtotal   38  17  13  68 \nSpecial Works  0  8  11  19 \n  Total   38  25  24  87 \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n16.  Expected road revenue falls far short of the required road maintenance expenditure. The \nmain source of road revenue, road tolls which the Government will reinstate for rehabilitated \nregional highways, is expected to generate $13 million\u2013$23 million during 2006\u20132015 on the \nbasis of the toll rate of $0.005 per passenger car equivalent per km. Even considering vehicle \nregistration fees currently collected and expected to generate $3 million\u2013$6 million per year \nduring 2006\u20132015, the expected road revenue will be able to finance about 30%\u201350% of the \nroad maintenance requirement.  \n \n17.  To relieve the shortfall of road revenue, the Government is considering introducing a fuel \nlevy. At present, fuel prices in Afghanistan rank among the lowest in the region (about $0.5 per \nliter) with no tax levied except customs duty of 9%, while taxes on fuel in other countries range \nfrom 13% to 70%. Based on fuel usage and estimated vehicle population, the total amount of \nfuel used for road transport is estimated at 582 million liters per year, which can translate into \n$291 million in expenditure for fuel consumed by road users.

Introduction \n \n1.  The proposed project road from Mazar-e-Sharif to Dara-I-Suf and Yakawlang to Bamian \nconstitutes the north\u2013south link connecting the central region of Afghanistan. The project road \nruns  through  the  remotest  and  least  developed  areas  of  the  country.  Rehabilitating  and \nimproving the north\u2013south link will contribute to promoting increased connectivity and linkages \nfor isolated communities, create employment opportunities for unskilled laborers involved in \nroad construction and maintenance (with possible targeting of internally and/or internationally \ndisplaced persons and ex-combatants), promote increased access to basic social services \n(education and health), and support income-generating opportunities for poor households. Other \nthan positive impacts on poverty reduction, improved transport network connectivity (and the \nrelated increased road traffic and mobility) will encourage the introduction of sex workers and \nmigrant labors, leading to a potential increase in the spread of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking \nrisks in the project area. Women\u2019s greater exposure to HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted infections \n(STIs), and, increasingly, human trafficking is acknowledged and forms the rationale for the \nproposed initiatives under this component. \n \nB.  The Current HIV/AIDS Situation \n \n2.  Afghanistan is, on the surface, a conservative Islamic country, making the issues of sex, \ngender relations, and HIV/AIDS sensitive issues to discuss. HIV/AIDS prevalence as reported \nby the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) is 51 HIV cases and 4 deaths (as of 2006). Diagnostic \ncapacity varies and the real number of cases may be far higher as screening has been limited to \nblood  donors.  Little  is  known  about  the  factors  that  influence  the  spread  of  HIV/AIDS  in \nAfghanistan.  However,  many  existing  vulnerability  factors  could  fuel  the  epidemic,  and \ncontribute to women\u2019s greater vulnerability to the risks and impacts of HIV/AIDS. These include \nthe following: \n \n(i)  Low  status  of  women.  Two  decades  of  conflict  have  not  only  led  to  a \nbreakdown of infrastructure and delivery of services in Afghanistan, but also \ncontributed to the downward trend of women's rights. The gender development \nindex is among the lowest in the world. According to a 2006 World Bank report, \nopportunities  available  to  Afghan  women  in  the  areas  of  health,  education, \nemployment, and legal and political rights are extremely low by world standards. \nThey lack access to information on how to protect themselves. Although little \ndata is available, many women may be forced into sex work to support their \nfamilies. \n \n(ii)  High number of refugees and displaced people. As a result of poverty, lack of \namenities, and conflict situations, Afghanistan has the second largest number of \nrefugees  in  the  world  after  Palestine.  According  to  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment  Programme\u2019s  Human  Development  Report,  2004,  3.4  million \nAfghans continue to remain outside the country. In addition, the southern and \nwestern parts of the country host nearly 200,000 internally displaced persons. \nAlthough little is known about the HIV risk behaviors of Afghan refugees and \ndisplaced people, such groups generally have little access to information about \nHIV/AIDS and are often vulnerable due to isolation from their families and lack of \nhope or the means to support themselves. \n ", "Appendix 4  35\n(iii)  Injecting drug use. Afghanistan is one of the world's largest producers of opium, \nwhich is used to make heroin. Easy access to drugs could result in high use of \ninjecting drugs. The combination of poverty and lack of information makes the \nwidespread sharing of needles more likely. \n \n(iv)  Lack of a health system. Much of the population lacks access to basic health \nservices, and most rural areas have an acute shortage of health facilities and \ntrained  staff,  particularly  female  staff.  An  estimated  40%  of  all  basic  health \nfacilities lack female staff. \n \n3.  The National HIV/AIDS and STI Control Program (NACP), adopted in July 2003, is \ncurrently being revised. The first draft of the National Strategic Plan of HIV/AIDS and STI \nControl (2006\u20132010) has been prepared in consultation with different aid partners working in \nthis sector. The strategic plan prepared by MOPH outlines the priority areas of intervention: (i) \nsurveillance  and  research;  (ii)  prevention  of  HIV/AIDS  through  information,  education,  and \ncommunication  (IEC)  for  high-risk  groups  and  the  general  population;  (iii)  prevention  and \nmanagement  of  STIs;  (iv)  blood  safety;  and  (v)  voluntary  counselling  and  testing,  care, \ntreatment,  and  support.  The  NACP  office  in  Kabul  reports  that  three  voluntary  test  and \ncounselling centers are operating in Kabul, Jalalabad, and heart; and three more are being \nopened in other provinces with support from the development partners. The NACP office notes \na severe lack of information on HIV/AIDS prevalence among different high-risk groups and the \ngeneral population. MOPH is planning to conduct surveillance surveys and social mapping to \nidentify behavioral patterns of high-risk groups. MOPH together with the Ministry of Religious \nAffairs and support from development partners (United Nations Children\u2019s Fund [UNICEF] and \nUnited  Nations  Population  Fund  [UNFPA]),  organized  the  Religious  Leaders  National \nConsultative Conference on HIV/AIDS in July 2004, in which the role of religious leaders on \nincreasing  awareness  of  HIV/AIDS  and  STIs  was  identified  and  an  action  plan  prepared. \nUnderstanding the sociocultural and economic factors and power relations between men and \nwomen,  among  men,  and  among  women  is  essential  to  understanding  the  behavioral \nunderpinnings of the spread of HIV/AIDS. \n \nC.  The Current Human Trafficking Situation \n \n4.  Human  trafficking  is  the  forced  removal  and  migration  of  people  against  their  will. \nAccording to the International Organisation for Migration, Afghanistan is prone to both internal \nand international trafficking. Human trafficking victims are often women and children, usually \ndestined  for  Middle  Eastern  countries.  Numerous  types  of  activities  are  related  to  human \n55trafficking, many are linked to poverty in the country. These include (i) commercial sex work, \n(ii) forced labor in the carpet industry and servitude, (iii) forced recruitment into armed groups, \n(iv) forced religious training, and (v) sale of body organs (as indicated by local nongovernment \norganizations [NGOs]). Poppy cultivation is also supposed to be a sign of poverty and human \ntrafficking for labor, but people are reported to voluntarily do this work as it provides substantial \nfinancial return. With respect to this project, since cross-border traffic is not expected to use the \nproject roads, the possibility of internal trafficking could materialize. \n \nD.  Guiding Principles HIV/AIDS and Trafficking  \n \n5.  In  2005,  in  the  design  of  the  Qaisar  to  Bala  Murgab  Road  Project,  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) adopted a set of guiding principles with regard to the prevention of \nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking, in consultation with international and national NGOs, United \nNations  agencies  (UNFPA,  UNICEF,  World  Health  Organization),  and  MOPH  involved  in \n ", "36  Appendix 4 \nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking prevention in Afghanistan. Since HIV/AIDS is a difficult issue to \nbroach in a conservative society like Afghanistan, similar guiding principles will be adopted for \nthis Project. They are as follows: \n \n(i)  An awareness program on HIV/AIDS will be designed in line with the NACP. Any \nintervention  program  will  be  designed  and  implemented  in  coordination  with \nMOPH and in consultation with other development partners. \n \n(ii)  Sensitization  workshops,  to  be  carried  out  by  MOPH  with  support  from \ndevelopment partners for MPW, Department of Religious Affairs, and partner \nNGOs,  will  emphasize  the  linkage  between  construction  of  roads  and \ntransmission of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking. \n \n(iii)  HIV/AIDS and human trafficking awareness will be implemented not as a stand-\nalone component but rather integrated to relevant ongoing aid-assisted projects \nor  will  be  discussed  along  with  other  priority  issues  linked  to  basic  health \nservices, reproductive health, hygiene awareness, and literacy programs. \n \n(iv)  Community  leaders,  opinion  leaders,  religious  leaders,  and  women\u2019s \norganizations  will  be  involved;  and  community  awareness  and  training  on \nHIV/AIDS and combating human trafficking will be provided for better outreach. \n \n(v)  As a start point, increasing awareness of HIV/AIDS, STIs, and human trafficking \nwill  be  initiated  in  cities,  urban  areas,  and  market  places;  once  successful, \ninformation on the issues will be disseminated in remote areas. \n \n(vi)  MPW with assistance from MOPH will collaborate with different development \npartners (UNFPA, UNICEF, World Bank, World Health Organization, and others) \nto prepare a detailed operational plan for increasing awareness of HIV/AIDS and \nhuman trafficking for the Project. \n \n(vii)  MPW with assistance from MOPH will collaborate with different development \npartners  to  seek  technical  expertise  on  training,  IEC,  capacity  building  on \nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking issues; and support on counselling, condom \ndistribution, and treatment services. \n \nE.  HIV/AIDS and Human Trafficking Subcomponent \n \n6.  Baseline information data on HIV/AIDS, migration, and human trafficking patterns in the \nproject area, including a list of local government and NGO stakeholders, will be gathered based \non existing quantitative and qualitative data.1 In line with the national and international priorities, \ni.e.  Millennium  Development  Goals  and  the  targets  sets  in  the  Afghanistan  National \nDevelopment Strategy, UNICEF\u2019s Mid-Term Strategic Plan, Advancement of Women in the UN \nSecretary General\u2019s Office, and the MOPH National Health Policy and Strategy (2005\u20132009), \nthe  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  subcomponent  will  have  the  following  key  areas  of \nactivities: \n \n                                                 \n1  At this stage, the feasibility of carrying out a baseline survey in the project area is uncertain. It will be assessed by \nthe NACP and the selected international organization during project inception. \n ", "Appendix 4  37\n(i)  Institutional development of government agencies. MOPH realizes HIV/AIDS \nis  a  major  emerging  public  health  problem. 2  Thus,  institutional  capacity \ndevelopment  is  required  to  ensure  adequate  leadership,  management,  and \nmonitoring  of  the  country\u2019s  HIV  program.  While  continuous  support  may  be \nprovided to MOPH, emphasis will be on developing the capacity of MPW to \nengage  with  MOPH  and  the  NACP  in  developing  a  concerted  approach  to \nHIV/AIDS  prevention  in  transportation  and  related  road  construction.  The \ncapacity upgrading will be through technical support, sponsored exchange visits, \nand participation in international conferences and relevant venues. \n \n(ii)  Capacity  development  for  local  NGOs.  This  subcomponent  will  consist  of \ntraining  of  selected  local  NGOs,  based  on  their  current  involvement  and/or \npotential  to  increase  the  outreach  and  impact  of  HIV/AIDS  prevention,  and \nmeasures to combat trafficking and regulation of migration in the project area. \nThe  training  module  will  be  developed  by  the  international  organization  and \nrelevant government agencies, and provide (i) technical skills (social, gender, \nmedical, and psychological aspects related to HIV/AIDS, human trafficking, and \nmigration);  (ii)  administrative,  financial,  and  management  skills;  (iii)  proposal \nwriting skills, to ensure quality proposals and sustainable access to aid funding; \nand  (iv)  development  of  a  behavior  change  communication  strategy  and \nmaterials for both literate and illiterate communities.3 Upon successful completion \nof  the  training,  local  NGOs  will  be  involved  in  implementing  socioculturally \nsensitive HIV/AIDS preventative initiatives within the framework provided by other \nhealth programs, which include nutrition (i.e., breastfeeding in relation to parent-\nto-child  transmission);  maternal  health  (i.e.,  safe  blood  transfusion,  infection \nprevention measures, antenatal and postnatal care); and community-awareness. \nCondom promotion and distribution at critical points and during the awareness \nraising training will be supported. \n \n(iii)  Awareness and prevention initiatives. Lack of awareness and low knowledge \nof HIV/AIDS and STI in general, and HIV prevention in particular, is a reality in \nAfghanistan. Over the coming months, MOPH, with support from UNICEF, will \ndevelop an evidence-based communication strategy on HIV/AIDS prevention and \ncontrol in Afghanistan. The strategy will be based on a desk review, formative \nresearch,  development  of  a  strategic  framework,  development  of  appropriate \ncommunications materials, pretesting and finalization of materials based on the \npretesting, and preparation of detailed specifications for mass production of IEC \nmaterials.4 Awareness and prevention initiatives will target (i) high-risk groups \nincluding injecting drug users and commercial sex workers, as well as young \npeople  and  adolescents;  (ii)  contractors  and  construction  workers;  and  (iii) \ncommunities along the corridor of influence. Briefing sessions for imams and \nmullahs will be carried out in the districts, and opinion leaders and community \nleaders in the villages and communities. Religious leaders\u2019 role in increasing \ncommunity  awareness  of  HIV  prevention  will  be  enhanced.  Gender-relevant \naspects of HIV/AIDS prevention, such as counseling for adolescent girls and \nwomen, and the prevention of parent-to-child transmission will be supported.

This  will  include  (i)  sensitization  and  capacity \ndevelopment of MPW, MOPH, and project staff on the issue of human trafficking; \nand (ii) increasing public awareness through public media and IEC materials \nincluding hoardings at important junctions. The awareness generation will aim at \nconveying behavioral change messages, and providing safe migration tips to \nvulnerable groups. \n \nF.  Selection Criteria for International Organization and National NGOs \n \n7.  International Organization. A qualified international organization will be recruited for \noverall management of the HIV/AIDS and human trafficking component. Proposed activities aim \nat mitigating the risks associated with the rehabilitation of the north\u2013south corridor for high-risk \nand target groups. The international organization will be selected based on the following criteria: \n(i)  expertise  in  promoting  community-based  approaches  in  STI  prevention,  regulation  of \nmigration, and combating trafficking; (ii) commitment to promoting gender equality and the \nempowerment of women within its policy, programs, and activities; (iii) expertise in providing \ncapacity building of local governments and national NGOs involved in STI prevention, regulation \nof  migration,  and  combating  trafficking;  and  (iv)  expertise  in  facilitating  and/or  promoting \nsustainable  partnership  modalities  between  government  and  civil  society  NGOs.  The \ninternational NGO  may subcontract the implementation of subcomponent activities to local \nNGOs. \n \n8.  National  NGO.  To  be  eligible  for  funding,  national  NGOs  (women\u2019s  NGOs  and/or \nHIV/AIDS NGOs) must be a not-for-profit organization; be legally registered (at least 3 years) as \nan NGO in an ADB member country; have operated for at least 3 years; have a minimum of five \npaid staff; be committed to the principles of gender equality in terms of its own staffing; have a \nmanagement or advisory board; maintain a proper accounting and financial system; have a \ndemonstrated  track  record  to  promote  HIV/AIDS  prevention,  combating  trafficking,  and \nregulation of migration; have a long-term presence and credibility in districts relevant for the \nproject area; have openness to work with government focal agencies; and improve public-\nprivate partnerships in promoting HIV/AIDS prevention, combating trafficking, and migration. \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n9.  The  component  will  be  implemented  intermittently  over  3  years.  MOPH  will  be  the \nExecuting Agency and responsible for overall implementation of the component. An MOPH \nofficial will be responsible for providing technical support for overall component implementation. \nA consultant with expertise in gender, health, and HIV/AIDS issues will be engaged for 2 years \nto assist MOPH in preparing the overall strategy, work plan, and fund utilization mechanism for \nthe  component  in  consultation  with  other  development  partners.  The  consultant  will  assist \nMOPH in monitoring implementation throughout the project period. A qualified international \norganization (including but not limited to international NGOs) will be engaged under the quality- \nand cost-based selection method to manage and coordinate implementation during the 3-year \nroad  rehabilitation  process.  The  international  organization  will  consult  with  MOPH  on  the \ndetailed design of the subcomponents. \n \n10.  At the central level, the international organization will be responsible for organizing \nquarterly meetings of an advisory working group in Kabul, chaired by the director of the NACP, \n ", "Appendix 4  39\nand include representatives from MPW; MOPH; MWA; other government agencies involved in \nHIV/AIDS, trafficking, and regulation of migration; and relevant international organizations and \nlocal NGOs. At the provincial level, it will be responsible for organizing quarterly meetings of an \nadvisory working group, chaired by the department of health, and include local government \nrepresentatives,  local  representatives  of  the  Ministry  of  Women\u2019s  Affairs,  and  community \nleaders. Advisory working groups will provide guidance on implementation and constitute a \nforum for technical discussions and mutual update on ongoing Government and/or aid-funded \nprograms that may inform and/or contribute to focusing the proposed interventions. The ADB \ngender specialist located in the Afghanistan Resident Mission will support implementation and \nwork in close relationship with the international organization to ensure the timely and effective \nimplementation of the subcomponent. \n \nH.   Reporting, Monitoring, and Evaluation \n \n11.  The  NACP  is  finalizing  national  indicators  for  monitoring  and  evaluating  HIV/AIDS \nprevention  programs.  The  following  is  a  list  of  output  indicators  that  may  be  adapted,  as \nneeded, during project inception to ensure consistency with the national indicators:5 \n \n(i)  number of Government agencies and local NGOs trained in the project area; \n(ii)  number of Behavioral Communication Change (BCC) initiatives carried out and \ntarget and high-risk groups reached; \n(iii)  number of labor skill transfer initiatives for women carried out and target groups \nreached; \n(iv)  number of HIV testing kits, STI treatment packages, and condoms distributed; \n(v)  percentage of people seeking information on HIV/AIDS testing and counseling; \n(vi)  percentage of people being tested for HIV; and \n(vii)  number of STI patients seeking care and treatment. \n \n12.  The  international  organization  will  submit  a  detailed  work  program  1  month  after \nsignature of the contract and submit quarterly and annual reports to the NACP for transmission \nto the MPW\u2019s PMU and ADB. The international NGO, assisted by its consultant, will conduct a \nmidterm (1.5 years) and completion review and evaluation (3.0 years), covering quantitative and \nqualitative aspects of program implementation. \n \nI.

The  national  highway  network  is \nplanned  to  promote  trade  and  economic  linkages;  extend  regional  highways  to  provincial \ncapitals; and contribute to peace, security, stability, economic growth, and national integration. \nMost parts of the two sections are highly prioritized due to its significant function in the national \nhighway network. In flat terrain sections, traffic speed is expected to be higher than on other \nminor roads. Based on these economic and safety features, flat sections with high traffic volume \nand in built-up areas will have a typical cross section designed for two traffic lanes of 3.50 m \nwide each, with two granular shoulders of 1.5 m and two verges of 0.5 m, with a total width of \n11.0 m.  \n \n3.  In rolling and mountainous terrain, to reduce the construction cost and account for \nslower traffic speeds, the typical cross section suggested is 9.0 m, by reducing the width of the \ncarriage way to 6.0 m and shoulder to 1.0 m. In exceptional cases where the alignment passes \nthrough unavoidable constrained areas such as religious structures or confined river sides, \nreducing the carriage and shoulder width to 6.0 m and 0.50 m is recommended.  \n \n4.  The pavements were designed in accordance with accepted international standards and \nprocedures for a 15-year life, with provision for overlays during or at the end of 10 years to \ncover the serviceability loss and extend the life to 15 years, while maintaining the international \nroughness index at recommended levels. The designs are based on traffic counts and traffic \nprojections  (for  capacity),  and  axle-load  surveys  and  projections  (for  structural  capacity). \nRoughness values for the completed pavements, expressed in international roughness index \n ", "42  Appendix 5 \nterms, should be 2.0\u20132.5. The suggested pavement thickness includes five layers totaling 1,150 \nmillimeters  (mm):  (i)  100  mm  asphalt  layers with  100  mm  granular  shoulder;  (ii)  250  mm \ncrushed stone base; (iii) 200 mm granular subbase; and (iv) 500 mm frost-free subgrade. \n \n5.  Geometric Design. The design standards proposed for the Project, in principle, follow \nAmerican Association of State Highway and Transportation Official standards. For different \nterrain conditions, minimum design standards corresponding to the following design speeds are \nadopted: (i) flat terrain (80 km/hour), (ii) rolling terrain (60 km/hour), and (iii) mountainous terrain \n(40 km/hour).

Genesis \n \nSince rehabilitation of roads started after more than two decades of conflict, the focus of the \nroad  rehabilitation  program  has  been  the  reconstruction  and  completion  of  the  regional \nhighways. Once the current or planned projects are completed by 2008, the existing regional \nhighway network will be improved to a two-lane bitumen-paved road standard, with certain four-\nlane  sections  near  Kabul  and  Kandahar.  In  contrast,  over  90%  of  national  highways  and \nprovincial roads are either earth or gravel, and over 60% are in a poor condition. Many of them \n ", "Appendix 7  47\n \n \nare motorable along the greater part of their length but are impassable at specific locations such \nas rivers and sections where severe erosion or landslides have occurred. Except for newly \nconstructed bridges, most bridges and culverts along national highways and provincial roads \nare in bad condition. Many are in danger of collapse from heavily loaded vehicles or from being \nwashed away.  \n \nAnticipating regional highway work to be completed by 2008, the Government put its next \npriority to development of the north\u2013south corridor and the east\u2013west corridor, which connect \nthe  ring  road  horizontally  and  perpendicularly  and  provide  better  access  to  people  in  the \nhinterland at the center of the country.  \n \nDuring the first phase of road rehabilitation after resuming its operation in Afghanistan in 2002, \nADB gave its priority attention to rehabilitation of regional highways, particularly the ring road, \nwith  emphasis  on  trade  links  to  neighboring  countries,  including  bridges,  disintegrated \npavements, drainage erosion protection, and routine maintenance. As rehabilitation of regional \nhighways is completed, ADB is placing its next priority to connection of the ring road through the \nnorth\u2013south  corridor  or  the  east\u2013west  corridor  as  recommended  by  the  road  master  plan \nprepared with ADB assistance. The project roads comprise the north\u2013south and east\u2013west \ncorridor, which connect the central hinterland of Afghanistan to the major cities such as Mazar-\ne-Sharif and Kabul where the ring road passes. Bamian, the main focus of the JFPR component, \nis  renowned  for  its  abundant  historical  and  cultural  relics,  which  should  be  protected  and \npreserved.  Improved  road  connection  to  Bamian  will  generate  a  synergy  to  ongoing \ndevelopment partner activities to preserve such invaluable assets.  \n \n4.   Innovation  \n \nThere are no innovations in the design of the project in terms of poverty reduction interventions, \nbeing primarily a road construction project. However, to the extent possible, local labor will be \nused to generate local employment. \n \nImproved roads will also lead to shift from subsistence agriculture to market-based production \nenabling farmers to grow perishable commercial products like vegetables and fruits allowing \nthem to transport these goods at much shorter time. The farmers in the provinces would also be \nable to diversify their cropping patterns, cultivate high-value crops, grow larger marketable \nsurpluses to improve their income-earning capacities as well as generate more agricultural \nwage employment, particularly benefiting the poor. \n \nImproved road conditions will lead to growth of affordable transport facilities and thus the poor, \nespecially  women  and  children,  will  have  more  reliable,  affordable,  and  timely  access  to \neducational and medical facilities. Lower transportation costs will also increase mobility among \nthe poor to find employment opportunities in other areas. Increased access to local and national \nmarkets will lead to growth of local trade, increased production activities, and reduced prices of \nagricultural commodities and other products.  \n \n5.   Sustainability \n \nRoutine road maintenance expenditures are projected to increase steadily as road projects are \ncompleted, from $8 million in 2006 to $25 million in 2015. Periodic maintenance will not be \nrequired until 2010, when the expenditure will increase significantly to about $45 million per year \nfrom  2011  to  2015  because  the  regional  and  national  highway  projects  currently  under \nconstruction will reach the stage requiring the first periodic maintenance.  \n \n ", "48  Appendix 7 \n \nThe most immediate maintenance requirement is for special maintenance works on national \nhighways and provincial roads of which maintenance has long been delayed, beginning with an \nestimated $26 million in 2006 and gradually decreasing to $14 million in 2015 as the backlog of \nwork is eliminated. Over the period of 2006\u20132015, the need for special works will decrease while \nthe need for routine and periodic maintenance will increase, approximately balancing each \nother. For the years 2006\u20132010, the average maintenance annual maintenance requirement \nincluding routine, periodic, and backlog maintenance ranges from $34 million to $47 million, \nwhile the same will increase to $87 million for the years of 2011\u20132015 because of the significant \nincrease of periodic maintenance. \n \nThe  expected  road  revenue,  however,  falls  far  short  of  the  required  road  maintenance \nexpenditure. The main source of road revenue, road tolls which the Government will reinstate \nfor rehabilitated regional highways, is expected to generate $13 million\u2013$23 million for the \nperiod of 2006\u20132015 on the basis of the toll rate of $0.005 per passenger car equivalent per km. \nEven considering vehicle registration fees currently collected and expected to generate $3 \nmillion\u2013$6 million per year for the period of 2006\u20132015, the expected road revenue will be able \nto finance around 30%50% of road maintenance requirement.  \n \nTo  relieve  the  shortfall  of  road  revenue,  The  Government  will  evaluate  other  sustainable \nmethods for revenue generation such as setting up a dedicated road maintenance fund based \non fuel levies, vehicles licensing, and other road-user related taxes; and will complete this \nevaluation by December 2007. At present, fuel prices in Afghanistan rank among the lowest in \nthe region (about $0.5 per liter) with no tax levied except customs duty of 9%, while taxes on \nfuel in other countries range from 13% to 70%. Based on fuel usage and estimated vehicle \npopulation, the total amount of fuel used for road transport vehicles is estimated as 582 million \nliters per year, which can translate into $291 million in expenditure for fuel consumed by road \nusers. If a 10%\u201315% fuel tax is introduced, it will generate $29 million\u2013$48 million of additional \nroad  revenue,  which  will  be  sufficient  to  cover  the  shortfall  of  current  road  revenue.  The \ndevelopment partners\u2019 local consultative group, consisting of major financiers such as the World \nBank,  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID),  and  Japan  Bank  for \nInternational Cooperation, considers introduction of fuel tax as one of its key agenda for policy \ndialogue and will continue its dialogue with the Government to secure stable financing sources \nfor sustainable road maintenance. \n \n6.   Participatory Approach \n \nThe project development and activities were discussed with the local communities during the \nconsultation  meetings  at  various  project  locations.  The  discussions  were  held  with  all  the \nprimary stakeholders and the secondary stakeholders including the local administration, Land \nAsset Agriculture Department, etc. and with  various other international and local agencies \ninvolved  with  the  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  in  Afghanistan.  The  directly  affected \npopulations were consulted to understand their concerns regarding the road construction and \ngather suggestions on the types of mitigation measures that should be considered to address \nthe envisaged impacts. The consultations and discussions with the project affected people will \nbe  a  continuing  activity  throughout  the  implementation  stage  of  the  project.  During \nimplementation, MPW will be assisted in conducting the consultations by the NGO that will be \ncontracted for resettlement plan implementation. A summary of the resettlement plan and the \nentitlement matrix will be translated into the local language (Dari) and disclosed to affected \npersons and made available in local MPW offices, Afghanistan Resident Mission, and ADB \nwebsite. The NGO will keep the affected people informed about the impacts, compensation, and \nassistance proposed for them; and facilitate addressing any grievances among the project \naffected people. The affected persons will participate in all the decisions and implementation of \n ", "Appendix 7  49\n \n \nresettlement plan; and be involved in the grievance redress committee to review and resolve \nany dispute concerning compensation and other resettlement benefits. There will be continuous \non-site consultation during the implementation stage to ensure that those affected receive their \ndue  entitlements/benefits,  particularly  the  direct  benefits  they  can  reap  by  being  hired  as \nconstruction workers. Resettlement impact was fully assessed and a full resettlement plan was \nprepared as part of the main project. \n \n7.   Coordination \n \nThe ring road is being rehabilitated with financial and technical assistance (TA) from bilateral \nand multilateral funding agencies. The Government of Japan and USAID provided support for \nrehabilitation of Kabul\u2013Kandahar road. USAID, Government of Japan, and Government of Saudi \nArabia provided financing for rehabilitating the Kandahar\u2013Herat road. The World Bank and the \nIslamic Development Bank provided support for rehabilitation of the Kabul\u2013Doshi-Pul-e-Khumri \nroad  including  repair  of  Salang  tunnel.  ADB\u2019s  Emergency  Infrastructure  Rehabilitation  and \nReconstruction Project1 finances rehabilitation of the road from Pul-e-Khumri via Mazar-e-Sharif \nto Andkhuouy. For the Herat\u2013Andkhuouy section, Iran provided support for the Herat\u2013Armalik \nroad, while ADB provided support for the Ankhoy\u2013Bala Murghab road. The remaining 183 km of \nArmalik\u2013Bala Murghab will be rehabilitated with support from Saudi Arabia and the Islamic \nDevelopment Bank.  \n \nIn 2004, ADB provided TA for preparation of a road master plan to develop a road development \nprogram  for  the  next  5\u201310  years.  The  program  is  to  provide  efficient  and  effective  road \nrehabilitation focusing on identifying major east\u2013west and north\u2013south corridors to cross-link the \nring road. The TA will also assess financing requirements for sustainable road maintenance and \npropose desirable and sustainable financing mechanisms. ADB\u2019s next phase of assistance for \nroad rehabilitation will be based on the road development program of the TA; the World Bank \nhas no road improvement program in the pipeline as the ring road is completed. \n \nThe proposal was fully discussed with the Embassy of Japan in Kabul (Junichi Sumi, head, \nEconomics Section), which expressed strong support for JFPR funding for the proposal. JICA in \nKabul  (Shigehiko  Sugita,  assistant  resident  representative)  also  expressed  support  for  the \nproposal.  \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003.

Linkage to ADB Strategy and ADB-Financed Operations \n \n  1.   Linkage to ADB Strategy  \n \nADB places priority on rehabilitation of the road system, critical for a landlocked country. Roads \nare needed to rebuild the economy by establishing major economic linkages both domestically \nas  well  as  with  neighboring  countries.  The  strategic  framework  for  the  rehabilitation, \nreconstruction, and development of the road sector consists of the following elements: (i) policy \nand  institutional  development;  (ii)  capacity  building;  (iii)  private  sector  development;  (iv) \nemployment  generation;  (v)  community  participation;  (vi)  decentralization  of  network \nmanagement;  (vii)  sustainable  sector  financing  and  cost  recovery;  (viii)  protection  and \npreservation of environment; (ix) avoiding and mitigating resettlement; (x) absorbing returnee \nrefugees,  ex-combatants,  and  women  in  road  construction  and  maintenance;  and  (xi) \ninvolvement of the NGO community in road construction and maintenance \n \nDuring the first phase of road rehabilitation after resuming its operation in Afghanistan in 2002, \nADB gave its priority attention to rehabilitation of regional highways, particularly the ring road, \nwith  emphasis  on  trade  links  to  neighboring  countries,  including  bridges,  disintegrated \npavements, drainage erosion protection, and routine maintenance. As rehabilitation of regional \nhighways completes, ADB gives its next priority to connection of the ring road through the north-\nsouth corridor or the east-west corridor as recommended by the road master plan which is \nunder preparation by ADB\u2019s assistance. This is also in line with the Government\u2019s priority \ninvestment projects identified for the transport national program. Further, ADB\u2019s assistance for \nroads rehabilitation will include capacity building. As recommended by the road master plan, \nADB\u2019s approach to road planning and design will take into account the subregional links, which \nwill demand a higher standard than would be the case if roads were for the use of Afghanistan \nalone.  \n ", "Appendix 7  51\n \n \n \nDocument  Date of Last  Objective(s) \nDocument \nNumber  Discussion \nCountry       \nStrategy and \nProgram \nUpdate \n2006\u20132008 \n \n \n  2.

Rationale for Grant Funding versus ADB Lending \n \nThe  ADF  resources  allocated  to  the  North\u2013South  Corridor  Project are  $118.2  million.  The \nproject was supposed to finance only a part of Bamian\u2013Yakawlang road because of insufficient \nproject budget. During the fact-finding of the project, the Embassy of Japan in Kabul expressed \ntheir interest to participate in rehabilitation of Bamian\u2013Yakawlang road with $20 million of JFPR. \nAccordingly, the scope of rehabilitation of Bamian\u2013Yakawlang road was expanded to cover the \ncomplete stretch of road with the increased project budget.  \n \nD.   Implementation of the Proposed Grant \n \n1.   Implementing Agency:   Ministry of Public Works  \n \nProcurement of goods, services, and civil works to be financed under the ADB loan will be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April 2006). Civil works contracts \nwill be procured through international competitive bidding (ICB). A single-stage two-envelope \nprocedure with no separate prequalification will be used. Equipment for cross-border facilities \nwill  be  procured  by  limited  international  bidding.  All  international  procurements  will  be \nundertaken  by  the  Government  procurement  unit  operating  under  the  Afghanistan \nReconstruction and Development Services. \n \nThe project area is located in the western part of the country, where ADB nonmember countries, \nparticularly  those  in  the  Gulf  region,  provide  competitive  sources  of  materials,  especially \nbitumen required for road pavement. Explicit procurement restrictions may preclude civil works \ncontractors under  the  Project  from  seeking  the  best  business  terms,  and  ultimately  erode \neconomic efficiency. To maximize the Project\u2019s development impact and economic efficiency, it \nis proposed that civil works contractors under the Project be allowed to procure the bitumen \nrequired  for  road  pavement  from  all  countries,  including  from  countries  that  are  not  ADB \nmembers. 2  This  special  treatment  was  applied  to  three  previous  transport  projects  in \nAfghanistan, i.e., the Regional Airports Rehabilitation Project, the Andkhuouy\u2013Qaisar Road \nProject, both approved in 2004, and Qaisar\u2013Bala Murghab Road Project approved in 2005. \n \nAll consultants financed from the ADB loan will be selected and engaged in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.   \n \n    \n                                                 \n2  This is pursuant to Article 14(ix) of the ADB Charter, which provides that the Board may, by a vote of the directors \nrepresenting not less than two thirds of the total voting power of the members, agree to permit in special \ncircumstances procurement from non-ADB member countries \n ", "Appendix 7  53\n \n \n2.

No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Afghanistan: \n \nThe Afghanistan Government has accorded highest priority to developing road infrastructure. Currently the country\u2019s \nroad network comprises regional highways (ring roads and links to neighboring countries) and several national \nhighways. However, no roads connect the central region from the north to south, which has resulted in traffic having to \nuse a circuitous route. This increases both travel distance and travel time. Thus the construction of a north\u2013south link \nroad will reduce travel distance and time, and promote economic growth in the region. The inadequate road system \nkeeps many farmers dependent on subsistence agriculture with no, or limited, access to markets, education, and \nhealth care. The project roads run through the remotest and least developed areas of the country. Portions of the \nexisting road are paved but most is merely mud truck tracks where most of the sections easily turn impassable after \nthe rains. Rehabilitating and improving the north\u2013south link will also contribute to employment creation, income \ngeneration for poor households, and rehabilitation of internally and/or internationally displaced persons and ex-\ncombatants, thus reducing the incidence of poverty in the project area. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                        Poverty Classification: General intervention \n \nIn Afghanistan, nearly 53% of the population are classified as poor1 and live on less than $1 a day. The project road \npasses through the provinces of Balkh, Samangan, and Bamian and will benefit a total population of 1,735,800.2. \nBefore the war, these provinces were known for their agriculture, livestock, handicrafts, and carpets industry. The \nexisting road condition is the biggest constraint as people are unable to transport their products to markets and \ncurrently crops are grown only on a small scale, which is enough for household consumption. Irrigation facilities are \nlimited and few farmers still cultivate poppies to increase their income. Poverty in these provinces is estimated at 60%, \nwith most of the population living in mud houses (80\u201395%) and the majority of households living without electricity, \nclean water, proper sanitation facilities, and garbage disposal. As per the data available, only 10%\u201311% of the \nhouseholds in these three provinces have access to clean water; only 10% in Balkh province have a garbage disposal \nsystem. The social assessment indicates that the population living along the proposed alignment is generally poor with \nabout 48% having an annual income of less than $600 with an average household size of 9. The survey also indicates \nthat 75% are engaged in subsistence agriculture and allied activities for their livelihood, while the rest have small \nbusinesses in the town areas.  \n \nAfghanistan ranks 4th highest for under-5 mortality rate at 257 deaths/1,000; the infant mortality rate is at a high \n165/1,000. Among the three provinces Balkh has four hospitals, Samangan has only one provincial hospital, and \nBamian has only one district hospital with a limited number of beds to cater to the entire population. The survey \nreveals that the local population in these provinces has to use private transport facilities to reach the hospitals, which \nis expensive due to poor road conditions and limited availability. Due to poor road conditions, some emergency cases \ncould not reach the hospitals on time. Apart from difficulty accessing district and provincial hospitals, people travelled \n1\u20132 hours on foot to reach the nearest health center. Malnutrition among children is very common in the project area, \nwhile adults and children also suffer from diseases like malaria, diarrhoea, and bronchitis due to the unclean \nenvironment resulting from lack of clean water and air pollution. Lack of adequate and accessible educational facilities \nis another major problem in the project area. Although, the provinces have primary and secondary schools, only the \npopulation living near the towns send their children to school, while children living in smaller settlements are deprived \nof schooling due to poor road conditions and lack of transport facilities. Some schools lack proper buildings and \nteaching equipment. Poor road conditions and accessibility also constrain teachers and health personnel from working \nin this region.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program Update (2004\u20132006): Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Manila. \n2  Central Statistics Office Afghanistan, 2003. \n ", "62  Appendix 11 \nThe Project will lead to direct and indirect poverty reduction impacts. The direct poverty impact will be on income \ngeneration and demand for unskilled labor and wages accruing during construction of the project road. Other benefits \nwill be lower travel time and travel costs, and higher agricultural product profit margins. Improved roads will lead to a \nshift from subsistence agriculture to market-based production enabling farmers to grow perishable commercial \nproducts like vegetables and fruits that they can transport to market more quickly. The farmers in the provinces will \nalso be able to diversify their cropping patterns; cultivate high-value crops; grow larger marketable surpluses to \nimprove their income-earning capacities; and generate more agricultural wage employment, particularly benefiting the \npoor. Road improvement will facilitate revival of the carpet and handicraft industry in the region, especially benefiting \npoor women by increasing their income. Improved road conditions will lead to growth of affordable transport facilities \nand thus the poor, especially women and children will have more reliable, affordable, and timely access to educational \nand  medical  facilities.  Lower  transportation  costs  will  increase  mobility  among  the  poor  to  find  employment \nopportunities in other areas. Increased access to local and national markets will lead to growth of local trade and \nproduction activities, and reduced prices of agricultural commodities and other products. The benefit of the improved \nroad in terms of reduction of vehicle-operating costs will not only be transferred to road users but will decrease the \nchances of accident deaths and disabilities that result from extremely poor road conditions. Thus increased economic \nactivity and easy access to social services are expected to significantly increase household incomes and quality of life, \nthereby reducing the overall poverty incidence.  \n \nThe Project proposes to utilize, to the extent possible, labor-intensive construction methods to provide much-needed \nemployment and income-generation opportunities during project implementation, and use the services of the local \npopulation for postconstruction maintenance activities. It will contribute to social stability and poverty reduction by \nengaging, among others, refugees and ex-combatants. Thus, the investment is expected to significantly improve the \nsocioeconomic situation and mitigate the pervasive poverty spread in the project area. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes    No \nIs there a participation strategy?    Yes    No \n \nThe Project has identified and consulted with both primary and secondary stakeholders. During social analysis \nextensive consultations were carried out with the local people (men and women), road users, truck drivers, vehicle \noperators, shop owners, farmers, traders, nongovernment organizations in the prominent towns, villages in the project \ninfluence area to ascertain their response to the construction of road, and their needs and demands from the Project. \nApart from the public meetings, focus group discussions were organized with the young, old, men, and women from \ndifferent occupations and population groups to ensure a comprehensive perspective on the Project as well as its \nimpacts. All those consulted had positive reactions toward the Project and welcomed the benefits that improved \naccess and/or road conditions would provide. They also emphasized that households that will be adversely affected \nshould be compensated by the Project for their losses, so that they are able to reestablish their livelihoods and take \nadvantage of road improvement.  \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nWomen in Afghanistan are generally denied inheritance rights, adequate food and nutrition, choice of education, and \nparticipation in the decision-making process of household economic activities. They lack authority to the resources \nand power to decision-making in major household and other economic activities. However, with the appreciation for \neducation for women and changing socioeconomic realities, especially due to the increased number of women \nheading households, as a consequence to loss of male members, the role of women in economic activities is slowly \nbeginning to be recognized. The role of the women in the project area is mostly limited to household activities as \nmothers and housewives, and helping the family in farming activities. They are also seen traveling 1\u20132 km distances \nto local markets to purchase households items, collect drinking water from wells or rivers, and collect wood or fuel. \nThe women in the project influence area are also engaged in carpet making.

The \nProject will provide benefits to women in the form of reduced travel times and transport costs, resulting in more cash \nincome  for  the  household.  Although,  women  will  not  benefit  from  employment  opportunities  working  on  the \nconstruction of the highway, but with increased transportation facilities women and children will find it easier to reach \nschools, clinics, hospitals, markets, and if needed to district and provincial capitals. \n \n ", "Appendix 11  63\n \nHas an output been prepared?

Project Description and Impacts \n \n1.  The road section, from Mazar-e-Sharif (kilometer [km] 0.00) to Dar I Suf (km 140.30) \nis located in the two provinces of Balkh and Samanyan, while the section from Yakawlang \n(km 0.00) to Bamian (km 98.90) traverses only through Bamian province. The first 78 km \nroad section from Mazar-e-Sharif to Pul-e-Baraq passes mostly through flat terrain while the \nremaining portion until Dar I Suf is mostly mountainous. The road section from Yakawlang to \nBamian is mostly rolling and mountainous. The Project envisages improving the existing \nroad to a well-designed, paved two-lane highway; and building bridges, culverts, and other \nstructures for safe passage of traffic along the road. \n \n2.  Most of the road improvement work will be carried out within the existing right-of-way, \nexcept for a narrow strip of agricultural land. The study covered a 15 meter (m) width \nrequired to establish a corridor of impact.1 All the structures and land within this width were \nexamined and a census of the people affected by the Project and an assets inventory were \ncarried out. In addition, a poverty and social assessment (based on a socioeconomic survey \nsimultaneous with the census and assets inventory) and public consultations were carried \nout along the project road. While finalizing the road alignment, efforts were made to adopt \nappropriate  engineering  designs  to  minimize  resettlement  impacts.  To  minimize \ndisplacement  and  reduce  disruption  of  livelihoods,  one-side  widening  in  village  and \ncongested sections and a 1.2 km bypass is proposed at Sholgara bazaar (Mazar-e-Sharif to \nDara-i-Suf road section) to avoid nearly 398 small shops/businesses. The resettlement plan \naddresses the impact and outlines the measures, including resettlement of people affected \nin accordance with the involuntary resettlement policy of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB).2 The Ministry of Public Works (MPW) will be the Executing Agency for the Project.  \n \nB.  Objectives of the Resettlement Plan \n \n3.  This resettlement plan is designed to address adverse impacts of the Project. It \nprovides  an  analysis  of  the  impacts,  identifies  the  nature  and  types  of  losses,  and \nestablishes an entitlement matrix as a guide to payments of compensation and resettlement \nbenefits.  It  also  contains  a  budget,  institutional  arrangement  for  implementing  the \nresettlement plan, implementation framework, and monitoring arrangements.  \nC.  Surveys and Data Analysis  \n \n4.  Results of the investigations, surveys, and the social impacts are presented in Table \nA12.1. Overall, the land acquisition and resettlement impact for the Project will be significant \naffecting 2,583 households and 21,517 people.  \n \nTable A12.1: Project Impacts on Households and People \nMazar-e- Sharif to Dara-I  Total Affected \nType of Impact  Suf  Yakawlang to Bamian \n  Households  People  Households  People  Households  People\nLoss of agricultural land/owners  992  8,928  523  3,707  1,515  12,635\nLoss of residential land and  396  15  135  59 \n44  531 \nstructure/owners  \nLoss of commercial land and  140  420  1  9  141  429 \n                                                 \n1  The corridor of impact is the width required for the actual road construction, including the new pavement, \nfootpaths, shoulders, support slopes, embankments, drainage, and necessary safety zones.

About   \n4,000 ordinary wood trees are used for fuel. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n5.  The total land requirement for the Project is estimated to be 212.6 hectares (ha), of \nwhich 162 ha is barren unproductive (government-owned) land and the remaining (50.6 ha) \nis privately owned agricultural land. Although most of the improvement works will be carried \nout  within  the  existing  right-of-way,  a  narrow strip  of  agricultural  land  will  be acquired \naffecting about 1,515 households who will lose a portion of their total agricultural landholding \nand 4,000 wood trees. Nearly 47% of the agricultural households own less than 0.4047 \nhectare of land, 31% own 1 acre, and the remaining 22% own 0.6 hectare. On average, the \nhouseholds will lose 0.028\u20130.008 hectare of agricultural land. All the 1,515 households \nlosing agricultural land are titleholders, while about 785 leaseholders/sharecroppers are \ncultivating their land. The agricultural landowners did not have any legal document to prove \ntheir ownership, however consultation with the district offices revealed that the prolonged \nwar situation in the country destroyed the land records but the titleholder/owners can be \nverified by the community people, government officials, and the political leaders of the area.  \n \n6.  Nearly 59 households will lose a portion of their residential structure (primarily walls \nand gardens), of which only 8 households will require relocation and the remaining can \nrebuild their residences on the existing land. Adequate land is available in the villages of Sar \nAsya  and  Taiboti  for  these  8  households  to  relocate.  All  the  households  losing  their \nresidential structure were titleholders. Most of the residential structures (52) are mud houses \nwith  thatched  roofs,  while  the  remaining  7  are  temporary  structures/tents.  About  141 \nhouseholds operating roadside shops/small businesses will be affected with the majority \nlosing their extended sections and can push back within their own land; 23 households will \nrequire relocation. Adequate land is available on the existing right-of-way for these 23 \nshops/households to relocate. The majority (136) of the shops are semipermanent in nature. \nAmong  the  141  households  about  83  are  tenants.  No  common  property  resources  or \nreligious structures will be affected, but 110 employees will suffer temporary income losses. \nApart from these losses nearly 8 km of irrigation channels will be affected due to acquisition \nof agricultural land; they can be diverted and rebuilt. \n \n7.  In  terms  of  the  occupational  profile  of  the  affected  households,  68%  work  in \nagriculture, 7% as wage earners, 12% in business, and the remaining are engaged in other \nallied agricultural activities. The average household size of affected households is nine. \nAmong the affected households, 27% had an annual income of less than $500, 50% had an \nannual income between $501 and $800, and the remaining had between $801 and $1,100. \nAbout 774 households can be considered as poor, i.e., living below the poverty line, and of \nthese, 155 are households headed by women. In Afghanistan, the main ethnic groups are \nAimaqs, Pushtoons, Tajik, Turkoman, and Uzbek. Nearly 62% of the affected households \nare Hazaras, 15% are Sadat, 14% are Pushtoons, 8% are Uzbeks, and 1% are Tajiks. All \nthese ethnic groups speak their own language and coexist in the same village. The social \nassessment did not identify any differential impacts among these ethnic groups, as all will \nbenefit equally in terms of access to social and economic services by the improved road.  \n ", "66  Appendix 12 \nD.  Gender issues \n \n8.  The women of the affected families are generally housewives. Gender is a mute \nissue in the project area, that is, nobody discusses it. The women\u2019s role is mostly limited to \nhousehold  activities  as  mothers  and  housewives  and  helping  the  family  with  farming \nactivities.  The  road  improvement  will  facilitate  the  revival  of  the  carpet  and  handicraft \nindustry, thus allowing women to increase their income-earning capacities. The Project will \nprovide benefits to women in the form of reduced travel times and transport costs, resulting \nin more cash income for the household. Although women will not benefit from employment \nopportunities working on construction of the highway, with increased transportation facilities \nwomen and children will more easily reach schools, clinics, hospitals, markets, and if needed \ndistrict and provincial capitals. The Project will adversely affect 401 households headed by \nwomen, of which 390 will lose agricultural land, 6 will lose a residential structure, and 5 will \nlose their shops. \n \nE.  Compensation and Relocation Options \n \n9.  All the affected households opted for cash compensation at market/replacement \nvalue.  The  8  households  losing  residential  structures  and  23  losing  shops  (having  to \nrelocate) also opted for self relocation and wanted compensation to be paid at replacement \nvalue. In terms of livelihood losses of the agricultural households, shop owners, employees, \nand sharecroppers will be transitional in nature as the majority will be able to reestablish in \nthe same location. Similarly the tenants can continue to live in the existing premises. Thus \nthe affected households will be supported for their livelihood losses during the transitional \nphase, and provided with rental assistance and shifting assistance for transportation of the \nsalvageable materials. All land acquisition payments and assistance will be paid to those \naffected at least 3 month\u2019s prior to relocation and will be completed before possession of \nland and other assets. \n \nF.  Policy Framework and Entitlement Matrix \n  \n10.  The  policy  framework  is  based  on  laws  and  practices  of  the  Government  of \nAfghanistan  and  ADB  requirements.  The  resettlement  entitlement  matrix  (Table  A12.2) \nrecognizes different types of losses associated with dislocation and resettlement. These \ninclude the loss of agricultural land, and residential and commercial structures. The land \nacquisition at the identified places will be carried out based on the Land Acquisition Law of \nAfghanistan  (2000).  As  per  the  current  practice,  the  compensation  is  provided  as  per \ngovernment rate determined by the legally constituted committee. If land and property is \nacquired, the owner receives the (i) value of the land, (ii) value of residential houses and \nbuildings, and (iii) value of trees and orchards and other assets on the land. The act also \nstates that the person who loses a residential land plot will receive a new plot of land of the \nsame value. If they wish they can get a residence or house on government property in \nexchange under proper procedures. Thus, under the existing land acquisition law when \nprivate landholdings are acquired for public purposes, compensation is paid to the owner \nbased on the category and location of the land, and the value of land for compensation is \ndetermined by the Council of Ministers. The decision is based on the recommendation of a \ncommittee consisting of the following (i) the landlord or person who uses the land or their \nrepresentatives, (ii) official representative of the agency that needs to acquire the land (e.g., \nMinistry of Public Works), (iii) representative of the local municipality, (iv) representative of \nthe Ministry of Finance, and (v) representative of the Ministry of Justice. The land acquisition \nprocess is initiated with the constitution of the committee. As land is acquired for a public \npurpose,  the  law  apparently  does  not  entertain  any  objection  to  the  acquisition  of  an \nindividual\u2019s property. However, if any dissatisfaction arises with the acquisition, which mostly \nrelates to the value of compensation, the committee inquires into the matter and arrives at a \nsolution. The whole process is based on a negotiated approach and as the affected person \n ", "Appendix 12  67\nis also a member of this legally constituted committee, a consensus is reached on the \nreplacement value of the land and assets lost. The committee thus also performs the tasks \nof a grievance redress committee. Once the value of a piece of land to be acquired is \nsuccessfully negotiated, the land acquisition process is completed within 3 months. As part \nof the survey, an assessment was also carried out on the present market price of land. \nHowever, the market for land sale and purchase in the rural areas is limited and most \naffected households or the shop owners do not know the present market price.  \n \n11.  People affected will receive replacement value for the property and other physical \nassets, based on the assessment of the legally constituted committee for land acquisition \nand valuation of the structures. Those affected will be allowed to salvage whatever material \nis useful after demolition to rebuild their structures. In the case of agricultural land, the \naffected farmers will be given an appropriate time frame to harvest the standing crops (if \nany)  or  be  compensated  for  the  crop  as  per  market  value.  The  households  requiring \nrelocation will be assisted by the government in identifying alternate land for relocation and \nbe provided basic facilities in the new site if required. If the people are not able to establish \nthe title of the land or the structure they are utilizing, those affected identified at the time of \nthe census will be legally noticed as the occupiers of the land or structure and considered for \ncompensation and assistance under this Project.  \n \nTable A12.2: Resettlement Entitlement Matrix \n \nItem  Application  Definition of  Entitlement  Expected \nAffected People  Results \n \nLoss of  Land affected  Owner(s): a person  (cid:131)  Cash compensation at  Compensation \nagricultural land  by right-of-way  with ownership  replacement/market value  for lost land  \n(ROW)  certificate of land  (cid:131)  All fees, taxes, and other charges, \n  as applicable under relevant laws \nOwner(s): a person  incurred in the relocation and \nwithout ownership  resource establishment are to be \ncertificate but  borne by the Project \nidentified by the  (cid:131)  Transitional allowance for \ncensus  livelihood losses at AF2,500 for 3 \nmonths \nLoss of crops  Standing crops  Owners of crops/  (cid:131)  Advance notice to harvest crops  Compensation \nand trees  on land  sharecroppers  (cid:131)  Grant equal to market value of  for standing \naffected by  crop lost plus cost of replacement  crops and trees \nROW  of seeds for the next season \n(cid:131)  Compensation for trees based on \nmarket price  \nLoss of  Residential  Owner(s) of  (cid:131)  Cash compensation at  Compensation \nresidential land  land and  residential land  replacement/market value for  for lost land and \nand structure   structure on  and structures  residential land and structure  reconstruction of \nROW  without depreciation  structure \n(cid:131)  Right to salvage materials from \nthe demolished structure \n(cid:131)  Shifting assistance of AF2,000 a \n(cid:131)  Lump sum temporary disruption \nallowance of AF2,500 a \nLoss of  Commercial  Owners of  (cid:131)  Cash compensation at  Compensation \ncommercial land  land/ structure  commercial  replacement / market value for  for lost land and \nand structure   on ROW  structure  commercial land and structure  reconstruction of \nwithout depreciation  structure \n(cid:131)  Right to salvage materials from \nthe demolished structure \n(cid:131)  Shifting assistance of AF2,000 a. \n(cid:131)  Transitional allowance for \nlivelihood losses at AF2,500 for 3 \nmonths \n \n ", "68  Appendix 12 \n \nItem  Application  Definition of  Entitlement  Expected \nAffected People  Results \n \nLoss of  Structure on  Renters of structure  (cid:131)  Right to salvage materials from  Shifting charges \nstructure  ROW  the demolished structure  and disruption \n(residential,  (cid:131)  Shifting assistance of AF2,000  allowance as \ncommercial) by  (cid:131)  Lump sum temporary disruption  rental assistance \ntenants   allowance as rental assistance of \nAF2,500 \nLoss of income  Land and  Employees in  (cid:131)  One-time lump sum grant;  Compensation \nby employees  structure on  shops and  minimum one month\u2019s income  for lost income \nand  ROW  sharecroppers  assessed on a case-to-case \nsharecroppers   basis.  \n \nSpecial  Land/  People affected  (cid:131)  Lump sum assistance of AF2,500  Additional \nAssistance to  structures on  living below poverty  for 1 month  income \nvulnerable  ROW  line and WHH  (cid:131)  Employment in construction  restoration \ngroups  activities  assistance \nImpacts on  Land on ROW  Households losing  (cid:131)  Project will ensure that irrigation  Restoration of \nirrigation  agricultural land  channels are diverted and  irrigation \nchannels  and irrigation  reclaimed to previous standard  channels \nchannels \nOther  Unforeseen impacts will be documented and mitigated based on the principles agreed in this \nunanticipated  resettlement plan \nimpacts \na This will be paid to owners who are also occupiers of the structure. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \nG.  Consultation Meetings, Stakeholder Participation, and Grievance Redress \n \n12.  The project development and activities were discussed with the local communities \nduring the consultation meetings at various project locations. The discussions were held with \nall the primary and secondary stakeholders including the local administration and land asset \nagriculture department, and with various other international and local agencies involved with \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction  in  Afghanistan.  The  directly  affected  populations  were \nconsulted  to  understand  their  concerns  regarding  the  road  construction  and  gather \nsuggestions on the types of mitigation measures that should be considered to address the \nenvisaged impacts. The consultations and discussions with the project-affected people will \nbe  a  continuing  activity  throughout  the  implementation  stage  of  the  Project.  During \nimplementation, MPW will be assisted in conducting the consultations by the nongovernment \norganization (NGO) that will be contracted for resettlement plan implementation. A summary \nof the resettlement plan and entitlement matrix will be translated into the local language \n(Dari) and disclosed to those affected and made available in local MPW offices, Afghanistan \nResident Mission, and ADB website. The NGO will keep the people affected informed about \nthe impacts, compensation, and assistance proposed for them; and facilitate addressing any \ngrievances. Those affected will participate in all the decisions and implementation of the \nresettlement plan. They will be involved in the grievance redress committee to review and \nresolve any dispute concerning compensation and other resettlement benefits. Finally, on-\nsite  consultation  will  be  continuous  during  project  implementation  to  ensure  that  those \naffected receive their due entitlements/benefits. \n \nH.  Implementation Responsibilities and Cost Estimates \n \n13.  MPW, through the two project implementation units (PIUs) will be responsible for \nimplementation of the resettlement plan. Each PIU will be headed by a project manager and \nan NGO will be appointed to implement the resettlement plan. Two officers deputed to the \nPIU  from  MPW  or  Land  Assets  of  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  will  act  as  the  social \ndevelopment officers (SDO) and monitor resettlement plan implementation. The supervision \nconsultants will also provide one international resettlement specialist and two domestic \n ", "Appendix 12  69\nresettlement specialists to assist the SDOs. The SDOs, PIU officials, and NGO staff will \nundergo 1 week of training on ADB\u2019s policy on resettlement, and resettlement management \nand implementation provided by the international resettlement specialist. The appointed \nNGO will generally be located at the project road sites for carrying out implementation of the \nresettlement  plan.  In  Afghanistan,  finding  NGOs  with  prior  experience  in  handling \nresettlement issues is difficult; however a large number of NGOs working in the education, \nhealth, and other infrastructure sectors can be trained adequately to assist the PIUs in \nresettlement implementation. The resettlement implementation will commence from the end \nof 2007 and be completed by the last quarter of 2008. Since the Project will be implemented \nthrough a design and build contract, the international resettlement specialist supported by \nthe domestic resettlement specialists will be responsible for assisting the PIUs in updating \nthe resettlement plan based on detailed design and submit it to ADB for approval. \n \n14.  Due to the prolonged war situation in Afghanistan and poor land record system, a \nland management committee will be formed at the central level and will include members \nfrom the Supreme Court, MPW, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Energy and Water, and the \nGeology and Cartography Department. The primary task of the committee will be to resolve \nissues related to land records and ownership. Following loan negotiations, a grievance \nredress committee will be constituted for each district, comprising (i) a representative of \nthose affected, (ii) a representative of the local administration (the chief administrator from \nthe office of the governor), (iii) a representative from MPW, and (iv) a representative from the \nlocal legal department. The grievance, if any, will be put forward to this committee and a \ndecision should be taken within 7\u201310 working days. In the case of the absence of any of the \nmembers during the decision-making process, an appropriate candidate will be nominated \nby the original representative. This is only to hasten the process of decision-making and \nfacilitate the civil works. Presently the appeal mechanism available in rural areas includes \nthe district commissioner and the district police chief, who in case of complaints by the \npeople  resolves  such  conflicting  issues  through  individual  and  local  consultations.  The \nproposed  grievance  redress  committee  includes  a  representative  from  the  local \nadministration  and  the  affected  individual.  Therefore,  grievances  are  expected  to  be \nredressed locally within the existing framework. \n \n15.  This is the first project to involve land acquisition. Consultations were carried out with \nthe deputy minister, Land Assets, Ministry of Agriculture, and local officials to identify the \ntime frame and method of assessment of compensation for land and assets. Discussions \nrevealed that land acquisition will take less time in rural areas. Since the country has no \nsimilar experience with regard to assessing and paying compensation at replacement rate in \nrural areas, where the market for land is minimal, the ministry and local officials confirmed \nthat the method of assessment is based on a negotiated approach as is the case between a \nwilling seller and willing buyer.  \n \n16.  The  estimated  cost  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  $2.0  million.  The \nGovernment will finance the land acquisition of $1.0 million and ADB the resettlement cost of \n$1.0 million. The unit values of compensation and assistance were calculated based on the \ninformation gathered during the social surveys from the local administration officials and the \nproject-affected  community.  MPW  will  provide  the  entire  fund  for  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement activities. The PIUs will ensure that resettlement budgets are delivered on time \nto the implementing NGO for timely implementation of the resettlement plan. Individual \nentitlements on a household basis will be processed by the NGO based on confirmed \ncensus/SES data. Each entitled person will receive an identity card. All land acquisition \npayments  and  assistances  will  be  paid  to  those  affected  at  least  3  month\u2019s  prior  to \nrelocation, and  will  be  completed  before  possession  of land  and other  assets  prior  to \ncommencement of civil works. \n \n ", "70  Appendix 12 \nI.  Monitoring Arrangements \n \n17.  MPW will supervise and monitor implementation of the resettlement plan internally \nthrough the SDOs in the PIUs supported by the resettlement specialist from the supervision \nconsultants. The SDOs will report to ADB on a quarterly basis during implementation of the \nresettlement plan. The monitoring report will deal with all aspects of relocation, resettlement, \nand rehabilitation of the households. The NGO implementing the resettlement plan will \nconduct field monitoring on a monthly basis, assess progress in the field; and prepare the \nmonthly report for the SDOs. An external monitor will be engaged by MPW to submit \nbiannual reports and provide feedback on resettlement plan implementation to both MPW \nand ADB. External monitors will be hired by MPW with ADB concurrence within 3 months \nafter loan approval. A set of monitoring indicators and terms of reference for the external \nevaluation agency has been developed and included in the resettlement plan. \n \n \n ", "Appendix 13  71\nSUMMARY OF ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The  road  components  of  the  Project  comprise  improvement  to  two  sections  of  the \nMazar-e-Sharif  and  Bamian/Panjab  road:  between  Mazar-e-Sharif\u2013Dara-i-Suf,  and  between \nBamian\u2013Yakawlang. Except for the 17 kilometer (km) section between Mazar-e-Sharif and Kota \nBaraq, the surface of the existing road is earth or gravel, is in poor condition, and requires \nreconstruction. \n \n2.  The  analysis  used  the  highway  design  and  maintenance  model  (HDM4)  with \nmodification  for  conditions  in  Afghanistan.  Data  under  the  same  conditions  in  neighboring \ncountries  were  adopted  for  unavailable  input  data.  Economic  evaluation  was  made  by \ncomparing two cases of with and without the Project, which are defined as follows: \n \n(i)  Without the Project. The without-project scenario leaves all planned alignments \nin  the  current  construction  status,  requiring  only  routine  and  periodic \nmaintenance. No capital investment costs are involved. Gravel roads will have \nroutine and limited periodic maintenance (grading and spot regraveling) of the \ngravel roads. Paved roads will have routine and periodic maintenance in the form \nof patching and sealing.  \n \n(ii)  With the Project. The with-project case will construct two-lane paved road over \nthe whole stretch of the sections and reconstruct the 17 km of paved road. The \nroad will have two types of treatments: (i) construction of asphalt-concrete road, \nand (ii) maintenance of the paved road in the form of patching, sealing, and \noverlay  in  accordance  with  road  deterioration,  and  routine  maintenance.  In \naddition,  gravel  roads  will  have  maintenance  before  upgrading  to  asphalt-\nconcrete. \n \n3.  The project road was evaluated up to and including 2027. The improved road will reduce \noperating costs and travel time, which will lead to a stimulus to economic growth in the project \narea. All benefits and costs are expressed in 2006 constant prices. \n \nB.  Traffic Demand \n \n1.  Existing Traffic \n \n4.  Classified traffic volumes on the project road are estimated based on traffic surveys \nundertaken in 2005, which was adjusted to the average daily traffic, and those resulting from the \ntransport network model developed under the draft transport master plan (Table A13.1). \n \n ", "72  Appendix 13 \nTable A13.1: Traffic on the Project Road in 2005 \n \nBamian\u2013\nSection  Mazar-e-Sharif\u2013Dara-i-Suf \nYakawlang \nMazar-e-Sharif\u2013Kota  Kota Baraq\u2013Pul-e- Pul-e-Baraq\u2013Dara-\nSubsection   \nBaraq  Baraq  i-Suf \nAverage \ndaily traffic  2,015  1,010  640  266 \n(veh/day) \nSources: Consultants and the draft transport master plan. \n \n2.  Traffic Growth Rate \n \n5.  Different economic growth rates are assumed by road influence area based on distinct \nsocioeconomic characteristics in accordance with the draft road master plan, which is much \nmore conservative than the optimistic scenario set out in Securing Afghanistan Future, and is \nonly a little higher than the scenario set out in Putting Afghanistan\u2019s Future at Risk. The demand \nelasticity for the 2005\u20132015 is assumed at 1.2, which is a conservative estimate, based on \nestimates from traffic and gross domestic product growth trends in other developing countries. \nBecause  little  information  is  available  and  the  expectation  that  the  economy  will  expand \nsignificantly, a single elasticity is assumed for all types of vehicles. Table A13.2 summarizes the \nestimated economic and traffic growth rates for 20052015.  \n \nTable A13.2: Estimated Traffic Growth Rates \n \nBamian\u2013\nSection  Mazar-e-Sharif\u2013Dara-i-Suf \nYakawlang \nMazar-e-Sharif\u2013Kota  Kota Baraq\u2013Pul-e- Pul-e-Baraq\u2013\nSubsection   \nBaraq  Baraq  Dara-i-Suf \nEconomic Growth \n6.9  5.1  5.1  6.9 \nRate (%) \nTraffic Growth \n8.3  6.1  6.1  8.3 \nRate (%) \nSources: Consultants and the draft transport master plan. \n \n6.  During construction, the growth rates are assumed to be reduced by 50%. For traffic \nforecasts beyond 2015, the traffic growth rates are assumed to be reduced by 25% during \n2015\u20132025, and a further 25% after 2025. \n \n3.  Traffic Diversion \n \n7.  Assuming the completion of the east\u2013west corridor and the southern half of the north\u2013\nsouth highway, traffic may be diverted from the ring road. The analysis assumes that 5% of the \nring-road traffic will be diverted to the project road based on the traffic modeling of the draft road \nmaster plan. \n \n8.  Another potential diversion is the shift of existing traffic of the Mazar-e-Sharif\u2013Dara-i-Suf \nsection to the provincial road between Dara-i-Suf and Aybak, which is in very bad condition, \nincluding seasonal closure. The provincial road is likely to be taken up for development in the \nvery near future as it is one of the highest priority provincial roads. Based on the road master \nplan modeling, 40% of the traffic observed in 2005 between the Pul-e-Baraq\u2013Dara-i-Suf section \nis assumed to be diverted to the Dara-i-Suf\u2013Aybak section. \n ", "Appendix 13  73\n4.  Generated and Induced Traffic \n \n9.  The increase of traffic generated by the road improvement is assumed to be 20% for the \nKota Baraq\u2013Pul-e-Baraq section, 25% for the Pul-e-Baraq\u2013Dara-i-Suf section, and 50% for the \nBamian\u2013Yakawlang  section.  The  latter  assumes  the  higher  increase  to  generated  traffic \nbecause the condition of the existing road is very bad with seasonal closure. The analysis \nassumes no generated traffic for the Mazar-e-Sharif\u2013Kota Baraq section.  \n \n10.  Dara-i-Suf and Bamian areas have large quantities of natural resources (coal and iron \nore) and solid plans for substantial expansion of coal mining and establishment of a large-scale \ncement plant as well as a power plant in the Dara-i-Suf area. The developments are assumed to \ncreate an urban center in Dara-i-Suf with a population of about 40,000. The resulting passenger \nand goods traffic relating to that as estimated by the road master plan traffic model are added. \n \n11.  Development of the east\u2013west corridor, including the Bamian and Yakawlang section, \nwill be substantial. The draft road master plan traffic modeling shows the substantial increase of \nthe traffic along the east\u2013west corridor due to the expected development along the corridor. The \ngovernments of Italy and Japan are providing financing to develop the section between Kabul \nand Bamian, which will substantially generate traffic on the project road section. \n \n5.  Summary of Traffic Forecast \n \n12.  Table A13.3 summarizes the estimated traffic forecast. The estimate for all sections \nunder this feasibility study is consistent with the ones estimated under the draft road master \nplan study for 2015. \n \nTable A13.3: Traffic Forecast \n \nSection  Mazar-e-Sharif\u2013Dara-i-Suf  Bamian\u2013Yakawlang \nSubsection  Mazar-e-Sharif\u2013 Kota Baraq\u2013Pul-e- Pul-e-Baraq\u2013Dara-  \nKota Baraq  Baraq  i-Suf \n2005a  1,759  754  384  266 \n2011b  2,245  903  460  339 \n2015  3,884  2,467  1,831  2,450 \n2025  7,100  3,850  2,860  4,480 \n2030  8,910  4,550  3,380  5,620 \na  Adjusted base year traffic. \nb  Opening year traffic. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n13.

Costs \n \n14.  The Project\u2019s economic costs were derived from the financial costs and include the cost \nfor construction and maintenance. Economic costs exclude price contingencies, taxes, and \nduties. Afghanistan currently does not apply any taxes other than import duties. The foreign \nexchange rate does not have any significant distortions. Based on this, a conversion factor of \n0.95 is used to convert the financial cost of nontradables to economic costs. A residual value is \nassumed  to  be  10%\u201330%  with  a  higher  residual  value  assumed  where  more \ncutting/mountainous sections are involved. \n \nD.  Benefits \n \n15.  The main quantifiable benefits of the investment are (i) savings in vehicle operating \ncosts and (ii) savings in travel time. Vehicle operating cost savings were calculated using the \nhighway design and maintenance model for each vehicle type. All the input data is based on \nrecent road feasibility studies in Afghanistan. The benefits for generated traffic are considered to \nbe 50% of those for normal traffic. \n \nE.   Economic Internal Rate of Return  \n \n16.  An economic evaluation was undertaken by section. The maintenance standard for the \nwithout-project case is (i) patching and sealing grading for the asphalt-concrete road (Mazar-e-\nSharif\u2013Kota  Baraq)  to  keep  the  surface  condition  at  the  minimum  level  of  international \nroughness index (IRI) of 8 m/km and spot graveling every year for gravel roads to keep the \nsurface condition at the minimum level of an IRI of 20. For the with-project case, overlay is \nconduced when the surface roughness of the road reaches an IRI of 5 m/km. \n \n17.  The annual benefit and cost streams for the Mazar-e-Sharif\u2013Dara-i-Suf section and the \nBamian\u2013Yakawlang section are summarized in tables A13.5 and A13.6. The calculation of the \neconomic internal rate of return results in 29.8% for the Mazar-e-Sharif\u2013Dara-i-Suf section and \n20.7% for the Bamian\u2013Yakawlang section. \n \n ", "Appendix 13  75\nTable A13.5: Calculation of the Economic Internal Rate of Return  \nfor the Mazar-e-Sharif\u2013Dara-i-Suf Section \n($ million) \n \nYear  Costs  Benefitsa  Net Benefits \n  Capitalb  Recurrent  VOC Saving  Time Saving   \n2007  6.00  (0.12)  0.00  0.00  (5.88) \n2008  18.01  (0.41)  0.04  0.00  (17.56) \n2009  24.02  (0.11)  4.97  0.34  (18.60) \n2010  12.01  0.04  7.31  0.50  (4.24) \n2011  0.00  0.03  7.91  0.54  8.41 \n2012  0.00  0.19  18.81  1.04  19.66 \n2013  0.00  0.11  22.82  1.37  24.09 \n2014  0.00  0.19  24.09  1.50  25.40 \n2015  0.00  0.10  24.99  1.60  26.50 \n2016  0.00  0.12  25.72  1.69  27.29 \n2017  0.00  1.00  26.43  1.78  27.22 \n2018  0.00  0.95  27.14  1.87  28.07 \n2019  0.00  1.64  27.86  1.97  28.19 \n2020  0.00  1.43  28.56  2.07  29.20 \n2021  (2.37)  1.42  29.30  2.18  32.43 \n2022  3.14  0.87  28.95  2.15  27.09 \n2023  3.21  0.31  31.07  2.25  29.80 \n2024  0.00  0.31  34.34  2.36  36.39 \n2025  0.00  0.31  35.26  2.44  37.39 \n2026  0.00  0.31  37.55  2.65  39.90 \n2027  0.00  0.31  36.89  2.60  39.19 \n2028  (12.01)  0.31  37.61  2.69  51.19 \n      Internal Rate of Return  29.8 \n    Net Present Value  79.68 \n( ) = negative, VOC = vehicle operating cost. \na  Savings are realized due to the difference in maintenance timing required between the with- and \nwithout-project cases. \nb  Including the savings of generated traffic. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nTable A13.6: Calculation of the Economic Internal Rate of Return  \nfor the Bamian\u2013Yakawlang Section \n($ million) \n \nYear  Costs  Benefits  Net Benefits \n  Capital   Recurrent   MT VOC  MT Time    \n2007  5.32  (0.09)  0.00  0.00  (5.23) \n2008  15.95  (0.10)  (0.01)  0.00  (15.86) \n2009  15.95  (0.11)  (0.03)  0.00  (15.87) \n2010  15.95  0.17  7.05  0.44  (8.63) \n2011  0.00  0.28  8.50  0.58  8.80 \n2012  0.00  0.28  10.81  0.81  11.34 \n2013  0.00  0.28  11.58  0.89  12.19 \n2014  0.00  0.28  12.16  0.95  12.83 \n2015  0.00  0.28  12.64  1.00  13.36 \n ", "76  Appendix 13 \n \nYear  Costs  Benefits  Net Benefits \n  Capital   Recurrent   MT VOC  MT Time   \n2016  0.00  0.28  13.12  1.05  13.89 \n2017  0.00  0.28  13.59  1.11  14.41 \n2018  0.00  1.42  14.05  1.16  13.79 \n2019  0.00  0.28  14.48  1.22  15.42 \n2020  0.00  1.42  14.93  1.27  14.79 \n2021  0.00  1.28  16.73  1.48  16.94 \n2022  0.00  1.28  15.71  1.38  15.82 \n2023  0.00  1.27  16.11  1.44  16.28 \n2024  5.75  0.28  16.41  1.49  11.88 \n2025  0.00  0.28  19.87  1.59  21.18 \n2026  0.00  0.28  20.56  1.65  21.93 \n2027  (10.63)  0.28  21.26  1.71  33.32 \n    Internal Rate of Return  20.7 \n    Net Present Value  29.30  \n( ) = negative \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF.
