Yet \nreforms in many areas are only partial, poverty is still high at over 20%, \nand  social  indicators  lag  behind  those  in  comparable  low-income \ncountries.   \n \nThe government of Punjab (GoPb) has laid down an ambitious Vision \n2020 aimed at doubling per capita income over the next decade. This \nwill  require  sustained  broad-based  economic  growth,  which  in  turn \ndemands large efficiency improvements in both the private and the \npublic sectors, accompanied by better public resource management. \nThrough  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)\u2013supported  Punjab \nResource  Management  Program  (PRMP),  implemented  during \nNovember 2003\u2013August 2007, the GoPb has introduced wide-ranging \nreforms in public resource management. It has enhanced revenues, \nrationalized  expenditures,  improved  planning  and  budgeting,  and \ndeveloped the private sector and the civil service. In parallel, the GoPb \n ", "ii   \nhas also implemented reforms in service delivery, through the ADB-\nsupported Punjab Devolved Social Services Program (PDSSP), and in \nthe judiciary, through the Access to Justice Program (AJP). \n \nHaving laid down a broad foundation for reforms through these three \nmajor ADB interventions, and support from other development partners \nin  the  governance,  education,  and  infrastructure  sectors,  the  GoPb \nlaunched  its  second-generation  reforms  at  the  fourth  Punjab \nDevelopment  Forum  in  April  2007.  These  reforms  are  centered  on \ncreating  an  effective  public  sector  and  fostering  a  dynamic  private \nsector to achieve the Vision 2020 goals.  \n \nThe key pillars of the second-generation reforms are the following: \n  \n(i)  efficient public financial management, to increase the fiscal space \nfor higher pro-poor spending;  \n(ii)  a fully funded and well-governed civil service pension system, to \nsupport prudent fiscal management and ensure retirement income \nsecurity for civil servants; \n(iii)  civil service reforms, for a responsive, efficient, and effective civil \nservice;  \n(iv)  broad  measures  supporting  private  sector  development,  for \neconomic growth, job creation, and poverty reduction;  \n(v)  attainment  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  by \n2015; and  \n(vi)  improved  access  to  justice,  for  greater  legal  and  regulatory \ncertainty and enforceability in all economic spheres. \n \nProgram  Building on the PRMP and other programs, PGEIP will support the \nDescription  GoPb  in  realizing  the  long-term  goals  expressed  in  Vision  2020, \nthrough  which  the  government  has  committed  itself  to  significantly \nimproving the standard of living of the people of Punjab, especially the \npoor and vulnerable. The PGEIP will improve the overall functioning of \nthe provincial, district, and municipal governments and the quality of \npublic services. The improvements will take the following forms:  \n \n(i)  greater performance-oriented planning and budgeting;  \n(ii)  a  more  efficient  civil  service,  with  adequate  incentives  and \nmerit-based appointment and career progression;  \n(iii)  a funded and well-managed pension system, which increases the \nconfidence of civil servants and the public, and generates fiscal \nspace for high-priority investments in the social sectors; and  \n(iv)  greater  private  sector  contribution  to  growth  and  facilitation  of \npublic-private partnerships. \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n ", "    iii\n \n  As reforms in these areas are complex and take time to filter through \nthe  bureaucracy,  PGEIP  will  be  processed  as  a  program  cluster \ncomprising three single-tranche SPs. This modality provides adequate \nflexibility to meet emerging reform needs and use program conditions \ngenuinely for policy reform, rather than as rigid prescriptions. ADB\u2019s \nManagement  and  Board  will  also  have  greater  involvement  in \nrecommending measures for future operations within a cluster, in a way \nthat is not possible in traditional multiple-tranche operations. Separate \nreports and recommendations of the President (RRPs) will be prepared \nfor each subprogram. The policy matrix developed thus far for SP1 has \nindicative actions for SP2 and SP3. In addition, detailed action plans \nwill be developed in combination with policy matrices to guide reforms. \n \nIn order to ensure that all the six pillars of the Vision 2020 are in place, \nthe  GoPb  has  also  sought  ADB\u2019s  support  for  accelerating  the \nattainment of the MDGs and implementation of provincial-level judicial \nreforms, in addition to the government efficiency improvements under \nPGEIP.  \n \nIn line with this request, ADB will also prepare two additional program \nclusters, namely the PMDGP and PAJP, in an integrated manner along \nwith  PGEIP  over  2007\u20132011.  The  integrated  approach  and  the \npreliminary details of the PMDGP and PAJP are presented in Appendix \n3  of  this  RRP.  The  integrated  approach  will  improve  program \ncoordination,  reduce  duplication,  minimize  inconsistency  in  policy \nadvice and measures, and focus resources for desired outcomes. \n \nThe  reforms  under  the  three  program  clusters  will  accelerate  and \nsustain economic growth, improve the delivery of public services, create \nmore employment opportunities, and reduce poverty. \n \nFinancing Plan  GoPb has expressed a strong commitment to accelerating the funding \nof  its  civil  service  pension  system,  so  that  the  annual  pension \nobligations  can  be  made  off-budget  to  the  extent  possible  and  the \nconserved  resources  utilized  for  essential  social  and  infrastructure \ninvestments.  To  translate  this  commitment  to  action,  GoPb  needs \nsignificant resources, for which it has requested financing support over \nthe next 5 years through the PGEIP, PMDGP, and PAJP clusters. In \nparallel,  the  three  clusters  will  also  help  leverage  reforms  in  the \nrespective areas. \n \nFor the PGEIP cluster, three well-sequenced single-tranche loans are \nproposed.  The  PMDGP  and  PAJP  clusters  will  be  processed  and \npresented for Board consideration separately over the course of 2008\u2013\n2011.  \n  \nFor SP1 of PGEIP, a loan of $250 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources  (OCR)  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)\u2013based lending facility. The loan will have a term of \n15 years including a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate to be \n ", "iv   \ndetermined according to ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, and other \nterms and conditions set out in the draft program loan agreement. \n \nThe Government of Pakistan will relend the local currency generated \nfrom the proceeds of the loan to the GoPb, on the same terms and \nconditions as those extended by ADB to the Government. The GoPb \nwill assume the foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk. \n  \nSP2 and SP3 of the PGEIP are also envisaged to involve loans of \n$250 million each, to be reconfirmed by the GoPb and the Government \nof Pakistan in 2008\u20132009 (for SP2) and 2010\u20132011 (for SP3).   \n \nCounterpart Funds  The local currency counterpart funds generated from the OCR loan will \nbe used to capitalize the Pension Fund and the General Provident \nFund, finance the costs of structural adjustments, and increase social \nexpenditure. \n \nPeriod and  SP1 of the PGEIP covers reform measures implemented from June \nTranching  2006 to October 2007. The proceeds of the $250 million loan for the \nsubprogram, withdrawable in a single tranche, will be available after \nloan effectiveness, upon satisfactory attainment of all agreed policy \nactions under SP1. The RRP for the SP2 loan will be submitted for \nBoard consideration about 18\u201320 months after the SP1 loan becomes \neffective, subject to the GoPb\u2019s readiness to continue with its reform \nagenda. Similarly, the RRP for the SP3 will be submitted for Board \nconsideration about 18\u201320 months after SP2 loan becomes effective, \nsubject  to  the  government\u2019s  readiness  to  continue  with  the  reform \nagenda. The period of the PGEIP cluster will be from October 2007 to \nlate 2010 or early 2011, and is expected to close on 30 June 2011.  \n   \nExecuting Agency   For the PGEIP, the Planning and Development Department (P&DD) of \nGoPb will be the Executing Agency (EA).  \n   \nImplementation  A high-level steering committee chaired by the chief secretary of Punjab \nArrangements  and comprising as members, the Planning and Development (P&D) \nchairman,  additional  chief  secretary  Services  and  General \nAdministration Department (S&GAD), finance secretary, secretaries of \nImplementing Agencies (IAs), and at least three representatives of civil \nsociety and the private sector, will guide PGEIP implementation. \n \nThe principal IAs for the PGEIP will be the FD and P&DD for public \nfinancial management; FD for pension reforms; the Public Policy and \nChange Management Wing (PPCMW) of S&GAD, and Management \nand  Professional  Development  Department  (MPDD)  for  civil  service \nreforms;  and  the  Departments  of  Commerce  and  Investment, \nIndustries,  and  Labor  and  Human  Resource  for  private  sector \ndevelopment.  Other  departments  and  agencies,  such  as  the \nDepartment of Health (DOH) and Department of Irrigation and Power \n(DI&P),  may  also  participate  as  IAs  for  the  pilot-testing  of  the \nperformance-based  budgeting  and  human  resource  management \nschemes.   \n ", "    v\n \nAn  executive  committee  under  the  P&D  chairman  and  comprising \nmembers from FD and S&GAD, will ensure the efficient implementation \nof  the  PGEIP.  A  program  management  unit  (PMU),  established  for \nPRMP and in place since 2003, will continue to be the secretariat for \nthe two committees. \n \nProcurement and  The loan proceeds will finance the foreign exchange costs (excluding \nDisbursement  local duties and taxes) of items produced in and procured from ADB\u2019s \nmember countries, excluding ineligible items and imports financed from \nother bilateral and multilateral sources. ADB will have the right to audit \nthe use of the loan proceeds and verify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s \ncertification.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  to  the  Borrower \naccording  to  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and \nRelated Requirements for Program Loans.  \n   \nProgram Benefits  The PGEIP will significantly benefit the people of the Punjab through \nand Beneficiaries  the following:  \n \n(i)  Better  management  of  public  resources  and  more \nperformance-oriented  planning  and  budgeting.  Fiscal \ndiscipline  will  be  effectively  enforced,  resource  flows  and \nperformance outcomes will be better linked, there will be greater \ncoherence  between  policy  priorities  and  development \nexpenditures, and public service delivery will improve, with direct \nbenefit to the poor.  \n(ii)  A financially sustainable and adequate pension system. There \nwill be greater retirement income security for civil servants, and \nfiscal space will be created for pro-poor expenditures. Longer-term \nbenefits  include  the  promotion  of  private  saving  and  asset \naccumulation, which will contribute to economic growth, besides \nfinancial sector development.  \n(iii)  An  efficient  and  effective  civil  service.  Improved  human \nresource management in the civil service will increase value for \nmoney for the province. The efficiency gains will produce benefits \nin  service  delivery  and  private  sector  development.  A  more \nresponsive civil service will also lead to more equitable public \nexpenditures, with benefit to the poor.  \n(iv)  Greater private sector participation. A coherent private sector \ndevelopment strategy and an improved regulatory framework will \nhelp  reduce  the  cost  of  doing  business,  and  result  in  greater \nefficiency, investments, growth, and poverty reduction. Likewise, a \nrobust public-private partnership will mobilize resources for better \nservice delivery. \n \nOverall, PGEIP will result in better public services and broad-based \neconomic  growth.  Key  derivative  benefits  include  employment \ngeneration and poverty reduction.      \n \nAssumption, Risks,  The realization of the benefits of the PGEIP depends on a number of \nand Safeguards  assumptions and is subject to various risks. Mitigating measures have \n ", "vi   \ntherefore been integrated into the design of the Program. \n \nPolitical risks. Pakistan is in an election year and any political changes \ncould  have  major  administrative  consequences.  But  the  risk  of \nreversing the direction of reforms is quite low in the Punjab, given the \nbroad consensus on reforms among the key stakeholders. The flexibility \nbuilt into the single-tranche operations also addresses any uncertainty \nin this regard, as reform actions can be adjusted to suit the emerging \nenvironment as long as the overall development needs are met in an \nefficient manner without significant distortions.  \n \nGovernance  risks.  Reforms  could  be  undermined  or  delayed  by \nvested interests threatened by greater transparency and accountability. \nBut strong ownership and support for the PGEIP at the highest political \nand bureaucratic levels, coupled with gradually improving incentives for \nbetter performance, will help mitigate this risk. Further, the proposed \nprogram design has benefited from broad stakeholder consultation and \nparticipation.  \n \nImplementation  risks.  The  PGEIP  implementation  demands \nconsiderable institutional capacity. Insufficient capacity within the GoPb \nto manage the envisaged reforms could impede implementation. Earlier \nADB support has helped the PMU and the government departments \novercome capacity limitations. In addition, the attached TA loan and TA \ngrants will provide capacity building to ensure reform sustainability.  \n \nExternal  and  macroeconomic  risks.  Despite  geopolitical \nuncertainties, the external environment has been largely favorable to \nPakistan  over  the  past  few  years.  The  country\u2019s  macroeconomic \nindicators in the past 5 years have been strong. But the widening trade \nimbalance and current account deficit, insecurity in the region, and the \ncost of earthquake reconstruction heighten the macroeconomic risks. \nWhile some of the risks are beyond the control of the Government of \nPakistan and the GoPb, prudent economic management can lessen \nmacroeconomic vulnerability.  \n   \nTechnical  A  TA  loan  of  $8.8  million  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nAssistance Loan  resources will be provided to support public resource management and \n  related reforms in the Punjab. The loan will have a term of 32 years \n  including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1% per year \n  during the grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter, and other terms \nand conditions set forth in the TA loan and TA program agreements. \n \nThe TA loan is intended to support the implementation of reforms called \nfor under the PGEIP. Specifically, the TA will support policy advice, \ndiagnostic studies, stakeholder consultations, and capacity building to \nachieve (i) greater performance orientation in planning and budgeting, \n(ii) a financially stable and adequate pension system with improved \nbenefits and wider coverage, (iii) an efficient and effective civil service, \nand  (iv)  a  dynamic  private  sector.  The  TA  loan  will  have  five \ncomponents: (i) fiscal and financial management, (ii) pension reform, \n ", "    vii\n(iii) civil service reform, (iv) private sector development, and (v) reform \nmonitoring and evaluation.  \n \nP&DD will be the EA for the TA loan and various IAs will be responsible \nfor their respective components. The main IAs will be FD, P&DD, DOH, \nand DI&P for component 1; FD for component  2; S&GAD and MPDD \nfor  component  3;  the  Departments  of  Commerce  and  Investment, \nIndustries,  and  Labor  and  Human  Resource  for  component  4;  and \nP&DD for component 5.  \n \nConsultants will be recruited according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). A total of 140 \nperson-months  of  international  and  156  person-months  of  national \nconsultants will be required. \n   \nTechnical  An  advisory  TA  for  $950,000  equivalent  will  support  the  effective \nAssistance Grants  implementation of the PGEIP by improving the interface between line \nagencies in the GoPb. In parallel, it will also help enhance the fiduciary \ngovernance of the Punjab civil service pension system, and initiate civil \nservice reforms as TA loan mobilization takes place over the next 6 \nmonths. A program preparatory TA for $900,000 equivalent will help \nprepare the proposed PMDGP and PAJP outlined in Appendix 3 of this \nRRP. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on: (i) a proposed \nprogram cluster to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Punjab Government Efficiency \nImprovement  Program  (PGEIP)  comprising  three  subprograms;  (ii)  a  proposed  loan  for \nSubprogram 1 of the PGEIP;1 and (iii) a proposed technical assistance (TA) loan for capacity \nbuilding for PGEIP. The report also describes proposed TA for effective implementation of \nPGEIP and for preparation of the Punjab Millennium Development Goals Program (PMDGP) \nand the Punjab Access to Justice Program (PAJP), and if the Board approves the proposed \nPGEIP cluster and loans, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will \napprove the two TAs. \n    \nII.  MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \nA.  Macroeconomic Performance \n2.  The Punjab is the largest provincial economy of Pakistan, accounting for over 50% of the \ncountry\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP). It is also the most populous province, with about \n87 million inhabitants, or 56% of the country\u2019s population. The economic performance of the \nPunjab thus plays a critical role in the overall economic strength of Pakistan. At the same time, \nnational policies have a significant impact on the economic conditions in the Punjab.  \n \n3.  The economy of Pakistan as a whole has experienced a dramatic turnaround since 2001, \nbehind sustained structural reforms. Real GDP grew by an average of 7% over the past 3 years, \na  vast  improvement  over  the  1.8%  rate  in  2001.  Growth  has  been  supported  by  strong \nconsumption and investment, spurred in turn by increased workers\u2019 remittances, among other \nthings. Reflecting its continued commitment to economic growth and poverty reduction, the \nGovernment  of  Pakistan  has  significantly  increased  development  spending,  particularly  in \npro-poor sectors, from 4.8% of GDP in fiscal year (FY) 2005 to 5.6% in FY2006. Prudent debt \nmanagement coupled with strong GDP growth, has led to a significant drop in the ratio of public \ndebt to GDP, from 81.4% in FY2002 to 56.1% in FY2006, and in the ratio of external public debt \nto GDP, from 41.0% to 26.2% over the same period.   \n \n4.  The economy of the Punjab has also staged a major turnaround, from a contraction of \n0.9% in FY2001 to strong growth of 7.1% in FY2006. On the back of such performance, about \n3.5 million new jobs have been created each year since 2004, the poverty head-count ratio has \ndeclined by about 11% since 2002, and key social indicators such as the school enrollment rate \nhave significantly improved. Better fiscal management has also created \u201cfiscal space.\u201d As a \nresult  of  strong  growth  and  greater  fiscal  space,  development  expenditures  increased \nsubstantially in 2003\u20132007 from 0.9% of gross provincial product to 2.2%, while recurrent \nexpenditures dropped from 4.5% to 4% over the same period. This general trend is expected to \ncontinue in the near future,2 with development expenditures growing by 21% yearly, nearly twice \nas fast as recurrent expenditures, which are expected to grow by 11%.3    \n \n                                                 \n1  Appendix 1 presents the Design and Monitoring Framework for PGEIP. \n2  Government of Punjab.

Punjab\u2019s Development Vision, Strategy, and Medium-Term Development Plan  \n5.  Despite strong economic performance, the province is confronted by many challenges \nthat face the country as a whole, including improving the investment climate, making exports \nmore competitive, sustaining economic growth, accelerating social development, and reducing \npoverty.  Poverty  remains  high  in  the  Punjab  and  social  indicators  lag  behind  those  in \ncomparable low-income countries. Furthermore, with the labor force growing at about 3% per \nyear, the creation of more jobs is a major challenge.  \n \n6.  Fully  aware  of  the  development  challenges,  the  government  of  the  Punjab  (GoPb) \nrecognized  early  on  that  an  efficient  public  sector  is  the  key  to  economic  and  social \ntransformation  in  the  Punjab.  It  designed  and  initiated  the  Punjab  Resource  Management \nProgram (PRMP) with Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) support in 2002, focusing on public \nfinancial management and private sector development, among others. Subsequently, in June \n2004 GoPb launched the Punjab Vision 2020, setting out its main development objectives for \nthe next 15 years. Vision 2020 envisages a doubling of per capita income to about $2,000 within \nthat period. The major goal of the Vision 2020 is a dynamic economy with an efficient public \nsector and a productive private sector. It identifies six pillars of reforms: \n \n(i)  improving  fiscal  and  public  financial  management  and  instituting  a \nresults-oriented medium-term planning and budgeting system, \n(ii)  establishing a well-funded and adequate pension system, \n(iii)  fostering an efficient civil service, \n(iv)  fostering  dynamic  private  sector\u2013led  growth  and  public-private  partnerships \n(PPPs),  \n(v)  accomplishing the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and \n(vi)  improving  access  to  justice  to  enhance  legal  and  regulatory  certainty  and \nenforceability in all economic spheres. \n  \n7.  GoPb has been a pioneer in public sector reforms in Pakistan. It has made significant \ncommitments and initiated key reforms in all of the above areas. Yet, given the complexity of \nchange, the Punjab needs major improvements on three fronts: (i) enhancing public sector \nefficiency; (ii) increasing access to, as well as the quality, of public services, most critically in \neducation,  health  and  water  and  sanitation  sectors;  and  (iii)  accelerating  private  sector \nparticipation in the provision of services. Appendix 2 presents a detailed analysis of the principal \nweaknesses  in  these  areas.  The  province  needs  a  large  infusion  of  public  and  private \ninvestments to keep pace with the growth requirements of its economy. With the population \ngrowing at 2.64% per year, Punjab will double its size to over 150 million people by 2026. At \npresent, about 70% of the population is considered as vulnerable (children, women and elderly). \nSignificant urban-rural differentials exist in the availability and quality of public services. Basic \nhealth indicators in the province are poor. Over 40% of villages have no drainage, and only 3% \nof villages have easy access to proper government hospitals. While infant mortality has declined \nfrom above 120 in 1997 to below 75 now, Punjab is still a long way away from its 2015 \nMillennium Development Goal (MDG) target of 40 per 1,000 live births. Likewise, maternal \nmortality remains high at 300 (as of 2004) against a 2015 target of 140 per 100,000 live births. \nWith the growing urban congestion and rural-urban inequalities, Punjab also needs to invest \nmassively in transport, water supply and sanitation and other infrastructure. These cannot be \nmet  by  the  public  sector  alone.  And,  more  importantly,  the  economy  needs  to  grow  at  a \nsustained 7-8% per year to generate adequate jobs to those entering the labor force.  \n \n ", "    3\n8.  The Vision 2020 as well as the current medium-term development strategy of the GoPb \nprovide  for continuing structural  reforms  to  improve  public  sector  efficiency  and  create  an \nenabling environment for the private sector. Public sector efficiency implies (i) the capacity to \nallocate scarce public resources in line with development needs and priorities, and (ii) the \npresence of a modern civil service that will enable the province to achieve its development goals. \nThe key aspects of an enabling environment for the private sector are (i) a well-functioning legal \nand regulatory framework, (ii) an effective social sector that supports the development of human \ncapital, and (iii) infrastructure services that make Punjab more attractive to domestic and foreign \ninvestors.  \n \nC.  Partnership of the Government with the Asian Development Bank \n9.  The partnership for development assistance between the Government of Pakistan and \nADB dates back to over two decades, and spans several sectors. In many instances provincial \ngovernments  have  been  the  direct  recipients  of  that  assistance.4 ADB\u2019s  assistance  to  the \nPunjab has dealt for the most part with (i) public resource management reform, through the \nimplementation  of  two  SPs  under  the  comprehensive  PRMP;  and  (ii)  support  for  local \ngovernments  and  service  delivery  through  the  Punjab  Devolved  Social  Services  Program \n(PDSSP). Punjab has also taken part in federally administered ADB programs like the Access to \nJustice  Program  (AJP)  and  the  Decentralization  Support  Program.  For  a  summary  of \nachievements under AJP and Decentralization Support Program, see Supplementary Appendix \nC. Over time, the PRMP has evolved into the Punjab\u2019s governance flagship program.  As \noutlined in Appendix 2, the PRMP and PDSSP have helped Punjab initiate certain foundational \nreforms under the first four pillars of Vision 2020. GoPb has also implemented other sector \nspecific reform programs in education and irrigation with World Bank support.   \n \n10.  The GoPb launched the Punjab Development Forum (PDF) in 2003 to engage civil \nsociety, the private sector, and development partners in policy dialogue. The PDF is now a \nyearly forum for policy discussions, stakeholder consultation, and information dissemination. \nThe PRMP has provided strong support to the PDF, and ADB has been an active participant in \nthe forum. The fourth PDF, in April 2007, set a series of second-generation reforms in motion, \nwith the identified goal of strengthening the public sector and creating an enabling environment \nfor the private sector. Besides the PDF, the PRMP has also supported regular workshops and \nseminars on policy matters.5 The design of the PGEIP fully incorporates ideas engendered by \nthe PDF, the workshops, and other stakeholder consultation activities.    \n \n11.  ADB\u2019s planned assistance to GoPb is in line with its medium term development agenda. \nGiven the growth challenges as well as the financing requirements, GoPb has sought ADB\u2019s \nsupport for second generational reforms in the first four pillars of Vision 2020 as defined in             \npara. 6. In addition, continuing on the service delivery support through PDSSP, it has also \nrequested ADB for assistance in accelerating the attainment of the MDGs (pillar 5 of Vision \n2020) and in improving access to justice in the province (pillar 6 of Vision 2020). Besides the \noverall reform and development financing requirements, the principal driver on GoPb\u2019s part to \nseek program lending support is the need to fund the Punjab civil service pension system which \nis now financed on a pay-as-you-go basis through annual budgetary allocations, amounting to \nPRs17 billion (approximately $280 million) at present (para. 19 below). In present value terms, \nthe system\u2019s liabilities by 2025 are forecast at PRs400 billion (approximately $6.6 billion). In \n                                                 \n4  For a comprehensive and well-structured assessment of ADB\u2019s country assistance program for Pakistan in 1986\u2013\n2005, see Operations Evaluation Department. 2007. Country Assistance Program Evaluation for Pakistan. Manila.  \n5  For more details, see Supplementary Appendix D. \n ", "4   \norder to meet these reform and financing requirements, an integrated framework is proposed \ncomprising three program clusters. The proposed PGEIP will help implement critical reforms in: \n(i) improving fiscal and financial management, (ii) pensions reform, (iii) civil service reform, and \n(iv) private sector development. In parallel, two separate program clusters will be designed \nseparately.  The  Punjab  MDG  Program,  to  be  designed  and  presented  to  the  Board  for \nconsideration in 2008 for implementation over 2008-2011, will build on the achievements of \nPDSSP and focus on public services delivery particularly in the health sector, and introduce \nviable health financing mechanisms. The Punjab AJP, to be designed in parallel and brought to \nthe Board for consideration in 2008, will build on reforms introduced through the federal AJP \nand focus on deepening judicial reforms at the provincial level, leading to a well-functioning \njudiciary  supported  by  measures  on  alternate  dispute  resolution  mechanisms  and  greater \nenforceability of contracts. This integrated framework is defined in greater detail in Appendix 3. \n  \nIII.  THE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, ISSUES, AND OPPORTUNITIES6 \nA.  Issues and Opportunities with Reference to the Proposed PGEIP    \n1.  Need for More Performance-Oriented Budgeting  \n12.  Background. The experience of countries worldwide has shown that the medium-term \nexpenditure framework (MTEF), which combines a top-down approach to fiscal planning with \nbottom-up  estimates  of  the  current  and  medium-term  costs  of  sector  programs,  can  be  a \nvaluable tool in public expenditure management. The GoPb has made considerable progress \ntoward  adopting  a  medium-term  approach  to  fiscal  planning.  The  PRMP  supported  the \nintroduction of a medium-term budget framework (MTBF) and a medium-term development \nframework (MTDF), with 3-year projections of the aggregate resources for the recurrent and \ndevelopment budgets, respectively. The Finance Department (FD) prepares the MTBF, and the \nPlanning and Development Department (P&DD), the MTDF. But despite the progress made in \nrecent years, fiscal and public financial management in Punjab is still hampered by a number of \nissues.7 \n \n13.  Weak  Budget  Preparation  and  Execution,  and  Poor  Performance  Orientation. \nBudgeting in Punjab is a dual system: the FD prepares and manages the recurrent budget, and \nP&DD, the development budget. Line departments submit their recurrent and development \nexpenditure estimates to FD and P&DD, respectively, which in turn makes the final budget \nallocations. Recurrent budget estimates are based on historical trends, with yearly increments to \ncover  additional  costs.  The  development  budget  consists  of  ongoing  programs  and  new \nprograms that will start in the new fiscal year. A major shortcoming of this incremental and \ninput-oriented approach is that budget allocations hardly reflect sectoral service delivery goals \nand  priorities.  For  lack  of  a  robust  mechanism  for  preparing  budget  estimates,  the  line \ndepartments must often ask the FD for supplementary grants during the fiscal year to augment \ntheir initial budgetary allocations.8 There is no periodic review of recurrent expenditures to \n                                                 \n6   This section should be read in conjunction with Appendix 2.  \n7  A  comprehensive  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability  (PEFA)  assessment  for  the  Punjab  was \ncompleted in April 2007 with the support of ADB, the World Bank, the Department for International Development \n(DFID) of the United Kingdom, and the  European Commission. The main findings of the  assessment are \nsummarized in Appendix 4.  \n8  The need to further improve budget preparation and execution was also underscored in the PEFA assessment, \nwhich gave a rating of \u201cD\u201d to the composition of expenditure outturn versus the original approved budget, meaning \nthat the government is performing below international standards.  \n ", "    5\nidentify opportunities to reallocate resources and increase the efficiency of public spending.9 \nMidyear monitoring of budget execution is limited to assessing whether the expenditures of line \ndepartments conform to the budgeted amounts. Budget performance is not monitored, and \nirregularities  are  not  corrected.  Dual  budgeting  impedes  the  comprehensive  analysis  of \ngovernment operations and the evaluation of their outcomes and results. As brought out in the \npublic expenditure and financial accountability (PEFA) assessment of the audit function (see \nfootnote 7), accountability in the use of public resources needs strengthening. The quality of \ninternal audit was rated substandard (\u201cC\u201d), as audit reports are not prepared regularly and \ninternal audit recommendations are not followed up. The external audit function was also rated \nsubstandard (\u201cD\u201d) because audit reports are submitted late and there is little response to or \nfollow-up of audit observations by the entities concerned. Finally, though legislative scrutiny of \nexternal audit reports is quite extensive and detailed, the examination of these reports is often \nsubstantially delayed (D).  \n \n14.  Low  Value  for  Money  in  Public  Service  Delivery.  Since  devolution,  the  district \ngovernments have been primarily responsible for education and health care, and the tehsil \nmunicipal administration (TMAs) 10  and the union councils, for water supply and sanitation. \nImproved service delivery is a major tenet of devolution.  \n \n15.  However,  service  devolution  has  been  difficult  to  implement  effectively.  A  primary \nconstraint is the mismatch between functional responsibilities and financial resources. Despite \ntheir increased responsibilities, local governments derive their revenues chiefly from taxes with \na  narrow  base  and  buoyancy,11 and  therefore  depend  on  transfers  from  the  federal  and \nprovincial governments. Most local governments are also unable to provide adequate services \nbecause of weak human capital, infrastructure, and facilities, and the lack of incentives to \nprovide good services.  \n \n16.  Limited Integration between Budgeting and Planning. The MTBF and the MTDF \nneed to be combined into a single MTEF, which integrates the top-down resource envelope with \nthe bottom-up sector programs in the annual budget process. However, the MTBF and the \nMTDF as currently implemented in the Punjab represent only the top-down dimension, as they \nare  estimated  entirely  by  central  departments.  Line  departments  in  fact  have  only  limited \ninvolvement  in  determining  the  final  allocation  of  resources  and  expenditure  ceilings.  The \nannual budget and the MTBF differ in format, making it difficult to reconcile the two documents, \nthough the annual budget should be identical to the first year of the MTBF. Budget projections \nare not driven by official costing guidelines or performance targets, and are not based on the \nbudget ceilings defined for individual departments. In the case of the recurrent budget, the FD \ngives  an  informal  indication  of  the  likely  allowable  increase,  while  in  the  case  of  the \ndevelopment  budget,  much  of  the annual  development  program  is  already  known,  as  this \ncomprises expenditure on ongoing projects and on projects that will start in the new budget year \nand that have already been approved and prioritized. As a result, there is no robust link between \n                                                 \n9  When a development project is completed, its recurrent expenditures are treated as new expenditure on the \nrecurrent budget for 3 years before being absorbed into the regular budget, if their continuation is still justified. In \npractice, however, periodic review of new expenditures rarely occurs and some recurrent expenditures have been \nrolled over as new expenditures for up to 18 years. For more details, see the sector analysis in Appendix 2.  \n10  TMA is the second layer of the local government system created by the devolution. The local government system \nincludes district governments, TMAs, and union councils. \n11  Since devolution, district governments have been assigned education and health taxes and various licensing and \nservice fees. Similarly, the TMAs have been assigned very minor fees in addition to the urban immovable property \ntax (UIPT). However, because of capacity constraints among the TMAs the UIPT is still collected by the provincial \ngovernment and transferred back to the TMAs. \n ", "6   \nthe aggregate projections in the MTBF and MTDF and the government\u2019s medium-term fiscal \npolicy. \n \n17.  Weak Tax Administration. Tax administration capacity is one of the weakest areas in \nthe GoPb\u2019s public financial management, and the government for this reason cannot fully exploit \nits revenue-generation capacity.12 The GoPb began the reform of major taxes, including the \nstamp duty, the agriculture income tax, and the urban immovable property tax, under the PRMP, \nto  boost  provincial  revenue,  but  was  constrained  by  weaknesses  in  tax  administration.  At \npresent, tax administration in the province is the responsibility of two separate departments: the \nBoard of Revenue and the Excise and Taxation Department. The Board of Revenue administers \nstamp  duties  and  the  agriculture  income  tax,  while  the  Excise  and  Taxation  Department \nadministers  the  rest  of  the  taxes.  This  dual authority  results in  inefficiencies  and  revenue \nleakages. Poor record-keeping also impairs proper assessment of the effective tax liability. The \nweak capacity of tax administrators further compounds the poor performance of the tax system.  \n \n2.  Need for a Stronger Civil Service Pension System \n18.  Background. With about one million civil servants and about 388,000 pensioners, the \ngovernment is the largest employer in the Punjab. The pension system has two main pillars: the \nPunjab Pension System (PPS) and the General Provident Fund (GPF). Membership in both \nschemes is mandatory. The pension system faces the following key challenges.  \n \n19.  Weak Fiscal and Financial Sustainability. The PPS is a defined benefit system that is \nnoncontributory  and  unfunded,  and  is  financed  from  the  annual  budget  of  the  provincial \ngovernment.  The  GPF  is  also  an  unfunded  defined  contribution  scheme.  Civil  servants\u2019 \ncontributions to the GPF are not invested to meet future liabilities, which are financed through \nthe general budget. Liabilities arising from pension and GPF obligations make up the largest \ncategory of the province\u2019s implicit liabilities. Preliminary actuarial estimates indicate that the \npresent discounted value of the GoPb\u2019s pension liability could be as high as PRs400 billion. The \noutstanding GPF balance, including contributions and interest credited, is reported at PRs15 \nbillion. Pension and GPF outlays have escalated in recent years, and in 2006 amounted to \nPRs12.6  billion  and  PRs4.3  billion,  respectively,  significantly  larger  than  the  government\u2019s \nspending on public health (PRs5.5 billion) and agriculture (PRs2.5 billion). \n \n20.  The GoPb recognizes that its pension obligations have important implications for the \nfinances  of  the  province,  and  that  pension  expenditures,  if  unchecked,  could  crowd  out \ninvestment in the infrastructure and social sectors.     \n \n21.  Gaps in Pension Record-Keeping, Administration, and Payment. In conducting its \npayroll functions, the Office of the Accountant General, Punjab (AGP) records the employment \nhistory of civil servants. At retirement, the worker submits an application to the office, which \ncalculates the worker\u2019s benefits. Pension payments are made monthly through a designated \npayment agent at a branch of the National Bank of Pakistan (NBP). The balance on the GPF \naccount is taken as a lump sum at retirement. \n \n22.  Record-keeping  and  benefit  calculations  are  largely  manual  and  paper-based.  The \nabsence of a robust record-keeping and information management system, combined with weak \nfinancial analysis and accounting capacity, has resulted in inaccuracies in pension entitlement \n                                                 \n12 The recent PEFA assessment rated tax administration capacity substandard (\u201cC+\u201d) with respect to transparency of \ntaxpayer obligations and liabilities, and effectiveness of measures for taxpayer registration and tax assessment.  \n ", "    7\ncalculation and individual payments. Cases of missing contributions, and therefore missing \ninvestment returns on the GPF, are widespread. Moreover, there is no formal channel for \ninquiries or appeals by pensioners when such errors and omissions occur.   \n \n23.  The process of pension disbursement is costly due to cumbersome application and \nidentification requirements, and often long queues in rural areas of NBP branches due to \ninadequate staff. The present system generates payment notice to the authorized NBP branch \non a transaction-by-transaction basis, and does not include monthly authorized allocation. This \nnot only further increases the cost of pension disbursement, but also makes the system more \nerror-prone. There is no mechanism for triggering an action when questionable transactions \noccur. This results in significant leakages from the system in the form of \u201cghost\u201d pensioners.  \n \n24.  Weaknesses in Benefit Structure. Certain features of the current pension scheme \nhave led to inequitable and arbitrary outcomes among individual employees. For instance, \ncalculating pensions on the basis of the last pay drawn by an employee can favor those who get \na salary increase or a promotion immediately before retirement. The international best practice  \nis to base pensions on average earnings over several years. Increases in pension benefits, to \ncompensate for changes in the cost of living, are ad hoc and often trail inflation. Interest \npayments by the government on employees\u2019 GPF contributions are likewise unpredictable. \nCurrently, up to 35% of the pension can be commuted and taken as a lump sum, while the rest \nis paid as an annuity until death. The commutation allowance is high by international standards, \nand may not be consistent with the public policy objective of facilitating consumption-smoothing \nand ensuring adequate old-age income for civil servants. \n \n25.  Since 2005, most civil servants have been contractual employees without pension and \nGPF benefits. More than 50,000 employees thus far have been affected by this arrangement, \nwhich has raised concerns about workplace morale, and the longer-term social and economic \nimplications of having a significant proportion of civil servants with little or no savings and no \npension benefits. \n \n3.  Need for a More Merit-Based and Accountable Civil Service \n26.  Background.  The  public  sector  employs  about  11%  of  employed  workers  in  the \nprovince, including about 967,000 in sanctioned posts in government departments and the \n100,000-plus  employees  of  the  123  public  sector  autonomous  bodies.  While  this  share  is \nmoderate, it understates the importance of the public sector as a major formal sector employer, \nsince about 60% of all employees are self-employed. The civil service wage bill and pensions \naccount for about 59% of total consolidated recurrent expenditure. The need to reform the civil \nservice has been felt at both national and provincial levels. Despite various attempts at reform, \nthe system is commonly perceived to be the same holdover from Pakistan\u2019s colonial past. Some \nof the issues related to public sector employment in the Punjab are discussed below. \n \n27.  Weak  Recruitment,  Performance  Evaluation,  and  Promotion. The Punjab Public \nService Commission (PPSC) recruits public servants for basic pay scale (BPS) 1713 and above. \nThe structural, capacity, and procedural constraints on the functioning of the commission are \nwidely  acknowledged.  Performance  evaluation  has  also  not  been  an  effective  tool  for \nperformance monitoring. A large proportion of civil servants do not have job descriptions, let \n                                                 \n13 The civil service of Pakistan is structured across twenty two basic pay scales (BPS 1-22). With some exceptions, \nthe government officers of BPS 17 and higher are categorized as gazetted officers and assigned middle to senior \nlevel managerial responsibilities such as heads of sections, departments, field offices and drawing and disbursing \nofficers. Government servants below BPS 17 generally work as support staff. \n ", "8   \nalone targets for achievement. The annual confidential report, instead of being a performance \nevaluation  record,  is  commonly  regarded  as  a  compliance  task.  Moreover,  performance \nevaluations play a limited role in career progression in a system in which promotions are largely \nbased on seniority.  \n \n28.  Uncompetitive Compensation and Benefits. There is substantial evidence that the \nreal  compensation  gap  between  public  and  private  salaries  and  emoluments  has  steadily \nwidened. In addition, the wage structure is not closely linked to performance and does not \nprovide adequate incentives for good performance. The provincial government has no control \nover civil service salary scales, which are set by the federal Government. It can, however, \ncreate contract positions outside the cadre scales or pay additional allowances for specific \npositions. For example, program management units (PMUs) have been used as a device to \ncreate specific positions attracting higher reward. There is some evidence suggesting that the \nrecruitment  and  remuneration  practice  of  PMUs  has  strengthened  performance  incentives. \nPMUs thus should be seen as a testing case and precursor for introducing performance-based \nhuman resource management in the civil service of the province. \n \n29.  Achievement  and  Sustainability  of  the  Contractual  Employment  System.  Civil \nservices  reforms  are  a  challenging  task  for  any  government.  Despite  this,  the  GoPb  has \nimplemented some important measures. One major reform initiative since 2003 has been the \nshift  toward  contract  employment  for  fresh  entrants  into  government  service.  Contractual \nemployees are paid 30% above the minimum salary of the relevant pay scale as compensation \nfor not being eligible for pension. However, the difference in compensation between regular and \ncontract employees is not large enough to discourage employees from seeking regularization. \nThe pressure to regularize contract employees is building up as their numbers increase.  \n \n30.  Frequent Transfers. There are no systematic policies or mechanisms for placements \nand transfers. In many cases, the process lacks a professional and technical basis, leading to a \nmismatch between skills and placement. Transfers are often made within a year of service, \nrather than the recommended minimum of 2\u20133 years. As such, the incumbents often barely \nhave time to settle into a new job before they are moved on. \n \n31.  Weak Technical and Managerial Skills. A World Bank report14 points out that the \ntechnical competence of civil servants in the Punjab has been declining over the past two \ndecades. The training of civil servants also draws little interest because of its low returns. The \nGoPb has, however, increased its efforts in the training area in recent years. Supported by the \nPRMP, the government entered into a short-term arrangement with the Singapore Civil Service \nCollege to undertake various training programs. Such efforts mark an encouraging step toward \nimproving the capacity of civil servants. However, much remains to be done to upgrade the \ncapacity, incentives, and accountability of the system. \n \n32.  Challenges Posed by Devolution. The Punjab Local Government Ordinance of 2001 \n(PLGO)  launched  the  process  of  devolution  and  significantly  changed  intergovernmental \nrelationships. Given the relatively short time that has passed since then, there is continuing \nconfusion over the roles, functions, and mandates of the different levels of government and the \nmechanisms for coordination between departments and agencies. The lack of capacity in local \n                                                 \n14 World  Bank.  2004.  Pakistan:  Public  Sector  Capacity  Building  Project.  Washington,  DC.  Available: \nwww.worldbank.org  \n \n ", "    9\ngovernment for such key functions as planning, budgeting, and human resource management is \nalso a major constraint on the effective functioning of this level of government. \n \n4.  Need for Dynamic Private Sector\u2013Led Growth and Public-Private \nPartnerships  \n33.  Background. The Punjab economy has sustained GDP growth rates of more than 6% \nper year since 2003. Investment rates have recovered in recent years. The agriculture and \nservice sectors have been performing well and the Punjab has attracted a major share of recent \nforeign direct investment inflow. The province has thus been able to generate new employment \nopportunities, and to reduce poverty significantly. The private sector still operates mostly in the \ninformal sector, as the high cost of doing business presents a significant barrier to entry. The \ngovernment,  on  the  other  hand,  recognizes  that  it  cannot  meet  on  its  own  the significant \ninvestment requirements in infrastructure and other services. The remaining challenges include \nthe following: \n \n34.  Unclear  Role  of  the  GoPb  in  Private  Sector  Development.  The  role  of  the \ngovernment in private sector development must be better defined. It must be clarified that the \ngovernment is expected to (i) formulate and implement laws, rules, and procedures to govern \nthe  functions  of  the  private  sector;  (ii)  make  the  regulatory  framework  more  efficient  and \neffective, (iii) provide infrastructure facilities; (iv) provide social sector services; and (v) resolve \nissues related to the provision and the treatment of public goods, as well as collective action \nissues that affect key sectors in the provincial economy.  \n \n35.  Weak Prioritization and Coordination of Policy for Private Sector Development. \nPrivate  sector  development  initiatives  and  measures  intended  to  give  the  private  sector  a \ngreater role in service delivery are poorly coordinated. The GoPb lacks a coherent strategy in \nthis area. There have so far been only limited attempts to assess public sector support, to \nprioritize activities and improve their coordination, and to identify gaps in policy objectives and \nprogram implementation. \n \n36.  High  Regulatory  and  Compliance  Costs  of  Doing  Business  in  the  Punjab. \nRegulatory and compliance costs continue to be major concerns for businesses in the Punjab. \nWhile costs and time involved have gone down in areas like business start-up and closure, and \nimport and export administration, they are a persistent challenge in other areas like access to \ncredit,  contract  enforcement,  and  infrastructure  (electricity,  water  and  sanitation,  roads, \ntransport). The government must benchmark the direct and indirect costs of doing business, and \nundertake effective assessments of the benefits and costs of regulation.  \n \n37.  Weak Compliance of Firms with International Standards. The private sector is losing \nout to competitors in the region because it fails to comply with international standards for labor, \nenvironmental protection, and quality. The private sector must become better informed about \nthe legal requirements for production and export. The GoPb, for its part, should ensure that the \ninformation  is  disseminated,  implementing  agencies  coordinate  their  activities,  appropriate \ncapacity is built, and current regulations are reviewed.   \n \n38.  Absence of a Policy and Regulatory Framework for Public-Private Partnerships. \nSome services have traditionally been provided by the public sector, for historical, legal, or \neconomic reasons. Yet within these sectors the public sector feels that it cannot deliver services \nof the quality and quantity required to meet the demand. The government lacks the financial and \ntechnical resources to meet the demand in these two broad categories of services: (i) key social \n ", "10  \nsector services like health and education, and (ii) infrastructure (roads, utilities, water, sanitation, \nsolid waste management). In both these areas the private sector can help narrow or close the \ngap between demand and supply. PPPs can be structured effectively in such cases. However, \nthe rules of the game are not clear at present. A clear policy and regulatory framework is \nneeded to guide the formation of such PPPs in the Punjab.  \n   \nB.  Lessons  \n39.  A large number of program loans have been implemented by ADB and the World Bank \nover the past decade with mixed results. These offer useful lessons for improving policy-based \nlending. ADB\u2019s program lending in Pakistan, and particularly in the Punjab, also demonstrates \nimportant lessons to be reflected in the PGEIP and other proposed clusters. \n  \n40.  Using Policy Conditions as an Evolving Tool for Reforms. A review of policy-based \nlending by ADB and the World Bank15 shows that it has become an important instrument for \nsupporting reforms. One major concern, however, arises from the evidence that many reform \nprograms were structured around unrealistic conditions that were prescriptive, rigid, numerous \nyet not well prioritized, and unsoundly assessed for ownership and institutional capacity. While a \nkey reason for rigid conditions was to make reforms more binding, rigidity has not been effective \nin  making  policy  changes.  Instead,  experience  has  shown  that  policy  adjustments  during \nimplementation may be required by changing domestic and international circumstances, new \nand better ways of doing things, or unforeseen design shortcomings. Thus, one important \nlesson  is  that  policy  conditions  should  be  based  on  sound  diagnostic  analysis,  geared  to \nrespond to evolving circumstances, and structured around open and informed debate about \npolicy reform to nurture desired changes.  \n \n41.  Improving  Integration  between  Programs.  ADB  often  supports  several  lending \nprograms to a country, or a province in the case of the Punjab. Integration and coordination \nbetween programs must be strengthened to reduce duplication and conflicting policy advice. \nThe integrated approach offers one clear way to achieve this objective.  \n \n42.  Securing  Political  and  Bureaucratic  Ownership.  A  prerequisite  for  successful \nprogram implementation is strong political and bureaucratic ownership. The implementation of \nthe PRMP indicates that assistance from development agencies can play a catalytic role in \nbringing about desired changes. However, external assistance by itself cannot substitute for \ngovernment commitment and actions. Thus, for effective development results, the policy agenda \nneeds to be backed by broader country or provincial public sector reforms that are owned and \ndriven by the government. Reforms must therefore be home-grown.   \n \n43.  Effectively  Communicating  with  the  Public  on  Reforms.  Reforms  need  to  be \npreceded  by  sensitization  and  awareness  initiatives  to  build  constituencies  for  change.  In \nparticular, communication and measures that address the concerns of people who are likely to \nbe affected by reforms are necessary to reduce opposition. Program costs as well as TA \nallocation need to explicitly factor in resources needed for communication. Broader stakeholder \nparticipation is also needed to obtain adequate buy-in and to diminish the influence of vested \ninterests.  \n \n                                                 \n15 ADB. 2003.

Aligning  Resources  and  Incentives  with  Desired  Reform  Outcomes. Given the \ncomplexity of reforms, dedicated teams need to be put in place to drive and coordinate activities. \nIdeally, there should be clear terms of reference and performance-related incentives for the \nteams. Nurturing the capacity of the implementing agencies (IAs) is also essential in institution \nbuilding.  Most  programs  involve  one  executing  agency  (EA)  and  several  IAs.  The \nimplementation arrangements need to strike a balance between fostering the central role of the \nEA and creating a sense of ownership in each IA.  \n \n45.  Considering  Reforms  as  Long-Term  Endeavors.  Public  resource  management \nreforms entail a variety of critical institutional and cultural changes and are almost always \ndifficult and lengthy. Policy programs generally also need at least 4\u20135 years to establish a \n\u201creform mind-set\u201d in the government. Reforms should therefore be supported by instruments \nthat allow adequate time for implementation.  \n \n46.  Designing Technical Assistance. Policy reforms often require TA support. The TA \ndesign  needs  to  be  flexible  enough  to  reflect  demand-driven  activities.  TA  implementation \nprocedures need to be simplified to increase efficiency and reduce transaction costs, while also \nbuilding  in  strong  governance  and  accountability  mechanisms.  Establishing  an  effective \nmechanism for responding to lessons learned on TA design and implementation within ADB is \nalso important.   \n \nC.  External Assistance to the Sector \n47.  The PMU of the PRMP is mandated to coordinate all donor-funded policy programs and \nprojects in the Punjab. This institutionalization of donor coordination at the provincial level has \nled to regular coordination meetings with all the development partners involved. The PMU \nbelongs to the provincial Planning and Development Department and issues minutes of these \nmeetings, further facilitating donor coordination.  \n \n48.  The PGEIP was designed in close coordination with other development partners. While \nthe Program is fully aligned with the development strategy of the GoPb and ADB\u2019s country \nstrategy,  it  is  also  intended  to  complement  existing  donor  assistance.  The  Project  for \nImprovement in Financial Reporting and Auditing (PIFRA), supported by the World Bank, is \naimed at improving the accuracy and timeliness of intra-year and year-end government financial \nand fiscal reports at the federal, provincial, and district levels. In the area of public service \ndelivery, the World Bank\u2019s Punjab Irrigation Sector Development Policy Loan is supporting \nreforms to (i) improve transparency and equity of water distribution, (ii) increase the participation \nand empowerment of water users in irrigation service delivery, and (iii) build the capacity of the \nIrrigation and Power Department. Likewise, the World Bank\u2013supported Punjab Education Sector \nReform Program is aimed at improving the quality of education and improving enrollment and \nretention. The Faisalabad Devolution Project, supported by the Department for International \nDevelopment (DFID) of the UK, seeks to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the district \ngovernment to better meet the needs of local communities.  \n \n49.  The World Bank and DFID are also supporting tax administration reforms at the federal \nlevel. The World Bank\u2019s Pakistan Tax Administration Reform Project is aimed at strengthening \nthe Central Board of Revenue to promote voluntary compliance, increased revenue yield, and \nmore equitable application of tax laws. The DFID-supported Tax Administration Reform Project \nseeks to improve tax administration through the adoption of an integrated tax management \nsystem.  Further details on these and other related projects are in Appendix 5, which also \npresents information on the support provided by DFID in Pakistan and the Punjab. ADB will \n ", "12  \ncontinue to coordinate with other development partners during implementation to avoid overlap \nand to maximize synergies. \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PUNJAB GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n50.  The PGEIP will support the GoPb in realizing its long-term goals as expressed in the \nPunjab Vision 2020, where it commits to significantly improve the standard of living of the \npeople of Punjab, especially the poor and the vulnerable. The proposed PGEIP will improve the \noverall functioning of the government machinery at the provincial, district, and municipal levels, \nand thereby improve the quality of public services. The high level impact of the PGEIP will be \nsustained high levels of economic growth resulting in lower poverty incidence and improved \npublic services. The principal outcomes of the PGEIP will be greater efficiency in the allocation \nof scarce public resources and greater responsiveness of the government to the needs of the \ncitizens. PGEIP will achieve these through reforms leading to:  \n \n(i)  greater performance orientation in planning and budgeting;  \n(ii)  a fully funded and well-managed civil service pension system that increases the \nconfidence of civil servants and the public, and generates fiscal space for high-\npriority social sector investments; \n(iii)  improved efficiency of the civil service apparatus, with sound incentives and \nmerit-based appointment and career progression; and  \n(iv)  greater  private  sector  contribution  to  growth  and  sustainable  public-private \npartnerships. \n \n51.  Built on the GoPb\u2019s own second-generation reform agenda, the PGEIP encompasses a \nrange of interlinked and complementary policy actions in four core policy areas (CPAs):   \n \n(i)  CPA  1:  Improving  fiscal  and  financial  management  by  (a)  improving \ncoordination between medium-term budgeting and planning including integration \nbetween the MTBF and the MTDF, and between the annual budget and the \nmedium-term budget and planning framework; (b) increasing the transparency \nand  accountability  of  budget  preparation  and  execution;  (c)  achieving \nperformance orientation in annual budgeting by linking the process more closely \nwith service delivery; and (d) improving revenue mobilization through better tax \nadministration at decentralized levels in the Punjab province. \n \n(ii)  CPA 2: Establishing a financially sustainable pension system that provides \nretirement income security to civil servants by (a) establishing the Punjab \nPension  Fund  (PPF)  and  the  General  Provident  Investment  Fund  (GPIF)  to \nreduce the growing fiscal burden of pension and GPF liabilities, and to create \nfiscal space for priority development expenditures; (b) improving PPF and GPF \nrecord-keeping  and  administration  procedures  to  ensure accurate  and  timely \npayment of benefits to pensioners; and (c) strengthening the pension system to \nenhance pension benefits and coverage, to include contractual employees.  \n \n(iii)  CPA 3: Fostering an efficient and effective civil service by (a) establishing an \ninstitutional foundation that drives civil service reforms, (b) improving the human \nresource  management  policies  for  civil  servants,  (c)  pilot-testing \nperformance-based  human  resource  management  systems  in  selected \n ", "    13\ndepartments and positions, (d) improving the GoPb\u2019s functions and streamlining \nbusiness processes, and (e) increasing capacity building for civil servants.  \n \n(iv)  CPA  4:  Fostering  dynamic  private  sector\u2013led  growth  and  public-private \npartnerships by (a) increasing the scope for private sector\u2013led growth through \nprioritized and streamlined policies and regulations, and reduced government \nparticipation in market activities; and (b) promoting public-private partnerships in \nsocial services and infrastructure provision. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n52.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  for  the  overall  PGEIP  is  in Appendix  1,  the \ndevelopment policy letter is in Appendix 6, and the policy matrix for SP1 is in Appendix 7. \nSupplementary Annex D presents an action plan that fully lays out all the steps involved in \nachieving the policy actions in Appendix 7. The reform elements under each of the CPAs are \ndescribed below.  \n \n1.  Output of Core Policy Area 1: Improved Fiscal and Financial Management \na.  Improve Public Resource Management \n53.  The compartmentalized approach to the preparation of medium-term plans (MTDF) and \nbudgets (MTBF) is a major obstacle to effective public financial management. Therefore, a \nmajor objective of reform under the PGEIP will be to improve the integration between the MTBF \nand MTDF and increase the transparency and accountability of the annual budget process. This \nwill be achieved through increased cooperation between the FD and the P&DD (i.e., central \ndepartments), and between central and line departments. Increased cooperation will further \nfacilitate the integration between the top-down and the bottom-up dimensions of the MTBF and \nMTDF, including timely communication from the FD to other departments of the resources \navailable  over  the  next  3  years,  improved  capacity  of  line  departments  to  appraise  and \ndetermine the cost of investment projects, better coordination between FD and P&DD in the \npublication of the MTBF and MTDF, and the capacity to fully integrate the MTBF and the annual \nbudget.  \n  \n54.  Quality and timeliness of the MTDF and MTBF are essential to improved planning and \nbudgeting. Closer integration between the two will lead to better prioritization of expenditures, \nwith emphasis on productive development spending. While the MTDF for FY2008\u20132010 has \nbeen published, MTBF forecasts are 2 years overdue. As part of SP1, the FD has finalized the \nfiscal forecasts and publish the MTBF for the period FY2008\u20132010. The new MTBF will provide \nmore  transparency  and  predictability  in  the  interdepartmental  allocation  of  resources.  To \nimprove the coordination of the MTBF and MTDF processes, the existing MTBF cell within the \nFD  and  the  MTDF  cell  within  the  P&DD  will  be  strengthened  and  joint  protocols  will  be \ndeveloped. This will result in clearer expenditure ceilings across line departments, and greater \nsustainability  of  development  projects  through  the  allocation  of  resources  for  recurrent \nmaintenance needs. Under SP2, timely annual updating of the MTBF is supported to ensure a \nmore  reliable  and  realistic  assessment  of  the  resources  available  over  the  medium  term. \nDepending on the progress of the first two SPs, a unified MTEF consolidating the planning and \nbudgeting dimensions could be adopted under SP3.  \n \n55.  For the MTBF/MTDF to be a meaningful tool for the effective allocation of resources, it \nhas to be fully integrated with the annual budget process. For this purpose, under SP1, a \n ", "14  \nrevised annual budget statement format has been introduced, providing for an organizational \nand economic classification of expenditures along with a functional classification in the interest \nof increased transparency in the allocation of resources. \n \n56.  The budget call circular (BCC) is a key document, as it is circulated by the FD to line \ndepartments at the start of the budget cycle for the submission of their expenditure estimates. In \nits current format, the BCC is not suited to the integration of the annual budget with the MTBF. \nUnder SP2, the format of BCC will be revised and made more conducive to the full integration of \nthe annual budget and the MTBF, including the notification of recurrent budget ceilings to line \ndepartments16 and the improvement of coordination between the FD and the P&DD.  \n \n57.  Infusing  greater  fiscal  discipline  into  public  expenditure  management  is  another \nimportant  objective  of  reform  under  this  component.  To  this  end,  a  policy  and  regulatory \nframework for fiscal responsibility will be developed under SP2 to promote principles of prudent \nfiscal and financial management in both central and line departments. A review of the existing \nmechanism of excess and surrenders will also be made under SP2 for the purpose of improving \nbudget execution. \n  \n58.  Effective auditing is critical in ensuring accountability in the use of public resources. The \nintroduction  of  performance-based  budgeting  (PBB)  has  increased  the  need  to  carry  out \nperformance auditing in addition to the traditional financial auditing. Under SP3, the GoPb is \nurged to adopt strict guidelines for the obligation of line departments to disclose audited budget \nstatements and precise timelines for responding to comments raised by the auditor. When the \nPBB is fully on track, at least in the pilot entities, a performance auditing system should be \nintroduced to enable the government to assess the capacity of line departments to effectively \nmeet their performance targets through budget expenditures.  \n \n59.  To  support  bottom-up  planning  within  the  context  of  devolution,  and  to  integrate \nprovincial policy priorities into local governments planning, SP1 also supports the notification of \nthe  Local  Government  Planning  Manual  so  that  it  can  serve  as  a  planning  tool  for  local \ngovernments. Local government compliance with rules and procedures set in the manual will \npave the way for local government involvement in the MTEF effort during SP2 and SP3.        \n \n60.  Finally, the Program also seeks improved mobilization of tax revenues at both provincial \nand local government levels. It is aimed at consolidating reform efforts already undertaken \nduring the PRMP in three main areas of tax policy and tax administration, namely: (i) developing \na provincial database of stamp duty collection to improve revenue yields; (ii) supporting the \nimplementation  of  the  provincial  agriculture  income  tax  policy  to  improve  efficiency  in  the \nassessment and collection of the agriculture income tax; and (iii) improving tax administration by \nbringing all tax collection functions under a unified authority. The proposed revenue-augmenting \nmeasures  will  be  adopted  under  SP2  to  increase  the  fiscal  autonomy  of  the  provincial \ngovernment by generating additional revenues. The Program is also aimed at improving local \ngovernment capacity for revenue administration through better coordination with the provincial \ngovernment in tax policy formulation and administration.  \n \n                                                 \n16  At the start of the budget cycle, PDD will have communicated to the line departments the amount of resources \navailable to each of them for the Annual Development Program.  \n ", "    15\nb.  Performance-Oriented Annual Budgeting \n61.  The introduction of performance orientation in the budget process is an important step \ntoward improving the quality of service delivery and implementing a full-fledged MTEF. This step \nrequires a clear definition of service delivery standards, identification of performance indicators \nagainst the standards, and assessment of the costs related to the provision of services. Against \nthis backdrop, steps towards PBB has been launched in a small number of pilot departments in \nSP1, and will be rolled out to more departments in SP2 and SP3. The Department of Health  \n(DOH) and the Department of Irrigation and Power (DI&P) will be the pilot departments. Under \nSP1, an SPU has been strengthened within DOH. It will be responsible for defining sector \npolicies and strategies, and for estimating the resources needed to implement these strategies. \nDI&P has established a new MTEF committee to harmonize the strategic spending priorities of \nthe department and coordinate with the central MTBF/MTDF cells in MTBF/MTDF preparation. \nMore line departments will set up SPUs under SP2. \n \n62.  A necessary condition for the effective introduction of PBB is that pilot entities undertake \na strategic review of their medium-term investment portfolio and recurrent expenditure pattern. \nSP2 will support a departmental expenditure review in both DOH and DI&P to assess whether \nthe  existing  allocation  of  resources  is  in  line  with  the  medium-term  strategic  goals  of  the \ndepartments,  and  to  identify  the  scope  for  rationalizing  resource  allocation.  The  ultimate \npurpose of the expenditure review is to make resource allocations more consistent with the \ndesired service delivery standards, and hence more efficient in the achievement of the MDGs, \nespecially those related to education and health.   \n \n63.  To obtain public feedback on the quality of public services and enable a closer match \nbetween the quality and level of service delivery and citizens\u2019 needs, a citizen satisfaction \nsurvey will be designed and carried out under SP2. The first round will be conducted in selected \ndistrict governments, such as those where the minimum service delivery standards for health-\ncare services will be pilot-tested under the PDSSP.  \n \n2.  Output of Core Policy Area 2: Civil Service Pension Reform \n64.  The PGEIP will support the development of a financially sustainable pension system that \nprovides adequate and equitable retirement income for civil servants. The establishment of a \nfunded pension system will create fiscal space for pro-poor public expenditures, and foster \nproductive investment and financial sector development over the longer term by promoting \ncontractual savings and asset accumulation. In addition, Punjab\u2019s pension reforms could serve \nas a catalytic model for reforms at the federal level and in other provinces. \n \na.  Establishment of the Punjab Pension Fund and the General \nProvident Investment Fund \n65.  The objective of this component is to reduce the growing burden of pension and GPF \nliabilities on the finances of the GoPb, and to create fiscal space for priority development \nexpenditures.  To  this  end,  the  Program  will  support  the  establishment  of  professionally \nmanaged  funds  to  meet  pension  obligations.  With  adequate  capitalization  and  a  prudent \ninvestment strategy, it is expected that the PPF and the GPIF will generate sufficient returns \nover time to finance the pension and GPF obligations.   \n \n66.  The PPF Act passed by the provincial assembly in March 2007 requires that the PPF be \nmanaged by a management committee comprising six ex-officio members, four private sector \n ", "16  \nrepresentatives,  and  a  general  manager.  Under  SP1,  the  GoPb  has  established  the \nmanagement committee, and developed and adopted the PPF implementing rules covering \nfiduciary arrangements, exposure limits and risk management, accounting and auditing, internal \ncontrols, and compliance.  \n \n67.  To date, the government has earmarked PRs8 billion for the capitalization of the PPF \nand PRs4 billion for GPIF. Under SP1, it has undertaken an actuarial valuation of pension \nliabilities, prepared a funding strategy for capitalizing the PPF and the GPIF. The strategy takes \ninto account the magnitude of pension liabilities, possible sources of funds (including provincial \nrevenues, donor funds, and privatization proceeds), and the province\u2019s development needs. To \nminimize operational costs, avoid duplicating efforts, share professional expertise, and take \nadvantage of economies of scale, it is envisaged that the management committee for the PPF \nwill also manage the GPIF. \n \n68.  The GoPb will set up the GPIF and its investment operations in 2008. Building on the \nrules developed under SP1, the government will establish fiduciary arrangements and risk \nmanagement systems and procedures for the PPF and the GPIF. Key actions in this regard \ninclude: (i) selecting investment managers and investment advisers; (ii) appointing a compliance \nofficer and an external auditor; (iii) establishing audit, accounting, and risk controls; and (iv) \nestablishing compliance, reporting, and disclosure systems. \n \nb.  Improved Pension and General Provident Fund Record-Keeping and \nPayment Systems and Procedures  \n69.  The purpose of this subcomponent is to ensure the accurate and timely payment of \nbenefits  to pensioners.  A  reliable  record-keeping  system,  including  information  technology- \nmanagement information system (IT-MIS) that enables the flow of data and information among \nthe FD, the Office of the AGP, and payment agents, is a prerequisite for a credible pension \nsystem.  Effective  mechanisms  for  verifying  claims  to  minimize  inaccurate  and  fraudulent \ntransactions need to be put in place to reduce leakages in the system. The institutional capacity \nof the Office of the AGP to ensure system soundness must also be strengthened. \n \n70.   As the first step toward improving pension administration, the GoPb has prepared a \npolicy note identifying the key weaknesses in the existing system. It has also appointed a \nPension Administration Taskforce (PAT) comprising representatives from the FD and the Office \nof the AGP. PAT will conduct an in-depth assessment of the administrative arrangements, \nincluding the functioning of payment agents, to reduce fraud and errors, as well as streamline \nthe procedures for pension disbursement. On the basis of the assessment, PAT will recommend \nmeasures  to  improve  record-keeping  and  overall  system  administration,  leading  to  swift \nprocessing of pension payments with minimal errors. SP2 and SP3 of PGEIP will also support \nthe implementation of PAT\u2019s recommendations, including the establishment of the IT-MIS and \ncapacity-building measures. \n \nc.  Improved Pension System     \n71.  The objective of this component is to introduce parametric and systemic17 reforms to \nenhance  pension  benefits  and  coverage  while  ensuring  the  financial  sustainability  of  the \n                                                 \n17 Parametric reforms involve modifications in various parameters such as retirement age, contribution rate, among \nothers, within the existing system, whereas systemic reforms involve more fundamental reforms in the overall \ndesign of the pension system. \n ", "    17\npension system. The current pension system was developed in the 1960s and 1970s, and, while \nsome revisions have been made more recently, there is a need for a comprehensive review to \nassess its continued relevance in the current socioeconomic landscape. Under SP2, the GoPb \nwill  evaluate  the  overall  retirement  saving  scheme,  covering  the  retirement  age,  length  of \nservice, indexation, commutation rate, the level of pension benefits, and GPF contribution rate \nand the annual interest on GPF balances. On the basis of the review of contractual policy to be \nsupported under Core Policy Area 3: Civil Service Reforms, specific measures for providing \nretirement saving options for contractual civil servants will be developed. Taking international \nexperience and relevant case studies into account, the GoPb will also explore the prospects for \nintroducing  a  multi-pillar  pension  system  comprising  a  minimum  government-guaranteed \ndefined benefit pillar and mandated and voluntary defined contribution pillars. The legal and \nregulatory framework for the parametric and systemic reforms will be developed under SP3. \n \n3.  Output of Core Policy Area 3: Civil Service Reforms \n72.  With 40 departments, 35 districts, and hundreds of municipal administrations, and, most \nimportantly, one million civil servants in its employ and a client base of over 80 million people, \nthe civil service machinery of the GoPb must be well structured and have efficient business \nprocesses. The objectives of this CPA are to support the government\u2019s efforts in making the civil \nservice more efficient, effective, and responsive by improving the human resource management \nsystem, policies, rules, procedures, and practices. The improvements will in turn (i) enhance the \ncapacity of the government to perform its functions; (ii) make the government a better employer, \nbetter able to attract and retain competent staff; (iii) lift the morale of civil servants; and (iv) \nultimately lead to improved public services for the benefit of the people in the Punjab.     \n \na.  An Institutional Foundation for Civil Service Reform \n73.  Civil service reform (CSR), by virtue of its complexity, requires strong leadership, and \nsupportive  institutional  arrangements.  Three  actions  in  SP1  address  the  institutional \nrequirements at different levels. First, the GoPb has established a high-powered task force to \nlead, guide, and oversee reforms. The Civil Service Modernization and Reform Task Force \n(CSMRTF) will be chaired by the Chief Secretary. To balance effectiveness against the need for \nwide participation, CSMRTF will have about 11 members, including representatives from civil \nsociety. CSMRTF will produce a document clearly expressing its vision for civil service reforms \nin the coming years.  \n  \n74.  Second,  to  steer  the  reforms,  the  GoPb  has  significantly  strengthened  its  Change \nManagement Unit (CMU) by increasing its resources and mandate\u2014it is now the Public Policy \nand  Change  Management  Wing  (PPCMW)  of  the  Service  and  General  Administration \nDepartment (S&GAD). A senior civil servant is full-time head of the PPCMW, which serves as \nCSMRTF secretariat and provides technical and operational support to the CSMRTF. PPCMW \nis the second tier of the institutional foundation for CSR.  \n \n75.  Third,  the  GoPb  has  appointed  change  management  agents  in  all  40 provincial \ndepartments and 35 districts to coordinate the CSR and capacity-building activities. This move \nstrengthens the linkage between the CSMRTF, the PPCMW, and the departments and districts. \nThe change management agents constitute the third tier of the CSR institutional foundation.  \n \n ", "18  \nb.  Improved Human Resource Management System for Civil Servants  \n76.  Serving over 80 million people effectively calls for sound human resource management \n(HRM) systems and policies in the civil service. While the GoPb has pioneered some innovative \nmeasures like the contractual employment system and the strengthening of its provincial civil \nservice cadre, its policies and rules need updating. The government has therefore begun a \nreview of key civil service human resource management policies, including the Punjab Civil \nService  Act  (1974),  the  Punjab  Contract  Appointment  Policy  (2004),  and  the  Provincial \nManagement Service Rules (2003). The Punjab Civil Service Act (1974) has been in place for \nover three decades now and urgently needs review and updating. The government introduced \nthe contractual employment system in 2004, to deal with endemic absenteeism among regular \nstaff, especially in the education and health departments; disincentives to good performance, \nowing to security of tenure; problems relating to automatic promotions based on seniority; and \nthe complicated nature and ineffectiveness of the existing disciplinary rules and mechanisms for \nholding regular government employees accountable. However, there are concerns about the \nsustainability of the contract employment system, which call for a review of the system to \nsustain  the  gains  made  thus  far.  A  key  issue  relates  to  pension  provision  for  contract \nemployment.  \n \n77.  The  government  has  recruited  the  first  batch  of  civil  servants  under  the  enhanced \nProvincial Management Service (PMS), which combines two parallel provincial civil service \nstreams. The PMS is a critical part of the civil service system, as the bulk of the positions are \nmiddle-management  district  officer  positions,  directly  in  charge  of  service  delivery  at  local \ngovernment levels. While it has taken the good step of setting up the PMS, the GoPb needs to \nensure the career management of the PMS staff vis-\u00e0-vis those civil servants that are appointed \nby the federal Government. Without an HRM system that rewards performance and exacts \nadequate accountability, the PMS runs the risk of suffering from established systemic problems. \nThe PGEIP will provide continuous support in getting the incentives right for the PMS.  \n \n78.  Rapid change will not be desirable in a civil service one million strong. Hence, the GoPb \nwill pilot-test changes in the HRM system in eight departments, before moving toward greater \nperformance orientation. The pilot will be aimed at promoting transparent and merit-based \nrecruitment  and  promotion  systems,  performance-oriented  compensation,  and  greater \naccountability of civil servants. A Punjab Civil Servant Human Resource Management Manual \nwill  be  developed  under  SP2,  and  related  training  will  be  carried  out  for  both  provincial \ndepartments and local governments.  \n \n79.  Given the problems faced by the PPSC (para. 27), the government intends to strengthen \nits structure and functioning, as an improved PPSC is essential for increasing flexibility and \nefficiency, as well as safeguarding the integrity of civil service recruitment. \n \nc.  Improved Government Functions and Streamlined Business \nProcesses \n80.  The government is committed to taking two key steps to improve the functioning of the \ncivil service. First, it will appoint about 10 senior civil servants to principal secretary positions, to \nhelp  coordinate  service  delivery.  All  heads  of  provincial  and  district  departments  and \ncorporatized agencies now report to the chief secretary in all policy and administrative matters. \nThe government recognizes that such a system is unsustainable. The principal secretaries will \nact  as  the  middle  layer  and  ensure  smoother  interdepartmental  and  province-district \ncoordination. Second, before initiating any system-wide restructuring, the government identified \n ", "    19\na few key departments that will undergo a full-fledged functional review and a reengineering of \ntheir business processes. The PGEIP will support progress on both fronts and deepen reforms.  \n \nd.  Strengthened Capacity of Civil Servants \n81.  To improve its in-house training capacity, the GoPb is collaborating with the Singapore \nCivil Service College to modernize its MPDD. As part  of this effort, the MPDD has been \nupgraded to the principal training and capacity-building arm of the Punjab civil service. The \nMPDD has developed a training framework to guide capacity-building activities for the civil \nservice in the province. The PGEIP and the associated TA loan will support a range of initiatives \nunder this subcomponent. \n \n4.  Output of Core Policy Area 4: Private Sector Development \na.  Dynamic Private Sector\u2013Led Growth \n82.  The private sector reform initiatives under PRMP were largely stand-alone interventions \nwith a limited strategic view of how best to foster private sector\u2013led growth. Under the PGEIP, \nthe development of a well-defined private sector development strategy will form a major building \nblock for SP1 and SP2. The GoPb will consult closely with the private sector, and develop a \nstrategy with a clear road map for the role of the public sector in fostering private sector\u2013led \ngrowth.  This  will  be  achieved  under  the  direction  of  a  private  sector  development  (PSD) \ncommittee, which will coordinate policy initiatives and streamline government policy across the \nrelevant departments.  \n \n83.  In parallel, the government will also take specific measures to promote PSD. First, it has \nput in place an effective strategy for communicating to enterprises in the provinces the need to \ncomply with core labor and international quality and environmental standards. It will also review \nthe current norms in place in the Punjab and take measures to close the gap between provincial \nand international requirements. Second, the government will institute a regular survey on the \ncost of doing business in the Punjab. The survey will (i) set benchmarks for performance, \n(ii) allow  tracking  of  costs  and  of  progress  made,  and  (iii)  allow  regular  and  continuous \nassessment of relevant issues. It will identify the key problem areas and allow the GoPb to \naddress the legal and institutional reforms needed to bring down the cost of doing business. The \ngovernment will also institutionalize a regulatory impact assessment mechanism in relevant \ndepartments. \n \nb.  Public-Private Partnerships \n84.  For PPP arrangements to be effective, there needs to be a comprehensive legal and \nregulatory framework and mechanisms. To initiate this process and to coordinate overall PPP \nimplementation, the government has created a PPP cell in the P&DD with clear tasks, given the \ncomplexity,  lack  of  understanding,  and  multiple  actors  involved.  The  government  will  also \nprepare a risk management framework and establish funding mechanisms to provide resources \nthat will reduce the viability gap in projects. The government is expected to identify a number of \nPPP opportunities and to implement the regulatory framework adopted throughout the PGEIP. \n  \n ", "20  \nc.  Summary of Achievements under Subprogram 1 of the Punjab \nGovernment Efficiency Improvement Program \n85.  Box 1 is a summary of the key achievements of the GoPb as part of the policy dialogue \nunder SP1 of the proposed PGEIP cluster.  \n \nBox 1: Achievements of the Punjab Government in Public Sector Reforms \n \nCommitment and consultation. The government of the Punjab has: \n\u2022  Set out a clear vision to transform Punjab into a modern and affluent society; \n\u2022  Engaged international development partners to imbibe best practices for reforms; and \n\u2022  Undertaken extensive stakeholder consultations in designing the proposed integrated framework for the \nthree proposed program clusters, to accelerate reforms relating to: (i) public financial management, (ii) the \npension system, (iii) the civil service, (iv) the attainment of the MDGs, and (v) the judicial sector. \nProgress under the PGEIP. The government\u2019s reform efforts have gone much beyond the policy requirements of the \npast  and  ongoing  development  agency  programs.  Some  recent  achievements,  particularly  over  late  2006\u2013\nAugust 2007, in the context of policy dialogue under the PGEIP, are outlined below.  \n \nI.            Strengthening of Public Financial Management \n\u2022  Articulating medium-term priorities and adopting a 3-year rolling budget framework. The \ngovernment has released the MTBF for FY2008\u20132010, which supplements the rolling MTDF. Both \nhave enhanced fiscal discipline and made budgeting and planning more predictable.  \n\u2022  Strengthening policy functions in key departments \n\u2022  Making budget formulation more participatory. The government has mandated adherence to \nthe Local Government Planning Manual,  which stipulates civil society consultations. This in turn will \nreduce elite capture and make local government budgeting more participatory.  \n\u2022  Infusing performance orientation into budgeting by specifying outcome targets for key \nsectors that are anchored in accelerated MDG attainment  \n    \nII.  Reforms in the Civil Service Pension System \n\u2022  Accelerating the establishment of a funded system. The government envisions an increase in \nfunding to PRs100 billion ($1.7 billion) by FY2015\u20132016 to capitalize the budget, thus releasing \npublic resources for critical social priorities. This vision is the key driving factor in seeking policy \nreform and substantial financing support from ADB of about $1.5 billion over a 5-year period. \n\u2022  Enhancing  fiduciary  governance.  The  government  has  established  a  sound  management \nstructure and adopted rules for managing the funds. The emerging architecture will boost civil \nservants\u2019 morale and public confidence, and strengthen financial markets. \n \n III.  Civil Service Reforms \n\u2022  Demonstrating strong desire for reforms and adopting a civil service reform vision. The \ngovernment\u2019s clearly stated objective is to make the Punjab civil service effective, efficient, and \nresponsive.  \n\u2022  Strengthening change management institutions. The PPCMW is fully operational. Change \nmanagement agents are being appointed in all provincial departments and districts. Further, the \ngovernment is modernizing the MPDD, its training and capacity-building arm, in collaboration with \nthe Singapore Civil Service College. These steps will significantly strengthen the institutional \narchitecture for civil service reforms. \n\u2022  Improving inter- and intra-departmental and sectoral coordination. The government is taking \nsteps to appoint around 10 senior officials to principal secretary positions to improve coordination \namong the 40 government departments in the Punjab. This step will reduce overlap, duplication, \nand  inconsistency.  Some  key  departments  are  also  initiating  functional  reviews  to  improve \noperations and service delivery.  \n\u2022  Identifying performance-based human resource management positions, units, and sections. \nThese will become models for merit-based human resource management, and pave the way for \n ", "    21\nwide-ranging HR reforms. \n\u2022  Improving government function and re-engineering business processes. The government is \npreparing for a functional review and business process reengineering in key departments.  \n \nIV.  Private Sector Development \n\u2022  Defining the optimal role of the government vis-\u00e0-vis the private sector. Building on PRMP \nprogress, the government is developing a private sector development strategy and has formed a \nPSD committee. \n\u2022  Reducing compliance costs. The government is taking measures to require businesses to adhere \nto international standards for labor, environment, and quality. \n\u2022  Fostering PPPs. A PPP cell is being established to develop a legal/institutional framework for \nPPP, coordinate the identification of PPP opportunities, and address risk sharing between the \npublic and private sectors. \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, FY = fiscal year, HR = human resource, MDG = millennium development goal, \nMPDD = Management and Professional Development Department, MTBF = medium-term budget framework, MTDF \n= medium-term development framework, PGEIP = Punjab Government Efficiency Improvement Program, PPCMW = \nPublic Policy and Change Management Wing, PRMP = Punjab Resource Management Program, PPP = public-\nprivate partnership, PSD = private sector development. \n \nC.  Important Features \n86.  Close Alignment with the Reform Agenda of Government. The PGEIP is fully aligned \nwith the GoPb\u2019s long-term development vision and second-generation reforms, and makes use \nof the synergy between long-term goals, medium-term milestones, and short-term actions. It has \nbeen developed through widespread consultation and consensus building, thus laying a solid \nfoundation for its successful implementation.  \n \n87.  Flexible Policy Triggers with a Concrete and Evolving Action Plan. The PGEIP \nadopts a flexible approach by defining indicative triggers, while supporting a detailed action plan \nto aid implementation, monitor output, and sustain the momentum of reform. The action plan \nclearly sets out the role and responsibilities of each IA, and spells out the expected steps \nrequired from the start of the Program. The action plan for each SP is a living document that can \nbe adjusted to best suit the requirements of reforms. This two-pronged approach effectively \naddresses the flexibility and accountability requirements.  \n   \n88.  Single-Tranche  Modality. The move to adopt single-tranche operations reflects the \nlessons learned from the policy-lending experience of ADB and the World Bank. This modality \nenables the adjustment of short-term actions to achieve medium-term outcomes and long-term \ngoals. This linkage between short-term actions, medium-term outcomes, and long-term goals \nputs short-term actions on a sound footing. On the other hand, the identification of short-term \nactions  makes  reforms  \u201cimplementable\u201d  and  helps  reduce  information  requirements  and \nuncertainty. The emphasis on completing reform actions before processing the next SP also \nputs in place strong accountability for both the government and the development agencies. This \napproach also effectively integrates program processing with program implementation, such that \nreforms  take  place  through  continuous  policy  dialogue.  This  contrasts  with  the  traditional \nmulti-tranche  approach,  which  compartmentalizes  the  processing  and  implementation  of \nprograms, leaving little room for improvement during program implementation. \n \n89.  Institutional Development. While the PGEIP emphasizes the achievement of outcomes, \nit also recognizes that outputs and outcomes in the public sector cannot always be measured. It \nthus pays special attention to putting in place procedures, processes, and systems to ensure \n ", "22  \neffective output and outcome. It also strengthens institutional coordination between departments \nsuch as FD and P&DD, as well as between the EA and IAs.  \n \n90.  Combination  of  Diagnostic  Studies,  Policy  Changes,  and  Pilot-Testing.  The \nProgram  adopts  a  programmatic  approach,  which  combines  measures  based  on \ncomprehensive  analysis  with  an  \u201copportunistic\u201d  approach  to  change  implementation. \nPilot-testing,  rather  than  across-the-board  actions,  is  proposed,  to  bring  about  sustainable \nchange.  \n \nD.  Financing Plan \n91.  Loan  Size,  Terms,  and  Conditions.  The  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of \n$250 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to finance SP1 of the PGEIP, with interest to \nbe determined according to ADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)\u2013based lending facility; \na 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; and other terms and conditions substantially \nin accordance with those set forth in the draft program loan agreement presented to the Board. \nThe Government has decided on its own to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, \nand it has made an undertaking to the effect that this choice was not made on the basis of any \nadvice from ADB. Interest rate and currency conversion options may be exercised according to \nthe terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement, the loan regulations, and ADB\u2019s \nconversion guidelines. \n \n92.  The following factors have been taken into account in determining the loan size: (i) the \nstrength  of  the  Program  and  its  development  impact,  (ii)  the  financial  and  political  cost \nassociated with the implementation of the Program, and (iii) the overall development financing \nneeds estimated by the FD of the GoPb. \n \n93.  The  principal  driver  in  the  government\u2019s  decision  to  seek  ADB\u2019s  policy  reform  and \nfinancing  support  is  to  accelerate  the  funding  of  the  civil  service  pension  system.  The \ngovernment looks forward to funding the pension system, and for this it will require a massive \ninfusion of at least PRs100 billion ($1.7 billion) by FY2015\u20132016. It plans to invest these funds \nin a prudent manner to meet the annual pension outlays. Against this need, the government has \nsought about $300 million in program lending disbursements every year over FY2007\u20132011.  \n \n94.  Effective public resource management is a key contributor to economic efficiency, broad-\nbased economic growth, employment creation, poverty reduction, and social progress. Reforms \nin all the four core policy areas of the PGEIP are essential for providing good governance, \ncreating  fiscal  space,  reducing  waste,  improving  value  for  money  in  public  finance,  and \nimproving  public  service  delivery.  Reforms  under  the  PGEIP  are  crucial  in  sustaining \ndevelopment in the Punjab, and the opportunity cost of not undertaking reforms will be very high. \nThe financial and economic costs associated with the reforms are expected to be substantial, \ngiven the scope of the reforms. Political costs are considerable, as initiatives such as civil \nservice  reforms  will  significantly  shake  up  the  vested  interests  that  benefit  from  weak \ngovernance. Direct adjustment costs include the following: (i) capitalization of PPF and GPIF, \n(ii) implementation costs to improve public financial management systems, (iii) increased wage \ncosts as civil service reforms bring compensation more in line with the market rate, (iv) costs to \nleverage reforms that may face resistance through consensus building, and (v) reduced revenue \nto the government due to lower compliance costs. While there are costs associated with reforms \nin the short run, the eventual economic benefits will greatly outweigh the costs in the long run. \n  \n ", "    23\n95.  Over the medium term, sustained growth in the Punjab and pro-poor spending put \nimmense pressure on financial resource mobilization. The government\u2019s financing needs will be \nsignificant if it is to sustain its target of 7% economic growth, create over one million new jobs \neach year, and raise spending in the social sectors. The MTBF and MTDF show that the budget \ndeficit will reach PRs37.3 billion (about $622 million) in FY2008 and further to PRs55.9 billion \n($932 million) and PRs42.8 billion (about $714 million) in FY2009 and FY2010, respectively \n(Table 1). The surplus in the net public account in FY2008 somehow relieves the financing \npressure, but the overall financing requirement from FY2008 to FY2010 remains significant, \naveraging around $890 million per year. Absorbing the proposed disbursement of about $300 \nmillion yearly will not impair fiscal sustainability. The World Bank estimates show that the net \npresent of value of provincial public debt as a percentage of provincial GDP will decline from \n1.9% in FY2006 to 1% in FY2010.18   \n \nTable 1: Medium-Term Financing Requirement of the Punjab, FY2008\u20132010 \n(PRs million) \n     FY2008    FY2009    FY2010   \nRevenues  356,172   366,189  428,045   \nLess: Expenditures  393,487   422,084   470,871   \n   Currenta  243,487   265,120   289,523   \n   Development  150,000   156,964   181,348    \nBudget Surplus/(Deficit)        (37,315)          (55,895)       (42,826)   \n         \nBudgetary Financing Requirement  37,315   55,895   42,826   \nAdd:  Capital Expendituresb   25,819   7,242   7,328    \nless:  Net Public Account  14,774   588   638    \nOverall Financing Gap  48,360   62,549   49,516   \n   In $ Millionc  806   1,042   825    \na Includes pension fund capitalization. \n \nb Consists of loan and equity payments, and debt principal repayments. \nc At PRs60 = $1.   \nSources: Medium-Term Budget Framework, 2007\u20132010; ADB staff calculations.   \n         \n96.  Relending to the GoPb. The Government of Pakistan will relend the local currency \ngenerated from the proceeds of the loan to the GoPb. The terms and conditions will be the \nsame as those extended by ADB to the Government of Pakistan. The GoPb will assume the \nforeign exchange risk and interest rate risks.     \n \n                                                 \n18  World Bank estimates in World Bank. 2007.

The  high-level  steering \ncommittee  chaired  by  the  chief  secretary  and  comprising  as  members,  the  Planning  and \nDevelopment (P&D) chairman, additional chief secretary S&GAD, finance secretary, secretaries \nof IAs, and at least three representatives of civil society and the private sector, will guide PGEIP \nimplementation. The steering committee will convene at least twice a year and post its major \ndecisions and recommendations on the PRMP website. Since the steering committee is large \nand finds it difficult to meet more often, an executive committee under the P&D chairman, with \nmembers  from  the  FD  and  the  S&GAD  was  established  in  2006  to  ensure  efficient \nimplementation. The executive committee will meet at least once every 3 months. It will oversee \nprogram implementation and approves TA plans. To increase program ownership among the \nIAs,  the  executive  committee  will  also  include  IAs  working  on  the  specific  reform  area. \nMembership will thus change according to the specific area covered. ADB may be invited to \nparticipate in the executive committee meetings as an observer. \n \n98.  A PMU has been in place since 2003 and will continue to be the secretariat of the \nsteering and executive committees. As the PMU also coordinates all other donor-assisted policy \nreform programs, including the DFID TA projects in the Punjab, it is well placed to avoid any \noverlap or duplication of efforts.  \n \n99.  The  major  implementation  agencies  are  the  FD,  P&DD,  MPDD,  S&GAD,  and  the \nDepartments of Health, Irrigation and Power, Labor and Human Resource, Commerce and \nInvestment, Industries, as well as other relevant departments and agencies. All implementing \nagencies under the Program have focal persons and a core team, which assists in implementing \nthe PRMP agenda.19  \n \n  2.  Implementation Period \n \n100.  The implementation period for the PGEIP subprogram 1 is from June 2006 to October \n2007. All actions included in the policy matrix for SP1 have been completed. The indicative \nimplementation  period  for  SP2  is  from  December  2007  to  May  2009,  and  for  SP3,  from \nJune 2009 to December 2010. Loan completion is expected by 31 December 2010 and the loan \nclosing date is 30 June 2011. \n \n101.  To ensure flexibility and still guide reform actions, a detailed action plan for SP1 has \nbeen developed in consultation with the provincial government. The action plan will be a living \ndocument, adjusted through close coordination between ADB and the GoPb so that it is an \nevolving tool in assisting policy reforms. While reform measures are closely interlinked and not \ndiscrete, there is no overlap between the specific actions supported under the PGEIP and the \nrecently concluded PRMP. \n \n  3.  Tranching and Counterpart Financing \n \n102.  The loan proceeds will be available for withdrawal in a single tranche in the amount of \n$250 million for SP1, to be released after the loan becomes effective. All prior actions in the \n                                                 \n19  For focal persons and departmental core teams, see http://www.punjab-prmp.gov.pk/focal.htm \n ", "    25\nSP1 policy matrix in Appendix 7 must have been satisfied and the loan must have become \neffective before the SP1 tranche can be withdrawn. \n \n103.  Counterpart Funds. The GoPb will ensure that the local currency counterpart funds \ngenerated by the loan will be used, first, to capitalize the Punjab Pension and General Provident \nFunds according to the government\u2019s strategy; second, to support the structural adjustment cost \nof reforms under the Program; and, third, to finance expenditures for general development \npurposes.  The  government  will  certify  the  use  of  counterpart  funds  in  line  with  the  loan \nagreement through audited statements acceptable to ADB.  \n \n4.  Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements  \n \n104.  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding \nlocal duties and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding the \nitems specified in the negative list of ineligible items (and imports20 financed by other bilateral \nand  multilateral  sources).  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans,21 the proceeds of the \nprogram  loan  will  be  disbursed  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  as  the  Borrower.  No \nsupporting import documentation will be required if, during each year that the loan proceeds are \nexpected to be disbursed, the value of Pakistan\u2019s total imports minus imports from nonmember \ncountries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development assistance is \nequal to or greater than the amount of the loan expected to be disbursed during that year. The \nGovernment  of  Pakistan  will  certify  its  compliance  with  this  formula  with  each  withdrawal \nrequest.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing  procedures  will  be  required. \nDisbursements will be made under the simplified procedures for program loans.  \n \n5.  Anticorruption, Fiduciary Issues, Accounting, and Auditing \n \n105.   ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed  with  the  Government  of  Pakistan.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProgram.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are \nincluded in the applicable loan regulations and bidding documents. In particular, all contracts \nfinanced by ADB will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the \nrecords and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to PGEIP. All relevant ADB guidelines, including the \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time), Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time), and the applicable loan regulations, were \nspecifically brought to the notice of the Government. \n   \n106.  ADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s certification for withdrawal applications. Before withdrawal, the Government will \nopen a deposit account at the State Bank of Pakistan to receive all loan proceeds. The account \nwill be managed, operated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB. The \n                                                 \n20 Eligible imports are total imports minus imports from nonmember countries, non-eligible imports specified in the list \nof ineligible items, and imports already financed by ADB or other international and bilateral development agencies. \nSee Appendix 8 for the list of ineligible items.  \n21  ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n ", "26  \nP&DD will be required to submit quarterly progress reports, as well as a final report on the \nprogress of SP1 implementation.  \n \n107.  The Government of Pakistan emphasizes the strengthening of internal control systems \nand overall public financial management. Much progress has been made with support from the \nWorld Bank through PIFRA. While that project covers the federal Government as well as the \nfour provinces in Pakistan, the most significant improvement has been achieved in the Punjab in \nstrengthening financial reporting and auditing (for details see www.AGP.org.pk). \n \n108.  The policy actions under the PGEIP will also complement the anticorruption efforts of the \nGovernment  of  Pakistan.  For  instance,  the  policy  actions  under  CPA1  will  enhance \ntransparency and accountability in budget preparation and execution. Improvements in pension \nrecord-keeping and administration will minimize the scope for errors as well as fraudulent \nactivities in the accounting and disbursement of pension benefits. Business process review and \nreengineering to be implemented under CPA3 will also enhance transparency and minimize \nopportunities for corruption. Likewise, policy actions under CPA4 will promote the development \nof a transparent public-private partnership regime. \n \n6.  Performance Monitoring and Evaluation, Program Review, and Reporting \n \n109.   The GoPb and ADB have agreed on a range of outcome and output indicators to \nmonitor the PGEIP implementation and evaluate its impact within the overall framework of the \nProgram (Appendix 1).  \n \n110.   The GoPb and ADB will periodically review progress implementation and assess the \nimpact of the PGEIP. The GoPb will keep ADB informed of the outcome of policy discussions \nwith  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies  that  have  implications  for  the  PGEIP \nimplementation, and will provide ADB with the opportunity to comment on any resulting policy \nproposals. A progress review will be conducted by the executive committee every quarter and a \nprogress report will be shared with ADB, with the first progress report due on 15 January 2008. \nThe summary of the progress report will be published on the PRMP website (http://www.punjab-\nprmp.gov.pk/). To assist the monitoring and evaluation of the PGEIP implementation, a detailed \naction plan has been developed for SP1 (Supplementary Appendix E). Likewise, for SP2 and \nSP3, ADB will develop detailed action plans to serve as a guidance document to be revised and \nenhanced during review missions. The engagement of civil society will be pursued through the \nPDF.  This  annual  event  enables  the  GoPb  to  communicate  its  development  policies  and \npriorities to the public. PRMP-related information is widely disseminated to the public through a \ndedicated website. Regular workshops and meetings involving civil society will be organized by \nthe PMU to seek ideas on public development from the public and to disseminate information.  \n  \nV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Technical Assistance Loan \n1.  Objectives \n111.  The objective of the TA loan is to support the implementation of reforms under the \nPGEIP.  Specifically,  the  TA  will  support  policy  advice,  diagnostic  studies,  stakeholder \nconsultations, and capacity building to achieve (i) greater performance orientation in planning \n ", "    27\nand budgeting, (ii) a financially stable and adequate pension system with improved benefits and \nwider coverage, (iii) an efficient and effective civil service, and (iv) a dynamic private sector.  \n \n2.  Methodology and Activities \n112.   In line with the scope of the PGEIP, the TA loan has five components: (i) fiscal and \nfinancial  management,  (ii)  pension  reform,  (iii)  civil  service  reform,  (iv)  private  sector \ndevelopment,  and  (v)  reform  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  TA  activities  are  divided  into \n(i) operational support, including equipment and related software; (ii) studies and assessments; \nand (iii) training and capacity building. Appendix 9 presents the full details of the TA loan \ncomponents, and Supplementary Appendix F presents the terms of reference for the consulting \nservices. \n \n3.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n113.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $10 million \nequivalent (Table 2). ADB will provide financing of $8.8 million. In-kind contribution, equivalent \nto $1.2 million, from the GoPb will cover the counterpart staff, training and workshop facilities, \noffice accommodation, and transport. \n \nTable 2: Cost Estimates \n($\u2019000) \n  Total \nItem  Cost \nA.

The GoPb has requested a loan of $8.8 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to \nhelp finance the TA project. The loan will have a term of 32 years including a grace period of 8 \n ", "28  \nyears, an interest rate of 1% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter, and \nother terms and conditions set forth in the TA loan and TA program agreements.  \n \n115.  The federal Government will make the loan proceeds available to the GoPb in domestic \ncurrency, at mutually agreed terms and conditions. The GoPb will assume the foreign exchange \nand interest rate risk. \n \n4.  Implementation Arrangements \n116.   In parallel and in addition to the ADB TA loan, the Government of the United Kingdom \nwill provide a grant of $3 million to the Punjab government to fund activities and tasks that \ncomplement the ADB TA loan, including diagnostic studies, analytic assessments, and capacity \nbuilding in the areas of public financial management, civil service reform, and private sector \ndevelopment. The grant funds will be part of a larger pool of resources that will be used in a \nflexible  manner  to  meet  the  emerging  needs  of  the  provincial  government  in  the \nabovementioned areas, among others.22 The identification of specific tasks and activities to be \nfunded under the TA loan will become clearer as the reform agenda progresses, and specific \nactivities may change. In that case, ADB will work closely with the GoPb and the Government of \nthe United Kingdom to reallocate resources. \n \n117.  The proposed PGEIP has identified the need for capacity-building support to the DOH as \none of the pilot departments identified for the implementation of the MTEF.23 The health sector \nalso represents a primary area of intervention for the PDSSP and its attached TA grant.24 \nTherefore, in view of the synergies between the PDSSP and the technical assistance needs of \nthe DOH identified by the PGEIP, ADB, the Government of the United Kingdom, and the \nprovincial government have agreed that the costs of the TA support to the DOH will be covered \nby TA 4504 (see footnote 24) funds up to a total amount of $1.64 million.25 \n \n118.  P&DD will be the EA for the TA loan, and various IAs will be responsible for their \nrespective components. The main IAs will be the FD, P&DD, DOH and DI&P for components 1; \nFD for Component 2; S&GAD and MPDD, for component 3; the Departments of Commerce and \nInvestment, Industries, and Labor and Human Resource, for component 4; and P&DD, for \ncomponent 5. All implementing agencies under the PGEIP will have focal persons and a core \nteam, which will assist in implementing the PGEIP agenda. \n \n119.  The  TA  loan  will  be  implemented  over  4  years.  It  will  be  completed  by \n30 November 2011 and closed by 31 May 2012. \n \n120.  The TA loan will support the hiring of consultants, including experts in public financial and \nresource management, social service delivery, pensions, civil service reforms, and private sector \ndevelopment, for a total of 140 person-months of international and 156 person-months of national \n                                                 \n22 To administer this pool of funds a technical assistance management agency will be established by the Government \nof the United Kingdom.  \n23 For a detailed description of the technical assistance support to the DOH, see Supplementary Appendix F. \n24 TA 4504 consists of a $20 million grant financed by the Government of the United Kingdom and administered by a \ntechnical assistance management agency hired under the PDSSP. (TA 4504 attached to Loans 2144 and 2145; \nADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Program Loans \nand Technical Assistance Grant to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Punjab Devolved Social Services \nProgram. Manila).   \n25 ADB, the Government of the United Kingdom, and the Punjab government have agreed that the PDSSP technical \nassistance management agency should administer the $1.64 million. For a breakdown of the related costs, see \nTable F3 in Supplementary Appendix F. \n ", "    29\nconsulting services. All consultants will be recruited according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time) and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB \nfor the hiring of consultants. Where firms are to be hired, consultant selection may use any \nselection method under ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, preferably the quality- and \ncost-based selection method.  \n \n121.  The  TA  loan  will  also  support  the  hiring  of  resource  persons  to  assist  in  program \nimplementation. Appropriate guidelines on the use of resource persons, acceptable to ADB, will \nbe developed by the EA, and included in the project administration memorandum. \n \n122.  The procurement of goods and services will conform to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Supply contracts for equipment or materials estimated to \ncost  at  least  the  equivalent  of  $500,000  will  be  awarded  through international  competitive \nbidding,  those  costing  less  than  the  equivalent  of  $500,000,  through  national  competitive \nbidding, and supply contracts valued at less than $100,000, through shopping. \n \n123.  The IAs concerned will finalize the terms of reference. All consultant selection and \nprocurement will be done through the PMU, with the IA concerned being represented in the \nConsultant Selection Committee (CSC). The CSC will be responsible for consultant shortlisting \nand contract negotiations. \n \n124.  For additional demand-driven support under the TA, IAs must submit for the approval of \nthe executive committee, with the concurrence of ADB, a proposal outlining the rationale, issues, \nthematic coverage, consulting inputs and terms of reference, procurement requirements, cost \nestimates, and implementation plan for the activity. The steering committee will be informed of all \nactivities funded from the unallocated pool of funds. All consultant recruitment under approved \nprojects will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. All procurement \nof goods and services under approved projects will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines.  The  procurement  plan  will  be  updated  to  include  consultant  recruitment  and \nprocurement under the approved activities. \n \n125.  All disbursement under the TA loan will conform to ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007, as amended from time to time). The P&DD will establish and maintain separate accounts \nfor the TA according to accounting procedures acceptable to ADB. An imprest account will be \nset up after the loan takes effect, and it will be managed, replenished, and liquidated according \nto ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The initial amount to be deposited into the imprest \naccount  will  not  exceed  the  equivalent  of  $400,000  or  6  months\u2019  estimated  expenditures, \nwhichever is less. The accounts, together with a record of expenditures under the TA loan and \nthe use of the imprest account, will be audited annually by independent auditors in accordance \nwith auditing standards acceptable to ADB. Certified copies in English of the audited accounts \nand financial statements and the report of the auditors will be submitted to ADB within 9 months \nat the end of each fiscal year. \n \n126.  The GoPb, ADB, and DFID will periodically review TA implementation. The reviews will \ninclude an evaluation of the TA loan scope, implementation arrangements, progress on the \npolicy reform agenda, and capacity-building measures. Regular ADB and DFID joint missions \nwill be fielded to assess progress and to provide further guidance on the TA project. \n \n ", "30  \nB.  Technical Assistance Grants \n127.  Advisory Technical Assistance (ADTA). With several stakeholders for each CPA, an \nadvisory TA grant is proposed to provide expert assistance to the EA and key IAs in program \ncoordination,  as  well  as  in  program  and  TA  loan  monitoring  and  evaluation.  Independent \nadvisory support to the provincial government in establishing sound fiduciary arrangements for \nthe pension system, and to the PPCMW in initiating and monitoring CSR measures, will also be \nprovided. The total cost of the TA grant is estimated at $1.2 million equivalent. ADB will finance \n$950,000 equivalent on a grant basis from its TA funding program to cover the consulting \nservices  and  the  cost  of  training,  seminars,  and  workshops.  The  government\u2019s  in-kind \ncontribution will be $250,000 equivalent. Details of the TA grant are in Appendix 10. \n \n128.  Program Preparatory Technical Assistance (PPTA). The GoPb has also requested \nADB for TA to support the preparation of the PMDGP and PAJP clusters. The TA will cover \ndiagnostic assessments of the constraints impeding social service delivery in the Punjab, and \npriority policy, regulatory, and institutional actions to accelerate the attainment of the MDGs, \nparticularly those related to health care. It will also help establish an effective interface between \nthe administrative and judicial institutions, and facilitate dialogue between the two sides, leading \nto the design of policy, legal, and institutional reforms to enhance access to justice in the \nprovince. The total cost of the TA grant is estimated at $1.125 million equivalent, of which ADB \nhas been requested by the GoPb to finance $900,000 equivalent from its TA funding program. \nDetails of the PPTA grant are in Appendix 11. Appendix 12 presents a combined procurement \nplan for the TA loan and the two TA grants. \n \n129.  Advance Contracting. To expedite Program implementation, advance contracting will \nbe  undertaken  to  cover  the  engagement  of  consultants  under  the  ADTA  and  the  PPTA. \nAdvance action will include advertisements of consulting requirements for various components, \nand short-listing and recruitments of individual consultants. GoPb was informed that ADB\u2019s \napproval of the advance action is subject to approval of the proposed loans and grants and \ndoes not commit ADB to finance the Program, the TA loan or the related recruitment costs. \n   \nVI.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACT, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Program Benefits \n130.  The PGEIP is expected to yield significant benefits to the people of Punjab, specifically \nthe following:  \n \n(i)  More  efficient  allocation  of  public  resources. By integrating planning and \nbudgeting  processes,  the  Program  will  ensure  greater  cohesion  between \ndevelopment priorities and fiscal policy formulation. The adoption of the MTEF \nwill  make  budgeting  more  transparent  and  predictable,  and  the  infusion  of \nperformance orientation will strengthen fiscal discipline and accountability in the \nuse of public resources. All these intermediate outcomes will result in improved \ndelivery of public services. \n \n(ii)  Greater financial sustainability of the pension system. The Punjab has made \npioneering  efforts  in  this  direction.  Recognizing  the  significant  liabilities,  the \nprovincial government is committed to accelerating funding. The move will boost \ncivil  service  morale  by  ensuring  retirement  income  security,  ease  contingent \n ", "    31\nliability  management,  and  create  considerable  fiscal  space  for  pro-poor \nexpenditures. Longer-term benefits include the promotion of private saving and \nasset  accumulation,  which  will  in  turn  contribute  to  the  province\u2019s  economic \ngrowth, and to financial and private sector development. \n \n(iii)  An  efficient  and  effective  civil  service.  Improved  human  resource \nmanagement in the civil service will increase value for money for the province. \nEfficient institutional structures, faster business procedures, and improved skills \nand capacity in the public sector will result in efficiency gains and improved \nproductivity in the public sector, with consequent benefits in service delivery and \nprivate sector development.  \n \n(iv)  A dynamic private sector. A coherent private sector development strategy, an \nimproved regulatory framework, reduced government participation in the private \nsector, and greater compliance with international standards will facilitate private \nsector participation and result in greater efficiency and higher investment and \ngrowth  rates.  Likewise,  a  robust  public-private  partnership  framework  will \nmobilize  resources  toward  more  and  better-quality  infrastructure  and  social \nservices. \n \n131.  All the benefits will contribute to employment creation, broad-based economic growth, \nsocial  development,  and  poverty  reduction.  These  are  important  building  blocks  toward \nachieving the long-term goals outlined in Vision 2020 of significantly raising the living standards \nin the Punjab.  \n \nB.  Program Impact \n132.  Economic and Poverty Impact. The Program is expected to create significant positive \neconomic  impact  in  the  medium  to  long  term.  Improved  public  financial  management  will \nimprove efficiency, increase value for money of public spending, and generate resources for \ninvestment and development spending. The establishment of the PPF and GPIF will directly \ncontribute to investment and economic growth. The efficiency gains achieved through civil \nservice reforms and private sector development will further lead to productivity growth, and thus \nsustainable  economic  growth.  The  Program  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  through \neconomic  growth.  It  will  also  directly  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  through  resources \ngenerated for social and development spending, and through a more effective public sector that \nis geared toward service delivery outcomes. \n     \n133.  Institutional Impact. The PGEIP will contribute to institutional enhancement. Increased \ncoordination between planning and budgeting will promote a more holistic approach to public \nexpenditure  management,  with  significant  gains  in  terms  of  output-oriented  financial \nmanagement. The establishment of a professionally managed PPF and GPF will represent a \nkey milestone, and could potentially serve as a catalytic model for similar reforms at the federal \nlevel  and  in  other  provinces.  Civil  service  reforms  will  bring  across-the-board  institutional \ndevelopment in the public sector. Efforts to promote private sector development, such as the \nestablishment of the PPP cell, will strengthen the interface between the public and private \nsectors.  \n \n134.  Social Impact. The beneficial social impact of the PGEIP can arise from the following \nfactors. First of all, the introduction of more efficient public resource management practices \nthroughout  government  will  gradually  contribute  to  improvements  in  the  quality  of  service \n ", "32  \ndelivery, especially in key social sectors. Second, the improved pension system will strengthen \nthe social safety net. Lastly, the improved quality of life through higher economic and income \ngrowth will have an overall and direct impact on social outcomes. The detailed poverty reduction \nand social strategy of the Program is in Appendix 13. \n \n135.  Resettlement, Indigenous People, and the Environment. The PGEIP will cause no \ndirect or indirect involuntary resettlement, and will not lead to any issues affecting indigenous \npeoples (category C). The PGEIP is also unlikely to have any adverse environmental impact \n(category C). \n \nC.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n136.  The realization of the benefits and impact of the PGEIP depends on a number of \nassumptions and are subject to a variety of risks. Mitigating measures have accordingly been \nintegrated into the design of the Program. \n \n137.  Political Risks. Pakistan is in an election year and any political changes could have \nmajor administrative consequences. The caretaker setup expected to be in place later in 2007 \nmay not have the appetite for long-gestation reforms. However, the risk of reversing the broad \ndirections of reforms is low, given the present broad consensus on reforms among the major \npolitical players. The flexibility built into the single-tranche operations is also well suited to \naddressing the uncertainty arising in this context, as specific reform actions can be adjusted to \nreflect changes in the political environment.  \n \n138.  Governance Risks. Reforms could be undermined or delayed by vested interests that \nare threatened by greater transparency and accountability. However, strong ownership and \nsupport  at  the  highest  political  and  bureaucratic  levels,  coupled  with  gradually  improving \nincentives for better performance, will help mitigate this risk. The PDF that began in 2003 has \ninstitutionalized broad-based stakeholder participation, and the PGEIP design has been defined \nthrough this participative process.  \n \n139.  Implementation Risks. Insufficient capacity within the GoPb to handle the envisaged \nreforms could impede implementation. However, with the help of the TA loan under the PRMP, \nand by adopting effective procurement options and hiring the Singapore Civil Service College, \nthe PMU and departments have been able to overcome capacity limitations. Enhancing IA \nownership of the Program is also a key method of mitigating implementation risks.  \n \n140.  External  and  Macroeconomic  Risks.  Despite  uncertainty  in  the  geopolitical \nenvironment, the external environment in recent years has been largely favorable to Pakistan \nand the country has had strong macroeconomic indicators in the past 5 years. However, while \nstructural reforms are beginning to show positive results, poverty levels and inequality remain \nhigh and must be reduced. The widening trade imbalance and current account deficit, insecurity \nin the region, and the cost of earthquake reconstruction accentuate the macroeconomic risks. \nSome of the risks are beyond the control of the federal Government and the GoPb, but prudent \neconomic  management  strategies  can  mitigate  macroeconomic  vulnerability.  Significant \nincreases in the expenditure allocations for the social sectors and direct poverty reduction \nmeasures will lead to higher poverty reduction impact. \n   \n ", "    33\nVII.  ASSURANCES \n141.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government of Pakistan has given the \nfollowing assurances, which are to be incorporated into the legal documents:  \n \n(i)  Counterpart funds will be used to meet the reform and other financing needs \nrelating to the implementation of the PGEIP. \n(ii)  The  prior  actions  and  related  policy  reforms  undertaken  to  satisfy  the  prior \nactions in the SP1 policy matrix in Appendix 7 and allow the program loan \nagreement to take effect shall be sustained for the duration of the PGEIP and \nbeyond.  \n(iii)  The Planning Commission pro-forma II for the TA loan will have been approved \nby the Provincial Development Working Party.  \n \n142.  The Government has also given the following additional specific assurances with respect \nto the allocation of resources from the PGEIP proceeds for purposes of accelerating the funding \nof the civil service pension system: \n \n(i)  There is currently an existing allocation in the Public Accounts of PRs12 billion \n(approximately $200 million) to the PPF and the GPIF.  Although the allocation \nhas been made, the amount has yet to be transferred to the PPF and the GPIF.  \nPunjab will transfer the amounts for this allocation to the accounts of the PPF \nand  the  GPIF  in  commercial  bank(s)  that  meets  the  prudential  regulatory \nrequirements of the State Bank of Pakistan before the end of financial year \n2009\u20132010 through (for the avoidance of doubt, the eventual apportionment of \nthe amounts between the PPF and the GPIF will be determined by Punjab): \n \n(a)   PRs6 billion (about $101.7 million) before the end of FY2008\u20132009, and \n \n(b)  PRs6 billion (about $101.7 million) before the end of FY2009\u20132010. \n \n(ii)  In capitalizing the PPF and the GPIF with a minimum aggregate amount of \nPRs100 billion (about $1.7 billion) by FY2015\u20132016, of which the equivalent of \nPRs5.9 billion ($100 million) will be derived from the counterpart funds (to avoid \ndoubt, the eventual apportionment of the aggregate amount between the PPF \nand the GPIF will be determined by the GoPb), the GoPb will:  \n \n(a)   allocate PRs6 billion (about $101.7 million) for FY2007\u20132008;  \n \n(b)  through  the  Medium-Term  Budget  Framework  for  FY2008\u20132009  to \nFY2010\u20132011, allocate PRs8 billion (about $135.6 million) for FY2008\u2013\n2009, PRs10 billion (about $169.5 million) for FY2009\u20132010, and PRs14 \nbillion (about $237.3 million) for FY2010\u20132011;  \n \n(c)  through  the  Medium-Term  Budget  Framework  for  FY2011\u20132012  to \nFY2013\u20132014, allocate an amount proportionate to the Punjab\u2019s budget \nfor each such financial year, such amounts to be of an increasing order; \nand \n \n(d)  through  the  Medium-Term  Budget  Framework  for  FY2014\u20132015  to \nFY2016\u20132017, allocate an amount proportionate to Punjab\u2019s budget for \n ", "34  \nFY2014\u20132015  and  2015\u20132016,  such  amounts  to  be  of  an  increasing \norder.  \n \n(iii)  To capitalize the PPF and the GPIF, as described in the previous paragraph, the \nGoPb will: \n \n(a)  append  the  Funding  Strategy  to  the  respective  Medium-Term  Budget \nFrameworks; and \n(b)  transfer the respective amounts to the accounts of the PPF and the GPIF \nin commercial bank(s) that meets the prudential regulatory requirements \nof the State Bank of Pakistan before the end of the respective fiscal year. \n \nVIII.

Achievements of the Punjab in the Punjab Resource Management Program and \nPunjab Devolved Social Services Program  \n1.  Punjab  Resource  Management  Program.  Enhancing  the  effectiveness  of  public \nfinancial management in the Punjab has been the principal objective of the Punjab Resource \nManagement Program (PRMP). Under subprogram (SP) 1 of PRMP (covering reforms over \nJanuary 2003\u2013June 2005), the government of the Punjab (GoPb) launched and implemented a \nrange of key reform measures focused on fiscal restructuring to boost revenue generation and \nexpenditure rationalization, and private sector development. Under SP2 of PRMP (July 2005\u2013\nJune 2007) the government carried forward the reforms focusing on (i) creating fiscal space, (ii) \nimproving efficiency and transparency in the allocation and use of funds, (iii) increasing the pro-\npoor impact of public spending and service delivery, and (iv) creating an enabling environment \nfor private sector development. \n \n2.  Creating fiscal space was a major objective of the PRMP. Measures to enhance revenue \nmobilization included the rationalization of the tax structure, and analytical work in preparation \nfor the reorganization of the Excise and Taxation Department to increase efficiency in tax \ncollection.  Rationalization  of  expenditure  was  achieved  primarily  through  the  reduction  of \ninterest payments by swapping high-interest cash development loans (CDLs) from the federal \nGovernment  with  less-costly  borrowings  from  international  donors.  During  the  PRMP, \n$300 million  in  CDLs  was  retired  by  the  provincial  government.  The  introduction  of  a \nmedium-term framework in fiscal planning and budgeting represents a key achievement under \nthe PRMP. The Finance Department (FD) prepared the first medium-term budget framework \n(MTBF) in fiscal year (FY) 2004, which included 3-year annual rolling estimates of the main \ncategories of revenues and expenditures. The Planning and Development Department (P&DD) \nprepared a medium-term development framework (MTDF) for the first time in FY2006.   \n \n3.  Civil service reforms under the PRMP emphasized capacity building of civil servants, \nespecially through international exposure for senior public servants. A training relationship has \nbeen established with the Singapore Civil Service College. A civil service census of provincial \ngovernment has been pilot-tested in one district government. A number of measures were also \ntaken  to  facilitate  private  sector  development,  including  (i)  pilot-testing  of  public-private \npartnership models in the health sector, (ii) completion of an assessment of the provincial policy \nenvironment  and  cost  of  doing  business,  and  (iii)  strengthening  of  property  rights  though \nimproved land titling.  \n \n4.  By taking a holistic approach to a wide range of reform areas, the PRMP has laid a firm \nbasis for public resource management reforms in the Punjab. Strengthening public resource \nmanagement, however, is a complex and gradual process that requires long-term commitment. \nThe devolution process has also brought about new challenges that require realignment of \npower and responsibilities between the provincial and local governments. Building on the reform \noutcomes over 2003\u20132007, the GoPb now wishes to undertake a range of second-generation \nreforms to deal effectively with the challenges it faces. \n \n5.  Achievements of Punjab Devolved Social Services Program. Pakistan introduced \nsweeping devolution reforms in 2001. A key objective underpinning devolution is improved \nsocial  service  delivery.  Poor  social  service  delivery,  and  the  resultant  lack  of  human \ndevelopment, has been a major cause of poverty. Devolution was intended to significantly \n ", " 40  Appendix 2 \n \nenhance service delivery by bringing service providers and governments closer to citizens than \nthey had been under a centralized system. The loans for the Punjab Devolved Social Services \nProgram (PDSSP) 1 were designed within this broad context. The program was approved on \n20 December 2004, and the first tranche was released on 26 December 2005. The release of \nthe second tranche is currently under consideration.  \n \n6.  PDSSP is a multi-sector and multidimensional governance reform program. It seeks to \nstrengthen devolved social services for more equitable, efficient, effective, and sustainable \ndelivery of social services in line with Punjab Local Government Ordinance (PLGO) 2001. It \naddresses governance, financing, and technical constraints on devolved service delivery in the \nhealth, education, special education, and water supply and sanitation sectors. Reforms under \nPDSSP seek three principal policy outcomes:  \n \n(i)  realigning intergovernmental relations to support devolved social services, \n(ii)  rationalizing and setting minimum standards for social services, and  \n(iii)  strengthening  public  accountability  mechanisms  and  promoting  public-private \npartnerships.  \n \n7.  Various initiatives have been implemented under the PDSSP. Some key achievements \nto date are highlighted below. \n \n8.  Articulating  and  Clarifying  Devolution.  Local  governments  initially  faced  huge \nproblems in comprehending devolution. There was a lack of understanding about devolved \nfinancial and administrative powers. To facilitate the working of devolution and local government, \na  compendium  of  local  government  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  has  been  prepared  and \npublished by PDSSP. The document has been circulated free of cost to all local governments. It \nhas effectively helped explain devolution to provincial and local governments.  \n \n9.  Instituting Planning. Local government planning capacity was practically nonexistent \nbefore the implementation of the PDSSP. Under the PDSSP, local government planning has \nreceived  tremendous  impetus  from  the  annual  sector  planning  (ASP)  process.  Through \nintensive training, capacity building, and strong emphasis on ASP, the PDSSP has introduced \nguidelines for planning, initiated the annual planning process, and instituted planning practice at \nthe local government level.  \n \n10.  In addition to ASP, the PDSSP also supported strategic planning over the medium term. \nThe medium-term development strategic directions for the four social sectors covered by the \nPDSSP have found fully expression in the development of the MTDF. The MTDF has also \nbecome a key instrument for linking expenditure with improvements in service delivery. \n \n11.  Bridging Financing Gaps and Introducing Rules-Based Resource Allocation. The \nPDSSP introduced the concept of resource allocation to local governments through conditional \ngrants. These have made possible timely and assured transfers of funds to local governments in \na transparent manner, helped to bridge financing gaps, assisted the local governments in \nimproving social service delivery, and paved the way for introducing transparent rules-based \nresource allocation.  \n \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2004.

Manila. \n ", "       Appendix 2      41 \n12.  Addressing Human Resource Constraints. With the requirements of the PDSSP, the \nGoPb has filled a large number of vacancies in the four social sectors. These have helped \nalleviate capacity constraints on service delivery. \n \n13.  Introducing Service Delivery Standards. For the first time, service delivery standards \nhave been introduced for social service delivery in the health, education, special education, and \nwater supply and sanitation sectors in the province. The development and enforcement of \ntechnical and service standards are important instruments for improving the quality of services. \nThe  standards  provide  benchmarks  for  regulators,  service  providers,  and  users.  Setting \ntechnical  and  service  standards  is  especially  important  in  the  post-devolution  era  as  the \nprovincial government becomes less directly involved with service delivery, while assuming a \nmore important role as policy maker, regulator, and standard setter.  \n \n14.  Improving Service Delivery. On the important objective of improving service delivery, \nthough only very limited data are currently available, there is tentative evidence to suggest that \nsocial  service  delivery  has  improved  since  devolution  in  2001.  For  example,  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB)-Department for International Development (DFID)-World Bank report \nDevolution in Pakistan (2004)2 notes that the efforts of the monitoring committee have resulted \nin improved attendance of staff working in social sectors. Furthermore, health sector employees \nare  now  more  likely  to  visit  health  facilities  than  before  devolution.  The  Social  Audit  of \nGovernance and Delivery of Public Services of the Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n de Enfermedades \nTropicales3 found  that  overall  satisfaction  with  government  health  facilities  increased  by  5 \npercentage points in 2004 over the 2002 figure to reach 70%. More rigorous empirical analysis \nis required to assess the impact of devolution on service delivery (footnote 2). Supported by \nADB TA 4504 under PDSSP, the Punjab is undertaking a second multiple-indicator cluster \nsurvey. This will help generate the necessary data for assessing changes in service delivery.  \n \n15.  Strengthening Monitoring. The development of service standards has been coupled \nwith the development of systematic monitoring frameworks for provincial and local governments. \nThese measures have helped improve the accountability mechanisms of both provincial and \nlocal governments.  \n \n16.  Enhancing  Public-Private  Partnerships.  The  development  of  public-private \npartnerships (PPPs) has the potential to increase the pool of resources, mitigate risks through \nrisk sharing, and enhance the efficiency of service delivery. In the Punjab, private participation \nin the health and education sectors has become increasingly significant. With the increased \ninterest in PPPs, the province urgently needs a comprehensive PPP policy and regulatory \nframework to guide PPP practice. The PDSSP supported the development of a well-defined \nPPP  strategy.  This  has  also  gone  a  long  way  toward  institutionalizing  PPPs,  augmenting \nresources for public service delivery, and improving efficiency. \n \n17.  Setting a Road Map for Devolution. The promulgation of PLGO 2001 and subordinate \nlegislation since 2001 has enabled the devolution of administrative and financial powers to local \ngovernments. However, local governments still face problems in implementing these powers. It \nis thus critical that the gaps in implementing devolution are identified and plugged to enable \nlocal governments to perform their functions effectively.

Overall, the PDSSP has helped lay a broad foundation for devolution and improved \nservice delivery in Pakistan. Since devolution is a complex process involving institutional as well \nas  cultural  change,  it  requires  persistent  efforts  over  the  medium  to  long  term.  The  key \nchallenges facing the PDSSP are to sustain achievements and deepen devolution. Concerted \nand  persistent  efforts  are  required  to  advance  devolution  and  improve  service  delivery  in \nPakistan significantly beyond the initiatives under the PDSSP.  \n \n19.  Building on the broad institutional and technical frameworks on devolution that have \nbeen put in place by PDSSP, second-generation reforms to improve services need to probe in \nmore depth and address sector-specific issues in a focused manner. Health sector reforms are \nespecially important in this context, given the World Bank\u2019s deep involvement in the education \nsector,  and  the  relatively  poor  health  sector  indicators  in  the  province.  The  millennium \ndevelopment goal (MDG) program, focusing on health, is proposed with this consideration in \nmind. \n \nII.  Sector Analysis \n \nA.  Public Resource Management: A Conceptual Framework  \n \n20.  Public resource management is the primary tool for a country\u2019s economic management \nand public service delivery. Fiscal management and the quality of civil service are the two core \nelements of effective public resource management. Fiscal management consists of systems and \nprocedures for medium-term planning and budgeting, as well as measures aimed at fiscal space \ncreation  through  public  expenditure  management  and  revenue  generation  reform.  Public \nexpenditure  management  tools  include  expenditure  compression,  rationalization,  and \nprioritization measures. Expenditure compression is aimed at reducing nonproductive spending \n(e.g., interest payments), while expenditure rationalization and prioritization include streamlining \nthe current expenditure pattern to make it more efficient and aligned with the government\u2019s \ndevelopment  priorities  (e.g.,  pension  reform,  salary  and  wage  reform,  and  divestment  of \nloss-making state-owned enterprises). Revenue-generation measures represent another tool for \nfiscal space creation. They consist mainly of initiatives to increase the revenue yield of taxes \nand fees raised by the government (e.g., tax policy and tax administration reform, and reform of \nuser fees).  \n \n21.  The quality of the civil service is the second main pillar of public resource management, \nas it critically affects government\u2019s efficiency and effectiveness in attaining its fiscal policy goals, \nand  ultimately  its  responsiveness  to  citizens\u2019  needs.  A  well-functioning  civil  service  would \nenable the government to attract and retain qualified and competent staff and to hold them \naccountable for results while benefiting the citizens through improved public service delivery.  \n \n22.  Private sector development can also play a key role in enhancing the efficiency of public \nresource management by improving the revenue-generating capacity and enabling a more \nefficient allocation of resources across competing priorities. On the one hand, private sector\u2013led \ngrowth would enlarge the tax base of the economy and increase the revenue yield. On the other \nhand, a dynamic and vibrant private sector would allow public sector disengagement from the \nprovision of goods and services that do not justify public sector involvement. This would in turn \ncreate fiscal space for the provision of public service services and government spending in \npro-poor sectors.  \n ", "       Appendix 2      43 \nB.  Sector Background, Key Challenges, and Recent Achievements \n1.  Medium-Term Planning and Budgeting \n23.  A growing number of developing countries have adopted the medium-term expenditure \nframework (MTEF)4 to increase predictability in resource allocation, and to strengthen the links \nbetween policy, planning, and budgeting. Recent studies5 have highlighted the importance of a \ngood macro-fiscal model and solid budget management and execution practices as two key \nenabling conditions for the successful implementation of MTEF.  \n  \n24.  Weak  Budget  Preparation  and  Execution  and  Poor  Performance  Orientation. \nDevelopment expenditure is specifically related to investment in the development of physical or \nhuman resources through defined projects. In this sense it must be distinguished from the \naccounting distinction between current and capital expenditure. A development project may \ninvolve both recurrent and capital elements.  \n \n25.  The recurrent budget refers to expenditures that are recurrent in nature and are further \ndistinguished between regular and new expenditures. Budget submissions are made separately \nfor the two expenditures, and priority in reviewing budget submissions is typically directed to the \nnew expenditure. Regular expenditure is increased to reflect pay and price increases but is \nassumed to be necessary and not subject to in-depth scrutiny. New expenditure may arise as a \nresult of a development project with recurrent expenditure implications. When the project is \ncompleted it is treated as new expenditure on the recurrent budget for a 3-year period before \nbeing absorbed into the regular budget if its continuation is still justified.6  \n \n26.  The annual budget statement in its current format does not provide a transparent picture \nof the allocation of resources across sectors and spending categories. Expenditures are only \naggregated  along  functional  classifications,  which  do  not  provide  information  about  the \ncomposition of expenditures as would be captured from the economic classification. In the \nannual budget statement there is no overall summary statement giving an overview of the \ngovernment budget in terms of surplus or deficit. \n \n27.  On 1 November the budget call circular (BCC) is circulated to each department. It sets \nout the standard forms for preparing the budget proposals, together with guidelines for their \ncompletion. The recurrent budget submissions are received and adjusted by the Budget Wing of \nthe  FD.7 There  are  no  formal  meetings  with  departments  to  negotiate  changes  in  the \nsubmissions, though informal contact may be made. In the case of development expenditure, \nthe departmental submissions are examined in the P&DD. The BCC was updated in 2005/2006 \nto reflect the move to collect data for the MTBF, and included nonfinancial data relating to \n                                                 \n4  In the literature, the term \u201cmedium-term budget framework\u201d (MTBF) is sometimes used interchangeably with \n\u201cMTEF.\u201d   \n5  For a comprehensive review of cross-country experience with MTEF implementation, see Le Houerou, P., and R. \nTaliercio. 2002. MTEF: From Concept to Practice\u2014Preliminary Lessons from Africa. Africa Region Working Paper \nSeries No. 28. World Bank, Washington, DC.  \n6  The main linkage between the recurrent and development budgets arises from the fact that though there is an \nelement of external donor funding for the development budget, the greater part of it is funded from the surplus on \nthe provincial revenue account and also from any balance on the public account. Therefore, the amount available \nfor development is determined by the FD, taking into account the total budget available and deducting the amount \nrequired for nondevelopment. \n7  For the regular budget, consideration is given to the overall increase compared with the previous year and to \nspecific increases in line items. For new expenditure, documentary evidence of the need for and approval of such \nexpenditure is examined. \n ", " 44  Appendix 2 \n \ndepartmental  visions,  goals,  objectives,  and  targets.  However,  there  appears  to  be  little \nresponse to requests for nonfinancial information8. As the P&DD circulates another form to \ncollect information for inclusion in the annual development program and the MTDF, departments \nmay see the budget circular forms as duplication. There is a clear need to review and improve \nthe BCC. \n \n28.  Budget execution monitoring is limited to an assessment of actual spending versus \nbudget allocation for the purpose of updating budget estimates. Heads of departments submit \nthe first statement of excess and surrenders (SES) on 1 January and the second SES on 31 \nMarch. These contain details of the actual expenditure of the first 4 and the first 8 months of the \nfiscal year, respectively. The SES does not represent an instrument for monitoring budget \nperformance and devising corrective actions. On the basis of the SES, the FD revises the \nbudget estimates (revised estimates and final revised estimates, respectively) for the current \nfiscal year, while heads of departments assess the need for additional grants, and hence for \nsubmitting a supplementary budget request.  \n \n29.  The  Auditor  General  of  Pakistan  audits  the  accounts  of \nthe provincial government, the district governments, and other government entities. Under the \nWorld  Bank\u2013supported  Project  for  Improvement  of  Financial  Reporting  and  Accountability \n(PIFRA), the accounting and auditing functions have been separated.9 In the Punjab, accounts \nauditing  has  experienced  considerable  delays.  For  FY2004\u20132005,  the  submission  of  the \nprovincial accounts audit report was delayed by more than 12 months, while the backlog in \nfollow-up to audit reports was as high as 11 years. Two public accounts committees have been \ncreated to fast-track the review of audit reports and audited accounts.  \n \n30.  Limited Integration between Budgeting and Medium-Term Planning. The objective \nof  MTEF  is  to:  (i)  enforce  fiscal  discipline  through  the  control  of  aggregate  expenditures, \n(ii) support  the  strategic  allocation  of  resources  to  sectors,  and  (iii)  ensure  cost-effective \nimplementation of programs and service delivery.  \n \n31.  The implementation of MTEF requires interaction among the central departments (FD \nand P&DD), the line departments, and the local governments. Effective MTEF requires:  (i) \nsound and reliable forecasts of resources available over the medium term,  (ii)  a transparent \nmechanism for determining the sectoral allocation of resources,  (iii) capacity to enforce the \nsectoral allocation as either hard or soft budget ceilings, (iv) performance-based budgeting \nrelating the recurrent and development budgets to performance targets and indicators, and (v) a \nbudget data recording system, which captures financial and nonfinancial data that feed into \nmedium-term estimates of available resources.  \n \n32.  The MTBF contains sectoral expenditure allocations for the nondevelopment budget, but \nit is difficult to relate these allocations directly to the annual budget statement, as the manner of \npresentation is different and they are not currently used to provide departments with ceilings or \nguidelines for budget preparation.10  \n \n                                                 \n8  This may be due to the way the forms are designed, as they do not clearly specify the nature of the information to \nbe included in them, and to the lack of training and awareness provided for this purpose. \n9  A district audit function has been established and auditing methods have been updated and are compatible with \nthe Financial Audit Manual (2005), though this has not yet been fully applied throughout the provincial government, \nespecially in respect of the performance audit procedure. \n10  The sector totals comprise a grouping of departments together with district budgets and would therefore need to be \ndisaggregated to feed into the budget process.  \n ", "       Appendix 2      45 \n33.  Performance-based budgeting (PBB) allows the formulation of budget estimates in line \nwith the cost of the resources necessary to deliver a desired standard of services. The dual \nbudget process in the Punjab undermines the scope of PBB as its incremental approach makes \nit difficult to align the resource envelope with the service delivery goals. Likewise, the separation \nbetween recurrent and development budgets hampers a comprehensive assessment of the \ncross-budgetary implications of the activities underlying public service delivery.  \n \n34.  Low  Value  for  Money  in  Public  Service  Delivery.  The  devolution  process  has \nincreased the responsibility of local governments in the delivery of essential public services: \nhealth care and education are the primary responsibility of district governments, while water \nsupply and sanitation are the responsibility of the tehsil municipal administrations (TMAs) 11  and \nthe union councils.  \n \n35.  The  capacity  of  local  governments  to  allocate  scarce  resources  in  line  with  the \ndevelopment priorities is weak. Under the devolved system, the zila nazim (elected district \nrepresentative) enjoys relative autonomy in the definition of budget allocation and the budget is \nsubject solely to approval from the district council. To date, though district governments are \nresponsible for the delivery of basic education and health services, their budget estimates are \nnot based on desired standards of services. A system for assessing the cost of providing \nservices is currently not in place, and this further exacerbates the disconnect between allocated \nresources and the funds needed to meet their service delivery obligations. \n \n36.  Recent  Achievements.  The first MTBF was published by the FD in August 2004. \nHowever, the ultimate purpose of the MTBF exercise has been undermined by the fact that it \nhas not been updated yearly, and thus does not provide a realistic assessment of the resources \navailable over the medium term. A new MTBF for FY2008 to FY2010 has been approved by the \nFD. An MTBF cell tasked with producing the MTBF has also been created within the FD. This \ncell is still not fully staffed, however, and terms of reference and job descriptions have not been \nprepared.   \n \n37.  The first MTDF was published in FY2006. Unlike the MTBF, the MTDF is updated yearly \nand the published MTDF documentation provides an overview of the sectoral visions, strategies, \nand key targets for the period. An MTDF cell has also been established in the P&DD to \nformulate the MTDF, monitor its execution, and coordinate with other divisions in P&DD. In this \ncase as well, however, operationalization of the MTDF cell has been very limited.  \n \n38.  Since  FY2006,  sector  departments  have  been  requested  to  submit  details  of  the \nperformance targets to be achieved through the execution of Annual Development Program. \nThese targets are anchored in the MDGs, though it is not clear to what extent they are costed, \nand hence whether they are linked to development expenditure estimates.  \n \n39.  The Department of Irrigation and Power (DI&P) has already established a Strategy and \nPlanning and Reform Unit with assistance from the Irrigation Development Policy Loan of the \nWorld Bank, with the objective of strategic planning, monitoring and evaluation, and facilitation \nin the implementation of various activities of the reform program under the Development Policy \nLoan. \n \n                                                 \n11 TMA is the second layer of the local government system created by the devolution. The local government system \nincludes district governments, TMAs, and union councils. \n ", " 46  Appendix 2 \n \n40.  In 2005, the Department of Health (DOH) established a Policy and Strategy Support Unit \nresponsible for (i) developing DOH policy priorities and transforming policy statements into \nimplementation plans; (ii) organizing, managing, and coordinating technical support in the health \nsector and building local capacity accordingly; and (iii) fostering a culture of participatory and \ninformation-based  decision  making  and  needs-based  data  collection  in  the  health  sector. \nAlthough  some  progress  was  made  in  the  establishment  of  the  unit,  changes  in  political \ncircumstances have stalled its operationalization.   \n \n41.  The Local Government Planning Manual has been developed with assistance from the \nDecentralization Support Program of ADB. The manual is a tool to support bottom-up planning \nwithin the context of the devolved services system and to integrate provincial policy priorities \ninto local governments\u2019 actions and decisions.  \n \n42.  In  an  effort  to  increase  its  revenue-generation  capacity,  the  GoPb  has  adopted \nsignificant  reforms  in  its  tax  policy  and  tax  administration  procedures.  These  include  the \nsimplification and rationalization of both the urban immovable property tax and the stamp duty. \nTo streamline tax administration, a time-bound action plan for the reorganization of the Excise \nand  Taxation  Department  and  the  automation  of  tax  assessment  and  collection has  been \nprepared and approved.    \n \n2.  Civil Service Pension System \n43.  The GoPb is the largest employer in Pakistan, with about one million civil servants and \nabout 388,000 pensioners (including retired employees, and spouses and eligible dependents of \ndeceased employees). The pension system rests on two main pillars: the Punjab pension \nsystem  (PPS)  and  the  General  Provident  Fund  (GPF).  Membership  in  both  schemes  is \nmandatory. Since 2005, most civil servants have been hired on a contractual basis and are not \nentitled to PPS and GPF benefits, receiving instead a 30% salary premium. About 50,000 civil \nservants have been contractual employees since 2005.  \n \n44.  The PPS is a noncontributory, unfunded defined-benefits system financed from current \ngovernment revenues. The normal retirement age is 60, subject to the employee\u2019s having \ncompleted 10 years of service. Individual benefit levels are determined by a formula that takes \ninto account the final wage and the length of service. The replacement rate is capped at 70% (of \nthe basic wage in the final year) for a worker with 30 years of service. Up to 35% of the pension \ncan be commuted and taken as a lump sum, and the remainder is paid as an annuity until death. \n \n45.  The  GPF  is  an  employee-only  contributory  scheme.  Civil  servants  are  required  to \ncontribute 3\u20138% of basic salary to the GPF, and the contributions are notionally housed in \nindividual accounts. Aside from book entry, employee contributions are not kept separately, and \nare included in the provincial government\u2019s consolidated accounts. Accumulated funds are not \ninvested to meet pension obligations, which like the liabilities under the PPS, are financed \nthrough the general budget. The government determines the rate of return on employees\u2019 GPF \ncontributions each year, which is currently around 11%. Workers can borrow from their accounts \nup to age 50 for specific purposes such as illness and related travel, overseas travel related to a \ndependent\u2019s education, marriages and funerals, and purchase of land, house, and vehicles. \nAfter age 50, members can borrow up to 60% of the balance without having to give a reason or \npay back the advance. After age 55, an advance of up to 80% of the balance can be made, \nagain with no need to repay the advance. Any remaining balance can be taken as a lump sum \nat the age of 60 or a year before retirement. \n \n ", "       Appendix 2      47 \n46.  Two other benefit schemes are available to the employees of the GoPb: the Benevolent \nFund (BF) and the Central Employees Insurance Fund (CEIF). The BF covers all civil servants \nexcept the police and the Population Welfare Department. Civil servants contribute 2% of their \nbasic pay, and receive a range of benefits such as a monthly payment to dependents on death \nin service, marriage benefits, funeral grants, and education scholarships. The deductions for the \nCEIF are paid as premiums to State Life Insurance, and provide a death benefit.  \n \n47.  Unfunded Pension System. As highlighted above, both the PPS and the GPF are \nunfunded schemes financed through the provincial budget. Preliminary estimates indicate that \nthe government\u2019s pension liabilities could be as high as PRs400 billion. The outstanding GPF \nbalance, including contributions and interest credited, is reported at PRs17 billion. Pension \noutlays  have  escalated  in  recent  years,  and  increased  from  PRs1.7  billion  in  FY1991  to \nPRs12.6 billion in FY2006. Interest payments on GPF balances have likewise increased sharply \nand  amounted  to  PRs4.5  billion  in  FY2006.  GPF  interest  payments  currently  exceed \ncontribution, and the net outflow is projected to rise in the coming years. \n \n48.  The GoPb recognizes that its pension obligations have important implications for the \nfinances  of  the  province,  and  that  pension  expenditures,  if  unchecked,  could  crowd  out \ninvestment in the infrastructure and social sectors. Urgent reforms are therefore needed to \nensure the financial sustainability of the pension system, and to create the fiscal space for \npriority development expenditures.  \n \n49.  Weak Record-Keeping, Administration , and Payment System.  In  its  payroll \nfunctions,  the  Office  of  the  Accountant  General,  Punjab  (AGP)  records  civil  servants\u2019 \nemployment data, including name, identification number, date of employment, wage history, and, \nas applicable, the date of retirement, termination of employment, or death. At retirement, the \nworker makes an application with the Office of the AGP, which calculates the worker\u2019s benefits \nand creates a payment booklet. To collect the monthly benefit the pensioner (or dependent) \nmust present the payment booklet to a designated payment agent at a branch of the National \nBank of Pakistan (NBP).  \n \n50.  An effective pension system requires: (i) a system for accurately recording employment \nhistory and employee contribution, and calculating benefits; and (ii) a system for ensuring timely \npayment of benefits to pensioners. The calculation of pension benefits is based on the length of \nservice and final salaries. The calculation of GPF balances is relatively more complex, requiring \ninformation on (i) deductions of monthly contributions from payroll based on grades, (ii) crediting \nof  yearly  interest  on  the  balances,  and  (iii)  advances  against  balances  and  repayment  of \nadvances.  The  system  of  record-keeping  and  benefit  calculations  in  the  Punjab  is  largely \nmanual  and  paper-based.  The  absence  of  a  robust  record-keeping  and  management \ninformation  system,  combined  with  weak  accounting  and  actuarial  analysis  capacity,  has \nresulted in problems regarding the accuracy of pension entitlement calculation and individual \npayments. Cases of missing contributions, and therefore missing investment returns on the GPF, \nare common. There is no formal mechanism for a pensioner to initiate an inquiry or an appeals \nprocess when such omissions occur.  \n \n51.  Pension disbursement through a designated branch of NBP is costly because of the \ncumbersome identification and entitlement verification processes. The payment agent identifies \nthe retiree through the latter\u2019s identification card and payment booklet, makes the payment, and \nrecords the payment in the payment booklet and on the form obtained from the Office of the \nAGP. A copy of the form is retained by the payment agent and another copy is routed to the \nOffice of the AGP. The present system generates a payment notice to the authorized NBP \n ", " 48  Appendix 2 \n \nbranch  for  each  transaction  and  does  not  include  monthly  authorized  allocations.  This \narrangement not only further increases the cost of pension disbursement, but also makes the \nsystem  more  error-prone.  Moreover,  there  is no  mechanism  for  triggering  an  action  when \nquestionable  transactions  occur.  Thus  leakages  from  the  system,  in  the  form  of  \u201cghost \npensioners,\u201d are results in significant and entail considerable cost to the taxpayer. The system \nof pension payments is weaker in rural areas because of the lack of adequate staff resources in \nbank branches.  \n \n52.  Weak Benefit Structure. Certain features of the current pension scheme have led to \ninequitable and arbitrary outcomes at the individual level. For instance, the last pay drawn for an \nemployee is used as the basis for calculating the pension. This can favor those who get a pay \nraise or a promotion immediately before retirement. The international best practice is to use \naverage earnings over several years as the basis. Increases in pension benefits, to compensate \nfor changes in the cost of living, are made ad hoc, and often trail inflation. Interest payments on \nGPF contributions are likewise ad hoc and unpredictable. Currently, up to 35% of the pension \ncan be commuted and taken as a lump sum, with the remainder paid as an annuity until death. \nThe commutation allowance is high by international standards, and may not be consistent with \nthe public policy objective of facilitating consumption-smoothing and ensuring adequate old-age \nincome for civil servants. \n \n53.  Those who joined the civil service after 2004 are employed on a contractual basis and \ndo not receive pension and GPF benefits. Over 50,000 employees thus far are affected by this \narrangement. There are now growing concerns regarding workplace morale, and the social and \npolitical implications of having a significant proportion of civil servants with little or no savings \nand no pension benefits.  \n \n54.  The pension rules were established in the 1960s, and the GPF rules in the 1970s. \nThough  certain  modifications  have  been  introduced  since,  there  is  an  urgent  need  for  a \ncomprehensive review of the two schemes to assess their continued relevance in the current \nsocioeconomic context. \n \n55.  Recent  Achievements.  As  the  first  step  toward  a  funded  scheme,  the  GoPb \npromulgated the Punjab Pension Fund (PPF) Act in March 2006. The PPF Act provides the \nlegal basis for the establishment of a corporate body with the objective of generating resources \nthrough  fund  investment  to  discharge  the  pension  liability  of  the  province.  The  General \nProvident Investment Fund (GPIF) Act has been submitted to the provincial assembly. The \nobjective of the GPIF is to generate investment returns for the payment of benefits under the \nGPF pillar. Implementing Rules\u2014specifying fiduciary requirements, exposure limits and risk \nmanagement, accounting and auditing, internal controls, and compliance\u2014for both the PPF Act \nand the draft GPIF Act have been adopted. \n \n56.  To date, the GoPb has earmarked PRs8 billion for the capitalization of the PPF and \nPRs4 billion for the GPIF. The GoPb is committed to allocating budget resources to reach a \nminimum capitalization of PRs100 billion by FY2015/2016, and has recently completed an \nactuarial valuation, and adopted a funding strategy for PPF and GPIF.   \n \n57.  Steps  toward  starting  investment  operations  have  also  been  initiated.  Management \ncommittee members, including private sector representatives, have been appointed, and the \nselection of the managing director is under way.  \n \n ", "       Appendix 2      49 \n3.  Civil Service Reform \n58.  The public sector employs about 11% of employed workers in Punjab. This number \nincludes about 967,000 in sanctioned posts in government departments and more than 100,000 \nemployees  in  the  123  public  sector  autonomous  bodies.  While  the  share  is  moderate,  it \nunderstates the importance of the public sector as a major formal sector employer, given that \nself-employment accounts for about 60% of total employment. The civil service wage bill and \npensions account for about 59% of total consolidated recurrent expenditure. The need to reform \nthe civil service has been felt both at the national and the provincial levels. Despite various \nattempts, the common perception is that the system remains similar to that inherited from \nPakistan\u2019s colonial  past.  A  recent  survey  by  Pakistan  Institute of Development  Economics \nindicates widespread negative perception and general discontent about public services, on the \none hand, and disillusionment of civil servants themselves, on the other. Some of the main \nissues in the Punjab context are discussed below. \n \n59.  Weak  Recruitment,  Performance  Evaluation,  and  Promotion.  An  effective \nrecruitment system is essential for ensuring the quality of entry of civil servants. In the Punjab, \nthe recruitment of public servants for basic pay scale (BPS) 1712 and above is carried out by the \nPunjab Public Service Commission (PPSC). It is widely acknowledged that the commission \nfaces  challenges  because  of  structural,  capacity,  and  procedural  constraints.  Similarly, \nperformance evaluation has not served as an effective tool for performance monitoring. A large \nproportion of civil servants do not have job descriptions, let alone targets for achievement. The \nexisting annual confidential report is commonly regarded as a compliance task and not useful as \na record of performance evaluation. Further, in a system in which promotions are essentially \nbased on seniority, performance evaluations play a limited role in career progression. The \npresent cadre system also places more weight on recruiting senior management from the elite \ngroups and not enough on seeking out management talent from specialist groups or from \noutside the civil service.  \n \n60.  Uncompetitive Compensation and Benefits. There is substantial evidence that the \nreal  compensation  gap  between  public  and  private  salaries  and  emoluments  has  steadily \nincreased.  Moreover,  the  compensation  structure  of  wages  is  not  closely  linked  with \nperformance and does not provide adequate incentives for good performance. The provincial \ngovernment  has  no  control  over  civil  service  salary  scales,  which  are  set  by  the  federal \nGovernment.  It  can,  however,  create  contract  positions  outside  the  cadre  scales  or  pay \nadditional allowances for specific positions. For example, program management units (PMUs) \nhave been used as a device to create specific positions attracting higher reward. There is some \nevidence suggesting that the recruitment and remuneration practice of PMUs has strengthened \nperformance  incentives.  PMUs  thus  should  be  seen  as  a  testing  case  and  precursor  for \nintroducing performance-based human resource management in the civil service of the province. \n \n61.  Gaps in Contract Employment Policy. Civil services reforms are a challenging task for \nany government.  Despite this, the GoPb has implemented some important measures. One \nmajor reform initiative since 2003 has been the shift toward contractual employment for new \nentrants into government service. Employees recruited on a contractual basis are paid an \nadditional 30% of the minimum salary of the relevant pay scale as compensation for not being \neligible  for  a  pension.  However,  the  difference  between  the  compensation  of  regular  and \n                                                 \n12 The government service of Pakistan is structured across twenty two basic pay scales (BPS 1-22). With some \nexceptions, the government officers of BPS 17 and higher are categorized as gazetted officers and assigned \nmiddle to senior level managerial responsibilities such as heads of sections, departments, field offices and drawing \nand disbursing officers. Government servants below BPS 17 generally work as support staff. \n ", " 50  Appendix 2 \n \ncontract employees is not large enough to discourage employees from seeking conversion to \nregular mode. The pressure to convert is building up as the number of contract employees \nincreases.  \n \n62.  Frequent Transfers. There are no systematic policies or mechanisms for placements \nand transfers. In many cases, the process of placements and transfers lacks a professional and \ntechnical basis, leading to a mismatch between skills and placement. Transfers are often made \nwithin a year of service, rather than the recommended minimum of 2\u20133 years. As such, the \nincumbents often barely have time to settle into a new job before they are moved on. \n \n63.  Weak Technical and Managerial Skills. A World Bank report13 points out that the \ntechnical competence of civil servants has been declining over the past two decades. There is \nalso limited interest in the training of civil servants because of the low returns from training. \nThere have been increased efforts in the training area by the GoPb in recent years. Supported \nby the PRMP, the government entered into a short-term arrangement with the Singapore Civil \nService College to undertake various training programs. These efforts mark an encouraging \nstep toward improving the capacity of civil servants. However, much remains to be done to \nupgrade capacity, incentives, and accountability in the system. \n \n64.  Challenges  Posed  by  Devolution.  The  PLGO  2001  has  significantly  changed \nintergovernmental relationships. Given the relatively short period since the launch of devolution, \nthere is continuing confusion over the roles, functions, and mandates to be performed by \ndifferent levels of government and the mechanisms for coordination between departments and \nagencies. Lack of capacity at the local government level for key functions such as planning, \nbudgeting, and human resource management also create a major constraint on the effective \nfunctioning of this level of government.  \n \n65.  Recent  Achievements.  Despite significant challenges, the GoPb has demonstrated \nstrong commitment to push forward civil service reforms with the objective of fostering a more \nefficient,  effective,  and  responsive  government.  To  steer  the  reform  process,  Change \nManagement  Unit  (CMU)  was  recently  been  upgraded  into  the  Public  Policy  and  Change \nManagement Wing (PPCMW) of the Services and General Administration Department (S&GAD), \nunder the stewardship and oversight of the chief secretary. The Rules of Business have been \namended  and  some  of  the  functions  of  the  Organization  and  Methods  Department  were \ntransferred to the PPCMW to enable it to satisfy its mandate.  \n \n66.  With the support of ADB, efforts are under way to recruit experts to develop a human \nresource management (HRM) manual and design a pilot performance-based human resource \nmanagement scheme for selected departments/agencies and positions. \n \n67.  The GoPb desires to further strengthen its training capability to upgrade the skills of \nprovincial  employees.  It  has  therefore  decided  to  adopt  a  three-pronged  strategy  for  the \nprofessional  development  of  its  staff.  First,  it  is  negotiating  a  long-term  arrangement  with \nSingapore Civil Service College to build the capacity and competence of the Management and \nProfessional Development Department (MPDD) trainers and resource persons to meet future \ntraining  needs.  Second,  it  is  planning  to  supplement  training  resource  capabilities  by \noutsourcing some of this activity and has entered into an agreement with the Lahore University \n                                                 \n13  World  Bank.  2004.

At present case studies \nare  being  prepared  and  the  first  course  will  be  launched  in  March  2008.  A  draft  training \nframework has also been developed. \n \n4.  Private Sector Development \n68.  Private sector development is essential for the province to ensure job creation, economic \ndevelopment,  and  poverty  reduction.  The  private  sector  in  the  Punjab  is  dominated  by \nsmall-scale informal enterprises operating primarily in the services and manufacturing sector: \n97% of manufacturing units employ fewer than 10 people. Today, the small- and medium \nenterprise (SME) sector contributes 30% of national gross domestic product (GDP) and 35% of \nnational  value  added  to  the  industrial  sector  and  generates  25%  of  manufacturing  export \nearnings.14 There are a number of impediments to the development of the SME sector. Most \nnotable is the lack of access to financial resources, poorly developed property rights, low levels \nof human resource capacity, weak regulatory oversight, expensive but poor quality of public \nutilities, and weak marketing and transport linkages.  \n \n69.  The labor force in 2002 numbered an estimated 27 million, 8.5% of these unemployed. \nThe population of the Punjab is growing rapidly (3%), and the labor force is growing at a faster \nrate than the annual growth rate of new jobs registered (2.7%). The need to create new jobs, as \na large number of young people enter the labor force, cannot be overestimated. While the \nagricultural  sector  will  continue  to  provide  the  bulk  of  employment  opportunities  for  the \npopulation, it is debatable whether it can provide full employment to substantial new additional \nlabor. The bulk of employment opportunities have to be generated by the nonfarm sector.   \n \n70.  Lack of Coherent Private Sector Development Strategy. The Punjab needs a good \nstrategic framework to define the role of the state vis-\u00e0-vis the private sector. Although almost \n9 out of 10 Punjabis are already employed in the private sector, the reach of that sector in terms \nof contribution to provincial economy is only about 30%. The private sector requires support in \naddressing issues that have a public good element, impose positive or negative externalities on \nother businesses or the society, or have collective action issues. The state can help in this area \nby adopting a coherent private sector development (PSD) strategy and underwriting costs, and \nencouraging the development of collective solutions.  \n \n71.  High Cost of Doing Business. In all recent surveys, the regulatory and compliance \nburdens for businesses in the Punjab still figure as major concerns. Financial and fiscal sector \nreforms have gone some way to reducing the cost of doing business. However, setting up the \n\u201crules of the game\u201d and the regulatory framework remains the responsibility of the government, \nand reforms in this area need to be tackled urgently. To facilitate long-term engagement on this \nissue, the Punjab Government Efficiency Improvement Program (PGEIP) foresees the GoPb \ninstituting a regular survey on the cost of doing business in the province. The survey will (i) set \nbenchmarks for performance, (ii) allow tracking of costs and of progress made, and (iii) allow \nregular and continuous engagement with the issues. It will identify the key problem areas and \nthe government will introduce measures to implement the legal and institutional reforms needed \n                                                 \n14 Data for this section are taken from World Bank. 2005.

This will be crucial in attracting increasing investments, \nboth foreign and local, into the Punjab.  \n \n72.  In  addition  to  the  cost-of-business  survey,  a  number  of  actions  can  be  taken  to \nstrengthen the regulatory framework, including: (i) a strategy of effectively promoting core labor, \nenvironment, and other quality standards; (ii) the conduct of a regulatory impact assessment, \ninstitutionalized in selected departments; and (iii) the establishment of an alternative dispute \nresolution facility in Lahore. \n \n73.  Public-Private Partnerships. Private sector participation in the social sectors is already \nrapidly increasing in Pakistan. For example, the latest estimates show that some 30\u201335% of all \nschool-going children now attend private schools. Yet, there are segments of society that the \nfor-profit private sector will not serve, as these segments do not afford enough returns for the \nprivate sector. In addition, there are areas in which public good elements of services are so \nstrong that for-profit private sector participation does not make economic sense (public health, \npreventive health, quality of education).  \n \n74.  Absence  of  PPP  Framework.  There  are  sectors  providing  services  to  the  Punjab \neconomy which for historical, legal, or economic reasons have been primarily the responsibility \nof the public sector. Yet within these sectors the public sector feels that it cannot deliver the \nrequisite quality and quantity of services required to meet the demands of the people. Primarily, \nthe government does not have enough resources (human, financial and technical) to cater to \nlarge infrastructure or service delivery needs. PPPs can be one way of reducing the demand-\nsupply gap. The Punjab lacks a policy or regulatory framework and the institutional capacity for \neffectively promoting PPPs.  \n \n75.  Recent Achievements. The private sector has benefited from recent reforms including \nconsolidation, rationalization, and rate adjustment for provincial taxes (reducing the number of \ntaxes, improving payment processes, reducing compliance costs and the possibility of leakages); \nsome rationalization in labor-related levies and inspections; changes in some archaic laws (for \nexample, regarding boiler inspections); reduction in bias against commercialization of property \n(some rationalization in stamp duties and other charges); improvements in building codes; \nreduction  in  bias  against  rental  property  (as  opposed  to  owner-occupied  property);  and \nfacilitation  of  private  sector  involvement  in  agricultural  marketing  (procurement,  storage, \nprocessing, and trade). \n \n ", "      Appendix 3        53                 \nSTRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR AN INTEGRATED APPROACH TO FULFILL VISION 2020 \nA.  Second-Generation Reforms and Program Structure  \n1.  In conjunction with the implementation of the Punjab Resource Management Program \n(PRMP) and the Punjab Devolved Social Services Program (PDSSP), the government of the \nPunjab (GoPb) has also participated in the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) assistance to the \nfederal  Government  related  to  the  Access  to  Justice  Program  (AJP)  and  Decentralization \nSupport  Program  reforms  (paras.  9\u201311  of  main  text).  Supported  by  these  programs,  the \ngovernment launched and successfully implemented key public sector reforms in 2003\u20132007. \nHaving accomplished some key milestones, it now wishes to move on to a second generation of \nreforms, which will form important building blocks in the medium term toward achieving Vision \n2020 (para. 6 of main text).  \n \n2.  In order to support all the six pillars of Vision 2020, an integrated approach comprising \nthree  distinct  program  clusters,  namely  the  Punjab  Government  Efficiency  Improvement \nProgram  (PGEIP),  Punjab  Millennium  Development  Goals  Program  (PMDGP)  and  Punjab \nAccess to Justice Program (PAJP), is planned as outlined in para. 11. Box A3.1 below presents \nan outline of the integrated program structure developed in consultation with the GoPb and \nother stakeholders, which aims to direct resources for better development outcomes, reduce \nduplication, and minimize inconsistency in policy advice and measures. A longer-term program \nis needed to provide conceptual as well as predictable financing support for the implementation \nof  reforms  over  the  next  5  years,  and  thus  ensure  that  the  overall  reform  momentum  is \nsustained and deepened. The three proposed core interventions in outline form are as follows:    \n \n(i)  Punjab  Government  Efficiency  Improvement  Program  (PGEIP).  This  will \nprovide the basis for core reforms in all core areas of public administration and \nfinancial management.

It will improve the \ndelivery of public services, particularly in the health sector, promote sustainable \npublic-private  partnerships  (PPPs),  and  introduce  viable  health  financing \nmechanisms (including health insurance). The health sector focus is in response \nto  the  relatively  poor  health  service  access  and  quality,  and  lagging  health \nindicators, in Punjab, and will complement the World Bank\u2019s education sector \nsupport. It is envisaged that the PMDGP will be implemented through 2 or 3 SPs, \nimplemented with an interval of about 18 months between each SP.

Low access to justice and the inefficient operation of \nthe judicial system have long been identified as major impediments to investment \nand the well-being of citizens.

SP1 of PAJP will be brought to the Board for consideration in 2008 \n(see Box A3.3 for more details). \n \n3.  Under the integrated framework, a holistic approach to sector-specific reforms would be \npromoted. In this respect, there are strong inter-linkages and complementarities among the \nPGEIP, the PMDGP, and the PAJP. For instance, the PGEIP will strengthen the capacity of the \nDepartment of Health (DOH) to formulate a medium-term investment strategy for the health \nsector and identify related financing needs. To this end, the establishment of a Strategy and \nPolicy Unit (SPU) that will be responsible for defining health sector policies and strategies is \nsupported. Building on this, the PMDGP will support the implementation of the strategies toward \nmeeting  health-related  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs).  Likewise,  the  PGEIP  will \nsupport the development of the legal and regulatory framework for PPP, which will in turn \nfacilitate  private  sector  participation  in  the  provision  of  social  and  infrastructure  services. \nFurthermore, a well-functioning judiciary, which ensures enforceability of contracts and security \nof property rights\u2014key outcomes envisioned under the PAJP\u2014will enhance investor confidence, \nthereby contributing to private sector development. \n \n4.  Program Clusters with Single Tranches. The framework would build on lessons learnt \nfrom PRMP and take into account reforms carried out by the GoPb over the past few years. \nFirst, it brings together public sector, MDG-related, and judicial sector reforms in integrated \nclusters  of  programs  to  ensure  fullest  coordination.  Second,  the  GoPb  and  ADB  have \nestablished a strong partnership through the implementation of the PRMP. This has laid a solid \nfoundation for a mature relationship, serving as a platform for constructive policy dialogue. The \ngovernment  has  demonstrated  strong  commitment  to  reforms.  The  policy  conditions  could \ntherefore serve more as a tool to guide reforms rather than as rigid prescriptive actions. Third, \nexperience  has  shown  that  reforms  occur  through  constant  learning  by  doing  and \nexperimentation.  The  program  cluster  approach,  comprising  a  series  of  single-tranche \noperations, offers a more productive means of responding to changing domestic and external \ncircumstances,  and  reflecting  learning  in  moving  forward into  complex  areas  such  as  civil \nservice reforms and performance-based resource allocation. With greater focus on eventual \noutcomes or essential intermediate steps, the cluster approach ensures smoother program \nimplementation,  as  has  been  shown  in  ADB\u2019s  recent  experience  in  Indonesia  and  the \nPhilippines and in the World Bank\u2019s development policy loan modality. In such areas, where \nreforms need at least 5\u20136 years to take firm root, prescribing all actions up front is neither \ndesirable nor feasible.1  \n \n5.  Greater Involvement of Stakeholders as well as ADB. The integrated framework \nwould enable continuous feedback from all relevant stakeholders in Pakistan. At the same time, \nthe  single-tranche  structure  with  indicative  outcome-oriented  actions  will  enable  ADB\u2019s \nManagement and Board to provide more effective guidance on essential public sector reforms \nthat have been pursued successfully elsewhere, without adopting a rigid prescriptive stance up \nfront. \n \nB.  Link with ADB\u2019s Country Strategy  \n6.  As the largest province in the country, the Punjab faces significant reform as well as \nfinancing needs. To guide the planning and public financial management process, the PRMP \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

As  part  of  the  conceptual  process,  the  provincial \ngovernment has identified clear financing needs for the strengthening of its civil service pension \nsystem (paras. 11 and 19 of main text). Just on the basis of funding its pension system alone, \napart  from  the  reform  needs  in  a  number  of  other  areas,  the  provincial  government  has \nrequested ADB to consider providing reform and financing support of about $300 million per \nyear over 2007\u20132011. The framework proposed in the chart is aimed at conceptualizing a \nreform agenda and financing support over a 5-year period. To begin the process, the PGEIP, in \nthe amount of $750 million, will be divided into three SPs to support reforms in the first four of \nthe six pillars identified in para. 50 of main text.  \n \n7.  The integrated clusters of programs would be well aligned with ADB\u2019s country strategy \nfor Pakistan. The forthcoming Country Partnership Strategy for 2007\u20132011 defines second-\ngeneration reforms for strengthening governance and financial services as one of the strategic \npillars of ADB\u2019s operations in Pakistan.

The budget preparation process in the GoPb is clear with adequate timelines, while good \nprogress  has  been  made  in  introducing  budget  planning  with  a  medium-term  perspective. \nReform initiatives have also been introduced in tax administration and tax policy, though scope \nfor  improvement  still  exists  with  respect  to  the  determination  of  tax  liabilities,  taxpayers\u2019 \nregistration, and effective tax collection. Major areas of improvement in budget control and \nexecution concern the effectiveness of payroll controls, the overall quality of the procurement \nprocess (e.g., use of open competition for award of contracts and existence of procurement \ncomplaints mechanism), and the system of internal audit, whose quality is very poor. Budget \naccounting and reporting is satisfactory in account reconciliation, the reporting of information \nfrom line departments to central departments, and the quality of midyear budget reports.

The objectives of the program \nare to assist the government of Punjab \nin  achieving  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) in poverty \nreduction,  gender  equality,  and \nimprovements in education (including \nspecial education), health, and water \nsupply  and  sanitation.  These \nobjectives are to be achieved through \nthe  strengthening  of  devolved  social \nservices for more equitable, efficient, \neffective, and sustainable delivery of \nsocial  services  in  line  with  Punjab \nLocal  Government  Ordinance  (LGO) \n2001.  The  program  is  built  around \nthree  principal  policy  outcomes: \n(i) realigning  intergovernmental \nrelations  to  support  devolved  social \nservices, (ii) rationalizing and setting \nminimum standards for social services, \nand  (iii)  strengthening  public \naccountability  mechanisms  and \npromoting  public-private  partnership. \nThe  program  is  to  be  implemented \nover a 3-year period across 34 district \ngovernments  and up to 34 program \ntehsil (town) municipal administrations \n(except for towns/TMAs with a water \nand  sanitation  authority  and  those \nreceiving support from other ongoing \nprojects funded by ADB).

This support phase is ongoing and is \nfocused on key PRMP intervention areas\u2014public financial management, civil service reforms, and private sector \ndevelopment. Additional areas of support include reforming and building the capacity of the Bureau of Statistics (BOS) \nand the Punjab Economic Research Institute. An amount of \u00a32 million has also been earmarked for the Policy \nDevelopment Fund, to be used in response to requests from the government of the Punjab as the assistance unfolds \nand needs are identified. Coordination with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) TA for the PRMP is ensured through the \nexecutive and steering committees of the PRMP.  \nThe Government of Pakistan and the Government of the United Kingdom also signed recently a 10-year partnership \nagreement, whose purpose is to afford better predictability in development assistance and better alignment on key policy \nthemes. The initial phase (until 2011) comprises a grant assistance package of \u00a3480 million, which is expected to take \neffect in April 2008. A substantial part of this assistance is meant for the province of Punjab. An initial assistance of \u00a330 \nmillion is being designed in collaboration with the Punjab to assist the 15 poorer districts in the province. The focus of \nassistance will be on alleviating poverty and improving social service delivery. On the back of the long-term partnership, \nthe DFID is now working on evolving a more focused 10-year partnership with the government of the Punjab. The details \nof the partnership are yet to be finalized. The coordination between ADB and DFID under PRMP is a key to ensuring aid \neffectiveness.  \nDFID Support for PRMP and PGEIP \nDFID is providing a parallel TA, amounting to \u00a35 million, from 2006 to 2009 to support governance and public resource \nmanagement reforms in the Punjab. The overall goal of the DFID assistance is to help the government move toward an \naccountable, efficient, and effective government that meets the needs of its people. Specifically, the following outputs \nare expected: (i) improved availability and quality of data, and economic and social research on the Punjab; (ii) more \ntransparent and results-based budget allocations; (iii) public administrative reform, fully consistent with Punjab Local \nGovernment  Ordinance  (PLGO)  2001,  and  cognizant  of  the  current  and  future  human  resource  needs  of  the \ngovernment; (iv) improved policies and capacity to support private sector development; (v) improved ability of the \ngovernment of the Punjab to develop policy in areas complementary to the Punjab Government Efficiency Improvement \nProgram (PGEIP); and (vi) a communication strategy in place to widen ownership of pro-poor reforms. \nThe TA grant is allocated as follows: Board of Statistics and Punjab Economic Research Institute, \u00a31.3 million; public \nfinancial management, \u00a30.5 million; private sector development, \u00a30.5 million; civil service reforms, \u00a30.5 million; and \ncommunication strategy, \u00a30.2 million. In addition, a Policy Development Support Fund of \u00a32 million can be used to \nrespond to requests from the government for help in developing policy in important areas related to public financial \nmanagement that were not covered by the previous PRMP. \nWhile  the  ADB  TA/program  and  the  DFID  grant  share  some  broad  common  areas,  including  public  financial \nmanagement, civil service reforms, and private sector development, the possibility of overlap and duplication is small for \na number of reasons. First, while the total DFID TA grant is \u00a35 million, the allocation to the three common areas is only \n\u00a31.5 million. Second, there are numerous issues in all the three common areas and the TA needs are large, reducing the \npossibility  of  duplication.  Third,  both  ADB  and  DFID  are  committed  to  achieving  donor  coordination  and  aid \neffectiveness. Thus, ADB and DFID will actively coordinate with each other to achieve complementarity of TA activities \nand outputs. For example, in the civil service area, DFID\u2019s major area of assistance will be in developing a human \nresource management information database. Fourth and most importantly, the Planning and Development Department \n(P&DD) is the executing agency for both ADB and the DFID assistance, and the PRMP program management unit \n(PMU) is the overall program/TA management unit. The DFID TA will be implemented by a DFID-appointed TA \nmanagement agency (TAMA), which will work with the government of the Punjab. The PRMP PMU will closely \ncoordinate with the TAMA to ensure that the synergies between PGEIP and the DFID TA are maximized. Regular \ninteraction between ADB, DFID, and the government will be maintained to improve coordination. \n ", " 66  Appendix 6 \n \n    \nDevelopment Policy Letter \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "       Appendix 6      67 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", " 68  Appendix 6 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "       Appendix 6      69 \n \n \n \n \n \n ", " 70  Appendix 6 \n \n \n ", " \nPOLICY MATRIX FOR THE PUNJAB GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM \n     \nImpact: Sustained high economic growth, with lower poverty incidence and improved delivery of public services, perceptible improvements in the \ndelivery of public services, and higher and sustained economic growth, in the province of the Punjab.  \n \nOutcome: The government of Punjab (GoPb) becomes more efficient in the allocation of scarce resources and more responsive to citizens\u2019 \nneeds.  \n \nSP1 Prior Actions   SP2 Indicative Prior Actions \nPrincipal Objective  (July 2006 to October 2007)  (May 2009)  SP3 Indicative Prior Actions\nA.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis  \n \n1.  In 2003, the government of the Punjab (GoPb) introduced the Punjab-Poverty Reduction \nStrategy Paper (P-PRSP) as its response to the steeply increasing incidence of poverty during \nthe 1990s. The P-PRSP identified (i) governance reform, (ii) strengthening of planning capability, \n(iii)  improvements  in  service  delivery,  (iv)  fiscal  and  financial  reforms,  (v) income  and \nemployment generation, and (vi) gender mainstreaming as key elements of effective poverty \nreduction in the Punjab. The Punjab Resource Management Program (PRMP) was aimed at \nsupporting improvements in these areas. PRMP helped develop and operationalize the poverty-\nfocused investment strategies for six key sectors in order to implement the P-PRSP. It likewise \nsupported  revenue  mobilization,  budgeting,  and  debt  management  reforms  to  create  fiscal \nspace and improve the use of fiscal resources. This has set the stage for the second-generation \nreforms under the Punjab Government Efficiency Improvement Program (PGEIP), which seeks \nto strengthen the performance orientation of the budget, undertake pension reform to create \nadditional fiscal space for social and development expenditures, improve the responsiveness of \nthe civil service to public's needs, particularly in the delivery of pro-poor services; and promote \nprivate sector development for income generation and employment creation. \n \n2.  Likewise, the PGEIP has strong linkage with both the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \ncountry strategy and the national poverty reduction strategy. ADB\u2019s Pakistan country strategy \nand  program  (CSP)  for  2002\u20132006,1 which  was  based  on  ADB\u2019s  poverty  assessment  for \nPakistan in 20022 and developed in the context of the national Poverty Reduction Strategy \nPaper (PRSP), emphasized poor governance as a key cause of poverty. The CSP update \n2005\u20132008 further emphasized the importance of governance reforms. Poor governance not \nonly resulted in poor public service delivery and greater vulnerability, but also led to a drop in \nbusiness confidence, which in turn resulted in lower investment levels and growth. ADB\u2019s draft \ncountry partnership strategy (CPS) for 2007\u20132011 for Pakistan maintains this focus, identifying \ngovernance and institutional bottlenecks as binding constraints on growth and poverty reduction. \nThis is consistent with the government\u2019s draft second-generation poverty reduction strategy, \nPRSP II, which includes effective governance and management as a key pillar. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis: Poverty and Public Resource Management in the Punjab \n3.  Official poverty indicators for 2004\u20132005 indicate a sharp improvement in the poverty \nsituation for Pakistan. The national poverty head-count ratio, which shows the percentage of the \npopulation living below the poverty line declining by 10.6 percentage points from 34.46% in \n2001\u20132002 to 23.9% in 2004\u20132005. In absolute numbers, the number of poor persons in \nPakistan fell from 49.23 million to 36.45 million. The changes in poverty incidence in Pakistan in \nrecent years demonstrate the importance of economic growth in poverty reduction.  \n \n4.  Likewise, the Punjab\u2019s average annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 8% from \nfiscal year (FY) 2003 to FY2007 has contributed to the improvement in the poverty situation in \nthe Punjab. In addition, increase in social spending has also improved social conditions. From a \npoverty head-count ratio of 34.1% in FY2002, the ratio decreased by 11 percentage points to \nabout  23%  in  FY2005.  It  is  estimated  that  the  ratio  has  further  declined  by  another  2.1 \npercentage points in FY2007. Gains are similarly seen in some social sectors like education and \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2002. Country Strategy and Program (2002\u20132006): Pakistan.

The literacy rate improved from 47% in FY2002 to 62% in FY2007, while net primary \nenrollment rate rose from 45% to 70% during the same period. Infant mortality rate per 1,000 \nlive births declined from 82 in FY2002 to 72 in FY2007, while child mortality rate per 1,000 live \nbirths3 decreased from 119 to 105. The percentage of children between 12 and 23 months that \nhave been fully immunized increased from 57% to 76% from FY2002 to FY2007. There has also \nbeen improvement in maternal health care during the same period, with maternal mortality ratio \nper 100,000 live births dropping from 350 to 257. In spite of these gains, however, the poverty \nlevel  still  exceeds  20%  and  social  indicators  lag  behind  those  of  comparable  low-income \ncountries. For instance, Mongolia and Viet Nam, which have slightly lower per capita incomes4 \nthan the Punjab,5 have higher net primary enrollment rates, at 82.4% (for Mongolia) and 94.3% \n(for Viet Nam). In terms of health indicators, child and infant mortality rates for these countries \nare at least half of those in the Punjab. Bangladesh, which has a significantly lower per capita \nincome6 than the Punjab, has a higher net primary enrollment rate and lower child and infant \nmortality rates. Thus, reducing poverty and improving social and living conditions remain key \ntasks for the GoPb.7 \n \n5.  The increase in investment in the social sectors in recent years is encouraging. The \nWorld  Bank\u2019s  Punjab  Education  Sector  Reform  Program  focuses  on  pro-poor  initiatives, \nincluding the provision of free textbooks and stipends to girl students as part of efforts to \nincrease enrollment and retention in poor districts. Interventions under the Decentralization \nSupport Program8 and the Punjab Devolved Social Services Program (PDSSP)9 are building \ncapacity at provincial and local government levels for efficient and effective pro-poor service \ndelivery with better monitoring, evaluation, and gender sensitivity.  \n \n6.  PRMP has contributed to poverty reduction in Punjab. Subprogram 1 focused on the \ndevelopment of poverty-focused investment strategies for key social sectors, and subprogram 2 \npushed for the approval and operationalization of these strategies. Subprogram 1 helped reduce \nthe high debt service burden through early retirement of cash development loans, and initial \nrestructuring of provincial taxes has resulted in an increase in revenues. Likewise, subsidies not \nexplicitly  targeting  the  poor  were  phased  out.  This  has  created  additional  fiscal  space  to \naccommodate more PRSP-related expenditures. Subprogram 2 focused largely on improving \npublic service delivery and accelerating growth through private sector development. The GoPb \nhas implemented the medium-term budget framework (MTBF) and has taken steps to introduce \ntimely, reliable, and publicly accessible public accounts. It has also introduced measures to \nsupport sustained private sector development. The continuity of reforms in underlying systems \nand processes to manage public resources is crucial if the incidence of poverty in Punjab is to \nbe further reduced.  \n \n7.  The PGEIP envisages further improvement in the delivery of pro-poor social services. \nThe  implementation  of  the  medium-term  expenditure  framework  (MTEF)  enhances  the \nperformance orientation of the budget, and improves its pro-poor focus. Efforts are also being \ntaken to strengthen linkages between the budget and service delivery in key social sectors such \n                                                 \n3  Children below 5 years old. \n4  Per capita gross national income in 2005 was $690 for Mongolia and $620 for Viet Nam. \n5  The Punjab had per capita GDP of about $747 in FY2004\u20132005. \n6  Per capita gross national income for Bangladesh in 2005 was $470. \n7  Information on GDP growth, poverty and social sectors is taken from Elahi, Pervaiz Ch.

The PGEIP also addresses the fiscal squeeze arising from pension liabilities by \nmaking them off-budget and creating viable pension and general provident funds. This creates \nadditional resources for pro-poor expenditures. Civil service reform is being pursued to improve \nresponsiveness, effectiveness, and efficiency toward better public service. Lastly, encouraging \npublic-private partnerships expands the resources available for pro-poor services in the Punjab. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n1.  Stakeholder Analysis  \n8.  The design of the PGEIP incorporates the results of stakeholder consultations at all \nlevels  of  government  and  civil  society.  Further,  it  incorporates  lessons  learned  during  the \nconsultative process for the preparation and implementation of the two PRMP subprograms, the \nDecentralization Support Program, and the PDSSP.  \n \n9.  The consensus-building strategy for the PGEIP is in line with that used for PRMP, which \nwas the result of policy dialogue that began in 2002, with the ADB technical assistance (TA).10 \nThe PGEIP entails a continuous policy dialogue until 2010 and possibly beyond, with all key \nstakeholders,  including  politicians,  civil  servants,  civil  society  organizations,  the  academic \ncommunity, media, private sector representatives, and other development partners. In addition, \nthe cluster approach, with regular dialogue, will continue to ensure that the reforms, despite \nbeing demanding, stay broadly on track. \n \n10.  The PGEIP will continue to support for the Punjab Development Forum (PDF), which is a \nwell-established and regular event that brings all stakeholders together to (i) study and evaluate \ndevelopment progress in Punjab, (ii) discuss key challenges, and (iii) provide guidance on how \nto address the development challenges.11  \n \n2.  Participation Strategy \n11.  The GoPb has adopted a participatory approach in designing and implementing its \npoverty reduction programs, starting with wide-ranging consultations with stakeholders in the \nformulation of the P-PRSP. The government\u2019s commitment to participation continues with its \nongoing reform effort, which emphasizes consultation through initiatives such as the PDF. \nUnder subprograms 1 and 2 of PRMP, consultations were a regular feature, including the MTBF \nForum in October 2004. The PGEIP further strengthens the systems and procedures in the \npublic  sector  to  promote  accessibility,  accountability,  transparency,  and  fiscal  discipline  by \ndeveloping and implementing the MTEF. It also encourages broader participation of the private \nsector in the Punjab\u2019s economic activity and fosters public-private partnerships. As participatory \napproaches gain ground in government processes, it is imperative to follow through with the \ninstitutionalization of broader stakeholder participation with the support of the political leadership \nand bureaucracy.  \n \n12.  On the basis of the experience with PRMP and recommendations of evaluation studies \nof other policy-based lending programs, the PGEIP will continue to convene the PDF and to \nconduct other participatory processes, engaging stakeholders at federal, provincial, and local \nlevels. During the program preparation, the PGEIP benefited from workshops in the formulation \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2002.

It  will  continue  to  provide  the  venue  for \naddressing various stakeholders\u2019 concerns related to its reform program. The PGEIP receives \noversight and guidance through a high-level steering committee, which includes representatives \nof civil society and the private sector. As the reform process under the PGEIP deepens, the role \nof  the  steering  committee  will  become  central  to  its  success.  More  vigorous  and  regular \ndirection from the steering committee will be required under the PGEIP.  \n \nD.  Social Issues \n13.  The P-PRSP emphasized the need to establish a system for monitoring and evaluating \nsocial and economic conditions. It identified key indicators, baselines, and targets, and clearly \ndefined the responsibility for the collection of data related to each indicator. The ADB TA \nprojects  Local  Government  Performance  Enhancement 12  and  Gender  and  Governance \nMainstreaming13 also  established  baselines  and  targets  for  gender,  access,  equity,  and \nsustainability.  In  addition,  the  TA  project  Enhancing  Capacity  for  Poverty  Reduction  and \nResource Management in Punjab14 promoted poverty-focused development planning, including \nthe  engagement  of  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  specialist,  who  worked  with  the  GoPb  to \ndevelop key performance indicators for monitoring progress against social sector targets. The \nwork on monitoring and evaluation done under the previous TA and DSSP is encouraging. \nUnder subprogram 2, the Planning and Development Department (P&DD) has strengthened its \nmonitoring  procedures for  tracking  expenditures  and  outcomes  of  the  annual  development \nprogram and for implementing poverty-focused investment strategies. The PGEIP complements \nthis  by  infusing  greater  transparency,  accountability,  and  performance  orientation  in  public \nexpenditures  through  MTEF  and  adopting  service  delivery  standards.  The  GoPb  will  also \ninstitute mechanisms for tracking expenditure performance under the PGEIP. \n \n1.  Gender \n14.  Although  education  indicators  generally  improved  from  2001\u20132002  to  2004\u20132005, \nstatistics  from  the  2004\u20132005  Pakistan  Social  and  Living  Standards  Measurement  Survey \nindicate  the  continued  wide  gender  disparities  in  access  to  education  in  the  Punjab.  For \ninstance, the literacy rate for females in the province was 21% lower than that for males in \nFY2005. Large disparities likewise persist across the urban and rural sectors, and tend to be \nhigher in rural areas. There also remains a wide gap in employment opportunities. The 2005\u2013\n2006 Labor Force Survey shows the persistence of the low labor force participation rate among \nwomen in the Punjab, at 17.9% compared with 51.6% for males. \n \n15.  A preliminary gender review of federal, provincial, and district public sector expenditure \nand  its  management  suggests  a  critical  need  for  cross-sector  and  comprehensive  gender \nanalysis,  planning,  budgeting,  auditing,  and  monitoring  systems,  and  a  methodology  and \nmechanisms  to  ensure  gender-balanced  resource  distribution  at  all  three  levels.  Fulfilling \ncommitments on mainstreaming gender is one of the key objectives of PRMP. The approval and \nimplementation  of  the  provincial  gender  reform  action  plan  (GRAP)  was  achieved  under \nsubprogram  1.  A  PRs612  million  GRAP  Planning  Commission  pro-forma  I  (PC-I)  with  the \nobjective of mainstreaming gender at all levels of the government was approved by the GoPb. \n                                                 \n12 Technical assistance loan approved under ADB. 2002.

Manila. \n ", "98   Appendix 13   \n \nUnder subprogram 2, the GoPb established the Change Management Unit (CMU), which will be \nresponsible for ensuring that gender considerations are taken into account in reform programs. \nRecently  the  CMU  was  upgraded  to  the  Public  Policy  and  Change  Management  Wing \n(PPCMW).  The  PGEIP  will  further  strengthen  change  management  by  introducing  change \nmanagement agents in core departments and district governments. \n \n2.  Access \n16.  The reforms proposed under the PGEIP are designed to further improve access to social \nservices, particularly in the health sector, by strengthening the linkage between the budget \nprocess  and  service  delivery.  Implementation  of  MTEF  will  encourage  performance-based \nbudgets, which means better public access to services, and will enhance the pro-poor focus of \npublic expenditures. An improved civil service will likewise be more responsive to the needs of \nthe general public, including the poor and marginalized sectors. It will also result in improved \ngovernance, which will lower transaction costs as rent-seeking behavior and graft are reduced. \nThe resulting lower transaction costs will benefit the poor and the non-poor alike, improving \naccess for all. Not only will pension reforms result in a well-functioning pension system, it will \nprovide access to much-needed financial security over the long term, as well as fiscal space for \npro-poor expenditures as the share of pension servicing in the budget declines over time. \n \n3.  Equity \n17.  The PGEIP will promote greater equity in the Punjab. Performance orientation and fiscal \ndiscipline infused by MTEF as well as the adoption of service delivery standards will ensure that \nimproved service delivery benefits the poor. Likewise, better and more efficient public resource \nmanagement will create additional fiscal space for pro-poor expenditures. Within the public \nservice, civil service reforms will incorporate equity considerations through merit-based human \nresources management. \n \n4.  Sustainability \n18.  ADB  will  continue  to  support  measures  to  improve  effective  resource  management \n(which was identified as the basis for poverty reduction in the P-PRSP). PRMP has already \nhelped bring about significant reforms in development planning and resource management \nsystems. The PGEIP will undertake the second-generation reforms needed to sustain and \nfurther improve these efforts. \n \n19.  Under the PRMP, the GoPb started important reforms, including the preparation of \nMTBF  and  MTDF,  tax  reforms,  procurement  reforms,  improvements  in  the  planning  and \napproval process for development projects, and the approval of a new industrial policy that \naddresses many of the concerns of the private sector. To ensure the sustainability of the reform \nprocess, the PGEIP reinforces previous reforms with civil service reform and performance-\nbased  budgeting.  Also,  a  strengthened  and  financially  viable  pension  system  will  remove \npension liabilities from the budget, thereby creating more fiscal space for other social services. \nIn addition, the focus of the PGEIP on creating an environment conducive to private sector \nactivities opens the door to partnerships forged with the private sector to pursue reforms. Finally, \nthe PGEIP will continue to support the GoPb in implementing the essentially home-grown \nreform agenda that was begun under PRMP. The GoPb\u2019s strong sense of ownership of the \nreform process reinforces the prospects for the long-term sustainability of the achievements \nunder the PGEIP. \n ", "                                             Appendix 13            99                   \nTable A13: Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \nA.

Effective public resource management will increase revenues, improve allocation \nefficiency of public expenditures toward high socioeconomic returns, enhance sustainability of and access by the poor \nto public services, including for basic social services and infrastructure, and promote private sector development and \nemployment generation. Governance reforms, including public resource management, are a central element in the \ncountry poverty analysis. Second generation reforms under the PGEIP will strengthen the performance orientation of \nthe budget, free up resources for PRSP-related expenditures, and improve the responsiveness of the civil service to \npublic\u2019s need, particularly in delivery of pro-poor services. \n \n \nB.   Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \nPunjab\u2019s GDP annual growth of 8% from FY2003 to FY2007 has contributed to the improvement in the poverty \nsituation in Punjab. In addition, increase social spending has also improved social conditions. From a poverty head-\ncount ratio of 34.1% in FY2002, this decreased by 11 percentage points in FY2005. This is estimated to have further \ndeclined by another 2.1 percentage points in FY2007. Gains are likewise seen in some social sectors like education \nand health. The literacy rate improved from 47% in FY2002 to 62% in FY2007 while net primary enrolment rate rose \nfrom 45% to 70% during the same period. Infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births declined from 82 in FY2002 to 72 in \nFY2007 while child mortality rate per 1,000 live birthsa decreased from 119 to 105. The percentage of children \nbetween 12 and 23 months that have been fully immunized increased from 57% to 76% from FY2002 to FY2007. \nThere has likewise been improvement in maternal health care during the same period with maternal mortality ratio per \n100,000 live births dropping from 350 to 257. In spite of these gains, poverty level still exceeds 20% and social \nindicators lag behind that of other comparable low income countries. Thus, reducing poverty and improving social and \nliving conditions remain key tasks for the GoPb.b \n \nPRMP is a central element of the Punjab PRSP to reduce the incidence of poverty in Punjab. Subprogram 1 focused \non the development of poverty-focused investment strategies for key social sectors, and Subprogram 2 pushed for the \napproval and operationalization of these strategies. Subprogram 1 helped to reduce the high debt service burden \nthrough early retirement of cash development loans and initial restructuring of provincial taxes has resulted in an \nincrease in revenues. Likewise, subsidies not explicitly targeting the poor were phased out. This has created additional \nfiscal space to accommodate more PRSP-related expenditures. Subprogram 2 focused largely on improving public \nservice delivery and accelerating growth through private sector development. The GoPb has implemented the MTBF \nand introduced timely, reliable and publicly accessible public accounts. It has also introduced measures to support \nsustained private sector development. The continuity of reforms in underlying systems and processes to manage \npublic resources is crucial if the incidence of poverty in Punjab is to be further reduced.  \n \nThe PGEIP continues to support the three components of the ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy: pro-poor sustainable \neconomic growth, good governance, and social development. The PGEIP envisages the further improvement in the \ndelivery of pro-poor social services. The implementation of the MTEF enhances the performance orientation of the \nbudget, and improves its pro-poor focus. Efforts are also taken to strengthen linkages between the budget and service \ndelivery in key social sectors such as health. The PGEIP also addresses the fiscal squeeze arising from pension \nliabilities by making them off-budget and creating viable pension and general provident funds. This creates additional \nfiscal space for pro-poor expenditures. Civil service reform is pursued to improve the responsiveness of the latter \ntowards the needs of the public. Lastly, encouraging public-private partnerships expands the resources available for \npro-poor services in Punjab. \n \na  Children below 5 years old. \nb  Information on GDP growth, poverty and social sectors are taken from Elahi, Pervaiz Ch.
