Yet \nreforms in many areas are only partial, poverty is still high at over 20%, \nand  social  indicators  lag  behind  those  in  comparable  low-income \ncountries.   \n \nThe  government  of  Punjab  (GoPb)  has  laid  down  an  ambitious  Vision \n2020  aimed  at  doubling  per  capita  income  over  the  next  decade.  This \nwill  require  sustained  broad-based  economic  growth,  which  in  turn \ndemands  large  efficiency  improvements  in  both  the  private  and  the \npublic  sectors,  accompanied  by  better  public  resource  management. \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)\u2013supported  Punjab \nThrough \nResource  Management  Program \nimplemented  during \nNovember  2003\u2013August  2007,  the  GoPb  has  introduced  wide-ranging \nreforms  in  public  resource  management.  It  has  enhanced  revenues, \nrationalized  expenditures,  improved  planning  and  budgeting,  and \ndeveloped the private sector and the civil service. In parallel, the GoPb \n\n(PRMP), \n\nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProgram Rationale \n\n \n\n\fhas  also  implemented  reforms  in  service  delivery,  through  the  ADB-\nsupported Punjab Devolved Social Services Program (PDSSP), and in \nthe judiciary, through the Access to Justice Program (AJP). \n \nHaving  laid  down  a  broad  foundation  for  reforms  through  these  three \nmajor ADB interventions, and support from other development partners \nin  the  governance,  education,  and  infrastructure  sectors,  the  GoPb \nlaunched \nfourth  Punjab \nDevelopment  Forum  in  April  2007.  These  reforms  are  centered  on \ncreating  an  effective  public  sector  and  fostering  a  dynamic  private \nsector to achieve the Vision 2020 goals.  \n \nThe key pillars of the second-generation reforms are the following: \n  \n(i) \n\nefficient public financial management, to increase the fiscal space \nfor higher pro-poor spending;  \n\nits  second-generation \n\nreforms  at \n\nthe \n\n(ii)  a  fully  funded  and  well-governed  civil  service  pension  system,  to \nsupport prudent fiscal management and ensure retirement income \nsecurity for civil servants; \n\n(iii)  civil service reforms, for a responsive, efficient, and effective civil \n\nservice;  \n\n(iv)  broad  measures  supporting  private  sector  development,  for \n\neconomic growth, job creation, and poverty reduction;  \n\n(v)  attainment  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  by \n\n(vi) \n\n2015; and  \nimproved  access  to  justice,  for  greater  legal  and  regulatory \ncertainty and enforceability in all economic spheres. \n\n \nBuilding  on  the  PRMP  and  other  programs,  PGEIP  will  support  the \nGoPb  in  realizing  the  long-term  goals  expressed  in  Vision  2020, \nthrough  which  the  government  has  committed  itself  to  significantly \nimproving the standard of living of the people of Punjab, especially the \npoor and vulnerable. The PGEIP will improve the overall functioning of \nthe  provincial,  district,  and  municipal  governments  and  the  quality  of \npublic services. The improvements will take the following forms:  \n \n(i) \n(ii) \n\ngreater performance-oriented planning and budgeting;  \na  more  efficient  civil  service,  with  adequate  incentives  and \nmerit-based appointment and career progression;  \n\n(iii)  a funded and well-managed pension system, which increases the \nconfidence  of  civil  servants  and  the  public,  and  generates  fiscal \nspace for high-priority investments in the social sectors; and  \n(iv)  greater  private  sector  contribution  to  growth  and  facilitation  of \n\npublic-private partnerships. \n\n \n \n  \n\nii \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nProgram \nDescription \n\n\f \n\n \n \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\niii\n\ninvolvement \n\nAs  reforms  in  these  areas  are  complex  and  take  time  to  filter  through \nthe  bureaucracy,  PGEIP  will  be  processed  as  a  program  cluster \ncomprising  three  single-tranche  SPs.  This  modality  provides  adequate \nflexibility  to  meet  emerging  reform  needs  and  use  program  conditions \ngenuinely  for  policy  reform,  rather  than  as  rigid  prescriptions.  ADB\u2019s \nManagement  and  Board  will  also  have  greater \nin \nrecommending measures for future operations within a cluster, in a way \nthat  is  not  possible  in  traditional  multiple-tranche  operations.  Separate \nreports and recommendations of the President (RRPs) will be prepared \nfor each subprogram. The policy matrix developed thus far for SP1 has \nindicative  actions  for  SP2  and  SP3.  In  addition,  detailed  action  plans \nwill be developed in combination with policy matrices to guide reforms. \n \nIn order to ensure that all the six pillars of the Vision 2020 are in place, \nthe  GoPb  has  also  sought  ADB\u2019s  support  for  accelerating  the \nattainment  of  the  MDGs  and  implementation  of  provincial-level  judicial \nreforms,  in  addition  to  the  government  efficiency  improvements  under \nPGEIP.  \n \nIn  line  with this  request,  ADB  will  also  prepare  two  additional  program \nclusters, namely the PMDGP and PAJP, in an integrated manner along \nwith  PGEIP  over  2007\u20132011.  The  integrated  approach  and  the \npreliminary details of the PMDGP and PAJP are presented in Appendix \n3  of  this  RRP.  The  integrated  approach  will  improve  program \ncoordination,  reduce  duplication,  minimize  inconsistency  in  policy \nadvice and measures, and focus resources for desired outcomes. \n \nThe  reforms  under  the  three  program  clusters  will  accelerate  and \nsustain economic growth, improve the delivery of public services, create \nmore employment opportunities, and reduce poverty. \n \nGoPb has expressed a strong commitment to accelerating the funding \nof  its  civil  service  pension  system,  so  that  the  annual  pension \nobligations  can  be  made  off-budget  to  the  extent  possible  and  the \nconserved  resources  utilized  for  essential  social  and  infrastructure \ninvestments.  To  translate  this  commitment  to  action,  GoPb  needs \nsignificant resources, for which it has requested financing support over \nthe  next  5  years  through  the  PGEIP,  PMDGP,  and  PAJP  clusters.  In \nparallel,  the  three  clusters  will  also  help  leverage  reforms  in  the \nrespective areas. \n \nFor  the  PGEIP  cluster,  three  well-sequenced  single-tranche  loans  are \nproposed.  The  PMDGP  and  PAJP  clusters  will  be  processed  and \npresented for Board consideration separately over the course of 2008\u2013\n2011.  \n  \nFor  SP1  of  PGEIP,  a  loan  of  $250  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources  (OCR)  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)\u2013based lending facility. The loan will have a term of \n15  years  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  an  interest  rate  to  be \n\n \n\n\fCounterpart Funds \n\nPeriod and \nTranching \n\n \nExecuting Agency  \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\niv \n\n \n\n \n\ndetermined according to ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, and other \nterms and conditions set out in the draft program loan agreement. \n \nThe  Government  of  Pakistan  will  relend  the  local  currency  generated \nfrom  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  to  the  GoPb,  on  the  same  terms  and \nconditions  as  those  extended  by  ADB  to  the  Government.  The  GoPb \nwill assume the foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk. \n  \nSP2  and  SP3  of  the  PGEIP  are  also  envisaged  to  involve  loans  of \n$250 million each, to be reconfirmed by the GoPb and the Government \nof Pakistan in 2008\u20132009 (for SP2) and 2010\u20132011 (for SP3).   \n \nThe local currency counterpart funds generated from the OCR loan will \nbe  used  to  capitalize  the  Pension  Fund  and  the  General  Provident \nFund,  finance  the  costs  of  structural  adjustments,  and  increase  social \nexpenditure. \n \nSP1  of  the  PGEIP  covers  reform  measures  implemented  from  June \n2006  to  October  2007.  The  proceeds  of  the  $250  million  loan  for  the \nsubprogram,  withdrawable  in  a  single  tranche,  will  be  available  after \nloan  effectiveness,  upon  satisfactory  attainment  of  all  agreed  policy \nactions  under  SP1.  The  RRP  for  the  SP2  loan  will  be  submitted  for \nBoard  consideration  about  18\u201320 months  after  the  SP1  loan  becomes \neffective,  subject  to  the  GoPb\u2019s  readiness  to  continue  with  its  reform \nagenda.  Similarly,  the  RRP  for  the  SP3  will  be  submitted  for  Board \nconsideration  about  18\u201320  months  after  SP2  loan  becomes  effective, \nsubject  to  the  government\u2019s  readiness  to  continue  with  the  reform \nagenda. The period of the PGEIP cluster will be from October 2007 to \nlate 2010 or early 2011, and is expected to close on 30 June 2011.  \n \nFor the PGEIP, the Planning and Development Department (P&DD) of \nGoPb will be the Executing Agency (EA).  \n \nA high-level steering committee chaired by the chief secretary of Punjab \nand  comprising  as  members,  the  Planning  and  Development  (P&D) \nchairman,  additional \nsecretary  Services  and  General \nAdministration  Department  (S&GAD),  finance  secretary,  secretaries  of \nImplementing Agencies (IAs), and at least three representatives of civil \nsociety and the private sector, will guide PGEIP implementation. \n \nThe  principal  IAs  for  the  PGEIP  will  be  the  FD  and  P&DD  for  public \nfinancial  management;  FD  for  pension  reforms;  the  Public  Policy  and \nChange  Management  Wing  (PPCMW)  of  S&GAD,  and  Management \nand  Professional  Development  Department  (MPDD)  for  civil  service \nInvestment, \nreforms;  and \nfor  private  sector \nIndustries,  and  Labor  and  Human  Resource \ndevelopment.  Other  departments  and  agencies,  such  as \nthe \nDepartment  of  Health  (DOH)  and  Department  of  Irrigation  and  Power \n(DI&P),  may  also  participate  as  IAs  for  the  pilot-testing  of  the \nperformance-based  budgeting  and  human  resource  management \nschemes.   \n\nthe  Departments  of  Commerce  and \n\nchief \n\n\f \n\n \n\nv\n\nProcurement and \nDisbursement \n\n \nProgram Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \nAn  executive  committee  under  the  P&D  chairman  and  comprising \nmembers from FD and S&GAD, will ensure the efficient implementation \nof  the  PGEIP.  A  program  management  unit  (PMU),  established  for \nPRMP  and  in  place  since  2003,  will  continue  to  be  the  secretariat  for \nthe two committees. \n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  finance  the  foreign  exchange  costs  (excluding \nlocal duties and taxes) of items produced in and procured from ADB\u2019s \nmember countries, excluding ineligible items and imports financed from \nother bilateral and multilateral sources. ADB will have the right to audit \nthe use of the loan proceeds and verify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s \ncertification.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  to  the  Borrower \naccording  to  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and \nRelated Requirements for Program Loans.  \n \nThe  PGEIP  will  significantly  benefit  the  people  of  the  Punjab  through \nthe following:  \n \n(i)  Better  management  of  public \n\nresources  and  more \nperformance-oriented  planning  and  budgeting.  Fiscal \ndiscipline  will  be  effectively  enforced,  resource \nflows  and \nperformance  outcomes  will  be  better  linked,  there  will  be  greater \ncoherence \ndevelopment \nexpenditures,  and  public  service  delivery  will  improve,  with  direct \nbenefit to the poor.  \n\npriorities \n\nbetween \n\npolicy \n\nand \n\n(ii)  A financially sustainable and adequate pension system. There \nwill  be  greater  retirement  income  security  for  civil  servants,  and \nfiscal space will be created for pro-poor expenditures. Longer-term \nbenefits  include  the  promotion  of  private  saving  and  asset \naccumulation,  which  will  contribute  to  economic  growth,  besides \nfinancial sector development.  \n\n(iii)  An  efficient  and  effective  civil  service.  Improved  human \nresource  management  in  the  civil  service  will  increase  value  for \nmoney for the province. The efficiency gains will produce benefits \nin  service  delivery  and  private  sector  development.  A  more \nresponsive  civil  service  will  also  lead  to  more  equitable  public \nexpenditures, with benefit to the poor.  \n\n(iv)  Greater  private  sector  participation.  A  coherent  private  sector \ndevelopment  strategy  and  an  improved  regulatory  framework  will \nhelp  reduce  the  cost  of  doing  business,  and  result  in  greater \nefficiency, investments, growth, and poverty reduction. Likewise, a \nrobust public-private partnership will mobilize resources for better \nservice delivery. \n\n \nOverall,  PGEIP  will  result  in  better  public  services  and  broad-based \neconomic  growth.  Key  derivative  benefits \ninclude  employment \ngeneration and poverty reduction.      \n\n \nAssumption, Risks, \nand Safeguards \n\nThe  realization  of  the  benefits  of  the  PGEIP  depends  on  a  number  of \nassumptions  and  is  subject  to  various  risks.  Mitigating  measures  have \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n\n \nTechnical \nAssistance Loan \n \n \n\n \n\nrisks.  The  PGEIP \n\ntherefore been integrated into the design of the Program. \n \nPolitical risks. Pakistan is in an election year and any political changes \ncould  have  major  administrative  consequences.  But  the  risk  of \nreversing  the  direction of  reforms  is  quite  low  in  the  Punjab,  given  the \nbroad consensus on reforms among the key stakeholders. The flexibility \nbuilt  into  the  single-tranche  operations  also  addresses  any  uncertainty \nin  this  regard,  as  reform  actions  can  be  adjusted  to  suit  the  emerging \nenvironment  as  long  as  the  overall  development  needs  are  met  in  an \nefficient manner without significant distortions.  \n \nGovernance  risks.  Reforms  could  be  undermined  or  delayed  by \nvested interests threatened by greater transparency and accountability. \nBut strong ownership and support for the PGEIP at the highest political \nand bureaucratic levels, coupled with gradually improving incentives for \nbetter  performance,  will  help  mitigate  this  risk.  Further,  the  proposed \nprogram design has benefited from broad stakeholder consultation and \nparticipation.  \n \nImplementation \nimplementation  demands \nconsiderable institutional capacity. Insufficient capacity within the GoPb \nto manage the envisaged reforms could impede implementation. Earlier \nADB  support  has  helped  the  PMU  and  the  government  departments \novercome capacity limitations. In addition, the attached TA loan and TA \ngrants will provide capacity building to ensure reform sustainability.  \n \nExternal \ngeopolitical \nuncertainties,  the  external  environment  has  been  largely  favorable  to \nPakistan  over  the  past  few  years.  The  country\u2019s  macroeconomic \nindicators in the past 5 years have been strong. But the widening trade \nimbalance and current account deficit, insecurity in the region, and the \ncost  of  earthquake  reconstruction  heighten  the  macroeconomic  risks. \nWhile  some  of  the  risks  are  beyond  the  control  of  the  Government  of \nPakistan  and  the  GoPb,  prudent  economic  management  can  lessen \nmacroeconomic vulnerability.  \n \nA  TA  loan  of  $8.8  million  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources will be provided to support public resource management and \nrelated  reforms  in  the  Punjab.  The  loan  will  have  a  term  of  32  years \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  8 years,  an  interest  rate  of  1%  per  year \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter, and other terms \nand conditions set forth in the TA loan and TA program agreements. \n \nThe TA loan is intended to support the implementation of reforms called \nfor  under  the  PGEIP.  Specifically,  the  TA  will  support  policy  advice, \ndiagnostic  studies,  stakeholder  consultations,  and  capacity  building  to \nachieve  (i)  greater  performance  orientation  in  planning  and  budgeting, \n(ii)  a  financially  stable  and  adequate  pension  system  with  improved \nbenefits and wider coverage, (iii) an efficient and effective civil service, \nand  (iv)  a  dynamic  private  sector.  The  TA  loan  will  have  five \ncomponents:  (i) fiscal  and  financial  management,  (ii)  pension  reform, \n\nand  macroeconomic \n\nrisks.  Despite \n\n\f \n\n \n\nvii\n\n(iii) civil service reform, (iv) private sector development, and (v) reform \nmonitoring and evaluation.  \n \nP&DD will be the EA for the TA loan and various IAs will be responsible \nfor their respective components. The main IAs will be FD, P&DD, DOH, \nand DI&P for component 1; FD for component  2; S&GAD and MPDD \nfor  component  3;  the  Departments  of  Commerce  and  Investment, \nIndustries,  and  Labor  and  Human  Resource  for  component  4;  and \nP&DD for component 5.  \n \nConsultants will be recruited according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  A  total  of  140 \nperson-months  of  international  and  156  person-months  of  national \nconsultants will be required. \n \nAn  advisory  TA  for  $950,000  equivalent  will  support  the  effective \nimplementation  of  the  PGEIP  by  improving  the  interface  between  line \nagencies in the GoPb. In parallel, it will also help enhance the fiduciary \ngovernance of the Punjab civil service pension system, and initiate civil \nservice  reforms  as  TA  loan  mobilization  takes  place  over  the  next  6 \nmonths.  A  program  preparatory  TA  for  $900,000  equivalent  will  help \nprepare the proposed PMDGP and PAJP outlined in Appendix 3 of this \nRRP. \n\n \nTechnical \nAssistance Grants \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on:  (i)  a  proposed \nprogram  cluster  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Punjab  Government  Efficiency \nImprovement  Program  (PGEIP)  comprising  three  subprograms;  (ii)  a  proposed  loan  for \nSubprogram  1  of  the  PGEIP;1 and  (iii)  a  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  loan  for  capacity \nbuilding  for  PGEIP.  The  report  also  describes  proposed  TA  for  effective  implementation  of \nPGEIP  and  for  preparation  of  the  Punjab  Millennium  Development  Goals  Program  (PMDGP) \nand  the  Punjab  Access  to  Justice  Program  (PAJP),  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed \nPGEIP  cluster  and  loans,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  will \napprove the two TAs. \n\n    \n\nII. \n\nMACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\nA. \n\nMacroeconomic Performance \n\n2. \nThe Punjab is the largest provincial economy of Pakistan, accounting for over 50% of the \ncountry\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  (GDP).  It  is  also  the  most  populous  province,  with  about \n87 million  inhabitants,  or  56%  of  the  country\u2019s  population.  The  economic  performance  of  the \nPunjab thus plays a critical role in the overall economic strength of Pakistan. At the same time, \nnational policies have a significant impact on the economic conditions in the Punjab.  \n \n3. \nThe economy of Pakistan as a whole has experienced a dramatic turnaround since 2001, \nbehind sustained structural reforms. Real GDP grew by an average of 7% over the past 3 years, \na  vast  improvement  over  the  1.8%  rate  in  2001.  Growth  has  been  supported  by  strong \nconsumption  and  investment,  spurred  in  turn  by  increased  workers\u2019  remittances,  among  other \nthings.  Reflecting  its  continued  commitment  to  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction,  the \nGovernment  of  Pakistan  has  significantly  increased  development  spending,  particularly  in \npro-poor sectors, from 4.8% of GDP in fiscal year (FY) 2005 to 5.6% in FY2006. Prudent debt \nmanagement coupled with strong GDP growth, has led to a significant drop in the ratio of public \ndebt to GDP, from 81.4% in FY2002 to 56.1% in FY2006, and in the ratio of external public debt \nto GDP, from 41.0% to 26.2% over the same period.   \n \n4. \nThe economy of the Punjab has also staged a major turnaround, from a contraction of \n0.9% in FY2001 to strong growth of 7.1% in FY2006. On the back of such performance, about \n3.5 million new jobs have been created each year since 2004, the poverty head-count ratio has \ndeclined by about 11% since 2002, and key social indicators such as the school enrollment rate \nhave  significantly  improved.  Better  fiscal  management  has  also  created  \u201cfiscal  space.\u201d  As  a \nresult  of  strong  growth  and  greater  fiscal  space,  development  expenditures  increased \nsubstantially  in  2003\u20132007  from  0.9%  of  gross  provincial  product  to  2.2%,  while  recurrent \nexpenditures dropped from 4.5% to 4% over the same period. This general trend is expected to \ncontinue in the near future,2 with development expenditures growing by 21% yearly, nearly twice \nas fast as recurrent expenditures, which are expected to grow by 11%.3    \n \n\n                                                 \n1  Appendix 1 presents the Design and Monitoring Framework for PGEIP. \n2   Government of Punjab. Medium Term Budgetary Framework 2008\u20132010. \n3   Supplementary  Appendix  A  describes  the  intergovernmental  fiscal  framework  in  the  Punjab,  and  Supplementary \n\nAppendix B, social indicators and the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  \n\n\fB. \n\nPunjab\u2019s Development Vision, Strategy, and Medium-Term Development Plan  \n\n5. \nDespite  strong  economic  performance,  the  province  is  confronted  by  many  challenges \nthat  face  the  country  as  a  whole,  including  improving  the  investment  climate,  making  exports \nmore  competitive,  sustaining  economic  growth,  accelerating  social  development,  and  reducing \npoverty.  Poverty  remains  high  in  the  Punjab  and  social  indicators  lag  behind  those  in \ncomparable  low-income  countries.  Furthermore,  with  the  labor  force  growing  at  about  3%  per \nyear, the creation of more jobs is a major challenge.  \n \n6. \nFully  aware  of  the  development  challenges,  the  government  of  the  Punjab  (GoPb) \nrecognized  early  on  that  an  efficient  public  sector  is  the  key  to  economic  and  social \ntransformation  in  the  Punjab.  It  designed  and  initiated  the  Punjab  Resource  Management \nProgram  (PRMP)  with  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  support  in  2002,  focusing  on  public \nfinancial  management  and  private  sector  development,  among  others.  Subsequently,  in  June \n2004  GoPb  launched  the  Punjab  Vision  2020,  setting  out  its  main  development  objectives  for \nthe next 15 years. Vision 2020 envisages a doubling of per capita income to about $2,000 within \nthat  period.  The  major  goal  of  the  Vision  2020  is  a  dynamic  economy  with  an  efficient  public \nsector and a productive private sector. It identifies six pillars of reforms: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n\nfiscal  and  public \n\nfinancial  management  and \n\nimproving \nresults-oriented medium-term planning and budgeting system, \nestablishing a well-funded and adequate pension system, \nfostering an efficient civil service, \nfostering  dynamic  private  sector\u2013led  growth  and  public-private  partnerships \n(PPPs),  \naccomplishing the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and \nimproving  access  to  justice  to  enhance  legal  and  regulatory  certainty  and \nenforceability in all economic spheres. \n\ninstituting  a \n\n  \n7. \nGoPb  has  been  a  pioneer  in  public  sector  reforms  in  Pakistan.  It  has  made  significant \ncommitments  and  initiated  key  reforms  in  all  of  the  above  areas.  Yet,  given  the  complexity  of \nchange,  the  Punjab  needs  major  improvements  on  three  fronts:  (i)  enhancing  public  sector \nefficiency;  (ii)  increasing  access  to,  as  well  as  the  quality,  of  public  services,  most  critically  in \neducation,  health  and  water  and  sanitation  sectors;  and  (iii)  accelerating  private  sector \nparticipation in the provision of services. Appendix 2 presents a detailed analysis of the principal \nweaknesses  in  these  areas.  The  province  needs  a  large  infusion  of  public  and  private \ninvestments  to  keep  pace  with  the  growth  requirements  of  its  economy.  With  the  population \ngrowing  at  2.64%  per  year,  Punjab  will  double  its  size  to  over  150  million  people  by  2026.  At \npresent, about 70% of the population is considered as vulnerable (children, women and elderly). \nSignificant  urban-rural  differentials  exist  in  the  availability  and  quality  of  public  services.  Basic \nhealth indicators in the province are poor. Over 40% of villages have no drainage, and only 3% \nof villages have easy access to proper government hospitals. While infant mortality has declined \nfrom  above  120  in  1997  to  below  75  now,  Punjab  is  still  a  long  way  away  from  its  2015 \nMillennium  Development  Goal  (MDG)  target  of  40  per  1,000  live  births.  Likewise,  maternal \nmortality remains high at 300 (as of 2004) against a 2015 target of 140 per 100,000 live births. \nWith  the  growing  urban  congestion  and  rural-urban  inequalities,  Punjab  also  needs  to  invest \nmassively  in  transport,  water  supply  and  sanitation  and  other  infrastructure.  These  cannot  be \nmet  by  the  public  sector  alone.  And,  more  importantly,  the  economy  needs  to  grow  at  a \nsustained 7-8% per year to generate adequate jobs to those entering the labor force.  \n \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3\n\nThe Vision 2020 as well as the current medium-term development strategy of the GoPb \n8. \nprovide  for  continuing  structural  reforms  to  improve  public  sector  efficiency  and  create  an \nenabling  environment  for  the  private  sector.  Public  sector  efficiency  implies  (i)  the  capacity  to \nallocate  scarce  public  resources  in  line  with  development  needs  and  priorities,  and  (ii) the \npresence of a modern civil service that will enable the province to achieve its development goals. \nThe key aspects of an enabling environment for the private sector are (i) a well-functioning legal \nand regulatory framework, (ii) an effective social sector that supports the development of human \ncapital, and (iii) infrastructure services that make Punjab more attractive to domestic and foreign \ninvestors.  \n \nC. \n\nPartnership of the Government with the Asian Development Bank \n\nThe  partnership  for  development  assistance  between  the  Government  of  Pakistan  and \n9. \nADB dates back to over two decades, and spans several sectors. In many instances provincial \ngovernments  have  been  the  direct  recipients  of  that  assistance. 4  ADB\u2019s  assistance  to  the \nPunjab  has  dealt  for  the  most  part  with  (i) public  resource  management  reform,  through  the \nimplementation  of  two  SPs  under  the  comprehensive  PRMP;  and  (ii)  support  for  local \ngovernments  and  service  delivery  through  the  Punjab  Devolved  Social  Services  Program \n(PDSSP). Punjab has also taken part in federally administered ADB programs like the Access to \nJustice  Program  (AJP)  and  the  Decentralization  Support  Program.  For  a  summary  of \nachievements under AJP and Decentralization Support Program, see Supplementary Appendix \nC.  Over  time,  the  PRMP  has  evolved  into  the  Punjab\u2019s  governance  flagship  program.    As \noutlined in Appendix 2, the PRMP and PDSSP have helped Punjab initiate certain foundational \nreforms  under  the  first  four  pillars  of  Vision  2020.  GoPb  has  also  implemented  other  sector \nspecific reform programs in education and irrigation with World Bank support.   \n \n10. \nThe  GoPb  launched  the  Punjab  Development  Forum  (PDF)  in  2003  to  engage  civil \nsociety,  the  private  sector,  and  development  partners  in  policy  dialogue.  The  PDF  is  now  a \nyearly  forum  for  policy  discussions,  stakeholder  consultation,  and  information  dissemination. \nThe PRMP has provided strong support to the PDF, and ADB has been an active participant in \nthe forum. The fourth PDF, in April 2007, set a series of second-generation reforms in motion, \nwith the identified goal of strengthening the public sector and creating an enabling environment \nfor the private sector. Besides the PDF, the PRMP has also supported regular workshops and \nseminars  on  policy  matters.5 The  design  of  the PGEIP  fully  incorporates  ideas  engendered  by \nthe PDF, the workshops, and other stakeholder consultation activities.    \n \nADB\u2019s planned assistance to GoPb is in line with its medium term development agenda. \n11. \nGiven  the  growth  challenges  as  well  as  the  financing  requirements,  GoPb  has  sought  ADB\u2019s \nsupport  for  second  generational  reforms  in  the  first  four  pillars  of  Vision  2020  as  defined  in             \npara.  6.  In  addition,  continuing  on  the  service  delivery  support  through  PDSSP,  it  has  also \nrequested  ADB  for  assistance  in  accelerating  the  attainment  of  the  MDGs  (pillar  5  of  Vision \n2020)  and  in  improving  access  to  justice  in  the  province  (pillar  6  of  Vision  2020).  Besides  the \noverall  reform  and  development  financing  requirements,  the  principal  driver  on  GoPb\u2019s  part  to \nseek program lending support is the need to fund the Punjab civil service pension system which \nis now financed on a pay-as-you-go basis through annual budgetary allocations, amounting to \nPRs17 billion (approximately $280 million) at present (para. 19 below). In present value terms, \nthe  system\u2019s  liabilities  by  2025  are  forecast  at  PRs400  billion  (approximately  $6.6  billion).  In \n\n                                                 \n4   For a comprehensive and well-structured assessment of ADB\u2019s country assistance program for Pakistan in 1986\u2013\n2005, see Operations Evaluation Department. 2007. Country Assistance Program Evaluation for Pakistan. Manila.  \n\n5   For more details, see Supplementary Appendix D. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\norder  to  meet  these  reform  and  financing  requirements,  an  integrated  framework  is  proposed \ncomprising three program clusters. The proposed PGEIP will help implement critical reforms in: \n(i) improving fiscal and financial management, (ii) pensions reform, (iii) civil service reform, and \n(iv)  private  sector  development.  In  parallel,  two  separate  program  clusters  will  be  designed \nseparately.  The  Punjab  MDG  Program,  to  be  designed  and  presented  to  the  Board  for \nconsideration  in  2008  for  implementation  over  2008-2011,  will  build  on  the  achievements  of \nPDSSP  and  focus  on  public  services  delivery  particularly  in  the  health  sector,  and  introduce \nviable health financing mechanisms. The Punjab AJP, to be designed in parallel and brought to \nthe  Board  for  consideration  in  2008,  will  build  on  reforms  introduced  through  the  federal  AJP \nand  focus  on  deepening  judicial  reforms  at  the  provincial  level,  leading  to  a  well-functioning \njudiciary  supported  by  measures  on  alternate  dispute  resolution  mechanisms  and  greater \nenforceability of contracts. This integrated framework is defined in greater detail in Appendix 3. \n  \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, ISSUES, AND OPPORTUNITIES6 \n\nA. \n\nIssues and Opportunities with Reference to the Proposed PGEIP    \n\n1. \n\nNeed for More Performance-Oriented Budgeting  \n\n12. \nBackground. The experience of countries worldwide has shown that the medium-term \nexpenditure  framework  (MTEF),  which  combines  a  top-down  approach  to  fiscal  planning  with \nbottom-up  estimates  of  the  current  and  medium-term  costs  of  sector  programs,  can  be  a \nvaluable  tool  in  public  expenditure  management.  The  GoPb  has  made  considerable  progress \ntoward  adopting  a  medium-term  approach  to  fiscal  planning.  The  PRMP  supported  the \nintroduction  of  a  medium-term  budget  framework  (MTBF)  and  a  medium-term  development \nframework  (MTDF),  with  3-year  projections  of  the  aggregate  resources  for  the  recurrent  and \ndevelopment budgets, respectively. The Finance Department (FD) prepares the MTBF, and the \nPlanning and Development Department (P&DD), the MTDF. But despite the progress made in \nrecent years, fiscal and public financial management in Punjab is still hampered by a number of \nissues.7 \n \n13.  Weak  Budget  Preparation  and  Execution,  and  Poor  Performance  Orientation. \nBudgeting in Punjab is a dual system: the FD prepares and manages the recurrent budget, and \nP&DD,  the  development  budget.  Line  departments  submit  their  recurrent  and  development \nexpenditure  estimates  to  FD  and  P&DD,  respectively,  which  in  turn  makes  the  final  budget \nallocations. Recurrent budget estimates are based on historical trends, with yearly increments to \ncover  additional  costs.  The  development  budget  consists  of  ongoing  programs  and  new \nprograms  that  will  start  in  the  new  fiscal  year.  A  major  shortcoming  of  this  incremental  and \ninput-oriented approach is that budget allocations hardly reflect sectoral service delivery goals \nand  priorities.  For  lack  of  a  robust  mechanism  for  preparing  budget  estimates,  the  line \ndepartments must often ask the FD for supplementary grants during the fiscal year to augment \ntheir  initial  budgetary  allocations. 8 There  is  no  periodic  review  of  recurrent  expenditures  to \n\n                                                 \n6   This section should be read in conjunction with Appendix 2.  \n7   A  comprehensive  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability  (PEFA)  assessment  for  the  Punjab  was \ncompleted in April 2007  with the support of ADB, the World Bank, the Department for International Development \n(DFID)  of  the  United  Kingdom,  and  the  European  Commission.  The  main  findings  of  the  assessment  are \nsummarized in Appendix 4.  \n\n8   The  need  to  further  improve  budget  preparation  and  execution  was  also  underscored  in  the  PEFA  assessment, \nwhich gave a rating of \u201cD\u201d to the composition of expenditure outturn versus the original approved budget, meaning \nthat the government is performing below international standards.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n\nidentify  opportunities  to  reallocate  resources  and  increase  the  efficiency  of  public  spending.9 \nMidyear monitoring of budget execution is limited to assessing whether the expenditures of line \ndepartments  conform  to  the  budgeted  amounts.  Budget  performance  is  not  monitored,  and \nirregularities  are  not  corrected.  Dual  budgeting  impedes  the  comprehensive  analysis  of \ngovernment operations and the evaluation of their outcomes and results. As brought out in the \npublic  expenditure  and  financial  accountability  (PEFA)  assessment  of  the  audit  function  (see \nfootnote  7),  accountability  in  the  use  of  public  resources  needs  strengthening.  The  quality  of \ninternal  audit  was  rated  substandard  (\u201cC\u201d),  as  audit  reports  are  not  prepared  regularly  and \ninternal audit recommendations are not followed up. The external audit function was also rated \nsubstandard  (\u201cD\u201d)  because  audit  reports  are  submitted  late  and  there  is  little  response  to  or \nfollow-up of audit observations by the entities concerned. Finally, though legislative scrutiny of \nexternal audit reports is quite extensive and detailed, the examination of these reports is often \nsubstantially delayed (D).  \n\n \n\n14. \nLow  Value  for  Money  in  Public  Service  Delivery.  Since  devolution,  the  district \ngovernments  have  been  primarily  responsible  for  education  and  health  care,  and  the  tehsil \nmunicipal  administration  (TMAs) 10   and  the  union  councils,  for  water  supply  and  sanitation. \nImproved service delivery is a major tenet of devolution.  \n \n15. \nHowever,  service  devolution  has  been  difficult  to  implement  effectively.  A  primary \nconstraint is  the  mismatch  between  functional  responsibilities  and  financial  resources.  Despite \ntheir increased responsibilities, local governments derive their revenues chiefly from taxes with \na  narrow  base  and  buoyancy, 11  and  therefore  depend  on  transfers  from  the  federal  and \nprovincial governments. Most local governments are also unable to provide adequate services \nbecause  of  weak  human  capital,  infrastructure,  and  facilities,  and  the  lack  of  incentives  to \nprovide good services.  \n \n16. \nLimited  Integration  between  Budgeting  and  Planning.  The  MTBF  and  the  MTDF \nneed to be combined into a single MTEF, which integrates the top-down resource envelope with \nthe  bottom-up  sector  programs  in  the  annual  budget  process.  However,  the  MTBF  and  the \nMTDF as currently implemented in the Punjab represent only the top-down dimension, as they \nare  estimated  entirely  by  central  departments.  Line  departments  in  fact  have  only  limited \ninvolvement  in  determining  the  final  allocation  of  resources  and  expenditure  ceilings.  The \nannual budget and the MTBF differ in format, making it difficult to reconcile the two documents, \nthough the annual budget should be identical to the first year of the MTBF. Budget projections \nare  not  driven  by  official  costing  guidelines  or  performance  targets,  and  are  not  based  on  the \nbudget ceilings defined for individual departments. In the case of the recurrent budget, the FD \ngives  an  informal  indication  of  the  likely  allowable  increase,  while  in  the  case  of  the \ndevelopment  budget,  much  of  the  annual  development  program  is  already  known,  as  this \ncomprises expenditure on ongoing projects and on projects that will start in the new budget year \nand that have already been approved and prioritized. As a result, there is no robust link between \n\n                                                 \n9   When  a  development  project  is  completed,  its  recurrent  expenditures  are  treated  as  new  expenditure  on  the \nrecurrent budget for 3 years before being absorbed into the regular budget, if their continuation is still justified. In \npractice, however, periodic review of new expenditures rarely occurs and some recurrent expenditures have been \nrolled over as new expenditures for up to 18 years. For more details, see the sector analysis in Appendix 2.  \n\n10  TMA is the second layer of the local government system created by the devolution. The local government system \n\nincludes district governments, TMAs, and union councils. \n\n11  Since devolution, district governments have been assigned education and health taxes and various licensing and \nservice fees. Similarly, the TMAs have been assigned very minor fees in addition to the urban immovable property \ntax (UIPT). However, because of capacity constraints among the TMAs the UIPT is still collected by the provincial \ngovernment and transferred back to the TMAs. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\nthe  aggregate  projections  in  the  MTBF  and  MTDF  and  the  government\u2019s  medium-term  fiscal \npolicy. \n \n17.  Weak  Tax  Administration. Tax administration capacity is one of the weakest areas in \nthe GoPb\u2019s public financial management, and the government for this reason cannot fully exploit \nits  revenue-generation  capacity.12 The  GoPb  began  the  reform  of  major  taxes,  including  the \nstamp duty, the agriculture income tax, and the urban immovable property tax, under the PRMP, \nto  boost  provincial  revenue,  but  was  constrained  by  weaknesses  in  tax  administration.  At \npresent, tax administration in the province is the responsibility of two separate departments: the \nBoard of Revenue and the Excise and Taxation Department. The Board of Revenue administers \nstamp  duties  and  the  agriculture  income  tax,  while  the  Excise  and  Taxation  Department \nadministers  the  rest  of  the  taxes.  This  dual  authority  results  in  inefficiencies  and  revenue \nleakages. Poor record-keeping also impairs proper assessment of the effective tax liability. The \nweak capacity of tax administrators further compounds the poor performance of the tax system.  \n \n\n2. \n\nNeed for a Stronger Civil Service Pension System \n\n18. \nBackground.  With  about  one  million  civil  servants  and  about  388,000  pensioners,  the \ngovernment is the largest employer in the Punjab. The pension system has two main pillars: the \nPunjab  Pension  System  (PPS)  and  the  General  Provident  Fund  (GPF).  Membership  in  both \nschemes is mandatory. The pension system faces the following key challenges.  \n \n19.  Weak Fiscal and Financial Sustainability. The PPS is a defined benefit system that is \nnoncontributory  and  unfunded,  and  is  financed  from  the  annual  budget  of  the  provincial \ngovernment.  The  GPF  is  also  an  unfunded  defined  contribution  scheme.  Civil  servants\u2019 \ncontributions to the GPF are not invested to meet future liabilities, which are financed through \nthe  general  budget.  Liabilities  arising  from  pension  and  GPF  obligations  make  up  the  largest \ncategory  of  the  province\u2019s  implicit  liabilities.  Preliminary  actuarial  estimates  indicate  that  the \npresent discounted value of the GoPb\u2019s pension liability could be as high as PRs400 billion. The \noutstanding  GPF  balance,  including  contributions  and  interest  credited,  is  reported  at  PRs15 \nbillion.  Pension  and  GPF  outlays  have  escalated  in  recent  years,  and  in  2006  amounted  to \nPRs12.6  billion  and  PRs4.3  billion,  respectively,  significantly  larger  than  the  government\u2019s \nspending on public health (PRs5.5 billion) and agriculture (PRs2.5 billion). \n \n20. \nThe  GoPb  recognizes  that  its  pension  obligations  have  important  implications  for  the \nfinances  of  the  province,  and  that  pension  expenditures,  if  unchecked,  could  crowd  out \ninvestment in the infrastructure and social sectors.     \n \n21. \nGaps  in  Pension  Record-Keeping,  Administration,  and  Payment.  In  conducting  its \npayroll functions, the Office of the Accountant General, Punjab (AGP) records the employment \nhistory  of  civil  servants.  At  retirement,  the  worker  submits  an  application  to  the  office,  which \ncalculates  the  worker\u2019s  benefits.  Pension  payments  are  made  monthly  through  a  designated \npayment  agent  at  a  branch  of  the  National  Bank  of  Pakistan  (NBP).  The  balance  on  the  GPF \naccount is taken as a lump sum at retirement. \n \n22. \nRecord-keeping  and  benefit  calculations  are  largely  manual  and  paper-based.  The \nabsence of a robust record-keeping and information management system, combined with weak \nfinancial analysis and accounting capacity, has resulted in inaccuracies in pension entitlement \n\n                                                 \n12 The recent PEFA assessment rated tax administration capacity substandard (\u201cC+\u201d) with respect to transparency of \ntaxpayer obligations and liabilities, and effectiveness of measures for taxpayer registration and tax assessment.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7\n\ncalculation  and  individual  payments.  Cases  of  missing  contributions,  and  therefore  missing \ninvestment  returns  on  the  GPF,  are  widespread.  Moreover,  there  is  no  formal  channel  for \ninquiries or appeals by pensioners when such errors and omissions occur.   \n \nThe  process  of  pension  disbursement  is  costly  due  to  cumbersome  application  and \n23. \nidentification  requirements,  and  often  long  queues  in  rural  areas  of  NBP  branches  due  to \ninadequate staff. The present system generates payment notice to the authorized NBP branch \non a transaction-by-transaction basis, and does not include monthly authorized allocation. This \nnot  only  further  increases  the  cost of  pension disbursement,  but  also makes  the system  more \nerror-prone.  There  is  no  mechanism  for  triggering  an  action  when  questionable  transactions \noccur. This results in significant leakages from the system in the form of \u201cghost\u201d pensioners.  \n \n24.  Weaknesses  in  Benefit  Structure.  Certain  features  of  the  current  pension  scheme \nhave  led  to  inequitable  and  arbitrary  outcomes  among  individual  employees.  For  instance, \ncalculating pensions on the basis of the last pay drawn by an employee can favor those who get \na salary increase or a promotion immediately before retirement. The international best practice  \nis to base pensions on average earnings over several years. Increases in pension benefits, to \ncompensate  for  changes  in  the  cost  of  living,  are  ad  hoc  and  often  trail  inflation.  Interest \npayments  by  the  government  on  employees\u2019  GPF  contributions  are  likewise  unpredictable. \nCurrently, up to 35% of the pension can be commuted and taken as a lump sum, while the rest \nis paid as an annuity until death. The commutation allowance is high by international standards, \nand may not be consistent with the public policy objective of facilitating consumption-smoothing \nand ensuring adequate old-age income for civil servants. \n \nSince  2005,  most  civil  servants  have  been  contractual  employees  without  pension and \n25. \nGPF  benefits.  More  than  50,000  employees  thus  far  have  been  affected  by  this  arrangement, \nwhich  has  raised  concerns  about  workplace  morale,  and  the  longer-term  social  and  economic \nimplications  of  having  a  significant  proportion  of  civil  servants  with  little  or  no  savings  and  no \npension benefits. \n \n\n3. \n\nNeed for a More Merit-Based and Accountable Civil Service \n\nBackground.  The  public  sector  employs  about  11%  of  employed  workers  in  the \n26. \nprovince,  including  about  967,000  in  sanctioned  posts  in  government  departments  and  the \n100,000-plus  employees  of  the  123  public  sector  autonomous  bodies.  While  this  share  is \nmoderate, it understates the importance of the public sector as a major formal sector employer, \nsince about 60% of all employees are self-employed. The civil service wage bill and pensions \naccount for about 59% of total consolidated recurrent expenditure. The need to reform the civil \nservice has been felt at both national and provincial levels. Despite various attempts at reform, \nthe system is commonly perceived to be the same holdover from Pakistan\u2019s colonial past. Some \nof the issues related to public sector employment in the Punjab are discussed below. \n \n27.  Weak  Recruitment,  Performance  Evaluation,  and  Promotion.  The  Punjab  Public \nService Commission (PPSC) recruits public servants for basic pay scale (BPS) 1713 and above. \nThe  structural,  capacity,  and  procedural  constraints  on  the  functioning  of  the  commission  are \nwidely  acknowledged.  Performance  evaluation  has  also  not  been  an  effective  tool  for \nperformance  monitoring.  A  large  proportion  of  civil  servants  do  not  have  job  descriptions,  let \n                                                 \n13 The civil service of Pakistan is structured across twenty two basic pay scales (BPS 1-22). With some exceptions, \nthe government officers of BPS 17 and higher are categorized as gazetted officers and assigned middle to senior \nlevel managerial responsibilities such as heads of sections, departments, field offices and drawing and disbursing \nofficers. Government servants below BPS 17 generally work as support staff. \n\n \n\n\falone  targets  for  achievement.  The  annual  confidential  report,  instead  of  being  a  performance \nevaluation  record,  is  commonly  regarded  as  a  compliance  task.  Moreover,  performance \nevaluations play a limited role in career progression in a system in which promotions are largely \nbased on seniority.  \n \n28. \nUncompetitive  Compensation  and  Benefits.  There  is  substantial  evidence  that  the \nreal  compensation  gap  between  public  and  private  salaries  and  emoluments  has  steadily \nwidened.  In  addition,  the  wage  structure  is  not  closely  linked  to  performance  and  does  not \nprovide  adequate  incentives  for  good  performance.  The  provincial  government  has  no  control \nover  civil  service  salary  scales,  which  are  set  by  the  federal  Government.  It  can,  however, \ncreate  contract  positions  outside  the  cadre  scales  or  pay  additional  allowances  for  specific \npositions.  For  example,  program  management  units  (PMUs)  have  been  used  as  a  device  to \ncreate  specific  positions  attracting  higher  reward.  There  is some  evidence  suggesting  that  the \nrecruitment  and  remuneration  practice  of  PMUs  has  strengthened  performance  incentives. \nPMUs thus should be seen as a testing case and precursor for introducing performance-based \nhuman resource management in the civil service of the province. \n \n29. \nAchievement  and  Sustainability  of  the  Contractual  Employment  System.  Civil \nservices  reforms  are  a  challenging  task  for  any  government.  Despite  this,  the  GoPb  has \nimplemented  some  important  measures.  One  major  reform  initiative  since  2003  has  been  the \nshift  toward  contract  employment  for  fresh  entrants  into  government  service.  Contractual \nemployees are paid 30% above the minimum salary of the relevant pay scale as compensation \nfor not being eligible for pension. However, the difference in compensation between regular and \ncontract  employees  is  not  large  enough  to  discourage  employees  from  seeking  regularization. \nThe pressure to regularize contract employees is building up as their numbers increase.  \n \n30. \nFrequent  Transfers.  There  are  no  systematic  policies  or  mechanisms  for  placements \nand transfers. In many cases, the process lacks a professional and technical basis, leading to a \nmismatch  between  skills  and  placement.  Transfers  are  often  made  within  a  year  of  service, \nrather  than  the  recommended  minimum  of  2\u20133  years.  As  such,  the  incumbents  often  barely \nhave time to settle into a new job before they are moved on. \n \n31.  Weak  Technical  and  Managerial  Skills.  A  World  Bank  report 14 points  out  that  the \ntechnical  competence  of  civil  servants  in  the  Punjab  has  been  declining  over  the  past  two \ndecades. The training of civil servants also draws little interest because of its low returns. The \nGoPb has, however, increased its efforts in the training area in recent years. Supported by the \nPRMP, the government entered into a short-term arrangement with the Singapore Civil Service \nCollege to undertake various training programs. Such efforts mark an encouraging step toward \nimproving  the  capacity  of  civil  servants.  However,  much  remains  to  be  done  to  upgrade  the \ncapacity, incentives, and accountability of the system. \n \n32. \nChallenges  Posed  by  Devolution.  The  Punjab  Local  Government  Ordinance  of 2001 \n(PLGO)  launched  the  process  of  devolution  and  significantly  changed  intergovernmental \nrelationships.  Given  the  relatively  short  time  that  has  passed  since  then,  there  is  continuing \nconfusion over the roles, functions, and mandates of the different levels of government and the \nmechanisms for coordination between departments and agencies. The lack of capacity in local \n\n                                                 \n14 World  Bank.  2004.  Pakistan:  Public  Sector  Capacity  Building  Project.  Washington,  DC.  Available: \n\nwww.worldbank.org  \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\ngovernment for such key functions as planning, budgeting, and human resource management is \nalso a major constraint on the effective functioning of this level of government. \n \n\n4. \n\nNeed for Dynamic Private Sector\u2013Led Growth and Public-Private \nPartnerships  \n\n33. \nBackground. The Punjab economy has sustained GDP growth rates of more than 6% \nper  year  since  2003.  Investment  rates  have  recovered  in  recent  years.  The  agriculture  and \nservice sectors have been performing well and the Punjab has attracted a major share of recent \nforeign direct investment inflow. The province has thus been able to generate new employment \nopportunities, and to reduce poverty significantly. The private sector still operates mostly in the \ninformal  sector,  as  the  high  cost  of  doing  business  presents  a  significant  barrier  to  entry.  The \ngovernment,  on  the  other  hand,  recognizes  that  it  cannot  meet  on  its  own  the  significant \ninvestment requirements in infrastructure and other services. The remaining challenges include \nthe following: \n \nUnclear  Role  of  the  GoPb  in  Private  Sector  Development.  The  role  of  the \n34. \ngovernment in private sector development  must be better defined. It must be clarified that the \ngovernment  is  expected  to  (i)  formulate  and  implement  laws,  rules,  and  procedures  to  govern \nthe  functions  of  the  private  sector;  (ii)  make  the  regulatory  framework  more  efficient  and \neffective, (iii) provide infrastructure facilities; (iv) provide social sector services; and (v) resolve \nissues  related  to  the  provision  and  the  treatment  of  public  goods,  as  well  as  collective  action \nissues that affect key sectors in the provincial economy.  \n \n35.  Weak  Prioritization  and  Coordination  of  Policy  for  Private  Sector  Development. \nPrivate  sector  development  initiatives  and  measures  intended  to  give  the  private  sector  a \ngreater  role  in service delivery  are  poorly  coordinated.  The  GoPb  lacks  a  coherent  strategy  in \nthis  area.  There  have  so  far  been  only  limited  attempts  to  assess  public  sector  support,  to \nprioritize activities and improve their coordination, and to identify gaps in policy objectives and \nprogram implementation. \n \n36. \nHigh  Regulatory  and  Compliance  Costs  of  Doing  Business  in  the  Punjab. \nRegulatory and compliance costs continue to be major concerns for businesses in the Punjab. \nWhile costs and time involved have gone down in areas like business start-up and closure, and \nimport and  export administration, they are a persistent challenge in other  areas  like  access  to \ncredit,  contract  enforcement,  and  infrastructure  (electricity,  water  and  sanitation,  roads, \ntransport). The government must benchmark the direct and indirect costs of doing business, and \nundertake effective assessments of the benefits and costs of regulation.  \n \n37.  Weak Compliance of Firms with International Standards. The private sector is losing \nout to competitors in the region because it fails to comply with international standards for labor, \nenvironmental  protection,  and  quality.  The  private  sector  must  become  better  informed  about \nthe legal requirements for production and export. The GoPb, for its part, should ensure that the \ninformation  is  disseminated,  implementing  agencies  coordinate  their  activities,  appropriate \ncapacity is built, and current regulations are reviewed.   \n \n38. \nAbsence  of  a  Policy  and  Regulatory  Framework  for  Public-Private  Partnerships. \nSome  services  have  traditionally  been  provided  by  the  public  sector,  for  historical,  legal,  or \neconomic reasons. Yet within these sectors the public sector feels that it cannot deliver services \nof the quality and quantity required to meet the demand. The government lacks the financial and \ntechnical resources to meet the demand in these two broad categories of services: (i) key social \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\nsector services like health and education, and (ii) infrastructure (roads, utilities, water, sanitation, \nsolid waste management). In both these areas the private sector can help narrow or close the \ngap between demand and supply. PPPs can be structured effectively in such cases. However, \nthe  rules  of  the  game  are  not  clear  at  present.  A  clear  policy  and  regulatory  framework  is \nneeded to guide the formation of such PPPs in the Punjab.  \n \nB. \n\n \nLessons  \n\nA large number of program loans have been implemented by ADB and the World Bank \n39. \nover the past decade with mixed results. These offer useful lessons for improving policy-based \nlending. ADB\u2019s program lending in Pakistan, and particularly in the Punjab, also demonstrates \nimportant lessons to be reflected in the PGEIP and other proposed clusters. \n  \n40. \nUsing Policy Conditions as an Evolving Tool for Reforms. A review of policy-based \nlending  by  ADB  and  the  World  Bank15 shows  that  it  has  become  an  important  instrument  for \nsupporting  reforms.  One  major  concern,  however,  arises  from  the  evidence  that  many  reform \nprograms were structured around unrealistic conditions that were prescriptive, rigid, numerous \nyet not well prioritized, and unsoundly assessed for ownership and institutional capacity. While a \nkey reason for rigid conditions was to make reforms more binding, rigidity has not been effective \nin  making  policy  changes.  Instead,  experience  has  shown  that  policy  adjustments  during \nimplementation  may  be  required  by  changing  domestic  and  international  circumstances,  new \nand  better  ways  of  doing  things,  or  unforeseen  design  shortcomings.  Thus,  one  important \nlesson  is  that  policy  conditions  should  be  based  on  sound  diagnostic  analysis,  geared  to \nrespond  to  evolving  circumstances,  and  structured  around  open  and  informed  debate  about \npolicy reform to nurture desired changes.  \n \n41. \nImproving  Integration  between  Programs.  ADB  often  supports  several  lending \nprograms  to  a  country,  or  a  province  in  the  case  of  the  Punjab.  Integration  and  coordination \nbetween  programs  must  be  strengthened  to  reduce  duplication  and  conflicting  policy  advice. \nThe integrated approach offers one clear way to achieve this objective.  \n \n42. \nSecuring  Political  and  Bureaucratic  Ownership.  A  prerequisite  for  successful \nprogram  implementation  is  strong  political  and  bureaucratic  ownership.  The  implementation  of \nthe  PRMP  indicates  that  assistance  from  development  agencies  can  play  a  catalytic  role  in \nbringing  about  desired  changes.  However,  external  assistance  by  itself  cannot  substitute  for \ngovernment commitment and actions. Thus, for effective development results, the policy agenda \nneeds to be backed by broader country or provincial public sector reforms that are owned and \ndriven by the government. Reforms must therefore be home-grown.   \n \n43. \nEffectively  Communicating  with  the  Public  on  Reforms.  Reforms  need  to  be \npreceded  by  sensitization  and  awareness  initiatives  to  build  constituencies  for  change.  In \nparticular, communication and measures that address the concerns of people who are likely to \nbe  affected  by  reforms  are  necessary  to  reduce  opposition.  Program  costs  as  well  as  TA \nallocation need to explicitly factor in resources needed for communication. Broader stakeholder \nparticipation  is  also  needed  to  obtain  adequate  buy-in  and  to  diminish  the  influence  of  vested \ninterests.  \n \n\n                                                 \n15 ADB. 2003.

Washington, DC: World Bank. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11\n\ninvolve  one  executing  agency  (EA)  and  several \n\nAligning  Resources  and  Incentives  with  Desired  Reform  Outcomes.  Given  the \n44. \ncomplexity of reforms, dedicated teams need to be put in place to drive and coordinate activities. \nIdeally,  there  should  be  clear  terms  of  reference  and  performance-related  incentives  for  the \nteams. Nurturing the capacity of the implementing agencies (IAs) is also essential in institution \nIAs.  The \nbuilding.  Most  programs \nimplementation arrangements need to strike a balance between fostering the central role of the \nEA and creating a sense of ownership in each IA.  \n \nConsidering  Reforms  as  Long-Term  Endeavors.  Public  resource  management \n45. \nreforms  entail  a  variety  of  critical  institutional  and  cultural  changes  and  are  almost  always \ndifficult  and  lengthy.  Policy  programs  generally  also  need  at  least  4\u20135  years  to  establish  a \n\u201creform  mind-set\u201d  in  the  government.  Reforms  should  therefore  be  supported  by  instruments \nthat allow adequate time for implementation.  \n \n46. \nDesigning  Technical  Assistance.  Policy  reforms  often  require  TA  support.  The  TA \ndesign  needs  to  be  flexible  enough  to  reflect  demand-driven  activities.  TA  implementation \nprocedures need to be simplified to increase efficiency and reduce transaction costs, while also \nbuilding  in  strong  governance  and  accountability  mechanisms.  Establishing  an  effective \nmechanism for responding to lessons learned on TA design and implementation within ADB is \nalso important.   \n \nC. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector \n\n47. \nThe PMU of the PRMP is mandated to coordinate all donor-funded policy programs and \nprojects in the Punjab. This institutionalization of donor coordination at the provincial level has \nled  to  regular  coordination  meetings  with  all  the  development  partners  involved.  The  PMU \nbelongs  to  the  provincial  Planning  and  Development  Department  and  issues  minutes  of  these \nmeetings, further facilitating donor coordination.  \n \n48. \nThe PGEIP was designed in close coordination with other development partners. While \nthe  Program  is  fully  aligned  with  the  development  strategy  of  the  GoPb  and  ADB\u2019s  country \nstrategy,  it  is  also  intended  to  complement  existing  donor  assistance.  The  Project  for \nImprovement  in  Financial  Reporting  and  Auditing  (PIFRA),  supported  by  the  World  Bank,  is \naimed at improving the accuracy and timeliness of intra-year and year-end government financial \nand  fiscal  reports  at  the  federal,  provincial,  and  district  levels.  In  the  area  of  public  service \ndelivery,  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Punjab  Irrigation  Sector  Development  Policy  Loan  is  supporting \nreforms to (i) improve transparency and equity of water distribution, (ii) increase the participation \nand empowerment of water users in irrigation service delivery, and (iii) build the capacity of the \nIrrigation and Power Department. Likewise, the World Bank\u2013supported Punjab Education Sector \nReform  Program  is  aimed  at  improving  the  quality  of  education  and  improving  enrollment  and \nretention.  The  Faisalabad  Devolution  Project,  supported  by  the  Department  for  International \nDevelopment (DFID) of the UK, seeks to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the district \ngovernment to better meet the needs of local communities.  \n \nThe World Bank and DFID are also supporting tax administration reforms at the federal \n49. \nlevel. The World Bank\u2019s Pakistan Tax Administration Reform Project is aimed at strengthening \nthe  Central  Board  of  Revenue  to  promote  voluntary  compliance,  increased  revenue  yield,  and \nmore equitable application of tax laws. The DFID-supported Tax Administration Reform Project \nseeks  to  improve  tax  administration  through  the  adoption  of  an  integrated  tax  management \nsystem.    Further  details  on  these  and  other  related  projects  are  in  Appendix  5,  which  also \npresents  information  on  the  support  provided  by  DFID  in  Pakistan  and  the  Punjab.  ADB  will \n\n \n\n\fcontinue to coordinate with other development partners during implementation to avoid overlap \nand to maximize synergies. \n \nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PUNJAB GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n50. \nThe  PGEIP  will  support  the  GoPb  in  realizing  its  long-term  goals  as  expressed  in  the \nPunjab  Vision  2020,  where  it  commits  to  significantly  improve  the  standard  of  living  of  the \npeople of Punjab, especially the poor and the vulnerable. The proposed PGEIP will improve the \noverall functioning of the government machinery at the provincial, district, and municipal levels, \nand thereby improve the quality of public services. The high level impact of the PGEIP will be \nsustained  high  levels  of  economic  growth  resulting  in  lower  poverty  incidence  and  improved \npublic services. The principal outcomes of the PGEIP will be greater efficiency in the allocation \nof scarce public resources and greater responsiveness of the government to the needs of the \ncitizens. PGEIP will achieve these through reforms leading to:  \n \n\ngreater performance orientation in planning and budgeting;  \na fully funded and well-managed civil service pension system that increases the \nconfidence of civil servants and the public, and generates fiscal space for high-\npriority social sector investments; \nimproved  efficiency  of  the  civil  service  apparatus,  with  sound  incentives  and \nmerit-based appointment and career progression; and  \ngreater  private  sector  contribution  to  growth  and  sustainable  public-private \npartnerships. \n\nBuilt on the GoPb\u2019s own second-generation reform agenda, the PGEIP encompasses a \n\n \n51. \nrange of interlinked and complementary policy actions in four core policy areas (CPAs):   \n \n\nCPA  1:  Improving  fiscal  and  financial  management  by  (a)  improving \ncoordination between medium-term budgeting and planning including integration \nbetween  the  MTBF  and  the  MTDF,  and  between  the  annual  budget  and  the \nmedium-term  budget  and  planning  framework;  (b)  increasing  the  transparency \nand  accountability  of  budget  preparation  and  execution; \n(c)  achieving \nperformance orientation in annual budgeting by linking the process more closely \nwith  service  delivery;  and  (d)  improving  revenue  mobilization  through  better  tax \nadministration at decentralized levels in the Punjab province. \n\nCPA 2: Establishing a financially sustainable pension system that provides \nretirement  income  security  to  civil  servants  by  (a)  establishing  the  Punjab \nPension  Fund  (PPF)  and  the  General  Provident  Investment  Fund  (GPIF)  to \nreduce  the  growing  fiscal  burden  of  pension  and  GPF  liabilities,  and  to  create \nfiscal  space  for  priority  development  expenditures;  (b)  improving  PPF  and  GPF \nrecord-keeping  and  administration  procedures  to  ensure  accurate  and  timely \npayment of benefits to pensioners; and (c) strengthening the pension system to \nenhance pension benefits and coverage, to include contractual employees.  \n\n(iii) \n\nCPA 3: Fostering an efficient and effective civil service by (a) establishing an \ninstitutional foundation that drives civil service reforms, (b) improving the human \npilot-testing \nresource  management \nfor \nin  selected \nperformance-based  human \n\n(c) \nresource  management  systems \n\nservants, \n\npolicies \n\ncivil \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\n \n\n \n\n \nB. \n\ndepartments and positions, (d) improving the GoPb\u2019s functions and streamlining \nbusiness processes, and (e) increasing capacity building for civil servants.  \n\n(iv) \n\nCPA  4:  Fostering  dynamic  private  sector\u2013led  growth  and  public-private \npartnerships  by  (a)  increasing  the  scope  for  private  sector\u2013led  growth  through \nprioritized  and  streamlined  policies  and  regulations,  and  reduced  government \nparticipation in market activities; and (b) promoting public-private partnerships in \nsocial services and infrastructure provision. \n\nOutputs and Activities \n\n52. \nThe  design  and  monitoring  framework  for  the  overall  PGEIP  is  in  Appendix  1,  the \ndevelopment  policy  letter  is  in  Appendix  6,  and  the  policy  matrix  for  SP1  is  in  Appendix  7. \nSupplementary  Annex  D  presents  an  action  plan  that  fully  lays  out  all  the  steps  involved  in \nachieving  the  policy  actions  in  Appendix  7.  The  reform  elements  under  each  of  the  CPAs  are \ndescribed below.  \n \n\n1. \n\nOutput of Core Policy Area 1: Improved Fiscal and Financial Management \n\na. \n\nImprove Public Resource Management \n\n53. \nThe compartmentalized approach to the preparation of medium-term plans (MTDF) and \nbudgets  (MTBF)  is  a  major  obstacle  to  effective  public  financial  management.  Therefore,  a \nmajor objective of reform under the PGEIP will be to improve the integration between the MTBF \nand MTDF and increase the transparency and accountability of the annual budget process. This \nwill  be  achieved  through  increased  cooperation  between  the  FD  and  the  P&DD  (i.e.,  central \ndepartments),  and  between  central  and  line  departments.  Increased  cooperation  will  further \nfacilitate the integration between the top-down and the bottom-up dimensions of the MTBF and \nMTDF,  including  timely  communication  from  the  FD  to  other  departments  of  the  resources \navailable  over  the  next  3  years,  improved  capacity  of  line  departments  to  appraise  and \ndetermine  the  cost  of  investment  projects,  better  coordination  between  FD  and  P&DD  in  the \npublication of the MTBF and MTDF, and the capacity to fully integrate the MTBF and the annual \nbudget.  \n  \n54. \nQuality and timeliness of the MTDF and MTBF are essential to improved planning and \nbudgeting.  Closer  integration  between  the  two  will  lead  to  better  prioritization  of  expenditures, \nwith  emphasis  on  productive  development  spending.  While  the  MTDF  for  FY2008\u20132010  has \nbeen published, MTBF forecasts are 2 years overdue. As part of SP1, the FD has finalized the \nfiscal forecasts and publish the MTBF for the period FY2008\u20132010. The new MTBF will provide \nmore  transparency  and  predictability  in  the  interdepartmental  allocation  of  resources.  To \nimprove the coordination of the MTBF and MTDF processes, the existing MTBF cell within the \nFD  and  the  MTDF  cell  within  the  P&DD  will  be  strengthened  and  joint  protocols  will  be \ndeveloped. This will result in clearer expenditure ceilings across line departments, and greater \nsustainability  of  development  projects  through  the  allocation  of  resources  for  recurrent \nmaintenance needs. Under SP2, timely annual updating of the MTBF is supported to ensure a \nmore  reliable  and  realistic  assessment  of  the  resources  available  over  the  medium  term. \nDepending on the progress of the first two SPs, a unified MTEF consolidating the planning and \nbudgeting dimensions could be adopted under SP3.  \n \n55. \nFor the MTBF/MTDF to be a meaningful tool for the effective allocation of resources, it \nhas  to  be  fully  integrated  with  the  annual  budget  process.  For  this  purpose,  under  SP1,  a \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\nrevised  annual  budget  statement  format  has  been  introduced,  providing  for  an  organizational \nand economic classification of expenditures along with a functional classification in the interest \nof increased transparency in the allocation of resources. \n \nThe  budget  call  circular  (BCC)  is  a  key  document,  as  it  is  circulated  by  the  FD  to  line \n56. \ndepartments at the start of the budget cycle for the submission of their expenditure estimates. In \nits current format, the BCC is not suited to the integration of the annual budget with the MTBF. \nUnder SP2, the format of BCC will be revised and made more conducive to the full integration of \nthe annual budget and the MTBF, including the notification of recurrent budget ceilings to line \ndepartments16 and the improvement of coordination between the FD and the P&DD.  \n \n57. \nInfusing  greater  fiscal  discipline  into  public  expenditure  management  is  another \nimportant  objective  of  reform  under  this  component.  To  this  end,  a  policy  and  regulatory \nframework for fiscal responsibility will be developed under SP2 to promote principles of prudent \nfiscal and financial management in both central and line departments. A review of the existing \nmechanism of excess and surrenders will also be made under SP2 for the purpose of improving \nbudget execution. \n  \n58. \nEffective auditing is critical in ensuring accountability in the use of public resources. The \nintroduction  of  performance-based  budgeting  (PBB)  has  increased  the  need  to  carry  out \nperformance  auditing  in  addition  to  the  traditional  financial  auditing.  Under  SP3,  the  GoPb  is \nurged to adopt strict guidelines for the obligation of line departments to disclose audited budget \nstatements and precise timelines for responding to comments raised by the auditor. When the \nPBB  is  fully  on  track,  at  least  in  the  pilot  entities,  a  performance  auditing  system  should  be \nintroduced  to  enable  the  government  to  assess  the  capacity  of  line  departments  to  effectively \nmeet their performance targets through budget expenditures.  \n \n59. \nTo  support  bottom-up  planning  within  the  context  of  devolution,  and  to  integrate \nprovincial policy priorities into local governments planning, SP1 also supports the notification of \nthe  Local  Government  Planning  Manual  so  that  it  can  serve  as  a  planning  tool  for  local \ngovernments.  Local  government  compliance  with  rules  and  procedures  set  in  the  manual  will \npave the way for local government involvement in the MTEF effort during SP2 and SP3.        \n \n60. \nFinally, the Program also seeks improved mobilization of tax revenues at both provincial \nand  local  government  levels.  It  is  aimed  at  consolidating  reform  efforts  already  undertaken \nduring the PRMP in three main areas of tax policy and tax administration, namely: (i) developing \na  provincial  database  of  stamp  duty  collection  to  improve  revenue  yields;  (ii)  supporting  the \nimplementation  of  the  provincial  agriculture  income  tax  policy  to  improve  efficiency  in  the \nassessment and collection of the agriculture income tax; and (iii) improving tax administration by \nbringing all tax collection functions under a unified authority. The proposed revenue-augmenting \nmeasures  will  be  adopted  under  SP2  to  increase  the  fiscal  autonomy  of  the  provincial \ngovernment  by  generating  additional  revenues.  The  Program  is  also  aimed  at  improving  local \ngovernment  capacity  for  revenue  administration  through  better  coordination  with  the  provincial \ngovernment in tax policy formulation and administration.  \n \n\n                                                 \n16  At  the  start  of  the  budget  cycle,  PDD  will  have  communicated  to  the  line  departments  the  amount  of  resources \n\navailable to each of them for the Annual Development Program.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15\n\nb. \n\nPerformance-Oriented Annual Budgeting \n\n61. \nThe  introduction  of  performance  orientation  in  the  budget  process  is  an  important  step \ntoward improving the quality of service delivery and implementing a full-fledged MTEF. This step \nrequires a clear definition of service delivery standards, identification of performance indicators \nagainst the standards, and assessment of the costs related to the provision of services. Against \nthis backdrop, steps towards PBB has been launched in a small number of pilot departments in \nSP1,  and  will  be  rolled  out  to  more  departments  in  SP2  and  SP3.  The  Department  of  Health  \n(DOH) and the Department of Irrigation and Power (DI&P) will be the pilot departments. Under \nSP1,  an  SPU  has  been  strengthened  within  DOH.  It  will  be  responsible  for  defining  sector \npolicies and strategies, and for estimating the resources needed to implement these strategies. \nDI&P has established a new MTEF committee to harmonize the strategic spending priorities of \nthe department and coordinate with the central MTBF/MTDF cells in MTBF/MTDF preparation. \nMore line departments will set up SPUs under SP2. \n \n62. \nA necessary condition for the effective introduction of PBB is that pilot entities undertake \na strategic review of their medium-term investment portfolio and recurrent expenditure pattern. \nSP2 will support a departmental expenditure review in both DOH and DI&P to assess whether \nthe  existing  allocation  of  resources  is  in  line  with  the  medium-term  strategic  goals  of  the \ndepartments,  and  to  identify  the  scope  for  rationalizing  resource  allocation.  The  ultimate \npurpose  of  the  expenditure  review  is  to  make  resource  allocations  more  consistent  with  the \ndesired service delivery standards, and hence more efficient in the achievement of the MDGs, \nespecially those related to education and health.   \n \nTo  obtain  public  feedback  on  the  quality  of  public  services  and  enable  a  closer  match \n63. \nbetween  the  quality  and  level  of  service  delivery  and  citizens\u2019  needs,  a  citizen  satisfaction \nsurvey will be designed and carried out under SP2. The first round will be conducted in selected \ndistrict  governments,  such  as  those  where  the  minimum  service  delivery  standards  for  health-\ncare services will be pilot-tested under the PDSSP.  \n \n\n2. \n\nOutput of Core Policy Area 2: Civil Service Pension Reform \n\nThe PGEIP will support the development of a financially sustainable pension system that \n64. \nprovides  adequate  and  equitable  retirement  income  for  civil  servants.  The  establishment  of  a \nfunded  pension  system  will  create  fiscal  space  for  pro-poor  public  expenditures,  and  foster \nproductive  investment  and  financial  sector  development  over  the  longer  term  by  promoting \ncontractual savings and asset accumulation. In addition, Punjab\u2019s pension reforms could serve \nas a catalytic model for reforms at the federal level and in other provinces. \n \n\na. \n\nEstablishment of the Punjab Pension Fund and the General \nProvident Investment Fund \n\n65. \nThe  objective  of  this  component  is  to  reduce  the  growing  burden  of  pension  and  GPF \nliabilities  on  the  finances  of  the  GoPb,  and  to  create  fiscal  space  for  priority  development \nexpenditures.  To  this  end,  the  Program  will  support  the  establishment  of  professionally \nmanaged  funds  to  meet  pension  obligations.  With  adequate  capitalization  and  a  prudent \ninvestment  strategy,  it  is  expected  that  the  PPF  and  the  GPIF  will  generate  sufficient  returns \nover time to finance the pension and GPF obligations.   \n \n66. \nThe PPF Act passed by the provincial assembly in March 2007 requires that the PPF be \nmanaged  by  a  management  committee  comprising  six  ex-officio  members,  four  private  sector \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\nrepresentatives,  and  a  general  manager.  Under  SP1,  the  GoPb  has  established  the \nmanagement  committee,  and  developed  and  adopted  the  PPF  implementing  rules  covering \nfiduciary arrangements, exposure limits and risk management, accounting and auditing, internal \ncontrols, and compliance.  \n \n67. \nTo  date,  the  government  has  earmarked  PRs8  billion  for  the  capitalization  of  the  PPF \nand  PRs4  billion  for  GPIF.  Under  SP1,  it  has  undertaken  an  actuarial  valuation  of  pension \nliabilities, prepared a funding strategy for capitalizing the PPF and the GPIF. The strategy takes \ninto account the magnitude of pension liabilities, possible sources of funds (including provincial \nrevenues, donor funds, and privatization proceeds), and the province\u2019s development needs. To \nminimize  operational  costs,  avoid  duplicating  efforts,  share  professional  expertise,  and  take \nadvantage of economies of scale, it is envisaged that the management committee for the PPF \nwill also manage the GPIF. \n \n68. \nThe  GoPb  will  set  up  the  GPIF  and  its  investment  operations  in  2008.  Building  on  the \nrules  developed  under  SP1,  the  government  will  establish  fiduciary  arrangements  and  risk \nmanagement  systems  and  procedures  for  the  PPF  and  the  GPIF.  Key  actions  in  this  regard \ninclude: (i) selecting investment managers and investment advisers; (ii) appointing a compliance \nofficer  and  an  external  auditor;  (iii)  establishing  audit,  accounting,  and  risk  controls;  and  (iv) \nestablishing compliance, reporting, and disclosure systems. \n\n \n\nb. \n\nImproved Pension and General Provident Fund Record-Keeping and \nPayment Systems and Procedures  \n\nThe  purpose  of  this  subcomponent  is  to  ensure  the  accurate  and  timely  payment  of \n69. \nbenefits  to  pensioners.  A  reliable  record-keeping  system,  including  information  technology- \nmanagement information system (IT-MIS) that enables the flow of data and information among \nthe  FD,  the  Office  of  the  AGP,  and  payment  agents,  is  a  prerequisite  for  a  credible  pension \nsystem.  Effective  mechanisms  for  verifying  claims  to  minimize  inaccurate  and  fraudulent \ntransactions need to be put in place to reduce leakages in the system. The institutional capacity \nof the Office of the AGP to ensure system soundness must also be strengthened. \n \n As  the  first  step  toward  improving  pension  administration,  the  GoPb  has  prepared  a \n70. \npolicy  note  identifying  the  key  weaknesses  in  the  existing  system.  It  has  also  appointed  a \nPension Administration Taskforce (PAT) comprising representatives from the FD and the Office \nof  the  AGP.  PAT  will  conduct  an  in-depth  assessment  of  the  administrative  arrangements, \nincluding the functioning of payment agents, to reduce fraud and errors, as well as streamline \nthe procedures for pension disbursement. On the basis of the assessment, PAT will recommend \nmeasures  to  improve  record-keeping  and  overall  system  administration,  leading  to  swift \nprocessing of pension payments with minimal errors. SP2 and SP3 of PGEIP will also support \nthe  implementation  of  PAT\u2019s  recommendations,  including  the  establishment  of  the  IT-MIS  and \ncapacity-building measures. \n \n\nc. \n\nImproved Pension System     \n\nThe  objective  of  this  component  is  to  introduce  parametric  and  systemic17 reforms  to \n71. \nenhance  pension  benefits  and  coverage  while  ensuring  the  financial  sustainability  of  the \n\n                                                 \n17 Parametric  reforms  involve  modifications  in  various  parameters  such  as  retirement  age,  contribution  rate,  among \nothers,  within  the  existing  system,  whereas  systemic  reforms  involve  more  fundamental  reforms  in  the  overall \ndesign of the pension system. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17\n\npension system. The current pension system was developed in the 1960s and 1970s, and, while \nsome revisions have been made more recently, there is a need for a comprehensive review to \nassess its continued relevance in the current socioeconomic landscape. Under SP2, the GoPb \nwill  evaluate  the  overall  retirement  saving  scheme,  covering  the  retirement  age,  length  of \nservice, indexation, commutation rate, the level of pension benefits, and GPF contribution rate \nand the annual interest on GPF balances. On the basis of the review of contractual policy to be \nsupported  under  Core  Policy  Area  3:  Civil  Service  Reforms,  specific  measures  for  providing \nretirement  saving  options  for  contractual  civil  servants  will  be  developed.  Taking  international \nexperience and relevant case studies into account, the GoPb will also explore the prospects for \nintroducing  a  multi-pillar  pension  system  comprising  a  minimum  government-guaranteed \ndefined  benefit  pillar  and  mandated  and  voluntary  defined  contribution  pillars.  The  legal  and \nregulatory framework for the parametric and systemic reforms will be developed under SP3. \n\n \n3. \n\nOutput of Core Policy Area 3: Civil Service Reforms \n\n72.  With 40 departments, 35 districts, and hundreds of municipal administrations, and, most \nimportantly, one million civil servants in its employ and a client base of over 80 million people, \nthe  civil  service  machinery  of  the  GoPb  must  be  well  structured  and  have  efficient  business \nprocesses. The objectives of this CPA are to support the government\u2019s efforts in making the civil \nservice more efficient, effective, and responsive by improving the human resource management \nsystem, policies, rules, procedures, and practices. The improvements will in turn (i) enhance the \ncapacity of the government to perform its functions; (ii) make the government a better employer, \nbetter  able  to  attract  and  retain  competent  staff;  (iii)  lift  the  morale  of  civil  servants;  and  (iv) \nultimately lead to improved public services for the benefit of the people in the Punjab.     \n \n\na. \n\nAn Institutional Foundation for Civil Service Reform \n\nthe \n\nin  SP1  address \n\ninstitutional  arrangements.  Three  actions \n\n73. \nCivil  service  reform  (CSR),  by  virtue  of  its  complexity,  requires  strong  leadership,  and \ninstitutional \nsupportive \nrequirements  at  different  levels.  First,  the  GoPb  has  established  a  high-powered  task  force  to \nlead,  guide,  and  oversee  reforms.  The  Civil  Service  Modernization  and  Reform  Task  Force \n(CSMRTF) will be chaired by the Chief Secretary. To balance effectiveness against the need for \nwide  participation,  CSMRTF  will  have  about  11 members,  including  representatives  from  civil \nsociety. CSMRTF will produce a document clearly expressing its vision for civil service reforms \nin the coming years.  \n  \nSecond,  to  steer  the  reforms,  the  GoPb  has  significantly  strengthened  its  Change \n74. \nManagement Unit (CMU) by increasing its resources and mandate\u2014it is now the Public Policy \nand  Change  Management  Wing  (PPCMW)  of  the  Service  and  General  Administration \nDepartment (S&GAD). A senior civil servant is full-time head of the PPCMW, which serves as \nCSMRTF secretariat and provides technical and operational support to the CSMRTF. PPCMW \nis the second tier of the institutional foundation for CSR.  \n \n75. \nThird,  the  GoPb  has  appointed  change  management  agents  in  all  40 provincial \ndepartments and 35 districts to coordinate the CSR and capacity-building activities. This move \nstrengthens the linkage between the CSMRTF, the PPCMW, and the departments and districts. \nThe change management agents constitute the third tier of the CSR institutional foundation.  \n \n\n \n\n\fb. \n\nImproved Human Resource Management System for Civil Servants  \n\n76. \nServing over 80 million people effectively calls for sound human resource management \n(HRM) systems and policies in the civil service. While the GoPb has pioneered some innovative \nmeasures  like  the  contractual  employment  system  and  the  strengthening  of  its  provincial  civil \nservice  cadre,  its  policies  and  rules  need  updating.  The  government  has  therefore  begun  a \nreview  of  key  civil  service  human  resource  management  policies,  including  the  Punjab  Civil \nService  Act  (1974),  the  Punjab  Contract  Appointment  Policy  (2004),  and  the  Provincial \nManagement Service Rules (2003). The Punjab Civil Service Act (1974) has been in place for \nover three decades now and urgently needs review and updating. The government introduced \nthe contractual employment system in 2004, to deal with endemic absenteeism among regular \nstaff,  especially  in  the  education  and  health  departments;  disincentives  to  good  performance, \nowing to security of tenure; problems relating to automatic promotions based on seniority; and \nthe complicated nature and ineffectiveness of the existing disciplinary rules and mechanisms for \nholding  regular  government  employees  accountable.  However,  there  are  concerns  about  the \nsustainability  of  the  contract  employment  system,  which  call  for  a  review  of  the  system  to \nsustain  the  gains  made  thus  far.  A  key  issue  relates  to  pension  provision  for  contract \nemployment.  \n \n77. \nThe  government  has  recruited  the  first  batch  of  civil  servants  under  the  enhanced \nProvincial  Management  Service  (PMS),  which  combines  two  parallel  provincial  civil  service \nstreams. The PMS is a critical part of the civil service system, as the bulk of the positions are \nmiddle-management  district  officer  positions,  directly  in  charge  of  service  delivery  at  local \ngovernment levels. While it has taken the good step of setting up the PMS, the GoPb needs to \nensure the career management of the PMS staff vis-\u00e0-vis those civil servants that are appointed \nby  the  federal  Government.  Without  an  HRM  system  that  rewards  performance  and  exacts \nadequate accountability, the PMS runs the risk of suffering from established systemic problems. \nThe PGEIP will provide continuous support in getting the incentives right for the PMS.  \n \n78. \nRapid change will not be desirable in a civil service one million strong. Hence, the GoPb \nwill  pilot-test  changes  in  the  HRM  system  in  eight  departments,  before  moving  toward  greater \nperformance  orientation.  The  pilot  will  be  aimed  at  promoting  transparent  and  merit-based \nrecruitment  and  promotion  systems,  performance-oriented  compensation,  and  greater \naccountability  of  civil  servants.  A  Punjab  Civil  Servant  Human  Resource  Management  Manual \nwill  be  developed  under  SP2,  and  related  training  will  be  carried  out  for  both  provincial \ndepartments and local governments.  \n \n79. \nGiven the problems faced by the PPSC (para. 27), the government intends to strengthen \nits  structure  and  functioning,  as  an  improved  PPSC  is  essential  for  increasing  flexibility  and \nefficiency, as well as safeguarding the integrity of civil service recruitment. \n \n\nc. \n\nImproved Government Functions and Streamlined Business \nProcesses \n\nThe government is committed to taking two key steps to improve the functioning of the \n80. \ncivil service. First, it will appoint about 10 senior civil servants to principal secretary positions, to \nhelp  coordinate  service  delivery.  All  heads  of  provincial  and  district  departments  and \ncorporatized agencies now report to the chief secretary in all policy and administrative matters. \nThe government recognizes that such a system is unsustainable. The principal secretaries will \nact  as  the  middle  layer  and  ensure  smoother  interdepartmental  and  province-district \ncoordination. Second, before initiating any system-wide restructuring, the government identified \n\n18 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19\n\na few key departments that will undergo a full-fledged functional review and a reengineering of \ntheir business processes. The PGEIP will support progress on both fronts and deepen reforms.  \n \n\nd. \n\nStrengthened Capacity of Civil Servants \n\n81. \nTo improve its in-house training capacity, the GoPb is collaborating with the Singapore \nCivil  Service  College  to  modernize  its  MPDD.  As  part  of  this  effort,  the  MPDD  has  been \nupgraded  to  the  principal  training  and  capacity-building  arm  of  the  Punjab  civil  service.  The \nMPDD  has  developed  a  training  framework  to  guide  capacity-building  activities  for  the  civil \nservice in the province. The PGEIP and the associated TA loan will support a range of initiatives \nunder this subcomponent. \n \n\n4. \n\nOutput of Core Policy Area 4: Private Sector Development \n\na. \n\nDynamic Private Sector\u2013Led Growth \n\nThe private sector reform initiatives under PRMP were largely stand-alone interventions \n82. \nwith a limited strategic view of how best to foster private sector\u2013led growth. Under the PGEIP, \nthe development of a well-defined private sector development strategy will form a major building \nblock  for  SP1  and  SP2.  The  GoPb  will  consult  closely  with  the  private  sector,  and  develop  a \nstrategy  with  a  clear  road  map  for  the  role  of  the  public  sector  in  fostering  private  sector\u2013led \ngrowth.  This  will  be  achieved  under  the  direction  of  a  private  sector  development  (PSD) \ncommittee, which will coordinate policy initiatives and streamline government policy across the \nrelevant departments.  \n \n83. \nIn parallel, the government will also take specific measures to promote PSD. First, it has \nput in place an effective strategy for communicating to enterprises in the provinces the need to \ncomply with core labor and international quality and environmental standards. It will also review \nthe current norms in place in the Punjab and take measures to close the gap between provincial \nand  international  requirements.  Second,  the  government  will  institute  a  regular  survey  on  the \ncost  of  doing  business  in  the  Punjab.  The  survey  will  (i)  set  benchmarks  for  performance, \n(ii) allow  tracking  of  costs  and  of  progress  made,  and  (iii)  allow  regular  and  continuous \nassessment  of  relevant  issues.  It  will  identify  the  key  problem  areas  and  allow  the  GoPb  to \naddress the legal and institutional reforms needed to bring down the cost of doing business. The \ngovernment  will  also  institutionalize  a  regulatory  impact  assessment  mechanism  in  relevant \ndepartments. \n \n\nb. \n\nPublic-Private Partnerships \n\n84. \nFor  PPP  arrangements  to  be  effective,  there  needs  to  be  a  comprehensive  legal  and \nregulatory  framework  and  mechanisms.  To  initiate  this  process  and  to  coordinate  overall  PPP \nimplementation, the government has created a PPP cell in the P&DD with clear tasks, given the \ncomplexity,  lack  of  understanding,  and  multiple  actors  involved.  The  government  will  also \nprepare a risk management framework and establish funding mechanisms to provide resources \nthat will reduce the viability gap in projects. The government is expected to identify a number of \nPPP opportunities and to implement the regulatory framework adopted throughout the PGEIP. \n  \n\n \n\n\fc. \n\nSummary of Achievements under Subprogram 1 of the Punjab \nGovernment Efficiency Improvement Program \n\nBox 1 is a summary of the key achievements of the GoPb as part of the policy dialogue \n\n85. \nunder SP1 of the proposed PGEIP cluster.  \n \n\nBox 1: Achievements of the Punjab Government in Public Sector Reforms \n\n \nCommitment and consultation. The government of the Punjab has: \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\nSet out a clear vision to transform Punjab into a modern and affluent society; \nEngaged international development partners to imbibe best practices for reforms; and \nUndertaken  extensive  stakeholder  consultations  in  designing  the  proposed  integrated  framework  for  the \nthree proposed program clusters, to accelerate reforms relating to: (i) public financial management, (ii) the \npension system, (iii) the civil service, (iv) the attainment of the MDGs, and (v) the judicial sector. \n\nProgress under the PGEIP. The government\u2019s reform efforts have gone much beyond the policy requirements of the \npast  and  ongoing  development  agency  programs.  Some  recent  achievements,  particularly  over  late  2006\u2013\nAugust 2007, in the context of policy dialogue under the PGEIP, are outlined below.  \n \nI.            Strengthening of Public Financial Management \n\nArticulating  medium-term  priorities  and  adopting  a  3-year  rolling  budget  framework.  The \ngovernment has released the MTBF for FY2008\u20132010, which supplements the rolling MTDF. Both \nhave enhanced fiscal discipline and made budgeting and planning more predictable.  \nStrengthening policy functions in key departments \nMaking  budget  formulation  more  participatory.  The  government  has  mandated  adherence  to \nthe Local Government Planning Manual,  which stipulates civil society consultations. This in turn will \nreduce elite capture and make local government budgeting more participatory.  \nInfusing  performance  orientation  into  budgeting  by  specifying  outcome  targets  for  key \nsectors that are anchored in accelerated MDG attainment  \n\n    \n\nII. \n\nReforms in the Civil Service Pension System \n\u2022 \n\nAccelerating  the  establishment  of  a  funded  system. The government envisions an increase in \nfunding  to  PRs100  billion  ($1.7  billion)  by  FY2015\u20132016  to  capitalize  the  budget,  thus  releasing \npublic  resources  for  critical  social  priorities.  This  vision  is  the  key  driving  factor  in  seeking  policy \nreform and substantial financing support from ADB of about $1.5 billion over a 5-year period. \nEnhancing  fiduciary  governance.  The  government  has  established  a  sound  management \nstructure  and  adopted  rules  for  managing  the  funds.  The  emerging  architecture  will  boost  civil \nservants\u2019 morale and public confidence, and strengthen financial markets. \n\n \n III. \n\nCivil Service Reforms \n\u2022 \n\nDemonstrating  strong  desire  for  reforms  and  adopting  a  civil  service  reform  vision.  The \ngovernment\u2019s  clearly  stated  objective  is  to  make  the  Punjab  civil  service  effective,  efficient,  and \nresponsive.  \nStrengthening  change  management  institutions.  The  PPCMW  is  fully  operational.  Change \nmanagement  agents  are  being  appointed  in  all  provincial  departments  and  districts.  Further,  the \ngovernment is modernizing the MPDD, its training and capacity-building arm, in collaboration with \nthe  Singapore  Civil  Service  College.  These  steps  will  significantly  strengthen  the  institutional \narchitecture for civil service reforms. \nImproving  inter-  and  intra-departmental  and  sectoral  coordination. The government is taking \nsteps to appoint around 10 senior officials to principal secretary positions to improve coordination \namong  the  40  government  departments  in  the  Punjab.  This  step  will  reduce  overlap,  duplication, \nand  inconsistency.  Some  key  departments  are  also  initiating  functional  reviews  to  improve \noperations and service delivery.  \nIdentifying performance-based human resource management positions, units, and sections. \nThese  will  become  models  for  merit-based  human  resource  management,  and  pave  the  way  for \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21\n\n \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nwide-ranging HR reforms. \nImproving  government  function  and  re-engineering  business  processes. The government is \npreparing for a functional review and business process reengineering in key departments.  \n\nIV. \n\n \nPrivate Sector Development \n\u2022 \n\nDefining  the  optimal  role  of  the  government  vis-\u00e0-vis  the  private  sector.  Building  on  PRMP \nprogress,  the  government  is  developing  a  private  sector  development  strategy  and  has  formed  a \nPSD committee. \nReducing compliance costs. The government is taking measures to require businesses to adhere \nto international standards for labor, environment, and quality. \nFostering  PPPs.  A  PPP  cell  is  being  established  to  develop  a  legal/institutional  framework  for \nPPP,  coordinate  the  identification  of  PPP  opportunities,  and  address  risk  sharing  between  the \npublic and private sectors. \n\n \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  FY  =  fiscal  year,  HR  =  human  resource,  MDG  =  millennium  development  goal, \nMPDD = Management and Professional Development Department, MTBF = medium-term budget framework, MTDF \n= medium-term development framework, PGEIP = Punjab Government Efficiency Improvement Program, PPCMW = \nPublic  Policy  and  Change  Management  Wing,  PRMP  =  Punjab  Resource  Management  Program,  PPP  =  public-\nprivate partnership, PSD = private sector development. \n \nC. \n\nImportant Features \n\nClose Alignment with the Reform Agenda of Government. The PGEIP is fully aligned \n86. \nwith the GoPb\u2019s long-term development vision and second-generation reforms, and makes use \nof the synergy between long-term goals, medium-term milestones, and short-term actions. It has \nbeen  developed  through  widespread  consultation  and  consensus  building,  thus  laying  a  solid \nfoundation for its successful implementation.  \n \n87. \nFlexible  Policy  Triggers  with  a  Concrete  and  Evolving  Action  Plan.  The  PGEIP \nadopts a flexible approach by defining indicative triggers, while supporting a detailed action plan \nto  aid  implementation,  monitor  output,  and  sustain  the  momentum  of  reform.  The  action  plan \nclearly  sets  out  the  role  and  responsibilities  of  each  IA,  and  spells  out  the  expected  steps \nrequired from the start of the Program. The action plan for each SP is a living document that can \nbe  adjusted  to  best  suit  the  requirements  of  reforms.  This  two-pronged  approach  effectively \naddresses the flexibility and accountability requirements.  \n   \n88. \nSingle-Tranche  Modality.  The  move  to  adopt  single-tranche  operations  reflects  the \nlessons learned from the policy-lending experience of ADB and the World Bank. This modality \nenables the adjustment of short-term actions to achieve medium-term outcomes and long-term \ngoals.  This  linkage  between  short-term  actions,  medium-term  outcomes,  and  long-term  goals \nputs  short-term  actions  on  a  sound  footing.  On  the  other  hand,  the  identification  of  short-term \nactions  makes  reforms  \u201cimplementable\u201d  and  helps  reduce  information  requirements  and \nuncertainty.  The  emphasis  on  completing  reform  actions  before  processing  the  next  SP  also \nputs in place strong accountability for both the government and the development agencies. This \napproach also effectively integrates program processing with program implementation, such that \nreforms  take  place  through  continuous  policy  dialogue.  This  contrasts  with  the  traditional \nmulti-tranche  approach,  which  compartmentalizes  the  processing  and  implementation  of \nprograms, leaving little room for improvement during program implementation. \n \n89. \nInstitutional Development. While the PGEIP emphasizes the achievement of outcomes, \nit also recognizes that outputs and outcomes in the public sector cannot always be measured. It \nthus  pays  special  attention  to  putting  in  place  procedures,  processes,  and  systems  to  ensure \n\n \n\n\feffective output and outcome. It also strengthens institutional coordination between departments \nsuch as FD and P&DD, as well as between the EA and IAs.  \n \n90. \nCombination  of  Diagnostic  Studies,  Policy  Changes,  and  Pilot-Testing.  The \nProgram  adopts  a  programmatic  approach,  which  combines  measures  based  on \ncomprehensive  analysis  with  an \nimplementation. \nPilot-testing,  rather  than  across-the-board  actions,  is  proposed,  to  bring  about  sustainable \nchange.  \n \nD. \n\n\u201copportunistic\u201d  approach \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nto  change \n\n91. \nLoan  Size,  Terms,  and  Conditions.  The  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of \n$250 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to finance SP1 of the PGEIP, with interest to \nbe determined according to ADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)\u2013based lending facility; \na 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; and other terms and conditions substantially \nin accordance with those set forth in the draft program loan agreement presented to the Board. \nThe Government has decided on its own to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, \nand it has made an undertaking to the effect that this choice was not made on the basis of any \nadvice from ADB. Interest rate and currency conversion options may be exercised according to \nthe terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement, the loan regulations, and ADB\u2019s \nconversion guidelines. \n \n92. \nThe following factors have been taken into account in determining the loan size: (i) the \nstrength  of  the  Program  and  its  development  impact,  (ii)  the  financial  and  political  cost \nassociated with the implementation of the Program, and (iii) the overall development financing \nneeds estimated by the FD of the GoPb. \n \n93. \nThe  principal  driver  in  the  government\u2019s  decision  to  seek  ADB\u2019s  policy  reform  and \nfinancing  support  is  to  accelerate  the  funding  of  the  civil  service  pension  system.  The \ngovernment looks forward to funding the pension system, and for this it will require a massive \ninfusion of at least PRs100 billion ($1.7 billion) by FY2015\u20132016. It plans to invest these funds \nin a prudent manner to meet the annual pension outlays. Against this need, the government has \nsought about $300 million in program lending disbursements every year over FY2007\u20132011.  \n \n94. \nEffective public resource management is a key contributor to economic efficiency, broad-\nbased economic growth, employment creation, poverty reduction, and social progress. Reforms \nin  all  the  four  core  policy  areas  of  the  PGEIP  are  essential  for  providing  good  governance, \ncreating  fiscal  space,  reducing  waste,  improving  value  for  money  in  public  finance,  and \nimproving  public  service  delivery.  Reforms  under  the  PGEIP  are  crucial  in  sustaining \ndevelopment in the Punjab, and the opportunity cost of not undertaking reforms will be very high. \nThe  financial  and  economic  costs  associated  with  the  reforms  are  expected  to  be  substantial, \ngiven  the  scope  of  the  reforms.  Political  costs  are  considerable,  as  initiatives  such  as  civil \nservice  reforms  will  significantly  shake  up  the  vested  interests  that  benefit  from  weak \ngovernance.  Direct  adjustment  costs  include  the  following:  (i)  capitalization  of  PPF  and  GPIF, \n(ii) implementation costs to improve public financial management systems, (iii) increased wage \ncosts as civil service reforms bring compensation more in line with the market rate, (iv) costs to \nleverage reforms that may face resistance through consensus building, and (v) reduced revenue \nto the government due to lower compliance costs. While there are costs associated with reforms \nin the short run, the eventual economic benefits will greatly outweigh the costs in the long run. \n  \n\n22 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n23\n\nOver  the  medium  term,  sustained  growth  in  the  Punjab  and  pro-poor  spending  put \n95. \nimmense pressure on financial resource mobilization. The government\u2019s financing needs will be \nsignificant if it is to sustain its target of 7% economic growth, create over one million new jobs \neach year, and raise spending in the social sectors. The MTBF and MTDF show that the budget \ndeficit  will  reach  PRs37.3  billion  (about  $622  million)  in  FY2008  and  further  to  PRs55.9  billion \n($932  million)  and  PRs42.8  billion  (about  $714  million)  in  FY2009  and  FY2010,  respectively \n(Table  1).  The  surplus  in  the  net  public  account  in  FY2008  somehow  relieves  the  financing \npressure,  but  the  overall  financing  requirement  from  FY2008  to  FY2010  remains  significant, \naveraging  around  $890  million  per  year.  Absorbing  the  proposed  disbursement  of  about  $300 \nmillion  yearly  will  not  impair  fiscal  sustainability.  The  World  Bank  estimates  show  that  the  net \npresent  of  value  of  provincial  public  debt  as  a  percentage  of  provincial  GDP  will  decline  from \n1.9% in FY2006 to 1% in FY2010.18   \n \n\nTable 1: Medium-Term Financing Requirement of the Punjab, FY2008\u20132010 \n(PRs million) \n\n  \nRevenues \nLess: Expenditures \n   Currenta \n   Development \n\nBudget Surplus/(Deficit) \n \nBudgetary Financing Requirement \nAdd:  Capital Expendituresb  \nless:  Net Public Account \n\n  FY2008 \n356,172  \n393,487  \n243,487  \n150,000  \n\n      (37,315) \n\n \n\n37,315  \n25,819  \n14,774  \n\n  FY2009 \n366,189 \n422,084  \n265,120  \n156,964  \n\n        (55,895) \n \n\n \n\n  FY2010 \n428,045 \n470,871 \n289,523 \n181,348  \n\n     (42,826) \n\n55,895  \n7,242  \n588  \n\n42,826 \n7,328  \n638  \n\n806  \n\n49,516 \n\n62,549  \n\n48,360  \n\nOverall Financing Gap \n   In $ Millionc \na Includes pension fund capitalization. \nb Consists of loan and equity payments, and debt principal repayments. \nc At PRs60 = $1. \nSources: Medium-Term Budget Framework, 2007\u20132010; ADB staff calculations. \n\n \n \n \n \n96. \nRelending  to  the  GoPb.  The  Government  of  Pakistan  will  relend  the  local  currency \ngenerated  from  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  to  the  GoPb.  The  terms  and  conditions  will  be  the \nsame  as  those  extended  by  ADB  to  the  Government  of  Pakistan.

The  high-level  steering \n97. \ncommittee  chaired  by  the  chief  secretary  and  comprising  as  members,  the  Planning  and \nDevelopment (P&D) chairman, additional chief secretary S&GAD, finance secretary, secretaries \nof IAs, and at least three representatives of civil society and the private sector, will guide PGEIP \nimplementation.  The  steering  committee  will  convene  at  least  twice  a  year  and  post  its  major \ndecisions  and  recommendations  on  the  PRMP  website.  Since  the  steering  committee  is  large \nand finds it difficult to meet more often, an executive committee under the P&D chairman, with \nmembers  from  the  FD  and  the  S&GAD  was  established  in  2006  to  ensure  efficient \nimplementation. The executive committee will meet at least once every 3 months. It will oversee \nprogram  implementation  and  approves  TA  plans.  To  increase  program  ownership  among  the \nIAs,  the  executive  committee  will  also  include  IAs  working  on  the  specific  reform  area. \nMembership  will  thus  change  according  to  the  specific  area  covered.  ADB  may  be  invited  to \nparticipate in the executive committee meetings as an observer. \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n98. \nA  PMU  has  been  in  place  since  2003  and  will  continue  to  be  the  secretariat  of  the \nsteering and executive committees. As the PMU also coordinates all other donor-assisted policy \nreform  programs,  including  the  DFID  TA  projects  in  the  Punjab,  it  is  well  placed  to  avoid  any \noverlap or duplication of efforts.  \n \n99. \nThe  major  implementation  agencies  are  the  FD,  P&DD,  MPDD,  S&GAD,  and  the \nDepartments  of  Health,  Irrigation  and  Power,  Labor  and  Human  Resource,  Commerce  and \nInvestment,  Industries,  as  well  as  other  relevant  departments  and  agencies.  All  implementing \nagencies under the Program have focal persons and a core team, which assists in implementing \nthe PRMP agenda.19  \n \n \n \n100.  The  implementation  period  for  the  PGEIP  subprogram  1  is  from  June  2006  to  October \n2007.  All  actions  included  in  the  policy  matrix  for  SP1  have  been  completed.  The  indicative \nimplementation  period  for  SP2  is  from  December  2007  to  May  2009,  and  for  SP3,  from \nJune 2009 to December 2010. Loan completion is expected by 31 December 2010 and the loan \nclosing date is 30 June 2011. \n \n101.  To  ensure  flexibility  and  still  guide  reform  actions,  a  detailed  action  plan  for  SP1  has \nbeen developed in consultation with the provincial government. The action plan will be a living \ndocument,  adjusted  through  close  coordination  between  ADB  and  the  GoPb  so  that  it  is  an \nevolving tool in assisting policy reforms. While reform measures are closely interlinked and not \ndiscrete, there is no overlap between the specific actions supported under the PGEIP and the \nrecently concluded PRMP. \n \n \n \n102.  The loan proceeds will be available for withdrawal in a single tranche in the amount of \n$250  million  for  SP1,  to  be  released  after  the  loan  becomes  effective.

Counterpart  Funds.  The  GoPb  will  ensure  that  the  local  currency  counterpart  funds \ngenerated by the loan will be used, first, to capitalize the Punjab Pension and General Provident \nFunds according to the government\u2019s strategy; second, to support the structural adjustment cost \nof  reforms  under  the  Program;  and,  third,  to  finance  expenditures  for  general  development \npurposes.  The  government  will  certify  the  use  of  counterpart  funds  in  line  with  the  loan \nagreement through audited statements acceptable to ADB.  \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement Arrangements  \n\n \n104.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs  (excluding \nlocal duties and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding the \nitems  specified  in  the  negative  list  of  ineligible  items  (and  imports20 financed  by  other  bilateral \nand  multilateral  sources).  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans,21 the proceeds of the \nprogram  loan  will  be  disbursed  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  as  the  Borrower.  No \nsupporting import documentation will be required if, during each year that the loan proceeds are \nexpected to be disbursed, the value of Pakistan\u2019s total imports minus imports from nonmember \ncountries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development assistance is \nequal to or greater than the amount of the loan expected to be disbursed during that year. The \nGovernment  of  Pakistan  will  certify  its  compliance  with  this  formula  with  each  withdrawal \nrequest.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing  procedures  will  be  required. \nDisbursements will be made under the simplified procedures for program loans.  \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption, Fiduciary Issues, Accounting, and Auditing \n\n \n ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \n105. \ndiscussed  with  the  Government  of  Pakistan.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProgram.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are \nincluded  in  the  applicable  loan  regulations  and  bidding  documents.  In  particular,  all  contracts \nfinanced  by  ADB  will  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the \nrecords and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  PGEIP.  All  relevant  ADB  guidelines,  including  the \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  the  applicable  loan  regulations,  were \nspecifically brought to the notice of the Government. \n   \n106.  ADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s  certification  for  withdrawal  applications.  Before  withdrawal,  the  Government  will \nopen a deposit account at the State Bank of Pakistan to receive all loan proceeds. The account \nwill  be  managed,  operated,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  terms  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The \n\n                                                 \n20 Eligible imports are total imports minus imports from nonmember countries, non-eligible imports specified in the list \nof ineligible items, and imports already financed by ADB or other international and bilateral development agencies. \nSee Appendix 8 for the list of ineligible items.  \n\n21  ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n\n \n\n\fP&DD  will  be  required  to  submit  quarterly  progress  reports,  as  well  as  a  final  report  on  the \nprogress of SP1 implementation.  \n \n107.  The  Government  of  Pakistan  emphasizes the  strengthening of  internal  control  systems \nand overall public financial management. Much progress has been made with support from the \nWorld  Bank  through  PIFRA.  While  that  project  covers  the  federal  Government  as  well  as  the \nfour provinces in Pakistan, the most significant improvement has been achieved in the Punjab in \nstrengthening financial reporting and auditing (for details see www.AGP.org.pk). \n \n108.  The policy actions under the PGEIP will also complement the anticorruption efforts of the \nGovernment  of  Pakistan.  For  instance,  the  policy  actions  under  CPA1  will  enhance \ntransparency and accountability in budget preparation and execution. Improvements in pension \nrecord-keeping  and  administration  will  minimize  the  scope  for  errors  as  well  as  fraudulent \nactivities in the accounting and disbursement of pension benefits. Business process review and \nreengineering  to  be  implemented  under  CPA3  will  also  enhance  transparency  and  minimize \nopportunities for corruption. Likewise, policy actions under CPA4 will promote the development \nof a transparent public-private partnership regime. \n \n\n6. \n\nPerformance Monitoring and Evaluation, Program Review, and Reporting \n\n \n The  GoPb  and  ADB  have  agreed  on  a  range  of  outcome  and  output  indicators  to \n109. \nmonitor the PGEIP implementation and evaluate its impact within the overall framework of the \nProgram (Appendix 1).  \n \n The  GoPb  and  ADB  will  periodically  review  progress  implementation  and  assess  the \n110. \nimpact of the PGEIP. The GoPb will keep ADB informed of the outcome of policy discussions \nwith  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies \nthe  PGEIP \nimplementation,  and  will  provide  ADB  with  the  opportunity  to  comment  on  any  resulting  policy \nproposals. A progress review will be conducted by the executive committee every quarter and a \nprogress report will be shared with ADB, with the first progress report due on 15 January 2008. \nThe summary of the progress report will be published on the PRMP website (http://www.punjab-\nprmp.gov.pk/). To assist the monitoring and evaluation of the PGEIP implementation, a detailed \naction  plan  has  been  developed  for  SP1  (Supplementary  Appendix  E).  Likewise,  for  SP2  and \nSP3, ADB will develop detailed action plans to serve as a guidance document to be revised and \nenhanced during review missions. The engagement of civil society will be pursued through the \nPDF.  This  annual  event  enables  the  GoPb  to  communicate  its  development  policies  and \npriorities to the public. PRMP-related information is widely disseminated to the public through a \ndedicated website. Regular workshops and meetings involving civil society will be organized by \nthe PMU to seek ideas on public development from the public and to disseminate information.  \n  \n\nimplications \n\nthat  have \n\nfor \n\nV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical Assistance Loan \n\n1. \n\nObjectives \n\n111.  The  objective  of  the  TA  loan  is  to  support  the  implementation  of  reforms  under  the \nPGEIP.  Specifically,  the  TA  will  support  policy  advice,  diagnostic  studies,  stakeholder \nconsultations,  and  capacity  building  to  achieve  (i)  greater  performance  orientation  in  planning \n\n26 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n27\n\nand budgeting, (ii) a financially stable and adequate pension system with improved benefits and \nwider coverage, (iii) an efficient and effective civil service, and (iv) a dynamic private sector.  \n \n\n2. \n\nMethodology and Activities \n\n112. \n In  line  with  the  scope  of  the  PGEIP,  the  TA  loan  has  five  components:  (i)  fiscal  and \nfinancial  management,  (ii)  pension  reform,  (iii)  civil  service  reform,  (iv)  private  sector \ndevelopment,  and  (v)  reform  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  TA  activities  are  divided  into \n(i) operational support, including equipment and related software; (ii) studies and assessments; \nand  (iii)  training  and  capacity  building.  Appendix  9  presents  the  full  details  of  the  TA  loan \ncomponents, and Supplementary Appendix F presents the terms of reference for the consulting \nservices. \n \n\n3. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n113.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $10 million \nequivalent (Table 2). ADB will provide financing of $8.8 million. In-kind contribution, equivalent \nto $1.2 million, from the GoPb will cover the counterpart staff, training and workshop facilities, \noffice accommodation, and transport. \n \n\nTable 2: Cost Estimates \n($\u2019000) \n\n       a.

The GoPb has requested a loan of $8.8 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to \nhelp finance the TA project. The loan will have a term of 32 years including a grace period of 8 \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\n \n\n \n\nyears, an interest rate of 1% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter, and \nother terms and conditions set forth in the TA loan and TA program agreements.  \n \n115.  The federal Government will make the loan proceeds available to the GoPb in domestic \ncurrency, at mutually agreed terms and conditions. The GoPb will assume the foreign exchange \nand interest rate risk. \n \n\n4. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nin \n\nto  meet \n\nthe  emerging  needs  of \n\nthe  provincial  government \n\n116. \n In parallel and in addition to the ADB TA loan, the Government of the United Kingdom \nwill  provide  a  grant  of  $3  million  to  the  Punjab  government  to  fund  activities  and  tasks  that \ncomplement the ADB TA loan, including diagnostic studies, analytic assessments, and capacity \nbuilding  in  the  areas  of  public  financial  management,  civil  service  reform,  and  private  sector \ndevelopment.  The  grant  funds  will  be  part  of  a  larger  pool  of  resources  that  will  be  used  in  a \nflexible  manner \nthe \nabovementioned areas, among others.22 The identification of specific tasks and activities to be \nfunded  under  the  TA  loan  will  become  clearer  as  the  reform  agenda  progresses,  and  specific \nactivities may change. In that case, ADB will work closely with the GoPb and the Government of \nthe United Kingdom to reallocate resources. \n \n117.  The proposed PGEIP has identified the need for capacity-building support to the DOH as \none of the pilot departments identified for the implementation of the MTEF.23 The health sector \nalso  represents  a  primary  area  of  intervention  for  the  PDSSP  and  its  attached  TA  grant. 24 \nTherefore, in view of the synergies between the PDSSP and the technical assistance needs of \nthe  DOH  identified  by  the  PGEIP,  ADB,  the  Government  of  the  United  Kingdom,  and  the \nprovincial government have agreed that the costs of the TA support to the DOH will be covered \nby TA 4504 (see footnote 24) funds up to a total amount of $1.64 million.25 \n \n118.  P&DD  will  be  the  EA  for  the  TA  loan,  and  various  IAs  will  be  responsible  for  their \nrespective components. The main IAs will be the FD, P&DD, DOH and DI&P for components 1; \nFD for Component 2; S&GAD and MPDD, for component 3; the Departments of Commerce and \nInvestment,  Industries,  and  Labor  and  Human  Resource,  for  component  4;  and  P&DD,  for \ncomponent 5. All implementing agencies under the PGEIP will have focal persons and a core \nteam, which will assist in implementing the PGEIP agenda. \n \n119.  The  TA \n30 November 2011 and closed by 31 May 2012. \n \n120.  The TA loan will support the hiring of consultants, including experts in public financial and \nresource management, social service delivery, pensions, civil service reforms, and private sector \ndevelopment, for a total of 140 person-months of international and 156 person-months of national \n                                                 \n22 To administer this pool of funds a technical assistance management agency will be established by the Government \n\nimplemented  over  4  years. \n\nIt  will  be  completed  by \n\nloan  will  be \n\nof the United Kingdom.  \n\n23 For a detailed description of the technical assistance support to the DOH, see Supplementary Appendix F. \n24 TA 4504 consists of a $20 million grant financed by the Government of the United Kingdom and administered by a \ntechnical  assistance  management  agency  hired  under  the  PDSSP.  (TA  4504  attached  to  Loans  2144  and  2145; \nADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Program Loans \nand  Technical  Assistance  Grant  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Punjab  Devolved  Social  Services \nProgram. Manila).   \n\n25 ADB, the Government of the United Kingdom, and the Punjab government have agreed that the PDSSP technical \nassistance  management  agency  should  administer  the  $1.64  million.  For  a  breakdown  of  the  related  costs,  see \nTable F3 in Supplementary Appendix F. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n29\n\nconsulting services. All consultants will be recruited according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time) and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB \nfor  the  hiring  of  consultants.  Where  firms  are  to  be  hired,  consultant  selection  may  use  any \nselection method under ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, preferably the quality- and \ncost-based selection method.  \n \n121.  The  TA  loan  will  also  support  the  hiring  of  resource  persons  to  assist  in  program \nimplementation. Appropriate guidelines on the use of resource persons, acceptable to ADB, will \nbe developed by the EA, and included in the project administration memorandum. \n \n122.  The procurement of goods and services will conform to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Supply contracts for equipment or materials estimated to \ncost  at  least  the  equivalent  of  $500,000  will  be  awarded  through  international  competitive \nbidding,  those  costing  less  than  the  equivalent  of  $500,000,  through  national  competitive \nbidding, and supply contracts valued at less than $100,000, through shopping. \n \n123.  The  IAs  concerned  will  finalize  the  terms  of  reference.  All  consultant  selection  and \nprocurement  will  be  done  through  the  PMU,  with  the  IA  concerned  being  represented  in  the \nConsultant Selection Committee (CSC). The CSC will be responsible for consultant shortlisting \nand contract negotiations. \n \n124.  For additional demand-driven support under the TA, IAs must submit for the approval of \nthe executive committee, with the concurrence of ADB, a proposal outlining the rationale, issues, \nthematic  coverage,  consulting  inputs  and  terms  of  reference,  procurement  requirements,  cost \nestimates, and implementation plan for the activity. The steering committee will be informed of all \nactivities  funded  from  the  unallocated  pool  of  funds.  All  consultant  recruitment  under  approved \nprojects will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. All procurement \nof goods and services under approved projects will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines.  The  procurement  plan  will  be  updated  to  include  consultant  recruitment  and \nprocurement under the approved activities. \n \n125.  All disbursement under the TA loan will conform to ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007, as amended from time to time). The P&DD will establish and maintain separate accounts \nfor the TA according to accounting procedures acceptable to ADB. An imprest account will be \nset up after the loan takes effect, and it will be managed, replenished, and liquidated according \nto  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  The  initial  amount  to  be  deposited  into  the  imprest \naccount  will  not  exceed  the  equivalent  of  $400,000  or  6  months\u2019  estimated  expenditures, \nwhichever is less. The accounts, together with a record of expenditures under the TA loan and \nthe use of the imprest account, will be audited annually by independent auditors in accordance \nwith auditing standards acceptable to ADB. Certified copies in English of the audited accounts \nand financial statements and the report of the auditors will be submitted to ADB within 9 months \nat the end of each fiscal year. \n \n126.  The GoPb, ADB, and DFID will periodically review TA implementation. The reviews will \ninclude  an  evaluation  of  the  TA  loan  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  progress  on  the \npolicy  reform  agenda,  and  capacity-building  measures.  Regular  ADB  and  DFID  joint  missions \nwill be fielded to assess progress and to provide further guidance on the TA project. \n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\n \n\nB. \n\nTechnical Assistance Grants \n\n127.  Advisory Technical Assistance (ADTA). With several stakeholders for each CPA, an \nadvisory TA grant is proposed to provide expert assistance to the EA and key IAs in program \ncoordination,  as  well  as  in  program  and  TA  loan  monitoring  and  evaluation.  Independent \nadvisory support to the provincial government in establishing sound fiduciary arrangements for \nthe pension system, and to the PPCMW in initiating and monitoring CSR measures, will also be \nprovided. The total cost of the TA grant is estimated at $1.2 million equivalent. ADB will finance \n$950,000  equivalent  on  a  grant  basis  from  its  TA  funding  program  to  cover  the  consulting \nservices  and  the  cost  of  training,  seminars,  and  workshops.  The  government\u2019s  in-kind \ncontribution will be $250,000 equivalent. Details of the TA grant are in Appendix 10. \n \n128.  Program  Preparatory  Technical  Assistance  (PPTA).  The  GoPb  has  also  requested \nADB  for  TA  to  support  the  preparation  of  the  PMDGP  and  PAJP  clusters.  The  TA  will  cover \ndiagnostic  assessments  of  the  constraints  impeding  social  service  delivery  in  the  Punjab,  and \npriority  policy,  regulatory,  and  institutional  actions  to  accelerate  the  attainment  of  the  MDGs, \nparticularly those related to health care. It will also help establish an effective interface between \nthe administrative and judicial institutions, and facilitate dialogue between the two sides, leading \nto  the  design  of  policy,  legal,  and  institutional  reforms  to  enhance  access  to  justice  in  the \nprovince. The total cost of the TA grant is estimated at $1.125 million equivalent, of which ADB \nhas been requested by the GoPb to finance $900,000 equivalent from its TA funding program. \nDetails of the PPTA grant are in Appendix 11. Appendix 12 presents a combined procurement \nplan for the TA loan and the two TA grants. \n \n129.  Advance  Contracting.  To  expedite  Program  implementation,  advance  contracting  will \nbe  undertaken  to  cover  the  engagement  of  consultants  under  the  ADTA  and  the  PPTA. \nAdvance action will include advertisements of consulting requirements for various components, \nand  short-listing  and  recruitments  of  individual  consultants.  GoPb  was  informed  that  ADB\u2019s \napproval  of  the  advance  action  is  subject  to  approval  of  the  proposed  loans  and  grants  and \ndoes not commit ADB to finance the Program, the TA loan or the related recruitment costs. \n \n\n \n\nVI. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACT, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nProgram Benefits \n\n130.  The PGEIP is expected to yield significant benefits to the people of Punjab, specifically \nthe following:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nMore  efficient  allocation  of  public  resources.  By  integrating  planning  and \nbudgeting  processes,  the  Program  will  ensure  greater  cohesion  between \ndevelopment  priorities  and  fiscal  policy  formulation.  The  adoption  of  the  MTEF \nwill  make  budgeting  more  transparent  and  predictable,  and  the  infusion  of \nperformance orientation will strengthen fiscal discipline and accountability in the \nuse of public resources. All these intermediate outcomes will result in improved \ndelivery of public services. \n\nGreater financial sustainability of the pension system. The Punjab has made \npioneering  efforts  in  this  direction.  Recognizing  the  significant  liabilities,  the \nprovincial government is committed to accelerating funding. The move will boost \ncivil  service  morale  by  ensuring  retirement  income  security,  ease  contingent \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n31\n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\nfor  pro-poor \nliability  management,  and  create  considerable \nexpenditures.  Longer-term  benefits  include  the  promotion  of  private  saving  and \nasset  accumulation,  which  will  in  turn  contribute  to  the  province\u2019s  economic \ngrowth, and to financial and private sector development. \n\nfiscal  space \n\nAn  efficient  and  effective  civil  service. \nresource \nmanagement  in  the  civil  service  will  increase  value  for  money  for  the  province. \nEfficient  institutional  structures,  faster  business  procedures,  and  improved  skills \nand  capacity  in  the  public  sector  will  result  in  efficiency  gains  and  improved \nproductivity in the public sector, with consequent benefits in service delivery and \nprivate sector development.  \n\nImproved  human \n\nA  dynamic  private  sector. A coherent private sector development strategy, an \nimproved  regulatory  framework,  reduced  government  participation in  the  private \nsector,  and greater  compliance  with  international  standards  will  facilitate  private \nsector  participation  and  result  in  greater  efficiency  and  higher  investment  and \ngrowth  rates.  Likewise,  a  robust  public-private  partnership  framework  will \nmobilize  resources  toward  more  and  better-quality  infrastructure  and  social \nservices. \n\n \n131.  All  the  benefits  will  contribute  to  employment  creation,  broad-based  economic  growth, \nsocial  development,  and  poverty  reduction.  These  are  important  building  blocks  toward \nachieving the long-term goals outlined in Vision 2020 of significantly raising the living standards \nin the Punjab.  \n \nB. \n\nProgram Impact \n\n132.  Economic and Poverty Impact. The Program is expected to create significant positive \neconomic  impact  in  the  medium  to  long  term.  Improved  public  financial  management  will \nimprove  efficiency,  increase  value  for  money  of  public  spending,  and  generate  resources  for \ninvestment  and  development  spending.  The  establishment  of  the  PPF  and  GPIF  will  directly \ncontribute  to  investment  and  economic  growth.  The  efficiency  gains  achieved  through  civil \nservice reforms and private sector development will further lead to productivity growth, and thus \nsustainable  economic  growth.  The  Program  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  through \neconomic  growth.  It  will  also  directly  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  through  resources \ngenerated for social and development spending, and through a more effective public sector that \nis geared toward service delivery outcomes. \n     \n133. \nInstitutional Impact. The PGEIP will contribute to institutional enhancement. Increased \ncoordination  between  planning  and  budgeting  will  promote  a  more  holistic  approach  to  public \nfinancial \nexpenditure  management,  with  significant  gains \nmanagement.  The  establishment  of  a  professionally  managed  PPF  and  GPF  will  represent  a \nkey milestone, and could potentially serve as a catalytic model for similar reforms at the federal \nlevel  and  in  other  provinces.  Civil  service  reforms  will  bring  across-the-board  institutional \ndevelopment  in  the  public  sector.  Efforts  to  promote  private  sector  development,  such  as  the \nestablishment  of  the  PPP  cell,  will  strengthen  the  interface  between  the  public  and  private \nsectors.  \n \n134.  Social  Impact.  The  beneficial social  impact  of  the  PGEIP  can  arise  from  the  following \nfactors.  First  of  all,  the  introduction  of  more  efficient  public  resource  management  practices \nthroughout  government  will  gradually  contribute  to  improvements  in  the  quality  of  service \n\nterms  of  output-oriented \n\nin \n\n \n\n\fdelivery, especially in key social sectors. Second, the improved pension system will strengthen \nthe  social  safety  net.  Lastly,  the  improved  quality  of  life  through  higher  economic  and  income \ngrowth will have an overall and direct impact on social outcomes. The detailed poverty reduction \nand social strategy of the Program is in Appendix 13. \n \n135.  Resettlement,  Indigenous  People,  and  the  Environment.  The  PGEIP  will  cause  no \ndirect  or  indirect  involuntary  resettlement,  and  will  not  lead  to  any  issues  affecting  indigenous \npeoples  (category  C).  The  PGEIP  is  also  unlikely  to  have  any  adverse  environmental  impact \n(category C). \n \nC. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n136.  The  realization  of  the  benefits  and  impact  of  the  PGEIP  depends  on  a  number  of \nassumptions  and  are  subject  to  a  variety  of  risks.  Mitigating  measures  have  accordingly  been \nintegrated into the design of the Program. \n \n137.  Political  Risks.  Pakistan  is  in  an  election  year  and  any  political  changes  could  have \nmajor administrative consequences. The caretaker setup expected to be in place later in 2007 \nmay not have the appetite for long-gestation reforms. However, the risk of reversing the broad \ndirections  of  reforms  is  low,  given  the  present  broad  consensus  on  reforms  among  the  major \npolitical  players.  The  flexibility  built  into  the  single-tranche  operations  is  also  well  suited  to \naddressing the uncertainty arising in this context, as specific reform actions can be adjusted to \nreflect changes in the political environment.  \n \n138.  Governance  Risks. Reforms could be undermined or delayed by vested interests that \nare  threatened  by  greater  transparency  and  accountability.  However,  strong  ownership  and \nsupport  at  the  highest  political  and  bureaucratic  levels,  coupled  with  gradually  improving \nincentives for better performance, will help mitigate this risk. The PDF that began in 2003 has \ninstitutionalized broad-based stakeholder participation, and the PGEIP design has been defined \nthrough this participative process.  \n \n139. \nImplementation  Risks.  Insufficient  capacity  within  the  GoPb  to  handle  the  envisaged \nreforms could impede implementation. However, with the help of the TA loan under the PRMP, \nand by adopting effective procurement options and hiring the Singapore Civil Service College, \nthe  PMU  and  departments  have  been  able  to  overcome  capacity  limitations.  Enhancing  IA \nownership of the Program is also a key method of mitigating implementation risks.  \n \n140.  External  and  Macroeconomic  Risks.  Despite  uncertainty \nthe  geopolitical \nenvironment,  the  external  environment  in  recent  years  has  been  largely  favorable  to  Pakistan \nand the country has had strong macroeconomic indicators in the past 5 years. However, while \nstructural  reforms  are  beginning  to  show  positive  results,  poverty  levels  and  inequality  remain \nhigh and must be reduced. The widening trade imbalance and current account deficit, insecurity \nin  the  region,  and  the  cost  of  earthquake  reconstruction  accentuate  the  macroeconomic  risks. \nSome of the risks are beyond the control of the federal Government and the GoPb, but prudent \neconomic  management  strategies  can  mitigate  macroeconomic  vulnerability.  Significant \nincreases  in  the  expenditure  allocations  for  the  social  sectors  and  direct  poverty  reduction \nmeasures will lead to higher poverty reduction impact. \n   \n\nin \n\n32 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n33\n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  of  Pakistan  has  given  the \n\n141. \nfollowing assurances, which are to be incorporated into the legal documents:  \n \n\nCounterpart  funds  will  be  used  to  meet  the  reform  and  other  financing  needs \nrelating to the implementation of the PGEIP. \nThe  prior  actions  and  related  policy  reforms  undertaken  to  satisfy  the  prior \nactions  in  the  SP1  policy  matrix  in  Appendix  7  and  allow  the  program  loan \nagreement  to  take  effect  shall  be  sustained  for  the  duration  of  the  PGEIP  and \nbeyond.  \nThe Planning Commission pro-forma II for the TA loan will have been approved \nby the Provincial Development Working Party.  \n\n \n142.  The Government has also given the following additional specific assurances with respect \nto the allocation of resources from the PGEIP proceeds for purposes of accelerating the funding \nof the civil service pension system: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\nThere  is  currently  an  existing  allocation  in  the  Public  Accounts  of  PRs12  billion \n(approximately  $200  million)  to  the  PPF  and  the  GPIF.    Although  the  allocation \nhas been made, the amount has yet to be transferred to the PPF and the GPIF.  \nPunjab  will  transfer  the  amounts  for  this  allocation  to  the  accounts  of  the  PPF \nand  the  GPIF  in  commercial  bank(s)  that  meets  the  prudential  regulatory \nrequirements  of  the  State  Bank  of  Pakistan  before  the  end  of  financial  year \n2009\u20132010  through  (for  the  avoidance  of  doubt,  the  eventual  apportionment  of \nthe amounts between the PPF and the GPIF will be determined by Punjab): \n\n(a)  \n\nPRs6 billion (about $101.7 million) before the end of FY2008\u20132009, and \n\n(b) \n\nPRs6 billion (about $101.7 million) before the end of FY2009\u20132010. \n\n(ii) \n\nIn  capitalizing  the  PPF  and  the  GPIF  with  a  minimum  aggregate  amount  of \nPRs100  billion  (about  $1.7  billion)  by  FY2015\u20132016,  of  which  the  equivalent  of \nPRs5.9 billion ($100 million) will be derived from the counterpart funds (to avoid \ndoubt,  the  eventual  apportionment  of  the  aggregate  amount  between  the  PPF \nand the GPIF will be determined by the GoPb), the GoPb will:  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(a)  \n \n(b) \n\n \n(c) \n\n \n(d) \n\nallocate PRs6 billion (about $101.7 million) for FY2007\u20132008;  \n\nthrough  the  Medium-Term  Budget  Framework  for  FY2008\u20132009  to \nFY2010\u20132011,  allocate  PRs8  billion  (about  $135.6  million)  for  FY2008\u2013\n2009, PRs10 billion (about $169.5 million) for FY2009\u20132010, and PRs14 \nbillion (about $237.3 million) for FY2010\u20132011;  \n\nthrough  the  Medium-Term  Budget  Framework  for  FY2011\u20132012  to \nFY2013\u20132014,  allocate  an  amount  proportionate  to  the  Punjab\u2019s  budget \nfor each such financial year, such amounts to be of an increasing order; \nand \n\nthrough  the  Medium-Term  Budget  Framework  for  FY2014\u20132015  to \nFY2016\u20132017,  allocate  an  amount  proportionate  to  Punjab\u2019s  budget  for \n\n \n\n\fFY2014\u20132015  and  2015\u20132016,  such  amounts  to  be  of  an  increasing \norder.  \n\n(iii) \n\nTo capitalize the PPF and the GPIF, as described in the previous paragraph, the \nGoPb will: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nappend  the  Funding  Strategy  to  the  respective  Medium-Term  Budget \nFrameworks; and \ntransfer the respective amounts to the accounts of the PPF and the GPIF \nin  commercial  bank(s)  that  meets  the  prudential  regulatory  requirements \nof the State Bank of Pakistan before the end of the respective fiscal year. \n\nVIII.

Enhancing  the  effectiveness  of  public \nfinancial  management  in  the  Punjab  has  been  the  principal  objective  of  the  Punjab  Resource \nManagement  Program  (PRMP).  Under  subprogram  (SP)  1  of  PRMP  (covering  reforms  over \nJanuary 2003\u2013June 2005), the government of the Punjab (GoPb) launched and implemented a \nrange of key reform measures focused on fiscal restructuring to boost revenue generation and \nexpenditure  rationalization,  and  private  sector  development.  Under  SP2  of  PRMP  (July  2005\u2013\nJune 2007) the government carried forward the reforms focusing on (i) creating fiscal space, (ii) \nimproving efficiency and transparency in the allocation and use of funds, (iii) increasing the pro-\npoor impact of public spending and service delivery, and (iv) creating an enabling environment \nfor private sector development. \n \n2. \nCreating fiscal space was a major objective of the PRMP. Measures to enhance revenue \nmobilization included the rationalization of the tax structure, and analytical work in preparation \nfor  the  reorganization  of  the  Excise  and  Taxation  Department  to  increase  efficiency  in  tax \ncollection.  Rationalization  of  expenditure  was  achieved  primarily  through  the  reduction  of \ninterest  payments  by  swapping  high-interest  cash  development  loans  (CDLs)  from  the  federal \nGovernment  with  less-costly  borrowings  from  international  donors.  During  the  PRMP, \n$300 million  in  CDLs  was  retired  by  the  provincial  government.  The  introduction  of  a \nmedium-term framework in fiscal planning and budgeting represents a key achievement under \nthe  PRMP.  The  Finance  Department  (FD)  prepared  the  first  medium-term  budget  framework \n(MTBF)  in  fiscal  year  (FY)  2004,  which  included  3-year  annual  rolling  estimates  of  the  main \ncategories of revenues and expenditures. The Planning and Development Department (P&DD) \nprepared a medium-term development framework (MTDF) for the first time in FY2006.   \n \n3. \nCivil  service  reforms  under  the  PRMP  emphasized  capacity  building  of  civil  servants, \nespecially through international exposure for senior public servants. A training relationship has \nbeen established with the Singapore Civil Service College. A civil service census of provincial \ngovernment has been pilot-tested in one district government. A number of measures were also \ntaken  to  facilitate  private  sector  development,  including  (i)  pilot-testing  of  public-private \npartnership models in the health sector, (ii) completion of an assessment of the provincial policy \nenvironment  and  cost  of  doing  business,  and  (iii)  strengthening  of  property  rights  though \nimproved land titling.  \n \n4. \nBy taking a holistic approach to a wide range of reform areas, the PRMP has laid a firm \nbasis  for  public  resource  management  reforms  in  the  Punjab.  Strengthening  public  resource \nmanagement, however, is a complex and gradual process that requires long-term commitment. \nThe  devolution  process  has  also  brought  about  new  challenges  that  require  realignment  of \npower and responsibilities between the provincial and local governments. Building on the reform \noutcomes  over  2003\u20132007,  the  GoPb  now  wishes  to  undertake  a  range  of  second-generation \nreforms to deal effectively with the challenges it faces. \n \n5. \nAchievements  of  Punjab  Devolved  Social  Services  Program.  Pakistan  introduced \nsweeping  devolution  reforms  in  2001.  A  key  objective  underpinning  devolution  is  improved \nsocial  service  delivery.  Poor  social  service  delivery,  and  the  resultant  lack  of  human \ndevelopment,  has  been  a  major  cause  of  poverty.  Devolution  was  intended  to  significantly \n\n \n\n\f \n40 \n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nenhance service delivery by bringing service providers and governments closer to citizens than \nthey had been under a centralized system. The loans for the Punjab Devolved Social Services \nProgram  (PDSSP) 1 were  designed  within  this  broad  context.  The  program  was  approved  on \n20 December  2004,  and  the  first  tranche  was  released  on 26  December  2005.  The  release  of \nthe second tranche is currently under consideration.  \n \n6. \nPDSSP  is  a  multi-sector  and  multidimensional  governance  reform  program.  It  seeks  to \nstrengthen  devolved  social  services  for  more  equitable,  efficient,  effective,  and  sustainable \ndelivery  of  social  services  in  line  with  Punjab  Local  Government  Ordinance  (PLGO)  2001.  It \naddresses governance, financing, and technical constraints on devolved service delivery in the \nhealth,  education,  special  education,  and  water  supply  and  sanitation  sectors.  Reforms  under \nPDSSP seek three principal policy outcomes:  \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nrealigning intergovernmental relations to support devolved social services, \nrationalizing and setting minimum standards for social services, and  \nstrengthening  public  accountability  mechanisms  and  promoting  public-private \npartnerships.  \n\n \nVarious initiatives have been implemented under the PDSSP. Some key achievements \n\n7. \nto date are highlighted below. \n \n8. \nArticulating  and  Clarifying  Devolution.  Local  governments  initially  faced  huge \nproblems  in  comprehending  devolution.  There  was  a  lack  of  understanding  about  devolved \nfinancial and administrative powers. To facilitate the working of devolution and local government, \na  compendium  of  local  government  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  has  been  prepared  and \npublished by PDSSP. The document has been circulated free of cost to all local governments. It \nhas effectively helped explain devolution to provincial and local governments.  \n \nInstituting  Planning.  Local  government  planning  capacity  was  practically  nonexistent \n9. \nbefore  the  implementation  of  the  PDSSP.  Under  the  PDSSP,  local  government  planning  has \nreceived  tremendous  impetus  from  the  annual  sector  planning  (ASP)  process.  Through \nintensive training, capacity building, and strong emphasis on ASP, the PDSSP has introduced \nguidelines for planning, initiated the annual planning process, and instituted planning practice at \nthe local government level.  \n \n10. \nIn addition to ASP, the PDSSP also supported strategic planning over the medium term. \nThe  medium-term  development  strategic  directions  for  the  four  social  sectors  covered  by  the \nPDSSP  have  found  fully  expression  in  the  development  of  the  MTDF.  The  MTDF  has  also \nbecome a key instrument for linking expenditure with improvements in service delivery. \n \nBridging  Financing  Gaps  and  Introducing  Rules-Based  Resource  Allocation. The \n11. \nPDSSP introduced the concept of resource allocation to local governments through conditional \ngrants. These have made possible timely and assured transfers of funds to local governments in \na  transparent  manner,  helped  to  bridge  financing  gaps,  assisted  the  local  governments  in \nimproving  social  service  delivery,  and  paved  the  way  for  introducing  transparent  rules-based \nresource allocation.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2004.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f      \n\nAppendix 2     \n\n41\n\n \n\nAddressing Human Resource Constraints. With the requirements of the PDSSP, the \n12. \nGoPb  has  filled  a  large  number  of  vacancies  in  the  four  social  sectors.  These  have  helped \nalleviate capacity constraints on service delivery. \n \nIntroducing Service Delivery Standards. For the first time, service delivery standards \n13. \nhave been introduced for social service delivery in the health, education, special education, and \nwater  supply  and  sanitation  sectors  in  the  province.  The  development  and  enforcement  of \ntechnical and service standards are important instruments for improving the quality of services. \nThe  standards  provide  benchmarks  for  regulators,  service  providers,  and  users.  Setting \ntechnical  and  service  standards  is  especially  important  in  the  post-devolution  era  as  the \nprovincial  government  becomes  less  directly  involved  with  service  delivery,  while  assuming  a \nmore important role as policy maker, regulator, and standard setter.  \n \n14. \nImproving  Service  Delivery. On the important objective of improving service delivery, \nthough only very limited data are currently available, there is tentative evidence to suggest that \nsocial  service  delivery  has  improved  since  devolution  in  2001.  For  example,  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB)-Department for International Development (DFID)-World Bank report \nDevolution in Pakistan (2004)2 notes that the efforts of the monitoring committee have resulted \nin improved attendance of staff working in social sectors. Furthermore, health sector employees \nare  now  more  likely  to  visit  health  facilities  than  before  devolution.  The  Social  Audit  of \nGovernance  and  Delivery  of  Public  Services  of  the  Centro  de  Investigaci\u00f3n  de  Enfermedades \nTropicales 3  found  that  overall  satisfaction  with  government  health  facilities  increased  by  5 \npercentage points in 2004 over the 2002 figure to reach 70%. More rigorous empirical analysis \nis  required  to  assess  the  impact  of  devolution  on  service  delivery  (footnote  2).  Supported  by \nADB  TA  4504  under  PDSSP,  the  Punjab  is  undertaking  a  second  multiple-indicator  cluster \nsurvey. This will help generate the necessary data for assessing changes in service delivery.  \n \n15. \nStrengthening  Monitoring.  The  development  of  service  standards  has  been  coupled \nwith the development of systematic monitoring frameworks for provincial and local governments. \nThese  measures  have  helped  improve  the  accountability  mechanisms  of  both  provincial  and \nlocal governments.  \n \nEnhancing  Public-Private  Partnerships.  The  development  of  public-private \n16. \npartnerships (PPPs) has the potential to increase the pool of resources, mitigate risks through \nrisk sharing, and enhance the efficiency of service delivery. In the Punjab, private participation \nin  the  health  and  education  sectors  has  become  increasingly  significant.  With  the  increased \ninterest  in  PPPs,  the  province  urgently  needs  a  comprehensive  PPP  policy  and  regulatory \nframework  to  guide  PPP  practice.  The  PDSSP  supported  the  development  of  a  well-defined \nPPP  strategy.  This  has  also  gone  a  long  way  toward  institutionalizing  PPPs,  augmenting \nresources for public service delivery, and improving efficiency. \n \n17. \nSetting a Road Map for Devolution. The promulgation of PLGO 2001 and subordinate \nlegislation since 2001 has enabled the devolution of administrative and financial powers to local \ngovernments. However, local governments still face problems in implementing these powers. It \nis  thus  critical  that  the  gaps  in  implementing  devolution  are  identified  and  plugged  to  enable \nlocal  governments  to  perform  their  functions  effectively.

Since devolution is a complex process involving institutional as well \nas  cultural  change,  it  requires  persistent  efforts  over  the  medium  to  long  term.  The  key \nchallenges  facing  the  PDSSP  are  to  sustain  achievements  and  deepen  devolution.  Concerted \nand  persistent  efforts  are  required  to  advance  devolution  and  improve  service  delivery  in \nPakistan significantly beyond the initiatives under the PDSSP.  \n \n19. \nBuilding  on  the  broad  institutional  and  technical  frameworks  on  devolution  that  have \nbeen put in place by PDSSP, second-generation reforms to improve services need to probe in \nmore depth and address sector-specific issues in a focused manner. Health sector reforms are \nespecially important in this context, given the World Bank\u2019s deep involvement in the education \nsector,  and  the  relatively  poor  health  sector  indicators  in  the  province.  The  millennium \ndevelopment  goal  (MDG)  program,  focusing  on  health,  is  proposed  with  this  consideration  in \nmind. \n \nII. \n \nA. \n \n20. \nPublic resource management is the primary tool for a country\u2019s economic management \nand public service delivery. Fiscal management and the quality of civil service are the two core \nelements of effective public resource management. Fiscal management consists of systems and \nprocedures for medium-term planning and budgeting, as well as measures aimed at fiscal space \ncreation  through  public  expenditure  management  and  revenue  generation  reform.  Public \nexpenditure  management \nrationalization,  and \nprioritization measures. Expenditure compression is aimed at reducing nonproductive spending \n(e.g., interest payments), while expenditure rationalization and prioritization include streamlining \nthe  current  expenditure  pattern  to  make  it  more  efficient  and  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s \ndevelopment  priorities  (e.g.,  pension  reform,  salary  and  wage  reform,  and  divestment  of \nloss-making state-owned enterprises). Revenue-generation measures represent another tool for \nfiscal  space  creation.  They  consist  mainly  of  initiatives  to  increase  the  revenue  yield  of  taxes \nand fees raised by the government (e.g., tax policy and tax administration reform, and reform of \nuser fees).  \n \n21. \nThe quality of the civil service is the second main pillar of public resource management, \nas it critically affects government\u2019s efficiency and effectiveness in attaining its fiscal policy goals, \nand  ultimately  its  responsiveness  to  citizens\u2019  needs.  A  well-functioning  civil  service  would \nenable  the  government  to  attract  and  retain  qualified  and  competent  staff  and  to  hold  them \naccountable for results while benefiting the citizens through improved public service delivery.  \n \n22. \nPrivate sector development can also play a key role in enhancing the efficiency of public \nresource  management  by  improving  the  revenue-generating  capacity  and  enabling  a  more \nefficient allocation of resources across competing priorities. On the one hand, private sector\u2013led \ngrowth would enlarge the tax base of the economy and increase the revenue yield. On the other \nhand, a dynamic and vibrant private sector would allow public sector disengagement from the \nprovision of goods and services that do not justify public sector involvement. This would in turn \ncreate  fiscal  space  for  the  provision  of  public  service  services  and  government  spending  in \npro-poor sectors.  \n\ninclude  expenditure  compression, \n\ntools \n\n \n\n\f      \n\nAppendix 2     \n\n43\n\n \n\nB. \n\nSector Background, Key Challenges, and Recent Achievements \n\n1. \n\nMedium-Term Planning and Budgeting \n\nA growing number of developing countries have adopted the medium-term expenditure \n23. \nframework (MTEF)4 to increase predictability in resource allocation, and to strengthen the links \nbetween policy, planning, and budgeting. Recent studies5 have highlighted the importance of a \ngood  macro-fiscal  model  and  solid  budget  management  and  execution  practices  as  two  key \nenabling conditions for the successful implementation of MTEF.  \n  \n24.  Weak  Budget  Preparation  and  Execution  and  Poor  Performance  Orientation. \nDevelopment expenditure is specifically related to investment in the development of physical or \nhuman  resources  through  defined  projects.  In  this  sense  it  must  be  distinguished  from  the \naccounting  distinction  between  current  and  capital  expenditure.  A  development  project  may \ninvolve both recurrent and capital elements.  \n \nThe recurrent budget refers to expenditures that are recurrent in nature and are further \n25. \ndistinguished between regular and new expenditures. Budget submissions are made separately \nfor the two expenditures, and priority in reviewing budget submissions is typically directed to the \nnew  expenditure.  Regular  expenditure  is  increased  to  reflect  pay  and  price  increases  but  is \nassumed to be necessary and not subject to in-depth scrutiny. New expenditure may arise as a \nresult  of  a  development  project  with  recurrent  expenditure  implications.  When  the  project  is \ncompleted  it  is  treated  as  new  expenditure  on  the  recurrent  budget  for  a  3-year  period  before \nbeing absorbed into the regular budget if its continuation is still justified.6  \n \n26. \nThe annual budget statement in its current format does not provide a transparent picture \nof  the  allocation  of  resources  across  sectors  and  spending  categories.  Expenditures  are  only \naggregated  along  functional  classifications,  which  do  not  provide  information  about  the \ncomposition  of  expenditures  as  would  be  captured  from  the  economic  classification.  In  the \nannual  budget  statement  there  is  no  overall  summary  statement  giving  an  overview  of  the \ngovernment budget in terms of surplus or deficit. \n \nOn 1 November the budget call circular (BCC) is circulated to each department. It sets \n27. \nout  the  standard  forms  for  preparing  the  budget  proposals,  together  with  guidelines  for  their \ncompletion. The recurrent budget submissions are received and adjusted by the Budget Wing of \nthe  FD. 7  There  are  no  formal  meetings  with  departments  to  negotiate  changes  in  the \nsubmissions,  though  informal  contact  may  be  made.  In  the  case  of  development  expenditure, \nthe departmental submissions are examined in the P&DD. The BCC was updated in 2005/2006 \nto  reflect  the  move  to  collect  data  for  the  MTBF,  and  included  nonfinancial  data  relating  to \n\n                                                 \n4  In  the  literature,  the  term  \u201cmedium-term  budget  framework\u201d  (MTBF)  is  sometimes  used  interchangeably  with \n\n\u201cMTEF.\u201d   \n\n5   For a comprehensive review of cross-country experience with MTEF implementation, see Le Houerou, P., and R. \nTaliercio. 2002.

World Bank, Washington, DC.  \n\n6   The  main  linkage  between  the  recurrent  and  development  budgets  arises  from  the  fact  that  though  there  is  an \nelement of external donor funding for the development budget, the greater part of it is funded from the surplus on \nthe provincial revenue account and also from any balance on the public account. Therefore, the amount available \nfor development is determined by the FD, taking into account the total budget available and deducting the amount \nrequired for nondevelopment. \n\n7   For  the  regular  budget,  consideration  is  given  to  the  overall  increase  compared  with  the  previous  year  and  to \nspecific increases in line items. For new expenditure, documentary evidence of the need for and approval of such \nexpenditure is examined. \n\n \n\n\f \n44 \n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\ndepartmental  visions,  goals,  objectives,  and  targets.  However,  there  appears  to  be  little \nresponse  to  requests  for  nonfinancial  information8.  As  the  P&DD  circulates  another  form  to \ncollect information for inclusion in the annual development program and the MTDF, departments \nmay see the budget circular forms as duplication. There is a clear need to review and improve \nthe BCC. \n \n28. \nBudget  execution  monitoring  is  limited  to  an  assessment  of  actual  spending  versus \nbudget  allocation  for  the  purpose  of  updating  budget  estimates.  Heads  of  departments  submit \nthe  first  statement  of  excess  and  surrenders  (SES)  on  1  January  and  the  second  SES  on  31 \nMarch. These contain details of the actual expenditure of the first 4 and the first 8 months of the \nfiscal  year,  respectively.  The  SES  does  not  represent  an  instrument  for  monitoring  budget \nperformance  and  devising  corrective  actions.  On  the  basis  of  the  SES,  the  FD  revises  the \nbudget  estimates  (revised  estimates  and  final  revised  estimates,  respectively)  for  the  current \nfiscal  year,  while  heads  of  departments  assess  the  need  for  additional  grants,  and  hence  for \nsubmitting a supplementary budget request.  \n \nof \n29. \nthe  provincial  government,  the  district  governments,  and  other  government  entities.  Under  the \nWorld  Bank\u2013supported  Project  for  Improvement  of  Financial  Reporting  and  Accountability \n(PIFRA), the accounting and auditing functions have been separated.9 In the Punjab, accounts \nauditing  has  experienced  considerable  delays.  For  FY2004\u20132005,  the  submission  of  the \nprovincial  accounts  audit  report  was  delayed  by  more  than  12  months,  while  the  backlog  in \nfollow-up to audit reports was as high as 11 years. Two public accounts committees have been \ncreated to fast-track the review of audit reports and audited accounts.  \n\naccounts \n\nPakistan \n\nGeneral \n\nAuditor \n\naudits \n\nThe \n\nthe \n\nof \n\n \n30. \nLimited  Integration  between  Budgeting  and  Medium-Term  Planning.  The objective \nof  MTEF  is  to:  (i)  enforce  fiscal  discipline  through  the  control  of  aggregate  expenditures, \n(ii) support  the  strategic  allocation  of  resources  to  sectors,  and  (iii)  ensure  cost-effective \nimplementation of programs and service delivery.  \n \n31. \nThe  implementation  of  MTEF  requires  interaction  among  the  central  departments  (FD \nand  P&DD),  the  line  departments,  and  the  local  governments.  Effective  MTEF  requires:    (i) \nsound  and  reliable  forecasts  of  resources  available  over  the  medium  term,    (ii)    a  transparent \nmechanism  for  determining  the  sectoral  allocation  of  resources,    (iii)  capacity  to  enforce  the \nsectoral  allocation  as  either  hard  or  soft  budget  ceilings,  (iv)  performance-based  budgeting \nrelating the recurrent and development budgets to performance targets and indicators, and (v) a \nbudget  data  recording  system,  which  captures  financial  and  nonfinancial  data  that  feed  into \nmedium-term estimates of available resources.  \n\n \n\n32. \nThe MTBF contains sectoral expenditure allocations for the nondevelopment budget, but \nit is difficult to relate these allocations directly to the annual budget statement, as the manner of \npresentation is different and they are not currently used to provide departments with ceilings or \nguidelines for budget preparation.10  \n \n\n                                                 \n8   This may be due to the way the forms are designed, as they do not clearly specify the nature of the information to \n\nbe included in them, and to the lack of training and awareness provided for this purpose. \n\n9   A  district  audit  function  has  been  established  and  auditing  methods  have  been  updated  and  are  compatible  with \nthe Financial Audit Manual (2005), though this has not yet been fully applied throughout the provincial government, \nespecially in respect of the performance audit procedure. \n\n10  The sector totals comprise a grouping of departments together with district budgets and would therefore need to be \n\ndisaggregated to feed into the budget process.  \n\n \n\n\f      \n\nAppendix 2     \n\n45\n\n \n\nPerformance-based  budgeting  (PBB)  allows  the  formulation  of  budget  estimates  in  line \n33. \nwith  the  cost  of  the  resources  necessary  to  deliver  a  desired  standard  of  services.  The  dual \nbudget process in the Punjab undermines the scope of PBB as its incremental approach makes \nit difficult to align the resource envelope with the service delivery goals. Likewise, the separation \nbetween  recurrent  and  development  budgets  hampers  a  comprehensive  assessment  of  the \ncross-budgetary implications of the activities underlying public service delivery.  \n \n34. \nLow  Value  for  Money  in  Public  Service  Delivery.  The  devolution  process  has \nincreased  the  responsibility  of  local  governments  in  the  delivery  of  essential  public  services: \nhealth  care  and  education  are  the  primary  responsibility  of  district  governments,  while  water \nsupply and sanitation are the responsibility of the tehsil municipal administrations (TMAs) 11  and \nthe union councils.  \n \n35. \nThe  capacity  of  local  governments  to  allocate  scarce  resources  in  line  with  the \ndevelopment  priorities  is  weak.  Under  the  devolved  system,  the  zila  nazim  (elected  district \nrepresentative) enjoys relative autonomy in the definition of budget allocation and the budget is \nsubject  solely  to  approval  from  the  district  council.  To  date,  though  district  governments  are \nresponsible for the delivery of basic education and health services, their budget estimates are \nnot  based  on  desired  standards  of  services.  A  system  for  assessing  the  cost  of  providing \nservices is currently not in place, and this further exacerbates the disconnect between allocated \nresources and the funds needed to meet their service delivery obligations. \n \n36. \nRecent  Achievements.  The  first  MTBF  was  published  by  the  FD  in  August  2004. \nHowever,  the  ultimate  purpose  of  the  MTBF  exercise  has  been  undermined  by  the  fact  that  it \nhas not been updated yearly, and thus does not provide a realistic assessment of the resources \navailable over the medium term. A new MTBF for FY2008 to FY2010 has been approved by the \nFD. An MTBF cell tasked with producing the MTBF has also been created within the FD. This \ncell is still not fully staffed, however, and terms of reference and job descriptions have not been \nprepared.   \n \n37. \nThe first MTDF was published in FY2006. Unlike the MTBF, the MTDF is updated yearly \nand the published MTDF documentation provides an overview of the sectoral visions, strategies, \nand  key  targets  for  the  period.  An  MTDF  cell  has  also  been  established  in  the  P&DD  to \nformulate the MTDF, monitor its execution, and coordinate with other divisions in P&DD. In this \ncase as well, however, operationalization of the MTDF cell has been very limited.  \n \nSince  FY2006,  sector  departments  have  been  requested  to  submit  details  of  the \n38. \nperformance  targets  to  be  achieved  through  the  execution  of  Annual  Development  Program. \nThese targets are anchored in the MDGs, though it is not clear to what extent they are costed, \nand hence whether they are linked to development expenditure estimates.  \n \n39. \nThe Department of Irrigation and Power (DI&P) has already established a Strategy and \nPlanning  and  Reform  Unit  with  assistance  from  the  Irrigation  Development  Policy  Loan  of  the \nWorld Bank, with the objective of strategic planning, monitoring and evaluation, and facilitation \nin the implementation of various activities of the reform program under the Development Policy \nLoan. \n \n\n                                                 \n11 TMA is the second layer of the local government system created by the devolution. The local government system \n\nincludes district governments, TMAs, and union councils. \n\n \n\n\f \n46 \n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nIn 2005, the Department of Health (DOH) established a Policy and Strategy Support Unit \n40. \nresponsible  for  (i)  developing  DOH  policy  priorities  and  transforming  policy  statements  into \nimplementation plans; (ii) organizing, managing, and coordinating technical support in the health \nsector  and  building  local  capacity  accordingly;  and  (iii)  fostering  a  culture  of  participatory  and \ninformation-based  decision  making  and  needs-based  data  collection  in  the  health  sector. \nAlthough  some  progress  was  made  in  the  establishment  of  the  unit,  changes  in  political \ncircumstances have stalled its operationalization.   \n \nThe Local Government Planning Manual has been developed with assistance from the \n41. \nDecentralization Support Program of ADB. The manual is a tool to support bottom-up planning \nwithin  the  context  of  the  devolved  services  system  and  to  integrate  provincial  policy  priorities \ninto local governments\u2019 actions and decisions.  \n \n42. \nIn  an  effort  to  increase  its  revenue-generation  capacity,  the  GoPb  has  adopted \nsignificant  reforms  in  its  tax  policy  and  tax  administration  procedures.  These  include  the \nsimplification and rationalization of both the urban immovable property tax and the stamp duty. \nTo streamline tax administration, a time-bound action plan for the reorganization of the Excise \nand  Taxation  Department  and  the  automation  of  tax  assessment  and  collection  has  been \nprepared and approved.    \n\n2. \n\nCivil Service Pension System \n\n \n\n43. \nThe GoPb is the largest employer in Pakistan, with about one million civil servants and \nabout 388,000 pensioners (including retired employees, and spouses and eligible dependents of \ndeceased  employees).  The  pension  system  rests  on  two  main  pillars:  the  Punjab  pension \nsystem  (PPS)  and  the  General  Provident  Fund  (GPF).  Membership  in  both  schemes  is \nmandatory. Since 2005, most civil servants have been hired on a contractual basis and are not \nentitled to PPS and GPF benefits, receiving instead a 30% salary premium. About 50,000 civil \nservants have been contractual employees since 2005.  \n \n44. \nThe PPS is a noncontributory, unfunded defined-benefits system financed from current \ngovernment  revenues.  The  normal  retirement  age  is  60,  subject  to  the  employee\u2019s  having \ncompleted 10 years of service. Individual benefit levels are determined by a formula that takes \ninto account the final wage and the length of service. The replacement rate is capped at 70% (of \nthe basic wage in the final year) for a worker with 30 years of service. Up to 35% of the pension \ncan be commuted and taken as a lump sum, and the remainder is paid as an annuity until death. \n \n45. \nThe  GPF  is  an  employee-only  contributory  scheme.  Civil  servants  are  required  to \ncontribute  3\u20138%  of  basic  salary  to  the  GPF,  and  the  contributions  are  notionally  housed  in \nindividual accounts. Aside from book entry, employee contributions are not kept separately, and \nare included in the provincial government\u2019s consolidated accounts. Accumulated funds are not \ninvested  to  meet  pension  obligations,  which  like  the  liabilities  under  the  PPS,  are  financed \nthrough the general budget. The government determines the rate of return on employees\u2019 GPF \ncontributions each year, which is currently around 11%. Workers can borrow from their accounts \nup to age 50 for specific purposes such as illness and related travel, overseas travel related to a \ndependent\u2019s  education,  marriages  and  funerals,  and  purchase  of  land,  house,  and  vehicles. \nAfter age 50, members can borrow up to 60% of the balance without having to give a reason or \npay  back  the  advance.  After  age  55,  an  advance  of  up  to  80%  of  the  balance  can  be  made, \nagain with no need to repay the advance. Any remaining balance can be taken as a lump sum \nat the age of 60 or a year before retirement. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f      \n\nAppendix 2     \n\n47\n\n \n\n \n\nTwo other benefit schemes are available to the employees of the GoPb: the Benevolent \n46. \nFund (BF) and the Central Employees Insurance Fund (CEIF). The BF covers all civil servants \nexcept the police and the Population Welfare Department. Civil servants contribute 2% of their \nbasic pay, and receive a range of benefits such as a monthly payment to dependents on death \nin service, marriage benefits, funeral grants, and education scholarships. The deductions for the \nCEIF are paid as premiums to State Life Insurance, and provide a death benefit.  \n \n47. \nUnfunded  Pension  System.  As  highlighted  above,  both  the  PPS  and  the  GPF  are \nunfunded  schemes  financed  through  the  provincial  budget.  Preliminary  estimates  indicate  that \nthe  government\u2019s  pension  liabilities  could  be  as  high  as  PRs400  billion.  The  outstanding  GPF \nbalance,  including  contributions  and  interest  credited,  is  reported  at  PRs17  billion.  Pension \noutlays  have  escalated  in  recent  years,  and  increased  from  PRs1.7  billion  in  FY1991  to \nPRs12.6 billion in FY2006. Interest payments on GPF balances have likewise increased sharply \nand  amounted  to  PRs4.5  billion  in  FY2006.  GPF  interest  payments  currently  exceed \ncontribution, and the net outflow is projected to rise in the coming years. \n \nThe  GoPb  recognizes  that  its  pension  obligations  have  important  implications  for  the \n48. \nfinances  of  the  province,  and  that  pension  expenditures,  if  unchecked,  could  crowd  out \ninvestment  in  the  infrastructure  and  social  sectors.  Urgent  reforms  are  therefore  needed  to \nensure  the  financial  sustainability  of  the  pension  system,  and  to  create  the  fiscal  space  for \npriority development expenditures.  \n \n49.  Weak Record-Keeping, Administration, and Payment System.  In \npayroll \nfunctions,  the  Office  of  the  Accountant  General,  Punjab  (AGP)  records  civil  servants\u2019 \nemployment data, including name, identification number, date of employment, wage history, and, \nas  applicable,  the  date  of  retirement,  termination  of  employment,  or  death.  At  retirement,  the \nworker makes an application with the Office of the AGP, which calculates the worker\u2019s benefits \nand  creates  a  payment  booklet.  To  collect  the  monthly  benefit  the  pensioner  (or  dependent) \nmust present the payment booklet to a designated payment agent at a branch of the National \nBank of Pakistan (NBP).  \n \n50. \nAn effective pension system requires: (i) a system for accurately recording employment \nhistory and employee contribution, and calculating benefits; and (ii) a system for ensuring timely \npayment of benefits to pensioners. The calculation of pension benefits is based on the length of \nservice and final salaries. The calculation of GPF balances is relatively more complex, requiring \ninformation on (i) deductions of monthly contributions from payroll based on grades, (ii) crediting \nof  yearly  interest  on  the  balances,  and  (iii)  advances  against  balances  and  repayment  of \nadvances.  The  system  of  record-keeping  and  benefit  calculations  in  the  Punjab  is  largely \nmanual  and  paper-based.  The  absence  of  a  robust  record-keeping  and  management \ninformation  system,  combined  with  weak  accounting  and  actuarial  analysis  capacity,  has \nresulted  in  problems  regarding  the  accuracy  of  pension  entitlement  calculation  and  individual \npayments. Cases of missing contributions, and therefore missing investment returns on the GPF, \nare common. There is no formal mechanism for a pensioner to initiate an inquiry or an appeals \nprocess when such omissions occur.  \n \n51. \nPension  disbursement  through  a  designated  branch  of  NBP  is  costly  because  of  the \ncumbersome identification and entitlement verification processes. The payment agent identifies \nthe retiree through the latter\u2019s identification card and payment booklet, makes the payment, and \nrecords  the  payment  in  the  payment  booklet  and  on  the  form  obtained  from  the  Office  of  the \nAGP.  A  copy  of  the  form  is  retained  by  the  payment  agent  and  another  copy  is  routed  to  the \nOffice  of  the  AGP.  The  present  system  generates  a  payment  notice  to  the  authorized  NBP \n\nits \n\n \n\n\f \n48 \n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nbranch  for  each  transaction  and  does  not  include  monthly  authorized  allocations.  This \narrangement  not  only  further  increases  the  cost  of  pension  disbursement,  but  also  makes  the \nsystem  more  error-prone.  Moreover,  there  is  no  mechanism  for  triggering  an  action  when \nquestionable  transactions  occur.  Thus  leakages  from  the  system,  in  the  form  of  \u201cghost \npensioners,\u201d are results in significant and entail considerable cost to the taxpayer. The system \nof pension payments is weaker in rural areas because of the lack of adequate staff resources in \nbank branches.  \n \n52.  Weak  Benefit  Structure.  Certain  features  of  the  current  pension  scheme  have  led  to \ninequitable and arbitrary outcomes at the individual level. For instance, the last pay drawn for an \nemployee is used as the basis for calculating the pension. This can favor those who get a pay \nraise  or  a  promotion  immediately  before  retirement.  The  international  best  practice  is  to  use \naverage earnings over several years as the basis. Increases in pension benefits, to compensate \nfor changes in the cost of living, are made ad hoc, and often trail inflation. Interest payments on \nGPF contributions are likewise ad hoc and unpredictable. Currently, up to 35% of the pension \ncan be commuted and taken as a lump sum, with the remainder paid as an annuity until death. \nThe commutation allowance is high by international standards, and may not be consistent with \nthe public policy objective of facilitating consumption-smoothing and ensuring adequate old-age \nincome for civil servants. \n \nThose who joined the civil service after 2004 are employed on a contractual basis and \n53. \ndo not receive pension and GPF benefits. Over 50,000 employees thus far are affected by this \narrangement. There are now growing concerns regarding workplace morale, and the social and \npolitical  implications  of  having  a  significant  proportion  of  civil  servants  with  little  or  no  savings \nand no pension benefits.  \n \n54. \nThe  pension  rules  were  established  in  the  1960s,  and  the  GPF  rules  in  the  1970s. \nThough  certain  modifications  have  been  introduced  since,  there  is  an  urgent  need  for  a \ncomprehensive  review  of  the  two  schemes  to  assess  their  continued  relevance  in  the  current \nsocioeconomic context. \n \nRecent  Achievements.  As  the  first  step  toward  a  funded  scheme,  the  GoPb \n55. \npromulgated  the  Punjab  Pension  Fund  (PPF)  Act  in  March  2006.  The  PPF  Act  provides  the \nlegal basis for the establishment of a corporate body with the objective of generating resources \nthrough  fund  investment  to  discharge  the  pension  liability  of  the  province.  The  General \nProvident  Investment  Fund  (GPIF)  Act  has  been  submitted  to  the  provincial  assembly.  The \nobjective  of  the  GPIF  is  to  generate  investment  returns  for  the  payment  of  benefits  under  the \nGPF  pillar.  Implementing  Rules\u2014specifying  fiduciary  requirements,  exposure  limits  and  risk \nmanagement, accounting and auditing, internal controls, and compliance\u2014for both the PPF Act \nand the draft GPIF Act have been adopted. \n \n56. \nTo  date,  the  GoPb  has  earmarked  PRs8  billion  for  the  capitalization  of  the  PPF  and \nPRs4  billion  for  the  GPIF.  The  GoPb  is  committed  to  allocating  budget  resources  to  reach  a \nminimum  capitalization  of  PRs100  billion  by  FY2015/2016,  and  has  recently  completed  an \nactuarial valuation, and adopted a funding strategy for PPF and GPIF.   \n \n57. \nSteps  toward  starting  investment  operations  have  also  been  initiated.  Management \ncommittee  members,  including  private  sector  representatives,  have  been  appointed,  and  the \nselection of the managing director is under way.  \n \n\n \n\n\f      \n\nAppendix 2     \n\n49\n\n \n\n3. \n\nCivil Service Reform \n\n58. \nThe  public  sector  employs  about  11%  of  employed  workers  in  Punjab.  This  number \nincludes about 967,000 in sanctioned posts in government departments and more than 100,000 \nemployees  in  the  123  public  sector  autonomous  bodies.  While  the  share  is  moderate,  it \nunderstates  the  importance  of  the  public  sector  as  a  major  formal  sector  employer,  given  that \nself-employment  accounts  for  about  60%  of  total  employment.  The  civil  service  wage  bill  and \npensions account for about 59% of total consolidated recurrent expenditure. The need to reform \nthe  civil  service  has  been  felt  both  at  the  national  and  the  provincial  levels.  Despite  various \nattempts,  the  common  perception  is  that  the  system  remains  similar  to  that  inherited  from \nPakistan\u2019s  colonial  past.  A  recent  survey  by  Pakistan  Institute  of  Development  Economics \nindicates widespread negative perception and general discontent about public services, on the \none  hand,  and  disillusionment  of  civil  servants  themselves,  on  the  other.  Some  of  the  main \nissues in the Punjab context are discussed below. \n \n59.  Weak  Recruitment,  Performance  Evaluation,  and  Promotion.  An  effective \nrecruitment system is essential for ensuring the quality of entry of civil servants. In the Punjab, \nthe recruitment of public servants for basic pay scale (BPS) 1712 and above is carried out by the \nPunjab  Public  Service  Commission  (PPSC).  It  is  widely  acknowledged  that  the  commission \nfaces  challenges  because  of  structural,  capacity,  and  procedural  constraints.  Similarly, \nperformance evaluation has not served as an effective tool for performance monitoring. A large \nproportion of civil servants do not have job descriptions, let alone targets for achievement. The \nexisting annual confidential report is commonly regarded as a compliance task and not useful as \na  record  of  performance  evaluation.  Further,  in  a  system  in  which  promotions  are  essentially \nbased  on  seniority,  performance  evaluations  play  a  limited  role  in  career  progression.  The \npresent cadre system also places more weight on recruiting senior management from the elite \ngroups  and  not  enough  on  seeking  out  management  talent  from  specialist  groups  or  from \noutside the civil service.  \n \n60. \nUncompetitive  Compensation  and  Benefits.  There  is  substantial  evidence  that  the \nreal  compensation  gap  between  public  and  private  salaries  and  emoluments  has  steadily \nincreased.  Moreover,  the  compensation  structure  of  wages  is  not  closely  linked  with \nperformance  and  does  not  provide  adequate  incentives  for  good  performance.  The  provincial \ngovernment  has  no  control  over  civil  service  salary  scales,  which  are  set  by  the  federal \nGovernment.  It  can,  however,  create  contract  positions  outside  the  cadre  scales  or  pay \nadditional  allowances  for  specific  positions.  For  example,  program  management  units  (PMUs) \nhave been used as a device to create specific positions attracting higher reward. There is some \nevidence suggesting that the recruitment and remuneration practice of PMUs has strengthened \nperformance  incentives.  PMUs  thus  should  be  seen  as  a  testing  case  and  precursor  for \nintroducing performance-based human resource management in the civil service of the province. \n \n61. \nGaps in Contract Employment Policy. Civil services reforms are a challenging task for \nany  government.  Despite  this,  the  GoPb  has  implemented  some  important  measures.  One \nmajor  reform  initiative  since  2003  has  been  the  shift  toward  contractual  employment  for  new \nentrants  into  government  service.  Employees  recruited  on  a  contractual  basis  are  paid  an \nadditional 30% of the minimum salary of the relevant pay scale as compensation for not being \neligible  for  a  pension.  However,  the  difference  between  the  compensation  of  regular  and \n                                                 \n12 The  government  service  of  Pakistan  is  structured  across  twenty  two  basic  pay  scales  (BPS  1-22).  With  some \nexceptions,  the  government  officers  of  BPS  17  and  higher  are  categorized  as  gazetted  officers  and  assigned \nmiddle to senior level managerial responsibilities such as heads of sections, departments, field offices and drawing \nand disbursing officers. Government servants below BPS 17 generally work as support staff. \n\n \n\n\f \n50 \n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\ncontract  employees  is  not  large  enough  to  discourage  employees  from  seeking  conversion  to \nregular  mode.  The  pressure  to  convert  is  building  up  as  the  number  of  contract  employees \nincreases.  \n \nFrequent  Transfers.  There  are  no  systematic  policies  or  mechanisms  for  placements \n62. \nand transfers. In many cases, the process of placements and transfers lacks a professional and \ntechnical basis, leading to a mismatch between skills and placement. Transfers are often made \nwithin  a  year  of  service,  rather  than  the  recommended  minimum  of  2\u20133  years.  As  such,  the \nincumbents often barely have time to settle into a new job before they are moved on. \n \n63.  Weak  Technical  and  Managerial  Skills.  A  World  Bank  report 13 points  out  that  the \ntechnical competence of civil servants has been declining over the past two decades. There is \nalso  limited  interest  in  the  training  of  civil  servants  because  of  the  low  returns  from  training. \nThere have been increased efforts in the training area by the GoPb in recent years. Supported \nby the PRMP, the government entered into a short-term arrangement with the Singapore Civil \nService  College  to  undertake  various  training  programs.  These  efforts  mark  an  encouraging \nstep  toward  improving  the  capacity  of  civil  servants.  However,  much  remains  to  be  done  to \nupgrade capacity, incentives, and accountability in the system. \n \n64. \nChallenges  Posed  by  Devolution.  The  PLGO  2001  has  significantly  changed \nintergovernmental relationships. Given the relatively short period since the launch of devolution, \nthere  is  continuing  confusion  over  the  roles,  functions,  and  mandates  to  be  performed  by \ndifferent levels of government and the mechanisms for coordination between departments and \nagencies.  Lack  of  capacity  at  the  local  government  level  for  key  functions  such  as  planning, \nbudgeting,  and  human  resource  management  also  create  a  major  constraint  on  the  effective \nfunctioning of this level of government.  \n \n65. \nRecent  Achievements.  Despite  significant  challenges,  the  GoPb  has  demonstrated \nstrong commitment to push forward civil service reforms with the objective of fostering a more \nefficient,  effective,  and  responsive  government.  To  steer  the  reform  process,  Change \nManagement  Unit  (CMU)  was  recently  been  upgraded  into  the  Public  Policy  and  Change \nManagement Wing (PPCMW) of the Services and General Administration Department (S&GAD), \nunder the stewardship and oversight of the chief secretary. The Rules of Business have been \namended  and  some  of  the  functions  of  the  Organization  and  Methods  Department  were \ntransferred to the PPCMW to enable it to satisfy its mandate.  \n \n66.  With  the  support  of  ADB,  efforts  are  under  way  to  recruit  experts  to  develop  a  human \nresource  management  (HRM)  manual  and  design  a  pilot  performance-based  human  resource \nmanagement scheme for selected departments/agencies and positions. \n\n \nThe  GoPb  desires  to  further  strengthen  its  training  capability  to  upgrade  the  skills  of \n67. \nprovincial  employees.  It  has  therefore  decided  to  adopt  a  three-pronged  strategy  for  the \nprofessional  development  of  its  staff.  First,  it  is  negotiating  a  long-term  arrangement  with \nSingapore Civil Service College to build the capacity and competence of the Management and \nProfessional  Development  Department  (MPDD)  trainers  and  resource  persons  to  meet  future \ntraining  needs.  Second,  it  is  planning  to  supplement  training  resource  capabilities  by \noutsourcing some of this activity and has entered into an agreement with the Lahore University \n\n                                                 \n13  World  Bank.  2004.

A  draft  training \nframework has also been developed. \n \n\n4. \n\nPrivate Sector Development \n\n68. \nPrivate sector development is essential for the province to ensure job creation, economic \ndevelopment,  and  poverty  reduction.  The  private  sector  in  the  Punjab  is  dominated  by \nsmall-scale  informal  enterprises  operating  primarily  in  the  services  and  manufacturing  sector: \n97%  of  manufacturing  units  employ  fewer  than  10  people.  Today,  the  small-  and  medium \nenterprise (SME) sector contributes 30% of national gross domestic product (GDP) and 35% of \nnational  value  added  to  the  industrial  sector  and  generates  25%  of  manufacturing  export \nearnings.14 There  are  a  number  of  impediments  to  the  development  of  the  SME  sector.  Most \nnotable is the lack of access to financial resources, poorly developed property rights, low levels \nof  human  resource  capacity,  weak  regulatory  oversight,  expensive  but  poor  quality  of  public \nutilities, and weak marketing and transport linkages.  \n \n69. \nThe labor force in 2002 numbered an estimated 27 million, 8.5% of these unemployed. \nThe population of the Punjab is growing rapidly (3%), and the labor force is growing at a faster \nrate than the annual growth rate of new jobs registered (2.7%). The need to create new jobs, as \na  large  number  of  young  people  enter  the  labor  force,  cannot  be  overestimated.  While  the \nagricultural  sector  will  continue  to  provide  the  bulk  of  employment  opportunities  for  the \npopulation, it is debatable whether it can provide full employment to substantial new additional \nlabor. The bulk of employment opportunities have to be generated by the nonfarm sector.   \n \n70. \nLack  of  Coherent  Private  Sector  Development  Strategy.  The  Punjab needs a good \nstrategic framework to define the role of the state vis-\u00e0-vis the private sector. Although almost \n9 out of 10 Punjabis are already employed in the private sector, the reach of that sector in terms \nof contribution to provincial economy is only about 30%. The private sector requires support in \naddressing issues that have a public good element, impose positive or negative externalities on \nother businesses or the society, or have collective action issues. The state can help in this area \nby adopting a coherent private sector development (PSD) strategy and underwriting costs, and \nencouraging the development of collective solutions.  \n \n71. \nHigh  Cost  of  Doing  Business.  In  all  recent  surveys,  the  regulatory  and  compliance \nburdens for businesses in the Punjab still figure as major concerns. Financial and fiscal sector \nreforms have gone some way to reducing the cost of doing business. However, setting up the \n\u201crules of the game\u201d and the regulatory framework remains the responsibility of the government, \nand reforms in this area need to be tackled urgently. To facilitate long-term engagement on this \nissue,  the  Punjab  Government  Efficiency  Improvement  Program  (PGEIP)  foresees  the  GoPb \ninstituting a regular survey on the cost of doing business in the province. The survey will (i) set \nbenchmarks  for  performance,  (ii)  allow  tracking  of  costs  and  of  progress  made,  and  (iii)  allow \nregular and continuous engagement with the issues. It will identify the key problem areas and \nthe government will introduce measures to implement the legal and institutional reforms needed \n\n                                                 \n14 Data  for  this  section  are  taken  from  World  Bank.  2005.

This will be crucial in attracting increasing investments, \nboth foreign and local, into the Punjab.  \n \n72. \nIn  addition  to  the  cost-of-business  survey,  a  number  of  actions  can  be  taken  to \nstrengthen the regulatory framework, including: (i) a strategy of effectively promoting core labor, \nenvironment,  and  other  quality  standards;  (ii)  the  conduct  of  a  regulatory  impact  assessment, \ninstitutionalized  in  selected  departments;  and  (iii)  the  establishment  of  an  alternative  dispute \nresolution facility in Lahore. \n \n73. \nPublic-Private Partnerships. Private sector participation in the social sectors is already \nrapidly increasing in Pakistan. For example, the latest estimates show that some 30\u201335% of all \nschool-going  children  now  attend  private  schools.  Yet,  there  are  segments  of  society  that  the \nfor-profit  private  sector will  not serve,  as  these segments  do  not  afford  enough  returns  for  the \nprivate  sector.  In  addition,  there  are  areas  in  which  public  good  elements  of  services  are  so \nstrong that for-profit private sector participation does not make economic sense (public health, \npreventive health, quality of education).  \n \n74. \nAbsence  of  PPP  Framework.  There  are  sectors  providing  services  to  the  Punjab \neconomy which for historical, legal, or economic reasons have been primarily the responsibility \nof  the  public  sector.  Yet  within  these  sectors  the  public  sector  feels  that  it  cannot  deliver  the \nrequisite quality and quantity of services required to meet the demands of the people. Primarily, \nthe  government  does  not  have  enough  resources  (human,  financial  and  technical)  to  cater  to \nlarge infrastructure or service delivery needs.  PPPs can be one way  of  reducing the  demand-\nsupply gap. The Punjab lacks a policy or regulatory framework and the institutional capacity for \neffectively promoting PPPs.  \n \n75. \nRecent  Achievements.  The private sector has benefited from recent reforms including \nconsolidation, rationalization, and rate adjustment for provincial taxes (reducing the number of \ntaxes, improving payment processes, reducing compliance costs and the possibility of leakages); \nsome rationalization in labor-related levies and inspections; changes in some archaic laws (for \nexample, regarding boiler inspections); reduction in bias against commercialization of property \n(some  rationalization  in  stamp  duties  and  other  charges);  improvements  in  building  codes; \nreduction  in  bias  against  rental  property  (as  opposed  to  owner-occupied  property);  and \nfacilitation  of  private  sector  involvement  in  agricultural  marketing  (procurement,  storage, \nprocessing, and trade). \n \n\n \n\n\f      Appendix 3        53                 \n\nSTRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR AN INTEGRATED APPROACH TO FULFILL VISION 2020 \n\nA. \n\nSecond-Generation Reforms and Program Structure  \n\nIn  conjunction  with  the  implementation  of  the  Punjab  Resource  Management  Program \n1. \n(PRMP)  and  the  Punjab  Devolved  Social  Services  Program  (PDSSP),  the  government  of  the \nPunjab (GoPb) has also participated in the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) assistance to the \nfederal  Government  related  to  the  Access  to  Justice  Program  (AJP)  and  Decentralization \nSupport  Program  reforms  (paras.  9\u201311  of  main  text).  Supported  by  these  programs,  the \ngovernment  launched  and  successfully  implemented  key  public  sector  reforms  in  2003\u20132007. \nHaving accomplished some key milestones, it now wishes to move on to a second generation of \nreforms, which will form important building blocks in the medium term toward achieving Vision \n2020 (para. 6 of main text).  \n \n2. \nIn order to support all the six pillars of Vision 2020, an integrated approach comprising \nthree  distinct  program  clusters,  namely  the  Punjab  Government  Efficiency  Improvement \nProgram  (PGEIP),  Punjab  Millennium  Development  Goals  Program  (PMDGP)  and  Punjab \nAccess to Justice Program (PAJP), is planned as outlined in para. 11. Box A3.1 below presents \nan  outline  of  the  integrated  program  structure  developed  in  consultation  with  the  GoPb  and \nother  stakeholders,  which  aims  to  direct  resources  for  better  development  outcomes,  reduce \nduplication, and minimize inconsistency in policy advice and measures. A longer-term program \nis needed to provide conceptual as well as predictable financing support for the implementation \nof  reforms  over  the  next  5  years,  and  thus  ensure  that  the  overall  reform  momentum  is \nsustained and deepened. The three proposed core interventions in outline form are as follows:    \n \n\nPunjab  Government  Efficiency  Improvement  Program  (PGEIP).  This  will \nprovide  the basis  for  core  reforms  in  all  core  areas  of  public  administration  and \nfinancial  management.  The  PGEIP  will  be  designed  and  implemented  through \nthree subprograms (SPs) over 2007\u20132010, each within about 18 months. \n\nPunjab Millennium Development Goals Program (PMDGP). This program will \nbe  prepared  to  build  on  the  achievements  of  the  PDSSP.  It  will  improve  the \ndelivery of public services, particularly in the health sector, promote sustainable \npublic-private  partnerships  (PPPs),  and \nfinancing \nmechanisms (including health insurance). The health sector focus is in response \nto  the  relatively  poor  health  service  access  and  quality,  and  lagging  health \nindicators,  in  Punjab,  and  will  complement  the  World  Bank\u2019s  education  sector \nsupport. It is envisaged that the PMDGP will be implemented through 2 or 3 SPs, \nimplemented  with  an  interval  of  about  18  months  between  each  SP.  SP1  of \nPMDGP will be brought to the Board for consideration in 2008 (see Box A3.2 for \nmore details). \n\nintroduce  viable  health \n\nPunjab  Access  to  Justice  Program  (PAJP). Building on reforms implemented \nthrough the Pakistan AJP, the PAJP will be designed to deepen judicial reforms \nat  the  provincial  level,  leading  to  a  well-functioning  judiciary  supported  by \nmeasures  for  alternative  dispute  resolution,  better  police  services,  and  greater \nenforceability of contracts. Low access to justice and the inefficient operation of \nthe judicial system have long been identified as major impediments to investment \nand the well-being of citizens. It is envisaged that the PAJP will be implemented \nthrough  2  or  3  SPs,  undertaken  with  an  interval  of  about  18  months  between \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n \n\n \n\nBox A3.1: Design Framework for the Program Clusters  \n\nKey Pillars: (i) good governance, (ii) good-quality social services, and (iii) private sector\u2013led growth \nImpacts: Higher and sustained growth, and improved living standards especially for the poor and vulnerable \nOutcomes: Per capita income doubled to about $2,000 over 2004\u20132020, and all Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets met \n\nOverall Government Strategy: Vision 2020 \n\nThe Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) First-Phase Support: The Punjab Resource Management Program (PRMP) 2003\u20132007, \nthe Punjab Devolved Social Services Program (PDSSP) 2005\u20132008,  \nand the Federal Access to Justice Program (AJP) 2000\u20132007 \n\n \n\nPrincipal Achievements:  \n\n\u2022  Basic budgeting and tax reforms begun in 2003\u20132007 \n\u2022  Work begun to strengthen and rationalize the civil service, by improving incentives and contractual recruitment \n\u2022  Restructuring of public sector organizations initiated \n\u2022  Resources for social services at decentralized levels provided on the basis of outcomes\n\nAccelerating the Realization of Vision 2020 \n\nOverall Purpose: Deepen the reforms begun under PRMP, PDSSP, and the federal AJP \nReform  Imperatives:  Accelerate  resource  mobilization  for  social  development  by  strengthening  the  pension  system,  among  other \nthings;  infuse  performance  orientation  into  service  delivery;  modernize  the  civil  service;  increase  access  to  justice  for  the  poor;  and \nfacilitate private sector development \nFinancing Imperative: More than $3 billion in medium-term financing is needed to support these reforms over the next 5 years  \n\nPunjab Government Efficiency  \nImprovement Program \n\n \nStructure: Program cluster with three \noutcome-oriented single-tranche programs \nImpact: Improved public services, better \nbudgets, performance-oriented civil \nservice, fully funded civil service pension \nsystem, vibrant private sector \n\nPunjab MDG Programa \n\n \nStructure: Program cluster with \ntwo single-tranche programs \nImpact: All health-related MDGs \nmet, performance-oriented health-\ncare provision, sustained financing \nmodalities, well-defined rules for \nprivate sector participation  \n\nPunjab Access to Justice Programa \n\n \nStructure: Program cluster with three \noutcome-oriented single-tranche programs \nImpact: Enhanced efficiency of judiciary \nand law enforcement administrative \napparatus, alternative dispute resolution \nmechanism operational, stronger \nombudsman, effective social regulation \n\na First subprogram is expected to be prepared for Board consideration in 2008. \nSource: Government of the Punjab and ADB staff. \n\n5\n4\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n3\n \n\ni\n\n \n\n\f \n\n  \n\n        Appendix 3        55  \n\neach  SP.

In  this  respect,  there  are  strong  inter-linkages  and  complementarities  among  the \nPGEIP, the PMDGP, and the PAJP. For instance, the PGEIP will strengthen the capacity of the \nDepartment  of  Health  (DOH)  to  formulate  a  medium-term  investment  strategy  for  the  health \nsector  and  identify  related  financing  needs.  To  this  end,  the  establishment  of  a  Strategy  and \nPolicy  Unit  (SPU)  that  will  be  responsible  for  defining  health  sector  policies  and  strategies  is \nsupported. Building on this, the PMDGP will support the implementation of the strategies toward \nmeeting  health-related  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs).  Likewise,  the  PGEIP  will \nsupport  the  development  of  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  PPP,  which  will  in  turn \nfacilitate  private  sector  participation  in  the  provision  of  social  and  infrastructure  services. \nFurthermore, a well-functioning judiciary, which ensures enforceability of contracts and security \nof property rights\u2014key outcomes envisioned under the PAJP\u2014will enhance investor confidence, \nthereby contributing to private sector development. \n \n4. \nProgram Clusters with Single Tranches. The framework would build on lessons learnt \nfrom  PRMP  and  take  into  account  reforms  carried  out  by  the  GoPb  over  the  past  few  years. \nFirst,  it  brings  together  public  sector,  MDG-related,  and  judicial  sector  reforms  in  integrated \nclusters  of  programs  to  ensure  fullest  coordination.  Second,  the  GoPb  and  ADB  have \nestablished a strong partnership through the implementation of the PRMP. This has laid a solid \nfoundation for a mature relationship, serving as a platform for constructive policy dialogue. The \ngovernment  has  demonstrated  strong  commitment  to  reforms.  The  policy  conditions  could \ntherefore serve more as a tool to guide reforms rather than as rigid prescriptive actions. Third, \nexperience  has  shown \nlearning  by  doing  and \nexperimentation.  The  program  cluster  approach,  comprising  a  series  of  single-tranche \noperations,  offers  a  more  productive  means  of  responding  to  changing  domestic  and  external \ncircumstances,  and  reflecting  learning  in  moving  forward  into  complex  areas  such  as  civil \nservice  reforms  and  performance-based  resource  allocation.  With  greater  focus  on  eventual \noutcomes  or  essential  intermediate  steps,  the  cluster  approach  ensures  smoother  program \nimplementation,  as  has  been  shown  in  ADB\u2019s  recent  experience  in  Indonesia  and  the \nPhilippines  and  in  the  World  Bank\u2019s  development  policy  loan  modality.  In  such  areas,  where \nreforms  need  at  least  5\u20136  years  to  take  firm  root,  prescribing  all  actions  up  front  is  neither \ndesirable nor feasible.1  \n \nGreater  Involvement  of  Stakeholders  as  well  as  ADB.  The  integrated  framework \n5. \nwould enable continuous feedback from all relevant stakeholders in Pakistan. At the same time, \nthe  single-tranche  structure  with  indicative  outcome-oriented  actions  will  enable  ADB\u2019s \nManagement and Board to provide more effective guidance on essential public sector reforms \nthat have been pursued successfully elsewhere, without adopting a rigid prescriptive stance up \nfront. \n \nB. \n\nLink with ADB\u2019s Country Strategy  \n\nthat  reforms  occur \n\nthrough  constant \n\n6. \nAs  the  largest  province  in  the  country,  the  Punjab  faces  significant  reform  as  well  as \nfinancing  needs.

As  part  of  the  conceptual  process,  the  provincial \ngovernment has identified clear financing needs for the strengthening of its civil service pension \nsystem (paras. 11 and 19 of main text). Just on the basis of funding its pension system alone, \napart  from  the  reform  needs  in  a  number  of  other  areas,  the  provincial  government  has \nrequested  ADB  to  consider  providing  reform  and  financing  support  of  about  $300  million  per \nyear  over  2007\u20132011.  The  framework  proposed  in  the  chart  is  aimed  at  conceptualizing  a \nreform agenda and financing support over a 5-year period. To begin the process, the PGEIP, in \nthe amount of $750 million, will be divided into three SPs to support reforms in the first four of \nthe six pillars identified in para. 50 of main text.  \n \nThe integrated clusters of programs would be well aligned with ADB\u2019s  country strategy \n7. \nfor  Pakistan.  The  forthcoming  Country  Partnership  Strategy  for  2007\u20132011  defines  second-\ngeneration reforms for strengthening governance and financial services as one of the strategic \npillars  of  ADB\u2019s  operations  in  Pakistan.

A rating \nof \u201cA\u201d indicates international-level practice and \u201cB\u201d good performance, while ratings of \u201cC\u201d and \n\u201cD\u201d  point  to  the  need  for  improvement.

The  overall  credibility  of  the \nbudget in the Punjab is weak with respect to realism of expenditure estimates and the capacity \nto keep track of the government\u2019s payment arrears.  \n \nThe transparency and comprehensiveness of the budget system conform to international \n4. \nstandards \nfinancial \nstatistics/classification  of  the  functions  of  the  government  standards,  and  includes  the  most \nrelevant  information  benchmarks  in  the  budget  documentation.  There  is,  however  some \ndeficiency  in  the  reporting  of  information  on  donor-financed  projects,  which,  to  date,  are  not \nreported as part of overall provincial expenditures.  \n \n5. \nThe  overall  budget  cycle  was  assessed  according  to  the  four  subcategories  of \n(i) policy-based budgeting (nos. 11\u201315); (ii) predictability and control in budget execution (nos. \n16\u201321);  (iii) accounting,  recording,  and  reporting  (nos.  22\u201325);  and  (iv)  external  scrutiny  and \naudit (nos. 26\u201328).  \n \n6. \nThe budget preparation process in the GoPb is clear with adequate timelines, while good \nprogress  has  been  made  in  introducing  budget  planning  with  a  medium-term  perspective. \nReform initiatives have also been introduced in tax administration and tax policy, though scope \nfor  improvement  still  exists  with  respect  to  the  determination  of  tax  liabilities,  taxpayers\u2019 \nregistration,  and  effective  tax  collection.  Major  areas  of  improvement  in  budget  control  and \nexecution  concern  the  effectiveness  of  payroll  controls,  the  overall  quality  of  the  procurement \nprocess  (e.g.,  use  of  open  competition  for  award  of  contracts  and  existence  of  procurement \ncomplaints  mechanism),  and  the  system  of  internal  audit,  whose  quality  is  very  poor.  Budget \naccounting  and  reporting  is  satisfactory  in  account  reconciliation,  the  reporting  of  information \nfrom line departments to central departments, and the quality of midyear budget reports. Finally, \nexternal audit is very weak in the timely submission of audit reports to the legislature, follow-up \nof audit recommendations, and legislative scrutiny over budget execution.  \n \n7. \nDonors\u2019 support practices were rated favorably with regard to the predictability of funds \nfor  budget  support,  reporting  on  project/program  disbursements,  and  procedures  for  the \nmanagement of funds, which follow national procedures.  \n \n\n \n\n\fDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION MATRIXa \nFOR RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE \n\n \n62 \n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nto \n\nby \n\ntwo \n\nfund, \n\nto  support \n\nendowment \n\nto  effectively  achieve \n\nto  Justice  Program \n\nAsian Development Bank (ADB) \n \nADB  has  provided  assistance  to  the \nGovernment of Pakistan and provincial \nresource \ngovernments \nfor  public \nreforms, \nmanagement \ndevolution, \nsocial  development, \ngender  and \nother \nand \njustice, \naccess \ngovernance  reforms.

This  support  phase  is  ongoing  and  is \nfocused  on  key  PRMP  intervention  areas\u2014public  financial  management,  civil  service  reforms,  and  private  sector \ndevelopment. Additional areas of support include reforming and building the capacity of the Bureau of Statistics (BOS) \nand  the  Punjab  Economic  Research  Institute.  An  amount  of  \u00a32  million  has  also  been  earmarked  for  the  Policy \nDevelopment  Fund,  to  be  used  in  response  to  requests  from  the  government  of  the  Punjab  as  the  assistance  unfolds \nand needs are identified. Coordination with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) TA for the PRMP is ensured through the \nexecutive and steering committees of the PRMP.  \n\nThe  Government  of  Pakistan  and  the  Government  of  the  United  Kingdom  also  signed  recently  a  10-year  partnership \nagreement, whose purpose is to afford better predictability in development assistance and better alignment on key policy \nthemes. The initial phase (until 2011) comprises a grant assistance package of \u00a3480 million, which is expected to take \neffect in April 2008. A substantial part of this assistance is meant for the province of Punjab. An initial assistance of \u00a330 \nmillion is being designed in collaboration with the Punjab to assist the 15 poorer districts in the province. The focus of \nassistance will be on alleviating poverty and improving social service delivery. On the back of the long-term partnership, \nthe DFID is now working on evolving a more focused 10-year partnership with the government of the Punjab. The details \nof the partnership are yet to be finalized. The coordination between ADB and DFID under PRMP is a key to ensuring aid \neffectiveness.  \n\nDFID Support for PRMP and PGEIP \n\nDFID is providing a parallel TA, amounting to \u00a35 million, from 2006 to 2009 to support governance and public resource \nmanagement reforms in the Punjab. The overall goal of the DFID assistance is to help the government move toward an \naccountable,  efficient,  and  effective  government  that  meets  the  needs  of  its  people.  Specifically,  the  following  outputs \nare  expected:  (i)  improved  availability  and  quality  of  data,  and  economic  and  social  research  on  the  Punjab;  (ii)  more \ntransparent  and  results-based  budget  allocations;  (iii)  public  administrative  reform,  fully  consistent  with  Punjab  Local \nGovernment  Ordinance  (PLGO)  2001,  and  cognizant  of  the  current  and  future  human  resource  needs  of  the \ngovernment;  (iv)  improved  policies  and  capacity  to  support  private  sector  development;  (v)  improved  ability  of  the \ngovernment of the Punjab to develop policy in areas complementary to the Punjab Government Efficiency Improvement \nProgram (PGEIP); and (vi) a communication strategy in place to widen ownership of pro-poor reforms. \n\nThe  TA  grant  is  allocated  as  follows:  Board  of  Statistics  and  Punjab  Economic  Research  Institute,  \u00a31.3  million;  public \nfinancial  management,  \u00a30.5  million;  private  sector  development,  \u00a30.5  million;  civil  service  reforms,  \u00a30.5  million;  and \ncommunication  strategy,  \u00a30.2  million.  In  addition,  a  Policy  Development  Support  Fund  of  \u00a32  million  can  be  used  to \nrespond  to  requests  from  the  government  for  help  in  developing  policy  in  important  areas  related  to  public  financial \nmanagement that were not covered by the previous PRMP. \n\nWhile  the  ADB  TA/program  and  the  DFID  grant  share  some  broad  common  areas,  including  public  financial \nmanagement, civil service reforms, and private sector development, the possibility of overlap and duplication is small for \na number of reasons. First, while the total DFID TA grant is \u00a35 million, the allocation to the three common areas is only \n\u00a31.5 million. Second, there are numerous issues in all the three common areas and the TA needs are large, reducing the \npossibility  of  duplication.  Third,  both  ADB  and  DFID  are  committed  to  achieving  donor  coordination  and  aid \neffectiveness. Thus, ADB and DFID will actively coordinate with each other to achieve complementarity of TA activities \nand  outputs.  For  example,  in  the  civil  service  area,  DFID\u2019s  major  area  of  assistance  will  be  in  developing  a  human \nresource management information database. Fourth and most importantly, the Planning and Development Department \n(P&DD)  is  the  executing  agency  for  both  ADB  and  the  DFID  assistance,  and  the  PRMP  program  management  unit \n(PMU)  is  the  overall  program/TA  management  unit.  The  DFID  TA  will  be  implemented  by  a  DFID-appointed  TA \nmanagement  agency  (TAMA),  which  will  work  with  the  government  of  the  Punjab.  The  PRMP  PMU  will  closely \ncoordinate  with  the  TAMA  to  ensure  that  the  synergies  between  PGEIP  and  the  DFID  TA  are  maximized.  Regular \ninteraction between ADB, DFID, and the government will be maintained to improve coordination. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n \n66 \n \n\n \n\n  \n\nDevelopment Policy Letter \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f      \n\nAppendix 6     \n\n67\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n \n68 \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f      \n\nAppendix 6     \n\n69\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n \n70 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nPOLICY MATRIX FOR THE PUNJAB GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM \n\n \nImpact: Sustained high economic growth, with lower poverty incidence and improved delivery of public services, perceptible improvements in the \ndelivery of public services, and higher and sustained economic growth, in the province of the Punjab.  \n \nOutcome:  The  government  of  Punjab  (GoPb)  becomes  more  efficient  in  the  allocation  of  scarce  resources  and  more  responsive  to  citizens\u2019 \nneeds.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\nPrincipal Objective \nA.

The P-PRSP identified (i) governance reform, (ii) strengthening of planning capability, \n(iii)  improvements  in  service  delivery,  (iv)  fiscal  and  financial  reforms,  (v) income  and \nemployment  generation,  and  (vi)  gender  mainstreaming  as  key  elements  of  effective  poverty \nreduction  in  the  Punjab.  The  Punjab  Resource  Management  Program  (PRMP)  was  aimed  at \nsupporting improvements in these areas. PRMP helped develop and operationalize the poverty-\nfocused investment strategies for six key sectors in order to implement the P-PRSP. It likewise \nsupported  revenue  mobilization,  budgeting,  and  debt  management  reforms  to  create  fiscal \nspace and improve the use of fiscal resources. This has set the stage for the second-generation \nreforms under the Punjab Government Efficiency Improvement Program (PGEIP), which seeks \nto  strengthen  the  performance  orientation  of  the  budget,  undertake  pension  reform  to  create \nadditional fiscal space for social and development expenditures, improve the responsiveness of \nthe civil service to public's needs, particularly in the delivery of pro-poor services; and promote \nprivate sector development for income generation and employment creation. \n \nLikewise,  the  PGEIP  has  strong  linkage  with  both  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \n2. \ncountry  strategy  and  the  national  poverty  reduction  strategy.  ADB\u2019s  Pakistan  country  strategy \nand  program  (CSP)  for  2002\u20132006, 1  which  was  based  on  ADB\u2019s  poverty  assessment  for \nPakistan  in  20022 and  developed  in  the  context  of  the  national  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy \nPaper  (PRSP),  emphasized  poor  governance  as  a  key  cause  of  poverty.  The  CSP  update \n2005\u20132008  further  emphasized  the  importance  of  governance  reforms.  Poor  governance  not \nonly resulted in poor public service delivery and greater vulnerability, but also led to a drop in \nbusiness confidence, which in turn resulted in lower investment levels and growth. ADB\u2019s draft \ncountry partnership strategy (CPS) for 2007\u20132011 for Pakistan maintains this focus, identifying \ngovernance and institutional bottlenecks as binding constraints on growth and poverty reduction. \nThis  is  consistent  with  the  government\u2019s  draft  second-generation  poverty  reduction  strategy, \nPRSP II, which includes effective governance and management as a key pillar. \n \nB. \n\nPoverty Analysis: Poverty and Public Resource Management in the Punjab \n\n3. \nOfficial  poverty  indicators  for  2004\u20132005  indicate  a  sharp  improvement  in  the  poverty \nsituation for Pakistan. The national poverty head-count ratio, which shows the percentage of the \npopulation  living  below  the  poverty  line  declining  by  10.6  percentage  points  from  34.46%  in \n2001\u20132002  to  23.9%  in  2004\u20132005.  In  absolute  numbers,  the  number  of  poor  persons  in \nPakistan fell from 49.23 million to 36.45 million. The changes in poverty incidence in Pakistan in \nrecent years demonstrate the importance of economic growth in poverty reduction.  \n \n4. \nLikewise, the Punjab\u2019s average annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 8% from \nfiscal year (FY) 2003 to FY2007 has contributed to the improvement in the poverty situation in \nthe Punjab. In addition, increase in social spending has also improved social conditions. From a \npoverty  head-count  ratio  of  34.1%  in  FY2002,  the  ratio  decreased  by  11  percentage  points  to \nabout  23%  in  FY2005.  It  is  estimated  that  the  ratio  has  further  declined  by  another  2.1 \npercentage points in FY2007. Gains are similarly seen in some social sectors like education and \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2002. Country Strategy and Program (2002\u20132006): Pakistan.

The  literacy  rate  improved  from  47%  in  FY2002  to  62%  in  FY2007,  while  net  primary \nenrollment  rate  rose  from  45%  to  70%  during  the  same  period.  Infant  mortality  rate  per  1,000 \nlive births declined from 82 in FY2002 to 72 in FY2007, while child mortality rate per 1,000 live \nbirths3 decreased from 119 to 105. The percentage of children between 12 and 23 months that \nhave been fully immunized increased from 57% to 76% from FY2002 to FY2007. There has also \nbeen improvement in maternal health care during the same period, with maternal mortality ratio \nper 100,000 live births dropping from 350 to 257. In spite of these gains, however, the poverty \nlevel  still  exceeds  20%  and  social  indicators  lag  behind  those  of  comparable  low-income \ncountries. For instance, Mongolia and Viet Nam, which have slightly lower per capita incomes4 \nthan the Punjab,5 have higher net primary enrollment rates, at 82.4% (for Mongolia) and 94.3% \n(for Viet Nam). In terms of health indicators, child and infant mortality rates for these countries \nare at least half of those in the Punjab. Bangladesh, which has a significantly lower per capita \nincome6 than  the  Punjab,  has  a  higher  net  primary  enrollment  rate  and  lower  child  and  infant \nmortality  rates.  Thus,  reducing  poverty  and  improving  social  and  living  conditions  remain  key \ntasks for the GoPb.7 \n \nThe  increase  in  investment  in  the  social  sectors  in  recent  years  is  encouraging.  The \n5. \nWorld  Bank\u2019s  Punjab  Education  Sector  Reform  Program  focuses  on  pro-poor  initiatives, \nincluding  the  provision  of  free  textbooks  and  stipends  to  girl  students  as  part  of  efforts  to \nincrease  enrollment  and  retention  in  poor  districts.  Interventions  under  the  Decentralization \nSupport  Program8 and  the  Punjab  Devolved  Social  Services  Program  (PDSSP)9 are  building \ncapacity  at  provincial  and  local  government  levels  for  efficient  and  effective  pro-poor  service \ndelivery with better monitoring, evaluation, and gender sensitivity.  \n \nPRMP  has  contributed  to  poverty  reduction  in  Punjab.  Subprogram  1  focused  on  the \n6. \ndevelopment of poverty-focused investment strategies for key social sectors, and subprogram 2 \npushed for the approval and operationalization of these strategies. Subprogram 1 helped reduce \nthe  high  debt  service  burden  through  early  retirement  of  cash  development  loans,  and  initial \nrestructuring of provincial taxes has resulted in an increase in revenues. Likewise, subsidies not \nexplicitly  targeting  the  poor  were  phased  out.  This  has  created  additional  fiscal  space  to \naccommodate  more  PRSP-related  expenditures.  Subprogram  2  focused  largely  on  improving \npublic service delivery and accelerating growth through private sector development. The GoPb \nhas implemented the medium-term budget framework (MTBF) and has taken steps to introduce \ntimely,  reliable,  and  publicly  accessible  public  accounts.  It  has  also  introduced  measures  to \nsupport sustained private sector development. The continuity of reforms in underlying systems \nand processes to manage public resources is crucial if the incidence of poverty in Punjab is to \nbe further reduced.  \n \n7. \nThe  PGEIP  envisages  further  improvement  in  the  delivery  of  pro-poor  social  services. \nThe  implementation  of  the  medium-term  expenditure  framework  (MTEF)  enhances  the \nperformance orientation of the budget, and improves its pro-poor focus. Efforts are also being \ntaken to strengthen linkages between the budget and service delivery in key social sectors such \n                                                 \n3   Children below 5 years old. \n4   Per capita gross national income in 2005 was $690 for Mongolia and $620 for Viet Nam. \n5   The Punjab had per capita GDP of about $747 in FY2004\u20132005. \n6   Per capita gross national income for Bangladesh in 2005 was $470. \n7   Information on GDP growth, poverty and social sectors is  taken from Elahi, Pervaiz Ch.

The  PGEIP  also  addresses  the  fiscal  squeeze  arising  from  pension  liabilities  by \nmaking them off-budget and creating viable pension and general provident funds. This creates \nadditional resources for pro-poor expenditures. Civil service reform is being pursued to improve \nresponsiveness, effectiveness, and efficiency toward better public service. Lastly, encouraging \npublic-private partnerships expands the resources available for pro-poor services in the Punjab. \n \nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\n1. \n\nStakeholder Analysis  \n\n8. \nThe  design  of  the  PGEIP  incorporates  the  results  of  stakeholder  consultations  at  all \nlevels  of  government  and  civil  society.  Further,  it  incorporates  lessons  learned  during  the \nconsultative process for the preparation and implementation of the two PRMP subprograms, the \nDecentralization Support Program, and the PDSSP.  \n \n9. \nThe consensus-building strategy for the PGEIP is in line with that used for PRMP, which \nwas the result of policy dialogue that began in 2002, with the ADB technical assistance (TA).10 \nThe  PGEIP  entails  a  continuous  policy  dialogue  until  2010  and  possibly  beyond,  with  all  key \nstakeholders,  including  politicians,  civil  servants,  civil  society  organizations,  the  academic \ncommunity, media, private sector representatives, and other development partners. In addition, \nthe  cluster  approach,  with  regular  dialogue,  will  continue  to  ensure  that  the  reforms,  despite \nbeing demanding, stay broadly on track. \n \n10. \nThe PGEIP will continue to support for the Punjab Development Forum (PDF), which is a \nwell-established and regular event that brings all stakeholders together to (i) study and evaluate \ndevelopment progress in Punjab, (ii) discuss key challenges, and (iii) provide guidance on how \nto address the development challenges.11  \n \n\n2. \n\nParticipation Strategy \n\n11. \nThe  GoPb  has  adopted  a  participatory  approach  in  designing  and  implementing  its \npoverty  reduction  programs,  starting  with  wide-ranging  consultations  with  stakeholders  in  the \nformulation  of  the  P-PRSP.  The  government\u2019s  commitment  to  participation  continues  with  its \nongoing  reform  effort,  which  emphasizes  consultation  through  initiatives  such  as  the  PDF. \nUnder subprograms 1 and 2 of PRMP, consultations were a regular feature, including the MTBF \nForum  in  October  2004.  The  PGEIP  further  strengthens  the  systems  and  procedures  in  the \npublic  sector  to  promote  accessibility,  accountability,  transparency,  and  fiscal  discipline  by \ndeveloping and implementing the MTEF. It also encourages broader participation of the private \nsector in the Punjab\u2019s economic activity and fosters public-private partnerships. As participatory \napproaches  gain  ground  in  government  processes,  it  is  imperative  to  follow  through  with  the \ninstitutionalization of broader stakeholder participation with the support of the political leadership \nand bureaucracy.  \n \n12. \nOn the basis of the experience with PRMP and recommendations of evaluation studies \nof  other  policy-based  lending  programs,  the  PGEIP  will  continue  to  convene  the  PDF  and  to \nconduct  other  participatory  processes,  engaging  stakeholders  at  federal,  provincial,  and  local \nlevels. During the program preparation, the PGEIP benefited from workshops in the formulation \n\n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2002.

It  will  continue  to  provide  the  venue  for \naddressing various  stakeholders\u2019  concerns  related  to  its  reform  program.  The  PGEIP  receives \noversight and guidance through a high-level steering committee, which includes representatives \nof civil society and the private sector. As the reform process under the PGEIP deepens, the role \nof  the  steering  committee  will  become  central  to  its  success.  More  vigorous  and  regular \ndirection from the steering committee will be required under the PGEIP.  \n \nD. \n\nSocial Issues \n\n13. \nThe P-PRSP emphasized the need to establish a system for monitoring and evaluating \nsocial and economic conditions. It identified key indicators, baselines, and targets, and clearly \ndefined  the  responsibility  for  the  collection  of  data  related  to  each  indicator.  The  ADB  TA \nprojects  Local  Government  Performance  Enhancement 12  and  Gender  and  Governance \nMainstreaming 13  also  established  baselines  and  targets  for  gender,  access,  equity,  and \nsustainability.  In  addition,  the  TA  project  Enhancing  Capacity  for  Poverty  Reduction  and \nResource Management in Punjab14 promoted poverty-focused development planning, including \nthe  engagement  of  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  specialist,  who  worked  with  the  GoPb  to \ndevelop  key  performance  indicators  for  monitoring  progress  against  social  sector  targets.  The \nwork  on  monitoring  and  evaluation  done  under  the  previous  TA  and  DSSP  is  encouraging. \nUnder subprogram 2, the Planning and Development Department (P&DD) has strengthened its \nmonitoring  procedures  for  tracking  expenditures  and  outcomes  of  the  annual  development \nprogram and for implementing poverty-focused investment strategies. The PGEIP complements \nthis  by  infusing  greater  transparency,  accountability,  and  performance  orientation  in  public \nexpenditures  through  MTEF  and  adopting  service  delivery  standards.  The  GoPb  will  also \ninstitute mechanisms for tracking expenditure performance under the PGEIP. \n \n\n1. \n\nGender \n\nAlthough  education  indicators  generally  improved  from  2001\u20132002  to  2004\u20132005, \n14. \nstatistics  from  the  2004\u20132005  Pakistan  Social  and  Living  Standards  Measurement  Survey \nindicate  the  continued  wide  gender  disparities  in  access  to  education  in  the  Punjab.  For \ninstance,  the  literacy  rate  for  females  in  the  province  was  21%  lower  than  that  for  males  in \nFY2005.  Large  disparities  likewise  persist  across  the  urban  and  rural  sectors,  and  tend  to  be \nhigher in rural areas. There also remains a wide gap in employment opportunities. The 2005\u2013\n2006 Labor Force Survey shows the persistence of the low labor force participation rate among \nwomen in the Punjab, at 17.9% compared with 51.6% for males. \n \n15. \nA preliminary gender review of federal, provincial, and district public sector expenditure \nand  its  management  suggests  a  critical  need  for  cross-sector  and  comprehensive  gender \nanalysis,  planning,  budgeting,  auditing,  and  monitoring  systems,  and  a  methodology  and \nmechanisms  to  ensure  gender-balanced  resource  distribution  at  all  three  levels.  Fulfilling \ncommitments on mainstreaming gender is one of the key objectives of PRMP. The approval and \nimplementation  of  the  provincial  gender  reform  action  plan  (GRAP)  was  achieved  under \nsubprogram  1.  A  PRs612  million  GRAP  Planning  Commission  pro-forma  I  (PC-I)  with  the \nobjective of mainstreaming gender at all levels of the government was approved by the GoPb. \n\n                                                 \n12 Technical assistance loan approved under ADB. 2002.

Manila. \n\n\f \n\n98 \n \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n \n\nUnder subprogram 2, the GoPb established the Change Management Unit (CMU), which will be \nresponsible for ensuring that gender considerations are taken into account in reform programs. \nRecently  the  CMU  was  upgraded  to  the  Public  Policy  and  Change  Management  Wing \n(PPCMW).  The  PGEIP  will  further  strengthen  change  management  by  introducing  change \nmanagement agents in core departments and district governments. \n \n\n2. \n\nAccess \n\nThe reforms proposed under the PGEIP are designed to further improve access to social \n16. \nservices,  particularly  in  the  health  sector,  by  strengthening  the  linkage  between  the  budget \nprocess  and  service  delivery.  Implementation  of  MTEF  will  encourage  performance-based \nbudgets, which means better public access to services, and will enhance the pro-poor focus of \npublic expenditures. An improved civil service will likewise be more responsive to the needs of \nthe  general  public,  including  the  poor  and  marginalized  sectors.  It  will  also  result  in  improved \ngovernance, which will lower transaction costs as rent-seeking behavior and graft are reduced. \nThe  resulting  lower  transaction  costs  will  benefit  the  poor  and  the  non-poor  alike,  improving \naccess  for  all.  Not  only  will  pension  reforms  result  in  a  well-functioning  pension  system,  it  will \nprovide access to much-needed financial security over the long term, as well as fiscal space for \npro-poor expenditures as the share of pension servicing in the budget declines over time. \n \n\n3. \n\nEquity \n\n17. \nThe PGEIP will promote greater equity in the Punjab. Performance orientation and fiscal \ndiscipline infused by MTEF as well as the adoption of service delivery standards will ensure that \nimproved service delivery benefits the poor. Likewise, better and more efficient public resource \nmanagement  will  create  additional  fiscal  space  for  pro-poor  expenditures.  Within  the  public \nservice, civil service reforms will incorporate equity considerations through merit-based human \nresources management. \n \n\n4. \n\nSustainability \n\n18. \nADB  will  continue  to  support  measures  to  improve  effective  resource  management \n(which  was  identified  as  the  basis  for  poverty  reduction  in  the  P-PRSP).  PRMP  has  already \nhelped  bring  about  significant  reforms  in  development  planning  and  resource  management \nsystems.  The  PGEIP  will  undertake  the  second-generation  reforms  needed  to  sustain  and \nfurther improve these efforts. \n \n19. \nUnder  the  PRMP,  the  GoPb  started  important  reforms,  including  the  preparation  of \nMTBF  and  MTDF,  tax  reforms,  procurement  reforms,  improvements  in  the  planning  and \napproval  process  for  development  projects,  and  the  approval  of  a  new  industrial  policy  that \naddresses many of the concerns of the private sector. To ensure the sustainability of the reform \nprocess,  the  PGEIP  reinforces  previous  reforms  with  civil  service  reform  and  performance-\nbased  budgeting.  Also,  a  strengthened  and  financially  viable  pension  system  will  remove \npension liabilities from the budget, thereby creating more fiscal space for other social services. \nIn  addition,  the  focus  of  the  PGEIP  on  creating  an  environment  conducive  to  private  sector \nactivities opens the door to partnerships forged with the private sector to pursue reforms. Finally, \nthe  PGEIP  will  continue  to  support  the  GoPb  in  implementing  the  essentially  home-grown \nreform  agenda  that  was  begun  under  PRMP.  The  GoPb\u2019s  strong  sense  of  ownership  of  the \nreform  process  reinforces  the  prospects  for  the  long-term  sustainability  of  the  achievements \nunder the PGEIP. \n\n \n\n\f                                           Appendix 13            99                   \n\nTable A13: Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n Poverty Analysis  \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\nA. \n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Pakistan \nPublic  resource  management  deals  with  processes  and  governance  mechanisms  for  mobilization  of  revenue  and \nallocation for development purposes. Effective public resource management will increase revenues, improve allocation \nefficiency of public expenditures toward high socioeconomic returns, enhance sustainability of and access by the poor \nto public services, including for basic social services and infrastructure, and promote private sector development and \nemployment  generation.  Governance  reforms,  including  public  resource  management,  are  a  central  element  in  the \ncountry poverty analysis. Second generation reforms under the PGEIP will strengthen the performance orientation of \nthe budget, free up resources for PRSP-related expenditures, and improve the responsiveness of the civil service to \npublic\u2019s need, particularly in delivery of pro-poor services. \n \n \nB. \nPunjab\u2019s  GDP  annual  growth  of  8%  from  FY2003  to  FY2007  has  contributed  to  the  improvement  in  the  poverty \nsituation in Punjab. In addition, increase social spending  has also improved social conditions. From a poverty head-\ncount ratio of 34.1% in FY2002, this decreased by 11 percentage points in FY2005. This is estimated to have further \ndeclined by another 2.1 percentage points in FY2007. Gains are likewise seen in some social sectors like education \nand health. The literacy rate improved from 47% in FY2002 to 62% in FY2007 while net primary enrolment rate rose \nfrom 45% to 70% during the same period. Infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births declined from 82 in FY2002 to 72 in \nFY2007  while  child  mortality  rate  per  1,000  live  birthsa  decreased  from  119  to  105.  The  percentage  of  children \nbetween  12  and  23  months  that  have  been  fully  immunized  increased  from  57%  to  76%  from  FY2002  to  FY2007. \nThere has likewise been improvement in maternal health care during the same period with maternal mortality ratio per \n100,000  live  births  dropping  from  350  to  257.  In  spite  of  these  gains,  poverty  level  still  exceeds  20%  and  social \nindicators lag behind that of other comparable low income countries. Thus, reducing poverty and improving social and \nliving conditions remain key tasks for the GoPb.b \n \nPRMP is a central element of the Punjab PRSP to reduce the incidence of poverty in Punjab. Subprogram 1 focused \non the development of poverty-focused investment strategies for key social sectors, and Subprogram 2 pushed for the \napproval  and  operationalization  of  these  strategies.  Subprogram  1  helped  to  reduce  the  high  debt  service  burden \nthrough  early  retirement  of  cash  development  loans  and  initial  restructuring  of  provincial  taxes  has  resulted  in  an \nincrease in revenues. Likewise, subsidies not explicitly targeting the poor were phased out. This has created additional \nfiscal  space  to  accommodate  more  PRSP-related  expenditures.  Subprogram  2  focused  largely  on  improving  public \nservice delivery and accelerating growth through private sector development. The GoPb has implemented the MTBF \nand  introduced  timely,  reliable  and  publicly  accessible  public  accounts.  It  has  also  introduced  measures  to  support \nsustained  private  sector  development.  The  continuity  of  reforms  in  underlying  systems  and  processes  to  manage \npublic resources is crucial if the incidence of poverty in Punjab is to be further reduced.  \n \nThe PGEIP continues to support the three components of the ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy: pro-poor sustainable \neconomic  growth,  good  governance,  and  social  development.  The  PGEIP  envisages  the  further  improvement  in  the \ndelivery  of  pro-poor  social  services.  The  implementation  of  the  MTEF  enhances  the  performance  orientation  of  the \nbudget, and improves its pro-poor focus. Efforts are also taken to strengthen linkages between the budget and service \ndelivery  in  key  social  sectors  such  as  health.  The  PGEIP  also  addresses  the  fiscal  squeeze  arising  from  pension \nliabilities by making them off-budget and creating viable pension and general provident funds. This creates additional \nfiscal  space  for  pro-poor  expenditures.  Civil  service  reform  is  pursued  to  improve  the  responsiveness  of  the  latter \ntowards the needs of the public. Lastly, encouraging public-private partnerships expands the resources available for \npro-poor services in Punjab. \n \na  Children below 5 years old. \nb  Information on GDP growth, poverty and social sectors are taken from Elahi, Pervaiz Ch.
