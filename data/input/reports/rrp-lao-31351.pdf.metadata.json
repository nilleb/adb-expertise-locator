It is designed to promote \nagricultural commercialization2 through extension and training and \nto  support  the  growth  of  value-added  enterprises  by  improving \naccess  to  information  and  markets  and  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment  for  investments  in  agribusinesses.  The  Project  will \nand \naddress \ncompetitiveness  of  the  agriculture  sector  that  impact  on  the \nincome  of  small  farmers  and  economic  growth  of  the  Lao  PDR, \nincluding  providing  for  strategic  road  linkages  to  the  East-West \nand  North-South  corridors,  where  commerce  and  trade  are \nbeginning  to  develop.  The  Project  will  help  to  improve  the  living \nstandards  of \nin  selected  districts  of \nSavannakhet,  Champassak,  Khammouan,  and  Vientiane  by \nreinforcing  recent  gains  from  increased  rice  production  and \npromoting  commercial  agricultural  growth. \nthe \ndecentralization strategy of the Government, provincial and district \nadministrations will be used in implementation of the Project.  \n \nAgriculture is the Lao PDR's dominant sector, accounting for half \nof  gross  domestic  product  and  more  than  85%  of  employment. \nOver  85%  of  people  in  the  country  live  in  rural  areas,  making  a \nliving largely by subsistence cultivation of rice. Fifty-three percent \nof  the  rural  population  live  in  poverty.  The  incidence  of  poverty, \nwhich  is  closely  linked  to  agricultural  performance,  can  be \nreduced  by  moving  farmers  beyond  subsistence  farming  to  more \ndiversified and commercial agricultural production of a number of \ncash  crops  with  ready  markets  in  neighboring  countries.  The \nirrigated floodplain of the Mekong produces most of the country\u2019s \nmarketable  surplus  of  rice  and  other  crops  and  offers  the \nstrongest potential at present for commercialization of agriculture. \nHowever, even in these areas, rice productivity is below that of its \nneighbors,  and  the  productivity  and  quality  of  nonrice  crops \nremain  low  because  of  limited  information  on  markets,  low \ntechnical  expertise,  restricted  access  to  markets  for  inputs  and \nproducts,  unavailability  of  credit,  low  domestic  demand,  and a \n \n \n                                                 \n1   To be classified as a poverty intervention, incomes of at least 39% of project beneficiaries\u2014the percentage of poor \nin the country\u2014should be below the national poverty line. Under the Project, only about 31% of project clients are \nconsidered poor.  \n\nline  with \n\nIn \n\n2  Agricultural commercialization includes smallholder cash crop production, diversification, and marketing. \n\n\f \n\n \nObjectives and Scope \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n \n\niii \n\nlarge \n\nthrough \n\ndearth of value-adding enterprises.  As well, the extension system \nhas  been \nlargely  dysfunctional  because  of  severe  budget \nconstraints,  poor  organization  and  staffing,  and  a  policy \nenvironment  not  conducive  to  supporting  the  efficient  functioning \nof input and product markets. By providing relatively simple inputs, \na \ntraining, \nimpact  can  be  achieved  mainly \nawareness raising, and application of appropriate policies. \n \nThe purpose of the Project is to promote commercial smallholder \nagriculture  and  associated  agribusiness,  with \nthe  overall \nobjectives  of  achieving  sustained  increases  in  rural  incomes  and \nlong-term reductions in rural poverty. Specific objectives are to (i) \nachieve increased production and marketing of diversified, nonrice \ndry-season  cash  crops,  livestock,  and  fisheries;  (ii)  improve \nsmallholder  access  to  domestic  and  international  markets  and \nmarket  information;  and  (iii)  increase  investment  in  value-adding \nagribusiness.  \n \nTo  achieve  these  objectives,  the  Project  has  four  components: \n(i) farmer  support  services \ntechnical \nto \nknowledge  of  integrated  farming  systems,  and  access  to  market \ninformation  and \nto \nstimulate  investment  in  agribusinesses;  (iii)  rural  infrastructure  to \nimprove  physical  access \nto  produce  markets  and  reduce \nmarketing costs; and (iv) project management. \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  over  6  years  is  estimated  at  $15.2 \nmillion  equivalent,  including  physical  and  price  contingencies, \ninterest  during  construction,  taxes,  and  duties.  Of  the  total  cost, \n$6.5  million  or  43%  is  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $8.7  million \nequivalent or 57% is local currency cost. \n\ninputs;  (ii)  agribusiness  and  marketing \n\nfarmers\u2019 \n\nimprove \n\nSource \n\n \n\nADB \nGovernment \n     Total \n \n\nForeign \nExchange\n \n6.5 \n0.0 \n6.5 \n\nLocal \nCurrency\n \n5.5 \n3.2 \n8.7 \n\nTotal \nCost \n \n12.0 \n 3.2 \n15.2 \n\n($ million)\nPercent \n\n \n78% \n22% \n100% \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  of  Special  Drawing  Rights  9.092  million  ($12.0  million \nequivalent) will be made from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nSpecial Funds resources and will have a term of 32 years, including \na grace period of 8 years.

It will meet twice a year. The provincial governments will \nestablish  provincial  project  offices  (PPOs)  to  implement  and \ncoordinate  project  activities  to  be  undertaken  by  the  respective \nprovincial departments. \n \nEach  provincial  governor  will  designate  a  provincial  project \ncoordinator to head the PPO. A provincial steering committee will \nbe  established  in  each  province,  chaired  by  the  vice  governor. \nThe provincial agriculture and forestry services will implement the \nthe  provincial \nfarmer  support  services  component,  while \ndepartment  of  construction,  transport,  post,  and  communication \nwill  implement  the  rural  infrastructure  component  involving  road \nconstruction  and  rehabilitation,  and  primary  market  construction. \nThe  provincial  department  of  commerce  and  department  of \nindustry  and  handicrafts  will  implement  the  agribusiness  and \nmarketing component. \n \nGoods and services to be financed from the proceeds of the ADB \nloan  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement.

The  consultants  will  be \nselected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to \nADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants.  For  consulting  services \nrelated  to  labor-based  machine-assisted  construction  technology, \na contract will be negotiated directly with ILO, which has extensive \nexperience  in  this  technical  area  and  has  been  providing \nassistance  to  similar  projects  throughout  the  Mekong  region  for \nseveral years.  \n \nTechnical  assistance  (TA)  of  $250,000  will  be  provided  for \nagribusiness  and  training  to  help  the  NPD  identify  viable  and \ncreditworthy  investments  and  provide  training  to  investors  in \nmarket analysis, business plan preparation, feasibility studies, and \nloan applications from commercial banks. The TA will also provide \nin \ninvestors \ntraining  of  potential  agribusiness \nsupport \nagrobusiness  processing, \nto  selected \ntours \nagribusinesses  in  ASEAN  countries.  Ten  person-months  of \nconsultant  services \ntraining \nconsultant will be provided, and 30 agribusiness investors will be \ntrained.  The  consultants  under  the  TA  are  to  be  engaged  in \naccordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  the  ADB  with  respect  to \nthe use of domestic consultants. \n \nThe Project has an estimated base case economic internal rate of \nreturn  (EIRR)  of  20%.  About  40,000  smallholder  households, \nprimarily  farmers,  living  in  the  Mekong  floodplains  will  benefit \ndirectly  from  the  Project.  The  bulk  of  project  benefits  will  come \nfrom \nfield  and \nvegetable  crops,  reduced  postharvest  losses,  reduced  marketing \ncosts,  reductions  in  transport  costs,  as  well  as  nonproject  farmer \nadoption  of \nimproved  practices  and  high-yielding  crops. \nNonquantified  benefits  include  those  from  livestock  and  fisheries \ndemonstrations,  greater  levels  of  smallholder  technical  and \nbusiness  skills,  greater  levels  of  agribusiness  activities,  and \nimproved social cohesion. The Project is relatively robust \u2013 a 20% \nincrease  in  cost  results  in  a  decline  of  project  EIRR  to  17.0%\u2014\nand  risk-free\u2014the  probability  of  the  actual  EIRR  being  less  than \nthe  opportunity  cost  of  capital  is  low.  The  estimated  financial \ninternal  rate  of  return  is  about  18%.  The  proposed  project \ninterventions are financially viable and sufficiently attractive at the \nfarm level to encourage smallholder participation. \n \nThe  methodologies  for  participatory  extension  under  the  farmer \nsupport  services  component  piloted  under  the  Pilot  Extension \nProject  and  the  proposed  labor-intensive  technology,  developed \nby  ILO  under  the  rural  infrastructure  component  have  been  field \ntested   and   proven   in   the   Lao PDR.   The   success   of    the\n \n\nincremental  production  of  rice,  dry  season \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n \n\nagribusiness  and  marketing  component  will  depend  on \nimprovements  in  the  business-enabling  environment  and  the \nability  to  mobilize  agribusiness  investments.  Implementation  of  a \nsupportive  enabling  environment  will  be  the  subject  of  specific \nassurances and loan covenants, and will be monitored closely. It \nis expected that substantial benefits will accrue to project farmers \nand the country with the implementation of these components. \n \nAlthough  the  Government  has  assured  ADB  that  the  Agricultural \nPromotion Bank (APB) will provide financial services to the project \nparticipants, the ongoing reforms of APB and the financial sector \npromoted  by  ADB  and  other  aid  agencies  may  constrain  lending \nby  APB  and  other  banks.  Lack  of  financial  services  and  credit  to \nundertake \nagro-based \nenterprises  arising  from  developments  under  the  Project  pose  a \nrisk to its overall success. \n \nUncertainties  relating  to  the  legal  and  policy  framework  for \nbusinesses  will  be  mitigated  by  encouraging  businesses  and  the \nGovernment  to  consult  each  other  in  a  forum  to  be  created  and \nsupported  by  the  Project  and  TA  and  for  the  Government  to \nrespond speedily to justified complaints. \n \n\nincome-generating \n\nactivities \n\nand \n\n\fvii \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the Smallholder Development Project. \nThe report also describes technical assistance (TA) for Agribusiness Support and Training, and \nif  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the \nBoard, will approve this TA grant. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nThe  Government\u2019s  development  goal  is  to  reduce  poverty  by  half  by  2005  and  for  the \n2. \nLao  PDR  to  graduate  from  the  status  of  least  developed  country  by  2020.  The  Government \ntargets broad-based economic growth of 6\u20137% per annum over the next 5 years. The strategic \napproach  is  to  reduce  poverty  through  human  and  rural  development,  and  people\u2019s \nparticipation,  focusing  on  (i)  agriculture  and  forestry,  (ii)  education,  (iii)  health,  and  (iv)  road \ninfrastructure.  To  achieve  its  ambitious  objectives  with  limited  financial  and  human  resources, \nthe  Government  will  need  to  accelerate  economic  development  through  private  sector  or \nprivate-public  initiatives,  which  will  in  turn  contribute  significantly  to  its  poverty  reduction \nprogram.  Following  the  admission  of  the  Lao  PDR  to  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian \nNations (ASEAN), considerable potential to exploit export markets has been created. This would \nimprove  with  the  scheduled  2005  implementation  of  the  ASEAN  Free  Trade  Area  (AFTA)  and \nentry into the World Trade Organization. As well, the development of the East-West Corridor of \nthe  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)\u2014comprising  the  central  provinces  of  central  Myanmar, \nnortheastern and northwestern Thailand, lower Lao PDR, and central Viet Nam\u2014represents an \narea of very high potential for the development of agroindustries, from which the Lao PDR can \npotentially benefit.  \n \n \n \n3. \nAgriculture  is  the  Lao  PDR's  dominant  sector,  accounting  for  half  of  gross  domestic \nproduct and more than 85% of employment. About 95% of the rural population is dependent on \nagricultural production, mainly rice, for a living. The majority of Lao farmers practice subsistence \nagriculture, and poverty is widespread. While the national poverty rate is 39%, the rate in rural \nareas  is  44%,  with  the  rural  poor  making  up  87%  of  the  total  poor.3  Rice  is  cultivated  by  over \n80%  of  the  population,  mainly  for  their  own  food  use.  Rice  yields  are  still  low  by  Asian \nstandards; national average yields are within the relatively low range of 1.5\u20133.0 tons per hectare \n(ha) compared with 6\u20137 tons/ha in other countries. See Appendix 1 for the sector analysis. \n \nThe irrigated areas on the floodplains of the Mekong and its tributaries produce most of \n4. \nthe country\u2019s marketable surplus of rice and other crops. About one fourth of households in this \nregion  grow  maize,  and  about  a  third  grow  some  vegetable  crops,  either  in  irrigated  fields, \nkitchen  gardens,  or  along  riverbanks.  Commonly  grown  vegetables  include  chili,  cabbage, \ncucumber,  eggplant,  and  onion.  Other  nonrice  crops  include  sugar  cane,  peanut,  tobacco, \nsesame, and fruit trees (most notably mango and tamarind). Although most households depend \n\nAgriculture  \n\n1. \n\n                                                 \n3  1997/98  Lao  Expenditure  and  Consumption  Survey  (LECS  2).  The  Government  has  defined  poverty,  by  Prime \nMinister decree No. 10/PMM dated March 2002, such that poor households have a monthly per capita expenditure \nof less than KN85,000 based on 2001 prices. \n\n\f2 \n\non  sources  other  than  rice  for  their  income,  commercial  agricultural  diversification  in  the  Lao \nPDR has still not fully taken root.  \n \n5. \nWhile,  in  1990,  rice  production  was  1.3  million  tons,  with  the  help  of  considerable \ninvestment  in  minor  irrigation  in  recent  years  and  improvement  in  rice  production  technology \nwith  the  assistance  of  the  International  Rice  Research  Institute  (IRRI),  this  increased  by  50% \nduring  the  1990s  and  reached  2.3  million  tons  in  2001;  but  production  remains  below  its \npotential. While remote and mountainous areas still face seasonal food shortages, the country \nas a whole has achieved self-sufficiency in rice. With two of the country\u2019s neighbors, Viet Nam \nand Thailand, being dominant low-cost rice producers in the international market, the Lao PDR\u2019s \ncompetitive  advantage  lies  in  nonrice  niche  markets.  However,  nonrice  crop  production  and \nquality remain low even in the most highly productive agricultural areas. \n \n\n2. \n\nAgricultural Extension and Marketing \n\n \n6. \nSince the revolution in 1975, public sector extension in the Lao PDR has been vertically \nstructured  from  the  central  to  the  district  levels.  At  the  top,  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and \nForestry (MAF) is organized by line departments (e.g., irrigation, forestry, crops, and livestock). \nIn each of the 18 provinces and 139 districts, the central structure is mirrored in the provincial \nagriculture  and  forestry  services  (PAFSs)  and  the  district  agriculture  and  forestry  offices \n(DAFOs), respectively. This structure has been in place for some 26 years. Although the PAFSs \nand  DAFOs  employ  collectively  some  6,000  persons,  lack  of  staff  capacity  and  operating \nbudgets  have  severely  constrained  their  functions,  rendering  them  dysfunctional.  The  main \nfunctions of DAFOs, in the past, have been to collect production data, regulate activities related \nto  land  and  forest  allocations  and  issue  permits,  and  organize  village  labor  for  basic \ninfrastructure construction. Very limited technical assistance to farmers has been provided, and \nvery little has been aimed at assisting farmers improve their productivity. \n \nHowever,  since  the  mid-1990s,  several  initiatives  by  aid  agencies  have  demonstrated \n7. \nviable  models  for  strengthening  extension  in  the  Lao  PDR.  With  assistance  under  ADB  TA \n1745-LAO  and  TA  2333-LAO  (Institutional  Development  and  Strengthening  of  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture and Forestry) in 1993, and several donors, a national strategy for extension through \nfarming  systems  extension  workers  (FSEW)  was  developed.  This  concept  was  pilot  tested  in \nfour districts between 1994 and 1997 under the Pilot Extension Project (PEP), financed by the \nSwiss  Agency  for  Development  and  Cooperation  (SDC)  through  the  Novartis  Foundation.  The \nconcept of FSEW departed from the traditional assignment of staff at the district level to focus \non  a  generalist  farming  systems  approach  in  assigned  groups  of  villages.  The  approach  to \nextension  built  around  the  National  Agricultural  and  Forestry  Extension  Service  (NAFES) \nunderpinning  the  human  resource  development  component  of  the  Government\u2019s  Strategic \nVision  for  the  Agricultural  Sector  was  presented  to  the  international  aid  community  in \nNovember 1999. \n \n8. \nThe  Lao  marketing  chain  for  agricultural  produce  is  underdeveloped,  with  significant \ngaps in critical areas such as inadequacy of primary markets, inadequate business support, and \nabsence  of  business  commodity  traders  except  for  rice  and  livestock.  There  are  also \nconstrained  and  inadequate  mechanisms  for  efficient  cross-border  trading.  Despite  the  setting \nup  of  AFTA  to  facilitate  the  free  movement  of  goods  and  services,  compliance  with  AFTA  is \ninadequate or non-existent in many areas. \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\n3. \n\nRural Financial Institutions \n\n \n \n9. \nThe  Lao  financial  sector  currently  comprises  the  specialized  state-owned  Agricultural \nPromotion  Bank  (APB),  three  state-owned  commercial  banks  (SOCBs),4  three  joint  venture \nbanks  (JVBs),5  and  eight  foreign  commercial  banks  (FCBs).6  APB  is  the  only  significant \ninstitutional  source  of  rural  finance  at  present.  APB  reaches  rural  households  mainly  through \ncredit groups and has reportedly established 20,000 such groups with an average membership \nof seven families per group. APB operates three branches in Louang Phrabang, Savannakhet, \nand Champassak; 47 service units in rural areas; and six subservice units in Vientiane Province. \nThe SOCBs have branches in several provinces, while the JVBs and FCBs have no branches \nand hence no provincial outreach other than in the area around Vientiane Municipality. \n \nAs  of  31  December  2001,  outstanding  loans  for  agriculture  in  all  banks  totaled  the \n10. \nequivalent of about $30 million, of which $9 million was outstanding from the SOCBs, about $20 \nmillion from APB, and the rest from the JVBs and FCBs. APB is the premier agricultural finance \ninstitution, whose portfolio is predominantly in agriculture and agribusiness. At the end of 2001, \nAPB  had  total  assets  of  $29  million  equivalent  (KN277  billion),  of  which  cash  and  deposits \ncomprised  $3.9  million  (KN37  billion),  outstanding  loans  $20  million  (KN190  billion),  and  fixed \nand other assets totaled $5.3 million (KN50 billion). Outstanding loans comprised about $11.6 \nmillion  (KN110  billion)  in  short-term  lending  for  production  and  $8.4  million  (KN80  billion)  in \nmedium-  and  long-term  loans.  APB\u2019s  liabilities  comprised  $11.6  million  (KN91  billion)  in \ndemand, savings, and short-term fixed deposits, $1 million (KN10 billion) in 2-year certificates of \ndeposit (which is earmarked for policy lending), about $4.9 million (KN47 billion) in multilateral \ndevelopment  institution  credit  lines,7  $6.3  million  or  20%  (KN60  billion)  in  capital,  and  $5.2 \nmillion (KN50 billion) in other liabilities. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nProblem Analysis8 \n\n11. \nAgriculture  Sector  Issues.  Rice  is  the  dominant  crop,  occupying  68%  of  the  total \ncultivated  area  (of  1.8  million  ha,  according  to  satellite  imagery).  Other  annual  crops  and \npermanent crops account for only 9% and 8%, respectively, highlighting the predominant role of \nrice and of subsistence farming in the Lao PDR agricultural economy. Agricultural productivity is \nlow due to inefficient practices, low input use, and low farm mechanization. This is primarily due \nto  the  predominance  of  subsistence-oriented  rice  production  whereby  farmers  adopt  low  input \nmethods  to  meet  subsistence  needs  at  minimal  cost.  Only  28%  of  households  used  chemical \nfertilizers  in  1999,  and  less  than  one  third  of  households  use  any  form  of  mechanization.  Low \ntechnical expertise; limited access to domestic and international markets for inputs and outputs; \nlack of access to market information; constraints to export, inter-provincial, and external trade; \nlow  domestic  demand;  and  the  dearth  of  local  agribusinesses  are  some  of  the  main  reasons \nwhy  agricultural  production  has  been  inefficient.  Limited  human  resource  capacity,  poor \n\n                                                 \n4   Bank pour le Commerce Exterieur Lao, Lane Xang Bank, and Lao May Bank \n5   Joint Development Bank, Lao-Viet Bank, and Vientiane Commercial Bank \n6  Public Bank (Malaysia), Bangkok Bank, Bank of Ayudhya, Krung Thai Bank, Siam Commercial Bank, Thai Farmers \nBank,  and  Thai  Military  Bank  (all  Thai  banks),  all  of  which  have  branch  offices  in  Vientiane.  Standard  Chartered \nBank has a representative office and only provides offshore guarantee facilities for overseas clients doing business \nin Lao PDR. \n\n7   This comprises about KN42 billion from ADB, KN5 billion from the International Fund for Agricultural Development, \n\nand KN0.3 billion from the European Union. \n\n8  See Appendix 2 for problem and objective tree analyses. \n\n\f4 \n\nagricultural support and delivery services, and lack of medium- and short-term credit and other \nfinancial  services  hamper  agricultural  development.  As  well,  the  high  cost  of  transportation \nbecause of lack of physical infrastructure is a major constraint to the flow of goods and services. \nSupport  for  rural  infrastructure,  especially  rural  access  roads,  which  link  rural  areas  to  larger \nmarkets, is an important intervention to facilitate the flow of technology from market to producer \nand vice versa. \n \n12. \nTo  stimulate  growth  in  agriculture  and  to  raise  rural  incomes,  it  is  necessary  to  move \nbeyond subsistence farming to more diversified, commercial agricultural production by assisting \nsubsistence and semicommercial farmers to transit from their present low input systems to more \nproductive,  higher  input,  and  profitable  commercial  farming  systems.  To  facilitate  the \ncommercialization  process,  an  enabling  environment  for  private  sector  investment,  particularly \nin  commercial  agricultural  development  to  link  producers,  wholesalers,  and  retail  buyers  is \nneeded.  Major  factors  contributing  to  low  agricultural  production  and  diversification  include \n(i) limited  access  to  financial  services,  (ii)  underdeveloped  and  weak  research  and  extension, \n(iii) underdeveloped seed production system and lack of improved seed and planting material, \n(iv) lack of knowledge of improved technology and lack of skill of MAF staff, (v) limited market \noutlets  and  poor  post  harvest  facilities,  and  (vi)  high  cost  of  transportation  and  lack  of  all-\nweather roads. The underdeveloped research and lack of improved seed and planting material, \nwhile  not  being  binding  constraints,  since  these  are  now  readily  available  from  neighboring \ncountries, need to be further studied for future strengthening.  \n \n13. \nAbout  half  of  all  households  keep  buffaloes  for  draught  power,  and  a  third  have  cattle \n(the average number of cattle per household is higher than that for buffalo, though). Pig raising \nis  also  common.  However,  only  a  third  of  households  currently  vaccinate  their  cattle.  The \nlivestock trade with Thailand is significant, but poor cattle and livestock health hamper this trade \nand  expose  farmers  to  the  opportunistic  and  rent-seeking  behavior  of  middlemen  and \nunscrupulous  officials.  Fish  is  a  major  source  of  protein,  accounting  for  40%  of  total  protein \nintake. Fish farming is characterized as extensive low density without feeding to semi-extensive \nfarming  with  a  small  amount  of  feeding.  Despite  the  Government\u2019s  support  through  the \noperation of fish stations with hatcheries, mortality rates have been high. The main constraints \nare lack of technical capacity within MAF and lack of a consistent technology for fish breeding.  \n \n14. \nPotential agribusiness investors perceive the Lao PDR to be a high-risk country in which \nto  conduct  business.  High  costs  for  registrations,  hidden  administrative  costs,  and  the  weak \nlegal  framework  impose  extra  burdens  in  this  regard.  Nontariff  barriers  and  other  border \nirregularities,  and  the  slow  response  of  Lao  farmers  to  demand  compound  the  constraints  to \nagribusiness  viability.  Partly  because  of  the  large  component  of  subsistence  agriculture,  the \nmarketing  system  has  remained  underdeveloped.  Interregional  distribution  is  limited  to  some \nfruits and fish. Regional market prices vary significantly and reflect the poor market information, \npoor quality of produce, poor transport facilities, and licensing requirements.  \n \n15. \nAgricultural  Extension  and  Marketing.  Extension  budgets  are  limited,  and  the  main \nfunction of the DAFO has, therefore, been confined to collecting data on production, carrying out \nregulatory  functions,  and  occasionally  mobilizing  villagers  to  construct  basic  infrastructure. \nWhile some assistance to farmers has been provided, such as livestock vaccination, not much \nhas  been  done  to  help  farmers  improve  their  productivity.  However,  there  is  a  growing \nawareness of the importance of extension and the role of MAF in promoting agricultural growth, \nwhich  has  resulted  in  the  decentralization  of  the  extension  system  and  assistance  by  bilateral \nand  multilateral  agencies,  such  as  under  the  Sustainable  Irrigated  Agriculture  Project,  Farmer \nIntegrated Agriculture Training Project, Integrated Pest Management Project, PEP, and ADB TA \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\n2333-LAO to strengthen MAF. (See Appendix 3 for external assistance.) Recognizing this, the \nGovernment  has  tried  hard  to  provide  more  funds  for  extension  activities.  External  support  is \nneeded to operationalize this vision. \n \nStudies  show  that  the  weakest  link  in  the  marketing  chain  on  the  demand  side  of  Lao \n16. \nagriculture is the shortage and/or absence of primary markets in many areas.  Primary markets \nare  the  point  of  first  sale  from  producers  to  local  consumers  and  to  wholesalers,  and  the \nabsence  of  such  basic  facilities  deters  farmers  from  producing  for  the  market  and  improving \ntheir  livelihood.  On  the  supply  side,  local  supply  of  agricultural  inputs  is  constrained  by  the \nabsence of primary markets. Shortage of inputs is a major constraint to increasing commercial \nagricultural production. \n \nAccessibility and Availability of Financial Services. Because rural incomes fluctuate \n17. \nand  a  multitude  of  risks  affect  income  and  consumption,  rural  households  need  access  to \nfinancial services to help stabilize income and consumption and alleviate chronic and transitory \nfood insecurity. Chronic food insecurity can be alleviated by increasing production through the \nprovision  of  credit,  while  transitory  food  security,  which  involves  income  and  consumption \nsmoothing, requires savings and insurance facilities. \n \n18. \nAccessibility  of  rural  financial  services  is  important  to  ensure  that  farmers  and  rural \nbusinesses  have  the  wherewithal  to  adopt  new  technologies  and  practices  that  can  improve \ntheir  income.  In  2000,  ADB  approved  a  cluster  TA  for  Rural  Finance  Development  to  help \ndevelop  a  sustainable  market-oriented  rural  finance  system  and  to  strengthen  APB.  The \nInternational  Monetary  Fund,  World  Bank,  and  ADB  are  also  currently  collaborating  to \nstrengthen the financial sector (under the World Bank Financial Management Adjustment Credit \nand  the  ADB  Banking  Sector  Reform  Program  Loan),  and  the  Government  is  pledging \nsignificant  reforms  in  the  enabling  environment  and  banking  sector.  Under  these  initiatives, \ncredit  lines  to  APB  have  been  strongly  discouraged  until  these  reforms  and  those  relating  to \ngovernance,  audit,  disclosure  and  accounting  practices,  risk  management,  and  human \nresources  development  (supported  under  ADB  TA  3413-LAO)  in  APB  specifically  are  carried \nout.  \n \nThere  are  currently  no  regulations  for  microfinance  institutions.  There  is  no  specific \n19. \ncredit  union  law.  The  legal  basis  for  chartering  credit  unions  (or  credit  cooperatives)  is  the \nRegulations  on  Credit  Cooperatives,  No.  02/SB,  dated  15  November  1994  issued  by  the \ngovernor of the Bank of Lao PDR (BOL).9 BOL regulations address some areas of credit union \nregistration; powers; governance; prudential standards; supervision; and the general powers of \nsavings and credit unions to acquire, hold, and dispose of assets, to enter into contracts, to offer \ndeposit and loan services, to determine their own interest rates, and to borrow and to invest in \nauthorized  investments.  However,  there  are  several  provisions  still  lacking,  notably  those \nrelated  to  investment,  membership,  loan  write-off,  external  audit,  external  borrowing,  and  loan \nportfolio  concentration.  So  far,  only  the  Coop\u00e9ratives  de  Cr\u00e9dits  pour  le  Soutien  aux  Petites \nUnit\u00e9s  de  Production,  comprising  nine  partner  cooperatives,  have  successfully  formed  under \nthis  legislation  and  operated  in  rural  areas,  but  on  a  very  small  scale,  reaching  only  900 \nmembers and with a loan outstanding of about $140,000 (financed by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Investissement \net  de  D\u00e9veloppement  International  and  the  Association  pour  le  Soutien  et  le  D\u00e9veloppement \ndes  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s  Paysannes  au  Laos).  The  Phongsali  Decentralized  Credit  Network  in  Phongsali \n                                                 \n9 This Regulation is founded on the following: (i) Law No. 04/90 PSA, dated 10 July 1990, on the Establishment of the \nBank  of  the  Lao  PDR,  promulgated  by  the  Presidential  Decree  No.  39/PR  of  27  July  1990;  (ii)  Prime  Minister\u2019s \nDecree No. 03/PM of 23 January 1992, on the Management of Activities by Commercial Banks and other Financial \nInstitutions; and (iii) Resolution of the meeting of the Bank Council held on 5 September 1994. \n\n\f6 \n\nDistrict, operating under the credit cooperative regulations of BOL, was established in 1997 in \n5 villages.  It  now  provides  credit  services  in  49  villages,  reaching  about  2,000  families  in \nPhongsali District.  \n \nPolicy  Constraints.  Other  weaknesses  that  plague  the  financial  and  business  sectors \n20. \nrelate to the legal environment. While a framework of legislation for the operation of commercial \nbusinesses  has  been  developed,  there  is  much  uncertainty  regarding  it.  Among  the \nuncertainties  are  constraints  caused  by  a  lack  of  dissemination  of  legislation,  limits  on  judicial \ncapacity, incomplete repeal of legislation that is technically no longer in force, overlap between \nlaws  and  between  decrees,  uncertainty  of  title  registration  procedures,  incomplete  land  titling \nand  associated  high  transaction  costs,  and  time-consuming  legal  processes  in  relation  to \ncontract  enforcement  and  debt  recovery.  These  constraints  seriously  hinder  sound  lending  by \nbanks and discourage foreign investors and foreign banks. \n \n\n2. \n\nOpportunities \n\n21.  With its small population and abundant (but largely untapped) natural resources, the Lao \nPDR  is  in  a  strong  position  to  produce  goods  for  export  to  neighboring  markets,  which  have \nlarge populations with relatively high incomes but suffer land and other resource pressures and \nincreasing  urbanization.  Just  outside  the  Lao  PDR  border  live  at  least  200  million  people.  As \nindustrial development accelerates in these countries, agricultural land resources are shifting to \nthe  non-agricultural  sectors,  and  these  populations  could  become  major  consumers  of  rice, \nlivestock, vegetables, and other farm produce from the Lao PDR. \n \nDespite  the  constraints  currently  faced  by  Lao  agriculture,  some  Lao  agricultural \n22. \ncommodities are exported through unofficial border trade mechanisms to the People\u2019s Republic \nof China, Thailand, and Viet Nam. These include maize, soybean, groundnut, cotton, tobacco, \nsesame, red bean, cabbage, banana, tamarind, watermelon, mulberry bark and other nontimber \nforest  products,  buffalo,  cattle,  and  pigs.10  The  fact  that  such  trade  with  neighboring  countries \ntakes place suggests that a demand  for some Lao agricultural products exists. Crops identified \nas  having  potential  for  export  and/or  import  substitution  based  on  comparative  advantage \nanalysis  are  maize,  peanut,  soybean,  sesame,  sunflower,  sorghum,  and  safflower  for  field \ncrops; grape, mandarin, sapodilla, orange, durian, rambutan, cashew, longan, and tamarind for \nfruits; and coffee, sugar cane, cotton, and sericulture among industrial crops. By ensuring that \nAFTA  rules  are  enforced,  Lao  agricultural  produce  should  be  able  to  enter  Thailand  and  Viet \nNam freely, thereby benefiting farmers from better prices and the country from more trade. \n \n23. \nLivestock,  an  integral  part  of  most  family  farm  systems,  contributes  to  almost  half  the \naverage income of farmers. The Lao PDR has a comparative advantage among the neighboring \nexport  markets,  and  there  is  considerable  potential  to  increase  livestock  production  and  value \nadded products for export. Major constraints to the expansion of livestock production are lack of \nan integrated program of animal health, nutrition, and breeding; and lack of support services in \nmarketing  and  market  information  systems.  By  improvements  in  livestock  health  and  mortality \nfarmers can ensure better farm household income. Similarly, Lao PDR can achieve comparative \nadvantage  in  fish  farming,  vis-\u00e0-vis  its  neighbors,  by  applying  the  appropriate  technology  in \nbreeding and rearing of fish. \n \n24. \nThe  Government  recognizes  that  growth  in  the  Lao  agriculture  sector  has  been \nconstrained by (i) the limited capacity of public sector institutions and human resources; (ii) an \n\n                                                 \n10 FAO. 2000. Development of Market Information and Marketing Extension Capability. \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nunsupportive  environment  for  private  sector  development;  (iii)  limited  transport,  power,  and \ncommunications  infrastructure;  (iv)  unavailability  of  rural  finance  and  undeveloped  input  and \noutput  markets;  (v)  international  trade  constraints;  (vi)  variability  in  rainfall  and  incidence  of \nfloods;  and  (vii)  the  predominance  of  subsistence  agriculture.  The  Government  is  therefore \ncommitted  to  a  market-based  economy  with  equitable  distribution  of  the  benefits  of  growth.  In \nNovember 1999, the Government presented its strategic vision for the agriculture sector11 at a \nconference of aid agencies. This strategic vision includes a focus on (i) increasing rural incomes \nby developing market-oriented agriculture and improving public institutions and policies to better \nserve this aim; (ii) recognizing the preeminent role of the private sector and working to improve \nthe business and investment environment; (iii) achieving a better balance of investments in the \nsector; and (iv) improving the sustainability of infrastructure investments. The strategy focuses \non improvements in farmer knowledge, awareness, and capacity to increase agricultural output \nand create marketable surpluses to meet growing domestic and regional demand in both local \nand  external  raw  commodity  and  agribusiness  processing  markets.  In  recognition  of  the \nimportance of agricultural extension services, the Government recently increased MAF\u2019s budget \nby 50%. \n \n25. \nIt  is  generally  recognized  that  credit  in  the  presence  of  technology,  extension,  and \nmarkets  can  speed  up  development.  In  the  project  areas,  farmers  and  other  rural  inhabitants \nface difficulty in accessing financial services. This problem is compounded by the restructuring \nof APB and by reforms in the financial sector under ADB\u2019s cluster TA and the Banking Sector \nReform  Program  Loan.  Simple  revision  in  collateral  regulations,  group-based  lending,  and \nproviding  loans  of  appropriate  duration  could  increase  the  coverage  of  farmers  under  the \nProject. By introducing more loan products and innovative financial services, APB could reach \nout  to  traders  and  merchants  supplying  inputs  and  small-scale  machinery  to  farmers. \nMerchants,  in  turn,  could  extend  credit  facilities  to  project  beneficiaries  on  normal  trade  credit \nterms. The Law on Cooperatives provides the framework for the creation of credit cooperatives \ninvolving  the  private  sector,  which  could  serve  the  rural  population  and  promote  increased \ncompetition  for  formal  financial  institutions.  Under  the  ADB  cluster  TA,  it  is  proposed  to  form \ncredit unions under the auspices of APB, after the completion of the ongoing diagnostic study of \nAPB. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nObjectives \n\nThe purpose of the Project is to promote sustainable commercial smallholder agriculture \n26. \nand associated agribusiness in the Lao PDR, with the goal of achieving sustained increases in \nrural  incomes  and  long-term  reductions  in  rural  poverty.12  The  purpose  will  be  achieved  by  (i) \nincreasing  production  and  marketing  of  diversified,  nonrice  dry  season  cash  crops;  livestock; \nand  fisheries;  (ii)  improving  smallholder  access  to  domestic  and  international  markets  and  to \nmarket \nin  value-adding  agribusiness.  See \ninformation;  and  (iii) \nAppendix 5 for the project framework.  \n \nThe  Project  covers  16  districts  in  four  provinces.  These  include  six  districts  in \n27. \nSavannakhet,13 six in Champassak,14 two in Khammouan,15 and two in Vientiane.16 These four \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 1997.

As \nwell, they present the most interest to potential foreign investors.  \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs17 \n\n1. \n\nFarmer Support Services \n\n28. \nThe Project will facilitate the introduction of technologies to intensify and commercialize \nthe  production  of  wet  season  rice,  nonrice  cash  crops  during  the  dry  season,  livestock,  and \nfisheries. Target beneficiaries include subsistence, semicommercial, and commercial producers \nwith  varying  production  objectives,  resources,  and  other  circumstances.  Farmer  support \nservices  will  need  to  tailor  technology  and  management  packages  according  to  these \ncircumstances  in  order  to  increase  relevance  and  adoption  rates.  The  method  used  will  be \nparticipatory selection and adoption of techniques that enable farmers to make sound resource \nmanagement decisions, taking into account the continuously changing environment of an open \nmarket  economy.  The  extension  methods  for  this  intervention  have  been  successfully  field \ntested under the PEP, financed by SDC. This approach is a farmer demand-driven participatory \nprocess,  which  will  form  the  basis  of  the  national  extension  system  of  NAFES,  now  under \ndevelopment. \n \n29. \nThe  capacity  of  the  extension  staff  of  the  PAFSs  and  DAFOs  will  be  strengthened \nthrough  training  and  introduction  of  new  technology.  The  component  will  develop  new  market \ninformation  and  will  link  with  the  information  systems  of  MAF  and  the  Ministry  of  Commerce \n(MOC).  The  PAFSs  and  DAFOs  will  disseminate  to  farmers  improved  crop  and  livestock \ntechnology  and  extension  packages  from  the  National  Agriculture  and  Forestry  Research \nInstitute,  IRRI,  and  extension  services  in  neighboring  countries.18  Market  information  on  crops \ntraded  in  domestic  and  contiguous  markets  will  also  be  periodically  disseminated.  MAF  will \nestablish formal contacts with extension offices in neighboring countries to acquire freely offered \nextension packages.19 MAF will promote private sector extension services and input supply by \nhelping  to  facilitate  contract  farming  arrangements  by  private  agribusinesses.  The  reach  of \nextension mechanisms will be expanded through training for water users\u2019 associations (WUAs) \nand the creation and training of farmer production and marketing groups (FPMGs) in agricultural \nand livestock production technologies and marketing operations, and in conducting participatory \ntrials  and  demonstrations  in  local  areas.  The  Project  will  also  provide  training  for  village \nextension workers selected by farmers to cover all fields of agricultural and livestock production \nand marketing. \n \n30. \nThe Project will provide community vaccination of animals and demonstrations to reduce \nthe  mortality  of  cattle,  buffalo,  pigs,  and  chickens,  and  will  conduct  dry  season  feeding \ndemonstrations to increase the weight of cattle and buffalo. It will undertake fishpond trials and \ndemonstrations  at  the  district  level  to  promote  wider  adoption  of  aquaculture  to  increase \nhousehold production. To ensure the adoption of new technologies and farming practices crucial \nto  the  sustainability  of  their  activities,  APB  will  provide  financial  services  to  farmers  and  rural \n\n                                                 \n15 Thakhek and Nongbok. \n16 Thoulakom and Phonhong. \n17  See Supplementary Appendix B for description of project components. \n18  Lao-IRRI  will  be  engaged  to  provide  support  for  rice  extension  training,  rice  storage  demonstrations  aimed  at \nreducing post-harvest losses at the farm, and commercial rice seed production by selected farmers on 500-600 ha. \n\n19 The Lao PDR has bilateral agreements with all neighboring countries to freely exchange extension information. \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nhouseholds  in  the  project  area.  APB  will  also  pilot  the  formation  of  credit  unions20  under  the \nCooperative  Act  and  oversee  their  growth  and  operations  with  the  aim  of  strengthening \ngrassroot microfinance initiatives for rural households.21 \n \n\n2. \n\nAgribusiness and Marketing22  \n\n31. \nThe  Project  will  provide  (i)  agribusiness  investment  promotion  through  conferences \norganized by the Lao National Chamber of Commerce and Industries; (ii) provincial trade fares \nand  investment  promotion  workshops  to  promote  collaboration  between  producers  and  value-\nadded  industries  in  Lao  PDR,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam;  (iii)  establishment  of  Lao  agribusiness \nforum  for  private  business  and  policy  makers  to  discuss  legal,  regulatory,  and  other  relevant \nissues;  (iv)  upgrading  of  MAF\u2019s  information  system  in  coordination  with  MOC  and  others  to \nensure  mutual  benefit  and  to  avoid  duplication;  and  (v)  assistance  to  MOC\u2019s  Trade  Promotion \nCenter  to  promote  Lao  products  through  electronic  medium.  National  and  provincial  level \nconferences  and  workshops  will  be  used  to  build  awareness  and  understanding  on  the \nimplementation  of  policies  and  related  legal  and  regulatory  functions  needed  to  facilitate  the \ndevelopment of competitive agribusiness, and allow interaction between public officials and the \nprivate sector on ways to improve their performance. \n \n32. \nThe Project will support the construction of strategically located primary markets in order \nto  encourage  expansion  of  farmer-initiated  retail  sales  within  local  areas  and  to  promote  the \ngrowth  and  strengthening  of  wholesale  marketing  operations  by  middlemen,  who  collect  and \nconsolidate  small  quantities  of  produce  from  individual  farmers  for  onward  transshipment  to \ninternal  retail  marketing  points  and  to  cross-border  marketing  points  in  neighboring  countries. \nMarket locations that will serve as collection, grading, storage, and exchange points for primary \nproduce as well as points for distributing agricultural inputs (fertilizers; seeds; chemicals; tools; \nand small farm machinery including pumps, pedestrian power tillers, harvesters, and threshers) \nwill be identified during project implementation. \n \n33. \nTo  assist  project  smallholder  farmers  to  acquire  better  understanding  of  markets, \ninformation  technology  will  be  used  to  collect  and  disseminate,  on  a  weekly  basis,  market \ninformation on prices and volumes traded in both domestic and contiguous markets to farmers \nthrough DAFOs by developing new market information links through MAF\u2019s information system, \nin coordination with MOC and other relevant ministries and offices. There will be an extensive \neffort  to  develop  and  extend  throughout  the  project  provinces  essential  knowledge  and \nspecifications of international agricultural product grades and standards. \n \n34. \nTraining  in  market  economics  will  be  carried  out  by  the  Government  National \nOrganization  for  Studies  on  Policy  and  Administration  (NOSPA)  including  (i)  two  1-week \nnational market economics workshops for participants from MAF, MOC, the Ministry of Industry \nand Handicrafts, the Lao Chamber of Commerce and Industries, and the Lao Trade Promotion \nCenter; (ii) four 1-week provincial market economics training workshops for staff of the Office of \n\n                                                 \n20 As provided under Technical Assistance to Lao PDR for Rural Finance Development. \n21  A TA proposal for JFPR support to provide dedicated funds for social preparation and group formation of poorer \ncommunities  in  the  project  area  is  being  prepared  as  stand-alone  assistance.  The  proposed  TA  will  complement \nthe  farmer  support  services  component  by  supporting  the  expansion  of  a  local  microfinance  institution,  the \nCoop\u00e9ratives  de  Cr\u00e9dits  pour  le  Soutien  aux  Petites  Unit\u00e9s  de  Production  and  providing  training  and  basic \nequipment  to  enhance  their  capacity  to  deliver  microfinance  services.  The  Project  will  provide  the  services  of \ndomestic and international rural financial services specialists to assist APB in delivering efficient financial services \ndemanded by project beneficiaries. \n\n22  See Supplementary Appendix C for market study. \n\n\f10 \n\nthe  Provincial  Governors,  PAFS,  provincial  departments  of  commerce  (DOCs),  provincial \ndepartment of industry and handicrafts (DIHs), and Provincial Chambers of Commerce; (iii) four \n1-week  provincial  training  workshops  in  market  surveying  techniques  for  staff  of  provincial \nDOCs; and (iv) one 10-day training in agricultural price forecasting for the Planning Division of \nMOC and the Division of Statistics of MAF. \n \n35. \nTo improve the climate for investment and to facilitate the resolution of problems faced \nby investors, the Project will promote policy dialogue between the business community and the \nGovernment  through  the  development  of  business  forums  at  the  central  and  local  levels.  This \ninitiative will complement the training provided under the Project to government functionaries in \nmarket economics and the importance of a supportive policy environment on the one hand, and \nthe financial sector reforms under the Banking Sector Reform Program Loan and cluster TA for \nRural Finance Development of ADB and multilateral agencies on the other. \n \n\n3. \n\nRural Infrastructure \n\nThe Project will provide for the rehabilitation of 89.5 kilometers (km) and construction of \n36. \n70.8  km  of  strategic  roads,  identified  as  the  highest  priority  rural  access  roads  in  the  project \narea.  These  roads  will  lower  transport  costs  and  facilitate  the  flow  of  agricultural  technology, \ninputs,  and  produce  among  production  centers,  primary  markets,  and  strategic  GMS  markets. \nThe  selected  roads  link  existing  west-east  and  north-south  marketing  corridors  (primarily  to \nThailand and Viet Nam, and to the People\u2019s Republic of China) to agricultural areas that have \nthe potential to adopt agriculture and livestock productivity-enhancing technology.23 \n \nThese roads are (i) the Pakse-Champassak-Soukhouma-Mounlapamok road (Road 14-\n37. \nA), which links the impoverished, but potentially productive, lower Mekong plain of Champassak \nProvince  to  the  highly  commercial  east-west  corridor  of  Pakxong-Pakse  and  the  Thai  border; \n(ii) the Champhone-Xonbuli road in Savannakhet Province, which links the potentially productive \nXonbuli  District  to  the  commercially  active  east-west  corridor  in  Savannakhet  that  connects  to \nthe  border  region  with  Thailand;  and  (iii)  the  Songkhone-Thapasoun  road,  which  links  the \ncommercial  center  of  Songkhone  District  in  Savannakhet  Province  to  a  key  Mekong  River \nborder  trading  market  with  Thailand.  The  selected  roads  are  within  the  commercially  viable \nzones of the three selected agricultural plains, which serve large populations who need access \nto marketing corridors. \n \n\n4. \n\nProject Management \n\n38. \nThe Project will provide administrative support, technical guidance, and monitoring and \nsupervision related to project implementation, including establishment of a project performance \nmonitoring  system  (PPMS)  and  use  of  consultants  for  project  activities.  International  and \ndomestic  consultant  services  will  be  provided  to  assist  the  national  project  director  (NPD)  and \nthe  provincial  project  offices  (PPOs)  at  the  national,  provincial,  and  district  levels  in \nadministering  and  implementing  the  Project.  The  Project  will  also  provide  expert  technical \nadvice  in  marketing,  livestock  and  fisheries  development,  socioeconomic  baseline  and  impact \nassessments,  training  of  staff,  and  designing  and  implementing  extension  and  training \nprograms. \n \n\n                                                 \n23 The importance of the road network to the economic development of the Lao PDR has been discussed in several \nforums,  the  most  recent  being  the  AEM/METI  Economic  and  Industrial  Cooperation  Committee  meeting  in \nVientiane on 11 April 2002. \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nSynergy with Other Projects \n\nThe Project will work closely with projects financed by ADB and other external agencies, \n39. \nsuch  as  PEP;  the  Lao  Extension  and  Agriculture  Project  (LEAP)  of  SDC;  the  Mekong  Project \nDevelopment Facility (MPDF);24 and NOSPA, which is a Government agency providing training \nin  market  economics  to  Lao  officials  and  which  is  the  recipient  of  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr \nTechnische  Zusammenarbeit  (GTZ)  assistance.  As  well,  the  Project  will  use  the  International \nLabour  Organisation  (ILO)  in  advising  and  overseeing  the  construction  of  rural  roads  using \nlabor-based  methodologies,  which  creates  employment  and  foster  a  strong  sense  of  local \nownership.  \n \n40. \nThe  Project  will  closely  coordinate  with  two  ADB-financed  projects  that  are  working  to \nimprove  the  functioning  of  financial  markets  in  the  country.  The  ongoing  cluster  TA  on  Rural \nFinance  Development  is  working  to  improve  the  enabling  environment  for  rural  and \nmicrofinance,  identify  and  roll  out  needed  reforms  in  APB,  and  establish  three  pilot  credit \nunions. It is expected that at least two of these credit unions will be established in the project \nareas in due course. The proposed Banking Sector Reform Program Loan will promote needed \nreforms  to  develop  the  banking  and  small  and  medium  enterprise  sectors.  The  Project, \ntherefore, has not included a separate credit line. Instead, it will work on the credit demand side \nthrough  its  assistance  to  local  farmers  and  entrepreneurs,  and  linking  them  with  APB  and  the \nsupply of credit expected to result from the other initiatives. \n \n\n2. \n\nResettlement \n\n41. \nRehabilitation  of  89.5  km  of  roads  and  construction  of  70.8  km  of  roads  and  three \nbridges  will  require  acquisition  of  approximately  12  ha  of  land.    Most  of  the  proposed  road \nconstruction and rehabilitation will be made within existing rights-of-way, for which there will be \nminimal  requirements  for  land  acquisition.  Land  acquisition  will  be  necessary  for  new  road \nconstruction as well as new primary markets. Selection of alignments for the new road sections \nand  primary  markets  will  be  done  using  a  community  participatory  approach  during  project \nimplementation. The details of number of affected households and type and area of land to be \nacquired  from  each  household  will  be  determined  during  project  implementation,  when  the \nalignments and the scope of civil works are finalized. However, it is anticipated that there will be \nno  dwellings  affected,  possibly  only  some  small  shops  that  can  be  relocated  nearby,  and  a \nminimal  amount  of  agricultural  land.  Because  some  of  the  subproject  alignments  cannot  be \ndetermined  before  appraisal  due  to  design  issues  and  the  need  for  a  community  participation \nprocess  for  the  new  alignments,  a  sector-like  approach  is  being  taken.  For  this  approach,  a \nresettlement  framework25  has  been  prepared  to  include  resettlement  objectives,  policy \n\n                                                 \n24  Established  in  1997,  the  MPDF  supports  the  development  of  private,  domestically  owned  small  and  medium \nenterprises  in  Cambodia,  Lao  PDR,  and  Viet  Nam.  The  MPDF  is  managed  by  the  International  Finance \nCorporation  and  is  financed  by  a  number  of  countries  and  institutions  including  ADB,  IFC,  Australia,  Canada, \nFinland,  Japan,  Norway,  Sweden,  Switzerland,  and  the  United  Kingdom.  The  MPDF  helps  private  companies \nprepare business plans, raise financing for investment projects, and obtain various types of advisory assistance. It \ndoes  not  itself  finance  projects,  but  rather  helps  structure  financing  plans  and  obtain  financing  on  appropriate \nterms. The MPDF provides advice, and arranges assistance from specialist consultants, for private companies in a \nvariety  of  areas,  such  as  business  planning,  marketing  strategy,  technical  and  operational  assistance,  quality \ncontrol and certification, and accounting and management information systems. This assistance is provided either \nin  conjunction  with  the  raising  of  finance  for  an  investment  project,  or  on  a  stand-alone  basis  to  companies  that \nrequire such services. \n\n25  See Supplementary Appendix D for Resettlement Framework. \n\n\f12 \n\nframework, and entitlements for different types of losses, and identifying the major institutional \nresponsibilities for land acquisition and resettlement together with the financing sources (see the \nsummary  resettlement  framework  in  Appendix  6).  In  addition,  a  sample  resettlement  plan  has \nbeen  prepared  for  one  project  road  segment  (Songkhone-Thapasoun)  for  which  there  is  a \nsufficient  level  of  design.  It  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Handbook  on  Involuntary \nResettlement.26  The  sample  resettlement  plan  is  time-bound  and  costed  and  covers  the \npopulation  record,  socioeconomic  information,  asset  inventory,  land  assessments,  and \nconsultations  with  and  disclosure  to  the  people  affected,  plus  arrangements  for  rehabilitation, \nmanagement,  monitoring,  and  evaluation.  The  sample  resettlement  plan  will  be  reviewed \nfollowing  detailed  design  if  there  have  been  changes  in  design  resulting  in  changes  in  land \nacquisition  impact.  For  all  other  road  segments,  road  alignments  will  be  determined  after  final \nsurvey  and  design,  during  project  implementation,  and  resettlement  plans  will  be  prepared  for \nADB approval, with satisfactory implementation before the award of any civil works contract. \n \n\n3. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects \n\nThe  Project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B.  An  initial  environmental \n42. \nexamination  (IEE)  and  a  summary  IEE  for  the  whole  project  (see  Appendix  7),  and  a  sample \nIEE for  the road rehabilitation subproject were prepared. The IEE concluded that any adverse \nenvironmental impacts arising from construction and operation of subprojects, in particular, road \nrehabilitation and construction, will be limited in duration and extent, and can be minimized to an \nacceptable  level  through  the  implementation  of  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring  programs \nincluded in the subprojects in compliance with the ADB\u2019s environmental requirements and those \napplicable at the national, provincial, and county levels.27  \n \n43.  MAF assured that the mitigation measures identified in the IEEs will be incorporated into \nthe  design,  construction,  and  operational  stages  of  the  Project.  Environmental  measures  on \nwhich action needs to be taken by the contractors will be incorporated in the contracts for civil \nworks. To ensure that all applicable national and provincial environmental laws, regulations, and \nstandards, and ADB environmental requirements will be met during Project implementation, an \nenvironment  unit  comprising  representatives  of  the  Science,  Technology  and  Environment \nAgency  (STEA)  and  MAF  will  be  established  within  the  office  of  the  national  project  director \n(ONPD) and, at least one environmental staff will be assigned at each of the PPOs. Monitoring \nof  mitigation  measures  will  be  carried  out  by  ONPD  through  its  environmental  unit.  Monitoring \nwill  be  reported  to  STEA  and  ADB  through  quarterly  and  annual  progress  reports  on  project \nimplementation. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n44. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  over  6  years  is  estimated  at  $15.2  million  equivalent, \nincluding  physical  and  price  contingencies,  interest  during  construction,  taxes,  and  duties.  Of \nthe  total  cost,  $6.5  million  or  43%  will  be  incurred  in  foreign  exchange,  and  $8.7  million \nequivalent  or  57%  will  be  incurred  in  local  currency.  A  summary  of  the  cost  estimates  is  in \nTable 1, and detailed cost estimates are presented in Appendix 8.28  \n\n                                                 \n26 See the summary resettlement plan in Supplementary Appendix E. \n27  See Supplementary Appendix F of environmental management plan. \n28  See Supplementary Appendix G for detailed cost tables. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13 \n\nTable 1: Project Cost Estimates \n($'000) \n \n\n \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n  \n \nComponent \n  \n A.

The ADB loan will be \nfrom Special Funds resources with a term of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years. The \nannual interest charge will be 1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. The Borrower \nwill be the Government of the Lao PDR.  \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nForeign \nExchange \n \n6.5 \n\n0.0 \n6.5 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n \n5.5 \n\n3.2 \n8.7 \n\n \n\nTotal \nCost \n\n12.0 \n\n3.2 \n15.2 \n\n \n\n \n  Percent \n \n \n\n \n78% \n\n \n \n\n22% \n100% \n\n \nSource \n\n \nADB \n\n \nF. \n\nGovernment \nTotal \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n46. \nThe Executing Agency will be MAF, which will appoint the NPD acceptable to ADB. The \nNPD  will  be  assigned  adequate  office  support  staff  and  will  have  overall  administrative  and \nmanagement  authority  over  all  project  components  and  will  be  responsible  for  procurement, \nproject  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation,  reporting,  arranging  audits,  and  financial \n\n\f14 \n\nmanagement.  A  national  project  steering  committee  (NPSC)  will  be  established  consisting  of \nrepresentatives  from  MAF;  MOC;  the  Ministry  of  Communication,  Transport,  Post,  and \nConstruction; the Committee for Planning and Cooperations; and the provincial vice governors, \nand will be chaired by the vice minister of MAF. The NPD will be the member secretary of the \nNPSC.  The  NPSC  will  meet  twice  a  year  to  review  the  physical  and  financial  progress  of  the \nProject.  The  NPSC  will  provide  overall  guidance  and  direction  for  project  implementation,  and \nhelp to resolve any outstanding issues including policy constraints.  \n \nField implementation will be the responsibility of the respective provincial governments in \n47. \nthe project areas. PPOs will be set up and will have day-to-day responsibility for coordination of \nproject  activities  in  the  provinces.  The  governor\u2019s  office  will  designate  a  provincial  project \ncoordinator (preferably from PAFS) acceptable to ADB to head the PPO. A provincial steering \ncommittee  will  be  established  in  each  province,  chaired  by  the  vice  governor  and  including \nrepresentatives  of  PAFS;  the  department  of  communication,  transport,  post,  and  construction \n(DCTPC); DOC; and the DIH. DCTPC will implement road construction and rehabilitation, and \nprimary market construction; PAFS will implement the extension component; and DOC and DIH \nwill implement the agribusiness promotion component in collaboration with PAFS. The DAFOs \nwill  implement  the  extension  component  at  the  district  level.  DAFO  staff  will  be  trained  and \nguided  by  the  Central  Extension  Training  Unit  at  NAFES  and  by  the  Provincial  Extension \nTraining Units within PAFSs. All will assign full-time staff necessary to implement the Project. \n \n48.  MAF will (i) work through the PAFS and the DAFOs in extension and training of farmers; \n(ii)  implement  a  3-year  capacity-building  program  for  PAFS  and  DAFO  staff;  (iii)  implement \nproduction  and  marketing  capacity  strengthening  of  DAFOs,  WUAs,  and  FPMGs;  (iv)  identify \nsites  for  primary  markets;  (v)  work  with  Ministry  of  Communication,  Transport,  Post  and \nConstruction  (MCTPC)  to  carry  out  resettlement  plans  of  roads  and  markets;  (vi)  work  with \nSTEA  to  carry  out  environmental  impact  assessment  of  roads  and  markets;  and  (vii)  conduct \nworkshops and study tours within the Lao PDR and to neighboring countries to study a range of \npublic and private sector extension mechanisms. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nthe  necessary  management  systems, \n\nThe implementation period will be 6 years, from 2003 to 2009. The first year will focus on \n49. \nsetting  up \nincluding  procurement,  accounting, \ndisbursement,  and  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  will  lay  the  foundation  for \nimplementation of the Project. A more detailed implementation schedule is in Appendix 9. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n50. \nGoods and services to be financed from the proceeds of the ADB loan will be procured \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Vehicles, equipment, and materials will \nbe  procured  by  international  competitive  bidding  where  the  cost  is  valued  at  more  than \n$500,000  equivalent,  or  by  international  shopping  where  the  cost  is  valued  from  $100,000  to \n$500,000  equivalent.  Equipment  or  materials  valued  at  less  than  $100,000  equivalent  may  be \nprocured  under  direct  purchase.  Final  details  regarding  packages  for  procurement  will  be \ndetermined during project implementation as appropriate.  \n \n51. \nThe civil works for road rehabilitation to be financed from the proceeds of the ADB loan \nwill  be  procured  in  accordance  with  local  competitive  bidding  procedures  among  prequalified \nprivate local contractors acceptable to ADB. Given the small and scattered nature of the roads \nto  be  constructed/rehabilitated  under  the  Project,  individual  contracts  are  unlikely  to  attract \n\n\f \n\n15 \n\ninternational  bidders.  Domestic  contractors  have  the  capacity  and  capability  to  undertake  the \nrequired  contracts.  The  contractors  will  be  prequalified  by  the  DCTPCs.  Because  labor-based \nmachine-assisted  construction  technology  will  be  employed,  prequalification  will  be  contingent \non the contractors\u2019 attending training workshops on labor-based construction methodology to be \nconducted by ILO specialists. Appendix 10 gives the procurement packages. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nFor successful implementation of the Project, consulting services are required for project \n52. \nmanagement  and  a  number  of  technical  inputs.  The  Project  will  provide  about  146  person-\nmonths  of  specialized  service  of  domestic  consultants  and  about  44  person-months  of \ninternational  consultants  in  both  long  and  short-term  assignments  through  a  consulting  firm \nselected by ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection method. The amount of consulting services \nidentified  under  the  Project  is  considered  necessary  in  view  of  the  limited  human  resources \ncapacity  and  technical  expertise  available  in  the  Government  at  the  central,  provincial,  and \ndistrict levels. Specialist inputs will be required to introduce new technology through the Project \nand will also be used to conduct capacity-building training for PAFS and DAFO staff. Details of \nspecialists  required  and  their  terms  of  reference  are  in  Appendix  11.  The  consultants  will  be \nselected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and \nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants.  For  consulting \nservices  related  to  labor-based  machine-assisted  construction  technology,  a  contract  may  be \nnegotiated directly with ILO, which pioneered this methodology and has extensive experience in \nproviding  assistance  to  similar  projects  throughout  the  GMS  for  several  years.  Similarly, \nservices  related  to  economic  training  will  be  contracted  directly  with  NOSPA  which  has \ndeveloped  special  programs  with  the  assistance  of  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische \nZusammenarbeit  (GTZ) \nin  market  economics.  ADB \nprocedures for direct recruitment will be followed. The Government\u2019s attention has been called \nto  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy,  particularly  the  section  on  fraud  and  corruption,  as  stated  in \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n \n\ntrain  government \n\nfunctionaries \n\nto \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nThe  Government  will  make  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  available  through  budgetary \n53. \nallocation to MAF and the provincial governments, to be applied to finance project expenditures. \nTo  expedite  disbursements,  MOF  will  establish  a  first  generation  imprest  account  with  a \nrecognized commercial bank acceptable to ADB immediately after loan effectiveness. Payments \nwill  be  made  to  and  from  this  account  for  eligible  expenditures  under  the  Project.  A  second \ngeneration  imprest  account  will  also  be  opened  by  ONPD  and  each  of  the  provincial  finance \ndepartments  at  a  recognized  commercial  bank  in  the  project  provinces  acceptable  to  ADB. \nThese  accounts  will  be  used  to  meet  eligible  expenditures  under  the  Project  incurred  by  the \nprovincial  implementing  agencies.  Each  imprest  account  will  be  managed  by  MOF,  ONPD,  or \nthe  concerned  provincial  finance  department,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook  (January  2001),  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  by  the  Government  and \nADB.  The  initial  combined  total  amount  in  all  imprest  accounts  will  not  exceed  6  months  of \nestimated  expenditure  and  not  more  than  10%  of  the  total  loan.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of \nexpenditures  procedure  will  be  followed  to  reimburse  expenditures  and  liquidate  imprest \naccounts for payments below the ceiling of $50,000.  \n \n\n\f16 \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n54. \nThe  provincial  implementing  agencies  will  provide  the  NPD  with  concise  quarterly \nreports  during  each  year  of  implementation,  detailing  the  physical  and  financial  progress  of \nactivities against agreed upon targets and summarizing performance monitoring and evaluation \nresults.  In  turn,  the  NPD  will  submit  to  MAF  consolidated  quarterly  progress  reports  and  a \ncomprehensive annual progress report, and MAF will forward these reports to the Government \nand  ADB.  Notwithstanding  the  quarterly  reports,  the  NPD  will  report  immediately  to  ADB  any \nsignificant events, as they occur, which might affect project implementation. Within 3 months of \nproject completion, a project completion report in the standard ADB format will be prepared by \nthe NPD and submitted to ADB. \n \nThe  NPD  and  the  provinces  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  adequate  to \n55. \nidentify the goods and services financed from loan proceeds, the financing resources received, \nexpenditures  incurred  for  the  Project  and  the  use  of  local  funds.  Accounts  will  be  established \nand maintained in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and following MOF \nguidelines  and  procedures  as  amended  from  time  to  time.  Consolidated  project  accounts  and \nrelated  financial  statements  will  be  compiled  annually  by  the  NPD  and  audited  annually  by \nindependent  external  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audited  accounts,  audit  report,  and \nrelated financial statements will be submitted to ADB not later than 9 months after the end of the \nfiscal year to which they relate. \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nPerformance  monitoring  and  evaluation  (PME)  will  be  undertaken  for  each  project \n56. \ncomponent  to  ensure  that  project  facilities  are  managed  efficiently  and  benefits  realized.  The \nNPD,  with  assistance  from  the  PME  specialists,  will  develop  a  comprehensive  PPMS  system. \nThe PPMS system will measure impacts in terms of participation in project activities, changes in \nproduction and marketing, changes in employment opportunities, development of agribusiness, \nand  other  project  impacts.  It  will  include  a  participatory  mechanism  to  include  beneficiary \ninvolvement  in  monitoring.  The  NPD,  assisted  by  the  PME  specialists  and  the  PPOs,  will  be \nresponsible for carrying out PME activities, including the establishment of benchmarks through \ninitial  baseline  physical  and  socioeconomic  surveys,  data  collection,  and  analysis.  Consistent \nwith the lessons learned under the Agricultural Program Loans (1989 and 1992), the NPD will \nensure  that  all  constraints  to  agriculture  and  agribusiness  development  caused  by  weak  or \nunsupportive policies are clearly identified at the start of the Project, and closely monitored. The \nNPD will submit, within 6 months of loan effectiveness, a Project Administration Memorandum \ncomprising  a  detailed  implementation  plan  for  monitoring  performance  and  for  preparing \nbenchmark information for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence. Annual PME reports will be provided \nto ADB by the NPD throughout project implementation. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n57. \nDuring  the  life  of  the  Project,  ADB  will  carry  out  annual  reviews.  Initial  reviews  will  (i) \ndetermine if all proposed implementation arrangements are appropriate and in place; (ii) review \nthe conduct and outcome of capacity-building activities and training programs within the PAFSs \nand DAFOs; (iii) assess progress relating to extension at the village level; (iv) assess progress \nrelating  to  agribusiness  promotion  and  policy  issues;  and  (v)  assess  the  progress  of  survey, \ndesign, and construction for the roads component and primary markets. During the third year, \nADB and the Government will undertake a comprehensive midterm review. The midterm review \nwill  evaluate  the  actual  physical  and  financial  progress  of  the  Project,  implementation \n\n\f \n\n17 \n\nprocedures,  procurement  performance,  NPD  and  provincial  government  effectiveness,  and \nconsultants\u2019  performance.  Before  the  midterm  review,  the  NPD  will  prepare  a  comprehensive \nreport  identifying  issues  for  the  mission\u2019s  consideration.  On  the  basis  of  the  results  of  the \nmidterm review, necessary changes in project design and implementation arrangements will be \nconsidered by the Government and ADB. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nIn conjunction with the Project, TA is proposed to finance activities of an advisory nature. \n58. \nThere  is  need  to  ensure  that,  on  completion  of  the  Project,  appropriate  policies  and \narrangements  are  in  place  for  the  functioning  of  trade  and  commerce,  as  well  as  to  ensure \nincreased  demand  for  agricultural  produce  through  the  development  and  promotion  of \nagribusinesses. The objectives of the TA are to (i) identify viable and strategic agribusinesses \nand  potential  investors  and  assist  them  in  establishing  their  businesses;  (ii)  train  potential \ninvestors in market analysis, business plan preparation, feasibility studies, and loan applications \nfrom commercial banks; (iii) train potential investors in agroprocessing in the Mekong Institute or \nother suitable institutes; and (iv) raise awareness of business opportunities by conducting study \ntours  for  potential  local  investors/entrepreneurs  to  businesses  around  the  region.  The  TA \ndescription and terms of reference are in Appendix 12.  \n \nThe  TA  amount  of  $250,000  will  be  financed  by  ADB  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  TA \n59. \nfunding  program.  Ten  person-months  of  consulting  services  for  agribusiness  support  and  a \ntraining  consultant  will  be  provided,  and  30  agribusiness  investors  will  be  trained.  The \nconsultants  under  the  TA  are  to  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the \nUse  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  with  respect  to  the  use  of \ndomestic consultants. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n60. \nThe  project  components  focus  on  activities  in  which  the  Lao  PDR  has  an  underlying \ncomparative  advantage  and  which  offer  smallholder  farmers  opportunities  for  increased  food \nsecurity and greater incomes. The Project has an estimated base case economic internal rate of \nreturn  (EIRR)  of  19.9%.  The  bulk  of  project  benefits  will  come  from  increments  of  rice,  dry \nseason field and vegetable crops, and reductions in vehicle operating costs (the latter comprise \nabout  one  fifth  of  the  total  project  benefits).  Nonquantified/valued  benefits  include  those  from \nlivestock  and  fisheries  demonstrations,  greater  levels  of  smallholder  technical  and  business \nskills,  greater  levels  of  agribusiness  activities  and  improved  social  cohesion.  The  Project  is \nrelatively  robust  (if  costs  go  up  20%  the  EIRR  is  17.0%)  and  risk-free\u2014the  probability  of  the \nactual  EIRR  being  less  than  the  opportunity  cost  of  capital  is  low.  The  estimated  financial \ninternal rate of return is some 17.8%. This is lower than the EIRR, as some crop prices remain \nde  facto  affected  by  government  purchasing  policies;  despite  this,  the  proposed  project \ninterventions  are  financially  viable  and  sufficiently  attractive  at  the  farm  level  to  encourage \nsmallholder  participation  (see  Appendix  13).  The  main  risk  to  the  farmer  support  services \ncomponent is lack of accessibility to financial services from APB. \n \n61. \nImplementation of the farmer support services and rural infrastructure components faces \nminimal  external  risks.  The  technologies  chosen  for  implementation  have  been  tested  and \nproven before in the Lao PDR, and it is expected that substantial benefits will accrue with the \nimplementation  of  these  two  components.  The  farmer  support  services  component,  however, \nruns  certain  risks  relating  to  accessibility  of  financial  services.  Rural  finance  is  still  in  an \nembryonic stage in the Lao PDR, and is not yet fully understood and supported in a manner that \n\n\f18 \n\nenables  rural  financial  institutions  to  operate  in  a  sustainable  manner.  The  ADB  TA  on  Rural \nFinance  Development  and  the  proposed  Banking  Sector  Reform  Program  are  expected  to \nimprove the enabling environment and support the creation of credit cooperatives. \n \nThe  bigger  risk  to  the  Project  is  to  the  agribusiness  and  marketing  development \n62. \ncomponent. The Lao PDR is still seen as a risky place to invest. The success of this component \ntherefore  depends  on  improvements  in  the  enabling  environment  for  agribusiness.  This \nincludes, especially, proper implementation at the local level of national policies prohibiting price \nceilings, monopoly protection, and internal trade restrictions, as well as reductions in extralegal \nrent seeking by local officials. Implementation of a supportive enabling environment will be the \nsubject of specific assurances and ongoing loan covenants, and will be monitored in terms of its \nimpact on businesses and entrepreneurs receiving business support services from the Project. \nThe success of this component also depends on the supply of credit increasing due to reforms \npromoted  through  other  projects  in  the  financial  sector  (e.g.,  the  ADB-financed  Rural  Finance \nTA and Banking Sector Reform Program Loan). While these risks are real, they will be mitigated \nby TA to identify creditworthy businesses and assisting those businesses to put together good \nbusiness  plans  and  credit  applications.  They  will  also  be  addressed  through  training  of  local \nofficials  and  promotion  of  policy  dialogue  between  officials  and  agribusinesses.  Moreover,  the \nBanking  Sector  Reform  Program  Loan  will  support  needed  reforms  in  the  area  of  contract \nenforcement that will also improve the investment environment. \n \n63. \nThe Project is expected to reduce food insecurity and increase incomes of households \nliving  below  the  poverty  line,  which  constitute  approximately  22%  of  total  households  in  the \nproject  area,  through  provision  of  appropriate  technology,  improved  livestock  production  and \nmaintenance  practices,  and  participatory  training  and  extension.  Female-headed  households, \nwhich  constitute  14%  of  total  households  in  the  project  area,  are  expected  to  benefit  from \nimproved  access  to  new  technologies,  group-based  activities  including  financial  training  and \nservices, improved market access, and opportunities for self employment. \n \n64. \nInvoluntary  Resettlement \nFramework (Appendix 6) detailing the types of expected impacts and the entitlements matrix for \ndifferent  types  of  affected  persons/households,  as  well  as  a  sample  Resettlement  Plan \nInvoluntary \n(Supplementary  Appendix  H)  prepared \nResettlement.  All  resettlement  plans  to  be  subsequently  prepared  under  the  Project  will  be \nsubmitted for prior ADB approval and resettlement impacts will be monitored as part of Project \nmonitoring and evaluation. \n \n\nin  keeping  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \n\nimpacts  will  be  addressed \n\nResettlements \n\nthrough \n\nthe \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  ADB  will  seek  from  the  Government,  at  loan \n\n65. \nnegotiations, assurances that include but will not necessarily be limited to the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\nThe  Government  will  take  all  measures  necessary  to  implement,  to  the \nsatisfaction  of  ADB,  the  resettlement  plans  developed  for  project  roads  and \nmarkets. The Borrower will be responsible for the acquisition of the land required \nfor  the  Project  and,  if  required,  relocation  and  resettlement  of  Project-affected \npeople.  The  Borrower  will  ensure  that  such  land  acquisition,  compensation, \nrelocation, and resettlement are carried out in accordance with the resettlement \nframework and sample resettlement plan agreed upon between the Borrower and \n\n\f \n\n19 \n\nthe  ADB,  the  Borrower's  procedures,  and  ADB's  requirements  as  defined  in  its \nPolicy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement.  In  case  of  discrepancies  between  the \nBorrower's  procedures  and  ADB's  requirements,  ADB's  requirements  will  apply. \nThe Borrower will promptly inform ADB of any such discrepancies. The Borrower \nwill  provide  ADB  with  monthly  status  reports  on  the  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement process. The Government will ensure that all people affected by the \nProject are compensated and resettled and rehabilitated in accordance with the \nrequirements  of  the  resettlement  framework  and  resettlement  plans,  the \nGovernment's  procedures,  and  ADB's  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement. \nWithout  limitation  to  the  overall  application  of  the  ADB's  Policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement, the following principles will apply in respect of compensation and \nresettlement of Project-affected people: \n \n(a) \n\nProject-affected people will be compensated and assisted in such a way \nthat  their  economic  and  social  future  will  generally  not  be  unfavorably \naffected by the Project and, in particular, that they will not face a material \nreduction  in  income,  deterioration  of  living  standards,  or  unnecessary \nsocial and cultural dislocation as a result of the Project, \nProject-affected people will not be required to have formal legal title to the \nland used by them to be eligible for compensation, \nThe  amount  of  compensation  in  respect  of  land  acquisition  will  be  at  a \nlevel  sufficient  to  cover  the  full  replacement  cost  of  the  land  and  the \nstructures built thereon,  \nAll  compensation  and  resettlement  activities  will  be  satisfactorily \ncompleted before ADB will give approval to award the civil works contract. \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n \nNo price ceilings on agricultural commodities or livestock will be imposed in the \nproject areas. \n \nNo  restrictions  will  be  imposed  on  the  movement  or  sale  of  agricultural \ncommodities, livestock, or related processed products in the project areas other \nthan those that are reasonable for the purposes of disease control and sanitation. \n \nThe  appropriate  authorities  will  provide  clear,  written  information  regarding  the \nterms and requirements of operating a business to prospective, new, and existing \nagribusinesses  that  request  such  information.  This  information  will  include,  but \nnot  necessarily  be  limited  to,  tax  rates,  leasing  and  other  fees,  registration  and \nlicensing procedures, and conditions and restrictions on reselling the business. \n\nLabor-based  equipment-assisted \nroad  construction, \nrehabilitation, and maintenance under the Project will be used wherever possible; \nemployment will be voluntary; and workers hired for this work will be paid a fair \nmarket wage. \n\ntechnology \n\nrural \n\nfor \n\nThe province and/or the Department of Roads in the MCTPC, as appropriate, will \nprovide adequate funding for routine maintenance of all project roads. \n\nAPB assures that appropriate loans will be provided to farmers under the Project. \n\n \n(vii) \n \n(viii)  The  province  and  the  Science  and  Environment  Unit  of  MCTPC,  as  well  as \nSTEA, assures that all relevant Government and ADB guidelines on environment \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n\f20 \n\n \nB. \n\n67. \n \nD. \n\n \n(ix) \n\nmanagement  of  project \nimplementation. \n\nintervention  will  be  strictly \n\nfollowed  during \n\nPrior  to  survey  and  design,  all  project  road  alignments  will  be  surveyed  and  (if \nnecessary) cleared of unexploded ordnance according to accepted international \npractice. \n\nConditions for Award of Contract for Civil Works \n\n66. \nADB  will  not  approve  the  award  of  any  civil  works  contract  for  any  component  to  be \nfinanced from the loan proceeds for which there is land acquisition, unless the Government has \ncompleted  satisfactorily  and  in  accordance  with  the  approved  resettlement  plan  for  that \ncomponent  compensation  payment  and  relocation  to  new  sites,  and  ensured  rehabilitation \nassistance is in place prior to obtaining possession and rights to the required land. \n \nC. \n\nConditions for Loan Negotiations \n\nPrior to loan negotiations, an NPD acceptable to ADB will be designated by MAF. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\n68. \n \n69. \nimplementation of the Project and the TA.  \n \n\nAn adequate number of appropriately qualified full-time staff will be recruited for ONPD. \n\nA  NPSC  chaired  by  the  vice  minister,  MAF,  will  be  established  to  coordinate  the \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n70. \nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSpecial Drawing Rights 9,092,000 to the Lao People's Democratic Republic for the Smallholder \nDevelopment Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of \n1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  a  term  of  32  years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n\nTADAO CHINO \nPresident \n \n\n7 November 2002 \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n 21\n\nAGRICULTURAL SECTOR ANALYSIS \n\nPerformance Indicators \n\n \nA. \n \nAgriculture  employs  85%  of  the  national  labor  force  in  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic \n1. \nRepublic (Lao PDR) and is the largest contributor to the national gross domestic product (GDP) \n(at  around  53%  of  the  total  in  2001).  In  2001,  rice  contributed  68.4%  to  the  agricultural  GDP, \nwhile  livestock  contributed  27.7%  and  nonrice  crops  3.9%.  Industry  and  services  have  been \ncontributing  an  increasing  amount  to  the  national  GDP  in  recent  years  (their  contribution  was \napproximately 22% and 25%, respectively in 2001). Although agriculture remains the dominant \nsector  of  the  national  economy,  investments  in  the  sector  from  all  sources  (external  and \nGovernment)  have  averaged  less  than  19%  of  the  national  budget.  Agricultural  growth  was \nabout 4% in 2001, less robust than in previous years. With primary production being largely for \nsubsistence  and  not  being  well  integrated  into  a  subregional  or  regional  economy,  agriculture \nhas been partly insulated from the effects of the regional financial crisis. \n \nThe  majority  of  farmers  practice  subsistence  agriculture,  and  poverty  is  widespread. \n2. \nWhile the national poverty rate is 39%, the rate in rural areas is 43.8%, and the rural poor make \nup 87% of the country\u2019s poor.1 Agricultural productivity remains low at about $199/worker-year. \nThis  is  compared  with  $331/worker-year  in  Viet  Nam  and  $347/worker-year  in  Thailand.2  The \naverage  household  income  from  farming  is  about  $200/hectare  (ha).  This  is  compared  with \n$357/ha in Thailand and $320/ha in Viet Nam. \n \n3. \nRice  is  the  anchor  of  the  farming  system.  Rice  accounts  for  over  90%  of  total  crop \nproduction.  Nearly  95%  of  farming  households  grow  rice  for  their  own  use.  Glutinous  rice \naccounts  for  over  90%  of  total  planted  area.  Rice  yields  are  low  by  Asian  standards.  Figures \nvary  by  source  and  across  different  parts  of  the  country,  according  to  whether  irrigation  is \navailable or not, and between upland and lowland areas, but overall national average yields are \nwithin  the  relatively  low  range  of  1.5  to  2.5  tons/ha/crop.3  However,  for  the  wide  majority  of \nrainfed (i.e., non-irrigated) rice farmers, yields are closer to 2 tons/ha and below.4  Because of \nhigh  postharvest  and  milling  losses  (55\u201360%),  Lao  PDR  needs  to  produce  400  kg  of \npaddy/capita to obtain the 180 kg/capita of milled rice consumed. With a population of 5 million \npeople,  it  needs  to  produce  2  million  tons  annually  for  rice  self-sufficiency.  The  country  has \nexperienced  rice  deficits  consistently  until  1998,  when  it  began  to  achieve  a  small  surplus.5 \nProduction needs to increase by 50,000 tons annually to keep pace with the population growth \nrate of 2.6% per year. \n \n4. \nRice is a subsistence crop when consumed but becomes a cash crop when sold. As a \ncash  crop,  rice  has  consistently  outperformed  several  alternatives.  Ten-year  gross  margin \ntrends (1990\u20132000) show (i) rice at $228\u2013$364/ha; (ii) soybean, $138\u2013$272/ha; and (iii) maize, \n$61\u2013116/ha.6  Farming  systems  diversification  depends  on  the  ability  of  farming  households  to \n\n                                                 \n1  Lao PDR. 1997/98.  Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey (LECS 2). \n2  Calculated  from  LECS2-1997/98  and  national  census  and  income  data  and  from  statistics  provided  through \n\nnational web sites.  \n\ninterviews with farmers.  \n\n3  This is compared with 2.5\u20133.5 tons/ha/crop in Thailand and 3.5\u20134.2 tons/ha/crop in Viet Nam. \n4  There  are  discrepancies  between  official  rice  yield  data  and  sampled  data  from  crop  cutting  surveys  and  from \n\n5  Rice production increased from 1.5 million tons in 1989 to 2.3 million tons in 2001. The increase in production is \nattributed  to  (i)  expansion  of  minor  irrigation  (40%),  and  (ii)  development  and  release  of  improved  rice  varieties \ndeveloped by International Rice Research Institute/National Agriculture and Forestry Research Institute. \n\n6   Price x yield @ real exchange rate - losses.   \n\n\f \n22 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nSupply Side Constraints \n\nmaintain  rice  security.  When  this  is  achieved,  resources  are  released  for  cultivation  of \nnonsubsistence cash crops including commercial rice (both glutinous and specialty), field crops, \nand  specialty  products  such  as  nontimber  forest  products.  The  choice  of  options  depends  on \nfarmer  availability  of  market  information,  physical  access  to  markets,  availability  of  technology \nand inputs, and access to capital and credit facilities.  \n \nB. \n \nFarming  households  living  along  the  Mekong  floodplains,  where  most  of  the  country\u2019s \n5. \nrice is produced, are vulnerable to natural disasters (flooding and draught), which are occurring \nwith  increasing  frequency.  Household  rice  security  is  the  number  one  priority  for  farmers.  In \ngeneral,  agricultural  production  remains  characterized  by  low  productivity  due  to  inefficient \npractices  (e.g.,  traditional  and  outdated  cultivation  practices,  inefficient  irrigation  water \nmanagement  systems,  etc.),  inadequate  processing  technology  (especially  in  the  rice  milling \nsector), and a lack of timely and adequate inputs supplies. Input use is very low.7 Only 28% of \nhouseholds  used  chemical  fertilizer  in  1998/99,  only  11%  used  pesticides  in  the  same  period, \nand less than a third used any form of mechanization. Low input use by farmers is attributed to \n(i) limited number of input suppliers;8 (ii) lack of information concerning input use created by the \nabsence  of  viable  extension  mechanisms  (both  public  and  private  sector)  throughout  the \ncountry;9  (iii)  lack  of  adequate  working  capital  among  the  poorest  and  the  smallest  of \nsmallholder producers; and (iv) general lack of access to markets because of physical barriers \ncreated  by  poor  roads,  high  transport  costs,10  and  a  constrained  marketing  system  wherein  a \nlimited number of traders tend to dominate market transactions for produce that moves beyond \nvillage boundaries to the next link in the marketing chain.11 \n \n6. \nNearly  one  half  of  households  keep  buffaloes  for  draught  power,  about  one  third  have \ncattle  and  pigs,  and  poultry  raising  is  also  common.    Although  the  volume  of  the  informal \nlivestock  trade  is  considerable,  widespread  animal  diseases  prohibit  more  extensive  formal \nexports.  The majority of households grow some vegetables for home consumption, and some \nmarket these nonrice crops if located near urban centers. Lack of transport, market access, and \nknowledge  of  markets  are  the  major  constraints  to  boosting  commercial  marketing  by \n\n                                                 \n7 On average, Lao farmers, using NPK fertilizer, apply 10-20 kilograms (kg)/ha compared with 70\u201380 kg/ha in Viet \nNam and Thailand. Although improved seed varieties have been developed and released, the majority of Lao rice \nfarmers still use traditional varieties. \n\n8  There are only 57 very small input supply outlets with an average monthly turnover of 500\u20132,000 kg per outlet in \nmonthly fertilizer sales in the entire Mekong corridor area of Lao PDR. 1999. The Government\u2019s Strategic Vision for \nthe Agricultural Sector. MAF. Lao PDR. \n\n9  Although  MAF  has  some  6,000  employees  working  at  the  Provincial  Agriculture  and  Forestry  Services/District \nAgriculture  and  Forestry  Office  level,  the  extension  of  productivity-enhancing  technology  to  farmers  has  not \noccurred, except where individual aid agencies have supported extension in pilot areas at the local level. The major \ncauses of MAF\u2019s heretofore inability to deliver effective extension to farmers are (i) general lack of subject matter \nand  extension  skills  among  extension  personnel;  (ii)  lack  of  logistical  support;  and  (iii)  lack  of  incentive,  since \nextension workers only about $15 per month. The private sector has not responded to extension needs because of \nthe  limited  size  of  domestic  markets,  the  dearth  of  agribusinesses,  and  very  limited  number  of  input  suppliers \nthroughout the Lao PDR. \n\n10  Transport  costs  in  Laos  average  7.5  baht  per  ton-km  on  good  roads  and  13.1  baht/ton-km  on  poor  roads.  In \n\nThailand, the average transport cost is 3.2 baht/ton-km. \n\n11 Marketing costs and margins for raw produce trade between the farmgate and retail markets in Vientiane add some \n84%  to  the  cost  for  urban  consumers.  This  is  compared  with  an  average  23%  in  Thailand.  The  difference \nrepresents lower Thai transport costs as well as higher Thai market chain efficiency from economies of scale within \na  more  competitive  marketing  environment  with  less  government  regulation  and  interference  in  marketing \nmechanisms. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n 23\n\nAgricultural Marketing and Demand Side Constraints \n\nsmallholder  households.  Overall,  nonrice  crop  production12  and  quality  remain  low  even  in  the \nmost highly productive agricultural areas because of low technical expertise, limited access to \ndomestic and international markets for inputs and outputs, and low domestic demand because \nof  limited  market  size  (the  2002  population  is  some  5.2  million)  and  dearth  of  local \nagribusiness.13 \n \nC. \n \nIn  general,  agricultural  marketing  suffers  from  a  lack  of  physical  access  to  produce \n7. \nmarkets related to poor infrastructure.  Primary market infrastructure is informal and lacks basic \namenities (access, communications, covered areas, cement floors, secure stall spaces). There \nare  significant  gaps  in  the  marketing  chain  from  producers  to  retailers.  The  marketing  chain \nsuffers  from  inadequate  competition  and  is  constrained  by  poor  physical  access  and  limited \nproduce  supplies.  For  example,  there  is  an  acute  shortage  of  primary  market  facilities  for \nfarmers  to  trade  their  produce  to  retailers  and  wholesalers.  This  constraint  both  causes  a \nshortage  of  wholesalers  and  traders  for  agricultural  produce  (particularly  nonrice)  and  creates \ninefficiency in the marketing system.  \n \n8. \nThe  marketing  of  agricultural  products  in  Lao  PDR  tends  to  be  regionally  confined, \nresulting  in  significant  variation  in  market  prices  from  region  to  region.    Such  regionally \nunbalanced  markets  are  created  by  (i)  formal  and  informal  regulations  that  prevent  free \nmovement of goods, (ii) prohibitive fees and administrative costs, (iii) poor access roads and an \nunderdeveloped  farm-to-market  road  network,  (iv)  transportation  shortages  and  high  transport \ncosts, (v) small urban demand, and (vi) interregional transport fees and controls in Lao PDR. \n \n9. \nThere are several channels for marketing of agricultural produce.  The State Enterprises \nfor Food and Crop Promotion (SEFCP), import-export companies, commercial associations, and \nprocessing  factories  buy  rice,  meat,  and  other  food  commodities  from  local  markets  or \nmiddlemen.  For  purchase  of  rice,  middlemen  usually  visit  and  buy  directly  from  individual \nhouseholds  during  the  harvesting  period.  For  nonrice  produce,  farmers  usually  must  do  their \nown marketing. There are 448 wholesale and retail produce markets in the Lao PDR. Of these, \n13 are privately owned and managed, 101 are Government-leased and privately managed, 73 \nare  managed  by  provincial  and  district  administrations  and  the  remaining  261  are  village  and \ncommunity  managed.14  No  markets  handling  fresh  food  have  cooling  facilities  or  display \ncabinets. Fresh foods are displayed on tables with little regard for sanitation or quality grading. \nIn  general,  market  areas  are  small  and \nlimited,  and  buyers  accept  ungraded  and \nundifferentiated produce. \n \n10. \nAgricultural  rice  marketing  remains  dominated  by  the  public  sector.  SEFCP  has  a \ncommanding share of the market for paddy (70%), with the remaining 30% share in the hands \nof private entrepreneurs.15 \n \n\n                                                 \n12 For Lao PDR, as a whole, the diversification ratio (DR) is 0.21. The DR is defined as the nonrice cropped area/total \ncropped area for all crops. For Thailand, in spite of its role as a major international rice producer, the DR is 0.59. \nLao maize yields are about 1 ton/ha, compared with 5\u20136 tons in Thailand. \n\n13 Lao maize yields are about 1 ton/ha,  compared with 5\u20136 tons in Thailand. Soybean yields in Lao PDR are some \n\n2\u20133 times lower than in Thailand and Viet Nam. \n\n14  Source: Ministry of Commerce. \n15 5% of Lao PDR\u2019s total production of 2.3 million tons is marketed rather than consumed by smallholder producing \n\nhouseholds. \n\n\f \n24 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nThere is no established market information system. The sole market information sources \n11. \nare  SEFCP  and  private  traders.  The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Forestry  has  a  market \ninformation  collection  system,  but  the  output  appears  in  annual  statistical  reports  that  do  not \nreach farmers or traders. There are critical needs for improved market access in rural areas, for \nstrengthening of marketing chains, and for lifting of regulations and barriers to free competitive \nmarket competition. \n \n12. \nOver half of the villages nationwide are more than 10 kilometers (km) from the nearest \nmarket, and more than 35% are more than 6 km from a dry season access road and more than \n15  km  from  an  all  weather  road.16  Compared  with  neighboring  countries,  the  Lao  PDR  has  a \nsmall  population,  which  partly  explains  the  lower  level  of  marketing  activity.  Large-scale \nwholesale trade in agricultural commodities is the exception. Most products are sold directly by \nfarmers,  or  by  small  traders  (collectors)  to  the  market  retailers  in  the  towns.  Transport  is  by \nhand-tractor and trailers, small three-wheeled vehicles and pick-up trucks.   \n \n13. \nPotential  international  agribusiness  investors  perceive  the  Lao  PDR  to  be  a  high-risk \ncountry  in  which  to  conduct  business.  There  are  high  transaction  costs  for  registrations  and \nother administrative processes, and the weak and sometimes contradictory, and often opaque \nlegal  framework  imposes  extra  burdens  in  this  regard.  Further,  nontariff  barriers  and  other \nborder  irregularities  predominate,  and  potential  investors  flag  the  poor  raw  material  supply \nresponse of farmers as an additional constraint to agribusiness viability.    \n  \n14. \nThe  main  constraints  to  local  agribusiness  investments  include  lack  of  business \nexpertise and understanding of markets, lack of liquidity and access to credit, the limited size of \nthe private sector, and the long payback period for agribusiness investments (usually 5 years or \nmore). \n \nD. \n \n15. \nImmediately  adjacent  to  the  Lao  PDR  borders  live  at  least  200  million  Thais,  Chinese, \nand  Vietnamese.  As  industrial  development  accelerates  in  these  three  countries,  paddy  and \nagricultural land resources are shifting to the non-agriculture sectors. There is a corresponding \ndecline  in  domestic  food  production  amid  their  growing  populations.  As  a  result,  these \npopulations  could  become  significant  consumers  of  rice,  livestock,  vegetables,  and  other  farm \nproduce from the Lao PDR and other neighboring countries. \n \nSince its move towards a market economy, a number of private investors (both local and \n16. \nforeign) have established agroprocessing units within the country. This has created demand in \nthe  areas  near  the  processing  plants.  With  the  development  of  urban  areas,  the  domestic \nmarket for diversified agricultural output has grown. There is additional purchasing interest from \nforeign  buyers,  notably  from  Thailand,  but  also  from  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  Viet \nNam. Coffee, peanut, soybean, mungbean, corn, livestock, fisheries, nontimber forest products, \ncotton, fruits, and vegetables are products in demand. Some farmers are already responding to \nthese market opportunities \n \n17. \nTo  stimulate  growth  in  agriculture  and  raise  rural  incomes,  there  is  an  opportunity  to \nmove beyond subsistence farming to more diversified, commercial agricultural production.

In  November  1999,  with  ADB  assistance  under  TA  2883-LAO: \nAgriculture  Strategy  Study,17  the  Government  presented  its  strategic  vision  for  the  agriculture \nsector at a conference of aid agencies. The strategy focused on (i) increasing rural income by \ndeveloping  market-oriented  agriculture,  and  changing  public  institutions  and  policies  to  better \nserve this aim; (ii) recognizing the preeminent role of the private sector and working to improve \nthe business and investment environment; (iii) achieving a better balance in investments in the \nsector;18 (iv) addressing the respective opportunities and constraints of the country\u2019s upland and \nlowland  farming  systems  and  communities;  (v)  improving  environmental  management  of  the \ncounty\u2019s  natural  resources;  and  (vi)  improving  and  sustaining  investments  made  in  supporting \ninfrastructure (primarily irrigation and rural roads). The agriculture strategy study demonstrated \nthat  for  a  range  of  crops  (including  rice,  maize,  groundnut,  cotton,  sugarcane,  and  coffee)  the \ncountry\u2019s  production  is  competitive  in  the  region  and,  with  the  application  of  improved \ntechnology,  it  could  be  among  the  world\u2019s  low-cost  producers  of  several  commodities.  The \nGovernment  has  affirmed  its  commitment  to  trade  liberalization.19  In  this  context,  the \nGovernment views assistance with the promotion of market-oriented, diversified agriculture (and \nits  own  Commodity  Development  Program)  as  key  to  improving  smallholder  livelihood  and \nexpanding the nation\u2019s economy. \n \nTo  improve  rural  livelihoods  through  increased  production  of  higher  value  crops,  the \n19. \nGovernment  seeks  to  (i)  strengthen  its  adaptive  research  and  extension  services;  (ii)  facilitate \nthe  development  of  private  sector  trade  and  agroprocessing;  (iii)  improve  farmers\u2019  access  to \nmarket  information  and  supporting  infrastructure;  and  (iv)  increase  the  availability  of  credit  for \nfarmers, traders, and processors. In essence, the Government views commodity production as \nbeing market driven, with the initiatives coming from the private sector. The Government views \nits role as a facilitator to assist and advise smallholder farmers and to encourage their linkages \nto markets, traders, and processors. \n\n                                                 \n17  ADB. 1997.

Agriculture is mainly subsistence oriented, \nand remains characterized by low productivity due to inefficient practices, lack of access to appropriate extension and \ntraining services, inadequate technology, lack of access to inputs, lack of access to institutional financing, as well as \naccess to markets. Rice is the major crop produced, and yields are low by Asian standards. It is grown mainly for food \nsecurity. Poor households are characterized by high levels of dependency and low labor productivity, and suffer from \nfood  insecurity.  Female-headed  households  often  fall  into  this  category.    Improved  productivity  of  rice  through \nimproved wet season rice production can contribute significantly towards reducing food insecurity for poor households, \nand  help  to  free  up  land  for  growing  marketable  crops  such  as  vegetables,  maize,  and  soybean.  There  is  a  ready \nmarket for such produce in neighboring countries such as Thailand and Vietnam.

A  resettlement  framework  for  this  Project  was  prepared  to  meet  the \nrequirements of a sector-like approach. This framework is based on ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary \nResettlement and Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice and will be applied to \nall  subproject  roads  and  markets  where  there  will  be  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  This \nframework presents the specific policies and guidelines to guide the process for land acquisition \nand  resettlement.  A  sample  resettlement  plan  (RP)  was  prepared  for  Songkhone-Thapasoun \nroad. For each of the remaining subproject roads and markets, an RP will be prepared by the \ndepartment  of  communication,  transport,  post  and  construction-provincial  project  office \n(DCTPC-PPO),  together  with  the  local  administrative  authorities  and  compensation  and \nresettlement committees during project implementation.   \n \n2. \nScope  and  Scale  of  Resettlement.  The  rural  access  road  component  comprises \n(i) rehabilitation of a total of 89.5 kilometers (km) of roads, (ii) construction of a total of 80.8 km \nof  roads,  and  (iii)  construction  of  three  bridges  (196  meters).    Most  of  the  proposed  road \nconstruction and rehabilitation will be made within existing rights-of-way, for which no significant \nresettlement will be required. In some portions of roads, however, civil works would require an \nestimated  125,000  square  meters  (m2)  of  land  acquisition  (both  homestead  and  agricultural \nland).  No relocation of people is expected, however, there may be some market kiosks affected.  \nWith  the  exception  of  the  Songkhone-Thapasoun  road,  for  which  an  RP  was  prepared  before \nappraisal,  the  details  of  numbers  of  affected  households  and  type  and  area  of  land  to  be \nacquired  from  each  household  will  be  determined  during  project  implementation,  when \nalignment and scope of civil works are finalized. Construction of 15 market centers with a total \ncovered  (roofed)  area  of  22,400  m2  (126,000  m2  total  \u201copen\u201d  or  fenced  area)  is  also  planned \nunder  this  infrastructure  component.  These  market  centers  consist  of  nine  small-sized  market \ncenters  and  six  medium-sized  market  centers.  The  scope  of  land  acquisition  is  not  known  to \ndate.  \n \n3. \nResettlement  Policy. The resettlement policy framework for the Project has been built \nupon  the  laws  of  the  Government  of  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR),  the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995),  and  the  draft \nnational resettlement policy.1 This Project will be bound by the principles and conditions stated \nin the resettlement framework that will be approved by the ADB and the provincial government. \nIf there are any discrepancies between ADB and government policy, ADB policy will supersede. \nThe principles and objectives are to ensure that all affected people (APs) will be compensated \nfor their losses at replacement cost and provided with rehabilitation measures in order to assist \nthem  to  improve,  or  at  least  maintain,  their  pre-project  living  standards  and  income  earning \ncapacity. \n \nProject Affected People. The APs include the following persons to be identified during \n4. \ncensus  for  each  of  the  subprojects  roads  and  markets  where  there  is  land,  property,  asset \nacquisition, or resettlement involved: \n \n\n(i) \n\npersons  whose  agricultural,  residential,  or  commercial  land  is  in  part  or  in  total \naffected (temporarily or permanently) by the Project, \n\n                                                 \n1  A  draft  national  resettlement  policy  was  prepared  by  the  Lao  PDR  Government  in  1995  and  presented  by  the \nScience,  Technology  and  Environment  Agency  to  the  ADB  RETA  5935  Regional  Workshop  on  National \nResettlement  Policy  Enhancement  and  Capacity  Building  at  ADB  Headquarters  in  2002.    The  draft  policy  is  the \nbasis  for  a  ministerial  decree  on  resettlement  that  is  being  prepared  under  the  Environment  and  Social  Program \nLoan 1867-LAO, approved on 6 December 2001. \n\n\f(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n35\n\npersons  whose  houses  and  other  structures  are  in  part  or  in  total  affected \n(temporarily or permanently) by the Project, \npersons  whose  businesses  or  source  of  income  are  in  part  or  in  total  affected \n(temporarily or permanently) by the Project, \npersons  whose  crops  (annual  and  perennial)  and  trees  are  affected  by  the \nProject, and  \npersons  whose  other  assets  are  in  part  or  in  total  affected  (temporarily  or \npermanently) by the Project. \n\nPrinciples and Objectives. The following principles and objectives will be applied: \n\n \n5. \n\n \n\nAcquisition  of  land  and  other  assets,  and  resettlement  of  people  will  be \nminimized as much as possible. \nThe  census  or  inventory  of  losses  to  be  carried  out  as  part  of  the  resettlement \nplanning process for the infrastructure subprojects will represent the cut-off date \nfor eligibility.  Eligible persons are entitled to be provided with compensation and \nrehabilitation  measures  sufficient  to  assist  them  to  improve  or  at  least  maintain \ntheir preproject living standards, income earning capacity, and production levels.   \nLack  of  formal  legal  rights  to  the  assets  lost  will  not  prevent  APs  from \ncompensation and rehabilitation measures. \nPlans  for  land  acquisition  and  other  assets,  provision  of  replacement  land,  and \nrehabilitation measures will be carried out in consultation with the APs to ensure \nminimal disturbance. \nCompensation  rates  for  physical  assets  (land,  house/building/other  structures) \nand  nonphysical  assets  (lost  income  from  productive  assets  or  jobs)  will  be \ncalculated  at  replacement  cost  or  current  market  value  at  the  time  of \ncompensation. \nAPs  that  stand  to  lose  only  part  of  their  physical  assets  will  not  be  left  with  a \nproportion that will be inadequate to sustain their current standard of living, such \nminimum size being identified and agreed upon during the resettlement planning \nprocess. \nAffected  populations  will  be  systematically  informed  and  consulted  about  the \nProject,  the  rights  and  options  available  to  them,  and  proposed  mitigating \nmeasures, and to the extent possible be involved in the decisions that are made \nconcerning their resettlement.  \n\n(x) \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  The  consultative  process  will  include  not  only  those  affected,  but  also \nrepresentatives  of  the  local  governments  of  the  areas  in  which  the  Project  is \nlocated,  host  communities'  community  leaders,  civil  society,  organizations  such \nas nongovernment organizations, and members of local people\u2019s organizations.   \nExisting cultural and religious practices will be respected and, to maximum extent \npractical, preserved. \nSpecial measures will be incorporated in the resettlement plan to protect socially \nand  economically  vulnerable  groups  such  as  the  ethnic  minorities,  women-\nheaded households, children, and elderly people without support structures, and \npeople living in extreme poverty. \nThe  previous  level  of  community  services  and  resources  will  be  improved  after \nresettlement. \nThere will be effective mechanisms for hearing and resolving grievances during \nthe preparation and implementation of the RP. \n\n(xii) \n\n(xi) \n\n\f \n36 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n(xiii)  The compensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation activities will be satisfactorily \ncompleted before a no-objection from ADB will be provided for award of contract \nof civil works under each subcomponent.  \n\n(xiv)  The Executing Agency will see to it that institutional arrangements are in place to \nensure effective and timely design, planning, consultation, and implementation of \nthe land acquisition, compensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation program. \n\n(xv)  Where  a  host  community  is  affected  by  the  resettlement  of  others  into  that \ncommunity, the host community will be involved in any resettlement planning and \ndecision-making.  All  attempts  will  be  made  to  minimize  the  adverse  impacts  of \nresettlement upon host communities. \n\n(xvi)  Adequate budgetary support will be fully committed and made available to cover \nthe  costs  of \nthe  agreed  upon \nimplementation period. Owing to practices established under current government \nprocedures, clear budget commitments are required for critical activities such as \nformal  detailed  physical  surveys  and  administrative  functions  associated  with \ncompensation and resettlement. \n\nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  within \n\n(xvii)  Appropriate reporting (including auditing and redress functions), monitoring, and \nevaluation  mechanisms,  will  be  identified  and  set  in  place  as  part  of  the \nresettlement management system.  \n\n(xviii)  Construction activities will not commence until the required lands have been fully \nin \n\nacquired  and  populations  appropriately  compensated  and \naccordance with the principles set out above. \n\nrelocated \n\n \n6. \nEntitlement  Matrix.    The  Project  entitlements  have  been  designed  to  provide \ncompensation,  resettlement,  and  rehabilitation  for  lost  assets  and  restore  or  enhance  the \nlivelihoods of all categories of affected people. The entitlement matrix for the Project (Table A6) \nsummarizes the main types of losses and the support entitled for each type of loss. \n \n\nTable A6: Entitlement Matrix \n \n\nType of Loss \n\nEntitled Persons \n\nI.

The  APs  will  participate  throughout  the  various  stages  of  the \n7. \nplanning and implementation of the RPs. The APs will be fully informed by the relevant agencies \nrelated  to  entitlements,  compensation,  and  rehabilitation  options  and  grievance  mechanisms \nunder the RPs. This can be in a form of a project information booklet written in a language that \ncan be easily understood by the APs and issued to APs before Project appraisal.  \n \n8. \nImplementation Arrangements.  MCTPC, through the Environment and Social Division \nof the Department of Roads, will oversee the RP activities of the concerned PPO and provide \ntechnical  assistance  if  necessary.  The  DCTPC-PPO  will  be  responsible  for  all  components  of \nthe  subprojects  including  the  RP.    Full-time  resettlement  officers  at  the  provincial  and  district \nlevels  will  be  designated  and  will  be  responsible  for  all  resettlement-related  activities.  The \nDCTPC-PPO  will  submit  all  subproject  RPs  to  ADB.  A  compensation  and  resettlement \ncommittee will be formed at various administrative levels to seek inputs from stakeholders in the \ndecision-making and implementation of the resettlement framework. The affected persons and \nminority groups will also be represented in those committees and be included in the grievance \nresolutions concerning compensation and other resettlement benefits.  \n \n9. \nImplementation  Schedule.  The  RP  for  each  subproject  will  be  prepared  following  the \ncompletion  of  detailed  design  for  that  subproject.  Satisfactory  payment  of  compensation  and \nprovision of other rehabilitation entitlements and relocation if that be the case, will be completed \nbefore  a  no-objection  from  ADB  can  be  provided  for  award  of  civil  works  contract  under  each \nsubproject. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n39\n\nComplaints  and  Grievances.  In  terms  of  grievance  redressals,  the  APs  will  be  made \n10. \nfully  aware  of  their  rights  to  grievance  and  the  procedures  both  verbally  and  in  writing  during \nconsultation,  survey,  and  time  of  compensation.  The  APs  may  present  their  complaints  to  the \nconcerned  local  administrative  officials  and  compensation  and  resettlement  committees.    The \ncomplaint  can  be  filed  first  at  the  village  level  and  can  then  be  elevated  to  the  highest  or \nprovincial  level  if  the  APs  are  not  satisfied  with  the  decisions  made  by  the  village  and  district \nlevels/committees. APs will be exempted from all taxes and administrative and legal fees. \n \nSupervision, Monitoring, and Evaluation. The DCTPC-PPOs in collaboration with the \n11. \nlocal administrative authorities and compensation and resettlement committees, are responsible \nfor internal monitoring of RP implementation. The resettlement specialist and consultants under \nthe  loan  will  monitor  resettlement  implementation  periodically.  Once  the  land  acquisition  and \nthe  DCTPC-PPOs  will  carry  out  a \nresettlement  programs  have  been  completed, \npostresettlement  impact  evaluation  to  assess  whether  impacts  of  the  Project  have  been \nmitigated adequately and the preproject standard of living of APs has been restored as a result \nof resettlement and project activities.  \n \n12. \nCost  and  Budget.    The  RP  will  include  the  breakdown  for  each  type  of  losses  with \ncorresponding  cost  estimates  reflecting  replacement  cost  or  current  market  values.    The  cost \nestimates will make adequate provision for contingencies. The RP will also include the detailed \nschedule and procedures related to flow of RP funds. \n \n13. \nDisclosure.  In  accordance  with  ADB  policy,  the  APs  will  be  fully  informed  and  closely \nconsulted  on  resettlement  and  compensation  options.  The  subproject  implementing  agencies \nwill  translate  into  Lao  the  resettlement  framework  and  subproject  RPs,  especially  the  sections \non  (i)  policies,  and  (ii)  entitlements  of  all  categories  of  AP.  These  documents  in  Lao  will  be \nplaced at important public places in the villages, where copies can be obtained for independent \nreview and study. Project information booklets will also be prepared and distributed to all APs. \nOther means of disclosure can also be through radio and public meetings. Their comments, and \nmodifications  based  on  them,  as  relevant,  will  be  incorporated  in  the  resettlement  framework \nand updated RPs. \n \n14. \nwebsite. \n \n\nThe project resettlement framework and subproject RPs will also be disclosed on ADB\u2019s \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \n\nIntroduction \n\nA. \n \nThe  Smallholder  Development  Project  in  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao \n1. \nPDR)  is  aimed  at  strengthening  the  rural  economy  by  promoting  market-oriented,  diversified \nagricultural  production  on  smallholder  farms  and  by  improving  market  links.  However, \ndiversifying agricultural production involves various types of interventions with potential impacts \non the environment. Therefore, the Project has been classified by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) as an environment category \u201cB\u201d project. An initial environmental examination (IEE) and a \nsummary initial environmental examination (SIEE) for the whole project as well as a sample IEE \nfor a road subproject were prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s requirements for environmental \nassessment.  \n \n2. \nThe  objective  of  the  IEE  is  to  identify  impacts,  evaluate  their  severity,  recommend \nmitigation measures, and propose a monitoring plan for use in project implementation. Project \ncomponents  to  be  financed  under  the  loan  involve  institutional  adjustments,  farm  service \nextension work such as training, and various types of physical infrastructure. The IEE covers a \nwide  scope  of  potential  environmental  impacts  associated  with  these  interventions.  Many  of \nthese  impacts  occur  on  the  Project  in  only  a  minor  degree.  For  instance,  the  IEE  provides \nguidance  related  to  rangeland  management,  because  it  is  assumed  that  with  intensified \nextension activity some additional livestock rearing will occur; however the loan project will not \nfinance  improved  pasture  for  livestock  grazing,  which  is  expected  to  be  undertaken  at  the \nhousehold  level.  The  type  of  impacts  generally  associated  with  large  livestock  operations  are \nunlikely to occur.   \n \n3. \nThe SIEE follows guidelines provided in Environmental Assessment Requirements of the \nAsian  Development  Bank,  the  Environmental  Guidelines  for  Selected  Agriculture  and  Natural \nResources  Development  Projects,  and  the  Handbook  for  Incorporation  of  Integrated  Pest \nManagement  in  Agriculture  Projects.  Host  country  guidelines  taken  into  account  include  the \nEnvironmental  Protection  Law;  the  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  Regulations  of  the \nScience,  Technology,  and  Environment  Agency,  and  the  \u201cEnvironmental  Guidelines  for \nReducing  the  Environmental  Effects  of  Road  Projects  in  Lao  PDR\u201d  of  the  Ministry  of \nCommunication,  Transport,  Post,  and  Construction  (MCTPC),  which  was  issued  officially  by \nPrime Minister\u2019s Decree No: 05/PM dated 14/1/95.  \n \nB. \n \n4. \nThe  purpose  of  the  Project  is  to  promote  commercial  smallholder  agriculture  and \nassociated  agribusiness,  with  the  overall  objectives  of  achieving  sustained  increases  in  rural \nincomes  and  long-term  reductions  in  rural  poverty.  Specific  objectives  are  to  (i)  achieve \nincreased production and marketing of diversified, nonrice dry season cash crops, livestock, and \nfisheries;  (ii)  improve  smallholder  access  to  domestic  and  international  markets  and  market \ninformation; and (iii) increase investment in value-adding agribusiness.  \n\nDescription of the Project \n\n5. \nTo  achieve  these  objectives,  the  Project  has  four  components:  (i)  farmer  support \nservices to improve farmers\u2019 technical knowledge of integrated farming systems, and access to \nmarket  information  and  inputs,  (ii)  agribusiness  and  marketing  to  stimulate  investment  in \nagribusinesses,  (iii)  rural  infrastructure,  and  (iv)  project  management.  The  total  cost  of  the \nProject  over  6  years  is  estimated  at  $15.2  million  equivalent,  including  physical  and  price \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n41 \n\ncontingencies,  interest  during  construction,  taxes,  and  duties.  Of  the  total  cost,  $6.5  million  or \n43% is foreign exchange cost and $8.7 million equivalent or 57% is local currency.  \n \n6. \nThe  Project  covers  16  districts  in  four  provinces  of  the  Lao  PDR.  These  include  six \ndistricts in Savannakhet, six in Champassak, two in Khammouane, and two in Vientiane. These \nprovinces  currently  have  the  highest  potential  for  commercial  agricultural  development  where \nfactor and product markets are beginning to function and complementary infrastructure such as \nirrigation,  roads,  electricity,  and  some  agribusiness  development  is  beginning  to  emerge.  As \nwell, they present the most interest to potential foreign investors.  \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\nC. \n \nThe Project is generally centered in lowland or mid-range areas at varying elevation from \n7. \nlows of around 100 meters (m) along the Mekong River in Southern Champassak and Marketing \nLines of Communication (MLOC) areas in Savannakhet, increasing to around 200 m in the mid-\nrange Bachieng District in Champassak and Xonbuli in Savannakhet, up to a high elevation of \n1,200 m for upland reaches around Pakxong situated on the Bolovens Plateau in Champassak. \nThe two districts in Vientiane Province range in elevation from 180 to 210 m.  \n \n8. \nClimate  represents  a  significant  factor  in  agricultural  production,  determining,  for \ninstance,  the  productivity  of  coffee  in  the  Bolovens,  or  seasonal  paddy  in  the  MLOC  zones. \nClimate is not a determinant in degree of environmental impact on the present project. Rainfall \nvaries considerably throughout the country and is heaviest (more than 2,600 millimeters) in the \nupland areas of the Bolovens in the south and the highlands of Borikhamxai and Khammouan. \nLowland  areas  in  Savannakhet  and  Khammouan  are  the  driest,  experiencing  rainfall  around \n1,400 mm annually.   \n \n9. \nEcological resources and species diversity are generally high in all parts of the country, \nespecially  where  natural  environments  prevail  and  human  development  is  still  at  a  low  level.  \nForest  cover  is  about  42%  nationwide  (1999),  with  the  highest  level  of  forest  cover  in  the \nsouthern  part  of  the  country,  inclusive  of  Savannakhet  (about  59%  of  total  land  area).  Forest \ncover  is  somewhat  sparse  in  the  three  districts  in  Vientiane  Province,  and  land  use  shows  a \nmixture  of  forested  areas  (mixed  deciduous  and  dry  dipterocarp),  bamboo  and  ray  forested \nareas, scrub, and wet rice cultivation on land under agricultural use.    \n\n10. \nThe  project  areas  in  Savannakhet  Province  contain  some  degraded  dry  dipterocarp \nforest,  with  about  15%  in  scrub.  Lowland  areas  near  the  Mekong  are  dominated  by  wet  rice \ncultivation.  Paddy  dominates  throughout  the  areas  where  roadways  are  being  constructed. \nProject areas in Khammouan Province are low in elevation and dominated by paddy production \nand dry dipterocarp forest. The project area in Champassak along the river has a predominance \nof land in agricultural use under wet rice cultivation, with dry dipterocarp forest and some scrub \nand grassland. The cropped area in the districts on the right (west) bank of the river is upwards \nof 28% of the total land area. \n\n11. \nNational biodiversity conservation areas (NBCAs) make up about 14% of the total land \narea of the country in 20 separate NBCAs, with another 276 conservation or protection forests \n(International  Conservation  Union  [IUCN],  1999).  Wetlands  are  numerous  in  the  vicinity  of  the \nProject. Lowland environments throughout the Lao PDR are subject to flooding during the wet \nseason because of their flat slopes, and contain a variety of plant and animal species.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nPopulation  growth  is  high  throughout  the  country.  The  natural  reproduction  rate \n12. \nnationally is 2.6%, with the highest in Savannakhet and Champassak at 2.78\u20133.32%, and lower \nin Vientiane Province at 2.01\u20132.22%. A rate of natural reproduction intermediate between these \nrates  prevails in Khammouan  Province. Typical lifestyles of lowland culture consist of wet rice \nagriculture  in  bunded  fields  watered  by  rainfall  and  overflow  from  rivers.  Roads  are  generally \ngood  in  Vientiane  Province,  but  poorly  developed  along  the  right  (west)  bank  of  the  Mekong \nbelow Pakse, where much of the rural population resides. \n\nD. \n\nPotential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures  \n\n1. \n\nFarming Support \n\n \nThe Project will introduce new intensification technologies to smallholders to intensify the \n13. \nproduction  of  wet  season  rice,  nonrice  cash  crops  during  the  dry  season,  livestock,  and \nfisheries.  The  method  used  will  be  participatory  selection  and  adoption  of  techniques  that \nenable  farmers  to  make  sound  resource  management  decisions,  taking  into  account  the \ncontinuously  changing  environment  of  an  open  market  economy.  This  approach  is  a  farmer \ndemand-driven participatory process, which will form the basis of the national extension system \nof the National Agricultural and Forestry Extension Service (NAFES), now under development. \n\nFertilizer  use  in  the  Lao  PDR  has  been  historically  low,  but  there  is  evidence  it  is \n14. \nincreasing.  The  application  of  appropriate  technology  through  the  agriculture  extension \nagencies  can  mitigate  against  excessive  fertilizer  use.  Given  the  history  of  low  use  rates  and \nextension advice, Lao PDR farmers are not likely to excessively apply fertilizer. Streams are not \nsusceptible to eutrophication except during the low flow season, when fertilizer loss could occur \nfrom irrigated fields supporting dry season rice crops. Farmer support by the extension agencies \ninvolves routine analyses of soil samples for soil pH, nitrate, phosphorous, and potassium. The \nextension  agencies  should  provide  training  in  production  and  use  of  organic  fertilizer  and  soil \nnatural conditioning agents to supplement chemical fertilizer use, such as compost from urban, \nperiurban, and agricultural wastes.   \n \nThree  types  of  livestock  production  is  envisioned  by  provincial  officials  in  the  project \n15. \nareas,  with  increases  in  each  type  by  about  20%  over  the  next  5  years:  (i)  upland  or \nmountainous  area  grazing  within  production  forests  where  some  ground  fodder  propagates, \ninvolving cattle, buffaloes, and goats; (ii) lowland foraging among dry deciduous forest that has \nbeen  partially  converted  to  improved  pasture,  again  for  cattle,  buffaloes  and  goats;  and \n(iii) animal propagation near towns aiming at small livestock (pigs, chickens, ducks and goats). \nLivestock can have a wide range of effects on rangeland ecosystems that can be both positive \nand  negative,  and  grazing  impacts  can  be  seen  at  the  species,  community,  and  landscape \nlevels.  Therefore,  the  technology  transfer  component  of  the  proposed  Project  needs  to \nincorporate a program for monitoring effects of livestock on various ecosystem types within the \nproject area with the aim of minimizing detrimental impacts while supporting good management \npractice.  \n \n16. \nAfter  rice,  livestock  and  fisheries  are  the  most  important  ingredients  of  the  Lao  farm \nincome.  A  knowledge  base  for  rural  aquaculture  is  needed  to  define  the  range  of  appropriate \ntechnologies  and  their  social  and  economic  profiles.  This  is  the  approach  proposed  in  the \nProject.  The  proposed  Project  calls  for  a  limited  number  of  pilot  projects  within  each  regional \nnetwork  to  be  set  up  at  the  local  administrative  and  agro-ecological/ecological  levels.  These \npilot  studies  should  be  viewed  as  public  policy  experiments.  The  development  of  aquaculture \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n43 \n\nhas  to  eventually  become  integrated  into  the  national  governance  structure  for  it  to  be \nsustainable.  Environmental  impacts  can  be  monitored  alongside  other  project  parameters. \nThese  concern  water  quality  primarily,  and  are  generally  associated  with  large  commercial \nfacilities  during  the  time  of  drawdown  and  harvesting.  The  pond  culture  demonstrations \nproposed in the Project are unlikely to have adverse impacts on the environment. \n\n2. \n\nAgribusiness and Marketing Development \n\n \nThe  Project  will  provide  (i)  agribusiness  investment  promotion  through  conferences \n17. \norganized by the Lao National Chamber of Commerce and Industries; (ii) provincial trade fairs \nand  investment  promotion  workshops  to  promote  collaboration  between  producers  and  value-\nadded industries in Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam; (iii) establishment of a Lao agribusiness \nforum  for  private  business  and  policy  makers  to  discuss  legal,  regulatory,  and  other  relevant \nissues; (iv) upgrading of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry\u2019s (MAF) information system in \ncoordination with the Ministry of Commerce (MOC) and others to ensure mutual benefit and to \navoid  duplication;  and  (v)  assistance  to  the  MOC\u2019s  Trade  Promotion  Center  to  promote  Lao \nproducts through electronic media.  \n\n3. \n\nRural Infrastructure Development \n\n \n18. \nCleaner production (CP) is an approach for pollution control that emphasizes reduction \nof pollutants at the point of generation using general means for good housekeeping and in some \nsettings specialized types of equipment that minimize pollutant release. Currently, the Ministry \nof  Industry  and  Handicrafts  is  undergoing  a  revision  of  its  rules  for  industrial  waste,  and \nextensive training of staff in CP as well as monitoring and enforcement methods. Therefore, it is \nproposed  that  the  project  activities  under  this  component  may  include  the  topics  on  how  to \npromote CP in agribusiness investment in Lao.  \n \n \n \nThe Project will provide for the rehabilitation of 89.5 kilometers (km) and construction of \n19. \n70 km of strategic roads, identified as the highest priority rural access roads in the project area. \nThese  roads  are  (i)  the  Pakse-Champassak-Soukhouma-Mounlapamok  road  (Road  14-A), \nwhich  links  the  impoverished  but  potentially  productive  lower  Mekong  plain  of  Champassak \nProvince to the highly commercial east-west corridor of Paksong-Pakse and the Thai border; (ii) \nthe  Champhone-Xonbuli  road  in  Savannakhet  Province,  which  links  the  potentially  productive \nXonbuli District to the commercially active east-west corridor in Savannakhet, which connects to \nthe  border  region  with  Thailand;  and  (iii)  the  Songkhone-Thapasoun  road,  which  links  the \ncommercial  center  of  Songkhone  District  in  Savannakhet  Province  to  a  key  Mekong  River \nborder trading market with Thailand. \n\n \nIn Savannakhet, the roadway from Songkhone to Thapasoun (Section B) does not pass \n20. \nthrough  wetlands.  The  area  is  dominated  by  paddy  likely  to  be  subject  to  seasonal  flooding. \nSection A from Muang Champhone to Muang Xonbuli crosses a wetlands area, which causes \nthe roadway to be impassable during the wet season. The Xe Champhone wetlands, an area of \nsome  240  square  kilometers,  is  oriented  north  -  south  and  covers  a  distance  of  some  35  km. \nRoadway width will need to be widened about 3\u20134 m in order to obtain side slopes allowing the \nroadway to be raised some 1\u20132 m. Therefore, the impact of the Project on the wetlands will be \ninsignificant.  \n\n21. \nIn Champassak Province, Roadway Section C from Champassak to Soukhouma will be \nrehabilitated.  This  passes  through  the  area  identified  as  the  Soukhouma  Wetlands  Group; \nhowever, the land near the roadway is currently in paddy production, and there are no wetland \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\necosystems  that  will  be  affected  by  improvement  in  the  roadway.    Further  south,  Roadway \nSection  D  from  Soukhouma  to  Mounlapamok  also  passes  through  an  area  identified  as \nwetlands.  Marshes  are  interspersed  through  the  area,  and  can  be  readily  avoided  in  the \nconstruction of the roadway. The impact on wetlands from the construction of the roadways in \nChampassak will be insignificant as long as reasonable controls are in place. \n \n22. \nConstruction of the roadways, and to a lesser extent the ferry landing and markets, will \nrequire movement of materials and equipment, the import of labor, and disruption of usual paths \nof travel. Land clearing can cause unnecessary impact. The contractor should clear only areas \nneeded for widening the roadways and should maintain erosion and silt control in place at the \ntoes  of  slopes  and  along  drainage  channels  at  all  times,  decommissioning  in  the  wet  season \nwhen soil loss is potentially greatest. To minimize the impact on forests, the contractor should \nalso  minimize  forest  clearing,  prevent  trade  in  nontimber  forest  products  (including  wildlife)  by \nworkers  engaged  in  construction,  prevent  use  of  firewood  by  workers,  and  reforest  in \ncompensation for trees lost due to clearing for the roadway and borrow areas. \n\nInstitutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n\nE. \n \n23.  MAF will be the Executing Agency for the Project. Project implementation will be in the \nhands  of  the  Office  of  the  National  Project  Director  (ONPD)  located  within  NAFES.  The \nrespective  provincial  governments  in  the  project  areas  will  be  the  implementing  agencies. \nProvincial  project  offices  (PPOs)  will  have  day-to-day  responsibility  for  coordination  of  project \nactivities in the provinces.   \n \nTo ensure that all applicable national and provincial environmental laws, regulations, and \n24. \nstandards, as well as ADB\u2019s environmental requirements, will be met during the implementation \nand  operation  of  the  proposed  Project,  in  particular  the  further  preparation  of  an  IEE  for  each \ncandidate  investment  subproject,  an  environmental  unit  for  the  whole  project  should  be \nestablished within the ONPD. In the meantime, at least one environment staff should be hired at \neach  PPO.  Considering  the  lack  of  environmental  management  capacity  within  MAF  and  the \nprovinces,  it  is  proposed    that    an  international  environmental  assessment  specialist  for  about \n1\u20132  person-months  and  a  domestic  environmental  specialist  for  about  2\u20133  person-months \nshould  be  recruited  under  the  Project  in  the  first  year  of  project  implementation.  The \nenvironmental  staffs  within  ONPD  and  the  PPOs  will  work  together  with  the  international  and \ndomestic  environmental  experts  to  develop  the  IEE/Environmental  Impact  Assessment  where \nnecessary, monitor the implementation of mitigation measures identified by IEEs, and maintain \nregular contact with each subproject.   \n \n25. \nEnvironmental  monitoring  of  the  proposed  mitigation  measures  is  recommended \nthroughout  the  implementation  of  the  Project.  Most  monitoring  is  associated  with  the \nconstruction  of  roadways,  for  which  monitoring  protocols  are  described  in  some  detail  in  the \nMCTPC  environmental  assessment  guidelines.  Monitoring  can  be  undertaken  in  most  cases \nduring  the  inspection  for  the  roadway  construction  work,  which  is  a  responsibility  most \ncommonly shared among various individuals, including the technical assistance consultant, the \nONPD  representative  and  the  provincial  officials  from  various  agencies  (MCTPC  and  NAFES, \nspecifically).  In  the  meantime,  the  environmental  monitoring  results  will  be  complied  and \nincorporated into the quarterly and annual reports of the Project.   \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n45 \n\nFindings and Conclusions   \n\nF. \n \n26. \nThe  project  components  include  the  construction  of  roadways  on  existing  alignments, \nconstruction  of  markets  at  new  locations  and  construction  of  four  ferry  ramps  at  existing \nlocations.  The  conclusion  is  that  significant  environmental  impacts  on  the  Smallholder \nDevelopment  Project  are  limited  in  duration  and  extent,  and  can  be  mitigated  through  the \nimplementation  of  proposed  mitigation  measures  in  using  of  existing  guidelines,  technological \ncontrols,  and  regulatory  mechanisms  already  in  use  within  the  country.  Therefore,  a  detailed \nenvironmental impact assessment for the Project or further special studies is not warranted. \n\nRecommendations \n\nG. \n \nThe overall recommendation of the IEE is that environmental concerns should not inhibit \n27. \nproject  implementation  for  the  Smallholder  Development  Project,  rather  that  the  proposed \nmitigation  measures  should  be  incorporated  into  the  body  of  the  proposal  for  the  Project  and \nimplementation should proceed. Many concerns are procedural and relate to the construction of \nthe rural infrastructure component.

In addition, the Lao PDR is viewed as a very risky place to \ninvest.  The  majority  of  the  limited  number  of  investors  in  the  country  invest  in  projects  with \nshort-term  capital  recovery  (such  as  hotels,  timber  extraction  and  wood  processing,  and \ntextiles).  The  expected  capital  recovery  in  most  cases  does  not  exceed  18-24  months.  Under \nnormal conditions, agribusinesses require a minimum of 5 years for investment recovery.  \n \n2. \nThe  critical  component  of  agricultural  demand-side  strengthening  is  agribusiness \ndevelopment.  Achieving  this  objective  depends  on  mobilizing  agribusiness  investments  in  the \nproject  area.  Strengthening  marketing  chains  between  farmers  and  domestic  agribusinesses \ndepends on strengthening the skills and capacity of agroenterprises and promoting the entry of \nnew  value-adding  agribusinesses  into  the  sector.  The  agribusiness  sector  in  the  Lao  PDR  is \npresently very thin and burdened by major constraints.  \n \n3. \nThe  present  operations  of  agribusinesses  are  constrained  by  a  variety  of  factors:  (i) \nacute  shortage  of  both  investment  capital  and  working  capital;  (ii)  acute  shortage  of  technical \nskills;  (iii)  insufficient  raw  material  supply;  (iv)  heavy  dependence  on  imported  processing  raw \nmaterials and managerial expertise; (v) lack of production, trade, management, and marketing \nexperience;  (vi)  very  limited  understanding  of  existing  markets;  (vii)  low  local  demand  for \ndiversified  food  commodities;  (viii)  absence  of  local  processing  facilities  capable  of  absorbing \nlarge  quantities  of  produce;  (ix)  low  levels    of  production  and  management  technology; \n(x) limited  number  of  agricultural  commodity  traders;  (xi)  very  weak  commercial  networks \nthroughout \nlegal  environment;  and \n(xiii) difficulties with contract enforcement. \n \n4. \nThere are only 582 registered businesses in Lao PDR. Thirty percent of these are micro \nscale  agroprocessing  cottage  industries  at  the  household  and  village  levels  employing  2  or  3 \npersons.  In  addition  to  micro  cottage  industries,  there  are  15  small-  to  medium-scale \nagribusinesses  employing  50-300  persons.  Eighty  percent  of  these  are  located  in  Vientiane \nMunicipality, just beyond the project area. \n \n5. \nthe  smallholder \ndevelopment  project)  identified  eight  categories  of  suitable  agribusinesses  for  development  in \nthe  project  area.  Development  of  these  enterprises  would  have  a  significant  agricultural \ndemand-side  pull  on  local  agricultural  production.  These  include  feed  mill/piggery/poultry \ncomplexes; canneries; cold storage, grading, sorting, and bulk marketing facilities; seed oil mills; \nsugar  mills;  fish  hatcheries;  small-scale  rice  mills;  and  postharvest  handling  facilities  at  the \nvillage level. The consultant also identified and interviewed 15 potential agribusiness investors \nwho  expressed  interest  in  the  agroprocessing  sector.  Although  expressing  strong  interest  in \nsetting up agribusinesses, all of the persons contacted face most of the constraints listed above. \nThe major constraint, in addition to low human resource capacity, is lack of capital. \n \n6. \nThe  potential  agribusiness  investors  contacted  also  lacked  business  management \nexperience  and  even  the  necessary  skills  required  in  the  particular  industry.  They  lacked  the \nability to prepare business plans and credit proposals. All have requested technical assistance \n(TA) for overcoming deficiencies in these critical areas. The Project will target the development \nand  expansion  of  30  agribusinesses  through  the  project  area  over  the  6-year  implementation \n\nThe  Project  Preparatory  Technical  Assistance  consultant  (for \n\nthe  country;  (xii)  risk \n\nthe  uncertain \n\nimposed  by \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n61\n\nScope \n\nperiod.

The TA will play a proactive role in helping \nclient  investors  secure  financial  backing  from  Lao  commercial  banks,  Thai  agribusiness \ninvestors, and the Mekong Enterprise Fund (MEF). Where possible the TA will work closely with \nthe Mekong Project Development Fund (MPDF). The TA will complement the Agribusiness and \nMarketing Development component of the loan Project (which it accompanies). \n \nB. \n \n7. \nThe TA will facilitate agribusiness development by working with the Office of the National \nProject  Director  (ONPD)  to  provide  training  and  development  support  to  agribusiness \ncandidates within the four Project provinces. To obtain a good cross-section of entrepreneurs, \ntraining  and  support  services  provided  by  the  TA  will  be  advertised  at  national  agribusiness \nconferences, cross-border trade fairs, and the Lao Chamber of Commerce and Industries. The \nTA is expected to be completed in 24 months. \n \nPotential  agribusiness  investors  supported  by  the  TA  will  include  enterprising  business \n8. \npeople  with  imaginative  entrepreneurial  ideas  and  strong  interest  in  receiving  assistance.  As \nevidence of interest, candidates will be expected to make contributions in kind such as providing \nlocal  transportation  and  assistance  for  subsequent  marketing  and  other  survey  work. \nAgribusinesses  supported  by  the  TA  will  develop  \u201cniche\u201d  markets  for  Lao  products  with  clear \ncomparative  advantage  where  unique  products  have  the  potential  to  generate  above-normal \nreturns and import substitutes (e.g., organic produce, nontimber forest products, animal feed).  \n \nThe  TA  will  provide  assistance,  varying  from  $10,000  to  $30,000,  to  small-scale \n9. \nagribusinesses operated totally by the private sector. Agribusinesses supported by the TA will \nreceive training in business plan and feasibility study preparation, marketing studies as well as \napplying  for  credit  financing.  The  final  stage  of  the  agribusiness  development  and  training \nprocess  supplied  by  the  TA  will  consist  of  guiding  and  mentoring  client  candidates  through \nbusiness  plan  and  feasibility  study  preparation,  marketing  studies  and  loan  applications,  and \nfollow-up  with  the  banking  sector.1  Training  aids  developed  by  the  MPDF  will  be  used  for  the \ntraining program. \n \n10. \nThis TA will also provide funding for agribusiness management and process training at \nthe Mekong Institute/Khon Kaen University in Thailand and sponsor study tours to selected Thai \nagribusinesses as an adjunct to the formal training program.  \n \n\n1. \n\nInternational Consultants \n\na. \n\nAgribusiness Support and Training Specialist (10 person-months) \n\n11. \n\nThe agribusiness support and training specialist will \n\n(i) \n\nassist  ONPD  in  contacting  potential  agribusiness  investors  through  national \nagribusiness  investment  conferences,  cross-border  trade  fairs,  and  the  Lao \nChamber of Commerce and Industries, supported by the project loan; \n\n                                                 \n1  The  TA  will  play  a  proactive  role  in  helping  agribusinesses  secure  investment  financing  from  a  wide  range  of \n\nsources including the Lao commercial sector, offshore agribusiness investors, and the MEF.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n62 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\ndesign  and  deliver  four  training  courses  for  selected  agribusiness  investors \ncovering  the  mechanics  of  business  plan  preparation  with  subjects  covering  a \nrange  of  areas  including  marketing  studies,  marketing,  human  resources \nplanning,  finance/accounting,  personal  productivity    (selling  and  negotiation \nskills), operations management, etc; \n\nassist  agribusiness  investors  with  business  plan  (organization  strategy)  and \nfeasibility study (products and markets strategy) preparation; \n\nassist  agribusiness  investors  with  marketing  studies  focused  on  a  few  critical \n\u201cniche\u201d subsectors where the Lao PDR has comparative advantage;  \n\nassist  agribusiness  investors  in  identifying  and  making  contact  with  potential \n\u201cniche\u201d product buyers within Southeast Asia and beyond; \n\nassist  agribusiness  investors  in  preparing  credit  applications  to  a  wide  range  of \npotential  investment  credit  suppliers,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  Lao  PDR \ncommercial banks, regional agribusinesses, and the MEF; \n\n(vii) \n\ntake a proactive role in helping agribusinesses secure investment financing; and \n\n(viii) \n\nprovide additional assistance, as required, to support agribusiness development \nfor  a  target  30  businesses  in  the  project  provinces,  including  helping  them \nprepare  contract  farming  agreements  with  smallholder  producers  and  other \nsupport activities. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n63 \n\nFINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSES \n\nIntroduction \n\nAssumptions Used for Farm Models \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  project  components  promote  diversification  and  commercialization  of  agricultural \n1. \nproducts that the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) has an underlying comparative \nadvantage,  so  that  smallholder  farmers  can  increase  food  security  and  cash  income.  The \neconomic  analysis  was  undertaken  on  the  Project  as  a  whole  covering  all  four  components \nbecause the crop production benefits are to arise from these Project investments as a mutually \nsupporting  and  integrated  package.  Associated  and  linked  investments  in  roads,  provision  of \nproduction  supports,  and  wider  support  for  agribusinesses  are  all  essential  for  smallholders  to \nincrease production and earn cash income through improved access to factors/inputs as well as \nfunctioning  output  markets.  The  financial  analysis,  on  the  other  hand,  focused  only  on  the \nviability of representative farm models under the Project. Crop budgets and farm models were \ndeveloped to determine incremental farm incomes. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe Project is expected to increase productivity through better farming practices, and to \nfacilitate  farmers\u2019  commercial  production  and  diversification.  The  calculation  of  financial  and \neconomic benefits was based on per hectare crop budgets for wet season rice, dry season rice, \ncorn,  peanut,  soybean,  cabbage,  and  garlic.  The  farm  models  assume  that  households  apply \nthe extended technology only on a proportion of their planted area first, but that this proportion \nrises to a natural plateau of three quarters of targeted households\u2019 wet season planted area and \nto 60% of the total area for dry season cultivation by Year 7. \n \n3. \nWet Season Production. Average wet season rice yields should increase from 1.5 tons \nper  hectare  (ha)  to  2.3  tons/ha,  and  wet  season  rice  output  is  assumed  to  be  5%  better  in \nquality  (mainly  due  to  earlier  harvesting)  on  average  under  the  with-Project  situation.  The \nProject will cover 54 villages in each of 16 districts (a total of 864 villages), and the extension \ncomponent  is  expected  to  impact  some  20%  of  the  total  households  within  a  district  with  wet \nseason  cultivation  technology  changes.  Assuming  that  roughly  half  of  villagers  actively \nparticipate in the extension component, about 40% of participating households in those targeted \nvillages should be adopting the wet season technology by Year 7 (Table A13.1).  \n \n4. \nDry  Season  Production.  Overall  average  dry  season  (irrigated)  rice  yields  should \nincrease  from  3  tons/ha  to  3.2  tons/ha  with  the  Project. There  will  be  a  cropping  shift  towards \ncombinations  of  nonrice  crops  in  the  dry  season,  which  will  become  broadly  increasingly \nvaluable (i.e., in moving from diversification mix 1 through diversification mix 2 to diversification \nmix  3)  over  time.1  The  extension  component  expects  to  impact  60\u201375%  of  the  households  in \neach  district  that  undertake  dry  season  cultivation.  As  only  between  12%  and  16%  of  all \nhouseholds  in  the  project  provinces  undertake  dry  season  cultivation,  this  is  equivalent  to  an \nimpact on about 10% of all households in the project area. This target is technically realistic, as \nall the villages with current access to dry season cultivation will be selected to participate in the \nproject  extension  efforts.  The  estimate  of  impacted  dry  season  areas  assumes  new  irrigation \nscheme development with an annual average growth rate of 5% over the Year 1\u20137 period.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1  Diversification  mix  1  =  paddy  (50%)  and  peanut  (50%);  diversification  mix  2    =  paddy  (50%),  maize  (25%),  and \n\nsoybean (25%); and diversification mix 3 = paddy (33%), cabbage (33%), and garlic (33%). \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\nC. \n \n5. \nFinancial  Viability  of  Representative  Farms.  A  financial  analysis  was  undertaken  to \nestimate the effects of project investments on the income of beneficiary farmers by comparing \nwith-  and  without-Project  scenarios.  In  line  with  the  prevailing  size  of  irrigated  land  per \nhousehold, crop budgets and farm models were prepared to determine incremental farm income \nas  a  result  of  the  project  investments.  The  incremental  revenues  were  valued  using  financial \nfarm gate prices. The costs included full operation and maintenance (O&M) costs, water fees, \nand  the  cost  of  rehabilitation  of  drainage  and  irrigation.  The  results  of  the  financial  analysis \nindicate  that  each  representative  farm  is  financially  viable  (Table A13.2).  Farm-level  returns  to \nproject  investments  are  highly  positive;  each  farm  model  in  the  four  provinces  is  expected  to \ngenerate  a  return  of  around  50-70%  increase  over  the  without-Project  situation.  As  the  farm \nincome  analysis  assumes  the  costs  of  O&M  of  irrigation  schemes,  postharvest  activities,  and \ntransportation to be covered by farmers, the analysis shows that the beneficiary farmers should \nbe able to afford such levies and the proposed farm models will be financially sustainable. \n\n \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nGovernment  Budgetary  Implication.  The  Project  will  have  relatively  minor  budgetary \n6. \nimplications  consisting  of  (i)  incremental  operating  costs  of  the  extension  system,  and  (ii) \nincremental  maintenance  costs  of  the  project  roads.  The  aggregate  incremental  costs  of  the \nproposed  extension  system  account  for  less  than  0.01%  of  the  Government\u2019s  annual  budget \n(operating  and  capital  costs)  for  the  agriculture  sector,  and  less  than  0.2%  of  the  annual \nallocation  for  1999\u20132001.  Incremental  operating  costs  for  extension  services  in  the  project \nprovinces  during  project  implementation  will  be  financed  by  the  loan  funds.  As  for  the \nmaintenance  cost  of  the  project  roads,  which  is  estimated  to  be  about  $60,000  per  year, \nmaintenance  of  national  road  sections  will  be  financed  out  of  the  Road  Maintenance  Fund, \nwhich  provides  5\u2013to-1  matching  fund  for  any  locally  generated  revenues.  While  provincial \ngovernments  are  responsible  for  maintenance  of  rural  access  roads,  the  provinces  and/or  the \nDepartment of Roads in the Ministry of Communication, Transport, Post, and Construction has \nalso assured the provision of adequate funding for routine maintenance of all project roads.  \n \nD. \n \nThe  economic  viability  of  the  Project  was  analyzed  comparing  the  estimated  benefits \n7. \nunder  the  without-Project  and  with-Project  situations  for  the  20-year  life  of  the  Project.  In  the \ncase of the without-Project situation, there is no expected deterioration or decline of yields and \nareas  planted/harvested  in  the  absence  of  the  proposed  Project  investment,  and  therefore \nwithout-Project  and  current  situations  are  de  facto  the  same  thing.  The  economic  analysis  is \npresented  in  2002  constant  terms,  and  economic  costs  and  benefits  are  estimated  using  the \ndomestic numeraire.  \n \nInvestment  and  recurrent  costs  were  segregated  into  tradable,  nontraded,  and  labor \n8. \ncomponents, and converted into economic price using financial process net of taxes, duties, and \nsubsidies. A shadow exchange rate factor of 1.1 is used to value tradable resources converted \nat the prevailing/official exchange rate of KN9,470 (July 2002) to the US dollar for the economic \nanalysis.  As regards specific conversion factors, a shadow wage rate factor of 0.9 is used for \nrural labor in the farm budgets, reflecting average prevailing levels of rural unemployment and \nunderemployment throughout the Lao PDR. \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  estimated  direct  benefits  comprise  (i)  crop  production  benefits  that  stem \n9. \nfrom  yield  increments  and  price  impacts  covering  an  area  of  about  30,000  ha  (9,000  ha \nirrigated),  and  (ii)  reduced  vehicle  operating  costs  (VOC)  for  non-agricultural  traffic  on  the \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n65 \n\nto  500 \n\njobs  created), \n\nto  build  roads\u2014up \n\nproject roads.  The calculation of VOC saving assumed that one third of traffic is entirely non-\nagricultural  in  nature,  based  on  historical  trends,  and  no  benefits  were  estimated  for  time \nsavings. Benefits generated by the livestock and fisheries extension activities were not included \nin the analysis, because no directly identifiable benefits are apparent from the project outputs. \n \n10. \nThe base case economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project is estimated to be \n19.9% (net present value = KN80,100 million, discounted at 12%). This quite positive estimate \nessentially  arises  from  the  scale  of  the  latent  economic  opportunity,  indicating  that  the  Project \nwill help transform an underlying comparative advantage into realized competitive performance. \nJust  over  half  the  cropping  benefits  arise  from  wet  season  rice  cultivation  and  the  remainder \nfrom dry season interventions. About one fifth of total project economic benefits come from VOC \nsavings. \n \n11. \n The  project  beneficiaries  comprise  farmers,  farm  workers,  and  their  families  whose \nlivelihood  depend  on  about  106,700  ha  of  land,  and  agroprocessors,  and  commercial \nagricultural  traders.  The  total  number  of  direct  wet  season  beneficiary  households  is  about \n33,000  and  dry  season  direct  beneficiary  households  are  some  16,000.  Many  of  these \nbeneficiaries  are  poor  farm  workers  and  small  subsistence  farmers,  who  would  benefit  from \nincreased  income  through  improved  production  of  wet  season  rice.  In  addition  to  these, \nadditional  individuals  and  households  will  benefit  from  the  road  improvements  (including  labor \nfisheries \nfull-time \nemployed \ndemonstrations,  and  the  various  agribusiness  support  interventions. Total  project  beneficiaries \nwill likely be at least 45,000 households. The distribution analysis of project benefits suggested \nthat  smallholders  are  the  primary  beneficiaries  of  the  Project,  followed  by  road  users.  The \nProject is also expected to have a modest but positive impact on poverty-reduction in the long \nterm: The poverty impact ratio of the Project is estimated to be 25%, which compares with the \nnational poverty incidence of 39.2%. \n \nE. \n \n12. \nA  sensitivity  analysis  was  carried  out  to  test  the  impact  of  higher  project  costs,  lower \nproject  benefits,  lower  production  improvements,  and  a  delay  in  project  implementation.  The \nProject\u2019s returns are relatively robust; increasing the costs by 20% causing the base case EIRR \nto  fall  to  17%,  and  cropping  benefits  have  to  fall  42%  for  the  EIRR  to  fall  below  12%  (Table \nA14.3). Switching values for major variables indicate that overall costs have to rise by 72% for \nthe Project to become nonviable. Rice yields/prices and adoption rates would have to fall by half \nfor  the  same  outcome. The  omission  of  VOC  benefits  entirely  does  not  affect  Project  viability. \nQuantitative risk-based analyses suggest that the probability of the Project achieving less than \nacceptable economic is very low at about 6%. \n \nF. \n \n13. \nAlthough  the  Project  design  logic  is  based  on  the  fact  that  several  linked  interventions \nare required for both on-farm and off-farm activities to deliver the expected benefits, it can also \nbe useful to look at the economic viability of the major components separately. For the extension \ncomponent, if all its directly attributable costs are compared with the cropping benefits from the \nProject,  the  \u201ccomponent\u201d  EIRR  is  37%.  For  the  rural  infrastructure  component  the  estimated \neconomic return is 34%. \n \n\nComponent Viability Analysis \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\nlivestock  and \n\n\f66 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nDomestic Resource Cost Analysis \n\nG. \n \n14. \nProduction  of  major  field  crops  supported  by  the  Project  has  strong  comparative \nadvantage  in  the  Lao  PDR,  indicating  the  potential  for  export.  The  cross-county  cost  of \nproduction information in Table A13.4 supports this conclusion, suggesting that the fundamental \neconomic viability of the Project intervening to increase technical efficiency in the production of \nsuch crops is sound. \n \n\nTable A13. 1: Incremental Production \n \n\nWith Project \n\nWithout \nProject \n\nYear 1 \n\nYear 2 \n\nYear 3 \n\nYear 4 \n\nYear 5 \n\nYear 6  Year 7-20\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n Item \n\nI.
