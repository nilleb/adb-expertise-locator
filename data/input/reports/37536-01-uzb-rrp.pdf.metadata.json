The Project is expected to cost $76.2 million, and is accompanied by a $1.0 million \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  project  to  promote  policy  reform.  During  project  preparation,  ADB \nsubmitted a proposal to the Global Environment Facility (GEF) for a grant in the amount of $3.0 \nmillion to be provided to the Government of Uzbekistan for financing additional activities1 under \nthe  Project  to  ensure  sustainable  ecological  productivity  in  the  project  area.  This  paper  seeks \nBoard approval for ADB to administer the grant financing of $3.0 million.  \n \nA. \n \n2. \nLand  degradation  is  a  serious  economic,  social,  and  environmental  problem  in \nUzbekistan and the rest of Central Asia. It directly affects the livelihood of the rural population by \nreducing land productivity, and by causing agricultural production losses estimated at $2 billion \na year for the region.  \n \nThe Project will address the rapidly worsening and expanding land degradation in nine \n3. \ndistricts  in  Bukhara,  Kashkadarya,  and  Navoi  provinces.  The  project  area,  covering  162,300 \nhectares  of irrigated  land,  suffers  from  increased  soil  salinity  and  shallow  groundwater  table\u2014\nthe most serious forms of land degradation. Crop yields in those areas reportedly have declined \nby 30% since 1991. The problems are caused by (i) poor water management, (ii) deteriorating \nirrigation  and  drainage  infrastructure,  and  (iii)  a  policy  environment  that  constrains  production \ngrowth  and  reduces  incentives  to  invest  in  land  improvement.  Worsening  land  degradation \ndirectly affects a rural population of 1.4 million in the project districts. \n \n4. \nTo  help  the  Government  halt  and  reverse  land  degradation,  the  Project  will  (i)  develop \nand disseminate improved land reclamation practices adapted to local conditions; (ii) strengthen \ninstitutions to address land degradation issues at central, provincial, and community levels; and \n(iii) improve land and water management infrastructure to enhance water control and efficiency. \nThrough  agreed-upon  policy  reforms,  the  Project  also  will  help  increase  farmers\u2019  incentives  to \nraise land productivity and invest in land, as well as improve rural governance. \n \nA TA entitled Implementation and Monitoring of Policy Reforms in the Agriculture Sector \n5. \nwill  be  provided  to  assist  the  Government  at  central  and  provincial  levels  in  (i)  formulating, \nprioritizing,  and  implementing  the  agreed-upon  reforms;  (ii)  strengthening  the  relevant \ninstitutions;  (iii)  preparing  legislation  to  reverse  the  constraints  on  agricultural  productivity  and \nrural incomes; (iv) monitoring the implementation of reforms and their impact on farm incomes, \nrural poverty, and Government revenues; and (v) planning the expansion of sector reforms.  \n \n6. \nA grant from GEF Operational Program 15 on Sustainable Land Management (SLM) is \nproposed to enhance the project impact at national and subregional levels. The GEF grant will \npromote modern land management, enhance project replicability, and generate additional global \n                                                 \n1 The GEF grant funding is separate from the approved attached technical assistance of $1,000,000 for policy reform \n\u2500as  outlined  in  paras.  43\u201344  of  the  report  and  recommendation  of  the  President  (ADB.  2006.  Report  and \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Loans and Technical Assistance Grant to \nUzbekistan for the Land Improvement Project. Manila (Loan 2245/46-UZB, for $32.6 million, approved on 24 July \n2006). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nCentral Asian Countries Initiative for Land Management \n\nenvironmental  benefits.  The  GEF-financed  activities  will  (i)  address  regulatory  conditions  for \nimproved  land  management;  (ii)  foster  coordination  among  line  agencies  to  ensure  an \nintegrated,  participatory  approach  to  project  activities;  (iii)  involve  all  stakeholders  in  planning, \nimplementing,  and  monitoring  SLM;  (iv)  pilot-test  innovative  technical  systems  and  public  and \nprivate partnerships; and (v) include monitoring and evaluation to increase the replicability of the \nProject.   \n \nB. \n \n7. \nThe Central Asian Countries Initiative for Land Management (CACILM) is a partnership \nof  Central  Asian  countries  (CACs)  and  development  cooperation  partners2  dedicated  to \ncombating land degradation and improving rural livelihood. Considering previous analytical and \nresource mobilization support to the CACs from ADB and the Global Mechanism of the United \nNations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD),3 the development partners requested \nADB to lead in designing and developing CACILM. ADB, through a TA cofinanced by GEF and \nGlobal  Mechanism,4  led  in  designing  CACILM  as  a  10-year  program  of  country-driven  action \nand  resource  mobilization  (July  2006\u2013June  2016)5  to  achieve  in  the  CACs  (i)  strengthened \npolicy,  legislative,  and  institutional  frameworks,  creating  conditions  conducive  to  SLM;  (ii) \nincreased  capacity  of  key  institutions  responsible  for  planning  and  implementing  SLM \ninterventions;  and  (iii)  improved  land  management  and  natural  systems  through  the  combined \nimpact of enabling conditions and targeted project investments. \n \n8. \nThe CACILM partnership is guided by the CACILM Multicountry Partnership Framework \n(CMPF).  In  October  2006,  the  GEF  Council  approved  the  CMPF\u2019s  overall  programmatic \napproach  and  the  associated  set  of  projects  seeking  grant  financing.  ADB  is  responsible  for \nleading  the  CACILM  partnership,  coordinating  the  program  at  the  multicountry  and  national \nlevels,  and  supporting  activities  at  the  multicountry  level.  ADB  TA  6357-REG:  CACILM \nMulticounty Partnership Framework Support Project is supporting activities in the first phase of \nthe CACILM program. \n \n9. \nUnder  the  CMPF,  GEF  has  made  provision  for  grant  cofinancing  of  up  to  $20  million. \nThe Project grant for $3,000,000 is included in the CMPF. On 16 July 2007, the grant financing \nwas  approved  through  endorsement  of  the  GEF  CEO.  As  with  all  GEF  funds,  ADB  will  thus \nadminister grant financing under the Memorandum of Understanding of Direct Access to GEF (7 \nJuly 2004), and the associated Financial Procedures Agreement (7 July 2004). \n\n                                                 \n2  The  main  partners  from  the  countries  are  the  United  Nations  Convention  to  Combat  Desertification  (UNCCD) \nWorking  Groups  on  Partnership  Development  for  UNCCD  Implementation  and  the  UNCCD  national  focal  points. \nThe  development  cooperation  partners  are  members  of  the  Strategic  Partnership  Agreement  for  UNCCD \nImplementation in the Central Asian Countries (SPA) \u2014 Global Mechanism (GM), Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nCanadian  International  Development  Agency  (CIDA),  CCD  Project  of  the  German  Agency  for  Technical \nCooperation (GTZ), International Center for Agricultural Research on Dry Areas (ICARDA), International Fund for \nAgricultural  Development  (IFAD),  Swiss  Agency  for  Development  and  Cooperation  (SDC),  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP),  United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and World Bank.  \n\n3  Support  was  provided  the  CACs  for  important  sector  work  that  developed  priorities  for  action  and  organized \nresource  mobilization  efforts  through  ADB.  2000.

Technical  Assistance  for  Central  Asian  Countries  Initiative  for  Land  Management.  Manila  (TA  6236-\n\nREG). \n\n5   While  the  resource  mobilization  period  is  10  years,  the  implementation  of  various  investments  in  the  enabling \n\nenvironment and on the ground development will be over 15 years. \n\n\f3 \n\nII. \n\nGEF-FUNDED ACTIVITIES UNDER THE PROJECT \n\nThe  GEF-financed  activities  will  be  integrated  with  four  of  the  five  of  the  Land \n\n \n10. \nThe  GEF-financed  component  will  focus  on  creating  additional  local  capacity  and  on \nintroducing novel land rehabilitation activities that promise to have wide-ranging environmental \nbenefits.  Specifically,  the  GEF  grant  will  (i)  contribute  to  creating  a  regulatory  regime  that \nenhances  incentives  for  land  management  in  which  national  and  global  environmental \nconsiderations  have  a  place,  (ii)  field-test  and  introduce  methods  of  reusing  return  irrigation \nwater for productivity and environmental gains, (iii) build the capacity of the agriculture sector of \nUzbekistan  for  environmental  analysis  and  management,  and  (iv)  provide  for  a  structured \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  Project\u2019s  global  environmental  impacts  and  other  impacts  to \nincrease the replicability of its most positive elements.  \n \n11. \nImprovement Project components as follows.  \n \n12. \nSubcomponent  A:  Strengthening  of  the  Incentive  Structure  for  Environmental \nBenefits  of  SLM.  The  GEF  financing  will  deepen  the  reform  measures  that  encourage  SLM \nand,  through  it,  the  realization  of  (also)  national  and  global  environmental  benefits.  The  GEF-\nfinanced activities will (i) develop measures providing incentives for sustainable use of marginal \nwaters and marginal lands; (ii) review the potential for creating special operating and incentive \nregimes for sub-areas where land rehabilitation offers high environmental benefits; (iii) develop \nproposals for legislative and regulatory support for the conservation of agro-biodiversity, and for \nprotection  of  ecosystems  and  landscapes;  and  (iv)  investigate  the  potential  of  \u201cpayment  for \nenvironmental  services\u201d  as  a  policy  mechanism,  encouraging  the  adoption  of  conservation \nagriculture in Uzbekistan and Central Asia.6  \n\n \nSubcomponent  B:  Management  of  Marginal  Water \n\n13. \nfor  Livelihood  and \nEnvironmental Benefits. The GEF-financed activities will test new technical and management \napproaches to managing marginal water (return irrigation water contaminated by salts and other \npollutants) in an area of great economic, cultural, and environmental values along the Great Silk \nRoad in the Zeravshan and Kashkadarya River basins. With the GEF financing, the component \nwill (i) introduce and test salinity mitigation management through the application of drainage and \nflood runoff regulations, and introduce drainage water reuse schemes and other environmental \nfeasible interventions;  (ii)  introduce and  test  salinity  mitigation  management  using  elements  of \nconservation  agriculture;  (iii)  conserve  and  improve  wetlands  and  desert  ecosystems  around \nirrigated  oases  and  selected  desert  depressions  as  a  prototype  for  SLM  in  these  and  similar \nareas;  (iv)  demonstrate  the  scope  for  synergy  among  biodiversity  conservation,  carbon \nsequestration, and land productivity enhancement; and (v) disseminate the results and lessons \nof the pilot activities. \n \nSubcomponent C: Capacity Building for Environmental Analysis and Management \n14. \nin the Agriculture Sector. The GEF-financed activities will (i) strengthen and mainstream the \nenvironmental  analysis  and  risk  assessment  of  land  rehabilitation  projects  and  conservation \nagriculture  into  MAWR  and  related  institutions,  and  (ii)  develop  the  methodology  of  valuing \necosystem conservation in Uzbekistan for local and regional dissemination. \n\n                                                 \n6  In some countries where conservation agriculture (and no-tillage in particular) has been adopted, lower yields in the \nfirst 1 or 2 years were recorded. The disincentive effect of the initially lower profitability could be overcome through \na financial transfer from the downstream beneficiaries of water-saving conservation agriculture to its \u201cpioneers\u201d. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nSubcomponent  D:  Learning  and  Dissemination  for  Improved  Environmental \n15. \nOutcomes.  Component  3  of  the  Project  (capacity  building  of  land  and  water  management \ninstitutions) targets land and water management institutions and builds their capacity in several \nways described earlier on. The GEF financing will (i) scale these activities up to a level where \nthey can effectively support the delivery of national and global environmental benefits and make \nit  possible  for  the  relevant  institutions  to  play  an  active  part  in  the  global  exchange  of \nexperience. The alternative also adds to other capacity building activities: (ii) enlarge the pool of \nstakeholders  involved  in  training  and  in  dissemination  of  the  globally  most  relevant  lessons  of \nconservation  agriculture,  (iii)  provides  support  for  community-based  planning  and  rural \nawareness  program  as  well  as  agro-cultural  heritage  and  gender  perspectives,  and  (iv) \npromotes public/private study tours to learn from the experience of conservation agriculture.  \n \nSubcomponent  E:  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  of  Project  Environmental  Impacts.  \n16. \nThe GEF-financed activities will provide for more comprehensive project management in which \na common  set of indicators will be used to monitor and evaluate such variables as the nature \nand  status  of \nland  degradation,  carbon  sequestration;  biodiversity;  on-  and  off-site \nenvironmental  impacts,  biodrain  siltation,  salinization,  pollution,  and  eutrophication;  and \nsocioeconomic  factors.  The  GEF-financed  activities  will  (i)  develop  a  system  for  monitoring  of \nthe  Project\u2019s  environmental  impacts;  (ii)  develop  a  proposal  for  a  unified  salinity  management \ndatabase  in  Uzbekistan;  and  (iii)  mainstream  the  most  suitable  international  practices  of \nparticipatory monitoring of environmental impacts. \n \n17. \nexpenditures are provided in Table 2. \n \n\nThe incremental cost of these activities will be financed by GEF (Table 1).
