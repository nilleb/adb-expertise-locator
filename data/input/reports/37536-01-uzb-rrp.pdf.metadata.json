The Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved on 24 July 2006 \nto provide to the Republic of Uzbekistan (Uzbekistan) for the Land Improvement Project, two \nloans: (i) a loan for $32.6 million from the ordinary capital resources (OCR); and (ii) a loan in \nvarious currencies equivalent to SDR18,515,000 ($27.6 million) from the Special Funds (SF) \nresources. The Project is expected to cost $76.2 million, and is accompanied by a $1.0 million \ntechnical assistance (TA) project to promote policy reform. During project preparation, ADB \nsubmitted a proposal to the Global Environment Facility (GEF) for a grant in the amount of $3.0 \nmillion to be provided to the Government of Uzbekistan for financing additional activities1 under \nthe Project to ensure sustainable ecological productivity in the project area. This paper seeks \nBoard approval for ADB to administer the grant financing of $3.0 million.  \n \nA.  The Project  \n \n2.  Land  degradation  is  a  serious  economic,  social,  and  environmental  problem  in \nUzbekistan and the rest of Central Asia. It directly affects the livelihood of the rural population by \nreducing land productivity, and by causing agricultural production losses estimated at $2 billion \na year for the region.  \n \n3.  The Project will address the rapidly worsening and expanding land degradation in nine \ndistricts in Bukhara, Kashkadarya, and Navoi provinces. The project area, covering 162,300 \nhectares of irrigated land, suffers from increased soil salinity and shallow groundwater table\u2014\nthe most serious forms of land degradation. Crop yields in those areas reportedly have declined \nby 30% since 1991. The problems are caused by (i) poor water management, (ii) deteriorating \nirrigation and drainage infrastructure, and (iii) a policy environment that constrains production \ngrowth and reduces incentives to invest in land improvement. Worsening land degradation \ndirectly affects a rural population of 1.4 million in the project districts. \n \n4.  To help the Government halt and reverse land degradation, the Project will (i) develop \nand disseminate improved land reclamation practices adapted to local conditions; (ii) strengthen \ninstitutions to address land degradation issues at central, provincial, and community levels; and \n(iii) improve land and water management infrastructure to enhance water control and efficiency. \nThrough agreed-upon policy reforms, the Project also will help increase farmers\u2019 incentives to \nraise land productivity and invest in land, as well as improve rural governance. \n \n5.  A TA entitled Implementation and Monitoring of Policy Reforms in the Agriculture Sector \nwill be provided to assist the Government at central and provincial levels in (i) formulating, \nprioritizing,  and  implementing  the  agreed-upon  reforms;  (ii)  strengthening  the  relevant \ninstitutions; (iii) preparing legislation to reverse the constraints on agricultural productivity and \nrural incomes; (iv) monitoring the implementation of reforms and their impact on farm incomes, \nrural poverty, and Government revenues; and (v) planning the expansion of sector reforms.  \n \n6.  A grant from GEF Operational Program 15 on Sustainable Land Management (SLM) is \nproposed to enhance the project impact at national and subregional levels. The GEF grant will \npromote modern land management, enhance project replicability, and generate additional global \n                                                 \n1 The GEF grant funding is separate from the approved attached technical assistance of $1,000,000 for policy reform \n\u2500as outlined in paras. 43\u201344 of the report and recommendation of the President (ADB. 2006.

The GEF-financed activities will (i) address regulatory conditions for \nimproved  land  management;  (ii)  foster  coordination  among  line  agencies  to  ensure  an \nintegrated, participatory approach to project activities; (iii) involve all stakeholders in planning, \nimplementing, and monitoring SLM; (iv) pilot-test innovative technical systems and public and \nprivate partnerships; and (v) include monitoring and evaluation to increase the replicability of the \nProject.   \n \nB.  Central Asian Countries Initiative for Land Management \n \n7.  The Central Asian Countries Initiative for Land Management (CACILM) is a partnership \nof  Central  Asian  countries  (CACs)  and  development  cooperation  partners2  dedicated  to \ncombating land degradation and improving rural livelihood. Considering previous analytical and \nresource mobilization support to the CACs from ADB and the Global Mechanism of the United \nNations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD),3 the development partners requested \nADB to lead in designing and developing CACILM. ADB, through a TA cofinanced by GEF and \nGlobal Mechanism,4 led in designing CACILM as a 10-year program of country-driven action \nand resource mobilization (July 2006\u2013June 2016)5 to achieve in the CACs (i) strengthened \npolicy,  legislative,  and  institutional  frameworks,  creating  conditions  conducive  to  SLM;  (ii) \nincreased  capacity  of  key  institutions  responsible  for  planning  and  implementing  SLM \ninterventions; and (iii) improved land management and natural systems through the combined \nimpact of enabling conditions and targeted project investments. \n \n8.  The CACILM partnership is guided by the CACILM Multicountry Partnership Framework \n(CMPF).  In  October  2006,  the  GEF  Council  approved  the  CMPF\u2019s  overall  programmatic \napproach and the associated set of projects seeking grant financing. ADB is responsible for \nleading the CACILM partnership, coordinating the program at the multicountry and national \nlevels,  and  supporting  activities  at  the  multicountry  level.  ADB  TA  6357-REG:  CACILM \nMulticounty Partnership Framework Support Project is supporting activities in the first phase of \nthe CACILM program. \n \n9.  Under the CMPF, GEF has made provision for grant cofinancing of up to $20 million. \nThe Project grant for $3,000,000 is included in the CMPF. On 16 July 2007, the grant financing \nwas approved through endorsement of the GEF CEO. As with all GEF funds, ADB will thus \nadminister grant financing under the Memorandum of Understanding of Direct Access to GEF (7 \nJuly 2004), and the associated Financial Procedures Agreement (7 July 2004). \n                                                 \n2 The main partners from the countries are the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) \nWorking Groups on Partnership Development for UNCCD Implementation and the UNCCD national focal points. \nThe  development  cooperation  partners  are  members  of  the  Strategic  Partnership  Agreement  for  UNCCD \nImplementation in the Central Asian Countries (SPA) \u2014 Global Mechanism (GM), Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nCanadian  International  Development  Agency  (CIDA),  CCD  Project  of  the  German  Agency  for  Technical \nCooperation (GTZ), International Center for Agricultural Research on Dry Areas (ICARDA), International Fund for \nAgricultural  Development  (IFAD),  Swiss  Agency  for  Development  and  Cooperation  (SDC),  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP),  United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and World Bank.  \n3 Support was provided the CACs for important sector work that developed priorities for action and organized \nresource mobilization efforts through ADB. 2000.

The GEF-financed component will focus on creating additional local capacity and on \nintroducing novel land rehabilitation activities that promise to have wide-ranging environmental \nbenefits. Specifically, the GEF grant will (i) contribute to creating a regulatory regime that \nenhances  incentives  for  land  management  in  which  national  and  global  environmental \nconsiderations have a place, (ii) field-test and introduce methods of reusing return irrigation \nwater for productivity and environmental gains, (iii) build the capacity of the agriculture sector of \nUzbekistan  for  environmental  analysis  and  management,  and  (iv)  provide  for  a  structured \nmonitoring and evaluation of the Project\u2019s global environmental impacts and other impacts to \nincrease the replicability of its most positive elements.  \n \n11.  The  GEF-financed  activities  will  be  integrated  with  four  of  the  five  of  the  Land \nImprovement Project components as follows.  \n \n12.  Subcomponent  A:  Strengthening  of  the  Incentive  Structure  for  Environmental \nBenefits of SLM. The GEF financing will deepen the reform measures that encourage SLM \nand, through it, the realization of (also) national and global environmental benefits. The GEF-\nfinanced activities will (i) develop measures providing incentives for sustainable use of marginal \nwaters and marginal lands; (ii) review the potential for creating special operating and incentive \nregimes for sub-areas where land rehabilitation offers high environmental benefits; (iii) develop \nproposals for legislative and regulatory support for the conservation of agro-biodiversity, and for \nprotection of ecosystems and landscapes; and (iv) investigate the potential of \u201cpayment for \nenvironmental services\u201d as a policy  mechanism, encouraging the adoption of conservation \nagriculture in Uzbekistan and Central Asia.6  \n \n13.  Subcomponent  B:  Management  of  Marginal  Water  for  Livelihood  and \nEnvironmental Benefits. The GEF-financed activities will test new technical and management \napproaches to managing marginal water (return irrigation water contaminated by salts and other \npollutants) in an area of great economic, cultural, and environmental values along the Great Silk \nRoad in the Zeravshan and Kashkadarya River basins. With the GEF financing, the component \nwill (i) introduce and test salinity mitigation management through the application of drainage and \nflood runoff regulations, and introduce drainage water reuse schemes and other environmental \nfeasible interventions; (ii) introduce and test salinity mitigation management using elements of \nconservation agriculture; (iii) conserve and improve wetlands and desert ecosystems around \nirrigated oases and selected desert depressions as a prototype for SLM in these and similar \nareas;  (iv)  demonstrate  the  scope  for  synergy  among  biodiversity  conservation,  carbon \nsequestration, and land productivity enhancement; and (v) disseminate the results and lessons \nof the pilot activities. \n \n14.  Subcomponent C: Capacity Building for Environmental Analysis and Management \nin the Agriculture Sector. The GEF-financed activities will (i) strengthen and mainstream the \nenvironmental analysis and risk assessment of land rehabilitation projects and conservation \nagriculture into MAWR and related institutions, and (ii) develop the methodology of valuing \necosystem conservation in Uzbekistan for local and regional dissemination. \n \n                                                 \n6  In some countries where conservation agriculture (and no-tillage in particular) has been adopted, lower yields in the \nfirst 1 or 2 years were recorded. The disincentive effect of the initially lower profitability could be overcome through \na financial transfer from the downstream beneficiaries of water-saving conservation agriculture to its \u201cpioneers\u201d. \n ", "4 \n15.  Subcomponent  D:  Learning  and  Dissemination  for  Improved  Environmental \nOutcomes. Component 3 of the Project (capacity building of land and water management \ninstitutions) targets land and water management institutions and builds their capacity in several \nways described earlier on. The GEF financing will (i) scale these activities up to a level where \nthey can effectively support the delivery of national and global environmental benefits and make \nit  possible  for  the  relevant  institutions  to  play  an  active  part  in  the  global  exchange  of \nexperience. The alternative also adds to other capacity building activities: (ii) enlarge the pool of \nstakeholders involved in training and in dissemination of the globally most relevant lessons of \nconservation  agriculture,  (iii)  provides  support  for  community-based  planning  and  rural \nawareness  program  as  well  as  agro-cultural  heritage  and  gender  perspectives,  and  (iv) \npromotes public/private study tours to learn from the experience of conservation agriculture.  \n \n16.  Subcomponent E: Monitoring and Evaluation of Project Environmental Impacts.  \nThe GEF-financed activities will provide for more comprehensive project management in which \na common set of indicators will be used to monitor and evaluate such variables as the nature \nand  status  of  land  degradation,  carbon  sequestration;  biodiversity;  on-  and  off-site \nenvironmental  impacts,  biodrain  siltation,  salinization,  pollution,  and  eutrophication;  and \nsocioeconomic factors. The GEF-financed activities will (i) develop a system for monitoring of \nthe Project\u2019s environmental impacts; (ii) develop a proposal for a unified salinity management \ndatabase  in  Uzbekistan;  and  (iii)  mainstream  the  most  suitable  international  practices  of \nparticipatory monitoring of environmental impacts. \n \n17.
