This  will  improve  connectivity,  reduce  traffic  congestion  and \npromote sustainable, safe, reliable and efficient transport.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nGeorgia has a population of only 4.62 million but is one of the most urbanized countries \nin  the  Caucasus.  Urban  areas  are  the  pillars  of  economic  growth  and  account  for  53%  of  the \ntotal population, nearly 2.5 million people. Urban areas can be divided into three groups: (i) the \nconurbation of Tbilisi and the adjacent city of Rustavi; (ii) the main secondary cities of Batumi, \nGori,  Kutaisi,  and  Poti;  and  (iii)  cities  with  high  tourism  potential  such  as  Anaklia,  Borjomi, \nGudauri,  and  Mestia.  Although  they  differ  in  size,  they  all  have  common  transport  problems: \nrising  traffic  congestion,  pollution,  poor  and  inappropriate  road  infrastructure  and  highly \ninefficient  urban  transport  systems.  Tbilisi,  the  capital  and  largest  city,  is  home  to  30%  of  the \nnational population and generates 50% of Georgia's gross domestic product. It is also the main \nemployment center. A problem tree analysis linked to the design monitoring framework (DMF) is \nshown in Appendix 1. \n \n4. \nUrban  environment  and  mobility  patterns.  Urban  sprawl  takes  place  in  all  urban \nareas and low-density developments are mushrooming along main road networks, creating car-\ndependent communities. Tbilisi is the most affected. Located in a valley with mountains on two \nsides,  its  infrastructure  and  traffic  flows  converge  in  a  single  corridor.  This  fuels  high  urban \nmobility,  severe  traffic  congestion,  poor  air  quality,  and  excessive  noise,  a  pattern  repeated \nacross other cities. \n \nSafety.  Recent  high  economic  growth  has  led  to  a  sharp  increase  in  car  ownership.2 \n5. \nThis trend is likely to continue, aggravating the congestion problem. Greater car ownership and \npoor quality transport infrastructure have led to rise in the number of accidents. Death and injury \nrates are higher than in comparable cities in Europe and Asia. For the whole of Georgia, there \nwere  737  deaths  and  7,349  injuries  from  traffic  accidents  in  2007  (53%  of  which  occurred  in \nTbilisi),  a  62%  increase  since  2002.  About  80%  of  pollution  derives  from  motorized  transport, \nmuch of which comprises secondhand cars. \n \nTraffic  management  and  parking.  Despite  improvements  to  major  arteries  in  the \n6. \ncapital, the traffic signal system is outdated and inadequate. Illegal parking on pavements and \nbusy streets is frequent. Tbilisi and other cities lack controlled parking places and sound parking \npolicies.  There  are  limited  arrangements  for  cyclists  and  pedestrians,  often  the  first  victims  of \ntraffic accidents. \n \n7. \nPublic  transport.  Public  urban  transport  in  all  cities  relies  heavily  on  microbuses  and \nbuses.  Microbuses  constitute  47%  of  public  transport  in  Tbilisi  and  nearly  80%  in  other  major \ncities. These often duplicate existing bus lines and provide a poor service and minimal comfort. \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to Georgia for Preparing the Sustainable Urban Transport Project. Manila. \n2  About half of the total personal vehicles in Georgia are registered in Tbilisi (about 275,000 in 2008). \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nA  rationalization  of  bus  and  microbus  networks  is  necessary,  especially  in  Batumi,  Kutaisi, \nRustavi, and Tbilisi. A new tendering process and criteria to award permits and concessions is \nneeded.  In  particular,  it  is  essential  to  focus  on  quality  of  service  and  on  the  strict  respect  for \nidentified  routes  and  stops.  In  Tbilisi,  the  public  transport  network  has  deteriorated.  Further, \ntrams  and  trolleybus  services  have  been  discontinued.  The  urban  transport  network  in  the \ncapital comprises a two-line metro system, 125 bus routes, and 188 microbus routes operated \nby public and private companies. The two T-shaped metro lines were designed as the backbone \nof  the  city  transport  system  and  carry  260,000  passengers  daily.  Improvements  to  the  rolling \nstock  have  been  made  since  2007.  In  1985,  its  green  line  was  extended  and  in  2000  a  new \nstation  at  Vazha-Pshavela  was  opened.  However,  an  extension  to  the  university  district  was \nnever  completed.  This  is  creating  traffic  bottlenecks  in  the  area.  Although  a  modern  ticketing \nsystem has been introduced, management, marketing and commercial operations are weak. In \nJuly 2009, a significant milestone was reached in network integration through the merger of the \nmetro and bus companies. The reorganization is ongoing and efficiency and productivity gains \nare expected in the short term. \n \nSector  policy,  strategy  and  roadmap. The central government wants the cities to be \n8. \nthe  engine  of  economic  growth  and  job  creation.  The  government  emphasizes  city  cluster \ndevelopment and the delivery of quality infrastructure and urban services. These are considered \nessential  to  increase  quality  of  life,  attract  investment  and  increase  productivity  and \ncompetitiveness.  The  strategic  vision  is  shared  by  all  municipalities.  In  this  regard,  the \nGovernment  has  been  working  out  an  urban  renewal  strategy  and  supporting  business  plan. \nThe  work  is  complete,  although  some  refinements  to  both  will  be  needed  overtime.  Urban \ntransport and various related services lie at the core of this strategy and business plan. A policy \nframework  is  in  place  for  this  purpose.  It  outlines  key  guiding  principles  and  criteria  for \ninvestment  and  follow-up  operations,  including  competition,  private  sector  involvement, \nefficiency,  fairness,  transparency,  environmental  sustainability,  value  for  money  with  regard  to \ncapital investment, maintenance and sound service provision.  \n \n9. \nThe  long  term  investment  program  underpinning  the  urban  strategy  amounts  to  $1.1 \nbillion. This is an estimate for the period 2010-2020. A medium term slice of this program (for \n2010-2016) is estimated at $700 million. This is over and above the $400 million already spent \nbetween  2005  and  2010.  With  regard  to  urban  transport,  the  target  is  to  improve  its  reach, \nquality  and  continuity.  It  also  pursues  greater  efficiency  and  tighter  environmental  safeguards. \nOne policy directive is to favor nonmotorized transport use to reduce pollution, noise, and traffic \naccidents,  and  improve  living  conditions.  The  strategic  objectives  for  urban  renewal  and \ntransport are fully consistent with the strategy agreed by Georgia and ADB for the purposes of \nthe  ADB  assistance  program  in  the  country 3  and  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  sustainable  transport \nobjectives. 4  The  roadmap  comprises  sequenced  investments,  including  private,  public  and \npublic/private  initiatives.  It  also  includes  municipal  reforms  and  capacity  building  (policy, \nplanning and oversight). The government, the Municipal Development Fund of Georgia (MDF),5 \nand the Tbilisi and other municipalities have asked ADB to help them tackle the urban transport \nproblem  within  the  framework  of  the  urban  renewal  strategy.  The  existence  of  a  policy \nframework, strategy and roadmap also happens to be preconditions for the use by ADB of the \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) as a funding modality. \n \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2007.

Manila;  and  ADB.  2010. \n\nSustainable Transport Operational Plan. Manila. \n\n5  Set  up  in  1997  for  a  World  Bank  project,  MDF  channels  donor  funding  for  municipal  projects  (from  EBRD, \nEuropean Union, KfW, Millennium Corporation Challenge, and ADB) and has implemented more than 930 projects.  \n\n\fDonor  coordination.  The  urban  sector  has  been  attracting  finance  and  advice  from \n10. \nother  donors,  including  the  World  Bank  and  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and \nDevelopment (EBRD). The former financed transport investments in Tbilisi in 2002 and 2008 \u2013 \nfocusing mainly on road safety, traffic management, and parking. EBRD extended finance for a \nbus  company  fleet  renewal  in  Tbilisi  in  2005  and  in  Batumi  in  2008.  EBRD  also  worked  on  a \nredistribution of microbus licenses to rationalize routes, upgrade and reduce fleets, and improve \ninformation management systems. ADB has been requested to complement these interventions \nthrough  investments  in  public  transport,  habitat  and  urban  environment,  coastal  waterfront \nrenewal,  road  network  expansion,  traffic  management  and  institutional  reforms.  EBRD  is \nparticularly  interested  in  establishing  a  strategic  alliance  with  ADB  in  the  Caucasus  and  other \nparts  of  Central  Asia  to  expand  operations  in  the  urban  sector.  Other  donors  (bilateral  and \nmultilateral)  will  also  be  encouraged  to  work  with  ADB  for  the  same  purpose.  The  investment \nrequirements  exceed  the  financing  available  from  any  individual  institution.  ADB  will  consider \njoint  and  parallel  co-financing  partnerships  throughout  the  implementation  of  the  MFF.  In \nparticular, it will promote public-private initiative in the sector. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n11. \nImpact. The investment program and MFF will improve the urban environment, the local \neconomy,  and  living  conditions  within  urban  areas.  This  will  expand  economic  growth,  job \nopportunities and environmental sustainability (See DMF in Appendix 1). \n \n12. \naffordability of urban transport infrastructure and services (See DMF in Appendix 1). \n\nOutcome.

The overall investment program is $1.1 billion (2010-2020). The \n13. \nmedium  term  slice  falls  just  under  $700  million  (2010-2016).  An  MFF  is  the  preferred  funding \nmodality  on  account  of  its  flexibility,  sequencing  of  investments  and  the  existence  of  a  sound \npolicy  framework,  strategy,  and  roadmap.  The  size  of  the  MFF  is  $300  million.  This  will  be \nstructured into three tranches. The first tranche amounts to $85 million. Four subprojects have \nbeen  assessed  and  are  ready  for  implementation  (See  linked  document  14).  Tranche  2  will \namount  to  $100  million.  It  has  high  profile  investments  some  of  which  are  already  under \npreparation  (See  linked  document  14).  Tranche  3  is  estimated  at  $115  million  and  the \ninvestments  have  been  already  pre-identified.  The  finance  under  Tranche  2  and  3  may  vary, \ndepending on project readiness and final design features. \n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 1: Investment Program Plan \n($ million) \n\nItem \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nInvestment Program (2010-2020) \nBase Costa \n1.

The overall program will be funded mainly by the government and the \nmunicipalities.  External  finance  is  only  being  raised  at  this  stage  to  support  a  slice  of  the \nmedium term investment plan. The government has requested an MFF in an amount up to $300 \nmillion  to  help  finance  a  part  of  the  investment  program.  The  MFF  will  consist  of  several \ntranches,  subject  to  the  government\u2019s  submission  of  related  periodic  financing  requests, \nexecution of the related loan and project agreements for each tranche, and fulfillment of terms \nand  conditions  and  undertaking  set  forth  in  the  framework  financing  agreement.  The  first \ntranche of the MFF will be financed from ADB's Special Funds resources (Asian Development \nFund  ADF),  will  have  a  32-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  an  annual    interest \nrate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the loan and project agreements for tranche 1.  \n \n15. \nThe  government  has  specifically  requested  flexibility  in  the  use  of  ADF  resources  for \nsubsequent  tranches.  It  is  understood  that  the  provision  of  any  such  additional  ADF  financing \nwill be accompanied by a corresponding reduction in the available OCR financing, so that in any \nevent  the  total  financing  provided  by  ADB  will  not  exceed  the  MFF  amount  of  $300  million \nequivalent.  Any  additional  ADF  allocation  will  be  subject  to  (i)  the  general  availability  of  ADF \nresources  from  time  to  time,  (ii)  Georgia\u2019s  access  to  such  resources  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  then \napplicable Graduation Policy6 and the requirements of the ADF donors, and (iii) the availability \nof such resources to Georgia pursuant to ADB\u2019s then applicable policy on performance-based \n\n                                                 \n6  Currently: ADB. 2008.

This will ensure full component compatibility with \nthe  existing  system,  and  thus  passenger  safety. 8 Such  procurement  will  still  be  carried  out \nthrough competitive bidding following ADB rules.  \n \n18. \nThe MFF as a whole, and the first tranche in particular, includes finance (Component C) \nto support project management, project preparation (subsequent tranche due diligence), design \nwork, project monitoring, reporting and institution capacity building (including support to improve \nplanning,  policy  formulation  and  training).  Advisory  services  will  be  secured  for  this  purpose  - \nfrom  firms  and  individuals  \u2013  selected  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \n\n                                                 \n8 The existing metro network has been built following Soviet metro standards. Technical due diligence has shown that \nsome critical components of the signaling and energy system will need to be procured from nonmember countries. \nThe metro company has traditionally imported such items from nonmember countries. This has been estimated at \nless than 10% of the total financing assigned to this particular subproject. Details are shown in the FAM and will be \nupdated before each PFR. ADB members could supply alternative technology but as the extension represent only \n1.5 km out of 28.5 km, the technological jump for the entire network will be too costly. All other components will be \nprocured from ADB members countries. \n\n \n\n\fConsultants. To speed up project implementation, advance contracting and retroactive financing \nof eligible expenditures will also be allowed.9 \n \n19. \n\nTranche 1 subprojects are as follows: \n(i) \n\nthe completion of a 1.5 kilometer (km) Tbilisi metro extension on Vazha Pshavela \nAv.) to the university district serving 150,000 inhabitants;  \nthe  redevelopment  of  Gorgasali  embankment  in  Tbilisi,  including pedestrianized \naccess to the river from the old city to enhance tourism appeal;  \nthe  upgrading  of  20  km  of  the  Mestia  urban  area  road  network  to  allow  year-\nround  accessibility  to  this  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural \nOrganization (UNESCO) heritage site and stimulate tourism; and  \nthe urban renewal of main avenues in Kutaisi through the introduction of a 26-km \ncycle network to provide transport alternatives. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n20. \nTechnical  due  diligence  was  performed  for  the  investment  program  and  included  an \nassessment  of  the  strategy  and  policy  framework,  roadmap,  investment  program,  and  specific \ninvestment  proposals  under  the  first  tranche  (physical  and  non  physical).  The  due  diligence \nwork confirmed these activities to be in order, sound and of a high quality standard (see linked \ndocument 14). Besides internal ADB staff assessments, independent external consultants were \nalso  engaged  to  help  with  this  work.  Due  diligence  for  some  tranche  2  subprojects  is  already \nunder way.10  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n21. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  and  financial internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR) \nfor  tranche  1  investments  were  calculated  (see  Linked  document  7).11 The  major  economic \nbenefit is savings in travel time. Savings in vehicle operating costs per kilometer and a reduction \nin  traffic  accidents  are  also  part  of  this  return.12 The  analysis  showed  all  subprojects  to  be \neconomically viable, with EIRRs ranging from 12.6% to 14.4%, and an estimated economic net \npresent  value  from  $1.05  million  to  $3.90 million  at  a  12%  discount  rate.  Sensitivity  analysis \nconfirmed this economic viability. For most scenarios, EIRR values were above 12%. However, \nfor  some  subprojects,  significant  increases  in  capital  costs  (20%)  or  significant  decreases  in \ntraffic  (20%)  result  in  EIRRs  of  less  than  12%.  An  economic  and  financial  analysis  will  be \nconducted for all future subprojects financed under the MFF. A financial cost\u2013benefit analysis of \nthe metro extension (included in tranche 1) shows an FIRR of 5.3%. This exceeds the weighted \naverage  cost  of  capital  (0.85%).  Sensitivity  and  risk  analysis  revealed  this  subproject  to  be \nsensitive to high revenue and cost variations. \n \n\n                                                 \n9  The government was informed that expenses under advance contracting can be financed retroactively only if the \nprocedures  (including  advertising)  comply  with  ADB\u2019s Procurement  Guidelines  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants.  The  government  acknowledges  that  ADB\u2019s  concurrence  with  the  procedures,  documentation,  or \nproposals for award does not commit ADB to finance such expenses, or the related project. \n\n10 Mtkvari bridge in Tbilisi, Anaklia footbridge, Batumi and Anaklia urban waterfront protection measures and Tbilisi\u2013\n\nRustavi urban road link (Linked document 14). \n\n11 According  to  ADB.  1997.

The  capabilities  and  systems  at \nMDF are considered sound. A procurement capacity assessment demonstrates high capacity to \nmanage  procurement  using  international  and  national  competitive  bidding  according  to  ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment,  MDF,  and  tranche  1  participating  municipalities.  The  specific  policy  requirements \nand  supplementary  measures  on  the  governance  front  are  described  in  the  FAM  (See  linked \ndocument 3). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nTranche  1  will  directly  benefit  1.53  million  urban  residents  (35%  of  the  national \n23. \npopulation  and  66%  of  the  urban  population),  and  will  improve  living  conditions  and  the \neconomic and urban environment of participating municipalities. The potential beneficiaries are \nlocal  residents  without  cars,  students,  commuters,  and  road  and  public  transport  users. \nBusinesses  will  benefit  from  greater  people  mobility  and  connectivity.  The  poor  and  socially \nexcluded  will  benefit  from  (i)  better  access  to  the  city  and  other  activity  centers,  (ii) affordable \ntransport  alternatives,  (iii)  better  living  conditions  and  less  pollution,  (iv)  employment \nopportunities  from  road  construction  and  maintenance;  and  (v)  development  of  business \nactivities after project completion. The investment program will contribute to poverty reduction by \nstimulating  economic development.  In particular, it will increase the  mobility of  1.4  million  people \nliving in Tbilisi. It will generate 1,000\u20131,500 jobs during implementation and promote tourism in the \nparticipating  municipalities.  Employment  targets  for  local  unskilled  workers,  women,  and \nvulnerable  groups  and  core  labor  standards  have  been  included  in  the  Summary  Poverty \nReduction  and  Social  Strategy  and  Gender  Action  Plan  and  will  be  monitored  (See  linked \ndocument 9). \n \nHealth.  Health  hazards  from  car  pollution  and  traffic  accidents  will  be  reduced. \n24. \nReductions in congestion, noise, and exhaust fumes, and an increase in green and pedestrian \nareas will benefit health and quality of life. Shorter travel times and better transport services will \nimprove  lives\u2014especially  women,  the  elderly,  and  children\u2014as  they  will  have  better  access  to \nsocial  services  such  as  schools,  universities,  hospitals,  and  clinics.  Awareness  training  on \nHIV/AIDS  and  sexually  transmitted  infections  is  to  be  included  in  all  civil  works  bidding \ndocuments and will be monitored during the implementation. \n \nGender.  The  MFF  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  It  will  improve \n25. \naccess  to  transport  for  women.  Gender-specific  actions  are  listed  in  the  Gender  Action  Plan. \nRecommended  measures  include  gender  targets  for  recruitment,  capacity  building  activities, \nconsultation participation. More statistics will be disaggregated by sex. Women will have greater \nrepresentation at the decision-making level in the sector agencies (see linked document 10). \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nEnvironment.  An environmental assessment and review framework13 was approved by \n26. \nthe  government  on  16  April  2010  (See  linked  document  11).  Four  initial  environmental \nexaminations  have  been  carried  out.  The  environment  classification  for  tranche  1  is  B  as  its \nsubprojects  will  not  have  significant  irreversible  or  permanent  negative  environmental  impacts \nduring  or  after  construction.  MDF  will  require  the  contractor  to  refine  and  implement  the \nenvironmental  management  plan  (EMP)  prepared  in  the  initial  environmental  examination, \n\n                                                 \n13 In compliance with national laws and ADB. 2009. Safeguards Policy Statement. Manila.  \n\n \n\n\fincluded in the environmental assessment and review framework. EMP will be an integral part of \nconstruction contracts. \n \n27. \nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement.  A  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework \nwas  approved  by  the  government  on  6  February  2010  (See  linked  document  12).  It  specifies \ncompensation  eligibility  and  entitlements;  land  acquisition  and  resettlement-related  conditions \nfor  subproject  implementation;  and  mechanisms  for  the  preparation  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement plans for subprojects entailing land acquisition and resettlement. The resettlement \nclassification  for  tranche  1  is  C  as  no  land  acquisition  and  involuntarily  resettlement  is \nenvisaged for the subprojects. \n \n28. \nIndigenous  peoples. The investment program area does not include communities that \nmay be defined as indigenous peoples under ADB's Safeguards Policy Statement (2009). The \nindigenous peoples' impact classification for the MFF and all tranche subprojects is C. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe  MFF  has  limited  technical  risks.  The  metro  extension  and  the  Gorgasali  tunnel \n29. \nconstruction will not require sophisticated construction methods. Works on both projects can be \neasily  controlled  and  monitored.  Civil  works  and  goods  packages  will  be  procured  through \ninternational competitive bidding and appropriate performance guarantees will be required from \nthe  contractors.  MDF  has  large  experience  with  ADB  procurement  rules.  In  addition,  it  will  be \nsupported by an experienced project management team. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nGorgasali tunnel may encounter archeological \nremains during construction near the old city. \nUnexpected hydrological disturbances may \ncompromise the completion of the metro tunnel and \nunderground station \nSome metro equipment may be sourced in \nnonmember countries. Inappropriate equipment \nmay jeopardize metro functioning and safety.  \nProjects funded by other donors may reduce the \navailability of contractors. \nPossible cost overruns due to inflation and the \nfluctuations in construction costs. \nThe selection of civil works projects may be \ninappropriate. \nUrban transport infrastructure improvement may \nincrease maintenance cost and operation subsidies \nfor public transport operators. \nMDF capacity for implementing large and \nsophisticated works is limited. \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nChance finds procedures will ensure that any cultural or \narcheological evidences will be properly handled and preserved. \nHydrological risk assessment has been undertaken and proper \nmonitoring is planned. Prevention and corrective measures will be \ntaken to control the risks during work completion and operation.  \nThe government has requested a waiver to avoid jeopardizing the \nproper operation of the metro. \n\nLarge EPC contracts will be encouraged for civil works projects. \nFinancial advisors will provide procurement assistance.  \nThe investment program plan includes price contingencies of 8% \nto cover these extra costs. \nThe urban transport sector road map lists priority projects and will \nguarantee the relevance of all projects. \nInstitutional improvement and assistance for PPP included in the \nMFF provide additional revenues for the urban transport sector \nand reduce the subsidy burden for the municipality. \nSpecific funding has been allocated to cover consulting services, \nsupport and additional staff with experience and suitable skills \n\nEPC  =  engineering,  procurement,  and  construction;  MDF  =  Municipal  Development  Fund;  PPP  =  public\u2013private \npartnership.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n30. \nThe  government  and  MDF  assure  ADB  that  implementation  work  will  conform  to  all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement.  These  warranties  and \nrepresentations  are  described  in  the  FAM  and  relevant  loan  documents.  The  government  and \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fMDF  have  given  ADB  certain  undertakings  for  the  MFF.  These  are  included  in  a  framework \nfinancing  agreement  (See  linked  document  1).  Specific  covenants  agreed  by  the  government \nand MDF with respect to individual tranches under the MFF will be included in loan and project \nagreements for respective tranches. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n31. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  multitranche  financing  facility  would  comply  with  the \nArticles  of  Agreement  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove the provision of loans under the multitranche financing facility in an aggregate principal \namount not exceeding $300,000,000 equivalent to Georgia for the Sustainable Urban Transport \nInvestment Program comprising: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nloans  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  with  interest  and  other  terms  to  be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB's  then  applicable  policies  relating  to  Special \nFunds resources, subject to conditions set forth in paragraph 14 of this report; and \nloans from ADB's ordinary capital resources, with interest and other terms to be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB's  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility, \n\n \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in \nthe framework financing agreement presented to the Board. \n \n32. \nI also recommend that the Board approve the proposal set forth in paragraph 17 of this \nreport  that  the  metro  equipment  procured  from  nonmember  countries  of  ADB  be  eligible  for \nfinancing  under  the  Sustainable  Urban  Transport  Investment  Program.  If  the  requisite \naffirmative  vote  of  Directors  representing  not  less  than  two  thirds  of  the  total  voting  power  of \nADB's members, pursuant to Article 14(ix) of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, is not obtained \nfor  this  recommendation  and  the  Board  only  approves  the  recommendation  in  paragraph  31, \nthen only metro equipment procured from member countries of ADB will be eligible for financing \nunder the Program. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n25 June 2010 \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\n \nDesign Summary \n\nImpact \nImproved urban \nenvironment, expanded \nlocal economy, and \nbetter living conditions \nwithin urban areas \n\nOutcome \nEfficient, reliable, and \naffordable urban \ntransport services \nprovided in relevant \ncities \n \n \n\nOutputs: \n1.
