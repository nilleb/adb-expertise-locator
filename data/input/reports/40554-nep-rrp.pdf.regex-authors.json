An environmental assessment and review procedures, initial \nAssessment  environmental examinations for core subprojects, and a summary initial \nenvironmental  examinations  were  prepared  and  are  included  in  the \nsupplementary appendixes. \n   \nRationale   Nepal has made significant progress in combating poverty and improving \nthe standard of living even in a conflict environment. This is evidenced by \nincreases in per capita income and consumption for all quintiles of the \npopulation. However, progress has been uneven with districts far removed \nfrom the center having fewer economic opportunities and poorer service \ndelivery.  As  a  result,  the  most  isolated  people,  disadvantaged  women, \nethnic  groups,  and  castes  have  benefited  less  from  development \ninterventions.  Similarly,  political  and  administrative  reforms  have  been \ninadequate to improve service delivery, transparency, accountability, and \ninclusiveness. Nepal, with a Gini coefficient of 47.3 in 2003, has the highest \nrate of inequality in Asia. \n \nIn  the  aftermath  of  armed  conflict,  Nepal  has  shown  commitment  and \npragmatism  in  its  efforts  to  tackle  both  the  political  and  development \nagenda,  as  evidenced  by  actions  taken  to  bring  about  electoral  and \nadministrative  reform  aimed  at  increasing  the  effectiveness  of  poverty \nreduction  policies,  service  delivery,  and  inclusive  growth.  Nonetheless, \ncontinuing attention to policies that influence economic opportunities and \npublic service delivery to improve inclusion and governance is required. \nThe  Government\u2019s  Three-Year  Interim  Plan  forms  the  basis  for  the \neconomic and social transformation of Nepal. \n \nThe country has one of the lowest road densities for a landlocked country, \nwith some villages as far as 13 days walk from the nearest road. The lack \nof connectivity is a serious constraint for economic development and social \ninclusion.  The  assessment  made  under  the  Milennnium  Development \nGoals indicates the need for additional 30,000 kilometers (km) of rural \nroads by 2015. The country currently has about 22,000 km of rural roads. \nRoad standards vary significantly. Less than half are motorable and of this \nonly about 60% are categorized as all-weather. The need for development \nof rural transport, particularly of rural roads, is thus huge and will require a \nmajor investment in the medium term. \n ", "ii   \n \nThe  country  operations  business  plan  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  for  Nepal  for  2008\u20132010  foresees  that  substantial  peace  and \ndevelopment dividends could be gained by the economy in the coming \nyears.  The  proposed  Rural  Reconstruction  and  Rehabilitation  Sector \nDevelopment Program (RRRSDP) builds on ADB\u2019s key role in supporting \nthe  processes  for  institutionalizing  good  governance  and  inclusive \ndevelopment  for  poverty  reduction,  to  which  the  Government  has \ndemonstrated commitment. By extending support, ADB will provide much-\nneeded resources for the state building process and poverty reduction by \nsimultaneously (i) improving the policy environment for inclusive growth, \nand (ii) reconstructing and rehabilitating rural infrastructure. \n   \nImpact  Comprising a program grant and a project grant, RRRSDP will reduce rural \npoverty  in  hill,  mountain  and  terai  (lowlands)  districts  in  Nepal  where \nisolation and hardship are common. RRRSDP will focus on immediate post \nconflict  development  priorities  for  accelerating  poverty  reduction  and \ninclusive development, thereby enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency \nof the delivery of public services, and improving access of rural residents to \neconomic opportunities and social services. \n   \nThe Program Grant   \nOutcome  The outcome of the Program will be greater economic and social inclusion, \ngood governance, and accelerated service delivery in rural infrastructure \nthrough improved polices, regulations, and institutions. \n \nThe  policy  matrix  is  structured  around  three  key  outputs  to  achieve \n(i) enhanced poverty reduction and inclusive development, (ii) improved \nand  inclusive  governance  and  decentralization,  and  (iii)  strengthened \nsupport for rural infrastructure development. The outputs are designed to \ndirectly  address  the  core  of  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  by \nreducing exclusion and poverty, which are the underlying root causes of \nthe conflict. The salient features of the policy matrix include (i) increasing \nthe representation of women and excluded groups in political institutions, \nand integrating gender issues in policy instruments; (ii) improving broad \nrepresentation  of  ethnic  groups,  castes,  and  regions  in  civil  service; \n(iii)  improving  inclusiveness  and  access  to  benefits  and  opportunities; \n(iv) strengthening participatory and transparent budgeting; (v) improving \ngovernance  and  decentralization;  (vi)  enhancing  the  implementation \ncapacity of district technical offices; (vii) strengthening capacity for output, \noutcome, and impact monitoring; (viii) improving procurement and financial \nmanagement;  (ix)  supporting  policies  for  private  sector  participation  in \ninfrastructure  development;  (x)  improving  investment  opportunities;  and \n(xi) developing rural infrastructure for disadvantaged communities. \n   \nFinancing Plan  A single tranche program grant of $50 million will be provided from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources upon grant effectiveness, subject to completion of \nall of the policy actions included in the policy matrix. In determining the \namount of the program grant, the following factors were considered: (i) \nscope and relevance of the policy reforms for improving governance, public \nservice delivery, and inclusion; (ii) timeliness of assistance to support the \ncountry\u2019s return to economic, political, and social progress and stability; \n ", "  iii\n(iii)  immediate  cost  of  the  reforms  and  associated  financing  gap;  and \n(iv) government commitment to strengthen the decentralization process for \naccelerated poverty reduction. \n   \nProgram Period  1 January 2008 \u2013 31 December 2011 \n   \nProcurement  The program grant will be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of \nitems produced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding items \nincluded on a list of ineligible items, and imports financed by other bilateral \nand multilateral sources. The recipient will certify that the volume of eligible \nimports exceeds the amount of ADB\u2019s projected disbursements under the \nprogram component in a given period. ADB will have the right to audit the \nuse of the grant proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the recipient\u2019s \ncertification. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Finance \n   \nThe Project Grant \nOutcome  The  outcome  of  the  Project  will  be  improved  connectivity,  enhanced \neconomic and employment opportunities, and increased access to market \nand social services of rural communities. The outputs include (i) improved \nrural roads; (ii) developed and improved community-based supplementary \nrural  infrastructure;  (iii)  enhanced  equity,  employment,  and  income \nopportunities for the poor and disadvantaged; (iv) strengthened institutional \ncapacity  of  the  Ministry  of  Local  Development,  Department  of  Local \nInfrastructure  Development  and  Agricultural  Roads  (DOLIDAR),  district \ndevelopment  committees,  and  communities;  and  (v)  improved  project \nmanagement. \n   \nInvestment Plan  The project investment cost is estimated at $78.4 million, including taxes \nand duties of $4.0 million. \n   \nFinancing Plan  A grant not exceeding $50 million will be provided from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources to finance 63.8% of the total project cost.

A project coordination \nArrangements  unit will be established in DOLIDAR. A project coordinator at class one will \nhead  the  unit  and  report  to  the  secretary  of  the  Ministry  of  Local \nDevelopment through the director general, DOLIDAR. Assisted by central \nimplementation  support  consultants,  the  project  coordination  unit  will \nprovide coordination and guidance for all facets of project implementation, \nincluding engineering, safeguards (environment, social, and resettlement), \nfinancial management, and procurement.  \n \nDistrict development committees will be the implementing agencies in the \ndistricts with the district technical office as the technical wing. Each project \ndistrict will have a district project office established within and led by the \nhead  of  the  district  technical  office,  and  assisted  by  a  district \nimplementation  support  team.  The  district  project  office  will  (i)  prepare \nannual work programs, (ii) finalize detailed subproject designs, (iii) ensure \nall safeguard measures are complied with, (iv) supervise all construction \nactivities,  (v)  organize  training  in  the  communities,  and  (vi)  arrange \nprocurement. \n   \nImpact, Benefits, and  Poverty issues will be directly addressed through the positive impact of the \nBeneficiaries  policy actions on service delivery to the poor and excluded groups. The \n  policy reform process will contribute to overcoming exclusionary barriers, \npromote inclusion, and bring about pro-poor growth. RRRSDP will help \nreform  the  political  institutions  and  bureaucracy  for  improved  service \ndelivery  and  public  accountability  with  positive  impacts  on  poverty \nreduction. Affirmative actions will increase the options of excluded ethnic \ngroups/castes  and  women  to  participate  in  state  administration,  and \nactively increase their control and command over resources. Similarly, for \nthe project grant, utilization of affirmative action will lead to more inclusive \ndevelopment outcomes. \n \nGrowth prospects will be improved because of the introduction of measures \nto  enhance  efficiency  and  transparency.  These  measures  have  the \npotential  to  stimulate  private  sector  productivity  and  investment.  The \nproject  grant  will  generate  employment  and  income  through  the  labor-\nintensive infrastructure work and development of livelihood enhancement \nskills. Linking the rural population with markets and technology, RRRSDP \nwill benefit an estimated 2.6 million people. In terms of direct employment, \nit will generate more than 15.8 million person-days of labor, or 4 years of \nfull-time work for 13,200 rural poor. \n \nRRRSDP  will  improve  and  strengthen  organizational  capabilities  for \ndeveloping and managing rural infrastructure, in particular for coordinating \npolicies and programs, cooperating with local bodies in service delivery, \nand improving implementation capacity. It will build institutional capacity to \n ", "  v\nstreamline  existing  government  mechanisms  for  oversight,  and  the \nmanagement of central and local financial information. \n   \nRisks and  Risks  include  (i)  political  instability,  including  frequent  changes  in  the \nAssumptions  Government; and (ii) weak commitment to implementing new legislation \n  and regulations. Although the political transition could become stalled, the \nfirst risk will be minimized by engaging and supporting the Government in \nits  reconstruction,  rehabilitation,  and  social  and  economic  inclusion \nendeavors. The second risk is mitigated as policy actions taken by the \nGovernment  show  commitment  to  (i)  making  institutions  more \nrepresentative  and  inclusive,  (ii)  improving  service  delivery,  and \n(iii) strengthening institutions for accountability and transparency. These \nactions demonstrate the political commitment and ownership shared by all \nparties and groups at large, and that resources will be available to continue \nthe reform process and expedite implementation of the investment Project. \nOne positive development is the emergence of strong pressure groups for \nreform in civil society. In addition, the program design takes into account \nnational and local implementation capabilities. \n \nRisks for project implementation include weak capacity in the districts to \nmanage multilateral-funded projects, and localized tensions that could slow \nimplementation of the investment Project. These risks are mitigated as the \nproject design provides (i) capacity building programs designed to meet the \nneeds of the participating districts and DOLIDAR; (ii) project-procedure \ntraining  in  the  local  language  and  covering  procurement,  financial \nmanagement,  environment,  and  resettlement;  (iii)  use  of  open  and \nparticipatory  consultative  discussions;  (iv)  institutionalization  of  public \naudits;  (v)  flexibility  in  design;  and  (vi)  building  on  ongoing  activities, \nespecially the Decentralized Rural Infrastructure and Livelihood Project. \nExperience  during  the  conflict  period  shows  that  development  can  be \ndelivered with an appropriate design and participatory modality. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "", " \n \n \n \n ", "", "   \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogram  grant,  (ii)  a  proposed  project  grant,  both  to  Nepal  for  Rural  Reconstruction  and \nRehabilitation Sector Development Program (RRRSDP), and (iii) proposed administration by the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) of a loan to be provided by the OPEC1 Fund for International \nDevelopment (OFID)2 for RRRSDP.

Nepal underwent dramatic political changes in April 2006, 15 \nmonths after direct rule by King Gyanendra. In the wake of mounting confrontation with the King \nand his Government on the issue of restoring democracy, the alliance of seven political parties \nsupported  by  the  Communist  Party  of  Nepal-Maoist  (CPN/M)  launched  nationwide  protests \ndemanding the reinstatement of the dissolved Parliament, and elections to a constituent assembly. \nFollowing the prolonged popular agitation, in April 2006 the King relinquished the state powers he \nhad assumed on 1 February 2005, and reinstated the dissolved Lower House of Parliament. A new \ninterim coalition Government was formed on 2 May 2006, headed by the president of the Nepali \nCongress Party. \n \n3.  Following 6 months of peace dialogue the Seven Party Alliance and CPN/M signed a peace \naccord  in  November  2006.  This  marked  a  major  political  breakthrough,  and  a  prosperous, \npeaceful, and inclusive Nepal is genuinely believed to be within reach after the 11-year armed \nconflict. The landmark Interim Constitution passed by the Interim Parliament on 15 January 2007, \nand amended in March and June 2007 with a view to meeting the demands of the wider public and \nending discrimination underscores the Government\u2019s heightened focus on inclusion as a strategy \nfor enhancing reconciliation, strengthening national unity, and resolving the conflict. The Interim \nConstitution gives legal recognition to cultural diversity; provides for restructuring the state to make \nit more inclusive; and grants special provisions for underprivileged and vulnerable ethnic groups, \ncastes,  and  women  to  enable  them  to  influence  economic  policies,  institutions,  and  political \nprocesses. The challenge will be to develop the guidelines, human resources, and institutional \ncapacity to effectively implement the legislation in the districts. \n \n4.  The withdrawal of the CPN/M from the Interim Government on 18 September 2007 and the \npostponement  of  Constituent  Assembly  elections  originally  scheduled  for  22  November  2007 \nhighlight the complex political and development challenges of the country. While some political \ndifferences between the Seven Party Alliance and CPN/M that led to the postponement of the \nelections  remain  unresolved  (proclaiming  the  country  a  republic  state  before  the  Constituent \nAssembly elections, full proportional representation in lieu of the mixed electoral system), the \nCPN/M is still part of the eight-party alliance and remains firmly engaged in the political process. \nWith  the  continuation  of  the  ceasefire  and  agreement  on  the  management  of  arms,  the \nGovernment  remains  committed  to  take  forward  its  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  efforts \nthroughout the country. Moreover, the Government is aware that despite the fluid political situation, \nit must demonstrate that public services are improving if the political process is to run its course. \nOne of the immediate critical issues for the Government is the availability of financial resources for \ntimely and effective implementation of its policy reforms and inclusion agenda. \n \n                                                 \n1  OPEC is the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. \n2  A project preparatory technical assistance was provided.

Nepal, with an annual gross domestic product (GDP) per capita \nof about $300 (2005 data), is the poorest country in South Asia. With economic liberalization in the \n1990s, the country achieved an annual growth rate of 4.7%; this growth rate later deteriorated, \nbecoming negative in the early 2000s, largely due to the armed conflict that engulfed the entire \ncountry and severely affected tourism and other industries. Export growth also declined sharply \nduring 2000\u20132006 resulting in an annual GDP growth rate of about 2%. \n \n6.  The country has achieved broad macroeconomic stability despite political uncertainty for \nthe past half decade. Average annual GDP growth during 2003\u20132007 was 2.7% and inflation \naveraged 5.5%. The current account balance was 2.2% of GDP, while the budget deficit averaged \n1.4% of GDP. Nepal is classified as a \u201cless indebted country;\u201d but its debt position remains \nvulnerable  due  to  its  poor  export  performance,  low  revenue  to  GDP  ratio,  and  high  aid \ndependency. Nepal\u2019s outstanding external debt stock, which was 36.2% of GDP in fiscal year (FY) \n2006, declined to 29% in FY2007, although total debt stock is estimated at 42.4% of GDP in \nFY2007. The external debt service ratio (% of exports of goods and services) rose to 10.7% in \nFY2007 compared with 9.3% in FY2006. The highly indebted poor country debt sustainability \nformula shows that Nepal\u2019s net present value of external debt to exports declined from 197.8% in \nFY2004 to 171.3% in FY 2006. Based on its past record of timely debt servicing, Nepal has shown \nit is capable of managing its external debt. \n \n7.  The stable economic growth in the 1990s brought significant improvements in access to \nbasic social services, which reduced child mortality, increased primary school enrollment, and led \nto more gender parity in education. With the relatively higher growth in the mid-1990s, including \ngrowth in remittances, the incidence of poverty nationwide declined from 42% to 31% between \n1996 and 2004, a reduction of about 1% a year. This annual rate of decline continued through \n2006 when the incidence of poverty was estimated to have fallen below 30%. While per capita \nincome and consumption grew for all quintiles of the population, the livelihood improvement has \nbeen uneven, exacerbating gender, ethnic, and geographic inequalities. According to ADB's Key \nIndicators 2007: Inequality in Asia (2007), Nepal has the highest rate of inequality in Asia with a \nGini coefficient of 47.3 in 2003. \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan  for  Nepal  for  2008\u20132010 3  foresees  that \nsubstantial peace and development dividends could be gained by the economy in the coming \nyears. The economic performance of FY2007 indicates that expectations of a quick economic \nturnaround following the peace accord have not yet materialized.4 However, with the continuing \npeace process, sound macroeconomic management, expansion of development expenditures, \nstrong focus on devolution, and continuance of policy reforms, GDP growth rates could reach \nabout 3% in FY2008, 5 and continue increasing over ensuing years. \n \n9.  The Government\u2019s Three-Year Interim Plan (TYIP) for FY2008\u2013FY2010 places special \nemphasis on social integration and inclusive development, and forms the basis for economic and \nsocial  transformation  of  the  country.  Its  primary  objectives  are  to  reduce  poverty,  create \nemployment, restructure and rehabilitate infrastructure damaged during the conflict, and establish \npeace. It envisages quick delivery of tangible benefits to the rural poor through increases in \ntargeted  programs  for  vulnerable  groups  and  women.  The  TYIP  projects  attaining  an  annual \naverage economic growth rate of 5.5% per annum and decreasing the percentage of people living \nbelow the poverty line to 24% by 2010. The total estimated development expenditure for the TYIP \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2007. Nepal: Country Operations Business Plan 2008\u20132010.

Asian Development Outlook. Manila.), while the \nGovernment indicated in its FY2008 budget speech an expected 5% growth. \n ", "  3\nis  $4.3  billion  (8.1%  of  FY2007  GDP  and  32.1%  of  total  investment  incurred  in  FY2007), \nrepresenting substantial targeted investments in the short term. \n \n10.  Sector Development Context. Since November 2006, the Government has passed a \nseries  of  legislative  enactments  and  regulatory  frameworks  for  ending  discrimination,  and \npromoting inclusiveness and governance for accelerated service delivery and poverty reduction. \nThese include the Interim Constitution; Non-Resident Nepali Act; and amendments to the Civil \nService Act, Citizenship Act, and Procurement Act. In addition, the Government has undertaken \nbroad policy reforms to improve the effectiveness of public expenditures, strengthen institutions, \nimprove  financial  regulations,  enhance  implementation  capacity,  and  improve  the  investment \nclimate for rural infrastructure development. By initiating improvements in policy regimes even in a \ndifficult political environment, the Government has clearly demonstrated its commitment to the \nreform process. A major challenge for the Government is to sustain the momentum and protect \ngains  made,  while  monitoring  its  implementation  vis-\u00e0-vis  inclusion  and  balanced  regional \ndevelopment. This will require continued attention and sustained assistance in support of the \nreform process. \n \n11.  The Local Infrastructure Development Policy 2004, defines the rural infrastructure sector as \na composite of seven subsectors: (i) rural transport, including rural roads, bridges, and trails; (ii) \nrural water supply and sanitation (WSS); (iii) irrigation and river control; (iv) microhydropower; (v) \nhousing and urban development;  (vi) solid waste management; and (vii) social infrastructure. \nBased on the policy, an interim strategic action plan for local infrastructure development has been \napproved. Of the various rural infrastructure subsectors, the TYIP places the highest priority on \nrural transport development allocating around 60% of investments, followed by rural WSS with 15% \nof investments. \n \n12.  The  Local  Infrastructure  Development  Policy,  which  operationalizes  the  Local  Self-\nGovernance Act 1999, provides guidance for the development of rural infrastructure. The policy \nstipulates  devolving  planning,  design,  construction,  monitoring,  and  maintenance  of  local \ninfrastructure to local bodies such as district development committees (DDCs), municipalities, and \nvillage  development  committees  (VDCs)  with  the  involvement  of  beneficiaries  and  local \ncommunities  for  improvements  in  service  delivery,  cost-effective  operation  and  maintenance \n(O&M), and sustainability of facilities. However, considerable investment in local capacity building \nis required, particularly in Nepal\u2019s remote and lagging districts. \n \n13.  The Nepal Living Standard Survey (2004) highlights the strong correlation between poverty \nand access to economic and social services. To achieve the Millennium Development Goals an \nestimated additional 30,000 kilometers (km) of rural roads are needed by 2015 to provide the \nconnectivity required. At present, the country has an estimated 22,000 km of rural roads. However, \nstandards  vary  significantly.  Less  than  half  are  motorable  and  of  this  only  about  60%  are \ncategorized as all-weather (Appendix 2). The scope for developing rural transport, particularly rural \nroads, is immense and requires a major investment in the medium term. \n \n14.  The Agricultural Perspective Plan 1996 identified lack of access as one of the principal \nreasons for low agricultural growth and high incidence of rural poverty. Lack of connectivity not \nonly constrains agricultural growth but also limits the effectiveness of government efforts to reduce \npoverty by increasing access to gainful employment opportunities, health care, education, and \nother social services. Thus the Government\u2019s strategy for accelerated rural transport development \n0following the onset of relative peace in the countryside augurs well for agricultural development \nand economic and social services to quickly lead to overall poverty reduction. \n \n ", "4     \n15.  During the Tenth Five-Year Plan (FY2002\u2013FY2007), public expenditure consistently fell \nbelow  19%  of  GDP.  This  slump  in  public  expenditure  led  to  low  maintenance  and  rapid \ndeterioration of investments in rural infrastructure, as evidenced by nonfunctioning systems. For \ninstance, water supply coverage is reported to be 77% for the total population, and of this 65% for \nrural areas. Many completed schemes are either in a state of disrepair, or function much below \ntheir design capacity, indicating that a smaller proportion of the population may have access to \npotable water than is indicated by the official estimate. Access to reliable drinking water continues \nto be a major concern in towns, rural areas, and the hills and mountains.  \n \n16.  Despite increasing demand, only about 70% of cultivated land is irrigated, of which 40% \nhas year-round irrigation. In the absence of a functioning O&M system, almost all agency-managed \nirrigation systems deliver irrigation much below their design capacity. Hence, the actual irrigated \narea, seasonal and year-round, may be much lower than official estimates. However, farmer-\nmanaged  irrigation  systems  and  private  shallow  tubewells  function  reasonably  well  due  to \nbeneficiary participation in construction and O&M, evidencing the important role of beneficiaries for \nlong-term scheme sustainability and reliable service delivery.  \n \n17.  ADB  Country  Strategy.  The  2005\u20132009  country  strategy  and  program  for  Nepal6  \nemphasizes the need to address the root causes of the conflict by supporting broad-based growth, \ninclusive development, and good governance. It highlights the need for strong policy reforms and \ncontinued assistance, even in a conflict environment, to enable the country to keep a sustained \nfocus on the development agenda. It emphasizes the need for a substantial increase in investment \nin rural infrastructure, and the need to adopt a decentralized Labor-based, Environment-friendly, \nand Participatory (LEP) approach for rural infrastructure development with provision for careful \nsupervision and monitoring. RRRSDP objectives and approaches are consistent with the thrust \nand emphasis of the country strategy and program. Continued and timely ADB assistance with a \nreasonable  degree  of  flexibility  is  critical  in  helping  Nepal  take  advantage  of  this  unique \nopportunity. By extending support, ADB will provide much-needed resources for continuing the \nstate  building  process,  while  simultaneously  improving  the  policy  environment  to  accelerate \ninclusive growth. \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n \n18.  Poverty and Exclusion. Nepal\u2019s performance during the last decade shows significant \nprogress in combating poverty and improving the standard of living even in a conflict environment. \nHowever, economic and social outcomes in rural areas and particularly in remote areas need \nsubstantial improvement. Pro-poor and inclusive development has been constrained by a legacy of \nethnic-, gender-, and caste-based exclusion, and extreme centralization in Kathmandu, which has \nhampered transparency and accountability. As a result, districts more distant from the center have \nfewer  economic  opportunities,  poorer  service  delivery,  and  higher  joblessness.  A  catalyst  is \nneeded to improve this environment and generate employment.  \n \n19.  Persistent poverty in rural areas is linked to the unequal distribution of state resources, lack \nof connectivity, and commensurate high transport costs, which discourage the movement of goods \nand services, including ideas and technologies within and outside the region. These factors have \ncontributed to regional disparities in economic and human development outcomes as well. The \nlack of physical connectivity also correlates to the lack of social connectivity and social capital. In \nthe absence of policy reforms addressing the structural barriers that limit access to productive \nassets and markets, disadvantaged women, ethnic groups, and castes have not been able to \n                                                 \n6 ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program for Nepal 2005\u20132009. Manila. \n ", "  5\ncapitalize  on  the  benefits  of  development  interventions  as  evidenced  by  their  lower  human \ndevelopment indicators compared with other social groups. \n \n20.  Governance  and  Service  Delivery.  The  country\u2019s  experience  with  parliamentary \ndemocracy since 1990 significantly increased political awareness. However, subsequent political \nand administrative reforms were inadequate to ensure the redistribution of economic and political \npower  for  improving  service  delivery,  transparency,  accountability,  and  inclusiveness. \nCompounding the cycle of weak service delivery and lack of representation, the conflict also \ndismantled local governments and stalled decentralization, which was initiated in 1999 through \nenactment of the Local Self-Governance Act. The act provides the VDCs, DDCs, and municipalities \nwith  a  legal  framework  for  financial  and  development  responsibilities  in  their  own  localities. \nHowever, while local bodies were made responsible for service delivery, sector policies continued \nto assign these responsibilities to the central Government. In addition, all 75 districts in the country \nregardless of population size, socioeconomic status, and fiscal and human capacity were given the \nsame responsibilities in terms of the provision of services. Differences in endowments, the lack of \nclarity in the assignment of functions between sector line ministries and local bodies, and slow \nfiscal  transfers  from  the  center  to  local  bodies  have  constrained  service  delivery  and  good \ngovernance. \n \n21.  Institutional  Capacity.  Institutional  responsibility  for  rural  infrastructure  lies  with  the \nDepartment of Local Infrastructure Development and Agricultural Roads (DOLIDAR), under the \nMinistry of Local Development (MLD). DOLIDAR has the mandate to be involved in all seven \nsubsectors of rural infrastructure, and has accumulated successful experience in planning and \nimplementing rural roads in coordination with the DDCs. MLD and DOLIDAR\u2019s involvement in WSS \nstarted in 1997 and expanded after approval of the Local Infrastructure Development Policy, which \nmandated the DDCs to implement water supply projects serving up to 1,000 people. However, \nDOLIDAR\u2019s capacity needs to be strengthened for it to be involved in the remaining subsectors \nand to be able to deliver desired results. To this end, the Institutional Strengthening Action Plan \nwas formulated to rationally map out capacity development. The World Bank and ADB have been \ncontributing to plan implementation to improve capacities at MLD, DOLIDAR, and the DDCs. \n \n22.  Several donor agencies support DOLIDAR\u2019s rural infrastructure development programs, \nparticularly rural roads. Though donors have coordinated well in the sector, projects have taken \nseparate approaches for implementation, putting pressure on the Government and the DDCs\u2019 \nlimited technical and administrative capacity, and creating confusion among government staff. \nAlthough quality is maintained in donor-supported rural roads, these standards are not rigorously \napplied to Government- and DDC-financed projects and programs. Approaches and institutional \narrangements thus need to be harmonized for implementing rural roads regardless of financing \nsource  with  standards  and  best  practice  approaches  adopted  (including  LEP,  supplementary \ntraining and investment for communities, and community audit). \n \n23.  Interim  Development  Requirements.  The  TYIP  estimates  substantial  investment \nrequirements  to  restore  and  rehabilitate  rural infrastructure,  and  implement  appropriate  policy \nreforms to achieve the intended goal of social and economic transformation of Nepal. Support to \neffectively  implement  legislation  and  policies  to  ensure  inclusion  and  poverty  reduction  is \nimperative to keep a sustained focus on development. Similarly, the DDCs need institutional \nstrengthening to effectively implement activities identified for all the subsectors. Despite DDC \ncapacity constraints, investment in the rural road subsector is justified due to the Government\u2019s \npriority; DDC experience and confidence in planning, implementation, and management; and rural \nroads\u2019 direct contribution to enhanced connectivity, productivity, and employment opportunities. \nInvestment in WSS and other subsectors is also justified if the schemes are small-scale, are under \nthe jurisdiction of the DDCs, and serve poor households and disadvantaged communities. \n ", "6     \n \n24.  External  Assistance.  Numerous  rural  infrastructure  development  and  livelihood \nimprovement projects in Nepal have focused on community-based infrastructure. Projects on rural \nroads,  WSS,  and  irrigation  have  been  supported  by,  among  others,  ADB,  Department  for \nInternational Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom, Swiss Agency for Development and \nCooperation (SDC), and the World Bank. Major ongoing rural infrastructure projects in line with the \nGovernment\u2019s decentralization framework include the ADB-supported Community-Based Water \nSupply and Sanitation Sector Project, ADB- and SDC-supported Decentralized Rural Infrastructure \nand Livelihood Project (DRILP), SDC-supported District Road Support Program, DFID-supported \nRural Access Program, and World Bank and SDC-supported Rural Access Improvement and \nDecentralization Project. Details on externally aided projects in the sector are provided in Appendix \n3. \n \n25.  Lessons. The design of RRRSDP considers lessons from completed and ongoing rural \ninfrastructure projects, as well as reform programs in Nepal and other countries. Lessons include \nthe following: \n \n(i)  The fluid political environment may affect the Government\u2019s ability to implement \nreforms effectively and at the required pace. The policy conditions, including major \ninstitutional reforms, must be based on Government capacity and willingness to \nimplement,  in  consensus  with  concerned  stakeholders  and  agencies.  An \nincremental process-oriented approach that allows momentum for reforms to build \nand support the process itself will have a higher potential to deliver results. \n(ii)  Rural roads are accorded the highest priority for rural infrastructure development, \nincome generation, and poverty reduction. The full impacts of road investments will \nbe realized when complemented by community-based, demand-driven, small-scale \ninvestments.  \n(iii)  Increasing community ownership and commitment for O&M requires analysis of \nuser demands and needs, while securing user participation in all stages of the \nproject cycle. \n(iv)  The LEP approach calls for a flexible design and requires adequate up-front support \nfor community and labor group mobilization and training, including timely technical \nbackstopping and supervision, to ensure quality standards and compliance with \nsafeguard measures. \n(v)  While the DDCs are responsible for planning and implementing rural infrastructure, \nthe central Government has an important role in policy formulation for regulating \ndesign  standards,  implementation  procedures,  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards,  eligibility  and  prioritization  criteria,  and  financial  management \nprocedures including the provision of technical oversight. \n(vi)  Resources  for  preparation  and  implementation  of  required  social  safeguard \nmeasures including resettlement plans should be made available on time to avoid \nproject start-up delays. A government resettlement policy is needed so that each \nproject does not need to generate an additional framework. \n(vii)  O&M needs to be addressed from the beginning of subproject development to \nrespond to such issues as skills shortage, weak capacity, and resource availability, \nand withstand political bias for new construction over maintenance. \n \n26.  Rural Reconstruction and Rehabilitation. Following the restoration of relative peace in \nthe  countryside,  the  Government  plans  to  launch  a  concerted  effort  to  rehabilitate  rural \ninfrastructure that was either damaged or rendered nonoperational during the conflict. The policy \nreforms  under  the  program  grant  will  (i)  create  a  conducive  environment  for  successful \nimplementation  of  the  investment  project  focusing  on  rural  infrastructure  reconstruction  and \n ", "  7\nrehabilitation, and (ii) create an environment for ensuring more equal distribution of the direct and \nindirect benefits flowing from such investments. The policy reforms will address ways to enhance \nefficiency  in  implementing  the  investment  activities,  particularly  relating  to  inclusion,  poverty \nreduction,  governance,  financial  management,  procurement,  poverty  prioritization,  and  service \ndelivery. The Project will improve local infrastructure such as rural roads to provide the rural \npopulation with better access to markets and public services. These improvements will lay the \nfoundation for better economic opportunities and assist in reducing poverty. \n \n27.  RRRSDP will also support initiating a harmonized program-based approach (PBA) to rural \ninfrastructure development. Aiming to follow similar fund-flow mechanisms and financial reporting, \nand to adopt identical implementation procedures, a common framework will serve as a vehicle for \ndonors to pool resources and fund rural infrastructure investment more efficiently. \n \n28.  RRRSDP  will  be  implemented  while  the  DRILP  is  still  under  implementation.  DRILP \nimplementation started slowly partly due to the conflict and to the late establishment of the district \nimplementation support team (DIST) and appointment of the district engineers. RRRSDP will seek \nto rectify the latter problem. Sufficient lead time needs to be allowed for preparatory work for \nengineering design, social mobilization, and resettlement and environmental assessments, along \nwith efforts to undertake these activities simultaneously as much as possible. \n \n29.  The project grant for RRRSDP will focus on Nepal's 20 districts7 not yet covered by major \ndonor-funded rural road infrastructure projects. The Project will additionally provide complementary \nsupport to the existing 18 DRILP districts8 for rural WSS \u2500 a cited priority of the Government. The \nremaining 37 districts of the country are either already covered or soon to be covered by similar \nprojects including the (i) Rural Access Improvement and Decentralization Project, which covers 20 \ndistricts; the World Bank has committed to expand it to an additional 10 districts; and (ii) Rural \nAccess Program, which covers 7 districts, for which DFID is planning to continue with a follow-on \nproject (Rural Access Program II). With such a coordinated effort, all 75 of the country's districts \nwill be covered by donor-funded initiatives in this sector. \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Impact \n \n30.  RRRSDP will reduce rural poverty in hill, mountain, and terai (lowlands) districts where \nisolation and hardship are common. It will focus on immediate postconflict development priorities \nfor accelerated poverty reduction and inclusive development, thereby enhancing the effectiveness \nand efficiency of the delivery of public services, and improving the access of rural residents to \neconomic opportunities and social services. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n7  The 20 new districts are (i) Dhankuta, Ilam, Jhapa, Morang, Panchthar, and Sunsari from the Eastern Development \nRegion; (ii) Bhaktapur, Chitwan, Dolakha, Kabhrepalanchok, Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Sindhuli, and Sindhupalchowk from \nthe Central Development Region; (iii) Manang, Mustang, and Parbat from the Western Development Region; (iv) Rolpa \nand Rukum from the Midwestern Development Region; and (v) Dadeldhura from the Farwestern Development Region. \n8 The 18 DRILP districts are (i) Okhaldhunga, Solukhumbu, and Taplejung from the Eastern Development Region;  (ii) \nRamechhap from the Central Development Region; (iii) Baglung, Gorkha, Lamjung, and Myagdi from the Western \nDevelopment Region; (iv) Dolpa, Humla, Kalikot, Mugu, Jajarkot, and Jumla from the Midwestern Development \nRegion; and (v) Baitadi, Bajhang, Bajura, and Darchula from the Farwestern Development Region. \n ", "8     \nB.  The Program Grant \n \n1.  Outcome \n31.  The proclamations by the Interim Parliament place inclusion at the center of key legislative \nenactments and address the root causes of the conflict, thus providing the starting point for the \nprogram grant. The outcome of the program grant will be support for the Government in timely and \neffective implementation of reforms for greater economic and social inclusion, good governance, \nand improved service delivery in rural infrastructure. \n \n2.  Components and Outputs \n32.  Building upon the country\u2019s legislative and administrative reforms aimed at increasing the \neffectiveness of poverty reduction policies, service delivery, and inclusive growth, the Program will \nassist the Government in achieving three key outputs: (i) enhanced poverty reduction and inclusive \ndevelopment, (ii) improved and inclusive governance and decentralization, and (iii) strengthened \nsupport for rural infrastructure development. The outputs are designed to address the core goals of \nreducing exclusion and poverty, which are the underlying causes of the conflict, and remain central \nto achieving a lasting peace. The policy matrix in Appendix 4 presents the essential actions \ngrouped under these three headings. \n \na.  Enhanced Poverty Reduction and Inclusive Development \n \n33.  The  Government  has  taken  impressive  policy  initiatives  to  make  institutions  more \nrepresentative  and  inclusive,  and  to  strengthen  their  accountability  and  transparency.  This \ncomponent  supports  efforts  to  (i)  increase  representation  of  women  and  excluded  groups  in \npolitical institutions; (ii) improve broad representation of women, ethnic groups, castes, and regions \nin  the  civil  service;  (iii)  improve  inclusiveness  and  access  to  benefits  and  opportunities;  (iv) \nstrengthen  participatory  and  transparent  budgeting;  and  (v)  mainstream  gender  in  public \nadministration. \n \n34.  Representation  of  Women  and  Excluded  Groups  in  Political  Institutions.  The \nrestoration of democracy in 1990 saw little change in the participation of women, ethnic groups, \nand disadvantaged castes in elected government. One major reason for their underrepresentation \nis their limited participation in political parties, as evidenced by a low 5%\u20136% for women, 15% for \nethnic groups and madhesi, and virtually zero for dalits.9 As a result these groups have had little \ninfluence in selecting candidates for elections who, once in power, appoint cabinet ministers, and \ninfluence the appointment of civil servants and consequently policy decisions. Lessons from the \n1997  local  elections  demonstrate  that  when  electoral  policies  mandate  quotas,  the  political \nrepresentation of the mandated groups increases substantially, as was the case for women. The \nInterim Constitution (2007) envisages bringing about broad electoral reform, and provides for \ninclusiveness in the selection of candidates for the Constituent Assembly by political parties for the \n\u201cfirst  past  the  post\u201d  and  proportional  electoral  systems.  The  Constituent  Assembly  Member \nElectoral Act allocates seats to women, dalits, ethnic groups, madheshis, and the differently-abled, \namong others for the 240 electoral seats under the proportional electoral system. Further, the \nGovernment has demonstrated its commitment to inclusion by ratifying the International Labor \nOrganization  Convention  on  Indigenous  and  Tribal  Peoples  (No.  169).  These  actions  will \nsubstantially increase the representation of women and excluded groups in political institutions, \nand improve accountability and inclusion for economic recovery and growth. \n \n                                                 \n9 Madhesi are traditional residents of the terai, and dalits are socially excluded castes. \n ", "  9\n35.  Gender and Socially Inclusive Civil Service. As in political institutions, the participation of \nwomen,  ethnic  groups,  and  disadvantaged  castes  in  state  bureaucracy  is  negligible.  No \nimprovement was made in the recruitment of gazetted officers from the dalits, ethnic groups, and \nterai castes during the decade post 1990. The share of ethnic groups in the judiciary is a low 2.4% \nand the civil service is only 2.3%. Women comprise 9% of the civil service, with only 2% among the \ndecision makers. The 2007 gazetted amendment of the Civil Service Act provides for new inclusive \nprovisions  by  reserving  45%  of  vacant  posts  for  women,  ethnic  groups,  madheshis,  dalits, \ndifferently-abled, and underdeveloped regions. This has ensured broad representation of ethnic \ngroups, castes, and men and women in the policy-making bodies and state institutions, and will \nincrease the effectiveness of the civil service, and improve public accountability. \n \n36.  Inclusiveness  and  Access  to  Benefits  and  Opportunities.  The  Government  is \ncommitted to remedying exclusion and has taken policy actions and measures to improve the \nconditions of excluded groups. The TYIP Approach Paper highlights inclusion as one of its pillars \nand places special emphasis on social integration, inclusive development, employment generation, \nand  economic  and  social  transformation;  while  directing  attention  to  disadvantaged  women, \nexcluded  and  vulnerable  groups,  including  regions  that  have  been  historically  isolated  from \nmainstream  development.  The  TYIP  envisages  increases  in  targeted  programs  to  protect \nvulnerable groups and women as part of its social protection plan. The budget (FY2008) allocates \nNRs51 billion for community programs based on people\u2019s participation, and social security that will \ndirectly contribute to poverty reduction, and has doubled block grants to the VDCs (NRs1 million \nfor each VDC). The National Planning Commission (NPC) will submit the TYIP to Cabinet for \napproval  by  30  November  2007.  Similarly,  the  Ministry  of  Physical  Planning  and  Works  has \napproved the Interim Guidelines for Enhancing Poverty Reduction Impacts of Road Projects. The \nguidelines have developed procedures in line with the Public Works directive as well as familiarize \nDepartment  of  Road  officials  with  the  basic  concepts  of  poverty  and  linkages  between  road \ninvestments and poverty reduction. \n \n37.  In addition, MLD has prepared an action plan for strengthening the registration of vital \nevents such as birth, death, marriage, divorce, and migration. This will promote more inclusive \nplanning, while facilitating the acquisition of citizenship. A recent ADB study found that the highest \nrates of nonregistration of births were among women, ethnic minorities, and disadvantaged groups. \nSimilarly, the amended Citizenship Act includes provision for the acquisition of citizenship through \nthe mother\u2019s citizenship. This will significantly reduce exclusion, as the possession of legal identity \ninfluences an individual\u2019s access to services, benefits, and opportunities. \n \n38.  Prioritized  and  Transparent  Budgeting.  All  activities  in  the  development  budget  are \nprioritized and ranked in terms of their contribution to poverty reduction (with P1 as the highest and \nP3 the lowest). Prioritization criteria include (i) contribution to poverty reduction, (ii) contribution to \nsector goals, (iii) contribution to regional development, (iv) rationale for government involvement, \n(v) participation, (vi) project status, and (vii) fund commitment. While the criteria made a good start \nfor  targeted  investments,  implementation  experience  indicates  the  need  for  more  robust \nprioritization criteria to secure effective allocation of resources for reducing poverty and promoting \ninclusion. NPC has established a task force with terms of reference to refine the prioritization \ncriteria, which will be reflected in the medium-term expenditure framework of FY2009 and in new \nregional and social programs with secured budget allocations. This will support a more transparent \nand  participatory  budgeting  process  along  with  improved  prioritization  criteria  and  district \nallocations based on poverty and social exclusion.  \n \n39.  Mainstreaming Gender. Gender-based exclusion restricts women\u2019s access to education, \nemployment opportunities, and decision-making processes. To mainstream gender, the Ministry of \nAgriculture and Cooperatives, Ministry of General Administration, and Ministry of Education and \n ", "10    \nSports  have  prepared  gender  strategies  focused  on  alleviating  constraints  and  creating  new \nopportunities for women. These strategies will facilitate monitoring of gender equity and access, \nand inform policy decisions in the respective sectors. \n \nb.  Improved and Inclusive Governance and Decentralization \n \n40.  This component will provide support for (i) support decentralization for inclusiveness; (ii) \nenhance capacity for output, outcome, and impact monitoring; and (iii) improve procurement and \nfinancial management. These policy reforms are envisaged to significantly improve fiscal discipline, \nespecially  in  times  of  political  instability,  and  prepare  the  foundations  for  good  and  inclusive \ngovernance. \n \n41.  Decentralization for Inclusiveness. The Interim Constitution envisions (i) restructuring the \nstate in response to popular demands, (ii) reforming political institutions to make them more \ninclusive, and (iii) providing greater autonomy to local bodies for decision making regarding public \nresources. It also provides for establishing the state restructuring commission to (i) bring about an \nend to discrimination based on class, caste, language, culture, religion, and region by discarding \nthe  centralized  and  unitary  form  of  government,  and  (ii)  make  the  state  more  inclusive  and \ndemocratic  through  progressive  restructuring.  An  acceptable  restructuring  of  the  state  will \ncontribute to securing a lasting peace and end interethnic, caste, and regional tensions. \n \n42.  Strengthened  Capacity  for  Output,  Outcome,  and  Impact  Monitoring.  Improving \ngovernance  and  transparency  for  poverty  reduction  and  inclusive  development  requires \nunderstanding the extent to which public resources are effectively translated into public services. \nMapping fiscal flows and incorporating concepts related to management for development results in \nthe public sector training curricula of Nepal Administrative Staff College will strengthen capacity for \noutput, outcome, and impact monitoring. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) has agreed to expand its \npublic expenditure tracking by instructing the Financial Comptroller General Office to conduct \nsurveys in two sectors per year. Monitoring actual allocations versus budgeted ones will provide \ninsights into constraints and achievement of the intended objectives. \n \n43.  Improved  Procurement  and  Financial  Management.  The  Government  revised  the \nprocurement laws to increase efficiency and transparency resulting in its new Procurement Act \napproved  in  December  2006  and  gazetted  in  January  2007.  The  act  provides  for  a  more \ntransparent and competitive procurement and bidding process for goods, civil works, and services; \nand is in line with acceptable international procedures such as the United Nations Commission for \nInternational  Trade  Law.  The  Procurement  Regulations  were  revised  vis-\u00e0-vis  the  new \nProcurement Act and approved in August 2007. Similarly, the Government has approved the \nrevised Local Bodies Financial and Administrative Regulations (LBFAR) to align them with the new \nProcurement Act and its regulations. The revised LBFAR will (i) increase the financial authority of \nlocal bodies enabling them to provide services swiftly, (ii) improve transparency by providing \ncommunity procurement and public audit, and (iii) enhance accountability by requiring adherence \nto a procurement code of conduct. The program grant will support implementation of the new \nProcurement Act, Procurement Regulations, and LBFAR. \n \n44.  The Government\u2019s decision to establish the Public Procurement Monitoring Office in the \nOffice  of  the  Prime  Minister  and  Council  of  Ministers,  headed  by  a  secretary,  contributes to \ninstitutionalizing accountability and transparency within the state bureaucracy. Furthermore, all \nDDC  accounts  are  now  computerized,  which  will  assist  in  addressing  the  problem  of  weak \naccounting and reporting procedures in the districts. As data will be transferred electronically from \nthe districts to the center, fund releases will be faster, which will expedite implementation and \ndisbursement. To strengthen the procurement capacity of implementing agencies, procurement \nstaff in the DDCs and DOLIDAR will need to be trained. MLD has prepared a training plan for its \n ", "  11\nstaff in DDCs and DOLIDAR. Procurement reform and capacity improvement are expected to \nimprove contract management and procurement procedures. \n \n45.  To improve budget allocation, MLD has approved a manual, Minimum Conditions and \nPerformance Measures, for performance-based budget allocation, collected baseline data for all 75 \ndistricts, and conducted orientation programs in all 75 districts on use of the manual. \n \nc.  Strengthened Support for Rural Infrastructure Development \n \n46.  This  component  will  provide  support  for  (i)  policies  for  private  sector  participation  in \ninfrastructure  development,  (ii)  improving  investment  opportunities  including  infrastructure \ndevelopment, and (iii) rural infrastructure development for disadvantaged communities. \n \n47.  Policies  for  Private  Sector  Participation  in  Infrastructure  Development.  The \nGovernment  is  promoting  private  sector  participation  for  broad-based  labor-intensive  growth. \nClosely related to improving connectivity and rural infrastructure is the need to improve the policy \nenvironment to attract private sector participation in infrastructure development. To improve the \ninvestment  climate,  Nepal  Rastra  Bank  has  approved  a  monetary  policy  that  includes  a \ncommitment to issue separate regulations relating to capital, investment, loan loss provisioning, \nand other regulatory norms for establishing an infrastructure development bank. NPC will establish \na task force with terms of reference to prepare policies for public-private-partnerships. Given the \nscarcity  of  resources,  public-private  partnership  will  increase  the  effectiveness  of  public \nexpenditures. \n \n48.  Investment Opportunities. In response to the demands of nonresident Nepalis (NRNs) for \na more enabling and NRN-friendly policy environment for investment in the country\u2019s development \nprocess, the Government promulgated the NRN Act in August 2007. The act has simplified the \nregulatory environment and administrative procedures for NRNs investing in the country. The \nGovernment presented the draft NRN regulations for implementing the NRN Act to the NRN \nConference on 15\u201317 October 2007. \n \n49.  Rural  Infrastructure  Development  for  Disadvantaged  Communities.  The  Rural \nInfrastructure Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Investment Plan accords high priority and commits \nthe Government to rural transport development. Lack of connectivity is a serious constraint. Nepal \nhas one of lowest road densities for a landlocked country; some villages are as far as 13 days walk \nfrom the nearest road. The interim Strategic Action Plan for Local Infrastructure Development \nenvisages increasing the access of 95% of rural residents including disabled, marginalized groups, \nand dalits to social services, economic opportunities, and resources. DOLIDAR is incorporating \npoverty  and  social  inclusion  concerns  into  its  Approach  for  the  Development  of  Rural  and \nAgriculture Roads with the objective of ensuring that all plans and programs prepared by the DDCs \nand DTOs use poverty and inclusion as prioritizing criteria. \n \n50.  The lack of a common set of guidelines for all infrastructure projects on social mobilization, \ninclusive  participation,  gender  sensitization,  prioritization,  planning,  safeguards  for  vulnerable \ngroups, and environment have been major factors that delay implementation schedules. MLD has \nidentified a common set of guidelines to speed implementation and deliver tangible results. The \nguidelines will ensure inclusiveness and adequate safeguards of vulnerable communities. MLD has \nissued an instruction to all DDCs to ensure the use of these common guidelines. \n \n51.  Similarly, in the absence of a consistent approach to treating safeguard policy issues, NPC \nhas taken the lead in formulating a comprehensive national policy on resettlement, to help identify, \nplan, implement, and monitor involuntary resettlement to minimize displacement, safeguard people \n ", "12    \naffected by development projects, and enhance development impact. NPC has prepared and \nsubmitted the draft National Resettlement Policy to Cabinet for approval.  \n \n3.  Important Features \n52.  The extensive reforms taken by the Interim Parliament to directly address the root causes \nof the conflict merit ADB support for implementation. These reforms aim to end discrimination, \npromote inclusion, and justify support for the continuation of peace and development efforts. The \nGovernment  has  placed  inclusion  at  the  center  of  key  legislative  enactments  and  regulatory \nframeworks for achieving inclusive development outcomes and accelerated poverty reduction. The \nsingle tranche will deliver a peace dividend to Nepal during this critical juncture in the country's \nhistory. The Program builds on Government reforms and furthers ADB\u2019s role as a partner in \nsupporting the process for institutionalizing good governance and inclusive development. The \nProgram  is  designed  taking  into  account  national  and  local  commitment  and  implementation \ncapabilities.  \n \n53.  The program grant will be released in a single tranche upon effectiveness, subject to \nfulfillment of all of the policy actions. The single tranche is justified by (i) compliance with 29 \nactions, which constitute fundamental reforms in governance, inclusion, devolution, procurement, \nand  infrastructure  development  for  poverty  reduction  and  inclusive  development;  and  (ii) \nimprovements in the political environment, and immediate postconflict development requirements. \n \n4.  Financing Plan \n54.  The  Government  has  requested  a  grant  of  $50,000,000  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources upon completion of all of the policy actions included in the policy matrix. In determining \nthe amount of the program grant, the following factors were considered: (i) scope and relevance of \nthe policy reforms for improving governance, public service delivery, and inclusion; (ii) timeliness of \nassistance in support of the process for the country\u2019s return to economic, political, and social \nprogress and stability; (iii) immediate cost of the reforms and associated financing gap (Appendix \n5); and (iv) Government commitment to strengthen the decentralization process for accelerated \npoverty reduction. \n \n5.  Implementation Arrangements \n55.  Program Management. MOF is the Executing Agency, and will coordinate policy, legal, \nand regulatory actions. MOF will ensure that the policy reforms as agreed to by ADB and the \nGovernment and as described in the development policy letter (Appendix 4) are duly carried out in \na timely manner. In particular, MOF will ensure that provisions for reporting, monitoring, auditing, \nand other administrative requirements will be strictly followed. The program grant will support part \nof the Government\u2019s budgetary requirements to undertake postconflict development priorities as \nspecified in its TYIP. \n \n56.  Implementation Period. The Program will be implemented from 1 January 2008 to 31 \nDecember 2011. \n \n57.  Procurement and Disbursement. The program grant will be released in a single tranche \nupon compliance with all the policy actions listed in the Policy Matrix. The grant will be disbursed \nusing the simplified procedures approved by ADB\u2019s Board on 16 April 1998.10 The proceeds will be \nused to finance the foreign exchange cost of items produced and procured in ADB member \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n ", "  13\ncountries, excluding items included in a list of ineligible items (Appendix 6), and imports financed \nby other bilateral and multilateral sources. MOF will certify that the volume of eligible imports \nexceeds the amount of ADB\u2019s projected disbursements under the program component in a given \nperiod. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the grant proceeds, and to verify the accuracy of \nthe MOF\u2019s certification. \n \n58.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to, \nand  discussed  with  the  Government.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Program. To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant \nregulations. Moreover, all relevant ADB guidelines, including the Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time), Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime), and Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time), were brought to \nthe attention of the Government. \n \n59.  Counterpart Funds. The counterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the program \ngrant will (i) supplement the Government\u2019s budget in support of the reform package, and (ii) be part \nof the Government\u2019s contribution to ADB-assisted RRRSDP activities within the scope of the TYIP. \nThese include mostly capital investments and additional investments for immediate postconflict \nrural reconstruction and rehabilitation development works.  \n \n60.  Program Performance Monitoring System. MOF will monitor and report to ADB the \nimplementation of policy actions and their impact on inclusive development, good governance, and \nimproved service delivery, in line with the program impact and outcome indicators agreed upon \nwith the Government.  \n \n61.  Program  Review. Program reviews will be carried out in conjunction with the project \nreviews.  \n \nC.  The Project Grant \n \n1.  Outcome \n62.  The Project will improve connectivity, enhance economic and employment opportunities, \nand increase access to market and social services by rural communities. \n \n2.  Components and Outputs \n63.  The  project  outputs  include  (i)  improved  rural  roads;  (ii)  developed  and  improved \ncommunity-based  supplementary  rural  infrastructure;  (iii)  enhanced  equity,  employment,  and \nincome opportunities for the poor and disadvantaged;11 (iv) strengthened institutional capacity of \nMLD, DOLIDAR, DDCs, and communities; and (v) improved project management. \n \na.  Rural Roads \n64.  Rural roads are the predominant demand according to district surveys conducted by MLD. \nThe roads to be included must be from the district transport master plans.12 \n                                                 \n11  For the purpose of the Project, disadvantaged groups are, as commonly understood, socially excluded castes (dalits), \nethnic groups, madhesi middle caste group, minority Muslims, poor households headed by women, and the isolated \npopulation from remote areas. \n12  The DDC in each district develops a district transport master plan using an analytical, participatory, and consultative \nprocess to identify road priorities for the district. \n ", "14    \n \n65.  In 20 non-DRILP districts, RRRSDP will improve or upgrade about 560 km of rural roads. \nThe civil works will be for continuous roads only (not partial sections) that connect the rural \npopulation to market centers, towns, and the higher road network. Qualifying civil works include (i) \nreconstruction of rural roads damaged due to conflict; (ii) rehabilitation and preservation of rural \nroads that fell into disrepair during conflict; and (iii) rural roads that were planned but could not be \ncompleted due to conflict. The road construction will include an estimated 1,100 meters of bridges \n(a total of about 42 bridges). The roads will be built to DOLIDAR standards, adopting a LEP \napproach. Road-building groups (RBGs) will undertake most subproject works. Only in cases \nwhere the road works are more technical and complex (i.e., bridge construction or paving) will \ncontractors be engaged. \n \n66.  Maintenance. Each participating district should have an O&M strategy, and the Project will \nsupport the DDCs to implement the O&M plan as per the district\u2019s O&M strategy. Each DDC will \nestablish a maintenance fund for maintaining district roads, main trails, and bridges. To support the \ndevelopment of local resources for maintenance, financing for district roads maintenance will be \nprovided under the Project on a matching and declining basis.13 Financing maintenance after \nproject  completion  will  be  the  DDCs\u2019  continuing  responsibility.  Project  assistance  will  also \ncontribute to training for the organization, management, and physical aspects of maintenance. The \nDDCs will form and operate user committees representing transport operators to manage road use, \nmonitor  road  conditions  and  maintenance  performance,  and  mobilize  additional  resources  for \nmaintenance.  In  addition,  the  Road  Board  Nepal  is  required  to  allocate  30%  of  its  annual \nmaintenance allotment to local bodies for local road maintenance, and the DDCs can apply for and \naccess the Road Board funds. \n \nb.  Supplementary Infrastructure \n \n67.  This  component  will  complement  the  rural  road  improvements  by  constructing  and \nrehabilitating community, demand-driven supplementary infrastructure such as social and market \nfacilities, school infrastructure, micro-irrigation, link trails, trail bridges,14 and rural WSS.15 The \ninvestments will typically generate additional linkages and benefits in proximity to the rural road \nsubprojects. Supplementary infrastructure will be implemented using the LEP approach. \n \n68.  Maintenance. O&M of supplementary infrastructure varies with the capture of benefits. In a \ntypical WSS subproject, O&M costs will be borne fully by the users committee with an O&M fund \nestablished with up-front community contributions and a water tariff to meet regular O&M costs of \nthe scheme. For more public or technically complex supplementary infrastructure (for example, \nschool infrastructure or trail bridges), the VDCs will be responsible for maintenance, with technical \nand financial support from the DDC if required. \n \nc.  Community Empowerment \n \n69.  In line with government policies toward inclusion, the Project will strengthen the capacities \nof  communities,  beneficiary  participation,  and  social  cohesion  to  integrate  the  poor  and \ndisadvantaged into the mainstream of development activities. This goal will be achieved through \n                                                 \n13  The Project\u2019s share of road maintenance cost will be 100% in the first year, 75% in the second, 50% in the third, and \n25% in the fourth. The DDCs will provide the remaining required funds on an increasing basis accordingly. \n14  SDC, through an existing presence and capacity in the trail bridge subsector, will provide technical assistance and \nmetal cables to support this initiative under RRRSDP. \n15  Unlike the other supplementary infrastructure, WSS schemes are not tied to the proximity of the rural roads. A typical \nscheme will consist of an intake structure at an existing natural water source (such as a spring or a stream), a \ntransmission pipeline, and a distribution network, with each supply point serving a group of 5 to 10 rural households. \n ", "  15\nactivities that (i) raise awareness of the Project and opportunities (employment, training, and \naccess to subprojects) among all social groups; (ii) organize and train the RBGs for construction, \nusing and building on existing socially mobilized groups; (iii) assist communities in identifying \nsupplementary  infrastructure  and  preparing  proposals;  (iv)  facilitate  beneficiary  participation, \nparticularly of the poorest of the poor, in implementing and maintaining subprojects through pro-\npoor delivery mechanisms including public hearings and social auditing; and (v) ensure capacity in \nmaintenance  of  supplementary  infrastructure.  The  Project  will  target  minorities  and  the \ndisadvantaged for proportional representation in the RBGs, and promote female membership of at \nleast 50% and women as RBG leaders. \n \n70.  In addition to rural infrastructure activities, the Project will support demand-driven skills \ntraining by the social development officer and social mobilizers/facilitators in the DIST who will \nidentify the group-specific training needs first. The training will cover areas such as agriculture and \nlivestock, forestry and soil conservation, microenterprise and skills development, and social (health \nand literacy) awareness and legal rights. The Project will seek to link communities to qualified \ngovernment  and  nongovernment  training  entities,  closely  coordinate  with  ongoing  social  and \ncommunity development initiatives, and facilitate the communities in linking with credit, extension, \nand related service providers.16 These skills and services will enhance the ability of the rural \npopulation to promote their well-being after the termination of employment associated with the rural \ninfrastructure construction. \n \nd.  Institutional Capacity Development  \n \n71.  To  support  the  urgent  need  for  infrastructure  investment  in  rural  communities,  the \nGovernment asked ADB to design a fast-disbursing project. However, assessment of central and \nDDC  capacity,  as  well  as  experience  with  other  rural  infrastructure  projects,  has  shown  that \ninstitutional  capacity  needs  strengthening.  Therefore,  to  enhance  existing  technical  and \nadministrative capabilities at MLD, DOLIDAR, and in the districts, this component specifically \ntargets building institutional capacities. A close linkage would be made with ongoing projects such \nas  the  Decentralized  Local  Governance  Support  Program  financed  by  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme and Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation. \n \n72.  Strengthening Implementation and O&M. The Project will support the implementation of \nthe Institutional Strengthening Action Plan, which is a long-term road map (supported by the \ndonors working in rural infrastructure) for building capacity in MLD, DOLIDAR, and the DDCs. \nDRILP  and  other  relevant  manuals  and  procedures  will  be  updated  where  necessary  and \ndisseminated to the 20 new districts. As quality control and O&M are keys to maximizing the life of \nrural infrastructure investments, laboratory testing equipment will be provided to districts, and \ndistrict staff will be trained on the use and application of laboratory testing for rural roads. Local \nworkshops will be provided for the districts on strengthening O&M procedures and programs. \n \n73.  Enhancing Fiduciary Management and Social Safeguard Compliance. Requirements \nfor procurement, resettlement, and environment have a major impact on the timing of project \nimplementation. Lessons from other rural infrastructure projects indicate that up-front capacity \nbuilding  in  these  specific  areas  significantly  improves  project  implementation  efficiency  and \neffectiveness. This training is particularly needed in the 20 non-DRILP districts. Therefore, this \ncomponent  will  (i)  update  DRILP  procedure  manuals  for  procurement,  resettlement,  and \nenvironment in both English and Nepali; (ii) develop and deliver a related training program through \n                                                 \n16  An example is linking with the ADB-assisted Skills for Employment Project in districts with a common project presence. \nADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Loan to the Kingdom \nof Nepal for the Skills for Employment Project. Manila.  \n ", "16    \ncentral and regional workshops; and (iii) provide individual support in these areas to districts as \nnecessary. \n \n74.  The draft Review of Financial Management and Accountability at the Local Level17 shows \nthat public financial management in the sector is unreliable and requires substantial improvement. \nThe most critical gap is a lack of consistent accounting policies and procedures across districts. \nWhile LBFAR establishes regulations, a manual detailing actual accounting procedures including \neffective internal controls does not exist. To address this, this component will provide financial \nmanagement support to develop an accounting manual, in both English and Nepali, and to develop \nand deliver a related training program in conjunction with procurement matters. \n \n75.  Donor Harmonization. Given the high number of donors and projects in the sector and the \nlimited resources of the Government, the development of an integrated framework to harmonize \ndonor aid and related funding procedures and to move the sector to PBA is justified. Under the \nleadership of MLD, significant discussions have taken place on PBA with key donors including \nADB,  DFID,  SDC,  and  World  Bank.  However,  the  development  and  implementation  of  PBA \nrequires several steps that can take a substantial amount of time (Appendix 7). To take advantage \nof  the  current  donor  momentum  behind  this  initiative,  this  component  will  provide  consulting \nservices to the Government to develop the framework and interim measures to coordinate donor \nprojects. \n \ne.  Project Management Services \n \n76.  A project coordination unit (PCU) has been established in DOLIDAR, but still needs to be \nfully staffed.18 A district project office (DPO)19 will be established in each of the 20 core project \ndistricts. The Project will work with the existing DPOs in the 18 DRILP districts and supplement \neach DRILP DPO with one water supply engineer, a subengineer, and an assistant subengineer to \nimplement rural WSS initiatives. The PCU, assisted by central implementation support consultants \n(Appendix  8),  will  provide  coordination  and guidance  for  all  facets  of  project implementation, \nincluding engineering, safeguards (environment, social, and resettlement), financial management, \nand procurement. The DPOs, assisted by the DISTs (Appendix 9),20 will (i) prepare annual work \nprograms;  (ii)  finalize  detailed  subproject  designs;  (iii)  ensure  compliance  with  all  safeguard \nmeasures; (iv) supervise all construction activities and ensure quality; (v) organize community \ntraining; and (vi) arrange procurement. The PCU and DPOs will be supplied with computers, \nequipment, and vehicles to support project supervision, management, technology, and quality \ncontrol. \n \n3.  Important Features \n77.  In  an  effort  to  address  the  complexities  of  poverty  and  conflict,  the  Project  takes  a \nmultidimensional  approach,  including  infrastructure,  community  development,  training,  and \ncapacity building. The main complement of project works on rural roads is to be accomplished by \nemploying local RBGs, which are to be constituted by targeting the poor and disadvantaged for \ninclusion.  The  supplementary  investments  are  identified  and  undertaken  in  a  demand-driven \nprocess approach. Again, the poor and disadvantaged are targeted for this activity. These groups \n                                                 \n17  World Bank. September 2006. \n18  The PCU will have one project coordinator, two senior divisional engineers, five engineers, one sociologist, one \nenvironmental engineer, one senior resettlement officer, one senior accountant, two accountants, one computer \noperator, one assistant, two administrative assistants, four drivers, and three messengers. \n19  Headed by the DTO chief, the DPO will have one rural infrastructure engineer, one subengineer, two assistant \nsubengineers, one accountant, one administrative staff, one computer operator, one driver, and two messengers. \n20  DIST includes engineering, safeguard, and social mobilization staff, of which a minimum of 33% should be women. \n ", "  17\nwill be provided training to extend their skills and knowledge base to assist employment and \nincome generation after road construction is completed.  \n \n78.  The  Project  adopts  the  LEP  approach,  which  has  strengths  in  providing  income-  and \nemployment-generation for the poor, minimizing environmental impact of machine-intensive road \nconstruction, and generating skills and ownership for O&M (by employing the local population). \nHowever, to be effective, the approach does not lend itself to shortcuts. Significant RBG training, \npreparation, and supervision are required. To reconcile the time required for organizing, training, \nand implementing under the LEP with the Government's articulated desire for rapid employment- \nand income-generating works, the project design seeks to speed preparatory activities by utilizing \nadvance action for consultant recruitment. This will help put expertise in place early after project \neffectiveness  to  assist  and  guide  local  bodies  in  critical  start-up  areas  such  as  (i)  DIST \nprocurement; (ii) financial management (in relation to managing a multilateral-funded project); and \n(iii)  guidance  in  the  requirements  and  standards  for  environment,  resettlement,  and  social \nsafeguards. Additionally, in an effort to expedite implementation, the Project will adopt and extend \nalready compiled and applied procedural guidelines and manuals developed under the DRILP. \n \n4.  Project Investment Plan \n79.  The project investment cost is estimated at $78.4 million, including taxes and duties of $4.0 \nmillion. Summary estimates by component are in Table 1. Detailed cost estimates by expenditure \ncategory and by financier are in Appendix 10.  \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem    Amounta \nA.  Base Costb    \n  1.

Financing Plan \n80.  The  Government  has  requested  a  grant  of  $50,000,000  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources to finance 63.8% of the project cost. The provision of grant assistance is justified by the \npro-poor orientation of the Project and the country\u2019s tight fiscal position. The Government is to \nprovide $15,700,000 equivalent to finance part of the civil works (17% of rural roads and 32% of \nsupplementary infrastructure), 20% of land acquisition and resettlement compensation, 50% of \nrural road O&M, and 100% of project staff salary and taxes and duties. Beneficiaries will provide \n ", "18    \nabout  $2,700,000  equivalent  for  the  construction  (in  kind)  and  O&M  of  supplementary \ninfrastructure. Table 2 summarizes the financing plan.21 \n \n81.  The OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID) will provide a loan of $10,000,000 \nequivalent to jointly finance the rural road civil works. Administered by ADB, the OFID loan will \nhave a 20-year term including a 5-year grace period, with a 1% interest charge per year, and 1% \nservice charge per year. \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total    % \nAsian Development Bank  50.0    63.8 \nOPEC Fund for International Development  10.0    12.8 \nGovernment of Nepal  15.7    20.0 \nBeneficiaries  2.7    3.4 \n  Total  78.4    100.0 \nOPEC = Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n6.  Implementation Arrangements \na.  Project Management \n82.  MLD  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project;  DOLIDAR  will  be  the  central \nImplementing Agency. A project coordinator at class one will head the PCU and report to the MLD \nsecretary through the DOLIDAR director general. In the districts, the DDCs will be implementing \nagencies  responsible  for  local  development  and  coordination,  with  the  respective  DTOs \nresponsible for technical and project management activities. \n \n83.  A  project  monitoring  committee22  in  MLD  chaired  by  the  MLD  joint  secretary  will  \n(i)  monitor  overall  project  implementation,  (ii)  resolve  policy  issues,  (iii)  guide  the  PCU,  and  \n(iv) facilitate interministerial coordination.23 It will meet at least once every 6 months. DOLIDAR will \nestablish a project implementation coordination committee24 to (i) supervise day-to-day project \nimplementation, (ii) review project progress, and (iii) coordinate between DOLIDAR and the DDCs. \nIt will meet at least every 4 months. The DDCs will coordinate all district project activities. A district \nproject coordination committee chaired by the DDC chairperson will be established to (i) coordinate \nwith all relevant line agencies, nongovernment organizations, and civil society; (ii) issue district \npolicy guidelines; (iii) resolve district implementation issues; and (iv) hear complaints about the \nProject. \n \n                                                 \n21 DFID has expressed interest to provide a grant of $20 million equivalent to jointly finance rural road civil works, subject \nto its final approval. SDC also expressed interest to provide the district technical services in four districts of Dolakha, \nKabhrepalanchok, Sindhuli, and Sindhupalchowk. The project scope will be extended and the project investment and \nfinancing plans will be adjusted when the proposed DFID and SDC cofinancing materializes. \n22  The project monitoring committee will also include the director general of DOLIDAR, project coordinator, heads of MLD \nFinancial Administration Section, Planning and Foreign Aid Coordination Section,  and Monitoring Section,  and \nrepresentatives from MOF and NPC. \n23  The existing joint steering committee for rural infrastructure chaired by the MLD secretary will provide overall policy \ndirection for the sector. \n24  The project implementation coordination committee will be chaired by the director general of DOLIDAR, and include \nthree representatives of MLD (Financial Administration Section, Monitoring Section, and Planning and Foreign Aid \nCoordination Section), and five representatives from project districts on a rotating basis. ADB and other cofinanciers \nmay participate as observers. The PCU will be the secretariat for the PICC; the project coordinator will be the member \nsecretary. \n ", "  19\n84.  Village infrastructure construction coordination committees (VICCCs) will be constituted in \neach VDC area.25 In liaison with the DPOs, the VICCCs will facilitate formation of the RBGs for \nrural roads, and village infrastructure user groups (VIUGs) for supplementary infrastructure. The \nVICCCs will (i) coordinate supplementary infrastructure planning, (ii) ensure proper payment to the \nRBGs,  (iii)  supervise  beneficiary  contributions  to  supplementary  infrastructure,  (iv)  monitor \nimplementation of works, and (v) ensure public audits. \n \nb.  Subproject Selection \n85.  Subprojects  for  rural  roads  have  largely  been  short-listed  through  district  participatory \nprocesses  prior  to  the  start  of  the  Project  (Appendix  11  provides  the  selection  criteria). \nSupplementary infrastructure will be selected through a process approach involving communities \nand villages.  \n \n86.  For final selection of road subprojects, an assessment will be undertaken for short-listed \nsubprojects to cover social, technical, economic, environment, and resettlement aspects; and to \nscore and qualify proposed subprojects. Feasibility studies and detailed design will be undertaken \nby the DIST for the highest-ranked subprojects. Preparations will cover the detailed technical \ndesign;  drawings;  quantity  and  cost  estimates;  and  environment,  resettlement,  and  social \nrequirements  and  plans.  Public  consultations  will  be  undertaken  to  provide  information  and \nincorporate stakeholder views. During the process, disputes in finalizing the subproject will be \nresolved  in  discussion  with  the  local  community  and  VICCC.  Civil  works  for  rural  roads  will \ncommence after completion of feasibility studies and detailed designs, receipt of environment and \nsocial  safeguard  clearances,  and  completion  of  resettlement  activities  and  compensation \npayments. \n \n87.  Supplementary infrastructure preparations will proceed along with the commencement of \nthe rural roads. The DPO, with VICCC support, will inform and guide communities and villages in (i) \nidentification, (ii) consultation and prioritization, and (iii) proposal preparation. Village proposals will \nbe forwarded to the DPOs for evaluation and assessment, and then on to the DDC for approval. \n \nc.  Implementation Period \n88.  The Project will be implemented over 4 years starting from January 2008 to December \n2011. A project implementation schedule is in Appendix 12. \n \nd.  Procurement \n89.  All goods, related services, and civil works financed by  ADB and cofinanciers will be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \nAll small and widely dispersed civil works of up to $30,000 will be undertaken by the community, \nfollowing the community participation guide. Shopping will be used for works exceeding $30,000 \nbut no more than $100,000. In cases involving more complex works such as bridge construction, \nhigh retaining walls, and hard rock cutting valued at more than $100,000 but no  more than \n$1,000,000, civil work contracts will be required and procured by the DPOs on the basis of national \ncompetitive bidding in accordance with the Government\u2019s procurement procedures acceptable to \nADB.26 Supply \n                                                 \n25  A VICCC will include the representatives of political parties, nongovernment organizations active in the VDC area, \nwomen, dalits, and disadvantaged groups; VICCC members will be selected from a beneficiary meeting. Participation \nof at least 33% women and due representation of various ethnic groups and castes will be ensured. \n26  Nepal\u2019s Financial  Administration Rules,  1999,  were reviewed  and agreements reached between  ADB and the \nGovernment on the modifications that need to be made to bring them in line with ADB requirements. \n ", "20    \ncontracts for equipment or materials exceeding $1.0 million will be procured following international \ncompetitive bidding, and those not exceeding $1.0 million but more than $100,000 will be awarded \non the basis of national competitive bidding. Shopping will be used for procuring readily available \noff-the-shelf goods valued at up to $100,000. A procurement plan is in Appendix 13. \n \ne.  Consulting Services \n90.  The selection and engagement of all consulting services will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging national consultants. At the outset of the Project, \nthe PCU will recruit five individual consultants to advance central and district project preparatory \nactivities including (i) 114 person-months of national consulting services in procurement, financial \nmanagement,  resettlement,  and  environmental  management;  and  (ii)  9  person-months \ninternational consulting services on development of a joint donor coordination framework. The \nother central implementation support consultants, comprising 42 person-months international and \n350 person-months national will be recruited by the PCU through a firm using quality- and cost-\nbased selection with quality-cost ratio of 80:20. The Government will undertake advance action for \nrecruiting consultants to facilitate the Project\u2019s start-up. The Government has been advised that \napproval of advance action does not commit ADB to finance the Project. \n \nf.  Anticorruption Policy \n91.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Government. \nConsistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these efforts, relevant provisions \nof ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant regulations and the bidding documents for \nthe  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include \nprovisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of MLD; \nDOLIDAR; DDCs; and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they \nrelate to the Project. \n \n92.  Specific measures are incorporated to enhance governance and prevent corruption. The \nProject will use participatory, open, and consultative processes in decision making and resource \nallocation.  Procurement  and  community  financial  management  manuals  and  step-by-step \nprocedures will be compiled in the local language and delivered to DOLIDAR, DDCs, and VDCs \nwith training. For each subproject, public hearings will be held and public auditing conducted to \nincrease social accountability and transparency, and deter fund misuse. Established procedures, \nstrengthened fiduciary arrangements, and close supervision of resources provided will help lower \nthe risk of fund loss and ensure better accountability.  \n \ng.  Disbursement Arrangements \n93.  To  ensure effective  project  implementation  and  timely  disbursement,  immediately  after \ngrant effectiveness the Government will establish two separate imprest accounts for the (i) ADB \ngrant; and (ii) OFID loan, each at Nepal Rastra Bank. Project funding (other than beneficiary \ncontributions)  comprising  government  counterpart  funds  and  ADB  and  OFID  funds  will  be \nchanneled to the following accounts: (i) the central PCU project operating account, or (ii) the DPO \nproject operating accounts established in each district. \n \n94.  The  PCU  will  work  with  project  districts  to  prepare  budgetary  allocations,  and  the \nGovernment will advance funds to the PCU project operating account and DPO project operating \n ", "  21\naccounts accordingly. The PCU will also work with the project districts to prepare disbursement \nprojections, collect supporting documents, and prepare withdrawal applications; and send them to \nADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). Based on the withdrawal applications, ADB and cofinanciers will fund the project imprest \naccounts on a reimbursement basis. \n \n95.  The statement of expenditure (SOE) procedure will be adopted to facilitate reimbursement \nand liquidation. The imprest accounts and the SOE procedure will be established, maintained, and \naudited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The ceiling of each imprest \naccount will not exceed the estimated corresponding donor-financed expenditures for the next 6 \nmonths, or 10% of the fund amount of the corresponding donor, whichever is lower. The SOE \nprocedure  is  applicable  for  reimbursing  eligible  expenditures  or  any  individual  payment  not \nexceeding $100,000 and liquidating advances provided in the imprest accounts. \n \nh.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n96.  DOLIDAR will submit trimester and annual project progress reports to ADB. The PCU will \nprepare the reports, particularly addressing progress in meeting project targets. The reports will \ninclude information on the Project\u2019s physical progress and component status. Within 3 months of \nthe Project\u2019s substantial physical completion, DOLIDAR will submit to ADB a project completion \nreport  covering  project  implementation,  cost,  project  performance  management  activities,  and \nother  information  requested  by  ADB.  DOLIDAR  will  maintain  separate  project  accounts  and \nrecords to facilitate identification of project-related income and expenditures. The PCU will be \nassigned sufficient and qualified accounting staff, including a senior accountant. An independent \nauditor acceptable to ADB will annually audit all project-related accounts, SOEs, and revenues. \nThe annual audit report will include a separate audit opinion on the use of the imprest accounts \nand SOE procedure. Audited financial statements and project accounts, together with the report of \nthe auditor, will be submitted within 9 months of the close of the financial year. \n \ni.  Project Performance Monitoring System \n97.  In  line  with  ADB\u2019s  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS)  framework,  a \nparticipatory benefit monitoring and evaluation program will be carried out, and be specifically \ndesigned to support the data requirements (segregated by gender and ethnicity) of a results-based \nmanagement system. Specifically, objective indicators and targets for all desired project outputs, \noutcomes, and impacts will be defined for annual and/or episodic points in the project cycle. These \nindicators will permit regular and timely assessments of the Project\u2019s efficiency and effectiveness. \nIn this context, \u201cefficiency\u201d means the production of planned outputs with the allocated inputs \n(resources).  \u201cEffectiveness\u201d  means  the  achievement  of  project  outcomes  and  impacts  as  a \nconsequence of fully implementing all planned interventions. PPMS activities will be conducted \nperiodically to assess whether project inputs have delivered the expected benefits to the intended \nbeneficiaries. The PPMS will also detect deviations between the plan and execution of the Project. \nThe use of a results-based management approach will ensure that deviations between the plan \nand achieved results (outputs, outcomes, and impacts) will be recognized by project management \nin a timely manner, thereby allowing corrective management actions and decisions to be taken. \nThe  PCU  will  conduct  a  benchmark  physical  and  socioeconomic  survey  at  selected  project \ndistricts,  and  submit  for  ADB\u2019s  review  and  concurrence  a  detailed  implementation  plan  for \nmonitoring  performance  and  preparing  benchmark  information  within  9  months  of  grant \neffectiveness.  These  baseline  surveys  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  design  and \nmonitoring framework and provide the basis for preparing the benchmark information and target \nvalues. Baseline data will include income and expenditure data, livelihoods data, demographic \ntrends, gender issues, and data on ethnic and minority groups. After the initial survey, the PCU will \n ", "22    \nsubmit  annual  benefit  monitoring  reports  to  ADB  and  cofinanciers  throughout  project \nimplementation. \n \n98.  In support of the midterm and project completion review missions, independent impact \nevaluation surveys and studies will be accomplished and the reports will be transmitted to ADB and \ncofinanciers  at  a  minimum  of  4  weeks  before  the  respective  missions.  The  surveys  should \ncomplement the benchmark data and measure the degree to which the Project has attained \noutputs, outcomes, and impacts; closely reflecting the indicators of the design and monitoring \nframework. \n \nj.  Project Review \n99.  ADB, cofinanciers, and the Government will review the Project at least twice a year; this \nincludes  the  performance  of  DOLIDAR,  PCU,  DPOs,  consultants,  and  contractors;  physical \nprogress of project implementation; inclusion of the poor, marginalized groups, and women in \nproject implementation; compliance with grant assurances; and continued feasibility of project \nimplementation  in  each  project  district,  taking  into  account  the  political  context  and  security \nsituation. ADB, cofinanciers, and the Government will undertake a comprehensive midterm review \nof the Project at the beginning of the third year to identify problems and constraints encountered \nand  suggest  measures  to  address  them.  Specific  items  to  be  reviewed  include  (i)  PCU \neffectiveness; (ii) compliance with safeguard measures; (iii) implementation of the gender action \nplan;  (iv)  extent  to  which  district  road  maintenance  funds  have  been  established  and  their \neffectiveness; (v) effectiveness of capacity building; (vi) extent to which inclusiveness objectives of \nthe Project are being met; (vii) extent to which project agreements and RBG contracts have been \nimplemented and complied with; (viii) lessons learned, good practices and innovations, and their \nreplicability; and (ix) any other issue agreed upon by the PCU and ADB. Technical, budgetary, and \ndesign modifications could be considered based on the results of the review, including supporting \nthe 18 DRILP districts for rural roads based on the utilization of DRILP and RRRSDP funds. \n \nIV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n100.  Economic. The direct benefits of rural roads are increased access, time savings, and lower \nperson-trip  and  cargo-transport  costs.  In  overcoming  isolation,  the  rural  roads  will  gradually \nstimulate the agricultural economy by (i) improving farm management practices and yields; (ii) \nstimulating cultivation of market-oriented, high-value crops; and (iii) increasing household farm \nincome and employment. The WSS subprojects will provide rural households with better access \nand  less  drudgery  (time  savings  for  fetching  water),  and  better  quality  water  and  sanitation \n(reduction  in  household  health  costs  and  lost  work  days).  Supplementary  infrastructure  will \nincrease access to services and improve income and life quality. Training will enhance rural \nlivelihood skills and community empowerment. The Project will generate employment and income \nthrough the labor-intensive infrastructure works during implementation; and afterward, through \nincreased agricultural activity, development of roadside-related businesses, and O&M of the new \ninfrastructure. The project justification and economic analysis are in Appendix 14. \n \n101.  Poverty Reduction. Poverty issues will be directly addressed by the policy actions through \nthe positive impact that they will have on service delivery to the poor and socially excluded groups, \nand their increased participation. The use of more robust and transparent poverty prioritization \ncriteria will minimize the use of fiscal transfers for political patronage. Growth prospects will be \nimproved because of the introduction of measures to enhance efficiency and transparency. These \nmeasures have the potential to stimulate private sector productivity and investment. Broad-based \n ", "  23\ngrowth will be promoted; the increase is expected to reduce the incidence of poverty and exclusion \nthrough employment promotion.  \n \n102.  A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 15. The incidence of \npoverty is high in rural areas where as much as 95% of Nepal's poor reside. Poverty rates in the \ncountry's five regions range from as high as 47% (Midwestern region) to 29% (Western region), \nwith an overall average of 34.6%.27 These high rates are strongly related to poor crop yields, \nstagnant growth in agricultural income, and isolation. Linking the rural population with markets and \ntechnology, the investment Project will directly benefit an estimated 2.6 million people. In terms of \ndirect employment, reconstruction and rehabilitation will generate more than 15.8 million person-\ndays of labor, or 4 years of full-time work for 13,200 rural poor. Employment opportunities for the \npoor will be enhanced over the long term with improved agriculture, nonfarm labor opportunities, \nand rural enterprise development. The targeted supplementary investments and livelihood training \nprograms  will  ensure  greater  income  opportunities  for  disadvantaged  segments  of  the  rural \npopulation, including women, dalits, and marginalized communities. \n \n103.  Social. By making inclusion a key part of the overall policy reform process, RRRSDP \neffectively links economic and social inclusion awareness in policy and programs to equitable, \nefficient, and sustainable outcomes. The policy reforms will impact the targeting of fiscal resources. \nThey will contribute to political and economic inclusion, and to reform of political institutions and \nbureaucracy for improved service delivery and public accountability. This will have positive impacts \non poverty reduction and good governance. Affirmative action will increase the options of excluded \nethnic groups, castes, and women to participate in state administration, and actively increase their \ncontrol and command over resources. \n \n104.  The  investment  Project  will  promote  economic  and  social  inclusion  by  proportional \nrepresentation  of  historically  marginalized/disadvantaged  populations  in  all  aspects  of  project \nplanning, implementation, monitoring, and maintenance, particularly in employment and income \ngeneration  activities.  The  VICCCs,  RBGs,  and  village  infrastructure  user  groups  will  have \nproportional  representation  of  local  caste  and  ethnic  groups  in  the  project  influence  zone  to  \n(i) ensure participation of the poor and vulnerable groups in decision making, (ii) raise their social \ncapital and access to other development opportunities, and (iii) increase the use of health and \neducation facilities in local areas by such groups. Communities\u2019 access to public services and \nlivelihood opportunities, including self-employment, will be greatly enhanced. \n \n105.  Institutional. RRRSDP will contribute to greater accountability and efficiency through a \nstrengthened and harmonized policy and regulatory framework. A more transparent system of \nfiscal transfers will lead to fewer regional disparities and improve government budgeting and \nfinancial management practices. Decentralized decision making will bring local bodies closer to the \npeople, overcome information asymmetries, improve the quality and quantity of rural infrastructure \nservices  by  allowing  for  a  better  matching  of  local  needs  and  preferences,  and  enhance \ntransparency. \n \n106.  The financial management system to be adopted for RRRSDP will be based on the revised \nLBFAR, which addresses the expenditure authorization of local bodies. This includes increasing \nthe approving authority threshold of local development officers, and providing the DTOs with the \nauthority to approve contracts; this is expected to significantly speed implementation and improve \nservice delivery. RRRSDP will improve and strengthen organizational capabilities for developing \nand managing rural infrastructure; and contribute to building sustainable intergovernment relations, \n                                                 \n27  Central Bureau of Statistics. National Planning Commission Secretariat. 2004. Nepal Living Standards Survey, \n2003/04. Kathmandu. \n ", "24    \nin particular for coordination of policies and programs, and cooperation with local bodies in service \ndelivery. It will build institutional capacity to streamline the existing government mechanism for \noversight,  and  the  management  of  central  and  local  financial  information.  Improved  flows  of \nfinancial information from local bodies will assist in improving institutional capacity for determining \nresource transfers and accountability, leading to increased effectiveness of public institutions vis-\u00e0-\nvis improvements in inclusive service delivery. \n \n107.  Involuntary Resettlement. The Project focuses on rural infrastructure that provides direct \nbenefits to communities, including improved access to markets and services such as schools and \nhealth posts. Improved roads are expected to lead to higher land values and productivity. While \nsuch benefits are cited as reasons for Nepal\u2019s tradition of land donation, the Project will actively \nseek to minimize land donation by incorporating adequate safeguards in the resettlement plan. As \na first principle, people affected by the Project will be informed of their right to compensation. No \none will be forced to donate their land and those affected will have the right to refuse land \ndonation. In cases where the people affected are directly linked to project benefits and thus are \nreally willing to donate part of their land after they are fully informed about their entitlement, the \nProject will assess their socioeconomic status and only those who do not fall below the poverty line \nafter land donation will be eligible for such donation. Any donation will be confirmed through a \nwritten record, including a \"no coercion\" clause verified by a third party. District grievance redress \ncommittees will be set up to redress grievances of people affected by the Project. \n \n108.  Based on a typical cross-section, a 10 meter-wide right-of-way is envisaged for most project \nroads. Involuntary resettlement will be avoided or minimized through careful planning and design of \nthe  project  roads.  People  affected  will  be  offered  compensation  at  replacement  cost  and/or \nassistance so that they will be at least as well-off as without the Project. Affected people will be \nfully informed and consulted during project design and implementation. Lack of land title will not be \na  bar  to  compensation,  and  particular  attention  will  be  paid  to  vulnerable  groups.  Land \ncompensation will be completed before commencement of civil works, while rehabilitation activities \nwill continue during project construction. Supplementary activities are not expected to involve \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  as  their  selection  criteria  exclude  subprojects  that  require  additional \nprivate land. \n \n109.  ADB will finance 80% of land acquisition, involuntary resettlement, and compensation costs. \nThe DPOs will maintain and update a land acquisition, resettlement, and rehabilitation record \nthroughout  project  implementation.  The  record  will  include  details  on  the  payment  of \ncompensation for land, structures, and assistance; and other related payments for each affected \nperson (both titleholder and nontitled) including the date of payment and check number. \n \n110.  A resettlement framework provides policy and procedures to screen, assess, and plan \ninvoluntary  resettlement  aspects  of  subprojects  in  full  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement  Policy  (1995).  The  framework  was  publicly  disclosed  and  posted  on  the  ADB \nwebsite. All subprojects will be screened early in the project cycle. If a subproject involves any \ninvoluntary resettlement impacts, an appropriate resettlement plan will be prepared based on the \ndetailed design, disclosed to those affected, and submitted for ADB approval in accordance with \nthe resettlement framework. \n \n111.  Based on the feasibility study, social impact assessments were conducted for three core \nroad subprojects for which resettlement plans were prepared. The plans will serve as sample \ndocuments  for  the  future  development  of  subprojects.  They  were  publicly  disclosed  to  those \naffected and local stakeholders, and posted on the ADB website. Upon completion of detailed \ndesigns, the plans will be updated and approved by ADB prior to award of civil works contracts. \n \n ", "  25\n112.  DOLIDAR  will  assign  a  resettlement  officer  in  the  PCU,  and  recruit  one  resettlement \nspecialist and three resettlement assistants under the central implementation support consultants \nto help with overall coordination, planning, and monitoring of involuntary resettlement aspects. The \nPCU will provide necessary training and support to the DPOs on social assessment, resettlement \nplanning, implementation, and monitoring. The PCU will supervise and monitor DPOs\u2019 functions in \norder to maintain the quality and consistency of their work/outputs. MLD and DOLIDAR will ensure \ntimely availability of budget for land compensation and resettlement activities. DOLIDAR will submit \nsemiannual progress reports to ADB regarding implementation of the resettlement plans. \n \n113.  For subprojects in the districts, the DPOs will screen, categorize, assess, plan, and monitor \nfor any involuntary resettlement impacts in accordance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy \nand  the  Project\u2019s  resettlement  framework.  A  social  development  specialist,  a  resettlement \nspecialist, and social mobilizers/facilitators will be engaged in each district under the DIST to help \nthe DPOs with social and land surveys, social assessment, resettlement planning, and monitoring. \n \n114.  An external monitoring agency will be engaged to conduct annual monitoring of involuntary \nresettlement implementation. The PCU will hire the monitoring agency with ADB concurrence \nwithin 12 months after grant effectiveness. The appointed agency will provide annual reports to \nADB, MLD, and DOLIDAR. \n \n115.  Environment.  Initial  environmental  examinations  carried  out  for  the  core  subprojects \ndemonstrate that the investment Project is not likely to cause any significant environmental impacts \nsince several safeguards are incorporated in the project design. At the selection stage, subprojects \nto be excluded are those that (i) exceed thresholds warranting environmental impact assessments, \nor (ii) are in designated environmentally sensitive areas. RRRSDP  will provide technical and \nfinancial support to ensure that initial environmental examinations are conducted and mitigation \nmeasures are implemented to meet the Government standards and ADB\u2019s environment policies. \nMost subprojects will be designed and implemented using the LEP approach, which minimizes \nconstruction  impact  on  the  environment.  Project  activities  will  be  independently  monitored  to \nensure  compliance  with  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedures.  In  addition, \npostproject environmental monitoring will be carried out and funded under the Project as part of an \neffective environmental safeguard mechanism. \n \nB.  Risks \n116.  Risks for the Program grant include (i) political instability, including frequent changes in the \nGovernment; and (ii) weak commitment to implementing new legislation and regulation. Although \nthe  political  transition  could  get  stalled,  engaging  and  supporting  the  Government  in  its \nreconstruction, rehabilitation, and social inclusion endeavors will contribute to minimizing the first \nrisk.  Policy  actions  taken  since  November  2006  demonstrate  Government  commitment  to  (i) \nmaking institutions more representative and inclusive, (ii) strengthening the devolution process to \nimprove service delivery, and (iii) strengthening institutions for accountability and transparency.   \n \n117.  Risks for the project grant include (i) inability of the DDCs to raise sufficient funds for O&M, \n(ii) weak capacity in the districts to manage multilateral funded projects, and (iii) distrust and lack of \nsocial  cohesion  among  local  residents,  which  may  slow  implementation.  The  project  design \nprovides for matching funds to support establishment of district maintenance funds with targets at \ndifferent stages of implementation. Weak capacity in the districts will be mitigated through training \nprograms on maintenance designed for local bodies and user groups. The Project also provides for \nstrengthening DOLIDAR\u2019s ability to guide and monitor maintenance performance. Many districts \nare unfamiliar with the policies and procedures of multilateral donor-financed projects and this may \nslow implementation. To counter this, the Project provides for capacity-building training in project \n ", "26    \nprocedures using manuals in local language and covering procurement, financial management, \nenvironment,  and  resettlement.  The  PCU  and  central  implementation  support  consultants  will \nprovide backstopping to districts in all phases of implementation. To mitigate the risk that local \nresidents may not cooperate, the Project provides a strong community mobilization component and \nconflict mitigating measures by employing (i) a consultative and demand-driven approach, (ii) open \nand participatory monitoring mechanism (by using district and village committees and user groups), \nand (iii) institutionalizing public audits. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n118.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n1.  The Program Grant \n119.

The Government\u2019s Local Infrastructure Development Policy 2004 defines rural \ninfrastructure as infrastructure that can be planned, implemented, operated, and maintained by the local \ngovernment bodies jointly with community groups. According to the policy, the rural infrastructure sector \ncovers (i) rural transport (rural roads, bridges, and trails); (ii) rural water supply and sanitation; (iii) irrigation \nand river control; (iv) microhydropower; (v) housing and urban development; (vi) solid waste management; \nand (vii) social infrastructure. \n \n2.  Sector Performance. The findings of the second Nepal Living Standard Survey in 2004 showed that \npoverty is concentrated in rural areas due to inadequate access, illiteracy, and stagnant agriculture. Nepal \nneeds 30,000 kilometers (km) of rural roads to meet the relevant Milennnium Development Goal by 2015. \nThe country has about 22,000 km of rural roads at present. However, road standards vary significantly with \nless than half motorable and of these only about 60% categorized as all-weather. Investment in rural \ntransport needs to be substantially increased in the medium-term. \n \n3.  Recent statistics show that 77% of country\u2019s total population has access to reliable water supply. \nHowever, the proportion of the rural population currently accessing water supply is only about 65%. Access \nto reliable supplies of drinking water is a major concern in towns and rural areas in the hills and mountains. \nMany completed water supply schemes are in disrepair and functioning much below their design capacity. \nThis indicates that the actual population served nationwide, and especially in rural areas, may be much lower \nthan official statistics indicate. \n \n4.  Only about 70% of the cultivated land is irrigated, of which only 40% has year-round irrigation. \nAlmost all the agency-managed irrigation systems are delivering irrigation much below their design capacity \ndue to lack of proper operation and maintenance (O&M). The actual irrigated area, both seasonal and year-\nround, may be much lower than indicated by official statistics. The farmer-managed irrigation systems and \nprivate shallow tubewells function reasonably well due to beneficiary participation in construction and O&M. \nThis suggests the need for strengthening beneficiary participation in identifying and implementing water \nsupply and irrigation systems for sustainable O&M and secured service delivery.  \n \n5.  Sector Investment Plan. To revitalize the rural economy and reintegrate the conflict-affected rural \npopulation, the Government prepared the Rural Infrastructure Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Investment \nPlan as a major component of Three Year Interim Plan. The interim plan places highest priority on rural \ntransport development estimating around 60% of investments to the subsector during its 3-year period. Rural \nwater supply and sanitation is the second priority with investments of around 15% followed by irrigation with \nabout 5%, while the other subsectors are alloted lower investment. The broad strategic elements envisaged \nfor  implementing  the  Rural  Infrastructure  Reconstruction  and  Rehabilitation  Investment  Plan  are  (i) \ncommunity-based undertakings, (ii) programs executed by the district development committees (DDCs), (iii) \nlinking  production  with  markets,  (iv)  local  capacity  building,  and  \n(v) supplementary investment to promote income-generating opportunities. The investment plan will also be \na component of the strategic action plan for local infrastructure development covering FY2008 to FY2015, \nwhich includes the TYIP and the next 5-year plan period. Both of these documents allocate 30% of resources \nfor construction of new rural infrastructure. \n \n6.  Institutional  Framework  for  Rural  Infrastructure  Development.  The  Department  of  Local \nInfrastructure Development and Agricultural Roads (DOLIDAR) is responsible for planning and implementing \nrural infrastructure. Due to the prevailing priority given to rural roads, it has strengthened its comparative \nadvantage in rural roads followed by rural water supply. The establishment of DOLIDAR1 in September 1998 \nunder the Rural Infrastructure Development National Strategy 2054 (1998) allowed for a more flexible \napproach to setting standards of the different structures under consideration. While it is expected to cover \nother infrastructure as well, DOLIDAR and the district technical offices2 mostly centered their attention on \nrural  road  construction,  and  rural  water  supply.  However,  DOLIDAR\u2018s  comparative  advantage  in \nmicroirrigation and microhydropower, and alternative energy schemes have yet to be developed. As the \n                                                 \n1  The Rural Infrastructure Development National Strategy 2054 (1998) led to its establishment in September 1998. \n2  Formerly known as the district infrastructure development offices. \n ", "3  6  Appendix 2 \nsubsector policies are gradually identifying and giving away projects of a certain size to local bodies for their \nplanning, implementation, and O&M, DOLIDAR needs to strengthen its capability to handle these aspects \nthrough the district technical offices.  \n \n7.  As  various  other  government  agencies  are  responsible  for  this  type  of  infrastructure,  a  clear \ndemarcation  of  local  and  nonlocal  dimensions  must  be  obtained  from  the  subsector-specific  policy \ndocuments. For example, the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sectoral Strategic Action Plan (2004) \ndefines any water supply schemes serving less than 1,000 people will be undertaken by local bodies and \nlarger projects will be taken up by the Department of Water Supply and Sanitation. This will be guided by the \ninstitutional capacity of DOLIDAR, which currently has a strong comparative advantage for rural roads and \nmotorable trail bridges. Similar such demarcation for irrigation (in terms of areas to be irrigated), hydropower \n(in terms of generation capacity), and roads (in terms of right of the way) are also defined in their respective \nsubsector policy documents. In areas where DDCs and their line offices do not have technical capacity to \nhandle the projects, they still need to be handled by district offices of the respective line ministries; for this \npurpose a memorandum of understanding has to be reached on a case-by-case basis. \n \n8.  The Local Self Governance Act 1999 and other subsector policy documents call for the preparation \nof periodic and subsector district development plans. They provide the list of projects in different subsectors \nidentified after extensive consultations with all stakeholders, and approved by the DDCs. Although many \nneed to be updated, in the absence of elected local bodies and the transitional arrangement to form them \ncomprising representatives from the major political parties in the district and other civil societies, these \ndistrict plan documents could be the starting point for selecting projects in different subsectors. They could \nbe  identified  following  a  certain  process  and  approved  by  the  DDCs.  Subprojects  to  be  eligible  for \nimplementation must be from one of these district plan documents. But they need to be reranked and \nreprioritized to include poverty and social inclusion as prioritization criteria. \n \n9.  Classification of Rural Roads. Rural roads are classified under two government systems. The \nDepartment of Roads classifies feeder roads as rural roads that link district or zonal headquarters and major \ntourism, industrial, and public utility centers with strategic roads (national highways); and district roads as \nrural roads that link places within a district other than national highways, feeder roads, and urban roads. \nDOLIDAR classifies rural roads as district and village roads. All rural roads that connect one or more market, \ntourism and industrial centers, or link several village development committees (VDCs) with respective or \nadjoining district headquarters directly or through a strategic road network are classified as district roads. \nRural roads that connect a VDC with another VDC, district road, strategic road, or major growth center in \nrespective or neighboring districts are classified as village roads. Another classification of rural roads, mainly \npracticed in GTZ and SDC-supported projects, is green road. This classification includes primary district \nroads and secondary district roads. The rural roads linking several VDCs, market centers, or feeder roads \nare classified as primary district roads, while the rural roads linking two or more VDCs, connecting market \ncenters with the district, or linking with other roads are classified as secondary district roads. All these roads \nintend to improve access of rural populations to market and economic and social services. These roads are \nconstructed  following  different  design  and  implementation  standards.  The  Department  of  Roads  is \nresponsible for maintaining feeder roads, and the DDCs are responsible for maintaining district roads. The \nDDCs with concerned VDCs and user groups are responsible for maintaining village roads. However, most \nrural roads lack maintenance due to shortage of funds and lack of a proper mechanism established during \nconstruction. \n \n10.  District Transport Master Plan. District transport master plans (DTMPs) list the road alignments \nproposed by the VDCs. They make demands for additional road linkages with justifications based on \npopulation served and services they will provide, and also providing their own contribution. DTMPs were \nprepared for 74 districts and preparation of a DTMP is under way for one district. However, the DTMPs are \nnot uniform in quality and coverage and many need to be updated. Nonetheless, as the screening and \nprioritizing process does not have explicit and objective criteria to cover poor and social inclusion aspects, \nthese DTMPs need to be revisited. For this, the manuals providing guidelines for screening and prioritizing \nrural roads for new construction, upgrading, and rehabilitation need to be updated. \n \n11.  Ongoing  Rural  Road  Development  Projects.  DOLIDAR  is  currently  implementing  four  rural \ninfrastructure projects, mainly focusing on improving rural access: \n ", "    Appendix 2  37\n \n(i)  Decentralized Rural Infrastructure and Livelihood Project (DRILP: 2005\u20132011) assisted by \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation \n(SDC) in 18 districts, \n(ii)  Rural  Access  Program  (2001\u20132008)  assisted  by  the  Department  for  International \nDevelopment of the United Kingdom in 7 districts, \n(iii)  Rural Access Improvement and Decentralization Project (2005\u20132010) assisted by the World \nBank in 20 districts, and \n(iv)  District Roads Support Program (phase III: 2006\u20132010) assisted by SDC in four districts. \n \n12.  Aside from these, the Japan International Cooperation Agency is supporting bridge construction at \nseveral sites with SDC assistance in the construction of suspension bridges to improve connectivity to rural \nareas.  The  other  rural  infrastructure  programs  of  DOLIDAR  are  \n(i) rural agriculture road and local development work program, (ii) repair and maintenance of large and local \nsuspension bridges (with support from SDC), (iii) rural drinking water and sanitation program (with support \nfrom the Government of Finland), (iv) local development fund for small-scale infrastructure development (with \nUnited Nations Capital Development Fund), and (v) remote and special area development program. \n \n13.  These rural road projects and programs follow labor intensive, environment friendly, and participatory \napproaches. However, DOLIDAR\u2019s main concern has been inconsistent approaches adopted by donor-\nsupported projects. These include (i) different criteria for subproject selection, (ii) separate implementation \nmodalities, and (iii) varying reporting requirements. DOLIDAR intends to harmonize the operating procedures \nof donor- and Government-supported projects. As these projects have different time frames and are at \ndifferent stages of implementation, broad agreement must be reached among all concerned on a single \noperating modality, even for ongoing projects, and a joint agreement for restructuring the ongoing projects \nmay have to be initiated.  \n \n14.  Rural Water Supply and Sanitation. The rural water supply and sanitation sectoral policies and \nSectoral Action Plan (2004) provide major policy guidelines on water supply with a focus on community-\nowned and -managed systems and classify projects for the DDCs and Department of Water Supply and \nSanitation to undertake based on number of population served by water supply schemes. Two major projects \non water supply and sanitation are ongoing: Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project Phase II supported \nby the World Bank, and Community-Based Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project supported by ADB. \nBoth will provide water supply to 2,400 communities in different parts of the country, and both work through \nwater user groups. These projects are ending in 2009 and 2010, respectively. The Government of Finland is \nsupporting a separate program on water resource management. \n \n15.  Irrigation. The Irrigation Policy (2003) and Irrigation Regulations (2004) are the policy documents \nguiding irrigation development in the country. Irrigation projects commanding more than 200 hectares (ha) in \nthe terai and 25 hectares in the hills and mountains are under the jurisdiction of the Department of Irrigation, \nwhile the DDCs are mandated to implement irrigation projects servicing below these thresholds. However, \nirrespective of the size of the command area, irrigation projects have to be planned and implemented jointly \nwith water user groups and associations. Two irrigation projects are ongoing: Community Groundwater \nIrrigation Sector Project and Community-Managed Irrigated Agriculture Sector Project, both supported by \nADB, are to be closed in 2007 and 2012, respectively. The Government is preparing microirrigation policy \nand implementation guidelines to promote microirrigation, i.e., treadle pumps and drip and sprinkler systems \ntargeted at marginal farmers. \n \n16.  Experience in Land Acquisition. As per the need for development projects, the Government \nacquires private land, and landowners are compensated according to the law of the land. Landowners are \nalso allowed to donate their land. However, whether landowners donate land voluntarily or through social \npressure is not always clear, as the process adopted during donations is often not properly recorded and \nverified by a third party. Whether landowners are given options for compensation or voluntary donation of \ntheir lands is also not clear. Such practice increases the risk of the landowners being worse off from a \ndevelopment project. Hence, a national policy is needed with clear guidelines to screen, assess, and plan \nland acquisition for development projects. Although provisions could be made for voluntary land donation by \nthe nonpoor, greater care is needed in handling land acquisition from poor households and vulnerable \n ", "3  8  Appendix 2 \ngroups. This requires proper planning and monitoring. Land acquisition requiring involuntary resettlement \nshould be avoided where feasible by exploring viable options; resettlement may disrupt residents\u2019 economic \nand social future. If displacement becomes unavoidable, they should be adequately compensated for the \nloss of and or means of livelihood or social support system. \n \n17.  Lessons. The design of the Rural Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Sector Development Program \nconsiders lessons from completed and ongoing projects/programs in the rural infrastructure in Nepal and \nother countries (Table A2). \n \nTable A2: Key Lessons from Various Infrastructure Development Projects \n \nIssue  Lesson  Remarks \nCompliance with the policy  Need for explicit criteria on  Poverty mapping and mapping of \nobjective of poverty reduction  poverty reduction and social  ethnic distribution for the district can \nand social inclusion  inclusion in identifying and  be introduced; base maps can be \nprioritizing projects  prepared by DOLIDAR. \nOveremphasis on  Supplementary investments in  Supplementary programs have to be \nimprovement and  community-based programs  identified during selection and \nconstruction of roads    enhance social and economic  planning of rural roads.   \nimpacts of road investment \nInadequate construction  Unskilled workers finalizing  Need for full-time technical \nsupervision leading to poor  engineering design during  supervision and training on basic \nwork quality  construction   skills for laborers at the very \nbeginning of project implementation \nInadequate provision for  Failure to preserve the  System for repair and maintenance, \nrepair and maintenance   physical assets and hence  formation of maintenance fund with \nreduce the use value  some seed money at the beginning of \nproject implementation.

Approximately  eight  donors  are  currently  funding  at  least  14  programs  covering  rural \ninfrastructure and poverty reduction across Nepal, not including the many local projects supported \nby international agencies, nongovernment organizations, and community-based organizations. Not \nall major programs are present in each of the 75 districts, ranging from 2\u20138 in any given one. The \nfoci of the major programs include \n(i)  strengthening connectivity within rural areas;  \n(ii)  developing livelihoods and access; \n(iii)  promoting  labor-based  and  environmentally  sound  road  construction  and \nmaintenance methods;  \n(iv)  strengthening capacity of decentralized local government for planning, quality, and \nsustainability of rural roads;  \n(v)  enabling families to gain and preserve assets that directly contribute to sustainable \nimprovements in food security; \n(vi)  providing easy access to markets, and to economic and basic service centers; \n(vii)  strengthening local capabilities for implementing rural water supply and sanitation \nschemes; \n(viii)  providing holistic support for sustainable, market-oriented agriculture and livestock \ndevelopment; and \n(ix)  improving  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation  schemes  through  a  demand-driven \napproach and empowering communities to take responsibility for operation and \nmaintenance. \n \n2.  Given the number of programs and because many programs include more than just rural \ninfrastructure  components,  the  Government  is  faced  with  a  major  challenge  to  manage  and \ncoordinate the initiatives centrally among different ministries and in the districts. Additionally, donor \nrequirements related to procurement, safeguards, reporting, etc., significantly strain the limited \ncapacity and resources of the Government. These factors provide justification for developing an \nintegrated framework to harmonize donor funding and to move the sector or subsector to joint \nfunding arrangements. While the need is clear and urgent, development of such an arrangement \nrequires several steps that could take up to 3\u20134 years. In the meantime, the Government proposes \ndevelopment of an interim joint donor framework to help coordinate rural infrastructure programs. \n \n3.  The Ministry of Local Development (MLD) is charged, under its charter, with developing \nlocal governance, rural infrastructure, and economic and social inclusion. It is seeking to lead a \ncoordinated  approach  to  alignment,  harmonization,  managing  for  results,  and  mutual \naccountability, across the various ongoing programs as well as prepare for new initiatives, through \nthe framework of the Rural Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Sector Development Program. MLD \nhas already taken the first step by changing the current Joint Local Transport Steering Committee \ninto a joint steering committee for rural infrastructure (JSCRI). This new body will have a broader \nmandate, and comprise joint secretaries from seven key ministries and agencies including the \nNational Planning Commission, and be chaired by MLD. Where areas overlap with programs in \nrelated sectors or jurisdictional conflicts arise with other infrastructure-related lead ministries, the \npresence of the National Planning Commission will enhance rational and early resolution of such \nconflicts.  \n \n4.  MLD has still to resolve how to encourage other key steering committees to come together \nand work together at the center. Even though the boundaries of what exactly constitutes rural \ninfrastructure remain somewhat unclear, donors supporting and working through district and village \ndevelopment committees are expected to join in the new JSCRI, either through direct participation \n ", "5  0  Appendix 7 \nor through representation on behalf of a group of donors under other key steering committees. At \nthe same time, MLD recognizes that it will need to coordinate in the regions and districts as well. \n5.  Key steps in the interim period, not necessarily in strict order or in series, are \n(i)  securing donors\u2019 agreement on adopting the donor coordination framework and \ngovernance mechanism at a newly relaunched JSCRI; \n(ii)  identifying any technical assistance required to assist MLD in moving to a joint \nfunding  arrangement  and  looking  at  low-cost  options  including  assistance  from \nexisting donor-funded rural infrastructure programs; \n(iii)  joint  assessment  of  and  agreement  on  the  gaps  in  current  policy  in  rural \ninfrastructure, including the steps needed to rectify these gaps; \n(iv)  formal  launching  of  the  SDP,  and  mobilization  of  central  and  district  technical \nassistance; \n(v)  agreeing on central reforms needed for better governance of rural infrastructure \ninitiatives for poverty reduction, and establishing a time frame with milestones and \nresources for implementation; and \n(vi)  agreeing on a road map to develop a sector or subsector joint funding arrangement, \nincluding tentative targets, outputs, and working groups as necessary. \n \n6.  With respect to a joint funding arrangement, experience to date confirms that countries \nengaged in sectorwide and program-based approaches have taken different paths.1 The choice \nhas been related to contextual factors specific to the country and sector. Nevertheless, common \nsteps provide MLD with a basis for discussing the Government\u2019s desire and readiness for a rural \ninfrastructure sectorwide or program-based approach, and to determine the donor community\u2019s \nwillingness to join. The major steps include \n(i)  a clear and nationally owned sector policy and overall strategy;  \n(ii)  a statement of intent between government and donors; \n(iii)  Medium-Term Expenditure Framework programming and/or accounting for sector \nresources, and fund-flow mechanisms for both central and local levels; \n(iv)  joint appraisal and monitoring; \n(v)  sector performance monitoring and accountability system; \n(vi)  mechanisms for sector dialogue and coordination; \n(vii)  inclusive consultation mechanisms involving all stakeholders; and \n(viii)  capacity-building plan. \n \n7.  To take advantage of current donor momentum behind this initiative, the SDP includes \nassistance under the capacity building component to help the Government develop the framework \nand interim measures to coordinate donor projects. \n                                                 \n1   The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and Learning Network on Program Based Approaches \ndefine the program-based approach as a way of engaging in development cooperation based on the principle of \ncoordinated support for a locally owned program of development, such as a national poverty reduction strategy, sector \nprogram, thematic program, or program of a specific organization. PBAs share the following features: (i) leadership by \nthe host country or organization; (ii) a single comprehensive program and budget framework; (iii) a formalized process \nfor aid coordination and harmonization of donor procedures for reporting, budgeting, financial management and \nprocurement; and (iv) efforts to increase the use of local systems for program design and implementation, financial \nmanagement, monitoring, and evaluation. A sectorwide approach is a PBA operating for an entire sector. \n ", "    Appendix 8  51\nCENTRAL IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT CONSULTANTS \n \n1.  The objective of the central consulting services is to support the project coordination unit to \n(i) deliver the planned outputs and outcomes on schedule; (ii) backstop the district implementing \nagencies;  (iii)  ensure  compliance  with  safeguard  policies  including  social,  environmental,  and \nresettlement  safeguards;  (iv)  meet  reporting  requirements  of  the  Government  and  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB); and (v) develop institutional capacities of central and local institutions \ninvolved  in  rural  infrastructure.  Consultant  inputs  cover  expertise  related  to  engineering, \nconstruction  supervision,  social  development,  environmental  management,  resettlement  and \ncompensation policy, monitoring and evaluation, quality control and quality assurance, fiduciary \nand  financial  management,  training  and  capacity  building,  procurement,  sector  stakeholder \nintegration, and project management (work program and budgeting, administration, monitoring, \nand reporting). \n \n2.  A  core  team  of  consultants  will  comprise  a  rural  infrastructure  expert  (team  leader-\ninternational), construction engineer (deputy team  leader), social development specialist, rural \nwater supply and sanitation specialist, bridge specialist, environmental management specialist, \nresettlement specialist, procurement specialist, financial management specialist, and policy/aide \neffectiveness specialist. In addition, two full-time rural infrastructure engineers and two regional \nsocial coordinators will each be in charge of one of two regional groupings of project districts, as \nmembers of the central consulting team. Specialized services in areas like technical audit, quality \nassurance, impact evaluation, bioengineering, training, and capacity building will be procured for \nshorter durations on an as and when needed basis. This arrangement will optimize consultant \ninputs and provide flexibility during project implementation. The Project will be implemented in \ncollaboration with other projects and benefit from other initiatives and expertise. \n \n3.  The project coordination unit will recruit the central consulting services in two subsets. First, \nfive consultants will be recruited individually (the Government may seek permission and agree on \nprocedures with ADB to initiate advance action for their recruitment) so that they can be fielded \nupon project effectiveness. The expertise recruited will be in procurement, financial management, \nenvironment, resettlement, and policy/aid effectiveness. The bulk of this consultant expertise (the \nfirst four experts) is critical to strengthen the capacity of the Department of Local Infrastructure \nDevelopment  and  Agricultural  Roads  and  district  development  committees,  and  establish \nprocedures so that gaps can be filled to ensure an orderly and effective start-up. These consultants \nwill be tasked to compile local-language manuals and step-by-step procedures, and deliver the \nmanuals and training in regional workshops for district project office staff soon after project start-\nup. The fifth expert in policy/aide effectiveness will be charged with developing the framework for \ndonor and government integration towards a common approach and financing scheme for rural \ninfrastructure development. This is an area where interest is currently strong and where support is \nseen as imperative to maintain the momentum of building such an initiative. \n \n4.  The second subset of central implementation support consultants will contain the balance of \nneeded expertise and will be recruited using a consultant package from a firm using the quality- \nand  cost-based  selection  procedure  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The Government may also seek permission \nand agree on procedures with ADB to initiate advance action for the recruitment of this package of \nconsultants. Again, mobilize consultants upfront is important to help establish an early project \nimplementation  framework  and  management  structures,  and  institutionalize  procedures  and \nguidelines. \n \n5.  Overall, for the individual and firm-packaged consultants, a total of 51 person-months of \nservices  from  international  and  about  464  person-months  from  national  consultants  will  be \n ", "5  2  Appendix 8 \nrequired.

The  district  implementation  support  teams  (DISTs)  require  social,  technical,  and \nprofessional  inputs  for  (i)  surveys,  investigations,  and  design;  (ii)  resettlement  planning  and \nimplementation; (iii) environmental assessment and mitigation; (iv) works supervision and quality \ncontrol;  (v)  beneficiary  mobilization,  empowerment,  and  skills  training;  \n(vi) procurement and management of services; and (vii) accounting, monitoring, and reporting. The \ncomposition  of  the  services  will  vary  by  district  and  typically  include  (i)  a  rural  infrastructure \nengineer  supported  by  two  junior  engineers/overseers  and  five  suboverseers,  (ii)  a  social \ndevelopment officer supported by three social mobilizers/community facilitators, (iii) a resettlement \nspecialist and an environmental specialist, and (iv) an accountant and two support staff. Provision \nis made for unallocated input to meet special needs (such as geotechnical, hydrology, etc.). The \nservices will generally be full time for the project period except for the resettlement environmental \nspecialists who will be employed in the early phases of implementation, and subsequently only as \nneeded, and the unallocated specialists who will be deployed only as needed. \n \n2.  The  DISTs  will  set  out  works  at  sites  with  the  participation  of  building  groups  and/or \ncontractors to ensure that they understand the work to be undertaken. They provide coaching and \non-job-training to workers to maintain quality and standards, as well as to enhance building group \nskills. They also monitor working conditions, social aspects, and compliance with environmental \nand resettlement recommendations. \n \n3.  Of the 38 project districts, 18 are districts of the Decentralized Rural Infrastructure and \nLivelihood Project (DRILP) and have district support teams in place. Therefore, the DISTs will be \nrecruited  by  district  project  offices  in  the  20  new  districts,  for  the  Rural  Reconstruction  and \nRehabilitation Sector Development Program, through a single firm or integrated association of \nfirms/nongovernment organizations. Provision is made for one water resource engineer, overseer, \nand suboverseer for each of the 18 DRILP districts to cover rural water supply and sanitation. The \nwater resource engineers and assistants are to be recruited individually by the DRILP district \nproject offices. \n \nTable A9: Indicative District Implementation Support, per District \nStaff  Person-Months  \nA.

Rural road selection criteria include the following: \n \n(i)  The rural road is listed as a priority road in the district transport master plan.  \n(ii)  The road will not have a significant negative environmental or resettlement impact, \nas  defined  in  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedures  and  the \nresettlement  framework  agreed  to  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  and  the \nGovernment. Maximum effort will be made in design to ensure alignments that \nminimize impact on structures and settlements. \n(iii)  Road construction can be completed within 3 years using labor-based, environment-\nfriendly, and participatory approaches. \n(iv)  The road has at least a 12% economic internal rate of return. \n(v)  The road does not exceed 40 kilometers (km); the cumulative length of all proposed \nroads in that district will not be more than 60 km.  \n(vi)  The proposed road length covers the total length of the road alignment, not just \npartial sections. \n(vii)  The number of bridges will not exceed three or the total bridge cost will not exceed \n25% of the total estimated cost of the proposed road alignment. \n \nB.  Supplementary Infrastructure other than Water Supply and Sanitation \n \n3.  The supplementary investment  \n \n(i)  will generate additional access benefits for the rural road subproject it is near to;  \n(ii)  was identified and planned through a community participatory process that involves \nthe poorest and most socially excluded groups, and targets the poor, identified \nthrough earlier social mobilization activities; \n(iii)  does not duplicate activities of other development projects; \n(iv)  will contribute to income-generating opportunities; \n(v)  will be formulated with a sustainable operation and maintenance plan (financial, \nphysical, and organizational); and \n(vi)  the community can contribute 15% (cash or in-kind). \n ", "Appendix 11        57 \n4.  Supplementary investment type by eligibility and budgetary ceilings includes \n \n(i)  improvement  of  a  village  trail  to  improve  access  to  the  rural  road  subproject; \nmaximum length 10 km, indicative costs NRs100,000 per km (maximum total cost \nNRs1 million); \n(ii)  construction of a short span trail bridge on village trail to improve access to the main \nsubproject; maximum span 120 meters, indicative costs: NRs20,000 per meter span \n(maximum total cost NRs2.4 million); \n(iii)  reconstruction and rehabilitation of an existing small irrigation scheme;1 maximum \nsize 25 hectares (ha), indicative costs NRs100,000 per ha (maximum total cost \nNRs2.5 million); \n(iv)  construction of a market building (agro collection centers, dairy, etc.); maximum size \n100 square meters (m2), indicative costs NRs9,000 per m2 (maximum total cost \nNRs900,000); \n(v)  construction  of  a  community  building;  maximum  size  100  m2,  indicative  costs \nNRs10,000 per m2 (maximum total cost NRs1 million); \n(vi)  construction of a new or rehabilitation/upgrading of an existing primary school; new \nconstruction: up to 3 classrooms, 32 m2 per classroom, indicative costs NRs10,000 \nper m2 (maximum total cost NRs960,000); and \n(vii)  construction  of  a  new  or  rehabilitation/upgrading  of  an  existing  health  subpost; \nmaximum size 100 m2, indicative costs NRs10,000 per m2 (maximum total cost \nNRs1 million). \n \nC.  Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Subproject Selection Criteria2 \n \n5.  Participating DDCs will prioritize the demands from the village development committees \n(VDCs). The subprojects will be funded by the Project if they rank high according to the criteria. \nWillingness to share the costs of the water supply and sanitation subproject will be based on the \nGovernment\u2019s  Rural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Policy  and  Strategy.  For  poor \ncommunities3 in remote inaccessible areas, the minimum contribution will be reduced to 10% and \n1% upfront cash is not mandatory. If the project districts overlap with community-based water \nsupply and sanitation districts,4 the Project should select the subproject based on the existing \npriority list of the DDC.  \n \n6.  Required eligibility criteria include \n \n(i)  water supply and sanitation scheme is included in the district plan; \n(ii)  demand for a water scheme originated from the community; \n                                                 \n1  Construction of new (as opposed to rehabilitation of existing) irrigation schemes has been excluded because of the \ncomplexity of the process of surveying and designing a new scheme and organizing participatory management. \n2  This is consistent with the criteria that 19 hill and mountain districts of the far Midwestern district, and 2 western (1 terai \nand 1 hill) districts following under the Community Based Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project. Ministry of \nPhysical Planning and Works (lead agency for water supply and sanitation) adopted the criteria for the Community \nBased Water Supply and Sanitation.     \n3  According to the Nepal Poverty Assessment 1999 indicators poor households are (i) households having food \nsufficiency for less than 6 months in a year; (ii) households whose major source of income is wage from labor;  \n(iii)  households  headed  by  women  with  disabled  persons;  and  (iv)  other  households  with  low  literacy  and \nunsatisfactory health indicators.  \n4  Accham, Baitadi, Bajhang, Bajura, Dadeldhura, Dailekha, Dang, Darchula, Dolpa, Doti, Gulmi, Humla, Jajarkot, Jumla, \nKalikot, Kapilvastu, Mugu, Pyuthan, Rolpa, Rukum,, and Salyan.  \n ", "58  Appendix 11 \n \n(iii)  the community is willing to contribute as per the Government\u2019s Rural Water Supply \nand Sanitation Sector Policy and Strategies; community contribution is 20% (cash or \nin-kind) and 1% cash up-front;5 \n(iv)  the community accepts responsibility for operation and maintenance of the scheme \nafter its completion; \n(v)  the DDCs and VDCs commit to maintain the scheme in case of natural calamities \nand required major rehabilitation; and \n(vi)  maximum  1,000  people  per  scheme  (and  subject  to  available  and  equitably \ndistributed supplementary investment budget across all districts); indicative costs \nper person, new construction up to NRs5,000 per person and rehabilitation up to \nNRs3,000  (maximum  NRs5  million);  water  supply  may  be  complemented  by \ninvestments in sanitary/health infrastructure such as private and public toilets, and \nimproved cooking stoves, as long as the total budgetary outlays remain within the \nindicated limits. \n \n7.  Process of Prioritization. Selected subproject must pass the screening criteria. After the \nscreening process, the schemes demand is ranked as per the criteria for screening. Poverty, water \nsupply coverage, and incidence of diarrhea and other waterborne diseases are major criteria for \nscreening. \n \n8.  Village planning includes that the communities \n(i)  submit the demand form to the DDCs through the VDCs, and \n(ii)  are willing to share the costs of the water supply and sanitation subproject as per \nthe Government\u2019s Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Policy. \n \n9.  District planning involves the following: \n(i)  community demand must be included in the DDC plan, \n(ii)  the DDCs must prioritize all demands based on the social and poverty factors and \nhardship factors, and \n(iii)  criteria for subproject ranking will be defined and adopted for prioritizing the demand \nby community (though the VDCs) for implementation based on the priority. \n \n \n

Investment Analysis  \n \n1.  Benefits \n \n10.  Rural Roads with Limited or No Motorized Traffic. For rural roads with limited or no \nmotorized traffic, the first benefit defined is for person-trip savings due to construction of the road \nand more efficient modes of transport. Pedestrian trips are time consuming and relatively costly \ncompared with motorized transport1 that will become available with provision of the road. Due to \nthe savings and relative ease of motorized travel, more passenger trips will be generated. The \nvalue of the generated trips is taken at half the rate for existing trips. \n \n11.  Preproject  cargo  movement  is  estimated  to  comprise  (i)  the  surplus  of  agriculture \nproduction  beyond  food,  feed,  seed,  and  wastage;  and  (ii)  imports  of  25  kilograms \n(kg)/capita/annum  for  nonagricultural  goods  and  200  kg/hectare  (ha)  for  agricultural  goods \n(fertilizer, compost, manure, agrochemicals, tools, seed, etc.). Existing goods transport is provided \nby porters, which costs NRs354 per ton-km. This rate is high by comparison to light trucks that will \nply the road at NRs10.6 per ton-km.2 For simplicity, the with-project vehicle operating cost (VOC) \nper ton-km is based on 75% truck and 25% porter carriage. The large savings for cargo transport \ndominate  the  benefits  of  new  roads.  The  lowered  cargo  transport  prices  will  also  generate \nincreased  exports  and  imports.3  Per  capita  imports  of  nonagricultural  goods  are  assumed  to \n                                                 \n1  The vehicle operating cost per kilometer for a light bus ranges from NRs28 to NRs34 for fair-to-good condition, hilly-to-\nmountainous roads of earthen to gravel standard. The corresponding international roughness indexes are 10 to 13 for \ngravel surface and 13 to 16 for earthen surface. Bus carriage rate is 25 passengers. \n2  The vehicle operating cost per km for a light truck ranges from NRs23 to NRs30 for fair-to-good condition, hilly-to-\nmountainous roads of earthen to gravel standard. The corresponding international roughness indexes are 10 to 13 for \ngravel surface and 13 to 16 for earthen surface. Light truck load capacity is 4 tons. \n3  However, since increased agricultural production due to opening the road is valued separately as a benefit, to avoid \ndouble counting of benefits, only generated nonagricultural goods transport is accounted for here. \n ", "Appendix 14  63\n \nincrease from 25 to 50 kg/capita, including such items as building materials, food stuffs, and other \nhousehold items. Per convention, the generated cargo is valued at one half the savings for existing \ngoods.  \n \n12.  With the introduction of the road and motorized transport, farmers gain better access to \nfarm inputs, technology, and markets. This will result in (i) increased use of inputs, (ii) improved \nfarm practices, and (iii) a move to more market-oriented production. With the Project, a modest \nchange  in  mix  of  crops  is  assumed.  Higher-value  vegetables  are  assumed  to  take  on  an \nincremental 3% of the annual cropping regime. For the remaining cropping base (dominated by \ncereals), increases in inputs and yields are expected, with production expected to rise by 5%. \nThese gains are assumed to be phased in equally over a 5-year period from road completion. \n \n13.  Rural Road with Traffic and Traffic Count. Benefits for the sample road upgrade in the \nplains are based on VOC savings and the value of generated trips. The basis for comparison of the \nwithout- and with-project scenarios is (i) the traffic count for the existing road/path, and (ii) the \ntraffic count of an already upgraded road of similar setting and proximity. The traffic count for the \nexisting  road/path  amounts  to  about  40  motor  or  animal-powered  vehicles  per  day.  The \ncorresponding traffic count for the matched upgraded road is 391, for mostly motorized vehicles. \nFor the existing situation, the setting is for poor earthen roads at international roughness index \n(IRI) of 20; and for the with-project condition, the condition is assessed as good gravel road (at IRI \n10). \n \n14.  After completion of the subproject, a shift will occur to more efficient and cheaper means of \ntransport (from nonmotorized to motorized transport). The existing alignment is subject to weather \ndisruptions and fragmented due to lack of key crossings. The proposed subproject will upgrade to \nan all-weather surface and supply two critical bridges to allow traffic to flow unimpeded. The \nsavings over existing travel is due to lower VOCs. Due to the savings, relative ease of motorized \ntravel, and greater access, additional trips will be generated. The value of the incremental trips is \ntaken at one half. \n \n15.  Rural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation.  For  the  representative  subproject,  currently  17 \nsettlements secure their water supply from aged and simple systems, or natural springs. An \naverage family spends over 3 hours per day securing household water needs. This comprises five \ntrips per day per household, with 15 liters carried per trip. Villagers are also beset with a variety of \nwaterborne illnesses and complications, including diarrhea, worms, and skin infections. These \nafflictions, besides the discomfort and threat to health, manifest in two quantifiable outcomes: \nmedical expenditure and lost workdays. The reported water usage ranges from 60 to 150 liters per \nhousehold per day among the settlements, with an overall average of 75.3 liters per household per \nday. This equates to 15 liters per capita per day.  \n \n16.  With the subproject, villagers will have better access and availability to water access. \nHouseholds are expected to reduce water-fetching times by half. Medical expenses for treating \nwaterborne illnesses are expected to drop, as will adult working days lost to illnesses. Better \naccess,  higher  quality,  and  more  secure  supplies  will  result  in  increased  consumption;  the \nincrement of which is valued as generated usage. Table A14.2 provides the range and type of \nquantified benefits for the subprojects. \n \n17.  Nonquantified Benefits. Roads will bring substantial social value in the way of better \naccess to services and increased mobility. Upgraded transport facilitates (i) contact with health and \neducation service providers, (ii) social connectivity, and (iii) employment opportunities. Rural roads \nalso tend to attract settlement and small-business development, with land values adjacent to roads \nincreasing accordingly. Also with improved access, more buyers will ply the roads and increase the \n ", "6  4  Appendix 14 \nmarket for livestock production and sales. Along with the primary road inves1t2m  ent, a demand-\ndriven community training and infrastructure program will be implemented. This complementary \ninvestment will target the poor and enhance livelihoods. The water supply approach includes \nmeasures to (i) bolster community sanitation, (ii) increase awareness of health and hygiene, and \n(iii) provide a vulnerable group plan. \n \nTable A14.2: Subproject Benefits \n(NRs \u2019000) \nSavings over  Generated Usage  Producer \n  Core Subproject   Existing Usage  Value  Surplus  Total \n1.

Costs for the subprojects are grouped into three main categories: (i) project preparation; (ii) \nconstruction; and (iii) safeguards for the roads, or community program in the case of drinking water \nsupply. For roads, the safeguard program includes resettlement administration and compensation, \nand environmental and social mitigation and monitoring. The water supply community program \nincludes  environmental  sanitation,  health  and  hygiene,  and  a  vulnerable  group  plan.  Total \nsubproject costs include physical and price contingencies. Both for roads and the rural drinking \nwater supply subprojects, provision has been made for operation and maintenance (O&M). For \ncomparison  on  a  unit  basis,  Table  A14.3  presents  the  physical  costs  (including  preparation, \nconstruction,  safeguard/community  measures,  and  physical  contingency,  excluding  price \ncontingencies). \n \nTable A14.3: Subproject Costs \nTotal Costs   Per Km  Per Hh  Per Person \n  Core Subproject  (NRs million)  (NRs \u2018000)  (NRs)  (NRs) \nBhojpur-Manebhanjyang \n1.

Investment Return and Assessment \n \n19.  The subproject economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) range from 13% to 27%. For both \nroads and drinking water supply subprojects, sensitivity analysis was completed for cost overruns \n(+20%),  benefit  underachievement  (\u201320%),  and  a  combination  of  both  (Table  A14.4).  With \nincreased cost and decreased benefit, the EIRRs generally remain viable, and in all cases positive. \n ", "Appendix 14  65\n \nThe Kopasi\u2013Taldhunga road drops into the 10%\u201311% EIRR range with either the cost increases or \nbenefit decreases. When subjected to both 20% cost increase and 20% benefit decrease at the \nsame time, the Beni\u2013Pakhapani road joins Kopasi\u2013Taldhunga road at sub 12% EIRRs, at 10% and \n8%, respectively.

Household Income, Employment, and Production Gains \n \n21.  For the rural roads, most of the beneficiary households are agriculture-based. Increases in \nhousehold  income  are  expected  due  to  improved  farmer  access  to  inputs,  technology,  and \nmarkets.  For  the  hill  locations,  the  road  development  is  expected  to  induce  an  increase  of  \n8%\u201313% in household farm income, and for the plains subproject, increases of 12%\u201317%. The \nlarge plains increment relative to the hills is due partly to the larger average farm size and to the \ngrowing conditions and yields in the lowland areas. For the water supply scheme, the value of \nsavings for a household derives from reduced time for water fetching, reduced medical expenditure \non waterborne disease, and reduction in lost workdays to illness. For water supply, average \nhousehold  gains  are  estimated  as  (i)  NRs3,400  for  time  savings,  (ii)  NRs250  for  medical \n                                                 \n4  Along with this shortened life, benefits are assumed to decline proportionately, year-by-year. \n ", "6  6  Appendix 14 \nexpenditure saved, and (iii) NRs950 for reduction in lost workdays. For household income, wages \nduring  subproject  construction  will  provide  about  NRs3.2  thousand  to  NRs12.6  thousand  per \nhousehold if employment is spread evenly (i) across the 2-hour distant populations of the road \nsubprojects, and (ii) over the direct beneficiary population in the case of water supply. A labor-\nbased approach is taken for construction. For the subprojects, the gain in construction employment \n(for  households  within  2-hours  distance)  ranges  from  19  to  76  days  per  year  during \nimplementation. Increases in agricultural employment are expected with the completion of the road \nsubprojects. Additional labor days per household are expected in the range of 12\u201352 per year for \n2-hour distant populations of the different subprojects. Approximately two jobs per km will be \ncreated for O&M of the roads. With the opening of the road, some permanent roadside business \nand employment will be generated, estimated at 5\u201310 jobs generated per km. Lastly, agriculture \nproduction will increase in the influence zones of the road subprojects. Food and income security \nwill be boosted, as production per family is expected to increase by 0.7\u20131.0 tons within 2 hours \ndistance of the completed roads. \n \nE.   Distribution of Subproject Benefits \n \n22.  Table  A14.6  provides  a  sample  summary  of  the  subproject  distribution  analyses.  The \nassumption for the analysis is that the poor make up 90% of unskilled laborers and 60% of the \ngeneral population of farmers, villagers, passengers, and water-users. The poor are also assumed \nto represent 0.0% of the vehicle owners, and have a 10% stake in the Government/economy. The \nshare of benefits to the poor per net economic benefit is greater than the share of the poor in the \npopulation at large. This indicates that the poor benefit significantly from the Project and suggests \nthat poverty reduction is targeted. \n \nTable A14.6: Summary of Distribution Analysis \n(NPV in NRs '000 at 12% discount rate) \n             Farmers /     \n      Unskilled  Vehicle  Passengers  Government   \n      Item  Labor  Owners  /Villagers  /Economy  Total \n1.

Maintenance and Financial Capacity \n \n23.  Table  A14.7  shows  (i)  typical  rural  infrastructure  types  and  investment,  (ii)  O&M \nrequirement (financial), (iii) sources of funding, and (iv) impact for the payer. For roads, the sources \nof funding are from the government, including local and national sources. An average district's \nannual revenue is about NRs200 million.5 For rural water supply and sanitation, the approach is for \nusers to finance O&M through user fees. These are typically in the range of NRs20\u2013NRs30 per \nhousehold per month. While affordable to most, some poorer households are unable to meet the \n                                                 \n5 Road Fund Nepal is another source of dedicated funds for road maintenance on a matching basis with district \ncontributions. Internally generated revenue in an average district is about NRs10 million\u2013NRs30 million. \n ", "Appendix 14  67\n \nexpense. However, usually scope is available to contribute in-kind through labor to cover fees. The \nsample  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation  scheme  is  from  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance feasibility study. In terms of willingness to pay, the beneficiaries expressed in meetings \nand surveys (to the nongovernment organization executing the feasibility study) that they were \nwilling to pay NRs30 per household per month, an amount in excess of the financially calculated \nNRs25 per household per month requirement. However, the community confirmed commitment to \nthe higher rate so that benefits could be transferred to subsidize poorer families of the community. \nLastly, community buildings (such as for commons, health, or education) provide an example of a \npublic good for which direct benefits are not as tangible and distinct. In rural infrastructure such as \nthis, public financing for O&M via village funds is common.

No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Nepal: \nPoverty reduction is the overarching goal of the planned development, and the Three Year Interim Plan has targeted to reduce the \nincidence of poverty to 24% by 2010. To achieve this target the Government has assumed a 5% annual growth rate in gross \ndomestic product (GDP). Remittances, more and more decentralized practices of program implementation, and improvement in \naccess to socioeconomic infrastructures are some of the positive factors to help achieve the poverty reduction goals. Rural \ninfrastructures development along with social sector development is one of the Government\u2019s core development strategies. The \nLocal Infrastructure Development Policy 2004, covering various rural infrastructure, has the primary goal of poverty reduction by \npromoting access of local people particularly women, disabled, disadvantaged communities, and dalits to different economic \nopportunities and social service delivery. \n \nThe decade-long conflict has stalled rural infrastructure development in many rural areas. Rural infrastructure is damaged, stalled, \nor dilapidated due to disturbances in regular maintenance. Now, with the peace process in progress, this infrastructure needs \nreconstruction and rehabilitation. The sector development program (SDP) includes improved infrastructure, social mobilization, \nand livelihood skill development programs particularly aiming at the poor and disadvantaged communities. It will help poverty \nreduction through (i) directly employing poor people in the construction works (public works program), (ii) linking market and \nproduction centers and promoting commercialization of agriculture among subsistence farm households, (iii) reducing the prices of \nbasic necessities, (iv) enhancing access to education and health services, (v) making local products competitive through reduced \ntransportation cost, (vi) opening new employment opportunities such as in repair and maintenance of consumer durables \n(watches, transistor etc.), (vii) improving access to cheaper agricultural inputs and raw materials for other cottage and small \nindustries, and (viii) increasing opportunities for technology transfer (training on livelihood skills, demonstration, and exposure). \n \nThe investment Project will focus on 20 districts and provide additional support for rural water supply and sanitation (WSS) in 18 \ndistricts of the Decentralized Rural Infrastructure and Livelihood Project. The eligibility and prioritization criteria ensure the \nplanning and implementation of subprojects serving a maximum of target groups, and policy thrust on choice of technology is \nlabor-based, environment friendly, and participative. With safeguard measures and various training programs planned for the poor \nfor livelihood skills in place, the poor and vulnerable groups are directly targeted, and the Project will ensure poverty reduction. \nThe Project will assess social impact and vulnerability of affected households through socioeconomic surveys and community \nmeetings, and disaggregate information by gender, caste, and ethnicity. It will develop appropriate measures to restore livelihoods \nand enhance living standards of these people. Vulnerable groups, including women and disadvantaged ethnic and caste members \nwill be supported by the use of proportional representation in project employment and construction work, and targeted programs \nthrough livelihood empowerment interventions. \n \nThe Project will enhance rural livelihoods through (i) direct wage payments to poorer households, amounting to about 70% of \nconstruction costs; (ii) training by social mobilizers for building groups and communities to access other development opportunities \nin the district; (iii) direct assistance for community-driven infrastructure investments to complement development of rural roads; \nand (iv) skills development to reduce vulnerability and social exclusion. A total of 15.8 million person-days of jobs and seasonal \nwork will be created during construction and maintenance of rural roads and rural water supply facilities. The Project is expected to \nstimulate more productive agriculture through the cultivation of high-value crops, leading to at least an 8%\u201317% increase in family \nincome. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis         Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nPoverty in Nepal is basically a rural phenomenon; 35% of the rural population falls below the poverty line compared with 10% for \nthe urban population. Nepal experienced a decline in poverty incidence by 11 percentage points between 1995/96 and 2003/04, \nfrom 42% in 1995/96 to 31% in 2003/04. The decline was less rapid in the rural areas, and much more prominent in urban areas. \nPoverty intensity and severity are also higher for rural areas. This means that the growth in urban areas did not have much \ndistributive effect in rural areas due to weak physical and institutional links between the two areas. During the conflict, such linkage \nwas even  weaker. The other reasons are low agriculture growth rates that could have led to  small spillover effects on \nnonagricultural growth in rural areas. \n \nThe relative position of the development regions has not changed much; poverty incidence is higher in the Midwestern and \nFarwestern development regions. The human development index (HDI) also shows broadly the same pattern as income poverty, \nNepal with the HDI value of 0.527 ranked 138th of 150 countries in 2004. \n \nMany Nepalese leave the country for work; their remittances haves helped reduce poverty incidence. Remittances constitute 12% \n ", "Appendix 15  69\nof GDP and 35% of household income; 32% of households receive them. Households receiving remittances exist in all regions of \nthe country, although somewhat more concentrated in the west mountains and hills. \n \nPeople\u2019s access to socioeconomic infrastructure like motorable roads, schools, and health centers has increased markedly. The \ndecline in poverty incidence and improvement in human development indicators are attributed to this improved access. Even then, \nthe young girls may not go to school because their parents happen to be from disadvantaged communities, and they do not have \neasy access to the road and hence to other points of social service delivery. \n \nThe extreme poverty associated with social exclusion of disadvantaged communities has been partly responsible for conflict. The \ndeath casualty due to conflict in all the districts showed that such casualty is higher for the districts with higher poverty incidence \nand illiteracy. The social discrimination and exclusion have also contributed to the conflict through poverty. Conflict is more in the \ndistricts where social caste groups are polarized, and not so much in the districts where more fragmentation is observed with no \nthe dominant caste groups. In such a situation, conflict or for that matter poverty could be reduced by increasing employment \nopportunities, and in the process increasing the opportunity cost of getting involved in the conflict significantly higher. In this \ncontext, the conflict heightened where the road access is exceedingly poor. \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?                Yes  \nIs there a participation strategy?               Yes  \nThe Project will promote participatory approaches through the decentralized government process. Subprojects will be prioritized \nthrough  existing  village  development  committee  participation  in  finalizing  district  transport  master  plans  or  other  sectoral \ndevelopment plans. The Project aims to increase the participation of local stakeholders, particularly socially excluded and poor, in \nthe decision making through a community/social mobilization program. Workshops run by social mobilizers will help local \nstakeholders develop the confidence to speak at meetings and participate in collective decision making. Communities will be \ntrained by the social mobilizers to acquire skills to run community consultations. Within building groups, the capacity of men and \nwomen to voice their concerns will be strengthened through training they will receive from the social mobilization and capacity-\nbuilding activities.          \n \nThe  Project  will  promote  economic  and  social  inclusion  by  ensuring  proportional  representation  of  historically \nmarginalized/disadvantaged population for all aspects of project planning and implementation, particularly in employment and \nincome generation activities. Local social mobilizers will organize the poor and marginalized into groups. Village infrastructure user \ngroups will also have proportional representation of local caste/ethnic groups along the project influence zone to (i) ensure \nparticipation of the poor and vulnerable groups in decision-making, (ii) raise their social capital and access to other development \nopportunities, and (iii) increase their use of health and education facilities in local areas. \n \nThe Project will build local ownership and maintenance of infrastructure work by employing local membership-based district and \nvillage user groups in planning, implementation, and monitoring of construction work. Community-based monitoring systems and \npublic audit will be introduced to prevent corruption and increase social accountability and transparency.  \n \nD.  Gender and Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nGender issues will be mainstreamed throughout project planning and implementation. The monitoring system will have gender \nsensitive indicators and output/impact data disaggregated by gender, caste, and ethnicity. Household socioeconomic surveys will \nbe disaggregated by gender, caste, and ethnicity; and focus group discussions will be held separately with women's groups in the \naffected communities to assess existing gender gaps, women's means and access to livelihood resources, and the likely impact \nand opportunities of the Project on women. Accordingly, equity measures will be developed to maximize project opportunities and \nbenefits to women. \n \nThe Project will provide opportunities for poor women by (i) including them in project employment and construction work, (ii) \nfacilitating a gender responsive environment at the institutional level through awareness and training programs, and (iii) facilitating \ngroup-based  women's empowerment through trainings  in life-skills development and income generation. Under the social \nmobilization program, particular effort will be made to promote and advocate women's involvement in project planning and \nimplementation. Meetings will be organized for women at times that are convenient for them given their many household \nresponsibilities. The Project will address access needs in view of women's priorities. Supplementary investments will have a \nparticular impact on women, for whom access to local facilities is very importantly, notably drinking water supplies, health \nsubposts, primary schools, and market buildings. Supplementary projects exclusively benefiting women and disadvantaged caste \nand ethnic groups will be given priority. \n \nThe Project will address existing gender gaps by mandating (i) 50% of the building group members be women; (ii) 50% of women \nbe represented in district and village infrastructure coordination committees and village infrastructure user groups, as well as in \n ", "7  0  Appendix 15 \nleadership positions within the building groups; (iii) at least 50% women be targeted in livelihood interventions and related training \nprograms. Proportional representation of women from all caste, ethnic, and minority groups will be ensured in building groups, \nvillage infrastructure user groups, and district implementation support teams. The Project will ensure that the social planning and \nimplementation team will have gender and development experience and at least 33% of the project staff be women from diverse \ncaste and ethnic groups. \n \nGender sensitivity training will be provided at both project management and institutions. All project-related training will have a \ngender module. Women and the disadvantaged population will be given extra training to build their leadership skills and \nconfidence to penetrate elite capture and increase their bargaining power. For contract work, an appropriate clause will be \nestablished to ensure wage equality and appropriate facilities (day-care centers) to enable women to participate actively in \nconstruction work and to avoid being allocated the hardest or dirtiest construction tasks. Equipment for construction work will be \nprioritized for women so they can be employed immediately. Women-only building groups will be formed to enhance their \nparticipation. Women will not be confined to unskilled construction work, they will be provided with necessary training to develop \ntheir capacity to do skilled work. On-site gender sensitive training will include awareness programs on reproductive health and \nsexually transmitted diseases, and protective measures will be applied to ensure safety and security of women workers.  \n \nWomen-only self-help groups will be formed to target livelihood enhancement skills training specific to women's needs and \npriorities and to develop their capacity to manage the Project independently. Savings and credit training will be introduced in self-\nhelp groups to help women maintain control of their earnings from construction work and gain a degree of independence. A group-\nbased approach to empowerment activities will be promoted through trainings in life-skills development and income generation. \nMicroenterprise development training will be provided for productive investment of individual and group savings. To avoid confining \nwomen to stereotyped occupations, the Project will encourage them to participate in life-skills and income generation programs \nthat have been traditionally dominated by men. To ensure women's regular income after project completion, they will be trained for \nmaintenance work (length workers). At least 50% of maintenance employment will be reserved for women.  \n \nHas an output been prepared?                Yes. \n \nA gender action plan was developed for the Project.

The required compensation will be \ncompleted before award of civil works contracts, \nwhile other rehabilitation activities will continue \nduring project construction. The Department of \nLocal Infrastructure Development and Agricultural \nRoads (DOLIDAR) will submit semiannual progress \nreports on resettlement plan implementation. \n \nWhile the Project will allow voluntary donation of \nland in building rural infrastructure that provides \ndirect benefits to the community, adequate \nsafeguards will be built in resettlement plans to \nensure that the donation is unforced and the poor \npeople are not asked for donations. The \nsafeguards include (i) full consultation with affected \npeople on site selection; (ii) voluntary donations do \nnot severely affect those affected (i.e., they do not \nfall below the poverty line and lose >20% \nlandholding);  \n(iii) voluntary donation will be confirmed through a \n ", "Appendix 15  71\nItem  Significant/ Not  Strategy to Address Issues  Plan Required \nSignificant/ None \nwritten record, including a \"no coercion\" clause \nverified by an independent third party; and (iv) a \ngrievance redress mechanism is in place.  \n \nAffordability  None  There is no affordability issue.   \n   \n \nLabor   Not significant  The Project will increase income-earning   \nopportunities for women and men, and reduce the \nneed for male migration.

An indigenous people \ndevelopment plan was prepared for this subproject \nto maximize benefits to the indigenous people, \nincluding (i) employment of at least one member \nfrom each affected indigenous household in project \nconstruction and maintenance work; and (ii) at \nleast one member from each indigenous household \nto participate in livelihood enhancement activities \n(skills training, income generation, awareness \nraising in health/sanitation, and other life-skills \nimprovement). It also includes supplementary \ninfrastructure facilities (e.g., drinking water) in the \nindigenous people settlements. Preference will be \ngiven to indigenous people in the recruitment of \ncommunity facilitators, who will maintain frontline \ncontact with indigenous communities when \nimplementing the indigenous people development \nplan as well as overall subproject activities.  \nAn indigenous peoples framework was prepared \nfor the Project to provide policy and procedures to \nscreen subproject impacts on indigenous people \nand prepare planning documents during project \nimplementation in full compliance with ADB\u2019s Policy \non Indigenous Peoples (1998).  \nOther Risks/  Not significant  Potential risks include political instability, weak   \nVulnerabilities  capacity of local nongovernment organizations and \nconsultants, delays in decentralization, and \ninadequate interagency coordination.  \n ", "7  2  Appendix 16 \nGENDER ACTION PLAN \n \nActivity/Measure  Indicators and Targets  Responsible \nRural Roads: Women from all caste, ethnicity, and minority groups have equal access to project resources and services. \nConduct a baseline survey to collect  Updated data disaggregated by gender, caste,  Planning and monitoring \ndisaggregated data on gender, caste, ethnicity,  ethnicity, and minority groups is obtained within  specialist and social \nand minority groups in the project districts.  9 months of the start of the Project.
