It  is  extremely \nvulnerable  to  external  shocks  due  to  its  high  exposure  to  climate  change,  severe  import \ndependency,  and  heavy  reliance  on  income  from  external  sources  making  economic  growth \nhighly volatile. The country\u2019s private sector is small and restricted by high transport costs and a \nlimited production base. The large public sector crowds out entrepreneurial activity because its \nstate-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  operate  in  potentially  competitive  sectors. 3  Development \nperformance indicators are poor, and vulnerability is widespread.4 \n \n\n1. \n\nThe Kiribati Economy \n\n4. \nThe  2008\u20132009  global  economic  crisis  contributed  to  successive  contractions  of \nKiribati\u2019s  economy  in  2009  and  2010.  Largely  driven  by  donor-financed  infrastructure projects, \ngrowth  stabilized  at  close  to  3%  per  annum  during  2011\u20132013. 5 Expanded  opportunities  for \nprivate  sector  participation  in  the  retail  trade  sector  (through  SOE  reforms)  provided  a  further \nboost  to  economic  activity.  Without  autonomous  monetary  policy  due  to  the  use  of  the \nAustralian dollar, the government has depended on fiscal policy to manage the impact of shocks \nand stimulate inclusive growth. To finance fiscal deficits of 7%\u201321% of gross domestic product \n(GDP)  during  2009\u20132012,  the  government  relied  heavily  on  drawdowns  from  the  Revenue \nEqualization Reserve Fund (RERF). The RERF had an estimated value of A$668 million at the \nend  of  2013,  equivalent  to  381%  of  GDP,  but  drawdowns  and  losses  on  RERF  investments \nduring the global economic crisis contributed to an almost 50% reduction of the fund\u2019s balance \nin  real  per  capita  terms  since  2000  limiting  the  government\u2019s  ability  to  manage  economic \nvolatility and react to shocks over the long term. \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The policy matrix is in Appendix 4. Development partners are engaged in ongoing policy reform dialogue related to \nthe KERP and assist its implementation through technical assistance, even when providing budget financing on an \nintermittent basis. \n\n3  Government spending is around 100% of gross domestic product, coinciding with high import dependency. \n4  World Bank. 2014.

Manila. \n\n5   Data  in  paras.  4\u201327  is  from  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  Asian  Development  Outlook  database,  if  not \n\notherwise indicated. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nThe  government\u2019s  current  revenues  have  risen  from  an  average  of  42.5%  of  GDP  in \n5. \n2009\u20132011  to  an  average  of  about  62.0%  in  2012\u20132013  driven  by  strong  fishing  license \nrevenue  through  the  implementation  of  the  vessel  day  scheme  in  2012. 6  However,  these \nincreases in fishing license revenue\u2014from 17.4% to 50.5% of GDP in 2011 to 2013\u2014masked \nan overall decline in tax receipts, which fell from 17.7% to 15.9% of GDP over the same period, \ndue to a narrow tax base, weak tax compliance, and the poor performance by SOEs leading to \nforegone  tax  payments.  Given  its  highly  volatile  revenue  base,  the  government  has  exercised \nexpenditure restraint. The public sector wage bill remained constant in real terms during 2007\u2013\n2012,  and  overall  real  expenditure  declined  by  13%.  SOE  subsidies  remain  high,  however,  at \n4%  of  GDP  in  2012.  The  government  posted  an  estimated  overall  fiscal  surplus  of  10.3%  of \nGDP in 2013 due to better fishing conditions and the substantial rise in fishing license fees since \n2012. Still, it will take time to restore the RERF to sustainable levels. \n \n\n2. \n\nMedium-Term Fiscal Framework \n\n6. \nTo  develop  the  economy,  increase  its  resilience  to  external  shocks,  and  eventually \nreduce individual hardship and vulnerability in Kiribati, the government aims to steadily improve \nfiscal sustainability and stabilize the RERF through the adoption of a fiscal framework in 2012 in \nconsultation  with  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF).  The  framework  includes  long-term \nfiscal  projections  of  the  current  fiscal  deficits  and  real  per  capita  balances  in  the  RERF  for  a \npolicy  stagnation  and  three  reform  scenarios.7 This  program  supports  the  implementation  of \npolicy actions under the strong reform scenario while the policy stagnation scenario serves as \nthe baseline. In both scenarios, development projects currently under implementation contribute \nto  sustained  growth  over  the  near  term  up  to  2016.  In  the  strong  reform  scenario,  fiscal \nadjustment  needs  to  be  gradual  to  avert  strong  negative  effects  on  the  economy  and  living \nstandards. A pickup in private sector activity is projected to compensate for the negative effects \nof this gradual fiscal consolidation during 2015\u20132018. This leads to the same growth levels as in \nthe baseline scenario over this period (Table). Fiscal reform efforts in the strong reform scenario \nresult  in  increased  tax  revenue  collection  and  reduced  current  expenditures,  contributing  to \nimproved fiscal sustainability. \n \n7. \nWhile avoiding further exposure of the fund to excessive risks is important, RERF long-\nterm  performance  will  depend  greatly  on  the  drawdowns  to  finance  current  fiscal  deficits. \nDrawdown  levels  are  linked  to  the  undertaking  and  success  or  failure  of  policy  reforms  to \npromote  growth  and  limit  fiscal  pressures.  Long-run  growth  in  2020\u20132034  under  the  policy \nstagnation  scenario  is  projected  at  1.9%.  Instead,  stronger  fiscal  consolidation  is  expected  to \nreduce  public  sector-driven growth  significantly. This  is  projected  to  be  partly  offset  by greater \nprivate  sector  activity  that  will  support  growth  of  about  1.8%  by  2020  under  the  strong  reform \nscenario.8 The  policy  stagnation  scenario  projects  current  fiscal  deficits  of  more  than  11%  of \nGDP  from  2020  onward  and  an  almost  complete  depletion  of  RERF  resources  by  2030.  The \nstrong-reform scenario, however, would reduce the current fiscal deficit to about 3.6% of GDP \nand stabilize the RERF\u2019s real per capita value at A$3,843 (in 2006 prices) by 2024 (Figure). \n                                                \n6  The scheme was implemented in 2012 by eight Pacific countries that are the parties to the Nauru Agreement. The \nscheme  sets  a  total  number  of  vessel-days  to  be  allocated  between  the  countries  for  sale  to  fishing  fleets.  The \nscheme aims at raising fishing license fees while safeguarding the sustainability of the Pacific\u2019s tuna stocks. \n\n7  IMF.  2014.  Kiribati  Article  IV  Consultation  2014.

The KERP is a medium-\nterm reform program, developed jointly by government\u2013development partner collaborative effort \nto  improve  fiscal  sustainability. 9  In  line  with  Kiribati  Development  Plan  (KDP),  2012\u20132015 \npriorities, the  KERP  aims  to  improve  (i)  expenditure  quality,  (ii)  revenue  performance,  (iii)  the \nmanagement of public assets and liabilities, and (iv) the business environment supported by the \ndevelopment  partners. 10  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  the  World  Bank,  and  the \nGovernment  of  New  Zealand  will  be  providing  (i)  budget  support  in  a  sequenced  manner  to \nsupport  stabilization  of  the  RERF  and  set  incentives  to  maintain  reform  momentum,  and  (ii) \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  to  support  reform  implementation. 11  The  KERP  incorporates  the \nlessons  from  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  policy-based  operations  in  the  Cook  Islands,  the  Marshall \nIslands, Nauru, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Tuvalu, as well as the experience of the \nother  development  partners  across  the  region,  including  in  Kiribati.12 Lessons  incorporated  in \nthe KERP include the need to (i) build strong political consensus for reform, (ii) limit reform to a \nfew substantive areas, (iii) institutionalize a joint government\u2013partner coordination mechanism, \nand  (iv)  adopt  a  medium-term  perspective  that  recognizes  the  severity  of  the  reform \nchallenges.13 \n \nTo demonstrate its commitment to reform, in 2013, the current government (i) approved \n9. \nlegislation to improve tax compliance and to introduce a value-added tax (VAT) to broaden the \nrevenue  base,  (ii)  reduced  the  number  of  temporary  workers  in  ministries  delivering  non-\nessential  services,  thereby  curbing  salary  expenditures,  (iii)  approved  a  debt  policy  to  prevent \ninvestment  committee,  (v) \nnew  nonconcessional  borrowing,  (iv)  established  a  RERF \nsuccessfully  privatized  two  SOEs  and  approved  a  private  sector  strategy,14 (vi)  upgraded  the \npublic financial management (PFM) information system, and (vii) approved a national fisheries \npolicy  to  strengthen  resource  management  and  maximize  license  revenues.  ADB  TA  has \nprovided crucial support to help the government implement SOE reform.15  \n \n10. \nThe  government  is  committed  to  continuing  reforms  through  the  rest  of  its  current \nmandate,  which  is  expected  to  run  until  elections  due  in  late  2015.  It  has  requested  budget \nfinancing  from  its  development  partners  to  help  stabilize  the  RERF  and  provide  incentives  for \nfurther  important  reforms.  In  response,  ADB  has  prepared  the  SFSP  as  a  stand-alone  policy-\nbased  operation that  will  support fiscal  management  and structural  reform\u2014areas  of  historical \n\n                                                \n9  Government of Kiribati.

The  impact  will  be  measured \nagainst  targets  for  improvement  in  the  RERF\u2019s  real  per  capita  value  and  the  government\u2019s \ncurrent  fiscal  deficit.  The  outcome  of  the  program  will  be  government  capacity  for  fiscal \nstabilization built. Outcome progress will be tracked against targets for increased VAT revenue \ncollection and reduced subsidies to SOEs.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n12. \nThe  outputs  align  with  four  priority  policy  reform  goals  that  put  the  country  on  a  path \ntoward  fiscal  stability.  The  SFSP  aims  to  improve  (i)  the  quality  of  public  expenditure,  (ii) \nrevenue performance, (iii) the management of public assets and liabilities, and (iv) the business \nenvironment. All 12 policy actions under the program have been completed. \n \n13. \nOutput  1:  Improved  quality  of  expenditure.  Kiribati\u2019s  economy  is  heavily  dependent \non public expenditure. There is limited scope at this point to reduce spending on wages or core \nsocial  services  without  negatively  affecting  social  outcomes  and  livelihoods,  but  expenditure \nquality  can  be  improved  by  rationalizing  SOE  subsidies.  A  government  review  of  its  copra \nsubsidy  scheme  concluded  that  Kiribati\u2019s  coconut  industry  is  not  financially  viable.  The \ninvolvement  of six  agencies  in  administration  of the  subsidy  has  also  led to  poor  coordination, \nunnecessary  double  handling  of  products,  and  limited  accountability  leading  to  a  \u201cleakage\u201d  of \nabout 40% of the subsidy in 2010 ($2.1 million) and 2011 ($3.6 million).17 The government aims \nto replace copra subsidies in the long term with a better-targeted form of social assistance, but \nthis  will  take  time,  given  the  reliance  on  the  copra  subsidy  in  Kiribati  society.  The  cabinet \napproved  the  review  recommendation  to  merge  the  Kiribati  Copra  Mill  and  the  Kiribati  Copra \nCooperative  Society  into  a  single  SOE  responsible  for  the  entire  sector.  This  will  increase \naccountability,  makes  cost  structures  more  transparent,  and  improves  efficiency  and  reduces \nleakages. The merger will ensure that copra subsidies achieve their main purpose of supporting \nlivelihoods in the outer islands until a better transfer scheme is designed. \n \n14. \nThe government has also prioritized implementation of core provisions of the 2013 SOE \nAct  to  minimize  the  fiscal  drain  to  inefficient  SOEs  through  the  replacement  of  subsidies  with \ncommunity  service  obligations  (CSOs).18 All  subsidies  to  SOEs  were  cut  in  the  2015  budget \nprocess.  The  new  process  requires  SOEs  to  submit  CSO  bids  to  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and \nEconomic  Development  (MFED)  during  the  budget  process.  This  has  formed  the  basis  for  a \ntransparent CSO negotiation process between MFED and SOEs in which costs can be clearly \nassigned to specific services. These negotiations reduce wastage and provide the government \nwith better value for money and allow for more strategic resource allocation. \n \nOutput 2: Improved revenue administration. With assistance from the Government of \n15. \nAustralia  and  the  Pacific  Financial  Technical  Assistance  Center,  the  government  implemented \n                                                \n16 ADB. 2009.

Proposed Institutional Reform of Kiribati Coconut Sector. Unpublished. \n18 The  act  requires  SOEs  to  operate  as  commercial  entities.  In  cases  where  SOEs  are  performing  unprofitable \n\nservices for the benefit of the public, they can request the government for support through CSO funding. \n\n \n\n\fthe  VAT  on  1  April  2014  (para.  9).  This  was  in  response  to  declining  revenues  from  personal \nincome  and  company  taxes  and  a  phasing  out  of  trade  taxes.  Sound  implementation  is \nexpected to at least offset the loss of revenue from the phased-out import duties within the first \nyear of full implementation in 2015, broaden the tax base in the long run, and increase overall \ntax revenue yield. The SFSP supported these efforts by reviewing VAT implementation over the \nfirst quarter. It identified bottlenecks and capacity gaps that are being addressed by government \nin collaboration with the development partners supporting revenue administration in Kiribati. \n \nReceipts  from  tuna  fishing  license  fees  represent  40%\u201370%  of  current  government \n16. \nrevenue  in  2009\u20132013. There  is a  need  to  ensure that  such  information on  the fishing  license \nrevenue  is  shared  properly  by  agencies  within  the  government.  A  lack  of  transparency  in \nfisheries  license  agreements  creates  uncertainty  in  the  projection  of  revenues.  It  also  likely \nreduces  the  amounts remitted to  the government general  account. The  program established  a \njoint  committee  between  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries  and  Marine  Resource  Development  and  the \nMFED to facilitate collaboration and information sharing on fishing license revenue between the \ntwo  ministries.  The  committee  produced  a  report  detailing  collections  for  2013  under  the \nprogram,  which  provides  the  basis  for  a  planned  analysis  and  review  of  fishing  license \nagreements aimed at achieving government policy objectives. This intragovernment information \nsharing  is  a  first  step  toward  optimizing  the  fisheries  sector  and  (i)  enables  the  government\u2019s \nbudget  team  to  make  meaningful  projections,  thereby  improving  budget  credibility;  and  (ii) \nallows the MFED to make a reliable assessment and advise the cabinet on whether Kiribati is \n(a) maximizing the sustainability and value of its fisheries resources through existing and future \nlicense  agreements  and  joint  venture  arrangements,  and  (b)  complying  with  catch  limits  and \nother conditions established under regional frameworks. \n \n17. \nliabilities.  Sound \nImproved  management  of  public  assets  and \nmanagement  of  the  RERF  assets  is  another  key  to  restoring  fiscal  sustainability.  Losses \nincurred  on  investments  during  the  global  economic  crisis  highlighted  inadequacies  in  the \nmanagement  arrangements.  A  review  of  the  RERF  management  recommended  (i)  improving \nalignment between strategic asset allocation and investment objectives, (ii) revising investment \nguidelines  to  remove  ambiguity  and  avoid  excessive  risk  taking,  and  (iii)  adopting  more \nappropriate mechanisms for monitoring and assessing the performance of asset managers. The \nSFSP  required  the  cabinet  to  approve  and  implement  these  reforms  to  achieve  greater \nalignment  between  RERF  management  and strategy  objectives. This  included  the  reallocation \nof  the  RERF\u2019s  assets  to  new  asset  managers,  who  will  operate  under  set  guidelines,  and  the \nreorientation  of  the  portfolio  towards  lower-risk  instruments.  Asset  allocation  is  to  be  25%  in \npublic equities and 75% in bonds. \n \n18. \nThe government\u2019s fiscal position also suffers from weak debt management. The results \nhave included (i) accumulation of substantial debt at high interest rates, including the use of a \nhigh-interest  overdraft  facility,  despite  the  government\u2019s  ability  to  access  financing  at  a  lower \ncost  from  the  RERF,  (ii)  a  lack  of  information  on  how  much  debt  is  outstanding,  and  (iii)  the \ncontracting of government debt and guarantees without the knowledge of all cabinet members \nor appropriate advice from the MFED. The SFSP supported implementation of a new debt policy \nadopted by the government in 2013 and required the MFED to appoint an officer dedicated to \ndebt  policy  monitoring.  This  is  intended  to  (i)  ensure  that  loan  and  guarantee  decisions  are \nbased on appropriate advice and guided by strategic policy considerations; (ii) avoid recourse to \nexpensive commercial borrowing; and (iii) prevent reaccumulation of overdraft balances and the \ninappropriate granting of further loan guarantees to SOEs and joint ventures. \n \n\nOutput  3: \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\nOutput  4:  Improved  structural  reform  implementation.  Inefficient  SOEs  dominate \n19. \nlarge  parts  of  the  economy  crowding  entrepreneurial  activity  out  of  potentially  competitive \nsectors and drain government fiscal resources. ADB TA projects have supported the significant \nSOE reform efforts undertaken by the government since 2012 (footnotes 11). These led to the \npassing  of  the  SOE  Act  in  2013,  initiation  of  restructuring  and  privatization  processes  for \nselected  SOEs,  and  an  improved  oversight  framework  that  brought  about  better  corporate \ngovernance.  The  government\u2019s  SOE  reform  road  map  has  identified  specific  SOEs  for \nrestructuring to improve SOE efficiency and promote private sector participation in the economy. \nThe  SFSP supported the  restructuring  of four  SOEs\u2014the  Kiribati  Shipping  Services;  the  Plant \nand Vehicle Unit (PVU), which purchases and maintains government vehicles; Bobotin Kiribati, \na food wholesaler; and Betio Shipyard. To improve SOE efficiency and reduce the fiscal drain, \nthe SFSP required SOEs to develop statements of intent that include projections for cash flows, \nannual balance sheets, and annual profits; submit financial statements for audit; and ensure that \nall board appointments are in full compliance with the act. An exception to the latter requirement \ninvolves  the  advisory  committee  of  the  PVU.  This  is  due  to  legal  ambiguity  over  whether  the \nPVU falls under the SOE Act or is a special fund as defined in the PVU Act. \n \nD. \n \n20. \nThe  government  has  requested  a  grant  not  exceeding  $3.0  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds resources (i) to help meet the financing gap for the 2014 fiscal year; and (ii) to incentivize \nthe political approval and technical implementation of the KERP policy reform actions needed to \ngradually  move  toward  fiscal  sustainability  in  the  long  term.  The  government  forecasts  its \nfinancing  requirements  for  2014  to  be  $37.1  million  (22.6%  of  GDP),  $26.9  million  in  2015 \n(15.8%  of  GDP),  and  $25.6  million  in  2016  (14.5%  of  GDP).  These  estimates  project  a \nsubsequent  decline  of these  needs to  a  sustainable  level  of  3.6%  of GDP  by  2025. The  ADB, \nthe Government of New Zealand, and the World Bank jointly support the implementation of the \nKERP,  with  the  two  partners  providing  collaborative  cofinancing  of  Kiribati\u2019s  budget  in  2014  in \nthe  amount  of  $0.9 million  (New  Zealand)  and  $8.2  million  (World  Bank). This joint  assistance \nallows the government to reduce RERF drawdowns by $12.1 million in 2014 and contributes to \nthe  fund\u2019s  long-term  stabilization.  Continuous  financial  support  by  development  partners  is \nexpected over the medium term within the programmatic framework of the KERP. \n \n21. \nThe  successful  implementation  of  the  SFSP  will  (i)  immediately  save  the  government \nover  $2.0  million  in  subsidies  in  2015  by  reducing  leakages  (para.  13);  (ii)  allow  better  use  of \ngovernment  funds  and  a  reduction  of  wastage  through  use  of  CSOs  (para.  14),  (iii)  reduce \npublic  debt  to  $1.0  million  by  2015  and  save  future  servicing  costs  through  better  debt \nmanagement,  and  (iv)  reduce  fiscal  risks  from  SOEs  and  thereby  limit  potential  negative \nimplications  on  the  budget.  On  the  revenue  side,  the  government  is  expected  to  generate \nrevenue of $12.4 million in 2014 (7.6% of GDP) from VAT increasing to 10.2% of GDP by 2019 \n(para. 15). The government is also making progress in substantially increasing fisheries license \nfee  revenues  (para.  16).  ADB  determined  the  proposed  program  grant  amount  based  on  the \navailable  Asian  Development  Fund  allocation  for  Kiribati,  the  government\u2019s  progress  in \nimplementing  its  ambitious  reform  agenda,  and  the  need  to  maximize  leverage  for  political \napproval and technical implementation of the KERP policy reform actions.  \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nProgram  management.  The  MFED,  as  the  executing  agency,  oversees  timely \n22. \nimplementation of the agreed policy actions by the implementing agencies and is responsible for \nprogram administration, disbursements, and maintaining all records. The MFED acts as the joint \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nimplementing agency with the Ministry of Commerce, Industries, and Cooperatives for output 1; \nwith  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries  and  Marine  Resource  Development  on  reporting  fisheries \nrevenues  for  output  2;  and  with  the  Ministry  of  Communication,  Transportation,  and  Tourism \nDevelopment and the Ministry of Public Works and Utilities for outputs 3 and 4. To help deliver \nthese  last  two  outputs,  it  works  through  an  established  SOE  reform  steering  committee  that \ncomprises the secretaries from these ministries, an official from the Lands Department, and the \nsecretary to the cabinet. ADB and other development partners have provided and will continue \nto make available TA support to help the government accomplish the policy actions and achieve \nprogram outcomes (footnote 11). Program and post-program partnership framework monitoring \nwill be carried out by the MFED, complemented by oversight by the economic working group of \nthe government and development partners that monitors KERP implementation.19 \n \nImplementation  period.  The  program  is  being  implemented  from  1  January  to  31 \n23. \nDecember  2014,  consistent  with  the  government\u2019s  medium-term  fiscal  framework  and  budget \ncycle.  \n \nProcurement  and  disbursement.  The grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance \n24. \nwith ADB\u2019s simplification of disbursement procedures and related requirements for policy-based \ngrants.20 The proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of items produced and \nprocured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  items  included  in  a  list  of  ineligible  items  and \nimports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources.21 Grant proceeds disbursed against \nimports  will  require  a  certificate  from  the  government  stipulating  that  the  value  of  the  total \nimports of Kiribati, minus its imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports \nfinanced  under  other  official  development  assistance,  is  greater  than  the  amount  of  the  grant \nexpected to be disbursed in 2014. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the grant proceeds \nand to verify the accuracy of the government\u2019s certification. \n \n25. \nTranches  and  counterpart  funds.  The  grant  will  be  provided  in  a  single  tranche  and \nmay  be  withdrawn  upon  satisfaction  of  grant  effectiveness  conditions\u2014i.e.,  fulfillment  of  all \nprogram policy actions (Appendix 4). Local currency generated from the grant will be directed to \nthe  government\u2019s  bank  account  with  the  Australia  and  New  Zealand  Banking  Group  to  allow \nfinancial assistance for the 2014 budget. \n \n26. \nProgram  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  government  monitors  the \nimplementation and outcome of the SFSP, using a set of indicators and targets that has been \nagreed  between  the  government  and  ADB.  For  each  of  the  agreed  indicators,  progress  is \nmeasured  against  the  baselines  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  (Appendix  1).  The \nresponsible implementing agencies support the review of agreed actions to determine progress \nand identify constraints. Because the outcome of the program will be felt beyond the period of \nits  implementation,  the  MFED  will  continue  monitoring  program  performance  until  the  end  of \n2015, and KERP monitoring will be carried out on a continuous basis by the economic working \ngroup of the government and development partners. The information from this monitoring will be \nincluded in the program completion report. \n \n\n                                                \n19 The  economic  working  group  is  composed  of  representatives  from  the  government  and  development  partners, \n\nincluding ADB, and is chaired by the secretary for finance and economic development. \n\n20 ADB. 1998.

The \ncurrent fiscal deficit is also projected to reduce to 12.7% of GDP in 2018, compared with 21.6% \nif policy does not change. These improvements will result in a more sustainable fiscal position \nover the long term and build the government\u2019s ability to respond to external shocks. Individual \nreform  actions  will  improve  the  quality  of  expenditures,  strengthen  the  government\u2019s  revenue \nposition,  and  improve  the  management  of  assets  and  liabilities,  while  opening  up  selected \nsectors  to  private  competition  with  the  aim  of  increasing  employment  and  reducing  consumer \nprices.  \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\nframework \n\nA  2010  public  expenditure  and \n\nfinancial  accountability  assessment \n\n28. \nidentified \nweaknesses  in  the  government\u2019s  PFM  systems. 23  Since  then,  development  partners  have \nhelped the government design and implement a PFM plan for 2011\u20132014 by (i) putting in place \na  medium-term  budget \nto  underpin  strategic  allocation  of  resources,  (ii) \nstrengthening  the  customs  and  tax  departments  for  VAT  implementation,  (iii)  developing \ncapacity  of  the  National  Economic  and  Planning  Office  to  improve  planning  and  budgeting \nlinkages,  (iv)  strengthening  the government\u2019s  Accounting  Department  in the  use  of  accounting \nsoftware and preparation of financial reports, and (iv) developing external audit capacities.24 \n \n29. \nA review of the public procurement system was undertaken in 2012\u20132013. As indicated \nin the post-program partnership framework, the government is planning to implement proposed \nchanges by mid-2015. PFM reform actions have also been supported by the KERP. The PFM \nsystem  upgrade  that  introduced  a  commitment  control  system  allows  the  MFED  to  control \nbudget execution across the government.

No  adverse  environmental  impacts  have  been  identified.  Public  consultations  were  carried \nout during the processing of the program. \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe program\u2019s overall risk is rated medium, with three key risk factors identified.26 With \n32. \nelections  due  in  2015, the  political  consensus  needed  to  achieve  the  intended fiscal  and  SOE \nmanagement  reforms  may  prove  more  difficult  to  obtain  than  is  anticipated.  Staff  turnover  in \nMFED  could  leave  too  few  qualified  and  experienced  personnel  to  manage  implementation  of \nprogram elements. Kiribati\u2019s extreme vulnerability to shocks could diverge fiscal indicators from \nthose  envisaged  and  targeted.  The  program  has  been  designed  to  mitigate  these  risks.  The \nframework  constitutes  a  mitigation  strategy  against  potential \npost-program  partnership \nweakening  of  the  government  reform  commitment.  Political  consensus  is  being  obtained  and \nsustained  through  government  ownership  and  leadership  of  the  KERP  process  and  by \ncontinuous outreach to parliamentarians and the general public building on an already high level \nof media coverage and public awareness to build wide stakeholder support for reform and the \nrole  of  development  partners  in  supporting  the  government\u2019s  efforts  through  budget  financing \nand TA. To help offset the risk of skills shortages, government staff resources are supplemented \nthrough  ADB  and  other  development  partners\u2019  TA  projects.  Fiduciary  risks  have  been \naddressed through the PFM reform plan activities (paras. 28\u201329). \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \n33. \nall  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the grant \nagreement. The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the program, which \nare set forth in the grant agreement.
