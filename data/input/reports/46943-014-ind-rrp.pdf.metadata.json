In  2009\u20132010,  rural \npoverty incidence stood at 33.8% (as opposed to 20.9% in urban areas). India is still home to \nsome 280 million rural poor.1 While agriculture remains the main source of rural livelihood, rural \npoverty  can  also  be  reduced  through  the  expansion  of  post-harvest  operations  and  food \nprocessing,  which  provide  both  market  linkages  to  farmers  and  nonfarm  employment. 2 \nHorticulture  specifically  represents  a  strong  opportunity  for  poverty  reduction.  Horticulture  is \nconsidered a type of high-value agriculture as it gives a higher rate of return to farmers per unit \nof land than the production of staple crops. It can also sustain agro-industries, which generate \nsubstantial  employment. The World  Bank  estimated that  year-round, full-time employment  can \nbe generated by a one-hectare shift from cereal to vegetable in one planting season.3 \n \n3. \nHorticulture in India has grown significantly in recent years. While staple crop production \nhas grown by 2.8% a year during 2007\u20132012, horticulture production has grown at 4.7% in the \nsame  period  (footnote  2).  The  horticulture  sector  now  contributes  about  28%  of  agricultural \ngross  domestic  product  (GDP)  from  about  13%  of  the  area  under  cultivation.  Demand  for \nhorticulture  products  is  likely  to  continue  to  grow  even  faster  on  account  of  both  internal  and \nexternal demand. The consumer basket in India is undergoing changes, with preference shifting \nto perishables such as fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. As the second largest producer of \nfruits  and vegetables  in the  world  (after the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China),  India is  also  a major \nexporter.4 Horticulture represents 37% of the total exports of agricultural commodities.5   \n \nHorticulture  production,  however,  remains  constrained  by  the  weak  post-harvest  and \n4. \nmarket  infrastructure  and  the  fragmentation  in  value  chains  and  production  systems.  These \nresult  in  high  post-harvest  wastage  of  fresh  produce  estimated  to  be  about  35%  of  total \nproduction\u2014equivalent  to  Rs350  billion  in  value  terms\u2014and  very  low  processing. 6  The \ninadequate facilities for storage also result in considerable fluctuations in the price of products \nthrough  the  season  (footnote  2).  These  key  constraints  can  be  addressed  through  upgrading \nboth public and private agribusiness infrastructure and supporting value chain aggregators and \nfood processors. Accordingly, post-harvest and cold storage facilities have been included in the \ngovernment\u2019s definition of infrastructure to provide incentives to the financial sector. \n \n5. \nIn June 2012, Champion Agro Limited approached Asian Development Bank (ADB) for \nfinancing  a  $22.8 million  investment,  over  2  years,  for  a  horticulture  cold  chain  project.  The \n\n                                                      \n1   Asian Development Bank (ADB). Forthcoming. Country Partnership Strategy: India, 2013\u20132017.

However, a study conducted in Punjab from FY2007 to FY2009 concluded that post-harvest \nwastage was 6%\u201318%. Whatever the exact baseline, the potential for wastage reduction remains great. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nproject is central to the company\u2019s strategy of adding value to the production of fresh fruits and \nvegetables, improving supply chain efficiency, and expanding access to customers in key cities. \nThe  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  nonsovereign  strategic  agenda  of  pursuing  agribusiness \ninvestments with high potential for developmental impact. Champion Agro was found to be one \nof the most reputable agribusiness sponsors in India, creditworthy, and well placed to leverage \nADB\u2019s funds toward development. \n \n6. \nThe project is fully consistent with the objectives of India\u2019s Twelfth Five Year Plan, 2012\u2013\n2017 for the farm sector: (i) higher productivity in farming; (ii) higher value for farming; and (iii) a \nmajor expansion of post-harvest activities, including storage and processing. To achieve these \ngoals,  the  plan  calls  for  (i)  developing  integrated  value  chains  for  high-value  segments  of \nagriculture;  (ii)  encouraging  private  investment  in  cold  chain  and  food  processing;  (iii)  linking \nsmall  farmers  with  markets  through  producer  companies  and  corporate  retailers;  and  (iv) \ncontinuing with policy reforms allowing private sector markets and contract farming (footnote 2). \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n7. \nThe  project  will  have  the  following  four  components  across  the  horticulture  cold  chain: \n(i) five  collection  centers,  (ii)  a  controlled  atmosphere  cold  storage  facility,  (iii)  an  individually \nquick frozen facility, and (iv) five distribution centers. The project will support Champion Agro\u2019s \nhorticulture business from the collection of fresh fruits and vegetables from farmers in Gujarat to \ntheir distribution to corporate clients in large Indian cities and abroad. \n \n8. \nChampion Agro will set up five collection centers in Gujarat (Navsari, Junagadh, Prantij, \nRajpipla, and Borsad), with total capacity of 50,000 tons of fruits and vegetables per year. Each \ncenter  will  include  (i)  a  cleaning,  grading,  and  packing  line;  (ii)  a  pre-cooling  chamber;  (iii)  a \nholding  cold  store;  (iv)  a  warehouse;  and  (v)  reefer  vans.  The  collection  centers  will  be \nstrategically located near farms. The major produce collected will be bananas and mangos.   \n \n9. \nThe controlled atmosphere cold storage facility will be located in Palanpur (Gujarat) and \nwill have a capacity of 5,000 tons of fruits and vegetables per year. It will provide long duration \nstorage for fruits and vegetables to ensure the smooth supply of the produce when the supply is \nlow and the demand is high and to reduce food wastage. The facility will include (i) a pre-cooling \nchamber;  (ii)  a  holding  cold  store;  and  (iii)  a  controlled  atmosphere  cold  store  (in  which \ntemperature,  humidity,  and  concentration  of  oxygen  and  carbon  dioxide  are  regulated).  The \nmajor produce stored will be apples, pears, oranges, lemons, and pomegranates. \n \n10. \nThe individually quick frozen facility will be located in Gundasara (Gujarat), with capacity \nof 8,000 tons of fruits and vegetables per year. The individually quick frozen technology (often \nreferred  as  IQF)  is  a  food  preservation  technology  where  fresh  food  passes  through  the  low \ntemperature zone very quickly, leaving very low and safe microbial counts. The major produce \nprocessed will be sweet corn, green peas, green vegetables, mango cubes, and papaya cubes. \nThe  majority  of  the  produce  (around  70%)  will  be  exported.  At  least  five  important  ports  are \nlocated within a radius of 150\u2013200 kilometers of Gundasara. \n \n11. \nChampion  Agro  will  set  up  five  distribution  centers  in  large  cities  of  Northern  India \n(Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Delhi, Ludhiana, and Panchkula), with capacity of 60,000 tons of produce \nper  year.  The  distribution  centers  will  service  supermarket  wholesalers  (e.g.,  Bharti,  Walmart, \nCarrefour,  Future  Fresh,  Reliance  Fresh,  and  Safal)  and  food  processors  in  areas  of  large \ndemand  for  fruits  and  vegetables.  The  centers  will  source  produce  from  the  company\u2019s \ncollection centers and controlled atmosphere cold storage facilities, as well as local producers. \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nEach center will include (i) a cleaning, grading, and packing line; (ii) a pre-cooling chamber; and \n(iii) a holding cold store. The major produce stored for final distribution will be bananas. \n \n12. \nADB\u2019s commercial and technical consultant visited the proposed locations and confirmed \nthe suitability of the areas in terms of existing and potential horticulture production; proximity to \nmarkets; availability of workers; and access to roads, water, and electricity. \n \n\n3. \n\nThe Borrower \n\n13. \nChampion  Agro  is  a  leading  Indian  agribusiness  company  from  Gujarat.  Established  in \n1990,  the  company  was  originally  named  Magnetic  Industries  and  its  initial  business  was  the \nmanufacturing  of  agricultural  irrigation  systems.  In  2005,  the  company  devised  the  concept  of \nagro retail malls\u2014one-stop shops for farmers selling agricultural inputs (e.g., seeds, pesticides, \nand  fertilizers)  and  equipment  (e.g.,  farm  machinery,  greenhouses,  and  irrigation  systems).  In \n2008,  the  company  entered  into  the  processing  of  fresh  fruits  and  vegetables,  supported  by \ncontract farming and leased farmland.7 In 2010, the company renamed itself Champion Agro to \nreflect the company\u2019s new core business focus on agribusiness. \n \n14. \nChampion Agro is a unique agribusiness player in India, in that it is fully integrated from \nthe provision of agricultural inputs to farmers up to the delivery of fresh fruits and vegetables to \ncorporate retailers. The company owns a chain of 44 agro retail malls in Gujarat, and has plans \nto  scale  up  this  model  in  selected  Indian  states.  Champion  Agro  is  directly  involved  in \nagricultural activities, with about 5,000 hectares under lease farming and about 12,000 hectares \nunder  contract \nthe  cultivation  of  seeds \nin  Gujarat.  The  company  supports \n(e.g., chickpea, peanut, and sesame) to supply its agro retail malls, along with fresh fruits and \nvegetables  that  are  bought  back  to  be  processed  and  distributed.  The  company  owns  and \nleases  processing,  storage,  and  distribution  facilities  across  several  Indian  states  (Gujarat, \nHimachal Pradesh, and Delhi). Other businesses of the company include cattle feed production, \nmanufacturing of irrigation pumps and greenhouses, and farm services (testing, consultancy). \n \n15. \nChampion Agro directly employs about 200 people, including at least 170 with university \neducation in agronomy and agribusiness. In addition, about 8,500 farmers work under contract \nand  lease  farming  with  the  company;  15,000  have  been  trained  in  scientific  crop  cultivation \npractices, and 40,000 have benefited from the company\u2019s consultancy services.  \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Output  \n\nfarming \n\n1. \n\nImpacts  \n\n16. \nThe  project  will  contribute  to  increased  horticulture  growth  in  India.  According  to  the \nobjectives in the Twelfth Five Year Plan, horticulture production growth will increase to 6.5% per \nyear during the Twelfth Five Year Plan, 2012\u20132017 from 4.8% per year during the Eleventh Five \nYear  Plan,  2007\u20132012  (footnotes  1  and  2).  The  project  will  contribute  to  private  sector \ndevelopment by promoting an increase in lending for pre- and post-harvest activities (a priority \nsector monitored by the Reserve Bank of India) from Rs146 billion in FY2011 to at least Rs400 \nbillion in FY2017.8 As such, the project will contribute to a reduction in post-harvest wastage of \n                                                      \n7  Under  the  lease  farming  model,  the  company  leases  land  from  farmers  (on  a  yearly  basis)  and  conducts  all \nagricultural activities with scientific inputs such as soil and water testing, land leveling, and installation of drip and \nmicro irrigation systems; all output is for captive consumption. Under the contract farming model, farmers conduct \nagricultural activities while the company provides inputs, guidance, and guaranteed purchase of the crop. \n\n8   Reserve  Bank  of  India.  2013.  Statistical  Tables  Relating  to  Banks  in  India.

Reduction in post-harvest wastage will contribute to more efficient use \nof  water  resources.  India  is  one  of  the  most  water-stressed  countries  in  the  world,  and  most \nwater  demand  comes  from  agriculture.  Reduction  in  post-harvest  wastage  and  more  water-\nefficient agriculture are essential to meeting the impending water crisis in India.  \n \n17. \nThe  project  will  contribute  to  a  reduction  in  rural  poverty  in  Gujarat  from  26.7%  in \nFY2010 to 20.0% by FY2017, in line with the Twelfth Five Year Plan\u2019s national poverty reduction \nobjectives,  by  including  farmers  in  the  horticulture  value  chain.9 According  to  a  recent  paper, \nformal value chains \u2015tend to provide greater income security but not necessarily higher prices. \nWhen higher incomes do occur, it is often from higher yields, improved quality, or value-added \nactivities.\u2016 10 This  is  where  an  integrated company like  Champion  Agro  can  make  a difference. \nThrough its agro retail malls, consultancy services, and contract farming, Champion Agro helps \nfarmers focus on high-value crops, increase in yields, and improvements in the quality of their \nproduce. Processing and storage activities add value to the produce. Finally, the elimination of \nintermediaries can help farmers capture a higher share of the final price paid by the consumer. \nAccording  to  Champion  Agro,  an  incremental  income  of  about  35%\u201350%  accrues  to  farmers \nfrom  an  association  with  the  company.11 ADB  will  consider  conducting  a  distribution  analysis \nduring project implementation to validate the direct poverty reduction benefits of the project, as \nwell as its gender inclusion benefits given the importance of women in agricultural production. \n \n18. \nFinally, the project will contribute to improved nutrition in India. A minimum of 400 grams \nof fruits and vegetables per day is recommended for the prevention of chronic diseases and the \nalleviation  of  micronutrient  deficiencies.12 In  India,  only  15%  of  the  population  consumed  this \ndaily minimum in 2005.13 The project is expected to contribute to an increase in that proportion.  \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\nThe project\u2019s expected outcome will be increased processing and distribution of quality \n19. \nfruits and vegetables sourced from local farmers and supported by technical assistance from the \ncompany  on  high-yield  water-efficient  technologies.  Champion  Agro\u2019s  sales  of  fruits  and \nvegetables are expected to increase from about $2.6 million in FY2012 to at least $18.3 million \nin FY2017. The number of company\u2019s employees is expected to increase from 200 in FY2012 to \nat  least  300  in  FY2017. The  number  of farmers working  with  the  company  under  contract  and \nlease  farming  is  expected  to  increase  from  8,500  in  FY2012  to  15,000  in  FY2017.  The  land \nconverted to high-yield water-efficient agriculture is expected to increase from 12,000 hectares \nin FY2012 to 20,000 hectares in FY2017.14 Higher yields will be achieved through better water \nmanagement  and  more  efficient  irrigation  systems,  better  seed  selection  and  better  usage  of \npesticides, and soil and water testing to determine the optimum utilization of agricultural inputs. \n\n                                                      \n9  Government of India, Planning Commission. 2013.

The  second  output  is  the  implementation  of  the \ncompany\u2019s  environmental  and  social  management  system  (ESMS)  and \nthe  project\u2019s \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) by FY2016. \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\nAccording  to  Strategy  2020,  supporting  agriculture  is  an  \u2015underlying  component  of  the \n21. \ninclusive  growth  strategy\u2016  because  \u2015the  majority  of  the  poor  still  live  in  rural  areas,  and \nagriculture  remains  a  source  of  productivity  improvement,  seasonal  employment,  and  income \ngrowth\u2014especially  when  connected  to  urban,  industrial,  and  export  markets.\u201615 As  such,  the \nproject  is  particularly  relevant  because  Champion  Agro  is  connecting  farmers  to  urban \nconsumers and export markets. The project is also consistent with Strategy 2020\u2019s objective of \nscaling up private sector development and private sector operations in all operational areas. \n \nUnder the forthcoming country partnership strategy for India, 2013\u20132017, agribusiness is \n22. \none of the sectors to be supported by the Private Sector Operations Department: \u2015ADB\u2019s private \nsector  operations  will  explore  new  investments  in  agribusiness  to  support  the  government\u2019s \nstrategy of developing integrated value chains for high-value segments of agriculture and linking \nsmall  farmers  with  markets.\u2016  The  forthcoming  country  partnership  strategy  also  insists  on  the \ncritical need to improve agribusiness infrastructure to reduce post-harvest losses and increase \nvalue-adding  processing  through  the  \u2015aggregation  of  horticulture  produce,  post-harvest  (e.g., \ngrading,  sorting,  and  packaging),  storage,  and  market  facilities  in  a  more  integrated  manner \nemploying an integrated value chain approach.\u2016 (footnote 1) \n \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n\nThe  project  is  fully  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  agriculture  sector  strategy.  In  particular,  the \n23. \nOperational  Plan  for  Sustainable  Food  Security,  2009  recommends  an  \u2015expanded  partnership \nwith  the  private  sector\u2016  to  attract  \u2015more  direct  investments  in  productivity  enhancement,  agro-\nprocessing,  agro-retailing  and  other  nonfarm  rural  business.\u2016  The  project  also  addresses  the \noperational  plan\u2019s  objective  of  \u2015increasing  synergy  and  value  addition  in  the  backward  and \nforward linkages along the food and agriculture value chain.\u2016 Improved linkages along the value \nchain enhance productivity, employment opportunities, exports and regional trade, but also food \nsecurity for the poor in both rural and urban areas.16  \n \n24. \nHorticulture has been the focus of ADB\u2019s sovereign assistance to the Indian agriculture \nsector since 2010. ADB funded horticulture value chain studies and investment projects in Bihar \nand  Maharashtra. 17  An  ongoing  South  Asia  Department  study  involves  a  review  of  the \nhorticulture  value  chain  in  six  other  Indian  states.  Since  Gujarat  is  one  of  the  selected  states, \nthe  South  Asia  Department  agreed  to  involve  Champion  Agro  in  this  study,  allowing  for \n\n                                                      \n15 ADB.  2008.

The \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nAspects \narrangements \n\nSupply arrangements \n\nArrangements \ncompany is already operating similar supply chain facilities, including 14 collection centers \nand  four cold  storage facilities  in  Gujarat,  Himachal  Pradesh,  and  New  Delhi.  Additional \ntechnical specialists will be recruited and trained to run the new facilities. \nMost  produce  will  be  sourced  from  local  farmers  based  on  the  contract  farming  model \n(e.g.,  baby  corn,  banana)  or  from  the  company\u2019s  own  production  on  leased  land \n(e.g., pomegranate).  Both  models  provide  long-term  comfort  to  the  company  in  terms  of \nvolume, price, and quality of supply. \nChampion  Agro  will report  on  key  performance indicators,  including output and  outcome \nindicators. \n\nPerformance \nmonitoring \n\nSource: Champion Agro.  \n \nF. \n\nUnique Features \n\n28. \nThe  project  promotes  inclusive  agricultural  value  chains.  Champion  Agro  will  assist \nfarmers in switching to high-value horticulture cultivation and in reducing post-harvest losses. By \nentering into contract farming arrangements with farmers and providing them with post-harvest \ninfrastructure, Champion Agro will link farmers to markets for fresh fruits and vegetables in India \nand  abroad.  The  project  will  also  promote  formal  employment  in  the  cold  chain  sector.  This \nproject will be ADB\u2019s first nonsovereign agribusiness project in India. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\nThe proposed assistance is a senior secured loan of $18.4 million. \n\n29.  \n \nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n30.   ADB  will  provide  long-term  fixed-rate  financing,  which  is  not  readily  available  in  this \nsector.  ADB\u2019s  assistance will  contribute to  raising the  profile of  a  medium-sized company  with \nstrong  growth  potential.  As  Champion  Agro  becomes  larger,  Indian  commercial  banks\u2014which \nare  already  providing  short-term  working  capital  loans  to  the  company\u2014will  be  expected  to \nreplace ADB as providers of long-term loans to finance the company\u2019s capital expenditures. The \nproject  will  have  synergies  with  ADB\u2019s  public  sector  support  to  the  horticulture  sector  in  India, \nand  will  contribute  to  the  government\u2019s  objectives  of  promoting  private  sector  investment  and \nemployment in high-value agriculture and agribusiness infrastructure. ADB\u2019s assistance will also \npromote  the  adoption  of  environmental  and  social  best  practices  in  the  sector.  Overall,  the \nproject  will  set  an  example  for  private  sector-led  horticulture  cold  chain  investments  in  other \ndeveloping member countries, which will benefit from the lessons learned in India.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project  is  classified \n39.  \ncategory  B  for  environment  and  category  C  for  both  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous \npeoples. The potential environmental and social impacts of the project have been identified and \neffective  measures  to  avoid,  minimize,  mitigate,  and  compensate  for  the  adverse  impacts  are \nincorporated  in  the  safeguards  reports  and  plans.  Potential  impacts  are  limited  to  wastewater \nand solid waste generation, noise, odor, occupational health and safety, and community safety; \nand  such  impacts  can  be  prevented  and  mitigated  using  tested  and  proven  measures.  The \nfacilities will  be  operated  in accordance  with the provisions  of  the  Food Safety  Act,  2012. The \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nincluding  energy  efficient  measures  and \nfacilities  will  also  adopt  pollution  prevention \noccupational  health  and  safety  practices.  The  initial  environmental  examination  addresses  all \npotential environmental impacts and specifies adequate mitigation measures in accordance with \nthe  relevant  World  Bank  Group  guidelines  for  food  and  beverage  processing. 18 Information \ndisclosure  and  consultations  with  affected  people  are  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB \nrequirements.  The  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  of  Champion  Agro  to  manage  the \nproject\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed adequate. A corporate audit conducted \non  Champion  Agro\u2019s  current  operations  indicate  that  while  its  existing  facilities\u2019  operations  are \nnot pollution-intensive, some measures are needed to improve the management of agricultural \nwaste residues and treatment of generated wash water. Champion Agro has committed to adopt \nan  ESMS  including  a  corrective  action  plan  before  ADB\u2019s  first  disbursement.  Champion  Agro \nhas also committed to step up its institutional capability, engage a consultant at the initial stage \nto  implement  its  ESMS,  train  its  own  staff  to  implement  the  ESMS  agreed  on  with  ADB,  and \nsubmit annual monitoring reports to ADB.19 \n \n40.   ADB  will  ensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes  provisions  requiring \nChampion  Agro  to  comply  with national  labor  laws  and to  take  specific measures (including  in \nrelation to contractors) in line with internationally recognized core labor standards for the ADB-\nfinanced  portion  of  the  project,  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy. 20  No \nspecific  gender  measure  is  integrated  into  project  design,  so  it  is  classified  as  \u2015no  gender \nelements.\u2016  However,  the  project  does  not  cause  any  specific  cultural  or  social  impacts  or \nexclude any socioeconomic group, including women. \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy and Anti-Money-Laundering Policies \n\n41.   Champion Agro was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date), \nand  policy  relating  to  the  Combating  of  Money  Laundering,  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism \n(2003).  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB \nrequires Champion Agro to maintain and comply with internal procedures and controls following \ninternational  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  and  money-\nlaundering  activities  and  the  financing  of  terrorism  and  to  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities. \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations  \n\nThe  proposed  loan  is  within  the  medium-term,  country,  industry,  group,  and  single-\n\n42.  \nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD. \n\nAssurances \n\n43.   Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment  of  India\u2019s  no  objection  to  the  proposed  assistance  to  Champion  Agro  will  be \nobtained. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory \nto ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the Board of Directors. \n \n                                                      \n18 International  Finance  Corporation.  2007.
