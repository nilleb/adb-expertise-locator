I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof up to $50 million to Irrawaddy Towers Asset Holding (ITAH) and Irrawaddy Green Towers \n(IGT) for the Telecommunication Towers Infrastructure Project in Myanmar.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  Universal access to information and communication technology (ICT) is essential in \nfostering  a  country\u2019s  socioeconomic growth  by  improving  business  opportunities  and  trade \nfacilitation; reducing urban\u2013rural and gender gaps; and enhancing the delivery of public services \nsuch as health, education, and security. After decades of isolation, Myanmar remains one of the \npoorest  and  least-connected  countries  in  Southeast  Asia.  The  lack  of  investment  in  ICT \ninfrastructure is apparent in the low penetration level of telecommunication services. Because of \nthe lack of investment and competition, the cost of having a mobile connection was prohibitively \nexpensive for the average citizen. Further, although the largest share of the population lives in \nrural areas, the coverage was biased towards larger cities. A digital gender gap also exists in \nterms of access and usage of mobile phones and internet services. This disparity denies women \nthe significant benefits and opportunities from participating in today\u2019s global information society. \nAs part of its wide-ranging reforms, the Government of Myanmar has prioritized the availability, \naffordability, and quality of basic ICT infrastructure throughout the country to support inclusive \nsocioeconomic growth and poverty reduction. \n \n3.  With  assistance  provided  by  the  World  Bank,  the  government  has  embarked  on \nsignificant ICT sector reforms, including organizational restructuring of the incumbent operator \nand regulator, introduction of competition, and opening up of the sector to foreign investment. In \nFebruary 2014, following one of the most competitive international tenders with more than 90 \napplicants, the government awarded telecommunication operating and associated spectrum \nlicenses  to  Qatar\u2019s  Ooredoo  Group  and  Norway\u2019s  Telenor  Group.  Since  then,  the \ntelecommunication sector in Myanmar has undergone a transformation.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n4.  Myanmar has four major players in the tower market.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIGT is the market leader, having commissioned more than 2,000 towers by the end of the first \nquarter of 2016.  IGT is also the first independent tower company to receive orders from both \ninternational operators. \n \n5.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the International Finance Corporation identified \nthe  opportunity  to  provide  financial  assistance  to  help  IGT  roll  out  up  to  5,000  towers \n                                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. ", "2  \nnationwide. These towers are essential in enabling telecommunication operators to provide a \nfull range of mobile and data services in Myanmar. \n \n2.  Project Design \n6.  The project consists of rollout of up to 5,000 towers nationwide that are essential in \nenabling telecommunication operators to provide a full range of mobile and data services in \nMyanmar.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nBy  supporting  IGT\u2019s  rollout  of  tower  infrastructure,  the  project  will  help  expand \ntelecommunication services available to the public at affordable prices in both rural and urban \nareas of Myanmar. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n3.  The Borrowers and Sponsors \n7.  The borrowers will be ITAH, a company incorporated under the laws of Singapore, and \nits subsidiary IGT, a company incorporated under the laws of Myanmar, on a joint and several \nbasis. ITAH is a joint venture between M1 Group Limited and Alcazar Projects Limited; ITAH in \nturn owns 100% of IGT. IGT is the largest tower company in Myanmar with over 2,000 towers \ncommissioned by the end of the first quarter of 2016.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n8.  M1  Group  Limited,  registered  in  Dubai  International  Financial  Center,  is  a  holding \ncompany  with  interests  in  telecommunication,  real  estate,  aviation,  retail,  energy,  and \ntransportation.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n9.  Alcazar Projects Limited, registered in the Cayman Islands and wholly owned by the \nfamily of Maroun Semaan, was established to develop and invest in the tower business in \nMyanmar.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Output \n10.  Impact. The impact of the project will facilitate inclusive growth and poverty reduction \nthrough the development of required ICT infrastructure in Myanmar. The project will provide \nwider coverage and improve connectivity nationwide to help boost Myanmar\u2019s competiveness \nand broaden access to opportunities and services. Scaling up investments in telecommunication \ninfrastructure  will  (i)  improve  access  to  domestic  and  regional  markets,  (ii)  attract  private \ninvestment, (iii) reduce urban\u2013rural development gaps, and (iv) help Myanmar reap the full \npotential gains from regional connectivity and integration.  \n ", "  3\n11.  Outcome. The outcome will be increased private sector provision of affordable mobile \ntelecommunication services in Myanmar. \n \n12.   Output. The output will be the successful rollout of up to 5,000 telecommunication \ntowers nationwide in Myanmar. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n13.  Consistency  with  Strategy  2020. ADB\u2019s assistance for the project is aligned with \nADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020.2 The review reaffirmed ADB\u2019s support under Strategy \n2020 for infrastructure as one of the five core areas to improve and maximize development \nimpact.  The  midterm  review  also  supported  a  larger  role  for  private  sector  financing  of \ninfrastructure, investment in communication connectivity, and inclusive growth, especially for \nrural areas. \n \n14.  Consistency with country strategy. The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s interim country \npartnership strategy for Myanmar, 2012\u20132014, which has been extended through to 2016, and \nADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2016\u20132018. The project (i) addresses the critical \nshortage of connectivity, promotes access to markets and basic social services, (ii) improves \nrural  infrastructure  to  boost  productivity  and  incomes,  (iii)  lowers  transaction  costs,  (iv) \nenhances opportunities for domestic and cross-border trade and investment, and (v) improves \naccess to reliable and sustainable utility services.3 \n \nD.  Project Cost and Financing Plan \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  Table 5 summarizes the implementation arrangements.4 \n \nTable 5: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory  A  new  Telecommunication  Law  was  passed  in  October  2013,  which  fulfills  the  basic \nframework  elements of a liberalized telecommunication regulatory framework set out by the World \nTrade Organization. The Ministry of Transport and Communications has corporatized the \nstate-owned telecommunication operator, Myanma Posts and Telecommunications, into a \ncommercial entity. A fourth telecommunication operator license was awarded in March 2016 \nto a joint venture between 12 local entities and Viettel, a telecommunication operator from \nViet Nam. Viettel will own up to 49% of the joint venture. \nManagement  The project is managed by a joint venture between M1 Group and Alcazar Projects. IGT has \na  track  record  of  successful  operation  in  Myanmar  with  more  than  2,000  towers \ncommissioned by the end of the first quarter of 2016, becoming the largest tower company \nin the country. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \nImplementation  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n                                                                 \n2  ADB. 2014.

Construction of telecommunication towers consists of three \nmain parts: civil works, tower infrastructure, and power solutions.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIn commissioning more than 2,000 towers by the end of the first quarter of 2016, IGT built up \na strong network of suppliers across the value chain that will enable it to roll out new towers \nrapidly in a cost-effective manner. \nOperations arrangements \nRevenue  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \nstructure \nMajor cost  Major costs include O&M costs related to maintenance and repair of the towers, fuel \nstructure  delivery, and site leases. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \nPerformance  The borrowers will submit quarterly unaudited financial statements and annual audited \nmonitoring  financial statements on a consolidated basis. \nIGT = Irrawaddy Green Towers, O&M = operation and maintenance. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Irrawaddy Green Towers. \n \nF.  Projected Financial and Economic Performance \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n25.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  will  support  the  government\u2019s  reforms  and  the  country\u2019s  overall \ntransformation into a more liberalized economy by providing financial assistance to the country\u2019s \nleading  tower  company  to  roll  out  essential  infrastructure.  Multilateral  support  is  needed \nbecause of the capital intensive nature of constructing telecommunication towers and the lack of \ninternational banks willing to lend into Myanmar. \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s substantial participation will have strong demonstration impact to multinational \nand international financiers that infrastructure investments led by the private sector can be \nundertaken successfully and sustained in Myanmar in sectors that implement sound legal and \nregulatory  frameworks  and/or  are  founded  on  the  principles  of  transparency  and  market \ncompetition, and will catalyze private sector investment into the telecommunication sector in \nMyanmar.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n ", "  5\n27.  Through the administration of technical assistance Renewable Energy for Nationwide \nTelecommunications  Project,  ADB  will  provide  guidance  on  the  many  challenges  of \ntelecommunication tower rollout in Myanmar, such as electricity shortages. 5 This will help tower \ncompanies and other industry stakeholders reduce reliance on diesel generation by adopting \nrenewable  energy  technology,  and  strengthen  environmental  and  social  regulation  through \napplication of ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and promotion of best practices.  \n \nC.  Risks \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n33.  The project is classified category B for the environment and category C for involuntary \nresettlement and indigenous peoples impacts, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \nThe  potential  environmental  and  social  impacts  of the  borrowers\u2019  tower  rollout  have  been \nidentified and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse \nimpacts will be incorporated in the environmental and social management system.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n34.  IGT applies environmental and social site selection criteria to avoid ecologically sensitive \nhabitats, legally protected areas, cultural heritage sites, and lands with traditional or customary \nrights. All necessary government permits and approvals are secured before tower erection, \naccompanied by neighbors\u2019 consent and a letter of support from the community as proof of \nsocial acceptability. Information disclosure and consultations will be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements. \n \n35.  Involuntary resettlement and land acquisition impacts are not triggered as all sites for \nIGT\u2019s facilities will be on leased lands, and all negotiations for the leasing of private lands are \ndone on commercially acceptable terms. Although Myanmar has various ethnic groups across \nthe country, the construction and operation of the telecommunication towers are not expected to \nresult in the transformation, encroachment, or degradation of indigenous community lands.  \n \n36.   IGT\u2019s  human  resources  policy  and  procedures  contain  nondiscrimination  and  equal \nopportunity  conditions  to  avoid  bias  based  on  gender,  health,  disability,  race,  or  religion. \nCompensation, disciplinary, and grievance procedures for IGT\u2019s employees are also included. \nIGT requires its contractors to comply with national labor laws and prevent the use of underage \nlabor  by  construction  contractors  and  their  subcontractors.  The  environmental  and  social \ncompliance audit recommends the development of procedures to monitor work practices of IGT \nand its contractors, consistent with the requirements of ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy.6 \n \n                                                                 \n5  ADB. 2015.
