After decades of isolation, Myanmar remains one of the \npoorest  and  least-connected  countries  in  Southeast  Asia.  The  lack  of  investment  in  ICT \ninfrastructure is apparent in the low penetration level of telecommunication services. Because of \nthe lack of investment and competition, the cost of having a mobile connection was prohibitively \nexpensive for the average citizen. Further, although the largest share of the population lives in \nrural  areas, the  coverage  was  biased  towards  larger  cities.  A  digital gender gap  also  exists  in \nterms of access and usage of mobile phones and internet services. This disparity denies women \nthe significant benefits and opportunities from participating in today\u2019s global information society. \nAs part of its wide-ranging reforms, the Government of Myanmar has prioritized the availability, \naffordability,  and quality  of  basic ICT  infrastructure  throughout the  country  to  support  inclusive \nsocioeconomic growth and poverty reduction. \n \n3. \nWith  assistance  provided  by  the  World  Bank,  the  government  has  embarked  on \nsignificant ICT  sector reforms,  including  organizational  restructuring  of the  incumbent  operator \nand regulator, introduction of competition, and opening up of the sector to foreign investment. In \nFebruary  2014,  following  one  of  the  most  competitive  international  tenders  with  more  than  90 \napplicants,  the  government  awarded  telecommunication  operating  and  associated  spectrum \nthe \nto  Qatar\u2019s  Ooredoo  Group  and  Norway\u2019s  Telenor  Group.  Since \nlicenses \ntelecommunication sector in Myanmar has undergone a transformation.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n4. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIGT is the market leader, having commissioned more than 2,000 towers by the end of the first \nquarter  of 2016.   IGT  is also  the first  independent tower  company  to receive  orders from  both \ninternational operators. \n \n5. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the International Finance Corporation identified \nthe  opportunity  to  provide  financial  assistance  to  help  IGT  roll  out  up  to  5,000  towers \n\nMyanmar has four major players in the tower market.  \n\nthen, \n\n                                                                  \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n\f 2\n\nnationwide.  These  towers  are  essential  in  enabling  telecommunication  operators  to  provide  a \nfull range of mobile and data services in Myanmar. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n6. \nThe  project  consists  of  rollout  of  up  to  5,000  towers  nationwide  that  are  essential  in \nenabling  telecommunication  operators  to  provide  a  full  range  of  mobile  and  data  services  in \nMyanmar.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nBy  supporting \nthe  project  will  help  expand \ntelecommunication services  available  to the  public  at  affordable  prices  in  both rural  and  urban \nareas of Myanmar. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n\ninfrastructure, \n\nrollout  of \n\ntower \n\nIGT\u2019s \n\n3. \n\nThe Borrowers and Sponsors \n\n7. \nThe borrowers will be ITAH, a company incorporated under the laws of Singapore, and \nits subsidiary IGT, a company incorporated under the laws of Myanmar, on a joint and several \nbasis. ITAH is a joint venture between M1 Group Limited and Alcazar Projects Limited; ITAH in \nturn owns 100% of IGT. IGT is the largest tower company in Myanmar with over 2,000 towers \ncommissioned by the end of the first quarter of 2016.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n8. \nM1  Group  Limited,  registered  in  Dubai  International  Financial  Center,  is  a  holding \ncompany  with  interests  in  telecommunication,  real  estate,  aviation,  retail,  energy,  and \ntransportation.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n9. \nAlcazar  Projects  Limited,  registered  in  the  Cayman  Islands  and  wholly  owned  by  the \nfamily  of  Maroun  Semaan,  was  established  to  develop  and  invest  in  the  tower  business  in \nMyanmar.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Output \n\n10. \nImpact.  The  impact  of  the  project  will  facilitate  inclusive  growth  and  poverty  reduction \nthrough  the  development  of  required  ICT  infrastructure  in  Myanmar.  The  project  will  provide \nwider  coverage  and  improve  connectivity  nationwide  to  help  boost  Myanmar\u2019s  competiveness \nand broaden access to opportunities and services. Scaling up investments in telecommunication \ninfrastructure  will  (i)  improve  access  to  domestic  and  regional  markets,  (ii)  attract  private \ninvestment,  (iii)  reduce  urban\u2013rural  development  gaps,  and  (iv)  help  Myanmar  reap  the  full \npotential gains from regional connectivity and integration.  \n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nOutcome.  The  outcome  will  be  increased  private  sector  provision  of  affordable  mobile \n\n11. \ntelecommunication services in Myanmar. \n \n12.   Output.  The  output  will  be  the  successful  rollout  of  up  to  5,000  telecommunication \ntowers nationwide in Myanmar. \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\nConsistency  with  Strategy  2020.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  for  the  project  is  aligned  with \n13. \nADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020.2 The review reaffirmed ADB\u2019s support under Strategy \n2020  for  infrastructure  as  one  of  the  five  core  areas  to  improve  and  maximize  development \nimpact.  The  midterm  review  also  supported  a  larger  role  for  private  sector  financing  of \ninfrastructure,  investment  in  communication  connectivity,  and  inclusive  growth,  especially  for \nrural areas. \n \n14. \nConsistency  with  country  strategy.  The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s interim country \npartnership strategy for Myanmar, 2012\u20132014, which has been extended through to 2016, and \nADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan,  2016\u20132018.  The  project  (i)  addresses  the  critical \nshortage  of  connectivity,  promotes  access  to  markets  and  basic  social  services,  (ii)  improves \nrural  infrastructure  to  boost  productivity  and  incomes,  (iii)  lowers  transaction  costs,  (iv) \nenhances  opportunities for  domestic  and  cross-border trade  and  investment,  and (v)  improves \naccess to reliable and sustainable utility services.3 \n \nD. \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTable 5 summarizes the implementation arrangements.4 \n\n22. \n \n\nTable 5: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \n\nManagement \n\nAspects \nRegulatory \nframework \n\nArrangements \nA  new  Telecommunication  Law  was  passed  in  October  2013,  which  fulfills  the  basic \nelements  of  a  liberalized  telecommunication  regulatory  framework  set  out  by  the  World \nTrade  Organization.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications  has  corporatized  the \nstate-owned  telecommunication  operator,  Myanma  Posts  and  Telecommunications,  into  a \ncommercial entity. A fourth telecommunication operator license was awarded in March 2016 \nto a joint venture between  12  local  entities and Viettel,  a telecommunication operator from \nViet Nam. Viettel will own up to 49% of the joint venture. \nThe project is managed by a joint venture between M1 Group and Alcazar Projects.

Construction of telecommunication towers consists of three \nmain parts: civil works, tower infrastructure, and power solutions.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIn commissioning more than 2,000 towers by the end of the first quarter of 2016, IGT built up \na strong network of suppliers across the value chain that will enable it to roll out new towers \nrapidly in a cost-effective manner. \n\nOperations arrangements \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\nRevenue \nstructure \nMajor cost \nstructure \n\nMajor costs include O&M costs related to maintenance and repair of the towers, fuel \ndelivery, and site leases. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \nThe borrowers will submit quarterly unaudited financial statements and annual audited \nPerformance \nmonitoring \nfinancial statements on a consolidated basis. \nIGT = Irrawaddy Green Towers, O&M = operation and maintenance. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Irrawaddy Green Towers. \n \nF. \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n25. \nADB\u2019s  assistance  will  support  the  government\u2019s  reforms  and  the  country\u2019s  overall \ntransformation into a more liberalized economy by providing financial assistance to the country\u2019s \nleading  tower  company  to  roll  out  essential  infrastructure.  Multilateral  support  is  needed \nbecause of the capital intensive nature of constructing telecommunication towers and the lack of \ninternational banks willing to lend into Myanmar. \n \n26. \nADB\u2019s  substantial  participation  will  have  strong  demonstration  impact  to  multinational \nand  international  financiers  that  infrastructure  investments  led  by  the  private  sector  can  be \nundertaken  successfully  and  sustained  in  Myanmar  in  sectors that  implement  sound  legal  and \nregulatory  frameworks  and/or  are  founded  on  the  principles  of  transparency  and  market \ncompetition,  and  will  catalyze  private  sector  investment  into  the  telecommunication  sector  in \nMyanmar.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nThrough  the  administration  of  technical  assistance  Renewable  Energy  for  Nationwide \n27. \nTelecommunications  Project,  ADB  will  provide  guidance  on \nthe  many  challenges  of \ntelecommunication tower rollout in Myanmar, such as electricity shortages. 5 This will help tower \ncompanies  and  other  industry  stakeholders  reduce  reliance  on  diesel  generation  by  adopting \nrenewable  energy  technology,  and  strengthen  environmental  and  social  regulation  through \napplication of ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and promotion of best practices.  \n \nC. \n\nRisks \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nThe  project  is  classified category  B for the  environment  and  category  C for  involuntary \n33. \nresettlement and indigenous peoples impacts, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \nThe  potential  environmental  and  social  impacts  of  the  borrowers\u2019  tower  rollout  have  been \nidentified and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse \nimpacts will be incorporated in the environmental and social management system.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIGT applies environmental and social site selection criteria to avoid ecologically sensitive \n34. \nhabitats, legally protected areas, cultural heritage sites, and lands with traditional or customary \nrights.  All  necessary  government  permits  and  approvals  are  secured  before  tower  erection, \naccompanied  by  neighbors\u2019  consent  and  a  letter  of  support  from  the  community  as  proof  of \nsocial  acceptability.  Information  disclosure  and  consultations  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements. \n \n35. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  and  land  acquisition  impacts  are  not  triggered  as  all  sites  for \nIGT\u2019s facilities will be on leased lands, and all negotiations for the leasing of private lands are \ndone  on  commercially  acceptable terms.  Although  Myanmar  has  various  ethnic groups  across \nthe country, the construction and operation of the telecommunication towers are not expected to \nresult in the transformation, encroachment, or degradation of indigenous community lands.  \n \n36.  \nIGT\u2019s  human  resources  policy  and  procedures  contain  nondiscrimination  and  equal \nopportunity  conditions  to  avoid  bias  based  on  gender,  health,  disability,  race,  or  religion. \nCompensation,  disciplinary,  and  grievance  procedures  for  IGT\u2019s  employees  are  also  included. \nIGT requires its contractors to comply with national labor laws and prevent the use of underage \nlabor  by  construction  contractors  and  their  subcontractors.  The  environmental  and  social \ncompliance audit recommends the development of procedures to monitor work practices of IGT \nand its contractors, consistent with the requirements of ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy.6 \n \n\n                                                                  \n5  ADB.  2015.
