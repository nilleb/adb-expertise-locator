Developing public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) for these projects will be a priority. The \nfacility will have two components. Component A will involve preparation of the Sun Koshi 2, Sun \nKoshi  3,  and  Dudh  Koshi  hydropower  projects,  and  a  second  400-kilovolt  transmission  line \nacross  Nepal\u2019s  border  with  India.  Project  implementation  consultants  (PICs)  and  a  panel  of \nexperts  will  also  be  provided  under  component A.  Under  component  B, the facility  will  provide \nPPP  project  development  services  for  a  hydropower  project  that  will  focus  on  the  export  of \nenergy.1 By  preparing  several  candidate  projects,  the  facility  will  help  reduce  the  processing \ntime of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for potential ensuing investments.2  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nSector  overview.  Nepal  has  theoretical  potential  hydropower  capacity  of  83,000 \n3. \nmegawatts (MW), 42,000 MW of which is considered economically feasible to develop.3 Making \nfull  use  of  its  hydropower  potential  can  transform  Nepal  economically.  Poor  planning,  weak \nregulations, ineffective institutions and legal frameworks, and a very poor tariff regime have held \nback investments, limited the role of the private sector, and left the country unable to properly \ntap  this  vast  hydropower  resource.  As  a  result,  it  experiences  acute  shortages  of  power. \nDemand  for  electricity  increased  by  46%  from  2007  to  2011,  while  installed  capacity  rose  by \nonly 16%. Of total installed capacity of 719 MW in 2012, hydropower accounted for 660 MW, or \nonly 1.6% of the full, economically feasible potential.  \n \n4. \nWhile  access  to  electricity  has  increased  during  2007  to  2011  to  reach  49%  of  rural \nhouseholds and 56% across the country, power is available only 10\u201312 hours a day. Per capita \nelectricity  consumption  is  only  102  kilowatt-hours  a  year,  the  lowest  in  South  Asia.  Peak \ndemand  on  the  integrated  national  power  system  exceeds  1,000  MW,  resulting  in  a  supply \ndeficit of about 460 MW during peak time. Because the country lacks hydropower plants that are \npowered  by  water  stored  in  dam  reservoirs  to  provide  regulated  output  through  the  year,  the \npower  deficit  is  especially  severe  during  the  dry  season,  when  its  run-of-river  plants  run  at \nreduced  output  due  to  low  natural  river  water  levels  and  flows.  Power  demand  in  Nepal  is \ngrowing by an average 10% a year or the equivalent of 100 MW annually. A study by the Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency (JICA) estimated that national demand could reach 4,279 MW \nin  2032.4   People and  businesses  are badly  affected  by this  power  crisis, which calls for  rapid \ndevelopment of Nepal\u2019s hydropower potential to meet its current and future energy needs. \n \n5. \nThe  current  inadequacy  and  unreliability  of  the  power  supply  result  from  a  low  level  of \ninvestments in the past. Ongoing weakness in strategic, operational, managerial, and financial \n\n                                                \n1  The government in consultation with ADB will select a suitable hydropower project for development under PPP.  \n2  The facility was prepared without project preparatory technical assistance. \n3  H. M. Shrestha. 1966. Cadastre of Potential Water Power Resources of Less Studied High Mountainous Regions, \n\nwith Special Reference to Nepal. Moscow Power Institute.  \n\n4   JICA,  2013.  Interim  Report on  National  Master  Plan  Study  on  Storage-type  Hydroelectric  Power  Development  in \n\nNepal. \n\n\f2 \n\nStrategic  framework.  The  government  has  prepared  a  10-year  roadmap \n\npolicies aggravated the problem. An uneconomic tariff regime dents the financial standing of the \nNepal  Electricity  Authority  (NEA),  the  power  sector\u2019s  only  utility,  leaving  it  unable  to  cover  its \nnew  capital  investments  as  well  as  the  current  operation  and  maintenance  costs.  The \ngovernment  lacks  the  financial  means  and  institutional  capacity  to  resolve  the  energy  crisis \nalone, and if the private sector is to play a bigger role, it needs more and better entry points for \ninvestment.  In  addition  to  building  greater  generation  capacity,  Nepal  must  also  upgrade  and \nexpand its limited transmission and distribution networks. A major obstacle to exploiting Nepal\u2019s \nhydropower  export  potential  is  the shortage  of  adequate  infrastructure  to  transmit  electricity  to \nneighboring  India.  Instead  of  exporting  power,  in  fact,  Nepal  imports  it  from  India,  despite  the \nfact  that  its  neighbor  is  also  facing  acute  power  shortages.5 Developing  Nepal\u2019s  hydropower \ngeneration, transmission, and export infrastructure would benefit both countries. In 2012, India \nhad a peak power deficit of 17,517 MW, or 12.9% of the total national demand. Northern India, \nwhich is the most practical destination for Nepal\u2019s potential power exports, already experiences \na power deficit of 11.9% (4,860 MW) of regional demand, and this gap is growing.  \n \n6. \nfor \nhydropower  development  during  2009\u20132019,  with  the  aim  of  generating  an  additional  10,000 \nMW of hydropower. Nepal needs to develop large-scale reservoir hydropower projects to meet \nthis target but has been unable so far to attract private investment for such undertakings. Some \nprivate  capital  has  gone  instead  into  run-of-river  generation  projects  owned  by  independent \npower producers and oriented toward the domestic market.6 \n \n7. \nIncreasing  private  sector  investment  in  Nepal\u2019s  power  infrastructure  will  need  a  robust \npro-investment policy regime with strong political commitments by the government and credible \noff-takers, which in turn can bring prospective developers and third party financiers. High-quality \ntechnical due diligence will be needed to attract serious investors and financiers. Because the \ngovernment  is  unable  to  provide  this  on  its  own,  ADB  will  provide  support  for  technical  due \ndiligence under the facility and may also play the strategic role of an honest broker by facilitating \npublic\u2013private  dialogue  to  remove  impediments  to  private  sector  investments.  The  facility  will \nsupport  preparation  of  hydropower  and  transmission  projects  for  development,  including  the \npreparation  of  a  flagship  PPP  hydropower  project  with  potential  for  exporting  hydropower  to \nIndia and to serve as a potential model for future similar PPP and export projects. This project \ncan  be  developed  under  the  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation  program,  which \nendorsed several regional cooperation initiatives at its general meeting on 9 November 2012 in \nThimphu,  Bhutan,  including  feasibility  studies  of  large-scale  hydropower  plants  and  related \ntransmission facilities  in Nepal for  implementation  during  2013\u20132014. The facility  will  therefore \nsupport ADB\u2019s regional cooperation and integration agenda and targets. \n \n8. \nEnergy was one of the priorities of ADB\u2019s Nepal country partnership strategy for 2010\u2013\n2012.7 Energy  is  expected  to  remain  a  principal  area  of  ADB  activity  in  Nepal  under  a  new \nstrategy  being  prepared  for  2013\u20132017.  The  facility  is  designed  to  support  the  new  strategy\u2019s \ngoals. The development of large hydropower projects and the related transmission infrastructure \nto  be  supported  by  the  facility,  along  with  its  emphasis  on  private  sector  participation  and \nregional integration, will increase access to commercial energy and cross-border energy trade. \nThis will help achieve inclusive growth and sustainable development in the country. Accordingly, \nADB\u2019s 2015 assistance pipeline to Nepal includes a PPP hydropower development project.  \n                                                \n5  Imports from India have been growing and reached 746 gigawatt-hours in 2012, or 18% of Nepal\u2019s total electricity \n\n6  These include the Khimti (60 MW), Bhote Koshi (36 MW), and Chilime (22 MW) power plants. Independent power \n\nproducers contributed about 28% of the total available electricity supply in 2011. \n\n7  ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: Nepal, 2010\u20132012. Manila. \n\nsupply. \n\n \n\n\f \n9. \nADB  has  been  a  longstanding  partner  in  Nepal\u2019s  power  sector.  Its  assistance  has \nfocused  on  generation,  transmission,  distribution,  rural  electrification,  and  mini-hydropower \nprojects  for  domestic  requirements.  ADB,  together  with  the  JICA,  financed  Nepal\u2019s  largest \nhydropower  project,  the  144  MW  Kali  Gandaki  \u201cA\u201d  plant  commissioned  in  2002.  With \nconfinancing  by  the  Government  of  Norway,  ADB  has  also  supported  the  strengthening  of \ntransmission  and  network  infrastructure  to  deliver  hydropower  to  Kathmandu.8   In  2013,  ADB \ncofinanced  the  $500  million  140  MW  Tanahu  reservoir  hydropower  project  which  will  be  in \noperation by 2020.9 \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\nB. \n\nThe impact of the facility will be developed infrastructure for hydropower. The outcome \n10. \nwill  be  provision  of  high  quality  due  diligence  to  support  investments  to  transform  the  power \nsector.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs  \n\nThe facility will have two outputs.  \n\n11. \n \n12. \nthrough the facility\u2019s component A and will include the following: \n\nOutput  1:  Feasibility  and  detailed  engineering  studies.

The DOED will set up a project management unit (PMU) headed by a \nfull-time  project  manager.  The  PICs  will  be  recruited  to  support  project  procurement, \nsupervision,  and  reporting  activities  during  implementation.  The  PICs  will  report  to  both  ADB \nand  the  PMU.  Two  panels  of  experts  will  be  recruited  to  provide  dam  engineering  and  safety \nservices  and  advise  on  environmental  and  social  safeguard  issues.  The  PMU  will  be \nresponsible for the overall coordination of the activities under both project components and will \nsupervise  the  outputs  of  the  PICs  and  the  panels  of  experts.  The  PMU  in  DOED  will  also  be \nresponsible for implementation with respect to the Sun Koshi 2 and Sun Koshi 3 projects under \ncomponent A, and the existing Project Implementation Unit (PIU) in NEA will be responsible for \nimplementing  the  component  A  activities  involving  the  Dudh  Koshi  project  and  the  second \ncross-border transmission line.

Component  A  will  require  inputs  of  five  consulting  service  packages, \n17. \nincluding one for the PICs and one for the panels of experts. To fast-track implementation, the \ngovernment has asked ADB to assist the PMU in the selection and recruitment of the PICs. This \nwill in turn help the PMU procure the other consulting services required for component A. ADB \nwill only select the consultant, and the EA retains the responsibility for negotiating and signing \nthe contract with the consultant, issuing the notice to proceed, and supervising the consultant\u2019s \nservices.  Consulting  service  requirements  for  component  B  cannot  be  assessed  until  the \ngovernment has selected a proposed project for PPP development in consultation with ADB.11 \nThe PPP project development services will support due diligence (technical, financial, and legal) \nand advisory services for preparation of the flagship export-oriented PPP hydropower project up \nto  signing  of  a  concession  agreement.  ADB  may  play  a  strategic  role  of  an  honest  broker  by \nfacilitating public\u2013private dialogue and to remove impediments to private sector investments. All \nprocurement activities will be carried out in accordance with ADB Procurement Guidelines (2013, \nas amended from time to time), and consultants will be recruited using quality- and cost-based \nselection with a 90:10 ratio, in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended from time to time).  \n \n18. \nadequate budgetary allocation of counterpart funds for timely completion. \n\nThe facility will be used over a 5-year period (2013\u20132018). The government will ensure \n\n                                                \n10 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 It is envisaged that the selection process for the PPP project will take longer than 18 months. Procurement details \n\nfor component B are therefore not included in the facility\u2019s first procurement plan.  \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n\n19. \n Output  1:  Feasibility  and  detailed  engineering  studies  carried  out.  Project \nscreening consultants have been engaged for screening candidate hydropower projects for the \nfeasibility and detailed engineering studies under component A. The consultants have submitted \ntheir recommendations based on engineering, environmental, and social due diligence. The due \ndiligence methodology included reviews of desk studies of the latest project-related reports and \nexisting  secondary  data;  the  government's  hydropower,  water  resources,  and  river  basin \ndevelopment  reports  and  policies;  the  legal  and  administrative  framework  for  the  projects; \ngeographical maps; and data collected from sample site surveys.  \n \n20. \nThe facility  will  support  due  diligence  on the  short-listed  projects. The work  will  involve \nstandard feasibility-related matters. It will also include active engineering work for  projects that \ndemonstrate  a  high  possibility  of  success.  The  other  areas  of  due  diligence  to  be  undertaken \nthrough the facility will include examination of factors related to hydrology, geology, the risks of \nglacial  lake  outburst  floods,  geotechnical  and  seismic  risks  at  the  project  sites,  potential \nenvironmental and social impacts, and the costs and economics of the projects.  \n \n21. \nThe  project  screening  consultants  have  shortlisted  from  among  the  candidate  projects \nthe  Sun  Koshi  2  and  Sun  Koshi  3  projects  for  feasibility,  and  Dudh  Koshi  project  for  detailed \nengineering studies (para.12 [i] and [ii]). They are also priorities of the government. Further pre-\nfeasibility and key stakeholders consultation will be conducted on the projects under para 12 (i).  \n \n22. \nFeasibility  and  detailed  engineering  studies  of  hydropower  projects,  particularly  those \npowered from dam reservoirs, are challenging. The services from two panels of experts, one for \nengineering  and  dam  safety  (the  dam  safety  panel)  and  one  for  social  and  environmental \naspects  (the  social  and  environmental  panel),  will  be  engaged  to  review  the  reports  at  each \nmilestone  during  the  feasibility,  environmental  impact,  and  detailed  engineering  studies  of  the \nselected  hydropower  projects.  The  dam  safety  panel  will  comprise  international  experts  in  the \nfields  of  dam  engineering  and  design,  hydrology  (for  mountainous  regions),  and  geology  and \ngeotechnical  engineering.  The  social  and  environmental  panel  will  comprise  national  or \ninternational  experts  with  specific  experience  related  to  the  impacts  of  large  dams  on \npopulations, resettlement, and the environment.  \n\n \n23. \nOutput  2: Public\u2013private  partnership  project  development  services  provided. The \ngovernment will identify and nominate a PPP hydropower project, in consultation with ADB. The \npreparation  of  the  PPP  hydropower  project  under  component  B  will  require  the  consultants\u2019 \ninputs  on  the  project\u2019s  technical  (including  environmental  and  social),  financial,  legal,  and \ncommercial aspects. The facility will also provide assistance in structuring the PPP hydropower \nproject, developing a concession agreement, and undertaking road shows to generate investor \ninterest.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n24. \nThe  economic  viability  of  all  projects  to  be  prepared  by  the  facility  will  be  assessed  in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects.12 This  will  include \n\n                                                \n12 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n\fassessment  of  the  economic  life  of  the  projects  and  identification  of  the  economic  benefits  of \neach  investment,  comparing  with-  and  without-project  situations.  The  financial  analysis  of  all \nsuch  projects  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial \nGovernance  and  Management  of  Investment  Projects  Financed  by  ADB.13   This  will  include \ncalculating  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  overall  investment  and  establishing \nfinancial viability by comparing the financial internal rate of return with the cost of capital, taking \ninto account financial costs and benefits.  \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n25. \nA financial management assessment of the executing agency conducted during the due \ndiligence  has  noted  that  the  DOED's  internal  audit  is  weak  and  needs  strengthening. 14 To \nmitigate  the  risks  posed  by  this  weakness,  the  facility  will  engage  a finance  expert  in  the  PIC \nteam to provide support for monitoring and reporting on the accounting and fiduciary aspects of \nfacility  implementation.  The  PIUs  will  have  assigned  accountants  for  project.  During  project \nimplementation  the  facility  will  provide  capacity  development  training  to  key    DOED  and  NEA \nfinance  and  accounts  staff  on  financial  accounting  and  project  auditing,  monitoring,  and \nreporting. This arrangement, supplemented by an audit conducted by the government\u2019s District \nTreasury Control Office, is considered an adequate mitigating measure.  The government does \nnot have experience in preparing PPP projects. The facility\u2019s PPP project development services \nwill  therefore  assist  the  government  in  structuring  an  export-oriented  hydropower  project  on  a \nPPP basis. \n \n26. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  the  DOED,  and  the  NEA.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual.  \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\n27. \nThe facility will involve feasibility studies of hydropower and power transmission projects, \nwith a focus on private sector participation and subregional power trading. It is not expected to \nhave  a  direct  impact  on poverty  and/or  social  issues. The  projects that  will  be  prepared  under \nthe  facility  may  have  such  impacts,  however.  They  will  therefore  be  designed  following  the \nGuidelines  for  Gender  Mainstreaming  Categories  of  ADB  Projects  and  the  Handbook  on \nPoverty  and  Social  Analysis \nreduction  opportunities,  gender \nmainstreaming, and due regard for social concerns, such as the spread of HIV/AIDS and other \ncommunicable diseases, compliance with core labor standards, social conflicts, and unplanned \nmigration.15 \n \n28. \nEnsuing projects will also be prepared in compliance with ADB's Policy on Gender and \nDevelopment  (1998)  and  ADB's  Handbook  on  Social  Analysis 16.    Gender,  consultation  and \nparticipation,  labor,  and  other  social  issues  will  also  be  examined  during  preparation  of  such \nprojects, and mitigation plans will be prepared to address the assessed risks. A gender equality \nand  social  inclusion  action  framework  was  prepared  to  ensure  responsiveness  in  projects \n\nincorporate  poverty \n\nto \n\n                                                \n13 ADB. 2005.

It  will  be  applied  as  a  guideline  in  the  development  of  an  action  plan \nduring  project  preparation.  Based  on  the  guidelines,  gender  and  social  analysis  for  these \nprojects  will  be  undertaken  to  determine  how  women  and traditionally  excluded  groups will  be \naffected. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n29. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  facility  is  classified \nunder  category  C  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  The \ninvestment projects that will be developed following the feasibility studies will be categorized in \naccordance  with  the  requirements  of  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  to  determine  the \nsignificance of potential impacts.  \n \n30. \nThe facility will study hydropower development projects that depend on dam reservoirs. \nThese  projects  could  require  the  displacement  of  people  in  areas  to  be  inundated  for  water \nstorage. Those affected could include indigenous peoples whose livelihoods depend on natural \nresources in areas that may be flooded. The cross-border transmission line that the facility will \nstudy  could  also  involve  displacement  and  land  acquisition  for  the  construction  of  substations \nand tower footings.  \n \nTo  ensure  that  environmental  and social  safeguards  are applied  in  all  of the  projects  it \n31. \nprepares, an environmental assessment and review framework, a resettlement framework, and \nan  indigenous  peoples  planning  framework  are  designed  for  the  facility.17   Each  project  to  be \nprepared  by the facility  will  be  subject to  environmental  and  social  screening  to  avoid adverse \nimpacts, such as encroachment on habitats critical to biodiversity and on ecologically sensitive \nprotected  areas,  areas  important  to  indigenous  peoples,  sites  of  historical  and  cultural  value, \nand areas vulnerable to such hazards as landslides and floods. Given the potential impacts, a \nresettlement  plan  and  an  indigenous  peoples  plan  will  be  prepared  under  the  feasibility  and \ndetailed  engineering  studies  during  facility  implementation  based  on  the  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement and relevant national laws and regulations. The resettlement plan and the indigenous \npeoples plan will be revised and/or updated during the project financing stage. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n32.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  in  Table  4  and  described  in  detail  in  the  risk \nassessment and risk management plan.18  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                \n17 Environmental  Assessment  and  Review  Framework;  Resettlement  Framework;  Indigenous  Peoples  Planning \n\nFramework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n18 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nRisks \nCandidate projects could  be vulnerable \nto  natural  disaster  and  climate  change \nissues. \n\nManagement Plan or Measures \nA  preliminary  disaster  and  climate  change  screening  will  be \nconducted to assess the exposure of the candidate projects to \nclimate-induced risk and natural disasters. \n \nDuring  the  feasibility  and  detailed  engineering  studies  and  the \ndesign of the hydropower projects, consultants will be engaged \nto look into these risks through  due  diligence  on such aspects \nas  hydrology,  geology,  the  risk  of  glacial  lake  outburst  floods, \nand the geotechnical and seismic risks of the project site. \n \nThe project design will be undertaken based on the basin-wide \nwater resource. \nProject  implementation  support  consultants  (PICs)  will  be \nrecruited  to  help  the  Department  of  Electricity  Development \n(DOED)  and  the  Nepal  Electricity  Authority  (NEA)  implement \nand  monitor  project  activities.  ADB  will  support  the  timely \nrecruitment of consultants. \nThe facility design provides for strong involvement by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in the recruitment of consultants.  \nManagement  and  capacity-building  support  will  be  provided  to \nthe DOED and the NEA to assist in supervising and monitoring \nof the outputs. \nTwo panel of experts\u2014one for dam safety and engineering and \nthe other for safeguards\u2014will help ensure the quality of works. \n\nCapacity  deficiencies  could  delay  the \nstart-up of facility implementation. \n\nissues \n\nCapacity \ncompletion,  as  could  procurement  of \nsubstandard consulting services.  \n\ncould \n\ndelay   \n\nLack  of  capacity  for  PPP  projects  may \ncause  delay \nin  PPP  development \nprocess. \n\nSubject to the PPP project development due diligence, advisory \nservices  will  be  provided \nflagship \nhydropower project. \n\nto  structure  a  PPP \n\ninterference  and  corruption \nthe  procurement  and \n\nPolitical \ncould  affect \nproject selection. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, DOED = Department of Electricity Development, MOE = Ministry of Energy, NEA = \nNepal Electricity Authority, PIC = project implementation support consultant, PPP = public\u2013private partnership.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank \n \n \n\nThe  project  steering  committee  will  have  representatives  from \nthe NEA, the DOED, the Ministry of Energy and ADB, and will \nensure the transparency of processes. \n\nIV.
