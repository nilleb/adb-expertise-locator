Role of Mezzanine Finance and Its Demand in Asia \n1.  Role of Mezzanine Financing in the Economy \n2.  As with other forms of financing, mezzanine satisfies a specific risk-return demand for \ninvestors and investee companies. It represents a financing layer that typically sits between \nequity and senior debt in the capital structure of a company or project in terms of seniority \n(Figure  1),  and  is  a  long-term  source  of  generally  unsecured  but  amortizing  risk  capital. \nMezzanine financing has fixed income-style performance characteristics, in the form of current \ninterest  income.  In  addition,  it  typically  includes  equity  upside  features,  such  as  warrants, \nconvertibility rights, or profit participation rights. Mezzanine debt usually is structured as a \nsubordinated  loan  with  a  bullet  repayment  after  7\u201310  years.  Because  the  principal  under \nmezzanine financing largely is repaid as a bullet, investee companies benefit from access to \nadditional free cash flows for organic growth.1  \n \n \n \nFigure 1: Capital Structure of \nFinancial Instruments by Seniority \n \nSenior  Debt \n \n  \nSubordinated Debt  \n \n \n \n \nSubordinat ed Debt  Mezzanine  \nwith warrants or \n  Finance\nconversion rights \n \n \n \nRedeem able \nPreferred  Equity \n \n \n \nEqui ty  \n \n \n \n        Source: Private Equity International. 2004.  \n        The Guide to Private Equity Fund Investment Due Diligence.

Mezzanine has advantages in some situations, precisely because it is between pure \ndebt and equity. Growth companies that need expansion capital often lack a broad base of fixed \nassets or receivables that banks require to lend senior debt. Such companies also might not \nhave a history of positive cash flow that is long enough to persuade a senior lender to provide \ncash flow-based financing. In these situations, mezzanine has the advantage of supporting the \nbalance sheet by providing an external source of financing, without diluting the equity stakes of \nthe  owners  of  the company.  In  many  cases,  particularly  in  emerging  markets,  mid-market \nowners have a strong aversion to equity dilution, making mezzanine their only viable financing \nalternative.2\n \n4.  Additionally, mezzanine financing often plays a significant role in leveraged buyouts \n(LBO). The presence of mezzanine increases leverage in a transaction, enhancing the expected \nreturns of the equity sponsor as the investee company pays down the mezzanine and senior \ndebt. This allows for transactions of size and complexity that might not exist without this asset \nclass. Further, mezzanine can be used as a replacement for senior debt during recapitalization \nor refinancing. In such situations, it also provides more flexibility for ongoing expansion and \nlower leverage. \n \n5.  Finally, mezzanine financing is particularly well-suited for longer-term investments, such \nas those in infrastructure, because of the current income provided by this asset class. Due to \nthe long life of infrastructure projects and investments, investors often prefer to provide capital \nthat involves fixed or variable current interest repayments, as opposed to more standard private \nequity arrangements that are much riskier due to their heavy emphasis on back-end financial \nreturns.  Moreover,  banks  often  are  hesitant  to  supply  long-term  risk  capital  to mid-market \ninfrastructure companies\u2014an opportunity that mezzanine finance providers can seize. \n \n2.  Mezzanine Finance in Developed Economies \n6.  Mezzanine  financing  began  in  the  1950s  when  insurance  companies  in  the  United \nStates (US), in search of a specific risk-return profile, began granting equity-linked notes to \nprivate, mid-market companies. European banks and private equity firms soon caught on to \nmezzanine, and the use of this mode of financing flourished throughout in the 1970s. In the \n1980s,  as  independent  mezzanine  funds  began  to  form  in  the  US,  a  dichotomy  suddenly \nemerged in the high-yield bond markets: mezzanine began to be used mainly for transactions \nbelow $75 million\u2013$100 million, while larger transactions were financed with high-yield bonds. \nThe introduction of LBOs, as well as the increasing importance of private equity over the past \nfew decades, also has spurred investment in mezzanine (footnote 1). \n \n7.  In the US, mezzanine is now a traditional source of allocations to alternative assets of \ninstitutional investors. In Europe, the volume of mezzanine financing has increased, as it has \nspread geographically from more traditional markets (e.g. the United Kingdom and, to a lesser \nextent, France and the Benelux countries) to other continental European countries. Today, the \nUS has more than 120 independent mezzanine specialists, while Europe has about 30. These \nlend to mid-market companies looking for a source of expansion capital, or deploy capital as \npart  of  the  funding  packages  of  LBOs.  Coupled  with  mezzanine  provided  by  banks,  this \nphenomenon translates into $10 billion of mezzanine financing in the US and \u20ac4 billion in \nEurope in 2003. Expansion capital accounts for about half of all mezzanine financing in the US \nand about 15% in Europe. By contrast, mezzanine in Asia has a short history, with only 4% of \nprivate equity financing structured as mezzanine capital. \n                                                 \n2 Private Equity International. 2004. The Guide to Private Equity Fund Investment Due Diligence. London.  \n ", "  3\n \n3.  Economic Development and Demand for Mezzanine in Asia \n8.  In 2005, developing countries in Asia benefited from strong global growth, which resulted \nin gross domestic product (GDP) rising 8.6%. Growth in 2006 is expected to rise similarly at \n8.2%.3 Over the long term, Asian economies are projected to grow, supported by favorable \ndemographics, as well as increasing economic, trade, and political and social liberalization. The \nWorld Bank projects real annual GDP per capita growth for East Asia and the Pacific to be 5.3% \nduring 2006\u20132015, more than double that of global growth, which is forecast to be 2.1%.4 \nHowever, as strong as this growth has been and is projected to be, Asia\u2019s nascent private equity \nindustry is still focusing mainly on large transactions, leaving a gap in mid-market equity finance. \nThis creates enormous potential for the issuance of mezzanine capital in the region for the \nfollowing reasons: \n \n(i)  Asian midsize deals remain under-penetrated. Despite the publicity generated \nin the press regarding private equity activities in emerging markets, much of the \nrecent Asian private equity fundraising and investing remains focused on larger \nbuyouts and restructurings in Australia and Japan. While the activity in 2005 \nshifted significantly away from buyouts and toward growth/expansion capital\u2014of \nthe $15 billion invested in Asia in 2005, larger buyouts accounted for less than \n50% of the transaction aggregate (versus 70% in 2004)\u2014the size of the average \ndeal in Asia ballooned by 31% to $63 million.5 This leaves significant room for \nmidsized transactions. \n \n(ii)  Companies with enterprise valuations less than $200 million tend to lack \npublic sources of financing. For a successful initial public offering (IPO), Asian \ncompanies  typically  need  to  reach  an  equity  valuation  of  $200  million\u2013$500 \nmillion. Despite improvements in the banking system and debt capital markets, \nlending and equity investing continues to focus on larger companies. \n \n(iii)  Institutionally intermediated mergers and acquisitions in Asia tend to focus \non  large  deals.  Less  than  8%  of  the  US  dollar  amount  of  mergers  and \nacquisitions traced by Bloomberg during 1999\u20132004 were within the range of $10 \nmillion\u2013$50 million. The diminished role of financial intermediaries for this size \ncreates a better environment for deal sourcing, pricing, and negotiation.  \n \n9.  While  mezzanine  financing  is  prevalent  in  the  US  and  certain  Western  European \ncountries, this asset class remains relatively new in ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMC). \nEven worldwide, only a few mezzanine fund managers are dedicated to emerging markets.  \nOne of the principle reasons for the undersupply of Asian mezzanine capital and expansion \ncapital is that domestic financial institutions focus on collateral- and asset-based lending. Thus, \nof the $17.6 billion of private equity investments in Asia in 2004, only 4% (less than $1 billion) \nwere in the form of mezzanine capital.6 For most midsized acquisitions in Asia, the acquirer \ngenerally  must  fund  the  transaction  internally.  Banks  in  Asia  remain  reluctant  to  provide \nacquisition funding to even their strongest clients. This reluctance, coupled with the tendency of \ncompany owners in DMCs to eschew equity dilution, makes mezzanine financing an attractive \nalternative to traditional bank or equity financing. For investors who seek alternatives to equity \n                                                 \n3  International Monetary Fund. 2006. World Economic Outlook.

Global Private Equity 2005. London. \n ", "4   \ninvestments in emerging and transition economies, mezzanine financing offers an attractive \nrisk-return profile. It provides current income and often allows for upside participation through \n\u201cequity kickers,\u201d such as warrants, without exposing the lender to the same downside risks as \nare traditional equity investors.  \n \n4.  Infrastructure Financing and Resultant Demand for Mezzanine \n10.  In  the  infrastructure  sector,  many  DMC  economies  are  substantially  underinvested, \nrelative to more developed economies, in sectors such as electric power, transportation, water, \nand telecommunications infrastructure facilities. In March 2005, the first joint study by ADB, the \nJapan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation,  and  the  World  Bank  estimated  that  developing \ncountries in East Asia need to spend more than $1 trillion over the following 5 years on roads, \nwater,  communications,  power,  and  other  infrastructure  to  cope  with  rapidly  expanding \neconomies, increasing populations, and growing demands of the private sector. The People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) alone is expected to require 80% of the total investment.7 Foreign and \nprivate sources are expected to provide a substantial portion of these requirements. Because of \nthe need for additional infrastructure, among other motivations, many countries in Asia have \nadopted  policies  that  seek  to  attract  private  sector  entities  to  invest  in  and  manage  such \nfacilities. \n \n11.  Given the substantial expenditures in ADB\u2019s DMCs going forward, infrastructure assets \noffer a highly attractive investment opportunity for investors who seek to increase their exposure \nto Asia.  Not only do infrastructure investments provide good returns, they also have a low \ncorrelation with other assets classes, allowing asset managers and investors to reduce overall \nportfolio risk and build more efficient portfolios. Moreover, mezzanine financing is particularly \nwell-suited for funding infrastructure investments, because of the current income it provides \n(versus more popular equity investments in Asia private equity, which investors would find \ndifficult to finance due to the long life and uncertainty of infrastructure investments). Fund \nmanagers operating in Asia recognize these benefits, as evidenced when Darby Overseas \nInvestments  Ltd.  (the  Fund  Manager  or  Darby)  assumed  control  of  the  $246  million  Asia \nInfrastructure Mezzanine Capital Fund (AIMCF) in March 2002. Under the Fund Manager\u2019s \nstewardship, AIMCF has completed its investment phase, negotiated restructurings of its most \nchallenging investments, and is on track to achieve a positive return. Further capitalizing on the \nopportunities that infrastructure investments offer in Asia, the Fund Manager closed a $610 \nmillion  private  equity  infrastructure  fund  in  the  Republic  of  Korea  (Darby  Korea  Emerging \nInfrastructure Fund) in July 2006. \n \n12.  Finally, the market for financing investment in infrastructure in the public and the private \nsectors  through  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP)  structures  is  growing  in  developing  Asia. \nIncreasing constraints on government budgets are driving this market expansion, which is being \nfacilitated  by  a  growing  acceptance  of  private  sector  involvement  in  public  infrastructure, \nservices, and utilities. This growth is expected to continue and expand geographically, with PPP \nstructures increasingly supplementing and augmenting the infrastructure investment capacity of \ngovernments. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n7  ADB, Japan Bank for International Cooperation, and World Bank. 2005.

Challenges and Opportunities \n         [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELTED] \n13.  Asia\u2019s  growth  and  integration  into  the  world  economy  creates  highly  desirable \ninvestment opportunities, and justifies a continued role for ADB as an investor in the private \nequity markets of its DMCs. Asia\u2019s integration into the global supply chain is inevitable, as the \nregion continues to produce everything from raw materials to high value-added technological \ngoods and services. Asia\u2019s share of trade increased from 14% in 1990 to 21% in 2004. By \ncomparison, the US share remained steady at 13%, while Western Europe\u2019s share increased \nonly marginally from 36% to 39% despite the formation of the European Union.8 With Asia\u2019s \nlow-cost and increasingly skilled labor force, improving infrastructure, and ongoing liberalization \nof trade flows, Asia\u2019s global integration is likely to continue to create opportunities to invest in \nentrepreneurial  companies  that  contribute  to  sustainable  economic  growth,  improved  living \nstandards, and poverty reduction. \n \n14.  However, the current challenge that ADB\u2019s DMCs face is that entrepreneurial, mid-\nmarket companies and infrastructure companies severely lack viable financing alternatives. \nAsian private equity, for example, is notably under-penetrated relative to the rest of the world. \nAsia accounted for only 18% of the estimated $96 billion of global private equity investment in \n2004. Excluding Australia and Japan, Asia accounted for less than 10%. Asian private equity \ninvestment as a percentage of GDP is less than half that of North America and Europe (0.2% \ncompared to 0.5% in North America and 0.4% in Europe). The main reason cited for the current \ntentativeness is a shortage of credible fund managers, and the lack of a track record for \nemerging markets private equity as an industry. Other key reasons include the perception that \nthe risk-return trade-off is better in more developed markets, and that quoted equities offer more \nliquid and safer exposure to emerging markets.9\n \n15.  The  growing  interest  in  Asian  emerging  markets  private  equity  is  creating  unique \nopportunities for a fund manager with regional experience and a track record in ADB\u2019s DMCs to \nhelp deepen the liquidity and attractiveness of the financial markets by promoting mezzanine \nfinancing.  An  investment  in  the  proposed  Fund  would  be  an  excellent  opportunity  to \ninstitutionalize and formalize mezzanine financing and middle market private equity financing, \nthereby positively influencing the enabling environment for private sector development. Further, \nthe  Fund  would  be  required  to  collect  information  on  regulatory  issues  that  its  portfolio \ncompanies encounter, which would be reported to ADB\u2019s regional departments to assist the \nformulation of a supportive regulatory framework.  \n \n16.  Evaluation studies show that multilateral development banks have the opportunity to \nachieve a high development impact in the context of an underserved middle market by fostering \ninvestments in entrepreneurial companies, and by catalyzing the growth of a nascent private \nequity  industry.  The  International  Finance  Corporation  (IFC)  recognizes  the  relationship \nbetween private equity and development impact, and the catalytic effect of fund investments. In \n2003, the IFC had roughly $1 billion of capital committed to private equity funds globally, with \n40% in Asia.10 The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has stimulated \nand catalyzed the private equity industry in Eastern Europe. EBRD, the largest private equity \ninvestor in central and Eastern Europe, has supported many private equity companies in the \nregion, where managers are setting up their fourth and fifth funds as the market matures. \n                                                 \n8  World Trade Organization database, October 2004. \n9  Coller Capital. 2005/06.

THE PROPOSED FUND \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELTED] \nA.  Objectives and Description  \n17.  Fund Objective.  The Fund\u2019s mezzanine investments are expected to have the following \ncharacteristics:  \n \n(i)  Combination of fixed-income style performance characteristics (including current \nyield from coupons) with equity upside prospects.  \n \n(ii)  Downside protection of principal through debt covenants. \n  \n(iii)  Built-in exit through amortization of the underlying loan principal to address the \nchallenges that exits from equity investments present in emerging economies, \ngiven the more limited opportunities for middle market companies to tap into \npublic equity markets. \n \n(iv)  Portfolio of loans structured to have cash flow characteristics that are relatively \npredictable and stable, and consequently allow for the use of leverage in the \nFund\u2019s capital structure, with the objective of improving returns to investors. \n \n18.  Focus  on  Middle  Market  Companies.  The  Fund  will  focus  on  middle  market \ncompanies with successful management track records and established, stable cash flows that \nrequire long-term risk capital, typically for expansion, acquisition, buyout, capital restructuring, \nor debt refinancing. The Fund Manager expects that the majority of its investments will be used \nfor expansion capital.  \n \n19.  The  Fund  will  invest  in  mezzanine  opportunities  within  Asia,  primarily  in  Peoples \nRepublic of China, India, Indonesia, Republic of Korea,13 Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand. \nThe Fund will pursue investments in a range of sectors that fall into two broad categories: \ninfrastructure, and commerce and industry.  \n \n20.  Sector Focus. The Fund will target to invest approximately 50% of its investments in the \ninfrastructure sector, and is legally obligated to invest at least 40% the Fund\u2019s committed capital \n(including senior debt) in the infrastructure sector. The infrastructure sector includes services \nthat  have  been  privatized,  or  are  provided  under  contractual  arrangements  that  involve  a \n                                                 \n11  Evans, Julian. 2004.

Within the infrastructure sector, the Fund \nplans to target:  \n \n(i)  Transportation. Toll roads, bridges and tunnels, cargo terminals, rail freight \ntransport operations, private urban and regional transport, and regional airports. \n \n(ii)  Energy. Generation and distribution of power, oil, gas and heat; and renewable \nenergy, such as wind energy. \n \n(iii)  Telecommunication.  Fixed  line  telephony  networks  and  infrastructure,  and \nmobile data networks. \n \n(iv)  Waste  management.  Municipal  waste  collection,  treatment,  and  disposal, \nincluding  incineration  and  waste-to-energy  projects;  and  industrial  waste \ncollection, treatment, and disposal. \n \n(v)  Water  and  wastewater.  Bulk  water  transmission;  water  treatment  and \ndistribution; and wastewater collection and treatment. \n \n21.  In the commercial and industrial sector, the Fund will seek investment opportunities in \nprivately owned smaller and mid-sized companies that operate in a broad range of industries. \nThe  Fund  will  diversify  the  sources  of  finance  available  for  entrepreneurial  companies  by \ninclusion of mezzanine finance. Supporting these fast growing entrepreneurial companies has a \nhigh impact on economic development because these companies innovate, combine productive \nresources in new ways and create jobs. Once successfully accomplished, the implementation of \na new production process may also yield social returns above financial returns because it \ndemonstrates to other companies that a process is feasible in a particular environment.  \n \nB.

Brady,  the  former  US  Treasury  Secretary  who  established  the  firm  in  1994, \ncontinues to serve as chairman. Richard Frank, chief executive officer of Darby, joined the firm \nin 1997 after a distinguished career as a World Bank managing director and as IFC chief \nfinancial officer. In October of 2003, Franklin Templeton Investments, with $492 billion in assets \nunder management, acquired Darby as its private equity and mezzanine finance arm.  \n \n23.

ADB\u2019s investment in the Fund is classified as category FI under ADB\u2019s Environment \nPolicy.14 The Fund Manager has experience with adhering to ADB\u2019s social and environmental \n                                                 \n14  ADB. 2002. Environment Policy. Manila. \n ", "8   \nsafeguard polices through its existing fund. The Fund Manager is developing an environmental \npolicy and environmental management system (EMS) for the proposed Fund in cooperation with \nADB.  Several  of  the  Fund  Managers\u2019  investment  professionals  will  attend  ADB-sponsored \ntraining to increase their capacity in environmental and social management. Two of the Fund \nManager\u2019s staff are assigned to environmental and social management.  \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s investment in the Fund is classified as category B/C under ADB\u2019s involuntary \nresettlement policy.15 No involuntary resettlement is foreseen in relation to any investments by \nthe Fund. The Fund will adopt a resettlement framework that defines the policies, procedures, \nroles,  and  responsibilities  of  the  Fund  for  screening  and  management  of  involuntary \nresettlement by portfolio companies. \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s  investment  in  the  Fund  is  classified as  category  C  under ADB\u2019s  indigenous \npeoples policy.16 No investments by the Fund are expected to impact indigenous peoples. The \nFund Manager is required to screen and monitor portfolio companies to ensure their compliance \nwith ADB\u2019s indigenous peoples policy. The Fund will not make investments that impinge on the \nlands owned, or claimed under adjudication, by indigenous peoples, without full documented \nconsent of such peoples. \n   \nB.  Anticorruption, and Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n27.  ADB advised the Fund Manager of its policies on anticorruption,17 and combating of \nmoney laundering and the financing of terrorism.18 Consistent with its commitment to good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will require the Fund Manager to institute, \nmaintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following international best practice \nstandards for preventing corruption, money laundering, or the financing of terrorism. The Fund \nManager will be required to covenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. The \ninvestment  documentation  between  ADB  and  the  Fund  will  allow  ADB  to  investigate  any \nviolation or potential violation of these undertakings. Through its due diligence, ADB is satisfied \nthat the Fund Manager has put in place proper procedures to ensure that its portfolio companies \nare not engaged in corrupt activities or the financing of terrorism.  \n \nC.  Investment Limitations and Waiver \n28.  The proposed investment is within ADB's country and equity exposure limits for private \nsector operations. However, it would exceed the industry exposure limit for capital markets and \ninvestment funds, which is set at 15% of the private sector portfolio. The capital market and \ninvestment funds industry accounts for 17.78% of ADB\u2019s private sector portfolio. Following this \ninvestment,  it  would  increase  to  18.48%.  If  an  additional  $10  million  investment  in  Siam \nInvestment Fund III, which will be presented to the Board in the next month, were included, the \nprivate sector portfolio of capital market and investment funds would represent 18.76%. After \nconsidering this breach of the industry exposure limit, ADB\u2019s Risk Management Unit supports a \nwaiver of this limit by Management for this proposed investment. Management has agreed to \ngrant such a waiver.19 The Risk Management Unit is preparing a policy to reclassify the industry \nsectors and revise the limits to better reflect ADB\u2019s strategic foci.

However, most equity funds \ninvest in many different industries and companies. Hence, ADB\u2019s exposure is to the underlying \nindustries  invested  in  by  each  fund,  not  to  the  generic  industry  of  capital  markets  and \ninvestment funds. The new industry sectors and limits will reflect this. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n29.  Following the approval of the proposed investment by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors, ADB \nwill enter into suitable investment documentation for its investment of up to the lesser of $20 \nmillion or 25% of the Fund\u2019s total equity capital, and will ensure that such documentation and \nother principal agreements relating to the Fund will be on terms and conditions acceptable to \nADB and incorporate all relevant ADB policies. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n30.  I am satisfied that the proposed investment in Darby Asia Mezzanine Fund II would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of ADB, and recommend that the Board approve the \ninvestment of up to the lesser of $20 million or 25% of the total equity capital of Darby Asia \nMezzanine Fund II from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources.  \n \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n \n \n \n17
