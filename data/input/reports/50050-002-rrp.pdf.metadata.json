GZAR\u2019s  international \n3. \ntrade has increased rapidly, from $17.7 billion in 2010 to $51.3 billion in 2015, with Viet Nam as \nits biggest trade partner accounting  for 48% of this trade. GZAR\u2019s border trade with Viet Nam, \nwhich  occurs  mainly  through  the  key  border  crossing  points  of  Dongxing,  Longbang,  and \nPingxiang, has increased particularly fast, from $3.3 billion in 2010 to $16.3 billion in 2015. Key \nimports from Viet Nam consist of agricultural products (including fresh and dry fruits, vegetables, \ngrains,  live  animals  and  animal  products,  starch,  and  aquatic  products)  and  minerals,  while \nGZAR\u2019s  main  exports  to  Viet  Nam  are  electrical,  machinery,  textile,  and  petroleum  products. \nInternational trade conducted by the private sector, mostly small and medium-sized enterprises \n(SMEs), accounted for 52% of GZAR\u2019s total trade in 2015.  \n \n4. \nKey  constraints  in  economic  corridor  and  border  area  development.  The  border \nareas  of  GZAR  and  Viet  Nam  are  key  areas  for  development  of  RCI  through  trade.  However, \nopportunities, especially in terms of growing cross-border trade and investment, have not been \nfully  tapped  due  to  inefficient  transport  and  trade  operations  along  the  NSEC.  Constraints \ninclude  (i)  the  low  level  of  development  of  SMEs  due  to  limited  access  to  bank  credit,  lack  of \nreliable market information, challenges in hiring and retaining skilled staff and labor, and rising \ncosts (especially labor); (ii) costly, risky, and time-consuming cross-border financial transactions \nand the  perceived  noncommercial  risks for cross-border  investment such as foreign exchange \nrestrictions,  possible  nationalization  of  industries,  and  breach  of  contractual  obligations;  (iii) \ndifficulties faced by local traders in adopting e-commerce to access external markets due to lack \nof common platforms and inadequate trade facilitation measures for cross-border e-commerce; \n(iv)  inadequate  infrastructure  and  services  in  border  economic  zones  (BEZs);  and  (v)  poor \ninfrastructure  for  connectivity,  especially  at  key  border  crossing  points.  Addressing  these \nconstraints  will  require  a  strategic,  holistic,  multisector  approach  combining  physical \ninfrastructure  improvement  and  trade  and  investment  facilitation  measures  to  promote  cross-\nborder economic activities.  \n \n\n                                                \n1   The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in  Appendix  1.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project \npreparatory technical assistance for Guangxi Regional Cooperation and Integration Promotion Investment Program \n(TA 9120-PRC).  \n\n2   Specifically,  the  investment  program  will  finance  subprojects  in  Guangxi  Zhuang  Autonomous  Region  (GZAR), \nincluding  (i)  Baise  Municipality,  including  the  border  towns  of  Longbang  and  Yuexu;  (ii)  Chongzuo  Municipality, \nincluding  Daxin  County  and  Pingxiang  City;  (iii)  Fangchenggang  Municipality,  including  Dongxing  City;  and  (iv) \nQinzhou Municipality.  \n\n\f2 \n\nin  energy,  agriculture,  manufacturing,  and \n\nStrategic  context.  RCI  is  one  of  five  strategic  priorities  of  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s \n5. \n(ADB)  country  partnership  strategy  for  the  PRC,  2016\u20132020.3 It  is  also  a  priority  in  the  PRC\u2019s \n13th Five-Year Plan for 2016\u20132020.4 In 2015, the PRC announced the Silk Road Economic Belt \nand  21st  Century  Maritime  Silk  Road  Initiative,  which  aims  to  promote  connectivity  and \nstrengthen  economic  partnerships  in  the  spirit  of  open  regionalism.5 GZAR  has  mainstreamed \nRCI  into  its  provincial  13th  plan,  with  emphasis  on  (i)  strengthening  cooperation  with  ASEAN, \nparticularly the GMS, countries; (ii) participating in major international economic corridors linking \nGZAR and ASEAN; and (iii) serving as the gateway for PRC\u2019s southwest region. \n \n6. \nRoad map. GZAR has a strategy and action plan for participation in the GMS Economic \nCooperation  Program.6 The  plan  defines  five  priorities:  (i)  improving  cross-border  connectivity, \nwith  a  focus  on  transport  in  border  areas,  border-crossing  points,  and  information  connectivity \nwith ASEAN countries; (ii) accelerating the development of economic corridors, particularly the \nNSEC; (iii) enhancing participation in global value chains by deepening cooperation with other \nGMS  countries \ntourism;  (iv) strengthening \ncooperation in human resources  development,  including  cross-border technical  and vocational \ntraining;  and  (v)  strengthening  environment  cooperation.  The  strategy  and  action  plan  also \nhighlights the importance of a win-win approach to cross-border cooperation to benefit Viet Nam \nand other GMS countries. \n \nPolicy framework. The strategy and action plan also specifies policies conducive to the \n7. \nsuccessful  implementation  of  the  MFF.  Key  policies  include:  (i)  improving  trade  facilitation  by \nintroducing  pilot  tests  for  coordinated  border  management  and  joint  customs  control  with  Viet \nNam  at  selected  border-crossing  points  by  2018;  (ii)  promoting  development  of  BEZs; 7 (iii) \nfurther  reducing  nontariff  barriers  to  trade,  including  broadening  of  the  list  of  goods  and \ncommodities  for  trade  between  border  residents  of  GZAR  and  Viet  Nam  with  pilot \nimplementation  by  2018;  (iv)  reforming  public  investment  policy  for  border  services  by \nintroducing  public\u2013private  partnership,  which  will  be  pilot  tested  at  selected  border  crossing \npoints  by  2018;  and  (v)  further  improving  the  consultation  mechanism  between  GZAR  and \nVietnamese border provinces to coordinate policies and actions for border area development. \n \n8. \nInvestment  program.  GZAR\u2019s  GMS  strategy  and  action  plan  includes  a  priority \ninvestment program for 2015\u20132020, covering five priority areas (para. 6) with a total investment \nof  $45  billion.  Special  attention  is  given  to  investment  in  the  border  areas,  including  Baise, \nChongzuo,  Fangchenggang,  and  Qinzhou  municipalities.  The  priority  investment  program  is \nintended for financing  by  various sources,  including the  central  PRC  and  GZAR governments, \nmultilateral  development  banks,  and  the  private  sector.  The  Government  of  the  PRC  has \nrequested ADB to provide a $450 million MFF to fund a group of high-priority projects in the four \nborder municipalities, with a total cost of $1.18 billion.  \n\n \nThe investment program will have high positive RCI spillovers, also benefiting Viet Nam, \n9. \nparticularly  its  northern provinces  of  Cao  Bang, Ha Giang,  Lang Son,  and  Quang  Ninh.

Nanning. \n\n7  The governments of the PRC and Viet Nam signed a memorandum of understanding on 13 October 2013 on joint \n\nManila. \n\ndevelopment of BEZs. \n\n \n\n\fsubprojects were included in the investment program in response to requests from the Viet Nam \nlocal governments in those provinces. The benefits for Viet Nam will be achieved mainly through \n(i) improved connectivity and trade facilitation which will provide better access for northern Viet \nNam  to  markets  in  GZAR  and  other  parts  of  the  PRC;  (ii)  expansion  of  trade,  especially  Viet \nNam\u2019s export of agricultural products, which will help increase income of the  local farmers and \nborder area residents; and (iii)  training of Vietnamese workers which will help them find higher-\nincome jobs in GZAR.  \n \nJustification for choosing multitranche financing facility. Given the nature of RCI as \n10. \ndescribed above, the traditional single sector lending and one project at a time approach will not \nbe appropriate. The MFF is a suitable modality since it will (i) allow ADB to develop a long-term \npartnership  with  Guangxi  for  promoting  RCI;  (ii)  provide  GZAR  and  the  PRC  with  high \npredictability  of  financing  for  RCI  which,  in  turn,  will  help  improve  the  efficiency  of  country \nprogramming; (iii) allow phased funding to match project readiness and level of consultation and \nconsensus-building  with \nthe  Viet  Nam  counterparts;  (iv)  provide  opportunities  during \nimplementation to accommodate new cooperation initiatives;8 (v) facilitate policy and operational \ninvestment;  and \ndialogue  on  various  cross-border \n(vi) systematically enhance Guangxi\u2019s capacity for implementing RCI strategies and action plans. \nThe  nature  of  subprojects  across  tranches  is  similar,  and  the  executing  agency  has  a  proven \ntrack record in implementing ADB projects.   \n \nB. \n\nImpacts and Outcome \n\nto  physical \n\nin  addition \n\nissues, \n\n11. \nThe impacts will be economic growth potential realized for border areas in the PRC and \nViet  Nam,  efficient  transport  and  trade  operations  along  the  GMS  NSEC  achieved,  and \neconomic  integration  between  GZAR  and  rest  of  the  GMS  further  strengthened. The  outcome \nwill be benefits of RCI in border areas of Guangxi and northern Viet Nam captured. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n12. \n\nTo address the identified constraints, the MFF will deliver five major outputs:  \n(i) \n\nSupport for small and medium-sized enterprises in border areas expanded. \nThe  investment  program  will  (a)  provide  credit  to  SMEs  in  the  four  border \nmunicipalities  (including  the  Vietnamese  SMEs  operating  in  GZAR)  using  the \nfinancial  intermediation  loan  (FIL)  modality; 9  (b) strengthen  GZAR\u2019s  business \ndevelopment  services  system  to  provide  better  services  to  SMEs,  including \nbusiness  networking  and  outreach  support,  market  and  technology  information, \nand  financial  and  human  resources  management;  and  (c)  support  GZAR\u2019s  pilot \nprojects  on  cross-border  labor  cooperation  by  improving  training  facilities  and \nproviding well-designed training programs for local and Vietnamese workers. \n\n                                                \n8  The  governments  of  the  PRC  and  Viet  Nam  concluded in  September  2016  negotiations  on the  amended  Border \nfor  Economic  and  Trade  Cooperation. \n\nTrade  Agreement  and \nImplementation of these agreements is expected to start in 2017. \n\nthe  PRC\u2013Viet  Nam  Five-Year  Program \n\n9  In the first  tranche, the Guangxi Branch of the Bank of Communications (BOCOM)  was  selected as the financial \nintermediary against four criteria: financial creditworthiness, institutional capabilities to manage the SME financing \nscheme, the extent of reach to SME markets, and the ability to fulfill ADB\u2019s reporting and safeguard standards. The \ntargeted  SMEs  are  those  engaged  in  cross-border  trade  and  logistics,  agribusiness,  manufacturing,  and  cross-\nborder tourism. The ADB loan proceeds will be onlent through the financial intermediary to SMEs at market interest \nrates.  Following  initial  implementation,  opportunities  will  be  explored  to  include  other  eligible  local  financial \ninstitutions.  Integrity  due  diligence  has  been  conducted  on  BOCOM,  and  further  integrity  due  diligence  will  be \nundertaken for future financial intermediaries. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\ninvestments \n\nincreased.  The \nCross-border  financial  transactions  and \ninvestment  program  will  (a)  support  the  development  of  cross-border  financial \nservice centers in Dongxing and Pingxiang BEZs to provide one-stop services for \ncurrency  swaps,  payments,  and  settlements;  and  (b)  explore  measures  to \nmitigate the noncommercial risks faced by investors. \nIntegrated  and  interoperable  cross-border  e-commerce  platforms  for  the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  Viet  Nam  developed.

The  building  designs  follow  standard  PRC  guidelines  and  design  codes, \nincluding architecture, water supply and sewage, firefighting, electric power supply, and lighting \nand  communication  systems.  Design  consideration  includes  energy  savings,  environmental \nprotection,  and  climate  risk  mitigation.  Integrated  information  systems  will  be  established  to \nsupport e-commerce and enhance logistics services in Longbang BEZ of Baise Municipality. \n \nB. \n \nStandard cost\u2013benefit analysis was applied to individual subprojects of the first tranche \n18. \nwhere  possible,  using  with-  and  without-project  alternatives  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects. 13 The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is \ncomputed  at  22.4%  for  the  first  tranche,  higher  than  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital \nestimated  at  12.0%.  The  analysis  shows  that  the  first  tranche  of  the  investment  program \nremains  economically  viable  in  the  face  of  downside  risks,  including  a  10.0%  cost  overrun,  a \n10.0% benefits reduction, a 1-year delay in implementation start-up, and a combination of all the \nthree negative changes.14 \n \n19. \nA  standard  financial  analysis  showed  that  the  project  incremental  costs  will  have  a \nnegligible impact on the budget of the Government of GZAR which has an average revenue of \nabout $64 billion annually and a projected budget surplus, and that the maximum impact will be \nless  than  0.5%  of  GZAR\u2019s  annual  budget  surplus.  The  financial  analysis  also  examined  the \n                                                \n13 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n14 Details are in Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nGovernance \n\nthree  subprojects  (Pingxiang  cross-border  labor  cooperation  park,  Pingxiang  border  trade \nservice  center,  and  Longbang  smart  port)  likely  to  have  revenues,  and  assessed  projected \nincremental financials over a life cycle period in real terms. The financial internal rate of return of \nthe  three  subprojects  was  computed  at  1.0%,  6.0%,  and  7.8%  respectively,  higher  than  their \nrespective weighted average cost of capital of 0.6%, 0.5%, and 0.6%. This is also assured in the \nsubproject  expansion  of  SME  financing  in  GZAR,  with  sustainability  as  a  fundamental \nrequirement for subloan selection by the financial intermediary. In both analyses, the investment \nprogram overall is considered to be viable and sustainable. \n \nC. \n \n20. \nA standard financial management assessment was carried out for the executing agency \nand  project  implementing  entities  (PIEs).  The  executing  agency  is  implementing  two  ADB-\nfinanced projects and has sufficient knowledge and experience in ADB policies and procedures. \nThe executing and implementing agencies and one of the PIEs are government entities, and the \nother  two  PIEs  are  state-owned  enterprises.  The  government  has  a  controlling  interest  in  the \nfinancial  intermediary,  BOCOM.  No  major  country-level  financial  management  issues  are \napparent.  The  financial  management  risk  is  rated  low.  Pre-mitigation  and  strengthening \nmeasures have been included for improving the financial systems. The overall inherent risk and \ncontrol  risk  have  been  assessed  low.  Capacity  for  internal  auditing  in  the  PIEs  was,  however, \nassessed medium risk, and mitigation measures are proposed.  \n \n21. \nA procurement capacity assessment confirmed that the Guangxi Foreign Loans Project \nManagement Office (GPMO) and the PIEs, acting through a procurement agency and with the \nassistance  of  ADB  and  project  management  consultants,  will  have  adequate  capacity  to \nfacilitate  full  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime)  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nProcurement risk is considered medium, and action plans will be prepared to mitigate potential \nrisks.  Procurement  under  the  SME  financing  subcomponent  will  be  done  in  accordance  with \ncommercial practices acceptable to ADB, and a procurement manual will be prepared to serve \nas a guide for the SME subborrowers. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwas  explained  to,  and  discussed  with,  the  Government  of  the  PRC  and  GPMO.  The  specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the FAM. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nA  social  and  poverty  analysis  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines.  The \n22. \npoverty  rates  are  16.5%  in  Baise,  13.7%  in  Chongzuo,  3.6%  in  Fangchenggang,  and  4.2%  in \nQinzhou  in  2015  against  the  provincial  average  of  8.2%. 15  The  investment  program  will \ncontribute  to  economic  growth  in  border  areas  and  beyond  in  the  PRC  and  Viet  Nam.  The \nimproved  cross-border  connectivity  and  increased  trade  and  investment  will  facilitate  growth, \ncreate  employment  opportunities  for  local  communities  during  the  construction  and  operation \nphases, and raise the income of local residents. Local and Vietnamese unskilled workers, over \none-third  of  whom  are  women,  will  be  trained  for  better  employment.  All  construction  workers \nwill  be  covered  by  the  awareness  campaigns  and  training  on  HIV/AIDS,  sexually  transmitted \ninfections,  and  human  trafficking.  A  social  development  and  gender  action  plan  has  been \nprepared and will be implemented to strengthen the investment program impact. The project will \ncollect and include gender-disaggregated data as part of the social and poverty analysis. \n \n\n                                                \n15 Targeted Poverty Incidence Survey issued by the Guangxi Poverty Reduction Office, January 2016. \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nE. \n \n23. \nEnvironment. Tranche 1 (other than the SME financing component) has been classified \ncategory B for environment. A consolidated initial environmental examination and environmental \nmanagement  plan  has  been  prepared  for  the  three  subprojects  involving  infrastructure.  The \nenvironmental  management  plan  identifies  appropriate  design,  construction,  and  operational \nmitigation  and  monitoring  measures  to  reduce  the  potential  impacts  to  acceptable  levels.  An \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework  was  prepared  for  screening,  categorization, \nassessment,  preparation  and  implementation  of  safeguard  plans,  if  required,  for  components, \nprojects, and subprojects to be prepared after MFF approval. These documents comply with the \nPRC\u2019s regulatory requirements and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy  Statement (2009), and have been \ndisclosed on the ADB website. Public consultation and information disclosure were carried out \nduring the project design and will continue during project implementation. Environmental training \nwill be provided to build capacity. Environmental complaints will be handled through a grievance \nredress  mechanism.  A  wildlife  trafficking  study  has  been  carried  out  to  assess  the  risks,  and \nmitigation measures will be implemented in tranche 1 and subsequent tranches. \n \n24.  Climate  change  risk.  A  climate  risk  and  vulnerability  assessment  indicated  that  the \nproject  area,  characterized  by  complex  geology,  is  at  high  risk  from  climate  change  impacts, \nsuch  as  extreme  rainfall, flooding,  landslides, and heatwaves.  It  is recommended that  an  8%\u2013\n10%  increase  in  design  standard  be  adopted  for  the  drainage  systems  and  a  higher  design \nstandard be considered for slope stabilization to increase resilience to future flood and landslide \nrisks. Recommendations were also made to reduce the risk of heatwave impacts. An assurance \nrequiring consideration of climate change recommendations is included in the project agreement. \n \n25. \nInvoluntary resettlement. Tranche 1 of the investment program is classified category C \nfor  involuntary  resettlement.  Due  diligence  reports  for  the  three  subprojects  involving \ninfrastructure  have  been  prepared,  confirming  that  all  land  acquisition  is  in  compliance  with \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  the  PRC\u2019s  Land  Law  (1999)  and  other  related  regulations \nwithout any pending land acquisition and resettlement issues. No additional land acquisition and \nhouse  demolition  will  be  required  for  tranche  1.  A  resettlement  framework  was  prepared  to \nguide the preparation of resettlement plans for the subsequent tranches, if required. \n \n26. \nIndigenous  peoples  or  ethnic  minorities.  Tranche  1  is  classified  category  B  for \nindigenous peoples. The Zhuang people constitute the dominant population in the project areas \nand  there  is  no  concentrated  settlement  of  any  other  ethnic  group.  Based  on  due  diligence  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  tranche  1  will  not  incur  any  adverse \nimpacts  on  ethnic  minorities.  Indigenous  peoples  plan  elements  were  included  in  the  project \ndesign following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. An indigenous peoples planning framework \nwas prepared to guide the preparation of any indigenous peoples plan for further tranches. Each \nsubsequent  tranche  of the  MFF  will  be  screened,  classified,  and assessed  in accordance  with \nthe indigenous peoples planning framework.  \n \n27. \nEnvironmental and social management system for financial intermediary. The SME \nfinancing  subcomponent  is  categorized  as  financial  intermediary.  An  environmental  and  social \nmanagement  system  (ESMS)  has  been  developed  by  BOCOM,  covering  environmental  and \nsocial  policies;  the  safeguards  screening,  categorization,  and  review  process;  institutional \narrangements;  and  monitoring  and  reporting  procedures  for  subprojects  under  the  FIL.16 The \n\n                                                \n16  Other  eligible  financial intermediaries  participating in  financial  intermediation loans  in  future  tranches  will also  be \n\nrequested to develop an ESMS satisfactory to ADB. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nESMS will exclude subprojects that will trigger category A for environment and category A or B \nfor  social  safeguards,  and  that  are  in  the  prohibited  investment  list  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. Subprojects classified as category B or C for environment will be \nsubject to requirements set out in the ESMS.
