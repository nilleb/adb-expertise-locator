The loan will have a term of 40 years\nincluding a grace period of 10 years, with a service chargeof 1 per cent\nper annum. The assistance is proposed under the Bank's emergency\nrehabilitation facility for small developing member countries (DMCs),!'\nwhich provides for a loan of up to $500,000 in the event of a disaster.\nThe facility involves abbreviated loan processing and approval\nprocedures. The Report also describes a technical assistance (TA) grant\nin an amount in various currencies equivalent to $150,000, applied for\nby the Government for Disaster Mitigation and Management, which I shall\napprove if the proposed loan is approved by the Board.\n\nFollowing the destruction of infrastructure and crops during\n2.\nTyphoon Gay, 17-20 November, the Government of MAR requested Bank\nassistance for an emergency rehabilitation program. The request was\nconveyed on 28 November via a facsimile message to the President. A\nFact-Finding Mission went to the field 7-16 December, visited several of\nthe stricken atolls, and conducted an assessment of the situation.\n\n3.\nthe first for emergency rehabilitation after a natural disaster.\n\nIf approved, the loan would be the Bank's second to MAR, and\n\nI. THE ECONOMY'\n\nAn Economic Report on the Republic of the Marshall Islands\n4.\n(ECR MAR 91006) was circulated to the Board of Directors on 10 April 1991\nIN .63-9 1)\n\nIn fiscal year (FY) 1992 gross domestic product (GDP) growth\n5.\nwas influenced by the economic conditions prevailing in the U.S., the\ndominant trading partner of the country, and by the contraction in\nmarketed and nonmarketed agriculture due to the effects of cyclone Zelda\nin December 1991 and cyclone Axel in January 1992. GDP growth at market\nprices slowed for the second consecutive year to an estimated 1 per cent\nin FY1992 compared with 3 per cent in FY1991 and 4.4 per cent in FY1990.\nWith consumer prices rising at about 2 per cent a year, the average\nannual real growth rate over the last two years therefore stagnated. The\n\nThe policy guidelines are laid down in Doc. R74-87. Rehabilitation Assistance to Small\nDMCs Affected by Natural Disasters, dated 17 June 1987.\n\nV\t\n\n3!\t\n\n2!\t\n\nThe mission comprised Paul McCabe, Programs Officer.\n\nSee Appendix for Basic Data.\n\n\f2\n\nslowing trend in GD? growth, coupled with rapid population growth, led\nto a contraction in GDP per capita of 0.9 per cent in FY1991 and a\nfurther 2.9 per cent in FY1992.\n\nCompensation of employees accounted for 74 per cent of GD? in\n6.\nFY1992, compared with about 55 per cent at the beginning of the 1980s.\nWhile the compensation of employees in both the public and the private\nsectors has shown a steady increase because of the impact of U.S. aid and\nan increase in the level of economic activity associated with institution\nbuilding and infrastructure development, the operating surplus has shown\na declining trend since FY1989. Largely comprised of taxes on private\nenterprises and estimated nonmarket production, <the total operating\nsurplus declined from 36 per cent of GDP in FY1980 to about 22 per cent\nin FY1992. Recent efforts to improve revenues have led to indirect\ntaxes, another significant component of GD?, increasing from 8.6 per cent\nof GDP in FY1987 to over 11 per cent in FY1992. A disconcerting trend\nover this period was the corresponding increase in subsidies from 3.4 per\ncent of GDP in FY1987 to an estimated 11.0 per cent in FY1992. While\nthis reflects the expansion in public services to cater for the rapidly\nincreasing population, it underscores the need for improved cost recovery\nwithout at the same time affecting poverty reduction initiatives.\n\nPrices have generally remained stable, averaging about 2 per\n7.\ncent growth annually. This reflects prudent financial management, the\nopenness of the economy and the use of the U.S. dollar as currency.\nThere is, however, some indication of an acceleration in the inflation\nrate as indicated by the rise in the consumer price index (CPI) for\nMajuro in the first quarter of 1992 compared with the previous quarter.\nBetween these two quarters the price level increased by 4.4 per cent,\nmainly on account of price increases for imported food and fuel.\n\nUnemployment, at 12.5 per cent in 1988, will continue to worsen\n8.\nif broad-based economic growth in certain types of labor-intensive\neconomic activities is not stimulated quickly enough. With 51 per cent\nof the population under 15, additions to the labor force will certainly\ncompound the unemployment problem. As the public sector is already\noverextended, new employment opportunities will have to be generated\nmainly in the private sector.\n\nSince F'f 1990 Central Government budgetary developments have\n9.\nbeen increasingly affected by reductions in U.S. aid. The actual revenue\noutturn in FY1991 showed a decline of $6.6 million in U.S. aid to\n$45.7 million, with a corresponding two-thirds reduction in development\nexpenditures. A further reduction in aid of about $4.2 million is\nforecast for FY1992, with total U.S. grants dropping to about\n$41.5 million, some $10 million lower than the average during the first\nfive years of the Compact of Free Association. ! ' Against this\nbackground, and in order to finance priority development projects, the\nGovernment issued a third bond for $38 million in September 1991,\nguaranteed as previously against future Compact revenues. Tcio projects\nhave already been approved, and 38 more are under consideration. For the\n\n'\t\n\nDated 20 October 1986 (as amended) between MAR and the United States.\n\n\f3\n\nlonger term, the Mission was informed that the Government's main\nbudgetary priorities are to increase the mobilization of resources from\nboth domestic and foreign sources, to limit the growth of operational\nexpenditures while keeping maintenance expenditures at adequate levels,\nand to increase the allocation of resources to priority development\nareas.\n\nIn the external sector, the trade balance continues to be in\n10.\nchronic deficit, with exports on the average representing only about\n4.5 per cent of total imports. Despite the large trade deficits, the\ncurrent account in 1991 recorded sizeable surpluses, averaging about\n45 per cent of GDP. Excluding official transfers, however, the current\naccount registered large deficits, averaging over 40 per cent of CD?.\nIn the longer term, as the programmed reduction of Compact funds takes\nplace, it is vital to improve domestic production capacity in order to\nnarrow the chronic trade deficit.\n\nIn connection with its borrowing program during 1987-1991 the\n11.\ncountry entered into three Indenture of Trust and Security Agreements\nwith Irving Trust Company and the Bank of New York as trustees. Pursuant\nto these Agreements, MAR has granted a prior lien in favor of the\ntrustees with respect to a portion of payments it will be receiving from\nthe U.S. pursuant to the Compact of Free Association amounting to\napproximately $260.5 million. It is not possible for the Bank to obtain\npan passu rights in respect of these liens. The Bank therefore, as was\nthe case in its. previous loan to MAR !' has agreed that the Bank's\nnegative pledge clause will not apply in respect of these prior liens.\n\nII. BANK OPERATIONS IN THE REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS\n\nWhen MAR joined the Bank in 1990, it was classified as a Group\n12.\nA country, eligible to borrow from the Asian Development Fund. Since the\nstart of its operations in the country in 1990, the Bank has approved one\nloan from Special Funds resources, the Fisheries Development Project, in\nTechnical assistance in an amount of\nan amount of $6.95 million.\t\n$2.502 million has been provided for seven projects. The total\ncumulative disbursement as of 31 December 1992 amounted to $0.883 million\nor 9 per cent of the total available for withdrawal.\n\nIII. THE TYPHOON AND THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE\n\nA.\t\n\nExtent of Damage\n\n13.\nIslands, causing widespread destruction and damage. \t\n\nOn 17 November 1992 Typhoon Gay hit the northern Marshall\nHeavy rain and\n\nLoan No. 1102-MAR: Fisheries Development, for $6.95 million, dated 26 September 1991.\n\n\f4\n\nsustained winds up to 282 kilometers per hour (km/h), with gusts up to\n345 km/h, lasted three days. The super-storm took place toward the end\nof one of the most virulent typhoon seasons in years.\n\n14. In the afflicted areas, there was heavy damage to agriculture\nand fisheries, as well as to the limited infrastructure. These islands\nand atolls depend principally on subsistence fishing and farming of\ntraditional food crops, so economic activity was seriously affected as\na result of the typhoon. Up to 100 per cent losses of homes and crops\ntook place in Ailuk, Mejit and Wotho, the areas most seriously affected.\nLesser damage occurred in Enewetak, Wotje, Likiep, Ujelang, Utirik, Aur,\nMaloelap and Bikini Atolls. More than 300 homes were destroyed or\nheavily damaged; small businesses were seriously affected; and\ntraditional food crops were ruined by wind and contamination from salt\nwater where they were not destroyed. Since the outer islanders depend\nprincipally on tree crops - breadfruit, pandanus, banana and coconut -\nrehabilitation of agriculture is expected to take several years.\n\n15. Many atolls are cluttered with debris from the storm, in\nresidential and agricultural areas and on airstrips. On many atolls,\nrainwater catcbments - the principal source of fresh water - were damaged\nor demolished. The storm also ravaged public buildings and facilities.\nMany primary schools lost roofing, classroom furniture and books. Outer\nisland clinics and dispensaries suffered damage similar to the schools,\nwith roofs torn off, windows smashed and medical equipment lost or\ndamaged. Airport runways were eroded by waves, which in some cases\nwashed across the entire atoll from shore to shore. Storage warehouses\nfor copra - the main cash crop - were also wrecked or damaged. Docks,\nboat ramps and harbor facilities sustained damage as well. Many boats\nwere lost or sunk, and much fishing equipment was ruined; this was a\nsevere loss, given the key role of fishing in the economy of the atolls.\n\nB.\t\n\nThe Government's Response\n\n16. The Government responded quickly in the aftermath of the\ntyphoon, conducting its own assessment of the damage and sending relief\nsupplies by plane and ship to the atolls most seriously affected. After\nthe President declared a disaster on 18 November, the National Disaster\nPlan was activated and a Disaster Assistance Committee (DAC) was set up,\nchaired by the Chief Secretary. Funds reserved for natural disasters,\nunder the Disaster Assistance Act of 1987, have been released for\nemergency expenditures in the amount of $200,000. On each of the\naffected atolls, local disaster committees have been formed to report to\nthe Government in Majuro on the needs and damage. These local committees\nare headed up by the mayors and include members of the island councils.\n\nC.\t\n\nExternal Assistance\n\n17. In addition to the self-help measures outlined above, the\nGovernment has requested international assistance from the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme/United Nations Disaster Relief Office, Australia,\nNew Zealand, United States, France and the Bank. Through the Federal\n\n\fEmergency Management Administration (FEMA), the U.S. is expected to\ncontribute about $2.5 million in long-term assistance - mainly for\nhousing and infrastructure rehabilitation - in addition to food aid and\ntents for short-term relief J' The Bank assistance - concentrating on\nrehabilitation activities in agriculture and fisheries and on repair of\nschools and clinics - will complement other external assistance.\nContributions from other countries and the United Nations are expected\nto be below $100,000.\n\nD.\t\n\nEconomic Rehabilitation\n\n18. Complete rehabilitation and restoration of social services is\nestimated by the Bank to cost about $3.2 million, of which about\n$0.2 million will be financed by the Government from its own resources,\n$0.5 million will be financed by the Bank and $2.5 million by FEMA.\n\n19. Covering the atolls and islands of Mejit, Wotho, Likiep, Wotje,\nAiluk, Bikini, Enewetak, Aur, Maloelap, Ujelang and Utirik, the Project\nincludes provision of:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\nconstruction materials for the restoration and improvement of\nschools, clinics and health facilities, community centers and\ntransport infrastructure;\n\nagricultural tools and equipment, including seedlings and other\nmaterials for replanting and cultivation;\n\nfisheries equipment;\n\ncivil and remedial works for accomplishing the above\nobjectives; and\n\n(v)\n\nair and sea freight and other transport costs for the above\nequipment and materials.\n\n20.\t\nadvanced, is expected to be completed by 31 January 1994.\n\nThe rehabilitation and restoration work, which is well\n\nIV. THE PROGRAM\n\nA. Loan Assistance and Terms\n\nIt is proposed that the Bank provide a loan of SDR 364,000\n21.\t\n($500 , 000 equivalent) to finance part of the rehabilitation. The\nBorrower will be the Republic of the Marshall Islands. The loan will be\nprovided from the Bank's Special Funds resources and will carry a service\n\nl Under the provisions of the Compact of Free Association, U.S. President George Bush\ndeclared a disaster in MAR on 16 December 1992, thus making the country eligible for\nFEMA assistance.\n\n\f6\n\ncharge of 1 per cent per annum and have a maturity period of 40 years,\nincluding a 10-year grace period.\n\nB. Executing Agency\n\n22. The Office of the Chief Secretary will be the Executing Agency,\nin close coordination with the Ministry of Finance (MOF), for the\nimplementation of the rehabilitation assistance. It will be assisted at\nthe operational level by the DAC, which will manage the Government's\nefforts and the international assistance. The Office of the Chief\nSecretary will work directly with local governments and island councils\nto ensure distribution of the item financed under the loan.\n\nC.\t\n\nEligible Items\n\n23. The proceeds of the Loan will be utilized to finance the\nexpenditures for items listed below and for the cost of civil works under\nthe Project.\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nconstruction materials, including cement, concrete, sand,\nglass, wood, reinforcement bars, roofing, tools and other\nbuilding materials normally used;\n\nagricultural equipment and tools, including equipment and\nmachinery for clearing storm debris from agricultural areas,\nand seedlings and other material for replanting and\ncultivation;\n\n(iii)\n\nfisheries equipment, including small boats and motors, nets,\nfloats and fishing gear;\n\n(iv)\n\ncomputer equipment for the use of DAC; and\n\nCv)\t\n\ncustomary spares and ancillary equipment for the above.\n\n24. Procurement under the loan will be carried out in accordance\nwith the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. Eligible items must be\nproduced in and procured from Bank member countries.\n\nD.\t\n\nProcurement\n\nE.\t\n\nDisbursement\n\n25.\nprocured since 8 December 1992.\n\nRetroactive financing will be permitted for eligible items\n\n26.\nDisbursements will follow regular Bank guidelines. In\nconsultation with the Bank, the Borrower may also establish an imprest\naccount at a commercial bank in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on\nImprest Account and Statement of Expenditure Procedures. Payments from\nthe imprest account may be liquidated by submitting to the Bank\napplications for liquidation either (i) with supporting documents (such\n\n\t\n\f7\n\nas invoices, evidence of payment, evidence of delivery) or (b) with a\nStatement of Expenditures in lieu of usual documentation for items below\n$20,000 equivalent, showing, inter alia, that the procured items were\n(a) eligible items and (b) produced in and procured from Bank member\ncountries.\n\nF.\t\n\nAccounts, Re ports and Audit\n\n27. The MOF will record and account for the expenditures under the\nloan. It will also provide the Bank every two months with progress\nreports on the implementation of the loan and an analysis of problems\nencountered and steps taken to remedy them. Within  six months of the\nclosing date of the loan, MOF will furnish the Bank with audited copies\nof a Statement of Receipts and Disbursements covering any imprest\naccount.\n\n28.\t\nprocurement, rehabilitation and civil works, and disbursement.\n\nThe Bank will monitor implementation closely, including\n\nG. Monitoring\n\nH.\t\n\nConsultin g Services\n\n29.\nloan.\n\nConsulting services are not expected to be funded under the\n\nV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\n\nTechnical assistance will complement the proposed loan by\n30.\nhelping MAR to manage its future responses to typhoons and other natural\ndisasters in a more efficient manner, with faster processing of requests\nfor help from the stricken areas and higher awareness by local\nauthorities of the information necessary in a disaster situation.\nUltimately a greater state of readiness will result in faster delivery\nof emergency aid to the people; lessening of disaster impact; and more\nefficient delivery of long-term disaster rehabilitation both in the\naffected atolls and at the Central Government level.\n\nIn 1991/92, MAR has experienced an unusual number of typhoon-\n31.\nrelated natural disasters. Considerable damage resulted in all parts of\nthe country due to the combined destruction of typhoons Zelda, Axel and\nGay. Damage to food crops and housing could have been minimized if\ncommunities had undertaken key mitigation actions. Moreover, better\nforeknowledge and preparedness by both the Central Government and local\ncommunities would have helped to shorten the period of widespread\ndisaster-related problems. While future natural disasters are\nunpredictable, the experience of the past year has shown that mitigation\nactivities need to be well designed and implemented rapidly to avoid\nunnecessary hardship.\n\n\fA.\t\n\nPast Mitigation Efforts\n\n8\n\nWith modernization, social and economic changes have been\n32.\t\nreflected in the type of housing material now being used and the methods\nfor producing crops. As a result, both crops and dwellings are\nincreasingly vulnerable to damage, which is costly at both the household\nand the national level. The general mitigation and management response\nat the national level has not kept pace with the modernization process\nin the main towns and the outer islands. Recently a consensus among\nGovernment officials has emerged that it would be advisable to strengthen\nthe planning and delivery of such services. The Government is obligated\nunder the Compact of Free Association with the United States to provide\nFEMA with a hazard mitigation plan. The last plan, prepared in 1987,\nneeds to be updated.\n\nB.\t\n\nNeed for the Technical Assistance\n\nBecause the economy operates in a fragile ecological\n33.\nenvironment, disaster mitigation, planning and management could play a\nkey role in national economic development. Preventing or lessening the\nimpact of typhoons would serve as an important economic support. MAR\nshould increase its self-reliance in this area. Usually the people that\nsuffer the most economic loss are those in areas that can least afford\nit. New businesses and cottage industries in the outer atolls, for\ninstance, cannot afford to rebuild, as they are still in the start-up\nphase. Frequent losses to disasters also place a strain on the limited\nresources of the national treasury.\n\nThe newly created Office of the National Disaster Coordinator,\n34.\nunder the Office of the Chief Secretary, is a modest operation staffed\nby one person. The coordinator took up his post in November 1992, and\nthere is a need for additional training, especially in the area of\ndisaster management and mitigation. It is advisable for MAR to have a\ncadre of trained people to fill existing gaps in the national disaster\nmanagement structure. The TA will concentrate on institutional\nstrengthening at the national level while training local officials to\nwork in the event of future disasters.\n\nC.\t\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n35.\t\n\nThe principal objectives of the TA are the following:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\nto train the National Disaster Coordinator in knowledge and\nskills to develop and manage disaster mitigation activities\nwith both international and Government agencies;\n\nto improve the effectiveness of the DAC in its coordination\nrole; and\n\nto give community leaders a better understanding of procedures\nto be followed in case of disasters and to identify specific\nhazards to infrastructure, housing, fisheries and food crops.\n\n\f9\n\nA comprehensive program approach is advisable, containing the\n36.\nfollowing components: (1) staff training for the National Disaster\nCoordinator and working members of DAC; (ii) drafting a disaster\nmanagement and mitigation manual for future use to improve the\nGovernment's response at all stages, from disaster warnings through to\nthe rehabilitation period; (iii) on-site workshops on disaster mitigation\nand management for outer island mayors and other key personnel;\n(iv) development of a country profile concentrating on the compilation\nof important information needed in time of disaster; (v) making\nrecoimnendations concerning institution building, policy response,\ndisaster mitigation for increased shoreline protection, improved adverse\nweather warning communications systems and techniques for outer islands\nand atolls, storm surge channel construction, equipment preparation, and\ncomputer software for hazard mapping and vulnerability analysis; and\n(vi) integration of disaster mitigation concerns into national\ndevelopment planning, including policy formulation.\n\nIf the proposed loan is approved by the Board of Directors, I,\n37.\nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, shall approve\nthe provision of technical assistance to the Government in an amount not\nexceeding $150,000. This technical assistance will be provided as a\ngrant.\n\nVI. LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY\n\nA draft Loan Agreement (Special Operations) between the\n38.\nRepublic of the Marshall Islands and the Bank is circulated herewith.\nThe provisions of the Bank's Special Operations Loan Regulations dated\n7 December 1982 are incorporated in the Loan Agreement (Special\nOperations) subject to the modification set forth in Section 1.01 of the\ndraft.

The loan will have a term of 40 years\nincluding a grace period of 10 years, with a service chargeof 1 per cent\nper annum. The assistance is proposed under the Bank's emergency\nrehabilitation facility for small developing member countries (DMCs),!'\nwhich provides for a loan of up to $500,000 in the event of a disaster.\nThe facility involves abbreviated loan processing and approval\nprocedures. The Report also describes a technical assistance (TA) grant\nin an amount in various currencies equivalent to $150,000, applied for\nby the Government for Disaster Mitigation and Management, which I shall\napprove if the proposed loan is approved by the Board.\n\nFollowing the destruction of infrastructure and crops during\n2.\nTyphoon Gay, 17-20 November, the Government of MAR requested Bank\nassistance for an emergency rehabilitation program. The request was\nconveyed on 28 November via a facsimile message to the President. A\nFact-Finding Mission went to the field 7-16 December, visited several of\nthe stricken atolls, and conducted an assessment of the situation.\n\n3.\nthe first for emergency rehabilitation after a natural disaster.\n\nIf approved, the loan would be the Bank's second to MAR, and\n\nI. THE ECONOMY'\n\nAn Economic Report on the Republic of the Marshall Islands\n4.\n(ECR MAR 91006) was circulated to the Board of Directors on 10 April 1991\nIN .63-9 1)\n\nIn fiscal year (FY) 1992 gross domestic product (GDP) growth\n5.\nwas influenced by the economic conditions prevailing in the U.S., the\ndominant trading partner of the country, and by the contraction in\nmarketed and nonmarketed agriculture due to the effects of cyclone Zelda\nin December 1991 and cyclone Axel in January 1992. GDP growth at market\nprices slowed for the second consecutive year to an estimated 1 per cent\nin FY1992 compared with 3 per cent in FY1991 and 4.4 per cent in FY1990.\nWith consumer prices rising at about 2 per cent a year, the average\nannual real growth rate over the last two years therefore stagnated. The\n\nThe policy guidelines are laid down in Doc. R74-87. Rehabilitation Assistance to Small\nDMCs Affected by Natural Disasters, dated 17 June 1987.\n\nV\t\n\n3!\t\n\n2!\t\n\nThe mission comprised Paul McCabe, Programs Officer.\n\nSee Appendix for Basic Data.\n\n\f2\n\nslowing trend in GD? growth, coupled with rapid population growth, led\nto a contraction in GDP per capita of 0.9 per cent in FY1991 and a\nfurther 2.9 per cent in FY1992.\n\nCompensation of employees accounted for 74 per cent of GD? in\n6.\nFY1992, compared with about 55 per cent at the beginning of the 1980s.\nWhile the compensation of employees in both the public and the private\nsectors has shown a steady increase because of the impact of U.S. aid and\nan increase in the level of economic activity associated with institution\nbuilding and infrastructure development, the operating surplus has shown\na declining trend since FY1989. Largely comprised of taxes on private\nenterprises and estimated nonmarket production, <the total operating\nsurplus declined from 36 per cent of GDP in FY1980 to about 22 per cent\nin FY1992. Recent efforts to improve revenues have led to indirect\ntaxes, another significant component of GD?, increasing from 8.6 per cent\nof GDP in FY1987 to over 11 per cent in FY1992. A disconcerting trend\nover this period was the corresponding increase in subsidies from 3.4 per\ncent of GDP in FY1987 to an estimated 11.0 per cent in FY1992. While\nthis reflects the expansion in public services to cater for the rapidly\nincreasing population, it underscores the need for improved cost recovery\nwithout at the same time affecting poverty reduction initiatives.\n\nPrices have generally remained stable, averaging about 2 per\n7.\ncent growth annually. This reflects prudent financial management, the\nopenness of the economy and the use of the U.S. dollar as currency.\nThere is, however, some indication of an acceleration in the inflation\nrate as indicated by the rise in the consumer price index (CPI) for\nMajuro in the first quarter of 1992 compared with the previous quarter.\nBetween these two quarters the price level increased by 4.4 per cent,\nmainly on account of price increases for imported food and fuel.\n\nUnemployment, at 12.5 per cent in 1988, will continue to worsen\n8.\nif broad-based economic growth in certain types of labor-intensive\neconomic activities is not stimulated quickly enough. With 51 per cent\nof the population under 15, additions to the labor force will certainly\ncompound the unemployment problem. As the public sector is already\noverextended, new employment opportunities will have to be generated\nmainly in the private sector.\n\nSince F'f 1990 Central Government budgetary developments have\n9.\nbeen increasingly affected by reductions in U.S. aid. The actual revenue\noutturn in FY1991 showed a decline of $6.6 million in U.S. aid to\n$45.7 million, with a corresponding two-thirds reduction in development\nexpenditures. A further reduction in aid of about $4.2 million is\nforecast for FY1992, with total U.S. grants dropping to about\n$41.5 million, some $10 million lower than the average during the first\nfive years of the Compact of Free Association. ! ' Against this\nbackground, and in order to finance priority development projects, the\nGovernment issued a third bond for $38 million in September 1991,\nguaranteed as previously against future Compact revenues. Tcio projects\nhave already been approved, and 38 more are under consideration. For the\n\n'\t\n\nDated 20 October 1986 (as amended) between MAR and the United States.\n\n\f3\n\nlonger term, the Mission was informed that the Government's main\nbudgetary priorities are to increase the mobilization of resources from\nboth domestic and foreign sources, to limit the growth of operational\nexpenditures while keeping maintenance expenditures at adequate levels,\nand to increase the allocation of resources to priority development\nareas.\n\nIn the external sector, the trade balance continues to be in\n10.\nchronic deficit, with exports on the average representing only about\n4.5 per cent of total imports. Despite the large trade deficits, the\ncurrent account in 1991 recorded sizeable surpluses, averaging about\n45 per cent of GDP. Excluding official transfers, however, the current\naccount registered large deficits, averaging over 40 per cent of CD?.\nIn the longer term, as the programmed reduction of Compact funds takes\nplace, it is vital to improve domestic production capacity in order to\nnarrow the chronic trade deficit.\n\nIn connection with its borrowing program during 1987-1991 the\n11.\ncountry entered into three Indenture of Trust and Security Agreements\nwith Irving Trust Company and the Bank of New York as trustees. Pursuant\nto these Agreements, MAR has granted a prior lien in favor of the\ntrustees with respect to a portion of payments it will be receiving from\nthe U.S. pursuant to the Compact of Free Association amounting to\napproximately $260.5 million. It is not possible for the Bank to obtain\npan passu rights in respect of these liens. The Bank therefore, as was\nthe case in its. previous loan to MAR !' has agreed that the Bank's\nnegative pledge clause will not apply in respect of these prior liens.\n\nII. BANK OPERATIONS IN THE REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS\n\nWhen MAR joined the Bank in 1990, it was classified as a Group\n12.\nA country, eligible to borrow from the Asian Development Fund. Since the\nstart of its operations in the country in 1990, the Bank has approved one\nloan from Special Funds resources, the Fisheries Development Project, in\nTechnical assistance in an amount of\nan amount of $6.95 million.\t\n$2.502 million has been provided for seven projects. The total\ncumulative disbursement as of 31 December 1992 amounted to $0.883 million\nor 9 per cent of the total available for withdrawal.\n\nIII. THE TYPHOON AND THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE\n\nA.\t\n\nExtent of Damage\n\n13.\nIslands, causing widespread destruction and damage. \t\n\nOn 17 November 1992 Typhoon Gay hit the northern Marshall\nHeavy rain and\n\nLoan No. 1102-MAR: Fisheries Development, for $6.95 million, dated 26 September 1991.\n\n\f4\n\nsustained winds up to 282 kilometers per hour (km/h), with gusts up to\n345 km/h, lasted three days. The super-storm took place toward the end\nof one of the most virulent typhoon seasons in years.\n\n14. In the afflicted areas, there was heavy damage to agriculture\nand fisheries, as well as to the limited infrastructure. These islands\nand atolls depend principally on subsistence fishing and farming of\ntraditional food crops, so economic activity was seriously affected as\na result of the typhoon. Up to 100 per cent losses of homes and crops\ntook place in Ailuk, Mejit and Wotho, the areas most seriously affected.\nLesser damage occurred in Enewetak, Wotje, Likiep, Ujelang, Utirik, Aur,\nMaloelap and Bikini Atolls. More than 300 homes were destroyed or\nheavily damaged; small businesses were seriously affected; and\ntraditional food crops were ruined by wind and contamination from salt\nwater where they were not destroyed. Since the outer islanders depend\nprincipally on tree crops - breadfruit, pandanus, banana and coconut -\nrehabilitation of agriculture is expected to take several years.\n\n15. Many atolls are cluttered with debris from the storm, in\nresidential and agricultural areas and on airstrips. On many atolls,\nrainwater catcbments - the principal source of fresh water - were damaged\nor demolished. The storm also ravaged public buildings and facilities.\nMany primary schools lost roofing, classroom furniture and books. Outer\nisland clinics and dispensaries suffered damage similar to the schools,\nwith roofs torn off, windows smashed and medical equipment lost or\ndamaged. Airport runways were eroded by waves, which in some cases\nwashed across the entire atoll from shore to shore. Storage warehouses\nfor copra - the main cash crop - were also wrecked or damaged. Docks,\nboat ramps and harbor facilities sustained damage as well. Many boats\nwere lost or sunk, and much fishing equipment was ruined; this was a\nsevere loss, given the key role of fishing in the economy of the atolls.\n\nB.\t\n\nThe Government's Response\n\n16. The Government responded quickly in the aftermath of the\ntyphoon, conducting its own assessment of the damage and sending relief\nsupplies by plane and ship to the atolls most seriously affected. After\nthe President declared a disaster on 18 November, the National Disaster\nPlan was activated and a Disaster Assistance Committee (DAC) was set up,\nchaired by the Chief Secretary. Funds reserved for natural disasters,\nunder the Disaster Assistance Act of 1987, have been released for\nemergency expenditures in the amount of $200,000. On each of the\naffected atolls, local disaster committees have been formed to report to\nthe Government in Majuro on the needs and damage. These local committees\nare headed up by the mayors and include members of the island councils.\n\nC.\t\n\nExternal Assistance\n\n17. In addition to the self-help measures outlined above, the\nGovernment has requested international assistance from the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme/United Nations Disaster Relief Office, Australia,\nNew Zealand, United States, France and the Bank. Through the Federal\n\n\fEmergency Management Administration (FEMA), the U.S. is expected to\ncontribute about $2.5 million in long-term assistance - mainly for\nhousing and infrastructure rehabilitation - in addition to food aid and\ntents for short-term relief J' The Bank assistance - concentrating on\nrehabilitation activities in agriculture and fisheries and on repair of\nschools and clinics - will complement other external assistance.\nContributions from other countries and the United Nations are expected\nto be below $100,000.\n\nD.\t\n\nEconomic Rehabilitation\n\n18. Complete rehabilitation and restoration of social services is\nestimated by the Bank to cost about $3.2 million, of which about\n$0.2 million will be financed by the Government from its own resources,\n$0.5 million will be financed by the Bank and $2.5 million by FEMA.\n\n19. Covering the atolls and islands of Mejit, Wotho, Likiep, Wotje,\nAiluk, Bikini, Enewetak, Aur, Maloelap, Ujelang and Utirik, the Project\nincludes provision of:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\nconstruction materials for the restoration and improvement of\nschools, clinics and health facilities, community centers and\ntransport infrastructure;\n\nagricultural tools and equipment, including seedlings and other\nmaterials for replanting and cultivation;\n\nfisheries equipment;\n\ncivil and remedial works for accomplishing the above\nobjectives; and\n\n(v)\n\nair and sea freight and other transport costs for the above\nequipment and materials.\n\n20.\t\nadvanced, is expected to be completed by 31 January 1994.\n\nThe rehabilitation and restoration work, which is well\n\nIV. THE PROGRAM\n\nA. Loan Assistance and Terms\n\nIt is proposed that the Bank provide a loan of SDR 364,000\n21.\t\n($500 , 000 equivalent) to finance part of the rehabilitation. The\nBorrower will be the Republic of the Marshall Islands. The loan will be\nprovided from the Bank's Special Funds resources and will carry a service\n\nl Under the provisions of the Compact of Free Association, U.S. President George Bush\ndeclared a disaster in MAR on 16 December 1992, thus making the country eligible for\nFEMA assistance.\n\n\f6\n\ncharge of 1 per cent per annum and have a maturity period of 40 years,\nincluding a 10-year grace period.\n\nB. Executing Agency\n\n22. The Office of the Chief Secretary will be the Executing Agency,\nin close coordination with the Ministry of Finance (MOF), for the\nimplementation of the rehabilitation assistance. It will be assisted at\nthe operational level by the DAC, which will manage the Government's\nefforts and the international assistance. The Office of the Chief\nSecretary will work directly with local governments and island councils\nto ensure distribution of the item financed under the loan.\n\nC.\t\n\nEligible Items\n\n23. The proceeds of the Loan will be utilized to finance the\nexpenditures for items listed below and for the cost of civil works under\nthe Project.\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nconstruction materials, including cement, concrete, sand,\nglass, wood, reinforcement bars, roofing, tools and other\nbuilding materials normally used;\n\nagricultural equipment and tools, including equipment and\nmachinery for clearing storm debris from agricultural areas,\nand seedlings and other material for replanting and\ncultivation;\n\n(iii)\n\nfisheries equipment, including small boats and motors, nets,\nfloats and fishing gear;\n\n(iv)\n\ncomputer equipment for the use of DAC; and\n\nCv)\t\n\ncustomary spares and ancillary equipment for the above.\n\n24. Procurement under the loan will be carried out in accordance\nwith the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. Eligible items must be\nproduced in and procured from Bank member countries.\n\nD.\t\n\nProcurement\n\nE.\t\n\nDisbursement\n\n25.\nprocured since 8 December 1992.\n\nRetroactive financing will be permitted for eligible items\n\n26.\nDisbursements will follow regular Bank guidelines. In\nconsultation with the Bank, the Borrower may also establish an imprest\naccount at a commercial bank in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on\nImprest Account and Statement of Expenditure Procedures. Payments from\nthe imprest account may be liquidated by submitting to the Bank\napplications for liquidation either (i) with supporting documents (such\n\n\t\n\f7\n\nas invoices, evidence of payment, evidence of delivery) or (b) with a\nStatement of Expenditures in lieu of usual documentation for items below\n$20,000 equivalent, showing, inter alia, that the procured items were\n(a) eligible items and (b) produced in and procured from Bank member\ncountries.\n\nF.\t\n\nAccounts, Re ports and Audit\n\n27. The MOF will record and account for the expenditures under the\nloan. It will also provide the Bank every two months with progress\nreports on the implementation of the loan and an analysis of problems\nencountered and steps taken to remedy them. Within  six months of the\nclosing date of the loan, MOF will furnish the Bank with audited copies\nof a Statement of Receipts and Disbursements covering any imprest\naccount.\n\n28.\t\nprocurement, rehabilitation and civil works, and disbursement.\n\nThe Bank will monitor implementation closely, including\n\nG. Monitoring\n\nH.\t\n\nConsultin g Services\n\n29.\nloan.\n\nConsulting services are not expected to be funded under the\n\nV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\n\nTechnical assistance will complement the proposed loan by\n30.\nhelping MAR to manage its future responses to typhoons and other natural\ndisasters in a more efficient manner, with faster processing of requests\nfor help from the stricken areas and higher awareness by local\nauthorities of the information necessary in a disaster situation.\nUltimately a greater state of readiness will result in faster delivery\nof emergency aid to the people; lessening of disaster impact; and more\nefficient delivery of long-term disaster rehabilitation both in the\naffected atolls and at the Central Government level.\n\nIn 1991/92, MAR has experienced an unusual number of typhoon-\n31.\nrelated natural disasters. Considerable damage resulted in all parts of\nthe country due to the combined destruction of typhoons Zelda, Axel and\nGay. Damage to food crops and housing could have been minimized if\ncommunities had undertaken key mitigation actions. Moreover, better\nforeknowledge and preparedness by both the Central Government and local\ncommunities would have helped to shorten the period of widespread\ndisaster-related problems. While future natural disasters are\nunpredictable, the experience of the past year has shown that mitigation\nactivities need to be well designed and implemented rapidly to avoid\nunnecessary hardship.\n\n\fA.\t\n\nPast Mitigation Efforts\n\n8\n\nWith modernization, social and economic changes have been\n32.\t\nreflected in the type of housing material now being used and the methods\nfor producing crops. As a result, both crops and dwellings are\nincreasingly vulnerable to damage, which is costly at both the household\nand the national level. The general mitigation and management response\nat the national level has not kept pace with the modernization process\nin the main towns and the outer islands. Recently a consensus among\nGovernment officials has emerged that it would be advisable to strengthen\nthe planning and delivery of such services. The Government is obligated\nunder the Compact of Free Association with the United States to provide\nFEMA with a hazard mitigation plan. The last plan, prepared in 1987,\nneeds to be updated.\n\nB.\t\n\nNeed for the Technical Assistance\n\nBecause the economy operates in a fragile ecological\n33.\nenvironment, disaster mitigation, planning and management could play a\nkey role in national economic development. Preventing or lessening the\nimpact of typhoons would serve as an important economic support. MAR\nshould increase its self-reliance in this area. Usually the people that\nsuffer the most economic loss are those in areas that can least afford\nit. New businesses and cottage industries in the outer atolls, for\ninstance, cannot afford to rebuild, as they are still in the start-up\nphase. Frequent losses to disasters also place a strain on the limited\nresources of the national treasury.\n\nThe newly created Office of the National Disaster Coordinator,\n34.\nunder the Office of the Chief Secretary, is a modest operation staffed\nby one person. The coordinator took up his post in November 1992, and\nthere is a need for additional training, especially in the area of\ndisaster management and mitigation. It is advisable for MAR to have a\ncadre of trained people to fill existing gaps in the national disaster\nmanagement structure. The TA will concentrate on institutional\nstrengthening at the national level while training local officials to\nwork in the event of future disasters.\n\nC.\t\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n35.\t\n\nThe principal objectives of the TA are the following:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\nto train the National Disaster Coordinator in knowledge and\nskills to develop and manage disaster mitigation activities\nwith both international and Government agencies;\n\nto improve the effectiveness of the DAC in its coordination\nrole; and\n\nto give community leaders a better understanding of procedures\nto be followed in case of disasters and to identify specific\nhazards to infrastructure, housing, fisheries and food crops.\n\n\f9\n\nA comprehensive program approach is advisable, containing the\n36.\nfollowing components: (1) staff training for the National Disaster\nCoordinator and working members of DAC; (ii) drafting a disaster\nmanagement and mitigation manual for future use to improve the\nGovernment's response at all stages, from disaster warnings through to\nthe rehabilitation period; (iii) on-site workshops on disaster mitigation\nand management for outer island mayors and other key personnel;\n(iv) development of a country profile concentrating on the compilation\nof important information needed in time of disaster; (v) making\nrecoimnendations concerning institution building, policy response,\ndisaster mitigation for increased shoreline protection, improved adverse\nweather warning communications systems and techniques for outer islands\nand atolls, storm surge channel construction, equipment preparation, and\ncomputer software for hazard mapping and vulnerability analysis; and\n(vi) integration of disaster mitigation concerns into national\ndevelopment planning, including policy formulation.\n\nIf the proposed loan is approved by the Board of Directors, I,\n37.\nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, shall approve\nthe provision of technical assistance to the Government in an amount not\nexceeding $150,000. This technical assistance will be provided as a\ngrant.\n\nVI. LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY\n\nA draft Loan Agreement (Special Operations) between the\n38.\nRepublic of the Marshall Islands and the Bank is circulated herewith.\nThe provisions of the Bank's Special Operations Loan Regulations dated\n7 December 1982 are incorporated in the Loan Agreement (Special\nOperations) subject to the modification set forth in Section 1.01 of the\ndraft. Under its laws the Republic of the Marshall Islands is empowered\nto borrow from the Bank. I am satisfied that the proposed Loan would\ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank.\n\n\f10\n\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\n\n39. I recommend that the Board approve the proposed loan from the\nBank's Special Funds resources to the Republic of the Marshall Islands\nfor Emergency Typhoon Rehabilitation Assistance in an amount in various\ncurrencies equivalent to SDR 364,000, with a service charge at a rate of\n1 per cent per annum, and carrying such other terms and conditions as are\nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan\nAgreement presented to the Board.\n\n18 January 1993\n\nKIMIMASA TARt.JMIZU\nPresident\n\n\f------------------------------------------------------------------------I -----------! -----------! ---------! ---------\n\nBASIC DATA SHEET OF MARSHALL ISLANDS\n\nAs of 21 Decenter 1992\n\n1960\t\n\n1970\t\n\nI Recent !
