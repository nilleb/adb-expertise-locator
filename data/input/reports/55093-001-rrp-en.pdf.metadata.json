GLANCE \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n \n1. \nThe transaction involves the administration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of an \nequity investment of up to $4,000,000, with an initial investment of up to $2,500,000, in Skycatch, \nInc. in the United States (US), to be provided by the ADB Ventures Investment Fund 11 under the \nADB Ventures Financing Partnership Facility. The balance of the approved equity amount may \nbe invested in subsequent fundraising rounds that Skycatch is expected to undertake. Consistent \nwith the establishment arrangements for the fund, ADB will not invest its own capital alongside \nthe  fund.2 This  is  a  regional  transaction,  with  impact  expected  in  multiple  developing  member \ncountries  (DMCs)  across  Asia  and  the  Pacific.  The  ADB\u2019s  equity  proceeds  will  be  used  for \nSkycatch\u2019s business expansions in DMCs only. \n \nSkycatch\u2019s  core  business  is  providing  industry-leading  technology  for  fast  and  reliable \n2. \nthree-dimensional (3D) drone data capture, processing, visualization, and analysis. Its technology \nenables infrastructure project clients to improve planning and operational efficiency significantly, \nthereby cutting costs and lead times and reducing environmental waste and carbon dioxide (CO2) \nemissions.  Skycatch  is  operating  in  multiple  DMCs,  including  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China, \nIndonesia, Nauru (para. 11), the Philippines, and Thailand. Confidential information deleted. The \ndevelopment  impact  of Skycatch\u2019s  technology  aligns  with  ADB\u2019s  operational  priorities to  tackle \nclimate change, build climate and disaster resilience, and enhance environmental sustainability \nin Asia and the Pacific.3  \n \n\n \n\nTHE INVESTMENT \n\n \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n \n3. \nInfrastructure projects. Emerging Asia\u2019s infrastructure market will account for about 60% \nof the world total by 2037.4 The global infrastructure industry is a significant contributor to global \nCO2 emissions, while facing major challenges in terms of project delays and cost overruns. For \nexample, an estimated 90% of large construction projects face cost overruns (on average 80% \nhigher than original estimates) and schedule delays (on average 20 months).5 The construction \nindustry  accounted  for  11%  of  global  CO2  emissions  in  2018  and  is  a  major  contributor  to \nenvironmental pollution.6  \n \n4. \nAerial surveying of infrastructure projects. Drone technology can play a critical role in \nimproving the performance of infrastructure projects in DMCs. Project site supervisors depend on \nhuman observations, which are prone to error and often costly. This leads to difficulties in tracking \nproject progress in real time and the early detection of problems. The outcome is often protracted \nproject delays resulting in massive waste and declines in productivity, efficiency, and profit. The \nuse  of  drone  technology  for  high-precision  aerial  surveying  and  digital  3D  mapping  of \ninfrastructure  projects  allows for more  accurate, detailed,  and frequent tracking throughout  the \n\n \n\n1  Financing  partner:  Clean  Technology  Fund,  Nordic  Development  Fund,  and  the  governments  of  Finland  and  the \nRepublic of Korea. As provided in para. 52 of ADB. 2015. Enhancing Operational Efficiency of the Asian Development \nBank.  Manila,  the  President  is  \u201cauthorized  to  approve  the  establishment  of  trust  funds  and  FPFs  [financing \npartnership facility], or participation in GFIs [global funding initiative]; acceptance of contributions from any financing \npartner; and administration of cofinancing for any operation.\u201d \n\n2  ADB. 2020.

The  potential  benefits  include  significant  cost  and  time  savings,  reduced \nwastage through smarter use of resources, and improved safety. \n \n5. \nCompetitive advantages and market size. Skycatch\u2019s platform for capturing processing \nand analyzing high-precision 3D drone data offers industry-leading accuracy and speed, as well \nas  deep  integration  with  the  clients\u2019  existing  workflows.  Confidential  information  deleted.  The \npotential market opportunity is estimated at $70 billion per annum.7 \n \nBusiness  strategy  and  rationale.  Skycatch  is  offering  a  combination  of  software  and \n6. \nhardware for capturing, processing, visualizing, and analyzing high-precision 3D drone data. The \nsolution  is  provided  as  a  Software-as-a-Service  (SaaS)-based  model,  offering  an  increasingly \nstable stream of annual recurring revenue (ARR). Skycatch is planning an aggressive expansion \ninto  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  confidential  information  deleted.  The  investment  in  Skycatch  will \n(i) enable more rapid expansion and rollout of Skycatch\u2019s solutions across DMCs in Asia and the \nPacific; (ii) develop new use cases and products targeting the specific needs of DMCs; and (iii) \nexpand its global technical support operations, confidential information deleted.  \n  \n\n \n\nOwnership and Management \n\nOwnership. Skycatch was founded in 2013 by Christian Sanz, who is the current chief \n\n \n7. \nexecutive officer. Confidential information deleted.  \n \n8. \nManagement. The management team is experienced and well qualified, with varied senior \nroles in both early-stage companies and Fortune 100 companies. Christian Sanz has a record of \nbeing in technical and leadership positions at companies that have scaled up successfully. ADB \nconducted integrity due diligence. Skycatch, its shareholders, and its management do not appear \nto constitute a significant or potentially significant integrity risk. ADB\u2019s review of Skycatch does \nnot give ADB cause to believe that it is being used for money laundering, terrorism financing, tax \nsecrecy, tax evasion, or tax fraud. Tax integrity due diligence was not required.8  \n \n\n \n\nFinancial Performance \n\n \nSkycatch  is  transitioning  from  a  focus  on  technology  and  product  development  to \n9. \naggressive  sales  and  growth.    ARR  has  increased  consistently  since  FY2019  confidential \ninformation deleted.  \n \nThe  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic  had  an  initial  adverse  impact  on  the \n10. \nbusiness, resulting in delays to contracts and supply-chain disruptions. Confidential information \ndeleted.  Skycatch  has  since  recovered,  however,  and  has  gained  significant  traction  and \nmomentum with new and existing clients as the pandemic has caused  confidential information \ndeleted companies to operate either remotely or with minimally staffed crews.  \n \n\n7  This is based on market research by Kotmatsu which estimates that there are over 15 million potential infrastructure \n\n8  ADB. 2003.

The investment will \nbe in the form of new equity (through a fresh issuance of shares), confidential information deleted. \nConfidential information deleted. ADB expects to mobilize parallel equity financing of at least $5 \nmillion during 2021\u20132024. ADB will have the right to nominate an observer to the company\u2019s board \nof directors, and is expected to provide support to help strengthen governance and incorporate \nmeasures  to  address  gender  equality  directly  in  Skycatch\u2019s  business  activities.  ADB  will  also \nleverage its operational networks to help Skycatch connect with new customers and validate its \ntechnology solution on infrastructure projects in emerging markets in Asia and the Pacific. For \nexample, ADB has become a client of Skycatch on a climate-resilient port project in Nauru.9  \n \n12. \nIn line with the ADB Ventures Financing Partnership Facility, the share purchase price will \nbe based on a valuation approved by the fund investment committee and will be the same as the \nprice per share to be paid by the coinvestors in the same equity round.

Possible exit options include a sale to a strategic acquirer looking to expand \nits  offerings  and  access  to  the  construction,  infrastructure,  software,  or  drone  manufacturing \nindustries. The company may, upon achieving certain milestones, opt to file for an initial public \noffering in the US. As part of the investment, ADB will have standard market exit rights.  \n \n14. \nReporting arrangements. ADB will monitor the investment. Investment reporting will be \nsubject  to  information  disclosure  requirements,  in  addition  to  compliance  with  US  legal  and \nregulatory  requirements.  Skycatch  will  provide  ADB  with  financial  reports  at  predetermined \nregular  intervals  and  on  request,  including  (i)  a  report  on  using  the  subscription  proceeds, \n(ii) quarterly  and  annual  financial  statements  for  the  past  period,  and  (iii)  annual  budget  and \nbusiness plans for the following fiscal year. \n \nUse  of  proceeds.  Skycatch  will  use  the  investment  proceeds  to  finance  its  business \n15. \ngrowth in emerging Asia and the Pacific by expanding its DMC-focused business development \nactivities  and  its  global  technical  and  customer  support  office  confidential  information  deleted. \nSkycatch  will  also  invest  in  technology  and  product  development,  to  expand  the  potential  use \ncases for projects related to climate change, environmental assessments, and safety in DMCs. \n \n16. \nThe first report will be submitted no later than 12 months after the first disbursement. \n \n\nEvaluation. Skycatch will prepare and submit monitoring reports to ADB at least annually. \n\n \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n \n17. \nCatalyzing technology solutions that reduce the carbon footprint of infrastructure \nprojects in Asia and the Pacific. ADB\u2019s investment in Skycatch will encourage the evolving field \nof  aerial  surveying  and  visualization  data  technology,  which  is  critical  in  reducing  the  carbon \n\n9  ADB,  Nauru:  Digital  Twin  Capabilities  in  Project  Management;  ADB,  Nauru:  Sustainable  and  Climate-Resilient \n\nConnectivity Project. \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\ffootprint of infrastructure projects\u2014including construction and renewable energy\u2014that is critical \nto addressing climate change in Asia and the Pacific. ADB can play a critical role in encouraging \nthe  adoption  of  innovative  technologies  in  these sectors,  as  it  is  a major financier  and  partner \nacross  numerous  infrastructure  projects  in  Asia and the  Pacific.  By  leveraging  ADB\u2019s  network, \nSkycatch will be catalytic in establishing visualization data technology as a staple in infrastructure \nprojects. Confidential information deleted.  \n \n18. \nResource  mobilization.  This  investment  is  anticipated  to  have  a  significant  signaling \neffect and is likely to increase the market\u2019s confidence in Skycatch\u2019s ability to achieve its business \ngoals.  This  will  help  Skycatch  in  critical  areas,  such  as  developing  and  testing  new  products, \nattracting new DMC-focused clients, and attracting future debt and equity. \n \nProgress  to  market-leading  standards.  As  the  first  and  only  development  finance \n19. \ninstitution  shareholder,  ADB  will  help  develop  and  support  Skycatch\u2019s  adherence  to  high \ncorporate  governance  and  integrity  standards,  as  well  as  its  adoption  of  market-leading  social \nand  environmental  standards,  with  potential  demonstration  effects  in  both  the  emerging  Asian \nmarkets  and  the  developed  markets.  ADB  will  also  add  value  to  Skycatch  by  assisting  it  to \n(i) establish  a  more  balanced  board,  (ii)  implement  an  environmental  and  social  management \nsystem, and (iii) incorporate gender-inclusive workplace policies. \n \nEquality.  This  investment  will  help  Skycatch  implement  gender  actions  to  promote \n20. \nwomen\u2019s economic empowerment by enhancing gender responsiveness in its workplace and its \nbusiness activities. It will also contribute to increasing women\u2019s skills and work opportunities in \nthe  construction  high-technology  industry,  and  thus  address  the  gender gap  in  the  industry  by \nincreasing  women\u2019s  participation  in  its  customer  trainings  and  internship  programs.  ADB  is \ncoinvesting  in  Skycatch  with  a  LGBT+  angel  investor  syndicate  group,  and  anticipates  this \ninvestment will help address issues of sexual harassment in the workplace and increase future \nfemale and/or LGBT+ board representation.  \n \n\nRisks \n\n \nConfidential information deleted.  \n \n\n \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n \n21. \nThe  investment  is  aligned  with  the  commitment  of  DMC  governments  to  achieve \nSustainable  Development  Goal  13  (climate  action)  10  through  Nationally  Determined \nContributions  under  the  Paris  Agreement.11 The  investment\u2019s  expected  outcome  is  increased \ncommercial  use  of  drones  and  data  processing  technology  in  infrastructure  projects  including \nconstruction and renewable energy industries, reduces greenhouse gas emissions.
