The transaction involves the administration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of an \nequity investment of up to $4,000,000, with an initial investment of up to $2,500,000, in Skycatch, \nInc. in the United States (US), to be provided by the ADB Ventures Investment Fund 11 under the \nADB Ventures Financing Partnership Facility. The balance of the approved equity amount may \nbe invested in subsequent fundraising rounds that Skycatch is expected to undertake. Consistent \nwith the establishment arrangements for the fund, ADB will not invest its own capital alongside \nthe fund.2 This is a regional transaction, with impact expected in multiple developing member \ncountries (DMCs) across Asia and the Pacific. The ADB\u2019s equity proceeds will be used for \nSkycatch\u2019s business expansions in DMCs only. \n \n2.  Skycatch\u2019s core business is providing industry-leading technology for fast and reliable \nthree-dimensional (3D) drone data capture, processing, visualization, and analysis. Its technology \nenables infrastructure project clients to improve planning and operational efficiency significantly, \nthereby cutting costs and lead times and reducing environmental waste and carbon dioxide (CO ) \n2\nemissions. Skycatch is operating in multiple DMCs, including the People\u2019s Republic of China, \nIndonesia, Nauru (para. 11), the Philippines, and Thailand. Confidential information deleted. The \ndevelopment impact of Skycatch\u2019s technology aligns with ADB\u2019s operational priorities to tackle \nclimate change, build climate and disaster resilience, and enhance environmental sustainability \nin Asia and the Pacific.3  \n \n  THE INVESTMENT \n \n  Project Identification and Description \n \n3.  Infrastructure projects. Emerging Asia\u2019s infrastructure market will account for about 60% \nof the world total by 2037.4 The global infrastructure industry is a significant contributor to global \nCO  emissions, while facing major challenges in terms of project delays and cost overruns. For \n2\nexample, an estimated 90% of large construction projects face cost overruns (on average 80% \nhigher than original estimates) and schedule delays (on average 20 months).5 The construction \nindustry accounted for 11% of global CO  emissions in 2018 and is a major contributor to \n2\nenvironmental pollution.6  \n \n4.  Aerial surveying of infrastructure projects. Drone technology can play a critical role in \nimproving the performance of infrastructure projects in DMCs. Project site supervisors depend on \nhuman observations, which are prone to error and often costly. This leads to difficulties in tracking \nproject progress in real time and the early detection of problems. The outcome is often protracted \nproject delays resulting in massive waste and declines in productivity, efficiency, and profit. The \nuse  of  drone  technology  for  high-precision  aerial  surveying  and  digital  3D  mapping  of \ninfrastructure projects allows for more accurate, detailed, and frequent tracking throughout the \n \n1  Financing partner: Clean Technology Fund, Nordic Development Fund, and the governments of Finland and the \nRepublic of Korea. As provided in para. 52 of ADB. 2015. Enhancing Operational Efficiency of the Asian Development \nBank.

The potential benefits include significant cost and time savings, reduced \nwastage through smarter use of resources, and improved safety. \n \n5.  Competitive advantages and market size. Skycatch\u2019s platform for capturing processing \nand analyzing high-precision 3D drone data offers industry-leading accuracy and speed, as well \nas deep integration with the clients\u2019 existing workflows. Confidential information deleted. The \npotential market opportunity is estimated at $70 billion per annum.7 \n \n6.  Business strategy and rationale. Skycatch is offering a combination of software and \nhardware for capturing, processing, visualizing, and analyzing high-precision 3D drone data. The \nsolution is provided as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)-based model, offering an increasingly \nstable stream of annual recurring revenue (ARR). Skycatch is planning an aggressive expansion \ninto Asia and the Pacific, confidential information deleted. The investment in Skycatch will \n(i) enable more rapid expansion and rollout of Skycatch\u2019s solutions across DMCs in Asia and the \nPacific; (ii) develop new use cases and products targeting the specific needs of DMCs; and (iii) \nexpand its global technical support operations, confidential information deleted.  \n  \n  Ownership and Management \n \n7.  Ownership. Skycatch was founded in 2013 by Christian Sanz, who is the current chief \nexecutive officer. Confidential information deleted.  \n \n8.  Management. The management team is experienced and well qualified, with varied senior \nroles in both early-stage companies and Fortune 100 companies. Christian Sanz has a record of \nbeing in technical and leadership positions at companies that have scaled up successfully. ADB \nconducted integrity due diligence. Skycatch, its shareholders, and its management do not appear \nto constitute a significant or potentially significant integrity risk. ADB\u2019s review of Skycatch does \nnot give ADB cause to believe that it is being used for money laundering, terrorism financing, tax \nsecrecy, tax evasion, or tax fraud. Tax integrity due diligence was not required.8  \n \n  Financial Performance \n \n9.  Skycatch  is  transitioning  from  a  focus  on  technology  and  product  development  to \naggressive  sales  and  growth.    ARR  has  increased  consistently  since  FY2019  confidential \ninformation deleted.  \n \n10.  The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic had an initial adverse impact on the \nbusiness, resulting in delays to contracts and supply-chain disruptions. Confidential information \ndeleted.  Skycatch  has  since  recovered,  however,  and  has  gained  significant  traction  and \nmomentum with new and existing clients as the pandemic has caused confidential information \ndeleted companies to operate either remotely or with minimally staffed crews.  \n \n \n7  This is based on market research by Kotmatsu which estimates that there are over 15 million potential infrastructure \nproject users in the world. \n8  ADB. 2003.

As the first and only development finance \ninstitution  shareholder,  ADB  will  help  develop  and  support  Skycatch\u2019s  adherence  to  high \ncorporate governance and integrity standards, as well as its adoption of market-leading social \nand environmental standards, with potential demonstration effects in both the emerging Asian \nmarkets and the developed markets. ADB will also add value to Skycatch by assisting it to \n(i) establish a more balanced board, (ii) implement an environmental and social management \nsystem, and (iii) incorporate gender-inclusive workplace policies. \n \n20.  Equality.  This  investment  will  help  Skycatch  implement  gender  actions  to  promote \nwomen\u2019s economic empowerment by enhancing gender responsiveness in its workplace and its \nbusiness activities. It will also contribute to increasing women\u2019s skills and work opportunities in \nthe construction high-technology industry, and thus address the gender gap in the industry by \nincreasing women\u2019s participation in its customer trainings and internship programs. ADB is \ncoinvesting in Skycatch with a LGBT+ angel investor syndicate group, and anticipates this \ninvestment will help address issues of sexual harassment in the workplace and increase future \nfemale and/or LGBT+ board representation.  \n \n  Risks \n \nConfidential information deleted.  \n \n  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \n  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n21.
