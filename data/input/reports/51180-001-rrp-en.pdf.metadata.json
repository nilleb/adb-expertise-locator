The project \nwill  include  building  institutional  capacity  of  the  state  for  road  design  and  maintenance  and \nincorporating appropriate new technologies in the state\u2019s road subsector. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nState  context.  Bihar  is  the  12th  largest  state  in  India  by  area,  covering  about  99,000 \n3. \nsquare kilometers (km2); the third most populous, with about 104 million inhabitants; and the sixth \nmost densely populated. It is in the eastern region of the country, bordering Uttar Pradesh in the \nwest, West Bengal in the east, and Jharkhand in the south. The Ganga River flows through the \nmiddle of the Bihar plain from west to east, physically dividing the state into northern and southern \nregions. The northern region is bordered by Nepal. In the past, Bihar has lagged behind other \nstates in terms of social and economic development. Based on 2011\u20132012 data, the Government \nof India estimates that 34% of Bihar\u2019s population lives below the poverty line, compared with 22% \nnationally.2 The annual per capita income in Bihar (\u20b929,178 at constant 2011 prices) was about \n35% of the national average in 2016\u20132017, compared with about 28% in 2006. With increased \ninvestment in social infrastructure and improved governance, the state aspires to grow at a faster \nrate  than  the  country  average.  In  2016\u20132017,  the  medium-term  growth  rate  for  gross  state \ndomestic product in Bihar was 10.3%, compared with 7.0% for the national economy.3 \n \n4. \nRoad network. The road network of the state comprises 226,350 km as of 2017 (Table \n1).  All  higher-class  roads\u2014national  highways,  state  highways,  and  major  district  roads\u2014are \npaved, but most rural roads are unpaved. During 2015\u20132016, in terms of road length per 100 km2, \nBihar overtook the national average\u2014219 km against 139 km. However, at 4.7 km per 100 km2, \nthe road density of state highways in Bihar is lower than the national average of 5.1 km per 100 \nkm2 and is much lower than in other developed states in India.4 \n \n\nTable 1: Road Network in Bihar \n\nLength \n(kilometer) \n\nClass of Road \n\nNo. \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \nTotal \nSource: Bihar State Road Development Corporation Limited. \n\nNational highway \nState highway \nMajor district road \nRural road \n\n4,917 \n4,006 \n11,146 \n206,281 \n226,350 \n\n                                                 \n1  Government of Bihar, RCD. 2015. Road Master Plan for Bihar\u2019s State Highway Development (2015\u20132035). Patna.  \n2  Government of India, Reserve Bank. 2018. Handbook of Statistics on Indian States, 2017\u20132018.

The number of motorized vehicles registered in the state has increased from \n5. \n1.96 million in 2009 to 5.48 million in 2016, an average annual increase of 20%. Of these, over \n74% were two-wheelers, about 7% were cars and jeeps, and the balance were other categories, \nincluding trucks and buses. The average annual vehicle growth observed during 2009\u20132016 was \nover 17% for two-wheelers and 14% for cars.5 Vehicular densities and current road conditions \nrequire road capacity improvement and upgrading, which this project primarily seeks to address. \n \n6. \nRoad  safety.  The  road  accident  fatality  rate  in  Bihar  is  much  higher  than  the  national \naverage. In 2016, 54% of road accidents in Bihar resulted in death against the national average \nof 27%. The absolute number of fatalities is likely to increase as traffic grows, having increased \nfrom  4,390  in  2009  to  4,901  in  2016.  To  counter  the  rapid  rise  in  road  accident  fatalities,  the \nproject will put stronger emphasis on road safety measures and will improve awareness through \nroad safety campaigns conducted for the affected villages. \n \n7. \nVision for road development. Bihar\u2019s vision as stated in the road master plan (2015\u2013\n2035) is \u201c(t)here shall be good transport accessibility for all populations in the State of Bihar, with \na high-quality, high-mobility road network available for the transport of people and goods.\u201d6 The \nGovernment of Bihar has stepped up investments in the development of transport infrastructure \nand has been improving the state highways and major district roads through a combination of \nbudgetary support, financial assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency, and public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs). The State Highways \nDevelopment Program aims to widen all state highways to two lanes, and to improve bridges and \ndistrict and rural roads. To achieve this, the road master plan estimates a large capital expenditure \nrequirement of $15.8 billion for road improvements until 2035. At present, approximately $8 billion \nhas been allocated for the same period. The road development master plan considers PPPs and \nsome form of cess on fuel will contribute about $4 billion. These measures are aspirational, and \nit appears likely that the master plan investments can only be partially met. The government relies \nheavily on increased budget allocations and multilateral and bilateral agency borrowing. \n \n8. \nRoad institutions. The Road Construction Department (RCD) is the nodal department \nfor the road subsector. Institutional capacity in the road subsector has been gradually built in Bihar, \nwith support from ADB in prior loans. The Bihar State Road Development Corporation Limited \n(BSRDCL) functions as a special-purpose company under the RCD, with delegated powers and \nresponsibilities. The BSRDCL has contributed significantly to the state\u2019s ability in using multilateral \nand bilateral finance, and in developing projects under PPP. \n\n \nRoad  maintenance.  In  Bihar,  the  RCD  manages  the  national  highways  (except  roads \n9. \nunder the National Highway Authority of India), state highways, and major district roads on behalf \nof  the  Government  of  Bihar.  The  RCD  is  organized  into  four  wings\u2014north  Bihar,  south  Bihar, \nnational highway, and special project\u2014which are responsible for construction and maintenance \nof roads. The RCD receives fiscal allocations from the Government of Bihar. In fiscal year (FY) \n2017, the total allocation was \u20b967.6 billion, which was about three times more than that in FY2007 \nand with an average annual increase rate of 12.1% since FY2007. Meanwhile, the funds available \nfor  road  maintenance  have  also  increased  at  a  similar  pace.  Under  the  Bihar  Road  Assets \nMaintenance  Policy  2013,  7,760  km  of  state  highways  and  major  district  roads  are  currently \nmaintained by 72 output- and performance-based road asset maintenance contracts. \n\n                                                 \n5  Government of India, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. 2018. Road Transport Yearbook, 2015\u20132016. New \n\nDelhi. \n\n6   Footnote 1, p. 3. \n \n\n \n\n\fImpact and Outcome \n\nPrevious ADB loans to the Government of Bihar. Since 2008, ADB has provided four \n10. \nloans, amounting to $1.43 billion, to upgrade about 1,453 km of state highways and to construct \na new bridge over the Ganga River near Patna.7 During the implementation of previous loans, the \nBSRDCL has gradually built institutional capacity, which is now reasonably robust. Previous loans \nhave performed well, except for time overruns related to land acquisition and termination of large \ncontracts. In the present proposal, these risks are mitigated since land acquisition is not significant \nand the size of contracts will be limited to an estimated $40 million. Advance contracting actions \nare under way for both works and supervision consultant contracts. With these measures, it is \nanticipated that the works can proceed without substantive delays. \n \n11. \nProject objectives. While the government has been progressively improving carriageway \nwidths of state highways using budgetary and multilateral financing, about 35% of these roads \nare  yet  to  meet  the  minimum  two-lane  standard.8 The  present  proposal  seeks  to  advance  this \ngovernment  program  to  upgrade  all  state  highways  to  at  least  standard  two-lane  widths  and \nimprove road safety. The roads selected in this project are from the overall master plan, based \non (i) development priorities of the government, (ii) key infrastructure roads for agriculture- and \nindustry-based  activities,  and  (iii)  the  readiness  to  implement.  The  project  roads  selected  are \nspread across Bihar\u2019s rural areas that lack reliable road connectivity, resulting in limited access \nto  health  and  educational  institutions,  commercial  facilities,  and  government  development \nagencies.  The  project  will  also  establish  a  state  institution,  proposed  by  the  RCD,  to  improve \ninstitutional capacity at a technical level and in a sustained manner. \n \nB. \n \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: road transport accessibility in the state of \n12. \nBihar improved (footnote 1). The project will have the following outcome: transport efficiency and \nsafety on selected state highways in Bihar improved.9 \n \nC. \n \n13. \nbe widened and upgraded to all-weather standards with road safety features. \n  \n14. \nOutput  2:  Bihar  Road  Research  Institute  established.  The  Bihar  Road  Research \nInstitute  (BRRI)  in  Patna  will  be  established  to  institutionalize  and  sustain  technical  and \nmanagement capacity of road agency staff. The BRRI will be operated and staffed by the RCD. \n \n15. \nValue added by ADB assistance. The project seeks to continue ADB engagement with \nthe road subsector in the state. The project is consistent with the strategic objective set out in the \ncountry partnership strategy for India, 2018\u20132022 on the development of the state core network \nof  lagging  states,  and  with  the  transport  sector  objective  of  increased,  more  efficient,  and \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2008.

For this project, the establishment of a state institution, the BRRI, is proposed \nto  institutionalize  and  sustain  technical  and  management  capacity  over  time.  The  BRRI  would \nfocus on areas such as industrial waste utilization in road construction, ground improvements, \nenvironmental pollution, road traffic safety, and road assets performance monitoring. The project \nwill include assistance in constructing facilities to house the BRRI, establishing its operations by \nbuilding capacity in areas mentioned above, and providing institutional support by preparing the \noperational plan. The RCD will fund the staffing and operations of the BRRI. Key staff of the BRRI \nwill consist of a chief engineer, two superintending engineers, three executive engineers, and four \nassistant engineers. The RCD will also provide administrative and support staff. \n \nD. \n \n16. \n \n17. \nADB will finance from its ordinary capital resources a part of the project costs for consulting \nservices and goods, service and civil works contracts, as well as recurrent costs and taxes, as \nrelevant. The project will be implemented over a 4-year period, commencing in November 2018. \nDetailed  cost  estimates  by  expenditure  category  and  by  financier  are  included  in  the  project \nadministration manual (PAM).11 \n \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $304 million (Table 2). \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nTable 2: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nB. \nC. \n \n\nState highways widened and upgraded \nBihar Road Research Institute established \nLand acquisition, resettlement, and rehabilitation \nConsulting services \nProject management \nSubtotal (A) \n\nBase Costb \n1.  \n2.  \n3.  \n4.  \n5.  \n \nContingenciesc \nFinancial Charges During Implementationd \nTotal (A+B+C) \n \n\n \n\nAmounta \n\n  \n220.0 \n10.0 \n23.0 \n10.5 \n5.5 \n269.0 \n21.0 \n14.0 \n304.0 \n\na  Includes taxes and duties of $25.08 million to be financed from government resources by cash contribution and the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB).

The economic assessment and due diligence on \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguards  were  conducted  to  ensure  that  the  design  complies  with \nADB requirements. The engineering designs were prepared to avoid land acquisition, minimize \nsocial and environmental impacts, incorporate road safety, and mitigate identified climate change \nrisks,  particularly  extreme  flooding.  To  mitigate  climate  change  risks,  adaptation  will  include \nraising  embankment  heights,  increasing  vent  of  culverts,  improving  drains,  and  increasing  the \nheight of bridges. In addition, advance actions were taken to ensure that construction can start \nearly. These measures to improve project readiness will facilitate faster project implementation. \n \nB. \n \n24. \nThe economic assessment for the five project roads was carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects (2017).13 The major benefits are savings \nin vehicle operating costs and passenger travel time. The estimated economic internal rates of \nreturn (EIRR) range from 11.3% to 20.4% and are averaged at 16.4%. The sensitivity analysis \nindicates that the project has an EIRR above 9.0%. If a 20.0% cost increase was combined with a \n20.0% benefit reduction, the EIRR would still be 10.8% for the whole project. Thus, the proposed \nimprovements are economically viable. The sensitivity analysis also showed that the EIRR was \nmore sensitive to changes in economic benefits. For this reason, the state government needs to \npay attention to socioeconomic development of the project area, fostering local transport services, \nand increasing incomes for rural road users. In terms of financial sustainability, the government \nwill  not  adopt  toll  collection  during  operation.  The  annual  average  incremental  recurrent  costs \nassociated with the project are estimated to be about 1.0% of the maintenance budget of the RCD, \nand  it  is  thus  reasonable  to  expect  that  the  budget  allocated  will  be  sufficient  to  meet  the \nmaintenance costs. \n \nC. \n \n25. \nPolicy,  legal,  and  institutional  capacity.  The  BSRDCL  was  incorporated  on  20  April \n2009 under the Companies Act of 1956 and is a wholly owned company of the Government of \nBihar, established to develop, execute, manage, and maintain all types of roads, highways, and \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n\fbridges.  The  BSRDCL  has  an  11-member  board  of  directors  and  is  headed  by  a  managing \ndirector,  with  about  114  staff  members.  The  corporate  structure  was  developed  along  good-\npractice principles, and the organization is developing a good understanding of business practices \nand commercial ability and aims to provide good standards with regard to safety, performance, \nand user satisfaction and to operate under sound ethical standards. \n \n26. \nFinancial management. The financial management assessment was conducted in May \n2018 in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects \nand the Financial Due Diligence: A Methodology Note.14 The financial management assessment \nconsidered the capacity of the BSRDCL, including funds flow arrangements, staffing, accounting \nand financial reporting systems, financial information systems, and internal and external auditing \narrangements. The BSRDCL is experienced and familiar with managing ADB-financed projects. \nThe overall financial management arrangements are considered satisfactory, and the overall risk \nis moderate, mainly because the position of the chief account officer is still vacant. The BSRDCL \nwill fill this position before January 2019. \n \nProcurement. The project procurement risk is rated low. BSRDCL has substantive prior \n27. \nexperience with ADB procurement, including large contracts using international advertisement, \nsuch  as  the  New  Ganga  Bridge.  For  this  project,  the  civil  works  packages  will  be  via  national \nadvertisement  due  to  the  smaller  contract  value.  BSRDCL  has  also  procured  concessionaires \nunder PPP contracts, including operate-maintain-and-transfer type contracts, so its procurement \nexperience is extensive. Contracts under the project will use ADB standard bidding documents.  \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n \n28. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government of India, the Government of Bihar, and  the BSRDCL. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n \n29. \nPoverty reduction and social impact. Households along project roads were surveyed \nand  indicated  that  poor  road  conditions  were  preventing  safe  and  reliable  travel,  especially  at \nnight and during bad weather. Communities indicated that positive benefits of the project roads \nwill  include  (i)  improved  access  to  health  and  education  facilities,  (ii)  faster  access  to  market \nplaces, (iii) increased job opportunities, and (iv) better public and private transport options. An \nefficient road network linking villages, towns, and cities will provide stronger links between rural \ncommunities  and  urban  hubs.  Road  development  encourages  other  development  initiatives, \nwhich  together  considerably  stimulate  economic  growth.  The  improvements  will  significantly \nimprove the socioeconomic situation and enhance poverty reduction in the beneficiary districts \nand the state. Project roads will directly pass through 197 villages located in six districts. \n \nGender and development. The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. A \n30. \ngender action plan (GAP) has been prepared. Inequalities between men and women in Bihar are \nmost obvious in (i) health and education, (ii) economic development, (iii) violence against women, \n(iv) participation in public life and policy making, and (v) social attitudes and gender stereotyping. \nGender differentials adversely affect women more than men. Most women in the project area are \nhomemakers, as rural women rarely work outside the home unless they are very poor. During \ngender assessment of the five roads\u2014when 300 women were interviewed and 30 women-specific \nfocus group discussions were conducted\u2014women indicated that improved road conditions would \n\n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2015.

Manila.  \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fprovide better access to health care services, higher levels of education, economic opportunities, \nand social interaction. Shorter travel times will allow more time for productive activities, health \ncare,  and  self-development.  However,  road  construction  and  improvements  may  also  lead  to \npotential negative impacts such as the spread of sexually transmitted infections, human trafficking, \nand road safety issues. \n \n31. \nBased on findings from consultations with the local community, including women and the \nexecuting  agency,  practical  and  implementable  gender  mainstreaming  activities  have  been \nincorporated into the project. Some key activities include (i) raising awareness among community \nmembers  and  contractors\u2019  personnel  on  sexually  transmitted  infections,  including  HIV/AIDS, \nhealth and hygiene, and human trafficking; (ii) incorporating specific needs of vulnerable users, \ne.g., the elderly, women, children, and disabled people, in the design and modification of roads; \n(iii) community participation in road safety awareness campaigns; and (iv) livelihood skills training \nfor affected communities, including women, to receive micro enterprise development support. \n \n32. \nIn output 2, which covers the establishment of the BRRI, the GAP envisages (i) 20% of \nstaff  assigned  to  the  BRRI  are  to  be  women;  and  (ii) impact  assessment  of  skills  training  and \nincome-generation activities, and various awareness campaigns to be completed. In addition, the \nBSRDCL  staff  will  be  oriented \nimprove  gender-sensitive  designs,  measures,  and \nto \nimplementation consistent with ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development.15 \n \n33. \nThe project also provides for a robust mechanism and adequate arrangements to ensure \nregular implementation, monitoring, and reporting of gender mainstreaming activities based on \nsex-disaggregated data collection. A gender specialist consultant will be engaged to implement \nthe GAP, supported by a nongovernment organization. A gender focal officer in the BSRDCL is \nassigned to ensure GAP implementation and provide overall supervision and coordination with \nother government departments, as needed. Budgetary provision to implement the GAP has been kept  \nas component A of the project cost, which covers land acquisition, resettlement, and rehabilitation. \n \n34. \nLabor. Provisions in the bidding documents for the civil works contractors, among others, \nare to (i) ensure that all applicable labor laws are complied with, including the prohibition against \nemploying children in construction; (ii) encourage the employment of the poor, particularly women; \nand (iii) ensure that wages for men and women are equal for work of equal value. \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nE. \n \n35. \ncategories are as follows.16 \n \n36. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  project  involves  improvement  of  five  existing  state \nhighways  totaling  about  230  km  from  single  or  intermediate  lanes  to  two  lanes  with  paved \nshoulders.  No  significant,  irreversible  environmental  impacts  are  anticipated  and  none  of  the \nroads  are  located  inside  or  near  protected  or  environmentally  sensitive  areas.  An  initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE)  has  been  prepared  and  was  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website. \nAnticipated  environmental  impacts  from  the  project  entail  typical  issues  related  to  road \nconstruction,  such  as  removal  of  trees,  generation  of  dust,  noise,  exhaust,  waste  from \nconstruction  and  worker  camps,  water  contamination,  occupational  health  and  safety,  slope \nfailures, erosion, and siltation. Mitigation measures to address all of these have been included in \n\n                                                 \n15 ADB. 2003. Policy on Gender and Development. Manila. \n16  ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fthe environmental management plan, which is part of the bid documents, and will be required to \nbe implemented by the contractor. Meaningful consultations have been held with affected persons \nand  other  key  stakeholders,  such  as  forestry  officials,  while  preparing  the  IEE.  Concerns  of \naffected  people  and  stakeholders  will  continue  to  be  addressed  during  project  implementation \nthrough the grievance redress mechanism proposed in the IEE. \n \n37. \nThe general manager of the BSRDCL will be responsible for the overall implementation of \nsafeguards under the project. At the project implementation unit (PIU) level, the deputy general \nmanager  of  each  of  the  four  PIUs  will  serve  as  the  focal  person  for  environment  and  social \nsafeguards supported by two CSC firms which will have environment specialists in their team. \nThe civil works contractors will implement the environmental management plan and will include \nenvironment,  health,  and  safety  officers  in  their  teams.  Supervision  and  monitoring  of  the \ncontractor  will  be  conducted  by  the  CSC.  An  initial  coordination-cum-training  workshop  will  be \norganized by the BSRDCL to clarify the roles and responsibilities of each party for complying with \nenvironment safeguard requirements.  \n \nInvoluntary resettlement (category A). The project was developed with a commitment \n38. \nto  minimize  land  acquisition  through  appropriate  technical  design.  While  road  widening  from \nsingle lane to two lanes will occur within existing rights-of-way, some land acquisition cannot be \navoided  where  alignments  will  be  improved  for  safety  reasons.  A  100%  census  of  affected \nhouseholds  was  conducted  based  on  the  detailed  design.  Five  resettlement  plans  and  a  due \ndiligence report were prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and the \npolicies and regulations of the governments of India and Bihar. \n \nThe project will require 10.74 hectares (ha) of land consisting of 8.23 ha of private land \n39. \nand 2.51 ha of government land (including 2.00 ha of vacant land owned by the BSRDCL to be \nused for the BRRI building). The total number of affected households are 4,021 (26,538 people), \nof which 439 are titled households and 3,582 are nontitled households (including sharecroppers, \ntenants, and employees). A total of 4,818 private and community structures will be affected by \nland acquisition and clearing of informal settler structures from the government-owned right-of-\nway.  Some  1,650  households  will  be  physically  displaced  and  2,371  will  be  economically \ndisplaced. About 3,618 households will lose more than 50% of their structure and may need to \nrelocate. The entitlement matrix provides for specific compensation and resettlement assistance \nfor the types of losses caused by the project. Compensation for lost assets will be paid based on \nreplacement  cost.  Resettlement  assistance  for  lost  income  and  livelihoods  will  be  provided  to \ntitleholders and nontitleholders alike, with special measures available to vulnerable households. \nResettlement  plans  have  been  disclosed  on  the  ADB  and  BSRDCL  websites,  and  to  affected \ncommunities through local government offices. The existing Environment, Social Development, \nand Resettlement Cell of the BSRDCL will implement this project. The BSRDCL will engage an \nexternal  expert  to  advise  on  involuntary  resettlement  safeguard  compliance.  The  total  cost  of \nresettlement is estimated at $23 million. \n \n40. \nIndigenous peoples (category C). During project preparation, social assessment noted \nthat the scheduled tribes live in the project area as individual households and not as indigenous \npeoples communities with distinct practices and collective attachment to land. The assessment \nindicates that scheduled tribe households are well integrated in the general population and will \nnot require indigenous peoples safeguards under the project. One scheduled tribe household will \nbe affected by land acquisition along State Highway 58. The resettlement plan provides that the \nhousehold will receive additional compensation as a vulnerable affected household, in addition to \ncompensation at replacement cost, transition allowances, and income restoration. \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nF. \n \n41. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.17 \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  5  and  described  in \n\nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nPoor management of \nsubcontractors may \nlead to contract \ntermination and \nimplementation delays \n\nExtreme weather \nevents that are beyond \nprojections may cause \nsignificant damages to \nthe project roads \n\nMitigation Measures \nFor larger contracts, contractors will subcontract substantial portions of work. \nPoor management of subcontractors and poor performance of subcontractors \nwould lead to terminated subcontracts and possibly the main contract itself, \nleading to time overruns. Size of contracts for this project will be limited to $40 \nmillion or less, which will minimize the number of subcontractors. There are \ngood quality and financially capable contractors in India that can do the work. \nNegative  impacts  of  extreme  weather  on  potential  countermeasures  have \nbeen  identified  in  the  initial  environmental  examination.
