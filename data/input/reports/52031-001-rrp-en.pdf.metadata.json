The project is aligned with the \ngovernment\u2019s Vanuatu Recovery Strategy 2020\u20132023: Tropical Cyclone Harold & COVID-19.5 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n4. \nVanuatu ranks first globally as the economy most exposed to natural hazards based on \nvulnerability,  and  is  highly  exposed  to  geophysical  hazards,  including  volcanic  eruptions  and \nearthquakes.6 While not classified as a fragile and conflict-affected situation, Vanuatu is a small \nisland  developing  state  and  shares  many  of  the  characteristics  of  fragile  states\u2014weak \ngovernance  and  low  capacity,  geographic  isolation,  high  cost  of  doing  business,  frequent \ngovernment changes, and vulnerability to climate change and disaster-related shocks.7 \n \n5. \nRapid urban population growth. Port Vila is the capital city and economic gateway to \nVanuatu, with an urban population of about 41,326 in 2019 (an increase from 38,714 people in \n2016). Port Vila is a first-tier urban settlement of about 12 square kilometers (km2) with a formally \nestablished municipal council. The population density is 3,444 people per km2 and about 30% of \nthe  population  live  in  informal  and  squatter  settlements.8  GPV,  comprising  Port  Vila  and  the \n\n \n\n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government of Vanuatu, Ministry of Internal Affairs. 2020.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nsurrounding  peri-urban  areas  in  Shefa  Province,  is  defined  for  urban  planning  purposes  as \ncovering an area of 289 km2. The population of GPV is projected to increase to 112,140 by 2030 \nfrom  about  84,852  in  2018  (an  increase  from  81,712  people  in  2016)  driven  by  rapid  internal \nmigration  from  the  outer  islands.9  Population  growth  has  increased  the  pressures  on  existing \ninfrastructure  and  services  and  worsened  inequality.  The  combined  impact  of  COVID-19  and \nfrequent tropical cyclones also contribute to deepening inequality. \n \n6. \nVulnerability  to  climate  change  and  disasters.  The  impacts  of  existing  and  future \nclimate change on GPV include (i) an increase in both average annual rainfall and the intensity \nand  frequency  of  extreme  rainfall  events;  (ii)  sea  level  rise;  (iii)  storm  surge;  (iv)  increased \ntemperatures;  and  (v)  changes  in  wind  and  wave  climate,  resulting  in  potential  increases  in \nextreme  wave  heights,  and  ocean  acidity.  About  41%  of  the  tropical  cyclones  that  affected \nVanuatu between 1981 and 2010 were category 3 or stronger.10 The social and economic impact \nof  disasters  caused  by  natural  hazards,  such  as  earthquakes  and  strong  winds,  is  significant. \nAt the 100-year mean return period, about 85% of the buildings and population are exposed to \nmoderate levels, and 15% to high levels, of potential risk of earthquakes and winds.11 In 2015, \nTropical  Cyclone  Pam,  a  category  5  cyclone,  caused  an  estimated  total  loss  of  about \n$450 million\u2014equivalent to 64% of the gross domestic product of Vanuatu. About 65,000 people \nwere displaced from their homes and about 50% of private households in Shefa Province sought \nshelter.12 In 2020, Vanuatu experienced the impacts of a dual emergency\u2014category 5 Tropical \nCyclone  Harold  in  April  and  COVID-19,  which  necessitated  border  closure  affecting  tourism, \ndisaster  recovery  operations,  and  trade.13  Vanuatu  has  been  in  a  state  of  emergency  since \n26 March  2020,  and  the  economy  is  expected  to  contract  by  9.8%  in  2020.14  COVID-19  is \nexacerbating the challenges women face in all spheres, including employment, and is likely to \nincrease the incidence and severity of gender-based violence (GBV). \n \n7. \nTraditional  temporary  evacuation  centers  unsatisfactory.  Churches,  schools,  and \ncommunity halls are often designated as evacuation centers. However, these buildings are not \nalways designed to withstand strong winds; are unsuitable for long stays; do not have sufficient \nwater, toilets, or cooking facilities; and may not meet the needs and priorities of both men and \nwomen. Additional challenges with such evacuation centers include the high cost of cleanup and \nrestoration of facilities after use, the urgent need for the facilities to resume normal operations, \nlimited  capacity  and  access  to  centers,  and  poor  connectivity  to  hospitals  and  emergency \nservices.  It  is  recognized  that  an  emergency  shelter  needs  to  have  a  daily  function  or  use  to \nensure a regular source of revenue to cover the costs for operation and maintenance (O&M). \n \nNeed for greater urban resilience in GPV. Building urban resilience requires a holistic \n8. \nand coordinated approach to city development and its application to future projects and policies \nbased  on  existing  policy  directions,  initiatives,  and  disaster  and  climate  change  risk \n\n \n\n9  Government of Vanuatu, National Statistics Office. 2011. 2009 National Population and Housing Census.

Asian Development Outlook Update: Wellness in Worrying Times\u2014September 2020. Manila. \n\n\fassessments.15 Urban infrastructure development in GPV has occurred with limited planning or \nprioritization  of  investments:  (i)  development  has  been  influenced  by  the  informal  systems \nestablished under customary land ownership; (ii) investments have not contributed to a common \nvision; (iii) investments have not considered the rural\u2013urban synergies within the GPV area; and \n(iv)  there  has  been  limited  focus  on  improving  safety  for  women  and  children,  enhancing \npedestrian  access  and  the  connectivity  of  public  spaces,  and  retrofitting  existing  buildings  to \nenhance  vibrancy  in  Port  Vila.  To  address  these  shortcomings,  the  GPV  RUDSAP  includes \nprioritized investments and emphasizes greater resilience in urban planning, development, and \nmanagement for sustained inclusive economic growth. \n \n9. \nLimited partnerships and capacity in strengthening urban resilience. The Ministry of \nInternal Affairs (MOIA) oversees local government and is mandated to coordinate urban planning \nand  development  in  Port  Vila.  The  MOIA  coordinates  with  the  National  Disaster  Management \nOffice on disaster risk management efforts at the subnational level. In 2020, the Department of \nUrban Affairs and Planning (DUAP) was established to focus on the needs of municipalities as \ngrowing urban centers. Port Vila Municipal Council (PVMC) is responsible for the administration \nof the municipality, including O&M of municipal assets. It operates on corporate principles and \nprepares 3-year corporate plans and annual business plans. Yet PVMC is hampered by its poor \nfinancial capacity, which constrains its ability to resource and finance the requirements for this \nrole. Property taxes account for about 59% of its income. The present property valuation roll dates \nfrom 2003 and, while updated in 2013, it was not published in the Official Gazette.16 In addition, \nduring  and  immediately  after  disasters,  community  disaster  and  climate  change  committees \n(CDCCCs)  are  responsible  for  communities\u2019  disaster  response.  Greater  formal  and  informal \ncollaboration,  training,  and  partnerships  are  needed  across  different  subnational  government \nagencies  and  with  communities  to  promote  local  disaster  risk  and  climate  change  adaptation \nsolutions.  Women  employees  are  a  minority  within  the  MOIA  (37%);  PVMC  (17%,  excluding \ncouncilors); and on CDCCCs (only about 30% of which include women), and closer reflection of \nsocietal makeup would better support partnerships. \n \n10. \nLessons. The project addresses issues of effectiveness and sustainability identified by the \ncompleted  Port  Vila  Urban  Development  Project  and  other  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nprojects,  and  in  consultation  with  development  partners  and  the  Vanuatu  Project  Management \nUnit.17 Lessons reflected in project design  include  the importance of aligning investments with a \ncommon vision guided by a Port Vila urban development strategy; focusing on building PVMC\u2019s \ncapacity for O&M of assets; using local experts to strengthen partnerships in the municipal urban \nward  units  and  communities  for  greater  resilience;  allowing  enough  time  to  complete  land \n\n \n\n15 Beca International Consultants Ltd, GNS Science, and National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research. 2016. \nUrban Risk Management Strategy: Risk Mapping and Planning for Urban Preparedness.

The  project  aligns  with  the  government\u2019s  GPV  RUDSAP,  which \nprovides a strategic road map for resilient urban development in GPV to 2030. It contributes to \nthe achievement of Sustainable Development Goals 1, 5, 6, 11, 13, and 16; and is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational priorities 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. The project supports the government\u2019s \nVanuatu  Recovery  Strategy  2020\u20132023  in  disaster  preparedness,  response,  and  recovery. \nConsultations with development partners focused on the project design and project preparedness, \nand synergies with ongoing sector and institutional activities. \n \nB. \n\nProject Description \n\n12. \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: By 2030, GPV is a safe, inclusive, resilient, \nand vibrant economic hub based on sustainable development (footnote 2). The project will have \nthe  following  outcome:  Urban  resilience  in  GPV  improved  (footnote  1).  This  will  be  achieved \nthrough four outputs. \n \n13. \nOutput 1: Resilience in urban planning and management strengthened. The output will \nstrengthen the capacity of PVMC and the DUAP of the MOIA. The project will (i) support the DUAP \nin urban planning and administration for greater resilience and improved service delivery, including \nby  updating  the  GPV  RUDSAP  and  preparing  the  Port  Vila  livable  city  action  plan;  (ii)  review \nPVMC\u2019s 3-year corporate plan and annual business plan to ensure appropriate planning for asset \nmaintenance, disaster response, and gender targets; (iii) review and expand PVMC\u2019s asset register; \nand  (iv)  support  PVMC  in  financial  planning,  including  updating  the  property  valuation  roll  and \ntaxes.18 The output will also support the establishment of an information-sharing network between \nPVMC  and  other  municipal  councils  to  share  experiences  and  lessons  through  peer-to-peer \nlearning. \n \n14. \nOutput  2:  Urban  resilience  enhanced  through  local  partnerships.  The  output  will \nfacilitate  vertical  and  horizontal  partnerships  and  coordination19  through  activities  including \ntraining ward secretaries in disaster risk management and climate change adaptation; financing \npublic campaigns on climate change adaptation and disaster risk management with a particular \nemphasis on the poor, women, and vulnerable households; and preparing inclusive and gender-\nresponsive emergency preparedness plans for each shelter constructed.  \n \nOutput 3: Resilient urban infrastructure constructed in Greater Port Vila. The output \n15. \nwill finance two multipurpose and gender-responsive emergency shelters that include sanitation \nfacilities, office space, and market area improvements. The shelters are one of the seven areas \nof investment prioritized in the GPV RUDSAP.20 They will be located at Seaside Showground in \nCenter  ward  and  at  Freshwota  in  Freshwota-Tasariki  ward.  Geographic  information  system \nhazard risk and exposure maps were used as an initial screening tool to determine the location \n\n \n\n18 These activities will complement the ongoing efforts by the  Programme for Technical Assistance to Pacific Island \nCountries that is being implemented by Local Government New Zealand, which supports local government authorities \nin Pacific island countries. \n\n19  Vertical  partnerships  include  those  among  the  MOIA,  PVMC,  and  wards.  Horizontal  partnerships  include  those \n\nbetween PVMC, wards, CDCCCs, and local stakeholders such as businesses. \n\n20 The strategy includes 67 interventions with a cost estimate of $180 million, of which 30 interventions are prioritized \n\nacross 7 broad areas totaling $25 million. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fof  candidate  shelters.21  Final  selection  was  based  on  ward  priority,  community  accessibility, \nequitable spatial distribution, and maximizing the number of beneficiaries. \n \n16. \nThe  two  shelters  can  help  about  905  potential  evacuees  avoid  death,  disability,  and \ndiseases during disasters. The design of the two shelters for use outside emergency situations in \nthe country is an innovation introduced by this project. They will include communal space that can \nbe used for economic activities (e.g., a marketplace), community meetings, and gender-sensitive \npost-disaster response. For instance, movable partitions will be available to cordon off part of the \nopen space on the ground floor for emergency triage activities. Each shelter incorporates these \nunique  design  features  that  enable  them  to  be  used  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic  or  future \nhealth emergencies. Each shelter will be equipped with water supply, separate sanitation facilities \nfor men and women, and a kitchen for hygienic food preparation. All facilities will be accessible to \npeople living with disabilities.  \n \n17. \nOutput 4: Asset management and institutional capacity strengthened. The output will \nimprove  the  MOIA\u2019s  capacity  to  develop,  implement,  and  monitor  projects;  and  will  strengthen \nPVMC\u2019s  capacity  to  operate  and  maintain  shelters  constructed  under  the  project.  Sustainable \nO&M  will  be  ensured  through  the  implementation  of the  Asset  Management  Strategy  that  was \ndeveloped  during  project  preparation,  which  includes  support  to  PVMC  in  establishing  and \nmanaging  a  dedicated  major  maintenance  reserve  account  to  finance  future  repairs  and \nrehabilitation of the shelters. This will benefit both agencies\u2019 future investment activities. \n \nC. \n\nValue Added by ADB \n\nThe project\u2019s approach to urban development strongly emphasizes capacity building and \n18. \ninstitutional  strengthening,  and  the  practical  application  of  the  GPV  RUDSAP  in  planning  and \nfinancing  infrastructure  to  help  build  urban  resilience  and  address  the  causes  of  fragility. \nThe approach  builds  on  and  implements  activities  developed  through  technical  assistance, \nincluding  the  GPV  RUDSAP  (footnote  2),  a  geographic  information  system  platform  that  used \nhazard risk and exposure data sets and associated spatial maps (footnote 21), and a strategic \nprocurement  plan.22  The  approach  supports  the  government\u2019s  decentralization  framework  for \nurban service delivery and governance; focuses on effectiveness and sustainability through the \nimplementation of a capacity development plan and the Asset Management Strategy, featuring \nan O&M plan for each project asset; and responds to COVID-19 and Tropical Cyclone Harold by \nfocusing  on  localized  preparedness  for,  response  to,  and  recovery  from  disasters  and  health \nemergencies. \n\nD. \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n19. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $11.77  million  (Table  1).  Detailed  cost  estimates  by \nexpenditure category and by financier are included in the project administration manual (PAM).23 \n \n20. \nThe government has requested a grant not exceeding $9.640 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund)  to  help  finance  the  project.  Climate  adaptation  is \nestimated to cost $4.820 million based on calculations outlined in the climate change assessment.24 \n \n\n \n\n21 ADB. 2016.

Each shelter will be built in an area \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fthat is not susceptible to high tide storm surge or localized flooding and is protected against high \nwinds. Hazard mapping confirmed the location of these sites and their degree of exposure and \nvulnerability to natural hazards. The shelters will be built with the required structural resilience to \nwithstand extreme storm conditions and small to moderate earthquakes at 100-year mean return \nperiod, following the national building code and international best practice for resilient buildings. \nThey are designed to use locally available materials and techniques commonly applied in Vanuatu \nto enable upkeep by local firms. The designs build on the National Disaster Management Office\u2019s \nminimum requirements for  evacuation  centers  and  incorporate  design features that  enable the \nshelters to be used during COVID-19 or future health emergencies. The cost estimates are based \non actual rates for buildings constructed under the Port Vila Urban Development Project, other \nconstruction contract rates, and cost estimates for market improvements. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\n26. \nThe  two  multipurpose  emergency  shelters  are  cost-effective  solutions.  Standard  cost\u2013\nbenefit analysis is not applicable for this project, because the quantifiable benefits, in the form of \navoided deaths and disabilities of residents,25 that could result from the establishment of shelters \nwould yield disproportionately low benefits relative to investment costs. The two shelters can help \nabout 905 potential evacuees avoid death, disability, and diseases during disasters. Thus, a least-\ncost analysis was conducted, which found that multipurpose emergency shelters constructed with \nconcrete  block  walls  and  reinforced  concrete  columns  are  a  more  cost-effective  solution,  with \n9%\u201317% lower costs per evacuee, than similar shelters made from light-gauge galvanized steel. \nThe  two  shelters  will  also  provide  employment  opportunities  to  about  339  people  through \nimproved market area development, and will serve about 15,500 people at different times and in \nvarious capacities (e.g., as an emergency shelter, marketplace and/or community center). \n \n27. \nThe fee that could be earned from the use of the shelters during normal times would not \ncover  the  full  investment  costs.  An  incremental  recurrent  cost  analysis  was  conducted,  which \nconcluded that the incremental yearly cost required to operate and maintain two shelters averages \nVt5.8 million, or about 10% of the fee expected to be collected by the shelters. The remaining \n90% constitutes revenue surplus, a portion of which will be kept in the major maintenance reserve \naccount for future repairs and rehabilitation.26 Thus, adequate funds should be available to cover \nthe full O&M cost of the shelters and ensure the financial sustainability of their operations. The \nproposed  fee  for  facility  uses  during  normal  times  is  considered  affordable.  The  Asset \nManagement Strategy will help to ensure that the project assets are operated and maintained.27  \n \nC. \n\nSustainability \n\n28. \nThe  project  will  provide  financing  to  build  urban  resilience  and  address  the  causes  of \nfragility  through  an  emphasis  on  capacity  building,  improved  forecasting  and  planning,  and \ninstitutional development. PVMC relies on property taxes and other fees since it does not receive \ncentral  budget  transfer  for  its  operations.  The  project  will  implement  the  Asset  Management \nStrategy, set forth in the PAM (footnote 23), which addresses the technical, administrative, and \nfinancial requirements for O&M of the project assets. Based on the Asset Management Strategy, \neach shelter will have an O&M plan outlining these requirements. To ensure that the shelters are \nadequately  maintained  and  funds  are  available,  the  project  will  support  PVMC  in  setting  up  a \nmajor  maintenance reserve  account  dedicated  to  the O&M  of the  project  assets,  completing  a \n\n25  Measured in disability-adjusted life-years because of disasters caused by natural hazards. \n26 The amount will be determined during project implementation, based on detailed designs and actual cost of O&M. \n27 Financial Analysis and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fproperty valuation review, and reviewing alternative revenue-generating streams. ADB and the \ngovernment will review the Asset Management Strategy and update it, as needed. \n \nD. \n\nGovernance \n\n29. \nThe assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk is moderate, based on a financial \nmanagement  assessment  completed  for  the  MFEM,  the  MOIA,  and  PVMC.  The  project  will \nstrengthen the capacity of the PCU staff in financial management and internal and external audit \noversight. The PCU and the project implementation unit will have qualified staff. While the limited \nnumber  of  available  skilled  staff  presents  an  inherent  risk  to  project  effectiveness,  this  will  be \nmitigated during implementation through the consulting packages. The MFEM and the MOIA will \nrecruit  project  assistance  and  implementation  consultants  to  support  project  management  and \nprovide  training  in  ADB  financial  management  and  reporting  procedures,  project  accounting, \nfunds  flow  management,  and  procurement.  The  Office  of  the  General  Auditor  will  recruit  an \nexternal auditor acceptable to ADB to assist in annual project audits. \n \nThe  project  procurement  classification  is  B  with  risk  mitigating  actions.  A  strategic \n30. \nprocurement  plan  has  been  prepared  based  on  the  institutional  procurement  capacity \nassessments carried out in 2020, and a 2017 country and sector and/or agency procurement risk \nassessment  report.  The  MFEM  has  experience  in  implementing  ADB-financed  projects  and  is \nfamiliar with ADB\u2019s procurement procedures under the 2017 procurement framework. The MOIA \nhas dedicated procurement officers with some experience with projects funded by ADB and other \ndevelopment partners. Procurement under the project is not complex and will be done by the PCU \nwith support from the consultants and the MFEM. The project allocates sufficient resources for \nprocurement training, contract management, and ADB oversight. \n \n31. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  the  MFEM,  the  MOIA,  and  PVMC.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 23). \n \nE. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nPoverty  targeting  is  general  intervention.  By  working  with  ward  secretaries  and \n32. \ncommunities,  the  project  will  use  a  place-based approach  by targeting  an  entire  community  to \nidentify (i) climate change and disaster risk management issues  in neighborhoods, and (ii) the \npoor  and  vulnerable  households  in  each  ward.  These  challenges  will  be  transformed  into \nmessages  for  public  awareness-raising  and  addressed  in  emergency  preparedness  plans. \nThe multipurpose  emergency  shelters  will  be  accessible  to  all  community  members  and  will \nstrengthen  community  social  cohesion.  The  shelters  will  be  inclusive,  as  they  will  provide \nemployment opportunities and support income generation for men, women, and youth; and are \ndesigned to reflect community priorities and characteristics. \n \n33. \nThe project is categorized  gender equity theme. Women are rarely key stakeholders in \nurban planning and design and, as a result, urban infrastructure does not always meet their needs \nor  priorities.  Key  gender  issues  include  limited  participation  by  women  and  lack  of  female \nrepresentation  in  leadership  roles  in  decision-making,  high  levels  of  gender-based  violence \n(GBV),  limited  access to  employment  and  skills  development,  and  poor market  conditions  and \nfacilities. About 60% of women have experienced some form of abuse from an intimate partner at \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fleast once in their lifetime, with 21% left with permanent injuries.28 The project will promote gender \nequality and women\u2019s empowerment through meaningful participation and inclusion of women in \nleadership  and  decision-making  opportunities;  training  opportunities  for  women;  specific \nmeasures  to  respond  to  GBV,  including  public  campaigns  and  GBV  referral  pathways;  and \ngender-responsive resilient infrastructure. The MOIA will monitor the gender action plan will be \nmonitored on a quarterly basis using a template provided by ADB. \n \nF. \n\nSafeguards \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\n34. \ncategories are as follows.29 \n \nEnvironment (category B). The two multipurpose shelters are expected to have positive \n35. \nimpacts. Potential negative impacts arising from construction activities will be limited in scope and \nscale,  and  can  be  substantially  mitigated  by  good  construction  management.  Proper  disposal \n(including reuse or recycling) of materials is part of the environment assessment and included in \nthe environmental management plan. An initial environment examination has been prepared for the \ntwo shelters. \n \n36. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category B). A resettlement plan has been prepared for the two \nshelters,  which  are  located  on  government  land.  There  may  be  partial  impacts  on  trees  and \ntemporary displacement of market vendors to an alternative market adjacent to the existing site, \nwith minimal to no impacts on incomes. \n \nIndigenous peoples (category C). The project is not expected to impact any distinct and \n37. \nvulnerable group of indigenous peoples as defined under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, as \nVanuatu\u2019s  population  comprises  mostly  Melanesians.  Local  communities  will  receive  culturally \nappropriate benefits and will actively participate in the project. \n \n38. \nSafeguard planning documents are prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement and Government of Vanuatu regulations. The MOIA will submit semiannual safeguard \nmonitoring reports to ADB and, with support from project consultants, will monitor compliance with \nsafeguards. A grievance redress mechanism will be established to address issues and grievances \nin a timely and effective manner. \n \nG. \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nHigh  and  substantial  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and \n\n39. \ndescribed in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.30 \n \n\nRisks \nProject commencement is \ndelayed because of the COVID-\n19 pandemic. \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nMitigation Measures \nThe project uses mostly national consultants for project implementation \nand optimizes opportunities for local contractors.  \n\n \n\n28 Government  of  Vanuatu,  Ministry  of  Justice  and  Community  Services,  Department  of  Women\u2019s  Affairs.  2015. \nNational  Gender  Equality  Policy  2015\u20132019.
