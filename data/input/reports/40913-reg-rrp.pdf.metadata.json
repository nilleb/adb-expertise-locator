I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nequity investment in Asia Healthcare Fund L.P. (the Fund) of up to $20 million or 25% of the \nFund\u2019s total capital, whichever is less. \n \nII.  MARKET OPPORTUNITY \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n2.  The current dynamics of the health care industry in Asia are creating great opportunities \nfor a private equity fund focused on health care. The drivers for this phenomenon include \n(i) rapidly escalating demand for health care services within Asia and abroad, (ii) comparative \nadvantage for production and delivery of health care services in Asia, (iii) increasing supply of \ncompanies meeting health care needs, (iv) significant requirements for health care financing, \nand (v) lack of appropriate financing modalities for the health care industry.1  \n \n3.  Escalating  Demand  for  Health  Care  Services  in  Asia.  Demand  for  health  care \nservices is rising dramatically across Asia because of pressures from within Asia and overseas. \nWithin Asia, the sharp escalation in demand is due to fast economic growth and increases in \nincome in large emerging economies such as the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and India. \nThis has resulted in (i) large numbers of people moving out of poverty, (ii) increased consumer \nspending by a growing middle class, and (iii) huge unmet demand for world-class facilities and \nmedical care.2 In addition, in developed overseas markets such as the United Kingdom and the \nUnited States, macroeconomic trends\u2014particularly rising costs related to every aspect of the \nhealth  care  industry\u2014are  putting  huge  pressure  on  the  health  care  system.3  These  cost \nincreases are gradually leading companies to seek lower-cost alternatives, and the need to \noutsource  and  move  various  activities  offshore  has  increased  dramatically.  American  and \nEuropean companies are looking aggressively toward Asia\u2019s emerging economies as a new \nlocation for research and development (R&D), manufacturing, drug discovery, and medical \nservices.4  \n \n4.  Comparative Advantage of Emerging Asia. India and other emerging economies in \nthe region are well positioned to capitalize on this dramatic increase in demand. In particular, \nIndia\u2019s advantages include the following: (i) a well-educated pool of scientific and engineering \ntalent,  (ii)  a  large  number  of  US  Food  and  Drug  Administration-approved  facilities, \n(iii) intellectual property that conforms to World Trade Organization patent standards, (iv) a \ngrowing variety of biopharmaceutical business models, (v) increasing recruitment of overseas \naffiliates,  and  (vi)  superior  growth  potential  for  the  services  sector.  Perhaps  the  most \npronounced comparative advantage in emerging Asia is cost. In India, as compared to costs in \n                                                 \n1 Analysis of the background and opportunity will focus primarily on India, where the majority of the Fund\u2019s capital will \nbe invested.  \n2 Health care spending represents only 5.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) in the PRC and 5.1% of GDP in India, \ncompared with 13.9% of GDP in the US. This low level of spending is also reflected in health care expenditures per \ncapita, number of hospital beds per 1,000 people, and other figures.  \n3 These include (i) rapidly rising medical costs, increases in drug prices, and poor hospital cost containment; (ii) rising \ncost of medical innovation (cost of new drug now as high as $800 million or more, high cost of medical device \ndevelopment); (iii) patent expiration ($15+ billion exposure to patent expiry by 2010); and (iv) gaps in the drug \ndiscovery pipeline.  \n4 According to HSBC Global Research, global outsourcing and moving offshore of health care services is an industry \ncurrently worth about $220 billion, with annual growth prospects of 8\u201310%. A conservative HSBC forecast predicts \nthat India should be able to claim $12 billion annually by 2015. ", "                           3                          \nmore developed economies, overall R&D costs are about one eighth; manufacturing costs are \n20\u201340%; and overall clinical development costs are about 40\u201350%.  \n \n5.  Growing Supply of Health Care Services in Asia. The high demand for health care \nservices  and  advantageous  positioning  (paras  2\u20134)  has  led  Asian  developing  countries, \nparticularly India, to develop an increasing, high-quality supply of health care services. For \nexample, India\u2019s pharmaceutical exports have grown by about 22% per year for the last 10 \nyears, and are projected to double between 2004 and 2007. The number of Indian companies in \nthe top 10 pharmaceutical companies operating in India has grown from 4 out of 10 in 1994 to 9 \nout of 10 in 2005. With regard to medical services, the quality of India\u2019s hospitals is rising, to the \npoint of now being certified and benchmarked against their global counterparts. In terms of drug \ndiscovery, Pfizer Inc. intends to enter into R&D in India, citing the Government\u2019s pro-innovation \nstance as a motivating factor, while Merck & Co., Inc. (which has been absent from India for 18 \nyears) has announced that it will set up a subsidiary in the country. All along the value chain, \nmore companies in India and other economies in the region are emerging to supply health care \nservices to meet escalating global demand.  \n \n6.  Rapidly Increasing Need for Capital for Health Care Companies. The emerging \nstrength and positioning of the Indian health care industry\u2014bolstered by the country\u2019s strong \nmacroeconomic growth and pressures from abroad\u2014can only be solidified through huge capital \ninvestment. The requirements for financing the health care industry are enormous. In India \nalone, it is estimated that dramatic improvements need to be made over the next 5 years in key \naspects of the health care services industry (including coverage, purchasing, and delivery) at an \nestimated cost of $22 billion\u201480% of which will have to come from the private sector.5 A similar \nscale of financing requirements can be estimated for other countries in emerging Asia. Clearly, \na number of financing modalities are essential.  \n \n7.  Constraints to Financing for Health Care Companies. Despite the huge need for \nfinancing, companies in the health care industry in India and other countries in the region face \nserious funding constraints.  \n \n(i)  Bank borrowing. Banks typically prefer lending to more mature companies, so \nsmaller companies face high borrowing costs and frequently unacceptable loan \nconditions  (e.g.,  personal  guarantees  and  excessive  collateral).  In  addition, \nbanks  often  rely  on  lending  methodologies  that  require  immediate \ncommencement  of  loan  repayments,  which  are  not  viable  for  fast-growing \ncompanies.6\n(ii)  Debt-to-equity ratios. Banks monitor debt-to-equity ratios strictly, so equity is \noften a precondition for loan disbursement even if banks are willing to lend. This \nmakes bank loans unavailable in the absence of equity. \n(iii)  Public offerings. Initial public offerings (IPOs) are more easily achieved in India \nthan other emerging markets in Asia. However, a public listing is no guarantee of \nliquidity, and a premature IPO can bring the burden of compliance with listing \nregulations without the associated benefits of listing.7  \n \n                                                 \n5 CII and McKinsey & Company. 2002. Healthcare in India: The Road Ahead. New Delhi: CII & McKinsey. \n6 In the pharmaceuticals industry, for example, investments in plants and machinery can often take several years to \nyield cash returns, but banks often require interest and principal repayment to begin upon loan effectiveness. \n7 Although India\u2019s stock market has over 7,000 listed companies, only 100 companies account for over 99% of trading \nvolume across India\u2019s stock markets, and more than half of listed companies are not traded at all.  \n ", "4         \n     \nGiven these constraints, companies in the health care industry in India can benefit from taking \nprivate equity.  \n \n8.  Shallow Private Equity Market in India. India\u2019s private equity industry is segmented \ninto different investment ranges and each segment is populated by only a small number of \nfunds. Several dozen funds are operating in India, but no other fund specifically addresses the \n$10 million\u2013$40 million investment range in the health care sector, which the Fund would target. \nAlthough  other  funds  have  health  care,  biotech,  and  pharmaceuticals  companies  as  small \nportions of their portfolios, no other fund has the deep industry knowledge that is the Fund\u2019s \ncomparative advantage. The Fund will focus on creating deals by providing not only capital, but \nalso technology, operational expertise, access to markets, and a manager\u2019s viewpoint from ex-\nchief executive officers.  \n \n9.  The Fund will capitalize on the dynamics of significant unmet demand for private equity \nfinancing of burgeoning health care industries in Asia\u2019s emerging economies to generate profits \nand deliver developmental impact for its portfolio companies throughout the region.  \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED FUND \n \nA.   Objectives and Description  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n10.  The primary objective of the Fund will be to achieve superior returns for its investors\u2014\nprimarily in the form  of long-term capital appreciation\u2014through investments in health  care \ncompanies in India and other emerging Asian markets. The Fund will make investments in \ncompanies  focused  on  manufacturing  of  pharmaceutical  and  biotechnology  drugs,  medical \ntechnology and devices, health care services, and drug development services. \n \nB.   Fund Management \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n11.  The Fund will be managed by the general partner (the General Partner), East West \nCapital Partners Ltd, a company established in the Cayman Islands (the Fund Manager). The \nGeneral  Partner  will  enter  into  an  investment  advisory  agreement  with  East  West  Capital \nPartners  Pte  Ltd  (the  Investment  Adviser),  a  company  incorporated  in  Singapore.  The \nInvestment Adviser, in turn, will enter into a research services agreement with East West Capital \nPartners India Pvt Ltd (the Research Company), an Indian company based in Bangalore. The \nrelationships between these entities will be described under governance structure (section E).  \n \n12.  The Fund will have a panel of advisers and will benefit from relationships with other \nindividuals and organizations within the industry. This will serve to deepen its intellectual and \noperational resources.  \n \nC.   Governance Structure  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] ", "                           5                          \n \n1.  Fund Manager \n \n13.  The Fund Manager will be responsible for managing the Fund and making investment \ndecisions on its behalf.   \n \n14.  The Fund Manager will establish an investment committee (the Investment Committee), \nand  will  enter  into  an  investment  agreement  with  an  investment  adviser  (the  Investment \nAdviser).    The  Investment  Adviser  is  responsible  for  identifying  and  researching  suitable \ninvestments pursuant to the investment policy, advising the General Partner on the merits, \nstructure, and financing of investments, and negotiating and arranging such investments. The \nInvestment Adviser submits investment recommendations to the Investment Committee.   \n \n15.  To support its activities, the Investment Adviser will enter into an arms-length agreement \nwith the Research Company, which will render market research services helpful for making \ninvestment recommendations.  \n \nIV.  INVESTMENT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  Development Impact \n \n16.  By  providing  financing  for  this  transaction,  ADB  intends  to  achieve  the  following \ndevelopmental objectives at the portfolio company level: \n \n(i)  Improvement of health care services. The Fund will invest in high-caliber, \nrapidly growing companies in the health care sector. This will have the effect of \nimproving the quality of and access to health care for the local population. \n(ii)  Creation of jobs. The Fund\u2019s investments in portfolio companies will support \nsuch  companies\u2019  growth  and  expansion,  creating  jobs  and  sustainable \nemployment in the community.  \n(iii)  Building of higher quality companies that raise overall industry standards. \nThe  Fund\u2019s  investments  will  support  portfolio  companies\u2019  financial  planning, \nbusiness  expansion  strategies,  human  resource  development,  technology, \nenvironmental and social issues, and implementation of international corporate \ngovernance best practices. This will raise the quality of individual companies. As \ncompanies are forced to compete for market share and financing, the degree of \nsophistication and efficiency of the industry will rise. This is particularly relevant in \nthe pharmaceuticals industry where factories and production processes must \nmeet international standards so that firms may produce for global markets.  \n(iv)  Knowledge  transfer  and  management  skills  training.  In  addition  to \ncontributing to stronger, more sustainable companies, the Fund\u2019s representation \nin the management of portfolio companies will develop a class of local business \nprofessionals with much-needed managerial skills. These local professionals will \neither  stay  with  the  portfolio  company  or  leave  to  join  another  firm,  thus \n\u201cpollinating\u201d the industry with skilled managers. This is particularly useful in the \n ", "6         \n     \nhealth care services sector, which requires managers with highly specialized \nknowledge.  \n(v)  Financial diversification. The Fund\u2019s investments in portfolio companies will \ndiversify the sources of finance available to these companies. Their increased \nequity capital will enable them to (a) obtain bank loans based on their improved \ndebt-to-equity ratio, and (b) buy fixed assets to use as collateral for secured \nloans. This dynamic process of leveraging their expansion helps medium-sized \ncompanies graduate to larger enterprises and eventually raise capital by listing \non the stock exchange.  \n(vi)  Contribution of indirect effects and externalities. In addition to the direct \ncontributions to economic development listed above, the Fund will also make \nseveral indirect, but important, contributions: (a) the Fund\u2019s investments will be \nused for the growth and improvement of portfolio companies, which will result in \nincreased taxable revenues that governments can direct toward social services \nand infrastructure requirements;8 (b) the Fund will invest in innovative, demand-\ndriven products and services, whose availability will improve the standard of \nliving for people in the community; (c) the Fund\u2019s portfolio companies will often \nuse  inputs  to  production,  sourced  from  local  companies,  creating  upstream \nlinkages and benefits for the producers of those inputs; (d) private sector jobs \ncreated  at  portfolio  companies  will  contribute  to  an  employed,  therefore \nincreasingly  stable,  middle  class,  which  will  in  turn  contribute  to  long-term \neconomic progress and overall stability, and indirectly support poverty reduction, \nfor countries in the region.    \n17.  In addition to contributing to various developmental outcomes at the portfolio company \nlevel, investment in the Fund would also develop the private equity industry itself in four specific \nways.  \n(i)  At the level of the asset class, ADB\u2019s investment would help demonstrate the \ncredibility and potential of private equity in India and other DMCs. The rate of \nprivate equity investment in India and other Asian emerging markets is still well \nbelow the levels of more economically developed countries9 that actively utilize \nprivate equity to foster local management capacity and demonstrate a return on \ninvestment in entrepreneurial SMEs.10 By demonstrating the potential of the asset \nclass, ADB\u2019s investment in the Fund would attract more private equity firms to \nenter the market, deepening the penetration of the asset class.  \n                                                 \n8 In this way, the Fund could help extend the health care sector via both the private sector and, indirectly, the public \nsector. \n9 Private equity investment rate (as percent of GDP) in 2003 was 0.59% in Singapore, 0.47% in the Republic of \nKorea, 0.31% in Indonesia, 0.14% in India, 0.12% in PRC, 0.08% in the Philippines, 0.03% in Thailand, and 0.03% \nin Viet Nam. (The relatively higher rate in Indonesia reflects larger cross-border transactions but the private equity \nindustry in Indonesia is still insignificant.) Venture Capital Journal. 2004. The 2004 Guide to Venture Capital in \nAsia. Hong Kong, China; and World Bank; 2004. World Development Indicators. Washington DC. It should be \nnoted that private equity investment in India has increased significantly in the last couple of years, reaching about \n0.30% of GDP in 2005 (Private equity data from Venture Intelligence India 2005, GDP data from Economist \nIntelligence Unit).   \n10 The following research papers provide insights into this subject: Doran, A. and Graham Bannock. 2000.

", "                           7                          \n(ii)  At the level of the market, the Fund\u2019s interaction with companies in the market \nwill help to educate the management teams of existing and potential portfolio \ncompanies with regard to the private equity asset class and its advantages as a \nfinancing tool. This will increase demand for the product and will raise the amount \nand quality of deal flow for all private equity firms operating in the market.  \n(iii)  At  the  fund  level,  ADB\u2019s  investment  in  the  Fund  will  help  to  develop  fund \nmanagers and financial professionals in Asia\u2019s developing economies.   \n(iv)  At the portfolio company level, ADB\u2019s investment will mobilize long-term risk \ncapital for the Fund\u2019s portfolio companies from private sources for entrepreneurial \ncompanies to finance expansion and improvement.  \n \n18.  In addition to the developmental impacts mentioned above, investment in the Fund \nwould contribute to the abilities of DMCs to achieve their health care targets for the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals.  \n \n2.  Value Added by ADB \n \n(i)  Catalytic and demonstration effect. Given the significant risks and challenges \nfacing potential investors, as well as the emergent nature of the private equity \nindustries in India and other emerging economies in the region, ADB will serve a \ncatalytic  role  in  attracting  additional  local  and  foreign  long-term  private \ninvestments to the region. ADB will demonstrate by its intervention the credibility \nof private equity in India and other DMCs and mobilize capital to support other \nprivate equity funds.  \n \n(ii)  Private  sector  development.  The  Fund,  similar  to  others  in  which  PSOD \ninvests, will make a direct contribution to private sector development. The Fund \nwill  employ  market-based  mechanisms  to  develop  profitable  and  sustainable \nenterprises.  Its  focus  on  emergent  sectors  at  the  very  early  stages  of \nconsolidation will provide capital, management skills, and corporate governance \noversight  to  assist  in  rationalizing  and  developing  these  highly  fragmented \nindustries.  ADB\u2019s  contribution  to  this  type  of  initiative  helps  its  DMCs  to \nimplement their country-specific private sector development strategies.  \n \nB.  Measuring Development Effectiveness \n \n19.  PSOD and the Operations Evaluation Department of ADB are formulating guidelines for \nimplementing the Good Practice Standards (GPS) for Evaluation of Private Sector Investment \nOperations, which were prepared by the Evaluation Cooperation Group11 of the multilateral \ndevelopment banks. GPS cover (i) the roles of the independent evaluation department and the \nprivate sector department, (ii) the evaluation dimensions for private sector operations, (iii) the \nnature of annual reporting, and (iv) dissemination of reports and lessons. According to the GPS, \nthe  three  main  dimensions  for  private  sector  evaluation  are  (i)  development  outcome, \n(ii) investment  profitability  for  the  institution,  and  (iii)  operational  effectiveness.  PSOD  will \nmeasure  the  expected  development  outcome  of  this  Fund  at  both the  Fund  and  investee \n                                                 \n11 The Evaluation Cooperation Group  was formed by the multilateral  development banks to design common \nevaluation standards for private sector operations. The group\u2019s work is ongoing and some aspects of the present \nevaluation framework might change to correspond to best practices. \n ", "8         \n     \ncompany  level  as  well  as  beyond  the  Fund  by  monitoring  certain  performance  measures \nthroughout the life of the Fund. The performance measures are grouped into three key areas.  \n \n(i)  Business  performance.  The  extent  to  which  the  Fund  has  reached  its \nobjectives in terms of the overall profitability and commercial viability of the Fund \nand its investments. \n \n(ii)  Economic sustainability. The effects of the Fund and its investments on the \nDMC\u2019s economy, and the associated benefits and costs. On the one hand, these \nmeasures  assess  the  extent  to  which  the  Fund  improved  the  allocation  of \nresources and provision of financial services to viable private enterprises. On the \nother hand, these measures evaluate whether the investments directly generated \npositive effects on the local economy.  \n \n(iii)  Private  sector  development.  The  impact  of  the  Fund  on  private  sector \ndevelopment beyond the Fund itself and its immediate stakeholders, e.g., the \nFund\u2019s contribution to the growth of viable financial institutions and financial \nmarkets development. \n \n20.  Quantitative and qualitative measures of performance are in Appendix 4.  \n \nC.   Environmental Protection and Social Safeguard Policies \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s investment in the Fund is classified category FI (financial intermediary) under \nADB\u2019s  environment  policy12  and  no  investments  by  the  Fund  are  anticipated  to  result  in \nsignificant environmental impact. However, the Fund Manager will be required to adopt an \nenvironmental management system in accordance with the guidelines set out in Appendix 5.13\n \n22.  ADB\u2019s  investment  in  the  Fund  is  classified  category  C  under  ADB\u2019s  involuntary \nresettlement policy14 and no involuntary settlements are foreseen in relation to any investments \nby the Fund.  \n \n23.  ADB\u2019s investment in the Fund is classified category C under ADB\u2019s indigenous peoples \npolicy15 and no investments by the Fund are expected to have impact on indigenous peoples.  \n \nD.  Anticorruption  Policy,  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of \nTerrorism \n24.  The Fund Manager was advised of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy16 and policy relating to \nthe  combating  of  money  laundering  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.17  Consistent  with  its \ncommitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will require the Fund \nManager to institute, maintain, and comply  with internal procedures and controls following \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2003.
