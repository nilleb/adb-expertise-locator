The PPP demonstration program will build capacity \nfor  developing,  procuring,  and  managing transparent  PPPs,  and finance  a demonstration  PPP \nfor socially inclusive, efficient, and quality elderly care services (ECS) in one municipality of the \nPRC (Yichang, Hubei). The program will serve as a demonstration for other local governments \non  how  PPP  can  be  used  for  the  delivery  of  public  social  services  and,  therefore,  may  create \nmore opportunities for ADB to finance inclusive and efficient service delivery in the PRC.2  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nStrategic Context \n\n \nA. \n \nSector context. One of the most significant social challenges facing the PRC today is a \n3. \nrapidly  aging  population.  The  proportion  of  people  above  the  age  of  60  across  the  PRC  is \nexpected  to  grow  from  around  14%  in  2016  to  34%  by  2050,  while  those  80  and  older  will \nincrease from  about  18 million  in 2010  to a projected  98 million  by  2050.3 As  a result  of  rapid \nurbanization,  the  impact  of  the  one-child  policy  on  families,  and  large-scale  internal  workforce \nmigration to urban areas, traditional family support systems are increasingly becoming unable to \nmeet elderly care needs. For the majority of elderly people, home- and community-based ECS \nare  the  preferred  option  but  are  inadequate  at  the  present  time.4   ECS  are  provided  by  public \nand  private  operators  and,  except  for  some  well-managed  ECS  facilities,  many  public  and \nprivate  residential  facilities  provide  low-quality  services.  Market-oriented  reforms  that  promote \nservice-oriented,  inclusive,  and  high-standard  ECS  catering  to  different  levels  of  care  are \nneeded.  The  diversity  of  the  demand  for  ECS  requires  an  innovative  response  that  offers  a \nrange of quality yet affordable services, including the use of technology-based approaches such \nas  telemedicine,  and  training  for  care  providers,  ranging  from  fully  dependent  and  semi-\nindependent residential care to different levels of community-based and home-based care.5 \n \nThe  Government  of  the  PRC  has  identified  Yichang  as  the  preferred  municipality  to \n4. \nimplement a pilot PPP ECS as the Yichang municipal government (YMG) recently approved the \nYichang  Long-Term  Care  Services  Strategic  Plan,  2016\u20132030,  which  is  a  long-term,  strategic \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  PPPs have been identified as a major driver of ADB\u2019s partnership with the PRC, particularly to promote efficiency \nand  quality  of  services.  ADB\u2019s  support  for  PPPs  is  aligned  with  the  PRC\u2019s  long-term  goals  of  achieving  more \neffective  delivery  of  services  to  the  elderly,  and  the  proposed  loan  is  the  first  in  a  series  to  strengthen  local \ngovernment implementation of ECS included in the country program pipeline. \n\n3  United Nations. 2011. World Population Prospects: The 2010 Revision. New York.  \n4 The  favored  national  policy  of  90\u20137\u20133  is  based  on  the  broad  assumption  that  90%  of  the  elderly  are  either \nindependent or require only home-based care, 7% need more extensive community-based ECS, with the residual \n3% requiring residential-based care. Local government has traditionally just looked after and provided subsidy to a \ngroup  referred  to  as  \u201cthe  three  no\u2019s\u201d.  These  are elderly  people  with  no  income,  no  ability  to  work,  and  no  family \nsupport. \n\n5  Use of telecommunication and information technologies to provide clinical health care at a distance to help improve \n\naccess to home-based medical services that would often not be available to distant communities.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nplan  for  the  provision  of  ECS6 in  Yichang.  Yichang  is  a  third-tier  city  in  the  Yangtze  River \nEconomic Belt region, with 20% of its population, or almost 148,000 elders, over the age of 60 \n(which is higher than the national average of 15%). The city typifies the average medium-sized \ncity that characterizes much of the PRC outside of the coastal belt.7 Initial ECS demand analysis \nindicates  there  are  currently  about  2,000  elderly  people  who  need  residential  care  and  about \n23,000 who need home- and community-based care. The current absorption rate for residential \nECS (based on the number of beds utilized) and the projected penetration rate indicate that the \nECS facility market in Yichang is gaining momentum, and with adequate marketing by providers \nthere will be a demand for an additional 3,666 beds in 2017. The projections result in a revised \npenetration  rate of 1.58%,  a growth of  55%  over the  historical  penetration  rate of  1.02%. This \ninitial  demand  analysis  for  Yichang  shows  that  the  proposed  number  of  beds  for  the  program \n(1,255)  will  satisfy  only  a  percentage  of  the  demand  for  care  needs  of  Yichang\u2019s  elderly \npopulation.8  \n \n5. \nPoverty  and  social  analysis  reveals  that  there  is  a  high  demand  for  expanded,  good- \nquality  ECS  among those who  have lost their  spouses,  do  not  have a family  member  residing \nwith them,  are  infirm  or disabled,  or  are  elderly  women.  Currently  all  ECS facilities in Yichang \nhave lower service standards than those in major PRC cities. Furthermore, there are inadequate \nlinks between health care and ECS providers. Many ECS facilities do not have medical staff for \neven  basic  health  care.  There  is  a  clear  need  to  introduce  innovative  approaches  when \nexpanding ECS coverage to overcome such weaknesses. \n \n6. \nPublic\u2013private  partnership  policy  context.  The  design  and  implementation  of  PPPs \nfor the provision of public services face major regulatory, institutional, and financial challenges. \nPPP  implementation  in the  PRC  is  hampered  by  a  lack  of  transparency,  regulatory  gaps,  and \nPPP regulations that overlap and which are poorly coordinated with other regulations, including \nrules  on  land,  tax,  budget,  and  government  procurement.  PPPs  in  the  PRC  are  also  often \ncharacterized by a significant imbalance in the allocation of risks and responsibilities. Moreover, \nwhile  there  is  accumulated  experience  in  infrastructure  PPPs,  a  major  barrier  with  regard  to \nPPP  implementation  in  the  social  sectors  is  a  lack  of  knowledge  and  expertise  within  local \ngovernments  to  understand  the  intricacies  of  social  sector  PPP  design,  procurement,  and \ncontract management. Ministerial  and central guidelines  and requirements for  PPPs  issued  by \nthe  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  in  2015  indicate  that  the  policy  framework  is  improving  the \nenabling environment, but a lot needs to be done to translate this into PPP projects at the local \ngovernment level that are in line with international good practice for PPPs.9 \n \nThe  Government  of  the  PRC  considers  PPP  for  ECS  to  be  the  most  urgent  need  to \n7. \npromote  efficiency  and  quality  of  service  delivery.  The  government  wants  to  promote  a \nmechanism  for  genuine  and  transparent  PPPs  (i.e.,  transparent  bidding  processes  with  open \nand  fair  competition)  that  can  be  replicated  nationwide  to  (i)  close  the  gap  between  local \ngovernment  fiscal  capacity  and  the  increasing  demand  for  social  services;  and  (ii)  search  for \ninnovation,  better  technology,  and  management  skills  to  tackle  sophisticated  issues  such  as \nelderly  care.  PPPs  have  been  implemented  in  the  PRC  since  the  late  1980s  but  the  policy \n\n                                                \n6  ADB. 2016.

Unpublished.  \n\n9  The current policy framework governing PPP has evolved over time and is a patchwork of measures.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\n \n\nProgram Rationale \n\nemphasis  of  PPPs  has  significantly  shifted  since  2014.10 In  2014,  the  Third  Plenum  of  the \nCommunist  Party  of  China  called  for  a  decisive  role  for  the  market  in  delivering  public \nservices.11 Between  late  2014  and  May  2015,  the  MOF  and  the  National  Development  and \nReform  Commission  compiled  a  database  of  more  than  7,700  PPP  project  proposals \n(amounting to $1.37 trillion), and selected 200 demonstration PPPs to be developed in the next \nfive-year  period.12 However,  such  PPPs  need  to  be  based  on  firm  policy  foundations,  political \ncommitment,  and  a  sound  and  predictable  legal  and  regulatory  environment.  Market  players \ngenerally require that these policy conditions and the public sector capacity are in place when \nconsidering their participation in a project.  \n \nB. \n \nIt is in the above context that the Government of the PRC has requested ADB\u2019s support \n8. \nto  help  transform  how  local  governments  implement  PPPs  that  provide  value  for  money;  are \nwell designed, transparently contracted, and well managed; and deliver effective services to the \npublic.  The  government  seeks  a  sound  mechanism  for  the  provision  of  integrated  community- \nand home-based ECS that can be replicated nationwide. The program is aligned with the PRC\u2019s \n13th Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020, which supports strengthening the ECS system in the PRC,13 \nand  with  government  policies  for  introducing  and  expanding  PPP  in  public  services  to  bring \nefficiency,  innovation,  and  quality  that  is  affordable.  Recent  policy  directives  issued  for  the \ndevelopment  of  the  ECS  industry 14  recognize  the  need  to  improve  services  and  human \nresources, develop the ECS market, and outline the role of local governments and private social \ncapital.  The  program  is aligned with ADB\u2019s  country  partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020  pillars  on \ninclusive  growth  and  institutional  and  governance  reforms;15 the  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy \n2020;  the  Operational  Plan for  Health,  2015\u20132020;  the  Public\u2013Private  Partnership  Operational \nPlan,  2012\u20132020;16 and  the  Upper  Middle-Income  Country  Approach  Paper.17 It  also  supports \nthe programming priorities included in the operational directions for 2016.18 \n \nBuilding  local  government  capacity  to  apply  appropriate  laws  and  developing  a \n9. \ndemonstration ECS PPP requires the use of the national regulatory framework for PPPs while \nproviding  results-based  financing  to  support  the  YMG\u2019s  program  to  implement  PPPs  for  ECS. \nTo  systematically  build  institutional  capacity  and  create  the  best  demonstration  practice  for \napplication  by  other  local  governments,  the  program  will  (i)  use  national  PPP  frameworks  and \nlocal regulations, (ii) focus on results and performance, (iii) take a risk-based approach, and (iv) \n                                                \n10  Traditionally, state-owned enterprises have had bigger participation in PPPs in the PRC while foreign and market \ninvestors have had little space in the market. Market players and social capital partners often include state-owned \nenterprises. \n\n11 Government  of  the  PRC,  State  Council.  2014.

RBL is the \nmost  appropriate  modality  to  finance  the  program  to  strengthen  capacity  to  design,  manage, \nand  implement  a  true  PPP  in  ECS  using  national  regulations  and  guidelines  because  it  will \nleverage ADB financing to transform service delivery by  the YMG, and enable other municipal \ngovernments to replicate future similar programs without ADB financing in a sustainable manner.  \n \n10. \nADB\u2019s  value  added  is  in  introducing  international  expertise  and  good  practice  models \nand  supporting  an  honest  dialogue  between  potential  bidders  and  the  local  government  that \nensures transparency and credibility to design a quality PPP project that (i) offers genuine value \nfor  money,  (ii)  generates  high-level  policy  dialogue  with  the  government,  and  (iii)  translates \nnational  PPP  policies  into  an  actionable  PPP  approach.  Most  importantly,  local  governments, \nincluding  the  YMG,  are  currently  ill-prepared  to  take  on  transformational  PPP  projects  without \nextensive  external  support.  ADB\u2019s  support  is timely  and  will  introduce  innovation,  contribute to \nknowledge  on  local-level  PPPs  and  ECS  standards,  and  have  a  high  demonstration  impact. \nADB has already gained credibility with the  Government of the PRC for responding to its PPP \nagenda  with  an  appropriate  mix  of  policy  dialogue,  sharing  of  international  experience,  and \nproposing an innovative approach. These efforts have placed ADB as a lead partner in the area \nof PPP and local government delivery of ECS. \n \nC. \n \nThe  program  is  anchored  in  the  long-term  care  (LTC)  plan, 19  which  focuses  on \n11. \nstrengthening the public system of ECS delivery and introducing PPPs to increase the supply of \nfacilities. At the request of the Government of the PRC, ADB has provided extensive support to \nthe  YMG  in  designing  the  program,  which  will  support  the  PPP  cornerstone  of  the  LTC  plan, \nwhile  a  public  sector  loan  in  2017  will  support  strengthening  of  the  public  system  of  ECS \ndelivery. The program will be guided by YMG\u2019s policy framework for PPPs which is aligned with \nthe  State  Council  and  MOF  regulations  governing  PPPs  for  social  sectors.20 The  program  will \nintroduce  a  pilot  PPP  for  ECS  to  create  the  required  capacity  in  the  YMG  to  expand  socially \ninclusive, high-quality ECS using PPPs. It will also support Government of the PRC policies and \npriorities  for  introducing  and  expanding  PPP  in  social  sectors,  particularly  ECS,  by  mobilizing \nprivate  capital  to  expand  efficiency,  innovation,  and  quality  services.  The  Government  of  the \nPRC  has  espoused  a  long-term  programmatic  approach 21  so  as  to  create  an  enabling \nenvironment for transparent PPPs and encourage local governments to introduce PPPs in ECS \nand the health sector (para. 7). The broader Government of the PRC program envisions rolling \nout  PPPs  in  several  local  governments  during  the  13th  Five-Year  Plan  period,  while  the  RBL \nprogram in Yichang will serve as a demonstration for other local governments. \n \n \n \n                                                \n19   With the support of policy and advisory technical assistance financed by ADB since 2014 (ADB. 2014.

The program has two outputs:  \n\n  \n\n(i) \n\n  \n\n(ii) \n\nLocal  government  capacity  to  design,  procure,  manage,  and  deliver \neffective  services  through  public\u2013private  partnerships  in  elderly  care \nservices  developed.  This  output  includes  capacity  building  to  systematically \naddress the challenges faced by local governments to optimize PPP design and \nimplementation  within  the  national  regulatory  framework.  This  will  help  manage \nthe risk of using PPPs to introduce advanced elderly care concepts, ensuring that \nlocal  governments  have  PPP  systems  in  place  to  (a)  introduce  innovative  and \nelderly and environmentally sustainable design features in the ECS facilities; (b) \ndevelop  key  performance  indicators  that  take  account  of  international  ECS \nstandards  and  are  compatible  with  national  guidelines;  (c)  develop  the  PPP \nstructure  and  financing  model,  including  a  social  inclusion  strategy;  (d)  provide \ntransaction  support  to  design  and  procure  the  PPP  concession  contracts  with \nECS  service  providers  (PPP  contracts);  (e)  perform  integrity,  financial  viability, \nand  safeguards  due  diligence  of  relevant  key  stakeholders;  (f)  develop  and \ndeliver  a  PPP  training  plan  for  relevant  YMG  staff;  (g)  develop  and  implement \nPPP  contracts  and  program  monitoring  systems  in the  delivery  of  services;  and \n(h) disseminate lessons from ECS PPP implementation. \n\nA  socially  inclusive  public\u2013private  partnership  demonstration  program  for \nelderly care services in Yichang successfully implemented. Financing will be \nprovided  to  enable  the  YMG  to  meet  agreed  key  performance  indicators  and \noutput  targets  for  well-designed  PPPs  to  provide  integrated  ECS  services \nincorporating inclusive and best-design features. Given the risks associated with \nintroducing a more complex PPP  in a third-tier city, the government will provide \nthe  land  and  undertake  basic  construction  of  the  ECS  facilities  with  appropriate \ndesign  parameters,  and  the  PPP  contract(s)  will  be  executed  with  the  private \nsector  to  fully  equip,  operate,  and  maintain  the  ECS  facilities.  The  program  will \nsupport the YMG to meet the care needs of the majority of its elderly people, who \nare  lower-middle  and  middle-income  pensioners  and  are  the  principal  target \nbeneficiaries  of  this  program.  The  integrated  ECS  facilities  are  expected  to \ninclude  residential,  medical,  and  nonmedical  services  and  provide  outreach \nservices  to  support  community-  and  home-based  care.  Community-  and  home-\nbased care provisions will be included within the PPP contracts. The services to \nbe  provided  by  the  concessionaires  to  residents  and  the  local  community  of \nelderly  people  will  cover  different  levels  of  care  needs  (from  mildly  to  fully \ndependent  elderly  people)  and  will  include  nursing  care;  skilled  cognitive  care; \nday  care;  social  counseling;  recreational  activities;  and  support  for  activities  of \ndaily living such as walking, bathing, dressing, toileting or incontinence, brushing \nteeth,  and  eating.  Home-based  care  will  include  a  range  of  services  such  as \nhousekeeping,  shopping  support,  preparation  of  meals,  routine  medical  check-\nups, and physiotherapy.  \n\n \n13. \nThe  program  has  a  concise  results  framework  based  on  PPP  capacity  building  needs \nand Yichang\u2019s LTC plan. Disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs) of the RBL program are based \non the program\u2019s results framework, are the basis for disbursing ADB financing, and correspond \nto  the  program\u2019s  financing  needs.  The  proposed  DLIs  were  selected  within  five  results  areas \nand  formulated  for  their  criticality  for  achieving  high  quality  and  efficient  ECS  that  will  be \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\ndelivered through PPPs in the integrated ECS facilities (Table 1).22  \n \n\nTable 1: Disbursement-Linked Indicators \n\nShare of Total \nADB \nFinancing (%) \n \n\nDisbursement \nAllocated \n($ million) \n \n4 \n2 \n \n1 \n \n33 \n10 \n50 \n\nIndicator \nOutcome \n1.

However, the \n\nexact number of ECS facilities will be finalized during the detailed feasibility design and agreed with ADB. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\n \n\nProgram  financing.  It  is  estimated  that  the  YMG  will  provide  $55.0  million  and  the \n15. \nprivate sector will provide $23.4 million for the program. The YMG has requested a loan of $50 \nmillion  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  to  help  finance  the  RBL  program.  The  loan  will \nhave a 26-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an annuity repayment method based \non  a  9.50%  discount  factor,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15% \nper  year,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  program \nagreements. Based on this, the average loan maturity is 18.96 years and the maturity premium \npayable to ADB is 0.20% per annum.23 The financing plan is summarized in Table 3.  \n \n\nTable 3: Program Financing Plan \n\nSource \nGovernment \nPrivate sectora  \nAsian Development Bank \n \nTotal \na  Assumes  that  private  service  funds  initial  investments  in  furniture,  equipment,  mobilization,  including  taxes  and \ncontingencies,  and initial  working capital  of  $4.7 million  and  recurrent  costs  of  $18.7  million  will be covered  from \ntariff revenues. \n\n42.9 \n18.2 \n \n38.9 \n100.0 \n\nOrdinary capital resources (loan) \n\nShare of Total (%) \n\nAmount ($ million) \n\n50.0 \n128.4 \n\n55.0 \n23.4 \n\nCapacity Development and Program Action Plan \n\nSources: Asian Development Bank estimates and prefeasibility study. \n \nDisbursement  arrangements.  The  program  will  provide  advance  financing  and \n16. \nfinancing for the prior result relating to securing the sites for the ECS facilities (DLI 2), which is \nessential to the successful subsequent implementation of the program. The YMG may submit a \nwithdrawal  application  upon  achievement  of  any  DLIs,  along  with  evidence  verifying \nachievement  of  the  DLIs,  and  also  for  the  advance  financing  and  for  the  achievement  of  the \nprior  result.  Verification  mechanisms  and  protocols  have  been  established  using  public  and \nindependent  sources and are  clarified  in the  verification  protocols.  Disbursements  are  allowed \nfor partial, early, or late achievement of DLIs, and will be made to an account specified by the \ngovernment for the purpose of program implementation. \n \nF. \n \nThe  YMG  does  not  currently  have  the  necessary  experience or  capacity  to  design  and \n17. \nimplement PPPs. Therefore, capacity development is embedded in the design of the program, \nwith  output  1  supporting  transparent  PPP  development,  and  this  has  already  started  during \nprogram  preparation.24 The  RBL  program  will  build  capacity  through  the  YMG  engaging  key \nexperts  who  will  work  alongside  the  program management  office (PMO) and  the  PPP team  of \nthe Yichang Finance Bureau (YFB) and Yichang Civil Affairs Bureau (YCAB) to develop service \nstandards  for  ECS;  support  financial  management,  procurement,  and  contract  management; \ndevelop  monitoring  systems;  implement  the  PPP  projects;  and  facilitate  dissemination. 25  A \nprogram action plan, incorporating actions for capacity building, is included. \n \nG. \n \nThe program will be implemented from January 2017 to December 2022, while the PPP \n18. \ncontracts are expected to operate for 25 years. The oversight of the broader PPP program will \nbe  led  by  the  Government  of  the  PRC  acting  through  the  National  Development  and  Reform \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n                                                \n23 Loan Agreement and Program Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n24 Using policy and advisory technical assistance (footnote 19). \n25 Program  Implementation  Document  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2)  has  detailed \n\ncapacity building component description. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nCommission  and  MOF.  The  program  executing  agency  is  the  YMG,  which  assumes  overall \naccountability for the program. The YMG has established a high-level coordinating and program \nleading  group  to  oversee  the  program.  This  leading  group  will  be  led  by  the  vice-mayor  with \nhigh-level  representation  from  the  YCAB,  Yichang  Development  and  Reform  Commission, \nYichang  Environmental  Protection  Bureau,  YFB,  Yichang  Health  and  Family  Planning \nCommission,  Yichang  Housing \nInvestment  and  Development  Company,  Yichang  Land \nAdministration  Bureau,  and  Yichang  Planning  Bureau.  Under  the  program  leading  group,  a \nPMO will be established, which would be placed in the YFB during the program preparation and \nPPP operator selection stage and be transferred to the YCAB during the implementation stage \nof the PPP contracts. The PMO will act on behalf of the YMG to manage all the preparation and \nimplementation  activities,  and  play  a  leading  role  in  (i)  communicating  and  coordinating  with \nADB;  (ii)  coordinating  with  all  involved  agencies,  departments,  and  institutes  for  program \nreports,  safeguards \nimplementation; \nmonitoring reports, and annual audit reports to ADB; (iv) carrying out program performance and \ncompliance monitoring; and (v) reviewing withdrawal applications and supporting documents. \n\nimplementation  progress \n\n(iii)  submitting  program \n\n \nThe  program  implementation  agencies  include  the  YCAB,  YFB,  and  Yichang  Housing \n19. \nInvestment  and  Development  Company.  The  YFB  will  be  responsible  PPP  design  and \nprocurement, and will also support program monitoring throughout the life of the program. The \nYichang  Housing  Investment  and  Development  Company  will  be  responsible  for  the  basic \nconstruction  of  the  ECS  facilities.  The  YCAB  will  be  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  a \nsocially inclusive ECS PPP demonstration program in Yichang, including contract management \nand supervision of ECS during the facilities design, equipping, and operation stages.   \n \n\nIII. \n\nSUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n\nProgram Technical Assessments \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  program  is technically  sound  and in  line  with  the  YMG\u2019s  LTC  plan, which includes \n20. \nthe expanded use of PPPs. Piloting a demonstration ECS PPP will help the YMG strengthen its \nsystems  for  designing  and  managing  PPPs,  and  will  help  raise  much-needed  resources  and \ninnovation from the private sector for ECS. The PPP based on service contracts will attract ECS \nproviders  rather  than  developers.  The  program\u2019s  proposed  implementation  arrangements  are \nappropriate  to help  the YMG  develop  capacity for  ECS  PPPs. The program\u2019s  expenditure  and \nfinancing plan is based on appropriate assumptions for demand and services as concluded by \nthe  prefeasibility  study  and  preliminary  market  sounding  and  shows  that  the  projected  tariff \nrevenue of CNY2,100 per month per elderly person will be sufficient to make the PPP viable. \n \n21. \nThe program will have a substantial economic impact as it will protect vulnerable elderly \nfrom  health  or  disability  shocks,  reduce  the  possibility  of  extended  hospital  stays,  and  create \nemployment  opportunities  in  geriatric  care.  The  program  also  has  positive  social  impacts, \nproviding  the  elderly  population  with  services  that  are  of  a  higher  quality  and  standard  than \nthose  that  exist  currently  in  Yichang.  The  program  targets  elderly  people,  11%  of  whom  are \nabove  80  years  of  age,  with  lower-middle  and  middle-income  pension  levels  in  Yichang  city. \nLow-income  pensioners  will  be  included  using  a  cross-subsidy  or  government  subsidy \nmechanism,  details  of  which  will  be  considered  during  the  detailed  PPP  feasibility  and  design \nstage. The program will mainly benefit people who require assisted living, and it will also benefit \nelderly women who are more vulnerable given the care burden on other family members.  \n \nB. \n \n22.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  system  and  institutional  assessment.  The  YMG  has \n\nProgram Systems Assessments \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\n \n\nsuccessful  past  experience  in  the  implementation  of  a  recent  ADB  project  that  introduced  a \nwidely acclaimed bus rapid transit system.26 With capacity building under the program, the YMG \nwill  be  able  to  successfully  implement  an  ECS  PPP  and  strengthen  monitoring  systems  for \nimplementation within both the YFB and YCAB.   \n \n23. \nFiduciary systems. The procurement and financial management systems assessments \nconfirm that the program will need to support the YMG to strengthen its capacity for designing, \nprocuring, and implementing PPPs for ECS. The Government of the PRC\u2019s Procurement Law, \nunder certain conditions and procedural controls, allows for competitive negotiation, competitive \nconsultation,  and  single-source  procurement,  which  does  not  necessarily  comply  with  ADB\u2019s \nkey procurement principle of open competition. The program\u2019s design will introduce measures to \nexclude the use of such noncompetitive practices.  \n \n24. \nThe Guidelines to Prevent or Mitigate Fraud, Corruption, and Other Prohibited Activities \nin Results-Based Lending for Programs were explained to and discussed with the government \nand the YMG.27 \n \n25. \nSafeguard systems. The program\u2019s environmental impacts are confirmed as category B. \nUnder the program some existing buildings will be remodeled or partially demolished, and new \nbuildings constructed at the selected sites. A potential benefit of the program is the opportunity it \nprovides to incorporate green building and space features. Potential adverse impacts are noise \nand dust; disposal of solid waste and fugitive dust generated during construction, demolition, or \nremodeling; and noise generated by construction work and use of heavy mechanical equipment. \nThese impacts are temporary and can be mitigated to comply with the applicable environmental \nstandards. The program will not have any impact on virgin land, and it avoids protected areas, \necologically  sensitive  habitats,  and  cultural  heritage  sites.  An  environmental  action  plan  will \nguide environmental mitigation by complying with the local environmental regulatory framework \nand  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  and  an  information  disclosure  mechanism  for \nprogram environmental safeguards will be established. YMG has the capacity and resources to \nimplement the environmental mitigation measures of the program. \n\n \n26. \nThe program\u2019s involuntary resettlement impacts are confirmed as category C, and none \nof the involuntary resettlement policy principles in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement apply for \nthe  program.  The  program  will  not  acquire  any  land,  negatively  affect  income  and  livelihood \nsources,  or  affect  access  to  common  property  and  resources  of  any  person  or  community.  In \nfact, it will provide employment for both skilled and unskilled workers at construction sites and at \nthe ECS facilities. The program is category B for indigenous peoples as ethnic minority elderly \npeople are expected to benefit from the program. Ethnic minority elderly people will be provided \nequal  access  to  ECS,  and  the  program  action  plan  will  ensure  that  ECS  providers  make \nnecessary provisions for appropriate recreational activities and any special dietary requirements.  \n\n \n\nIntegrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \n\nC. \n \n27. \nThe program is piloting a new approach with a local government in a third-tier city in the \nPRC,  making  this  an  overall  high-risk  program,  but  the  overall  benefits  derived  from  building \ncapacity  and  demonstrating  innovative  ECS  far  outweigh  the  costs  and  risks.  Major  risks  and \nmitigating measures are summarized in Table 4.  \n \n\n                                                \n26 ADB.  2013.

The results at risk are (i) protracted land \nallocation and delayed construction of the facilities \nimpact timely commencement of the bidding process for \nservice provider(s) for the ECS facilities, and (ii) the \nfacilities are not made operational in a timely manner. \nExpenditures and financing. Risks identified in this \nassessment include (i) underestimation of cost \nestimates, (ii) counterpart funding shortfalls, (iii) \nfinancial failure of the PPP contractors, and (iv) demand \nfor ECS falling short of expectations.    \n\nFiduciary. The very limited YMG experience in the \nprocurement of international consultants and PPP \ncontracts could seriously reduce the effectiveness of \nthe program in achieving desired outcomes.  \n\nS \n\nH \n\nYMG will make effort to allocate land in a timely \nmanner, complete construction, and retain key staff \nuntil the PPP contract(s) is effective. The capacity \nbuilding phase will support timely contracting of \nECS providers. \nThe expenditure framework is based on rigorous \nprefeasibility-stage modeling, with adequate \ncontingencies. ECS is a high-priority subsector for \nYichang and visible high-level political support \nsuggests funding will be made available in a timely \nmanner. Financial failure of the ECS providers will \nbe mitigated through careful financial appraisal of \npotential bidders, and the use of a financial \nperformance bond will be considered. Demand risk \nand its mitigation will be further assessed through \nmarket sounding.  \nThe program includes capacity building for the \nprocurement of PPPs using country regulations \nand systems governing PPPs, but with conditions \nfor transparent procurement. ADB will closely \noversee procurement capacity building consultants.   \nMarket sounding is being conducted to raise \nawareness and prepare a commercially viable \nPPP. \n\nS \n\nOperating environment. Yichang is a third-tier city \nwith limited quality private ECS providers, and there is a \nrisk that private and social capital ECS providers may \nnot be interested in bidding. \nOverall RBL program risk \nH \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  ECS  =  elderly  care  services,  PPP  =  public\u2013private  partnership,  RBL  =  results-based \nlending, YMG = Yichang municipal government.  \nRisk factors are assessed against two dimensions: (i) the likelihood that the risk will occur, and (ii) the impact of the risk on \nthe outcome.

\n\n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \nA. \n \n\nDisbursement Principles \n\nDISBURSEMENT-LINKED INDICATOR DISBURSEMENT PRINCIPLES AND PROCEDURES \n\nFinancing  prior  results.  The  Public-Private  Partnerships  Demonstration  Program  to  Transform  Delivery  of  Elderly  Care \nServices  in  Yichang  will  finance  prior  results.  The  prior  result  that  has  been  selected  is  one  that  is  critical  to  the  successful \nsubsequent implementation of the program, and need to be accomplished at the latest by the effectiveness date of the program. The \ntotal amount for such financing is $3 million which does not exceed 20% of the ADB financing (i.e., $10 million). The time frame for \nsuch financing is within 12 months before the signing of the legal agreements. \n\n \nAdvance  financing.  The  program  will  also  provide  advance  financing  up  to  the  amount  of  $12  million,  so  that  the  total  of \n\nfinancing for prior results and advance financing does not exceed 30% (i.e., $15 million) of ADB financing.  \n\n \nPartial  disbursements  are  allowed.  Partial  disbursements  are  allowed  for  DLI  3  and  DLI  4  and  the  formulas  for  partial \ndisbursement are detailed in the verification protocols (see Table A3.2 below). Once the remaining targets are met for any partially \nmet DLI, the balance of disbursement allocation for the DLI can be disbursed. \n\n \nDisbursement Procedures \n\nB.  \n \n\nYMG may submit a withdrawal application upon achievement of any DLIs, along with evidence verifying achievement of the \nDLIs. YMG may also submit a withdrawal application upon approval of the loan for the advance financing and for achievement of the \nprior  result.  Disbursements  are  allowed  for  early  or  late  achievement  of  DLIs.  Verification  mechanisms  and  protocols  have  been \nestablished using public and independent sources and are clarified in the verification protocols. \n \n\nThe  PMO  will  collect  all  reports  and  information  necessary  to  verify  accomplishment  of  the  DLIs  and  prepare  a  draft  DLI \nachievement  report.  Achievement  reports  will  refer  to  the  month  and  year  of  the  DLI  achievement  indicated  in  the  DLI  Table  A3.3 \nbelow. All such reports will be appropriately authorized by a designated signatory, acting for and on behalf of YMG who will make the \nwithdrawal application accompanied by the evidence of DLI achievement. Where ADB identifies issues with the DLI achievement, it \nwill relay its concerns to the YMG within one month of its receipt of the withdrawal application for further verification.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nTable A3.2:  Verification Protocols \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n17 \n\nDLIs \n\n \n\nDefinition and Description of Achievement and \nVerification Timeframe \n\nInformation Source and \nFrequency \n\nVerification Agency and Procedure \n \n\nOutput 1: Local government capacity to design, procure, and manage ECS PPPs developed \nDLI 1 \nYMG\u2019s PMO capacity in PPP \ndesign, management, and \neffective service delivery built. \n \n\nDefinition \nYMG will establish a dedicated PMO for the program which \nwill  together  with  relevant  personnel  undertake  training \nrequired for the PPP. \n \n\n \nCapacity building consultant \nreports \n \n \n\n \nIndependent  verification  by  ADB  PPP \nspecialists. \n  \n\nOutput 2: A socially inclusive PPP demonstration program for the ECS sector in Yichang successfully implemented \nDLI 2 \nECS facilities with elderly and \nenvironmentally sustainable \nand inclusive design features \nconstructed. \n \n\n \nFinal  and  approved  detailed \ndesigns of the ECS facilities \nand constructed facilities  \n\nDefinition \nAll  ECS  facilities  must  be  designed  with  sensitivity  to  the \nspecific  needs  of  the  elderly  to  whom  these  ECS  facilities \nwill  cater  to.
