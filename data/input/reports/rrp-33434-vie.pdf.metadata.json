It  will  improve  tourism-related \ninfrastructure  in  Cambodia,  Lao  PDR,  and  Viet  Nam  (Greater \nMekong  Subregion  (GMS)  participating  countries  [GMSPC]), \nsupport pro-poor community based tourism projects in the rural \nareas of these countries, facilitate private sector participation in \ntourism  marketing  and  promotion,  establish  mechanisms  to \nincrease subregional cooperation, and facilitate the movement of \ntourists across borders. \n   \nRationale  The GMS is the fastest growing tourism destination in the world. \nThis is bringing in much-needed foreign exchange, creating jobs, \nand contributing to economic growth. However, growth in tourism \nis constrained by difficulties in access, the lack of investment in \ntourist  infrastructure,  the  absence  of  new  products  to  attract \nvisitors, and weaknesses in policy and institutional capacities. The \nGMS countries have a strong comparative advantage in tourism, \ndemonstrated by the high growth rates, but need to exploit it more \neffectively to use it as an instrument of poverty reduction and \nbroad-based economic growth. \n \nInvestments  in  access  roads,  airports,  river  piers,  sewerage \nservices,  solid  waste  management,  and  human  resource \ndevelopment are badly needed. Also needed are investments in \npro-poor, community-based tourism to put local communities at \nthe heart of tourism growth in the subregion. The poor need to \nshare  in  the  benefits  of  increased  tourism  and  to  participate \nactively in its growth. At the policy and institutional level, issues \nconcerning partnerships between the public and private sectors, \nand enhanced access to and within the subregion need to be \nurgently addressed.  \n \nTourism  development  in  the  GMS  needs  to  cater  not  only  to \nexpansion but also the effective management of current levels of \ntourism activity. Cultural traditions and natural habitats are under \nthreat. Mechanisms need to be developed so that tourists, host \ncommunities,  and  the  public  take  effective  responsibility  for \nconserving  and  strengthening  the  fragile  cultural  and  physical \nenvironment. ", "iv   \n \n  Tourism in the GMS has become increasingly multicountry. In a \nhighly competitive world tourism market, the GMS can survive and \ngrow only if it promotes a \u201cone holiday, several destinations\u201d type \nof tourism. Individual tourism sectors in the GMS countries can  \nonly   prosper   when   they   are   strongly linked to others. \n \nSubregional cooperation in tourism is not a slogan in the GMS\u2013it \nis central to its existence.  Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam \nhave  nascent  tourism  industries  and  have  recognized  the \nadvantages  of  cooperating  in  order  to  develop  new  products, \nimprove the policy climate and institutional capacities, strengthen \npromotion  and  marketing,  and  establish  effective  partnerships \nbetween the public and private sectors. With increased tourist \narrivals, higher incomes from tourism, and effective conservation \nand protection of the cultural and physical environment, these \ncountries  will  be  able  to  create  jobs,  reduce  poverty,  ensure \nequitable distribution of tourism benefits, and improve economic \nand social well-being. \n   \nObjectives   The Project aims to reduce poverty in the countries, contribute to \neconomic  growth,  increase  employment,  and  promote  the \nconservation  of  the  natural  and  cultural  heritage.  The  specific \nobjective of the Project is to promote sustainable tourism in the \nlower  Mekong  basin  countries  through  infrastructure \nimprovements, community and private sector participation, and \nsubregional cooperation. The Project will improve high priority, \ntourism-related infrastructure in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet \nNam, promote pro-poor, community-based sustainable tourism in \nrural  areas,  and  strengthen  subregional  cooperation.  It  will \nmitigate  environmental  degradation,  develop  human  resources, \nand  promote  cooperation  between  private  and  public  sectors \nwithin the GMS by establishing tourism marketing and promotion \nboards. The Project will comprise four parts: (i) tourism-related \ninfrastructure  improvements;  (ii)  pro-poor,  community-based \ntourism development; (iii) subregional cooperation for sustainable \ntourism;  and  (iv)  implementation  assistance  and  institutional \nstrengthening. \n   \nCost Estimates  The  total  cost  of  the  Project,  including  physical  and  price \ncontingencies, duties, taxes, and interest during construction, is \nestimated at $47.1 million equivalent. The foreign exchange cost \nis $30.2 million, or 64.1% of the total. The local currency cost, \nincluding duties and taxes, is $16.9 million equivalent, or 35.9% of \nthe  total.  The  estimated  costs  by  country  are  $20.7  million \nequivalent  for  Cambodia,  $14.2  million  equivalent  for  the  Lao \nPDR, and $12.2 million equivalent for Viet Nam. \n   ", "      v\nFinancing Plan  The  proposed  ADB  loans  will  be  $15.6  million  equivalent  for \nCambodia, $10.9 million equivalent for the Lao PDR, and $8.5 \nmillion equivalent for Viet Nam. The loans, from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds  resources,  will  have  a  repayment  period  of  32  years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of \n1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% during the amortization \nperiod. The Borrowers will be the Kingdom of Cambodia, Lao \nPDR,  and  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  their  respective \ncomponents.  The  proceeds  of  the  proposed  ADB  loans  will \nfinance the entire foreign exchange cost and part of the local \ncurrency cost of the three components.

In Viet Nam, the provincial \npeople\u2019s committees of An Giang and Tien Giang provinces will \nbe the EAs for part A of the Project. The EAs will be supported by \nIAs  in  charge  of  implementing  infrastructure  improvement \nsubprojects.  \n   \nImplementation  The implementing agencies (IAs) in Cambodia will be the Ministry \nArrangements  of Public Works and Transport, State Secretariat of Civil Aviation, \nand Phnom Penh Municipality; and in the Lao PDR, the IAs will be \nthe division of communications, transport, posts and construction \nof  Louang  Phrabang  and  Khammouan  provinces,  and  the \nDepartment of Civil Aviation. Project coordination units (PCUs), to \nbe  headed  by  a  project  director,  will  be  established  in  each \nnational tourism organization. The PCUs will be supported by the \nproject management units established in the IAs in Cambodia and \nLao PDR, and in the EAs in Viet Nam, and project implementation \nunits (PIUs) will be established at the provincial level for most \nsubprojects.  PCUs  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day \nmanagement,  and  monitoring  of  all  project  activities,  including \ncoordination  with  PCUs  in  other  GMS  participating  countries, \nPMUs, and PIUs. Each PCU will be staffed by a project director \nand six permanent staff, including a project manager, a financial \nofficer,  an  accountant,  an  environment  specialist,  a  social \nspecialist,  and  a  resettlement  specialist;  and  supported  by \ninternational and domestic consultants.   \n   \n   ", "      vii\nProcurement  Goods  and  works  to  be financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with ADB Guidelines for Procurement. International \ncompetitive bidding procedures will be used for major civil works \ncontracts estimated to cost over $1.0 million and supply contracts \nvalued over $500,000. Minor civil works will be procured through \nlocal  competitive  bidding  in  accordance  with  procedures \nacceptable  to  ADB.  International  shopping  procedures  will  be \nfollowed for materials and equipment packages estimated to cost \nmore than $100,000 equivalent but less than $500,000 equivalent. \nEquipment items that are locally available, and cost less than \n$100,000 equivalent, may be procured through direct purchase  \nin accordance with procedures satisfactory to ADB. For the pro-\npoor, community-based tourism component, where the proposed \nsubprojects will be relatively small, and scattered throughout the \nprovinces, the Project may fund nongovernment organizations to \nwork  in  a  collaborative  and  participatory  manner  with  local \ncommunities. \n   \nConsulting Services  To  support  the  implementation  of  the  Project,  a  total  of  346 \nperson-months  of  consulting  services  (127  person-months  of \ninternational and 219 person-months of domestic services) will be \nrequired for Cambodia; 241 person-months (104 person-months \nof international and 137 person-months of domestic services) for \nthe  Lao  PDR,  and  169  person-months  (63  person-months  of \ninternational  and  106  person-months  of  domestic  services) for \nViet Nam. The consultants will be engaged in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic \nconsultants.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The poor in rural areas will especially benefit from community- \nBeneficiaries  based  ecotourism  and  village-based  tourism  projects.  Isolated \nrural  areas  will  be  further  integrated  into  the  mainstream  of \nregional  economic  and  social  development.  Properly  planned, \necotourism development will reduce rural poverty by increasing \nrural employment and incomes; encouraging the conservation of \nthe  natural  and  cultural  heritage;  expanding  employment \nopportunities;  and  enabling  the  poor,  women,  and  indigenous \ncommunities to participate in and influence development projects \nthat directly bear on their own futures. Indigenous minorities and \nwomen,  in  particular,  will  benefit  from  ecotourism  and  village-\nbased tourism through training as guides and managers, provision \nof food and accommodation for tourists, and from the manufacture \nand sale of handicrafts.  Ethnic minorities will also increasingly \nvalue their own cultures as tourists and governments show an \ninterest in them and their survival. Increased exposure to tourism \nwill be accompanied by a corresponding awareness of the need to \nprotect the physical and cultural environments from social and \neconomic pressures. \n ", "viii  \n  The improvement of tourism-related infrastructure will bring major \nsocial benefits to residents in and around urban areas, local and \ninternational tourists, and the tourism industry.  Upgraded roads \nwill facilitate movement of population and goods, as will improved \nairports  and  river  facilities  that  will  increase  tourist  traffic.  An \nincrease in economic activity in the three countries, with increased \nemployment  and  higher  incomes,  is  likely.  The  provision  of \nefficient wastewater treatment and sewerage disposal systems \nwill  similarly  improve  the  health  and  general  quality  of  life  of \nresident  populations.  The  burden  on  women  in  particular,  on \nwhom much childcare and household activities depend, will be \nrelieved  with  improved  child  health.  Better  facilities  at  border \ncrossings will facilitate the movements for migrant workers and \nlocal tourists, and will contribute to the development of the wider \nregional economy. \n \nThe Project has high economic and financial benefits. Economic \ninternal rates of return range from 13.3% to 33.4%, and financial \ninternal  rates  of  return  from  2.2%  to  13.3%.  The  Project  will \ncontribute to increased tourism receipts of about $129 million in \nthe decade after implementation. \n   \nRisks and  The main risks associated with the Project are (i) delays caused \nAssumptions  by the lack of experience of the EAs in managing an ADB-funded \nproject; (ii) delays caused by the lack of effective coordination of \nthe national tourism organizations, other line agencies, provincial \nauthorities, and consultants; (iii) inadequate resources available \nfor counterpart funding; and (iv) the poor, women, and vulnerable \nrural communities who may face negative socioeconomic impacts \nor may not benefit from increased tourism. \n \nMitigation  measures  to  address  these  issues  include  (i)  the \nestablishment of well-staffed and equipped project management \nand implementation units in each country and the early creation of \neffective  project  management,  reporting,  and  coordinating \nprocedures, as well as training of local staff; (ii) inclusion of cost \nrecovery mechanisms for all infrastructure subprojects, especially \nby requiring tourists using the facilities to contribute most of the \nrequired funds for operation and maintenance; (iii) the ministries \nof  finance  of  each  country  have  confirmed  that  ADB-financed \nprojects  will  have  high  priority  in  budgetary  allocation  of \ncounterpart funds; (iv) resettlement frameworks and resettlement \nplans, which have been prepared for each country; (v) preparation \nfor each province of an ethnic minority participation strategy and \ngender  development  programs  to  protect  the  most  vulnerable \nminority groups; (vi) awareness campaigns,  directed  at tourists \nand local communities, that focus on the dangers of drug abuse \nand  the  health  risks  of  indiscriminate  and  commercial  sex \nactivities; and (vii) the provision of training  for the development  of \nmicro-businesses  in  areas  subject  to  tourism  expansion  and \ncapacity  building  for  the  rural  poor  in  community-based \necotourism to ensure that they will benefit from increased tourism.

I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the Kingdom of Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), and the \nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS): Mekong Tourism \nDevelopment Project. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  Following  the  request  of  the  GMS  Tourism  Sector  Working  Group,  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) approved technical assistance (TA)1 to prepare the Mekong Tourism \nDevelopment Project. The TA built on a previous ADB-supported study.2 The Project covers \nthree countries in the GMS\u2013Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam (GMS participating countries, \nGMSPCs). \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  Tourism is one of the world\u2019s most significant and dynamic socioeconomic sectors. The \ncombination of domestic and international tourism is probably the world\u2019s largest industry. It \ngenerates approximately 11% of global gross domestic product (GDP) and provides direct \nemployment to more than 200 million people. In 2001, there were 700 million international \ntourist arrivals, from which about 30% went to developing countries. International tourist arrivals \nin  developing  countries  have  been  growing  at  an  average  of  9.5%  annually  since  1990, \ncompared to 4.6% worldwide. Tourist arrivals in the GMS have been even higher, making the \nGMS  the  fastest  growing  destination  in  the  world.  Although  international  travel  has  been \nnegatively  impacted  by  global  insecurity  over  the  past  year,  tourist  arrivals  in  the  GMS \nincreased by nearly 7.5% in 2001. Within the GMS, tourist arrivals in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and \nViet Nam have increased even more rapidly. The growth in arrivals has averaged 26% per year \nin Cambodia, 25% in Lao PDR, and 20% in Viet Nam during the last 10 years. In 2001, tourist \narrivals are estimated at 0.61 million in Cambodia, 0.67 million in the Lao PDR, and 2.23 million \nin Viet Nam. Although tourism growth in the GMSPCs has been impressive, opportunities to \nattract additional visitors to these countries are still significant considering that 14.84 million \ntourists visited the GMS in 2001. \n \n4.  Tourist arrivals by itself is not an adequate indicator of the growth of the tourism industry.  \nReceipts from tourism are important. The average daily tourist spending of $55 in the GMSPCs \nis still low compared with other countries of the region. A high proportion of tourists visiting \nthese countries are low-budget tourists and backpackers. Further, tourists stay an average of \njust 5 days in each country. However, despite the low average level of spending and short stay \nin the countries, the tourism sector already accounts for 9.2% of GDP in Cambodia, 9.7% in the \nLao PDR, and 6.7% in Viet Nam. Significant opportunities exist to increase economic benefits \nfrom tourism by attracting high-spending tourists to the subregion through improved tourism \nproducts,  investments  in  tourism-related  infrastructure,  a  higher  quality  of  tourist  services, \nimproved skills in the industry, and the development and implementation of a dynamic and \nfocused marketing strategy. A key factor in increasing the economic benefits from tourism is to \nmaximize the number of days that tourists stay in the subregion. This will be achieved by \ndeveloping tourism circuits that integrate attractive destinations in the GMSPCs, improving \n                                                \n1 ADB. 1999.

Perhaps the \nmost important asset of the GMS is its multiplicity of cultures, unique physical features, and \nvaried flora and fauna that allow the promotion of \u201cone subregion, many destinations\u201d.  A key \nfactor in the rapid growth of tourism in the subregion is the recognition by the itinerant traveler \nthat the GMS is unique in its ability to offer multiple destinations in a single holiday package. \nCapturing this special subregional advantage will be at the heart of any strategy that seeks to \nincrease socioeconomic benefits from tourism. \n \n5.  Notwithstanding the rapid technological advances of the 20th century, tourism remains \nan essentially labor-intensive industry. It has high potential for employment generation\u2013every \nadditional hotel room creates about two jobs directly and several indirectly. The poor gain \ndisproportionately especially when tourism depends on remote, undeveloped destinations to \nprovide the diversity in products and experience that the current generation of tourists are \nlooking for. New jobs in the industry go mainly to immigrants from rural areas. Many of these are \nwomen  who  work  in  hotels,  travel  agencies, and  restaurants.  In  2001,  the  tourism  sector \nemployed approximately 10.3% of the total population working in Cambodia, 8.3% in the Lao \nPDR and 5.3% in Viet Nam.   \n \n6.  Given  the  comparative  advantage  that  the  GMSPCs  enjoy  in  tourism,  the  sector \nprovides one of the best opportunities to reduce poverty through increased foreign exchange \nearnings, diversified regional development, broad-based economic growth, expansion of the \nprivate sector, and employment creation. However, investments in infrastructure, community \nawareness and education, subregional cooperation, and human resources development are \nurgently required to ensure that tourism growth is sustained, while simultaneously protecting the \ncultural and environmental heritage of the countries in the lower Mekong River basin. Public \nsector investments in tourism will also provide a much-needed opportunity to involve local \ncommunities  in  planning,  managing,  developing,  and  protecting  tourism  destinations.  The \nsector\u2019s competitiveness will increase with the development of a larger number of diverse, high-\nquality tourism products that will enable a more equitable distribution of tourism benefits to the \npeople, especially the poor. The project framework is presented in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n7.  The GMS Tourism Sector. From the ski resorts of Yunnan in the north to the pristine \ntropical beaches of the Mekong delta in the south, the GMS offers the prospective traveler a \nstaggering wealth of opportunities and choice.  This includes six distinct cultures and 12 world \nheritage sites. The Mekong River is an evocative icon of the subregion. It is a unifying theme in \nan  otherwise  diverse  land,  and  along  its  2,400-kilometer  lower  basin  course from  Louang \nNamtha in the northern Lao PDR to My Tho in the Mekong delta in Viet Nam it provides a \nunique ribbon for the development of tourism circuits across the subregion. The project area \nintegrates spectacular architecture and pristine natural environments with traditional ways of life \nand rich cultural and religious destinations. All subprojects are along the Mekong River or will be \nclosely connected to the river. The Project will provide an excellent opportunity for developing \nalong the lower basin of Mekong River a circuit that integrates all the tourist destinations in a \nsingle package. \n \n8.  The GMSPCs have opened their tourist attractions to the rest of the world mainly in the \nlast decade. While the subregion has increased and improved its linkages by air, land, and \nwater, with the rest of the world and within the region, much remains to be done to improve \naccess, create and effectively market tourism products, improve quality, and enhance skills to ", "  3\n \nmanage an expanded tourism industry. A description of the GMS tourism sector and its recent \ndevelopment is provided in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n9.  The GMS Program. The formal framework for the initiation and elaboration of tourism \nsector  policies  and  plans  on  a  subregional  basis  is  the  multisectoral  GMS  Economic \nCooperation  Program  (the  GMS  program)  established  by  ADB  in  1992.  The  broad  policy \nobjectives of the program are the promotion of economic growth and the delivery of better lives \nfor all through recognition of the importance of subregional economic cooperation. From its \ninception, the GMS program has emphasized practical results through a wide range of specific \nprojects, principally in infrastructure. More recently, the importance of placing greater emphasis \non measures to reduce nonphysical barriers to trade and investment has gained recognition. \nHowever, a fundamental achievement of the first decade of the program has been the building \nof trust and confidence among member countries. With this foundation, a number of specific \nprograms have been initiated on a cooperative basis. Detailed information on tourism-related \nassistance to the GMS is presented in Appendix 2. \n \n10.  GMS Tourism Cooperation. Tourism is one of the eight priority sectors of cooperation \nwithin the GMS program and has been included as the 11th \u201cflagship\u201d program under the 10-\nyear GMS Program Strategic Framework. A working group comprising senior representatives of \nthe national tourism organizations (NTOs) was established in 1993 and implements agreed \nprograms and projects aimed mainly at promoting the GMS as a unique tourism destination. \nIndeed,  the  Tourism  Sector  Working  Group  (TWG)  has  established  its  own  permanent \nsecretariat  to  coordinate  the  plans  to  develop  and  promote  the  subregion  as  a  tourism \ndestination.    This  permanent  secretariat  is  the  Agency  for  Coordinating  Mekong  Tourism \nActivities (AMTA), established on 1 January 1997 within the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) \nin Bangkok. \n  \n11.  The GMS tourism cooperation program commenced in 1993. The 13th Meeting of the \nTWG took place in 2002. The TWG is supported by the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA), \nthe United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), and \nADB. Its meetings are often attended by representatives of the United Nations Education, \nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the World Tourism Organization (WTO). \nADB and ESCAP support the working group, finance meetings selectively, and provide TA for \nstudies  and  capacity  building  activities.  PATA  supports  AMTA  in  its  marketing  functions. \nUNESCO provides TA on conservation- related issues. It is also supporting the implementation \nof the award-winning Nam Ha eco-tourism project in Louang Namtha Province in the Lao PDR. \nWTO liaises with other agencies and identifies funding for various schemes. The program is \ntruly collaborative and impressive gains have been made in profiling tourism in the GMS.   \n \n12.  The Mekong Tourism Forum was set up by the Third Conference on Sub Regional \nCooperation in April 1994 with two main objectives: (i) to provide a platform for public and \nprivate sectors of the GMS countries to address subregional tourism issues, and (ii) to raise the \nprofile of the GMS as a tourist destination. The forum has convened seven times since 1996 \nand is today a major annual tourism event in the Asia and Pacific region. It is led mainly by the \nprivate sector through PATA. \n \n13.  The TWG promotes the subregion as a single tourist destination. The TWG\u2019s marketing \nactivities are coordinated by AMTA. PATA facilitates the identification of marketing opportunities \nfor the GMS countries. It also supports GMS tourism marketing selectively. AMTA, on behalf of \nthe TWG, has (i) prepared a GMS tourist map, (ii) organized GMS tourism booths in major ", "4  \ntourism events, (iii) established a GMS tourism website, and (iv) produced tourism promotional \nmaterials. The GMS Tourism Marketing Fund has also been established. \n \n14.  National  Tourism  Plans  and  Strategies.  The  GMSPCs  have  recently  completed \nnational tourism plans. A national tourism development plan for the Lao PDR, funded by the \nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and WTO, was completed in November 1998. \nThis was supplemented in August 1999 by a national tourism marketing plan, also funded by \nUNDP and WTO.  Both plans are designed to cover 15 year time frames, from 1999/2000. \nCambodia, too,  has  a national  tourism  development  plan  up  to  2005,  prepared  with  ADB \nsupport.3 In 1998, with the assistance of TAT, Ministry of Tourism (MOT) prepared a master \nplan for tourism development in Rattanak Kiri and Mondol Kiri provinces in Cambodia. Currently, \nthree regional tourism planning studies are being conducted in Siem Reap Province and along \nthe southern coastal provinces of Cambodia by the Singapore Tourism Promotion Board, TAT, \nand the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). Viet Nam has a revised 10 year master \nplan for sustainable tourism development prepared in 2001 with UNDP and WTO assistance. \nThe individual country plans take into account the synergies available through collaborative \ntourism planning and marketing at the subregional level. \n \n15.  At the subregional level, the Mekong-Lancang River Tourism Planning study funded by \nADB4 and completed in 1998 has been the foundation of overall GMS tourism sector planning. \nThe study provided an initial assessment of the potential for tourism cooperation to develop the \nMekong River as a unifying, central tourism attraction. What is needed, however, is an overall \nGMS tourism-planning framework to guide tourism development in the subregion in the long \nterm. The objective is to optimize the mutually reinforcing country complementarities and obtain \nhigh, sustainable growth levels in the GMS. The Project will support the preparation of a GMS \ntourism plan building on this previous study. \n \n16.  Tourist infrastructure needs urgent attention to sustain existing levels of arrivals and \ncater to growth. Road network planning has paid little attention to tourist needs. Airports need \nupgrading to meet the growth in tourist traffic as does river transport infrastructure, especially in \nthe lower Mekong River basin. Many of the tourist destinations included in the Project are \ndifficult to reach, and become actually inaccessible during certain periods of the year. The \nobjective is to facilitate access to tourist destinations, generally using the Mekong River as a \nconnecting link between sites, and increase the reliability, safety, and comfort of transport \nservices so as to increase the volume of tourists and attract the high spenders. The need for \ninvestments in infrastructure is further underscored by the rapid growth and concentration of \nlarge  numbers  of  tourists  in  particular  destinations.  These  destinations  lack  infrastructure \nfacilities and this is damaging the environment of the sites and increasing health risks for \ntourists  and  local  people.  Investment  in  sewerage,  wastewater  treatment,  and  solid  waste \ninfrastructure  and  management  systems  is  urgently  required  to  ensure  the  economic  and \nenvironmental sustainability of these destinations. \n \n17.  The infrastructure improvement subprojects have been selected on rigorous criteria, \nincluding (i) determination of the subproject as a high priority investment for the development of \ninternational tourism at national and subregional levels and endorsement by the government \nconcerned; (ii) the number of tourists visiting the selected destinations has been increasing \nsignificantly in recent years showing a high demand for that particular destination; (iii) significant \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2000.

Growth in tourism brings in foreign exchange, creates jobs, and stimulates economic \ndevelopment. However, it also can damage the physical and cultural environment. GMS tourism \nis  beginning  to  show  evidence  of  uncontrolled  tourism  development  without  appropriate \nplanning, management, and participation of local communities that could lead to the destruction \nof cultural traditions and natural habitats. Urgent measures need to be taken by national and \nprovincial governments, the private sector, and local populations to educate tourists and train \nlocal  communities  to  manage  tourism  increases,  particularly  in  fragile  cultural  or  physical \nenvironments. A community-based tourism development program needs to be developed and \nimplemented to ensure that the poor and vulnerable, particularly indigenous peoples, women, \nand isolated communities in rural areas, are not negatively affected by tourism development, \nand increase their capacity to benefit from a growing tourism sector. Properly planned and \nmanaged ecotourism and village-based tourism development will provide a complementary \nsource of income to the rural poor, increase awareness about the value of their own cultural \nheritage and natural environment, and form the basis for sustainable poverty reduction and \nenvironmental  protection  in  the  areas  visited  by  the  tourists.  Equally,  policies  need  to  be \ndesigned that inhibit the leakage of benefits from increased tourism outside the GMSPCs and \nprevent their uneven distribution.          \n \n19.  The rationale for a subregional tourism development project derives from the crucial \nrecognition that development of a sustainable tourism sector in each GMSPCs in isolation from \nothers will become increasingly difficult in the highly competitive world tourism market. Individual \ncountry  attractions  will  only  be  sustained  in  a  multicountry  context.  Many  travelers  to  the \nGMSPCs are no longer visiting just one or two of the GMSPCs but all three. Among the \nGMSPCs, border crossings remain difficult and costly due to visa requirements. This is a key \ndeterrent  to  tourism  development.  The  inability  to  acquire  visas  on  arrival  at  most  of  the \ninternational border checkpoints in the GMSPCs is an important obstacle for the development of \ntourism. The promotion of the GMS as a single destination, development of joint circuits and \nproducts across countries within the subregion, harmonization of hotel classification systems, \nincreased participation of the private sector through establishment of tourism marketing and \npromotion boards, and facilitation of the movement of tourists across borders, will increase the \nattractiveness of individual destinations and countries, foster synergies across borders, and \nprovide new opportunities for sector development   \n \n20.  Lessons  Learned.  Some  major  lessons  with  regard  to  sustainable  tourism  sector \ndevelopment,  including  community-based  tourism  in  rural  areas,  and  timely  project \nimplementation have been learned from ADB interventions in other countries. Key lessons \ninclude the following: (i) community involvement in design and implementation can enhance ", "6  \nsubsequent operations, but such involvement may cost more and cause implementation delays; \n(ii) a clear view of the type of service to be provided is needed when designing facilities such as \ntourism information centers; (iii) the private sector will not automatically respond to the opening \nof new tourists sites and such sites should be actively marketed; (iv) the private sector should \nhave a role in the design of tourist sites to ensure that they are practical from a tour operator\u2019s \nperspective; (v) ecotourism can work, but facilities need to be carefully assessed; (vi) where \nthere are many inexperienced implementing agencies, the early and complete formation of a \nproject management unit is needed to avoid delays and other problems; and (vii) monitoring \nrequires specific attention from project supervisors at an early stage of implementation.   \n \n21.  Some  major  lessons  with  regard  to  tourism  related  infrastructure,  including  urban \nsewerage systems, airports, piers, and roads are related to cost recovery mechanisms, and \nfunding for operation and maintenance (O&M). Arrangements to generate adequate financial \nresources for project O&M should be identified and discussed with government agencies during \nproject preparation. These lessons have been factored into the design of the Project. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objective \n22.  The  Project\u2019s  goal  is  to  reduce  poverty  through  increasing  economic  growth  and \nemployment  opportunities,  increasing  foreign  exchange  earnings,  and  promoting  the \nconservation of the natural and cultural heritage. The specific objective of the Project is to \npromote  sustainable  tourism  development  in  the  lower  Mekong  River  basin  through \ninfrastructure  improvements,  increased  community  and  private  sector  participation,  and \nsubregional  cooperation.  The  Project  is  targeted  to  improve  high  priority  tourism-related \ninfrastructure  in the  lower  Mekong  basin;  promote  pro-poor,  community-based,  sustainable \ntourism in rural areas; and strengthen subregional cooperation. It will mitigate environmental \ndegradation from unplanned and unsustainable development, develop human resources, and \npromote cooperation between the private and public sectors within the subregion through the \nestablishment of tourism marketing and promotion boards (TMPBs). \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n23.  The Project will comprise four parts: part A, tourism-related infrastructure improvements; \npart B, pro-poor, community-based, tourism development; part C, subregional cooperation for \nsustainable tourism; and part D, implementation assistance and institutional strengthening. A \ndetailed description of the components is presented in Appendix 3. \n \n24.  Part A includes (i) urban environmental improvements (Siem Reap in Cambodia, and \nSam Mountain in An Giang Province and My Tho in Tien Giang Province in Viet Nam); (ii) small \nairports extension and rehabilitation (Louang Namtha in the Lao PDR and Rattanak Kiri and \nStung Treng in Cambodia); (iii) access roads improvement (road to the Genocide Memorial in \nCambodia and roads to Kwangsi Falls and Konglor cave in the Lao PDR); and (iv) river tourism \npiers development (My Tho in Tien Giang Province and An Giang Province in Viet Nam). \n \n25.  Part  B  includes  10  components:  (i)  an  institutional  strengthening  and  community \nparticipation program; (ii) an awareness program on tourism benefits and negative impacts, and \nenvironmental  and  cultural  conservation;  (iii) pro-poor  tourism  products  identification  and \ndevelopment;  (iv)  small-scale  tourism-related  infrastructure  (tourism  information  centers, \ncommunity lodges, small river piers, viewing points, and walking trails); (v) capacity building for ", "  7\n \ntourism-related local microenterprises and communities; (vi) a gender development program; \n(vii) an ethnic minorities participation program (this component not applicable in Viet Nam); \n(viii) a marketing and promotion plan; (ix) promotion of community-based tourism networks and \necotourism  stakeholder  associations;  and  (x)  a  system  of  monitoring  project  outputs  and \nimpacts. Part B will be implemented in two provinces in Cambodia (Stung Treng and Rattanak \nKiri), four provinces in the Lao PDR (Louang Namtha, Louang Phrabang, Khammouan, and \nChampassak), and two provinces in Viet Nam (An Giang and Tien Giang). \n \n26.  Part  C  includes  seven  components:  (i)  a  GMS  facility  for  tourism  cooperation; \n(ii) improvement of tourism facilities at border posts; (iii) establishment of a GMS network of \nTMPBs; (iv) a standardized GMS hotel classification system; (v) a GMS tourism plan; (vi) GMS \ntourism  statistics  improvement  and  harmonization;  (vii) diversification  of  AMTA  human \nresources; and (viii) GMS tourism human resource development.  \n \n27.  Part  D  includes  (i)  consulting  services  for  project  management  support,  tourism \ndevelopment  and  subregional  cooperation,  detailed  design  and  construction  supervision  of \ntourism-related  infrastructure,  and  pro-poor  community-based  tourism  development;  and \n(ii) incremental administration costs and project administration equipment. \n \nC.  Special Features \n28.  Subregional  Cooperation.  The  GMS  program  identifies  projects  and  institutional \nmechanisms that will enhance economic and social integration. The development of the GMS \nas a unified tourism destination will increase the international attractiveness of the subregion. \nThe Project will enhance subregional cooperation and increase economic integration of the \nsubregion  by  facilitating  the  movement  of  tourists,  increasing  the  attractiveness  of  key \nsubregional  tourism  destinations,  and  promoting  common  approaches  to  community-based \necotourism activities in the GMS, hotel classification systems, private sector participation, and \nplanning. Particularly, the GMS facility for tourism cooperation will facilitate the implementation \nof the bilateral agreements that were on hold due to lack of funding by supporting cross-border \nprojects involving at least two of the three participating countries or alternatively, one of the \nthree and another GMS country not included in the Project. The facility could fund (i) studies to \nprepare circuits and assess demand, (ii) building of small infrastructure to improve the circuits, \n(iii) a marketing program for the circuits, (iv) a system for monitoring economic benefits for each \ncountry, and (v) meetings and seminars to promote cooperation of the private sector on both \nsides of the border. The Project will also support upgrading of tourism and immigration facilities \nat border checkpoints within the GMS and expanding the points where visas on arrival are \nprovided. \n \n29.  All subprojects identified are either on the Mekong River or will have easy access from \nthe river due to the Project. The improvement of infrastructure in the selected subprojects and \nthe provision of visas on arrival at the border checkpoints will help tour operators prepare \ncircuits along the river that could integrate some or all the subprojects included in the Project. \nThe Project will complement other GMS projects supported by ADB, particularly the economic \ncorridors, including the northern section of the East-West Corridor along road number 8 in Viet \nNam5 from which the access road to Konglor Cave will be constructed, and the southern \n                                                \n5 ADB. 1999.

Other \nprojects under ADB consideration will also complement the Project, if approved, including the \nnorth-south corridor crossing Louang Namtha Province in the Lao PDR and the development \ntriangle project that could include the provinces of Strung Treng and Rattanak Kiri. \n  \n30.  One Project, Three Loans. The Project will involve three separate loans, one for each \nof the GMSPCs. Separate loan agreements will be signed with each of the three borrowers. \nDetailed  project  management  mechanisms  have  been  included  in  the  Project  to  ensure \ncoordination  among  the  GMSPCs  during  implementation.  AMTA  will  also  support  the \ncoordination of the Project as secretariat to the subregional steering committee and will link the \nProject with other GMS countries that are not participating. The chairmanship of the subregional \nsteering committee will rotate among the GMSPCs. \n  \n31.  Cost Recovery Mechanisms and Financial Sustainability. The Project will include \ncost  recovery  mechanisms  for  most  of  the  tourism-related  infrastructure  subprojects.  A \nsubstantial portion of the Project\u2019s capital and O&M costs will be recovered though charges, \nlevies, and taxes on the tourists using the improved facilities. Small charges on local users of \nthe  facilities  are  also  included  in  the  Project.  However,  significant  contributions  from \ninternational tourists will ensure that charges to local users, including the poor, are affordable. \nFinancial analyses have been undertaken for all infrastructure subprojects with cost recovery \npossibilities to ensure that each subproject generates sufficient revenue to cover O&M costs \nand, in most cases, capital costs, and with a rate of return that meets or exceeds the weighted \naverage cost of capital. Subsidies from government budgets will not be required.  \n \n32.  Private Sector Participation. The Project will promote private sector participation in \nmarket research, planning, and tourism marketing and promotion through initial support for the \nestablishment of TMPBs in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam. TMPBs will have leadership \nfrom the private sector and will mainly be financed from contributions from the private sector. \nThe TMPBs will promote dialogue between the private and public sectors; expand opportunities \nfor coordination in the development of plans, strategies, legislation, and marketing; and increase \nthe efficiency and international competitiveness of the tourism sector in each country and in the \nsubregion. The Project will also promote the establishment of micro and small tourist enterprises \nin  rural  areas,  through  the  pro-poor  community-based  component.  Capacity  building,  for \ncommunities and small entrepreneurs involved in the tourism industry, will be provided under \nthe Project.     \n \n33.  Poverty.  The  Project  has  been  classified  as  a  poverty  intervention  following  the \ngeographical classification criteria.  Substantial benefits will accrue to the poor and opportunities \nto reduce poverty will be created by the Project through increased employment and economic \ngrowth. About 39.8% of the population in the Project area are poor, including 42.8% in the Lao \nPDR, 38.5% in Cambodia, and 34.5% in Viet Nam. About 90% of the poor in the GMSPCs are \nin  the  rural  areas.  The  pro-poor,  community-based  tourism  component  of  the  Project  will \nparticularly benefit the poor in the rural areas in some of the poorest provinces in the subregion. \nThe improvement of environmental conditions in the urban areas of Siem Reap in Cambodia \nand Sam Mountain and Tien Giang in Viet Nam will consolidate the tourism sector in those \nareas, increase employment opportunities for the poor in those areas, and help improve the \nquality of life for the urban poor. The upgrading of airports in some of the most isolated areas of \n                                                \n6  ADB. 1998.

", "  9\n \nCambodia and Lao PDR will attract new tourists and increase the possibilities for the poor to be \nemployed  and  to  sell  their  local  products  at  a  higher  price.  Improved  access  to  tourist \ndestinations by air, land, and water will attract more tourists to isolated areas where poverty \nlevels are high. The pro-poor, community-based tourism components will help poor communities \nenhance their capacities to use the opportunities created by tourism development. The Project\u2019s \npro-poor tourism development activities are expected to improve incomes of poor beneficiaries \nby  at  least  25%.  These  estimates  are  based  on  studies  of  the  economic  impacts  of  the \nUNESCO-supported Nam Ha Eco-tourism Project in the Lao PDR, which has been used as a \nmodel for the development of part B of the Project. Studies in October 2001 demonstrate that, at \nthe village level, approximately 42% of all income was from ecotourism. Activities from which \nsuch incomes were derived include sale of nontimber forest produce, food preparation and sale, \nhandicraft sales, and services to tourists including guiding and traditional massage. As a result \nof the increases in individual household incomes as well as village funds, overall improvements \nin the food security of participating communities are expected. Village funds will enable the \ncreation of rice banks from which poor households can borrow and pay back in better times. \nVillage  funds  can  be  used  to  develop  village  infrastructure  such  as  tracks  and  schools. \nIndividual  households  will  benefit  by  improving  their  food  consumption;  access  to  clothes, \nblankets,  and  medicines;  investment  in  agricultural  equipment  and  tools;  and  household \nsavings. A summary poverty and social analysis is presented in Appendix 4; a more detailed \nsocial and poverty analysis is presented in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n34.  Gender. The tourism industry is particularly important for women. The percentage of \nwomen  employed  in  restaurants,  hotels,  and  other  tourism  services  is  higher  than  in  the \naverage  general  workforce.7  The  Project  will  particularly  benefit  women  through  increased \nemployment  opportunities  in  the  tourism  sector. The  participation  of  the  national  women\u2019s \norganizations machineries (Ministry of Women and Veteran\u2019s Affairs in Cambodia, Vietnam \nWomen\u2019s Union, and Lao Women\u2019s Union) in the national steering committees is important. This \nwill  help  to  ensure  that  the  implementation  of  gender  and  development  (GAD)  plans  is \neffectively  monitored,  and  GAD  issues  are  mainstreamed  in  tourism  development.  At  the \nprovincial level, a subproject gender action plan will be prepared by the project implementation \nunit (PIU) with the help of social advisers and the community-based tourism development \nadvisers. These plans will be in keeping with the ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development. \nThey will reflect all activities related to promoting women\u2019s equitable participation in tourism \ndevelopment and its benefits, to be implemented in a time-bound manner. All plans will set \ntargets. Generic principles that will form the basis of subproject-level gender planning are:  \n(i) under part B of the Project, 50% of all trainees in all training programs will be women; (ii) at \nleast 40% membership in ecotourism associations at all levels will be recruited to implement \npro-poor, community-based tourism activities; (iii) such women staff will be trained and will, in \nturn, help develop provincial GAD action plans, with targets that can be monitored; (iv) in \nkeeping with such action plans, women staff will (a) provide training to participating communities \nin GAD issues related to tourism; (b) help disseminate tourism-related skills particularly among \nrural women, and in association with the local women\u2019s machinery; (c) build strong village-\nbased women\u2019s groups for participation in ecotourism stakeholder associations and informed \ndecision making; (d) under the guidance of the social and gender advisers, community-based \ntourism advisers, and participating NGOs, help develop training and education programs related \nto  health  risks  of  HIV/AIDS8  and  sexually-transmitted  diseases;  (e)  design  and  implement \nawareness and training programs and workshops for government agencies, the private sector, \n                                                \n7  United Nations Development Programme-United Kingdom. 1999.

Resettlement. A social impact assessment identified subprojects that would involve land \nacquisition and resettlement. A total of 231 households (approximately 1,155 persons) will be \nsignificantly affected and will have to relocate to nearby sites. Of these, the main impacts will be \nfrom improvements to two airports\u2013Louang Namtha in the Lao PDR, and Rattanak Kiri in \nCambodia\u2013for  which  resettlement  plans  have  been  prepared.  There  will  also  be  marginal \nimpacts on 18 households from subprojects for which short resettlement plans have been \nprepared, and lesser marginal impacts from the remaining subprojects that will be covered by a \nresettlement framework. A table showing the significance of resettlement for each subproject, \nthe type of resettlement planning documentation required for each, and a summary resettlement \nframework for the Lao PDR is presented in Appendix 5. Summary resettlement frameworks for \nCambodia and Viet Nam, and full resettlement frameworks for the GMSPCs are provided in \nSupplementary Appendix C. The resettlement frameworks are intended to guide resettlement \nplanning for other subprojects that may involve minor involuntary resettlement and for which the \nzone of impact cannot be determined before appraisal due to lack of detailed design and the \nneed for a community participation process, such as in the pro-poor, community-based tourism \nsubprojects.  Following  detailed  design  of  the  remaining  subprojects  during  project \nimplementation, resettlement plans, using the agreed upon resettlement framework, will be \nprepared as required and submitted to ADB for approval prior to implementation. \n \n36.  During  project  preparation,  four  resettlement  plans  were  prepared  for  the  core \nsubprojects  that  will  be  implemented  during  the  first  year  of  the  Project,  as  well  as  a \nresettlement  framework  for  each  country,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement and the Handbook on Resettlement.  The resettlement plans are also provided in \nSupplementary Appendix C. As the proposed executing agencies (EAs) are not completely \nfamiliar with implementing land acquisition and resettlement to ADB standards, the construction \nsupervision  consultants  will  be  required  to  provide  resettlement  capacity  building  to  these \nagencies and to external monitoring agencies.  As the GMSPCs have, or are in the process of \npreparing, draft national resettlement policies with ADB assistance, the Project will encourage \nand support those efforts. \n \n37.  Environment.  The  Project  is  classified  as  environment  category  B.  Several  of  the \nproposed infrastructure subprojects (i.e., waste treatment, boat jetty, and road rehabilitation) \nmay  have  some  negative  environmental  impacts  arising  from  construction  and  operation. \nHowever,  the  potential  negative  impacts  can  be  mitigated  to  acceptable  levels  through \nappropriate design and implementation of mitigation measures included in the subprojects in \nline with ADB\u2019s environmental requirements and those applicable at the national and provincial \nlevels in each GMSPCs.  \n \n38.  The  governments  of  the  GMSPCs  have  assured  ADB  that  an  initial  environmental \nexamination (IEE) will be prepared for each subproject in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines, \nand that a determination will be made as to whether the subproject is environmentally sensitive. \nIf it is, the IEE will be amplified to address any significant environmental concerns, and if the \nconcerns are extensive, an environmental impact assessment will be prepared and reviewed by \nADB prior to the approval of the subproject. To ensure that ADB\u2019s environmental assessment \nrequirements are met during implementation of the Project, an environmental management plan \n(EMP) for the Project and four sample IEEs were prepared. The sample IEEs are for (i) Louang \nNamtha airport improvement in the Lao PDR, (ii) My Tho tourist river pier improvement in Viet \nNam, (iii) access road improvement to Konglor cave in the Lao PDR, and (iv) Siem Reap ", "  11\n \nenvironmental improvement in Cambodia. A summary IEE, including an EMP, and three sample \nIEE are presented in Supplementary Appendix D. The summary IEE for the environmental \nimprovement subproject in Siem Reap is presented in Appendix 6.    \n \n39.  To support the EAs and implementing agencies (IAs) in the GMSPCs in preparing IEEs \nfor other subprojects and to implement the EMP, at least one environment specialist will be \nplaced at each project coordination unit (PCU) at the national level. The specialist staff will also \nhelp ensure that all applicable national and provincial environmental laws, regulations, and \nstandards, as well as ADB\u2019s environmental requirements, will be met during implementation and \noperation of the project components. An environment unit will be established for each of the \nenvironmental improvement subprojects in Tien Giang and Sam Mountain in An Giang Province \nin  Viet  Nam,  and  Siem  Reap  in  Cambodia,  to  ensure  that  proposed  mitigation  measures \nidentified in the IEEs are incorporated in the design, construction, and operation stages of the \nProject. Environmental measures, on which action needs to be taken by the contractors, will be \nincorporated in the contracts for civil works. Implementation of the EMP and proposed mitigation \nmeasures  will  be  monitored  during  construction  and  operation.  Monitoring  results  will  be \nreported in the quarterly progress reports on project implementation and annual reports on \nenvironmental monitoring. \n \n40.  Ethnic Minorities. The pro-poor community-based tourism part of the Project has been \nprepared based on positive ecotourism pilot projects in the GMS that have particularly benefited \nethnic minorities. An ethnic minorities participation program will be prepared for each province in \nthe Lao PDR and the provinces of Stung Treng and Rattanak Kiri in Cambodia to ensure that \nthese groups enjoy the benefits of tourism, while any potential negative impact from tourism will \nbe mitigated through training and awareness programs in each province.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n41.  The total cost of the Project, including physical and price contingencies, duties, taxes, \nand interest during construction, is estimated at $47.1 million equivalent. The foreign exchange \ncost is $30.2 million, or 64.1% of the total. The local currency cost, including duties and taxes, is \n$16.9 million equivalent, or 35.9% of the total. The project cost for the Cambodia component is \n$20.7 million equivalent, comprising a foreign exchange cost of $13.0 million (about 62.8% of \nthe project cost) and a local currency cost of $7.7 million equivalent (about 37.2% of the project \ncost). The project cost for the Lao PDR component is $14.2 million equivalent, comprising a \nforeign exchange cost of $9.3 million (about 65.5% of the project cost) and a local currency cost \nof $4.9 million equivalent (about 35.5% of the project cost). The project cost for the Viet Nam \ncomponent is $12.2 million equivalent, comprising a foreign exchange cost of $7.9 million (about \n64.8% of the project cost) and a local currency cost of $4.3 million equivalent (about 35.2% of \nthe project cost). Cost estimates for each country are presented in Appendix 7. Detailed cost \nestimates are available in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n42.  The proposed ADB loans will be $15.6 million equivalent for Cambodia, $10.9 million \nequivalent for Lao PDR, and $8.5 million equivalent for Viet Nam. The loans, from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources, will have a repayment period of 32 years, including a grace period of \n8  years,  with  an  interest  charge  of  1.0%  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  during  the \namortization period. The borrowers will be the Kingdom of Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and the \nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam. The proceeds of the proposed ADB loans will finance the entire ", "12  \nforeign exchange costs and part of the local currency costs of the three components. The \nGovernments will bear the exchange risk and transfer the loan proceeds to the EAs and IAs. \n \nTable 1: Summary of Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n  Part     Foreign Cost Local Cost  Total\nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n43.  Project management will be challenging but feasible. The arrangements are seemingly \ncomplex but in fact rely mainly upon existing institutions and bodies. The EAs for the Project will \nbe the national tourism organizations (NTOs) in each country: the Ministry of Tourism for \nCambodia,  the  National  Tourism  Authority  of  the  Lao  PDR,  and  the  Vietnam  National \nAdministration of Tourism (VNAT). In Viet Nam, the provincial people\u2019s committee (PPCs) of An \nGiang and Tien Giang provinces will be the EAs for part A of the Project. A subregional project \nsteering committee (SRPSC) with chairpersons of the NTOs of Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet \nNam will be established to oversee overall project implementation at the subregional level, and \nthe subregional cooperation component in particular. AMTA will act as a secretariat of the ", "  13\n \nSRPSC. At the national level, national project steering committees will provide policy advice and \nguidance, and will oversee the general direction of the Project in each country. The committees, \nto be chaired by a senior representative of the NTOs, will consist of representatives from \nministries and provincial authorities involved in the Project. These arrangements are expected \nto  provide  effective  links  between  government  agencies  for  collaborating  on  tourism \ndevelopment in general. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \nSource  Foreign Local Total\n  Exchange Currency Cost Percentage\nCambodia \nADB  13.0   2.6  15.6  75.4%\nGovernment  0.0   5.1  5.1  24.6%\n  Total  13.0   7.7  20.7  100.0%\nLao PDR         \nADB  9.3   1.6  10.9  76.8%\nGovernment  0.0   3.3  3.3  23.2%\n  Total  9.3   4.9  14.2  100.0%\nViet Nam         \nADB  7.9   0.6  8.5  69.7%\nGovernment  0.0   3.7  3.7  30.3%\n  Total  7.9   4.3  12.2  100.0%\nOverall Project         \nADB  30.2   4.8  35.0  74.3%\nGovernments  0.0   12.1  12.1  25.7%\n    Total  30.2   16.9  47.1  100.0%\n          ADB = Asian Development Bank, Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \n          Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n44.  The EAs will be supported by IAs responsible for the implementation of infrastructure \nimprovement projects. The IAs in Cambodia will be the Ministry of Public Works and Transport, \nState Secretariat of Civil Aviation, and Municipality  of Phnom Penh (MPP). In the Lao PDR, the \nIAs  will  be  the  division  of  communications,  transport,  posts  and  construction  of  Louang \nPhrabang and Khammouan provinces, and the Department of Civil Aviation. For the Viet Nam \ncomponents, the EAs of An Giang and Tien Giang provinces will implement part A of the \nProject. \n \n45.  PCUs, to be headed by a project director, will be established in each NTO. They will be \nsupported by project management units (PMUs) established in the IAs in Cambodia and Lao \nPDR and in the other EAs in Viet Nam, and PIUs established at the provincial level for each \nsubproject. PCUs will be responsible for day-to-day management, and monitoring of all project \nactivities, including coordination with PCUs in other GMSPCs, PMUs, and PIUs. Each PCU will \nbe staffed by a project director and six permanent staff including a project manager, a financial \nofficer,  an  accountant,  an  environmental  specialist,  a  social  specialist,  and  a  resettlement \nspecialist, and supported by international and domestic consultants.  Project directors and PCU \nstaff have been appointed as well as deputy project directors for each PMU and PIU. The \nproject organization chart and project management mechanism is presented in Appendix 8. \n ", "14  \n2.  Implementation Period \n46.  The Project will be implemented over a period of 5 years until 31 December 2007. This \nis considered reasonable based on the proposed size of the individual subprojects and the \ncommitment  and  interest  shown  by  all  IAs.  An  implementation  schedule  is  presented  in \nAppendix 9. \n \n3.  Procurement \n47.  Goods and works to be financed by ADB will be procured in accordance with ADB \nGuidelines for Procurement. International competitive bidding procedures will be used for major \ncivil works contracts estimated to cost over $1.0 million and supply contracts valued over \n$500,000. Minor civil works will be procured through local competitive bidding in accordance \nwith procedures acceptable to ADB. International shopping procedures will be followed for \nmaterials and equipment packages estimated to cost more than $100,000 equivalent but less \nthan $500,000 equivalent. Equipment that is locally available and costs less than $100,000 \nequivalent may be procured through direct purchase in accordance with procedures satisfactory \nto ADB. For the pro-poor, community-based tourism component, most of the subprojects will be \nrelatively  small,  and  scattered  throughout  the  provinces.  The  Project  will  consider  funding \nsuitable  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  to  work  in  a  collaborative  and  participatory \nmanner with local communities. PMUs will prepare the bidding documents and evaluate the \ncomponents under their responsibility and will report to the PCU. All procurement processes will \nbe  channeled  through  the  PCUs  for  concurrence  before  submission  to  ADB  for  approval. \nIndicative contract packaging is presented in Appendix 10. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n48.  To support the implementation of the Project, a total of 346 person-months of consulting \nservices (127 person-months of international and 219 person-months of domestic services) will \nbe required for Cambodia, 241 person-months (104 person-months of international and 137 \nperson-months of domestic services) for the Lao PDR, and 169 person-months (63 person-\nmonths  of  international  and  106  person-months  of  domestic  services)  for  Viet  Nam.  The \nconsultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants. \nSeparate consulting services packages will be procured to provide assistance to the PCUs \nestablished  in  the  NTOs,  and  the  PMUs  in  charge  of  infrastructure  improvements.  The \nconsultants for the PMUs will be firms and will focus on part A. The consultants for the PCUs \nwill be firms and will focus on overall project management and part C of the Project. Individual \nconsultants will be used for part B and will be recruited by the PCU. Consulting firms will be \nselected and engaged following the quality and cost-based selection method. Consultants will \nprovide  on-the  job  training  to  national  and  provincial  government  officials  involved  in \nimplementation of the Project. Information on consulting services is presented in Appendix 11. \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n49.  Payment of eligible expenditures from the proceeds of the loan will be made either \nthrough  disbursement  procedures,  direct  procedures,  commitment  procedures,  or \nreimbursement procedures in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook of January \n2001. To ensure the timely release of loan proceeds, and to expedite project implementation, \nthe governments of Cambodia and Lao PDR will, immediately upon loan effectiveness, open \nand maintain a project imprest account in their respective central banks; and the Government of ", "  15\n \nViet Nam will open three imprest accounts, one for each EA in commercial banks acceptable to \nADB. Concurrently, PMUs will each establish second generation imprest accounts, and the \nPIUs in each province will establish project accounts, as required, under supervision by PCU. \nThe  initial  deposit  to  the  imprest  accounts  for  each  country  will  be  based  on  estimated \nexpenditures for the first 6 months of project implementation, but will not exceed the equivalent \nof $1.0 million for Cambodia, and $500,000 for Lao PDR and Viet Nam. ADB\u2019s statement of \nexpenditure (SOE) procedures may be used for reimbursement of eligible expenditures and for \nliquidation of advances in the imprest account. SOE procedures will be applicable to contracts \namounting to $50,000 or less. The consultants will provide training and operating support to the \nPCUs, PMUs, and PIUs accounting staff on the use of the project accounts in the initial stage of \nproject implementation. In Cambodia and Lao PDR, IAs will submit SOEs to their ministries of \nfinance and to the EAs. The EAs will approve each SOE within 12 working days in Cambodia, \nand within 15 calendar days in the Lao PDR. In Viet Nam, the PPCs will send a copy of the \nSOEs to the PCU. Disbursement arrangements will be subject to ADB\u2019s review during its first \nyear of project implementation. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n50.  The  NTOs  will  provide  ADB  with  quarterly  and  annual  progress  reports  on  Project \nimplementation 30 days after the end of the reporting period. The progress reports will be \nprepared by each PIU and PMU and consolidated by the PCU. The reports will particularly \naddress the institutional and policy development aspects of the Project. Separate accounts for \nthe Project will be maintained by the PCU. Detailed annual project accounts, and statements of \nthe imprest account, will be audited and submitted to ADB within 9 months of the close of the \nfinancial year. An auditor, acceptable to ADB, will be appointed to audit the accounts. The NTOs \nwill also submit to ADB, within 3 months of completion of the Project, a project completion report \nthat  will  cover  the  details  of  project  implementation,  costs,  PPMS  activities  and  results, \ncompliance with covenants, and other information that may be requested by ADB. \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n51.  The  EAs  will  ensure  that  a  comprehensive  PPMS  program  acceptable  to  ADB  is \nprepared and implemented to monitor and evaluate the technical performance and social and \neconomic benefits of the Project, especially for the low-income groups. The PPMS indicators \nand  procedures  will  be  tested  for  data  availability  and  other  constraints,  revised  where \nnecessary, and institutionalized as part of the management information systems of the agencies \nconcerned. For the pro-poor, community-based tourism component, the provincial governments \nwill perform the PPMS activities and ensure that the facilities provided or improved under the \nProject are managed efficiently and that the benefits are maximized. The PCUs will maintain the \nPPMS, and analyze and compile data, in coordination with the PMUs and PIUs. \n \n8.  Project Review \n52.  In addition to periodic reviews of the Project, a first year review will be carried out jointly \nby each Government and ADB within 1 year of loan effectiveness. A midterm review will be \nundertaken between each Government and ADB no later than 3 years after loan effectiveness. \nThese  reviews  will  include  a  comprehensive  evaluation  of  the  Project  implementation \narrangements, the progress of implementation compared with targets, feedback from PPMS \nactivities, consultations with community groups, and the performance of the consultants and \nselected NGOs. The cost recovery mechanisms for each subproject will also be evaluated. \nRemedial action will be instituted as needed. ", "16  \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n53.  Economic Benefits. The Project will encourage sustainable tourism development in the \ncountries  of the  lower  Mekong  River  basin.  Net  tourist  spending  in  the  Project  areas  will \nincrease due to increased numbers of tourists, longer stays and increased tourist spending. \nAdditional  net  tourist  spending  due  to  the  Project  during  the  first  10  years  after  project \ncompletion is expected to be $129 million. Sustainable tourism growth will increase foreign \nexchange earnings, support economic growth, and create new employment opportunities. The \neconomic internal rates of return calculated for tourism infrastructure subprojects range from \n13.3% to 33.4%. The economic analysis is presented in Appendix 12; details are available in \nSupplementary Appendix F.  \n \n54.  Financial Benefits. The establishment of appropriate cost recovery mechanisms and \ninstitutional reforms will increase the financial revenues from airports, sewerage systems, river \npiers and small roads to tourist destinations. A significant portion of the financial benefits will \ncome from the tourists visiting the project areas. The reinvestment of benefits to the sector will \nensure that appropriate funding is available for O&M of the infrastructure facilities, and (in some \ncases) sufficient revenue is collected to expand the facilities built under the Project. This will \nensure the sustainability and increased quality of the services, establishing the basis for further \nimprovements of the accessibility and attractiveness of the tourist destinations. The financial \ninternal rates of return of applicable subprojects range from 2.2% to 13.3%, higher than the \nestimated weighted average cost of capital at 1.2% for projects in Cambodia and the Lao PDR \nand  1.1%  for  projects  in  Viet  Nam.  The  financial  analysis  is  presented  in  Supplementary \nAppendix G.  \n \n55.  Environmental  Benefits.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  improved  environmental \nconditions in several urban areas by rehabilitating and expanding the sewerage systems in \nSiem Reap in Cambodia and Sam Mountain in Viet Nam, and expanding landfill capacities, \npreparing solid waste management plans, and providing equipment in Tien Giang Province and \nSam Mountain in Viet Nam. In the rural areas, the Project will facilitate the conservation of the \nnatural environment of the subregion. It will provide opportunities for alternative income to the \nlocal population in isolated areas, thus taking pressure off forests. Additionally, awareness \nprograms  and  training  for  local  communities  on  the  relationship  between  tourism  and \nenvironmental conservation will be undertaken.  \n \n56.  Institutional Benefits. The Project will reinforce the role of AMTA as the only agency in \nthe GMS responsible for coordinating tourism, by appointing a national representative of AMTA \nin each GMSPCs and possible short-term secondments to the AMTA headquarters in Bangkok. \nThese  measures  will  improve  the  capacity  of  AMTA  to  perform  its  role  and  increase  the \nownership of the institution by the GMSPCs. At the national level, the establishment of TMPBs \nwith participation from public and private sectors will facilitate the preparation of more efficient \ntourism marketing and promotion strategies, international cooperation activities involving the \nprivate sector, and the development of common approaches to tourism regulations, standards, \nand investment incentives. In the civil aviation sector, the Project will promote the establishment \nof autonomous airport authorities in Cambodia and Lao PDR, which will be able to collect \nrevenue from airport operations and reinvest it in the airports to ensure sustainability. In the \nurban sector, the establishment of a wastewater agency in Siem Reap and urban environmental \nunits at the provincial level in Viet Nam will provide models for replication countrywide. In Viet \nNam, the establishment of public sector pier authorities responsible for O&M of the piers, as \nseparate entities from the commercial provincial tourism companies, will increase transparency \nand equitable competition in tourist river transport.  ", "  17\n \n57.  Social Impacts. The improvements to tourism-related infrastructure will bring major \nsocial benefits to residents in and around urban areas, local and international tourists, and the \ntourism industry.  Upgraded roads will facilitate the movement of population and goods, as will \nrehabilitated  airports  and  river  facilities  that  encourage  greater  tourist  numbers.  Economic \nactivity in the subregion will increase with increased employment and higher incomes.  The \nprovision of efficient wastewater treatment and sewerage disposal systems will similarly improve \nthe health and general quality of life of resident populations. The burden on women in particular, \non whom much childcare and household activities depend, will be relieved with improved child \nhealth resulting from more efficient sewerage and waste disposal. Better facilities at border \ncrossings will facilitate movement of migrant workers and local tourists, and contribute to the \ndevelopment of the wider regional economy. \n \n58.  Impact on the Poor and Vulnerable. The poor in rural areas will especially benefit from \ncommunity-based  ecotourism  and  village-based  tourism  subprojects  supported  by  a \nconcentrated and focused program spanning two provinces in Cambodia, four in the Lao PDR, \nand two in Viet Nam. Isolated rural areas will be integrated into the mainstream of regional \neconomic  and  social  life  through  ecotourism  and  village-based  tourism  development.  As \nsuccessfully demonstrated in the UNESCO-supported Nam Ha ecotourism project, ecotourism \ncan  reduce  rural  poverty  by  increasing  rural  employment  and  incomes;  encourage  the \nconservation of the natural and cultural heritage; and enable the poor, women, and indigenous \ncommunities to participate in and influence development projects that directly influence their \nown futures. Indigenous minorities and women, in particular, will benefit from training as guides \nand managers, providing food and accommodation for tourists, and the sale of handicrafts.  \nEthnic minorities will also increasingly value their own cultures as tourists and governments \ndemonstrate  an  interest  in  them  and  their  survival.  Increased  exposure  to  tourism  will  be \naccompanied by a corresponding awareness of the need to protect the physical and cultural \nenvironments from undesirable social and economic pressures. \n \n59.  Policy  Dialogue.  Policy  dialogue  has  centered  on  issues  that  will  facilitate  the \nmovement of tourists within the region and will enhance subregional cooperation. Under the \nProject, tourist movement by air will be facilitated and efficiency improvements in air services \nwill be obtained as a  consequence of increased competition once the upgraded domestic \nairports are opened to subregional air traffic. Tourist movement by land will also be facilitated by \nissuing visas on arrival at several border checkpoints near some project areas, and at those \nborder posts where the Project supports investments in small infrastructure and equipment. \nThese interventions are expected to show the benefits of facilitating the movement of tourists, \nand promote continued policy dialogue for further liberalization. The harmonization of hotel \nclassification systems in the subregion will also serve as a pilot case for harmonizing of other \ntourism services that will ensure a common quality of service and standards in the GMS. Other \nresults  of  the  intensive  policy  dialogue  include  (i)  the  integration  of  poverty,  gender, \nenvironmental, resettlement, and indigenous people\u2019s concerns in the preparation of policies, \nand in the identification, development, and management of tourism destinations; and (ii) the \nincreased participation of the private sector in tourism through the establishment of TMPBs, with \nthe private sector having the leading role. \n \n60.   At the national level, policy dialogue has included (i) civil aviation sector reform through \nadvances  in  the  institutional  reform  process  for  the  establishment  of  autonomous  airports \nauthorities in Cambodia and Lao PDR; and (ii) institutional reform and O&M issues concerning \nurban environmental services in Cambodia and Viet Nam that will ensure the institution of \nappropriate cost recovery mechanisms. Additionally, separating the operation of the tourism ", "18  \nriver piers in the Mekong River delta from the tourist companies using them will help improve \ncompetition and transparency and enhance the O&M of tourism river piers in the Mekong Delta. \n \n61.  Risks. The main risks associated with the Project are (i) delays caused by the lack of \nexperience of the EAs in managing an ADB-funded project; (ii) delays caused by the lack of \neffective coordination of the EAs, other line ministries, provincial authorities, and consultants; \n(iii) inadequate counterpart funding; and (iv) the poor, women, and vulnerable rural indigenous \ncommunities being negatively affected by pressures arising from resettlement, contact with alien \ncultures, other negative socioeconomic impacts, or not being able to benefit from increased \ntourism. \n  \n62.  Risk Mitigation. The Project incorporates mitigation measures to address these risks. \nThey include: (i) two individual, international consultants with experience in implementing ADB-\nassisted projects and managing project accounts will be recruited in each GMSPCs at an early \nstage of project implementation to help PCUs, PMUs, and PIUs establish effective project \nmanagement, reporting, and coordinating procedures, and train local staff; (ii) cost recovery \nmechanisms  have  been  included  for  all  infrastructure  projects,  with  the  tourists  using  the \nfacilities contributing a significant portion of the funds needed for O&M; (iii) the ministries of \nfinance of each country has confirmed that ADB-financed projects will have priority in budgetary \nallocation of counterpart funds; (iv) resettlement frameworks for each country and resettlement \nplans for each subproject with significant impact have been prepared and agreed upon; (v) a \npro-poor ethnic minority participation program to protect the most vulnerable minority groups will \nbe  prepared  in  each  province;  (vi)  awareness  campaigns,  directed  at  tourists  and  local \ncommunities, that focus on the dangers of drug abuse and the health risks of indiscriminate and \ncommercial sex activities; and (vii) training for the development of microbusinesses in areas \nsubject  to  tourism  expansion  and  capacity  building for  the  rural  poor  in  community-based \necotourism to ensure that they will benefit from increased tourism. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n63.

", "    Appendix 3  29\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT COMPONENTS \n \nPart A: Tourism-Related Infrastructure Improvements  \n \n1.  Part  A  includes  the  upgrading  of  priority  tourism-related  infrastructure  that  will  facilitate \naccess  or  improve  the  environmental  situation  of  tourist  destinations.  It  includes  the  following \nsubprojects: \n \n1.   Cambodia \n \n2.   Siem Reap Environmental Improvement. The Siem Reap town is growing very fast, and \nattracted about 265,000 international tourists in 2001. Many hotels and private houses discharge \nwastewater into a canal to the west of the town, which is heavily polluted due to lack of maintenance \nand encroachment by dwellings, which partially block the canal in various places. The wastewater \nflows untreated to the Tonle Sap Lake or filters into the ground, polluting the ground water and \ncreating high risks for the health of the local population and tourists, and for the fragile ecosystem of \nTonle Sap Lake. The Project will rehabilitate the urban sewer on the west side of the town, construct \nnew connections to the system, construct stabilizing lagoons to treat discharges from a population of \nabout  17,000  in  the  west  part  of  the  town,  and  prepare  a  community  sanitation  and  health \nawareness program and a small resettlement plan. \n \n3.  Road Access Improvement to the Genocide Memorial. The memorial to the genocide \nerected at Cheong Ek, about 9 kilometers (km) from Phnom Penh, attracted about 25,000 tourists in \n2001. However, the access road to the site is in very poor condition and constraints visits the site, \nparticularly in the rainy season when the road becomes almost impassable. The Project will elevate \nthe 6.3 km access road, surface it with asphalt concrete, rebuild two bridges, and improve the \ndrainage system for the road. \n \n4.  Rattanak Kiri Airport Improvement. Rattanak Kiri is a very attractive province isolated due \nto the poor condition of the road. The province depends on air travel for economic development, \ntourism, and health purposes. About 12,800 passengers used the airport in 2001. However, the \nairport is in poor condition and the runway is too short to permit ATR 72 or similar sized aircraft to \noperate safely with economic loads. The Project will include the resurfacing and extension of the \nrunway, a new taxiway and apron, runway grading and a drainage system, a new passenger \nterminal, an airport fence, a control tower, an operations building, car park and access, navigation, \nsecurity and communication equipment, and land acquisition and resettlement. \n \n5.  Stung Treng Airport Improvement. Stung Treng is on the Mekong River, strategically \nsituated just a few kilometers from the border with the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao \nPDR). The province has many nature-based tourist attractions; however, access from Phnom Penh \nby road is extremely difficult and river access is slow and impossible during the dry season. The \nairport is in poor condition and the runway is too short to permit ATR 72 or similar sized aircraft to \noperate safely. The project will include the resurfacing and extension of the runway, a new taxiway \nand apron, runway grading and drainage system, a new passenger terminal, an airport fence, a \ncontrol tower, an operations building, car park and access, navigation equipment, and security and \ncommunication equipment. \n \n2.  Lao PDR \n \n6.  Louang Namtha Airport Improvement. Lao Aviation operates round trips from Vientiane to \nLouang Namtha four times weekly and twice weekly service from Louang Phrabang and Houeixai. \nHowever, the poor condition of the airport makes these services very dangerous and unreliable \n   ", "30 Appendix 3 \ndepending on weather conditions. The present airport has a runway of 1.2 km which allows landing \nonly for small aircraft. The extension of the runway to 1.5 km is required to allow the landing of larger \nand more reliable aircraft commonly used in the region. The present runway is in poor condition, full \nof patches, encroached on by vegetation, and full of water in the rainy season due to lack of a \ndrainage system. The terminal and control tower are rudimentary, as are the passenger facilities and \nthere is no emergency and fire service equipment. The improvement of the airport is necessary to \nattract more tourists and develop the potential of the area. The project includes the repairing and \nextending  of the runway,  constructing  a  drainage  system  and  a passenger  terminal,  providing \nemergency, fire service, and air navigation equipment. \n \n7.  Improvement of the Access Road to Konglor Cave. The project site is 46 km from road \n8a, connecting Lao PDR and Viet Nam, in Khammouan Province. The main attractions of the area \nare limestone formations and natural caves, including an 11.2 km underground river. The area is not \naccessible by air, and tourists travel by road or across from Thailand and Viet Nam. The site can \nalso be reached by a 4 hour road journey from Vientiane. The project includes upgrading of the 36 \nkm road connecting to road 8a. The road is in a very poor condition and becomes impassable during \nrainy season. The project will include the extension of a small water supply system. \n \n8.  Improvement of the Access Road to the Kwangsi Water Fall. The spectacular Kwangsi \nwater fall is 29 km south of the World Heritage site of Louang Phrabang, and received about 38,200 \nforeign visitors in 2001 (from a total of 68,250 foreign tourists visiting the province). The road from \nLouang Phrabang to the falls is dusty and bumpy and used by open vehicles or rented motorbikes. \nThe situation of the present road causes high vehicle operation costs for local transport companies, \nentails high road maintenance costs, is a highly unpleasant experience for tourists, and is accident-\nprone due to the dust. The proposed project includes upgrading of 22 km of access road with \nasphalt concrete, and extending small water supply and infrastructure facilities, such as toilets by the \nsite and trekking trails around the site. \n \n3.  Viet Nam \n \n9.  Sam Mountain Environmental Improvement in An Giang Province. Sam Mountain is one \nof  the  most  important  tourist  centers  of the  Mekong  Delta,  and  attracted  more  than  2  million \nVietnamese visitors in 2001, who came as pilgrims to visit the famous Buddhist temples around the \nmountain. Considered by the Government as one of the five international tourist attractions1 of the \ndelta, Sam Mountain is also visited by 16,000 international tourists annually and has great potential \nto attract many more international visitors. However, due to unplanned tourism development and \nlack of investment in environmental urban services, the mountain and the villages where the tourists \nstay are in a critical environmental situation, increasing the health risks for tourists and the local \npopulation and reducing the attractiveness of the site. The subproject will include a wastewater \nmanagement system and treatment lagoons, a solid waste management plan for the area, landfill, \nsmall drainage improvements, and land acquisition and resettlement. \n \n10.  An Giang Tourist River Piers Development. An Giang Province is the gateway of the \nMekong River for all tourists visiting the Mekong Delta from Cambodia and Lao PDR by river. More \nthan 12,000 international tourists cross the border by river from Cambodia every year and the \nnumber is increasing rapidly. Furthermore, tourists coming from Ho Chi Minh City and other places \nin  the  delta  could  visit  the  province  by  river.  However,  neither  appropriate  river  piers  are not \navailable to accommodate the increasing number of visitors. Thus, the project will include the \nconstruction of a floating pier and tourist visa clearing and restroom facilities in Vinh Xuong, and the \nconstruction of a pier in Chau Doc with waiting lounge and toilet. \n                                                 \n1  Viet Nam National Administration of Tourism. 1998. Tourism Development Planning in Mekong River Delta. \n   ", "    Appendix 3  31\n11.  My Tho Tourist River Pier Development in Tien Giang Province. More than 378,000 \ntourists, including 191,000 foreigners used the river pier facilities in My Tho in 2001. Most tourists \nuse this pier to visit the attractive Thoi Son Island and other islands in the province, while some use \nthe  pier  to  start  a  river  trip  in  the  Mekong  Delta.  The  existing  small  wooden  quay  cannot \naccommodate the demand, which has been increasing by 20% annually in the last 5 years. The lack \nof space causes delays and increases security risks, and the tourist facilities in the pier are very \npoor. The project will include the construction of a new pier complex that can accommodate 150 \npassengers, fencing of the site, parking area, toilets, and tourist facilities. \n \n12.  Tien Giang Environmental Improvement. The combination of lack of investment and a \nrapid increase in the amount of solid waste generated by more than 300 hotels and guesthouses in \nMy Tho City and 378,000 visitors to the four tourist islands in the province has increased the \ndifficulties of the provincial authorities in collecting, transporting, and depositing the waste in an \nefficient  manner  that  respects  the  environment.  The  current  landfill  used  by  the  provincial \ngovernment will reach its capacity in less than 2 years. Action is urgently required to avoid further \ndeterioration of the environment. The project will include a solid waste management plan for the \nislands visited by the tourists and My Tho City, equipment for the collection and transportation of \ngarbage from the islands and My Tho City to the landfill site, and improvement and expansion of the \ncapacity of the current landfill, 20 km from the town. It will also include the development of an \necological  toilet  system  and  a  program  to  improve  management  capacity  and  community \nparticipation in environmental protection. \n \nPart B:  Pro-Poor, Community-Based Tourism Development    \n \n13.  Part B will assist local communities with distinctive rural lifestyles or living in areas with \npristine ecosystems to manage and determine their limits to tourism growth, increase control in the \nselection of tourist types and modalities, and equitably distribute tourism benefits. It will develop pilot \necotourism and village-based tourism projects, foster the conservation and improvement of the \ncultural, and environmental heritage of the selected areas, monitor social impacts, promote the role \nof women, and establish measures to minimize negative impacts due to increased tourism. Part B \nwill include the provinces of Rattanak Kiri and Stung Treng in Cambodia; Louang Namtha, Louang \nPhrabang, Khammouan, Champassak in Lao PDR; and An Giang and Tien Giang in Viet Nam. It will \ninclude the following components: \n \n14.  Institutional Strengthening and Community Participation Program. The component will \ninclude  support for the  establishment  of  national,  provincial,  and  village  organizations  that will \npromote pro-poor community based ecotourism and village-based activities. It will also include \nsupport for the preparation of detailed participation plans in each province and the implementation of \nthe plan. It could include the organization of workshops, surveys, discussion groups, etc. \n \n15.  Awareness Program on Tourism Benefits and Negative Impacts, and Environmental \nand Cultural Conservation. The component will develop and implement an awareness program for \nselected communities to show the economic and social benefits derived from environmental and \ncultural  conservation  though  increased  tourism.  The  program  will  also  provide  awareness \ncampaigns  and  develop  measures  to  mitigate  the  potential  negative  impacts  of  tourism \nmismanagement and uncontrolled tourism, such as illegal traffic of women and children, HIV/AIDS,2 \nchildren  prostitution,  drug  trafficking,  etc.  It  will  advertise  successful  experience  in  the  region, \neducate  tourists,  and  include  the  preparation  of  a  manual  on  ecotourism  and  environmental \nconservation and other materials. \n \n                                                 \n2  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome \n   ", "32 Appendix 3 \n16.  Pro-Poor Tourism Products Identification and Development. The component will initially \nidentify  possibilities  for  community-based  tourism  in  each  province,  based  on  community \ncommitment, attractiveness of the destination and potential for development, demand analysis, \naccessibility, absorptive capacity of the site, and sustainability. Where appropriate, tourism products \nwill be developed, as for example, the sustainable development of treks/excursions by land or river, \nbased on the appeal of ethnic minorities and their ways of life; other aspects of social, cultural, or \neconomic life; or the natural environment. \n \n17.  Small-Scale Tourism-Related Infrastructure. The component will support the development \nof small-scale infrastructure for the new identified local tourists sites, for example, village lodges and \nother forms of local accommodation, through a combination of grants and loans from revolving credit \nschemes, designed to be sustainably operated by local people. It could include support for the \ndevelopment of provincial or district visitor and information centers for community-based projects, if \nthis is appropriate, the objectives of the center have been clearly defined, the location has been \ncarefully analyzed comparing different options, and the local authorities or the communities have \nallocated personnel to serve the tourism center. \n \n18.  Capacity Building for Tourism-Related Local Microenterprises and Communities. The \ncomponent  will  provide  support  to  local  communities  and  small  tourism-related  enterprises  to \nenhance their capabilities to interact and communicate with international tourists. Training will be \nprovided at provincial and local levels in guiding techniques, language skills, environmental and \ninterpretative techniques, financial management, and planning for ecotourism development. \n \n19.  Gender  Development  Program.    The  Project  will  support  rural  poor  women\u2019s  full \nparticipation in economic activities associated with development of pro-poor ecotourism. Training of \nwomen in developing and running micro enterprises, identification of markets and provision  of \nbackward  and  forward  linkages,  participation  in  guiding  tourists,  community-based  housing  for \ntourists, and handicraft production are expected to create alternative opportunities for poor women \nand  reduce  risks  of  sexual  exploitation.  Women  will  be  fully  involved  in  decision-making  for \necotourism development at all levels, through their organization, training, and awareness in all \naspects  of  tourism  development.  At  least  40%  of  members  of  all  ecotourism  stakeholder \nassociations to be set up under the Project are to be women. Regular monitoring and impact \nassessment will be done with the full participation of women, using gender sensitive variables to \nassess poverty reduction, improvement in access to social services, reduction of risks associated \nwith increased movements of people in fragile and poor areas, and improvements in women\u2019s \nstatus. \n \n20.  Ethnic Minorities Participation Program. The component will focus on the support for \npreparing ethnic minorities\u2019 participation programs in each province included in the Project where \nethnic minorities exist, and the implementation of the program to ensure that these groups are not \nnegatively affected by tourism development, and can enjoy a significant part of tourism benefits to \nthe project areas. \n \n21.  Marketing and Promotion Plan. The component will include training in basic techniques in \nmarketing and ecotourism promotion, and the identification of specific markets for the ecotourism \nventures  developed  under  the  Project.  It  will  also  support  development  websites,  promotional \nmaterials, and advertising campaigns in selected national or international markets. \n \n22.  Promotion  of  Community-Based  Tourism  Networks  and  Ecotourism  Stakeholder \nAssociations. The component will involve creating a series of developing and sustainable networks, \nthrough seminars and workshops, at Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), national, and provincial \nlevels. The networks will enable the productive and regular transmission of information, especially \n   ", "    Appendix 3  33\nshared information concerning best practices, and the regular extension of these across national \nboundaries within the GMS, most notably Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam. In particular, the \nestablishment at subregional, national, and provincial levels of the networks will encourage the \nformation of individual associations from the sectors of the tourism industry and enable them to meet \nregularly with representatives of communities, local governments, and government departments \n(e.g., agriculture and forestry, fisheries, women\u2019s and ethnic minorities affairs), women\u2019s groups, \nnongovernment organizations, ethnic minority associations, and other parties with economic and \npractical  interests  in  the  development  of  pro-poor,  community-orientated  sustainable  tourism \npractices. \n \n23.  Project Performance Monitoring System Project Outputs and Impacts. This component \nwill include the development of regular monitoring mechanisms to ensure that the basic aims and \nobjectives of the overall program are being met and benefits of tourism are widely distributed, \nparticularly to the poor. It will also closely monitor that expertise being provided by international \ntechnical advisers is being satisfactorily disseminated to nationals from Cambodia, Lao PDR, and \nViet Nam. \n \nPart C: Subregional Cooperation    \n \n24.  Part  C  will  provide  measures  to  facilitate  and  promote  cooperation  among  the  GMS \nparticipating countries (GMSPCs), and with other GMS countries not included in the Project for the \ndevelopment of the subregional tourism sector. A total of $350,000 will be allocated for each \nGMSPCs to use under the identified components for various cooperative and facilitation measures. \nPart C will include the following components. \n   \n25.  GMS  Facility  for  Tourism  Cooperation (GMS-FTC).  All  national  tourism  organizations \n(NTOs) have signed bilateral agreements for tourism cooperation. However, in many cases, the \nbilateral agreements or agreements between provincial authorities from two different countries have \nnot been implemented due to lack of funding. Through the GMS facility for tourism cooperation \n(FTC), the Project will make available $80,000 from the loan for each GMSPCs. To access the FTC, \nnational tourism organizations (NTOs) should identify projects that will encourage regional tourism \ndevelopment. The GMSFTC will only be used for projects involving at least two GMSPCs or one \nGMSPC and another GMS country not included in the Project. In the latter case, the nonparticipating \ncountry will fund its contribution from its own resources. The NTOs or other public bodies can \nrequest funding for an eligible project and this will be appraised by the project coordination unit \n(PCUs), and sent to the national steering committee for approval, and to the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) for concurrence after approval by the national steering committee. The cooperating \nmembers will be required to sign a cooperation agreement before ADB will authorize the use of \nthese funds. \n \n26.  The facility could fund (i) studies to prepare circuits and assess demand, (ii) small-scale \ninfrastructure to improve the circuits, (iii) a marketing program for the circuits, (iv) a monitoring \nsystem  of  economic  benefits  for  each  country,  and  (v)  meetings  and  seminars  to  promote \ncooperation activities for the private sector on both sides of the border. Cross-border projects to be \nsupported could include the promotion and development of an activity, facility, or amenity, that \ninvolves two or more countries, and ideally where the benefits would be jointly shared. Examples \ncould include observation of river dolphins, minority cultural displays, trails across the borders, \ninformation  panels,  studies,  marketing,  brochure  production,  advertising,  trail \nimprovements/signposting, conservation measures, and the organizing costs of events. The facility \ncould  be  particularly  appropriate  in  the  development  triangle  of  northeastern  Cambodia, \nsoutheastern Lao PDR, and Viet Nam. \n \n   ", "34 Appendix 3 \n27.  Improvement of Tourism-Related Facilities at Border Posts. The Project will address \nconstraints to movement of tourists across the GMS. The Project will provide support to NTOs that \npropose  or  endorse  measures  suggested  by  other  public  agencies,  such  as  immigration \ndepartments,  to  fund  (i)  computer  equipment  for  visa  sections  in  the  border  checkpoints; \n(ii) provision of immigration and customs facilities to permit regional flights to land at local airports; \n(iii)  improved  facilities  in  immigration  offices  and  visa  extension  offices;  (iv) structures for  new \ncrossing  points;  (v)  training  to  immigration  personnel;  (vi)  small-scale  infrastructure  in  border \ncheckpoints, establishing monitoring and financial management systems for the processing of visas \non arrival; and (vii) processing areas for vehicle movements. \n \n28.  Establishment of a GMS Network of Tourism Marketing and Promotion Boards. The \nrole of government in tourism should be limited to setting objectives and policies for the sector; \nmonitoring performance, control and regulation; and creating a favorable environment for business. \nIt may also be involved in sharing responsibilities for training, collection of statistics and basic \ninformation, and development. NTOs should not have the leading role in marketing, standards \ndevelopment, research, and service of tourists.  These are best undertaken by the private sector or \nby a tourism marking and promotion board (TMPB) in which the private sector has a leading role. \nThe involvement of the private sector in tourism marketing and promotion is necessary because it \nknows the market, knows how to market, and knows what the visitor demands and how to provide it. \nIt has more flexibility and ability to respond to changing situations than the public sector. At present, \nthe private sector is not involved in tourism marketing and promotion at the national level in any of \nthe GMSPCs. These countries recognize the need to further involve the private sector in tourism \npromotion and favor the establishment of TMPBs. \n \n29.  The component will provide the NTOs with resources to establish TMPBs and support them \nduring the first year of operations. The responsibilities of the TMPBs will essentially be international \npromotion, servicing of tourism, and standards development. They will normally act independently \nbut will cooperate for their mutual benefit under the umbrella of the Agency for Coordinating Mekong \nTourism Activities (AMTA). Resources can be devoted to (i) incorporation and legal matters; (ii) \ndevelopment  of  a  corporate  image;  (iii)  start-up  costs;  (iv)  recruitment,  training,  management \nsystems;  (v)  computer  hardware  and  software,  equipment,  and  furniture  for  the  TMPB  and \ninformation offices; (vi) design and production of initial print and other promotional material; and \n(vii) cooperation activities between GMS TMPBs. \n   \n30.  GMS Hotel Classification System. Customers want to be able to make \"value for money\" \nassessments on where to stay based on an impartial and independent assessments, and the tour \noperators need a hotel classification system to promote their product.  The GMSPC recognizes the \nnecessity for a system.  An ADB- funded technical assistance (TA) drafted recommendations for a \ngrading system in Cambodia in 2001 and Viet Nam is in the process of designing a scheme. All \nthree countries have agreed to cooperate on a common system. The Project will provide support for \n(i)  the  establishment  of  common  criteria  and  systems  together  with  other  GMS  countries,  (ii) \nadministration and inspectorate costs in the course of the first year, (iii) design of a common logo, \n(iv) production of promotional material, and (v) computer and other equipment. \n \n31.  GMS Tourism Plan. Considerable work has been done at a national level in the three \ncountries to develop tourism plans. At the subregional level, much of the background information \nand research gathered for the ADB-funded Mekong-Lancang River Planning Study in 1998 is still \nvalid. In addition, several provincial and sectoral studies have been recently published. However, a \ntourism plan for the GMS to (i) give direction and encourage tourism investment and development in \nthe subregion; (ii) synchronize development and investment; and (iii) dovetail national planning is \nneeded. The Project will support the preparation of a GMS tourism plan focused on updating the \n1998 study and integrating the separate national plans into a coherent document. The plan will list \n   ", "    Appendix 3  35\ninvestment needs and opportunities, constraints to growth, and proposals for further integration and \npromotion of the subregion. It will also address aspects of tourism, which particularly benefit the poor \nand help preserve the natural environment and cultural heritage of the GMS. \n \n32.  GMS Tourism Statistics Improvement and Harmonization. Lack of statistics and research \nmaterial in all three countries makes tourism planning and project evaluation difficult. The problem of \nlimited data is compounded by nonuniformity among countries with respect to definitions, collection, \nanalysis,  and  presentation  of  statistics.  This  is  a  serious  constraint  and  creates  problems  for \npotential investors and planners. Lack of data makes it difficult to measure tourism performance and \nin turn the value of tourism. Making a meaningful case in favor of tourism initiatives (such as \nlobbying for easing restrictions of travel) is virtually impossible. The Project will support (i) organizing \nGMS  meetings  on  harmonization  of  tourism  statistics;  (ii) provision  of  computer  software  and \nhardware, and equipment to improve the collection of tourism statistics; and (iii) training of technical \nstaff in the statistics divisions of the NTOs and the central statistics offices of each country in the \nWorld Tourism Authority\u2019s Satellite National Accounts System. \n \n33.  Diversification of AMTA Human Resources. All employees in AMTA are of Thai origin, and \ntheir salaries are paid by the Tourism Authority of Thailand. Other GMS countries have not provided \nnational personnel to AMTA due to lack of funds, and because AMTA offices are also in Thailand. \nThis situation has created a lack of ownership of AMTA from other GMS countries and has on many \noccasions created the impression that AMTA was not defending the national interests of all GMS \ncountries. A broader representation from other nationalities is required among AMTA employees in \norder to increase ownership and ensure that views from other GMS countries are appropriately \nrepresented. The Project will provide assistance for the appointment of one national officer in AMTA, \nwho will be based in the GMSPCs, with short periods of time at AMTA headquarters in Bangkok, if \ndesired. \n \n34.  GMS Tourism Human Resource Development. The quality of personal service in tourism \nin each of the countries needs to be improved. To address the problem, the Project will support \n(i) the preparation of a training needs survey for the GMSPCs to determine the scale and nature of \npriority training required; and (ii) specific training activities involving at least two countries for certain \nkey people in dealing with the tourist, such as immigration and customs officials, river pilots, and \nguides. \n \nPart D:  Implementation Assistance and Institutional Strengthening  \n \n35.  This component provides (i) consulting services for project management support, tourism \ndevelopment,  and  subregional  cooperation;  (ii)  detailed  design  and  construction  supervision  of \ntourism-related  infrastructure  and  pro-poor,  community-based  tourism  development;  and \n(iii) incremental administrative cost and project administration equipment. \n \n   ", "36 Appendix 4 \n                                          SUMMARY SOCIAL AND POVERTY ANALYSIS \n                                                     \n1.  The Project will include subprojects for pro-poor community-based tourism development, \ntourism-related  infrastructure  improvements,  and  subregional  cooperation  for  sustainable \ndevelopment in Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), and Viet Nam. All three \ncountries suffer from high levels of poverty, poor infrastructure, and lack of access to social services \nand infrastructure, particularly in rural areas, where poverty levels tend to be higher than in urban \nareas. Food insecurity levels are high among ethnic minority communities in selected subproject \nareas  in  Cambodia  and  Lao  PDR.  A  detailed  social  and  poverty  analysis  of  the  countries  is \npresented in Supplementary Appendix B. The summary initial poverty and social analysis report \nform is shown in Table A4.1. \n \nA.   Social Analysis \n \n2.  The project impacts are expected to include poverty reduction among participating ethnic \nminority communities and poor rural communities likely to be involved in community-based tourism \ndevelopment activities in partnership with nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and government \nagencies. A stakeholder participation strategy is included in the pro-poor community-based tourism \ncomponent of the Project. A pro-poor ethnic minority participation strategy is also included, which \nwill apply to all project components that are related to ethnic minorities. The strategy will include \ncapacity building, organization, and training for activities related to increased tourism for the affected \ncommunities. The active participation of the communities will help to mitigate the potential negative \nimpacts of increased contacts with outsiders and increase their capacities to benefit from tourism.  \nImpacts  upon  them  will  be  monitored  through  participatory  approaches.  Gender  disadvantage \namong ethnic minority women and girls, and risks associated with increased inflows of outsiders into \nsuch  communities,  particularly  for  women  and  young  people,  will  be  effectively  dealt  with  by \nstakeholder participation, organization and mobilization efforts by NGOs, and consultants working in \npartnership with rural community-based organizations, government, and private sector entities. A \ngender and development (GAD) strategy is included in this context. Some resettlement impacts are \nexpected  to  result  from  infrastructure  development,  including  the  upgrading  of  two  airports, \nimprovement of wastewater and sewage treatment and road improvements in Cambodia and Lao \nPDR, and development of river piers in Viet Nam. Resettlement plans have been prepared to \naddress  the  impacts,  in  keeping  with  the  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). Resettlement plans have been prepared to ensure the affected people \nwill be able to at least restore, but preferably improve, their preproject situations. Special attention \nhas been given to ensuring socially and culturally appropriate mitigation and rehabilitation measures. \n \n3.  The Project will promote pro-poor community-based ecotourism in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and \nViet Nam. The Project has identified other key institutional partners along with the governments of \nthe three countries. These include the Netherlands Cooperation Agency, the Nam Ha Ecotourism \nProject in Louang Namtha in the Lao PDR supported by United Nations Education, Scientific and \nCultural Organization (UNESCO), and the NGO Developing Remote Indigenous Village Education \n(DRIVE) in Cambodia. The Project also tries to build upon experience of local comanagement of \nnatural resources, such as in the Khong District in Champassak Province of the Lao PDR, in order to \ndemonstrate approaches to participatory ecotourism. The objectives of the participatory pro-poor \necotourism activities are to  (i) enable the rural poor to benefit from tourism while sustainably \nmanaging, using, and conserving their natural, cultural, and social heritage; (ii) increase income \nearning opportunities through sustainable tourism-related enterprises and employment opportunities; \n(iii) strengthen the participation of the poor, particularly ethnic minorities, women, and young people, \nin organizations for decision making and improved interactions, at a wider level, with official and \nprivate sector entities for planning and implementing activities, as well as for impact assessment; (iv) \nincrease awareness among the poor communities, women, and young people, regarding the risks of ", "Appendix 4  37\ntourism development, and develop their capacity to prevent or reduce risks to vulnerable sections of \npoor communities; and (v) expand regional and international cooperation in ecotourism development \nwithin the Greater Mekong Subregion by creating at regional, national, and local levels, sustainable \nnetworks  to  promote  awareness  of  such  issues  and  enabling  the  development  of  common \napproaches to tackling such problems.  \n \n4.  The Project will include support to village, provincial, and national institutions for activities \nrelated to the objectives stated in paragraph 3. Training will be provided at provincial and local levels \nfor ecotourism-related skills such as tour guiding, interpretion and language, financial management, \nand establishment and management of micro enterprises. In appropriate areas, ecotourism activities \nwill be established in partnership with local community organizations, NGOs, and civil society. The \nProject  will  support  the  training  and  promotion  of  economic  activities  based  on  ecotourism, \nparticularly among ethnic minority and other poor women, in order to reduce the risks of exploitation \nof women and girls for economic gains from the sex trade. Local infrastructure such as provincial \nvisitor information and guidance centers will provide information to incoming visitors regarding risks \nassociated with the sex trade, HIV/AIDS,1 and illegal drug use. Visitor lodgings in villages will be \ncreated through grants and credit, to be operated by trained local people. The Project will set up \nnetworks of information exchange through a series of seminars and workshops at subregional, \nnational, and local levels to promote the best practices related to safe tourism development. The \nestablishment of ecotourism stakeholder associations from the community level up will promote \nregular interaction between women\u2019s groups, government institutions, and other private interests, in \norder to strengthen pro-poor community-oriented tourism development. Training will also be oriented \nto marketing techniques and promotion of ecotourism. Markets for different ecotourism ventures will \nbe identified as part of this overall strategy. Regular monitoring mechanisms will be included as part \nof the Project in order to assess the poverty reduction impacts of project-supported activities by \ncommunities themselves, as well as the extent of impacts on reduction of gender- and health-related \nrisks associated with increased tourism.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis and Impact \n \n5.  Poverty levels in the participating countries and in the sub project areas are high. Lao PDR \nhas a national poverty level of 38.6%. Most of the subproject areas have poverty levels that are \nhigher than the national average. The province of Louang Namtha has a poverty level of 57.5% with \n70,900 poor out of a total population of 123,200. Louang Phrabang has a poverty level of 49.4% with \n195,600 poor out of a total population of 396,600. Khammouan has a poverty level of 41.6% with \n137,700 poor out of a total population of 331,000. Champassak Province has a poverty level of \n35.6% with 601,000 poor out of a total population of 196,800. In the project areas in the Lao PDR, \nthe average poverty level is 42.8%, significantly higher than the national average. Cambodia has a \nnational  poverty  level  of  36.0%.  Many  of  the  subproject  areas  have  high  levels  of  poverty, \nparticularly in the upland province of Rattanak Kiri, with a poverty level of 52.7%, and in Stung \nTreng, with a poverty level of 35.5%. In Siem Riep town the poverty level is 33.1% and the city of \nPhnom Penh has the lowest poverty level at 10.8%. For the Project area as a whole, the poverty \naverage amounts to 38.5%, higher than Cambodia\u2019s national average. In Viet Nam, the national \npoverty level is 36.5%, with An Giang Province having a poverty level of 40.6% and Tien Giang \nProvince at 27.6%. For the Project in Viet Nam, the average poverty level is 34.8%, just a little lower \nthan the national average. The three-country poverty level averages at 39.8%, making the Project \neligible for classification as a poverty intervention project. \n \n6.  The Project\u2019s pro-poor tourism development activities are expected to improve incomes of \npoor beneficiaries by 25% or more. These estimates are based on studies of the economic impacts \n                                                \n1  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ", "38 Appendix 4 \nof the Nam Ha Ecotourism Project in the Lao PDR, supported by UNESCO. The project is a model \nthat the Project will replicate. Studies carried out in October 2001 demonstrate that, at the village \nlevel, the total income from ecotourism amounted to approximately 42% of all incomes. Activities \nderived from such incomes include sale of nontimber forest produce, food, and handicrafts, and \nprovision  of  services  to  tourists  including  guiding  and  traditional  massage.  As  a  result  of  the \nincreases in individual household incomes and in village funds, participating communities reported \nimproved food security. Village funds will be used to develop village infrastructure such as tracks \nand  improved  schools.  Individual  households  benefited  by  improving  their  food  consumption; \nimproving access to clothes, blankets, and medicines; greater investment in agricultural equipment \nand tools; and increased household savings. During meetings with ethnic minority communities in \nthe  subproject  areas,  the  community  representatives  strongly  supported  the  proposals  for \ncommunity-based tourism development. They stated that in their areas, tourism potential was high \nbut they could not exploit it due to poor infrastructure, and their own lack of training and awareness. \nThey would like improved access to training in order to be able to diversify their occupations. \nWomen from ethnic minority households wanted to learn how to make new handicrafts that would \nappeal to tourists. Young people wanted training in guiding skills, and the English language. Thus, \nthe intended beneficiaries expect tourism development to be based on the full participation of local \ncommunities, and to involve them fully in all activities, so as to bring them the maximum economic \nbenefits. They expect that this involvement can reduce poverty and food insecurity, and contribute to \nimproving their quality of life. \n \nC.  Ethnic Minorities Analysis and Participation Program \n \n7.  The subproject areas in Cambodia and Lao PDR have significant ethnic minority populations. \nThe Lao PDR is a multiethnic country. The definitions used by the Government to classify the \npopulation groups are Lao Loum (lowland Lao), Lao Theung (upland Lao) and Lao Soung (highland \nLao).  As per this classification, the lowland Lao or Lao Loum, account for 52.5% of the population.  \nHowever,  this  definition  fails  to  capture  the  diversity  of  cultures,  languages,  social  practices, \ncustoms, and economic structures of the large variety of groups. The 1995 census categorized the \npopulation into 47 ethnicities and 4 major ethno-linguistic groups: (i) Tai Kadai, comprising the Lao \nPhutai (66.2%); (ii) Austro-Asiatic, comprising the Mon Khmer and Viet Muong (0.1%); (iii) Hmong \nYao (7.4 %); and (iv) Sino Tibetan, comprising Tibeto Burman and Hor.  In Louang Namtha the Tai \nKadai comprise 32.1%, the Austro- Asiatic 46.0%, and the Hmong Yao 15.7% of the population.  \n \n8.  Article  8  of  the  Lao  Constitution  adopted  in  1991  guarantees  that  the  state  will  not \ndiscriminate against people on the basis of ethnicity. The Constitution specifically mentions ethnic \nminorities and states that: (i) the Lao PDR is a unified nation with indivisible ethnic groups; (ii) all \npower is of the people, by the people, and for the use of the multiethnic population; (iii)  the right to \nbe owners of the nation is exercised by multiethnic peoples and is guaranteed by the political \nsystem; (iv) the mass organizations are the gathering point for solidarity and mobilization for citizens \nof all backgrounds and all ethnicities; (v) the state will provide a policy of unity and equality between \nethnic groups; (vi) all ethnic groups have the right to maintain their traditions and improve their \nculture and that of the nation, and the state will use all means to improve the economic and social \nlevels of all groups; (viii) the economic system is for improving the living standard and spirituality of \nthe multiethnic peoples; and (ix) all Lao citizens, regardless of their sex, social position, education, \nbeliefs, or ethnicity are equal before the law. \n \n9.  In 1992, a policy concerning ethnic minority affairs was adopted. It is the cornerstone of \ncurrent Lao PDR policy towards ethnic minorities. The agency that manages affairs related to ethnic \nminorities is the Lao Front for National Construction which is represented at the provincial and \ndistrict levels. The Lao Front for National Construction is responsible for (i) promoting the human \ndevelopment  of  ethnic  minority  officials;  (ii) ensuring  that  educational  opportunities  are  made ", "Appendix 4  39\navailable to ethnic minorities; (iii) promoting and preserving their cultural traditions; (iv) improving \nand expanding healthcare, knowledge of reproductive heath, traditional medicine, and detoxification \nof opium addicted persons; and (v) enhancing the administrative mechanism for ethnic minorities \nincluding their promotion in rural development activities by ensuring that other agencies are aware of \nthe requirements for the participation of ethnic minorities. \n \n10.  The Lao PDR\u2019s 5 year plan from 2001-2005 has several objectives that are of central \nrelevance to ethnic minorities in the project area and are related to poverty reduction, including \nsupport  for  (i) food  security,  (ii)  commercial  agricultural  production,  (iii)  rural  development, \n(iv) infrastructure development, (v) external economic relations, and (vi) access to services. In 2000 \nthe Government prepared a decentralization plan that calls for establishing the province as the \nstrategic unit, the district as the planning unit, and the village as the implementation unit. In addition, \nvillages are responsible for data collection on the living conditions of families. The villages are \nsupposed to establish regular project performance monitoring systems for project implementation. \n \n11.  The ethnic minorities have gained substantial benefits through their ecotourism activities \nunder the UNESCO project in Louang Namtha which has brought them substantial benefits. Recent \nsurveys demonstrate that 25\u201370% of household incomes of participating communities were sourced \nfrom ecotourism-related activities. For some households, the contribution was even higher.  These \nactivities need to be extended to other districts in the province. The province needs strengthened \ncommunity  capacity  to  participate  effectively  at  local,  district,  and  provincial  levels  in  decision \nmaking, and increased economic activities and benefits from pro-poor tourism development. Future \nactivities need to concentrate on community capacity building through organization and mobilization \nof community groups, training programs and workshops, gender outreach workshops, teaching of \nEnglish language and guiding skills to more ethnic minority people (including women and girls), and \nimproved production and marketing of handicrafts. Awareness related to the negative impacts of \ntourism and  community capacity to prevent such impacts need to be strengthened. \n \n12.  The Project will aim at the full participation of ethnic minority communities in project planning, \nimplementation,  and  benefits.  Ethnic  minority  participation  will  be  strengthened  through  the \nestablishment of village committees consisting of the village chief, deputy chief, elders, and at least \nthree women representatives. These village committees will liaise with the district and provincial \ntourism development authorities with regard to the planning of activities, training programs, revenue \nsharing,  and  use  of  village  incomes  from  pro-poor  tourism,  for  sustainable  poverty  reduction. \nRepresentatives  of  ethnic  minority  communities  will  participate  in  district-level  committees  in \nassociation with district agencies involved in pro-poor tourism development. Such committees will \ncoordinate and decide matters related to planning of activities, skills development of ethnic minority \ngroups (including women) for pro-poor tourism development, and sharing of revenues between \nvillage communities and district offices of tourism development. Ethnic minority representatives will \nbe elected to provincial level associations that will interact with each other and provide inputs to \npolicy planning and development of pro-poor tourism in the region. \n \nD.  Gender Analysis and Development Program \n \n13.  The Project will support rural poor women\u2019s full participation in economic activities associated \nwith development of pro-poor ecotourism. Training of women in development and running of micro \nenterprises, identification of markets and provision of backward and forward linkages, women\u2019s \nparticipation in guiding tourists, community-based housing for tourists, and handicraft production are \nexpected to create alternative opportunities for poor women, and reduce risks of sexual exploitation. \nWomen will be fully involved in decision-making for ecotourism development at all levels, through \ntheir organization, training, and awareness in all aspects of tourism development. The participation \nof the Ministry of Women and Veteran\u2019s Affairs in Cambodia, the Lao PDR women\u2019s union and the ", "40 Appendix 4 \nViet Nam women\u2019s union in the national steering committees is important. This will help to ensure \nthat the implementation of GAD plans is effectively monitored, and GAD issues are mainstreamed in \ntourism development. At the provincial level, a subproject gender action plan will be prepared by the \nproject implementation unit with the help of the social and gender specialist and the community-\nbased tourism development advisers. These plans should be in keeping with ADB\u2019s Policy on \nGender and Development and should reflect all activities related to promoting women\u2019s equitable \nparticipation in tourism development and its benefits, to be implemented in a time bound manner. All \nplans should set targets that can be monitored. \n \n14.   The following generic principles should form the basis of subproject-level gender planning. \n(i) Under part B of the Project, in order to strengthen women\u2019s participation in tourism development, \nwomen will form 50% of all trainees in all training programs. (ii) At least 40% membership from \necotourism stakeholder associations at all levels will be women. (iii) Such women will be trained and \nwill, in turn, help in develop provincial GAD action plans, with targets that can be monitored. (iv) In \nkeeping with such action plans, they will (a) train participating communities in GAD issues related to \ntourism;  (b) help  disseminate  tourism-related  skills  particularly  among  rural  women,  and  in \nassociation with the local women\u2019s machinery; (c) build strong village-based women\u2019s groups for \nparticipation in ecotourism stakeholder associations, and for informed decision making; (d) under the \nguidance  of  the  social  and  gender  specialist  and  community-based  tourism  advisers  and \nparticipating  NGOs,  help  develop  training  and  education  programs  related  to  health  risks  of \nHIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases; and (e) design and implement for government agencies, \nthe private sector, local communities, and women\u2019s groups, awareness and training programs and \nworkshops related to the risks to women and children of trafficking, exploitation through illegal sex \nactivities, and other hazardous forms of employment.  \n \n15.  Gender outreach workshops for such training will be organized by the project implementation \nunits under the guidance of the social and gender specialist and the community-based tourism \ndevelopment advisers at provincial, district, and community levels, involving provincial and local \nofficials, and ethnic minority communities. Such workshops and training programs will aim at raising \nconsciousness among government agencies, local authorities, and ethnic minority communities, \nregarding (i) gender roles in the economy and society, (ii) likely impacts of tourism on such roles, \nand (iii) the need to strengthen women\u2019s awareness of pro-poor tourism-related opportunities and \ntheir capacity to participate effectively in such economic activities and in decision making. Such \nworkshops and associated gender training are expected to (i) contribute to greater awareness at all \nlevels of the need to fully involve poor  women, especially ethnic minority  women, in pro-poor \ntourism;  and (ii)  improve  the  awareness  and capacity  of  ethnic minority  women  regarding the \nimplications  of  pro-poor  tourism  development  for  their  own  livelihoods  and  communities,  and \nstrengthen broad-based opportunities for their participation.

The negative impacts of increased tourism associated with the spread prostitution, transmission of HIV/AIDS, \ntrafficking, and consumption of drugs can thus be reduced and positive community-based poverty reduction benefits \nincreased. By organizing the participating communities, the Project will promote stakeholder participation in decision-\nmaking regarding tourism. It will help promote training and awareness among tourism authorities and the private \nsector regarding pro-poor and gender responsive tourism development. By providing infrastructure, including improved \nsanitation and roads, the Project will provide much-needed health improvements, reduce time spent by women in \ncaring for sick family members, improve access of rural communities to markets and health services, and improve \nfacilities for cross-border workers.  \n \n \nB.

A Resettlement Plan has been prepared for each core subproject that will be implemented \nduring the first year of the loan and for which there is a sufficient level of design to identify land \nacquisition impacts.  A resettlement framework has also been prepared because some subprojects \nhave an insufficient level of design to be able to identify land acquisition impacts now, and for \nwhich the selection and design will entail a community participation process. The framework is \nbased on Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good \nPractice of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and includes the specific policies and guidelines \nfor the process of land acquisition and resettlement. For each remaining subproject that will entail \nland acquisition and resettlement, a resettlement plan will be prepared by the National Tourism \nAuthority  of  Lao  (NTAL)  after  detailed  design  of  each  subproject,  together  with  the  project \nmanagement units (PMUs).   \n \n2.  Scope and Scale of Resettlement.  A full resettlement plan has been prepared for the \nLouang Namtha airport improvement subproject, which will cause 109 families and one temple to \nbe relocated to a fully serviced site within 1 kilometer (km) of the present site due to extension of \nthe runway. \n \n3.  The pro-poor community-based tourism development subproject may require some minor \nland acquisition impacts for construction of small-scale community tourism-related infrastructure \nsuch as community lodges, guesthouses, river piers, viewing points, and upgrading of walking \ntrails. The selection of infrastructure and identification of zones of impact cannot be done before \nappraisal  due  to  lack  of  design  and  the  need  for  a  community  participation  process.  The \nresettlement  framework  will  guide  resettlement  planning  and  preparation  of  a  subproject \nresettlement plan for ADB approval during project implementation. \n \n4.  A short resettlement plan may be required for the Konglor Cave access road improvement \nsubproject, as the road passes through several villages; however, the impacts will be minimal, as \nthe road will not be widened. The zone of impact cannot be identified before appraisal because the \narea is not accessible during the rainy season. The detailed design will be undertaken during the \nfirst year of the Project and construction in the second year. The resettlement framework will guide \nresettlement planning and preparation of a subproject resettlement plan for ADB approval after \ndetailed design. \n \n5.  No resettlement plan is necessary for the Kwangsi Water Falls access road improvement \nsubproject, as it will not cause any land acquisition impact. In the unlikely event that land must be \nacquired, any impacts will be addressed in accordance with the framework.   \n \n6.  Principles of Land Acquisition and Resettlement.  The resettlement policy framework for \nthe Project has been built upon the laws of the Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic, ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement  (1995), and the draft national resettlement \npolicy.1 This Project will be bound by the principles and conditions stated in the resettlement \nframework that will be approved by ADB and NTAL. If there are any gaps between ADB and \nGovernment policy, ADB policy supersedes. The principles and objectives are to ensure that all \naffected persons (APs) will be compensated for their losses at replacement cost and provided with \n                                                 \n1  A draft national resettlement policy was prepared by the Lao PDR Government in 1995 and presented by the Science, \nTechnology and Environment Agency to the ADB Regional Workshop on National Resettlement Policy Enhancement \nand Capacity Building at ADB headquarters in 2002.  The draft policy is the basis for a ministerial decree on \nresettlement that is being prepared under the ADB loan 1867, approved on 6 December 2001 (ADB. 2001. Report and \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic for the Environment and Social Program. Manila). ", "44  Appendix 5 \nrehabilitation measures in order to assist them to improve on, or at least maintain, their pre-project \nliving standards and income earning capacity.   \n \n7.  Absence of formal legal title is not seen as a barrier to inclusion in compensation measures \nand no distinction will be made between legal and illegal APs. People who are to be resettled will \nbe assisted in at least reestablishing, if not improving their former living standards, income-earning \ncapacity, and livelihood production levels. Positive steps will be taken to ensure that poor and \ndisadvantaged groups receive special consideration.

Compensation Issues, Procedures and Definitions. The approach to land acquisition \nand resettlement is based on the Project\u2019s social impact surveys and the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s \nrequirements and procedures.  People eligible for compensation are those who will experience ", "    Appendix 5  45 \nnegative impacts on their assets and livelihoods as a result of the Project.  APs who appear in the \nsubproject\u2019s census will be entitled to compensation and assistance.   \n \n9.  Loss of land, whether with legal title or not, will be compensated through land-for-land \narrangements with full legal title to the new land (for agricultural land\u2013equal size and productive \ncapacity, for residential land\u2013equivalent size, and for commercial land\u2013equal size and accessibility \nto customers).  If APs opt for cash compensation, the amount will be equivalent to the current \nmarket value. The APs\u2019 compensation will be free from taxes, registration, and land transfer.  For \naffected houses and structures, compensation and assistance (in cash, kind, or both) will be \nequivalent to the full replacement cost sufficient to build a house/commercial structure of the same \nsize and standard. Loss of unharvested annual crops will be compensated at current market value \nwhile perennial crops and trees will be compensated at an annual produce value multiplied by a 5 \nyear factor.  \n \n10.  Relocating APs will receive a materials transport allowance in cash or in kind (e.g., vehicle \nand labor) to transport household effects and new and salvageable materials to new sites. A \nhousing subsistence allowance of KN1.2 million for relocating APs will be provided during the \ntransition. The allowance is based on the labor paid for rice planting at KN20,000 per day \nmultiplied by 60 days wages. The lump sum of KN1.2 million will also apply to businesses without \ntax declarations (e.g., small shops). For businesses with tax declarations, the amount will be based \non the business income tax statements that they provide, multiplied 3-6 months, depending on the \ntype of structure and estimated time to rebuild and reestablish business at the new site.  All \nbusinesses will be notified 3\u20134 months in advance to relocate and rebuild new business structures \nat new sites.  This will allow businesses to avoid disruption of operation and continue operating \nwhile  they  are  rebuilding  new  structures  at  the  new  sites.    Employees  will  receive  cash \ncompensation equivalent to actual wages lost for each day they cannot work while the business is \nreorganizing. \n \n11.  APs belonging to vulnerable groups including the very poor, especially the aged without \nsupport, women, disabled, or ethnic minorities. These groups are entitled to an additional special \nallowance amounting to KN200,000 based on identified needs and  priorities.  Households with \nmore than one factor of vulnerability are entitled to a KN200,000 special allowance for each factor. \nFor example, households who are very poor and with elderly household head would be entitled to \nKN400,000. In addition APs will receive any support necessary to obtain replacement land and \nresettlement. Relocating vulnerable households will also be assisted in rebuilding their homes if \ntraditional sources of community or family support are insufficient. To ensure that the special needs \nof women are addressed, the resettlement committees will include women representatives. \n \n12.  Implementation Arrangements.  NTAL is the Executing Agency for the Project. A project \ncoordination  unit  under  NTAL  will  be  established  wherein  one  social  specialist  and  one \nresettlement specialist will work full time for the Project. Project management units will also be \nestablished in the division of communications, transport, posts and construction, and resettlement \ncommittees will be created. These  PMUs will be responsible for the planning and day-to-day \nimplementation of all resettlement-related activities. They will also work closely with concerned \ngovernment agencies and organizations.  The PMUs will provide monthly reports to the project \ncoordination  unit  (PCU)  and  the  PCU  will  submit  quarterly  reports  to  ADB.  Training  in \ncompensation standards, procedures, entitlements, implementation, grievance, and monitoring \nprocedures for the provincial, district, village resettlement committees will be conducted by the \nPCU and construction supervision consultants. International and local resettlement experts from \nthe construction supervision consultants will work closely with the PCU, PMUs and affected \ncommunities, and provide capacity building to ensure that knowledge and expertise are transferred \nto the concerned agencies and to encourage participation among APs. ", "46  Appendix 5 \n13.  Implementation  Schedule.    Subproject resettlement plans (RPs) will include detailed \nimplementation  schedules  coordinated  with  the  civil  works  schedule  for  the  subproject.  All \nsubproject RPs will be reviewed by ADB prior to project implementation. The compensation, \nresettlement, and rehabilitation activities will be satisfactorily completed before ADB approves the \naward of contract of civil works under each subcomponent project. \n \n14.  Complaints and Grievances.  The APs will be made fully aware of their rights to grievance \nand the procedures, verbally and in writing, during consultation, survey, and compensation. The \nAPs  may  present  their  complaints  to  the  concerned  local  administrative  officials  and/or  the \nresettlement committees.  The complaints will be filed first at the village level and will be elevated \nto the provincial level if the APs are not satisfied with the earlier decisions. Local administrative \nauthorities and resettlement committees at each level will settle complaint within 15 days of their \nbeing submitted. The APs will be exempted from all taxes, administrative, and legal fees for \nresettlement.    \n \n15.  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.    The  PCU  and  PMUs  are  responsible  for  the  internal \nmonitoring activities of RPs.  The PMUs and project implementation units will provide the PCU with \nmonthly status reports.  The PCU will submit quarterly reports to ADB. In addition, the PCU will \nensure that the construction supervision consultants include in their progress reports the status of \nRP  implementation,  including  information  on  location  and  number  of  people  relocated, \ncompensation amounts paid by item, and assistance provided to APs. For external monitoring and \npostevaluation activities, the PCU will engage a suitable domestic agency acceptable to ADB, \nunder terms of reference acceptable to ADB, to monitor the land acquisition and resettlement \nprograms. The PCU and PMU will provide the domestic agency all resettlement-related documents.  \nThe agency will submit to the PCU and ADB quarterly status reports together with detailed \nassessments.   \n \n16.  Cost and Budget. Adequate budgetary support will be fully committed and made available \nto cover the costs of land acquisition and resettlement within the agreed implementation period. \nSubproject RPs will include the breakdown for each type of losses with corresponding cost \nestimates reflecting replacement cost at current market values.  The cost estimates will make \nadequate  provision  for  contingencies.  The  RPs  will  also  include  the  detailed  schedule  and \nprocedures related to flow of RP funds. \n \n17.

This initial environmental examination (IEE) was carried out as a sample for IEEs of similar \nsewerage and sewage treatment subprojects under the Mekong Tourism Development Project. \nThe IEE was based on site visits, discussion with local authorities and study of the environment in \nSiem Reap, Cambodia. \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n \n2.  Siem Reap Province has presented a proposal to develop a formal sewerage and sewage \ntreatment system in the town of Siem Reap under the Project. Tourists visiting the World Heritage \nSite of Angkor Wat stay in Siem Reap. Siem Reap has a very limited sewerage system and no \nsewerage facilities treatment. The town is expanding rapidly due to the need to accommodate the \nincreasing number of tourists visiting Angkor Wat and migration into the town. The Project will \ndevelop (i) a sewerage system to replace an open channel serving the town on the west side of the \nSiem Reap River, and (ii)  wastewater treatment facilities. The proposed system will manage \nwastewater  from  the  rapidly  increasing  number  of  hotels  and  about  20,000  residents.  All \nwastewater collected by the present sewer is disposed of into a channel. The wastewater flows into \nthe irrigation system and some of it eventually into the Tonle Sap Lake without treatment, although \nmost is distributed in the rice fields before reaching the lake.  \n \n4.  The proposed Project will include (i) rehabilitation of the open channel on the west side of \nthe river as a covered sewer; (ii) new connections along the west side of town, carrying overflows \nfrom septic tanks, hotels, hospitals and private homes; (iii) separation of storm water run-off from \nseptic tank wastes by existing channels and lagoons from septic tank wastes; (iv) a new series of \nlagoons (anaerobic and facultative) to treat the discharges from the west side of Siem Reap; \n(v) development of a system for the safe disposal of sludge from septic tanks and treatment \nlagoons;  and  (vi)  discharge  of  treated  effluent  into  an  irrigation  canal.  The  project  will  be \nimplemented by the Department of Public Works and Transport of Siem Reap Province.  \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n5.  Siem Reap town lies on the plains between Tonle Sap Lake (15 kilometers [km] to the \nsouth) and the Kulen Mountains, 30 km to the northeast. The plains undulate gently, ranging in \nelevation from 10 to 80 meters (m), and the town lies on generally flat land, sloping down toward \nthe lake. The soils are alluvial silts, sands, and clays deposited by floodwaters from the Siem Reap \nRiver and ancient drainage channels.  \n \n6.  The Siem Reap River flows through the center of the town. The quality of the surface water \nin the Siem Reap River deteriorates as it passes through the town due to septic tanks overflows \nfrom squatter houses along the riverbank. However, a recent survey by the Ministry of Environment \n(MOE)  shows  that  the  water  quality  in  the  river  (biochemical  oxygen  demand  [BOD]:  40.7 \nmilligram/liter [mg/l], chemical oxygen demand [COD]: 69.7 mg/l) still meets the required national \nstandards (BOD: 80 mg/l, COD: 100mg/l).  \n \n7.  Siem Reap District has 112,000 people; about 37,000 of them live within the town. The \nprincipal economic activities are related to tourism, including hotels, guesthouses, restaurants, \nsouvenir shops, guiding, and taxi. Tourism is increasing rapidly in Siem Reap town, and the town is \nalso the center of a primarily agricultural district with rice production, cattle raising, and fishing. ", "Appendix 6   49 \n \n8.  The area to the west of the town, to be served by the Project, is relatively prosperous and \nincludes the old market and hospital area, and new hotels along the main road. Water quality of the \nopen channel is very poor as shown by a MOE recent survey (Table A6). \n  \nTable A6: Water Quality Data in the Siem Reap Channel \n \nName of Location  pH (mg/l)  BOD (mg/I)  COD (mg/l) \n5 \nWat Damnak Bridge  6.83  195.0  457.0 \nAng Kropeu Village  7.15  72.80  139.0 \nWattpor Village  6.70  260.0  540.0 \nThe Place In front of Psar Chas  6.74  185.6  397.8 \n  National Standard    5-9  <80  <100 \nBOD = biochemical oxygen demand, COD =  chemical oxygen demand, mg = milligram, pH  (a \nmeasure of acidity and alkalinity).  \n \n \n9.  The proposed site for the wastewater treatment lagoons is on the southwest edge of the \ntown on a rice paddy field. Some bushes, trees, standing water, and a few isolated houses are on \nor adjacent to the site.  \n \nD.  Screening Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n10.  The Project will improve the environmental and health conditions along the existing channel \nand the areas around it. The office of health services in Siem Reap Province has recorded that \n24% of reported diseases in the town are water-related, and 42% of these could be prevented if \nwater quality is improved.  \n \n11.  Contamination of groundwater from septic tank overflows and the channel will be reduced \ndue to the Project, thus reducing the risk of contamination of shallow wells throughout the area, \nwhich in many cases are located within 5 m of the channel. The safe disposal of sludge from septic \ntanks and lagoons will contribute to better environmental conditions in the rural areas where these \nare currently dumped. The Project will help reduce the incidence of waterborne diseases. \n \n12.  The potential negative impacts of the project include (i) disruption of households and road \nusers while cleaning out and rehabilitating the channel, and of hotels and households while \ninstalling connections to the new sewerage system; (ii) removal of contaminated sludge from the \nchannels, which may be temporarily left lying in the streets, posing a health hazard; (iii) removal of \nillegally constructed buildings and walls, which could create conflicts with affected people; (iv) land \nacquisition which will be required for the lagoons site; (v) the site proposed for the lagoons which \nmay contain items of archaeological importance; (vi) discharge of inadequately treated waste \nwaters into the irrigation canals; and (vii) bad odors and flies from inadequately designed treatment \nlagoons, affecting nearby households. However, appropriate practices during construction should \nminimize disturbance to households and road users, and damage to historical sites; and adequate \ndesign for the sewerage and sewage treatment, allowing for expansion of the town, will prevent \nany negative environmental impacts. Mitigation measures to ameliorate any negative impacts are \nsummarized in paragraphs 13\u201317. \n \n13.  The site selected for the lagoons of the treatment plant is an open space. Some small trees \nare adjacent to an open channel. No environmentally or culturally sensitive areas at the site, \nalthough during construction the contractor will take special care to preserve any historical remains \nthat are found. Some structures illegally encroaching on the channel structures will have to be \nremoved. A short resettlement plan has been prepared following ADB resettlement policy to ensure \nthat affected people will be compensated. ", "50   Appendix 6 \n14.  The  analysis  of  channel  water  quality  has  confirmed  that  the  proposed  process  for \nwastewater treatment (lagoon system) is adequate and acceptable. To ensure that the outflows of \nthe lagoon system can be used for irrigation or can be discharged directly into public water bodies, \na maximum of 80 mg/l per BOD and 80 mg/l for suspended substances is recommended for the \neffluent discharged from the Project.  \n \n15.  A drainage channel already exists and the proposed lagoons will be on flat open land with \nlittle risk of erosion. To avoid contamination from dredged materials, proper arrangements for \nconstruction supervision will be done by (i) appointing experienced contractors; (ii) including for \nlocal contractors a training and capacity building component on efficient project management and \nsite safety; (iii) constructing during dry season, if possible; and (iv) regularly monitoring disposal of \ndredged materials.  \n \nE.  Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan \n \n16.  Prior to the design of the subproject, an environmental management plan (EMP) will be \nprepared for the construction and operation phases of the subproject. Environmental monitoring \nduring operation will ensure that (i) open channels receiving wastewater are kept clear of weeds \nand rubbish; and (ii) effluent being discharged into the irrigation canals meets the standards, 80 \nmg/l of BOD, and 80 mg/l of suspended solids.  \n \n17.  During  the  first  year  of  the  subproject  implementation,  at  least  one  international \nenvironment specialist will be recruited for 1 month and a domestic specialist will be recruited for 2 \nmonths to help prepare the detailed EMP. Additionally, an  environment unit will be established \nwithin the project implementation unit to ensure that the mitigation measures identified in the IEE \nare complied with at all stages of the subproject. Implementation of the EMP and proposed \nmitigation measures will be monitored regularly during the construction and operation period. \nMonitoring results will be reported in the progress reports during project implementation and be \nsubmitted to the Asian Development Bank and MOE for review.  \n \nF.  Findings and Recommendations \n \n18.  The proposed sewerage and sewage treatment subproject is unlikely to result in any direct \nsignificant adverse environmental impacts. The identified adverse effects were readily addressed \nthrough proper engineering predesign and incorporation of the identified mitigation measures. \nAdverse impacts relate almost entirely to the construction phase, and particular attention will be \npaid to ensure that contractors comply with good engineering practice and avoid inconvenience to \nthe public during construction. To ensure correct design and environmentally sound construction \nand operation, an EMP will be prepared prior to the design. \n \nG.  Conclusions \n \n19.  The  IEE  concluded  that  no  significant  environmental  impacts  are  expected  from  the \nproposed subproject and additional studies, or a full environmental impact assessment are not \nneeded. After completion of the subproject, it will have positive environmental benefits for Siem \nReap town.   \n ", "Appendix 7       51\nPROJECT COST ESTIMATES\nTable A7.1: Cost Estimates for Cambodia\n(US$ million)\nForeign Local Total\nComponent Cost Costa\nA.

Infrastructure Design and Construction Supervision Specialists. These specialists provide \nthe principal technical inputs for each subproject. The exact requirements will depend on the nature \nand technical requirements of the subproject, but broadly fall into four categories: road construction, \nairport  construction  and  rehabilitation,  port  and  pier  construction  on  the  river,  sewerage  and \nwastewater treatment, and solid waste management. The international specialists will be supported by \nlocally recruited consultants who will provide such services as surveying, quantity surveying, and \narchitecture.

An economic analysis has been conducted for each of tourism infrastructure subprojects \nand a community-based ecotourism subproject in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao \nPDR), following the Asian Development Bank (ADB)  Guidelines  for the Economic Analysis of \nProjects  (1997) and ADB\u2019s  Framework  for  the  Economic  and  Financial  Appraisal  of  Urban \nDevelopment Sector Projects (1994). The economic analysis is undertaken by comparing the cost \nand benefits with and without the project. The without-Project scenario refers to the continuation of \nthe existing situation. The with-Project case is established by appraising the costs and benefits of \neach subproject. The subprojects are evaluated over a period of 30 years with no salvage value \nassumed thereafter. \n \nA.  Economic Cost \n \n2.  The capital costs and incremental operation and maintenance costs of  each subproject \nhave been considered. Economic costs have been derived from the financial  project costs. All \ncosts are expressed in constant (2001) prices.  Physical contingencies of 10% have been added to \nthe base costs1 and taxes and duties have been discounted as appropriate. Economic costs were \nvalued using the domestic price numeraire but expressed in dollar currency. Tradable components \nhave  been  adjusted  to  economic  prices  using  shadow  exchange  rate  factors  (SERF)2 and \nnontraded components are valued at domestic market prices. Appropriate shadow wage rate \nfactors (SWRF) for unskilled labor have been used to reflect its opportunity costs in the context of \nwide availability of labor in the three countries.3 Incremental operation and maintenance costs have \nbeen taken into account and added to capital costs to obtain the total economic cost of the \nsubprojects for each year. \n \nB.  Economic Benefits \n \n3.  The major economic benefits of the Project are increased spending by  foreign tourists \nvisiting the project areas. Moreover, environmental and health benefits will arise from improved \nwater, sanitation, and solid waste management and different types of resource savings due to the \nactivities of the Project. \n   \n4.  Tourism Benefits. The Project will ease the constraints hampering tourism development in \nthe project areas by rehabilitating and upgrading transportation infrastructure, i.e. airports, roads, \nand passenger quays, and providing wastewater and solid waste management services in some \nimportant tourist destinations. The Project will also enhance the region\u2019s attractiveness by opening \nnew tour attractions that would be almost inaccessible without the Project. Tourism benefits will \narise from the Project due to increased (i) numbers of tourists visiting the project areas, (ii) tourist \nstays in the project areas, and (iii) spending by tourists. The analysis considers mainly the benefits \nfrom foreign tourists, as in most cases, the spending of the local tourists is marginal compared with \nthat of foreign tourists.  \n \n5.  The tourism benefits gained by the subprojects are the increased net expenditure of the \nforeign tourists and the multiplier effects on the country\u2019s economy, which are induced by the \nproject and retained by the project country. The net expenditure of the tourists, which is estimated \nto be  30% of the  gross tourists\u2019 expenditure,  is the tourists\u2019 overall expenditure on the tourism \nservices less the costs of providing such services. The analysis takes 50% of the project-induced \nincremental net expenditure of the tourists as the benefits arising directly from the subprojects and \n                                                                 \n1  Excluding land and relocation cost. \n2  The SERFs are estimated at 1.11 for all three countries. \n3  The SWRF is estimated at 0.75 for Cambodia, 0.65 for Viet Nam, and 0.60 for Lao PDR. ", "66  Appendix 12 \na factor of 0.9 is used to adjust this net expenditure to the benefits of the country after considering \nthe leakage and multiplier effects of the tourism benefits in the Greater Mekong Subregion.4 The \ncurrent tourist arrivals, average stay, and spending in the subproject area, and projections under \nwith  and  without  project  scenarios,  are  estimated  by  subproject  taking  into  account  recent \ndevelopment trends, attractiveness of the subproject area, constraints on tourism development in \nthe area, and the impact of the subproject on removing/releasing the constraints. Details of the \nnumbers of  the tourists, their average stay, and  their spending in the subproject area and the \ndevelopment projections are presented in Supplementary Appendix G. \n  \n6.  Incremental  Airport  Operating  Revenues. The airport operating revenues consist of \nlanding and parking fees, passenger charges, commercial charges, and other miscellaneous \nincomes. Incremental airport operating revenues will arise from more flights and passengers using \nthe airport and higher charge rates after the project. The economic incremental operating revenues \nare derived from the financial incremental revenues.  \n \n7.  Aircraft Operating Cost Savings. Aircraft operating cost savings will result from three \nairport improvement subprojects. The current length of runways allows only the YN7 (50 seats) and \nYN12 (17 seats) to operate. With improvements to runways, the larger and more reliable ATR725 \n(70 seats), which is commonly used in the region, will be allowed to land, and airline operators will \nbenefit from reduced operating, repair, and maintenance costs. The aircraft operating cost savings \nare calculated using the typical operating costs per seat block hour of YN7 and ATR72 aircrafts \nand appropriate airplane loading factors derived from the capacities of the aircrafts, number of \npassengers, and projected flight schedules. \n \n8.  Vehicle Operating Cost Savings. The proposed roads leading to potential tour attractions \nunder  the  Project  are  either  clay  or  gravel  and  in  very  poor  condition.  Some  of  them  are \nimpassable during the rainy season.  Traveling on the roads is dusty and uncomfortable. The \nvehicle operations cost savings attributable to the Project arise from (i) an overall improvement of \nroad condition measured by roughness,  and (ii) in some cases,  reduced road distance. The \nforecast average traffic growth per annum is based on the recent growth of registered vehicles, the \neconomic development projection for the country, and other relevant studies. In the with-Project \nscenario, no additional traffic was assumed, except for subprojects that will open a road for year-\nround traffic.  \n \n9.  Public Health Benefits. Water-related diseases and health problems are attributed to \nunsanitary conditions, including the contamination of groundwater by wastewater. The Project, by \nproviding proper sewage and sewerage treatment facilities, will enable wastewater collection and \ntreatment and subsequently reduce the incidence of waterborne diseases. The benefits counted in \nthe economic analysis are only the government savings from hospital and health service spending \nand household\u2019s savings on expenditure on medical care. The without-Project case has assumed a \ncontinuing deterioration of the unsanitary situation, and therefore an increasing incidence of the \nwaterborne  diseases  with  increasing  government  and  household  expenditure  for  treating \nwaterborne diseases. The with-Project case has assumed a proportional reduction of the incidence \nof the waterborne diseases and therefore less government and household expenditure for treating \nwaterborne diseases.  \n \n10.  Benefits Identified but not Valued. The analysis does not include some important benefits \nthat are difficult to value, for which data are unavailable, or that might give rise to double counting \n                                                                 \n4  The major assumptions and estimations in this economic analysis are made mainly based on the Mekong Lancang \nRiver Tourism Planning Study, which was completed in 1998 with ADB\u2019s support, and previous studies by ADB and \nUnited Nation\u2019s Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific. \n5  ATR72 is a twin-turboprop engine aircraft used for regional and short-haul routes. ", "  Appendix 12   67 \nunder some circumstances. The nonvalued benefits include: (i) benefits to local tourists, except \nfor the Sam Mountain environmental improvement, as the local tourists account more than 99% of \nvisitors; (ii) positive impact on economic activities due to improved transportation infrastructure; \n(iii) improved accessibility for people in remote areas to goods and services supplied outsides; \n(iv) travel  time  savings  due  to  the  improved  road  conditions  and  shorter  travel  distance; \n(v) improved safety and reduced incidence of flight cancellations and diversions due to better \nairport conditions; (vi) road maintenance expenditure savings due to a lower incidence of flooding; \n(vii) reduced flood damage due to better drainage; (viii) reduced costs of removing solid waste \nfrom drains and canals; and (ix) increased productivity due to better health. \n \nC.  Results of the Economic Analysis \n \n11.  The economic internal rates of return  (EIRR) has been calculated for each of the tourism \ninfrastructure subproject and one sample pro-poor community-based ecotourism subproject in \nLouang Namtha, Lao PDR. The results of the economic analysis are summarized in Table A12. \nThe EIRRs as evaluated range from 13.3% to 33.4%.  \n \nTable 12.1: EIRRs and NPVs for Subprojects \n  EIRR  NPV ($ million) \nSubproject  (percent)  (Discounted at 12 percent) \nSiem Reap Wastewater Management  33.4  7.39 \nAccess Road Improvement to the Genocide Memorial  25.1  1.54 \nRattanak Kiri Airport Improvement  13.3  0.65 \nStung Treng Airport Improvement  14.2  0.39 \nAccess Road Improvement to the Kwangsi Water Falls  21.4  2.84 \nAccess Road Improvement to Konglor Cave  15.3  0.95 \nLouang Namtha Airport Improvement  16.6  0.60 \nAn Giang Tourist River Piers Improvement  17.7  0.52 \nSam Mountain Environmental Improvement  27.0  7.21 \nMy Tho Tourist River Pier Improvement  31.5  3.69 \nTien Giang Environmental Improvement  23.6  1.41 \nPro-poor Community-Based Ecotourism  19.3  0.18 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nD.  Sensitivity Analysis \n \n12.  Sensitivity analyses have been undertaken to test the robustness of the analysis and the \nconsequences of changes in the following variables: (i) 10% increase of the project cost; (ii) 10% \ndecrease of the project benefits (iii) a combination of both; and (iv) project benefits delayed by 1 \nyear. Additionally, sensitivity analyses have also been made to test the consequences of (i) tourist \ngrowth reduced by 20% and (ii) tourist expenditure reduced by 20%. The results of the sensitivity \nanalysis are summarized in Supplementary Appendix G.  \n \n13.  The results of the analysis show that, in most cases, the EIRRs are most sensitive to delays \nand reductions in benefits. However, all EIRRs remain over 12% in the worst possible scenario \ntested in sensitivity analysis. The results show switching values range from 16% to 644% in the \ncase of cost increase and 14% to 87% for benefit reduction.  All  subprojects  are  considered \neconomically viable since the EIRR exceeds the economic opportunity cost of capital and there are \nother benefits that have not been quantified due to measurement difficulties and lack of data.  \n \nE.  Distribution Analysis \n \n14.  Distribution analyses have been prepared for four sample subprojects: (i) Siem Reap \nenvironmental improvement, in Cambodia; (ii) Louang Namtha airport improvement, in Lao PDR; ", "68  Appendix 12 \n(iii) Tien Giang environmental improvement, in Viet Nam; and (iv) Louang Namtha community-\nbased pro-poor ecotourism, in the analyses were prepared to assess the distribution of project \neffects among the stakeholders. The major stakeholders of the Project are (i) the Government, (ii) \nlabor, and (iii) local households. Details are presented in Supplementary Appendix G. \n  \n15.  The Government will gain from (i) increased tax revenue due to the incremental expenditure \nfrom  foreign  tourists,6 (ii)  aircraft  operating  cost  savings  through  the  airport  improvement \nsubproject, and (iii) savings on hospital and health services through environmental improvement \nsubprojects. But the Government will lose due to overvaluation of domestic currency at the official \nexchange rate, implying the economic cost of traded inputs is higher than the financial costs by the \nextent of the SERF. The Government will also pay for the financial loss because subprojects will be \nsubsidized by the Government budget. The analyses show the governments of Cambodia and Viet \nNam will gain $2.41 million and $0.33 million, respectively from the subprojects, while the Lao PDR \nneeds  to  provide  $0.51  million  to  subsidize  the  Louang  Namtha  airport  improvement  and \necotourism subprojects ($0.20 million for airport and $0.31 million for ecotourism). \n \n16.  Laborers will gain from the subprojects, because the wages paid by the subprojects during \nconstruction  and  the  salaries  paid  by  the  incremental  businesses  due  to  increased  tourism \nspending exceed the opportunity cost of labor. This benefit accrues to unskilled laborers. The \nanalyses show the labor in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam will gain $1.23 million, $0.47 million \n($0.39  million  from  the  airport  and  $0.08  million  from  the  ecotourism),  and  $0.56  million, \nrespectively, from the subprojects. \n \n17.  Local households will benefit from (i) increased numbers and expenditures of tourists, \n(ii) increased  productivity  and  reduced  medical  expenses  from  the  environment  improvement \nsubproject, and (iii) better and safer air services from airport improvement. The analyses show the \nresidents in Siem Reap, Louang Namtha, and My Tho will gain $3.75 million, $0.71 million ($0.41 \nmillion from the airport and $0.30 million from the ecotourism), and $0.52 million, respectively from \nthe subprojects. \n \n18.  The results of the distribution analyses indicate that the residents and labor are the major \nbeneficiaries of the subprojects. While the Government of the Lao PDR will probably subsidize the \nLouang Namtha airport and ecotourism projects, this can be justified because the projects will bring \na net economic benefit to the Louang Namtha Province, which is a poor and remote province in the \nLao PDR. \n                                                                 \n6   The government taxes include 10% value-added tax and 20% profit tax in Cambodia, 10% business tax and 20% of \nprofit tax in the Lao PDR, and 10% value-added tax and 32% profit tax in Viet Nam.
