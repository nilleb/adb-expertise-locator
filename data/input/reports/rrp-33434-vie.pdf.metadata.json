An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was \nundertaken and the summary IEE is a supplementary appendix. A \nsample IEE is presented in a core appendix.  \n \nThe Project will promote the development of the tourism sector in \nthe  lower  Mekong  River  basin.  It  will  improve  tourism-related \ninfrastructure  in  Cambodia,  Lao  PDR,  and  Viet  Nam  (Greater \nMekong  Subregion  (GMS)  participating  countries  [GMSPC]), \nsupport  pro-poor  community  based  tourism  projects  in  the  rural \nareas  of  these  countries,  facilitate  private  sector  participation  in \ntourism  marketing  and  promotion,  establish  mechanisms  to \nincrease  subregional  cooperation,  and facilitate  the  movement  of \ntourists across borders. \n \nThe  GMS  is  the  fastest growing  tourism  destination  in  the  world. \nThis is bringing in much-needed foreign exchange, creating jobs, \nand contributing to economic growth. However, growth in tourism \nis  constrained  by  difficulties  in  access,  the  lack  of  investment  in \ntourist  infrastructure,  the  absence  of  new  products  to  attract \nvisitors, and weaknesses in policy and institutional capacities. The \nGMS  countries  have  a  strong  comparative  advantage  in  tourism, \ndemonstrated by the high growth rates, but need to exploit it more \neffectively  to  use  it  as  an  instrument  of  poverty  reduction  and \nbroad-based economic growth. \n \nInvestments  in  access  roads,  airports,  river  piers,  sewerage \nservices,  solid  waste  management,  and  human \nresource \ndevelopment  are  badly  needed.  Also  needed  are  investments  in \npro-poor,  community-based  tourism  to  put  local  communities  at \nthe  heart  of  tourism  growth  in  the  subregion.  The  poor  need  to \nshare  in  the  benefits  of  increased  tourism  and  to  participate \nactively  in  its  growth.  At  the  policy  and  institutional  level,  issues \nconcerning  partnerships  between  the  public  and  private  sectors, \nand  enhanced  access  to  and  within  the  subregion  need  to  be \nurgently addressed.  \n \nTourism  development  in  the  GMS  needs  to  cater  not  only  to \nexpansion but also the effective management of current levels of \ntourism  activity.  Cultural  traditions  and  natural  habitats  are  under \nthreat.  Mechanisms  need  to  be  developed  so  that  tourists,  host \ncommunities,  and  the  public  take  effective  responsibility  for \nconserving  and  strengthening  the  fragile  cultural  and  physical \nenvironment. \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \nObjectives  \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \n\ntourism \n\nindustries  and  have  recognized \n\nincrease  employment,  and  promote \n\nTourism  in  the  GMS  has  become  increasingly  multicountry.  In  a \nhighly competitive world tourism market, the GMS can survive and \ngrow only if it promotes a \u201cone holiday, several destinations\u201d type \nof  tourism.  Individual  tourism  sectors  in  the  GMS  countries  can  \nonly   prosper   when   they   are   strongly linked to others. \n \nSubregional cooperation in tourism is not a slogan in the GMS\u2013it \nis  central  to  its  existence.    Cambodia,  Lao  PDR,  and  Viet  Nam \nthe \nhave  nascent \nadvantages  of  cooperating  in  order  to  develop  new  products, \nimprove the policy climate and institutional capacities, strengthen \npromotion  and  marketing,  and  establish  effective  partnerships \nbetween  the  public  and  private  sectors.  With  increased  tourist \narrivals,  higher  incomes  from  tourism,  and  effective  conservation \nand  protection  of  the  cultural  and  physical  environment,  these \ncountries  will  be  able  to  create  jobs,  reduce  poverty,  ensure \nequitable  distribution  of  tourism  benefits,  and  improve  economic \nand social well-being. \n \nThe Project aims to reduce poverty in the countries, contribute to \nthe \neconomic  growth, \nconservation  of  the  natural  and  cultural  heritage.  The  specific \nobjective  of  the  Project  is  to  promote  sustainable  tourism  in  the \nlower  Mekong \ninfrastructure \ncountries \nimprovements,  community  and  private  sector  participation,  and \nsubregional  cooperation.  The  Project  will  improve  high  priority, \ntourism-related  infrastructure  in  Cambodia,  Lao  PDR,  and  Viet \nNam, promote pro-poor, community-based sustainable tourism in \nrural  areas,  and  strengthen  subregional  cooperation.  It  will \nmitigate  environmental  degradation,  develop  human  resources, \nand  promote  cooperation  between  private  and  public  sectors \nwithin  the GMS  by  establishing  tourism marketing  and  promotion \nboards.  The  Project  will  comprise  four  parts:  (i)  tourism-related \ninfrastructure \n(ii)  pro-poor,  community-based \ntourism development; (iii) subregional cooperation for sustainable \ntourism;  and  (iv)  implementation  assistance  and  institutional \nstrengthening. \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project,  including  physical  and  price \ncontingencies,  duties,  taxes,  and  interest  during  construction,  is \nestimated  at  $47.1  million  equivalent.  The foreign  exchange  cost \nis  $30.2  million,  or  64.1%  of  the  total.  The  local  currency  cost, \nincluding duties and taxes, is $16.9 million equivalent, or 35.9% of \nthe  total.  The  estimated  costs  by  country  are  $20.7  million \nequivalent  for  Cambodia,  $14.2  million  equivalent  for  the  Lao \nPDR, and $12.2 million equivalent for Viet Nam. \n \n\nimprovements; \n\nthrough \n\nbasin \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nv\n\nThe  proposed  ADB  loans  will  be  $15.6  million  equivalent  for \nCambodia,  $10.9  million  equivalent  for  the  Lao  PDR,  and  $8.5 \nmillion  equivalent  for  Viet  Nam.  The  loans,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds  resources,  will  have  a  repayment  period  of  32  years, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  with  an  interest  charge  of \n1.0%  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  during  the  amortization \nperiod.  The  Borrowers  will  be  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia,  Lao \nPDR,  and  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  their  respective \ncomponents.  The  proceeds  of  the  proposed  ADB  loans  will \nfinance  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  part  of  the  local \ncurrency  cost  of  the  three  components.  The  Governments  will \nbear  the  exchange  risk  and  transfer  the  loan  proceeds  to  the \nrelevant executing agencies (EAs). \n\nForeign\n\nLocal\nExchange Currency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\n($ million)\n\n \n\nPercentage\n\nSource \n\n \nCambodia \nADB \nGovernment\n \nTotal \nLao PDR \nADB \nGovernment\n \nTotal \nViet Nam \nADB \nGovernment\n \nOverall \nProject \nADB \nGovernment\n \n\nTotal \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n13.0 \n0.0 \n13.0 \n \n9.3 \n0.0 \n9.3 \n \n7.9 \n0.0 \n7.9 \n\n \n30.2 \n0.0 \n30.2 \n\n \n\n2.6 \n5.1 \n7.7 \n \n1.6 \n3.3 \n4.9 \n \n0.6 \n3.7 \n4.3 \n\n \n4.8 \n12.1 \n16.9 \n\n15.6 \n5.1 \n20.7 \n \n10.9 \n3.3 \n14.2 \n \n8.5 \n3.7 \n12.2 \n\n \n35.0 \n12.1 \n47.1 \n\n75.4%\n24.6%\n100.0%\n\n76.8%\n23.2%\n100.0%\n\n69.7%\n30.3%\n100.0%\n\n74.3%\n25.7%\n100.0%\n\n \n \nLoan Amount and \nTerms \n\n \n     ADB = Asian Development Bank. \n \nCambodia  Component:  The  equivalent  of  SDR11.811  million \n($15.6  million  equivalent)  will  be  provided  in  various  currencies \nfrom the Special Funds resources of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, \nand with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n\n\f \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agencies \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nvi \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nLao PDR Component: The equivalent of SDR8.255 million ($10.9 \nmillion equivalent) will be provided in various currencies from the \nSpecial Funds resources of ADB for a term of 32 years, including \na grace period of 8 years, and with an interest charge at the rate \nof 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter. \n \nViet  Nam  Component:  The  equivalent  of  SDR6.416  million  (8.5 \nmillion equivalent) will be provided in various currencies from the \nSpecial Funds resources of ADB for a term of 32 years, including \na grace period of 8 years, and with an interest charge at the rate \nof 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter. \n \nUntil June 2008 \n \n31 December 2007 \n\ninfrastructure \n\nimplementing \n\nin  charge  of \n\n \nThe EAs for the Project will the Ministry of Tourism for Cambodia, \nthe National Tourism Authority of the Lao PDR, and the Vietnam \nNational  Administration  of  Tourism.  In  Viet  Nam,  the  provincial \npeople\u2019s  committees  of  An  Giang  and  Tien  Giang  provinces  will \nbe the EAs for part A of the Project. The EAs will be supported by \nIAs \nimprovement \nsubprojects.  \n \nThe implementing agencies (IAs) in Cambodia will be the Ministry \nof Public Works and Transport, State Secretariat of Civil Aviation, \nand Phnom Penh Municipality; and in the Lao PDR, the IAs will be \nthe  division  of  communications,  transport,  posts  and  construction \nof  Louang  Phrabang  and  Khammouan  provinces,  and \nthe \nDepartment of Civil Aviation. Project coordination units (PCUs), to \nbe  headed  by  a  project  director,  will  be  established  in  each \nnational tourism organization. The PCUs will be supported by the \nproject management units established in the IAs in Cambodia and \nLao PDR, and in the EAs in Viet Nam, and project implementation \nunits  (PIUs)  will  be  established  at  the  provincial  level  for  most \nsubprojects.  PCUs  will  be \nfor  day-to-day \nmanagement,  and  monitoring  of  all  project  activities,  including \ncoordination  with  PCUs  in  other  GMS  participating  countries, \nPMUs,  and  PIUs.  Each  PCU  will  be  staffed  by  a  project  director \nand  six  permanent  staff,  including  a  project  manager,  a  financial \nofficer,  an  accountant,  an  environment  specialist,  a  social \nspecialist,  and  a  resettlement  specialist;  and  supported  by \ninternational and domestic consultants.   \n \n \n\nresponsible \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nProcurement \n\nvii\n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nGoods  and  works  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  ADB  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  International \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  will  be  used  for major  civil  works \ncontracts estimated to cost over $1.0 million and supply contracts \nvalued  over  $500,000. Minor  civil  works  will  be  procured  through \nin  accordance  with  procedures \nlocal  competitive  bidding \nacceptable  to  ADB.  International  shopping  procedures  will  be \nfollowed for materials and equipment packages estimated to cost \nmore than $100,000 equivalent but less than $500,000 equivalent. \nEquipment  items  that  are  locally  available,  and  cost  less  than \n$100,000  equivalent,  may  be  procured  through  direct  purchase  \nin  accordance  with  procedures  satisfactory  to  ADB.  For  the  pro-\npoor,  community-based  tourism  component,  where  the  proposed \nsubprojects  will  be  relatively  small,  and  scattered  throughout  the \nprovinces,  the  Project  may  fund  nongovernment  organizations  to \nwork  in  a  collaborative  and  participatory  manner  with  local \ncommunities. \n \nTo  support  the  implementation  of  the  Project,  a  total  of  346 \nperson-months  of  consulting  services  (127  person-months  of \ninternational and 219 person-months of domestic services) will be \nrequired  for  Cambodia;  241  person-months  (104  person-months \nof  international  and  137  person-months  of  domestic  services) for \nthe  Lao  PDR,  and  169  person-months  (63  person-months  of \ninternational  and  106  person-months  of  domestic  services)  for \nViet  Nam.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic \nconsultants.  \n \nThe  poor  in  rural  areas  will  especially  benefit  from  community- \nbased  ecotourism  and  village-based  tourism  projects.  Isolated \nrural  areas  will  be  further  integrated  into  the  mainstream  of \nregional  economic  and  social  development.  Properly  planned, \necotourism  development  will  reduce  rural  poverty  by  increasing \nrural  employment  and  incomes;  encouraging  the  conservation  of \nthe  natural  and  cultural  heritage;  expanding  employment \nopportunities;  and  enabling  the  poor,  women,  and  indigenous \ncommunities  to  participate  in  and  influence  development  projects \nthat  directly  bear  on  their  own  futures.  Indigenous  minorities  and \nwomen,  in  particular,  will  benefit  from  ecotourism  and  village-\nbased tourism through training as guides and managers, provision \nof food and accommodation for tourists, and from the manufacture \nand  sale  of  handicrafts.    Ethnic  minorities  will  also  increasingly \nvalue  their  own  cultures  as  tourists  and  governments  show  an \ninterest in them and their survival. Increased exposure to tourism \nwill be accompanied by a corresponding awareness of the need to \nprotect  the  physical  and  cultural  environments  from  social  and \neconomic pressures. \n \n\n\fviii \n\n \n\n \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\nThe improvement of tourism-related infrastructure will bring major \nsocial  benefits  to  residents  in  and  around  urban  areas,  local  and \ninternational  tourists,  and  the  tourism  industry.    Upgraded  roads \nwill facilitate movement of population and goods, as will improved \nairports  and  river  facilities  that  will  increase  tourist  traffic.  An \nincrease in economic activity in the three countries, with increased \nemployment  and  higher  incomes,  is  likely.  The  provision  of \nefficient  wastewater  treatment  and  sewerage  disposal  systems \nwill  similarly  improve  the  health  and  general  quality  of  life  of \nresident  populations.  The  burden  on  women  in  particular,  on \nwhom  much  childcare  and  household  activities  depend,  will  be \nrelieved  with  improved  child  health.  Better  facilities  at  border \ncrossings  will  facilitate  the  movements  for  migrant  workers  and \nlocal  tourists,  and  will  contribute to the  development  of the  wider \nregional economy. \n \nThe  Project  has  high  economic  and  financial  benefits.  Economic \ninternal rates of return range from 13.3% to 33.4%, and financial \ninternal  rates  of  return  from  2.2%  to  13.3%.  The  Project  will \ncontribute  to  increased  tourism  receipts  of  about  $129  million  in \nthe decade after implementation. \n \nThe  main  risks  associated  with  the  Project  are  (i)  delays  caused \nby the lack of experience of the EAs in managing an ADB-funded \nproject;  (ii)  delays  caused  by  the  lack  of  effective  coordination  of \nthe  national  tourism  organizations,  other  line  agencies, provincial \nauthorities,  and  consultants;  (iii)  inadequate  resources  available \nfor counterpart funding; and (iv) the poor, women, and vulnerable \nrural communities who may face negative socioeconomic impacts \nor may not benefit from increased tourism. \n \nMitigation  measures  to  address  these  issues  include  (i)  the \nestablishment  of  well-staffed  and  equipped  project  management \nand implementation units in each country and the early creation of \neffective  project  management, \nreporting,  and  coordinating \nprocedures,  as  well  as  training  of  local  staff;  (ii)  inclusion  of  cost \nrecovery mechanisms for all infrastructure subprojects, especially \nby  requiring  tourists  using  the  facilities  to  contribute  most  of  the \nrequired  funds  for  operation  and  maintenance;  (iii)  the  ministries \nof  finance  of  each  country  have  confirmed  that  ADB-financed \nprojects  will  have  high  priority \nin  budgetary  allocation  of \ncounterpart  funds;  (iv) resettlement  frameworks  and  resettlement \nplans, which have been prepared for each country; (v) preparation \nfor  each  province  of  an  ethnic  minority  participation  strategy  and \ngender  development  programs  to  protect  the  most  vulnerable \nminority  groups;  (vi) awareness  campaigns,  directed  at  tourists \nand  local  communities,  that  focus  on  the  dangers  of  drug  abuse \nand  the  health  risks  of  indiscriminate  and  commercial  sex \nactivities; and (vii) the provision of training  for the development  of \nmicro-businesses  in  areas  subject  to  tourism  expansion  and \ncapacity  building \nin  community-based \necotourism to ensure that they will benefit from increased tourism. \n\nrural  poor \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia,  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR),  and  the \nSocialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS):  Mekong  Tourism \nDevelopment Project. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n2. \nFollowing  the  request  of  the  GMS  Tourism  Sector  Working  Group,  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) approved technical assistance (TA)1 to prepare the Mekong Tourism \nDevelopment  Project.  The  TA  built  on  a  previous  ADB-supported  study.2  The  Project  covers \nthree countries in the GMS\u2013Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam (GMS participating countries, \nGMSPCs). \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n3. \nTourism is one of the world\u2019s most significant and dynamic socioeconomic sectors. The \ncombination  of  domestic  and  international  tourism  is  probably  the  world\u2019s  largest  industry.  It \ngenerates  approximately  11%  of  global  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  and  provides  direct \nemployment  to  more  than  200  million  people.  In  2001,  there  were  700  million  international \ntourist arrivals, from which about 30% went to developing countries. International tourist arrivals \nin  developing  countries  have  been  growing  at  an  average  of  9.5%  annually  since  1990, \ncompared  to  4.6%  worldwide.  Tourist  arrivals  in  the GMS  have  been  even  higher, making the \nGMS  the  fastest  growing  destination  in  the  world.  Although  international  travel  has  been \nnegatively  impacted  by  global  insecurity  over  the  past  year,  tourist  arrivals  in  the  GMS \nincreased by nearly 7.5% in 2001. Within the GMS, tourist arrivals in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and \nViet Nam have increased even more rapidly. The growth in arrivals has averaged 26% per year \nin Cambodia, 25% in Lao PDR, and 20% in Viet Nam during the last 10 years. In 2001, tourist \narrivals are estimated at 0.61 million in Cambodia, 0.67 million in the Lao PDR, and 2.23 million \nin  Viet  Nam.  Although  tourism  growth  in  the  GMSPCs  has  been  impressive,  opportunities  to \nattract  additional  visitors  to  these  countries  are  still  significant  considering  that  14.84  million \ntourists visited the GMS in 2001. \n \n4. \nTourist arrivals by itself is not an adequate indicator of the growth of the tourism industry.  \nReceipts from tourism are important. The average daily tourist spending of $55 in the GMSPCs \nis  still  low  compared  with  other  countries  of  the  region.  A  high  proportion  of  tourists  visiting \nthese  countries  are  low-budget  tourists  and  backpackers.  Further,  tourists  stay  an  average  of \njust 5 days in each country. However, despite the low average level of spending and short stay \nin the countries, the tourism sector already accounts for 9.2% of GDP in Cambodia, 9.7% in the \nLao PDR, and 6.7% in  Viet Nam. Significant opportunities exist to increase economic benefits \nfrom  tourism  by  attracting  high-spending  tourists  to  the  subregion  through  improved  tourism \nproducts,  investments  in  tourism-related  infrastructure,  a  higher  quality  of  tourist  services, \nimproved  skills  in  the  industry,  and  the  development  and  implementation  of  a  dynamic  and \nfocused marketing strategy. A key factor in increasing the economic benefits from tourism is to \nmaximize  the  number  of  days  that  tourists  stay  in  the  subregion.  This  will  be  achieved  by \ndeveloping  tourism  circuits  that  integrate  attractive  destinations  in  the  GMSPCs,  improving \n                                                 \n1  ADB.  1999.

Perhaps  the \nmost  important  asset  of  the  GMS  is  its  multiplicity  of  cultures,  unique  physical  features,  and \nvaried  flora  and  fauna  that  allow  the  promotion  of  \u201cone  subregion,  many  destinations\u201d.    A  key \nfactor in the rapid growth of tourism in the subregion is the recognition by the itinerant traveler \nthat  the  GMS  is  unique  in  its  ability  to  offer  multiple  destinations  in  a  single  holiday  package. \nCapturing this special subregional advantage will be at the heart of any strategy that seeks to \nincrease socioeconomic benefits from tourism. \n \nNotwithstanding  the  rapid  technological  advances  of  the  20th  century,  tourism  remains \n5. \nan  essentially  labor-intensive  industry.  It  has  high  potential  for  employment  generation\u2013every \nadditional  hotel  room  creates  about  two  jobs  directly  and  several  indirectly.  The  poor  gain \ndisproportionately  especially  when  tourism  depends  on  remote,  undeveloped  destinations  to \nprovide  the  diversity  in  products  and  experience  that  the  current  generation  of  tourists  are \nlooking for. New jobs in the industry go mainly to immigrants from rural areas. Many of these are \nwomen  who  work  in  hotels,  travel  agencies,  and  restaurants.  In  2001,  the  tourism  sector \nemployed  approximately  10.3%  of  the  total  population  working  in  Cambodia,  8.3%  in  the  Lao \nPDR and 5.3% in Viet Nam.   \n \n6. \nGiven  the  comparative  advantage  that  the  GMSPCs  enjoy  in  tourism,  the  sector \nprovides  one  of  the  best  opportunities  to  reduce  poverty  through  increased  foreign  exchange \nearnings,  diversified  regional  development,  broad-based  economic  growth,  expansion  of  the \nprivate  sector,  and  employment  creation.  However,  investments  in  infrastructure,  community \nawareness  and  education,  subregional  cooperation,  and  human  resources  development  are \nurgently required to ensure that tourism growth is sustained, while simultaneously protecting the \ncultural  and  environmental  heritage  of  the  countries  in  the  lower  Mekong  River  basin.  Public \nsector  investments  in  tourism  will  also  provide  a  much-needed  opportunity  to  involve  local \ncommunities  in  planning,  managing,  developing,  and  protecting  tourism  destinations.  The \nsector\u2019s competitiveness will increase with the development of a larger number of diverse, high-\nquality tourism products that will enable a more equitable distribution of tourism benefits to the \npeople, especially the poor. The project framework is presented in Appendix 1. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n7. \nThe  GMS  Tourism  Sector.  From  the ski  resorts  of  Yunnan  in  the  north to  the  pristine \ntropical  beaches  of  the  Mekong  delta  in  the  south,  the  GMS  offers  the  prospective  traveler  a \nstaggering wealth of opportunities and choice.  This includes six distinct cultures and 12 world \nheritage sites. The Mekong River is an evocative icon of the subregion. It is a unifying theme in \nan  otherwise  diverse  land,  and  along  its  2,400-kilometer  lower  basin  course  from  Louang \nNamtha  in  the  northern  Lao  PDR  to  My  Tho  in  the  Mekong  delta  in  Viet  Nam  it  provides  a \nunique  ribbon  for  the  development  of  tourism  circuits  across  the  subregion.  The  project  area \nintegrates spectacular architecture and pristine natural environments with traditional ways of life \nand rich cultural and religious destinations. All subprojects are along the Mekong River or will be \nclosely  connected  to the  river. The  Project  will  provide  an  excellent  opportunity for  developing \nalong  the  lower  basin  of  Mekong  River  a  circuit  that  integrates  all  the  tourist  destinations  in  a \nsingle package. \n \n8. \nThe GMSPCs have opened their tourist attractions to the rest of the world mainly in the \nlast  decade.  While  the  subregion  has  increased  and  improved  its  linkages  by  air,  land,  and \nwater,  with  the  rest  of  the  world  and  within  the  region,  much  remains  to  be  done  to  improve \naccess,  create  and  effectively  market  tourism  products,  improve  quality, and  enhance  skills  to \n\n\f \n \n\n3\n\nmanage an expanded tourism industry. A description of the GMS tourism sector and its recent \ndevelopment is provided in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n9. \nThe  GMS  Program.  The  formal  framework  for  the  initiation  and  elaboration  of  tourism \nsector  policies  and  plans  on  a  subregional  basis  is  the  multisectoral  GMS  Economic \nCooperation  Program  (the  GMS  program)  established  by  ADB  in  1992.  The  broad  policy \nobjectives of the program are the promotion of economic growth and the delivery of better lives \nfor  all  through  recognition  of  the  importance  of  subregional  economic  cooperation.  From  its \ninception, the GMS program has emphasized practical results through a wide range of specific \nprojects, principally in infrastructure. More recently, the importance of placing greater emphasis \non  measures  to  reduce  nonphysical  barriers  to  trade  and  investment  has  gained  recognition. \nHowever, a fundamental achievement of the first decade of the program has been the building \nof  trust  and  confidence  among  member  countries.  With  this  foundation,  a  number  of  specific \nprograms  have  been  initiated  on  a  cooperative  basis.  Detailed  information  on  tourism-related \nassistance to the GMS is presented in Appendix 2. \n \nGMS Tourism Cooperation. Tourism is one of the eight priority sectors of cooperation \n10. \nwithin  the  GMS  program  and  has  been  included  as  the  11th  \u201cflagship\u201d  program  under  the  10-\nyear GMS Program Strategic Framework. A working group comprising senior representatives of \nthe  national  tourism  organizations  (NTOs)  was  established  in  1993  and  implements  agreed \nprograms  and  projects  aimed  mainly  at  promoting  the  GMS  as  a  unique  tourism  destination. \nIndeed,  the  Tourism  Sector  Working  Group  (TWG)  has  established  its  own  permanent \nsecretariat  to  coordinate  the  plans  to  develop  and  promote  the  subregion  as  a  tourism \ndestination.    This  permanent  secretariat  is  the  Agency  for  Coordinating  Mekong  Tourism \nActivities (AMTA), established on 1 January 1997 within the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) \nin Bangkok. \n  \nThe  GMS  tourism  cooperation  program  commenced  in  1993.  The  13th  Meeting  of  the \n11. \nTWG took place in 2002. The TWG is supported by the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA), \nthe  United  Nations  Economic  and  Social  Commission  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific  (ESCAP),  and \nADB.  Its  meetings  are  often  attended  by  representatives  of  the  United  Nations  Education, \nScientific  and  Cultural  Organization  (UNESCO)  and  the  World  Tourism  Organization  (WTO). \nADB and ESCAP support the working group, finance meetings selectively, and provide TA for \nstudies  and  capacity  building  activities.  PATA  supports  AMTA  in  its  marketing  functions. \nUNESCO provides TA on conservation- related issues. It is also supporting the implementation \nof the award-winning Nam Ha eco-tourism project in Louang Namtha Province in the Lao PDR. \nWTO  liaises  with  other  agencies  and  identifies  funding  for  various  schemes.  The  program  is \ntruly collaborative and impressive gains have been made in profiling tourism in the GMS.   \n \n12. \nThe  Mekong  Tourism  Forum  was  set  up  by  the  Third  Conference  on  Sub  Regional \nCooperation  in  April  1994  with  two  main  objectives:  (i)  to  provide  a  platform  for  public  and \nprivate sectors of the GMS countries to address subregional tourism issues, and (ii) to raise the \nprofile  of  the  GMS  as  a  tourist  destination.  The  forum  has  convened  seven  times  since  1996 \nand is today a major annual tourism event in the Asia and Pacific region. It is led mainly by the \nprivate sector through PATA. \n \n13. \nThe TWG promotes the subregion as a single tourist destination. The TWG\u2019s marketing \nactivities are coordinated by AMTA. PATA facilitates the identification of marketing opportunities \nfor the GMS countries. It also supports GMS tourism marketing selectively. AMTA, on behalf of \nthe  TWG,  has  (i)  prepared  a  GMS  tourist  map,  (ii) organized  GMS  tourism  booths  in  major \n\n\f 4\n\ntourism events, (iii) established a GMS tourism website, and (iv) produced tourism promotional \nmaterials. The GMS Tourism Marketing Fund has also been established. \n \n14. \nNational  Tourism  Plans  and  Strategies.  The  GMSPCs  have  recently  completed \nnational  tourism  plans.  A  national  tourism  development  plan  for  the  Lao  PDR,  funded  by  the \nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and WTO, was completed in November 1998. \nThis  was  supplemented  in  August  1999  by  a  national  tourism  marketing  plan,  also  funded  by \nUNDP  and  WTO.    Both  plans  are  designed  to  cover  15  year  time  frames,  from  1999/2000. \nCambodia,  too,  has  a  national  tourism  development  plan  up  to  2005,  prepared  with  ADB \nsupport.3  In  1998,  with  the  assistance  of  TAT,  Ministry  of  Tourism  (MOT)  prepared  a  master \nplan for tourism development in Rattanak Kiri and Mondol Kiri provinces in Cambodia. Currently, \nthree regional tourism planning studies are being conducted in Siem Reap Province and along \nthe southern coastal provinces of Cambodia by the Singapore Tourism Promotion Board, TAT, \nand the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). Viet Nam has a revised 10 year master \nplan  for  sustainable  tourism  development  prepared  in  2001  with  UNDP  and  WTO  assistance. \nThe  individual  country  plans  take  into  account  the  synergies  available  through  collaborative \ntourism planning and marketing at the subregional level. \n \n15. \nAt the subregional level, the Mekong-Lancang River Tourism Planning study funded by \nADB4 and completed in 1998 has been the foundation of overall GMS tourism sector planning. \nThe study provided an initial assessment of the potential for tourism cooperation to develop the \nMekong River as a unifying, central tourism attraction. What is needed, however, is an overall \nGMS  tourism-planning  framework  to  guide  tourism  development  in  the  subregion  in  the  long \nterm. The objective is to optimize the mutually reinforcing country complementarities and obtain \nhigh, sustainable growth levels in the GMS. The Project will support the preparation of a GMS \ntourism plan building on this previous study. \n \n16. \nTourist  infrastructure  needs  urgent  attention  to  sustain  existing  levels  of  arrivals  and \ncater to growth. Road network planning has paid little attention to tourist needs. Airports need \nupgrading to meet the growth in tourist traffic as does river transport infrastructure, especially in \nthe  lower  Mekong  River  basin.  Many  of  the  tourist  destinations  included  in  the  Project  are \ndifficult  to  reach,  and  become  actually  inaccessible  during  certain  periods  of  the  year.  The \nobjective  is  to  facilitate  access  to  tourist  destinations,  generally  using  the  Mekong  River  as  a \nconnecting  link  between  sites,  and  increase  the  reliability,  safety,  and  comfort  of  transport \nservices  so  as  to  increase  the  volume  of  tourists  and  attract  the  high  spenders.  The  need  for \ninvestments  in  infrastructure  is  further  underscored  by  the  rapid  growth  and  concentration  of \nlarge  numbers  of  tourists  in  particular  destinations.  These  destinations  lack  infrastructure \nfacilities  and  this  is  damaging  the  environment  of  the  sites  and  increasing  health  risks  for \ntourists  and  local  people.  Investment  in  sewerage,  wastewater  treatment,  and  solid  waste \ninfrastructure  and  management  systems  is  urgently  required  to  ensure  the  economic  and \nenvironmental sustainability of these destinations. \n \n17. \nThe  infrastructure  improvement  subprojects  have  been  selected  on  rigorous  criteria, \nincluding (i) determination of the subproject as a high priority investment for the development of \ninternational  tourism  at  national  and  subregional  levels  and  endorsement  by  the  government \nconcerned;  (ii)  the  number  of  tourists  visiting  the  selected  destinations  has  been  increasing \nsignificantly in recent years showing a high demand for that particular destination; (iii) significant \n\n                                                 \n3   ADB. 2000.

However, it also can damage the physical and cultural environment. GMS tourism \nis  beginning  to  show  evidence  of  uncontrolled  tourism  development  without  appropriate \nplanning, management, and participation of local communities that could lead to the destruction \nof  cultural  traditions  and  natural  habitats.  Urgent  measures  need  to  be  taken  by  national  and \nprovincial  governments,  the  private  sector,  and  local  populations  to  educate  tourists  and  train \nlocal  communities  to  manage  tourism  increases,  particularly  in  fragile  cultural  or  physical \nenvironments.  A  community-based  tourism  development  program  needs  to  be  developed  and \nimplemented  to  ensure  that  the  poor  and  vulnerable,  particularly  indigenous  peoples,  women, \nand  isolated  communities  in  rural  areas,  are  not  negatively  affected  by  tourism  development, \nand  increase  their  capacity  to  benefit  from  a  growing  tourism  sector.  Properly  planned  and \nmanaged  ecotourism  and  village-based  tourism  development  will  provide  a  complementary \nsource  of  income  to  the  rural  poor,  increase  awareness  about  the  value  of  their  own  cultural \nheritage  and  natural  environment,  and  form  the  basis  for  sustainable  poverty  reduction  and \nenvironmental  protection  in  the  areas  visited  by  the  tourists.  Equally,  policies  need  to  be \ndesigned that  inhibit  the  leakage  of  benefits from  increased  tourism  outside  the GMSPCs  and \nprevent their uneven distribution.          \n \nThe  rationale  for  a  subregional  tourism  development  project  derives  from  the  crucial \n19. \nrecognition that development of a sustainable tourism sector in each GMSPCs in isolation from \nothers will become increasingly difficult in the highly competitive world tourism market. Individual \ncountry  attractions  will  only  be  sustained  in  a  multicountry  context.  Many  travelers  to  the \nGMSPCs  are  no  longer  visiting  just  one  or  two  of  the  GMSPCs  but  all  three.  Among  the \nGMSPCs,  border  crossings  remain  difficult  and  costly  due  to  visa  requirements.  This  is  a  key \ndeterrent  to  tourism  development.  The  inability  to  acquire  visas  on  arrival  at  most  of  the \ninternational border checkpoints in the GMSPCs is an important obstacle for the development of \ntourism.  The  promotion  of  the  GMS  as  a  single  destination,  development  of  joint  circuits  and \nproducts  across  countries  within  the  subregion,  harmonization  of  hotel  classification  systems, \nincreased  participation  of  the  private  sector  through  establishment  of  tourism  marketing  and \npromotion boards, and facilitation of the movement of tourists across borders, will increase the \nattractiveness  of  individual  destinations  and  countries,  foster  synergies  across  borders,  and \nprovide new opportunities for sector development   \n \n20. \nLessons  Learned.  Some  major  lessons  with  regard  to  sustainable  tourism  sector \ntimely  project \ndevelopment, \nimplementation  have  been  learned  from  ADB  interventions  in  other  countries.  Key  lessons \ninclude  the  following:  (i) community  involvement  in  design  and  implementation  can  enhance \n\nincluding  community-based \n\nrural  areas,  and \n\ntourism \n\nin \n\n\f 6\n\nsubsequent operations, but such involvement may cost more and cause implementation delays; \n(ii) a clear view of the type of service to be provided is needed when designing facilities such as \ntourism information centers; (iii) the private sector will not automatically respond to the opening \nof new tourists sites and such sites should be actively marketed; (iv) the private sector should \nhave a role in the design of tourist sites to ensure that they are practical from a tour operator\u2019s \nperspective;  (v)  ecotourism  can  work,  but  facilities  need  to  be  carefully  assessed;  (vi)  where \nthere  are  many  inexperienced  implementing  agencies,  the  early  and  complete  formation  of  a \nproject  management  unit  is  needed  to  avoid  delays  and  other  problems;  and  (vii)  monitoring \nrequires specific attention from project supervisors at an early stage of implementation.   \n \n21. \nSome  major  lessons  with  regard  to  tourism  related  infrastructure,  including  urban \nsewerage  systems,  airports,  piers,  and  roads  are  related  to  cost  recovery  mechanisms,  and \nfunding  for  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M).  Arrangements  to  generate  adequate  financial \nresources for project O&M should be identified and discussed with government agencies during \nproject preparation. These lessons have been factored into the design of the Project. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nObjective \n\nincreasing \n\ntourism  development \n\nforeign  exchange  earnings,  and  promoting \n\nThe  Project\u2019s  goal  is  to  reduce  poverty  through  increasing  economic  growth  and \n22. \nemployment  opportunities, \nthe \nconservation  of  the  natural  and  cultural  heritage.  The  specific  objective  of  the  Project  is  to \npromote  sustainable \nthrough \nin \ninfrastructure  improvements,  increased  community  and  private  sector  participation,  and \nsubregional  cooperation.  The  Project  is  targeted  to  improve  high  priority  tourism-related \ninfrastructure  in  the  lower  Mekong  basin;  promote  pro-poor,  community-based,  sustainable \ntourism  in  rural  areas;  and  strengthen  subregional  cooperation.  It  will  mitigate  environmental \ndegradation  from  unplanned  and  unsustainable  development,  develop  human  resources,  and \npromote  cooperation  between  the  private  and  public  sectors  within  the  subregion  through  the \nestablishment of tourism marketing and promotion boards (TMPBs). \n \nB. \n\nlower  Mekong  River  basin \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nthe \n\n23. \nThe Project will comprise four parts: part A, tourism-related infrastructure improvements; \npart  B,  pro-poor,  community-based,  tourism  development;  part  C,  subregional  cooperation  for \nsustainable  tourism;  and  part  D,  implementation  assistance  and  institutional  strengthening.  A \ndetailed description of the components is presented in Appendix 3. \n \n24. \nPart  A  includes  (i)  urban  environmental  improvements  (Siem  Reap  in  Cambodia,  and \nSam Mountain in An Giang Province and My Tho in Tien Giang Province in Viet Nam); (ii) small \nairports  extension  and  rehabilitation  (Louang  Namtha  in  the  Lao  PDR  and  Rattanak  Kiri  and \nStung Treng  in  Cambodia);  (iii) access  roads  improvement  (road to  the  Genocide  Memorial  in \nCambodia and roads to Kwangsi Falls and Konglor cave in the Lao PDR); and (iv) river tourism \npiers development (My Tho in Tien Giang Province and An Giang Province in Viet Nam). \n \n25. \nPart  B  includes  10  components:  (i)  an  institutional  strengthening  and  community \nparticipation program; (ii) an awareness program on tourism benefits and negative impacts, and \nenvironmental  and  cultural  conservation;  (iii) pro-poor  tourism  products  identification  and \ndevelopment;  (iv)  small-scale  tourism-related  infrastructure  (tourism  information  centers, \ncommunity lodges, small river piers, viewing points, and walking trails); (v) capacity building for \n\n\f \n \n\n7\n\ntourism-related  local  microenterprises  and  communities;  (vi) a  gender  development  program; \n(vii)  an  ethnic  minorities  participation  program  (this  component  not  applicable  in  Viet  Nam); \n(viii) a marketing and promotion plan; (ix) promotion of community-based tourism networks and \necotourism  stakeholder  associations;  and  (x)  a  system  of  monitoring  project  outputs  and \nimpacts. Part B will be implemented in two provinces in Cambodia (Stung Treng and Rattanak \nKiri),  four  provinces  in  the  Lao  PDR  (Louang  Namtha,  Louang  Phrabang,  Khammouan,  and \nChampassak), and two provinces in Viet Nam (An Giang and Tien Giang). \n \nPart  C  includes  seven  components:  (i)  a  GMS  facility  for  tourism  cooperation; \n26. \n(ii) improvement  of  tourism  facilities  at  border  posts;  (iii)  establishment  of  a  GMS  network  of \nTMPBs; (iv) a standardized GMS hotel classification system; (v) a GMS tourism plan; (vi) GMS \ntourism  statistics \nimprovement  and  harmonization;  (vii) diversification  of  AMTA  human \nresources; and (viii) GMS tourism human resource development.  \n \n27. \nPart  D  includes  (i)  consulting  services  for  project  management  support,  tourism \ndevelopment  and  subregional  cooperation,  detailed  design  and  construction  supervision  of \ntourism-related  infrastructure,  and  pro-poor  community-based  tourism  development;  and \n(ii) incremental administration costs and project administration equipment. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n28. \nSubregional  Cooperation.  The  GMS  program  identifies  projects  and  institutional \nmechanisms that  will  enhance  economic  and  social  integration. The  development  of  the  GMS \nas  a  unified  tourism  destination  will  increase  the  international  attractiveness  of  the  subregion. \nThe  Project  will  enhance  subregional  cooperation  and  increase  economic  integration  of  the \nsubregion  by  facilitating  the  movement  of  tourists,  increasing  the  attractiveness  of  key \nsubregional  tourism  destinations,  and  promoting  common  approaches  to  community-based \necotourism  activities  in  the  GMS,  hotel  classification  systems,  private  sector  participation,  and \nplanning. Particularly, the GMS facility for tourism cooperation will facilitate the implementation \nof the bilateral agreements that were on hold due to lack of funding by supporting cross-border \nprojects  involving  at  least  two  of  the  three  participating  countries  or  alternatively,  one  of  the \nthree and another GMS country not included in the Project. The facility could fund (i) studies to \nprepare circuits and assess demand, (ii) building of small infrastructure to improve the circuits, \n(iii) a marketing program for the circuits, (iv) a system for monitoring economic benefits for each \ncountry,  and  (v)  meetings  and  seminars  to  promote  cooperation  of  the  private  sector  on  both \nsides of the border. The Project will also support upgrading of tourism and immigration facilities \nat  border  checkpoints  within  the  GMS  and  expanding  the  points  where  visas  on  arrival  are \nprovided. \n \n29. \nAll subprojects identified are either on the Mekong River or will have easy access from \nthe river due to the Project. The improvement of infrastructure in the selected subprojects and \nthe  provision  of  visas  on  arrival  at  the  border  checkpoints  will  help  tour  operators  prepare \ncircuits along the river that could integrate some or all the subprojects included in the Project. \nThe Project will complement other GMS projects supported by ADB, particularly the economic \ncorridors, including the northern section of the East-West Corridor along road number 8 in Viet \nNam5  from  which  the  access  road  to  Konglor  Cave  will  be  constructed,  and  the  southern \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB.  1999.

The Project will involve three separate loans, one for each \nof  the  GMSPCs.  Separate  loan  agreements  will  be  signed  with  each  of  the  three  borrowers. \nDetailed  project  management  mechanisms  have  been  included  in  the  Project  to  ensure \ncoordination  among  the  GMSPCs  during  implementation.  AMTA  will  also  support  the \ncoordination of the Project as secretariat to the subregional steering committee and will link the \nProject with other GMS countries that are not participating. The chairmanship of the subregional \nsteering committee will rotate among the GMSPCs. \n  \n31. \nCost  Recovery  Mechanisms  and  Financial  Sustainability.  The  Project  will  include \ncost  recovery  mechanisms  for  most  of  the  tourism-related  infrastructure  subprojects.  A \nsubstantial  portion  of  the  Project\u2019s  capital  and  O&M  costs  will  be  recovered  though  charges, \nlevies,  and  taxes  on  the  tourists  using the  improved  facilities.  Small  charges  on  local  users  of \nthe  facilities  are  also  included  in  the  Project.  However,  significant  contributions  from \ninternational tourists will ensure that charges to local users, including the poor, are affordable. \nFinancial  analyses  have  been  undertaken  for  all  infrastructure  subprojects  with  cost  recovery \npossibilities  to  ensure  that  each  subproject  generates  sufficient  revenue  to  cover  O&M  costs \nand, in most cases, capital costs, and with a rate of return that meets or exceeds the weighted \naverage cost of capital. Subsidies from government budgets will not be required.  \n \nPrivate  Sector  Participation.  The  Project  will  promote  private  sector  participation  in \n32. \nmarket research, planning, and tourism marketing and promotion through initial support for the \nestablishment  of  TMPBs  in  Cambodia,  Lao  PDR,  and  Viet  Nam.  TMPBs  will  have  leadership \nfrom  the  private  sector  and  will  mainly  be  financed  from  contributions  from  the  private  sector. \nThe TMPBs will promote dialogue between the private and public sectors; expand opportunities \nfor coordination in the development of plans, strategies, legislation, and marketing; and increase \nthe efficiency and international competitiveness of the tourism sector in each country and in the \nsubregion. The Project will also promote the establishment of micro and small tourist enterprises \nin  rural  areas,  through  the  pro-poor  community-based  component.  Capacity  building,  for \ncommunities  and  small  entrepreneurs  involved  in  the  tourism  industry,  will  be  provided  under \nthe Project.     \n \nPoverty.  The  Project  has  been  classified  as  a  poverty  intervention  following  the \n33. \ngeographical classification criteria.  Substantial benefits will accrue to the poor and opportunities \nto reduce poverty will be created by the Project through increased employment and economic \ngrowth. About 39.8% of the population in the Project area are poor, including 42.8% in the Lao \nPDR, 38.5% in Cambodia, and 34.5% in Viet Nam. About 90% of the poor in the GMSPCs are \nin  the  rural  areas.  The  pro-poor,  community-based  tourism  component  of  the  Project  will \nparticularly benefit the poor in the rural areas in some of the poorest provinces in the subregion. \nThe  improvement  of  environmental  conditions  in  the  urban  areas  of  Siem  Reap  in  Cambodia \nand  Sam  Mountain  and  Tien  Giang  in  Viet  Nam  will  consolidate  the  tourism  sector  in  those \nareas,  increase  employment  opportunities  for  the  poor  in  those  areas,  and  help  improve  the \nquality of life for the urban poor. The upgrading of airports in some of the most isolated areas of \n\n                                                 \n6   ADB.  1998.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  Proposed  Loans  to \nCambodia and Viet Nam for the Greater Mekong Subregion:  Phnom Penh to Ho Chi Minh City Highway Project. \nManila. \n\n\f \n \n\n9\n\nCambodia and Lao PDR will attract new tourists and increase the possibilities for the poor to be \nemployed  and  to  sell  their  local  products  at  a  higher  price.  Improved  access  to  tourist \ndestinations  by  air,  land,  and  water  will  attract  more  tourists  to  isolated  areas  where  poverty \nlevels are high. The pro-poor, community-based tourism components will help poor communities \nenhance their capacities to use the opportunities created by tourism development. The Project\u2019s \npro-poor tourism development activities are expected to improve incomes of poor beneficiaries \nby  at  least  25%.  These  estimates  are  based  on  studies  of  the  economic  impacts  of  the \nUNESCO-supported Nam Ha Eco-tourism Project in the Lao PDR,  which has been used as a \nmodel for the development of part B of the Project. Studies in October 2001 demonstrate that, at \nthe  village  level,  approximately  42%  of  all  income  was  from  ecotourism.  Activities  from  which \nsuch incomes were derived include sale of nontimber forest produce, food preparation and sale, \nhandicraft sales, and services to tourists including guiding and traditional massage. As a result \nof the increases in individual household incomes as well as village funds, overall improvements \nin  the  food  security  of  participating  communities  are  expected.  Village  funds  will  enable  the \ncreation  of  rice  banks  from  which  poor  households  can  borrow  and  pay  back  in  better  times. \nVillage  funds  can  be  used  to  develop  village  infrastructure  such  as  tracks  and  schools. \nIndividual  households  will  benefit  by  improving  their  food  consumption;  access  to  clothes, \nblankets,  and  medicines;  investment  in  agricultural  equipment  and  tools;  and  household \nsavings.  A  summary  poverty  and  social  analysis  is  presented  in  Appendix  4;  a  more  detailed \nsocial and poverty analysis is presented in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n34. \nGender.  The  tourism  industry  is  particularly  important  for  women.  The  percentage  of \nwomen  employed  in  restaurants,  hotels,  and  other  tourism  services  is  higher  than  in  the \naverage  general  workforce.7  The  Project  will  particularly  benefit  women  through  increased \nemployment  opportunities  in  the  tourism  sector.  The  participation  of  the  national  women\u2019s \norganizations  machineries  (Ministry  of  Women  and  Veteran\u2019s  Affairs  in  Cambodia,  Vietnam \nWomen\u2019s Union, and Lao Women\u2019s Union) in the national steering committees is important. This \nwill  help  to  ensure  that  the  implementation  of  gender  and  development  (GAD)  plans  is \neffectively  monitored,  and  GAD  issues  are  mainstreamed  in  tourism  development.  At  the \nprovincial level, a subproject gender action plan will be prepared by the project implementation \nunit  (PIU)  with  the  help  of  social  advisers  and  the  community-based  tourism  development \nadvisers.  These  plans  will  be  in  keeping  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  and  Development. \nThey  will  reflect  all  activities  related  to  promoting  women\u2019s  equitable  participation  in  tourism \ndevelopment  and  its  benefits,  to  be  implemented  in  a  time-bound  manner.  All  plans  will  set \ntargets.  Generic  principles  that  will  form  the  basis  of  subproject-level  gender  planning  are:  \n(i) under part B of the Project, 50% of all trainees in all training programs will be women; (ii) at \nleast  40%  membership  in  ecotourism  associations  at  all  levels  will  be  recruited  to  implement \npro-poor,  community-based  tourism  activities;  (iii) such  women  staff  will  be  trained  and  will,  in \nturn,  help  develop  provincial  GAD  action  plans,  with  targets  that  can  be  monitored;  (iv)  in \nkeeping with such action plans, women staff will (a) provide training to participating communities \nin GAD issues related to tourism; (b) help disseminate tourism-related skills particularly among \nrural  women,  and  in  association  with  the  local  women\u2019s  machinery;  (c)  build  strong  village-\nbased  women\u2019s  groups  for  participation  in  ecotourism  stakeholder  associations  and  informed \ndecision  making;  (d)  under  the  guidance  of  the  social  and  gender  advisers,  community-based \ntourism advisers, and participating NGOs, help develop training and education programs related \nto  health  risks  of  HIV/AIDS8  and  sexually-transmitted  diseases;  (e)  design  and  implement \nawareness and training programs and workshops for government agencies, the private sector, \n\n                                                 \n7   United Nations Development Programme-United Kingdom. 1999.

A social impact assessment identified subprojects that would involve land \nacquisition  and  resettlement.  A  total  of  231  households  (approximately  1,155  persons)  will  be \nsignificantly affected and will have to relocate to nearby sites. Of these, the main impacts will be \nfrom  improvements  to  two  airports\u2013Louang  Namtha  in  the  Lao  PDR,  and  Rattanak  Kiri  in \nCambodia\u2013for  which  resettlement  plans  have  been  prepared.  There  will  also  be  marginal \nimpacts  on  18  households  from  subprojects  for  which  short  resettlement  plans  have  been \nprepared, and lesser marginal impacts from the remaining subprojects that will be covered by a \nresettlement  framework.  A  table  showing  the  significance  of  resettlement  for  each  subproject, \nthe type of resettlement planning documentation required for each, and a summary resettlement \nframework for the Lao PDR is presented in Appendix 5. Summary resettlement frameworks for \nCambodia  and  Viet  Nam,  and  full  resettlement  frameworks  for  the  GMSPCs  are  provided  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  C.  The  resettlement  frameworks  are  intended  to  guide  resettlement \nplanning for other subprojects that may involve minor involuntary resettlement and for which the \nzone  of  impact  cannot  be  determined  before  appraisal  due  to  lack  of  detailed  design  and  the \nneed for a community participation process, such as in the pro-poor, community-based tourism \nsubprojects.  Following  detailed  design  of \nremaining  subprojects  during  project \nimplementation,  resettlement  plans,  using  the  agreed  upon  resettlement  framework,  will  be \nprepared as required and submitted to ADB for approval prior to implementation. \n \n36. \nDuring  project  preparation,  four  resettlement  plans  were  prepared  for  the  core \nsubprojects  that  will  be  implemented  during  the  first  year  of  the  Project,  as  well  as  a \nresettlement  framework  for  each  country,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement and the Handbook on Resettlement.  The resettlement plans are also provided in \nSupplementary  Appendix  C.  As  the  proposed  executing  agencies  (EAs)  are  not  completely \nfamiliar with implementing land acquisition and resettlement to ADB standards, the construction \nsupervision  consultants  will  be  required  to  provide  resettlement  capacity  building  to  these \nagencies and to external monitoring agencies.  As the GMSPCs have, or are in the process of \npreparing,  draft  national  resettlement  policies  with  ADB  assistance,  the  Project  will  encourage \nand support those efforts. \n \n37. \nEnvironment.  The  Project  is  classified  as  environment  category  B.  Several  of  the \nproposed  infrastructure  subprojects  (i.e.,  waste  treatment,  boat  jetty,  and  road  rehabilitation) \nmay  have  some  negative  environmental  impacts  arising  from  construction  and  operation. \nHowever,  the  potential  negative  impacts  can  be  mitigated  to  acceptable  levels  through \nappropriate  design  and  implementation  of  mitigation  measures  included  in  the  subprojects  in \nline with ADB\u2019s environmental requirements and those applicable at the national and provincial \nlevels in each GMSPCs.  \n \n38. \nThe  governments  of  the  GMSPCs  have  assured  ADB  that  an  initial  environmental \nexamination  (IEE)  will  be  prepared  for  each  subproject  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines, \nand that a determination will be made as to whether the subproject is environmentally sensitive. \nIf  it  is,  the  IEE  will  be  amplified  to  address  any  significant  environmental  concerns,  and  if  the \nconcerns are extensive, an environmental impact assessment will be prepared and reviewed by \nADB  prior  to  the  approval  of  the  subproject. To  ensure  that  ADB\u2019s  environmental  assessment \nrequirements are met during implementation of the Project, an environmental management plan \n(EMP) for the Project and four sample IEEs were prepared. The sample IEEs are for (i) Louang \nNamtha airport improvement in the Lao PDR, (ii) My Tho tourist river pier improvement in Viet \nNam,  (iii)  access  road  improvement  to  Konglor  cave  in  the  Lao  PDR,  and  (iv)  Siem  Reap \n\n\f \n \n\n11\n\nenvironmental improvement in Cambodia. A summary IEE, including an EMP, and three sample \nIEE  are  presented  in  Supplementary  Appendix  D.  The  summary  IEE  for  the  environmental \nimprovement subproject in Siem Reap is presented in Appendix 6.    \n \nTo support the EAs and implementing agencies (IAs) in the GMSPCs in preparing IEEs \n39. \nfor  other  subprojects  and  to  implement  the  EMP,  at  least  one  environment  specialist  will  be \nplaced at each project coordination unit (PCU) at the national level. The specialist staff will also \nhelp  ensure  that  all  applicable  national  and  provincial  environmental  laws,  regulations,  and \nstandards, as well as ADB\u2019s environmental requirements, will be met during implementation and \noperation  of  the  project  components.  An  environment  unit  will  be  established  for  each  of  the \nenvironmental improvement subprojects in Tien Giang and Sam Mountain in An Giang Province \nin  Viet  Nam,  and  Siem  Reap  in  Cambodia,  to  ensure  that  proposed  mitigation  measures \nidentified in the IEEs are incorporated in the design, construction, and operation stages of the \nProject. Environmental measures, on which action needs to be taken by the contractors, will be \nincorporated in the contracts for civil works. Implementation of the EMP and proposed mitigation \nmeasures  will  be  monitored  during  construction  and  operation.  Monitoring  results  will  be \nreported  in  the  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project  implementation  and  annual  reports  on \nenvironmental monitoring. \n \n40. \nEthnic Minorities. The pro-poor community-based tourism part of the Project has been \nprepared based on positive ecotourism pilot projects in the GMS that have particularly benefited \nethnic minorities. An ethnic minorities participation program will be prepared for each province in \nthe Lao PDR and the provinces of Stung Treng and Rattanak Kiri in Cambodia to ensure that \nthese groups enjoy the benefits of tourism, while any potential negative impact from tourism will \nbe mitigated through training and awareness programs in each province.  \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project,  including  physical  and  price  contingencies,  duties,  taxes, \n41. \nand interest during construction, is estimated at $47.1 million equivalent. The foreign exchange \ncost is $30.2 million, or 64.1% of the total. The local currency cost, including duties and taxes, is \n$16.9 million equivalent, or 35.9% of the total. The project cost for the Cambodia component is \n$20.7  million  equivalent,  comprising  a  foreign  exchange  cost  of  $13.0  million  (about  62.8%  of \nthe project cost) and a local currency cost of $7.7 million equivalent (about 37.2% of the project \ncost).  The  project  cost  for  the  Lao  PDR  component  is  $14.2  million  equivalent,  comprising  a \nforeign exchange cost of $9.3 million (about 65.5% of the project cost) and a local currency cost \nof  $4.9 million  equivalent  (about  35.5%  of  the  project  cost). The  project cost for the  Viet  Nam \ncomponent is $12.2 million equivalent, comprising a foreign exchange cost of $7.9 million (about \n64.8% of the project cost) and a local currency cost of $4.3 million equivalent (about 35.2% of \nthe  project  cost).  Cost  estimates  for  each  country  are  presented  in  Appendix  7.  Detailed  cost \nestimates are available in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n \nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nThe  proposed  ADB  loans  will  be  $15.6  million  equivalent  for  Cambodia,  $10.9  million \n42. \nequivalent  for  Lao  PDR,  and  $8.5  million  equivalent  for  Viet  Nam.  The  loans,  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources, will have a repayment period of 32 years, including a grace period of \n8  years,  with  an  interest  charge  of  1.0%  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  during  the \namortization  period.  The  borrowers  will  be  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia,  the  Lao  PDR,  and  the \nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam. The proceeds of the proposed ADB loans will finance the entire \n\n\f 12\n\nforeign  exchange  costs  and  part  of  the  local  currency  costs  of  the  three  components.  The \nGovernments will bear the exchange risk and transfer the loan proceeds to the EAs and IAs. \n\n \nTable 1: Summary of Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nForeign Cost\n\nTotal\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n  \n\n \n \n\nPart \n\n  \n  \n  \n\nTotal \n\n1.

The  arrangements are  seemingly \ncomplex but in fact rely mainly upon existing institutions and bodies. The EAs for the Project will \nbe  the  national  tourism  organizations  (NTOs)  in  each  country:  the  Ministry  of  Tourism  for \nCambodia,  the  National  Tourism  Authority  of  the  Lao  PDR,  and  the  Vietnam  National \nAdministration of Tourism (VNAT). In Viet Nam, the provincial people\u2019s committee (PPCs) of An \nGiang and Tien Giang provinces will be the EAs for part A of the Project. A subregional project \nsteering committee (SRPSC) with chairpersons of the NTOs of Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet \nNam will be established to oversee overall project implementation at the subregional level, and \nthe  subregional  cooperation  component  in  particular.  AMTA  will  act  as  a  secretariat  of  the \n\n\f \n \n\n13\n\nSRPSC. At the national level, national project steering committees will provide policy advice and \nguidance, and will oversee the general direction of the Project in each country. The committees, \nto  be  chaired  by  a  senior  representative  of  the  NTOs,  will  consist  of  representatives  from \nministries and provincial authorities involved in the Project. These arrangements are expected \ntourism \nto  provide  effective \ndevelopment in general. \n \n\nlinks  between  government  agencies  for  collaborating  on \n\n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nPercentage\n\n13.0  \n0.0  \n13.0  \n \n9.3  \n0.0  \n9.3  \n \n7.9  \n0.0  \n7.9  \n \n30.2  \n0.0  \n30.2  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.6 \n5.1 \n7.7 \n \n1.6 \n3.3 \n4.9 \n \n0.6 \n3.7 \n4.3 \n \n4.8 \n12.1 \n16.9 \n\n15.6 \n5.1 \n20.7 \n \n10.9 \n3.3 \n14.2 \n \n8.5 \n3.7 \n12.2 \n \n35.0 \n12.1 \n47.1 \n\n75.4%\n24.6%\n100.0%\n\n76.8%\n23.2%\n100.0%\n\n69.7%\n30.3%\n100.0%\n\n74.3%\n25.7%\n100.0%\n\nSource \n\nTotal \n\n \nCambodia \nADB \nGovernment \n \nLao PDR \nADB \nGovernment \n \nViet Nam \nADB \nGovernment \n \nOverall Project \nADB \nGovernments \nTotal \n \n\nTotal \n\nTotal \n\n        ADB = Asian Development Bank, Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \n        Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n \n \n \n44. \nThe  EAs  will  be  supported  by  IAs  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  infrastructure \nimprovement projects. The IAs in Cambodia will be the Ministry of Public Works and Transport, \nState Secretariat of Civil Aviation, and Municipality  of Phnom Penh (MPP). In the Lao PDR, the \nIAs  will  be  the  division  of  communications,  transport,  posts  and  construction  of  Louang \nPhrabang and Khammouan provinces, and the Department of Civil Aviation. For the Viet Nam \ncomponents,  the  EAs  of  An  Giang  and  Tien  Giang  provinces  will  implement  part  A  of  the \nProject. \n \n45. \nPCUs, to be headed by a project director, will be established in each NTO. They will be \nsupported  by  project  management  units  (PMUs)  established  in  the  IAs  in  Cambodia  and  Lao \nPDR  and  in  the  other  EAs  in  Viet  Nam,  and  PIUs  established  at  the  provincial  level  for  each \nsubproject. PCUs will be responsible for day-to-day management, and monitoring of all project \nactivities, including coordination with PCUs in other GMSPCs, PMUs, and PIUs. Each PCU will \nbe staffed by a project director and six permanent staff including a project manager, a financial \nofficer,  an  accountant,  an  environmental  specialist,  a  social  specialist,  and  a  resettlement \nspecialist, and supported by international and domestic consultants.  Project directors and PCU \nstaff  have  been  appointed  as  well  as  deputy  project  directors  for  each  PMU  and  PIU.

This \nis  considered  reasonable  based  on  the  proposed  size  of  the  individual  subprojects  and  the \ncommitment  and  interest  shown  by  all  IAs.  An  implementation  schedule  is  presented  in \nAppendix 9. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n47. \nGoods  and  works  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB \nGuidelines for Procurement. International competitive bidding procedures will be used for major \ncivil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost  over  $1.0  million  and  supply  contracts  valued  over \n$500,000.  Minor  civil  works  will  be  procured  through  local  competitive  bidding  in  accordance \nwith  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  International  shopping  procedures  will  be  followed  for \nmaterials  and  equipment  packages  estimated  to  cost  more  than  $100,000  equivalent  but  less \nthan  $500,000  equivalent.  Equipment  that  is  locally  available  and  costs  less  than  $100,000 \nequivalent may be procured through direct purchase in accordance with procedures satisfactory \nto ADB. For the pro-poor, community-based tourism component, most of the subprojects will be \nrelatively  small,  and  scattered  throughout  the  provinces.  The  Project  will  consider  funding \nsuitable  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  to  work  in  a  collaborative  and  participatory \nmanner  with  local  communities.  PMUs  will  prepare  the  bidding  documents  and  evaluate  the \ncomponents under their responsibility and will report to the PCU. All procurement processes will \nbe  channeled  through  the  PCUs  for  concurrence  before  submission  to  ADB  for  approval. \nIndicative contract packaging is presented in Appendix 10. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n48. \nTo support the implementation of the Project, a total of 346 person-months of consulting \nservices (127 person-months of international and 219 person-months of domestic services) will \nbe  required  for  Cambodia,  241  person-months  (104  person-months  of  international  and  137 \nperson-months  of  domestic  services)  for  the  Lao  PDR,  and  169  person-months  (63  person-\nmonths  of  international  and  106  person-months  of  domestic  services)  for  Viet  Nam.  The \nconsultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \nand  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants. \nSeparate  consulting  services  packages  will  be  procured  to  provide  assistance  to  the  PCUs \nestablished  in  the  NTOs,  and  the  PMUs  in  charge  of  infrastructure  improvements.  The \nconsultants for the PMUs will be firms and will focus on part A. The consultants for the PCUs \nwill be firms and will focus on overall project management and part C of the Project. Individual \nconsultants  will  be  used  for  part  B  and  will  be  recruited  by  the  PCU.  Consulting  firms  will  be \nselected  and  engaged  following  the  quality  and  cost-based  selection  method.  Consultants  will \nprovide  on-the  job  training  to  national  and  provincial  government  officials  involved  in \nimplementation of the Project. Information on consulting services is presented in Appendix 11. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n49. \nPayment  of  eligible  expenditures  from  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  made  either \nthrough  disbursement  procedures,  direct  procedures,  commitment  procedures,  or \nreimbursement procedures in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook of January \n2001.  To  ensure  the  timely  release  of  loan  proceeds,  and  to  expedite  project  implementation, \nthe  governments  of  Cambodia  and  Lao  PDR  will,  immediately  upon  loan  effectiveness,  open \nand maintain a project imprest account in their respective central banks; and the Government of \n\n\f \n \n\n15\n\nViet Nam will open three imprest accounts, one for each EA in commercial banks acceptable to \nADB.  Concurrently,  PMUs  will  each  establish  second  generation  imprest  accounts,  and  the \nPIUs  in  each  province  will  establish  project  accounts,  as required,  under  supervision  by  PCU. \nThe  initial  deposit  to  the  imprest  accounts  for  each  country  will  be  based  on  estimated \nexpenditures for the first 6 months of project implementation, but will not exceed the equivalent \nof  $1.0  million  for  Cambodia,  and  $500,000  for  Lao  PDR  and  Viet  Nam.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of \nexpenditure (SOE) procedures may be used for reimbursement of eligible expenditures and for \nliquidation of advances in the imprest account. SOE procedures will be applicable to contracts \namounting to $50,000 or less. The consultants will provide training and operating support to the \nPCUs, PMUs, and PIUs accounting staff on the use of the project accounts in the initial stage of \nproject implementation. In Cambodia and Lao PDR, IAs will submit SOEs to their ministries of \nfinance and to the EAs. The EAs will approve each SOE within 12 working days in Cambodia, \nand  within  15  calendar  days  in  the  Lao  PDR.  In  Viet  Nam,  the  PPCs  will  send  a  copy  of  the \nSOEs  to  the  PCU.  Disbursement  arrangements  will  be  subject  to  ADB\u2019s  review  during  its  first \nyear of project implementation. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n50. \nThe  NTOs  will  provide  ADB  with  quarterly  and  annual  progress  reports  on  Project \nimplementation  30  days  after  the  end  of  the  reporting  period.  The  progress  reports  will  be \nprepared  by  each  PIU  and  PMU  and  consolidated  by  the  PCU.  The  reports  will  particularly \naddress the institutional and policy development aspects of the Project. Separate accounts for \nthe Project will be maintained by the PCU. Detailed annual project accounts, and statements of \nthe imprest account, will be audited and submitted to ADB within 9 months of the close of the \nfinancial year. An auditor, acceptable to ADB, will be appointed to audit the accounts. The NTOs \nwill also submit to ADB, within 3 months of completion of the Project, a project completion report \nthat  will  cover  the  details  of  project  implementation,  costs,  PPMS  activities  and  results, \ncompliance with covenants, and other information that may be requested by ADB. \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n51. \nThe  EAs  will  ensure  that  a  comprehensive  PPMS  program  acceptable  to  ADB  is \nprepared  and  implemented  to  monitor  and  evaluate  the  technical  performance  and  social  and \neconomic  benefits  of  the  Project,  especially  for  the  low-income  groups.  The  PPMS  indicators \nand  procedures  will  be  tested  for  data  availability  and  other  constraints,  revised  where \nnecessary, and institutionalized as part of the management information systems of the agencies \nconcerned. For the pro-poor, community-based tourism component, the provincial governments \nwill  perform  the  PPMS  activities  and  ensure  that  the  facilities  provided  or  improved  under  the \nProject are managed efficiently and that the benefits are maximized. The PCUs will maintain the \nPPMS, and analyze and compile data, in coordination with the PMUs and PIUs. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n52. \nIn addition to periodic reviews of the Project, a first year review will be carried out jointly \nby  each  Government  and  ADB  within  1  year  of  loan  effectiveness.  A  midterm  review  will  be \nundertaken between each Government and ADB no later than 3 years after loan effectiveness. \nThese  reviews  will  include  a  comprehensive  evaluation  of  the  Project  implementation \narrangements,  the  progress  of  implementation  compared  with  targets,  feedback  from  PPMS \nactivities,  consultations  with  community  groups,  and  the  performance  of  the  consultants  and \nselected  NGOs.  The  cost  recovery  mechanisms  for  each  subproject  will  also  be  evaluated. \nRemedial action will be instituted as needed. \n\n\f 16\n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n53. \nEconomic Benefits. The Project will encourage sustainable tourism development in the \ncountries  of  the  lower  Mekong  River  basin.  Net  tourist  spending  in  the  Project  areas  will \nincrease  due  to  increased  numbers  of  tourists,  longer  stays  and  increased  tourist  spending. \nAdditional  net  tourist  spending  due  to  the  Project  during  the  first  10  years  after  project \ncompletion  is  expected  to  be  $129  million.  Sustainable  tourism  growth  will  increase  foreign \nexchange earnings, support economic growth, and create new employment opportunities. The \neconomic  internal  rates  of  return  calculated  for  tourism  infrastructure  subprojects  range  from \n13.3%  to  33.4%.  The  economic  analysis  is  presented  in  Appendix  12;  details  are  available  in \nSupplementary Appendix F.  \n \nFinancial  Benefits.  The  establishment  of  appropriate  cost  recovery  mechanisms  and \n54. \ninstitutional reforms will increase the financial revenues from airports, sewerage systems, river \npiers  and  small  roads  to  tourist  destinations.  A  significant  portion  of  the  financial  benefits  will \ncome from the tourists visiting the project areas. The reinvestment of benefits to the sector will \nensure that appropriate funding is available for O&M of the infrastructure facilities, and (in some \ncases)  sufficient  revenue  is  collected  to  expand  the  facilities  built  under  the  Project.  This  will \nensure the sustainability and increased quality of the services, establishing the basis for further \nimprovements  of  the  accessibility  and  attractiveness  of  the  tourist  destinations.  The  financial \ninternal  rates  of  return  of  applicable  subprojects  range  from  2.2%  to  13.3%,  higher  than  the \nestimated weighted average cost of capital at 1.2% for projects in Cambodia and the Lao PDR \nand  1.1%  for  projects  in  Viet  Nam.  The  financial  analysis  is  presented  in  Supplementary \nAppendix G.  \n \n55. \nEnvironmental  Benefits.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  improved  environmental \nconditions  in  several  urban  areas  by  rehabilitating  and  expanding  the  sewerage  systems  in \nSiem  Reap  in  Cambodia  and  Sam  Mountain  in  Viet  Nam,  and  expanding  landfill  capacities, \npreparing solid waste management plans, and providing equipment in Tien Giang Province and \nSam Mountain in Viet Nam. In the rural areas, the Project will facilitate the conservation of the \nnatural  environment  of  the  subregion.  It  will  provide  opportunities for  alternative  income to  the \nlocal  population  in  isolated  areas,  thus  taking  pressure  off  forests.  Additionally,  awareness \nprograms  and  training  for  local  communities  on  the  relationship  between  tourism  and \nenvironmental conservation will be undertaken.  \n \n56. \nInstitutional Benefits. The Project will reinforce the role of AMTA as the only agency in \nthe GMS responsible for coordinating tourism, by appointing a national representative of AMTA \nin each GMSPCs and possible short-term secondments to the AMTA headquarters in Bangkok. \nThese  measures  will  improve  the  capacity  of  AMTA  to  perform  its  role  and  increase  the \nownership of the institution by the GMSPCs. At the national level, the establishment of TMPBs \nwith participation from public and private sectors will facilitate the preparation of more efficient \ntourism  marketing  and  promotion  strategies,  international  cooperation  activities  involving  the \nprivate sector, and the development of common approaches to tourism regulations, standards, \nand investment incentives. In the civil aviation sector, the Project will promote the establishment \nof  autonomous  airport  authorities  in  Cambodia  and  Lao  PDR,  which  will  be  able  to  collect \nrevenue  from  airport  operations  and  reinvest  it  in  the  airports  to  ensure  sustainability.  In  the \nurban sector, the establishment of a wastewater agency in Siem Reap and urban environmental \nunits at the provincial level in Viet Nam will provide models for replication countrywide. In Viet \nNam,  the  establishment  of  public  sector  pier  authorities  responsible  for  O&M  of  the  piers,  as \nseparate entities from the commercial provincial tourism companies, will increase transparency \nand equitable competition in tourist river transport.  \n\n\f \n \n\n17\n\nSocial  Impacts.  The  improvements  to  tourism-related  infrastructure  will  bring  major \n57. \nsocial benefits to residents in and around urban areas, local and international tourists, and the \ntourism industry.  Upgraded roads will facilitate the movement of population and goods, as will \nrehabilitated  airports  and  river  facilities  that  encourage  greater  tourist  numbers.  Economic \nactivity  in  the  subregion  will  increase  with  increased  employment  and  higher  incomes.    The \nprovision of efficient wastewater treatment and sewerage disposal systems will similarly improve \nthe health and general quality of life of resident populations. The burden on women in particular, \non whom much childcare and household activities depend, will be relieved with improved child \nhealth  resulting  from  more  efficient  sewerage  and  waste  disposal.  Better  facilities  at  border \ncrossings  will  facilitate  movement  of  migrant  workers  and  local  tourists,  and  contribute  to  the \ndevelopment of the wider regional economy. \n \nImpact on the Poor and Vulnerable. The poor in rural areas will especially benefit from \n58. \ncommunity-based  ecotourism  and  village-based \ntourism  subprojects  supported  by  a \nconcentrated and focused program spanning two provinces in Cambodia, four in the Lao PDR, \nand  two  in  Viet  Nam.  Isolated  rural  areas  will  be  integrated  into  the  mainstream  of  regional \neconomic  and  social  life  through  ecotourism  and  village-based  tourism  development.  As \nsuccessfully demonstrated in the UNESCO-supported Nam Ha ecotourism project, ecotourism \ncan  reduce  rural  poverty  by  increasing  rural  employment  and  incomes;  encourage  the \nconservation of the natural and cultural heritage; and enable the poor, women, and indigenous \ncommunities  to  participate  in  and  influence  development  projects  that  directly  influence  their \nown futures. Indigenous minorities and women, in particular, will benefit from training as guides \nand  managers,  providing  food  and  accommodation  for  tourists,  and  the  sale  of  handicrafts.  \nEthnic  minorities  will  also  increasingly  value  their  own  cultures  as  tourists  and  governments \ndemonstrate  an  interest  in  them  and  their  survival.  Increased  exposure  to  tourism  will  be \naccompanied  by  a  corresponding  awareness  of  the  need  to  protect  the  physical  and  cultural \nenvironments from undesirable social and economic pressures. \n \nPolicy  Dialogue.  Policy  dialogue  has  centered  on  issues  that  will  facilitate  the \n59. \nmovement  of  tourists  within  the  region  and  will  enhance  subregional  cooperation.  Under  the \nProject,  tourist  movement  by  air  will  be  facilitated  and  efficiency  improvements  in  air  services \nwill  be  obtained  as  a  consequence  of  increased  competition  once  the  upgraded  domestic \nairports are opened to subregional air traffic. Tourist movement by land will also be facilitated by \nissuing  visas  on  arrival  at  several  border  checkpoints  near  some  project  areas,  and  at  those \nborder  posts  where  the  Project  supports  investments  in  small  infrastructure  and  equipment. \nThese interventions are expected to show the benefits of facilitating the movement of tourists, \nand  promote  continued  policy  dialogue  for  further  liberalization.  The  harmonization  of  hotel \nclassification  systems  in  the  subregion  will  also  serve  as  a  pilot  case for  harmonizing  of  other \ntourism services that will ensure a common quality of service and standards in the GMS. Other \nresults  of  the  intensive  policy  dialogue  include  (i)  the  integration  of  poverty,  gender, \nenvironmental,  resettlement,  and  indigenous  people\u2019s  concerns  in  the  preparation  of  policies, \nand  in  the  identification,  development,  and  management  of  tourism  destinations;  and  (ii) the \nincreased participation of the private sector in tourism through the establishment of TMPBs, with \nthe private sector having the leading role. \n \n60. \n At the national level, policy dialogue has included (i) civil aviation sector reform through \nadvances  in  the  institutional  reform  process  for  the  establishment  of  autonomous  airports \nauthorities in Cambodia and Lao PDR; and (ii) institutional reform and O&M issues concerning \nurban  environmental  services  in  Cambodia  and  Viet  Nam  that  will  ensure  the  institution  of \nappropriate  cost  recovery  mechanisms.  Additionally,  separating  the  operation  of  the  tourism \n\n\f 18\n\nriver  piers  in  the  Mekong  River  delta  from the  tourist  companies  using  them  will  help  improve \ncompetition and transparency and enhance the O&M of tourism river piers in the Mekong Delta. \n \n61. \nRisks.  The  main  risks  associated  with  the  Project  are  (i)  delays  caused  by  the  lack  of \nexperience  of  the  EAs  in  managing  an  ADB-funded  project;  (ii)  delays  caused  by  the  lack  of \neffective  coordination  of  the  EAs,  other  line  ministries,  provincial  authorities,  and  consultants; \n(iii) inadequate counterpart funding; and (iv) the poor, women, and vulnerable rural indigenous \ncommunities being negatively affected by pressures arising from resettlement, contact with alien \ncultures,  other  negative  socioeconomic  impacts,  or  not  being  able  to  benefit  from  increased \ntourism. \n  \n62. \nRisk  Mitigation.  The  Project  incorporates  mitigation  measures  to  address  these  risks. \nThey include: (i) two individual, international consultants with experience in implementing ADB-\nassisted projects and managing project accounts will be recruited in each GMSPCs at an early \nstage  of  project  implementation  to  help  PCUs,  PMUs,  and  PIUs  establish  effective  project \nmanagement,  reporting,  and  coordinating  procedures,  and  train  local  staff;  (ii)  cost  recovery \nmechanisms  have  been  included  for  all  infrastructure  projects,  with  the  tourists  using  the \nfacilities  contributing  a  significant  portion  of  the  funds  needed  for  O&M;  (iii)  the  ministries  of \nfinance of each country has confirmed that ADB-financed projects will have priority in budgetary \nallocation of counterpart funds; (iv) resettlement frameworks for each country and resettlement \nplans  for  each  subproject  with  significant  impact  have  been  prepared  and  agreed  upon;  (v)  a \npro-poor ethnic minority participation program to protect the most vulnerable minority groups will \nbe  prepared  in  each  province;  (vi)  awareness  campaigns,  directed  at  tourists  and  local \ncommunities, that focus on the dangers of drug abuse and the health risks of indiscriminate and \ncommercial  sex  activities;  and  (vii)  training  for  the  development  of  microbusinesses  in  areas \nsubject  to  tourism  expansion  and  capacity  building  for  the  rural  poor  in  community-based \necotourism to ensure that they will benefit from increased tourism. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  governments  have  given  the  following \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n63. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n64. \n \n\nConditions applicable to all three countries are as follows: \n\n(i) \n\nIn  accordance  with  regulations  of  the  GMSPCs  governments  and  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental  guidelines,  during  feasibility  study,  the  governments  will  prepare \nan  IEE  for  each  candidate  subproject  and  submit  it  to  ADB  for  review  and \napproval prior to the approval of the subproject. To ensure that every IEE is well \nprepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  requirements,  an  international  expert  on \nenvironmental  assessments  (2  person-months)  and  a  domestic  environment \nconsultant (2 person-months) will be recruited by each GMSPCs during the first \nyear of Project implementation. \n \n\n(ii)  Within 3 months after loan effectiveness, the EAs will ensure that the provincial \nauthorities  of  Stung  Treng  and  Rattanak  Kiri  in  Cambodia;  Louang  Namtha, \nLouang Phrabang, Khammouan and Champassak in the Lao PDR; and An Giang \nand Tien Giang in Viet Nam will establish PIUs for project implementation. \n \n\n\f(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n \n65. \n \n\n \n \n\n19\n\nThe  EAs  will  ensure  that  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  actions  are  taken  in \naccordance  with  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  as  set  out  in  the  agreed  resettlement  plans  and \nframework.  \n\nConditions applicable to Cambodia are as follows: \n\nWithin  9  months  after  loan  effectiveness,  an  environment  unit  will  have  been \nestablished  within  the  PIU/Department  of  Public  Works  and  Transport  in  Siem \nReap  to  ensure  that  the  EMP  is  implemented  and  monitored  to  a  satisfactory \nstandard.  \n\n \n(ii)  Within  12  months  after  loan  effectiveness,  the  Ministry  of  Tourism  will  have \ndeveloped  guidelines,  procedures,  composition,  financing  mechanisms,  and \nterms  of  reference  acceptable  to  ADB  for  the  TMPB,  and  will  have  established \nthe TMPB through a subdecree, within 18 months after loan effectiveness. \n\n(iii)  Within 18 months after loan effectiveness, the Government will have ensured that \nvisas  will  be  available  on  arrival  for  international  tourists  crossing  the  border \ncheckpoint on the Mekong River with the Lao PDR (Don Kralor) in Stung Treng \nProvince, provided that there is an analogous facility on the Lao PDR side of the \nborder. \n\n \n(iv)  Within  18  months  after  loan  effectiveness,  an  autonomous  waste  water \nmanagement agency, will have been established in Siem Reap by a subdecree \nor  an  interministerial  regulation,  acceptable  to  the  Government  and  ADB,  and \nwith the authority and capacity to collect fees from hotels, other businesses, and \ndomestic households. The agency will be responsible for O&M of the sewerage \nsystem  created  under  the  Project.  The  agency  will  prepare  its  own  budget, \ndetermine  service  charges  and  retain  all  revenues  to  pay  its  expenses.  It  will \nhave  a  minimum  of  15  employees,  including  a  general  manager,  a  financial \nofficer, an accountant, and an environmental specialist.  \n\n(v)  Within 24 months after loan effectiveness, the Government will have established \nan autonomous airport authority, which  will be responsible for development and \nO&M  of  all  airports  in  Cambodia,  including  Rattanak  Kiri  and  Stung  Treng.  The \nauthority  will  be  a  separate  legal  entity  and  with  control  over  its  budget  and  all \nfees  generated  by  operating  Cambodia\u2019s  airports.  Upon  establishment  of  the \nauthority, SSCA will transfer to it the project facilities, including all rights therein \nand legal titles. \n\n(vi)  Within 24 months after loan effectiveness, MPP will have levied a surcharge on \nthe  entry  fee  currently  charged  by  the  MPP  to  international  tourists  visiting  the \nGenocide Memorial in Phnom Penh. MPP will ensure that funds so collected will \nbe  retained  and  used  solely  for  the  O&M  of  the  access  road  to  the  site  of  the \nGenocide Memorial. \n\n(vii)  Within  30  months  after  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  revise  civil \naviation charges by a subdecree to meet the costs of airport O&M (including the \nairports  of  Stung  Treng  and  Rattanak  Kiri).

includes  the  upgrading  of  priority  tourism-related  infrastructure  that  will  facilitate \naccess  or  improve  the  environmental  situation  of  tourist  destinations.  It  includes  the  following \nsubprojects: \n \n\n1.  \n\nCambodia \n\n \n2.  \nSiem  Reap  Environmental  Improvement.  The  Siem  Reap  town  is  growing  very  fast,  and \nattracted  about  265,000  international  tourists  in  2001.  Many  hotels  and  private  houses  discharge \nwastewater into a canal to the west of the town, which is heavily polluted due to lack of maintenance \nand  encroachment  by  dwellings,  which  partially  block  the  canal  in  various  places.  The  wastewater \nflows  untreated  to  the  Tonle  Sap  Lake  or  filters  into  the  ground,  polluting  the  ground  water  and \ncreating high risks for the health of the local population and tourists, and for the fragile ecosystem of \nTonle Sap Lake. The Project will rehabilitate the urban sewer on the west side of the town, construct \nnew connections to the system, construct stabilizing lagoons to treat discharges from a population of \nabout  17,000  in  the  west  part  of  the  town,  and  prepare  a  community  sanitation  and  health \nawareness program and a small resettlement plan. \n \n3. \nRoad  Access  Improvement  to  the  Genocide  Memorial.  The  memorial  to  the  genocide \nerected at Cheong Ek, about 9 kilometers (km) from Phnom Penh, attracted about 25,000 tourists in \n2001. However, the access road to the site is in very poor condition and constraints visits the site, \nparticularly in the rainy season when the road becomes almost impassable. The Project will elevate \nthe  6.3  km  access  road,  surface  it  with  asphalt  concrete,  rebuild  two  bridges,  and  improve  the \ndrainage system for the road. \n \nRattanak Kiri Airport Improvement. Rattanak Kiri is a very attractive province isolated due \n4. \nto  the  poor  condition  of  the  road.  The  province  depends  on  air  travel  for  economic  development, \ntourism,  and  health  purposes.  About  12,800  passengers  used  the  airport  in  2001.  However,  the \nairport is in poor condition and the runway is too short to permit ATR 72 or similar sized aircraft to \noperate  safely  with  economic  loads.  The  Project  will  include  the  resurfacing  and  extension  of  the \nrunway,  a  new  taxiway  and  apron,  runway  grading  and  a  drainage  system,  a  new  passenger \nterminal, an airport fence, a control tower, an operations building, car park and access, navigation, \nsecurity and communication equipment, and land acquisition and resettlement. \n \n5. \nStung  Treng  Airport  Improvement.  Stung  Treng  is  on  the  Mekong  River,  strategically \nsituated  just  a  few  kilometers  from  the  border  with  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao \nPDR). The province has many nature-based tourist attractions; however, access from Phnom Penh \nby  road  is  extremely  difficult  and  river  access  is  slow  and  impossible  during  the  dry  season.  The \nairport is in poor condition and the runway is too short to permit ATR 72 or similar sized aircraft to \noperate safely. The project will include the resurfacing and extension of the runway, a new taxiway \nand  apron,  runway  grading  and  drainage  system,  a  new  passenger  terminal,  an  airport  fence,  a \ncontrol tower, an operations building, car park and access, navigation equipment, and security and \ncommunication equipment. \n \n\n2. \n\nLao PDR \n\n \n6. \nLouang Namtha Airport Improvement. Lao Aviation operates round trips from Vientiane to \nLouang Namtha four times weekly and twice  weekly service from Louang Phrabang and Houeixai. \nHowever,  the  poor  condition  of  the  airport  makes  these  services  very  dangerous  and  unreliable \n\n \n\n \n\n\f30\n\nAppendix 3 \n\ndepending on weather conditions. The present airport has a runway of 1.2 km which allows landing \nonly for small aircraft. The extension of the runway to 1.5 km is required to allow the landing of larger \nand more reliable aircraft commonly used in the region. The present runway is in poor condition, full \nof  patches,  encroached  on  by  vegetation,  and  full  of  water  in  the  rainy  season  due  to  lack  of  a \ndrainage system. The terminal and control tower are rudimentary, as are the passenger facilities and \nthere is no emergency and fire service equipment. The improvement of the airport is necessary to \nattract  more  tourists  and  develop  the  potential  of  the  area.  The  project  includes  the  repairing  and \nextending  of  the  runway,  constructing  a  drainage  system  and  a  passenger  terminal,  providing \nemergency, fire service, and air navigation equipment. \n \n7. \nImprovement of the  Access Road to Konglor Cave. The project site is 46 km from road \n8a, connecting Lao PDR and Viet Nam, in Khammouan Province. The main attractions of the area \nare limestone formations and natural caves, including an 11.2 km underground river. The area is not \naccessible  by  air,  and  tourists  travel  by  road  or  across  from  Thailand  and  Viet  Nam.  The  site  can \nalso be reached by a 4 hour road journey from Vientiane. The project includes upgrading of the 36 \nkm road connecting to road 8a. The road is in a very poor condition and becomes impassable during \nrainy season. The project will include the extension of a small water supply system. \n \n8. \nImprovement  of the  Access  Road  to  the  Kwangsi  Water  Fall. The  spectacular  Kwangsi \nwater fall is 29 km south of the World Heritage site of Louang Phrabang, and received about 38,200 \nforeign visitors in 2001 (from a total of 68,250 foreign tourists visiting the province). The road from \nLouang Phrabang to the falls is dusty and bumpy and used by open vehicles or rented motorbikes. \nThe situation of the present road causes high vehicle operation costs for local transport companies, \nentails high road maintenance costs, is a highly unpleasant experience for tourists, and is accident-\nprone  due  to  the  dust.  The  proposed  project  includes  upgrading  of  22  km  of  access  road  with \nasphalt concrete, and extending small water supply and infrastructure facilities, such as toilets by the \nsite and trekking trails around the site. \n \n\n3. \n\nViet Nam \n\n \n9. \nSam Mountain Environmental Improvement in An Giang Province. Sam Mountain is one \nof  the  most  important  tourist  centers  of  the  Mekong  Delta,  and  attracted  more  than  2  million \nVietnamese visitors in 2001, who came as pilgrims to visit the famous Buddhist temples around the \nmountain. Considered by the Government as one of the five international tourist attractions1 of the \ndelta, Sam Mountain is also visited by 16,000 international tourists annually and has great potential \nto  attract  many  more  international  visitors.  However,  due  to  unplanned  tourism  development  and \nlack of investment in environmental urban services, the mountain and the villages where the tourists \nstay  are  in  a  critical  environmental  situation,  increasing  the  health  risks  for  tourists  and  the  local \npopulation  and  reducing  the  attractiveness  of  the  site.  The  subproject  will  include  a  wastewater \nmanagement  system  and  treatment  lagoons,  a  solid  waste  management plan  for the  area,  landfill, \nsmall drainage improvements, and land acquisition and resettlement. \n \n10. \nAn  Giang  Tourist  River  Piers  Development.  An  Giang  Province  is  the  gateway  of  the \nMekong River for all tourists visiting the Mekong Delta from Cambodia and Lao PDR by river. More \nthan  12,000  international  tourists  cross  the  border  by  river  from  Cambodia  every  year  and  the \nnumber is increasing rapidly. Furthermore, tourists coming from Ho Chi Minh City and other places \nin  the  delta  could  visit  the  province  by  river.  However,  neither  appropriate  river  piers  are  not \navailable  to  accommodate  the  increasing  number  of  visitors.  Thus,  the  project  will  include  the \nconstruction of a floating pier and tourist visa clearing and restroom facilities in Vinh Xuong, and the \nconstruction of a pier in Chau Doc with waiting lounge and toilet. \n\n                                                 \n1   Viet Nam National Administration of Tourism. 1998. Tourism Development Planning in Mekong River Delta. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n31\n\n11.  My  Tho  Tourist  River  Pier  Development  in  Tien  Giang  Province.  More  than  378,000 \ntourists,  including  191,000  foreigners  used  the river  pier  facilities  in  My  Tho  in  2001.  Most  tourists \nuse this pier to visit the attractive Thoi Son Island and other islands in the province, while some use \nthe  pier  to  start  a  river  trip  in  the  Mekong  Delta.  The  existing  small  wooden  quay  cannot \naccommodate the demand, which has been increasing by 20% annually in the last 5 years. The lack \nof  space  causes  delays  and  increases  security  risks,  and  the  tourist  facilities  in  the  pier  are  very \npoor.  The  project  will  include  the  construction  of  a  new  pier  complex  that  can  accommodate  150 \npassengers, fencing of the site, parking area, toilets, and tourist facilities. \n \nTien  Giang  Environmental  Improvement.  The  combination  of  lack  of  investment  and  a \n12. \nrapid increase in the amount of solid waste generated by more than 300 hotels and guesthouses in \nMy  Tho  City  and  378,000  visitors  to  the  four  tourist  islands  in  the  province  has  increased  the \ndifficulties  of  the  provincial  authorities  in  collecting,  transporting,  and  depositing  the  waste  in  an \nefficient  manner  that  respects  the  environment.  The  current  landfill  used  by  the  provincial \ngovernment  will  reach  its  capacity  in  less  than  2  years.  Action  is  urgently  required  to  avoid further \ndeterioration  of  the  environment.  The  project  will  include  a  solid  waste  management  plan  for  the \nislands  visited  by  the  tourists  and  My  Tho  City,  equipment  for  the  collection  and  transportation  of \ngarbage from the islands and My Tho City to the landfill site, and improvement and expansion of the \ncapacity  of  the  current  landfill,  20  km  from  the  town.  It  will  also  include  the  development  of  an \necological  toilet  system  and  a  program  to  improve  management  capacity  and  community \nparticipation in environmental protection. \n \nPart B:  Pro-Poor, Community-Based Tourism Development    \n \nPart  B  will  assist  local  communities  with  distinctive  rural  lifestyles  or  living  in  areas  with \n13. \npristine ecosystems to manage and determine their limits to tourism growth, increase control in the \nselection of tourist types and modalities, and equitably distribute tourism benefits. It will develop pilot \necotourism  and  village-based  tourism  projects,  foster  the  conservation  and  improvement  of  the \ncultural, and environmental heritage of the selected areas, monitor social impacts, promote the role \nof women, and establish measures to minimize  negative impacts due to increased tourism. Part B \nwill include the provinces of Rattanak Kiri and Stung Treng in Cambodia; Louang Namtha, Louang \nPhrabang, Khammouan, Champassak in Lao PDR; and An Giang and Tien Giang in Viet Nam. It will \ninclude the following components: \n \n14. \nInstitutional Strengthening and Community  Participation Program. The component will \ninclude  support  for  the  establishment  of  national,  provincial,  and  village  organizations  that  will \npromote  pro-poor  community  based  ecotourism  and  village-based  activities.  It  will  also  include \nsupport for the preparation of detailed participation plans in each province and the implementation of \nthe plan. It could include the organization of workshops, surveys, discussion groups, etc. \n \nAwareness  Program  on  Tourism  Benefits  and  Negative  Impacts,  and  Environmental \n15. \nand Cultural Conservation. The component will develop and implement an awareness program for \nselected  communities  to  show  the  economic  and  social  benefits  derived  from  environmental  and \ncultural  conservation  though  increased  tourism.  The  program  will  also  provide  awareness \ntourism \ncampaigns  and  develop  measures  to  mitigate \nmismanagement and uncontrolled tourism, such as illegal traffic of women and children, HIV/AIDS,2 \nchildren  prostitution,  drug  trafficking,  etc.  It  will  advertise  successful  experience  in  the  region, \neducate  tourists,  and  include  the  preparation  of  a  manual  on  ecotourism  and  environmental \nconservation and other materials. \n \n\nthe  potential  negative \n\nimpacts  of \n\n                                                 \n2  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome \n\n \n\n \n\n\f32\n\nAppendix 3 \n\n16. \nPro-Poor Tourism Products Identification and Development. The component will initially \nidentify  possibilities  for  community-based  tourism  in  each  province,  based  on  community \ncommitment,  attractiveness  of  the  destination  and  potential  for  development,  demand  analysis, \naccessibility, absorptive capacity of the site, and sustainability. Where appropriate, tourism products \nwill be developed, as for example, the sustainable development of treks/excursions by land or river, \nbased  on  the  appeal  of ethnic  minorities  and their  ways  of  life;  other  aspects  of  social,  cultural,  or \neconomic life; or the natural environment. \n \n17. \nSmall-Scale Tourism-Related Infrastructure. The component will support the development \nof small-scale infrastructure for the new identified local tourists sites, for example, village lodges and \nother forms of local accommodation, through a combination of grants and loans from revolving credit \nschemes,  designed  to  be  sustainably  operated  by  local  people.  It  could  include  support  for  the \ndevelopment of provincial or district visitor and information centers for community-based projects, if \nthis  is  appropriate,  the  objectives  of  the  center  have  been  clearly  defined,  the  location  has  been \ncarefully  analyzed  comparing  different  options,  and  the  local  authorities  or  the  communities  have \nallocated personnel to serve the tourism center. \n \n18. \nCapacity  Building  for Tourism-Related  Local  Microenterprises  and Communities. The \ncomponent  will  provide  support  to  local  communities  and  small  tourism-related  enterprises  to \nenhance  their  capabilities  to  interact  and  communicate  with  international  tourists.  Training  will  be \nprovided  at  provincial  and  local  levels  in  guiding  techniques,  language  skills,  environmental  and \ninterpretative techniques, financial management, and planning for ecotourism development. \n \n19. \nGender  Development  Program.    The  Project  will  support  rural  poor  women\u2019s  full \nparticipation in economic activities associated with development of pro-poor ecotourism. Training of \nwomen  in  developing  and  running  micro  enterprises,  identification  of  markets  and  provision  of \nbackward  and  forward  linkages,  participation  in  guiding  tourists,  community-based  housing  for \ntourists, and handicraft production are expected to create alternative opportunities for poor women \nand  reduce  risks  of  sexual  exploitation.  Women  will  be  fully  involved  in  decision-making  for \necotourism  development  at  all  levels,  through  their  organization,  training,  and  awareness  in  all \naspects  of  tourism  development.  At  least  40%  of  members  of  all  ecotourism  stakeholder \nassociations  to  be  set  up  under  the  Project  are  to  be  women.  Regular  monitoring  and  impact \nassessment  will  be  done  with  the  full  participation  of  women,  using  gender  sensitive  variables  to \nassess  poverty  reduction,  improvement  in  access  to  social  services,  reduction  of  risks  associated \nwith  increased  movements  of  people  in  fragile  and  poor  areas,  and  improvements  in  women\u2019s \nstatus. \n \n20. \nEthnic  Minorities  Participation  Program.  The  component  will  focus  on  the  support  for \npreparing  ethnic  minorities\u2019  participation  programs  in  each  province  included  in  the  Project  where \nethnic minorities exist, and the implementation of the program to ensure that these groups are not \nnegatively affected by tourism development, and can enjoy a significant part of tourism benefits to \nthe project areas. \n \n21.  Marketing and Promotion Plan. The component will include training in basic techniques in \nmarketing  and  ecotourism  promotion,  and  the  identification  of  specific  markets  for  the  ecotourism \nventures  developed  under  the  Project.  It  will  also  support  development  websites,  promotional \nmaterials, and advertising campaigns in selected national or international markets. \n \nPromotion  of  Community-Based  Tourism  Networks  and  Ecotourism  Stakeholder \n22. \nAssociations. The component will involve creating a series of developing and sustainable networks, \nthrough  seminars  and  workshops,  at  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS),  national,  and  provincial \nlevels.  The  networks  will  enable  the  productive  and  regular  transmission  of  information,  especially \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n33\n\nshared  information  concerning  best  practices,  and  the  regular  extension  of  these  across  national \nboundaries  within  the  GMS,  most  notably  Cambodia,  Lao  PDR,  and  Viet  Nam.  In  particular,  the \nestablishment  at  subregional,  national,  and  provincial  levels  of  the  networks  will  encourage  the \nformation of individual associations from the sectors of the tourism industry and enable them to meet \nregularly  with  representatives  of  communities,  local  governments,  and  government  departments \n(e.g.,  agriculture  and  forestry,  fisheries,  women\u2019s  and  ethnic  minorities  affairs),  women\u2019s  groups, \nnongovernment  organizations,  ethnic  minority  associations,  and  other  parties  with  economic  and \npractical  interests  in  the  development  of  pro-poor,  community-orientated  sustainable  tourism \npractices. \n \n23. \nProject Performance Monitoring System Project Outputs and Impacts. This component \nwill  include  the  development  of  regular  monitoring  mechanisms  to  ensure  that  the  basic  aims  and \nobjectives  of  the  overall  program  are  being  met  and  benefits  of  tourism  are  widely  distributed, \nparticularly  to  the  poor.  It  will  also  closely  monitor  that  expertise  being  provided  by  international \ntechnical  advisers  is  being  satisfactorily  disseminated  to  nationals  from  Cambodia,  Lao  PDR,  and \nViet Nam. \n \nPart C: Subregional Cooperation    \n \n24. \nPart  C  will  provide  measures  to  facilitate  and  promote  cooperation  among  the  GMS \nparticipating countries (GMSPCs), and with other GMS countries not included in the Project for the \ndevelopment  of  the  subregional  tourism  sector.  A  total  of  $350,000  will  be  allocated  for  each \nGMSPCs to use under the identified components for various cooperative and facilitation measures. \nPart C will include the following components. \n \n \n25. \nGMS  Facility  for  Tourism  Cooperation  (GMS-FTC).  All  national  tourism  organizations \n(NTOs)  have  signed  bilateral  agreements  for  tourism  cooperation.  However,  in  many  cases,  the \nbilateral agreements or agreements between provincial authorities from two different countries have \nnot  been  implemented  due  to  lack  of  funding.  Through  the  GMS  facility  for  tourism  cooperation \n(FTC), the Project will make available $80,000 from the loan for each GMSPCs. To access the FTC, \nnational  tourism  organizations  (NTOs)  should  identify  projects  that  will  encourage  regional  tourism \ndevelopment.  The  GMSFTC  will  only  be  used  for  projects  involving  at  least  two  GMSPCs  or  one \nGMSPC and another GMS country not included in the Project. In the latter case, the nonparticipating \ncountry  will  fund  its  contribution  from  its  own  resources.  The  NTOs  or  other  public  bodies  can \nrequest  funding  for  an  eligible  project  and  this  will  be  appraised  by  the  project  coordination  unit \n(PCUs),  and  sent  to  the  national  steering  committee  for  approval,  and  to  the  Asian  Development \nBank  (ADB)  for  concurrence  after  approval  by  the  national  steering  committee.  The  cooperating \nmembers  will  be  required  to  sign  a  cooperation  agreement  before  ADB  will  authorize  the  use  of \nthese funds. \n \nThe  facility  could  fund  (i)  studies  to  prepare  circuits  and  assess  demand,  (ii)  small-scale \n26. \ninfrastructure  to  improve  the  circuits,  (iii)  a  marketing  program  for  the  circuits,  (iv)  a  monitoring \nsystem  of  economic  benefits  for  each  country,  and  (v)  meetings  and  seminars  to  promote \ncooperation activities for the private sector on both sides of the border. Cross-border projects to be \nsupported  could  include  the  promotion  and  development  of  an  activity,  facility,  or  amenity,  that \ninvolves  two  or  more  countries,  and  ideally  where  the  benefits  would  be  jointly  shared.  Examples \ncould  include  observation  of  river  dolphins,  minority  cultural  displays,  trails  across  the  borders, \ninformation \ntrail \nimprovements/signposting, conservation measures, and the organizing costs of events. The facility \ncould  be  particularly  appropriate \ntriangle  of  northeastern  Cambodia, \nthe  development \nsoutheastern Lao PDR, and Viet Nam. \n \n\nstudies,  marketing, \n\nadvertising, \n\nproduction, \n\nbrochure \n\npanels, \n\nin \n\n \n\n \n\n\f34\n\nAppendix 3 \n\n27. \nImprovement  of  Tourism-Related  Facilities  at  Border  Posts.  The  Project  will  address \nconstraints to movement of tourists across the GMS. The Project will provide support to NTOs that \npropose  or  endorse  measures  suggested  by  other  public  agencies,  such  as  immigration \ndepartments,  to  fund  (i)  computer  equipment  for  visa  sections  in  the  border  checkpoints; \n(ii) provision of immigration and customs facilities to permit regional flights to land at local airports; \n(iii)  improved  facilities  in  immigration  offices  and  visa  extension  offices;  (iv) structures  for  new \ncrossing  points;  (v)  training  to  immigration  personnel;  (vi)  small-scale  infrastructure  in  border \ncheckpoints, establishing monitoring and financial management systems for the processing of visas \non arrival; and (vii) processing areas for vehicle movements. \n \n28. \nEstablishment  of  a  GMS  Network  of  Tourism  Marketing  and  Promotion  Boards.  The \nrole  of  government  in  tourism  should  be  limited  to  setting  objectives  and  policies  for  the  sector; \nmonitoring performance, control and regulation; and creating a favorable environment for business. \nIt  may  also  be  involved  in  sharing  responsibilities  for  training,  collection  of  statistics  and  basic \ninformation,  and  development.  NTOs  should  not  have  the  leading  role  in  marketing,  standards \ndevelopment, research, and service of tourists.  These are best undertaken by the private sector or \nby  a  tourism  marking  and  promotion  board (TMPB)  in  which  the  private  sector  has  a  leading  role. \nThe  involvement  of  the private  sector  in  tourism  marketing  and  promotion  is  necessary  because  it \nknows the market, knows how to market, and knows what the visitor demands and how to provide it. \nIt has more flexibility and ability to respond to changing situations than the public sector. At present, \nthe private sector is not involved in tourism marketing and promotion at the national level in any of \nthe  GMSPCs.  These  countries  recognize  the  need  to  further  involve  the  private  sector  in  tourism \npromotion and favor the establishment of TMPBs. \n \nThe component will provide the NTOs with resources to establish TMPBs and support them \n29. \nduring the first year of operations. The responsibilities of the TMPBs will essentially be international \npromotion,  servicing  of  tourism,  and  standards  development.  They  will  normally  act  independently \nbut will cooperate for their mutual benefit under the umbrella of the Agency for Coordinating Mekong \nTourism  Activities  (AMTA).  Resources  can  be  devoted  to  (i) incorporation  and  legal  matters;  (ii) \ndevelopment  of  a  corporate  image;  (iii)  start-up  costs;  (iv)  recruitment,  training,  management \nsystems;  (v)  computer  hardware  and  software,  equipment,  and  furniture  for  the  TMPB  and \ninformation  offices;  (vi)  design  and  production  of  initial  print  and  other  promotional  material;  and \n(vii) cooperation activities between GMS TMPBs. \n \n \n30. \nGMS Hotel Classification System. Customers want to be able to make \"value for money\" \nassessments  on  where  to  stay  based  on  an  impartial  and  independent  assessments,  and  the  tour \noperators need a hotel classification system to promote their product.  The GMSPC recognizes the \nnecessity for a system.  An ADB- funded technical assistance (TA) drafted recommendations for a \ngrading  system  in  Cambodia  in  2001  and  Viet  Nam  is  in  the  process  of  designing  a  scheme.  All \nthree countries have agreed to cooperate on a common system. The Project will provide support for \n(i)  the  establishment  of  common  criteria  and  systems  together  with  other  GMS  countries,  (ii) \nadministration and inspectorate costs in the course of the first year, (iii) design of a common logo, \n(iv) production of promotional material, and (v) computer and other equipment. \n \nGMS  Tourism  Plan.  Considerable  work  has  been  done  at  a  national  level  in  the  three \n31. \ncountries  to  develop  tourism  plans.  At  the  subregional  level,  much  of  the  background  information \nand  research  gathered  for  the  ADB-funded  Mekong-Lancang  River  Planning  Study  in  1998  is  still \nvalid. In addition, several provincial and sectoral studies have been recently published. However, a \ntourism plan for the GMS to (i) give direction and encourage tourism investment and development in \nthe  subregion;  (ii)  synchronize  development  and  investment;  and  (iii)  dovetail  national  planning  is \nneeded.  The  Project  will  support  the  preparation  of  a  GMS  tourism  plan  focused  on  updating  the \n1998 study and integrating the separate national plans into a coherent document. The plan will list \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n35\n\ninvestment needs and opportunities, constraints to growth, and proposals for further integration and \npromotion of the subregion. It will also address aspects of tourism, which particularly benefit the poor \nand help preserve the natural environment and cultural heritage of the GMS. \n \n32. \nGMS Tourism Statistics Improvement and Harmonization. Lack of statistics and research \nmaterial in all three countries makes tourism planning and project evaluation difficult. The problem of \nlimited data is compounded by nonuniformity among countries with respect to definitions, collection, \nanalysis,  and  presentation  of  statistics.  This  is  a  serious  constraint  and  creates  problems  for \npotential investors and planners. Lack of data makes it difficult to measure tourism performance and \nin  turn  the  value  of  tourism.  Making  a  meaningful  case  in  favor  of  tourism  initiatives  (such  as \nlobbying for easing restrictions of travel) is virtually impossible. The Project will support (i) organizing \nGMS  meetings  on  harmonization  of  tourism  statistics;  (ii) provision  of  computer  software  and \nhardware, and equipment to improve the collection of tourism statistics; and (iii) training of technical \nstaff  in  the  statistics  divisions  of  the  NTOs  and  the  central  statistics  offices  of  each  country  in  the \nWorld Tourism Authority\u2019s Satellite National Accounts System. \n \nDiversification of AMTA Human Resources. All employees in AMTA are of Thai origin, and \n33. \ntheir salaries are paid by the Tourism Authority of Thailand. Other GMS countries have not provided \nnational personnel to AMTA due to lack of funds, and because AMTA offices are also in Thailand. \nThis situation has created a lack of ownership of AMTA from other GMS countries and has on many \noccasions  created  the  impression  that  AMTA  was  not  defending  the  national  interests  of  all  GMS \ncountries. A broader representation from other nationalities is required among AMTA employees in \norder  to  increase  ownership  and  ensure  that  views  from  other  GMS  countries  are  appropriately \nrepresented. The Project will provide assistance for the appointment of one national officer in AMTA, \nwho will be based in the GMSPCs, with short periods of time at AMTA headquarters in Bangkok, if \ndesired. \n \n34. \nGMS Tourism Human Resource Development. The quality of personal service in tourism \nin  each  of  the  countries  needs  to  be  improved.  To  address  the  problem,  the  Project  will  support \n(i) the preparation of a training needs survey for the GMSPCs to determine the scale and nature of \npriority training required; and (ii) specific training activities involving at least two countries for certain \nkey  people  in  dealing  with  the  tourist,  such  as  immigration  and  customs  officials,  river  pilots,  and \nguides. \n \nPart D:  Implementation Assistance and Institutional Strengthening  \n \nThis  component  provides  (i)  consulting  services  for  project  management  support,  tourism \n35. \ndevelopment,  and  subregional  cooperation;  (ii)  detailed  design  and  construction  supervision  of \ntourism-related \ntourism  development;  and \n(iii) incremental administrative cost and project administration equipment. \n \n\ninfrastructure  and  pro-poor,  community-based \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36\n\nAppendix 4 \n\ninfrastructure \n\nSocial Analysis \n\nimprovements,  and  subregional  cooperation \n\n                                          SUMMARY SOCIAL AND POVERTY ANALYSIS \n                                                     \nThe  Project  will  include  subprojects  for  pro-poor  community-based  tourism  development, \n1. \ntourism-related \nfor  sustainable \ndevelopment in Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), and Viet Nam. All three \ncountries suffer from high levels of poverty, poor infrastructure, and lack of access to social services \nand  infrastructure,  particularly  in  rural  areas,  where  poverty  levels  tend  to  be  higher  than  in  urban \nareas.  Food  insecurity  levels  are  high  among  ethnic  minority  communities  in  selected  subproject \nareas  in  Cambodia  and  Lao  PDR.  A  detailed  social  and  poverty  analysis  of  the  countries  is \npresented  in  Supplementary  Appendix  B.  The  summary  initial  poverty  and  social  analysis  report \nform is shown in Table A4.1. \n \nA.  \n \n2. \nThe  project  impacts  are  expected  to  include  poverty  reduction  among  participating  ethnic \nminority communities and poor rural communities likely to be involved in community-based tourism \ndevelopment  activities  in  partnership  with  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and  government \nagencies. A stakeholder participation strategy is included in the pro-poor community-based tourism \ncomponent  of  the  Project.  A  pro-poor  ethnic  minority  participation  strategy  is  also  included,  which \nwill  apply  to  all  project  components  that  are  related  to  ethnic  minorities.  The  strategy  will  include \ncapacity building, organization, and training for activities related to increased tourism for the affected \ncommunities. The active participation of the communities will help to mitigate the potential negative \nimpacts  of  increased  contacts  with  outsiders  and  increase  their  capacities  to  benefit  from  tourism.  \nImpacts  upon  them  will  be  monitored  through  participatory  approaches.  Gender  disadvantage \namong ethnic minority women and girls, and risks associated with increased inflows of outsiders into \nsuch  communities,  particularly  for  women  and  young  people,  will  be  effectively  dealt  with  by \nstakeholder participation, organization and mobilization efforts by NGOs, and consultants working in \npartnership  with  rural  community-based  organizations,  government,  and  private  sector  entities.  A \ngender and development (GAD) strategy is included in this context. Some resettlement impacts are \nexpected  to  result  from  infrastructure  development,  including  the  upgrading  of  two  airports, \nimprovement  of  wastewater  and  sewage  treatment  and  road  improvements  in  Cambodia  and  Lao \nPDR,  and  development  of  river  piers  in  Viet  Nam.  Resettlement  plans  have  been  prepared  to \naddress  the  impacts,  in  keeping  with  the  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB).  Resettlement  plans  have  been  prepared  to  ensure  the  affected  people \nwill be able to at least restore, but preferably improve, their preproject situations. Special attention \nhas been given to ensuring socially and culturally appropriate mitigation and rehabilitation measures. \n \n3. \nThe Project will promote pro-poor community-based ecotourism in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and \nViet Nam. The Project has identified other key institutional partners along with the governments of \nthe  three  countries.  These  include  the  Netherlands  Cooperation  Agency,  the  Nam  Ha  Ecotourism \nProject  in  Louang  Namtha  in  the  Lao  PDR  supported  by  United  Nations  Education,  Scientific  and \nCultural  Organization  (UNESCO),  and  the  NGO  Developing  Remote  Indigenous  Village  Education \n(DRIVE)  in  Cambodia.  The  Project  also  tries  to  build  upon  experience  of  local  comanagement  of \nnatural resources, such as in the Khong District in Champassak Province of the Lao PDR, in order to \ndemonstrate  approaches  to  participatory  ecotourism.  The  objectives  of  the  participatory  pro-poor \necotourism  activities  are  to    (i)  enable  the  rural  poor  to  benefit  from  tourism  while  sustainably \nmanaging,  using,  and  conserving  their  natural,  cultural,  and  social  heritage;  (ii)  increase  income \nearning opportunities through sustainable tourism-related enterprises and employment opportunities; \n(iii) strengthen the participation of the poor, particularly ethnic minorities, women, and young people, \nin  organizations  for  decision  making  and  improved  interactions,  at  a  wider  level,  with  official  and \nprivate sector entities for planning and implementing activities, as well as for impact assessment; (iv) \nincrease awareness among the poor communities, women, and young people, regarding the risks of \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n37\n\ntourism development, and develop their capacity to prevent or reduce risks to vulnerable sections of \npoor communities; and (v) expand regional and international cooperation in ecotourism development \nwithin the Greater Mekong Subregion by creating at regional, national, and local levels, sustainable \nnetworks  to  promote  awareness  of  such  issues  and  enabling  the  development  of  common \napproaches to tackling such problems.  \n\n \n\n4. \nThe  Project  will  include  support  to  village,  provincial,  and  national  institutions  for  activities \nrelated to the objectives stated in paragraph 3. Training will be provided at provincial and local levels \nfor ecotourism-related skills such as tour guiding, interpretion and language, financial management, \nand establishment and management of micro enterprises. In appropriate areas, ecotourism activities \nwill be established in partnership with local community organizations, NGOs, and civil society. The \nProject  will  support  the  training  and  promotion  of  economic  activities  based  on  ecotourism, \nparticularly among ethnic minority and other poor women, in order to reduce the risks of exploitation \nof  women  and  girls  for  economic  gains  from  the  sex  trade.  Local  infrastructure  such  as  provincial \nvisitor information and guidance centers will provide information to incoming visitors regarding risks \nassociated  with  the  sex  trade,  HIV/AIDS,1  and  illegal  drug  use.  Visitor  lodgings  in  villages  will  be \ncreated  through  grants  and  credit,  to  be  operated  by  trained  local  people.  The  Project  will  set  up \nnetworks  of  information  exchange  through  a  series  of  seminars  and  workshops  at  subregional, \nnational,  and  local  levels  to  promote  the  best  practices  related  to  safe  tourism  development.  The \nestablishment  of  ecotourism  stakeholder  associations  from  the  community  level  up  will  promote \nregular interaction between women\u2019s groups, government institutions, and other private interests, in \norder to strengthen pro-poor community-oriented tourism development. Training will also be oriented \nto marketing techniques and promotion of ecotourism. Markets for different ecotourism ventures will \nbe identified as part of this overall strategy. Regular monitoring mechanisms will be included as part \nof  the  Project  in  order  to  assess  the  poverty  reduction  impacts  of  project-supported  activities  by \ncommunities themselves, as well as the extent of impacts on reduction of gender- and health-related \nrisks associated with increased tourism.  \n \nB. \n \n5. \nPoverty levels in the participating countries and in the sub project areas are high. Lao PDR \nhas  a  national  poverty  level  of  38.6%.  Most  of  the  subproject  areas  have  poverty  levels  that  are \nhigher than the national average. The province of Louang Namtha has a poverty level of 57.5% with \n70,900 poor out of a total population of 123,200. Louang Phrabang has a poverty level of 49.4% with \n195,600  poor  out  of  a  total  population  of  396,600.  Khammouan  has  a  poverty  level  of  41.6%  with \n137,700  poor  out  of  a  total  population  of  331,000.  Champassak  Province  has  a  poverty  level  of \n35.6% with 601,000 poor out of a total population of 196,800. In the project areas in the Lao PDR, \nthe average poverty level is 42.8%, significantly higher than the national average. Cambodia has a \nnational  poverty  level  of  36.0%.  Many  of  the  subproject  areas  have  high  levels  of  poverty, \nparticularly  in  the  upland  province  of  Rattanak  Kiri,  with  a  poverty  level  of  52.7%,  and  in  Stung \nTreng, with a poverty level of 35.5%. In Siem Riep town the poverty level is 33.1% and the city of \nPhnom  Penh  has  the  lowest  poverty  level  at  10.8%.  For  the  Project  area  as  a  whole,  the  poverty \naverage  amounts  to  38.5%,  higher  than  Cambodia\u2019s  national  average.  In  Viet  Nam,  the  national \npoverty  level  is  36.5%,  with  An  Giang  Province  having  a  poverty  level  of  40.6%  and  Tien  Giang \nProvince at 27.6%. For the Project in Viet Nam, the average poverty level is 34.8%, just a little lower \nthan  the  national  average.  The  three-country  poverty  level  averages  at  39.8%,  making  the  Project \neligible for classification as a poverty intervention project. \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  pro-poor  tourism  development  activities  are  expected  to  improve  incomes  of \n6. \npoor beneficiaries by 25% or more. These estimates are based on studies of the economic impacts \n\nPoverty Analysis and Impact \n\n                                                 \n1   Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome \n\n\f38\n\nAppendix 4 \n\nEthnic Minorities Analysis and Participation Program \n\nof the Nam Ha Ecotourism Project in the Lao PDR, supported by UNESCO. The project is a model \nthat  the  Project  will  replicate.  Studies  carried  out  in  October  2001  demonstrate  that,  at  the  village \nlevel,  the  total  income  from  ecotourism  amounted  to  approximately  42%  of  all  incomes.  Activities \nderived  from  such  incomes  include  sale  of  nontimber  forest  produce,  food,  and  handicrafts,  and \nprovision  of  services  to  tourists  including  guiding  and  traditional  massage.  As  a  result  of  the \nincreases  in  individual  household  incomes  and  in  village funds,  participating  communities  reported \nimproved  food  security.  Village  funds  will  be  used  to  develop  village  infrastructure  such  as  tracks \nand  improved  schools.  Individual  households  benefited  by  improving  their  food  consumption; \nimproving access to clothes, blankets, and medicines; greater investment in agricultural equipment \nand  tools;  and  increased  household  savings.  During  meetings  with  ethnic  minority  communities  in \nthe  subproject  areas,  the  community  representatives  strongly  supported  the  proposals  for \ncommunity-based tourism development. They stated that in their areas, tourism potential was high \nbut they could not exploit it due to poor infrastructure, and their own lack of training and awareness. \nThey  would  like  improved  access  to  training  in  order  to  be  able  to  diversify  their  occupations. \nWomen from  ethnic  minority  households  wanted  to  learn  how  to  make  new  handicrafts  that  would \nappeal to tourists. Young people wanted training in guiding skills, and the English language. Thus, \nthe intended beneficiaries expect tourism development to be based on the full participation of local \ncommunities, and to involve them fully in all activities, so as to bring them the maximum economic \nbenefits. They expect that this involvement can reduce poverty and food insecurity, and contribute to \nimproving their quality of life. \n \nC. \n \n7. \nThe subproject areas in Cambodia and Lao PDR have significant ethnic minority populations. \nThe  Lao  PDR  is  a  multiethnic  country.  The  definitions  used  by  the  Government  to  classify  the \npopulation groups are Lao Loum (lowland Lao), Lao Theung (upland Lao) and Lao Soung (highland \nLao).  As per this classification, the lowland Lao or Lao Loum, account for 52.5% of the population.  \nHowever,  this  definition  fails  to  capture  the  diversity  of  cultures,  languages,  social  practices, \ncustoms, and economic structures of the large variety of groups. The 1995 census categorized the \npopulation into 47 ethnicities and 4 major ethno-linguistic groups: (i) Tai Kadai, comprising the Lao \nPhutai  (66.2%);  (ii)  Austro-Asiatic,  comprising  the  Mon  Khmer  and  Viet  Muong  (0.1%);  (iii) Hmong \nYao (7.4 %); and (iv) Sino Tibetan, comprising Tibeto Burman and Hor.  In Louang Namtha the Tai \nKadai comprise 32.1%, the Austro- Asiatic 46.0%, and the Hmong Yao 15.7% of the population.  \n \n8. \nArticle  8  of  the  Lao  Constitution  adopted  in  1991  guarantees  that  the  state  will  not \ndiscriminate  against  people  on  the  basis  of  ethnicity.  The  Constitution  specifically  mentions  ethnic \nminorities  and  states  that:  (i)  the  Lao  PDR  is  a  unified  nation  with  indivisible  ethnic  groups;  (ii)  all \npower is of the people, by the people, and for the use of the multiethnic population; (iii)  the right to \nbe  owners  of  the  nation  is  exercised  by  multiethnic  peoples  and  is  guaranteed  by  the  political \nsystem; (iv) the mass organizations are the gathering point for solidarity and mobilization for citizens \nof all backgrounds and all ethnicities; (v) the state will provide a policy of unity and equality between \nethnic  groups;  (vi)  all  ethnic  groups  have  the  right  to  maintain  their  traditions  and  improve  their \nculture and that of the nation, and the state will use all means to improve the economic and social \nlevels of all groups; (viii) the economic system is for improving the living standard and spirituality of \nthe multiethnic peoples; and (ix) all Lao citizens, regardless of their sex, social position, education, \nbeliefs, or ethnicity are equal before the law. \n\n \n\n9. \nIn  1992,  a  policy  concerning  ethnic  minority  affairs  was  adopted.  It  is  the  cornerstone  of \ncurrent Lao PDR policy towards ethnic minorities. The agency that manages affairs related to ethnic \nminorities  is  the  Lao  Front  for  National  Construction  which  is  represented  at  the  provincial  and \ndistrict  levels.  The  Lao  Front  for  National  Construction  is  responsible  for  (i)  promoting  the  human \ndevelopment  of  ethnic  minority  officials;  (ii) ensuring  that  educational  opportunities  are  made \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n39\n\navailable  to  ethnic  minorities;  (iii)  promoting  and  preserving  their  cultural  traditions;  (iv)  improving \nand expanding healthcare, knowledge of reproductive heath, traditional medicine, and detoxification \nof  opium  addicted  persons;  and  (v) enhancing  the  administrative  mechanism  for  ethnic  minorities \nincluding their promotion in rural development activities by ensuring that other agencies are aware of \nthe requirements for the participation of ethnic minorities. \n\n \n10. \nThe  Lao  PDR\u2019s  5  year  plan  from  2001-2005  has  several  objectives  that  are  of  central \nrelevance  to  ethnic  minorities  in  the  project  area  and  are  related  to  poverty  reduction,  including \nsupport  for  (i) food  security,  (ii)  commercial  agricultural  production,  (iii)  rural  development, \n(iv) infrastructure development, (v) external economic relations, and (vi) access to services. In 2000 \nthe  Government  prepared  a  decentralization  plan  that  calls  for  establishing  the  province  as  the \nstrategic unit, the district as the planning unit, and the village as the implementation unit. In addition, \nvillages  are  responsible  for  data  collection  on  the  living  conditions  of  families.  The  villages  are \nsupposed to establish regular project performance monitoring systems for project implementation. \n \n11. \nThe  ethnic  minorities  have  gained  substantial  benefits  through  their  ecotourism  activities \nunder the UNESCO project in Louang Namtha which has brought them substantial benefits. Recent \nsurveys demonstrate that 25\u201370% of household incomes of participating communities were sourced \nfrom ecotourism-related activities. For some households, the contribution was even higher.  These \nactivities  need  to  be  extended  to  other  districts  in  the  province.  The  province  needs  strengthened \ncommunity  capacity  to  participate  effectively  at  local,  district,  and  provincial  levels  in  decision \nmaking, and increased economic activities and benefits from pro-poor tourism development. Future \nactivities need to concentrate on community capacity building through organization and mobilization \nof  community  groups,  training  programs  and  workshops,  gender  outreach  workshops,  teaching  of \nEnglish language and guiding skills to more ethnic minority people (including women and girls), and \nimproved  production  and  marketing  of  handicrafts.  Awareness  related  to  the  negative  impacts  of \ntourism and  community capacity to prevent such impacts need to be strengthened. \n \nThe Project will aim at the full participation of ethnic minority communities in project planning, \n12. \nimplementation,  and  benefits.  Ethnic  minority  participation  will  be  strengthened  through  the \nestablishment of village committees consisting of the village chief, deputy chief, elders, and at least \nthree  women  representatives.  These  village  committees  will  liaise  with  the  district  and  provincial \ntourism development authorities with regard to the planning of activities, training programs, revenue \nsharing,  and  use  of  village  incomes  from  pro-poor  tourism,  for  sustainable  poverty  reduction. \nRepresentatives  of  ethnic  minority  communities  will  participate  in  district-level  committees  in \nassociation  with  district  agencies  involved  in  pro-poor  tourism  development.  Such  committees  will \ncoordinate and decide matters related to planning of activities, skills development of ethnic minority \ngroups  (including  women)  for  pro-poor  tourism  development,  and  sharing  of  revenues  between \nvillage communities and district offices of tourism development. Ethnic minority representatives will \nbe  elected  to  provincial  level  associations  that  will  interact  with  each  other  and  provide  inputs  to \npolicy planning and development of pro-poor tourism in the region. \n \nD. \n \nThe Project will support rural poor women\u2019s full participation in economic activities associated \n13. \nwith development of pro-poor ecotourism. Training of women in development and running of micro \nenterprises,  identification  of  markets  and  provision  of  backward  and  forward  linkages,  women\u2019s \nparticipation in guiding tourists, community-based housing for tourists, and handicraft production are \nexpected to create alternative opportunities for poor women, and reduce risks of sexual exploitation. \nWomen  will  be  fully  involved  in  decision-making  for  ecotourism  development  at  all  levels,  through \ntheir organization, training, and awareness in all aspects of tourism development. The participation \nof the Ministry of Women and Veteran\u2019s Affairs in Cambodia, the Lao PDR women\u2019s union and the \n\nGender Analysis and Development Program \n\n\f40\n\nAppendix 4 \n\nViet  Nam  women\u2019s  union  in  the  national  steering  committees  is  important. This  will  help  to  ensure \nthat the implementation of GAD plans is effectively monitored, and GAD issues are mainstreamed in \ntourism development. At the provincial level, a subproject gender action plan will be prepared by the \nproject  implementation  unit  with  the  help  of  the  social  and  gender  specialist  and  the  community-\nbased  tourism  development  advisers.  These  plans  should  be  in  keeping  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nGender  and  Development  and  should  reflect  all  activities  related  to  promoting  women\u2019s  equitable \nparticipation in tourism development and its benefits, to be implemented in a time bound manner. All \nplans should set targets that can be monitored. \n \n The following generic  principles  should form the  basis  of  subproject-level  gender  planning. \n14. \n(i) Under part B of the Project, in order to strengthen women\u2019s participation in tourism development, \nwomen  will  form  50%  of  all  trainees  in  all  training  programs.  (ii) At  least  40%  membership  from \necotourism stakeholder associations at all levels will be women. (iii) Such women will be trained and \nwill, in turn, help in develop provincial GAD action plans, with targets that can be monitored. (iv) In \nkeeping with such action plans, they will (a) train participating communities in GAD issues related to \ntourism;  (b) help  disseminate  tourism-related  skills  particularly  among  rural  women,  and  in \nassociation  with  the  local  women\u2019s  machinery;  (c)  build  strong  village-based  women\u2019s  groups  for \nparticipation in ecotourism stakeholder associations, and for informed decision making; (d) under the \nguidance  of  the  social  and  gender  specialist  and  community-based  tourism  advisers  and \nparticipating  NGOs,  help  develop  training  and  education  programs  related  to  health  risks  of \nHIV/AIDS,  sexually  transmitted  diseases;  and  (e) design  and  implement  for  government  agencies, \nthe  private  sector,  local communities,  and  women\u2019s  groups,  awareness  and  training  programs  and \nworkshops related to the risks to women and children of trafficking, exploitation through illegal sex \nactivities, and other hazardous forms of employment.  \n \n15. \nGender outreach workshops for such training will be organized by the project implementation \nunits  under  the  guidance  of  the  social  and  gender  specialist  and  the  community-based  tourism \ndevelopment  advisers  at  provincial,  district,  and  community  levels,  involving  provincial  and  local \nofficials, and ethnic minority communities. Such workshops and training programs will aim at raising \nconsciousness  among  government  agencies,  local  authorities,  and  ethnic  minority  communities, \nregarding  (i)  gender  roles  in  the  economy  and  society,  (ii)  likely  impacts  of  tourism  on  such  roles, \nand  (iii)  the  need  to  strengthen  women\u2019s  awareness  of  pro-poor  tourism-related  opportunities  and \ntheir  capacity  to  participate  effectively  in  such  economic  activities  and  in  decision  making.  Such \nworkshops and associated gender training are expected to (i) contribute to greater awareness at all \nlevels  of  the  need  to  fully  involve  poor  women,  especially  ethnic  minority  women,  in  pro-poor \ntourism;  and  (ii)  improve  the  awareness  and  capacity  of  ethnic  minority  women  regarding  the \nimplications  of  pro-poor  tourism  development  for  their  own  livelihoods  and  communities,  and \nstrengthen broad-based opportunities for their participation.  \n\n\fTable A.4: Summary Initial Poverty and Social Analysis Report Form \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n41\n\n \n\nin \n\nPoverty \n\n \nYes \n\n \nYes \n\nidentified  as  a  National  Priority \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\n \nSector  identified  as  a  subregional  priority \nin \nPartnership \nCountry \nAgreements?  \n \nTourism  has  been  included  as  the  11th  \n\u201cflagship\u201d program for the 10 year Greater \nMekong Subregion strategic program and \nGMSPCs have recognized the potential of \nthe tourism sector to reduce poverty in the \nsubregion, if properly managed.  \n\nA. \n \nSector \nCountry Poverty Analyses?  \n \nparticipating \nGreater  Mekong  Subregion \ncountries  (GMSPCs)  recognize  that  tourism  is \ngrowing  exponentially  in  the  subregion  and  the \ndevelopment  of  pro-poor  community-based \necotourism, and pro-poor infrastructure will help \npoor  communities,  particularly  women  and \nyouth, to find employment opportunities, reduce \nnegative impacts of growth of tourism, increase \nresource  availability,  and  lead  to  broad-based \npoverty  reduction  and  improvements  in  human \ndevelopment. \n \n \nContribution  of  the  sector/subsector  to  reduce  poverty  in  Cambodia,  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic,  and  Viet \nNam:  \n \nBy  building  on  the  experience  of  partnerships  with  local  communities  (particularly  poor,  rural,  ethnic  minority \ncommunities)  to  develop  ecotourism  and  provide  local  employment  opportunities,  the  economic  benefits  of  tourism-\nbased  income  earning  opportunities  can  be  maximized  for  local  communities,  particularly  for  young  people  and \nwomen. The negative impacts of increased tourism associated with the spread prostitution, transmission of HIV/AIDS, \ntrafficking, and consumption of drugs can thus be reduced and positive community-based poverty reduction benefits \nincreased. By organizing the participating communities, the Project will promote stakeholder participation in decision-\nmaking  regarding  tourism.  It  will  help  promote  training  and  awareness  among  tourism  authorities  and  the  private \nsector regarding pro-poor and gender responsive tourism development. By providing infrastructure, including improved \nsanitation  and  roads,  the  Project  will  provide  much-needed  health  improvements,  reduce  time  spent  by  women  in \ncaring  for  sick  family  members,  improve  access  of  rural  communities  to  markets  and  health  services,  and  improve \nfacilities for cross-border workers.  \n \n \nB. \n                                                                                                                                     \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?

A resettlement framework has also been prepared because some subprojects \nhave  an  insufficient  level  of  design  to  be  able  to  identify  land  acquisition  impacts  now,  and  for \nwhich  the  selection  and  design  will  entail  a  community  participation  process.  The  framework  is \nbased on  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  and  Handbook  on  Resettlement:  A  Guide  to  Good \nPractice  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  includes  the  specific  policies  and  guidelines \nfor the process of land acquisition and resettlement. For each remaining subproject that will entail \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement,  a  resettlement  plan  will  be  prepared  by  the  National  Tourism \nAuthority  of  Lao  (NTAL)  after  detailed  design  of  each  subproject,  together  with  the  project \nmanagement units (PMUs).   \n\n \n\n2. \nScope  and  Scale  of  Resettlement.    A  full  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  for  the \nLouang Namtha airport improvement subproject, which will cause 109 families and one temple to \nbe relocated to a fully serviced site within 1 kilometer (km) of the present site due to extension of \nthe runway. \n \n3. \nThe  pro-poor  community-based tourism development subproject may require some minor \nland  acquisition  impacts  for  construction  of  small-scale  community  tourism-related infrastructure \nsuch  as  community  lodges,  guesthouses,  river  piers,  viewing  points,  and  upgrading  of  walking \ntrails.  The  selection  of  infrastructure  and  identification  of  zones  of  impact  cannot  be  done  before \nappraisal  due  to  lack  of  design  and  the  need  for  a  community  participation  process.  The \nresettlement  framework  will  guide  resettlement  planning  and  preparation  of  a  subproject \nresettlement plan for ADB approval during project implementation. \n \n4. \nA short resettlement plan may be required  for the Konglor Cave access road improvement \nsubproject, as the road passes through several villages; however, the impacts will be minimal, as \nthe road will not be widened. The zone of impact cannot be identified before appraisal because the \narea is not accessible during the rainy season. The detailed design will be undertaken during the \nfirst year of the Project and construction in the second year. The resettlement framework will guide \nresettlement  planning  and  preparation  of  a  subproject  resettlement  plan  for  ADB  approval  after \ndetailed design. \n \n5. \nNo  resettlement  plan  is  necessary  for  the  Kwangsi  Water  Falls  access  road  improvement \nsubproject, as it will not cause any land acquisition impact. In the unlikely event that land must be \nacquired, any impacts will be addressed in accordance with the framework.   \n \n6. \nPrinciples of Land Acquisition and Resettlement.  The resettlement policy framework for \nthe  Project  has  been  built  upon  the  laws  of  the  Government  of  the  Lao  People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic,  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995),  and  the  draft  national  resettlement \npolicy. 1 This  Project  will  be  bound  by  the  principles  and  conditions  stated  in  the  resettlement \nframework  that  will  be  approved  by  ADB  and  NTAL.  If  there  are  any  gaps  between  ADB  and \nGovernment  policy,  ADB  policy  supersedes.  The  principles  and  objectives  are  to  ensure  that  all \naffected persons (APs) will be compensated for their losses at replacement cost and provided with \n\n                                                 \n1   A draft national resettlement policy was prepared by the Lao PDR Government in 1995 and presented by the Science, \nTechnology and Environment Agency to the ADB Regional Workshop on National Resettlement Policy Enhancement \nand  Capacity  Building  at  ADB  headquarters  in  2002.    The  draft  policy  is  the  basis  for  a  ministerial  decree  on \nresettlement that is being prepared under the ADB loan 1867, approved on 6 December 2001 (ADB. 2001. Report and \nRecommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the  Lao  People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic for the Environment and Social Program . Manila). \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nrehabilitation measures in order to assist them to improve on, or at least maintain, their pre-project \nliving standards and income earning capacity.   \n \n7. \nAbsence of formal legal title is not seen as a barrier to inclusion in compensation measures \nand no distinction will be made between legal and illegal APs. People who are to be resettled will \nbe assisted in at least reestablishing, if not improving their former living standards, income-earning \ncapacity,  and  livelihood  production  levels.  Positive  steps  will  be  taken  to  ensure  that  poor  and \ndisadvantaged groups receive special consideration. The parameters addressed, and the manner \nin which they have been addressed, are summarized in Table A5.2. \n\nTable A5.1: Resettlement Principles and Approach Applicable to the Project \n\n \n \n \n\n \n1. \n\nPrinciple \n\nLand acquisition and \ninvoluntary resettlement \nshould be minimized. \n2.  Plans should be prepared \n\nfor compensation, \nresettlement, and \nrehabilitation of affected \npersons. \n\n3.  Community participation is \n\nassured. The APs should \nbe fully informed and \nclosely consulted on \nresettlement and \ncompensation options. \n\n4.  APs will receive fair \ncompensation for all \nlosses, including assets \nand livelihoods. \n\n5.  Resettlement planning and \nimplementation is to be an \nintegral part of subproject \ndesign. \n\n6.  Special measures will be \nincluded in the RP to \nprotect socially and \neconomically vulnerable \ngroups.  \n\n7.  APs will receive adequate \nsupport in obtaining \nreplacement land and \nlivelihood restoration \nThere will be effective \ngrievance procedures.  \n\n8. \n\n9.  Resettlement plan \n\nimplementation will be \nmonitored by the \nGovernment and ADB. \n\nApproach \nThis will be achieved through the examination of alternative alignments or variations \nin  road  and  right-of-way  widths  to  ensure  that  only  individuals  whose  movement  is \nvital to the successful implementation of the Project are affected. \nSocioeconomic  surveys  of  20%  of  affected  persons  (APs)  and  inventory  of  lost \nassets survey  of  100%  of  APs  will  be  completed.  APs  will  be  identified,  and  their \nland,  buildings  and  other  assets  enumerated.  A  resettlement  plan  will  be  prepared \nand will be revised if necessary after completion of the detailed design and detailed \nmeasurement survey. \nThe  APs  will  be  regularly  informed  about  the  Project  and  consulted  about  impacts \nand entitlements while the resettlement plan (RP) is being prepared and before it is \nimplemented. Consultations will be supplemented by a public information campaign \nthrough the media (radio and print) conducted by the project management units. A \nresettlement information booklet will also be prepared and distributed by the units to \nall stakeholders.  The booklet will include the basic features of the RP (compensation \nand  resettlement  principles,  procedures,  compensation  options,  entitlements  of  the \nAPs,  implementing  organizations,  public  cons ultation  mechanisms,  and  grievance \nprocedures).  \nAll  APs  who  will  be  identified  in  the  project-impacted  areas  as  of  the  date  of  the \ncensus  and  inventory  of  losses  survey,  will  be  entitled  to  compensation  and \nrehabilitation measures sufficient to assist them to improve or at least maintain their \npreproject living standards, income earning capacity, and production levels.   \nThe alignment selection and design processes will include environmental and social \naspects as major factors; alignments will be altered to minimize impacts on people \n(land acquisition and resettlement); subproject schedules will take into account land \nacquisition and resettlement schedules. All subproject RPs will be approved by ADB \nprior  to  project  implementation  The  compensation,  resettlement,  and  rehabilitation \nactivities will be satisfactorily completed before ADB will authorize award of contract \nof civil works under each subcomponent project. \nVulnerable  APs,  including  the  very  poor,  aged  people  without  support,  women, \ndisabled,  or  ethnic  minorities,  are  entitled  to  additional  monetary  assistance  and \nadditional relocation and special assistance as required during the transition period. \n\nResettlement areas will be developed, with land, utilities, and access. New sites will \nhave the same competitive advantages as the original. Any households affected by \nland acquisition for development of resettlement sites will be regarded as secondary \nAPs and will be compensated in the same manner as primary APs. \nMechanisms  will  be  prepared  for  hearing  and  resolving  grievances  as  early  as  RP \npreparation. \nThe  Government  will  engage  a  domestic  monitoring  agency  acceptable  to  ADB, \nunder terms of reference also acceptable to ADB, to monitor the land acquisition and \nresettlement program, and to report on it to the Government and ADB.  \n\n     \nCompensation  Issues,  Procedures  and  Definitions.  The  approach  to  land  acquisition \n8. \nand resettlement is based on the Project\u2019s social impact surveys and the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s \nrequirements  and  procedures.    People  eligible  for  compensation  are  those  who  will  experience \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n45 \n\nnegative impacts on their assets and livelihoods as a result of the Project.  APs who appear in the \nsubproject\u2019s census will be entitled to compensation and assistance.   \n \n9. \nLoss  of  land,  whether  with  legal  title  or  not,  will  be  compensated  through  land-for-land \narrangements  with  full  legal  title  to  the  new  land  (for  agricultural  land\u2013equal size and productive \ncapacity, for residential land\u2013equivalent size, and for commercial land\u2013equal size and accessibility \nto  customers).    If  APs  opt  for  cash  compensation,  the  amount  will  be  equivalent  to  the  current \nmarket value. The APs\u2019 compensation will be free from taxes, registration, and land transfer.  For \naffected  houses  and  structures,  compensation  and  assistance  (in  cash,  kind,  or  both)  will  be \nequivalent to the full replacement cost sufficient to build a house/commercial structure of the same \nsize and standard. Loss of unharvested annual crops will be compensated at current market value \nwhile perennial crops and trees will be compensated at an annual produce value multiplied by a 5 \nyear factor.  \n \n10. \nRelocating APs will receive a materials transport allowance in cash or in kind (e.g., vehicle \nand  labor)  to  transport  household  effects  and  new  and  salvageable  materials  to  new  sites.  A \nhousing  subsistence  allowance  of  KN1.2  million  for  relocating  APs  will  be  provided  during  the \ntransition.  The  allowance  is  based  on  the  labor  paid  for  rice  planting  at  KN20,000  per  day \nmultiplied by 60 days wages. The lump sum of KN1.2 million will also apply to businesses without \ntax declarations (e.g., small shops). For businesses with tax declarations, the amount will be based \non the business income tax statements that they provide, multiplied 3-6 months, depending on the \ntype  of  structure  and  estimated  time  to  rebuild  and  reestablish  business  at  the  new  site.    All \nbusinesses will be notified 3\u20134 months in advance to relocate and rebuild new business structures \nat  new  sites.    This  will  allow  businesses  to  avoid  disruption  of  operation  and  continue  operating \nwhile  they  are  rebuilding  new  structures  at  the  new  sites.    Employees  will  receive  cash \ncompensation equivalent to actual wages lost for each day they cannot work while the business is \nreorganizing. \n \n11. \nAPs  belonging  to  vulnerable  groups  including  the  very  poor,  especially  the  aged  without \nsupport, women, disabled, or ethnic minorities. These groups are entitled to an additional special \nallowance  amounting  to  KN200,000  based  on  identified  needs  and  priorities.    Households  with \nmore than one factor of vulnerability are entitled to a KN200,000 special allowance for each factor. \nFor example, households who are very poor and with elderly household head would be entitled to \nKN400,000.  In  addition  APs  will  receive  any  support  necessary  to  obtain  replacement  land  and \nresettlement.  Relocating  vulnerable  households  will  also  be  assisted  in  rebuilding  their  homes  if \ntraditional sources of community or family support are insufficient. To ensure that the special needs \nof women are addressed, the resettlement committees will include women representatives. \n \n12. \nImplementation  Arrangements.   NTAL is the Executing Agency for the Project. A project \ncoordination  unit  under  NTAL  will  be  established  wherein  one  social  specialist  and  one \nresettlement  specialist  will  work  full  time  for  the  Project.  Project  management  units  will  also  be \nestablished in the division  of communications, transport, posts and construction, and resettlement \ncommittees  will  be  created.  These  PMUs  will  be  responsible  for  the  planning  and  day-to-day \nimplementation  of  all  resettlement-related  activities.  They  will  also  work  closely  with  concerned \ngovernment  agencies  and  organizations.    The  PMUs  will  provide  monthly  reports  to  the  project \ncoordination  unit  (PCU)  and  the  PCU  will  submit  quarterly  reports  to  ADB.  Training  in \ncompensation  standards,  procedures,  entitlements,  implementation,  grievance,  and  monitoring \nprocedures  for  the  provincial,  district,  village  resettlement  committees  will  be  conducted  by  the \nPCU  and  construction  supervision  consultants.  International  and  local  resettlement  experts  from \nthe  construction  supervision  consultants  will  work  closely  with  the  PCU,  PMUs  and  affected \ncommunities, and provide capacity building to ensure that knowledge and expertise are transferred \nto the concerned agencies and to encourage participation among APs. \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n13. \nImplementation  Schedule.    Subproject  resettlement  plans  (RPs)  will  include  detailed \nimplementation  schedules  coordinated  with  the  civil  works  schedule  for  the  subproject.  All \nsubproject  RPs  will  be  reviewed  by  ADB  prior  to  project  implementation.  The  compensation, \nresettlement, and rehabilitation activities will be satisfactorily completed before ADB approves the \naward of contract of civil works under each subcomponent project. \n \n14. \nComplaints and Grievances.  The APs will be made fully aware of their rights to grievance \nand  the  procedures,  verbally  and  in  writing,  during  consultation,  survey,  and  compensation.  The \nAPs  may  present  their  complaints  to  the  concerned  local  administrative  officials  and/or  the \nresettlement committees.  The complaints will be filed first at the village level and will be elevated \nto  the  provincial  level  if  the  APs  are  not  satisfied  with  the  earlier  decisions. Local administrative \nauthorities and resettlement committees at each level will settle complaint within 15 days of their \nbeing  submitted.  The  APs  will  be  exempted  from  all  taxes,  administrative,  and  legal  fees  for \nresettlement.    \n\n \n\nincluding \n\ninformation  on \n\nimplementation, \n\n15.  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.    The  PCU  and  PMUs  are  responsible  for  the  internal \nmonitoring activities of RPs.  The PMUs and project implementation units will provide the PCU with \nmonthly  status  reports.    The  PCU  will  submit  quarterly  reports  to  ADB.  In  addition,  the PCU will \nensure that the construction supervision consultants include in their progress reports the status of \nRP \nlocation  and  number  of  people  relocated, \ncompensation amounts paid by item, and assistance provided to APs. For external monitoring and \npostevaluation  activities,  the  PCU  will  engage  a  suitable  domestic  agency  acceptable  to  ADB, \nunder  terms  of  reference  acceptable  to  ADB,  to  monitor  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nprograms. The PCU and PMU will provide the domestic agency all resettlement-related documents.  \nThe  agency  will  submit  to  the  PCU  and  ADB  quarterly  status  reports  together  with  detailed \nassessments.   \n \n16. \nCost and Budget. Adequate budgetary support will be fully committed and made available \nto  cover  the  costs  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  within  the  agreed  implementation  period. \nSubproject  RPs  will  include  the  breakdown  for  each  type  of  losses  with  corresponding  cost \nestimates  reflecting  replacement  cost  at  current  market  values.    The  cost  estimates  will  make \nadequate  provision  for  contingencies.  The  RPs  will  also  include  the  detailed  schedule  and \nprocedures related to flow of RP funds. \n \n17. \nResettlement  Frameworks  for  Cambodia  and  Viet  Nam,  and  Resettlement  Plans.

Tourists visiting the World Heritage \nSite  of  Angkor  Wat  stay  in  Siem  Reap.  Siem  Reap  has  a  very  limited  sewerage  system  and  no \nsewerage facilities treatment. The town is expanding rapidly due to the need to accommodate the \nincreasing  number  of  tourists  visiting  Angkor  Wat  and  migration  into  the  town.  The  Project  will \ndevelop (i) a sewerage system to replace an open channel serving the town on the west side of the \nSiem  Reap  River,  and  (ii)  wastewater  treatment  facilities.  The  proposed  system  will  manage \nwastewater  from  the  rapidly  increasing  number  of  hotels  and  about  20,000  residents.  All \nwastewater collected by the present sewer is disposed of into a channel. The wastewater flows into \nthe irrigation system and some of it eventually into the Tonle Sap Lake without treatment, although \nmost is distributed in the rice fields before reaching the lake.  \n \nThe proposed Project will include (i) rehabilitation of the open channel on the west side  of \n4. \nthe river as a covered sewer; (ii) new connections along the west side of town, carrying overflows \nfrom septic tanks, hotels, hospitals and private homes; (iii) separation of storm water run-off from \nseptic tank wastes by existing channels and lagoons from septic tank wastes; (iv) a new series of \nlagoons  (anaerobic  and  facultative)  to  treat  the  discharges  from  the  west  side  of  Siem  Reap; \n(v) development  of  a  system  for  the  safe  disposal  of  sludge  from  septic  tanks  and  treatment \nlagoons;  and  (vi)  discharge  of  treated  effluent  into  an  irrigation  canal.  The  project  will  be \nimplemented by the Department of Public Works and Transport of Siem Reap Province.  \n \nC. \n \n5. \nSiem  Reap  town  lies  on  the  plains  between  Tonle  Sap  Lake  (15  kilometers  [km]  to  the \nsouth)  and  the  Kulen  Mountains,  30  km  to  the  northeast.  The  plains  undulate  gently,  ranging  in \nelevation from 10 to 80 meters (m), and the town lies on generally flat land, sloping down toward \nthe lake. The soils are alluvial silts, sands, and clays deposited by floodwaters from the Siem Reap \nRiver and ancient drainage channels.  \n \n6. \nThe Siem Reap River flows through the center of the town. The quality of the surface water \nin  the  Siem  Reap  River  deteriorates  as  it  passes  through  the  town  due to septic tanks overflows \nfrom squatter houses along the riverbank. However, a recent survey by the Ministry of Environment \n(MOE)  shows  that  the  water  quality  in  the  river  (biochemical  oxygen  demand  [BOD]:  40.7 \nmilligram/liter [mg/l],  chemical  oxygen  demand  [COD]: 69.7 mg/l) still meets the required national \nstandards (BOD: 80 mg/l, COD: 100mg/l).  \n \nSiem  Reap  District  has  112,000  people;  about  37,000  of  them  live  within  the  town.  The \n7. \nprincipal  economic  activities  are  related  to  tourism,  including  hotels, guesthouses, restaurants, \nsouvenir shops, guiding, and taxi. Tourism is increasing rapidly in Siem Reap town, and the town is \nalso the center of a primarily agricultural district with rice production, cattle raising, and fishing. \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n\fAppendix 6  \n\n49 \n\n \nThe area to the west of the town, to be served by the Project, is relatively prosperous and \n8. \nincludes the old market and hospital area, and new hotels along the main road. Water quality of the \nopen channel is very poor as shown by a MOE recent survey (Table A6). \n  \n\nTable A6: Water Quality Data in the Siem Reap Channel \n\n \n\nName of Location \nWat Damnak Bridge \nAng Kropeu Village \nWattpor Village \nThe Place In front of Psar Chas  \n \n\npH (mg/l) \n6.83 \n7.15 \n6.70 \n6.74 \n  5-9 \nBOD = biochemical oxygen demand, COD =   chemical oxygen demand, mg = milligram, pH  (a \nmeasure of acidity and alkalinity).  \n\nCOD (mg/l) \n457.0 \n139.0 \n540.0 \n397.8 \n\nBOD5 (mg/I) \n195.0 \n\n260.0 \n185.6 \n<80 \n\nNational Standard \n\n72.80 \n\n<100 \n\nScreening Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n \n \n9. \nThe  proposed  site  for  the  wastewater  treatment  lagoons  is  on  the  southwest  edge  of  the \ntown on a rice paddy field. Some bushes, trees, standing water, and a few isolated houses are on \nor adjacent to the site.  \n \nD. \n \n10. \nThe Project will improve the environmental and health conditions along the existing channel \nand  the  areas  around  it.  The  office  of  health  services  in  Siem  Reap  Province  has  recorded  that \n24%  of  reported  diseases  in  the  town  are  water-related, and 42% of these could be prevented if \nwater quality is improved.  \n \n11. \nContamination of groundwater from septic tank overflows and the channel will be reduced \ndue  to  the  Project,  thus  reducing  the  risk  of  contamination  of  shallow  wells  throughout  the  area, \nwhich in many cases are located within 5 m of the channel. The safe disposal of sludge from septic \ntanks and lagoons will contribute to better environmental conditions in the rural areas where these \nare currently dumped. The Project will help reduce the incidence of waterborne diseases. \n \nThe potential negative impacts of the project include (i) disruption of households and road \n12. \nusers  while  cleaning  out  and  rehabilitating  the  channel,  and  of  hotels  and  households  while \ninstalling connections to the new sewerage system; (ii) removal of contaminated sludge from the \nchannels, which may be temporarily left lying in the streets, posing a health hazard; (iii) removal of \nillegally constructed buildings and walls, which could create conflicts with affected people; (iv) land \nacquisition which will be required for the lagoons site; (v) the site proposed for the lagoons which \nmay  contain  items  of  archaeological  importance;  (vi) discharge  of  inadequately  treated  waste \nwaters into the irrigation canals; and (vii) bad odors and flies from inadequately designed treatment \nlagoons,  affecting  nearby  households. However, appropriate practices during construction should \nminimize disturbance to households and road users, and damage to historical sites; and adequate \ndesign  for  the  sewerage  and  sewage  treatment,  allowing  for  expansion  of  the  town,  will  prevent \nany negative environmental impacts. Mitigation measures to ameliorate any negative impacts are \nsummarized in paragraphs 13\u201317. \n \n13. \nThe site selected for the lagoons of the treatment plant is an open space. Some small trees \nare  adjacent  to  an  open  channel.  No  environmentally  or  culturally  sensitive  areas  at  the  site, \nalthough during construction the contractor will take special care to preserve any historical remains \nthat  are  found.  Some  structures  illegally  encroaching  on  the  channel  structures  will  have  to  be \nremoved. A short resettlement plan has been prepared following ADB resettlement policy to ensure \nthat affected people will be compensated. \n\n\f \n\n50 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nEnvironmental Management and Monitoring Plan \n\n14. \nThe  analysis  of  channel  water  quality  has  confirmed  that  the  proposed  process  for \nwastewater treatment (lagoon system) is adequate and acceptable. To ensure that the outflows of \nthe lagoon system can be used for irrigation or can be discharged directly into public water bodies, \na  maximum  of  80  mg/l  per  BOD  and  80  mg/l  for  suspended  substances  is  recommended  for  the \neffluent discharged from the Project.  \n \n15. \nA drainage channel already exists and the proposed lagoons will be on flat open land with \nlittle  risk  of  erosion.  To  avoid  contamination  from  dredged  materials,  proper  arrangements  for \nconstruction  supervision  will  be  done  by  (i)  appointing  experienced  contractors;  (ii)  including  for \nlocal contractors a training and capacity building component on efficient project management and \nsite safety; (iii) constructing during dry season, if possible; and (iv) regularly monitoring disposal of \ndredged materials.  \n \nE. \n \n16. \nPrior  to  the  design  of  the  subproject,  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  will  be \nprepared  for  the  construction  and  operation  phases  of  the  subproject.  Environmental monitoring \nduring  operation  will  ensure  that  (i)  open  channels  receiving  wastewater  are  kept  clear  of  weeds \nand  rubbish;  and  (ii)  effluent  being  discharged  into  the  irrigation  canals  meets  the  standards,  80 \nmg/l of BOD, and 80 mg/l of suspended solids.  \n \n17. \nDuring  the  first  year  of  the  subproject  implementation,  at  least  one  international \nenvironment specialist will be recruited for 1 month and a domestic specialist will be recruited for 2 \nmonths  to  help  prepare  the  detailed  EMP.  Additionally,  an  environment  unit  will  be  established \nwithin the project implementation unit to ensure that the mitigation measures identified in the IEE \nare  complied  with  at  all  stages  of  the  subproject.  Implementation  of  the  EMP  and  proposed \nmitigation  measures  will  be  monitored  regularly  during  the  construction  and  operation  period. \nMonitoring  results  will  be  reported  in  the  progress  reports  during  project  implementation  and  be \nsubmitted to the Asian Development Bank and MOE for review.  \n \nF. \n \nThe proposed sewerage and sewage treatment subproject is unlikely to result in any direct \n18. \nsignificant adverse environmental impacts. The identified adverse effects were readily addressed \nthrough  proper  engineering  predesign  and  incorporation  of  the  identified  mitigation  measures. \nAdverse  impacts  relate  almost  entirely  to  the  construction  phase,  and  particular  attention  will  be \npaid to ensure that contractors comply with good engineering practice and avoid inconvenience to \nthe  public  during  construction. To ensure correct design and environmentally sound construction \nand operation, an EMP will be prepared prior to the design. \n \nG. \n \n19. \nThe  IEE  concluded  that  no  significant  environmental  impacts  are  expected  from  the \nproposed  subproject  and  additional  studies,  or  a  full  environmental  impact  assessment  are  not \nneeded.  After  completion  of  the  subproject,  it  will  have  positive  environmental  benefits  for  Siem \nReap town.   \n \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\nConclusions \n\n\fPROJECT COST ESTIMATES\n\nTable A7.1: Cost Estimates for Cambodia\n(US$ million)\n\nAppendix 7       51\n\nComponent\n\nA.

The committee will receive and address any issues arising from the progress of \nthe project and from financial reports, particularly from the subregional cooperation component. \nChairing of the committee will be on a revolving (by country) basis (first, Cambodia; second, Lao \nPeople\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR);  and  third,  Viet  Nam).  The  Agency  for  Coordinating \nMekong Tourism Activities will act as the secretariat of the committee. The committee will meet \ntwice a year. One of the yearly meetings will be held at the same time as the Greater Mekong \nSubregion  Tourism  Working  Group  Meeting  and  the  other  one  in  the  country  chairing  the \ncommittee that year. The committee will give policy guidance and oversee the implementation of \nthe Project through the executing agencies, the national tourism organizations in each country: \n(i) the Ministry of Tourism in Cambodia, (ii) the National Tourism Authority of the Lao PDR, and \n(iii) the Vietnam National Administration of Tourism. \n \n\n2. \nNational  Project  Steering  Committees.  These  steering  committees  will  guide  and \nsupervise  the  progress  of  each  subprojects  within  the  country.  Its  members  will  consist  of \nrepresentatives  from  the  executing  agencies,  each  implementing agency and the ministries of \nfinance  and/or  planning.  The  project  coordination  units  (PCU)  will  be  secretariats  for  these \nsteering committees. The steering committee will address any planning and coordination issues \narising  out  of  the  subproject  progress  reports.  They  will  also  consider  any  monitoring  reports. \nThey will meet at least four times per year.   \n \n3. \nProject  Coordination  Units.

The  consultants  will provide \nshort-term inputs in assisting the PCU, PMUs, and PIUs to set up cocoordinated project management \nsystems.  They  will  ensure  that  the  systems  set  up  provide  timely  and  accurate  reports  so  that \nmanagement  of  each  subproject  can \nfor  effective  design  and \nimplementation. This will include establishing and training staff in the use of financial accounting and \nreporting systems, and progress reporting. They will advise on the appropriate staffing requirements at \neach level. Their inputs will take place principally in the first few months of the project, although there \nmay be a need for a follow up mission in the second year to assess effectiveness of the systems being \napplied. \n \n7. \nInfrastructure Design and Construction Supervision Specialists. These specialists provide \nthe principal technical inputs for each subproject. The exact requirements will depend on the nature \nand technical requirements of the subproject, but broadly fall into four categories: road construction, \nairport  construction  and  rehabilitation,  port  and  pier  construction  on  the  river,  sewerage  and \nwastewater treatment, and solid waste management. The international specialists will be supported by \nlocally  recruited  consultants  who  will  provide  such  services   as  surveying,  quantity  surveying,  and \narchitecture.  The  consultants  will  support  the  PMUs  in  preparing  designs,  tender  documents,  bid \nevaluations,  construction  supervision  and  institutional  analysis,  and  financial  management  for \ninfrastructure projects. \n \n8. \nSocial  and  Environmental  Advisers.  These  advisers  will  be  required  fairly  early  on  in  the \ndesign  of  the  infrastructure  development  projects  to  prepare  any  initial  environmental  examinations \nand  environment  impact  assessments,  and  any  resettlement  plans  that  may  be  required.  These \nadvisers  should  work  with  locally  recruited  social  and  environmental  consultants  to  prepare \nenvironmental management and resettlement plans. They will need to pay a follow-up visit to assess \ncompliance with the plans during the implementation. They will liaise with and train the environmental \nand social development staff in the National Tourism Authority, so that this work may be continued as \npart of the institutional strengthening program. \n \n\n \n\n                                                                                                                                    \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n9. \nTourism  Advisers.  These  short-term  advisers  will  be  called  on  to  help  the  team  leader \ndevelop  subregional  cooperation  component  and  the  tourism  institutional  strengthening  component. \nThe following expertise may be required: specialists in tourism law, public -private partnership tourism \ndevelopment, and tourism policy and institutions, e.g., development of tourism boards. Identification of \ntraining needs and the provision of training will be an important aspect of the work of these advisers, \nhelping to develop the strengths of the National Tourism Authority. It may be possible to draw upon a \npool of expertise available to all three countries in this subregional project. \n \n10. \nPro-Poor  Community-Based  Tourism  Advisers.  The  advisers  will  consist  of  a  long-term \ncommunity  tourism  adviser  in  each  country,  who  will  liaise  between  the  community-based tourism \ninitiatives  in  each  province,  providing  guidance  and  training  and  awareness  programs  where \nnecessary.  The  community  tourism  advisers  will  help  develop  ecotourism  products,  identify \nappropriate infrastructure developments, and market the products. Where necessary, the advisers will \ncall  on  specialist  advice  from  a  pool  of  advisers  that  may  be  social  and  gender  development \nspecialists, ecotourism planners, and advisers on small and micro-business development.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12  \n\n65 \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \n\nEconomic Cost \n\n1. \nAn economic analysis  has  been  conducted for each of  tourism  infrastructure  subprojects \nand  a  community-based  ecotourism  subproject  in  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao \nPDR),  following  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of \nProjects  (1997)  and  ADB\u2019s  Framework  for  the  Economic  and  Financial  Appraisal  of  Urban \nDevelopment Sector Projects (1994). The economic analysis is undertaken by comparing the cost \nand benefits with and without the project. The without-Project scenario refers to the continuation of \nthe existing situation. The with-Project case is established by appraising the costs and benefits of \neach  subproject. The  subprojects  are  evaluated  over  a  period  of  30  years  with  no  salvage  value \nassumed thereafter. \n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe  capital  costs  and  incremental  operation  and  maintenance  costs  of  each  subproject \nhave  been  considered.  Economic  costs  have  been  derived  from  the  financial  project  costs.  All \ncosts are expressed in constant (2001) prices.  Physical contingencies of 10% have been added to \nthe base costs1 and taxes and duties have been discounted as appropriate. Economic costs were \nvalued using the domestic price numeraire but expressed in dollar currency. Tradable components \nhave  been  adjusted  to  economic  prices  using  shadow  exchange  rate  factors  (SERF) 2  and \nnontraded  components  are  valued  at  domestic  market  prices.  Appropriate  shadow  wage  rate \nfactors (SWRF) for unskilled labor have been used to reflect its opportunity costs in the context of \nwide availability of labor in the three countries.3 Incremental operation and maintenance costs have \nbeen  taken  into  account  and  added  to  capital  costs  to  obtain  the  total  economic  cost  of  the \nsubprojects for each year. \n \nB. \n \nThe  major  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  are  increased  spending  by  foreign tourists \n3. \nvisiting the  project areas.  Moreover,  environmental  and  health  benefits  will  arise from improved \nwater, sanitation, and solid waste management and different types of resource savings due to the \nactivities of the Project. \n   \n4. \nTourism Benefits. The Project will ease the constraints hampering tourism development in \nthe project areas by rehabilitating and upgrading  transportation infrastructure, i.e. airports, roads, \nand  passenger  quays, and  providing wastewater and solid waste  management services in  some \nimportant tourist destinations. The Project will also enhance the region\u2019s attractiveness by opening \nnew tour attractions that  would be  almost  inaccessible  without  the  Project.  Tourism  benefits will \narise from the Project due to increased (i) numbers of tourists visiting the  project areas, (ii) tourist \nstays in the project areas, and (iii) spending by tourists. The analysis considers mainly the benefits \nfrom foreign tourists, as in most cases, the spending of the local tourists is marginal compared with \nthat of foreign tourists.  \n \n5. \nThe  tourism  benefits  gained  by  the  subprojects  are  the  increased  net  expenditure  of  the \nforeign  tourists  and  the  multiplier  effects  on  the  country\u2019s  economy,  which  are  induced  by  the \nproject and retained by the project country.  The net expenditure of the tourists, which is estimated \nto be  30%  of  the  gross  tourists\u2019 expenditure,  is  the  tourists\u2019  overall  expenditure  on  the  tourism \nservices less the costs of providing such services. The analysis takes 50% of the project-induced \nincremental net expenditure of the tourists as the benefits arising directly from the subprojects and \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n                                                                 \n1   Excluding land and relocation cost. \n2   The SERFs are estimated at 1.11 for all three countries. \n3   The SWRF is estimated at 0.75 for Cambodia, 0.65 for Viet Nam, and 0.60 for Lao PDR. \n\n\f66 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\na factor of 0.9 is used to adjust this net expenditure to the benefits of the country after cons idering \nthe  leakage  and  multiplier  effects  of  the  tourism  benefits  in  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion.4 The \ncurrent  tourist  arrivals,  average  stay,  and  spending  in  the  subproject  area, and projections under \nwith  and  without  project  scenarios,  are  estimated  by  subproject  taking  into  account  recent \ndevelopment trends,  attractiveness of the subproject area, constraints on tourism development in \nthe  area,  and  the  impact  of  the  subproject  on  removing/releasing  the  constraints.  Details  of  the \nnumbers of  the  tourists,  their  average  stay, and  their  spending  in  the  subproject  area  and  the \ndevelopment projections are presented in Supplementary Appendix G. \n  \nIncremental  Airport  Operating  Revenues.  The  airport  operating  revenues  consist  of \n6. \nlanding  and  parking  fees,  passenger  charges,  commercial  charges,  and  other  miscellaneous \nincomes. Incremental airport operating revenues will arise from more flights and passengers using \nthe airport and higher charge rates after the project. The economic incremental operating revenues \nare derived from the financial incremental revenues.  \n \n7. \nAircraft  Operating  Cost  Savings.  Aircraft  operating  cost  savings  will  result  from  three \nairport improvement subprojects. The current length of runways allows only the YN7 (50 seats) and \nYN12 (17 seats) to operate. With improvements to runways,  the larger and more reliable ATR725 \n(70 seats), which is commonly used in  the region, will be allowed to land,  and airline operators will \nbenefit from reduced operating, repair, and maintenance costs. The aircraft operating cost savings \nare  calculated using the  typical  operating  costs  per  seat  block  hour  of  YN7  and  ATR72  aircrafts \nand  appropriate  airplane  loading  factors  derived  from  the  capacities  of  the  aircrafts,  number  of \npassengers, and projected flight schedules. \n \nVehicle Operating Cost Savings. The proposed roads leading to potential tour attractions \n8. \nunder  the  Project  are  either  clay  or  gravel  and  in  very  poor  condition.  Some  of  them  are \nimpassable  during  the  rainy  season.  Traveling  on  the  roads  is  dusty  and  unc omfortable.  The \nvehicle operations cost savings attributable to the Project  arise from (i) an overall improvement of \nroad  condition  measured  by  roughness,  and  (ii)  in  some  cases,  reduced  road  distance.  The \nforecast average traffic growth per annum is based on the recent growth of registered vehicles, the \neconomic development projection  for  the  country,  and  other  relevant  studies.  In  the  with-Project \nscenario, no additional traffic was assumed, except for  subprojects that will open a road for  year-\nround traffic.  \n \n9. \nPublic  Health  Benefits.  Water-related  diseases  and  health  problems  are  attributed  to \nunsanitary conditions, including the contamination of groundwater by wastewater. The Project, by \nproviding proper sewage and sewerage treatment facilities, will enable wastewater collection and \ntreatment and subsequently reduce the incidence of waterborne diseases. The benefits counted in \nthe economic analysis are only the government savings from hospital and health service spending \nand household\u2019s savings on expenditure on medical care. The without-Project case has assumed a \ncontinuing  deterioration  of  the  unsanitary  situation,  and  therefore  an  increasing incidence of  the \nwaterborne  diseases  with  increasing  government  and  household  expenditure  for  treating \nwaterborne diseases. The with-Project case has assumed a proportional reduction of the incidence \nof the waterborne diseases and therefore less government and household expenditure for treating \nwaterborne diseases.  \n \n10. \nBenefits Identified but not Valued. The analysis does not include some important benefits \nthat are difficult to value, for which data are unavailable, or that might give rise to double counting \n\n                                                                 \n4   The major assumptions and estimations in this economic analysis are made mainly based on the Mekong Lancang \nRiver Tourism Planning Study, which was completed in 1998 with ADB\u2019s support, and previous studies by ADB and \nUnited Nation\u2019s Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific. \n\n5  ATR72 is a twin-turboprop engine aircraft used for regional and short-haul routes. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12  \n\n67 \n\nunder some circumstances. The nonvalued benefits include: (i)  benefits  to  local  tourists, except \nfor the Sam Mountain environmental improvement, as the local tourists account more than 99% of \nvisitors; (ii)  positive  impact  on  economic  activities  due  to  improved  transportation  infrastructure; \n(iii) improved  accessibility  for  people  in  remote  areas  to  goods  and  services  supplied  outsides; \n(iv) travel  time  savings  due  to  the  improved  road  conditions  and  shorter  travel  distance; \n(v) improved  safety  and  reduced  incidence  of  flight  cancellations  and  diversions  due  to  better \nairport conditions; (vi) road maintenance expenditure savings due to a lower incidence of flooding; \n(vii)  reduced  flood  damage  due  to  better  drainage;  (viii)  reduced costs of removing solid waste \nfrom drains and canals; and (ix) increased productivity due to better health. \n\nResults of the Economic Analysis \n\n \nC. \n \n11. \nThe economic internal rates of return  (EIRR) has been calculated for  each of the tourism \ninfrastructure  subproject  and  one  sample  pro-poor  community-based  ecotourism  subproject  in \nLouang  Namtha,  Lao  PDR.  The  results  of  the  economic  analysis  are  summarized in  Table  A12. \nThe EIRRs as evaluated range from 13.3% to 33.4%.  \n \n\nTable 12.1: EIRRs and NPVs for Subprojects \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\nEIRR \n(percent) \n33.4 \n25.1 \n13.3 \n14.2 \n21.4 \n15.3 \n16.6 \n17.7 \n27.0 \n31.5 \n23.6 \n19.3 \n\nNPV ($ million) \n(Discounted at 12 percent) \n7.39 \n1.54 \n0.65 \n0.39 \n2.84 \n0.95 \n0.60 \n0.52 \n7.21 \n3.69 \n1.41 \n0.18 \n\n \nSubproject \nSiem Reap Wastewater Management \nAccess Road Improvement to the Genocide Memorial \nRattanak Kiri Airport Improvement \nStung Treng Airport Improvement \nAccess Road Improvement to the Kwangsi Water Falls  \nAccess Road Improvement to Konglor Cave \nLouang Namtha Airport Improvement \nAn Giang Tourist River Piers Improvement \nSam Mountain Environmental Improvement \nMy Tho Tourist River Pier Improvement \nTien Giang Environmental Improvement \nPro-poor Community-Based Ecotourism \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nD. \n \n12. \nSensitivity  analyses  have  been  undertaken  to  test  the  robustness  of  the  analysis  and  the \nconsequences of changes in the following variables: (i) 10% increase of the project cost; (ii) 10% \ndecrease of the project benefits (iii) a combination of both; and (iv) project benefits delayed by 1 \nyear. Additionally, sensitivity analyses have also been made to test the consequences of (i) tourist \ngrowth reduced by 20% and (ii) tourist expenditure reduced by 20%. The results of the sensitivity \nanalysis are summarized in Supplementary Appendix G.  \n \n13. \nThe results of the analysis show that, in most cases, the EIRRs are most sensitive to delays \nand  reductions  in  benefits.  However,  all  EIRRs  remain  over  12%  in  the  worst  possible  scenario \ntested  in  sensitivity  analysis.  The  results  show  switching  values  range  from  16%  to  644%  in  the \ncase  of  cost  increase  and  14%  to  87%  for  benefit  reduction.  All  subprojects  are  considered \neconomically viable since the EIRR exceeds the economic opportunity cost of capital and there are \nother benefits that have not been quantified due to measurement difficulties and lack of data.  \n \nE. \n \n14. \nDistribution  analyses  have  been  prepared  for  four  sample  subprojects:  (i)  Siem  Reap \nenvironmental  improvement,  in  Cambodia;  (ii)  Louang  Namtha  airport  improvement,  in  Lao  PDR; \n\nDistribution Analysis \n\n\f68 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n(iii)  Tien  Giang  environmental  improvement,  in  Viet  Nam;  and  (iv)  Louang  Namtha  community-\nbased  pro-poor  ecotourism,  in  the  analyses  were  prepared  to  assess  the  distribution  of  project \neffects among the stakeholders. The major stakeholders of the Project are (i) the Government, (ii) \nlabor, and (iii) local households. Details are presented in Supplementary Appendix G. \n  \nThe Government will gain from (i) increased tax revenue due to the incremental expenditure \n15. \nfrom  foreign  tourists, 6  (ii)  aircraft  operating  cost  savings  through  the  airport  improvement \nsubproject,  and  (iii) savings  on  hospital  and  health  services  through  environmental  improvement \nsubprojects. But the Government will lose due to overvaluation of domestic currency at the official \nexchange rate, implying the economic cost of traded inputs is higher than the financial costs by the \nextent of the SERF. The Government will also pay for the financial loss because subprojects will be \nsubsidized by the Government budget. The analyses show the governments of Cambodia and Viet \nNam will gain $2.41 million and $0.33 million, respectively from the subprojects, while the Lao PDR \nneeds  to  provide  $0.51  million  to  subsidize  the  Louang  Namtha  airport  improvement  and \necotourism subprojects ($0.20 million for airport and $0.31 million for ecotourism). \n \n16. \nLaborers will gain from the subprojects, because the wages paid by the subprojects during \nconstruction  and  the  salaries  paid  by  the  incremental  businesses  due  to  increased  tourism \nspending  exceed  the  opportunity  cost  of  labor.  This  benefit  accrues  to  unskilled  laborers.  The \nanalyses show the labor in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam will gain $1.23 million, $0.47 million \n($0.39  million  from  the  airport  and  $0.08  million  from  the  ecotourism),  and  $0.56  million, \nrespectively, from the subprojects. \n \n17. \nLocal  households  will  benefit  from  (i)  increased  numbers  and  expenditures  of  tourists, \n(ii) increased  productivity  and  reduced  medical  expenses  from  the  environment  improvement \nsubproject, and (iii) better and safer air services from airport improvement. The analyses show the \nresidents in Siem Reap, Louang Namtha, and My Tho will gain $3.75 million, $0.71 million ($0.41 \nmillion from the airport and $0.30 million from the ecotourism), and $0.52 million, respectively from \nthe subprojects. \n \n18. \nThe results of the distribution analyses indicate that the residents and labor are the major \nbeneficiaries of the subprojects. While the Government of the Lao PDR will probably subsidize the \nLouang Namtha airport and ecotourism projects, this can be justified because the projects will bring \na net economic benefit to the Louang Namtha Province, which is a poor and remote province in the \nLao PDR. \n\n                                                                 \n6   The government taxes include 10% value-added tax and 20% profit tax in Cambodia, 10% business tax and 20% of \n\nprofit tax in the Lao PDR, and 10% value-added tax and 32% profit tax in Viet Nam. \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 November 2002) \n", "Currency Unit\nKR1.00\n$1.00\n", "CAMBODIA \n\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "Riel (KR) \n$0.0003 \nKR3,835 \n", "Currency Unit\nKN1.00\n$1.00\n", "LAO PDR \n\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "Kip (KN) \n$0.00009 \nKN10,760 \n", "Currency Unit\nD1.00\n$1.00\n", "VIET NAM \n\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "Dong (D) \n$0.00007 \nD15,369.5 \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n \n\u2013  Asian Development Bank \n\u2013  Agency for Coordinating Mekong Tourism Activities \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "affected person \n(a twin-turboprop engine aircraft used for regional and short-haul \nroutes) \n", "\u2013  Department of Civil Aviation (Lao PDR) \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  United Nation\u2019s Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the \n", "executing agency \nenvironmental management plan \n", "Pacific \ngender and development \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013  Greater Mekong Subregion \n\u2013  GMS participating countries  \n\u2013 \n", "human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency \nsyndrome \nimplementing agency \ninitial environmental examination  \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Ministry of Environment (Cambodia) \n\u2013  Ministry of Tourism (Cambodia) \n\u2013  Municipality of Phnom Penh \n\u2013 \nnongovernment organization \n\u2013  National Tourism Authority of Lao PDR \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "national tourism organization \noperation and maintenance \n", "ADB \nAMTA \nAP \nATR72 \n", "DCA \nEA \nEMP \nESCAP \n", "GAD \nGMS \nGMSPC \nHIV/AIDS \n", "IA \nIEE \nLao PDR \nMOE \nMOT \nMPP \nNGO \nNTAL \nNTO \nO&M \n", "PATA \nPCU \nPIU  \nPMU \nPPC \nPPMS \nSERF \nSOE \nSSCA \nSWRF \nTA \nTAT \nTMPB \nTWG \nUNDP \nUNESCO \n", "VNAT  \nWTO \n", "(i) \n", " \n(ii) \n", " \n \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n", "\u2013  Pacific Asia Travel Association \n\u2013 \nproject coordination unit \n\u2013 \nproject implementation unit \n\u2013 \nproject management unit \n\u2013 \nprovincial people\u2019s committee (Viet Nam) \nproject performance monitoring system \n\u2013 \nshadow exchange rate factor \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nstatement of expenditure \n\u2013  State Secretariat of Civil Aviation (Cambodia) \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  United Nations Development Programme \n\u2013  United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization \n\u2013  Vietnam National Administration of Tourism \n\u2013  World Tourism Organization \n", "shadow wage rate factor \ntechnical assistance \nTourism Authority of Thailand \ntourism marketing and promotion board \nTourism Working Group \n", "NOTES \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government of Lao PDR ends on 30 September, and \nthat of the Governments of Cambodia and Viet Nam on 31 December.
