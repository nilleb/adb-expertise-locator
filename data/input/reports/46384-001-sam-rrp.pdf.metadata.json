It  has  limited  natural  resources,  a  narrow  economic  base,  is  isolated  and  poorly \nconnected, and is highly vulnerable to external shocks \u2013 such as global economic changes and \nnatural  disasters.  These  factors  have  constrained  economic  growth  and  contributed  to  a  high \ndegree of volatility  in economic performance. As a result, the economy has a high reliance on \nremittances and development assistance to underpin steadfast and sustained growth.  \n \n4. \nThe government has demonstrated a strong commitment to doing what is necessary to \ngenerate sustainable economic growth. Since the 1990s, it has made considerable progress in \ndeveloping  and  implementing  policy,  legal,  and  structural  reforms  designed  to  strengthen \ninstitutions; \nfor  private  sector \ndevelopment;  improve  the  performance of  state-owned enterprises  (SOEs); strengthen  budget \nprocesses; and tighten expenditure controls.2 In 2008, this culminated in the launch of phase 1 \nof  the  public  financial  management  reform  plan  (PFMRP),  which  aims  to  strengthen  public \nfinancial  management  systems  to  promote  the  efficient  use  of  resources  for  the  public  good. \nPhase 1 was completed in early 2011; phase 2 is underway and expected to end in late 2014.  \n \n5. \nfor \nmacroeconomic  stability,  its  outward  orientation,  prudent  fiscal  policy,  and  investment  in \ninfrastructure helped the economy grow by nearly 4.0% per annum in the decade leading up to \n2008. During fiscal year (FY) 2008, the fiscal deficit was 1.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) \nwhile  public  debt  was  well  within  the  limits  of  affordability  at  35.2%  of  GDP.  Moreover,  the \ngovernment had made steady progress in achieving poverty reduction and social development \nthrough a combination of reforms and effective use of development assistance. \n \n6. \nHowever,  since  2009,  Samoa\u2019s  economy  has  been  affected  by  a  series  of  severe \nexternal  shocks.  The  global  economic  crisis  and  the  related  slowdown  in  demand  triggered  a \n\nThe  government\u2019s  perseverance \n\nreforms  necessary \n\nimplementing \n\nthe \n\nin \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Important  reforms  included  (i)  passing  two  new  acts  in  2001  (on public  financial  management,  and  management \nand  supervision  of  public  bodies);  (ii)  steering  budgeting,  accounting,  and  reporting  away  from  input-focused \napproaches  to  greater  reliance  on  outputs;  and  (iii)  starting  to  computerize  the  treasury  and  accounting,  and \ninitiating  a financial management  information system. With Asian  Development  Bank support,  in  2010 and 2011, \nthe  government  implemented  the  public  financial  management  reform  plan,  made  progress  in  liberalizing \ntelecommunications  and  privatized  SamoaTel,  revised  foreign  investment  regulations,  and  drafted  the  Personal \nProperty Securities Act. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fsharp  downturn  of  the  economy  as  tourism,  manufacturing,  and  agriculture  receipts  fell.  This \nwas  closely  followed  by  a  devastating  tsunami  in  September  2009,  which  caused  substantial \ndamage  to  infrastructure,  homes,  and  livelihoods.  The  combination  of  these  events  led  to  a \n5.1%  decline  in  GDP  in FY2009.  Reconstruction  and key  public  investments  laid the  basis for \nthe  resumption  of  growth  but  at  the  expense  of  large  deficits  and  escalating  public  debt.  In \nresponse  to  this,  the  government  embarked  on  a  program  of  reforms  aimed  at  consolidating \nfiscal  adjustment  to  strengthen the  economy\u2019s  resilience to  possible future  shocks,  particularly \nnatural  disasters.  Budget  support  from  ADB,  Australia,  New  Zealand,  and  the  World  Bank  to \nassist  the  Strategy  for  the  Development  of  Samoa  (SDS),  2012\u20132016  enabled  actions  to \nmitigate  impacts  on  the  most  vulnerable  in  society,  advance  public  financial  management  and \nSOE reforms in a difficult fiscal environment, and put in place systems to better respond to the \nfrequent natural disasters in Samoa.3  \n \n7. \nIn  December  2012,  Samoa  was  hit  by  another  natural  disaster,  tropical  cyclone  Evan, \nwhich  caused  damages  and  loss  to  the  economy,  estimated  at  more  than  $210  million  (about \n30% of GDP), damaging transport, power, water, and sanitation infrastructure, as well as school \nbuildings  and  housing.  With  the  economy  still  underperforming  after  the  earlier  shocks,  the \ngovernment turned to development partners to help deepen and extend the efforts made under \nprevious reforms, and to assist with the fiscal adjustment needed in the medium term to ensure \ndebt  sustainability.  A  key  element  of  this  has  been  the  formulation  of  the  MTFF,  linked  to  the \nJPAM, which charts a clear path to bringing the government\u2019s fiscal position to more sustainable \nlevels  over  a  period  of  3\u20135  years,  while  maintaining  aggregate  demand  and  improving \nproductivity.  The  plan  aims  at  protecting  the  economy  against  future  crises  while  laying  the \nbasis  for  sustained  economic  growth  by  (i)  helping  the  government  implement  its  structural \nreform program to improve medium-term growth prospects and (ii) adopting mitigation strategies \nto  strengthen  climate  resilience.  The  latter  include  climate-proofing  of  economic  infrastructure \nand incorporating disaster risk preparedness into the design of reconstruction investments. This \ntwo-pronged  approach  is  consistent  with  the  objectives  of  the  SDS,  which  recognizes  that  a \nfoundation  of  macroeconomic  stability,  fiscal  stability,  and  stronger  resilience  to  exogenous \nshocks is essential to restoring Samoa to a path of inclusive growth and poverty reduction.  \n \n8. \nThe  latest  shock  will  delay  the  return  to  a  more  sustainable  fiscal  position.  The  GDP \ngrowth estimate for FY2013 is 0.9%. GDP is projected to increase to 3.1% in FY2014 and 2.6% \nin FY2015  as  post-cyclone  reconstruction  starts;  but  is forecast  to  level  off  at  2.5%  thereafter. \nThe overall fiscal deficit is estimated at 6.9% of GDP in FY2013 and is projected to increase to \n8.2% \nfiscal \nsustainability;  hence  its  MTFF  sets  out  a  program  of  fiscal  adjustment  with  a  deficit  target  of \n3.5% of GDP in FY2016 (Table 1). Samoa has limited capacity to take on more debt to support \neconomic  recovery.  The  2013  World  Bank\u2013International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  Debt \nSustainability  Analysis  raised  Samoa\u2019s  debt  distress  classification  from  moderate  to  high  and \nestimated  that  any  increase  in  concessional  loans  from  development  partners  could  see  the \ndebt  to  GDP  ratio  exceeding  70%  of  GDP  by  FY2015.4 Recognizing  this,  both  ADB  and  the \nWorld Bank shifted from a mixture of 50:50 credit and grant financing to a 100% grant financing \nin June 2013. The MTFF presents a ratio of debt to GDP of 50% by FY2020.5 More broadly, in \nMay 2013, the IMF approved balance of payments support of $9 million under its Rapid Credit \n\nin  FY2014.  The  government,  however, \n\nfirmly  committed \n\nto  achieving \n\nis \n\n                                                \n3   Budget  support  refers  to  financial  assistance  that  supports  a  medium-term  program  and  is  provided  directly  and \n\nregularly to a recipient country\u2019s budget, using the country\u2019s own financial systems and budget procedures. \n\n4   International  Monetary  Fund.  2013.

Samoa: Staff Report. Washington, DC.  \n\n \nIn  the  short  term,  undertaking  a  cyclone  recovery  program  requires  a  period  of \n9. \nexpansionary  fiscal  activity  and  will,  inevitably,  add  to  the  public  debt  burden.  Public \ninvestments  will  increase  sharply,  straining  Samoa\u2019s  stressed  financial  management  systems. \nAs these investments increase, it is essential that public spending delivers value for money. In \nthe  medium  term,  Samoa  will  need  to  restore  fiscal  sustainability  and  continue  with  efforts  to \ngrow  its  private  sector.  Attempting  fiscal  consolidation  on  the  demand  side  involves \nincorporating  climate  resilience  measures  into  the  design  of  reconstruction  investments  to \nmitigate future losses and expenditure demands in the event of disasters.  \n \n\n1. \n\nGovernment\u2019s Policy Reform Matrix for Budget Support \n\n10. \nDrawing on progress made and priorities set under the PFMRP, the government, along \nwith ADB, the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), the European Union \n(EU), the IMF, the New Zealand Aid Programme, and the World Bank, agreed to the JPAM in \nMarch  2013.7 The  JPAM  prioritizes  policy  reforms  in  five  areas:  (i)  strengthening  planning,  (ii) \nenhancing  the  contribution  by  SOEs,  (iii)  improving  public  financial  management  systems, \n(iv) maintaining  overall  macroeconomic  stability  and  fiscal  discipline,  and  (v) deepening \nconsultation and engagement with stakeholders. The emphasis of the JPAM on public financial \nmanagement,  good  governance,  and  macroeconomic  management  is  fully  consistent  with  the \nSDS.  While  supporting  the  overall  objective  of  the  JPAM  but  unlike  AusAID  and  NZ\u2014which \nadopted the full JPAM\u2014ADB and the World Bank, in consultation with the government, agreed \n\n                                                \n6  International  Monetary  Fund.  2013.  Country  Report  No.  13/162.  Samoa:  Request  for  Disbursement  Under  the \n\nRapid Credit Facility. Washington, DC. \n\n7  ADB, AusAID, New Zealand Aid Programme, and the World Bank provide budget support to implement the JPAM. \nThe IMF balance of payments program has no conditionalities, and the EU provides sector budget support (water \nsector) which is not linked to the JPAM. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fto  adopt  a  subset  of  the  JPAM,  and  actions  relating  to  climate  resilience,  for  their  respective \nprograms. A copy of the JPAM is in the supplementary appendixes. \n \n11. \nDevelopment  partners  have  assisted  the  government  in  implementing  reform  priorities \nthrough  technical  advisory  support.  ADB  has  supported  SOE  reforms  and  internal  audit \nprocesses, the World Bank has supported reforms in public debt management, and the Pacific \nFinancial  Technical  Assistance  Centre  and  the  IMF  have  been  closely  involved  in  policy \ndiscussions  on  fiscal  reforms.  In  addition  to  the  program,  ADB\u2019s  support  for  implementing  the \nJPAM  continues  through  regional  technical  assistance  such  as  the  Strengthening  Public \nFinancial  Management  in  Pacific  Developing  Member  Countries 8  and  the  Private  Sector \nDevelopment  Initiative.9 All  support  from  development  partners  will  help  the  government  build \ncapacity  for  public  financial  management  and  accomplish  the  policy  actions  contained  in  the \nJPAM. \n \n12.  While the program is not a cofinancing arrangement, it is integral to a joint undertaking \nwith  other  development  partners  to  help  meet  the  JPAM-related  financing  gap  through \nindependent, policy-based budget support. In this regard, during FY2014, Australia will disburse \nabout $6.0 million and New Zealand $0.7 million as the final tranche of a 3-year budget support \nprogram.10 The World Bank approved budget support for $15.0 million in June 2013. \n \nThe program is anchored in the government\u2019s MTFF. It is structured around four outputs: \n13. \n(i) improved SOE performance by reforming corporate governance, (ii) improved public financial \nmanagement systems, (iii) improved public debt management, and (iv) recovery and resilience \nto natural disasters. The outputs will be achieved through a set of policy actions drawn from the \nJPAM and from the cyclone recovery program.  \n \n14. \nThe  program  is  part  of  a  sequenced,  medium-term  effort  to  assist  the  government  in \nstrengthening its public financial management. It builds on the results and lessons from ADB\u2019s \nprevious  assistance,  the  Economic  Recovery  Support  Program,11 and  from  ADB\u2019s  support  for \nreform  around  the  region.  The  recovery  support  program  was  completed  in  a  timely  manner. \nSome key lessons are: (i) the government must own the program; (ii) reforms must be politically \nas well as technically feasible; (iii) the program\u2019s policy actions need to be focused and take into \naccount  the  country\u2019s  context;  (iv)  stakeholders,  including  development  partners,  must \nunderstand  that  reforms  in  the  Pacific  context  can  take  time  to  become  self-sustaining;  and \n(v) \u201cchampions  for  change\u201d  contribute  to  the  success  of  policy-based  operations.12 Reforms  in \nsmall Pacific islands like Samoa cannot take place overnight. Policy reforms and policy actions \nneed to be realistic and factor in a slower pace, i.e., they cannot be too ambitious. \n \n\n                                                \n8  ADB.  2008.

Samoa  has \n27 SOEs  with  estimated  total  assets  of  $618  million.  SOEs  account  for  6%  of  GDP,  12%  of \nformal  sector  employment,  and  32%  of  public  sector  employment.  SOEs  provide  most \ninfrastructure services and operate numerous businesses, which crowds out the private sector. \nInefficient  SOEs  have  resulted  in  high  costs  of  doing  business,  thus  limiting  Samoa\u2019s \ncompetitiveness. Returns on government investment in SOEs have been low\u2014between FY2002 \nand FY2010, the average return on equity of Samoa\u2019s SOEs was 0.3% and their average return \non assets was just 0.2%.13 Poorly performing SOEs are a drain on the government\u2019s budget. \n  \n16. \nThe Public Bodies (Performance and Accountability) Act in 2001 (Public Bodies Act) and \nthe subsequent policy paper on SOE ownership, performance, and divestment established the \nprinciples by which the government places its SOEs on a commercial footing and divests non-\nstrategic  SOEs.  Progress  has  been  made  in  fostering  corporate  governance  by  moving  to \nindependent  boards  of  directors  and  capacity  development  for  potential  directors,  intended  to \nhelp  SOEs  focus  on  their  commercial  mandate.  Implementation  of  both  the  act  and  the  policy \nhas  been  slow,  primarily  due  to  limited  technical  capacity  and  the  government\u2019s  cautious \napproach to SOE divestment. Although the government\u2019s intention is to retain 100% ownership \nof the major infrastructure SOEs, policy allows private sector participation in these SOEs.  \n \n\n3. \n\nPublic Financial Management Systems Development \n\n17. \nThe  government  is  committed  to  public  financial  management  reforms.  Phase  1  of  the \nPFMRP was completed in early 2011. Its achievements included the formulation of an aid policy \nand debt management strategy, a full review of all finance sector systems and procedures, and \nthe  adoption  of  an  outcome-based  budget  with  forward  estimates.  Twelve  sector  plans  were \ncompleted,  but  most  still  needed  to  finalize  the  associated  expenditure  and  monitoring  and \nevaluation frameworks. The first phase of an institutional strengthening program for the Ministry \nof  Revenue  was  also  initiated.  The  government  is  now  implementing  phase  2  of  the  PFMRP, \nsuch  as  finalizing  the  internal  audit  strategy,  preparing  a  debt  management  reform  plan,  and \nmoving  toward  a  fully  operational  MTFF.  A  budget  performance  framework  was  introduced  in \nthe FY2012 budget seeking to better link outcomes and outputs. A small procurement division is \nnow functioning within the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and is leading procurement reforms.  \n \n\n4. \n\nStrengthening Public Debt Management \n\n18. \nOutcome  1  of  the  SDS  is  macroeconomic  stability.  To  achieve  this,  the  SDS  aims  to \ncontinue strengthening public financial management, and implementing and monitoring the debt \nmanagement strategy. It sets a target budget deficit of no more than 3.5% of GDP and a target \ndebt\u2013GDP  ratio  of  less  than  50%.  It  also  aims  to  improve  the  scores  from  the  2010  Public \nExpenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment, keep underlying inflation at 3%\u2013\n4% annually and the real exchange rate competitive, and improve the enabling environment for \naccess to credit by the private sector. The real annual GDP growth target is 3%\u20134%.  \n \n19. \nDespite  proactive  debt  management  and  a  clear  fiscal  strategy,  the  small  size  of  the \neconomy  relative to the recent  economic  and climatic  shocks  has meant  that  debt-related risk \nhas progressively increased. Since 2009, debt has risen rapidly as a result of more government \n\n                                                \n13 ADB. 2012. Finding Balance. Benchmarking the Performance of State-Owned Enterprises in Papua New Guinea. \n\nManila. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fborrowing  to  finance  development  and  capital  projects,  as  well  as  to  counter  a  series  of \nexogenous  shocks.  The  2013  World  Bank\u2013IMF  Debt  Sustainability  Analysis  for  Samoa  finds \nthat  sustainability  of  public  external  debt  is  a  major  risk,  as  evidenced  by  the  shift  in  country \nclassification  from  moderate  to  high  risk  of  debt  distress.  Careful  monitoring  and  constant \nvigilance is therefore required to restore debt levels to more manageable territory.  \n \n\n5. \n\nInvesting in Climate Resilience \n\nImproving climate resilience has important implications for public financial management. \n20. \nClimate-proofing infrastructure and homes will increase investment costs, but should reduce the \nbudgetary  burden  in future  years  if climatic shocks  occur.  Stronger  climatic  resilience will  also \nbolster  investor  confidence,  with  positive  effects  on  growth  and  revenues.  Flooding  caused \nmuch  damage  during  cyclone  Evan.  The  cyclone  and  flooding  destroyed  many  houses  and \ntemporarily  displaced  7,500  people.  The  post-disaster  needs  assessment  recommended  that \nnew  regulations  and  procedures  be  introduced  to  the  development  of  a  town  plan,  to  limit  the \nrisk for new houses built in high-risk areas. The government\u2019s home-rebuilding scheme requires \nthat new homes are built to cyclone- and flood-resilience standards.  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  intended  impact  of  the  program  is  to  achieve  long-term  fiscal  stability.  The  impact \n21. \nwill  be  assessed  against  the  achievement  of  the  government\u2019s  targets  for  fiscal  deficit  and \nexternal  public  debt.  The  outcome  of  the  program  will  be  improved  fiscal  management  with  a \nspecial  focus  on  climate  resilience.  The  program  will  be  anchored  in  a  macroeconomic \nframework that is agreed on with the IMF and aims to restore long-term fiscal sustainability. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nOutput  1:  Improved  state-owned  enterprise  performance  by  reforming  corporate \n22. \ngovernance.  SOE reforms have been implemented to  improve SOE performances. Under the \nJPAM, the government has steadily reduced the number of public servants and elected officials \non  SOE  boards  to  comply  with  the  Public  Bodies  Act.  The  government  developed  an  SOE \nperformance  framework  of  key  financial  indicators  and  established  a  reporting  mechanism  for \nMOF  monitoring  and  to  avail  reports  publicly.  One  SOE  will  be  privatized,  with  another  in  the \npipeline. Lastly, the government will review its privatization policy, taking into account a public\u2013\nprivate partnership framework being developed with World Bank support.  \n \n23. \nThe program will support three tranche 1 policy conditions: (i) 100% compliance with the \nPublic Bodies Act on board appointments by the 16 SOEs classified as public trading bodies; (ii) \napproval of the SOE performance framework; and (iii) publication of consolidated report on the \nMOF  website.  Under  the  second  tranche,  the  program  will  support:  (i)  the  approval  of  the \npublic\u2013private  partnership  framework;  and  (ii)  the  review  of  the  government\u2019s  privatization \npolicy,  including  a  time-bound  plan  for  future  SOE  divestitures.  Tranche  2  conditions  will  be \ncompleted by 31 December 2014. \n \n24. \nfinancial  management  systems.  To  continue \nstrengthening  public  financial  management  systems,  under  the  JPAM  (i)  a  PEFA  assessment \nwill be undertaken and published; (ii) a public expenditure review will be completed; (iii) a joint \nprocurement  review  will  be  completed  and  a  procurement  reform  implementation  strategy \napproved; (iv) quarterly arrears reports will be prepared and circulated; and (v) an internal audit \nstrategic plan will be implemented.  \n\nImproved  public \n\nOutput  2: \n\n6  \n\n \n\n\fThe  program  focuses  on  strengthening  the  government\u2019s  internal  audit  capacity  to \n25. \nimprove budget control, integrity, and public spending. The program initiates implementation of \nthe  approved  internal  audit  strategic  plan  by  drafting  the  workplan  and  conducting  capacity \ndevelopment  on  risk  analysis  and  performance  based  audits  and  tranche  1  policy  conditions \nhave been met.   \n \n26. \nOutput  3:  Improved  public  debt  management. The JPAM is anchored on continuing \nmacroeconomic  stability  and  fiscal  discipline  hence  supports  the  achievement  of  (i)  near-\nattainment of the FY2013 aggregate fiscal targets adjusted for post-cyclone estimates; and (ii) \nthe  near-attainment  of  a  trend  of  revenue  performance  in  3 consecutive  fiscal  years  up  to  30 \nJune 2012 of 22.5% of GDP in tax revenues and 3.7% of GDP in nontax revenues. \n \nGiven  the  deterioration  in  the  government\u2019s  debt  situation,  it  was  agreed  with  the \n27. \ngovernment  that  the  program  will  focus  on  debt  management  and  support.  The  tranche  1 \ncondition  comprises  the  update  of  the  medium-term  debt  strategy,  this  was  approved  by  the \ncabinet in June 2013. The strategy reiterates the government\u2019s commitment to targets relating \nto  levels  of  concessionality  of  new  debt  taken.  The  strategy  is  published  on  MOF\u2019s  website, \nalong with quarterly debt summary reports. As a second tranche condition, the program will help \nimplement  the  medium-term  debt  management  reform  plan,  which  sets  out  how  to  (i)  develop \npolicies and processes for issuance of government guarantees and onlending; (ii) consider the \nbest use of concessional budget support lending; and (iii) provide timely information to underpin \ndecision making.  \n \n28. \nOutput 4: Recovery and resilience to natural disasters. The program supports, as a \ntranche  1  condition,  the  government\u2019s  home-rebuilding  scheme  on  condition  that  new  homes \nwill be built to climate-resilient standards. For tranche 2, the government shall approve the Apia \nTown Plan, which will incorporate guidelines to mitigate the risk of future natural disasters and \ntheir impact on the country\u2019s fiscal situation. The town plan will have to ensure suitable zoning in \nfloodplain areas and disaster risk reduction requirements for new urban construction. As a result \nof  these  measures,  the  infrastructure  that  is  reconstructed  after  cyclone  Evan  will  be  less \nsusceptible to damage from future natural disasters, therefore reducing government\u2019s fiscal risk. \n \nD. \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n \n29. \nThe government\u2019s development financing needs for FY2014 and FY2015 are estimated \nat  $45  million,  to  be  funded  via  budget  support  from  ADB,  AusAID,  New  Zealand  Aid \nProgramme, and the World Bank.  \n \n30. \nThe  government  has  requested  a  grant  not  exceeding  $14  million  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Fund to help meet its development financing gap. The grant will be disbursed in \ntwo tranches\u2014$10 million in FY2014 and $4 million in FY2015. The tranche disbursement is in \nline with the government\u2019s request to frontload $10 million to meet a significantly higher deficit in \nFY2014 due to a much larger volume of reconstruction activities. \n \nADB  is  basing  the  size  of  its  grant  on  the  government\u2019s  reconstruction  and  recovery \n31. \nfinancing  requirements,  the  fiscal  impacts  of  implementing  the  JPAM,  and  the  level  of  budget \nsupport to be provided by other development partners. Implementation of the MTFF will support \npost-cyclone reconstruction  and growth in the  near-to-medium term  before fiscal  consolidation \nbrings  debt  down  to  sustainable  levels.  The  total  fiscal  cost  for  recovery  and  reconstruction \namounts to $166.90 million (or 24.5% of GDP) during FY2013\u2013FY2015. Of this, 18.8% of GDP \nis accounted for through creation of fiscal space, i.e., expenditure reprioritization (equivalent to \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8  \n\n \n\n7.5%  of  GDP),  donor  project  support  (equivalent  to  10.0%  of  GDP)  and  insurance  payments \n(equivalent  to  1.3%  of  GDP).  Stronger  SOE  performance,  public  financial  management \nsystems,  debt  management,  and  climate  resilience  combined  with  additional  budget  support \ngrants could generate fiscal savings of about 5.0%\u20136.0% of GDP over the next 5 years, which \nwould close the financing gap and help achieve fiscal consolidation.  Budget support will come \nfrom  ADB  ($10.00 million  in  FY2014  and  $4.00 million  in  FY2015),  AusAID  ($6.00 million  and \n$3.82 million),  New  Zealand  Aid  Programme  ($0.70 million  and  $0.80 million),  and  the  World \nBank ($15.00 million and $5.00 million).  \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n32. \nProgram management. MOF, as the executing agency, will oversee and coordinate the \ntimely implementation of agreed policy, legal, and regulatory actions. It will also be responsible \nfor  achieving  policy  reforms  and  policy  actions,  for  program  administration,  disbursements, \nmaintenance of all program records, and for reporting to the development partners on program \nimplementation  progress  and  policy  action  achievements.  The  government,  ADB,  and  other \ndevelopment partners will participate in the annual review of the PFMRP.  \n \n33. \nImplementation period and program review. The program is being implemented from \n31 March  2013  to  31 December  2015,  consistent  with  the  government\u2019s  MTFF.  Policy  and \noperational changes agreed with the government and set out in the policy matrix have been put \nin  place  from  31 March  2013  to  31 December  2014.  Reviews  will  be  conducted  through \nquarterly meetings between development partners and the government, and annually as part of \nthe  PFMRP  review  every  November.  Australia  and  New  Zealand,  as  well  as  the  EU,  also \nconduct annual joint assessments of the JPAM prior to disbursements of their budget support. \nThe assessments are shared with other development partners.  \n \n34. \nProcurement  and  disbursement.  The  proceeds  of  the  grant  will  be  disbursed  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s simplification of disbursement procedures and related requirements for \npolicy-based grants.14 The proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of items \nproduced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding items included in a list of ineligible \nitems  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources. 15  Grant  proceeds \ndisbursed against imports will require a certificate from the government stipulating that the value \nof  the  total  imports  of  Samoa,  minus  its  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports \nand imports financed under other official development assistance is greater than the amount of \nthe grant expected to be disbursed during a particular year. ADB will have the right to audit the \nuse of the grant proceeds, and to verify the accuracy of the government\u2019s certification. \n \n35. \nTranches.  The  grant  will  be  provided  in  two  tranches  and  will  become  effective  once \nADB is satisfied that all conditions for the release of the first tranche, as specified in the policy \nmatrix16 and  set  out  in  the  grant  agreement,17 have  been  complied  with.  The  second  tranche \nshall  be  disbursed  once  ADB  is  satisfied  that  all  conditions  for  its  release,  as  specified  in  the \npolicy  matrix,  are  complied  with.  Second-tranche  conditions  should  be  completed  by \n31 December 2014.  \n \n\n                                                \n14 ADB. 1998.

Local  currency  generated  from  the  grant  will  be  directed  to  the \n36. \ngovernment\u2019s bank account with the Central Bank of Samoa to allow provision of supplementary \nfinancing for the FY2014 and FY2015 budgets. \n \nProgram  performance monitoring  and  evaluation. MOF will establish a performance \n37. \nevaluation system for the program within 3 months from grant effectiveness and maintain this. \nBecause the impact of the program will be felt beyond the period of its implementation, MOF will \ncontinue monitoring program performance until the end of 2015. The information will be included \nin the program completion report to be provided by the Government of Samoa.  \n  \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nThe  program\u2019s  major  benefit  will  be  its  contribution  to  the  government\u2019s  goal  of  fiscal \n38. \nsustainability  with  stronger  climate  resilience.  The  program  will  support  a  continuation  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s  efforts \nthrough \naccelerating government reforms and contributing to more robust macroeconomic performance. \nThe  program  will  assist the government  in maintaining fiscal  stability  through  improvements  to \nSOE  performance,  public  financial  management,  and  debt  management,  and through  climate- \nproofing  of  infrastructure  and  homes.  This  will  in  turn  raise  the  quality  of  public  spending, \nalleviate the debt overhang, and strengthen Samoa\u2019s resilience to natural disasters.  \n\nfinancial  management  systems \n\nto  strengthen \n\nits  public \n\n \nEconomic and Financial \n\nA. \n\n39. \nOnce essential reconstruction requirements are met, budget restraint and strengthened \nfiscal  management  will  allow  the  government  to  lower  its  debt  burden  and  reduce  its \nvulnerability  to  fiscal  and  climatic  shocks.  Stronger  fiscal  management  will  also  help  the \ngovernment  achieve  its  external  debt  target  of  50%  of  GDP  by  FY2020,  while  reducing \nvulnerability  to  climatic  shocks.  Implementation  of  SOE  governance  reforms  will  help  improve \ntheir contribution to GDP as well as their financial performance, which will reduce the drain on \nthe government\u2019s budget (para. 15). \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n40. \nThe  government\u2019s  ability  to  mount  a  major  reconstruction  effort,  and  thereafter \nconsolidate  public  spending,  is  integral  to  the  success  of  the  program.  The  emphasis  on \nimproving  public  financial  management  in  the  JPAM  process  demonstrates  the  government\u2019s \nstrong commitment to managing public spending credibly and effectively, and to restoring fiscal \nsustainability in the medium term.  \n \n41. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to,  and \ndiscussed  with,  the  government  and  MOF.  Relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy \nare included in the grant agreement. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n42. \nThe  program  is  categorized  as  a  general  intervention  to  support  sustainable  economic \ngrowth  and  is  expected  to  contribute to  poverty  reduction  indirectly.18 Stronger  public  financial \nmanagement  will  contribute  to  macroeconomic  stability,  augment  aggregate  demand,  enable \neffective delivery of essential services, and improve the business environment, all of which are \n\n                                                \n18 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10  \n\nnecessary  for  inclusive  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  Measures  taken  to  strengthen  climate \nresilience will improve the capacity of the poor to withstand environmental shocks.  \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\nIn compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program is classified \n\n43. \nas category C for impacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.  \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n44.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  described  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk \nmanagement  plan. 19  Major  risks  include  weak  institutional  and  human  capacity,  a  large \nreconstruction  agenda,  vulnerability  to  further  climatic  and  economic  shocks,  and  a  changing \npolitical  environment  leading  to  limited  commitment  to  reforms.  The  program  is  designed  to \nmitigate these risks by supporting climate resilience measures and by harmonizing support from \ndevelopment  partners  in  a  focused  agenda  of  jointly  agreed  reforms.  To  meet  skills  gaps, \ngovernment staff resources will be supplemented with ongoing TA provided by ADB and other \npartners.  Political  consensus  will  be  obtained  and  sustained  through  government  ownership, \nand  leadership  of  the  JPAM  process  and  policy  dialogue  for  budget  support.  Quarterly \nmonitoring of the fiscal situation will enable the government to make necessary adjustments to \nthe budget should unanticipated shocks occur.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \n45. \nall  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the grant \nagreement. \n \n46. \nThe  government  and  the  MOF  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the \nprogram,  which  are  set  forth  in  the  grant  agreement.  The  grant  will  become  effective  after  all \nconditions  for  the  release  of  the  first  tranche,  as  specified  in  the  policy  matrix  and  set  out  in \nAttachment  2  to  Schedule  2  to  the  grant  agreement,  have  been  complied  with,  to  the \nsatisfaction of ADB. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n47. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  policy-based  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \ngrant  of  $14,000,000  to  Independent  State  of  Samoa  for  the  Public  Sector  Financial \nManagement  Program,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions  as are  substantially  in accordance  with those  set forth  in the draft grant  agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident  \n\n                                                \n19 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n30 August 2013 \n\n \n\n\f \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\n \n\nDesign Summary \nImpact \nLong-term fiscal \nstability achieved \n \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n \nAnnual budget papers \n \n \n \n\nAssumptions \nand Risks \n\nAssumptions \nGovernment maintains \nits commitment to \nmedium-term fiscal \nstrategy and fiscal \ntargets \n \nReconstruction \nproceeds in a timely \nmanner and economy \nreturns to 2%\u20133% real \ngrowth \n \nRisks \nFurther climatic or \neconomic shocks \n \nTurnover of trained staff \nin the Ministry of \nFinance  \n\nAssumptions \nGovernment fulfills its \ncommitment to \nimproving fiscal stability \n\nContinued \nimplementation of public \nfinancial management \nreform agenda  \n\n \nRisk \nStaff turnover and loss \nof needed public \nfinancial management \nskills \n\nOutcome \nImproved fiscal \nmanagement with a \nspecial focus on \nclimate resilience \n\n \nPEFA reports in 2014 \n \nAnnual IMF Article IV \nreports \n \nFY2014 budget \n \n\nPerformance Targets and \nIndicators with Baseline \n \nGovernment achieves its \nmedium-term target ratio \nof public debt to GDP of \n50% by FY2020 (FY2013 \nbaseline: 63.5% of GDP) \n \nSustainable fiscal balance \nachieved during FY2013\u2013\nFY2016, with fiscal deficit \nreduced to 3.5% of GDP \n(or less) in FY2016 \n(FY2013 baseline: overall \nfiscal deficit of 6.9% \nincluding grants) \n \n \n\n \nImprovements in the PEFA \nratings for Samoa to C+ \nfor (i) composition of \nexpenditure, classification \nof the budget, timeliness, \nvalue for money and \ncontrols in procurement \nand regularity of accounts \nreconciliation, and \noversight of aggregate \nfiscal risk from other public \nsector entities \n(2010 baseline: C); and \n(ii) multiyear perspectives \nin fiscal planning, \neffectiveness of internal \naudit, and quality and \ntimeliness of annual \nfinancial statements  \n(2010 baseline: D+)  \n \nContinued use of climate \nresilience priorities in the \ngovernment\u2019s FY2015 \npublic investment program \n(baseline: FY2014 budget \nreflects climate resilience \npriorities put forward in the \ncyclone recovery plan) \n \n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nDesign Summary \nOutputs \n1.
