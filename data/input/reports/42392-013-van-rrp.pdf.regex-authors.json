I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Government of New \nZealand, both to the Republic of Vanuatu for the Interisland Shipping Support Project. The \nreport also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) to be cofinanced by the Government \nof New Zealand for the Establishment of the Maritime Safety Administration, and if the Board \napproves the proposed loan and administration of grant, I, acting under the authority delegated \nto me by the Board, will approve the TA.1 \n \n2.  The proposed project will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of interisland shipping \nservices through provision of an integrated package of assistance.2 The project comprises two \nmajor components: (i) infrastructure investments in the capital of Port Vila and five outer islands, \nand (ii) shipping support and coordination schemes to catalyze the provision of services to \nremote noncommercial destinations using an output-based aid approach. The project will be \ncomplemented  by  associated  TA  to  improve  sector  governance  through  institutional \nstrengthening and legal and regulatory reforms, and by project management services. The \nproject and TA activities will reinforce each other so that services to remote communities \nincrease to self-sustaining levels.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Vanuatu depends on water transport as its population of about 240,000 is spread over \nan archipelago of some 60 populated islands. However, a number of sector constraints hold \nback economic growth and service delivery in Vanuatu. Inadequate infrastructure limits cargo \nand passenger movement. Unfavorable geography and poorly functioning markets make some \nservices commercially unviable. Outdated and fragmented sector governance further impedes \nservice provision. These factors restrict the development of productive rural livelihoods focused \non agriculture exports, but rural and national development can be significantly enhanced by \nimproving water transport.3 \n \n4.  The government's Priorities and Action Agenda, 2006\u20132015 and the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) country partnership strategy, 2010\u20132014 aim to reduce critical constraints to rural \naccessibility by improving transport infrastructure and services.4 The project will address the \ninfrastructure and market constraints, while associated TA will address the governance issues.  \n \n5.  Infrastructure. Inadequate wharves and jetties restrict the ability of vessels to call at \ndestinations in all weather conditions. Restricted access causes increased waiting times and \ncosts, and in some cases prevents vessels from reaching rural areas altogether. Poor facilities \nalso cause difficulties in safe loading of passengers and loss of goods because of the need to \ntransfer them by small craft to and from ships standing at sea while unable to anchor. \n \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to Vanuatu for Preparing \nthe Interisland Shipping Support Project. Manila (TA 7288-VAN). The Government of New Zealand also provided \ntechnical assistance in parallel to support project preparation. \n3  Sector Assessment (Summary): Water Transport (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n4  Government of Vanuatu, Ministry of Finance and Economic Management. 2006. Priorities and Action Agenda, \n2006\u20132015. Port Vila; ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: Vanuatu, 2010\u20132014. Manila. ", "2 \n6.  Improved infrastructure is needed to increase efficiency, allow more frequent services, \nreduce hazards, and facilitate growth. A new interisland shipping terminal in Port Vila, which is \nthe hub of the network, will eliminate a binding constraint on shipping services caused by an \nacute and worsening shortage of berths. New and rehabilitated rural jetties will improve reliable \naccess to disconnected communities and facilitate commodity exports. The enhanced safety \nbrought about by the project is particularly important for people needing health care, children \ntraveling for education, and women who usually bear the responsibility to assist them.  \n \n7.  Service provision. Vanuatu has a sufficient domestic fleet but services are not provided \nto some remote locations due to market failure and a consequent mismatch between supply and \ndemand. Shipping services are not provided due to uncertain demand in rural areas, while \ndemand is not communicated effectively due to the uncertainty of service provision. Interisland \nwater transport is therefore infrequent and unreliable. \n \n8.  The shipping support and coordination schemes will correct this mismatch through better \ninformation and competitively tendered short-term subsidies. Rural producers will be more likely \nto prepare their produce for market once voyages are guaranteed, while vessel operators will be \nmore willing to undertake voyages when cargo and passenger volumes are known. Subsidies \nare justified to help correct this market failure and trigger positive externalities. Support for \nnoncommercial destinations will catalyze rural production and increase reliability, helping to \ndevelop a sustainable market for services and commercially viable private sector operators.  \n \n9.  Improved  infrastructure  and  more  reliable  services  will  lead  to  greater  efficiencies \nthroughout the water transport sector. The direct beneficiaries will include people in the poorest \nparts of the country, although the entire country is expected to benefit from the project as the \neconomy largely depends on the water transport sector. Direct benefits of the project will include \nmore frequent and more reliable shipping services at lower cost as private sector operators take \nadvantage of new opportunities. Induced benefits will include increased agricultural production \nand better terms of trade for remote communities. The project will have important additional \nbenefits for women, who have unique needs and responsibilities for supporting family health \ncare, schooling, and income generation. By facilitating access to markets and social services, \nand  enabling  rural  populations  to  market  their  produce  and  derive  income  from  natural \nresources, the project will spur economic growth and reduce poverty.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The  impact  will  be  improved  access  to  socioeconomic  opportunities  by  people  in \nVanuatu, particularly in the national capital of Port Vila and the provinces of Malampa, Penama, \nSanma,  Shefa,  and  Tafea.  The  outcome  will  be  reliable,  safe,  and  adequately  frequent \ninterisland shipping services provided by private sector operators.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n11.  Outputs will include (i) improved water transport infrastructure in the capital and rural \nareas, (ii) shipping support and coordination schemes, and (iii) project management services for \nefficient and effective project implementation. The first two outputs are described in paras. 12-\n14. The third output is described under implementation arrangements in para. 19. These outputs \nwill be complemented by TA to enhance capacity for sector governance and maritime safety \noversight described in paras. 23\u201326. \n \n \n ", "3 \n1.  Infrastructure \n \n12.  Port Vila has insufficient domestic berths and faces the impending loss of nearly all \nremaining berths, with potentially severe consequences for national commerce. Therefore, a \nnew interisland shipping terminal will be built in Port Vila, with sufficient berthing capacity to \nsimultaneously handle the mix of conventional vessels and landing craft in the Vanuatu fleet. To \nimprove rural access, four new outer island jetties will be constructed5 and three existing outer \nisland jetties will be rehabilitated.6 All sites will have ancillary infrastructure to cater to the transit \nof  passengers  (including  market  shelters  and  separate  facilities  for  women,  men,  and  the \ndisabled) and storage for cargo transshipment.  \n \n13.  All infrastructure will be designed and built to international standards and will have an \nexpected design life of 50 years. Designs will adopt a low-maintenance strategy in recognition of \nthe risks of cyclones and earthquakes, as well as the limited capacity for maintenance on outer \nislands. Special measures will remove barriers to access by women and the disabled, and will \nensure adaptation to the effects of climate change. The government will ensure that its recurrent \nbudget for maintenance of the new and rehabilitated facilities is allocated and executed to \npreserve the assets and avoid deterioration. \n \n2.  Shipping Support and Coordination \n \n14.  Two schemes will be established. A shipping support scheme will provide subsidies for a \nfixed number of voyages at designated frequencies on otherwise commercially unviable routes.7 \nThe scheme will be based on a least-cost tender process for services to be provided by private \nsector  operators.  Under  an  output-based  approach,  subsidies  will  be  tied  to  performance, \nincluding vessel suitability, franchise areas and routes, voyage locations and frequency, and \nsubstantiation  of  voyages.  Vessels  will  be  required  to  meet  safety  standards  and  provide \nfacilities to reduce barriers to use by women. A shipping coordination scheme will appoint \npeople  in  each  province  to  promote  and  aggregate  demand,  and  communicate  needs  for \nvoyages to private sector vessel operators. Demand for services will be differentiated by gender \nand location, and services will be required to facilitate access by women. Subsidies required will \ndecline over time as routes become commercially viable. The support program is scheduled to \nbe implemented over 5 years and will be regularly reviewed during implementation.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n15.  The project is estimated to cost $26.82 million. The investment plan is in Table 1. \nDetailed  cost  estimates  by  expenditure  category  and  by  financier  are  in  the  project \nadministration manual (PAM).8  \n \n                                                 \n5  Port Sandwich (Malekula), Lolowai (Ambae), Waisisi (Tanna), and Loltong (Pentecost). \n6  Litzlitz (Malekula), Lenakel (Tanna), and Simonsen (Espiritu Santo). \n7  Initially to five destinations in Tafea and Sanma provinces.

The  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economic  Management  (MFEM)  will  be  the  executing \nagency and the Ministry of Infrastructure and Public Utilities (MIPU) will be the implementing \nagency.  The  project  management  unit  (PMU)  within  the  Public  Works  Department  will  be \nresponsible for day-to-day implementation. It will be supplemented by project implementation \nassistance  fully  integrated  in  MIPU\u2019s  management  structure  consisting  of  national  and \ninternational consultants and MIPU counterpart staff. Given the MIPU's limited technical staff \nresources,  a  consulting  firm  will  be  retained  for  these  services.  At  the  request  of  the \ngovernment,  ADB  will  select  the  consultants  and  the  recruitment  will  be  conducted  in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime).  \n \n20.  Civil works for a number of procurement packages will be procured through international \ncompetitive  bidding  and  national  competitive  bidding.  All  civil  works  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n21.  Implementation arrangements are shown in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM.  \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2012\u2013December 2016 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2016   \nManagement     \n     (i)  Oversight body  Project steering committee \nDirector general of the Prime Minister\u2019s Office (chair) \nMIPU, MFEM, DSPPAC, NZMFAT, ADB (members) \n     (ii) Executing agency  MFEM   \n     (iii) Implementing agency  MIPU Department of Public Works as project manager \n     (iv) Project management unit  MIPU Department of Public Works as project manager \n     (v)  Implementation assistance  Consultants, about 7 national and 9 international staff \nProcurement       \n     (i) Civil works   ICB  2 contracts  $11.85 million \n     (ii) Civil works   NCB  5 contracts  $4.65 million \n     (iii) Shipping support   NCB  5 contracts  $1.00 million \n     (iv) Equipment  Shopping  5 contracts  $75,000 \nConsulting services       \n     (i) Implementation consultant  QCBS, FTP, 80:20  216 person-months  $3.37 million \n     (ii) Shipping support manager  ICS  120 person-months  $0.38 million \nAdvance contracting  Advance action for recruitment of consultants for implementation \nassistance. \nDisbursement  Loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements the government and ADB agree upon. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, DSPPAC = Department of Strategic Planning, Policy, and Aid Coordination, FTP = \nfull technical proposal, ICB = international competitive bidding, ICS = individual consultant selection, MFEM = Ministry \nof Finance and Economic Management, MIPU = Ministry of Infrastructure and Public Utilities, NCB = national \ncompetitive bidding, NZMFAT = New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, QCBS = quality- and cost-based \nselection. \nSource:  ADB estimates. \n \n22.  Stakeholders in project implementation include MFEM; MIPU and its departments of \nmaritime affairs, ports and harbors, and public works; other government departments concerned \n ", "6 \nwith rural development; transport services users, including passengers and freight shippers; the \nprivate sector; the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (NZMFAT); ADB; and \nother development partners. The government will form a project steering committee to oversee \nand  monitor  project  implementation,  including  policy  guidance  and  coordination,  technical \ndesign  and  tendering,  progress  reports,  and  audited  accounts.13  A  partner  harmonization \nframework will guide coordination between ADB and NZMFAT. \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n23.  Because of inadequate governance and regulation, the government is unable to ensure \nthe safe operation of vessels. MIPU nominally oversees sector governance, with safety and \nsecurity responsibilities divided between the Department of Maritime Affairs and the Department \nof Ports and Harbours. Additional responsibilities for economic regulation and international \nmatters are assigned to the Ministry of Trade, Tourism, Commerce and Industry; the Ministry of \nInternal Affairs, and MFEM. Consequently, the sector is characterized by fragmentation, a lack \nof coordination, and inconsistency between legal and regulatory instruments. There is also a \ngap in personnel and capacity, causing noncompliance with national and international standards \nfor safety and security. \n \n24.  Governance reforms and capacity development will support MIPU in restructuring its \ndepartments and strengthening its management, operations, and regulatory role. Activities will \ninclude  (i)  updating  legislation  and  providing  for  adequate  delegation  of  responsibility  and \nauthority to ensure compliance with safety regulations, (ii) drafting regulations to implement the \nnew legislation, (iii) institutional restructuring in MIPU and its departments, and (iv) training and \ncapacity development for staff assigned to new roles. An institutional development plan will be \ndeveloped to increase the participation of, and benefits to, women in the sector. The output will \nbe  improved  institutional  capacity  for  maritime  safety  compliance  including  vessel  registry, \ninspection, survey, licensing of seafarers, and administration of ports and harbors.  \n \n25.  A TA grant for the Establishment of the Maritime Safety Administration will be provided \nto reform sector governance. The TA is estimated to cost $1.50 million, of which $1.00 million \nwill be financed on a grant basis by the Government of New Zealand and administered by ADB. \nThe balance of $0.50 million will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nSpecial Fund (TASF-IV). The government will contribute $0.45 million for workshops, training, \nand  surveys  plus  $48,000  equivalent  in  kind  for  a  total  TA  budget  of  about  $2.0  million. \nImplementation arrangements and terms of reference are provided separately.14  \n \n26.  To complement the project, ADB's Private Sector Development Initiative,15 cofinanced \nby the Government of Australia, may provide TA in parallel to assess the potential for a public\u2013\nprivate  partnership  to  develop  a  slipway  to  repair  domestic  vessels.  The  government  is \nexploring options to invite private sector investment to build, own, and operate a facility.  \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n27.  Due diligence was performed in the areas of technical design; economic and financial \nfeasibility; poverty, social and gender issues; governance matters; safeguards; and risks and \nmitigating  measures.  Analyses  were  based  on  extensive  consultations  with  potential \n                                                 \n13 The composition and terms of reference of the project steering committee are in the PAM. \n14 Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance for the Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative (Phase II). Manila. \n ", "7 \nbeneficiaries in rural and urban areas, and with the government, civil society, nongovernment \norganizations, other development partners, and the private sector.  \n \nA.  Technical \n \n28.  For potential civil works, analyses covered site selection, preliminary engineering, and \ncost estimates. The technical assessment showed that a new domestic terminal in Port Vila is \nurgently required because of an acute and worsening shortage of berthing capacity and growing \ndemand for passenger and cargo handling. The assessment also identified outer island sites \nwith suitable locations and sufficient projected demand to justify provision of four new jetties and \nrehabilitation of three existing jetties. Given their remote locations, the outer island jetties will be \nbased on standard designs that use materials and techniques (such as stainless steel and \nprecast  concrete)  that  assure  initial  quality  and  minimize  maintenance.  Final  engineering \ndesigns  will  consider  the  potential  effects  of  climate  change  and  incorporate  necessary \nmeasures for adaptation. \n \n29.  For the shipping support and coordination schemes, services were found to require \nsupport on two broad routes to the farthest northern and southern islands. The hardships \ncaused by infrequent and unreliable services make support for these locations socially desirable \nbut commercially unviable because of the distances and limited demand. Analyses covered \ndemand  and  supply  projections,  operational  requirements,  and  potential  private  sector \nparticipation for the proposed shipping support scheme. Projections show that a temporary \nleast-cost subsidy would catalyze the market for services and lead to sustainability.  \n \n30.  To determine the necessary institutional reforms, analyses examined (i) the structure \nand staffing of the relevant government ministries, departments, and agencies; (ii) existing \nlegislation and regulation; and (iii) capacity for public administration. A sequential package of \nreforms  including  restructuring  and  new  legislation  was  designed  to  complement  the \ninfrastructure and service support schemes in order to improve the viability of the sector.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n31.  Economic benefits from civil works and service support include induced agricultural \ndevelopment,  lower  cargo  loss  and  spoilage,  and  easier  access  to  markets  and  services. \nBenefits from the maritime safety component include lower risk of accidents and better sector \ngovernance. Economic rates of return on civil works are 16%\u201330% for new construction, 15%\u2013\n224% for rehabilitation, and about 36% for the shipping support scheme. All analyses were \nsubjected to sensitivity testing and results were found to be robust in cases of higher costs and \nlower benefits. While components have been analyzed separately, the complementary nature of \nthe design means that the economic benefits from implementation of the overall project will \nlikely be greater than the sum of the parts.16  \n  \n32.  Financial  analyses  of  project  components  were  also  conducted.  The  government \nimposes modest charges for use of the facilities in Port Vila but not elsewhere, and none of \nthese are expected to run on a commercial basis. Accordingly, the financial rate of return on civil \nworks is negative, which is acceptable for public facilities, particularly with high economic rates \nof return. For the shipping support scheme, the financial analysis was based on the estimated \ncosts and revenues of an operator using a standard design vessel to provide services on a \n                                                 \n16 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \ntypical route. The financial analysis shows that the required subsidies are small and should \ndecline once regular services are established on the routes and economic activity increases.  \n \nC.  Governance \n \n33.  Analyses  covered  existing  and  proposed  legislation,  regulations,  and  institutional \nstructures for sector planning and administration. A reform program is required and can be \neffectively supported by TA. Vanuatu has a track record of successful reforms, and government \nsupport for a package of legal and institutional reforms as proposed is strong.  \n \n34.  A financial management assessment of MFEM, as the executing agency, and MIPU, as \nthe  implementing  agency  established  that  their  policies  and  procedures  were  clear, \nunambiguous,  and  focused  on  control  and  accounting  for  revenue  and  expenditure. \nProcurement  capacity  was  also  assessed.  Since  MFEM  and  MIPU  have  considerable \nexperience  in  implementing  external  assistance,  lessons  from  past  projects  have  been \nincorporated into the project design. Capacity development provided through TA will strengthen \nthe capacity of MFEM and MIPU for financial management and procurement. The TA will focus \non project-related expenditures and revenue collection, and on preparing and evaluating bidding \ndocuments.   \n \n35.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  including  MFEM  and  MIPU.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n36.  Analyses included an initial poverty and social assessment of the overall project. The \naffordability of transport services was also analyzed to inform the design of the shipping support \nscheme. Data disaggregated by gender and location were collected during project preparation \nconsultations,  as  reported  in  the  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy.17  Those \nconsulted were almost universally in favor of the project, perceived very few negative impacts, \nand confirmed the expected positive social impacts. Negative impacts, including the potential for \nHIV/AIDS and labor issues, were determined to be minor. Proactive strategies to increase the \nparticipation of, and benefits to, women were identified for implementation, including setting \nemployment  targets,  reducing  barriers  to  services,  and  providing  institutional  support.  The \nproject is classified as contributing to effective gender mainstreaming, and a gender action plan \nwas prepared to promote equal access and opportunities for women.18 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n37.  Potential impacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples \nwere assessed in accordance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). Civil works as \nproposed  will  not  result  in  any  significant  adverse  environmental  impact,  and  all  potential \nenvironmental impacts can be adequately mitigated and monitored. An initial environmental \nexamination incorporating an environmental management and monitoring plan was prepared for \neach  of  the  sites.19  The  government\u2019s  assessment  procedure  is  compatible  with  ADB\u2019s \n                                                 \n17  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19  Initial Environmental Examinations (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  requirements.  The  project  is  classified  as  environment \ncategory B. \n \n38.  The  project  is  not  expected  to  require  involuntary  resettlement  or  involuntary  land \nacquisition, as nearly all works will be at the same locations as existing facilities and new works \nwill be carried out at sites where the minimal land required has been documented to be owned \nby the government. Minor voluntary land acquisition may be required at one or two sites. If land \nacquisition  is  required,  the  government  will  inform  ADB  and  prepare  a  resettlement  plan \naccording to relevant laws and regulations. A resettlement framework has been prepared.20 The \nproject is classified as resettlement category C. \n \n39.  Native  Melanesians,  who  comprise  the  vast  majority  of  the  population,  are  the \nindigenous people of Vanuatu. The project is not expected to have a negative impact on them. \nThe project is classified as indigenous peoples category C. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n40.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n41.  The  government,  MFEM,  and  MIPU  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the \nproject shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents.  \n  \n42.
