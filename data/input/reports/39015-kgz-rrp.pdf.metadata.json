No significant adverse environmental impact is anticipated. \n\n \nInvoluntary resettlement: Category C. \nImpact on indigenous people: Category C. \n\n \nThe  proposed  Tax  Administration  Reform  and  Modernization  Project  is  a \ncontinuation  of  support  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to \npromote  economic  growth  and  public  governance  by  improving  revenue \nadministration.  It  also  provides  follow-through  support  for  the  2004  ADB \nproject  loan  for  customs  modernization  (2113-KGZ:  Regional  Customs \nModernization  and  Infrastructure  Development  Project).  The  Project  is  in \nline with the Government\u2019s objective in its Country Development Strategy of \nintroducing  modern technology in tax  administration,  improving operations, \nand  reducing  corruption.  The  Project  will  finance  (i) the  acquisition  of \nequipment  and  software  to  develop  a  central database  and  management \ninformation  system  (MIS)  for  the  State  Committee  for  Taxes  and \nCollections (SCTC); (ii) the development of a communication infrastructure \nto  link  the  central  database  to  tax  offices;  and  (iii) the  establishment  of \nmodern  central  facilities  for  the  Large  Taxpayers  Unit  (LTU),  Bishkek  tax \noffice, taxpayer service center, and SCTC staff development center. \n \nThe  Kyrgyz  Republic  has  maintained  macroeconomic  stability  and \nachieved  steady  growth,  despite  economic  and  political  shocks.  During \n2000\u20132005,  real  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  averaged  3.9% \nand \nremained  modest  at  4.4%.  Notwithstanding  political \nuncertainties  in  2005\u20132006,  structural  reforms  continued  to  progress. \nGrowth  in  2006  is  estimated  at  about  3%,  with  inflation  remaining  below \n6%. For 2007, GDP growth is projected to be 5.5% and inflation 4.5%. \n \n\ninflation \n\n\ffacilities, \n\ninefficient  practices,  and \n\nFiscal  consolidation  has  been  an  important  component  in  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic  economy\u2019s  good  performance,  and  will  be  vital  in  sustaining  its \nachievements. The general Government fiscal deficit, which had exceeded \n9% of GDP during 1996\u20132000, declined to about 5% of GDP during 2001\u2013\n2005. Consequently, external public debt fell from 111% of GDP in 2001 to \n70%  of  GDP  in  2006.  This  fiscal  achievement  has  been  due  to  good \ncontrol  of  expenditures  and  modest  increases  in  tax  collection.  During \n2000\u20132005, \nlocal \ntax  collection  (excluding  customs  revenues  and \ngovernments) increased from 13.3% of GDP to about 15% of GDP. \n \nHowever,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  faces  the  dual  fiscal  challenges  of \nmaintaining its prudent fiscal policy to sustain macroeconomic stability and \neconomic  growth,  while  providing  for  priority  economic  and  social \nexpenditures  to  help  raise  per  capita  GDP  above  $540  and  meet  the \nMillennium Development Goals. \n \nReconciling  these  challenges  will  require  sustained  increases  in  tax \ncollection. However, tax administration is beset by inadequate equipment \nand \ninadequate  staff  skills. \nConsequently, tax collection is below potential, operations are error-ridden \nand  prone  to  corruption,  and  tax  administration  is  not  perceived  to  be \nconducive  to  business  and  private  sector  development.  SCTC  needs \nreform  and  modernization  to  install  appropriate  infrastructure,  instill  best \npractices  in  tax  administration,  reform  its  business  processes  and \nworkflows,  upgrade  its  staff\u2019s  skills,  and  ensure  that  its  operations  use \nmodern  technology.  These  would  enable  SCTC  to  (i)  increase  its \nefficiency  and  staff  skills,  thereby  improving  its  tax  collection  capacity, \ngovernance,  and  transparency;  (ii)  minimize  corruption;  and  (iii)  reduce \ncompliance costs. \n \ntax \nThe  proposed  Project  will  help \nadministration \nand \nsustained \nto \nmacroeconomic  stability.  The  outcome  of  the  Project  is  a  modern  and \nefficient  SCTC \ntax  collection.  The \naccompanying TAs will necessarily have the same impact and outcome, to \nwhich attainment they will contribute with complementary outputs. \n \nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  $12.5 million,  including \ncontingencies, taxes, and duties. \n \n\nthe  effectiveness  of \n\nthat  achieves \n\nimprovements \n\nconsolidation \n\nincrease \n\nensure \n\nfiscal \n\nin \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGrant \nGovernment \n \nTotal \nSource: Asian Development Bank \n\n($ million) \n\nTotal Cost \n10.00 \n\n2.50 \n12.50 \n\nPercent \n80 \n\n20 \n100 \n\nii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nImpact and \nOutcome \n\n \nProject \nInvestment Plan \n \nFinancing Plan \n\nProject Grant \nAmount  \n\n  \nADB  will  provide  a  grant  of  $10 million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources. \n\n\fUntil 30 September 2012 \n\n \n31 March 2012 \n\nPeriod of \nUtilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\niii\n\n \nThe Office of the Government (OG) will be the Executing  Agency. SCTC \nwill  be  the  Implementing  Agency.  A  project  steering  committee  (PSC), \nheaded  by  a  representative  from  OG,  will  be  established  to  oversee  and \ncoordinate  the  implementation  of  the  Project.  The  PSC  will  include \nrepresentatives  from  relevant  Government  agencies  and  private  sector \nstakeholders.  A  project  management  office  (PMO),  headed  by  a \ncompetitively  recruited  general  manager,  will  be  established  and  function \nunder the OG supervision. \n \nAll  services,  supplies,  and  equipment  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  be \nprocured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  Goods,  equipment,  and  materials  costing \nmore than $0.50 million will be procured through international competitive \nbidding, while those valued between $0.10 million and $0.50 million will be \nprocured through national competitive bidding.  \n \nCivil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost  more  than  the  equivalent  of \n$1 million will be carried out using international competitive bidding, while \nnational competitive bidding will be used for those valued at less than $1 \nmillion.  \n \nIn  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines,  foreign  contractors \nmay participate in bidding for national competitive contracts. \n \nAll consultants will be recruited on an individual basis in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto time), and ADB\u2019s procedures for recruiting individual consultants. \n \nThe proposed Project will promote economic growth by providing the fiscal \nspace  (i.e., increased tax  revenues)  to  maintain  macroeconomic  stability, \nwhile  providing  for  priority  economic  and  social  expenditures.  The  direct \nand  quantifiable  financial  benefits  from  the  Project  are  improvements  in \ntax  revenues  due  to  more  efficient  collection.  The  Project  will  lead  to  an \nestimated  increase  in  tax  revenues  equivalent  to  0.1%  of  GDP  in  2012 \n(compared  with  the  \u201cwithout  project\u201d  scenario).  This  will  rise  to  0.5%  of \nGDP by 2015 and remain constant thereafter. On this basis, the financial \ninternal rate of return (FIRR) of the Project is estimated to be 34%. \n \n\n \nProcurement and \nConsulting \nServices \n\n \nProject Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fHowever, this is probably a conservative estimate of the financial benefits \nfor two reasons. First, improved tax collection helps foster faster economic \ngrowth  by  contributing  to  macroeconomic  stability.  Second,  taxpayers \n(individuals  and  businesses)  will  benefit  from  SCTC  procedures  that  are \nmore efficient, which will reduce their compliance costs and facilitate their \nbusiness  operations;  and  from  improved  governance,  which  will  reduce \nthe  costs  of  corruption.  These  two  mechanisms  would  expand  the  tax \nbase,  lead  to  additional  increases  in  tax  revenues,  and  spur  growth. \nHence, the estimated FIRRs for the Project are lower bounds. \n \nBy  their  nature,  these  two  additional  benefits  cannot  be  quantified \nreasonably.  Additional  benefits  that  are  difficult  to  quantify  arise  from \nimprovements  in  social  welfare  when  the  increased  tax  revenues  are \nchanneled  to  social  and  economic  expenditures  that  assist  the  poorer \nsegments of Kyrgyz Republic society. \n \nThe  proposed  Project  does  not  have  any  unusual  technical  risks.  Risks \nduring project implementation arise mainly from (i) potential delays due to \nSCTC\u2019s  lack  of  experience  with  ADB  requirements  and  procedures, \n(ii) potential  difficulties  in  coordinating  SCTC\u2019s  central  database  with  the \ninfrastructure of other agencies, and (iii) potential difficulties of SCTC staff \nin adjusting to the new procedures and facilities. These risks are mitigated \nby  steps  taken  during  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA), \nongoing measures adopted by the Government and SCTC, the project and \nTA  design,  and  Government  assurances.  Key  SCTC  staff  received \nintensive orientation in ADB procedures during the project preparatory TA. \nDuring project implementation, internationally experienced consultants will \nprovide support and training to the PMO and SCTC to ensure equipment \nand works comply with the design requirements and ADB procedures. As \na  complement  to  the  overall  Project,  institutional  strengthening  and \nchange  management  have  been  incorporated  to  facilitate  the  adjustment \nof SCTC staff to the new framework. \n \nfor  operations  and \nRisks  could  also \nmaintenance,  and  difficulties \nin  recruiting  and  retaining  competent \ninformation and communication technology (ICT) personnel. However, the \nGovernment has provided assurances that adequate counterpart funds will \nbe  provided  during  and  after  project \nto  ensure \nsustainability.  Furthermore,  the  reform  action  plan  that  SCTC  developed \nwith  assistance  from  the  International  Monetary  Fund  calls  for  the \nintroduction of a merit-based pay system. The significant financial returns \nenvisaged with the successful implementation of the Project, which would \nenable  SCTC  to  continually  upgrade  its  operations  and  staffing,  would \nmitigate both of these risks. \n \n\ninadequate  budget \n\nimplementation \n\ninclude \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\niv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nOther  risks  include  political  shocks  that  could  reduce  the  continuity  of \npolicy, as well as political pressures that could hinder the Project\u2019s reform \nand  modernization  goals.  These  risks  are  mitigated  by  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic\u2019s  continuing  commitment  to  pursuing  macroeconomic  stability \nand  structural  reforms  under  the  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Facility \nprogram,  as  well  as  development  partners\u2019  close  attention  to  the  policy \nenvironment.  Passage  of  the  new  Tax  Code  will  also  help  establish  a \nfavorable environment for tax administration. \n \nTwo accompanying TA grants will be provided to ensure effective project \nimplementation,  build  capacity,  and  enhance  sustainability.  The  TA \nconsultants will work closely with the implementing agency, PMO, relevant \nagencies and institutions, private sector stakeholders, and ADB staff. The \nteam  leader/international  tax  administration  reform  specialist  for  the  first \nTA will be the leader of the two TAs. In that capacity, the team leader will \nwork  closely  with  the  PMO  general  manager  to  ensure  that  the  two  TAs\u2019 \nactivities  dovetail  with  the  implementation  of  the  physical  investment \ncomponent of the Project. \n \nThe proposed TA for Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building for \nTax Administration Reform is expected to cost the equivalent of $600,000. \nADB will provide a grant for $500,000 from its TA funding program, while \nthe  Government  will  finance  the  remaining  cost  equivalent  to  $100,000. \nThe  TA  will  help  SCTC  (i) build  capacity  for  modern  tax  administration \nprocedures,  (iii) establish  a  goal-setting  and  performance  management \nsystem, and (iii) establish taxpayer education and services and conduct a \npublic  awareness  campaign.  The  TA  will  finance  the  services  of  a  team \nleader/international \ntax  administration  reform  specialist  (10  person-\nmonths),  an  international  tax  administration  training  specialist  (6  person-\nmonths),  a  national  tax  administration  reform  specialist  (10  person-\nmonths),  and  a  national  tax  administration  training  specialist  (8  person-\nmonths). \n \nThe  proposed  TA  for  Business  Process  Reengineering  and  Change \nManagement for Tax Administration Modernization is expected to cost the \nequivalent of $600,000. ADB will administer a grant for $500,000 provided \nby the Government of the Republic of Korea. The Government will finance \nthe  remaining  cost  of  $100,000.  The  TA  will  help  SCTC  (i) develop  its \nstaff\u2019s skills in ICT and business analytics, (ii) undertake business process \nreengineering  of  key \nfunctions,  and  (iii) implement  a  change \nmanagement program. The TA will finance the services of an international \ntax  administration  ICT  specialist  (10  person-months),  an  international \nchange  management  specialist  (6  person-months),  a  national \ntax \nadministration  ICT  specialist  (10  person-months),  and  a  national  change \nmanagement specialist (8 person-months). \n\ntax \n\n \n\n \nTechnical \nAssistance \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fo\n71  00'E\n\no\n78  00'E\n\nKYRGYZ  REPUBLIC\nTAX ADMINISTRATION REFORM AND MODERNIZATION PROJECT\n\no\n42  30'N\n\nK A Z A K H S T A N\n\nShopokov\n\nKara Balta\n\nCHUI\n\nBISHKEK\n\nTokmok\n\nCholpon-Ata\n\nBalykchy\n\n- K u l\n\nk\n\ny\n\ns\n\ns\n\nI\n\ne  \n\nL a k\n\nKochkorka\n\nDzhergalan\n\no\n42  30'N\n\nTyup\n\nKara Kol\n\nISSYK-KUL\n\nMaimak\n\nTalas\n\nTALAS\n\nTerek Sai\n\nToktogul\n\nToktogul Reservoir\n\nKarakul\nJALAL-ABAD\n\nTash Kumyr\n\nShamaldy Sai\n\nKok Yangak\n\nKochkor Ata\n\nChaek\n\nLake Song-Kul\n\nNARYN\n\nNaryn\n\nUZBEKISTAN\n\nJalal-Abad\n\nAndizhan Reservoir\n\nUzgen\n\nKara Su\n\nOsh\n\nLake Chatyr-Kul\n\nTAJIKISTAN\n\nBatken\n\nFrunze\n\no\n38  00'N\n\nSulyukta\n\nHaidarkan\n\nBATKEN\n\nNaiman\n\nKyzyl Kiya\n\nOSH\n\nSary Tash\n\nPEOPLE'S    REPUBLIC\nOF   CHINA \n\no\n38  00'N\n\nN\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\nKilometers\n\nNational Capital\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nMain Road\n\nRailway\n\nRiver\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\no\n78  00'E\n\n0\n7\n-\n0\n4\n2\n4\n \nH\nR\n\nTAJIKISTAN\n\no\n71  00'E\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Kyrgyz Republic for the Tax Administration Reform and Modernization Project.

If  the  Board  approves  the \nproposed grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the two \nTAs. \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n \n\nA. \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\n2. \nThe  Kyrgyz  Republic  has  maintained  macroeconomic  stability  and  achieved  steady \ngrowth. Economic performance has been satisfactory under the Poverty Reduction and Growth \nFacility (PRGF) programs with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) since 2001. During 2000\u2013\n2005,  real  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  averaged  3.9%,  while  average  inflation \nremained modest at 4.4%. More recently, despite political uncertainties in 2005\u20132006, economic \nstability was maintained and structural reforms progressed. GDP growth in 2006 is estimated at \nabout 3%, with inflation at 5.6%. For 2007, growth is projected to be 5.5% and inflation 4.5%. \n \n3. \nExports have risen strongly since the late 1990s. Due mainly to the development of the \nKumtor gold mine, exports grew annually by about 10.5% during 2000\u20132005. However, because \nimport growth has been faster at 16.5%, the Kyrgyz Republic has incurred persistent trade and \ncurrent  account  deficits.  Foreign  direct  investment  and  unrequited  flows  (chiefly  remittances) \nhave  financed  these  deficits  comfortably.  Consequently,  international  reserves  have  improved \nsteadily, reaching about $817 million (4 months of imports) in 2007. \n \n4. \nThe  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  development  partners  have  approved  of  the  economy\u2019s \nperformance. First, the Paris Club granted debt relief in March 2005, reducing the present value \nof the debt owed to that group of creditors by about 60%. Second, the Kyrgyz Republic reached \nan agreement with IMF on a new 3-year PRGF arrangement in 2005. Third, having established \na  track  record  of  satisfactory  macroeconomic  performance  and  structural  reforms  under  IMF \nand  World  Bank  programs,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  qualified  in  2006  for  debt  relief  under  the \nHeavily  Indebted  Poor  Countries  (HIPC)  Initiative.  The  Government,  however,  has  declined  to \nparticipate in the initiative. \n \n5. \nBy  complementing  the  prudent  monetary  stance,  fiscal  consolidation  has  been  an \nimportant  component  in  the  economy\u2019s  strong  performance.  The  general  Government  fiscal \ndeficit,  which  had  exceeded  10%  of  GDP  during  1996\u20131999,  declined  to  about  5%  of  GDP \nduring 2000\u20132005. Consequently, external public debt fell from 111% of GDP in 2001 to 70% of \nGDP  in  2006.  This  fiscal  achievement  has  been  due  to  good  control  of  total  expenditure  and \nmodest  increases  in  tax  collection.  During  2000\u20132006,  tax  collection  (excluding  customs \nrevenues and local governments) increased from 13.3% of GDP to almost 15% of GDP. \n \n6. \nNevertheless, the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s economy continues to face economic risks arising \nfrom the limited diversification of the economy, political uncertainties, and governance problems. \nGiven these risks, a sound fiscal stance will provide an anchor for the economy. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n2 \n \n\nFiscal management, in turn, faces challenges. On one hand, fiscal deficits need to be kept \n7. \nlow  to  maintain  macroeconomic  stability  and  debt  sustainability.  For  instance,  despite  the  debt \nrelief granted by the Paris Club in 2005, debt indicators remain high. Thus, without HIPC relief, the \nratio of the present value of debt to Government revenue will exceed 200% through 2009, while \nthat of the present value of debt to exports will be almost 100% through 2009. On the other hand, \nproductive  economic  and  social  expenditures  need  to  increase  to  help  raise  per  capita  GDP \nabove  its  current  low  level  of  $540,  and  to  support  the  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  efforts  to  meet  its \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs).  \n \n8. \nReconciling  these  fiscal  challenges  will  require  a  buoyant  tax  base  and  steady \nimprovements  in  tax  collection.  Yet,  while  state  tax  collection  has  increased,  it  remains  low \ncompared with other countries in the former Soviet Union and, by some estimates, significantly \nbelow potential. For instance, a 2002 study by the European Union\u2019s Technical Assistance for \nthe  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States  (TACIS)  project  estimated  that  the  gap  between \npotential  and  actual  tax  receipts  from  the  value-added  tax  (VAT),  personal  income  tax,  profits \ntax,  and  excise  taxes  was  about  19.5%  of  GDP.  On  the  micro  level,  the  weaknesses  of  the \nKyrgyz  Republic  tax  administration  create  opportunities  for  corruption  and  barriers  to  private \nsector  development  (as  demonstrated  by  highly  negative  perceptions  in  business  surveys)  in \nthe form of inefficiencies and compliance costs. Tax policy (e.g., raising land tax rates and fully \nimposing  the  property  tax)  could  increase  tax  collection.  However,  the  consensus  is  that  tax \nrates, especially on labor income, are already too high and have contributed to the growth of the \nshadow  economy  and  tax  evasion.  Accordingly,  tax  rates  on  personal  income  and  on  profits \nhave  been  cut  from  20%  to  10%  to  foster  job  creation  and  the  legalization  of  the  informal \neconomy. These tax cuts, however, will require improvements in tax administration to offset the \npotential revenue losses. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nEfficient tax administration is based on the following principles: \n\nBecause no tax administration has sufficient resources to monitor all taxpayers, \ntax authorities need to (a) foster voluntary compliance (i.e., compliance involving \nlimited intervention by tax officials); and (b) establish strong large taxpayers units \n(LTU),  because  focusing  on  large  taxpayers  usually  yields  the  highest  net \nbenefits.  With  voluntary  compliance, \ntaxpayers  practice  self-assessment, \nwhereby they calculate their liabilities and file their returns. Officials intervene by \nproviding  information  and  services.  Self-assessment,  apart  primarily  from \neconomizing on scarce resources, helps minimize opportunities for corruption by \nreducing contact between taxpayers and tax personnel. \n\nHowever,  since  delinquent  taxpayers  are  inevitable,  effective  audits  must \ncomplement  voluntary  compliance  to  enable  prompt  detection.  Given  the  tax \nauthorities\u2019  limited  resources,  such  audits  should  be  carefully  targeted  and \nguided  by  risk  assessment  and  statistical  profiling.  Penalties  should  be \nappropriate and transparent. \n\nTo  effectively  implement  these  principles,  modern  tax  administrations  adopt \nstrategic  plans  to  guide  operations.  Strategic  plans  will  involve  (a) business \nto  streamline \nprocess \noperations, \nto  automate;  and \n(b) functional  organization\u2014to  promote  efficient  use  of  resources  through \n\nincluding  determining  which  processes \n\nreengineering\u2014a  comprehensive \n\nreview  of  how \n\n9. \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\n \n\n(iv) \n\nspecialization and eliminating duplication. Based on the strategy, functional units \nthen formulate key performance indicators to translate the overall goals into their \nspecific tasks and objectives. \n\nInformation and communication technology (ICT) upgrading, in close conjunction \nwith  institutional  reforms  and  business  process  reengineering,  can  greatly \nfacilitate  these  reforms.  For  instance,  electronic  filing  promotes  voluntary \ncompliance  and  helps  reduce  contact,  while  a  central  database  and  effective \ninformation  exchange  facilitate  audits  and  prompt  detection  of  delinquency,  and \nprovide trip wires to deter corrupt practices. \n\n \n10. \nJudged against this framework, the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s tax administration faces significant \nchallenges. An important and highly visible constraint faced by the State Committee for Taxes \nand  Collections  (SCTC,  formerly  the  State  Tax  Inspectorate)  is  its  inadequate  physical \ninfrastructure,  particularly  its  lack  of  ICT.  This  deficiency  hampers  SCTC  in  practically  all  the \nmajor tax functions: registration, filing, payments, processing, audits, and arrears management \n(Appendix 1). \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\nThe  main  operating  software,  Kyrgyzstan  Integrated  Tax  Information  System \n(KITIS),  is  only  about  40%  functional  and  is  operated  in  only  four  locations.  Of \nthe  64  subnational  tax  offices,  only  16  are  equipped  with  computers,  and  the \nminimal  computer  capacity  that  exists  is  not  used  optimally  due  to  inadequate \nstaff training in ICT skills. Consequently, most operations are manual and paper-\nbased,  and  require  multiple  encoding  of  data.  This  environment  makes \noperations prone to inefficiency, errors, data security breaches, and corruption. \n\ntwo \n\ntax  offices  are  electronically  connected \n\nOnly  LTU  and \nto  SCTC \nheadquarters,  and  the  connection  capacities  are  insufficient.  Of  LTU\u2019s  235 \nclients,  only  165  (mainly  large  businesses  in  Bishkek)  use  LTU\u2019s  full  range  of \nservices. For the others, including those outside Bishkek, services are restricted \nto  audits  due  to  infrastructure  limitations,  such  as  lack  of  reliable  mail  service, \nelectronic return filing, and network automation support. \n\nInformation  exchange  between  SCTC  and  other  relevant  agencies  (so-called \nthird  party  information),  which  is  essential  for  prompt  detection  of  delinquent \ntaxpayers and the conduct of audits, suffers from delays and inaccuracies. This \nis  the  result  of  inadequate  ICT,  as  well  as  the  lack  of  interagency  coordination. \nFor  instance,  because  exports  are  VAT-exempt  but  liable  to  profit  taxes,  SCTC \nshould access export data to verify exporters\u2019 profits. However, SCTC accesses \nonly import data and limits their use to the processing of VAT returns. \n\nThe  physical  facilities  of  tax  offices  are  generally  inadequate  in  terms  of \noperational efficiency and taxpayer services. For instance, LTU and the Bishkek \ntax  office  occupy  temporary  premises  at  the  State  Customs  Committee  (SCC), \nwhich  are  hard  for  taxpayers  to  access.  In  addition,  their  physical  layouts  are \ninconsistent with smooth workflows. \n\nThe  SCTC  also  suffers  from  inefficient  procedures  and  inadequate  staff  skills  in  the \n\n \n11. \nfollowing areas: \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n4 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\nTaxpayer registration. Measures to make it easier for taxpayers to register and \nfor SCTC to update its records could include establishment of one-stop shops for \nregistrants  and  simplification  of \nforms  and  procedures,  as  well  as \ncomputerization to facilitate recordkeeping. \n\nTaxpayer  education  and  services. Information provision is limited to one-time \ndissemination  of  amendments  to  the  Tax  Code  or  newly  issued  rules  and \nregulations. No arrangements are in place to collaborate with the private sector \nto  provide  information  on  a  continuous  basis,  which  is  vital  to  improve \ncompliance. \n\nFiling. While best practice is to make filing as convenient as possible, taxpayers \nhave  to  file  returns  at  tax  offices  before  proceeding  to  banks  to  make  their \npayments. These two steps should be combined, and electronic filing should be \nimplemented, initially for large taxpayers. \n\nPayments.  The  transfer  of  payments  information  from  the  banks  and  the  State \nSettlement  and  Savings  Company  (SSSC),  which  handles  about  70%  of  tax \npayments,  to  the  Treasury  and  on  to  SCTC  also  needs  to  be  overhauled. \nCurrently,  payment  data  are  manually  encoded,  summary  forms  are  physically \ndelivered, and data reconciliation generally is done manually and on paper. \n\nProcessing  of  returns.  The  numerical  review  of  returns  by  SCTC  staff  during \nfiling  is  contrary  to  the  goal  of  self-assessment  and  a  duplication  of  efforts. \nProcessing should be purely mechanical to use resources efficiently and reduce \ncontact between taxpayers and SCTC staff. Reviews should be carried out at the \naudit stage. \n\nAudits  and  arrears  management.  Detection  of  arrears  is  often  tardy  due  to \ninadequate ICT. Meanwhile, the law requires each taxpayer to be audited once a \nyear,  which  is  inefficient.  SCTC  should  use  risk-assessment  techniques  and \nthird-party information to undertake targeted audits. While ICT can facilitate these \ntwo procedures, SCTC staff also need training in audit procedures. \n\nFor  all  its  shortcomings,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  tax  administration  has  a  good  foundation \n\n \n12. \nfor reform and modernization, as demonstrated by the following: \n \n\nAt  the  highest  levels  of  the  Government  and  SCTC,  support  for  reform  and \nmodernization  is  strong.  In  January  2006,  a  presidential  decree  on  tax \nadministration modernization was issued. In March 2006, the SCTC prepared (in \nclose cooperation with IMF) an action plan to streamline its operations, retrench \nredundant personnel, and introduce a merit-based pay system. In October 2006, \nthe  Government,  as  part  of  the  PRGF  program,  committed  to  eliminate  local \ngovernment  interference  in  the  appointment  of  senior  management  staff  of  tax \noffices.  In  January 2007,  the  SCTC\u2019s  status  was  upgraded  from  that  of  an \nagency  to  a  ministry  equivalent.  Also  in  January,  the  Government  issued  a \nresolution  adopting  a  tax  administration  reform  strategy  consistent  with  the \nMarch 2006 action plan. \n\nThe Tax Code, drafted with substantial technical advice from IMF and the United \nInternational  Development  (DFID),  has  been \nKingdom\u2019s  Department \n\nfor \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nsubmitted  to  Parliament  and  is  expected  to  be  approved  in  2007  (a  structural \nbenchmark  under  the  PRGF  program).  The  code  (a)  simplifies  and  clarifies  tax \nlaws 1  and  procedures,  (b)  helps  improve  tax  administration,  (c)  encourages \ncompliance,  (d)  reduces  excessive  interference  by  tax  authorities  in  private \nbusiness,  and  (e)  curbs  evasion  and  fraud.  Several  features  of  the  code  were \nexpressly formulated to support tax administration reform. The code strengthens \ntaxpayer protection mechanisms and increases the period between audits. It also \nprovides the legal basis for electronic tax transactions (e.g., it allows accounting \nrecords  and  tax  reports  to  be  prepared  and  filed  electronically,  using  digital \nsignature  technology),  and  for  the  first  time  explicitly  allows  Government \nagencies  to  exchange  information  to  facilitate  tax  enforcement.  Accordingly, \nSCTC  has  agreed  to  data  exchange  arrangements  with  a  critical  mass  of \nrelevant agencies, including the SCC, the Treasury, and the Social Fund. Finally, \nthe code provides the legal basis for using probability-based methods in selecting \ntaxpayers for audit, which is a prerequisite for the adoption of risk-management \ntechniques.  \n\nA functional organization and an LTU are in place, and SCTC has established an \ninternal audit function and a division to combat misconduct and corruption. LTU \nclients operate on a self-assessment principle, and collections now total 60% of \nSCTC collections\u2014up from 40% in 2005. \n\nAlthough  KITIS,  the  existing  software,  needs  to  be  upgraded,  it  provides  a \nsuitable  platform  for  the  creation  of  a  central  database  and  management \ninformation system (MIS), as well as the extension of the database and system to \nthe  tax  offices.  In  this  connection,  the  ongoing  modernization  of  the  SCC  (with \nADB  assistance),  the  Treasury,  and  the  central  bank  (with  World  Bank \nassistance)  provides  a  good  opportunity  to  establish  effective  data  exchange \namong  these  Government  institutions.  The  World  Bank  project  has  links  to  the \nproposed  ADB  Project,  because  banks  course  tax  payment  information  to  the \nTreasury, which then transfers the information to SCTC. \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \nTax  administration  reform  and  modernization  can  be  favorably  combined  in  the  Kyrgyz \n13. \nRepublic.  Such  an  endeavor  should  be  comprehensive  and  address  three  areas:  (i) physical \nmodernization,  including  the  installation  of  ICT  and  the  upgrading  of  facilities;  (ii) institutional \nstrengthening,  including  capacity  building  for  best  practices  in  tax  administration,  to  enable \nSCTC  to  improve  its  procedures  and  skills  independent  of  ICT  adoption;  and  (iii) business \nprocess  reengineering  and  change  management,  involving  adapting  SCTC\u2019s  operations  and \nskills to ensure optimal adoption of ICT. \n \nC. \n\nGovernment Strategy and Policy Dialogue \n\n14. \nReforming  tax  policy  and  tax  administration  is  an  essential  part  of  the  Government\u2019s \nCountry Development Strategy for 2007\u20132010. In tax policy, the Tax Code, as noted in para. 12, \nis  the  key  measure.  In  tax  administration,  the  Government  intends  to  reduce  the  scope  for \nabusive  discretion  of  tax  officials,  simplify  procedures,  and  toughen  enforcement  against \ndelinquent taxpayers. Accordingly, the Government will optimize the organizational structure of \n\n                                                 \n1   The  code,  therefore,  will  help  improve  the  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  rankings  in  the  tax  systems  section  of  the  World \nBank\u2019s Doing Business surveys. Of the 166 countries surveyed, the Kyrgyz Republic has the sixth highest number \nof taxes that businesses have to pay. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\ftax  administration,  introduce  modern  technology,  reduce  contact  between  taxpayers  and \nofficials,  and  further  strengthen  the  LTU.  The  Government  has  consistently  indicated  that  the \nproposed Project would provide important support for these efforts. \n \nThe  proposed  Project  would  also  be  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  broader  efforts  to \n15. \nimprove  governance  and  reduce  corruption.  In  the  Country  Development  Strategy,  the \nGovernment  highlights  the  negative  effects  of corruption,  especially  in  the  public  agencies,  on \neconomic  growth  and  social  welfare.  To  address  this  problem,  the  Government  intends  to  (i) \nfoster  the  active  participation  of  the  citizenry  in  monitoring  the  performance  of  Government \nagencies; (ii) strengthen the accountability and reporting requirements of the agencies; and (iii) \ninitiate the establishment of electronic government (e-government) to reduce direct contact and \nopportunities for corrupt relations between civil servants and citizens, as well as improve service \ndelivery in general. \n \nD. \n\nLessons \n\nThe  design  of  the  proposed  Project  and  TAs  incorporates  important  lessons  derived \n16. \nfrom  decades  of  international  experience  in  tax  administration  reform  and  modernization, \nparticularly  involving  tax  agencies  that  have  adopted  ICT  systems.  The  following  lessons  are \ndrawn  from  relevant  regional  experience  (Russian  Federation,  Ukraine,  and  Bulgaria)  with \nprojects supported by World Bank and other development partners: \n \n\nSuccessful  tax  administration  reform  and  modernization  require  more  than \ncomputerization  and  physical  upgrading;  it  also  entails  complex  institutional \nchange, affecting organization and human resource development. \n\nThe  optimal  approach  is  to  move  staff\u2019s  work  away  from  routine  and  low-\nproductivity  tasks  toward  more  specialized,  higher  value-added  tasks.  Training \nmust be provided early in the process to engender ownership, facilitate change, \nand ensure that attention is not biased toward physical investment. \n\nSequencing and scaling up should be carefully executed. Piloting of modernization, \nrather than full-scale implementation, will enable early identification and correction \nof  problems.  Because  of  their  importance  and  compact  size,  LTUs  provide  a \nnatural venue for piloting automation and other restructuring. \n\nImprovement  should  be  monitored  using  a  holistic  set  of  indicators,  rather  than \njust  revenue  targets.  Indicators  should  be  developed  to  measure  quality  and \nproductivity, service orientation, and sustainability. \n\nFostering a culture of compliance among taxpayers is important. This will require \nestablishing an effective taxpayer education and taxpayer service program. While \nautomation  might  lead  to  reduced  staffing  for  low-value  tasks,  more  personnel \nmight  be  needed  for  the  taxpayer  outreach  functions.  The  SCTC\u2019s  March 2006 \naction  plan  calls  for  the  creation  of  partnerships  with  the  private  sector  for \nimproved  information  dissemination  (including  the  forthcoming  Tax  Code), \ndevelopment of simplified tax forms  to ease taxpayers\u2019 compliance burden, and \ncontinuous and systematic assessments of the information and training needs of \ntaxpayers and tax administration personnel. \n\n \n\n \n\n6 \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\nAccording to the World Bank and IMF's HIPC Preliminary Document, an essential \nstep in fostering a business-friendly regulatory environment will be the adoption \nand  implementation  the  new  Tax  Code,  along  with  moving  tax  administration \ntoward risk-based assessment and away from excessively intrusive inspections. \n\nBecause  benefits  accrue  over  the  medium  to  long  term,  perseverance  and \ninstitutionalization  of  the  new  operating  framework  will  be  essential.  The  tax \nadministration should see clear and direct benefits to ensure sustained ownership.  \n\n \nE. \n\nExternal Assistance and Aid Coordination \n\n17. \nBilateral/multilateral  development  partners  have  provided  some  assistance  for  tax \nadministration  reform  and  modernization,  although  it  has  mainly  consisted  of  advice.  IMF  has \nbeen providing advice on tax policy and tax administration: (i) on VAT administration and LTU in \n2002, (ii) on LTU and broadening the VAT base in 2003, (iii) on tax administration procedures \nand legislation in 2004, (iv) on drafting the new Tax Code in 2005\u20132006, and (v) on overhauling \nselected  operations  in  2006.  During  January\u2013July  2006,  IMF  fielded  a  regional  advisor  on  tax \nadministration in Bishkek. Similarly, DFID has given advice on procedures for tax audits and tax \nappeals, developing revenue forecasting capability, and the draft Tax Code. The United States \nAgency  for  International  Development  (USAID),  in  addition  to  helping  establish  the  software \nKITIS in the head office, has assisted in the computerization of LTU. In cooperation with DFID, \nUSAID has financed the ongoing upgrading of KITIS and expansion of its coverage to all SCTC \noffices  in  Bishkek.  Finally,  World  Bank  has  an  ongoing  project  to  modernize  the  Treasury, \nchiefly  by  computerizing  expenditure  management.  Appendix 2  provides  a  summary  of  these \nactivities. \n \nIn  2004,  ADB  provided  a  loan  and  TA  for  customs  modernization.2 At  that  time,  SCTC \n18. \nwas  still  unified  with  SCC  under  the  Committee  for  Revenue  under  the  Ministry  of  Finance \n(MOF).  As  envisaged,  the  Project  for  tax  administration  reform  and  modernization  would \nleverage the customs project. In addition, since 1991, ADB has been conducting an annual tax \nconference for developing member countries, and the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s fiscal authorities have \nbeen active participants. \n \n19. \nThe  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  other  development  partners  strongly  support  the  proposed \nProject. IMF, in particular, recommended to the Government in its January 2006 TA that SCTC \nprovide  full  support  for  the  ADB  modernization  project.  ADB,  DFID  and  USAID  have  worked \nclosely  to  ensure  consistency  between  the  KITIS  upgrading  project  and  the  proposed  ADB \nProject in terms of timetable and equipment requirements.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n20. \nThe proposed Project will help increase the effectiveness of tax administration to ensure \nsustained  fiscal  consolidation  and  macroeconomic  stability.  The  outcome  of  the  Project  is  a \nmodern  and  efficient  SCTC  that  achieves  improvements  in  tax  collection.  The  design  and \n\n                                                 \n2   ADB.  2004.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  Proposed  Loans  and \nTechnical  Assistance  Grants  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan  for  the  Regional  Customs \nModernization and Infrastructure Development Project. Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n8 \n \n\nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 3. The accompanying TAs will necessarily have the same \nimpact and outcome, to which attainment they will contribute with complementary outputs. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n21. \nTo  ensure  achievement  of  the  outcome,  the  proposed  Project  and  two  accompanying \nTAs are designed to result in technical, operational, and institutional improvements. The design \nis based on (i) the studies during the project preparatory TA; (ii) the findings of ADB missions; \nand  (iii)  extensive  discussions  with  Government  agencies,  stakeholders,  and  beneficiaries. \nWhile  the  TAs  will  focus  on  institutional  strengthening,  capacity  building,  business  process \nreengineering,  and  change  management,  the  proposed  Project  will  focus  on  the  physical \nmodernization of SCTC. The Project has the following outputs: \n \n\n1. \n\nCentral Database and Management Information System \n\n \n22. \nThis  output  involves  the  acquisition  of  ICT  hardware  and  software  to  establish  a  central \ndatabase and an MIS at SCTC headquarters. Building on and completing the USAID-DFID small-\nscale project to repair and upgrade KITIS, the ADB Project will enable KITIS to be migrated from a \nlocal area network (LAN) to a wide area network (WAN), which is a prerequisite for establishing \ncomputer links to tax offices. This output will also entail the procurement of data warehousing and \nbusiness analytics systems, development  of the  capability for electronic filing  (to  be  piloted  with \nlarge taxpayers), and establishment of emergency data recovery systems. To ensure appropriate \nsequencing  and scaling-up, this output will focus on LTU and the  Bishkek tax office, given  their \nproximity to SCTC headquarters and their large share of collection. \n \n\n2. \n\nCommunication Infrastructure for Tax Offices \n\n \n23. \nThis output involves the development of the ICT infrastructure to support nationwide roll-\nout of KITIS to tax offices. Tax offices will undergo site preparation to enable them to adequately \nhouse  ICT,  maintain  continuous  links  with  the  central  database,  and  operate  under  an \napplication virtualization and WAN environment. This output will also involve the development of \nelectronic  interfaces  with  SCC,  Treasury,  SSSC,  Financial  Police,  and  Social  Fund.  While  the \ntarget is to eventually connect 100% of tax offices, this will be done gradually, in order to ensure \na smooth transition. \n \n\n3. \n\nModern Central Operations \n\n \n24. \nThis output involves the establishment of a Special Services Building (SSB) to house the \ncentral database and the MIS, LTU, the Bishkek tax office, the taxpayer service center, and the \nSCTC staff development center. Installation of these functions in the SSB will ensure effective \ncoordination  (in  particular,  LTU\u2019s  pilot  e-filing  program  will  require  close  access  to  the  central \ndatabase) and efficient workflows. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nThe  proposed  Project  has  features  that  draw  on  lessons  learned  regarding  successful \n\n25. \ntax administration reform and modernization, as well as the SCTC\u2019s specific circumstances: \n \n\n(i) \n\nThe proposed Project addresses the problem that the World Bank highlighted in \nits analysis of the Kyrgyz Republic in its 2006 report on anticorruption progress in \ntransition  economies:  that  anticorruption  efforts  have  focused  on  legislative \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nchanges with inadequate attention paid to implementation and enforcement.3 The \nproposed  Project  will  enable  the  Government  to  adopt  a  twofold  approach  to \nreducing  corruption  in  tax  administration\u2014while  the  new  Tax  Code  introduces \nimproved legislation, the Project will help ensure its implementation. \n\nThe  proposed  Project  adopts  an  innovative  approach  to  improving  governance \nand  minimizing  corruption  in  tax  administration.  In  contrast  to  prosecutorial  and \npunitive  approaches,  which  generally  produce  only  short-term  results,  the \nProject\u2019s  design  aims  to  create  built-in  controls  to  minimize  opportunities  for \ncorruption.  Automation  in  general  will  help  reduce  contact  between  taxpayers \nand  SCTC.  Meanwhile,  the  central  database  and  data  exchange  between \nrelevant  agencies  will  enhance  monitoring  and  verification  of  data,  as  well  as \ndata accuracy and accessibility. \n\nThe  proposed  Project  takes  a  comprehensive  approach  to  improving  tax \nadministration,  incorporating  revenue  targets  as  well  as  quality  and  service \nindicators.  Furthermore,  the  accompanying  TAs  will  help  SCTC  establish  a \npermanent system for setting goals and managing performance to institutionalize \na performance orientation among SCTC staff. \n\nresource  development,  and  change \nInstitutional  strengthening,  human \nmanagement  are  key  components  of  the  proposed  Project  and  accompanying \nTAs.  These  efforts  will  ensure  that  SCTC  does  not  rely  unduly  on  physical \nmodernization \nits  performance,  but  also  undertakes  essential \ncomplementary measures. \n\nimprove \n\nto \n\nThe proposed Project pays close attention to sequencing and scaling up. Efforts \ninitially  will  focus  on  LTU  and  the  Bishkek  tax  office  as  these  provide  the  best \nvenues  for  establishing  automation.  Similarly,  e-filing  and  payments  will  be \npiloted in LTU. \n\nThe  proposed  Project  pays  close  attention  to  private  sector  participation  and \ndevelopment. Private sector stakeholders will be included on the project steering \ncommittee  (PSC).  Key  activities  and  performance  indicators  include  those  that \nwill spur SCTC staff to improve service to taxpayers, such as the establishment \nof \nits \ntaxpayer  education  and  services,  which  SCTC  envisages  under \nMarch 2006 reform action plan. Finally, consistent with the World Bank and IMF \nHIPC recommendations, the Project will reduce compliance costs (including the \ncosts  of  corruption)  through  the  adoption  of  risk-based  assessment  and  the \nreduction of intrusive inspections, thereby improving the business environment. \n\n(vii) \n\nThe impetus for reform and modernization in the Kyrgyz Republic is coming from \nthe  highest  levels  of  Government  and  motivated  SCTC  staff.  As  the  benefits  of \nreform  and  modernization  materialize  and  the  reforms  become  entrenched, \nadditional  agents  and  advocates  for  change  arise,  including  the  private  sector \n(which  benefits  from  reduced  compliance  costs)  and  SCTC  staff  (as  the  new \noperations and professionalism set in). \n\n                                                 \n3   Anderson,  James  H.  and  Cheryl  W.

The  start  of  the  Project  is  envisaged  to  mesh \nwith the completion of the USAID-DFID project for upgrading KITIS. In addition, \nthe  accompanying  TAs  are  intended  to  help  SCTC  implement  the  procedural \nrecommendations that IMF has provided. Finally, discussions with technical staff \nof the World Bank\u2019s Treasury and central bank modernization project, as well as \nthe  project  management  office  (PMO)  of  the  ADB  Customs  Modernization  and \nInfrastructure  Development  Project,  have  generated  assurances  that  data \nexchange among SCTC, SCC, Treasury, and central bank will be feasible. \n\n(x) \n\nThe  proposed  Project  complements  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  assistance  for  customs \nmodernization.  Both  Projects  will  help  increase  the  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  revenue \ncollection capacity and fiscal space, improve governance and transparency, and \nspur economic activity. \n\nProject Investment and Financing Plan \n\n26. \nThe Government has asked ADB to provide an Asian Development Fund (ADF) IX grant \nof $10 million to help finance the Project (Table 1 and Appendix 4). The Project is estimated to \ncost the equivalent of $12.5 million (Table 2 and Appendix 4). The grant will finance 80% of the \nproject  cost.  The  Government  will  provide  the  remainder,  equivalent  to  $2.5 million,  as \ncounterpart  financing,  primarily  for  taxes  and  duties,  civil  works,  office  accommodations  and \nfacilities, logistical support, and physical and price contingencies. \n \n\nTable 1: Project Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nTotal Cost \n10.00 \n2.50 \n12.50 \n\nPercent \n\n80 \n20 \n100 \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank Grant \nGovernment \nTotal \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nTable 2: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nTotal Cost \n\nProject Component \nA.

The  Office  of  the  Government  (OG)  will  be \n27. \nthe Executing Agency, and SCTC will be the Implementing Agency. As Executing Agency, OG \nwill have overall responsibility for the execution and coordination of project activities, including \nsupervising the PMO, and endorsing disbursement applications under the proposed grant. \n \n28. \nProject Steering Committee. Within 3 months after grant effectiveness, the Government \nwill establish a  PSC to  oversee  the Project  and coordinate issues  related to its implementation. \nThe  PSC  will  also  review  annual  work  plans,  progress  reports,  and  midterm  evaluations.  A \nrepresentative  of  OG  will  be  the  director  of  the  PSC.  The  chairman  of  SCTC  will  be  deputy \ndirector of the PSC. A deputy chairman of SCTC will be project director, with overall responsibility \nfor  day-to-day  management.  The  PSC  will  also  include  representatives  from  other  Government \nagencies and private stakeholders, including MOF, Ministry of Economic Development and Trade, \nMinistry  of  Transport  and  Communication,  SCC,  Treasury,  SSSC,  telecoms  providers,  and \nbusiness  and  tax  service  professionals.  The  PSC  will  provide  overall  policy  guidance,  facilitate \ninteragency coordination, serve as a mechanism for private sector participation, and resolve any \ninstitutional  problems  affecting  project  implementation.  PSC  will  meet  twice  a  year,  or  more  if \nneeded. ADB will attend PSC meetings as an observer. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n12 \n \n\n \n\nProject Management Office. Before any disbursement is made under the grant, a PMO \n29. \nwill  be  established  to  carry  out  day-to-day  implementation  and  serve  as  the  secretariat  of  the \nPSC. A qualified general manager and a qualified financial manager, who will be recruited on a \ncompetitive basis with selection arrangements acceptable to ADB, will head the PMO. Qualified \ntechnical  and  administrative  specialists,  who  might  include  a  finance  officer/accountant, \nprocurement specialist, ICT and training specialists, office manager, and interpreter, will assist \nthe general manager and financial manager. These staff will be recruited on a competitive basis \nwith  selection  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  PMO  will  remain  adequately  staffed \nthroughout  implementation,  and  will  be  assisted  by  international  and  national  consultants \nfinanced  under  the  grant  and  the  accompanying  TAs.  The  PMO  will  have  the  following \nresponsibilities:  (i) planning  and  scheduling  of  activities;  (ii) administration  of  procurement \nactivities  and  selection  of  consultants;  (iii) bookkeeping  and  maintenance  of  project  accounts, \nand  preparation  and  consolidation  of  liquidation  reports;  (iv) supervision  and  monitoring  of  the \nwork  program  and  project  performance;  (v) coordination  of  field  activities;  (vi) engagement  of \nconsultants  or  firms  to  conduct  audits  of  the  project  accounts  and  financial  statements; \n(vii) liaison  with  ADB,  Government  agencies  concerned,  and  private  sector  stakeholders;  and \n(viii) preparation of quarterly and annual project monitoring and progress reports. \n \n\nThe Project will be implemented over 4 years and 8 months, from August 2007 to March \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n30. \n2012 (Appendix 5). \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n31. \nThe PMO will be responsible for procurement of all equipment, services, and civil works. \nAll  civil  works,  services,  supplies,  and  equipment  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nProcurement  of  goods,  equipment,  and  materials  costing  more  than  $0.50  million  will  be \nprocured  through  international  competitive  bidding.  Those  valued  between  $0.10  million  and \n$0.50 million will be procured through national competitive bidding (NCB) in accordance with the \nBorrower's  procurement  procedures  subject  to  the  modifications  and  clarifications  to  such \nBorrower's procedures as set forth in the grant agreement. \n \n32. \nCivil  works  will  be  required  to  establish  the  SSB  and  install  ICT  equipment  in  SCTC \nHeadquarters and selected rayons. Civil works contracts with an estimated value of $1.0 million \nor  more  will  be  carried  out  using  international  competitive  bidding  procedures,  while  those \nvalued  at  less  than  $1.0  million  will  use  NCB.  The  award  of  all  civil  works  contracts  will  be \nsubject to ADB approval. The project procurement plan is in Appendix 6. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n33. \nThe  Project  will  finance  international  and  national  consulting  services  for  project \nimplementation.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  consulting  services  include  systems \nanalysis  and  design,  systems  development  and  integration,  systems  implementation,  and \nproject  management.  About  32  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  45 \nperson-months  of  national  consulting  services  will  be  required.  The  terms  of  reference  for  the \nconsulting services are in Appendix 7. The Government has agreed to recruit consultants on an \nindividual  basis  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended from time to time), and ADB\u2019s procedures for recruiting individual consultants. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\n5. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Rectroactive Financing \n\n \n34. \nTo  expedite  project  implementation,  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will \nbe undertaken to cover the engagement of a project preparation manager, who will oversee the \nestablishment of the PMO. The advance action will include the submission of the final terms of \nreference and evaluation criteria; curriculum vitae of at least five qualified candidates; and the \nevaluation report, including the ranking of the candidates, with draft contract for negotiations for \nADB\u2019s  review  and  approval.  The  retroactive  financing  for  the  engagement  of  the  project \npreparation manager will be limited to 2 months\u2019 remuneration/fee (equivalent to approximately \n$6,000).  The  project  preparation  manager  will  start  his/her  services  within  the  month  before \nexpected grant approval. \n \nThe  SCTC  was  informed  that  (i) ADB\u2019s  approval  of  the  advance  action  as  discussed \n35. \nabove  is  subject  to  approval  of  the  proposed  grant  and  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the \nProject or the related recruitment costs for the project preparation manager, and (ii) retroactive \nfinancing covers only those eligible expenditures incurred during the 1-month period before the \nsigning date of the grant agreement. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \nThe  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \n36. \nHandbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  expedite  project  implementation  through \ntimely  release  of  grant  proceeds,  the  OG  will  establish  separate  imprest  accounts  for  the  grant \npromptly  after  their  effectiveness.  Total  advances  are  not  to  exceed  ADB\u2019s  estimated  share  of \neligible project expenditures to be financed through the imprest accounts for the next 6 months, or \n10% of the grant amount, whichever is lower. The imprest accounts will be established at a bank \nacceptable to ADB, and will be managed and liquidated in accordance with detailed arrangements \nagreed  on  by  SCTC  and  ADB,  and  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  As \neligible expenditures are incurred and paid from the imprest accounts, the Borrower will request \nliquidation/replenishment  of  the  imprest  accounts  by  submitting  withdrawal  applications  and  the \napplicable  summary  sheet.  Notwithstanding \nthe  Government\u2019s  disbursement  procedures, \nsufficient supporting documentation, as defined in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, must be \nkept to substantiate all expenditures incurred from the grant proceeds. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \nThe PMO will maintain separate accounts exclusively for the Project, including separate \n37. \naccounts for the grant. It will register in such accounts all receipts and payments for the Project. \nThe  PMO  will  include  a  finance  officer/accountant  to  ensure  that  the  Project  is  managed \naccording to sound accounting principles and procedures acceptable to ADB. The accounts and \nfinancial statements for each fiscal year, including the imprest accounts, will be audited annually \nby independent external auditors acceptable to ADB. The audit report should include a separate \naudit opinion on the proper use of the imprest accounts. SCTC will provide ADB with an audit \nreport,  with  audited  accounts  and  financial  statements,  within  6 months  after  the  end  of  each \nfiscal year. The financial statements and auditor\u2019s report will be in English. Appendix 8 provides \na summary financial management assessment. \n \n38. \nThe PMO will submit quarterly and annual reports to ADB, indicating progress made and \nproblems encountered during the review period, steps taken or proposed to be taken to remedy \nthe  problems,  proposed  programs  of  activities,  and  expected  progress  during  the  following \nperiod. Within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, SCTC will submit to ADB a project \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n14 \n \n\n \n\ncompletion report providing details about implementation, costs, benefits, and other information \nrequested by ADB. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n39. \nSCTC  will  establish  an  appropriate  project  performance  management  system  in  the \nPMO within 1 year of grant effectiveness. For periodic monitoring, key indicators and baseline \nconditions  will  be  developed  through  participatory  surveys,  and  will  be  incorporated  in  the \nregular reporting system. During grant inception, SCTC and ADB will agree on a preliminary set \nof  indicators  for  monitoring  and  evaluating  project  performance.  At  the  beginning  of \nimplementation, SCTC will confirm the baseline values for these indicators. These indicators will \nbe  measured  during  implementation.  ADB\u2019s  findings  and  comments  regarding  these  project \nindicators  will  be  incorporated  in  every  project  monitoring  and  evaluation  report,  which  will  be \nsubmitted  to  ADB  quarterly.  On  completion  of  the  Project,  its  outcome  will  be  evaluated \naccording to a schedule and terms of reference agreed upon by SCTC and ADB. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Reviews \n\n \n40. \nOG, SCTC, and ADB will jointly review the Project at least twice during the first year of \nits implementation and at least once a year thereafter, and will monitor the overall performance \nof the PMO. These reviews will cover physical implementation; the policy, institutional, technical, \nand financial aspects of the Project; and its continuing viability. The review will also examine the \nimplementation  of  action  plans,  and  the  identification  of  problems  that  might  require  joint \nattention. After 3 years of implementation, SCTC and ADB will jointly carry out a comprehensive \nmidterm review of the Project to identify any problems and constraints, and to assess the need \nfor  midterm  modification  of  the  Project\u2019s  scope  and  implementation  arrangements.  Technical \nand budgetary changes to the project document requested or arising from the review will also \nbe  considered,  as  will  the  inclusion  of  additional  activities  or  the  consideration  of  possible \nexpansion of activities/areas over the remaining life of the Project. \n \n\n10. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n \nThe proposed Project will help minimize corruption and improve governance. In addition, \n41. \nimplementation  of  the  Project  will  adhere  to  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended  to  date).  Accordingly,  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  SCTC.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \ngrant regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to \naudit and examine the  records and accounts of the OG and SCTC, as well as all contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers, as they relate to the Project. \n \nAttention  was  drawn  to  the  section  on  fraud  and  corruption  that  was  added  to  ADB\u2019s \n42. \nProcurement  Guidelines  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from \ntime  to  time),  particularly  the  need  for  bidders,  suppliers,  contractors,  and  consultants  to \nobserve the highest standards of ethics in the procurement and execution of contracts, and the \nsanctions  imposed  on  those  who  violate  these  standards.  OG  and  SCTC  are  committed  to \ncreating a corruption-free environment and would like the Project to be implemented strictly in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n43. \nThe proposed Project provides for two accompanying TAs to address the key lesson that \ntax administration reform and modernization will require complex institutional change in addition \nto  computerization.  The  TAs  will  ensure  effective  implementation  of  the  Project  by  addressing \ntwo  complementary  areas:  (i) reform  measures  that  are  independent  of  computerization  and \nphysical upgrading, but are essential for tax administration reform; and (ii) adjustment measures \nto enable SCTC to make optimal use of its modern facilities. Accordingly, the first TA will be for \ninstitutional strengthening and capacity building to support tax administration reform, while the \nsecond TA will be for business process reengineering and change management to facilitate tax \nadministration modernization. The project preparatory TA and previous TAs from IMF, USAID, \nand  DFID  have  produced  a  substantial  body  of  background  analytical  work  and  concrete \nrecommendations  on  reforming  SCTC\u2019s  operations.  Thus,  the  two  new  TAs  can  use  this \nbackground  work  and  focus  on  assisting  SCTC  in  implementing  these  recommendations.  The \naccompanying TAs are described in paras. 45\u201348. As the problem-tree analysis in Appendix 1 \nindicates, the TAs will produce outputs to complement those of the Project. As such, the TAs\u2019 \ndesign  and  monitoring  frameworks  (in  Appendixes  9  and  10)  will  necessarily  have  the  same \nimpact and outcome. \n \n44. \nFor both TAs, SCTC will be the Executing Agency and Implementing Agency. Each TA \nwill  be  completed  by  about  December 2009.  This  time  frame  is  consistent  with  similar \nrestructuring efforts in comparable economies (Russian Federation, Bulgaria, and Ukraine), as \nwell  as  with  the  latest  IMF  TA  mission\u2019s  proposed  time  frame.  The  international  tax \nadministration  reform  specialist  for  the  first  TA  will  be  the  team  leader  for  both  TAs.  In \nconsultation  with  SCTC,  ADB  will  select  and  engage  individual  international  and  national \nconsultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. SCTC will procure \nequipment in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Procurement Guidelines and will keep the equipment on \ncompletion of the TAs. \n \nA. \n\nInstitutional Strengthening and Capacity Building for Tax Administration Reform \n\n(building  on \n\ntax  administration \n\nrecommendations  on \n\n45. \nTo help ensure achievement of the impact and outcome of the Project, the first TA will \nhave  three  outputs:  (i) SCTC  staff  skills  in  modern  tax  administration  will  be  upgraded,  (ii) a \nmechanism for setting goals and monitoring performance will be adopted to ensure continuing \nefficiency,  and  (iii) taxpayer  education  and  services  will  be  provided  to  promote  voluntary \ncompliance.  Key  deliverables  will  include  (i) periodic  comprehensive  reports  for  implementing \nreform,  additional \nthe  body  of  existing \nrecommendations  for  strengthening  SCTC\u2019s  internal  audit  programs  and  combating  official \nmisconduct, recommendations for strengthening interagency cooperation on data exchange and \nenforcement \ninteragency  memorandum  of  understanding); \n(ii) formulation of a permanent system for setting goals and managing performance; (iii) conduct \nof  training  programs  for  taxpayer  education  and  services;  and  (iv) establishment  of  a  public \nawareness  campaign  to  promote  taxpayer  compliance  and  foster  public  support  for  tax \nadministration  reform.  Many  of  these  activities  can  be  implemented  independent  of  the \ndevelopment  of  modern  infrastructure  under  the  Project.  Nevertheless,  the  team  leader  will \nensure that the TA\u2019s activities are synchronized with the implementation of the Project. \n \n46. \nThe TA will require 16 person-months of international consulting services and 18 person-\nmonths of national consulting services. Outline terms of reference for the TA are in Appendix 9. \nThe TA is estimated to cost the equivalent of $600,000. As proposed, ADB will provide a grant \nfor  $500,000  from  ABD\u2019s  technical  assistance  funding  program.  The  Government  will  finance \n\nthe  existing \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n16 \n \n\n \n\nthe  remaining  local  currency  cost,  equivalent  to  $100,000, by  providing  office  space  and \nlogistical support, workshop facilities, and counterpart staff. \n \nB. \n\nBusiness Process Reengineering and Change Management for Tax Administration \nModernization \n\n47. \nTo  help ensure  achievement  of  the  impact  and  outcome  of  the  Project,  the  second  TA \nwill  have  three  outputs  (i) SCTC  staff  skills  in  basic and  advanced  ICT methods  and  business \nanalytics will be developed, (ii) SCTC business processes will be reengineered to enable SCTC \nstaff to efficiently use the new equipment and facilities, and (iii) SCTC staff\u2019s adjustment to the \nnew  operational  setup  will  be  facilitated  through  a  change  management  program.  Key \ndeliverables include (i) detailed training programs that are geared toward \u201ctraining the trainors\u201d \nfor basic and advanced ICT skills, data management and business analytics, risk management \nand  statistical  profiling,  and  computer-assisted  audits;  (ii) detailed  recommendations  on \nbusiness  process  reengineering  and  restructuring  of  operating  procedures  to  ensure  optimal \nuse  of  new  equipment  and  facilities;  (iii) prototypes  of  simplified  documents  to  ease  taxpayer \ncompliance;  and  (iv) best  practices  guidelines  and  manuals  on  automated  tax  administration. \nThe  activities  under  this  TA  will  require  synchronization  with  the  installation  of  the  new \nequipment and facilities.  \n \nThe TA will require 16 person-months of international consulting services and 18 person-\n48. \nmonths of national consulting services. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 10. The TA is \nestimated to cost the equivalent of $600,000. ADB will administer a grant of $500,000 provided \nby the Government of the Republic of Korea. The Government will finance the remaining local \ncurrency  cost,  equivalent  to  $100,000,  by  providing  office  space  and  logistical  support, \nworkshop facilities, and counterpart staff. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nProject Benefits \n\n49. \nThe  Project\u2019s  main  benefit  is  higher  tax  revenues,  which  will  help  the  Kyrgyz  Republic \nsustain macroeconomic stability and economic growth, with the potential to expand the tax base \nand  tax  collections  further.  By  their  nature,  therefore,  these  direct  and  indirect  benefits  are \nexpected  to  accrue  to  the  general  society  and  economy,  rather  than  to  easily  identifiable \nsectors.  Nevertheless,  at  least  two  identifiable  sectors  can  be  expected  to  benefit  from  tax \nadministration  reform  and  modernization.  First,  taxpayers  (individuals  and  businesses)  will \nbenefit  from  (i) more  efficient  SCTC  procedures,  which  will  reduce  their  compliance  costs  and \nfacilitate their business operations; and (ii) improved governance, which will reduce the costs of \ncorruption. Second, to the extent that the increased tax revenues are channeled to social and \neconomic  expenditures  that  directly  benefit  the  poorer  segments  of  society,  tax  administration \nreform and modernization will lead to further increases in overall social welfare. \n \nB. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n50. \nThe financial analysis of the Project was carried out by comparing the \u201cwith project\u201d and \n\u201cwithout  project\u201d  scenarios.  The  summary  financial  analysis  is  in  Appendix 11.  The  primary \nquantifiable  financial  benefit  from  the  Project  is  higher  tax  revenues.  With  the  Project,  tax \ncollections are estimated to increase by 0.1% of GDP in 2012, rising progressively to 0.5% of \nGDP  by  2015  and  staying  constant  thereafter.  On  these  bases,  the  financial  internal  rate  of \nreturn (FIRR) of the Project is estimated to be about 34%. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nSensitivity  analyses  indicate  that  lowering  the  projected  increases  in  tax  collection  to \n51. \n0.2%  of  GDP  by  2013  and  holding  it  constant  thereafter  would  reduce  the  FIRR  to  17%. \nDoubling maintenance costs would reduce the FIRR to 29%. These FIRRs, however, would still \nbe comfortably above the threshold of 12%. A combination of the two adverse scenarios would \nreduce the FIRR to 13%, still above the threshold. \n \n52. \nThe  FIRRs  calculated  for  the  Project  are  likely  to  be  conservative.  Revenue  increases \ncould be even higher due to spillovers and hard-to-quantify effects. For instance, by enhancing \nmacroeconomic stability, improved tax collection contributes to faster economic growth. This,  in \nturn, would expand the tax base further. Improved governance and minimized corruption in tax \nadministration would also help to accelerate growth. These two mechanisms would increase tax \nrevenues, although the magnitude would be difficult to quantify. Similarly, to the extent that the \nthe  poorer \nincreases \nsocioeconomic  segments  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  social  welfare  benefits  would  result\u2014again \ndifficult to quantify. \n \nThe  proposed  Project  is  financially  sustainable.  The  Government  and  SCTC  are \n53. \ncommitted to providing sufficient financing for the operations and maintenance of the equipment \nand  other  facilities.  The  significant  financial  benefits  from  the  Project  also  help  ensure \nsustainability. \n \nC. \n\ntax  collections  are  channeled \n\nSocial and Poverty Impact \n\nto  expenditures \n\nthat  benefit \n\nin \n\n54. \nThe  proposed  Project  will  contribute  directly  and  indirectly  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s \nefforts  to  achieve  sustained  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  Directly,  the  increases  in  tax \nrevenues will help foster continued macroeconomic stability, which is an essential condition for \neconomic  growth,  as  well  as  provide  the  fiscal  space  for  priority  social  and  economic \nexpenditure that will enable the Kyrgyz Republic to achieve its MDGs. Indirectly, the improved \ngovernance  brought  about  by  minimized  corruption  and  reduced  compliance  costs,  increased \nconsistency and fairness of treatment for taxpayers, and greater transparency and integrity can \nalso be expected to support growth, job creation, and poverty reduction. The summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 12. \n \nD. \n\nEnvironmental Impact \n\n55. \nThe  proposed  Project  has  been  classified  as  environmental  category  C  based  on  site \nvisits  and  assessment  under  the  project  preparatory  TA.  The  SSB  will  be  constructed  on \nsuitable existing vacant real estate owned by SCTC. Thus, no land acquisition or resettlement will \nbe required for the construction of the SSB. Site visits were made to the regional tax offices to \nexamine  the  civil  works  requirements  for  the  installation  of  ICT  equipment.  All  construction, \nrehabilitation, and installation activities will be carried out within the premises of existing SCTC \nproperties, including the site of the SSB. During construction work, some minor noise and dust \npollution will occur. The civil works contracts will include mitigating measures to minimize such \npollution.  Therefore,  the  Project\u2019s  environmental  impact  is  minimal  and  can  be  kept  at \nacceptable levels. \n \nE. \n\nProject Risks \n\nThe  proposed  Project  does  not  have  any  unusual  technical  risks.  Risks  during \n56. \nimplementation  arise  mainly  from  (i) potential  delays  due  to  SCTC\u2019s  lack  of  experience  with \nADB  requirements,  (ii) potential  difficulties  in  coordinating  SCTC\u2019s  central  database  with  the \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n18 \n \n\n \n\ninfrastructure  of  other  agencies,  and  (iii) potential  difficulties  of  SCTC  staff  in  adjusting  to  the \nnew  procedures  and  facilities.  These  risks  are  mitigated  by  steps  taken  during  the  project \npreparatory  TA,  ongoing  measures  adopted  by  OG  and  SCTC,  the  design  of  the  Project  and \nTAs, and Government assurances. Specific steps to address these risks include the following: \n(i) key  SCTC  staff  received  intensive  orientations  in  ADB  procedures  during  the  project \npreparatory  TA;  (ii) internationally  experienced  consultants  will  provide  support  and  training  to \nPMO  and  SCTC  during  implementation  to  ensure  the  equipment  and  works  comply  with  the \ndesign requirements and quality standards; (iii) SCTC has reached an agreement with relevant \nfor  effective  data  exchange;  and  (iv) institutional  strengthening  and  change \nagencies \nmanagement have been incorporated as essential components of the overall Project to facilitate \nthe adjustment of SCTC staff to the new framework. \n \nRisks  could  also  include  inadequate  funding  for  operations  and  maintenance,  and \n57. \ndifficulties  in  recruiting  and  retaining  competent  ICT  personnel.  The  former  is  mitigated  by \nassurances  from  OG  and  MOF  that  adequate  counterpart  funds  will  be  provided  during  and \nafter  implementation  to  ensure  sustainability.  SCTC\u2019s  plan,  under  its  reform  strategy,  to \nintroduce  a  merit-based  pay  system  mitigates  the  latter.  Significant  potential  increases  in  tax \ncollection  with  the  successful  implementation  of  the  Project  also  mitigate  both  risks.  These \nrevenues would enable SCTC to continually upgrade its operations and staffing. \n \nBroader  risks  arise  on  the  political  front.  Political  shocks  could  disrupt  the  continuity  of \n58. \npolicy makers, while political pressures\u2014including from vested interests opposed to efficient tax \nadministration\u2014could  hinder  the  Project\u2019s  reform  and  modernization  goals.  These  risks  are \nmitigated by the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s continuing commitment to pursuing macroeconomic stability \nand  structural  reforms  under  the  PRGF  program,  as  well  as  development  partners\u2019  close \nattention to the policy environment. OG\u2019s assumption of the role of Executing Agency is a strong \nindication of the Government\u2019s support for the Project. Passage of the new Tax Code will also \nhelp establish a favorable environment for tax administration. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nA. \n \n59. \ngiven the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  has \n\nThe Government will ensure that SCTC establishes a PSC within 3 months after \ngrant effectiveness. \n\nThe  Government  will  allocate  in  a  timely  manner  adequate  funding  for  the \ncounterpart funding of the Project, and will provide ADB with information on such \nallocations  annually.

Exports have risen strongly since the late 1990s. Due mainly to \nthe  development  of  the  Kumtor  gold  mine  and  export,  exports  grew  annually  by  about  10.5% \nduring 2000\u20132005. However, because import growth has been faster at 16.5%, the country has \nincurred persistent trade and current account deficits. Foreign direct investment and unrequited \nflows (chiefly remittances) have financed these deficits comfortably. \n \n2. \nOutput  contracted  slightly  in  2005  due  to  following  political  and  economic  shocks:  (i)  a \ntemporary  drop  in  gold  production,  which  accounts  for  about  30%  of  exports;  (ii)  shortfalls  in \nfarm  output  due  to  bad  weather;  and  (iii)  a  slowdown  in  manufacturing  due  to  the  uncertain \nbusiness climate. Since 2005, economic activity has returned to normal, with growth rebounding \nduring the first semester of 2006.  However, inflation, while remaining low in 2005 (at 4.9%), has \nalso started to edge up due to supply and demand factors. Apart from the shortfall in agricultural \noutput  and a  surge in  fuel  prices, higher  inflation  has  been  driven  by  an  expansion  in  reserve \nmoney  related  to  (unsterilized)  central  bank  intervention  to  stem  the  Kyrgyz  currency\u2019s \nappreciation, and strong inflows of private capital and remittances. \n \n\nTable A1: State Government Finances \n(% of GDP) \n\nItem \n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n(Estimate) \n\n2007 \n(Projection) \n\nCurrent expenditure \nCapital expenditure \n\nIncome tax \nVAT \nExcises \nOthers \n\n \n \n \n \nCustoms \nNontax revenue \n\n18.7 \n18.2 \n18.0 \n13.7 \n2.8 \n6.6 \n1.4 \n2.9 \n0.5 \n3.8 \n0.2 \n0.5 \n \n24.5 \n19.7 \n4.8 \n \n(0.5) \n \n(5.4) \n\n20.4 \n20.0 \n19.9 \n14.6 \n3.5 \n7.1 \n1.1 \n2.9 \n1.7 \n3.6 \n0.0 \n0.4 \n \n24.6 \n20.2 \n4.4 \n \n(0.5) \n \n(4.4) \n\nCurrent revenue \n  Tax revenue \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCapital revenue \n\n19.5 \n19.1 \nTotal revenue and grants \n18.7 \n18.0 \n  Total revenue \n18.4 \n17.8 \n \n14.3 \n13.3 \n \n2.8 \n2.9 \n \n7.2 \n6.4 \n \n1.3 \n1.4 \n \n3.0 \n2.6 \n \n0.5 \n0.6 \n \n3.6 \n3.9 \n \n0.2 \n0.2 \n \n0.8 \n1.1 \n  Grants \n \n \n \n24.2 \n24.8 \nTotal expenditure \n19.7 \n18.8 \n \n4.5 \n6.1 \n \n \n \n \n(0.5) \n(0.6) \nNet lending \n \n \n \nBalance \n(4.2) \n(5.1) \n ( ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product, VAT = value added tax. \nSource: International Monetary Fund. \n \n3. \nFiscal  consolidation  and  a  generally  prudent  monetary  policy  have  underpinned  the \ncountry\u2019s  macroeconomic  accomplishments.  Fiscal  performance  has  been  healthy,  with  tax \nreceipts  rising  in  the  past  several  years  as  a  result  of  new  revenue  measures,  as  well  as \nconcerted  efforts  to  curb  evasion  and  improve  tax  administration  (Table  A1).  Tax  collection \n(excluding customs revenues) increased from 13.3% of gross domestic product (GDP) to 14.6% \nof  GDP  in  2000\u20132005.

Consequently,  external \npublic debt fell from 111% of GDP in 2001 to 82% of GDP in 2005. \n \n4. \nAlthough  tax  receipts  have  been  buoyant,  new  developments  might  change  the  fiscal \npicture. Tax reforms implemented in 2006 (retroactive to the beginning of the year) included a 2 \npercentage point reduction in the payroll tax rate and substantial cuts in corporate and personal \nincome taxes, which have been important sources of state revenue. Increases in motor vehicle \ntaxes and liquor excises, and an anticipated broadening of the tax base, will help offset these \nlosses. Nevertheless, the net effect is likely to be negative, at least initially. \n \n5. \nThe  economy  also  faces  the  broader  fiscal  challenge  of  achieving  debt  sustainability, \nwhile addressing essential social expenditures (Figure A1.1). Despite relief granted by the Paris \nClub in 2005, debt indicators will continue to be high. Although 39% of the population remains \npoor,  expenditures  have  been  restrained  as  part  of  fiscal  consolidation  measures.  Productive \npublic expenditures are essential to raise living standards and help the Kyrgyz Republic meet its \nMillennium Development Goals. \n \n6. \nIn  2006,  the  new  Tax  Code  was  drafted  with  substantial  technical  assistance  from  the \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  and  the  Department  for  International  Development  (DFID).  The \ncode  simplifies  and  clarifies  tax  laws  and  procedures,  helps  improve  tax  administration, \nencourages  compliance,  and  curbs  evasion  and  fraud.  The  code  has  been  designed  to  be \nbroadly revenue-neutral. IMF has urged the passage of the Tax Code, which is a conditionality \nunder the current Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility arrangement. \n \nThe  code  provides  for  several  enhancements  that  will  greatly  assist  in  improving  the \n7. \neffectiveness  of  tax  administration.  For  instance,  the  code  clarifies  procedures  to  enhance \ntaxpayer protection; and, to encourage compliance, it establishes higher interest rates for delayed \npayments  involving  violations  than  for  honest  mistakes.  In  information  and  communication \ntechnology  (ICT)  adoption,  the  code  provides  the  legal  basis  for  the  establishment  of  electronic \npreparation and submission of accounting records, tax returns (verified through digital signature), \ntax reports, property declarations, and registers of invoices. Finally, the new code for the first time \nallows  the  exchange  of  information  between  relevant  Government  agencies,  thereby  enabling \neffective data exchange and cooperation in enforcement. \n \nB. \n \nThe  State  Committee  for  Taxes  and  Collections  (SCTC),  formerly  called  the  State  Tax \n8. \nInspectorate (STI), was established in 1991 as an agency under the Ministry of Finance (MOF). \nA  reorganization  of  the  MOF  in  2002  merged  STI  and  the  State  Customs  Inspectorate  (now \ncalled  the  State  Customs  Committee)  into  the  Committee  for  Revenue.  In  April  2005,  after  a \nchange  in  Government,  the  committee  again  was  split,  and  STI  was  placed  under  the  direct \nsupervision of the Office of the Government (OG). As envisaged, the reorganization would allow \nsufficient  focus  on  tax  administration.  In  January 2007,  as  part  of  Government  reorganization, \nSTI was renamed and its status upgraded to a full ministry, still under the direct supervision of \nOG. \n \n9. \nSCTC  has  about  2,250  personnel,  distributed  among  headquarters  and  the  Large \nTaxpayers  Unit  (LTU)  (194  staff  in  total),  two  city  offices  (Bishkek  and  Osh),  seven  provincial \noffices, and 55 district tax offices (Figure A1.2). The organization is now largely function-based, \nboth  in  headquarters  and  in  the  field  offices.  District  offices  are  responsible  for  all  tax \noperations,  except  for  appeals.  These  are  referred  to  provincial  offices,  which  are  primarily \n\nTax Administration \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n \n\n22 \n \n\ncoordinating  bodies.  These  operations  include  registration,  payments  and  returns  control, \narrears,  audit,  analysis  and  statistics,  procedures  and  legal  matters,  and  stamp  and  excise \ncontrol. \n\n \n\nInadequate staff \nskills \n\nInefficient operating \nframework \n\n \nFigure A1.1: Summary Sector Problem Tree \n \n \nFragile economic growth and high poverty rate \n \n \n \n \n \nTax revenues insufficient to ensure macroeconomic stability \n \nwhile financing priority development spending \n \n \n \n \n \nInefficient tax administration with insufficient capacity  \n \nfor modern operations \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nADB project grant support \n \nand technical assistance \n \n \n\nImplement reform \nstrategy  \n \nBuild capacity for \nbest practices in \ntax administration \n \nEstablish goal-\nsetting and \nperformance \nmanagement \nsystem \n \nImplement change \nmanagement \nprogram \n\nDevelop staff skills \nin modern tax \nadministration, \nbasic and \nadvanced ICT \nskills, data \nmanagement, and \nbusiness analytics \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nInadequate \nequipment and \ninfrastructure \n\nDevelop central \ndatabase and \nmanagement \ninformation system  \n \nDevelop \ncommunication \ninfrastructure for \ntax offices \n \nEstablish modern \ncentral facilities \n\n \n\n \n\nWeaknesses in tax \npolicy \n\nAdopt and \nimplement new  \nTax Code \n\n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, DFID = Department for International Development, ICT = information and communication \ntechnology, IMF = International Monetary Fund. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nIMF and DFID advice on \ndrafting Tax Code \n\n\f                                                                                                                                                    Appendix 1 \n\n23\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure A1.2: Organizational Structure of State Committee for Taxes and Collections  \n(number of personnel in parentheses) \n\nAudit  \n(30) \n\nChairman, SCTC\n\nPayments  \n(16) \n\nAdministration \n(18) \n\nIndirect Taxes  \n(11) \n\nDeputy Chairman \n(1) \n\nDeputy Chairman \n(1) \n\n  \nOffice of the  \nGovernment \n\nPrevention of \nMisconduct and \nCorruption (6) \n\nLegislation and  \nMethodology  \n(27) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFirst Deputy  \n \nChairman  \n \n(1) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSCTC = State Committee for Taxes and Collections. \nSource: State Committee for Taxes and Collections. \n \n \n10. \nSCTC\u2019s  weak  level  of  automation  is  an  important  and  highly  visible  constraint  to \nincreasing administrative efficiency. Nevertheless, reforming and modernizing tax administration \nwill require more than computerization. Several non-ICT reforms will also need to be adopted to \nachieve  the  broader  goal  of  business  process  reengineering.  Accordingly,  the  following \n\nLarge Taxpayers  \nUnit  \n(28) \n\nOrganization and \nInternal Audit \n(12) \n\nArrears and Free\nEconomic Zone \n(12) \n\nInformation  \nTechnology  \n(12) \n\nTax Collection  \n(15) \n\nInternational  \n(3) \n\nAppeals  \n(6) \n\nLegal  \n(6) \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n \n\n24 \n \n\ndiscussions  also  highlight  weaknesses  in  organization,  operational  procedures,  and  human \nresources that will need to be addressed in conjunction with physical upgrading. \n \n11. \nICT. SCTC\u2019s ICT infrastructure consists of the tax administration software adopted in 1994 \ncalled  NALOG  (\u201ctax\u201d  in  Russian),  which  is  built  around  the  concept  of  taxpayer  ledgers  (or \npersonal  cards)  that  record  all  of  the  taxpayer\u2019s  tax  activities.  It  has  been  superseded  by  more \nrobust  software,  Kyrgyzstan  Integrated  Tax  Information  System  (KITIS).  However,  only  the  16 \nbiggest  tax  offices  use  either  NALOG  or  KITIS.  In  addition,  the  database  of  excise  stamps  and \nlabels is accessible through wireless application protocol services, while a value-added tax (VAT) \ninvoice control system has been introduced to help improve VAT administration. \n \n12. \nDue to inadequate automation, almost 50% of SCTC\u2019s workforce is still engaged in the \ninefficient  manual  processing  of  tax  functions.  In  many  instances,  data  are  encoded  twice, \nresulting in delays, errors, and exposure to corrupt practices. The inefficient manual procedures \nare unnecessary in some instances\u2014notification letters are still prepared manually, even though \nautomatic  generation  is  feasible.  With  proper  equipment,  SCTC  staff  engaged  in  low  value-\nadded tasks could be reduced and perhaps redeployed to neglected functions, such as taxpayer \neducation and services. \n \n13. \nOne means of reducing the processing workload of SCTC staff is to outsource the work \nto  the  banks,  especially  the  State  Settlement  and  Savings  Company  (SSSC),  which  handles \nabout 70% of tax payments. Effective implementation of this method, however, will require the \ninstallation of data links between the banks and SCTC, instead of the current method of using \ncouriers to transfer paper records. \n \n14. \nThe  following  priority  ICT  investments,  therefore,  have  been  identified:  (i) revisions  to \nKITIS  to  optimize  the  structure  of  the  database,  facilitate  automatic  generation  of  notifications \nand  reports,  and  correct  deficiencies;  (ii) installation  of  hardware,  systems  software,  and  a \nnetwork  infrastructure  to  enable  a  client-server  and  centralized  processing  environment; \n(iii) development  of  an  electronic  platform  for  taxpayer  registration;  (iv) development  of  an  ICT \nplatform for filing of tax returns through the Internet (initially, only for LTU), and for transferring \ndata  seamlessly  between  the  tax  offices  and  the  central  database;  (v) development  of  an \nInternet-based tax payment system that will move payments data electronically between SCTC \nand the Treasury; (vi) rollout of KITIS to all tax offices; (vii) establishment of other electronically \nbased  services  to  facilitate  voluntary  compliance  and  self-assessment;  and  (viii) repair  and \nrehabilitation  of  tax  offices  to  insure  a  proper  environment  for  effective  ICT  use  and  efficient \nworkflows. \n \n15. \nTaxpayer Registration. The pressing need is to make it easier for taxpayers to register, \nand  for  SCTC  to  update  its  records.  Specifically,  the  project  to  establish  one-stop  services  for \nregistrants has not yet started, some taxpayers who are far from SCTC offices find registration \ndifficult,  forms  and  procedures  need  to  be  simplified  (e.g.,  instead  of  having  taxpayers  bring \ncash  register  machines  to  SCTC  offices,  manufacturers  should  be  able  to  certify  to  the \nmachines\u2019 compliance), and computerization in SCTC offices needs to be improved to facilitate \nrecordkeeping. \n \n16. \nFiling.  International  best  practice  is  to  make  filing  as  convenient  as  possible.  Currently, \nhowever, taxpayers often have to file returns at SCTC offices before proceeding to banks to make \ntheir payments. SCTC regulations should allow for these two steps to be done in one place. Filing \ncan also be facilitated by establishing an electronic filing modality, initially for large taxpayers. \n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                                    Appendix 1 \n\n25\n\n \n\n \n\nPayments. The SCTC offices need a payments system that is faster, less error-prone, \n17. \nless corruption-prone, and less reliant on cash transactions. Currently, payment data have to be \nmanually  encoded,  summary  forms  have  to  be  delivered  physically,  and  reconciliation  often  is \nbeset by numerical errors, as well as being vulnerable to corrupt practices. Generally, payments \nare  made  through  banks.  Each  tax  office  establishes  a  settlement  account  with  a  particular \nbank,  although  taxpayers  are  allowed  to  pay  through  other  banks.  After  receiving  payments \nfrom taxpayers, the bank sends the payment orders by messenger to the Treasury, which then \nsplits the receipts between Republican and Local Government budgets and prepares a roster to \nreflect this. Next, the tax office messenger picks up the roster and the payment orders. Payment \ninformation is manually encoded into KITIS or NALOG if the district tax office is computerized, \nor manually posted on taxpayers\u2019 personal cards if not. Recorded payments are reconciled daily \nwith  data  in  the  banking  and  Treasury  networks.  The  workflows  should  be  revised  and \ncomputerization adopted to make data transmission faster and less error-prone, and to enable \nbanks  to  transmit  information  simultaneously  to  SCTC  without  involving  the  Treasury  in  the \nprocess.  \n \nProcessing  of  Returns. After filing, tax returns are sent for processing, which involves \n18. \nreviewing  mathematical  accuracy  of  computations,  generating  the  notification  to  pay,  and \nposting select returns data onto personal cards. In tax offices using the NALOG or those that do \nnot have computer systems, the reviews are done manually or using calculators. In offices that \nuse KITIS, the system\u2019s built-in algorithm automatically detects discrepancies between the tax \ndeclaration  and  the  computed  value.  However,  the  system  does  not  show  the  amount \ncalculated, requiring tax inspectors to verify the computation manually as well. In addition, KITIS \nhas  not  been  modified  to  accommodate  the  changes  to  the  tax  code,  which  can  lead  to  the \nalgorithm  mistakenly  concluding  that  declarations  are  erroneous  even  though  a  manual \ncomputation  reveals  otherwise.\u00a0 The  current  practice  of  numerical  review  of  returns  by  SCTC \nstaff  during  filing  is  contrary  to  the  principle  of  self-assessment  and  a  wasteful  duplication  of \nefforts. Ideally, the processing of returns should be a mechanical procedure that uses resources \nefficiently and reduces contact between taxpayers and SCTC staff. Reviews should be done at \nthe audit stage. \n \n19. \nAudits  and  VAT  Invoices.  Current  law  requires  the  auditing  of  each  taxpayer  once  a \nyear,  which  is  a  waste  of  resources.  SCTC  staff  should  use  risk-assessment  techniques  and \nthird-party  information  (from  State  Customs  Committee,  central  Treasury,  banks,  etc.)  to \nundertake  targeted  audits.  Apart  from  upgrading  ICT,  however,  SCTC  needs  to  upgrade  its \nstaff\u2019s capacity to undertake audits by recruiting more and better-trained auditors. The auditing \nand  settlement  process  with  delinquent  taxpayers  should  be  systematic  and  transparent,  and \nshould  incorporate  appropriate  penalties  and  incentives  for  speedy  settlement.  For  VAT \ninvoicing, the current system is cumbersome because businesses can obtain invoices only from \nSCTC  offices,  have  to  record  and  monitor  all  invoices  issued,  and  have  to  submit  returns \nmonthly. VAT invoices can be monitored more efficiently using modern audit techniques based \non risk assessment, which would be applied after returns and input claims have been filed. \n \n20. \nArrears Management. Arrears, after falling to less than Som300 million in 2003, rose to \nSom2.2 billion in 2005\u201433.2% higher than in 2004. Tax debt is also highly concentrated. Two \nlarge debtors (state-owned utility companies in the energy sector) account for more than half of \nall  taxes  owed  to  SCTC.\u00a0 Due  to  inadequate  ICT,  detection  of  arrears  is  often  tardy.  However, \nthe  interpretation  of  the  provision  of  Article  47  of  the  Tax  Code  regarding  the  order  in  which \npayments are applied also requires clarification. \n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n \n\n26 \n \n\nLTU. Only LTU and two tax offices are electronically connected to SCTC headquarters, \n21. \nand  the  connection  capacities  are  insufficient.  Of  LTU\u2019s  235  clients,  only  165  (mainly  large \nbusinesses in Bishkek) use LTU\u2019s full range of services. For the others, including those outside \nBishkek, services are restricted to audits due to infrastructure limitations, such as lack of reliable \nmail service, electronic return filing, and network automation support. \n \n22. \nLTU\u2019s  performance  has  been  generally  satisfactory.  Recently,  it  met  the  target, \nestablished under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility program with the IMF, of collecting \n60% of SCTC revenues. Most of its 235 clients operate under self-assessment. Given this solid \nfoundation,  LTU  is  a  suitable  venue  for  piloting  electronic  filing  and  payments.  Before  that, \nhowever, LTU needs investment in physical modernization. As with the rest of SCTC, LTU has \ninadequate  ICT  systems.  Currently,  LTU  and  the  Bishkek  tax  office  are  housed  in  premises \nrented  from  the  State  Customs  Committee.  These  offices  are  not  sufficiently  accessible,  and \nhave layouts that are inconsistent with service orientation and modern workflows. \n \n23. \nTaxpayer Education and Services. SCTC provides virtually no taxpayer education and \nservices.  Further,  SCTC  has  only  limited  focus  and  no  specific  budget  allocation  for  these \nimportant  functions.  Although  tax  offices  post  information  bulletins  in  their  public  areas, \ngenerally this is limited (one-time dissemination of changes to the Tax Code and implementing \nrules  and  regulations),  and  offices  provide  little  follow-through  and  do  not  seek  to  address \ntaxpayers\u2019 concerns proactively. \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                                          Appendix 2  \n\n27 \n\nMAJOR EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE FOR TAX ADMINISTRATION \n\n \nSource \nInternational \nMonetary Fund \n\nAreas of Assistance \nOverall economic policy, \nincluding macro fiscal \nmanagement \n \nTax policy and tax \nadministration \n\nStatus \n\nOngoing \n \n \n \nCompleted June 2006 \n\nWorld Bank \n\nPublic expenditure \nmanagement \n\nOngoing \n\nUnited States \nAgency for \nInternational \nDevelopment \n\nTax administration \nmodernization \n \n \nTax policy \n\nUnited Kingdom \nDepartment for \nInternational \nDevelopment \n\nTax administration \nmodernization \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOverall fiscal management \n\nCompleted 2002 \n \n \n \nCompleted 2005 \n\nOngoing \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCompleted \n\nGSAC  =  Governance  Structural  Adjustment  Credit,  GTAC  =  Governance  Technical  Assistance  Credit,  IMF  = \nInternational Monetary Fund, KITIS = Kyrgyzstan Integrated Tax Information System, PRGF = Poverty Reduction and \nGrowth Facility, SCTC = State Committee for Taxes and Collections.  \nSources: International Monetary Fund, World Bank, United Kingdom Department for International Development, and \nUnited States Agency for International Development. \n\nScope \nAdvice and financial \nassistance, through \nthe PRGF program \n \nTechnical advice and \nassignment of a \nregional advisor on \ntax administration \nModernization of the \nKyrgyz Republic \nTreasury\u2019s banking, \npayment, debt \nservicing, and \nexpenditure \ncommitment \noperations \n \nAssistance provided \nthrough the GSAC \nand GTAC  \nEstablishment of \nKITIS software in \nSCTC headquarters \n \nAdvice, in cooperation \nwith IMF, on drafting \nof Tax Code \nSmall-scale \nassistance to partially \nupgrade KITIS and \nprovide \nrecommendations on \nadoption of risk-\nassessment methods \nand simplification of \ntaxpayer reporting \nrequirements \n \nAdvice on formulation \nof medium-term \nbudgetary framework;

However,  the  economic  benefits  are  hard  to  identify  and  to  quantify.  The \nfinancial benefits are increases in tax revenues. Knowing the project costs, the financial internal \nrate  of  return  (FIRR)  can  be  calculated.  From  an  economic  point  of  view,  however,  these \nincreased revenues are intersectoral transfers and are not relevant in calculating the economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  (EIRR).  However,  the  Project  has  also  indirect  benefits,  including \n(i) potentially higher growth resulting from effective use of the increased revenues, (ii) additional \nincrease in the tax base from the efficiencies and growth stimuli arising from reduced corruption \nand  compliance  costs,  and  (iii) social  benefits  to  the  extent  that  the  increased  revenues  are \nused  for  pro-poor  expenditures.  These  indirect  benefits,  however,  are  extremely  hard  to \nquantify. Hence, the proposed Project is not amenable to straightforward economic benefit-cost \nanalysis. The following analysis, therefore, is limited to calculating the FIRR. To the extent that \nthe indirect and hard-to-quantify benefits lead to additional tax revenues, the FIRRs calculated \nin this analysis will be lower bounds. \n \n2. \nThe  Project\u2019s  financial  costs  total  $12.5 million.  Costs  for  maintenance,  replacement, \nand upgrade of equipment are estimated to be $1.85 million per year. All equipment, software, \nand information and communication technology licenses are assumed to be replaced/renewed \nevery 4 years, at a cost equal to 100% of the initial cost. \n \nThe financial analysis is conducted by comparing the \u201cwith Project\u201d and \u201cwithout Project\u201d \n3. \nscenarios. The FIRR is calculated over 25 years. The analysis makes conservative assumptions \nregarding the increases in tax collection arising from the Project. The estimated gains are based \non  the  consultants\u2019  expert  assessments  of  the  revenue  increases  that  can  be  reasonably \nexpected to result from successful implementation of the Project, and in close consultation with \nthe  State  Committee  for  Taxes  and  Collections  (SCTC)  and  other  stakeholders.  Thus,  tax \ncollections  are  assumed  to  increase  by  only  0.1%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  2010 \n(compared  with  the  without  project  scenario),  rising  to  0.2%  of  GDP  by  2013  and  to  0.5%  of \nGDP  by  2022,  and  remaining  constant  to  the  end  of  the  analysis  period.  Based  on  these \nassumptions, the FIRR of the Project is about 34% (Table A11.1). \n \nB. \n \n4. \nThe  Project\u2019s  economic  viability  was  also  tested  by  assessing  the  effects  of  two  key \nshocks (Table A11.2). Scenario 1 assumes that the increase in tax collections amounts to only \n0.2% of GDP in 2013, and that this increase remains constant to 2031. Scenario 2 assumes that \nincremental  maintenance  costs  double  to  $2 million  per  year.  In  each  scenario,  the  FIRR \nremains  comfortably  above  the  threshold  of  12%.  A  third  analysis  was  also  conducted, \ncombining the two previous scenarios. In Scenario 3, the EIRR drops to 13%, but is still above \nthe threshold. \n \nC. \n \n5. \nfuture  operations  and \nmaintenance  costs  of  the  SCTC\u2019s  physical  facilities,  which  are  estimated  at  about  $1.8 million \nper  year,  is  essential.  The  Office  of  the  Government,  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  SCTC  are \naware of this factor and are committed to ensuring sustainability.

In  its  long-term  development  framework,  the  Country  Development \nStrategy  (CDS),  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  takes  a  comprehensive  approach  to  poverty  reduction.  The  strategy  entails \n(i) maintaining  high  rates  of  economic  growth,  (ii) creating  a  favorable  business  environment  for  private  sector-led \ngrowth,  (iii) minimizing  corruption  and \nimproving  public  governance,  (iv) linking  Government  spending  with \ndevelopment programs; and (v) reforming tax and customs systems. \n \nThe Government of the Kyrgyz Republic aims to reform the tax system to increase revenue collection, while reducing \nthe burden on economic entities and reducing the informal economy. Tax administration reform and modernization can \nhelp  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  achieve  the  poverty  reduction  objectives  in  its  CDS  by  (i) assisting  in  maintaining  the \nmacroeconomic stability that is a precondition for sustained growth, and (ii) helping produce the revenues needed for \nexpanding social services. A reformed and modernized tax administration will also help spur private sector-led growth. \n \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nThe  level  of  absolute  poverty  peaked  at  about  60%  in  1999  following  the  Russian  economic  crisis.  Although  the \neconomy  has  recovered  since  then,  poverty  incidence  remains  high,  with  data  showing  that  about  45%  of  the \npopulation lives in absolute poverty. About 13% lives in extreme poverty. Income inequality has also worsened, with \nthe Gini index rising from 30% in 2000 to 33% in 2004. \n \nA  consensus  has  emerged  on  the  causes  and  determinants  of  poverty  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  The  high  levels  of \npoverty can be traced to the disintegration of the former Soviet Union, which caused severe reductions in production \ndue  to  the  disruption  of  trade  links  and  the  loss  of  traditional  markets.  This,  in  turn,  led  to  sharply  higher \nunemployment at a time when a shrinking revenue base reduced the state\u2019s ability to provide social safety nets. \n \nThe continuing high levels of poverty are largely due to challenges in reforming state institutions and restructuring the \neconomy  and  society  according  to  market  mechanisms.  The  following  specific  issues  have  been  noted: \n(i) employment generation has been difficult; (ii) tapping global markets has been difficult due to the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s \nlandlocked situation, limited resources, and small domestic market; (iii) the state\u2019s capacity to address essential needs \nis limited due to fiscal constraints; and (iv) continuing corruption and inefficiency in state administration inhibit private \nenterprise and legitimate economic activity. \n \nThe CDS is the medium-term operational plan for poverty reduction. The overall objective of the CDS is improving the \nliving  standards  of  Kyrgyz  Republic  citizens  by  fostering  sustainable  economic  growth,  promoting  full  employment, \nachieving steady growth of incomes, and making available a wide spectrum of social services. \n\nC.
