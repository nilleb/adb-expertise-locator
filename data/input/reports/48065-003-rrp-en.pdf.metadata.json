The  183  PSEs \n3. \nowned by the government comprise 169 public sector companies (PSCs), 7 development finance \ninstitutions, and 7 federal authorities. These federal PSEs employ more than 402,543 workers, \nwith  total  assets  of  PRs10,823  billion  ($103  billion)  in  FY2015.  In  FY2015,  172  PSEs  (94%) \ndisclosed  their  financial  statements,  with  53  PSEs  (29%)  reporting  losses  despite  significant \nbudget  transfers.  Total  reported  aggregate  profit  was  PRs72.98  billion  ($0.7  billion),  with  total \nreported loss of PRs20.35 billion ($0.2 billion). The government\u2019s fiscal risk exposure (combining \nloans and guarantees) was PRs1,472 billion ($14.05 billion) in FY2015.3 Despite recent reform \ninitiatives,  PSEs  continue  to  rely  on  significant  regular  fiscal  transfers  and  sovereign  credit \nguarantees  to  maintain  their  operations.  The  power  distribution  companies  (DISCOs)  are  the \nmajor  recipient  of  such  transfers.  Other  important  beneficiaries  include  Pakistan  International \nAirlines, Pakistan Steel Mill, and Pakistan Railways. In FY2016, the budget allocation to support \nPSEs\u2019 daily operations, including subsidies and other transfers, constituted 59% of overall budget \nallocations to the PSEs. This severely limits the critical capital development expenditures needed \nto improve the efficiency of PSEs. \n \nFiscal transfers to PSEs jeopardize fiscal sustainability and impede government\u2019s \n4. \ndevelopment  expenditure.  High  levels  of  fiscal  transfers  to  PSEs  undermine  overall  fiscal \nstability  and  growth,  which  adversely  affects  critical  investment  on  social  and  economic \ninfrastructure, especially when the government has very limited ability to fund such investment \nthrough borrowings. The government recognizes the importance of reducing the fiscal deficit and \ngovernment borrowings, and imposed severe cuts in budget transfers to PSEs starting in FY2014; \ntransfers declined from 3.2% of gross domestic product (GDP) in FY2012 to 1.5% in FY2016,4 \nand 0.5% in the first 8 months of FY2017 (Figure 1).5 This budget constraint can help boost the \naccountability  and  efficiency  of  PSEs.  Acknowledging  the  fact  that  reduction  in  budgetary \ntransfers  is  partially  attributable  to  improved  performance  of  some  PSEs  (including  Pakistan \nRailways),  hard  budget  constraint  could  adversely  affect  the  government\u2019s  ability  to  invest  in \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Public Sector Enterprises Program ($500,000). The \ntechnical  assistance  will  remain  active  until  31  December  2018  to  support  the  design,  monitoring,  and  capacity \ndevelopment.  \n\n3   All these figures are now available in the public domain due to the initiatives taken under the programmatic approach. \nThe report can be accessed from http://www.finance.gov.pk/publications/State_Owned_Entities_FY_2014_15.pdf.  \n\n4  From PRs634 billion ($6.05 billion) in FY2012 to PRs432 billion ($4.12 billion) in FY2016. \n5 Develop expenditure in Figure 1 implies the government\u2019s support for capacity augmentation. \n\n \n\n\fpriority  capital  projects  for  some  important  PSEs.  For  example,  the  absence  of  periodic \nmodernization  has  limited  the capacity  of  Pakistan  Railways,  leading  to reduced market share \nand labor productivity. Current workforce of 78,000 consumes about 70% of annual budgetary \nresources ($375 million in FY2015) for salaries and pension payments alone, severely limiting the \nresources available for urgently needed investments in railway corridors, and upgrading of the \nfreight and passenger services.6 \n \n\nFigure 1: Federal Transfers to Public Sector Enterprises \n\nTotal\n\nSubsidy\n\nDevelopment Expenditure\n\nFY2012\n\nFY2013\nFY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product \nSource: Ministry of Finance, Government of Pakistan\n\nFY2014\n\nFY2015\n\nFY2016\n\nFY2017\n\n \n\n \nGovernment\u2019s PSE reform initiatives, sustainability, and constituency building for \n5. \nreforms.  In mid-FY2013  the government  embarked  on  a  PSE  reform  program to restore  PSE \nfinancial viability and reduce fiscal transfers,7 but soon recognized that a successful PSE reform \nprogram requires that two prerequisites be met. First, vested stakeholder interests, particularly \nthose of PSE employees, require improvements in the operating environment and governance of \nPSEs  prior  to  privatization.  Adequate  stakeholder  consultations  and  a  gradual  approach  are \nnecessary to secure the support of stakeholders for such reforms, which is also true for structural \nreforms that address human resource issues and the affordability of user charges of many PSEs, \nincluding DISCOs and Pakistan Railways. Second, many reforms require that reform initiatives \nbe maintained over a long period to produce the desired results.8 \n \n6. \nPriority  challenges  and  ADB  assistance.  To  facilitate  the  government\u2019s  reform \ninitiatives,  ADB  approved  subprogram  1  of  the  programmatic  approach  in  June  2016. 9 \nSubprogram  2  continues  reforms  initiated  under  subprogram  1.  The  programmatic  approach \naddresses the following three important challenges the government faces while initiating critical \nPSE reforms: \n\n                                                 \n6  Despite significant improvements, the operating ratio of Pakistan Railways (total ordinary working expenses as a \n\npercentage of gross earnings) remains more than 100%. \n\n7  On 3 October 2013 the Cabinet Committee on Privatization approved a plan to sequence the capital market and pre-\nprivatization restructuring for 39 PSEs: 11 PSEs for block sales, 25 PSEs for strategic private sector participation, \nand 3 PSEs for restructuring (Pakistan Railways, Pakistan International Airlines, and Pakistan Steel Mills). \n\n8  Reforms  (especially  those  dealing  with  politically  sensitive  issues)  are  medium-  to  long-term  efforts  that  require \ncontinuous  support  to  manage  the  ownership  and  institutional  capacity  factors  that  impact  on  reform  outcomes. \nContinuity  in  support  for  reforms  is  needed  to  maintain  gains  and  address  weaknesses  (ADB.  2009.  Special \nEvaluation  Study:  ADB  Support  for  Public  Sector  Reforms  in  the  Pacific:  Enhance  Results  through  Ownership, \nCapacity, and Continuity. Manila). \n\n9  ADB.  2016.

Manila. \n\n2 \n\nP\nD\nG\n\n \nf\no\n%\n\n \n\n \n\n\f(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe need to coordinate across various government departments to (a) effectively \nimplement  good  corporate  governance  principles;  (b)  articulate  crucial  guiding \nprinciples, such as transparency and consistency, on issues related to retirement \nbenefits; (c) facilitate constituency building for critical reforms in PSEs with the help \nof  an  effective  communications  strategy; 10  (d)  monitor  and  evaluate  PSEs\u2019 \nperformance; and (e) implement critical structural reforms in some selected PSEs \nto get maximum benefits. \nThe  need  to  provide  continuing  support  for  some  reforms  initiated  under \nsubprogram  1,  which  by  their  nature,  have  a  long-term  implementation  cycle. \nContinued assistance for these reforms would consolidate and sustain gains made \nto improve PSE performance. \nThe need to plan for and address the substantial adjustment costs associated with \nimplementation  of  PSE  reforms.  These  costs  are  a  major  challenge,  given \nPakistan\u2019s  current fiscal context. Identification  of reforms  and selection  of  PSEs \nwill need to be done very carefully, given the government\u2019s priorities. \n\n \nNeed  for  sequencing  of  reforms.  Subprogram  2  is  part  of  an  integrated  solution \n7. \ncomprising policy-based loans under a programmatic approach, with clear program costs. This \nwill  help  ADB  and  the  government  design  and  implement  policy  actions  supporting  the \ngovernment\u2019s reform  agenda  without  excessively  straining the government\u2019s  budget to finance \nthe cost of reforms. Several policy actions are politically sensitive and will require time to prepare, \nincluding building a constituency for reforms.11 It is critical that reforms are properly identified and \nlogically sequenced over two subprograms, under the programmatic approach, if they are to be \neffectively  implemented.  Some  policy  actions  serve  to  support  other  actions  included  in  the \nprogrammatic  approach  (e.g.,  a  public  awareness  campaign),  requiring  that  the  various  policy \nactions under the overall programmatic approach be carefully timed.  \n \n8. \nDevelopment  coordination.  The  programmatic  approach  is  part  of  a  well-coordinated \nmultidonors  package  for  PSE  reforms  in  Pakistan.  The  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF) \napproved a 3-year extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility in September 2013,12 \nwhich concluded in 2016. The World Bank approved four development policy credits in April 2014, \nMay  2015,  June  2016,  and  in  March  2017.  These  two  programs  also  support  some  reforms \n(including privatization) relevant for PSEs in Pakistan. Subprogram 2 complements and carries \nforward similar reforms, especially in the areas of implementing corporate governance rules and \nprivatization.  \n \nLessons. The success of PSE reforms is critically dependent on public awareness of the \n9. \nreform process and its benefits. Strong government commitment and adequate support from all \nstakeholders  are  two  important  prerequisites  for  a  successful  PSE  reform  program;  strong \ngovernment commitment is also one of the important prerequisites for successful program lending, \nespecially in Pakistan. Thus, setting realistic policy actions is crucial to ensure the government\u2019s \n\n                                                 \n10 Privatization  initiatives  require  that  political  parties,  managers,  unions,  workers,  civil  servants,  business  leaders, \npotential  investors,  national  and  international  civil  society  organizations,  and  consumers  be  informed  about  the \nprogram\u2019s operations and benefits (D. Calabrese. 2008. Strategic Communication for Privatization, Public\u2013Private \nPartnerships, and Private Participation in Infrastructure Projects. World Bank Working Paper. No.139. Washington, \nDC: World Bank). \n\n11 This was one of the major lessons of the recent privatization drive. \n12 The primary aim of the IMF program is macroeconomic stabilization, which  will require fiscal and monetary tightening \nto establish a sustainable fiscal path and reduce inflation. The program also includes structural reforms\u2014especially \nprivatization \nefficiency \n(https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2013/pr13322.htm). \n\nPSEs\u2014with \n\nincreasing \n\neconomic \n\nfederal \n\nsome \n\naim \n\nthe \n\nof \n\nof \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fcommitment. 13  Similar  lessons  were  also  identified  for  the  World  Bank\u2019s  banking  sector \nrestructuring  and  privatization  project  and  program.14 Some  critical  lessons from  successful  as \nwell as unsuccessful PSE reform episodes, including the recent initiatives, are incorporated in the \nproposed  policy  actions  (para.  7).  These  lessons  relate  to  a  public  awareness  campaign, 15 \nunfunded pension liabilities, and other important issues pertaining to PSE workers.  \n\n \nADB\u2019s  value  addition.16 Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  adds  significant  value  to  the \n10. \nprogrammatic  approach  by  (i)  facilitating  private  participation  in  PSEs; 17  (ii)  improving  the \ntargeting  of reform-related  expenditures  and  their  partial financing; (iii)  enhancing  coordination \nwith  development  partners  in  the  design  and  execution  of  the  programmatic  approach;  (iv) \nproviding technical assistance to improve the performance of PSEs such as Pakistan Railways; \nand (v) consolidating policy reforms in the transport and energy sectors, and thereby facilitating \nongoing and future ADB investments in those sectors. ADB also accommodates the government\u2019s \nongoing fiscal consolidation by providing affordable least-cost solutions critical to sustaining its \nreform initiatives. \n \nAlignment with ADB\u2019s strategy. Subprogram 2 is part of the 2017 pipeline in the ADB \n11. \nCountry Operations and Business Plan (COBP), 2017\u20132019 for Pakistan.18 It will provide critical \nhelp to the government to address the significant policy challenges and adjustment costs of this \nagenda. It also complements ADB\u2019s public\u2013private partnership (PPP) initiatives in Pakistan and \nthe Railways Investment Program, which is under preparation. \n\nThe  impact  will  be  reduced  net  fiscal  transfers  to  PSEs  from  the  federal  budget.19 The \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\nB. \n\n12. \noutcome will be improved PSE performance.20 \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n13. \n\nThe outputs are as follows: \n(i) \n\nOutput  1:  Policies  to  address  labor  issues  and  communication  strategy \nintroduced,  and  costs  and  benefits  assessed.

While the National Electric Power Regulatory \nAuthority allows DISCOs to include retirement benefit costs in determining power \ntariffs, an outstanding legal dispute on the tariffs delayed the notification of the new \ntariff.  The government has agreed to provide a one-time budgetary allocation of \nPRs15  billion  ($143  million  equivalent)  in  FY2018\u2014identified  as  \u201cPSE  Reform \n(Power  Sector)\u201d\u2014to  bridge  the  timing  gap  until  the  tariff  dispute  is  resolved, \nthereby  ensuring  timely  operationalization  of the  Retirement  Cost  Funds.  Under \nsubprogram 2, the government will also design an information technology-based \nPSE  performance  monitoring  system  and  provide  a  report  that  highlights  the \nreform costs of and progress made under the programmatic approach. \nOutput 2: Financial transparency, monitoring, and corporate governance in \npublic sector enterprises improved. In line with the Public Sector Companies \n(Corporate  Governance)  Rules,  2013  (CGR),  the  Securities  and  Exchange \nCommission of Pakistan (SECP) issued corporate governance guidelines in 2013. \nThe main policy actions under this output are designed to facilitate improvements \nin compliance with CGR.23 Under subprogram 1, 35% of the companies complied \nwith CGR, and 50% will comply under subprogram 2.24 Various policy actions such \nas  publishing quarterly  reports  and  a  list  of noncompliant  PSEs  are  proposed.25 \nThree critical policy actions will be implemented under subprogram 2 to improve \nPSE performance: (a) amending CGR to include all PSEs within its ambit,26 and to \nfacilitate stringent performance evaluation criteria for the chief executive officers \nand other senior board members; and (b) making selection of PSE board members \nmore transparent and effective. Policy actions to promote regular publication of a \nfinancial  performance  report  for  all  PSEs,  starting  from  FY2014,  have  been \nincluded  under  output  2.  A  financial  performance  report  for  federal  PSEs  was \npublished for FY2014 under subprogram 1 and the financial performance report \nfor FY2015 will be published under subprogram 2 with a gender disaggregated list \nof  PSE  board  members.  Women  make  up  a  low  percentage  of  PSE  board \nmembers,  and  an  important  proposal  is  to  implement  a  strategy  to  improve  the \n\n                                                 \n21 The  Privatization  Commission  has  initiated  a  large  public  awareness  campaign  involving  (i)  print  and  electronic \nmedia, (ii) international partnerships for building PSE competitiveness through knowledge and innovation, and (iii) \ncommunity outreach.  \n\n22 The  eight  DISCOs  are  (i)  Faisalabad  Electric  Supply  Company,  (ii)  Gujranwala  Electric  Power  Company,  (iii) \nHyderabad Electric Supply Company, (iv) Islamabad Electric Supply Company, (v) Lahore Electric Supply Company, \n(vi)  Multan  Electric  Power  Company,  (vii)  Peshawar  Electric  Supply  Company,  and  (viii)  Sukkar  Electric  Supply \nCompany. \n\n23 Good  corporate  governance  facilitates  economic  efficiency,  and  companies'  access  to  capital  for  long-term \ninvestment  (Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development.  G20/OECD  Principles  of  Corporate \nGovernance. http://www.oecd.org/daf/ca/principles-corporate-governance.htm). \n\n24 The  Government  of  Pakistan  has  exceeded  this  requirement  by  ensuring  almost  60%  compliance  rate  for  the \n\nCorporate Governance Rules as of April 2017. \n\n25 The  Government  of  Pakistan  has  issued  the  Office  Memorandum  on  27  January  2017  to  cover  all  PSEs  under \nCorporate Governance Rules, 2013. The names of those PSEs who that not complying with Corporate Governance \nRules, 2013 are uploaded in the SECP website. \n\n26 Including those that are not registered under Companies Ordinance 1984. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n(iii) \n\nlevel of women\u2019s representation on PSE boards under subprogram 2.27 \nOutput  3:  Restructuring  and  reform  of  selected  public  sector  enterprises \ninitiated. In support of output 3, Pakistan Railways accomplished the following six \npolicy actions under subprogram 1:28  \n(a) \n\nto  an \n\nstrengthened  its  internal  control  and  audit  function  by  appointing  a  chief \ninternal auditor to lead the internal audit department and designing a road \nmap for strengthening the internal audit department, including a risk-based \naudit plan; \ninitiated  phased  migration \naccounting standards (i.e., International Financial Reporting Standards); \ninitiated  a  detailed  study  on  departmental  restructuring  and  workforce \nrationalization; \ncommenced creation of a digital land asset database; \ncreated and operationalized a PPP unit to facilitate private participation in \nselect railways services; and \ninitiated the process to improve transparency in the procurement of goods \nand services, and the establishment of effective internal controls. \n\ninternationally  recognized  set  of \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n(e) \n\n(f) \n\n \n14. \nAll these policy actions will be supported under subprogram 2 to accomplish the desired \nresults.  For  example,  Pakistan  Railways  will  implement  the  risk-based  audit  for  FY2017  and \noperationalize  the  process  for  private  participation  in  selected  railways  services  under \nsubprogram 2.29 Similarly, Pakistan Railways will complete the automation of a land database,30 \nand  implementation  of  selected  procurement  reforms. 31  The  government  will  also  attempt \nrestructuring and/or privatization of some other PSEs under subprogram 2. Privatization of SME \nBank  Ltd.,  is  one  such  important  reform  initiative.  Invitation  for  expressions  of  interest  for \nacquisition of up to 93.88% shares of SME Bank Ltd., has already been advertised in national \nnewspapers  following  approval  of  the  transaction  structure  by  the  Cabinet  Committee  on \nPrivatization (CCOP) on 27 January 2017.32 \n\n                                                 \n27 This proposal will require mandatory presence of a female member on the board of companies. In commercial PSCs, \n\n96% of the board members are male, and in noncommercial PSCs, 93% are male (footnote 3).  \n\n28 Pakistan Railways is one of the most important state institutions of Pakistan. However, its importance has declined. \nIn response, beginning in April 2014, Pakistan Railways has been implementing a comprehensive restructuring plan, \nwhich includes improvements in business processes, financial stability, and service delivery.  Appointment of the \nRailway Board was completed in February 2015 and strengthening of the company\u2019s financial accounting practices\u2014\nincluding moving from a cash to accrual basis accounting (International Financial Reporting Standards), reconciling \nland assets database, notifying an appropriate PPP framework, and focusing on improving the transparency and \nefficiency of the procurement process\u2014are currently supported by ADB to improve its long-term business prospects. \nRevenue performance is steadily improving\u2014during the first 6 months of FY2017 revenues were PRs18.6 billion \nagainst  a  target  of  PRs17.6  billion.  This  may  be  attributable  to  improvements  in  both  freight  and  passenger \nbusinesses.  \n\n29 PPPs  have  already  been  introduced  in  three  areas:  commercial  management  of  passenger  trains,  commercial \n\nmanagement of brake and luggage vans, and commercial management of cargo express trains. \n\n30 To improve use of land resources as part of the larger ambition of monetizing Pakistan Railway\u2019s commercial assets, \nits land assets database has been reconciled and automated under the programmatic approach. Information can \nnow be obtained in real time on each parcel of railway land with respect to status (self-occupied, encroached, or \nleased), with real-time geo-referenced geographic information system imagery. Pakistan Railways\u2019 land records are \nnow synchronized with federal and provincial land revenue records. \n\n31 Pakistan  Railways  has  more  than  100,000  staff  (regular  and  contractual  staff),  making  the  task  of  departmental \nrestructuring and workforce rationalization both enormous and sensitive. Pakistan Railways has agreed to complete \nthe interim report on departmental restructuring and workforce rationalization by early June 2017. \n\n32 SME  Bank  is  a  public  limited  company  incorporated  in  Pakistan  on  30  October  2001  and  was  issued  a  banking \nlicense on 13 September 2004. However, private banks, with a share of 65%-70%, have always been the leading \nlenders in SME finance. \n\n \n\n\fThere  are  sixteen  policy  actions  under  subprogram  2.33 Some  policy  actions  relating to \n15. \nPakistan Railways under subprogram 2 will continue to be monitored and supported under the \nADB Railways Investment Program (under preparation).  \n\n \nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\nD. \n\n16. \nAs  an  integral  part  of  the  ongoing  fiscal  consolidation  initiatives\u2014which  encompass \nmaintaining a moderate debt-to-GDP ratio and building fiscal buffers against adverse shocks\u2014\nthe government plans to lower the budget deficit (excluding grants) to 4.2% of GDP in FY2017 \nfrom  5.4%  in  FY2015,  mainly  through  revenue  mobilization  and  expenditure  rationalization. \nHowever, given the sluggish nature of revenue improvements over the short to medium term, the \nburden  of  fiscal  consolidation  will  primarily  fall  on  expenditure  rationalization,  especially \ndevelopment expenditures. As a result, it will be difficult to maintain, if not augment, the past trend \nof  development  expenditures  and  development  loans  (primarily  for  investment  to  augment \ncapacity)  for  PSEs  (including  Pakistan  Railways).  This  is  a  clear  illustration  of  a  hard  budget \nconstraint and its impact on development financing, given the rigidity in nondiscretionary recurrent \nexpenditures  (salary,  pensions,  and  interest).  The  government\u2019s  support  for  productive \ninvestments in PSEs needs to be revived, and will be supported under the program. \n \n17. \nIt will also be difficult for the government to incur additional costs to carry out PSE reforms, \nunless  expenditures  on  specific  items  are  targeted  and  partly  financed  by  the  government\u2019s \ndevelopment  partners.  Strong  expenditure  rationalization  efforts  will  be  needed  to  enable \nadditional  reform-related  expenditures,  to  the  extent  these  are  reflected  in  the  federal  budget, \nwithin the stipulated fiscal deficit targets. \n \n18. \n Unfunded pension liability is a risk to a company's financial condition due to underfunding \nof  defined  benefit  pension  plan.  Unfunded  pensions  and  other  retirement  benefits  are  major \nconstraints  for  timely  privatization  (or  strategic  sale  of  shares)  of  DISCOs.  Unless  addressed \nefficiently,  these  will  have  an  adverse  impact  on  the  government\u2019s  divestment  income  from \nprivatization.  Therefore,  it  is  proposed  that  the  government  will  help  creating  Retirement  Cost \nFunds and encourage operationalization of these Funds.  Putting some of these items together \nand combining them with the government\u2019s commitment to reduce the fiscal deficit-to-GDP ratio, \ndevelopment financing needs of approximately $897 million over the entire program period (2016\u2013\n2018)  is  foreseen. 34 The  programmatic  approach  is  expected  to  finance  nearly  67%  of  this \ndevelopment financing requirement. Thus, the programmatic approach will help the government \nto pursue, without breaching the fiscal targets, its macroeconomic reform agenda, including PSE \nreforms.  \n \n19. \n The government has requested a concessional loan of $300 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance subprogram 2. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a \ngrace period of 5 years; an interest rate of 2% per year during the grace period and thereafter; \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n\n                                                 \n33 Out of the 16 policy actions, 15 policy actions have already been complied with. The Ministry of Railways (MOR) is \nin  the  process  of  finalizing  its  interim  report  on  departmental  restructuring  and  workforce  rationalization  and  will \napprove the key recommendations of this interim report before the Board consideration of subprogram 2. \n\n34 Based on detailed discussions with the government officials, it was agreed to support five major costs of reforms \nunder the programmatic approach (combining both Subprogram 1 and Subprogram 2): (i) support for revival of the \ngovernment support to PSEs for investment to augment capacity; (ii) funding of a retirement benefit fund to manage \nhuge unfunded pensions and other retirement liabilities of workers, (iii) cost of vocational and other trainings, and (iv) \ncommunication cost. To facilitate private investment (strategic sales through IPOs), MOF has also incurred additional \ncost by providing financial assistance to selected DISCOs to settle the receivables in their balance sheets.    \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n20. \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  through  its  Finance  Division,  will  continue  to  be  the \nexecuting  agency  for  subprogram  2.  The  program  management  unit  (PMU)  established  under \nsubprogram  1  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall  coordination  and  reporting  on  implementation \narrangements.  The  Finance  Division,  MOR,  Pakistan  Railways,  the  Privatization  Commission, \nand SECP will be the implementing agencies. \n \nThe PMU will assist the implementing agencies in the implementation of subprogram 2, \n21. \nand will conduct regular consultations to ensure timely completion of all policy actions. A senior \ngovernment  official  will  serve  as  the  program  director.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  (i) \ncoordinating  and  monitoring  subprogram  2,  including  the  policy  actions;  (ii)  preparing  and \nsubmitting all required reports to the Finance Division and ADB; and (iii) submitting the necessary \nstatements and reports to ADB. \n \n22. \nThe implementation period for subprogram 2 is from 30 June 2017 to 30 June 2018. The \nproceeds of the loan will be disbursed upon fulfillment of the policy actions, to the satisfaction of \nADB, in accordance with (i) ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time \nto  time),  and (ii)  simplified  disbursement  procedures for  program  loans.35 ADB  will  monitor the \nimplementation of subprogram 2 through periodic progress reports and will field regular missions \nto confirm fulfillment of the policy actions.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nThe  beneficiaries  will  primarily  be  the  domestic, industrial,  agricultural,  and  commercial \n23. \nclients of public goods and services provided by PSEs, which will deliver improved services in a \ncost-effective  manner.  Taxpayers  and  recipients  of  government  services  will  indirectly  benefit \nfrom the reduced fiscal costs of PSEs. PSE staff are expected to benefit from a consistent and \nfair approach to retirement benefits, as set out in the program. \n \nA. \n\nEconomic \n\nThe beneficiaries of subprogram 2 will be the people of Pakistan, who will directly benefit \n24. \nfrom  the  improved  delivery  of  services,  especially  in  the  areas  of  power  and  transportation. \nMoreover,  subprogram  2  will  facilitate  government  fiscal  investments  in  social  and  economic \ninfrastructure,  which  will  result  in  improved  health  and  education  services  and  economic \nopportunities. In addition, subprogram 2 will stimulate private sector activity by partly substituting \ngovernment service commitments. The beneficial effect on federal finances will originate primarily \nfrom  three  sources:  non-debt  capital  receipts (disinvestment  income),  reduced fiscal  transfers, \nand higher dividend income. In addition, the government will reduce its contingent liabilities once \npensions and related retirement liabilities are funded appropriately.36 \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\nSubprogram  2  has  many  policy  actions  that  will  promote  good  governance  in  public \n25. \nservice  delivery.  Improving  internal  audit,  and  accounting  practices  of  Pakistan  Railways  are \ncovered  under  subprogram  2.  Several  initiatives  will  be  introduced  under  the  programmatic \napproach  to  (i)  improve  internal  audit  based  on  risk  analysis,  (ii)  strengthen  transparency  in \n                                                 \n35 ADB. 1998.

Manila (R50-\n\n36 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n98). \n\n \n\n\fprocurements,  and  (ii)  introduce  financial  statements  that  comply  with  International  Financial \nReporting Standards starting in FY2018.  \n \n26.  Many PSEs do not follow the SECP\u2019s Public Sector Companies (Corporate Governance) \nRules,  2013.  The  program  has  introduced  relevant  policy  actions  to  facilitate  compliance  with \nthese rules, and subprogram 2 will ensure that all PSEs are covered under them. \n \n27. \nwith the government, including the Finance Division of the MOF. \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nC. \n\nSubprogram 2 has a positive impact on poverty reduction and social issues, through two \n28. \ninterlinked  mechanisms.  First,  support  for  augmenting  and  sustaining  the  government\u2019s \ndevelopment  financing  will  substantially  impact  human  and  income  poverty.  Second,  many \nreforms  will  help  the  government  reduce  the  economic  and  fiscal  costs  that  Pakistan\u2019s  PSEs \nimpose  on  consumers,  taxpayers,  and  beneficiaries  of  social  services.  Subprogram  2  will \nmaximize the benefits that private management and improved corporate and sector governance \ncan  bring  to  the  economic  efficiency  and  financial  feasibility  of  PSEs.  These  changes  are \nexpected  to  improve  access  to  basic  services  such  as  electricity  (through  power  distribution \ncompanies)  and  public  transportation  (through  railways).  The  PSEs  to  be  restructured  and \nprivatized  may  decrease  their  demand  for  low-skilled  labor  in  the  future.  The  programmatic \napproach will therefore facilitate critical initiatives, through the targeted policy actions, to address \nlabor issues, particularly related to retirement benefits and alternative skills development.37 The \nreform  measures  under  subprogram  2  will  in  turn  help  free  government  fiscal  resources, \nfacilitating  higher  public  spending  on  social  sectors,  particularly  health,  education,  and  social \nprotection.  Subprogram  2  has  important  gender  impacts.  Policy  measures  will  support  gender \ninclusiveness  by  ensuring  mandatory  representation  of  women  on  PSE  boards,  and  mandate \nregular reporting of gender statistics of PSE boards.38 The mandatory presence of at least one \nfemale member on each PSE board under the approved change in the Companies Bill 2017 will \nincrease women\u2019s representation to at least 15% from the current low level of 4% (commercial \nPSCs) and 3% (noncommercial PSCs). \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n29. \nGiven  the  nature  of  subprogram  2,  all  three  safeguard  categories  (environment, \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples)  are  categorized  as  C.  Safeguards  due \ndiligence  shows  policy  actions  associated  with  subprogram  2  will  not  result  in  any  involuntary \nresettlement or environmental impacts. \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n30.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in the table and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.39 The  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\n                                                 \n37 ADB is also proposing skills development programs through loan and TA projects in Pakistan. \n38 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n39 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fSummary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nContinued commitment of the government \ntowards reform measures envisaged under the \nprogrammatic approach is not sustained. \n\nContinuous engagement by Asian Development \nBank (ADB) and development partners with all \nlevels of government, especially during the post-\nprogram period to highlight the importance of \nsustaining reform momentum to ensure (i) high \ngrowth, and (ii) long-term engagement with the \ndevelopment partners.   \nContinuous engagement by ADB with all levels of \ngovernment and the incoming government. \n\nContinuous engagement by ADB and development \npartners with all levels of government to highlight \nthe importance of retaining quality human \nresources to sustain reform initiatives. \n\nElections and political unrest may delay \nconsolidation of some reforms affecting program \noutputs.  \nTrained staff are not retained in the relevant line \ndepartments, complicating replication of their \nvarious technical assignments after the \ncompletion of the program. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITION \n\n31. \nThe government and MOF have assured ADB that implementation of subprogram 2 shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the loan documents. \n \n32. \nthe policy matrix in respect of subprogram 2 have been fully complied with.  \n\nIt is a condition of loan effectiveness that ADB is satisfied that all policy actions set out in \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  policy-based  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \n33. \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloan of $300,000,000 to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for subprogram 2 of the Public Sector \nEnterprises Reform Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in concessional terms, with \nan interest charge at the rate of 2% per year during the grace period and thereafter; for a term of \n25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n1 June 2017 \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nImpact the Program is Aligned with \nNet fiscal transfers to PSEs from the federal budget reduced (Pakistan 2025: One Nation\u2013One Vision)a \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nData Sources \nand Reporting \nMechanisms \n\na\u2013b.
