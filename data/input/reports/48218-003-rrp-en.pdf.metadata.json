The  report  also  describes  proposed \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  for  Institutional  Strengthening  of  the  Nepal  Rural  Road  Sector  for \nSustainable  Development,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.  \n\n2. \nThe  project  will  improve  the  accessibility  of the road network  in  agriculture  value  chain \ndevelopment  zones  in  Nepal  and thereby  increase rural  population  engagement  in  agricultural \nproduction and agribusiness development. It will improve 388 kilometers (km) of rural roads to all-\nweather  standards  in  16  districts  located  in  five  states, and  enhance  the  capacity  of  the  rural \ninfrastructure agency to address institutional constraints on rural road development. 1  \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nNepal  is  one  of  the  least  developed  countries  in  the  world  and  has  the  second-lowest \n3. \ngross domestic product (GDP) per capita in South Asia. One-fifth of its population lives below the \nnational poverty line and is concentrated in rural areas.2 Between 2012 and 2016, Nepal's real \nGDP grew at an average annual rate of 3.4%. In 2017, GDP increased to 6.9%, recovering from \nlower GDP growth after the 2015 earthquake.3 Although services comprised the largest sector, \nequivalent  to  48%  of  GDP  during  this  period,  the  majority  of  the  country\u2019s  working  population \n(65%\u201370%) are employed in the agriculture sector, which contributes 35% to the country\u2019s GDP. \nThis  underscores  how  vital  the  agriculture  sector  is,  especially  to  Nepalis  living  and  finding \nsustenance in rural areas where poverty is widespread. \n\n4. \nNepal\u2019s  agriculture  suffers  generally  from  low  productivity  caused  by  high  transaction \ncosts  stemming from  poor  connectivity  between farms  and  markets,  poor  economies  of  scale, \nand poor quality of produce, compounded by weak agricultural research and development. The \ncountry\u2019s  three  distinct  agro-ecological  zones\u2014terai  (lowland),  hills,  and  mountains\u2014influence \nagricultural  production  and  define  economic  opportunities  and  the  constraints  facing  farmers. \nWhile  the  geography  creates  difficulties,  the  wide  range  of  agro-ecological  zones  and  micro \nclimates makes possible the production of a broad range of agricultural outputs. This creates the \npotential to improve agricultural productivity and farm incomes, and meet demands of domestic, \nregional, and global markets.  \n\n5. \nRecognizing this vast potential, the Government of Nepal took a bold step to bring in much-\nneeded  development  to  the  sector  by  signing  the  Agriculture  Development  Strategy  (ADS)  in \n2015. 4 The  government  recognized  that  dramatic  changes  were  needed,  such  as  improving \nconnectivity, promoting agribusiness, and increasing commercialization across the sector, if the \nsector was to perform to its potential and raise its long-term annual growth rate from 3% to the \ngovernment\u2019s  goal  of  5%.  The  ADS  recognizes  access  as  a  major  constraint  on  developing \nagriculture, particularly commercial agriculture value chains. Nepal\u2019s current road network has a \ntotal length of 70,126 km, of which 12,494 km form the strategic road network\u2014the core network \nof national highways and feeder roads connecting district headquarters. The remaining 57,632 \nkm are classified as the local road network\u2014rural roads connecting rural communities to district \nheadquarters.5 Nepal's geology and topography, combined with its rural population distribution, \n                                                \n1   State  1  (Panchthar,  Ilam,  Jhapa,  Morang,  Sunsary,  and  Dhankuta),  State  3  (Sindhuli,  Kavre,  Sindhupalchowk, \n\nDolakha, Bhaktapur, Kathmandu, and Chitwon), State 4 (Parbat), State 5 (Rolpa), and State 6 (Rukum). \n\n2   $1.90 purchasing power parity per day. \n3   R.

Kathmandu. \n\n\frestricts  and  complicates  efforts  to  provide  all-weather  road  connectivity  to  rural  communities. \nOnly 3.5% of the local road network is paved, while the rest is either gravel or earth roads. During \nthe  rainy  season,  the  majority  of  rural  roads  are  not  operational  and  are  in  poor  condition, \nrestricting  access  to  markets,  schools,  and  hospitals,  and  limiting  economic  opportunities  and \nsocial services in general. \n\n6. \nRural  transport  in  many  high-potential  agricultural  production  areas  is  limited  to  earth \nroads  which  are  not  operational  after  rains,  resulting  in  high  transport  costs  and  losses  of \nproduction quality and quantity. The average travel time required for rural households to reach \npublic  facilities  and  markets  is  prohibitively  long.  An  average  household needs  to  spend  more \nthan  3.5  hours  to  reach  the  nearest  bus  stop  and  more  than  2.0  hours  to  the  nearest  market \ncenter. Nearly 40% of rural households live more than 2 hours away from paved roads, over 25% \nlive 2 hours away from the nearest bus stop or telephone booth, while a little less than 33% are 2 \nhours away from a market center. The ADS emphasizes the urgent need for rural road access to \nproductive agricultural areas, and provides a target for the upgrading or construction of 50 km of \nrural roads per district during the first 5 years of the strategy period (2015 to 2020). In addition to \ncoverage, quality of transport infrastructure should be ensured since it will greatly impact on rural \ncommunities\u2019 access to economic and social services, assistance during emergency events, and \naccess  to  markets  for  agricultural  inputs  and  produce.  Improving  rural  road  connectivity  and \ntransport  efficiency  throughout  Nepal  is  thus key  to  ensuring that  benefits  of  economic growth \nreach rural areas. However, many rural roads are either missing links (the \u201clast mile\u201d connecting \nto the core network), or only offer seasonal access, isolating a large portion of the population in \nrural  areas  during  the  rainy  season.  Constructing  all-weather  roads  and  ensuring  sustainable \nmaintenance  of  the  constructed  roads  is  required  to  improve  the  rural  road  connectivity  and \nefficiency as envisaged in the ADS. \n\n7. \nOnly 17% of the rural population in Nepal has access to all-weather roads, compared with \n60% in India and 37% in Bangladesh. The project will improve 388 km of rural roads to all-weather \nstandards,  serving  the  agriculture  sector  and  7.5  million  rural  people  (28.5%  of  the  country\u2019s \npopulation) in 16 districts in five states (footnote 1), which are critical to the agriculture value chain \ndevelopment  zones as  identified  by  the  Prime  Minister  Agriculture  Modernization Project.6 The \nproject will support the ADS goals of increasing agricultural productivity, encouraging commercial \nagriculture  and  agribusiness  development,  increasing  employment  opportunities  for  rural  poor \npeople, and reducing the poverty level. All the rural roads have been selected from the district \nroad  master  plans  through robust  selection  criteria  which  include  an  objective  assessment  for \nprioritization.  The  selection  criteria  took  into  consideration  the  population  size,  each  district\u2019s \nagricultural potential, the number of agricultural farms and commercial establishments, economic \npotential, and access to education facilities, aligned with the ADS. \n\n8. \nThe  project  is  consistent  with  the  strategic  objective  set  out  in  the  government\u2019s \nFourteenth Plan (2017\u20132019) to expand the rural road capacity to increase connectivity, provide \ngreater  access  to  social  services  and  markets,  and  promote  the  agriculture  sector. 7  The \ngovernment  also  committed  in  the  recent  2017  Vientiane  Declaration  on  Sustainable  Rural \nTransport  to  promote  inclusive,  affordable,  accessible,  and  sustainable  rural  transport \ninfrastructure and services.8 The project is in line with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country \npartnership strategy, 2013\u20132017.9 The project is also included in the country operations business \nplan, 2018\u20132020 for Nepal.10  \n\n                                                \n6   Out of seven super zones, five have been selected. Of the 30 districts, seven have been selected and farmers of the \nrespective districts will benefit from the project. Ministry of Finance. 2016.

The  project  builds  on  the  experience  and  key \n9. \nsuccesses  of  ADB-supported  rural  road  programs  in  India  and  Sri  Lanka,  particularly  on  (i) \nstrengthening institutional capacity, (ii) designing rural roads to all-weather standards with safety \nfeatures,  and (iii)  improving road maintenance.11 The  project  executing  agency,  Department  of \nLocal Infrastructure Development and Agricultural Roads (DOLIDAR), assists local governments \nin  engineering  aspects  of  various  infrastructures.  Due  to  its  broad  mandate  of  infrastructure \ndevelopment at the district level, there is much room to improve business procedures covering \nthe  whole  life  cycle  of  rural  roads,  and  strengthen  related  capacities  of  DOLIDAR  staff.  The \nproposed TA will strengthen DOLIDAR as a key institution in the rural road sector contributing to \nsustainable development in the country. Road traffic accidents are rising in Nepal because of the \nincreasing  number  of  vehicles  and  unsafe  road  conditions.  The  project  design  adapted \nappropriate measures, including cautionary and informatory signs, guard posts, speed breakers, \nobject markers,  and temporary  traffic  control measures during  construction  at  settlements  and \ncritical  locations,  and safety  trainings for  vulnerable road users  including  women and children. \nThe  government  has  increased  its  annual  budget  for  local  road  network  construction  and \nmaintenance from $264 million in 2014 to $546 million in 2017, and several development partners \nare participating in improving rural road maintenance.12 However, the majority of the rural road \nnetwork comprises earth roads which become impassable during the rainy season. To address \nthis  issue,  the  project  roads  will  be  improved  to  all-weather  standards.  This  will  significantly \nimprove  the  maintainability  of  the  rural  road  network.  In  addition,  civil  works  contracts  for  the \nproject roads will include post-completion performance-based maintenance for 3 years. It aims to \nassess the efficacy of adapting long-term performance-based maintenance by the private sector \nin Nepal, and encourage its use where appropriate. The possible benefits include better quality \nassurance and greater efficiency, which can further enable the prioritization of budget allocation \nfor rural road maintenance. \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n10. \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: connectivity between rural communities, \nproductive agricultural areas, and socio-economic centers in Nepal improved (footnote 7). The \nproject will have the following outcome: transport efficiency on project roads increased.13 \n\nC. \n\nOutputs  \n\n11. \nOutput  1:  Rural  road  conditions  between  the  selected  rural  communities, \nproductive  agricultural  areas,  and  socio-economic  centers  improved.  Road  conditions  of \nabout 388 km rural roads between the selected rural communities, productive agricultural areas, \nand socio-economic centers will be improved to all-weather standards with safety features,14 and \nwill be maintained for 3 years.15  \n\n12. \nOutput 2: Capacity of rural infrastructure agency and road users in project areas \nenhanced. Capacity development of DOLIDAR will involve (i) trainings on safeguards, road safety \nawareness,  road  asset  management,  contract  management,  and  rural  road  design  and \nconstruction;  (ii)  development  of  vision,  policy,  a  business  plan,  and  institutional  structure \nframeworks for a state-of-the-art rural road agency; (iii) development of pavement design, quality \ncontrol,  and  road  safety  guidelines;  and  (iv) development  of  a  detailed  design  for  the  future \n\n                                                \n11  ADB.  2005.

A project coordination unit  (PCU) will be \nestablished  at  the  central  level  in  DOLIDAR.  Under  the  PCU,  five  project  implementation  units,  with  permanent \nengineers deputed from DOLIDAR, will be established in five states each administering non-overlapping contracts. \n\n \n\n\fIII. \n\nATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n18. \nTransaction technical  assistance (TA)  will  be  provided for Institutional  Strengthening  of \nthe  Nepal  Rural  Road  Sector  for  Sustainable  Development.  The  focus  of  the  TA  will  be  to \n(i) redefine and restructure DOLIDAR  into a state-of-the-art rural road agency, and (ii) develop \nand implement new business procedures, and train DOLIDAR and state and municipal officials to \nenable  DOLIDAR  to  adopt  a  new  institutional  and  management  structure.  New  business \nprocedures  will  cover  (i) planning  processes,  (ii)  procurement  and  contracting  processes,  (iii) \nquality  assurance  systems,  (iv) engineering,  and  (v)  human  resource  management.  The  TA  is \nestimated to cost $1,250,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6).21 The government will provide counterpart support \nin the form of counterpart staff, office space, workshop venues, and other in-kind contributions. \nThe executing agency of the TA will be the Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development \n(MOFALD) through DOLIDAR. A Kathmandu-based project coordination unit established within \nDOLIDAR will support the implementation of the TA. The TA will be implemented over 12 months, \nfrom  October  2018  to  September  2019.  An  international  consulting  firm  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime) to help with this work (footnote 16). \n\nA. \n\nTechnical  \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nDOLIDAR prepared the detailed design of the project roads using its own resources and \n19. \nis compliant with the government\u2019s standards and specifications for rural roads to improve project \nreadiness.  The  project  adopted  environmentally  friendly  road  construction  practices  and  a \nparticipatory  approach  in  project  preparation  through  transect  surveys,  which  enhanced  the \nclimate-resilience  aspect  of  the  design.  These  practices  emphasize  the  use  of  (i)  existing \nalignments; (ii) mass-balancing to minimize soil and vegetation disturbance and risk of erosion; \n(iii) flexible, porous gabions to stabilize steep slopes; and (iv) bio-engineering to minimize erosion \nfrom exposed soils, while the participatory approach incorporates local knowledge into the design \nof sections that are prone to flooding and erosion. With bidding documents ready, advance actions \nhave been taken to ensure that construction can commence early.  \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial  \n\nEconomic  viability.  The economic  analysis  was  carried  out  in accordance  with ADB\u2019s \n20. \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.22 The proposed project will improve connectivity \nin the rural communities in 16 districts by upgrading fair-weather roads to all-weather roads, and \nwill  have  large  positive  impacts  on  agricultural  productivity  and  quality  of  life,  with  rural \ncommunities having better access to health and education.23  The principal benefits considered \nin the analysis were transport cost savings in terms of vehicle operating costs, and travel time \nsavings  of  the  existing  and  incremental  traffic  of  people  and  goods  over  the  analysis  period, \nseparately capturing the additional cost of travel and transportation during the rainy season when \nroads are not accessible. With the project providing reliable all-year connectivity and significantly \nlowering  transportation  costs,  there  will  be  increased  agricultural  production  and  crop \ndiversification in the project areas, but these are not quantified and included in the analysis. The \neconomic  analysis  indicated  that  the  project  is  economically  viable  overall,  with  an  economic \ninternal rate of return of 13.4%, with all individual road projects having an economic internal rate \nof return above the acceptable rate of return of 9.0%. Sensitivity analysis indicated that with a \n10%  increase  in  capital  costs  or  a  10%  decrease  in  benefits  the  overall  investment  remains \neconomically viable. \n\n                                                \n21  Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22  ADB. 2017.

MOFALD\u2019s budget allocation has more than doubled in 3 years \n21. \nfrom about $404 million in 2014 to $906 million in 2017; about 60% of this funding, i.e., about \n$546 million, is estimated to be available for rural road construction and maintenance in 2017. The \nRoad  Board  Nepal  (RBN)  generates  revenue  from  fuel  levies  and  toll  charges,  and  provides \nmaintenance funding for rural roads. The allocation from the RBN has also more than doubled \nduring 2017; about $16.7 million for rural road maintenance. Rural road maintenance is currently \nundertaken through district development committees and district technical offices with DOLIDAR \nproviding  the  overall  administrative,  technical,  and  program  support.  There  is  an  established \nmaintenance  planning  and  budget  allocation  system  in  Nepal  with  the  district  development \ncommittees preparing an annual road maintenance plan; budget is allocated based on this plan. \nRural  communities  are  involved  in  road  maintenance  activities  through  the  road  maintenance \ngroups.  Development  partners  also  support  rural  road  maintenance  in  Nepal.  The  annual \nmaintenance funding requirement for rural roads which are in maintainable condition (comprising \nabout one-third of the rural roads) is estimated at about $90 million per year, or about 25% of the \naverage  annual  budget  allocation  from  2013  to  2017.  An  assessment  of  maintenance \nrequirements  and  budget  allocation  indicated that  with  the  annual  road maintenance  plan,  the \nmaintenance needs of upgraded roads will be fully met. To further support financial sustainability, \nthe  project  will  include  performance-based  maintenance  in  civil  works  contracts  for  3  years  to \nensure  better  asset  quality  and  improved  maintenance.  DOLIDAR  has  established  a  rural \ntransport information and management system which incorporates improved asset management \npractices. DOLIDAR\u2019s capacity on fund and asset management will be strengthened through the \nattached TA. \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n22. \nInstitutional.  DOLIDAR  was  established  in  1998  under  MOFALD  as  the  lead  national \ninstitution for supporting local infrastructure initiatives. DOLIDAR is responsible for assisting local \ngovernments in the districts in engineering aspects of civil engineering construction. This includes \nplanning of local rural roads, irrigation and river control, water supply and sanitation, suspension \nbridges,  housing  and  building,  and  rural  energy  under  the  ministry  in  coordination  with  local \nauthorities.  In the  rural  transport  subsector,  DOLIDAR  is  responsible for  the  development  and \nmaintenance of the local road network (57,632 km) connecting to major feeder roads and national \narterial roads. DOLIDAR is headed by a director general who reports to the secretary of MOFALD. \nDOLIDAR is experienced in implementing projects funded by development partners such as ADB, \nthe  World  Bank,  Swiss  Agency  for  Development  and  Cooperation,  and  the  Department  for \nInternational Development of the United Kingdom. \n\n23. \nFinancial  management.  The  financial  management  risk  is  moderate.  DOLIDAR  has \nimplemented five ADB projects with the first one approved in 2004; three projects are ongoing. \nThe  department  has  a  dedicated  finance  section  with  sufficient  staff  and  adequate  capacity  in \nfinancial accounting and ADB disbursement procedures. Overall, the disbursement and budgeting \nmechanisms  are  adequate.  However,  improvements  are  required  in  the  areas  of  internal  audit \nfunction,  detailed  accounting  and  financial  reporting,  and  effective  use  of  available  accounting \nsoftware.  To  strengthen  DOLIDAR\u2019s  financial  management  and  internal  control,  the  project \ncoordination  unit  will  (i) develop  internal  audit  control  guidelines  for  the  project,  (ii)  engage  a \nfinancial  expert  to  conduct  internal  checks  and  controls  and  work  on  the  integration  of  project \naccounting  with  DOLIDAR\u2019s  financial  management  information  systems,  and  (iii)  adopt  a \ncomputerized government accounting system for accounting and monitoring. Each of the project \nimplementation units will have one accountant. Project management staff will be trained on ADB \npolicies and procedures on loan disbursement, financial reports, and audit requirements. \n\n24. \nProcurement  and  anticorruption.  Procurement  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). The government promulgated the \nPublic Procurement Act (2007) and Public Procurement Regulations (2007), both of which are \ngenerally acceptable to ADB and encompass best international procurement practices. The Public \nProcurement Monitoring Office was assigned as the national procurement oversight body under \n\n \n\n \n\n\fthe  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  and  Council  of  Ministers.  The  government  will  publish  project \ninformation on DOLIDAR\u2019s website, including business opportunities associated with the project.  \n\n25. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  DOLIDAR.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 16). \n\nD. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nPoverty  reduction  and  social  impact.  There  are  7.5  million  people  (or  28.5%  of  the \n26. \ncountry\u2019s  population)  living  in  16  districts  crossed  by  the  project  roads.  The  coverage  of  all-\nweather roads is about 35% of the total road network in these districts compared to the national \naverage of 67%. Household surveys carried out in the project area reveal that the major sources \nof income are agricultural produce (20%), trade and business (12%), and services (10%). The \nresults of a household survey among 30% of the total number of households and 178 focus group \ndiscussions conducted as part of the poverty and social assessment indicate that the project will \nincrease  economic  and  employment  opportunities.  The  project  will  generate  an  estimated  3.8 \nmillion person-days of employment over the construction and maintenance periods.  \n\n27. \nGender  equality  and  social  inclusion.  The  poverty  and  social  analysis  included  a \ngender  assessment  based  on  the  socio-economic  characteristics  of  6,742  women  and \nconsultations  with  584  women.  Overall,  women  were  supportive  of  the  project  because  of  the \npotential  access  to  economic  opportunities  and  services.  The  project  is  categorized  effective \ngender  mainstreaming,  and  a  gender  equality  and  social  inclusion  (GESI)  action  plan  was \nprepared,  which  includes  the  following  activities:  (i) target  at  least  33%  women  participants  in \nproject  orientation,  planning,  and  public  and  social  auditing  of  project  roads;  (ii)  conduct \nawareness training on STI including HIV/AIDS, and anti-human-trafficking to 4,000 people and \nsecondary school children; (iii) implement core labor standards with gender-inclusive provisions \nand women-friendly work environments; (iv) conduct road safety awareness programs to 4,000 \npeople (including 40% women) and 27 schAools along the project roads; (v) develop and deliver \nspecial livelihood enhancement skills training to all project-affected vulnerable households and to \n200 poor families living in the project areas, with 33% women targeted; and (vi) conduct technical \ntraining  of  DOLIDAR  staff  including  women  staff.  GESI  experts  and  field  staff  will  be  hired  to \nensure effective implementation of the GESI action plan.  \n\n28. \nSTI,  including  HIV/AIDS,  and  human  trafficking.  The  National  Center  for  AIDS  and \nSexually Transmitted Diseases Control under the Ministry of Health and Population coordinates \nactivities  under  the  National  AIDS  Strategy,  2006\u20132011,  which  emphasizes  prevention  as  the \nmost  effective  response.24 The  Ministry  of  Women,  Children,  and  Social  Welfare  coordinates \nactivities to counter human trafficking. A large amount of information and print material on human \ntrafficking  has  been  developed  with  the  support  of  the  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment,  which  will  be  reproduced  for  use  in  project  areas.  The  project  incorporates \nmeasures  to  mitigate  STI  (including  HIV/AIDS)  risks  and  counter  human  trafficking  by  having \nconsultants conduct awareness programs in the corridors of influence. The civil works contractors \nwill  carry  out  STI  (including  HIV/AIDS)  and  human  trafficking  awareness  sessions  for  their \nlaborers at work sites, which will be monitored by the construction supervision consultant. \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n29. \ncategories are as follows.25 \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\n                                                \n24 Government of Nepal, National Center for AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Diseases Control. 2011.

Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nEnvironment (category B). Impacts from all 27 roads were screened and assessed using \n30. \nan environmental checklist developed in similar projects and adapted to local conditions and road \ndesign (footnote 11). A single initial environmental examination report was prepared in line with \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  Most  of  the  negative  impacts  are  coterminous  with  the \nconstruction  stage,  site  specific,  limited  within  the  construction  corridor,  and  easily  mitigated. \nAnticipated environmental impacts are typical to road construction, such as the generation of dust, \nnoise,  exhaust,  and  waste  from  construction  and  worker  camps;  water  contamination;  and \noccupational health and safety hazards. Mitigation measures for all impacts have been developed \nand  integrated  into  construction  works  through  incorporation  of  a  standard  environmental \nmanagement  plan  in  the  bidding  documents  and  provision  of  road-specific  environmental \nmanagement  plans  with  the  detailed  project  reports.  An  integrated  social  and  environmental \ngrievance redress mechanism has been formed to continue receiving feedback and complaints \nfrom  affected  parties  and  addressing  them  during  the  construction  and  operation  stages.  To \nensure  the  effective  implementation  of  safeguard  requirements,  the  existing  institutional \ncapacities  and  arrangements  will  be  augmented  by  environmental  experts  in  the  project \ncoordination  unit  and  the  construction  supervision  consultant.  The  initial  environmental \nexamination report will be disclosed on the ADB and DOLIDAR websites. \n\n Involuntary resettlement (category C). The construction will be carried out mostly within \n31. \nexisting  road  corridors  and  rights-of-way,  with  minor  widening  because of  road  safety  in some \ncases, which will require narrow strips of land (less than 5% of total holdings) to be made available. \nDue diligence identified no major impacts to land and no displacement of structures, private trees, \nor community resource properties. A grievance redress mechanism  will be set up in all project \nareas. Should land be required when implementing projects, the voluntary land donation system \nwill  be  used.  Specific  procedural  requirements  for  land  donation,  involving  comprehensive \nconsultations  with  the  communities,  have  been  prepared  in  the  community  participation \nframework (CPF)26 which  was  developed  in  similar  projects  (footnote  11).  The  government  will \nensure  that  land  donation  is  undertaken  without  coercion  and  documented  in  a  transparent \nmanner, and will have the process verified by an independent monitor. The CPF was disclosed \non the ADB website and also includes a mitigation measures matrix which details the types of \nsupport provided for all types of losses, including special assistance for vulnerable households. \n\n32. \nIndigenous peoples (category C). The project will improve existing road corridors and \nrights-of-way and thus will not have any impact on the culture, human rights, or livelihood systems. \nThe social assessment identified the presence of Janajati (indigenous peoples) in project areas. \nHowever, these groups are largely assimilated into the local population. The project will not have \nany differential impact on indigenous peoples; they will receive similar benefits from the project to \nthose received by nonindigenous peoples, and there will be no impact on their tribal and cultural \nidentity.  To  further  mitigate  the  risks,  the  CPF  identifies  special  provisions  for  any  affected \nindigenous peoples, ensuring that their living standards are not adversely affected by the project.  \n\nF. \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\n33. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.27 \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nRisks \n\nUnstable  political  environment \ncould delay implementation \n\nGeneral risks associated with the internal security situation and political \ninstability  in  certain  parts  of  the  country  can  hinder  construction \nactivities.
