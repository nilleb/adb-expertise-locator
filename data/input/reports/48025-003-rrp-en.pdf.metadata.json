THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Corridor 2 \n(Pap\u2013Namangan\u2013Andijan) Railway Electrification Project.1 \n \n2.  The project aims to electrify the remaining 145.1 kilometers (km) of non-electrified track \nlinking major cities in the populous Fergana Valley with Tashkent. This will facilitate direct and \nefficient operation of both freight and passenger train services, and promote the socioeconomic \ndevelopment of the Fergana Valley.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Strategic location. Surrounded by Afghanistan to the south, Kazakhstan to the north \nand northwest, the Kyrgyz Republic to the northeast, Turkmenistan to the southwest, and \nTajikistan to the southeast, Uzbekistan serves three of six Central Asia Regional Economic \nCooperation  (CAREC)  corridors.  With  31  million  people,  Uzbekistan  is  the  most  populous \ncountry in Central Asia. Being a double landlocked country requiring crossing at least two \ncountries to reach seaports, transport plays an important role in sustaining its socioeconomic \ndevelopment.  \n \n4.  The  project  targets  the  Fergana  Valley,  which  covers  the  Andijan,  Fergana,  and \nNamangan  regions of Uzbekistan. The valley is home to nearly one-third of the country\u2019s \npopulation and has a population density of 468 people per square kilometer. The valley holds \nvast  industrial  and  agricultural  potential  which  remains  to  be  fully  tapped.  Poor  transport \nconnectivity is one of the obstacles to the development of the Fergana Valley. \n \n5.  Critical role of railways. Rail transport has a unique competitive advantage over road \ntransport  for  moving  commodities  and  goods  in  bulk  over  long  distances.  The  4,669  km \nUzbekistan rail network carries about 60 million tons of freight and 15 million passengers \nannually. Since 2004, Uzbekistan\u2019s gross domestic product has grown by more than 7% per \nyear. This has contributed to strong demand for rail transport. Improvements in relationships \nbetween Uzbekistan and its immediate neighbors will further add to such demand. \n \n6.  Major achievements. Uzbekistan has continued to modernize its railway infrastructure. \nSince its founding in 1994, O\u2019zbekiston Temir Yo\u2019llari (UTY), the vertically integrated public \nrailway  company,  has  gradually  implemented  a  holistic  railway  modernization  program, \nincluding the completion of a unified rail network, electrification and modernization of existing \nlines, and improvement of rolling stock. The government accorded particular importance to \nelectrification, with 2,446 km or 52% of the network now electrified.3 Such efforts have also been \nsupported by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Japan International \nCooperation Agency, Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW), Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic \nDevelopment, Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Fund for International \nDevelopment, the People\u2019s Republic of China, and the World Bank.4 \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for Central Asia Regional \nEconomic Cooperation Corridor 2 (Pap\u2013Namangan\u2013Andijan) Railway Electrification Project (TA 8706-UZB). \n3  Government of Uzbekistan, Decree of the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan no. PP-993; 5 November 2008. \n4  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "2 \n7.  UTY  has  worked  with  development  partners  to  undertake  institutional  reforms. \nWith support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the government initiated UTY reforms in \n1997,  under  which  ancillary  rail  services  were  largely  separated  from  core  operations.5 \nThe  downsizing  of  staff  and  noncore  assets  improved  the  efficiency  and  sustainability  of \noperations. Since 2015, the World Bank is supporting the further modernization of business \nprocesses, including accounting system reform. Even with these reforms, the nature of railways \nas a public good requires the continued support of the public sector. \n \n8.  Remaining  challenges.  Despite  these  efforts,  the  railways  still  face  long  transport \ntimes, inadequate service quality, and high operating costs, because of aged or inadequate \ninfrastructure, operational inefficiencies, competition from road transport, and an insufficient \nnumber of locomotives. This results in lost economic opportunities, suboptimal regional trade, \nand negative environmental impacts. The project tackles this core problem by accelerating \ninvestment in critical railway infrastructure, namely, the electrification of non-electrified tracks in \nthe densely populated Fergana Valley. \n \n9.  Envisaged benefits. The project will increase the mobility of goods and people in the \nFergana Valley, improve environmental and safety performance of railways, and accelerate \nregional connectivity. As of 2016, rail operations on the Pap\u2013Namangan\u2013Andijan line are limited \nto two passenger trains and three freight trains per day. By extending an adjacent project being \nundertaken by UTY to electrify the Pap\u2013Kokand\u2013Margilan\u2013Andijan line, the project will allow \nreliable, more frequent, and higher-speed connections between the major cities and towns in \nthe Fergana Valley. \n \n10.  Switching from diesel to electric traction will reduce the amount of noise, vibration, and \nair pollution from each train. By increasing the capacity and attractiveness of rail travel, the \nproject will help shift transport away from roads and reduce local pollutants and greenhouse \ngases. The project will reduce carbon dioxideemissions by 10,000 tons per year. Operational \n \nsafety in the Fergana Valley will be improved through a dedicated project component on railway \nsafety. \n \n11.  The  project  supports  the  development  of  the  Fergana  Valley\u2013Tashkent  Economic \nCorridor.  The  completion  of  the  Pap\u2013Angren  line  in  mid-2016  allowed  for  the  first  time  a \ncontinuous, electrified railway link between the Fergana Valley and Tashkent. The project will \nextend the electrified network to major cities and towns in the Fergana Valley. Travel time from \nNamangan to Tashkent will be cut from the current 5 hours by road to about 3 hours by rail, \nenabling  better  access  to  employment  opportunities  in  Tashkent.  Also,  businesses \nheadquartered in Tashkent will be able to move more of its activities to the Fergana Valley. \nFor freight transport, UTY forecasts up to a fourfold increase in the amount of freight to be \ncarried annually between the Fergana Valley and Tashkent, subject to the electrification of lines \nin the Fergana Valley being completed. \n \n12.  The project railway is part of CAREC Corridor 2, linking Uzbekistan to the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China to the east and Europe to the west. The project railway forms a central link on \nCAREC designated rail corridors 202 and 203.6 \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 1998.

ADB has provided two loans to Uzbekistan for the rehabilitation and \nmodernization of the railway infrastructure, and a loan for the electrification of a railway line \nbetween  Marakand  and  Karshi. 7  ADB\u2019s  Independent  Evaluation  Department  rated  the \nrehabilitation  and  modernization  projects  successful  and  the  government\u2019s  and  UTY\u2019s \nperformance highly satisfactory.8 The electrification project is substantially complete, ahead of \nschedule, and on budget. Lessons learned from the implementation of these projects include \n(i) scoping the project to focus on components that add most value to UTY, i.e., electrification, \nas opposed to general track works; (ii) designing realistic capacity development components to \navoid an ad hoc approach to process reforms that cannot be completed within the project time \nframe; and (iii) optimally packaging procurement to maximize competition and avoid delays. \n \nB.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n14.  The project will be aligned with the following impacts: (i) stimulated economic growth in \nthe Fergana Valley, and (ii) increased regional trade along CAREC Corridor 2. The outcome will \nbe the improved level of passenger and freight service on the Pap\u2013Namangan\u2013Andijan railway \nline. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n15.  Output 1: Railway infrastructure along the Pap\u2013Namangan\u2013Andijan line upgraded. \nThe  project  will  electrify  145.1  km  of  the  single-track  main  railway  line  to  27.5  kilovolts \nalternating current. This electrification includes the locomotive depot in Andijan, a spur line to \nUchkurgan, and a bypass being constructed by UTY and the government (para. 16). It will also \nconstruct two traction substations and dispatcher points, procure maintenance equipment and \nmachinery, modernize signaling and communications facilities, and construct external power \nsupply facilities that will transmit electricity from the main grid to the traction substations. \n \n16.  The project will build upon another initiative by UTY and the government to realign 6.7 \nkm of the railway line to bypass a section of the line that currently traverses the territory of the \nKyrgyz Republic. The construction of this bypass is not part of the proposed ADB project. The \nconstruction of the bypass is expected to be substantially completed by the first quarter of 2018. \n \n17.  Output 2: Safety of railway operations improved. It is expected that train frequencies \nand speeds will increase as a result of the project. Furthermore, the power lines may pose \nelectrocution risks. To offset any potential negative impacts, the project will support UTY in  \n(i) assessing the existing and anticipated safety situation to the general public; (ii) supporting the \ndevelopment  of  practical  countermeasures;  and  (iii)  training  staff  to  plan  future  railway \ndevelopments  in  the  safest  manner.  The  needs  of  women  and  children  will  be  explicitly \nconsidered in the development of safety measures. Training of UTY staff will extend to all \nrelevant female staff. \n \n18.  Value added by ADB. ADB will add value to the project primarily through the injection of \ninternational best practice in the development of a low-carbon, safe, and sustainable mode of \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 1998.

This will continue throughout project \nimplementation,  including  through  the  supervision  consultants.  Better  operational  safety  of \nrailways, brought about by output 2, will provide a blueprint for improvements in other parts of \nthe UTY-operated network. In implementing the project, UTY will also build its capacity in the \ncost-efficient procurement of goods and plant under international competitive bidding. This will \nalso support UTY\u2019s efforts to tap into international financing sources for investments in railways. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n19.  The  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $177.45  million  (Table  1).  It  is  proposed  that  the  \n$80 million ADB loan will finance (i) supervision consultants; (ii) procurement of plant, i.e., \ndesign,  delivery,  installation,  and  commissioning  of  traction  substations  and  section  posts; \nmaterial for overhead catenary system; signaling and communications facilities; and supervisory \ncontrol  and  data  acquisition  system;  (iii)  procurement  of  maintenance  equipment  and \nmachinery;  and  (iv)  procurement  of  materials  for  external  power  supply.  The  government, \nthrough  UTY,  is  expected  to  finance  the  balance,  which  will  cover  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement,  civil  works,  taxes  and  duties,  and  financing  charges  during  implementation. \nDetailed cost estimates by expenditure category and financier are in the project administration \nmanual (PAM). 9 \n \nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

Interest  for  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  loan  during \nconstruction has been calculated at the 5-year forward London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) plus a spread of \n0.5%. Commitment charges for the ADB loan are 0.15% per year to be charged on the undisbursed loan amount. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and O\u2019zbekiston Temir Yo\u2019llari estimates. \n \n20.  UTY and the government have requested a regular loan of $80 million from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of \n0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project \n                                                 \n9  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \nagreements.

Following the methodology developed by the joint climate finance group of multilateral \ndevelopment banks, climate mitigation is estimated to cost $80 million. ADB will finance 100% \nof mitigation costs. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  UTY will be the executing agency. It has a sound track record of execution of similar \nprojects, as well as operation and maintenance of electrified and non-electrified lines. UTY\u2019s \nproject implementation unit (PIU), a structural division in charge of electrification projects, will be \nresponsible for day-to-day implementation of the project. UTY\u2019s other technical departments will \nassist the PIU during project implementation. UTY will coordinate with local government bodies \nin  Andijan  and  Namangan  during  project  preparation  and  implementation.  It  will  work  in \nassociation with Uzbekenergo, the public power utility company, especially on the installation of \nexternal power supply. \n \n23.  All procurement financed under the ADB loan will follow international competitive bidding \nprocedures pursuant to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). \nADB\u2019s prior review procedures will be followed. UTY will include the relevant sections of ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) in all bidding and contractual documents. Civil \nworks and supply of materials and equipment from ADB nonmember countries will be financed \nby UTY from its own resources and procured under existing government procedures consistent \nwith the principles of economy and efficiency. \n \n24.  UTY and ADB have taken advance actions to ensure procurement readiness. UTY \nsolicited expressions of interest for the supervision consultants in January 2017. UTY also \nsubmitted bidding documents for the procurement of maintenance equipment and machinery in \nJanuary 2017. Bidding documents for the procurement of plant, as well as for the procurement \nof materials for external power supply are substantially complete and will be launched prior to \nloan signing. \n \n25.  Additional financing may be considered if the project performs well. Such additional \nfinancing may cover the procurement of electric locomotives, which would be used for trains \nserving the project railway and the wider electrified network. Additional project preparatory \ntechnical assistance will be used to achieve readiness for the additional financing in areas such \nas design, safeguard requirements, and capacity. \n \n26.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n \n27.  The technical features of the project follow well-established engineering practices that \nare  within  the  capacity  and  experience  of  UTY  to  execute.  UTY  successfully  completed \nelectrification of the 114 km Tashkent\u2013Angren section in 2010; the 140 km Marakand\u2013Karshi \nsection in 2015 (under ADB financing); and the 305 km Angren\u2013Pap\u2013Kokand\u2013Andijan section in \n2016 (under World Bank cofinancing). Given that the installation of the overhead catenary \nsystem will be implemented under normal traffic operations, careful coordination with existing \ntrain operations and provision of high-level safety measures for the on-site work will be needed. \nThis  will  also  require  strong  coordination  with  Uzbekenergo  and  local  government  bodies. \nConsidering the need for phasing and interfacing works under various components, a team of \ninternational consultants will assist UTY in supervising construction. UTY also has sufficient \ncapacity  to  operate  and  maintain  electrified  railways.  Currently,  it  maintains  2,446  km  of \nelectrified  lines.  UTY  has  conducted  continuous  staff  training  on  the  maintenance  of  the \nelectrified lines and modernized signaling and communications facilities, as well as the safe \noperation of electric traction locomotives. The same measures will be applied upon completion \nof the project to ensure the efficient and safe operation and maintenance of the project railway. \n \n \n ", "7 \nB.

ADB carried out an economic analysis of the project, comparing the \nincremental costs of the project with the incremental benefits.10 ADB assessed the current and \nforecast  traffic  with  and  without  the  project,  based  on  estimates  made  under  the  recently \ncompleted World Bank cofinanced Pap\u2013Angren Railway Project,11 updated where necessary \nwith information from the feasibility study conducted by UTY and its design institute for the \nproject.12 The main economic benefits of the project are (i) time savings for freight traffic, \n(ii) time savings for passenger journeys, (iii) reductions in carbon dioxide emissions, (iv) energy \ncost savings, and (v) locomotive maintenance cost savings. The project is economically viable, \nwith an economic internal rate of return of 19.7%, and a net present value of $92.12 million at a \n12.0% discount rate. The project remains viable against a 10% reduction in projected freight \ntraffic, a 10% reduction in projected passenger traffic, and a 10% increase in costs. \n \n29.  Financial  sustainability.  To  ascertain  the  project\u2019s  financial  sustainability,  ADB \nconducted  a  financial  evaluation  of  UTY  as  an  institution,  and  a  financial  analysis  of  the \nproject.13 The assessment indicates that UTY as an institution would have the financial capacity \nto implement the project, fund its contribution to the project costs, repay the ADB loan, and \nmake the required payments on its existing debt. Notwithstanding, there are some indications of \ndecreasing profitability of UTY, and its operating income ratio is envisaged to drop below 20%. \nADB will continue policy dialogue and support UTY in updating its business plan to ensure \noperational efficiency and financial sustainability. The financial analysis of the project was done \non an incremental basis to compare cash flow with and without the project. The financial internal \nrate of return is 2.16%, exceeding the calculated weighted average cost of capital of 1.18%. \nThe financial analysis highlighted the importance of maintaining freight transport revenue for \nUTY and the project to remain financially sustainable. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n30.  Financial management. A financial management assessment of UTY confirmed that it \nhas sufficient capacity to manage and maintain the accounting systems, financial controls, and \naudit arrangements required for the project. Low to medium risks exist in the accounting system \nand reporting integration. UTY has developed an approach to managing this risk, but a different \napproach may improve the quality and accuracy of the information available to management, \nand reduce the time needed to prepare and distribute accounting information reports. ADB will \nwork with the World Bank, which is now assisting UTY in accounting system improvements, to \nthis effect. \n \n31.  Procurement. A project procurement risk assessment confirmed that UTY as a whole \nhas  sufficient  experience  and  staff  skills  on  procurement.  Procurement  risk  is  assessed \nmoderate. However, the risk assessment identified some capacity issues of the PIU to manage \ninternational procurement. New staff has replaced procurement staff with experience from the \nprevious ADB-financed project. A systematic issue is related to inefficient internal approval \nprocesses of the government, including contract registration and price verification. The project \nwill improve the PIU\u2019s capacity on procurement and project management through training and \nsupport by international procurement and contract management consultants. UTY needs to \n                                                 \n10 The analysis was conducted based on ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n11 World Bank. 2015.

ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment  and  UTY.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n33.  Lack of access to safe and affordable transport significantly hinders the socioeconomic \ndevelopment of rural households as well as the industrial and agriculture sectors. A social and \npoverty assessment ascertained that the project will contribute to reducing transport cost and \ntravel time; provide safe means of transport; and increase access to jobs, markets, health care, \nand education facilities for the local population. The primary beneficiaries will be passengers, \nincluding women, children and students; freight transporters; and agro-industrial producers. \nThe project will support measures to mitigate any potential negative social impacts that may \narise, particularly on the operational safety of the electrified railway. The special safety needs of \nwomen and children will be considered in the safety action plan that the project will develop. \nFurther, UTY staff, including all women technical staff, will be trained on safe railway operations. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n34.  Environment (category B). UTY prepared an initial environmental examination (IEE) for \nthe entire project scope, which includes two environmental management plans: one to cover the \nelectrification of the railway line and traction substations, and another to cover the external \npower  supply  transmission  line.  The  IEE  also  includes  a  due  diligence  assessment  and \ncorrective action plans for the associated and existing facilities, described in paras. 39\u201340. \nOverall, the project supports the development of an environment-friendly mode of transport. \nWith  electrification,  local  air  pollution  and  greenhouse  gases  are  expected  to  be  reduced. \nPossible negative environmental impacts would include electromagnetic fields from catenary \nand transmission lines; railway and electric shock risks; change in the level of noise and \nvibration due to increased speed and frequency of trains; and waste generation related to \nequipment replacement and construction activities. There are no ecologically and culturally \nsensitive receptors present in the area of influence. Only parts of 20 properties located inside \nthe right-of-way could be affected by the electromagnetic field and noise, and this is adequately \naddressed in the IEE and land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP). \n \n35.  The environmental management plan provides mitigation and monitoring measures, as \nwell as a capacity-building plan. Contractors will be responsible for implementing the mitigation \nmeasures. UTY\u2019s PIU has full-time safeguard staff with access to monitoring equipment for air \nquality, noise, and vibration. They will be assisted in their tasks by the supervision consultants\u2019 \ncivil engineering and environmental specialists. The loan has funds allocated for institutional \nstrengthening,  including  safeguard  compliance  and  railway  safety  improvement.  UTY  will \nimplement the corrective action plans, with assistance from the project\u2019s supervision consultant \nif required. UTY conducted meaningful and full public consultation along the existing and new \nalignments, as well as around the external power supply facilities. ADB and UTY disclosed the \ndraft IEE report on 16 February 2017 in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguards Policy Statement \n(2009). \n \n36.  Resettlement (category B). The project will require the permanent acquisition of 10.85 \nhectares of land, which will partially affect 116 parcels of land. This comprises 95.5% arable \nand/or crop cultivation land and 4.5% orchard and/or garden land. In addition, 24 residential and \n ", "9 \nnonresidential structures, located within the right-of-way of the railway track, will be affected. \nThe construction of transmission lines will create temporary impacts, affecting an estimated 725 \npeople in 145 households. UTY, supported by technical assistance consultants, has prepared a \ndraft LARP that adequately addresses the impacts for mitigation. A due diligence report on the \nassociated and existing facilities, described in paras. 39\u201340, is provided as an appendix to the \ndraft LARP. \n \n37.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s requirements, UTY provided relevant information from the \nLARP to potential project-affected persons through public consultations in November 2016. \nOnce  the  detailed  design  becomes  available,  UTY  will  develop  the  draft  LARP  into  two \nimplementable LARPs\u2014one for the external power supply, and another for the electrification of \nthe railway line and two traction substations. When finalized, these LARPs will be reviewed by \nADB, posted on the ADB website, and implemented by UTY before civil works can begin. \n \n38.  UTY  has  a  dedicated  safeguard  specialist  who  will  supervise  the  preparation  and \nimplementation  of  the  LARPs,  assisted  by  the  supervision  consultants.  This  arrangement \naddresses  the  issue  of  institutional  capacity  to  manage  any  social  risks.  Following  UTY\u2019s \nsubmission of the draft LARP, notification for land acquisition per the country\u2019s Land Code, \nwhich requires 6 months\u2019 notice to be given by the district khokimiat (local authority), has been \nissued to the proposed affected households. \n \n39.  Associated and existing facilities. A small section of the electrification will be over \ntracks that are being constructed by the government and UTY to bypass the existing tracks that \ntraverse through the neighboring Kyrgyz Republic. The construction of this bypass is outside the \nproject scope and is being conducted by the government and UTY regardless of ADB financing \nfor the electrification project. The government and UTY confirmed that the bypass construction \nwas  initiated  without  anticipation  of  ADB  financing  the  project.  The  bypass  is  therefore \nconsidered an associated facility that is not funded as part of the project but essential for or \ndependent on the project. There is also an existing facility outside the project scope, comprising \nthe building and maintenance activities at the Andijan Depot. \n \n40.  For associated and existing facilities outside the project scope, ADB\u2019s Safeguards Policy \nStatement requires an assessment of impacts and risks to the project.14 ADB has conducted a \ndue  diligence  and/or  audit  and  developed  corrective  action  plans  for  environmental  and \ninvoluntary resettlement issues.15 \n \n41.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The country in general, and the project area in \nparticular, does not have indigenous peoples\u2019 communities as defined in ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement for operational purposes. No further action will be required. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n42.  Based  on  a  risk  assessment  covering  public  financial  management,  procurement, \ncorruption, and other areas, the project benefits and impacts are considered to far outweigh \n                                                 \n14 The Safeguard Policy Statement does not discuss the issue of associated facilities in respect of the social \nsafeguards. However, ADB. 2012. Involuntary Resettlement Safeguards: A Planning and Implementation Good \nPractice Sourcebook\u2014Draft Working Document. Manila. Provides guidance on the issue such that, if due diligence \nestablishes that ADB's reputation is at risk, ADB may not support the project. \n15 ADB. 2013. Safeguard Review Procedures.
