This will facilitate direct and \nefficient operation of both freight and passenger train services, and promote the socioeconomic \ndevelopment of the Fergana Valley.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nStrategic  location.  Surrounded  by  Afghanistan  to  the  south,  Kazakhstan  to  the  north \nand  northwest,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  to  the  northeast,  Turkmenistan  to  the  southwest,  and \nTajikistan  to  the  southeast,  Uzbekistan  serves  three  of  six  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic \nCooperation  (CAREC)  corridors.  With  31  million  people,  Uzbekistan  is  the  most  populous \ncountry  in  Central  Asia.  Being  a  double  landlocked  country  requiring  crossing  at  least  two \ncountries  to  reach  seaports,  transport  plays  an  important  role  in  sustaining  its  socioeconomic \ndevelopment.  \n \n4. \nThe  project  targets  the  Fergana  Valley,  which  covers  the  Andijan,  Fergana,  and \nNamangan  regions  of  Uzbekistan.  The  valley  is  home  to  nearly  one-third  of  the  country\u2019s \npopulation and has a population density of 468  people per square kilometer. The  valley holds \nvast  industrial  and  agricultural  potential  which  remains  to  be  fully  tapped.  Poor  transport \nconnectivity is one of the obstacles to the development of the Fergana Valley. \n \n5. \nCritical  role  of  railways. Rail transport has a unique competitive advantage over road \ntransport  for  moving  commodities  and  goods  in  bulk  over  long  distances.  The  4,669  km \nUzbekistan  rail  network  carries  about  60  million  tons  of  freight  and  15  million  passengers \nannually.  Since  2004,  Uzbekistan\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  has  grown  by  more  than  7%  per \nyear.  This  has  contributed  to  strong  demand  for  rail  transport.  Improvements  in  relationships \nbetween Uzbekistan and its immediate neighbors will further add to such demand. \n \nMajor achievements. Uzbekistan has continued to modernize its railway infrastructure. \n6. \nSince  its  founding  in  1994,  O\u2019zbekiston  Temir  Yo\u2019llari  (UTY),  the  vertically  integrated  public \nrailway  company,  has  gradually  implemented  a  holistic  railway  modernization  program, \nincluding  the  completion  of  a  unified  rail  network,  electrification  and  modernization  of  existing \nlines,  and  improvement  of  rolling  stock.  The  government  accorded  particular  importance  to \nelectrification, with 2,446 km or 52% of the network now electrified.3 Such efforts have also been \nsupported  by  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  Japan  International \nCooperation  Agency,  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  (KfW),  Kuwait  Fund  for  Arab  Economic \nDevelopment, Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Fund for International \nDevelopment, the People\u2019s Republic of China, and the World Bank.4 \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  Central  Asia  Regional \n\nEconomic Cooperation Corridor 2 (Pap\u2013Namangan\u2013Andijan) Railway Electrification Project (TA 8706-UZB). \n\n3  Government of Uzbekistan, Decree of the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan no. PP-993; 5 November 2008. \n4  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n7. \nUTY  has  worked  with  development  partners  to  undertake  institutional  reforms. \nWith support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the government initiated UTY reforms in \n1997,  under  which  ancillary  rail  services  were  largely  separated  from  core  operations. 5 \nThe  downsizing  of  staff  and  noncore  assets  improved  the  efficiency  and  sustainability  of \noperations.  Since  2015,  the  World  Bank  is  supporting  the  further  modernization  of  business \nprocesses, including accounting system reform. Even with these reforms, the nature of railways \nas a public good requires the continued support of the public sector. \n \n8. \nRemaining  challenges.  Despite  these  efforts,  the  railways  still  face  long  transport \ntimes,  inadequate  service  quality,  and  high  operating  costs,  because  of  aged  or  inadequate \ninfrastructure,  operational  inefficiencies,  competition  from  road  transport,  and  an  insufficient \nnumber  of  locomotives.  This  results  in  lost  economic  opportunities,  suboptimal  regional  trade, \nand  negative  environmental  impacts.  The  project  tackles  this  core  problem  by  accelerating \ninvestment in critical railway infrastructure, namely, the electrification of non-electrified tracks in \nthe densely populated Fergana Valley. \n \nEnvisaged  benefits.  The  project  will  increase  the  mobility  of  goods  and  people  in  the \n9. \nFergana  Valley,  improve  environmental  and  safety  performance  of  railways,  and  accelerate \nregional connectivity. As of 2016, rail operations on the Pap\u2013Namangan\u2013Andijan line are limited \nto two passenger trains and three freight trains per day. By extending an adjacent project being \nundertaken  by  UTY  to  electrify  the  Pap\u2013Kokand\u2013Margilan\u2013Andijan  line,  the  project  will  allow \nreliable,  more  frequent,  and  higher-speed  connections  between  the  major  cities  and  towns  in \nthe Fergana Valley. \n \nSwitching from diesel to electric traction will reduce the amount of noise, vibration, and \n10. \nair  pollution  from  each  train.  By  increasing  the  capacity  and  attractiveness  of  rail  travel,  the \nproject  will  help  shift  transport  away  from  roads  and  reduce  local  pollutants  and  greenhouse \ngases.  The  project  will  reduce  carbon  dioxide emissions  by  10,000  tons  per  year.  Operational \nsafety in the Fergana Valley will be improved through a dedicated project component on railway \nsafety. \n \n11. \nThe  project  supports  the  development  of  the  Fergana  Valley\u2013Tashkent  Economic \nCorridor.  The  completion  of  the  Pap\u2013Angren  line  in  mid-2016  allowed  for  the  first  time  a \ncontinuous,  electrified  railway  link  between  the  Fergana  Valley  and  Tashkent.  The  project  will \nextend the electrified network to major cities and towns in the Fergana Valley. Travel time from \nNamangan  to  Tashkent  will  be  cut  from  the  current  5  hours  by  road  to  about  3  hours  by  rail, \nin  Tashkent.  Also,  businesses \nenabling  better  access \nheadquartered  in  Tashkent  will  be  able  to  move  more  of  its  activities  to  the  Fergana  Valley. \nFor  freight  transport,  UTY  forecasts  up  to  a  fourfold  increase  in  the  amount  of  freight  to  be \ncarried annually between the Fergana Valley and Tashkent, subject to the electrification of lines \nin the Fergana Valley being completed. \n \n12. \nThe  project  railway  is  part  of  CAREC  Corridor  2,  linking  Uzbekistan  to  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China to the east and Europe to the west. The project railway forms a central link on \nCAREC designated rail corridors 202 and 203.6 \n\nto  employment  opportunities \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB. 1998.

ADB has provided two loans to Uzbekistan for the rehabilitation and \nmodernization  of  the  railway  infrastructure,  and  a  loan  for  the  electrification  of  a  railway  line \nbetween  Marakand  and  Karshi. 7  ADB\u2019s  Independent  Evaluation  Department  rated  the \nrehabilitation  and  modernization  projects  successful  and  the  government\u2019s  and  UTY\u2019s \nperformance  highly  satisfactory.8 The  electrification  project  is  substantially  complete,  ahead  of \nschedule,  and  on  budget.  Lessons  learned  from  the  implementation  of  these  projects  include \n(i) scoping the project to focus on components that add most value to UTY, i.e., electrification, \nas opposed to general track works; (ii) designing realistic capacity development components to \navoid an ad hoc approach to process reforms that cannot be completed within the project time \nframe; and (iii) optimally packaging procurement to maximize competition and avoid delays. \n \nB. \n \nThe project will be aligned with the following impacts: (i) stimulated economic growth in \n14. \nthe Fergana Valley, and (ii) increased regional trade along CAREC Corridor 2. The outcome will \nbe the improved level of passenger and freight service on the Pap\u2013Namangan\u2013Andijan railway \nline. \n \nC. \n \nOutput 1: Railway infrastructure along the Pap\u2013Namangan\u2013Andijan line upgraded. \n15. \nThe  project  will  electrify  145.1  km  of  the  single-track  main  railway  line  to  27.5  kilovolts \nalternating  current.  This  electrification  includes  the  locomotive  depot  in  Andijan,  a  spur  line  to \nUchkurgan, and a bypass being constructed by UTY and the government (para. 16). It will also \nconstruct  two  traction  substations  and  dispatcher  points,  procure  maintenance  equipment  and \nmachinery,  modernize  signaling  and  communications  facilities,  and  construct  external  power \nsupply facilities that will transmit electricity from the main grid to the traction substations. \n \nThe project will build upon another initiative by UTY and the government to realign 6.7 \n16. \nkm of the railway line to bypass a section of the line that currently traverses the territory of the \nKyrgyz Republic. The construction of this bypass is not part of the proposed ADB project. The \nconstruction of the bypass is expected to be substantially completed by the first quarter of 2018. \n \n17. \nOutput 2: Safety of railway operations improved. It is expected that train frequencies \nand  speeds  will  increase  as  a  result  of  the  project.  Furthermore,  the  power  lines  may  pose \nelectrocution  risks.  To  offset  any  potential  negative  impacts,  the  project  will  support  UTY  in  \n(i) assessing the existing and anticipated safety situation to the general public; (ii) supporting the \ndevelopment  of  practical  countermeasures;  and  (iii)  training  staff  to  plan  future  railway \ndevelopments  in  the  safest  manner.  The  needs  of  women  and  children  will  be  explicitly \nconsidered  in  the  development  of  safety  measures.  Training  of  UTY  staff  will  extend  to  all \nrelevant female staff. \n \n18. \nValue added by ADB. ADB will add value to the project primarily through the injection of \ninternational  best  practice  in  the  development  of  a  low-carbon,  safe,  and  sustainable  mode  of \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 1998.

Throughout the project preparation, ADB staff and consultants shared their expertise \nin  the  project\u2019s  technical  design  with  staff  from  UTY.  This  will  continue  throughout  project \nimplementation,  including  through  the  supervision  consultants.  Better  operational  safety  of \nrailways, brought about by output 2, will provide a blueprint for improvements in other parts of \nthe  UTY-operated  network.  In  implementing  the  project,  UTY  will  also  build  its  capacity  in  the \ncost-efficient procurement of goods and plant under international competitive bidding. This will \nalso support UTY\u2019s efforts to tap into international financing sources for investments in railways. \n \nD. \n \n19. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $177.45  million  (Table  1).  It  is  proposed  that  the  \n$80  million  ADB  loan  will  finance  (i)  supervision  consultants;  (ii)  procurement  of  plant,  i.e., \ndesign,  delivery,  installation,  and  commissioning  of  traction  substations  and  section  posts; \nmaterial for overhead catenary system; signaling and communications facilities; and supervisory \ncontrol  and  data  acquisition  system;  (iii)  procurement  of  maintenance  equipment  and \nmachinery;  and  (iv)  procurement  of  materials  for  external  power  supply.  The  government, \nthrough  UTY,  is  expected  to  finance  the  balance,  which  will  cover  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement,  civil  works,  taxes  and  duties,  and  financing  charges  during  implementation. \nDetailed cost estimates by expenditure category and financier are in the project administration \nmanual (PAM). 9 \n \n\nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nAmounta \n\nElectrification of Pap\u2013Namangan\u2013Andijan railway line \nImprovement of operational safety \nSubtotal (A) \n\nBase Costb \n1. \n2. \n \nTaxes and Dutiesc \nContingenciesd \nPhysical \n1. \nPrice \n2. \nSubtotal (C) \n \nFinancial Charges During Implementatione \n \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n \nB. \nC. \n \n \n \nD. \n \na  In late 2016 prices. \nb  Includes costs for land acquisition and resettlement (about $2.3 million), studies, monitoring, and reporting. \nc  Taxes and duties of $38.50 million will be exempted and counted as the government\u2019s contribution. \nd  Physical  contingencies  calculated  at  2%  for  civil  works,  land  acquisition,  and  resettlement;  and  3%  for \nelectrification  system  installation  and  consultancy  services.

UTY will include the relevant sections of ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) in all bidding and contractual documents. Civil \nworks and supply of materials and equipment from ADB nonmember countries will be financed \nby UTY from its own resources and procured under existing government procedures consistent \nwith the principles of economy and efficiency. \n \n24. \nUTY  and  ADB  have  taken  advance  actions  to  ensure  procurement  readiness.  UTY \nsolicited  expressions  of  interest  for  the  supervision  consultants  in  January  2017.  UTY  also \nsubmitted bidding documents for the procurement of maintenance equipment and machinery in \nJanuary 2017. Bidding documents for the procurement of plant, as well as for the procurement \nof materials for external power supply are substantially complete and will be launched prior to \nloan signing. \n \nAdditional  financing  may  be  considered  if  the  project  performs  well.  Such  additional \n25. \nfinancing  may  cover  the  procurement  of  electric  locomotives,  which  would  be  used  for  trains \nserving  the  project  railway  and  the  wider  electrified  network.  Additional  project  preparatory \ntechnical assistance will be used to achieve readiness for the additional financing in areas such \nas design, safeguard requirements, and capacity. \n \n26. \nthe PAM. \n \n \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n\n \n\n \n\n\fTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nEstimated loan closing date  31 December 2021 \nManagement \n\nArrangements \nMay 2017\u2013June 2021 \n30 June 2021 \n\n(i)  Oversight body \n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nMinistry of Finance \nUTY \nUTY\u2019s project implementation unit  \nICB (3 lots) \n\nICB \n\nICB \n\nConsulting services \n\nQCBS (80:20) \n\nTraction substations, section \nposts, material for overhead \ncatenary; signaling and \ncommunications; SCADA (plant) \nEquipment and materials for \nexternal power (goods) \nMachinery, tools, and equipment \nfor maintenance (goods) \nProject implementation and \nsupervision consultant (219 \nperson-months) \n\n[This \ninformation \nwas deemed \nconfidential \naccording to \nparagraph \n97(v) of ADB\u2019s \nPublic \nCommunicatio\nns Policy.] \n\nRetroactive financing \nand/or advance contracting \n\nDisbursement \n\nAdvance contracting will be carried out on all procurement packages \nand consulting services.

UTY  successfully  completed \nelectrification  of  the  114  km  Tashkent\u2013Angren  section  in  2010;  the  140  km  Marakand\u2013Karshi \nsection in 2015 (under ADB financing); and the 305 km Angren\u2013Pap\u2013Kokand\u2013Andijan section in \n2016  (under  World  Bank  cofinancing).  Given  that  the  installation  of  the  overhead  catenary \nsystem  will  be  implemented  under  normal  traffic  operations,  careful  coordination  with  existing \ntrain operations and provision of high-level safety measures for the on-site work will be needed. \nThis  will  also  require  strong  coordination  with  Uzbekenergo  and  local  government  bodies. \nConsidering the need for phasing and interfacing works under various components, a team of \ninternational  consultants  will  assist  UTY  in  supervising  construction.  UTY  also  has  sufficient \ncapacity  to  operate  and  maintain  electrified  railways.  Currently,  it  maintains  2,446  km  of \nelectrified  lines.  UTY  has  conducted  continuous  staff  training  on  the  maintenance  of  the \nelectrified  lines  and  modernized  signaling  and  communications  facilities,  as  well  as  the  safe \noperation of electric traction locomotives. The same measures will be applied upon completion \nof the project to ensure the efficient and safe operation and maintenance of the project railway. \n \n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nB. \n \n28. \nEconomic viability. ADB carried out an economic analysis of the project, comparing the \nincremental costs of the project with the incremental benefits.10 ADB assessed the current and \nforecast  traffic  with  and  without  the  project,  based  on  estimates  made  under  the  recently \ncompleted  World  Bank  cofinanced  Pap\u2013Angren  Railway  Project,11 updated  where  necessary \nwith  information  from  the  feasibility  study  conducted  by  UTY  and  its  design  institute  for  the \nproject. 12 The  main  economic  benefits  of  the  project  are  (i)  time  savings  for  freight  traffic, \n(ii) time savings for passenger journeys, (iii) reductions in carbon dioxide emissions, (iv) energy \ncost savings, and (v) locomotive maintenance cost savings. The project is economically viable, \nwith an economic internal rate of return of 19.7%, and a net present value of $92.12 million at a \n12.0%  discount  rate.  The  project  remains  viable  against  a  10%  reduction  in  projected  freight \ntraffic, a 10% reduction in projected passenger traffic, and a 10% increase in costs. \n \n29. \nFinancial  sustainability.  To  ascertain  the  project\u2019s  financial  sustainability,  ADB \nconducted  a  financial  evaluation  of  UTY  as  an  institution,  and  a  financial  analysis  of  the \nproject.13 The assessment indicates that UTY as an institution would have the financial capacity \nto  implement  the  project,  fund  its  contribution  to  the  project  costs,  repay  the  ADB  loan,  and \nmake the required payments on its existing debt. Notwithstanding, there are some indications of \ndecreasing profitability of UTY, and its operating income ratio is envisaged to drop below 20%. \nADB  will  continue  policy  dialogue  and  support  UTY  in  updating  its  business  plan  to  ensure \noperational efficiency and financial sustainability. The financial analysis of the project was done \non an incremental basis to compare cash flow with and without the project. The financial internal \nrate  of  return  is  2.16%,  exceeding  the  calculated  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  1.18%. \nThe  financial  analysis  highlighted  the  importance  of  maintaining  freight  transport  revenue  for \nUTY and the project to remain financially sustainable. \n \nC. \n \n30. \nFinancial  management.  A financial management assessment of UTY confirmed that it \nhas sufficient capacity to manage and maintain the accounting systems, financial controls, and \naudit arrangements required for the project. Low to medium risks exist in the accounting system \nand reporting integration. UTY has developed an approach to managing this risk, but a different \napproach  may  improve  the  quality  and  accuracy  of  the  information  available  to  management, \nand reduce the time needed to prepare and distribute accounting information reports. ADB will \nwork with the World Bank, which is now assisting UTY in accounting system improvements, to \nthis effect. \n \n31. \nProcurement.  A  project  procurement  risk  assessment  confirmed  that  UTY  as  a  whole \nhas  sufficient  experience  and  staff  skills  on  procurement.  Procurement  risk  is  assessed \nmoderate. However, the risk assessment identified some capacity issues of the PIU to manage \ninternational  procurement.  New  staff  has  replaced  procurement  staff  with  experience  from  the \nprevious  ADB-financed  project.  A  systematic  issue  is  related  to  inefficient  internal  approval \nprocesses of the government, including contract registration and price verification. The project \nwill  improve  the  PIU\u2019s  capacity  on  procurement  and  project  management  through  training  and \nsupport  by  international  procurement  and  contract  management  consultants.  UTY  needs  to \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                 \n10 The analysis was conducted based on ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.

ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \ngovernment  and  UTY.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM. \n \nD. \n \nLack of access to safe and affordable transport significantly hinders the socioeconomic \n33. \ndevelopment of rural households as well as the industrial and agriculture sectors. A social and \npoverty  assessment  ascertained  that  the  project  will  contribute  to  reducing  transport  cost  and \ntravel time; provide safe means of transport; and increase access to jobs, markets, health care, \nand  education  facilities  for  the  local  population.  The  primary  beneficiaries  will  be  passengers, \nincluding  women,  children  and  students;  freight  transporters;  and  agro-industrial  producers. \nThe  project  will  support  measures  to  mitigate  any  potential  negative  social  impacts  that  may \narise, particularly on the operational safety of the electrified railway. The special safety needs of \nwomen  and  children  will  be  considered  in  the  safety  action  plan  that  the  project  will  develop. \nFurther, UTY staff, including all women technical staff, will be trained on safe railway operations. \n \nE. \n \n34. \nEnvironment (category B). UTY prepared an initial environmental examination (IEE) for \nthe entire project scope, which includes two environmental management plans: one to cover the \nelectrification  of  the  railway  line  and  traction  substations,  and  another  to  cover  the  external \npower  supply  transmission  line.  The  IEE  also  includes  a  due  diligence  assessment  and \ncorrective  action  plans  for  the  associated  and  existing  facilities,  described  in  paras.  39\u201340. \nOverall,  the  project  supports  the  development  of  an  environment-friendly  mode  of  transport. \nWith  electrification,  local  air  pollution  and  greenhouse  gases  are  expected  to  be  reduced. \nPossible  negative  environmental  impacts  would  include  electromagnetic  fields  from  catenary \nand  transmission  lines;  railway  and  electric  shock  risks;  change  in  the  level  of  noise  and \nvibration  due  to  increased  speed  and  frequency  of  trains;  and  waste  generation  related  to \nequipment  replacement  and  construction  activities.  There  are  no  ecologically  and  culturally \nsensitive  receptors  present  in  the area  of  influence.  Only  parts  of  20  properties  located  inside \nthe right-of-way could be affected by the electromagnetic field and noise, and this is adequately \naddressed in the IEE and land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP). \n \n35. \nThe  environmental  management  plan  provides  mitigation and  monitoring  measures,  as \nwell as a capacity-building plan. Contractors will be responsible for implementing the mitigation \nmeasures. UTY\u2019s PIU has full-time safeguard staff with access to monitoring equipment for air \nquality, noise, and vibration. They will be assisted in their tasks by the supervision consultants\u2019 \ncivil  engineering  and  environmental  specialists.  The  loan  has  funds  allocated  for  institutional \nstrengthening,  including  safeguard  compliance  and  railway  safety  improvement.  UTY  will \nimplement the corrective action plans, with assistance from the project\u2019s supervision consultant \nif  required. UTY  conducted  meaningful  and  full  public  consultation  along  the  existing  and  new \nalignments, as well as around the external power supply facilities. ADB and UTY disclosed the \ndraft  IEE  report  on  16  February  2017  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguards  Policy  Statement \n(2009). \n \n36. \nResettlement (category B). The project will require the permanent acquisition of 10.85 \nhectares  of  land,  which  will  partially  affect  116  parcels  of  land.  This  comprises  95.5%  arable \nand/or crop cultivation land and 4.5% orchard and/or garden land. In addition, 24 residential and \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nnonresidential  structures,  located  within  the  right-of-way  of  the  railway  track,  will  be  affected. \nThe construction of transmission lines will create temporary impacts, affecting an estimated 725 \npeople in 145 households. UTY, supported by technical assistance consultants, has prepared a \ndraft LARP that adequately addresses the impacts for mitigation. A due diligence report on the \nassociated and existing facilities, described in paras. 39\u201340, is provided as an appendix to the \ndraft LARP. \n \n37. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  requirements,  UTY  provided  relevant  information  from  the \nLARP  to  potential  project-affected  persons  through  public  consultations  in  November  2016. \nOnce  the  detailed  design  becomes  available,  UTY  will  develop  the  draft  LARP  into  two \nimplementable LARPs\u2014one for the external power supply, and another for the electrification of \nthe railway line and two traction substations. When finalized, these LARPs will be reviewed by \nADB, posted on the ADB website, and implemented by UTY before civil works can begin. \n \n38. \nUTY  has  a  dedicated  safeguard  specialist  who  will  supervise  the  preparation  and \nimplementation  of  the  LARPs,  assisted  by  the  supervision  consultants.  This  arrangement \naddresses  the  issue  of  institutional  capacity  to  manage  any  social  risks.  Following  UTY\u2019s \nsubmission  of  the  draft  LARP,  notification  for  land  acquisition  per  the  country\u2019s  Land  Code, \nwhich requires 6 months\u2019 notice to be given by the district khokimiat (local authority), has been \nissued to the proposed affected households. \n \n39. \nAssociated  and  existing  facilities.  A  small  section  of  the  electrification  will  be  over \ntracks that are being constructed by the government and UTY to bypass the existing tracks that \ntraverse through the neighboring Kyrgyz Republic. The construction of this bypass is outside the \nproject scope and is being conducted by the government and UTY regardless of ADB financing \nfor the electrification project. The government and UTY confirmed that the bypass construction \nwas  initiated  without  anticipation  of  ADB  financing  the  project.  The  bypass  is  therefore \nconsidered  an  associated  facility  that  is  not  funded  as  part  of  the  project  but  essential  for  or \ndependent on the project. There is also an existing facility outside the project scope, comprising \nthe building and maintenance activities at the Andijan Depot. \n \n40. \nFor associated and existing facilities outside the project scope, ADB\u2019s Safeguards Policy \nStatement requires an assessment of impacts and risks to the project.14 ADB has conducted a \ndue  diligence  and/or  audit  and  developed  corrective  action  plans  for  environmental  and \ninvoluntary resettlement issues.15 \n \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).  The  country  in  general,  and  the  project  area  in \n41. \nparticular,  does  not  have  indigenous  peoples\u2019  communities  as  defined  in  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement for operational purposes. No further action will be required. \n \nF. \n \n42. \nBased  on  a  risk  assessment  covering  public  financial  management,  procurement, \ncorruption,  and  other  areas,  the  project  benefits  and  impacts  are  considered  to  far  outweigh \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\n                                                 \n14 The  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  does  not  discuss  the  issue  of  associated  facilities  in  respect  of  the  social \nsafeguards.  However,  ADB.  2012.  Involuntary  Resettlement  Safeguards:  A  Planning  and  Implementation  Good \nPractice Sourcebook\u2014Draft Working Document. Manila. Provides guidance on the issue such that, if due diligence \nestablishes that ADB's reputation is at risk, ADB may not support the project. \n\n15 ADB.  2013.  Safeguard  Review  Procedures.  Operations  Manual.  OM  F1/OP.  Manila  (para.  39  and  footnote  14). \ndiscusses  this  issue  as  a  risk  and  requires  collaboration  to  achieve  the  outcomes  consistent  with  ADB \nrequirements on a case-by-case basis. The implementation of the corrective action plan has been agreed between \nADB and UTY, and is included in the legal covenants. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nsuch  risks.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.16 \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nComplex coordination between UTY, \nUzbekenergo, design institutes, and local \nauthorities may delay procurement packaging \nand project implementation. \nDanger to the general public along the railway \nmay increase because of the electrification \nand increased train speed and frequency. \nMultiple layers of review and approving \nauthorities, lengthy procedures to register a \ncontract, and verification of contract prices \nmay delay procurement and implementation.\nCompetition from road transport reduces \nuptake of railway services. \n\nMitigation Measures \nUTY as the executing agency will systematically \ncoordinate with Uzbekenergo under a formalized \nagreement, and in further coordination with design \ninstitutes and local authorities. \nThe project will include an output for improving the \nsafety of railway operations in the Fergana Valley. \n\nLinked to the government\u2019s efforts to improve project \nimplementation, ADB will continue policy dialogue to \nsimplify the approval procedure and remove contract \nprice verification for ADB-financed contracts. \nADB will continue to engage in policy dialogue with the \ngovernment to ensure coordination among modes as \npart of government policy. ADB will help further improve \nthe competitiveness of UTY to retain both freight and \npassenger traffic. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, UTY = O\u2019zbekiston Temir Yo\u2019llari. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \nThe  government  and  UTY  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  shall \n43. \ncomply  with  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement, as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n44. \nThe  government  and  UTY  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the  project, \nwhich are set forth in the loan and project agreements.
