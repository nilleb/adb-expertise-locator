As  of  23  April  2020,  there  were  4,186  confirmed  COVID-19 \ncases in Bangladesh, 127 related deaths, and a cumulative total of 168,350 people quarantined.2 \nBangladesh is now moving to the fourth stage of infection (community transmission), with 59 of \nthe  country\u2019s  64  districts  affected.  The pandemic  has  led  to  significant  negative  impact  on  the \neconomy with the gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate projected to decline to 3.8% in fiscal \nyear (FY) 2020 from 8.2% in FY2019.3  \n \n3. \nThe economic downturn has seriously affected people\u2019s livelihoods, especially of the poor \nand vulnerable. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates that job losses could be as high \nas 3.7 million; many informal workers (85.1% of the workforce) lost their livelihoods instantly after \nthe nationwide lockdown.4 The lack of social safety net coverage will lead to dire consequences \nfor  the  more  than  20%  of  the  population  who  live  below  the  poverty  line  and  the  many  newly \njobless who will join them. \n \n4. \nThe Government of Bangladesh acted quickly to mitigate the health, social, and economic \nimpacts  of  the  pandemic. It  implemented  aggressive containment  measures  and  announced  a \ncountercyclical  economic  package  amounting  to  $11.2  billion  (3.3%  of  GDP,  which  includes \nurgent expenditure to expand the social safety net and stimulate the economy to protect jobs. The \ngovernment\u2019s program pursues a pro-poor, gender and socially inclusive approach by expanding \nand  strengthening  social  safety  nets  addressing  the  needs  faced  by  women  and  vulnerable \ngroups.  With  rising  expenditures  and  declining  revenues,  additional  government  financing \nrequirements  in  FY2020  are  estimated  at  $8.8  billion  (14.2%  of  the  FY2020  budget).  Facing \nconstraints on domestic borrowing, the government urgently needs external financing to support \nkey  pro-poor  initiatives  and  to  inject  fresh  liquidity  into  the  economy  to  increase  aggregate \ndemand.  \n \n5. \nThe proposed CARES program will provide financial support to the government to help \nmitigate  the  negative  impacts  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Bangladesh  meets  all  the  access \ncriteria of the CPRO (Table 1). The program implementation support will be provided under the \nattached TA.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n1   ADB. 2020.

Coordination \nwith the IMF  \n\nTable 1: Compliance with Access Criteria for CPRO  \n\nADB Staff Assessment \nGiven  the  density  of  the  country\u2019s  population,  sizable  slum  population,  and \nunderdeveloped  medical  system,  Bangladesh  faces  significant  challenges  in \ncontaining  the  disease.  Economic  growth  is  projected  to  decline  from  8.2%  in \nFY2019 to 3.8% in FY2020. Up to 13 million people may fall into poverty, as per \nADB  estimates.  With  around  34  million  people  living  below  the  poverty  line,  the \npandemic  threatens  the  livelihood  of  many  people.  The  fiscal  deficit  may  reach \n7.5% of GDP.  \nThe government has rolled out an $11.2 billion pro-poor countercyclical package \nwith  a  focus  on  social  protection  for  the  poor  and  support  for  key  industries  to \npreserve  jobs.  The  package  will  mostly  benefit  the  vulnerable  groups  of  the \npopulation and help industry workers stay employed and out of poverty.  \nMacroeconomic  management  was  largely  sound  with  high  growth  and  benign \ninflation before the pandemic. The economy grew 7.4% annually during FY2015\u2013\nFY2019.  The  public  debt\u2013GDP  ratio  was  low  at  34.9%  in  FY2019.a  Inflation \naveraged 5.8% during FY2015\u2013FY2019, and the budget deficit averaged 4.3% of \nGDP during the same period. The foreign exchange reserves were $32.7 billion at \nthe end of 2019.  \nThe National Preparedness and Response Plan was adopted on 18 March 2020 to \nguide the  nation\u2019s health sector response. The COVID-19  Emergency Operation \nCenter was set up at the Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research \nunder  the  Directorate  General  of  Health  Services  to  coordinate  nationwide \npreparedness and response activities. Entry control and screening was enforced, \nand  testing  efforts  were  strengthened.  The  government  also  imposed  social \ndistancing measures, including the closure of public and private establishments and \nsuspension  of  public  transportation  services.  The  countercyclical  economic \npackage is being implemented by various agencies to stabilize the financial market, \nprovide  a  cash  cushion  for  the  poor,  and  protect  employment  by  supporting  key \nindustries and SMEs. \nPublic debt in Bangladesh was $105 billion in FY2019, around 34.9% of GDP, and \nthe external public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt ratio was 14.5% of GDP, \nboth are low. The additional external debt of $2.9 billion, as government projected, \nwill increase both the external PPG debt\u2013GDP ratio and public debt\u2013GDP ratio by \n0.9% in FY2020. Bangladesh remains at a low risk of debt distress. \nADB  coordinates  closely  with  the  IMF  on  macroeconomic  monitoring  and \nparticipation in Article IV missions. The IMF supports ADB\u2019s response  measures \nand  has  provided  its  assessment  letter.  The  IMF  is  preparing  to  support \nBangladesh with its rapid credit facility to address balance of payments issues.  \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, CPRO = COVID-19 pandemic response option, \nFY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product, IMF = International Monetary Fund, SMEs = small and medium-sized \nenterprises. \na  IMF Assessment Letter and Press Release of IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV consultation with Bangladesh \n\n(Available from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nSource: ADB. \n \n \n\n \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nA. \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n1. \n\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic and Its Impact \n\n6. \nThe rapid spread of the pandemic in Bangladesh. Since the identification of the initial \ncases in Wuhan in Hubei province in the People\u2019s Republic of China, the outbreak of COVID-19 \nhas been spreading rapidly across the world with a significant public health and economic impact. \nIn Bangladesh, the first case was reported on 8 March 2020 and since then, though initially slow, \nthe increase in the number of cases has been significant. As of 23 April 2020, there were 4,186 \nconfirmed  COVID-19  cases  in  Bangladesh  and  127  related  deaths  with  a  cumulative  total  of \n168,350 people quarantined (footnote 2). The number of confirmed cases doubles every five days. \nA high population density,5 rapid urbanization, a large population of migrant workers, and a high \nshare of the country\u2019s urban population living in slums make Bangladesh vulnerable to infectious \ndisease outbreaks.  \n \n7. \nBangladesh faces significant health care challenges in combatting the pandemic. \nThe  health  system  in  Bangladesh  is  underdeveloped  and  underfunded,  with  only  9.9  doctors, \nnurses and midwives6 and 8.8 hospital beds per 10,000 people, while current health expenditure \nis only 2.4% of GDP. Bangladesh\u2019s COVID-19 testing capacity is at 219 tests processed per 1 \nmillion  people.7 As  of  21  April  2020,  over  200  doctors  and  150  healthcare  workers  including \nnurses  have  been  infected.8 There  are  shortages  of  essential  testing  equipment  and  standard \nlaboratories,  personal  protective  equipment  for  medical  staff,  sanitized  ambulances  to transfer \ninfected people, ventilators to support critical patients, and specialized wards and hospitals. Social \ndistancing measures are also made less effective because of crowded living conditions in urban \nareas.  \n \nThe pandemic has serious economic impacts. The pandemic has a significant impact \n8. \non the economic outlook. The IMF projects that economic growth will weaken to 3.8% in FY2020, \nbreaking a long streak of rapid growth9 (Figure 1). This would be the slowest growth rate since \n2002, lower than the 5% growth at the height of the global financial crisis in 2009. The nationwide \nlockdown has resulted in simultaneous supply and demand shocks, with production, consumption, \ntrade, and investment all at a standstill. By sector, industry is expected to decline by 2.0% (from \n12.7% in FY2019) and services by 3.5% (from 6.8% in FY2019) (Figure 2). The traditional growth \ndrivers  of  the  economy\u2014export-oriented  industries,  remittances,  domestic  consumptions,  and \nSMEs\u2014have all ground to a halt. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n5   Dhaka  has  the  highest  population  density  in  the  world,  estimated  at  44,500  people  per  square  kilometer.

Exports have \nbeen one of the main drivers of economic and social development in Bangladesh.  The growth \nrate  was  10.9%  in  2019  but  a  decline  of  19.8%  is  expected  in  FY2020.10 The  labor-intensive \nready-made  garment  (RMG)  industry  exported  goods  valued  at  $34.1  billion  in  FY2019, \naccounting for 84.0% of the total merchandise exports and 11.3% of GDP.11 The industry employs \nabout  4.1  million  people,  most  of  them  women.  However,  lockdowns  and  social  distancing \nmeasures  across  countries  have  disrupted  global  supply  chains  and  dampened  demand  from \noverseas  markets.  The  export  volume  in  March  2020  dropped  by  18.3%  compared  to  March \n2019. 12  With  Europe  and  the  United  States  (accounting  for  73%  of  the  country\u2019s  market, \ncombined)  in  recession,  about  $3.2  billion  of  export  orders  had  already  been  canceled  or \nsuspended as of 16 April 2020, affecting 2.3 million workers.13 \n \n10. \nRemittance inflows affected by the pandemic and oil shock. Remittances, amounting \nto $16.4 billion in FY2019 or 5.4% of GDP, have been a steady source of household incomes and \nhelp the country manage its balance of payments.14 After years of steady growth and registering \na 20.0% growth rate in the first 8 months of FY2020, remittances decreased by 11.3% in March \ncompared to last year. Most of Bangladesh\u2019s migrant workers are based in the Gulf countries that \nare  affected  both  by  the  pandemic  and  abrupt  decline  in  oil  prices. 15 Total  remittances  are \nexpected to stagnate in FY2020 and drop sharply in FY2021. The reduction in remittance inflow \nwill impact consumption and put the livelihood of many migrant workers\u2019 families at risk. \n \n11. \nContraction of domestic consumption. Domestic consumption accounts for 75% of the \neconomy.16 The nationwide lockdown and social distancing measures have resulted in significant \n\n \n\n10  Center for Global Workers\u2019 Rights. 2020.

The Google mobility report (Figure  3) provides \nindications  of  the  cliff-like  drop  of  domestic  consumption  which  will  severely  impact  retail, \naccommodation, restaurants, and transportation sectors of the economy. These are sectors with \na high concentration of SMEs that employ large numbers of low-wage workers.  \n \n\nFigure 3.

COVID-19 Community Mobility Report. Bangladesh. \n \n12.  Micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  experience  severe  challenges. \nBangladesh has around 8 million micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). MSMEs \ncontribute around 20%\u201325% of the GDP, and account for the majority of the total employment \noutside  of  agriculture  and  the  public  sector.17 Though  growing  steadily,  MSMEs  are  still  thinly \nresourced, with the majority being cottage and micro enterprises with fixed assets of Tk5 million \nor less. With limited collateral, they generally lack access to bank credits; the financing gap has \nbeen estimated at $2.8 billion (footnote 17). Since most MSMEs are concentrated in retail trading, \ntransport, and light manufacturing, they have been badly affected by the lockdown and supply \nchain disruptions. The sharp decline of the RMG industry also negatively affects other SMEs in \nthe same ecosystem. \n \n13. \nThe pandemic has a serious impact on poverty. The pandemic threatens to worsen \nthe poverty situation in Bangladesh. In 2019, over 34 million people or 20.5% of Bangladesh\u2019s \npopulation were poor and 17 million or 10.5% were extremely poor.18 The effects of the lockdowns \nand  consequent  economic  disruptions  have  led  to  a  spike  in  poverty.  The  International  Food \nPolicy Research Institute estimates that an additional 42 million people in South Asia could fall \ninto  extreme  poverty  in  2020  due  to  the  pandemic.    For  Bangladesh,  ADB  estimates  that  the \npandemic is expected to drive an additional 7.7% of the population or close to 13 million people \ninto  poverty.  The  lockdown  deprives  the  poor  and  the  vulnerable  people  of  their  livelihood \nsources. In addition, it is also difficult for them to receive timely and adequate government support \nas they are likely to be unbanked, have no tax records, and have no social insurance. \n \n14. \npandemic.  \n\nFour  groups  of  workers  are  particularly  vulnerable  to  the  economic  fallouts  of  the \n\n(i) \n\nThe informal sector workers. About 85.1% (around 59.2 million workers) of the \nlabor force is engaged in the informal sector, living hand-to-mouth on their daily \nincomes; 68.9% of them are women. With no sick leaves, no insurance and little \nsavings,  these  daily  laborers,  rickshaw  pullers,  restaurant  workers  and  micro \nbusinesses  face  daunting  challenges  to  maintain  their  livelihood  during  the \nlockdowns and economic disruptions.  \n\n17  World Bank. 2019.

More than  1  million  of  4 million  garment  workers  in  Bangladesh \nhave lost their jobs due to a fall in global demand (footnote 11). About 53.2% of \nthese are female and 80.4% of them went home without their severance pay. Low-\nskilled  female  workers  living  in  rural  areas  without  pay  remain  exposed  to \ndifficulties of making daily livelihood. \nReturnee  migrant  workers.  More  than  10  million  Bangladesh  nationals  work \noverseas, mostly in Europe, Gulf countries, and Southeast Asian countries. Almost \na million of these have returned due to the pandemic crisis in their host countries. \nThese workers would likely remain unemployed and cannot return overseas soon.  \nFarm workers. About 25 million (40.6%) people are employed in the agriculture \nsector.  They  have  low  monthly  income  compared  to  other  sectors  (footnote  4). \nLockdowns are going to disrupt transportation and with lack of storage facilities, \nthe farmers may have to bear significant losses, especially on perishable foods. \nThis  can  impede  farmers\u2019  access  to  markets,  curb  their  income,  and  worsen \npoverty. \n\n \nThe  pandemic  has  a  significant  impact  on  country\u2019s  fiscal  position.  Before  the \n15. \npandemic, the country\u2019s economy was on track to grow by 7.8% in FY2020.19 The budget deficit \nwas  expected  to  return  to  the  5%  range  after  a  temporary  jump  to  5.5%  in  FY2019,  due  to \nelections. The tax revenue collection was expected to increase due to sustained economic growth \nand a newly implemented VAT scheme. Nearly 90% of the government revenue comes from tax \ncollection,  of  which  65%  are  from  indirect taxes  including  VAT and  other duties.  However, the \npandemic and consequent stoppage of economic activities is expected to significantly reduce tax \nreceipts. Nontax revenue will also be severely affected by the reduction of imports and other fee \nsources. A minimum revenue loss of 2% of GDP ($6.7 billion) is projected by the government. \nExpenditure  is  expected  to  increase  sharply  due  to  increased  spending  in  health  care,  social \nprotection and economic stimulus packages. Per ADB\u2019s estimate, the fiscal deficit is likely to rise \nto 7.5% of GDP in FY2020. For FY2020 and FY2021, the IMF projected fiscal deficits of 6.9% \nand 6.5% of GDP respectively (footnote 9) while World Bank projected 7.7% and 9.8%.20 \n \n16. \nThe government\u2019s COVID-19 response. The government has mounted immediate and \nrobust responses in the areas of public health, social protection and economic stimulation. On 18 \nMarch 2020, the government adopted the National Preparedness and Response Plan to contain \nthe threat of the pandemic to public health. The Plan has seven components: (i) planning and \ncoordination; (ii) strengthening surveillance, laboratory, and screening at the points of entry; (iii) \ncontact tracing and quarantine; (iv) clinical case management; (v) infection prevention and control; \n(vi)  risk  communication  and  public  awareness;  and  (vii)  operational  research.21 To  protect  the \npoor and to support the economy, the government has adopted a countercyclical expenditure plan \nwith the following major strategic programs: (i) expanding social safety net programs to meet the \nbasic  needs  of  people  living  below  the  poverty  line,  day  laborers,  and  those  engaged  in  the \ninformal sector, with emphasis on vulnerable women and groups; (ii) introducing a fiscal stimulus \npackage to retain manufacturing workers; and (iii) increasing government spending with a target \nto  create  jobs  and  increase  aggregate  demand.  The  government  plan  comprises  economic \npackages totaling $11.2 billion (3.3% of GDP).    \n \n17. \nThe government\u2019s health response. Social distancing measures were introduced, and \nall large gatherings were canceled. A nationwide lockdown was enforced starting 26 March 2020 \n\n \n\n19 ADB. 2020.

National \n\nPreparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19, Bangladesh Version 5. Dhaka.  \n\n\funtil  5  May  2020  with  a  likely  further  extension.  Government  agencies,  led  by  the  Ministry  of \nHealth and Family Welfare, with the support of development partners including ADB, are stepping \nup  efforts to strengthen testing,  isolation, tracking,  and treatment  efforts.  Testing  capacity  was \nextended from one laboratory to 20, and a total of 36,090 tests have been conducted as of 24 \nApril 2020 (or 219 tests per 1 million people). \n \n18. \nEfforts to expand testing and provide treatment to COVID-19 patients are constrained by \nlimitations of the health care system. An amount of Tk2.5 billion has been initially provided to the \nHealth  Services  Division  of  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Family  Welfare  to  fund  the  COVID-19 \npreparedness and response plan. The government has made investments to strengthen its health \nsector response with support from development partners, including emergency loans from ADB22 \nand the World Bank23 totaling $200 million. \n \n\n2. \n\nThe Government Countercyclical Expenditure Plan \n\n19. \nExpanding social safety net programs for the poor and vulnerable. According to the \nexpenditure plan, support will be provided to fulfil the basic needs of people living below or near \nthe poverty line and people engaged in informal work. People risking their own safety fighting the \npandemic,  such  as  doctors,  nurses,  and  health  care  workers,  will  also  be  aided.  Women  are \nspecially targeted among most of the groups being supported. Some of the programs are (details \nare listed in Table 2): \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nSpecial honorarium to government doctors, nurses, and medical workers (majority \nare  females)  engaged  in  treating  COVID-19  patients.  As  of  21  April,  over  350 \ndoctors, nurses and health workers have been infected by COVID-19.  \nSpecial health insurance of Tk0.5 to Tk1 million and life insurance 5 times of health \ninsurance  coverage  to  physicians,  nurses,  other  health  workers,  field-level \nadministration officers, members of law enforcement agencies, and others directly \ninvolved in the fight against the pandemic.  \nThe social protection such as the old age allowance and the allowance scheme for \nwidowed and husband-deserted distressed women expanded to cover all eligible \npeople  in  100  most  poverty-stricken  upazilas  (subdistrict).  About  1  million  new \nbeneficiaries will be enrolled. \nCash transfer to low-income people engaged in the informal sector, including day \nlaborers, hawkers, rickshaw and van pullers, transport workers, and hotel workers \nwho have lost their income because of the lockdown. Through this program, two \nmillion low-income earners (mostly women) will receive cash during the period of \nlockdown and Ramadan. \nFood distribution free of charge to low-income people (rice 500,000 tons, wheat \n100,000 tons) to ensure food safety for the poorest people.  \n\n \n\nProtect  jobs  in  export  industries,  industrial  and  services  sectors  and  SMEs.  Job \n20. \nlosses are mounting, and businesses are struggling. The government has made funds available \nthrough  subsidized  zero-cost  credit  to  support  factory  worker  salary  payments.  The  primary \nbeneficiaries are the RMG sector workers on the verge of being furloughed or dismissed. Low-\ncost loans will be provided to the factories to preserve employment, support SMEs, and maintain \nthe competitive edge of Bangladesh\u2019s export industries. Some of the programs are (details are \nlisted in Table 2): \n\n22  ADB. 2020. People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh: COVID-19 Response Emergency Assistance Project. Manila. \n23  World  Bank.  2020.

The fund will be available to export-oriented industries which export a \nminimum  of  80%  of  its  total  production  (almost  all  RMG  factories).  It  will  be  used  for \npayment of salaries and allowances of workers and employees for April, May and June \nbased on historical average of salaries and allowances. The primary beneficiaries of the \nprogram are RMG factory workers (most are low-skilled women workers). It is estimated \nthat 1.5 million workers could benefit from this program.  \n\n(ii)  Subsidized  loans  through  commercial  banks  to  affected  SMEs.  The  government  will \nprovide an annual interest rate subsidy of 5%, effectively reducing rates from 9% to 4%. \nSMEs in the retail, service and transportation sectors were all seriously impacted. Lacking \nresources and with poor access to finance, these SMEs will receive some relief from this \nprogram  to stay in business and keep their workers. \n\nTable 2: Countercyclical Expenditure Package  \n\n(as of 26 April 2020) \n\nAmount \n(Tk billion) \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n\nKey \nBeneficiaries  \n\nItem \n\nSocial Protection \nSpecial honorarium to government doctors, nurses, and \nmedical workers engaged in treating COVID-19 patients  \nSpecial health and life insurance will be provided to \nphysicians, nurses, other health workers, field-level \nadministration officers, members of law enforcement \nagencies, Armed Forces, and others directly involved in \nthe fight against the pandemic at the risk of their personal \nsafety  \nExpanding the social protection such as the old age \nallowance and the allowance scheme for widowed and \nhusband-deserted distressed women to cover all eligible \npeople of the 100 most poverty-stricken upazilas \n(subdistrict) \n\nCash transfers directly to low-income people in the \ninformal sector \nFood distribution free of charge to low-income people \n(rice 500,000 tons, wheat 100,000 tons) to ensure food \nsafety  \nOpen market sale of rice at Tk10 per kilogram to low-\nincome people (74,000 tons for 3 months)  \n\nExpedited house construction for homeless people \n \nSupport industries to protect jobs \nInterest-free loans through commercial banks to export-\noriented businesses to pay workers\u2019 salaries.  \nSubsidized loans by commercial banks to affected SMEs \nwith annual interest rate of 9% (5% government subsidy).  \nSubsidized loans by commercial banks to affected \nbusinesses in industry and service sectors with an annual \ninterest rate of 9.0% (4.5% government subsidy) \n\n1.0 \n\n7.5 \n\n12 \n\n88 \n\n8.2 \n\n96 \n\n7.6 \n\n25.0 \n\n89 \n\n293 \n\n2.5 \n\n29 \n\n50.0 \n\n586 \n\n200.0 \n\n2,345 \n\n300.0 \n\n3,518 \n\nHealth workers \n(majority female) \nHealth workers \nand engaged \nofficials \n \n\nElderly people, \nwidowed and \nhusband-\ndeserted \ndistressed \nwomen  \nLow-income \ngroups  \nLow-income \ngroups \n\nLow-income \ngroups \n\nFactory workers \n(mostly women) \nSMEs and their \nemployees  \nIndustry and \nservice sector \nfirms and their \nemployees  \nExport industries  \n\n21.3 \n\n250 \n\nHomeless people \n\nExpansion of EDF from $3.5 billion to $5.0 billion with \nreduced interest rate to 2.00% from 2.73% to facilitate the \nimport of raw materials under the letter of credit \n\n127.5 \n\n1,495 \n\n8 \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n \n\n\fItem \n\nA new pre-shipment refinancing scheme for exporters \nwith 7% interest rate  \nEstablishment of a new refinance scheme to supply \nworking capital in the agriculture sector, at 4% \nProcurement of additional 200,000 tons of rice and wheat \nto ensure fair price \nSupport for mechanization of harvesting \nDistribution of seed and sampling to affected farmers, and \nfertilizer subsidy \n\nAmount \n(Tk billion) \n50.0 \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n586 \n\nKey \nBeneficiaries  \nExport industries \n\n50.0 \n\n8.6 \n\n2.0 \n95.0 \n\n586 \n\nFarmers \n\n101 \n\nFarmers \n\n23 \n1,114 \n\nFarmers \nFarmers \n\nTotal \n\n956.2 \n\n11,211 \n\n \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, EDF = Expansion of Export Development Fund, \nSMEs = small and medium-sized enterprises. \nSource: Finance Division, Ministry of Finance. \n \n21. \nCoordinated  monetary  policy  responses  to  ease  financial  market  stress.  The \nBangladesh Bank, the central bank,  took steps to keep credit from freezing. Before the crisis, the \ntotal capital adequacy ratio for the banking industry was 10.5%, but the capital buffer is likely to \nhave  been  eroded  during  the  lockdown  period  (footnote  20).  Regulatory  forbearance  was \nexercised to support  the  banking  industry  which is  likely  to experience growing  nonperforming \nloan  (NPL)  issues  after  the  pandemic.  Bangladesh  Bank  issued  circulars  to  delay  NPL \nclassification and extend the tenures of trade instruments, the submission of import bill entries to \nthe bank, the issuance period of back-to-back letters of credit, and the repayment tenure of loans \nfrom  the  Export  Development  Fund.  To  boost  liquidity  in  the  system,  the  Bangladesh  Bank \nannounced that it will buy treasury bonds and bills from banks. Effective from 15 April 2020, the \ncentral bank fixed the cash reserve ratio at 3.5% on a daily-basis requirement and 4.0% on a bi-\nweekly average basis. \n \n\n3. \n\nMacroeconomic Management and Debt Sustainability \n\n22. \nSound macroeconomic management before the pandemic. The economy had been \ngrowing at 7.4% and inflation kept at 5.8% during FY2015\u2013FY2019. The public debt to GDP ratio \nis at 34.9% and external public debt to GDP ratio is at 14.5% in FY2019,24 both are low. Despite \na low revenue\u2013GDP ratio (9.9% in FY2019), the average fiscal deficit was 4.3% of GDP during \nFY2015\u2013FY2019, still within the budget target of 5.0%. However, the fiscal deficit rose to 5.5% of \nGDP in FY2019 because of increased spending during national elections and was expected to \ndecline to 5.0% before the onset of the pandemic. Concentrated public investment in physical and \nsocial infrastructure (59% of the FY2020 budget) was a key contributing factor to the rapid GDP \ngrowth. The foreign exchange reserves, which were $32.7 billion at the end of 2019, cover 5.9 \nmonths of imports (footnote 19). \n \n23. \nIMF  Article  IV  consultation  concluded  in  September  2019  confirmed  that  \u201cBangladesh \ncontinues  to  achieve  impressive  economic  growth  and  social  development.\u201d  The  Joint  World \nBank\u2013IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis in September 2019 confirmed that Bangladesh remained \nat a low risk of debt distress, with all external and domestic debt indicators below their respective \nthresholds under the baseline and stress test scenarios.25 \n \n\n24  IMF  Assessment  Letter  and  Press  Release  of  IMF  Executive  Board  Concludes  Article  IV  consultation  with \n\nBangladesh (Available from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n25  World Bank\u2013IMF. 2019. Joint World Bank\u2013IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis. Washington, DC. \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nPublic debt remains sustainable. Public debt in Bangladesh was $105 billion in FY2019 \n24. \n(around 34.9% of GDP) and external PPG debt was $44 billion (around 14.5% of GDP) (footnote \n24). Without COVID-19, in FY2020, the public debt is projected to increase to 35.5% of GDP and \nthe  external  PPG  debt  to  14.6%  of  GDP.  The  debt  sustainability  analysis  confirmed  the  debt \nsustainability of Bangladesh even under the impacts of the pandemic and after factoring in the \nadditional borrowings. With the additional $2.9 billion of external borrowings and $5.9 billion of \ndomestic financing, the external PPG debt\u2013GDP ratio will increase to 16.0%, and the public debt\u2013\nGDP ratio will increase to 39.6% in FY2020. Both the external debt ratio and public debt ratio will \nremain stable over the medium term, with all external debt and public debt indicators well below \nthe threshold levels for debt burden indicators, even under various stress scenarios.26 \n \n25. \nFinancial sector. One of the pre-existing vulnerabilities in Bangladesh\u2019s economy is the \nweakness in the financial sector. At the onset of the pandemic, the NPL ratio stood at 9.3% as of \nthe end of 2019. Most of the NPLs are in the state-owned commercial banks, with an NPL ratio \nof 23.9% at the end of 2019. Even before the crisis, private sector businesses, especially SMEs, \nhad  serious  challenges  accessing  bank  credit.  Because  of  the  lack  of  funds  available  for \nborrowing, bank credit to the private sector grew only 9.9% in 2019, which is the slowest growth \nrate  since  2008.  Most  banks  have  undiversified  portfolios  with  concentrated  exposures  to \ncorporate loans. The pandemic threatens to further increase the stress in the banking system. \n \nCapital  markets.  Both  the  stock  and  bond  markets  are  underdeveloped,  presenting  a \n26. \nchallenging domestic funding environment for both the private sector and the government. Total \nstock  market  capitalization  was  only  16.4%  of  GDP  in  2018. 27  The  development  of  the \ngovernment  securities  market  is  hampered  by  the  rapid  increase  of  national  saving  certificate \n(NSC)  sales,  which  has  now  been  capped.  NSCs  are  a  government-issued  saving  instrument \ncarrying risk-free returns of up to more than 11%,28 which makes them very popular for investors \nbut very costly in terms of the public finance. Overall, the government securities are thinly traded, \nand the main investors are commercial banks, which were facing liquidity issues even before the \npandemic. In conclusion, the domestic funding sources are limited and costly. \n \n27. \nRegional  cooperation.  The  government  has  pledged  $1.5  million  to  the  South  Asian \nAssociation  for  Regional  Cooperation  (SAARC)  Corona  Emergency  Fund.  The  fund  has  been \nused to deliver medical supplies and machines to SAARC member countries. Potential areas for \nregional  collaboration  include  closer  collaboration  between  the  national  health  emergency \nagencies  and  creation  of  a  central  repository  to  disseminate  information.  Information  sharing, \nsupply deliveries and policy dialogues have already started under the support of the fund. \n  \nB. \n\nPolicy Reforms and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\n28. \nThe  program  will  support  the  Government  to  mitigate  the  severe  social  and  economic \nimpact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Specifically,  the  program  will  support  government  to \nimplement its pro-poor, gender and socially inclusive COVID-19 response plan which expands \nand  strengthens  social  safety  nets  to  address  the  needs  of  poor  and  vulnerable  groups.  The \nGovernment  program  will  also  protect  employment  in  the  key  industries,  such  as  the  labor-\nintensive RMG sector where the majority of the workers are vulnerable low-skilled female workers. \nThe proposed program is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, including operational priorities on \n\n \n\n26 Debt Sustainability Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 The Dhaka Stock Exchange hit a 7-year low in March before trading was suspended from 26 March 2020. Economic \n\nconcerns dragged down the share value of textile companies and banks. \n\n28  In comparison, the yield of 5-year treasury bonds is only 8.05% in March 2020, based on CEIC data.  \n\n\faddressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities, accelerating progress in gender equality, \nand strengthening governance and institutional capacity.29 \n \n29. \nADB\u2019s  value  addition.  ADB\u2019s  continuous  policy  dialogues  with  the  government \ncontributed to the development of the government\u2019s response strategy and development financing \nplan. ADB has supported and worked closely with the government in preparing the national health \nresponse plan and in formulating the economic stimulus packages. Discussions have been held \nat various levels including with technical staff and the highest level of government, including the \nPrime Minister\u2019s office, the finance secretary, and the health secretary. In close coordination with \nother  development  partners,  ADB  brought  to  the  table  its  regional  experience  in  disaster \npreparedness,  health management,  and  implementation  of  pro-poor,  gender-responsive  policy \nactions.  \n \n30. \nADB\u2019s  financial  assistance  encompasses  several  important  areas.  First,  through  a \nregional  TA  (Regional  Support  to  Address  the  Outbreak  of  Coronavirus  Disease  2019  and \nPotential Outbreaks  of Other  Communicable  Diseases),  ADB  provided a $350,000  emergency \ngrant in March 2020 to support the procurement of health safety materials to effectively support \nand protect those on the front line and medical staff.30 Second,  ADB has approved the COVID-\n19  Emergency  Assistance  Response  Project  of  $100  million  on  30  April  2020  to  aid  the \nprocurement  of  equipment  and supplies;  the upgrading  of health and  testing  facilities;  and the \nbuilding  of  system  and  community  capacities  for surveillance,  prevention,  and  response  to  the \npandemic. Third, through the proposed CARES program, ADB will fund government expenditures \nin critical areas such as the expansion of social safety nets for vulnerable women and other groups \nand  support  critical  labor-intensive  industries,  and  SMEs,  in  order  to  preserve  jobs.  During \nprogram implementation, ADB will support the effective targeting of the poor especially vulnerable \nwomen to maximize the pro-poor and gender impact of its COVID-19 response. \n \n31. \nADB, through its private sector window, is also working to provide the private sector with \nliquidity  support  and  trade  finance.  The  pipeline  includes  transactions  in  the  infrastructure, \nfinancial  institutions,  agribusiness  and  social  sectors,  for  existing  clients  and  new.  All  these \ncoordinated efforts aim to provide short-term social protection as well as have a medium- to long-\nterm impact through sustaining aggregate demand and protecting the industrial base, which are \nconsidered vital to Bangladesh\u2019s economic recovery and continued growth momentum. \n \n32. \nADB has been a partner with the government in many areas of structural reforms, including \ncapital market development and support for good governance.31 Prior to the pandemic, ADB had \nbeen  in  close  engagement  with  the  government  in  the  areas  of  banking  industry  reform, \nstrengthening income tax collection, and disaster risk finance. As part of ADB\u2019s plan for medium-\nterm interventions, these efforts will continue and may take on increased urgency as the pandemic \nhas revealed the strong need for continued structural reforms in these areas. To speed up the \nrecovery and stimulate aggregate demand, government spending needs to be increased.

The program \nwill  provide  the  government  with  budget  support  to  mitigate  the  severe  social  and  economic \nimpact of COVID-19. The government programs will expand and strengthen social safety nets for \nthe most vulnerable groups of the population during the pandemic. Cash and in-kind payments \nwill  be  delivered  to  these  populations through  existing  agencies for  expedited  implementation. \nAside  from  funding  support,  ADB  will  provide  capacity  development  and  support  through  the \nattached TA. The government programs will assist the worst-hit industries such as the RMG and \nservice industries. Many low-wage earners who work in these labor-intensive industries are ill-\nequipped to withstand any work suspensions, let alone job losses. These programs will keep the \nworkers  employed  and  preserve  critical  industry  sectors  and  their  corresponding  business \ninfrastructure,  which  will  be  important  for  the  economy  to  return  to  its  pre-pandemic  growth \ntrajectory. \n \n34. \nThe program will be aligned with the following overarching development objectives of the \ncountry:  inequality  and  unemployment  reduced  and  adverse  social  and  economic  impact  of \nCOVID-19 pandemic mitigated. The reforms undertaken under the program will have the following \neffect:  adverse  socioeconomic  impact  to  vulnerable  groups  reduced.  The  program  loans  will \nsupport  the  following  reform  areas:  social  safety  net  to  vulnerable  groups  expanded,  and \nemployment  opportunities  protected.  Under  the  attached  TA,  program  implementation  will  be \nsupported, and further reform areas will be identified. \n \n35. \nCoordination with the International Monetary Fund and other development partners. \nADB  maintains  close  coordination  with  the  IMF,  and  the  IMF  has  also  provided  ADB  with  an \nassessment letter which confirmed the debt sustainability of Bangladesh with increased external \nfinancing.  The  country  preparedness  and  response  plan  (CPRP)  was developed  jointly  by the \ngovernment  and  development  partners  including  ADB  to  coordinate  support  efforts  by  the \ninternational  communities.  The government  allocates  specific  elements  of  its  response  plan  to \neach development partner, in line with the country\u2019s needs and volume of assistance provided. \nThe IMF is requested by the government to provide SDR500 million for a rapid credit facility to \naddress balance of payments issues. Through close coordination, complementarity between two \nprojects  in  the  health  sector,  one  for  World  Bank  and  one  for  ADB,  was  ensured.  The  World \nBank\u2019s $100 million loan project will support information- and technology-based approaches to \ndisease surveillance and provide training and equipment for facilities and geographic areas as \nidentified  by  the  government.  ADB\u2019s  $100  million  emergency  assistance  health  package  will \nsupport the procurement of equipment and supplies, the upgrading of health and testing facilities, \nand  the  building  of  systems  and  community  capacities.  For  countercyclical  economic  support, \nADB  will  provide  $500  million  through  this  proposed  program  while  the  Asian  Infrastructure \nInvestment Bank (AIIB) will provide a $250 million loan with ADB as the cofinancing partner.  \n \nTo support the Rohingya people, the government has a separate program to avoid the \n36. \nbreakout of COVID-19 in the camps and mitigate any impact thereof. This includes establishing \nisolation units  and providing  health facilities.  Currently,  the  World Bank has  two  ongoing  grant \nprojects ($185 million)  for  the  health sector  which are  being  used to manage and mitigate the \n\n32  ADB.  2015.

ADB is exploring additional grant funds to complement the \nWorld Bank support. \n \nD.  \n \n37. \nThe  government  has  requested  loans  of  $250  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources  and  $250  million  from  ADB\u2019s  concessional  ordinary  capital  resources  through  the \nCPRO under the CSF. The government has also requested a loan of $250 million from the AIIB \nunder  its  COVID-19  response  package.  The  pandemic  is  expected  to  result  in  a  decline  in \nrevenues, estimated at 2% of GDP, as well as an increase in countercyclical expenditures. The \nprogram  will  finance  the  anticipated  fiscal  deficits.  The  government\u2019s  initial  estimates  indicate \nadditional financing needs of $8.8 billion (14.2% of the annual budget of $61.6 billion). About $2.9 \nbillion of the deficits will be financed through external sources and $5.9 billion from the domestic \nmarket. The capital market in the country is underdeveloped. Historically, the principal domestic \nfinanciers of the government have been the commercial banks. The external borrowing amount \nhas been fixed after considering sufficient liquidity in the domestic market and to avoid crowding \nout the private sector during the last quarter of the fiscal year (Table 3).  \n \n\nTable 3: Government Additional Financing Requirement because of COVID-19 \n($ million) \n\n \nItem \nTotal financing requirement \nGross domestic financing \nGross foreign financing \nSource of fundsb \nAsian Development Bankc \nAsian Infrastructure Investment Bankd \nWorld Bank \nInternational Monetary Funde \nOther sourcesf \n\nTotal commitments  \n\n2020 \nPre-COVID-19 \n17,025 \n10,914 \n6,111 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n2020 \nCOVID-19 \nAdjusteda \n25,835 \n16,835 \n9,000 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nAdditional \nFinancing Needs \n8,810 \n5,921 \n2,889 \n \n\n600 \n250 \n100 \n700 \n1,239 \n2,889 \n\na  Preliminary estimates.  \nb  Includes approved and proposed. \nc  Includes this proposed program and $100 million COVID-19 Response Emergency Assistance Project. \nd  Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank financing will be cofinanced with the Asian Development Bank. \ne  International Monetary Fund facility provides balance of payments support of SDR500 million. \nf  The government has reached out to other multilateral or bi-lateral partners for additional funds. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n38. \nADB has confirmed that this requested CSF meets the access criteria for the CPRO as \ndetailed in Appendix 4. ADB financing comprises (i) a loan of $250 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital  resources,  in  regular  terms,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility plus 50 basis points, for a term of \n15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and (ii) a loan of $250 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources, in concessional terms, with an interest charge at the rate of 2% per year during \nthe grace period and thereafter, for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years.33 AIIB \nis expected to provide $250 million support in parallel co-financing.  The total loan size is based \non  Bangladesh\u2019s  financing  needs  and  development  spending  arising  from  the  development \nexpenditure programs. \n\n33 The  $250  million  concessional  ordinary  capital  lending  will  be  from  the  existing  country  allocation  following \n\nreprogramming, and savings freed up from ongoing projects. \n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nE.  \n \n39. \nThe Finance Division of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the executing agency. The \ngovernment,  through  the  MOF,  will  monitor  budget  execution  and  flow  of  funds  for  the \ncountercyclical measures. The government through the MOF will submit to ADB monthly reports \nin the first three months and quarterly reports thereafter on activities, expenditures from the state \nbudget to support the countercyclical measures, and on the beneficiaries. The program will be \nunder  the  oversight  of  the  Cabinet  Committee  on  Social  Security  Program,34 and  ADB\u2019s  TA \nresources  will  be  provided  to  the  Committee  to  enhance  monitoring  and  to  support  policy \ndevelopment,  medium-term  planning,  and  regional  cooperation.  The  program  implementation \nperiod is from May 2020 to December 2021. The loan proceeds will be disbursed following ADB's \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and ADB\u2019s arrangements \nwith the Finance Division of the MOF. \n \n\nIII. \n\nATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nA  TA  will  be  attached  to  the  program  to  help  the  government  improve  its  institutional \n40. \ncapacity  and  program  implementation.  The  MOF  will  be  the  executing  agency,  and  the \nDepartment of Social Services under the Ministry of Social Welfare, the Department of Women \nAffairs  under  the  Ministry  of  Women  and  Children  Affairs,  and  the  Department  of  Disaster \nManagement  under  the  Ministry  of  Disaster  Management  and  Relief  will  be  the  implementing \nagencies. The TA will (i) support the program implementation by providing capacity support and \ndevelopment;  (ii)  provide  direct  support  for  the  delivery  of  services  through  the  existing  social \nsafety  net; (iii)  introduce  new  tools  and  solutions  to improve  poverty  and  gender targeting  and \nservice delivery, including digital financial services and banking channels; (iv) develop a gender-\nresponsive plan to improve the social safety net in the country; and (v) improve the monitoring \nand evaluation capacity and data collection. \n \nThe TA is estimated to cost $1 million, which will be financed on a grant basis from the \n41. \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6). The government will provide counterpart support \nin  the  form  of  counterpart  staff;  office,  administrative,  and  logistics  support;  and  other  in-kind \ncontributions.  TA  funds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). All consultants shall be recruited \nin  accordance  with  the  ADB  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and \nassociated project administration instructions and/or technical assistance staff instructions. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n42. \nGovernance.  The  institutional  framework  of  public  financial  management  (PFM)  in \nBangladesh  is  under  transition  and  several  improvements  have  been  made  or  are  being \nattempted.  To  date, three  public  expenditure  and financial  accountability  (PEFA)  assessments \nhave been undertaken on Bangladesh\u2014in 2006, 2010, and 2016. The 2016 PEFA assessment \nnotes that, overall, there has been a renewed focus on PFM activities and a continued emphasis \non improving PFM processes and procedures. In addition, Bangladesh has made positive strides \nin developing its PFM systems since the 2010 PEFA assessment. However, improvements are \nneeded in areas such as internal and external audit and annual financial reports.  \n \n43. \nThe dominant role of the  MOF  in budget management  has  contributed to the  country\u2019s \nstrong record of fiscal discipline. Bangladesh performed well with respect to comprehensiveness \n\n34 A cabinet committee headed by the Finance Minister to provide oversight on country\u2019s social protection programs.  \n\n \n\n\fADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n\nof budget documentation and public access to key fiscal information. The integrity of financial data \nis sound since access and changes to integrated budgeting and accounting system records are \nrestricted and recorded. Strengthening Bangladesh\u2019s PFM through TA and policy-based loans is \npart of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy. Currently, ADB is providing capacity building support \nto the Office of Comptroller and Auditor General of Bangladesh through TA35 for the development \nof an audit manual for foreign-aided projects and for the provision of training to audit staff. \n \n44. \nTo ensure a robust mechanism for timely and transparent identification of beneficiaries of \nthe  government\u2019s  countercyclical  expenditure  program  as  well  as  an  effective  performance \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  system,  programs  funds  will  go  through  the  existing  budgetary \nchannels  under  overall  monitoring  by  the  MOF.  Most  of  these  channels  (Bangladesh  Bank, \nDepartment  of  Social  Services,  Ministry  of  Social  Welfare)  have  been  supported  by  various \ndevelopment  partners  including  ADB,  which  makes  it  conducive  for  effective  monitoring  and \nevaluation.  A  government  accounting  software  package  (IBAS++)  will  be  used  to  record  the \ntransactions and the attached TA will support project implementation and aid in devising a plan \nfor developing a long-term social safety net. \n \n45. \nwith the government and the MOF. \n \nPoverty and social. The substantial progress made by Bangladesh in poverty reduction \n46. \nand social development in recent years is at risk from the pandemic. Despite the progress made, \nBangladesh still has 34 million people living in poverty. Moreover, almost half of Bangladesh\u2019s \npopulation lives marginally above the poverty line and risks falling back into poverty because of \nthe pandemic. \n \n47. \nThe pandemic has resulted in severe disruptions to domestic economic activities, which \nare expected to increase unemployment and incidences of poverty. It is estimated that 1.4 million\u2013\n3.7 million workers may lose their jobs and 13 million people may fall back into poverty, many of \nthem informal sector workers. The government\u2019s countercyclical social protection expenditures \ninclude a number of programs designed to provide direct and immediate relief for the poor. The \npoor  and  vulnerable  groups  will  receive  cash  payments  and  food  supply  and  this  support  is \nextended to the informal workers, who are not currently covered by the social safety net. Overall, \nmore  than  15  million  people  can  benefit  from  the  government  programs  already  announced. \nFurthermore,  the  government  programs  also  aim  to  protect  jobs  in  the  labor-intensive  export \nindustries  and  SMEs,  with  salary  support  or  low  interest  rate  loans  for  businesses.    These \nprograms  will  help the  workers to  maintain their  living  standard  while  keeping  the  industries  in \nbusiness. By preserving the industrial base of the country, these government programs will help \nlay the ground for a faster economic recovery and sustained poverty reductions going forward.  \n \nGender. Bangladesh has been ranked the top South Asian country for gender and 50th \n48. \non the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Gender Gap Index.36 Despite the improvements made, \ngender  inequality  persists  in  Bangladesh.  Women  still  own  only  13%  of  agricultural  land37 and \nhave  lower  levels  of  literacy  (56.87%,  as  against  61.28%  for  men).38 They  have  a  lower  labor \nmarket  participation  rate,  particularly  in  the  formal  economy  (36.3%  for  women  and  80.5%  for \nmen).  Households  headed  by  women  accounted  for  12.5%  of  all  households  in  2014  and  are \n\n \n\n35  ADB. 2018. Technical Assistance for Capacity Building for Improving Portfolio Performance.

While over-represented in the health care industry, female \ndoctors, nurses, and health workers are leading the fight against the pandemic, very often risking \ntheir own health. \n \nThe  program  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming  at  entry.  Many  of  the \n49. \ngovernment  programs  have  significant  gender  and  social  inclusion  elements.  Specifically, \nstrengthening of social safety nets will benefit many women and households headed by women \nthat make up most of the poor, vulnerable households, and informal workers. Health insurance \nand cash honorariums provided to doctors, nurses, and other health workers will also particularly \nbenefit women. Support in key areas such as the RMG and services industries will help to keep \nthe majority of female workers employed and out of poverty. ADB\u2019s program has gender targets \nfor most key performance indicators and requests sex-disaggregated monitoring and reporting, \nwith the assistance of ADB TA resources. \n \n50. \nSafeguards. Following an assessment of outputs, the program is not expected to have \nadverse  environmental  or  social  safeguards  impacts  and  will  not  trigger  ADB\u2019s  safeguards \npolicies. It is categorized C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \nNo category A or B activities are expected. \n \n51. \nSummary of risk assessment and risk management plan. Major risks and mitigating \nmeasures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in  detail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk \nmanagement plan.39 \n\n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nKey Risks \nDelayed implementation of the economic \nstimulus or inadequate size may reduce \neffectiveness of program. \nSignificant escalation of the pandemic may \nlead to severe disruptions in government work \nthat may hamper program implementation. \n\nInsufficient internal control may lead to \nreduced efficiency, fairness, and transparency \nof the government support programs. \n\nThe government\u2019s plan to fund a significant \nportion of expenditures from domestic \nsources may not succeed if the pandemic \nsituation deteriorates. \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nThe government spending needs to be frontloaded \nand delivered to the people who need them the most \n\u2013 poor, women and informal workers.  \nThe programs are direct support, and delivered \nthrough existing channels, many of which have been \nsupported by other development partners. This will \nreduce cost, improve efficiency and reduce risks.  \nQuarterly monitoring report from the Ministry of \nFinance and technical assistance capacity building \nand support will be provided to strengthen monitoring \nand evaluation. \nThe government has been prudent in raising external \ndebts, with a low external debt\u2013gross domestic \nproduct ratio of 15%.

Adverse impact of \n\nexogenous shocks  \n\n \nASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH ACCESS CRITERIA FOR THE \nCOUNTERCYCLICAL SUPPORT FACILITY AND COVID-19 PANDEMIC RESPONSE \nOPTION \n \nADB Staff Assessment \nThe  pandemic  has  severe  negative  health  and  economic  impacts  on \nBangladesh.  \n \nHealth  impact.  Given  the  density  of  the  country\u2019s  population,  sizable  slum \npopulation,  and  its  underdeveloped  medical  system,  Bangladesh  faces \nsignificant  challenges  in  containing  the  disease  and  providing  treatment  to \ninfected people.  \n \nImpact  on  the  economy.  The  economy  was  hit  by  the  pandemic  and  the \nsubsequent lockdown. The gross domestic product (GDP) growth in fiscal year \nFY2020  will  drop  to  3.8%  by  IMF  estimate.  The  economy  will  be  also  be \naffected by the spillover effects of the global recession, as already evidenced \nin the decline of export and remittances. \n \nImpact on the vulnerable population. With 20.5% of the population still living \nbelow the poverty line, 10.5% of the population living in extreme poverty, and \nalmost half of the population marginally above the poverty line, the population \nis extremely vulnerable to external shocks. The livelihood of many workers in \nthe  informal  sector  is  at  risk  because  of  the  nationwide  lockdown  and  the \nensuing economic recession. By potentially putting 13 million people below the \nnational poverty line, the pandemic threatens to reverse decades of progress \nmade in poverty reduction in Bangladesh. \n \nImpact  on  the  fiscal  position  of  the  country.  Revenue  will  be  reduced \nbecause  of slow  economy  and  trade, and  expenditures will escalate to fund \nthe economic stimulus. Overall, the budget deficit is expected to rise to 7.5% \nfrom 5.0% projected before the pandemic.  \n \nThe government has rolled out countercyclical measures to combat the \npandemic. The government\u2019s priority is to provide funding to strengthen the \nhealth  care  services  and  infrastructure.  An  additional  Tk2.5  billion  has  been \nprovided to the Health Services Division of the Ministry of Health and Family \nWelfare  to  fund  a  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  preparedness  and \nresponse  plan.  On  5  April  2020,  a  countercyclical  expenditure  plan  was \nannounced to shore up the social safety net to protect the vulnerable groups \nand  stimulate  the  economy.  The  announced  countercyclical  package  totals \n$11 billion.  \n(i) \n\n2.  Countercyclical \ndevelopment \nexpenditures \n\n(ii) \n\nIncreasing public expenditure. Generating employment will be given \npriority in public expenditure.  \nIntroducing a stimulus package through banks. Some low-interest \ncredit facilities will be launched through the banking system, mainly to \nrejuvenate economic activities.  \n\n(iii)  Widening social safety net coverage. Coverage of the existing social \nsafety net will be further widened to fulfill the basic needs of people living \nbelow  the  poverty  line  such  as  day  laborers  and  people  engaged  in \nnonformal work. \n\nThe  Bangladesh  Bank  has  already  reduced  the  cash  reserve  ratio  and \nrepossess rate to boost monetary supply and exercised regulatory forbearance \nto keep the credit flowing. \nMacroeconomic  management  was  largely  sound  with  high  growth  and \nbenign  inflation  before  the  pandemic.  The  economy  grew  7.4%  annually \n\n3.  Preshock record of \ngenerally sound \n\n \n\n\fAccess Criteria \n\nmacroeconomic \nmanagement \n\n4.  Structural reforms \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n25 \n\nADB Staff Assessment \nduring  FY2015\u2013FY2019.  The  public  debt\u2013GDP  ratio  was  low  at  34.9%  in \nFY2019.  Inflation  averaged  5.8%  during  FY2015\u2013FY2019,  and  the  budget \ndeficit averaged 4.3% during the same period. The foreign exchange reserves \nwere $32.7 billion at the end of 2019. IMF Article IV consultation concluded in \nSeptember 2019 confirmed that \u201cBangladesh continues to achieve impressive \neconomic growth and social development.\u201d \nThe  National  Preparedness  and  Response  Plan  was  adopted  on  18  March \n2020 to guide the nation\u2019s health sector response. The COVID-19 Emergency \nOperation Center was set up at the Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control \nand Research under the Directorate General of Health Services to coordinate \nnationwide preparedness and response activities. Entry control and screening \nwas enforced, and testing was strengthened. The government also imposed \neffective social distancing measures, including the closure of public and private \nestablishments  and  suspension  of  public  transportation  services.  The \ncountercyclical economic package is being implemented by various agencies \nto stabilize the private sector and the financial market, provide a cash cushion \nfor the poor, and protect employment by supporting key industries and small \nand medium-sized enterprises. \n\n5.  Debt sustainability  Public debt in Bangladesh was $105 billion in FY2019, around 34.9% of GDP, \nand the external public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt ratio was 14.5% \nof GDP, both low. The additional external debt of $2.9 billion, as government \nprojected,  will  increase  both  the  external  PPG  debt\u2013GDP  ratio  and  public \ndebt\u2013GDP ratio by 0.9% in FY2020. Bangladesh remains at low risk of debt \ndistress. \nADB  coordinates  closely  with  the  IMF  on  macroeconomic  monitoring  and \nparticipation  in  Article  IV  missions.  The  IMF  supports  ADB\u2019s  response \nthat \nmeasures  and  has  provided  an  assessment \nBangladesh\u2019s  sustainable  debt  dynamics  allow  the  authorities  to  increase \nexternal borrowings in response to the pandemic and Bangladesh remains at  \nlow risk of debt distress as assessed. \n\n6.
