The  country  has \nbenefited  from  higher  oil  prices  and  greater  exports,  which  have  increased  foreign  currency \ninflows  and  assisted  debt-servicing.  Kazakhstan  is  rated  Baa2  by  Moody\u2019s,  BBB  by  Standard \nand Poor\u2019s, and BBB by Fitch (all long-term issues default rating). Appendix 1 provides details \nof the country\u2019s macroeconomic outlook. \n \n3. \nNevertheless, Kazakhstan\u2019s high dependence on oil exports poses a potential threat for \nthe economy given the potential volatility in the international oil market. Small and medium-sized \nenterprises \n(SMEs)  and  other  manufacturing  and  service  companies  are  currently \nunderrepresented in the national economy.1 Creating conditions for and stimulating the growth \nof the corporate and SME sector is very important to diversifying the economy.2  \n \nB. \n\nBanking and Capital Markets in Kazakhstan \n\n4. \nImprovements  in  the  economic  and  operating  environment  of  Kazakhstan\u2019s  financial \nsector  have  led  to  rapid  growth  in  the  past  5  years  and  more  creditworthy  domestic  banks.  In \nparticular,  the  Government  of  Kazakhstan  and  the  National  Bank  of  Kazakhstan  (NBK),  the \ncentral  bank,  have  undertaken  structural  reforms  to  promote  consolidation  and  improve  the \noverall viability of the banking system. \n \n5. \nEncouraged by this improving macroeconomic environment and by robust growth, banks \nhave increased their lending volumes by an average of more than 40% per year (albeit from a \nvery  low  base),  while  generally  maintaining  healthy  asset  quality  and  profitability.  This  is \nespecially true for the top performers in the first two tiers of the banking system. However, the \n\n                                                 \n1  The SME sector is estimated to have contributed only 14%\u201315% of GDP in 2005. Because the sector is relatively \nlabor-intensive, providing approximately 40% of total employment, SME growth is inherently inclusive and pro-poor \nin nature. \n\n2  ADB.  2003.  Country  Strategy  and  Program  (2004\u20132006):  Kazakhstan.  Manila  (p.  17).  The  Government  has  a \npolicy  of  fostering  SME  development  by  promulgating  SME  laws  (for  instance  the  Law  on  State  Support  to \nDevelopment  of  Small  Business  in  the  Republic  of  Kazakhstan)  and  establishing  organizations  to  implement  this \npolicy. The policy includes various support measures, provision of services via business development centers, and \nsmall  business  loans.  An  exhibition  and  information  center  (a  wholly  state-owned  joint-stock  company)  supports \nSMEs. In addition, the Government set up the SME Support Fund in 1997 as a nonbanking financial institution. The \nfund\u2019s main objective is to use financial resources allocated within the framework of state and regional programs for \nprojects  and  activities  aimed  at  supporting  SMEs. The  fund  is  tasked  to  (i)  broaden  access  to  finance  for  SMEs, \n(ii) use state and nonstate resources to support SMEs, (iii) develop SME infrastructure, and (iv) provide advice for \nSMEs. \n\n \n\n\f 2 \n\n \n\n \n\nstrong asset growth over the past five years has put pressure on the adequacy of bank capital, \nprompting the need for Tier II capital infusions denominated especially in Tenge. Because of the \nexport- driven economy and low interest rates, banks have in the past relied heavily on dollar-\ndenominated funding and lending; however, a changing economy means that banks now need \nto move more into a tenge-denominated assets and liabilities.  \n \n6. \nOne  of  the  key  challenges  facing  the  financial  sector  is  the  emergence  of  debt  and \nequity capital markets, especially with respect to the corporate sector. To widen their access to \nfunding, many banks are keen to enter these markets. \n \nC. \n\nFuture-Flow Securitization: Overview \n\n1. \n\nSecuritization Background \n\n7. \nSecuritization  has  emerged  as  one  of  the  dominant  means  of  capital  formation \nthroughout the world, particularly in the United States and Europe. In developed markets, asset \nsecuritization serves a number of purposes: (i) supports public policy objectives, such as broad \nhome ownership and development of financial markets (especially capital, retail, and mortgage \nmarkets);  (ii)   addressing  regulatory  requirements  for  financial  institutions,  especially  capital \nadequacy and lending limit requirements applicable to banks; (iii) transfers risk, especially in the \ncontext  of  nonperforming  assets  and  portfolio  diversification;  and  (iv)  provides  an  alternative \nmeans of raising finance. In developing Asia, however, securitization is underdeveloped. \n \n\n2. \n\nFuture-Flow Securitization and Diversified Payment Rights Securitization \n\nFuture-flow securitization became popular in emerging markets in the 1990s as a way of \n8. \nreducing  sovereign-related  risk  and  providing  more  attractive  access  to  international  capital \nmarkets  for  issuers  in  the  stronger  emerging  markets.  A  future-flow  transaction  is  the \nsecuritization  of  a  company\u2019s  future  and  existing  receivables.  In  the  case  of  originators  in \nemerging markets, such receivables originate from offshore obligors. Future-flow securitizations \nmitigate many of the sovereign risks associated with an emerging market borrower by capturing \ncash flows offshore.  \n \nFuture-flow investments have consistently proven themselves to investors, and over the \n9. \nyears  they  have  successfully  mitigated  a  variety  of  the  risks  associated  with  emerging  market \ninvestments. No future-flow transaction has defaulted so far. \n \n10. \n \n\nIn Kazakhstan, future-flow transactions are only beginning to be introduced.  \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED INVESTMENT \n\nA. \n\nProject Conceptualization \n\n1. \n\nBackground and ADB\u2019s Business History in Kazakhstan \n\nADB took its first steps in Kazakhstan with loans to Bank TuranAlem JSC ($75 million) \n11. \nand  Alliance  Bank  JSC  ($50  million).3  Both  loans  were  disbursed  in  July  2006.  In  addition  to \ntheir  direct  development  impact  in  terms  of  SME  development,  these  transactions  also \n\n                                                 \n3   ADB.  2006.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  Proposed  Assistance  to \n\nPrivate Banks in Kazakhstan. Manila. \n\n\f  3\n\nintroduced  ADB  as  a  participant  in  the  market.  The  two  loans  have  been  well  received,  were \nnoted in the market, and have provided a number of follow-up opportunities. \n \n12. \nIn  the  next  phase  of  financial  sector  development  in  Kazakhstan,  ADB  intends  to \nconcentrate on capital markets. ADB\u2019s Board of Directors endorsed the first step in this direction \nby  approving  in  September  2006  ADB\u2019s  guarantee  for  the  DPR  securitization  undertaken  by \nAlliance Bank JSC.4 This transaction reached financial closure in mid-November 2006.  \n \n\n2. \n\nADB Equity Investments  \n\nADB  is  considering  taking  an  equity  position  in  the  Kazakh  banking  market,  to  further \n\n13. \nfoster the development of this sector and position ADB as serious market participant. \n \n\nIV. \n\nJSC KAZKOMMERTSBANK \n\nA. \n\nOverview  \n\n14.  Established in 1990, KKB is one of the leading banks in Kazakhstan. As of 30 June 2006, \nit  was  the  market  leader  as  measured  by  total  assets  and  loans,  the  third  largest  in  terms  of \ndeposits, and the fourth largest in terms of the number of branches. KKB provides a full range of \ncorporate,  SME,  and  retail  banking  services  and  insurance,  pension,  asset  management,  and \nother  financial  services  through  a  network  of  22 full  branches  and  68  outlets.  The  bank  has  a \nwell-developed alternative distribution network, including internet banking, 454 ATMs (including \n224 added since the beginning of 2004, of which 49 are multi-functional), over 3,200 point-of-\nsale terminals, and a call center. KKB\u2019s main competitors are Bank TuranAlem JSC and Halyk \nBank.  \n \n15.  KKB has a clear expansion strategy to become the leading universal bank in Kazakhstan. \nAs growth through the acquisition of a major player in Kazakh banking is not possible (for anti-\nmonopoly  reasons),  KKB  is  growing  aggressively  in  key  market  areas  outside  its  traditional \nstronghold  of  corporate  banking  (where  the  growth  potential  is  limited  because  of  strong \ncompetition from Bank TuranAlem JSC and Halyk Bank). KKB has managed to build a sizable \npresence  in  the  retail  and  SME  markets,  which  are  viewed  as  increasingly  attractive.  KKB\u2019s \nstrong  commercial  position  and  good  earnings  profile  mean  it  is  in  a  good  position  to  prosper \nfrom  economic  growth.  The  presence  of  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and \nDevelopment (EBRD) as a shareholder should help with KKB\u2019s corporate governance, funding, \nand capitalization. \n \n16. \nFitch (Table 1).  \n \n\nCurrently, KKB is rated by three rating agencies: Moody\u2019s, Standard & Poor\u2019s (S&P), and \n\nTable 1: KKB Bank Credit Ratings \n\nItem \nLong-term \nOutlook \nSurvivability Assessment  Baa2 \nS&P = Standard & Poor\u2019s \nSource: Moody\u2019s,S&P, Fitch. \n\nMoody\u2019s \nBaa1 \nStable \n\n \n\n \n\nS&P \nBB+ \nStable \nBBB \n\nFitch  \nBB+ \nStable \nBBB \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2006.

Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f 4 \n\n \n\n \nB. \n\nBusiness Description \n\n17. \nCorporate  Banking.  KKB  is  the  largest  lender  to  medium-sized  companies  and \ninternational  companies  operating  in  Kazakhstan.  KKB\u2019s  competitive  advantages  in  corporate \nbanking  include  its  ability  to  provide  larger  and  longer-term  facilities  than  its  peers,  and  its \naccess  to  cheaper  financing.  KKB  currently  provides  payroll  services  to  its  main  corporate \nclients, which is used for cross-selling into retail products. \n \n18. \nBanking  for  Small  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprises.  KKB  is  rapidly  increasing  its \nbanking  services  for  SMEs,  a  market  it  regards  as  underserved  and  as  offering  high-yielding \nlending opportunities.  \n \n19. \nRetail  Banking.  KKB  offers  its  retail  customers  a  comprehensive  range  of  products, \nincluding residential mortgages, consumer loans, e-banking, debit and credit cards, and deposit \nand current accounts. It has one of the top three positions in terms of market share, residential \nmortgages and retail loans, retail deposits, and credit cards, and ATM services. KKB had about \n253,000  retail  customers  as  of  30  June  2006  and  plans  to  increase  its  retail  operations  by \nexpanding its branch network to 240 by 2010 and launching an aggressive marketing campaign \nfocused on cross-selling opportunities. \n \n\nV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nOverview \n\n20. \nThe  proposed  transaction  has  two  components.  (i)  a  credit  guarantee  will  be  issued  in \nfavor of investors in notes backed by DPRs originated by KKB. The total amount of the issuance \nis expected to be up to $500 million, with ADB guaranteeing up to $100 million and MBIA and \nFGIC  guaranteeing  the  remainder;  (ii)  the  provision  of  a  senior  or  subordinated,  unsecured \nTenge  denominated  loan  of  up  to  $50  million  equivalent  for  onlending  into  the  Kazakh  SMEs \nand corporate market. The Guarantee is anchored to the Tenge Loan. \n \nB. \n\nGuarantee for DPR Securitization \n\n1. \n\nOverview \n\nThe  proposed  guarantee  will  be  issued  in  favor  of  investors  in  notes  backed  by  DPRs \n21. \noriginated by KKB. The total amount of the issuance is expected to be up to $500 million, with \nADB  guaranteeing  one  series  of  notes  with  a  face  value  of  up  to  $100  million  and  interest \naccrued thereon.  \n \n22. \nThis  will  be  the  third  issuance  under  KKB\u2019s  DPR  program.  The  first  was  in  December \n2005  by  way  of  a  private  placement.  In  June  2006,  KKB  issued  two  further  series  of  notes, \nSeries  2006A  and  2006B  Notes,  which  redeemed  the  $50  million  floating-rate  notes  series \n2005C in their entirety. The issuance in 2006 had a seven year final maturity.5 The new 2007 \nseries will increase KKB\u2019s maturity profile beyond the 7-year benchmark available in the market, \nso it can provide longer-term funding for its customers. ADB will assist KKB in this by providing \nits guarantee for a 10-year maturity.  \n                                                 \n5 Both series pay quarterly interest of three-month US dollar LIBOR plus 0.24%. The final expected maturity of both \nseries  is  in  June  2013,  with  an  average  life  of  5.1  years.  The  2006  series  notes  have  an  underlying  rating  of \nBBB/Baa2  and  due  to  the  two  guarantees  provided  by  Ambac  Insurance  Co.  and  FGIC  have  a  AAA/Aaa  rating. \n\n \n\n\f  5\n\n \n23. \nThis transaction would not only be one of the largest DPR deals ever worldwide, but also \nthe first to reach a 10-year maturity. ADB\u2019s decision was used by KKB to convince the two other \nguarantors to match ADB\u2019s maturity.  \n \n\n2. \n\nKKB\u2019s Diversified Payment Rights \n\na. \n\nIntroduction \n\nDPRs  usually  take  the  form  of  SWIFT 6   MT102,  103, 7   and  202  payment  order \n24. \nmessages. 8   These  payment  orders  are  generated  as  part  of  the  international  financial \noperations  of  KKB.  Payment  orders  are  created  as  a  result  of  KKB\u2019s  role  as  a  financial \nintermediary  between  foreign  payors  wishing  to  send  funds  to  Kazakhstan  and  residents  of \nKazakhstan receiving these funds. KKB proposes to securitize its MT100 DPRs, denominated in \nUS dollars.  \n \nKKB generates DPRs by acting as a recipient of payment orders, which arise through a \n25. \nvariety of transactions, including from exporters inside Kazakhstan selling goods or services to \ncustomers  outside  Kazakhstan,  foreign  direct  investment,  \u201cKazakhstan  flows\u201d, 9   overseas \ntransportation,  and  personal  remittances.  The  payors,  who  wish  to  make  payments  to \nbeneficiaries in Kazakhstan with accounts with KKB Bank, request their banks (payor banks), in \nthe  majority  of  cases  located  outside  Kazakhstan,  to  initiate  transactions  for  the  payment  of \namounts to beneficiaries in Kazakhstan through KKB, thereby generating payment orders. 10\n \nProcessing  payment  orders  is  a  basic  banking  business  that  offers  significant  benefits \n26. \nincluding  the  ability  to  (i)  strengthen  correspondent  banking  relationships  and  obtain  favorable \nterms  on  other  banking  products  and  businesses  from  correspondent  banks;  (ii)  attract  new \nclients in cases where payment orders are the initial contact the client has with KKB and monitor \nKKB\u2019s borrower\u2019s cash flows, (iii) provide high-quality clearing services to clients in Kazakhstan, \n(iv) generate foreign currency, (v) expand daily treasury activity, and (vi) improve liquidity.  \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \nThe  BBB  underlying  rating  on  the  series  2006A  and  2006B  notes  reflects  the  rating  agencies  survivability \nassessment of KKB, i.e., its ability to generate the necessary assets to service the transaction even under a state \nof selective default or other financial impairment, over the term of the transaction and other structural features that \nmitigate sovereign interference risk and other credit risks. \n\n6   Society  for  Worldwide  Interbank  Financial  Telecommunications  (SWIFT)  is  an  international  messaging  system \nowned  and  maintained  by  the  member  banks  (payment  order  only,  no  settlement).  MT103/103+  are  sent  by  the \nordering customer\u2019s bank to the beneficiary\u2019s bank and are used to convey a funds transfer instruction.  \n\n7   MT102  is  principally  a  set  of  bulked  customer  transfers  that  meet  certain  criteria  (e.g.,  common  correspondent \nbanks, common currency or common value date). MT103 is a customer transfer wherein either the sending party or \nthe  payer  or  both  is  not  a  financial  institution.  MT103  is  a  more  structured  version.  MT202  relates  to  payment \norders from senders to payees that are financial institutions. \n\n8   MT100 (including MT102, 103) is the standard message type for payment orders relating to payment from senders \nto payees who are individuals, companies (other than financial institutions), or governments through banks. MT200 \n(including MT202) is the standard message type for payment orders relating to payment from senders to payees \nthat are financial institutions. \n\n9   As  a  result  of  current  Kazakhstan  currency  regulation,  a  Kazakhstan  resident  cannot  make  a  foreign-currency-\ndenominated  payment  in  favor  of  another  Kazakhstan  resident.  However,  he  or  she  may  transfer  his  or  her  own \nfunds from an account with one Kazakhstan bank in favor of another account held with another Kazakhstan bank. \nSuch a payment order would be settled outside Kazakhstan. \u201cKazakhstan flows\u201d are collections that arise when a \nKazakhstan  bank  (whether  through  a  branch,  representative  office,  or  other  office  located  inside  or  outside \nKazakhstan)  or  a  foreign  bank\u2019s  Kazakhstan  branch  or  other  office  has  initiated  a  payment  order.  \u201cKazakhstan \nflows\u201d are often the result of Kazakhstan companies moving their own dollar and euro funds. \n\n10 Excluded are payments related to Western Union, credit card payments, and check payments settled through KKB. \n\nAppendix 17 provides a detailed description of a MT100 payment flow. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n 6 \n\n \n\nb. \n\nDepository Banks \n\n27. \nPayment orders received by KKB are effected by making a deposit into one of the KKB \naccounts  held  with  one  of  its  correspondent  banks  (the  depositary  banks).  These  \u201cdesignated \ndepositary  banks\u201d  (DDBs)  are  correspondent  banks  that  KKB  has  chosen  because  of  their \nexisting relationship with KKB, their credit quality, and their experience with DPRs.  \n \n\n \n3. \n\nNotes Issuance \n\n28. \nIssuer.  The special purpose vehicle (SPV), KKB  DPR Company, will  issue up to three \nseries  of  notes.  The  issuance  is  expected  to  be  listed  either  in  London  or  Luxembourg.  The \nnotes will be distributed under Rule 144A in the United States of America.  \n \n29. \nStructure of the Issuance. The issued notes will have a fixed or floating rate. Principal \nrepayment  will  be  amortized.  Investors  will  be  entitled  to  quarterly  interest  payments  and \nprincipal  payments,  in  accordance  with  the  transaction's  amortization  schedule.  On  each \nquarterly  payment  date,  the  trustee  will  make  the  scheduled  debt  service  payments  to  the \ninvestors.  \n \nPricing  of  the  Notes.  The  notes  issued  by  the  SPV  and  guaranteed  by  ADB  are  not \n30. \nexpected to compete directly with any ADB bond issues. Despite both issues having the same \nratings (AAA), the spread of the ADB bonds is expected to be tighter, reflecting the risks of ADB \nas the ultimate borrower. Pricing of the SPV notes will incorporate a prepayment risk, since KKB \ncan choose to buy back the notes from the note holders in the event that it wants to stop paying \nguarantee fees to ADB and its credit rating improves to a level where reissuing would be less \nexpensive in case of a trigger event. Investors buying the notes are not seeking an ADB bond; \nthey will have to price in the risk of prepayment, other structural features of the notes, and the \nilliquidity of the paper (essentially buy and hold), all of which will justify a higher yield than for a \nregular ADB bond.  \n \n\n4. \n\nExpected Rating \n\n31.  Moody\u2019s and Standard & Pors are expected to provide shadow ratings of the notes. The \nratings are expected to be up to Baa2 for Moody\u2019s and BBB for Standard & Poors. The rating \nupgrade  (as  compared  to  KKB\u2019s  corporate  rating)  will  be  based  on  (i)  the  structural \nenhancements  built  into  the  transaction,  which  will  include  certain  DSCR  and  rating  triggers, \nand  (ii)  the  respective  rating  agency\u2019s  bank  survivability  assessment  of  KKB  that  will  mitigate \nsovereign  and  certain  bank  credit  risks.11  The  survivability  assessment  also  looks  at  potential \nsupport by the regulator in case of the bank\u2019s default or insolvency.12 Rating agencies generally \n                                                 \n11  Ratings of future flow transactions are tied to the credit quality of the originator, which is typically measured by its \nlocal currency issuer default rating,  which could be rated higher than the company\u2019s local currency issuer default \nrating  after  considering  the  company\u2019s  ability  to  continue  operating  beyond  a  general  default  and  generate \nreceivables for the duration of the deal. The rating agencies generally assume that banks will be able to continue \ntheir  business,  even  in  case  of  default,  especially  with  respect  to  a  core  business  like  DPRs.  In  addition, \nGovernment  support  for  the  top  five  banks  is  expected  in  Kazakhstan.  The  going  concern  assessment  (Fitch \nmethodology)  and  survivability  assessment  (Moody\u2019s)  address  these  issues.  Achieving  a  rating  at  this  level  is \ntherefore a twofold concept: The company must not only continue to generate these receivables by producing and \ndelivering the product, but the collections from the receivables must also be legally protected through a true sale \nstructure. Both aspects are fulfilled for a Kazakh DPR securitization. \n\n12 The  central  bank\u2019s  support  for  banking  has  been  mixed.  In  the  first  instance,  Kramds  Bank,  at  the  time  the  fifth \nlargest  bank  in  terms  of  assets  and  a  privately  owned  bank,  was  liquidated  in  October  1996  despite  its  size  and \napparent  importance.  The  bank  was  insolvent  because  of  the  high  level  of  bad  loans.  Before  the  liquidation,  the \n\n \n\n\f  7\n\nsee the involved volume risk, devaluation exposure, obligor risk, and sovereign redirection risk \nin a DPR securitization as low compared to corporate transactions. \n \n\n5. \n\nTerms and Conditions of the Guarantee \n\n32. \nGuarantee  Coverage.  ADB  will  guarantee  timely  payment  of  principal  and  interest  on \nthe  notes.  ADB\u2019s  guarantee  will  be  unconditional  and  irrevocable,  and  documented  in \naccordance  with  market  standards  for  this  type  of  transaction  and  at  the  same  terms  and \nconditions as those for the other two guarantee companies. \n \n33. \nExclusions  and  Limits  on  Coverage. ADB will not guarantee (i) any failure to pay by \nhedge  counterparties,  (ii)  any  \u201cmake-whole  redemption\u201d  premium,  (iii)  taxes  on  the  Series \n2007B  Notes,  (iv) default  or  overdue  interest,  and  (v)  accelerated  principal  (whether  or  not  as \nthe  result  of  an  early  amortization  event  or  a  sale  recision  event).  Further,  ADB  will  not \nguarantee the repayment of the Series 2007B Notes prior to a scheduled quarterly amortization \ndate. \n \n34. \nGuarantee Fee. ADB will receive a guarantee fee, the amount of which will be based on \nsimilar DPR securitization structures in Kazakhstan and Turkey. The guarantee fee will be set in \naccordance with ADB policies by the guarantee committee. \n \nC. \n\nTenge-denominated Unsecured Loan \n\n35. \nADB  is  proposing  a  senior  or  subordinated,  unsecured  loan  for  up  to  the  equivalent  of \n$50  million,  denominated  in  tenge.  The  main  terms  and  conditions  are  (i)  a  5-year  maturity, \n(ii) amortization of the loan, with a grace period to determined, (iii) a fixed or floating interest rate \nto be determined by the ADB interest rate committee, (iv) an underwriting fee of 0.50% to 1.0%, \nand  (v)  a  commitment  fee  of  up  to  0.5%.  The  loan  would  be  used  for  SME  and  corporate \nonlending. Instead of senior debt the loan may also be structured as subordinated debt, with an \nindicative maturity of up to 8 years (or the minimum regulatory requirement for Tier II capital). \n \n\nVI. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS AND ASSUMPTIONS \n\nA. \n\nJustification  \n\n1. \n\nInvestment Objective \n\n36. \nADB\u2019s objective in the proposed Guarantee and Tenge Loan is to develop Kazakhstan\u2019s \nbanking  and  securitization  market  in  order  to  (i)  diversify  funding  options,  (ii)  allow  access  to \nlonger term funds, (iii) increase onlending to SMEs, and (iii) attract a new set of investors.  \n \n37. \nProvision  of  Guarantee.  ADB\u2019s  proposed  Guarantee  will  increase  interest  in  DPR \nsecuritization  from  Kazakhstan.  By  further  cementing  a  credit  history  for  KKB,  the  proposed \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \ncentral bank provided Kramds Bank with financial and technical support to try to return the bank to solvency, but \nproblems were irremediable. In 1997, the central bank decided to support Turan Bank and Alem Bank, at that time \nthe fourth and second largest banks. The banks were insolvent because of a very high level of problem loans. The \ntwo banks were merged to form Bank TuranAlem in 1997 by setting aside $90 million for the bank\u2019s recapitalization. \nBank  TuranAlem  no  longer  has  any  significant  problems  and  was  privatized  in  1998,  which  restored  public \nconfidence.  The  central  bank  intervened  to  support  smaller  banks  affected  by  the  Russian  crisis  of  1998.  In  the \ninitial  stage  of  banking  restructuring  between  1992  and  1995,  the  central  bank\u2019s  response  to  the  high  level  of \nproblem  loans  was  to  transfer  them  to  state-owned  banks  and  entities.  The  rating  agencies  therefore  expect \nGovernment support in case of a sector crisis. \n\n \n\n\fProject enhances its ability to raise funds in the international capital markets and obtain longer \ntenor funds than currently possible in the market. KKB\u2019s business lines generating DPRs will be \nunder constant scrutiny by  rating agencies forcing KKB to  adopt and  comply  with  best  market \npractices.  The  DPR  Transaction  will  boost  investor  and  creditor  confidence,  both  international \nand domestic, in Kazakhstan\u2019s banking system, and increase depositor confidence in the local \neconomy  and  banking  system.  The  DPR  Transaction  allows  KKB  to  extend  the  tenor  of  its \nborrowings to up to 10 years, 3 years longer than the maximum tenor it has been able to obtain \nfrom  the  market.  In  turn  KKB  will  be  able  to  lengthen  its  tenor  for  its  customers.  The  DPR \nTransaction will therefore bridge an unwanted maturity gap and allow KKB to match its assets \nand  liabilities  more  closely.  In  addition,  the  securitization  will  allow  KKB  to  access  lower  cost \nfunds, which will make KKB more competitive and allow it to pass savings to its customers. \n \nTenge  Loan.  ADB\u2019s  second  objective  is  to  foster  Tenge-denominated  corporate  and \n38. \nSME financing. ADB is assisting the Government to steer the economy toward more sustainable \ncorporate-led growth and away from dependence on natural resource industries.  \n \nIf the Tenge Loan is structured as subordinated debt (Tier II capital), this will help KKB \n39. \nachieve  sustainable  growth.    Such  structure  could  be  replicated  by  other  other  Kazahk  banks \nfollowing the KKB Tier II capital management model. \n \nIn a country with a rapidly developing economy and a fast growing banking sector such \n40. \nas Kazakhstan, there is inevitable pressure on banks\u2019 capital adequacy. Access to subordinated \ndebt,  which  counts  as  Tier  II  capital,  is  key  to  addressing  this  issue.  ADB  would  be  the  first \ninstiution  to  offer  this  product  denominated  in  Tenge.  With  this  project,  ADB  will  therefore \nsupport the development and growth of a sustainable banking sector. \n \n41. \nBanks  make  use  of  subordinated  debt  as  a  capital  instrument\u2014i.e.,  to  achieve  their \nregulatory  capital  requirements.  This  is  a  common  practice  worldwide  and  prevalent  even  in \nrelatively unsophisticated markets. The key feature of subordinated debt is that in the case of a \nliquidation  of  the  bank,  subordinated  creditors  will  be  paid  only  after  all  senior  creditors  have \nbeen repaid in full. Any call or pre-payment of subordinated debt would typically be subject to \ncompliance with minimum capital ratios (after the call) and/or require approval by the regulator. \n \n42. \nADB Bond Issue. ADB\u2019s third objective is to issue its first domestic bond in Kazakhstan \nand therefore to establish a benchmark for AAA risk in the country and foster the development \nof the local bond market. \n \n\n2. \n\nDevelopment Outcome \n\n43. \nCorporate-led Growth. The Government is striving to diversify the economy and reduce \nKazakhstan\u2019s  dependence  on  oil.  This  entails  improving  the  access  of  the  non-oil  sectors  to \nfinance and making these sectors more attractive to investors. The DPR Transaction seeks to \nachieve  this  by  helping  develop  the  capital  market  through  diversifying  funding  sources  for \nborrowers and increasing the availability of investment grade products for investors.  \n \n44. \nAlthough the concept of DPR securitization is not entirely new to Kazakhstan, there have \nbeen only a few issues, the only ones completed in Asia. They form part of a handful of future-\nflow transactions executed so far in Asia. An increase in the number of DPR securitizations will \nimprove the understanding of this financing technique. This proposal is expected to facilitate the \ndevelopment  of  a  full-scale  securitization  market  in  Kazakhstan,  and  to  have  spillover  effects \nelsewhere in the region. \n\n 8 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f  9\n\n \n45. \nThe  proposed  DPR  Transaction  will  allow  KKB  to  service  its  core  businesses  and  to \nexpand  its  financing  of  SMEs  and  other  companies\u2014including  those  in  rural  areas\u2014via  the \nexisting  and  growing  branch  network  of  KKB,  as  well  as  to  foster  diversification  of  its  loan \nportfolios.  \n \n46. \nIncrease  Access  to  International  Capital  Markets. DPR securitization is designed to \nmitigate  sovereign  risk  so  that  non-investment-grade  borrowers  can  access  longer-term \nfinancing at lower interest rates than they could by borrowing directly. The innovative structuring \nof  these  transactions  has  allowed  many  non-investment-grade  borrowers  in  developing \ncountries to obtain financing at significantly lower interest costs and for longer durations. ADB\u2019s \ninvolvement as guarantor will enhance KKB\u2019s credit rating.  \n \n47. \nSecuritization of future-flow and existing receivables can provide a way of raising finance \nfor many low-income and, in particular, middle-income countries, especially during times of low \nliquidity  and  heightened  perception  of  sovereign  risk.  During  a  liquidity  crisis,  developing \ncountries  need  innovative  ways  of  raising  finance.  Future-flow  receivables  securitization \nprovides a way of securing credit ratings for new issues that reduce sovereign-related risk and \nthereby  of  reducing  the  cost  of  funding.  Future-flow  securitizations  also  attract  a  much  wider \nclass of investors because of their investment grade rating. Moreover, by establishing a credit \nhistory for the borrower, these deals enhance its ability to access capital markets in the future \nand reduce the costs. \n \n48. \nFrom  the  investors\u2019  point  of  view,  the  attractiveness  of  this  asset  class  lies  in  its  good \ncredit rating and its stellar performance in good and bad times. No debt defaults on rated future- \nflow asset-backed securities issued by developing country entities have been recorded, despite \nrepeated liquidity and solvency crises.13\n \nDPR  flow  securitization  has  not  been  available  in  Central  Asia  or  other  parts  of  Asia, \n49. \nexcept for Kazakhstan. It would be suitable to such countries as Azerbaijan, Indonesia, Pakistan, \nand the Philippines. ADB has already been approached by lead managers in other markets and \nwill need to build its reputation and expertise in this field.  \n \n50. \nAs  local  banks  realize  the  funding  advantages  inherent  in  packaging  securitized  DPR \nflows,  they  will  become  more  competitive  in  terms  of  fees  charged  for  DPRs  and  remittance \ntransfers.  This  will  encourage  both  senders  and  beneficiaries  to  become  bank  clients  and \nthereby enter the formal banking system. \n \n51. \nImprove  Finances  of  Local  Banks.  Tenge-denominated  debt  and  securitization  will \nhelp improve the asset and liability management of local banks by providing them with access to \nfunding  that  is  free  from  foreign  exchange  risk,  has  a  longer  term,  and  is  cheaper. \nImprovements  in  the  banks\u2019  finances  will  in  turn  improve  the  stability  of  the  region\u2019s  banking \nsystem. \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n13  The asset class withstood the test of the Mexican peso crisis in 1994\u20131995, the Asian liquidity crisis in 1997\u20131998, \nand  the  Ecuadorian  debt  default  in  1999.  A  receivable  transaction  with  of  PTCL,  Pakistan's  telephone  company, \ncontinued to perform even in the face of a selective default on sovereign debt. \n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\n \n\n3. \n\nValue Added of ADB  \n\n52. \nADB\u2019s proposed Guarantee will add value by (i) enabling wider distribution of the Series \n2007B Notes, especially to Asian investors; (ii) increasing and diversifying funding sources and \ninvestment  products;  (iii)  providing  access  to  longer-term  financing  for  KKB;  (iv)   helping  to \ndevelop  the  securitization  market  in  Kazakhstan;  and  (v) increasing  investor  confidence  in \nKazakhstan\u2019s  relatively  young  banking  and  capital  market.  ADB\u2019s  proposed  Tenge  Loan  will \nprovide  value  by  (i)  developing  the  SME  market  in  Kazakhstan,  in  general;  and  (ii)  assisting \nKKB  in  its  transition  into  local  currency  operations  and  improving  its  capital  adequacy \nrequirments, in particular. \n \n\n4. \n\nDevelopment Impact Measurement \n\n53. \nADB  will  measure  the  expected  development  impact  of  the  Project.  Its  performance \nmeasures  will  follow  the  Standards  for  Evaluation  of  Private  Sector  Investment  Operations  of \nthe Evaluation Cooperation Group of the multilateral development banks. Development impact \nis  measured  in  three  distinct  categories:  (i)  business  performance  of  the  project,  (ii)  economic \nsustainability,  and  (iii)  private  sector  development.  Appendix  2  shows  the  development  impact \nframework. \n \n54. \nits funds under the proposed Tenge Loan. \n \nB. \n\nADB will discuss with KKB the inclusion of EBRD\u2019s monitoring standards for the usage of \n\nSocial and Environmental Safeguard Policies  \n\n55. \nThe  proposed  Tenge  Loan  has  been  assigned  a  Category  \u201cFI\u201d  environmental \nclassification  and  is  classified  as  Category  \u201cC\u201d  with  respect  to  indigenous  people  and \nresettlement.  KKB  will  be  required  to  establish  an  environmental  management  system  and  to \nbuild  capacity  for  implementing  it.  At  least  one  KKB  officer  will  attend  ADB-sponsored \nenvironmental  management  training.  It  should  be  noted  however  that  the  social  and \nenvironmental  safeguard  policies  of  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development \nare already in place and that the EMS, which is based on EBRD standards, conforms to ADB \nstandards.  \n \n56. \nA desk review of KKB\u2019s DPR operations shows that these activities will have no adverse \nimpacts with respect to the environment. Thus, on a stand-alone basis, the proposed Guarantee \nwould be assigned a Category \u201cC\u201d environmental classification. \n \nC. \n\nAnticorruption Policy, and Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of \nTerrorism \n\n57. \nKKB  has  been  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  Anticorruption  (1998,  as  amended  to  date) \nand  policy  relating  to  combating  money  laundering  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.14  KKB  will \nundertake  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and  controls  following \ninternational best practice standards for preventing corruption, money laundering activities, and \nthe  financing  of  terrorism  in  the  insurance  and  indemnity  agreements.  Further,  KKB  will \nundertake  to  refrain  from  engaging  in  such  activities.  The  documentation  between  ADB  and \nKKB will allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings.  \n \n                                                 \n14  ADB. 2003.

Manila.  \n\n \n\n\f  11\n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n58. \nADB will enter into acceptable guarantee and loan agreements and other required legal \ndocuments, following approval of the proposed Guarantee and Tenge Loan by the Board. These \nagreements will be on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. \n \n59. \nA framework agreement relating to ADB\u2019s status, privileges, and immunities with respect \nto  its  lending  and  guarantee  operations  in  the  private  sector  is  in  effect  between  Kazakhstan \nand  ADB.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment  will  be  asked  to  confirm  that  it  has  no  objection  to  the  proposed  ADB  guarantee \nand  tenge  loan  to  KKB.  The  Guarantee  will  not  become  effective  and  no  funding  under  the \nTenge Loan will be made available until ADB receives such confirmation. \n \n\nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n60. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  guarantee  and  tenge-denominated  loan  would  comply \nwith the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the  \nBoard approve (i) the Guarantee of up to $100 million of principal and accrued interest for notes \nwith a maturity of 10 years; (ii) the proposed unsecured Tenge denominated loan of up to $50 \nmillion equivalent, both on terms and conditions substantially in accordance with those set forth \nin this report, and as may be reported to the Board; and (iii) the proposal that ADB\u2019s investment \nthrough  the  Guarantee  and  the  Tenge  Loan  exceed  the  exposure  limit  of  $75  million  in  any \nsingle investment. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n28 February 2007 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\nKAZAKHSTAN: MAJOR MACROECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS \n\nEconomic Assessment and Outlook \n\n \nA. \n \nHigh world oil prices, strong domestic consumption, and buoyant investment underlie the \n1. \ncontinuing  economic  boom  in  this  oil-rich  export  economy.  Gross  domestic  product  (GDP) \ngrowth,  led  by  the  oil  subsector,  averaged  10.4%  per  annum  during  2001\u20132006.  GDP  growth \nreached  10.6%  in  2006  and  is  set  to  grow  annually  by  an  average  of  9%  during  2007\u20132009 \n(increasing from $78 billion in 2006 to $140 billion in 2009). Furthermore, representing 65% of \nGDP, the private sector is increasingly driving growth in the economy.1  \n \n2. \nThe fiscal position remained robust in 2006, owing to high world oil prices and improved \ntax  administration.  Despite  an  expansionary  fiscal  policy,  mainly  associated  with  large  salary \nincreases, the general government budget still recorded a surplus; though it contracted from 2% \nof GDP in 2005 to 0.8% of GDP at the end of 2006.  \n \nHigh world commodity prices in 2006 helped boost exports by 37.3% to $38.2 billion; oil \n3. \nand  metals  continued  to  be  major  export  items,  accounting  for  more  than  two  thirds  of  the \nincrease. Although imports also increased by almost 37%, the trade surplus expanded by 38% \nto $12.2 billion. While the deficit on the services, income, and transfers account has widened, \nthe current account recorded a surplus at 0.3% of GDP at the end of the third quarter of 2006.  \n \n4. \nGross  official  reserves  (including  the  assets  of  the  National  Fund  of  the  Republic  of \nKazakhstan)  doubled,  totaling  $30  billion  in  2006  (equivalent  to  about  5  months  of  imports  of \ngoods and services); while year-end foreign asset holdings of the National Fund, which saves a \npart  of  the  Government\u2019s  oil  and  mineral  revenues  for  future  generations,  amounted  to  $14 \nbillion. Outstanding public external debt fell to $1.7 billion (or 2% of GDP) by the end of 2006. In \ncontrast,  the  stock  of  private  sector  external  debt  (excluding  oil  and  gas  intracompany  debt) \nsurged  by  $16  billion  in  2006  to  $33  billion  (or  42%  of  GDP).  The  upsurge  in  private  debt  in \nrecent  years\u2014mainly  local  bank  borrowing  for  onlending\u2014was  largely  a  response  to  the \ndifferential between available foreign borrowing rates and domestic lending rates.  \n \nLed  by  the  strong  increase  in  public  wages,  buoyant  oil  revenues,  and  credit  boom, \n5. \ninflation picked up to 8.6%, higher than the Government target of 7.0%. Structural rigidities that \nlimit competition in certain segments of the economy also contributed in part to rising inflation. \nTo  subdue  inflation,  the  National  Bank  of  Kazakhstan  (NBK)  endeavored  to  reduce  excess \nliquidity in the economy by (i) increasing the refinancing rate from 8% to 9%, (ii) strengthening \nthe minimum bank reserve requirements, (iii) sterilizing extra foreign exchange inflow, and (iv) \nallowing tenge appreciation. However, despite all these measures, broad money growth rose by \n60% in 2006, compared to 29% in 2005.   \n  \n6. \nIn 2006, the tenge appreciated strongly against the dollar (7.7% on average) as a result \nof  strong  export  earnings,  foreign  direct  investment,  and  private  external  borrowing.  Largely \nbecause  of  future  substantial  oil-related  revenues,  real  appreciation  may  continue  in  the \nmedium term.  \n \n7. \nThe  medium-term  outlook  for  the  economy  is  positive,  assuming  high  world  oil  prices, \nbuoyant  foreign  direct  investment  inflows,  strong  domestic  consumption,  continuation  of \n\n                                                 \n1  European Bank for Reconstruction  and Development  and Merrill Lynch  estimate. This is up from 55% of GDP in \n\n1998. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n13\n\nPolitical and Regional Background \n\neconomic  diversification,  good  macroeconomic  management,  and  political  stability.  In  the \nmedium  term,  GDP  is  expected  to  grow  at  an  average  of  9%;  the  Government\u2019s  target  is  to \ndouble  GDP  by  2008  in  comparison  to  the  2000  level.  Despite  the  Government\u2019s  efforts, \ninflation is expected to rise above the current NBK target (6\u20137%), mainly because of the excess \ndomestic  demand,  an  expansionary  fiscal  policy,  and  buoyant  oil-related  business  incomes. \nDriven by the hydrocarbons sector, exports are projected to surge by 10% on average per year. \nThis  strong  growth  will  be  supported  by  greater  oil  production  and  continued  high  world \ncommodity prices. Imports are also forecast to rise, driven by strong domestic consumption and \na boost in investments.  \n \nB. \n \nKazakhstan  became  an  independent  sovereign  state  in  1991  as  a  result  of  the \n8. \ndissolution  of  the  former  Soviet  Union.  Since  then,  Kazakhstan  has  experienced  significant \nchange as it emerged from a single party political system and a centrally controlled command \neconomy to a market-oriented, democratic model. The transition was initially marked by political \nuncertainty and tension, a recessionary economy marked by high inflation and instability of the \nlocal currency, and rapid but incomplete changes in the legal environment. \n \n9. \nSince 1992, Kazakhstan has actively pursued a program  of economic reform designed \nto establish a free-market economy through privatization of state enterprises and deregulation; it \nis  more  advanced  in  this  respect  than  some  other  countries  of  the  Commonwealth  of \nIndependent States. However, as with any transition economy, no assurance can be given that \nsuch reforms and other reforms described elsewhere in this proposal will continue or that such \nreforms will achieve all or any of their intended aims. \n \n10. \nKazakhstan depends on neighboring states to access world markets for a number of its \nmajor exports, including oil, steel, copper, ferro-alloys, iron ore, aluminum, coal, lead, zinc, and \nwheat. Kazakhstan is thus dependent on good relations with its neighbors to ensure its ability to \nexport.  In  addition  to  taking  various  steps  to  promote  regional  economic  integration  among \nneighboring  countries, Kazakhstan  signed  an agreement  in  September  2003  with Belarus,  the \nRussian Federation, and Ukraine to create a single economic zone, which is expected to result \nin  common  economic  policies,  harmonization  of  legislation  implementing  such  policies,  and \ncreation of a single commission on trade and tariffs. The aim of the single economic zone is to \ncreate  a  free  customs  area  within  which  member  countries  would  enjoy  free  movement  of \ngoods, services, capital, and labor. Another step toward integration, which is being considered \nby member countries, is the coordination of their fiscal policies, credit and currency policies, and \ngovernment  policies.  These  efforts  will  support  further  economic  integration  within  the \nCommonwealth of Independent States, one of the aims of which is to assure continued access \nto export routes. \n \nC. \n \n11. \nSince  Kazakhstan  is  heavily  dependent  on  export  trade  and  commodity  prices,  its \neconomy  was  severely  affected  by  the  Asian  financial  crisis  in  July  1997  and  by  the  Russian \ncrisis  in  1998,  both  of  which  caused  world  commodity  prices  to  plummet.  To  protect \nKazakhstan\u2019s  economy  from  low  commodity  prices  and  economic  instability  elsewhere  in  the \nworld,  the  Government  has  promoted  economic  reform,  inward  foreign  investment,  and \ndiversification  of  the  economy.  Notwithstanding  these  efforts,  low  commodity  prices  and  weak \ndemand in its export markets may adversely affect Kazakhstan\u2019s economy in the future. \n \n\nMacroeconomic Considerations and Exchange Rate Policies \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\nThe  Government  began  implementing  market-based  economic  reforms  in  1992, \n12. \nincluding  (i)  a  significant  privatization  program,  (ii)  promotion  of  high  levels  of  foreign  direct \ninvestment  (particularly  in  the  oil  and  gas  sectors),  and  (iii)  introduction  of  an  extensive  legal \nframework.  Despite  uneven  progress,  Kazakhstan  has  experienced  extensive  economic \ntransformation  over  the  last  12  years.  Since  mid-1994,  the  Government  has  adhered  to  a \nmacroeconomic stabilization program aimed at curtailing inflation, reducing the fiscal deficit, and \nboosting  international  currency  reserves.  According  to  figures  compiled  by  Kazakhstan\u2019s \nNational Statistical Agency, GDP has continued to grow in real terms following the adoption of a \nfloating exchange rate policy in April 1999. GDP rose by 13.5% in 2001, 9.8% in 2002, 9.2% in \n2003,  9.6% in  2004,  9.5%  in  2005, and  10.6%  in  2006.  However,  no  assurance  can  be  given \nthat  GDP  will  continue  to  grow,  and  any  decrease  in  GDP  or  in  the  rate  of  GDP  growth  in \nsubsequent years could adversely affect Kazakhstan\u2019s development. \n \n13. \nThe tenge is convertible for current account transactions, but it is not a fully convertible \ncurrency outside Kazakhstan. Between 1991, when Kazakhstan began its transition to a market-\nbased  economy,  and  April  1999,  NBK  maintained  a  managed  exchange  rate  policy,  which, \nalthough permitting the exchange rate to reflect market conditions, involved official intervention \naimed  at  limiting  fluctuations.  Depressed  export  markets  in  1998  and  early  1999  put \nconsiderable  pressure  on  Kazakhstan\u2019s  managed  exchange  rate.  The  resulting  official \nintervention  in  the  foreign  exchange  markets  led  to  losses  on  foreign  currency  reserves.  In \nresponse  to  these  pressures,  the  authorities  instituted  a  number  of  expenditure  cuts,  took \nrevenue-increasing  measures,  and  in  April  1999,  floated  the  tenge.  The  tenge  fell  by  64.6% \nagainst  the  dollar  as  of  31  December  1999,  compared  to  a  depreciation  of  10.7%  as  of  31 \nDecember  1998.  Following  the  adoption  of  a  floating  exchange  rate  policy  in  1999,  the  tenge \ncontinued  to  depreciate  against  the  dollar,  although  at  a  much  slower  rate.  It  depreciated  by \n4.6% in 2000, 3.8% in 2001, and 3.3% in 2002. The tenge subsequently appreciated against the \ndollar by 7.3% in 2003 and 9.9% in 2004. Then during the first 6 months of 2005, it depreciated \nagainst  the  dollar  by  4.0%,  to  T135.26.  Since  30  June  2005,  the  tenge  has  gradually \nappreciated against the dollar. On 30 October 2006, NBK reported the official T/$ exchange rate \nas T127.98/$1.00. \n \n14.  While NBK has stated that it has no plans to resume a managed exchange rate policy, \nany  subsequent  decision  to  support  the  exchange  rate  could  have  an  adverse  impact  on \nKazakhstan\u2019s public finances and economy. \n \nD. \n \n15. \nNBK maintains a managed floating currency regime and does not set any official targets \nfor the tenge exchange rate. It uses interventions on the foreign exchange market as one of the \ntools  to  manage  systemic  liquidity.  Monetary  policy  implementation  is  complicated  by  strong \nprivate capital inflows, rising oil earnings, and buoyant domestic demand. Broad money supply \n(M3) rose 49.7% per annum on average during 2000\u20132005, and was up a further 58% in 2006. \nCash  in  circulation  expanded  34%  per  annum  on  average  during  2000\u20132004,  and  increased \nanother 35% in 2005. The big build-up of money in the National Reserve Fund ($14 billion, or \n18%  of  GDP  as  of  the  end  of  2006),  along  with  selling  short-term  notes  and  deposits,  has \nassisted  partial  sterilization  of \ninterventions. \nNevertheless,  the  authorities  are  worried  about  the  rise  in  monetary  pressure  on  the  overall \ninflation process. With no formal target, the Government aims to keep annual inflation in the 5\u2013\n7% range during 2006\u20132008 to ensure a stable macroeconomic environment, while in 2006 the \nconsumer  price  index  increased  to  8.6%.  During  the  next  2  years,  stronger  social  spending \nalong  with  further  tax  cuts  will  continue  to  put  upward  pressure  on  disposable  income  growth \n\nliquidity  produced  by  NBK \n\nMonetary Policy \n\nthe  domestic \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n15\n\nRegulation of the Banking Industry \n\nImplementation of Market-Based Economic Reforms \n\nand  consequently  on  prices.  Market  observers  therefore  expect  that  with  some  easing  of  the \ntight  fiscal  stance,  greater  exchange  rate  flexibility  will  be  allowed  to  keep  inflation  in  check. \nNBK might allow the tenge to appreciate in 2007\u20132008 to restrain further price expansion. \n \nE. \n \n16. \nIn September 1995, NBK introduced strict prudential requirements for the operation and \ncapital  adequacy  of  banks.  In  addition,  an  institutional  development  plan  was  prepared  for \nleading Kazakhstan banks. According to the plan, banks are required to prepare their accounts \nin  accordance  with  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  and  to  apply  the  Basel \nCommittee  norms  within  the  period  determined  by  NBK  on  a  case-to-case  basis.  Further, \nKazakhstan banks are required to join a bank-funded deposit insurance scheme and be audited \nannually by a public accountancy firm approved by NBK, which is likely to be one of the leading \ninternational  firms.  Following  legislative  changes  in  July  2003,  the  Financial  Markets \nSupervisory Agency was formed, and as of 1 January 2004, it took responsibility for most of the \nsupervisory  and  regulatory  functions  in  the  financial  sector,  which  had  previously  been \nperformed by NBK. The agency\u2019s main task is to regulate and supervise the financial markets \nand financial institutions in Kazakhstan. \n \nF. \n \n17. \nThe  need  for  substantial  investment  in  many  enterprises  has  driven  the  Government\u2019s \nprivatization  program.  The  program  has  excluded  certain  enterprises  deemed  strategically \nsignificant  by  the  Government,  although  major  privatizations  in  key  sectors  have  taken  place, \nsuch as full or partial sales of certain large oil and gas producers, mining companies, and the \nnational  telecommunication  company.  However,  a  need  remains  for  substantial  investment  in \nmany  sectors  of  the  Kazakhstan  economy  and  in  some  areas  economic  performance  in  the \nprivate sector is still constrained by inadequate business infrastructure. Furthermore, the extent \nof noncash transactions in the economy and the size of the shadow economy adversely affect \nimplementation  of  reforms  and  hamper  the  efficient  collection  of  taxes.  The  Government  has \nstated that it intends to address these problems by improving bankruptcy procedures, business \ninfrastructure,  and  tax  administration;  as  well  as  by  continuing  the  privatization  process. \nImplementation  of  these  measures  in  the  short  term  has  produced  few  positive  results,  and \nimproved results may not materialize until the medium term, if at all. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fDEVELOPMENT IMPACT FRAMEWORK \n \n\nPrivate Sector Development (contribution to the growth of viable financial sector and \n\n \nReported Measure \n \n\nGeneral \n(cid:131) Evidence of spillover effects and overall development of bond \nmarket in Asia, e.g., other Asian countries undertaking DPR \nsecuritization transactions within next 36 months \n\n \nSecuritization Market in Kazakhstan \n(cid:131) Spillover effects to other banks in Kazakhstan, i.e., other Kazakh \nbanks doing at least two similar DPR deals within the next 12 \nmonths \n\n(cid:131) One more (non DPR related) cross-border transaction (with or \n\nwithout ADB involvement) within next 24 months,  \ne.g., securitization of oil or gas export receivables \n\n(cid:131) Implementation of implementing rules and regulations of the \n\nSecuritization Law within next 24 months \n\n(cid:131) First domestic securitization transaction within next 24 months\u2014\n\nanticipated asset class is SME loans or mortgage loans \n\n \nBanking Sector in Kazakhstan \n(cid:131) Contribution to financial strength of sector, e.g., better match of \n\nassets and liabilities  \n\nsector \n\n(cid:131) Decrease in the asset/liability maturity gap of the overall banking \n\n(cid:131) 5% increase in the share in total financial sector assets of private \n\nsector financial institutions  \n\n(cid:131) 5% increase in banking sector assets over the next 12 months \n(cid:131) 5% increase in SME lending over the next 24 months \n(cid:131) 5% increase in provision of tenge loans over the next 24 months \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank;
