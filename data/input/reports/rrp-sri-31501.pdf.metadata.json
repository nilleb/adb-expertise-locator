An initial environmental examination was undertaken, \nthe summary is a core appendix.  \n \nThe  Project  aims  to  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  efforts  by \nincreasing  the  access  to  safe  water  and  sanitation  of  the  poor, \nthereby  improving  their  living  conditions,  especially  of  women. \nWithin  this  framework,  the  following  challenges  are  addressed  in \nthe  Project:  (i)  to  contribute  to  the  reconstruction  efforts  by \nproviding piped water to major urban centers in the northeast; (ii) \nto  support  the  devolution  of  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation  to \nthe  provincial  councils  and  Pradeshiya  Sabhas;  and  (iii)  to \ncontinue  supporting  the  sector  reforms  identified  in  previous \nfull  cost  recovery, \ninterventions, \nindependent  regulation  of  the  water  sector,  and  increased \nparticipation of the private sector. The Project will provide water in \ntwo  major  urban  areas  in  the  North  Central,  and  Eastern \nprovinces, one urban area in the North Central Province, and two \nurban  areas  in  the  Southern  Province.  The  Project  will  also \nimplement  a  rural  water  supply  program  in  the  North  Central \nProvince \nlocal \ncommunity-based \ngovernment,  and  nongovernment  organizations,  and  support  the \nNational Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) to advance \nand  adapt  to  the  ongoing  sector  reforms  by  improving  its \noperational efficiency and its financial management.  \n \nIn its Poverty Reduction Strategy, the Government states that \"the \nprovision  of  safe  drinking  water,  and  adequate  sewage  and \nsanitation systems, is frequently cited as the single, highest social \nservice  priority  by  poor  households\u201d  and  it  identifies  access  to \nsafe  water  and  appropriate  sanitation  as  one  of  its  priorities. \nSection  III  of  the  Government\u2019s  2001  Millenium  Goals  includes \nhalving by 2015 the proportion of people who are unable to reach \nor  afford  safe  drinking  water.  It  also  identifies  as  a  main  strategy \nincreasing investment in the water and sanitation sectors. \n \nProvision  for  water  supply  and  sanitation  in  Sri  Lanka  has \nimproved  during  the  last  15  years.  During  this  period,  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  has  been  a  constant  partner  in  the \nsector. Yet, to achieve the Government's objective of increasing to \n85%  the  portion  of  the  population  with  access  to  safe  water  in \n2010,  about  SLRs12  billion  a  year  will  be  needed  to  meet  the \ndemand for piped water supply by the year 2010. \n \n\norganizations, \n\nthrough \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n \n\n\fiii\n \n\nIn  the  last  two  years,  the  Government  has  reviewed  its  rural  and \nurban water supply and sanitation policies to improve its capacity \nto face this challenge and it has proposed a \"two-pronged strategy \ninvolving  large-scale system expansion for urban schemes and a \nvast number of small-scale community improvement initiatives, to \nbring  better  water  supply  and  sanitation  services  to  poor \ncommunities.\u201d  Consequently,  the  Project  will  focus  on  major \ninvestments  in  five  secondary  towns  and  in  small  community-\nbased rural water supply.  \n \nThe overall goal of the Project is to contribute to poverty reduction \nefforts  and  to  promote  human  development  by improving access \nto  safe  water  and  sanitation  for  poor  populations,  thereby \ndecreasing  waterborne  diseases  and  reducing  the  amount  of \nresources  spent  in  these  activities.  The  Project  objectives  are  to \n(i) provide safe water to 969,000 people and sanitation to 171,500 \nin  five  urban  areas  and  in  the  rural  districts  of  the  North  Central \nProvince; and (ii) increase the capacity of the Government of Sri \nLanka  to  provide  safe  water  by  strengthening  the  water  sector \ninstitutions. \n \nThe  Project  components  are:  (i) provision of urban water supply, \nsanitation,  and  drainage  in  the  towns  of  Batticaloa,  Hambantota, \nMuttur  and  Polonnaruwa;  (ii)  provision  of  rural  water  supply  and \nsanitation in the districts of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa in the \nNorth Central Province; (iii) institutional strengthening focusing on \ntraining,  public  awareness  campaigns,  and  improvement  of \noperational and financial management of the NWSDB. \n \nThe estimated project cost is $86.4 million equivalent, comprising \nforeign exchange costs of $19.6 million (23%) and local currency \ncosts equivalent to $66.8 million (77%). \n \n \nSource \n\n($ million) \nForeign \nExchange \nADB \n \nGovernment  \n \n \nCommunities \n \nTotal \n \nPercentage Share \nADB = Asian Development Bank \n \n\n19.6 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n19.6 \n22.7 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n40.7 \n \n23.0 \n \n3.1 \n \n66.8 \n \n77.3 \n \n\nTotal \nCost \n  60.3 \n  23.0 \n \n3.1 \n  86.4 \n  100.0 \n\n \n \nPercent \n70.0 \n \n26.6 \n \n \n3.4 \n  100.0 \n \n\nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights \n45,689,000  ($60.3  million  equivalent)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources  will  be  provided.

To \nhead the unit, the Ministry of Housing and Plantation Infrastructure \nwill  appoint  a  project  director  who  will  provide  management  and \npolicy support to the project implementation units and will facilitate \nthe  detailed  strategy  and  the  implementation  of  the  institutional \nstrengthening  component.  Project  implementation  units  will  be \nestablished  in  Batticaloa,  Hambantota,  Muttur,  and  Polonnaruwa \nto  support  the  Project\u2019s  urban  investments.  Two  district  project \nsupport units and 14 implementation units will support community-\nbased  organizations  in  implementing  the  rural  subprojects.  The \nRural  Water  Supply  Division  of  NWSDB  will  provide  technical \nsupport  for  the  rural  component.  A  participatory  approach  will  be \nadopted  to  formulate  and  design  the  rural  subprojects,  and  the \nfor  subproject \ncommunity  will  have  main \nidentification, design, and implementation.  \n \nNWSDB,  under \nInfrastructure \n \nGoods  and  services  to  be  financed  by  the  ADB  loan  will  be \nprocured in accordance with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement, \nreflecting  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  and  mandatory  use  of \nstandard  bidding  documents.  International  competitive  bidding \nprocedures will be applied for supply contracts estimated to cost \nthe  equivalent  of  more  than  $500,000,  and  civil  works  contracts \nvalued  at  more  than  $2  million.  Supply  contracts  with  a  value  of \n$500,000  equivalent  or \nfollowing \ninternational shopping and supply contracts at $100,000 and less \nmay  be  procured  following  local  competitive  bidding  or  direct \npurchase procedures. Civil works  contracts valued at $2 million or \nless will be carried out under local competitive bidding. \n \nThe  Project  will  require  1,140  person-months  of  consulting \nservices  (120  person-months  of  international  and  1,020  person-\nmonths  of  domestic) \nfinance  and \naccounting,  social  development,  community  development,  and \nproject  management.  Two  consulting  firms  will  be  engaged  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  by \nAsian Development Bank and its Borrowers using the quality- and \ncost-based selection method and other arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants.  \n \n\nless  will  be  procured \n\nfor  design  engineering, \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n\nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n\fv\n \n\nThe main benefits of the Projects will be: (i) improved health and \nnutrition; (ii) less resources (time and cash) spent by households \nin water provision, especially by women and young girls; and (iii) \nsupport  to  environmentally  sustainable  economic  and  population \ngrowth, especially in the urban centers. By reducing child mortality \nand  malnutrition  due  to  waterborne  diseases,  and  increasing \nenvironmental  sustainability  due  to  a  reduction  of  ground  water \nextraction  and  unsafe  sanitation  practices,  the  Project  directly \naddresses ADB\u2019s goal of poverty reduction and contributes to the \nachievement of the Government\u2019s Millenium Goals.  \n \nAn indirect benefit of the Project will be its support to the ongoing \npeace process. The cooperation needed to implement the project \nsubcomponents in the northeast will provide a visible platform for \nthe  commitment  to  the  peace  process  and  will  translate  the \nbenefits  of  the  peace  process  into  specific  improvements  to  the \nliving conditions of the civilian population, who have suffered from \ncivil unrest for the last two decades \n \nOther benefits include improving school attendance due to better \nhealth  and  reduced  water  carrying  burdens,  especially  for  girls; \nsupporting  sustainable  economic  growth  of \ntargeted  urban \ncenters;  supporting  decentralization  efforts;  and  improving  health \nfor the general population and reduced mortality. \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  access  to  safe  water  to  about  969,000 \npeople in the cities of Batticaloa, Hambantota, Matara, Muttur and \nPolonnaruwa  and  in  the  rural  areas  of  Anuradhapura  and \nPolonnaruwa.  About  171,500  people  will  benefit  from  safe \nsanitation facilities. Upon completion of the Project, all residential, \ncommercial,  industrial,  and  institutional  consumers  in  project \nurban areas will receive 24 hour water supply. In the rural areas, \n85%  of  the  population  will  have  access  to  safe  drinking water by \nproject  completion.  Tariffs  and  connection  fees  have  been \ncalculated to be affordable by potential consumers; thus, assuring \nan optimum rate of connection and targeting of the poor. \n \nAt a macro level, 74% of the capital investment of the Project will \nbenefit the poor rural population in the north central province and \nurban  population  in  the  northeast  region.  Poverty  in  the  north \ncentral region is at least 8% higher than the national average and \nthe  incidence  of  poverty  is  even  higher  for  targeted  rural \nbeneficiaries. Due to civil conflict, no official statistics exist for the \nurban population of the northeast project towns, but are likely far \ngreater than in the other areas of the district. \n \n\nProject Benefits and \n  Beneficiaries \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f vi \n\n \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\nThe Project assumes (i) a stable political environment and positive \neconomic growth in Sri Lanka; (ii) continuing Government support \nto the Project, in the form of timely procurement and availability of \nfunds,  and  support  to  the  decentralization  process;  and  (iii) \nindependent  regulation  of  the  water  sector  and  the  improved \nefficiency of water service provision. Especially, it is assumed that \ntariff  setting  will  be  driven  by  financial  considerations  and  that  it \nwill  be  independent  of  political  influence,  to  achieve  adequate \nlevels of project cost recovery and proper asset management. \n \nIt is assumed that rural communities will demand the improvement \nof  water  infrastructure  in  their  communities  and  will  be  willing  to \ncontribute up to 20% of the capital investment and to take over the \noperation and maintenance of the schemes. \n \nDisruption of the peace process may delay project implementation \nin Batticaloa and Muttur.  Weak political support for sector reforms \nwould impede the implementation of the strategies to improve the \noperational  and  financial  efficiency  of  NWSDB  and  other  service \nproviders. \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  Secondary  Towns  and  Rural \nCommunity-Based Water Supply and Sanitation Project.  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n \nIn  its  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  the  Government  states  that  \"the  provision  of  safe \n2. \ndrinking water, and adequate sewage and sanitation systems, is frequently cited as the single, \nhighest  social  service  priority  by  poor  households\u201d1 and it identifies access to safe water and \nappropriate  sanitation  as  one  of  its  priorities.  Section  III  of  the  2001  Millenium  Goals  includes \nhalving, by 2015, the proportion of people who are unable to reach or afford safe drinking water. \nIt also identifies, as one of the main strategies increased investment in the water and sanitation \nsectors.2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country  strategy  for  the  social  sectors \nemphasizes  the  development  of  adequate  infrastructure  and  services  in  urban  areas  outside \nColombo. 3 \n \n3. \nProvision  for  water  supply  and  sanitation  in  Sri  Lanka  has  improved  during  the  last  15 \nyears.  During  this  period,  ADB  has  been  a  constant  partner  in  the  sector.  However,  the \nrequirements  for  potable  drinking  water  and  sanitation  have  exceeded  the  Government's \ninstitutional  and  financial  capacity.  At  present,  piped  water  service  is  only  available  to  29%  of \nthe  population,  mostly  in  urban  areas.  In  rural  areas,  supply  coverage  is  only  57%.  The \nGovernment estimates that the investment requirements in the water sector will be as much as \n$1.125 million during the 2001\u20132010 period.  \n \n4. \nFinally,  with  the  progress  of  the  peace  process,  Sri  Lanka  faces  the  challenge  of \nreconstruction  efforts,  including  improving  the  access  to  water  and  sanitation  in  areas  of  the \ncountry  where  no  investment  in  basic  infrastructure  has  taken  place  in  the  last  20  years.  The \nProject  will  contribute  to  these  efforts  by  providing  piped  water  to  major  urban  centers  in  the \nnortheast. \n \nA. \n \n5. \nIn  April  2002,  the  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  approved  a  tariff  increase  that  allows  the \nNational  Water  Supply  and  Drainage  Board  (NWSDB)  to  finance  operation  and  maintenance \n(O&M) and debt service from tariffs.4 And during the last 5 years, a number of activities such as \nmeter reading and billing and collection have been out-sourced to the private sector. To reduce \npersonnel ratios, no new staff have been hired. NWSDB is now in a better position to take over \nthe O&M and rehabilitation of existing urban schemes, and it has gained significant experience \nwith implementing participatory approaches in rural communities (which has proved to be more \n                                                 \n1\n  ADB. 2002.

Road Map Towards the Implementation of the United Nations Millenium Declaration. Report \n\nof the Secretary-General. \nIn 2000, the Government of Sri Lanka requested ADB assistance to prepare a water supply and sanitation project. \nIn  December  2000,  a  $1  million  technical  assistance  (TA3587-SRI:  Secondary  Towns  Water  Supply  Sanitation \nProject) was approved and the consultants (Coffey MPW et. al.), mobilized on 15 May 2001. \nIn doing so, the Government has complied with Loan Covenants 13.a and 13c of L1575-SRI: ADB. 1997.  Third \nWater Supply and Sanitation (Sector). Manila. A detailed review of these covenants is included as Supplementary \nAppendix A. \n\n3\n \n\n4\n \n\n \n\n\f 2 \n\n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nsustainable than top-down approaches). \n \n6. \nHowever, more progress is needed. To improve the sector\u2019s performance, the following \nreforms should be implemented: (i) improving the operational efficiency and self-financing ratios \nof water schemes, (ii) decentralizing to local governments and community-based organizations \n(CBOs)  the  responsibility  for  small  schemes,  (iii)  increasing  the  participation  of  the  private \nsector, and (iv) creating an independent regulatory structure. The project framework is shown in \nAppendix 1, and a detailed discussion of the policy environment and ongoing sector reforms is \nincluded in Appendix 2. \n \nB. \n \nWhere no piped systems exist, most people rely on groundwater for drinking purposes. \n7. \nAlthough  groundwater  quality  in  most  parts  of  the  country  is  good  and  relatively  constant \nthroughout  the  year,  biological  contamination,  high  levels  of  fluoride,  and  salinity  intrusion  in \nwells and water intakes is a common problem in the project areas. In addition, urban growth has \nincreased  pressure  on  the  already  scarce  groundwater  resources,  making  the  need  for  piped \nwater  supply  more  urgent.  NWSDB  is  mainly  responsible  for  water  supply  in  Sri  Lanka  and \nmanages 181 piped water schemes. Budgetary support for construction of new piped schemes \nis limited and NWSDB does not have the capacity to finance new investments through tariffs. As \na result, the sector depends on external funding to increase coverage (Appendix 3 describes the \nexisting external assistance in the sector). \n \n8. \nThe main problems faced by the sector in the delivery of water and sanitation are its low \nself-financing ratios, poor asset management, and high production costs. The underlying causes \nof  these  problems  are  the  lack  of  appropriate  management  incentives,  an  inefficient  cross-\nsubsidy structure, and an over centralized delivery of services.5 Consequently, the sector faces \npoor service levels and coverage. To address these problems, the new Government policy6 for \nthe  sector  recognizes  that  (i)  water  is  a  basic  need,  but  also  has  an  economic  value  and  that \nwithin the acknowledged limits of affordability the Government will seek full cost recovery in its \ntariff policy and phase out heavy cross-subsidies among users; (ii) eventually the mandate for \nschemes under 1,000 connections will be fully shifted to local authorities; and (iii) conditions in \nthe  sector  must  be  conducive  to  attract  private  sector  investment.  These  issues  are  currently \nbeing addressed by sector reforms and have been integrated in the proposed Project. \n \n9. \nLessons learned from previous water projects in Sri Lanka indicate  the need to improve \nthe  financial  sustainability  of  NWSDB,  to  enhance  the  involvement  of  beneficiaries in planning \nand  implementation,  to  improve  water  demand  management,  and  to  improve  the  efficiency  of \nservice  delivery.7  The  reviews  of  ADB's  projects  stressed  the  need  for  increasing  community \ninvolvement,  setting  up  professional  project  management  units  (PMUs),  and  decentralizing \noperations.8  The  Government  has  also  reviewed  external  assistance  to  the  sector  and  has \nrecommended  a  \"two-pronged\u201d  strategy  involving  large-scale  system  expansion  (for  urban \nschemes) and a vast number of small-scale community improvement initiatives, to bring better \nwater supply and sanitation services to poor communities.  \n\n                                                 \n5  The challenges faced by the rural and urban sectors differ and are analyzed in more detailed in Appendix 2. \n6  Government of Sri Lanka. 2002.

The Project will address the key problems in the sector by including in \nthe  Project  design  (i)  local  government  and  community  participation  in  the  planning  and \nimplementation of rural projects, with communities contributing up to 20% of the capital cost and \nbecoming  owners  of  the  assets;  (ii)  delegation  of  O&M  for  rural  schemes  to  CBOs  and  a \nstrategy  to  improve  operational  efficiency  of  NWSDB;  (iii)  implementation  of  a  strategy  to \nimprove the financial sustainability of NWSDB; and (iv) public awareness campaigns to educate \nconsumers  about  water  as  a  scarce  resource  and  the  relationship  between  water,  sanitation, \nand  health;  and  the  new  institutions  in  the  sector.  In  addition,  ADB  has  proposed  advisory \ntechnical  assistance  to  support  the  development  of  water  sector  regulation  under  the  Public \nUtilities  Commission.  Appendix  4  describes  in  detail  how  the  Project  design  has  incorporated \nthese lessons. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nObjective \n\n \nA. \n \n11. \nIn  March  2002,  the  Government  and  ADB  signed  a  poverty  reduction  partnership \nagreement,  which  highlighted  the  access  to  safe  water  supply  and  sanitation  as  a  key \ndimension in reducing poverty for Sri Lanka. The goal of the Project is to reduce the incidence \nof waterborne diseases in the beneficiary populations and to reduce the level of resources (both \ncash  and  time)  that  targeted  households  spend  in  acquiring  water  for  their  basic  needs.  The \nProject  will  also  increase  the  capacity  of  water  sector  institutions  to  operate,  maintain,  and \naugment existing water schemes and to invest in new water schemes in rural and urban areas. \n \n12. \nThe objective of the Project is to deliver safe water to approximately 969,000 people and \nprovide sanitation to 171,500 people. The Project will benefit people living in the rural areas of \nAnuradhapura  and  Polonnaruwa  districts  in  the  North  Central  Province  and  in  the  towns  of \nBatticaloa,  Hambantota,  Matara,  Muttur,  and  Polonnaruwa.  The  Project  will  also  increase  the \nfinancial and institutional sustainability of NWSDB and the institutional capacity of the provincial \ncouncils, Pradeshiya Sabhas, and CBOs participating in the Project. \n \nB. \n \n13. \nThe  project  components  are  (i)  provision  of  urban  water  supply  and  sanitation  in  five \nurban  centers  (the  urban  component);  (ii)  provision  of  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation  in  two \ndistricts of the North Central Province (the rural component); and (iii) institutional strengthening \nand public awareness campaigns (the institutional strengthening component).  \n \n \n \n14. \nThe  urban  component  (Table  1)  will  (i)  provide  new  piped  water  supply  systems  and \nimprovement  of  drainage  in  the  towns  of  Batticaloa  and  Muttur,  (ii)  expand  the  existing  water \nsupply systems in the towns of Polonnaruwa and Hambantota, (iii) provide for construction of a \nsalinity barrier at the intake in Matara to prevent saline intrusion during dry periods, (iv) provide \nwastewater  collection  and  treatment  for  Batticaloa  Hospital,  and  (v)  improve  drainage  in  the \nmost densely populated areas of Batticaloa and Muttur. Local authorities will be engaged by the \nPMU in the implementation of the drainage subcomponent. The administrative divisions, where \ndrainage will be undertaken,  will be selected based on population density and state of existing \nfacilities.  \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nUrban Component \n\n1. \n\n \n\n\f 4 \n\n \n\nTable 1: Urban Subcomponents \n\nTown \nBatticaloa \n\nSubcomponent \na.

An estimated 322,000 people will be provided \nwith  safe  water  and  138,000  with  latrines.  Subprojects  will  be  identified  during  project \nimplementation based on criteria approved by ADB. Subproject selection combines elements of \nboth a poverty-targeted and a demand-responsive approach. Poor and underserved areas will \nbe  identified  in  each  local  government  based  on  transparent  criteria.  The  administrative \ndivisions  that  exhibit  the  highest  incidence  of  poverty  and  lack  of  water  supply,  and  that  are \ninterested and willing to contribute 20% of the investment costs and take responsibility for the \nO&M  of  the  facilities,  will  be  invited  to  apply  for  assistance.  After  counterpart  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) and local government technical officers have provided initial training and \ninformation  regarding  source  availability,  initial  capital  investment,  and  expected  O&M  cost  for \neach option, the beneficiaries themselves will choose the type of system they want to implement \nin  their  community.  Technologies  selected  should  be  simple  and  appropriate,  have  affordable \ncapital  cost,  and  be  within  the  community\u2019s  capability  for  O&M  management.  Technologies \nrecognized  as  appropriate  for  rural  water  supply  are  tubewells  with hand pumps, shallow dug \nwells,  pipe-borne  water  supply  schemes  (gravity  or  pumping),  rainwater  harvesting,  and \nhousehold  water  treatment  technologies.  CBOs  will  contribute  a  minimum  of  20%  of  the \nconstruction  cost,  or  the  entire  unskilled  labor  component,  whichever  is  higher.  Further,  the \nproject contribution per household is limited to a ceiling that will be calculated depending on the \nwater supply technology.  \n \n16. \nThe  rural  component  focuses  on  the  project  beneficiaries  developing  the  ownership of \nthe  Project.  The  beneficiaries  will  organize  into  CBOs  and  participate  actively  in  the  project \ndesign and implementation. The component includes institutional support for the North Central \nProvincial Council and for participating Pradeshiya Sabhas and CBOs to develop their capacity \n\n\f5\n \n\nto implement, operate, and maintain water supply schemes and sanitation facilities and assure \nthe sustainability of water supply after project completion.  \n \n\n3. \n\nInstitutional Strengthening \n\nThe  institutional  strengthening  component  will  support  specific  strategies  to  improve \nthree \n\nfinancial  management  and  service  delivery.  This  component  has \n\n \n17. \nNWSDB\u2019s \nsubcomponents. \n \n\na. \n\nNational Public Awareness and Education Campaign \n\n \n18. \nThe  Project  will  support  NWSDB  in  developing  and  implementing  a  national  strategy \nfocusing  on  educating  and  raising  awareness  on  the  need  to  improve  water  demand \nmanagement  and  conservation,  and  improving  public  knowledge  of  the  new  National  Water \nSupply and Sanitation Policy. Special attention will be given to ongoing changes in the sector, \nincluding the existence of new service providers, private sector participation, the need for tariffs \nto reflect real cost, and the role of the public utilities commission in monitoring service standards \nand  protecting  consumers  rights.  The  Project  will  also  support  project  implementation  units \n(PIUs) under the urban component and Pradeshiya Sabha implementation units (PSIUs) under \nthe rural component to run project-specific awareness campaigns on hygiene and sanitation. \n \n\nb. \n\nNWSDB Financial and Operational Improvement Support  \n\n \n19. \nThe Project will help NWSDB improve its management, especially financial management \nand  regional  operations  within  the  context  of  the  recent  sector  reforms  and  policies,  including \nthe  establishment  of  a  public  utilities  commission,  the  participation  of  private  operators  in  the \nsector, and the decentralization of the provision of water to local authorities.  \n \nNWSDB  will  prepare  a  strategy  to  improve  its  financial  management  and  operations, \n20. \nwith a detailed schedule and financial plan, to be submitted to ADB for approval within 3 months \nof  loan  effectiveness.  The  strategy  will  include  detailed  designs  for  the  implementation  of  the \nfollowing:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nNWSDB will implement a corporate strategy to improve (among others) financial \nplanning  and  resource  allocation  to  adapt  to  the  current  reforms  in  the  sector, \nwith emphasis in reduction of tariff cross-subsidies, introduction of performance-\nbased  financial  incentives  to  regional  centers,  and  appropriate  management  of \nexisting  assets.  The  strategy  is  to  be  implemented  within  2  years  of  loan \neffectiveness. \nNWSDB will implement its strategy and action plan to address audit findings and \nKPMG  International9  accounting  and  financial  management  recommendations \nagreed  on  13  September  2002.  These  are  to  be  implemented  within  1  year  of \nloan effectiveness. \nNWSDB  will  implement,  within  2  years  of  loan  effectiveness,  an  action  plan  to \nimprove  operational  performance  including  cubic  meters  billed,  collection rates, \naging of accounts receivable, staff to connection ratio, kilowatt-hours of electricity \nused, and reduction of establishment expenses.  \nNWSDB  will  complete  an  asset  registry  in  all  regional  (outside  of  Greater \n\n                                                 \n9   ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance for the Accounting  Review of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board. \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n\f 6 \n\n(v) \n\n \n\nColombo)  water  supply  schemes  with  more  than  10,000  connections,  within  2 \nyears of loan effectiveness. \nThe  strategy  will  identify  water  schemes  with  less  than  1,000  connections  for \nrehabilitation  and  eventual  transfer  to  local  government  institutions,  the  private \nsector, and/or CBOs within 4 years of loan effectiveness. The strategy will focus \non  improving  the  efficiency  of  the  schemes  so  they  can  be  profitable  and  on \ntraining of the Pradeshiya Sabhas, private sector entities, and/or CBOs for taking \nover  the  schemes.  The  NWSDB  will  agree  with  a  local  authority,  the  private \nsector, or CBOs to take responsibility for the assets and O&M, prior to disbursing \nproject  funds  for  scheme-specific  investments  (physical  works  and  O&M \ntraining).  The  implementation  will  be  completed  within  4  years  of  loan \neffectiveness.  Any  physical  works  implemented  under  this  subproject  will  follow \nGovernment  and  ADB  guidelines,  including  guidelines  on  environment,  land \nacquisition, and resettlement. \n\n \n21. \nThe  performance  of  NWSDB  will  be  measured  in  relation  to the specific components. \nTarget indicators have been defined in Appendix 2, Table A2.2, and the Government, NWSDB, \nand ADB will monitor performance of this component according to these targets. \n \n\nc. \n\nTraining \n\nSpecial Features \n\n \n22.  Water  supply  system  operators  in  the district offices and NWSDB, technical officers in \nthe  Pradeshiya  Sabhas,  and  CBOs  will  be  trained  during  project  implementation.  Under  the \nurban  component,  contractors\u2019  obligations  will  include  training  of  NWSDB  staff  in  the  O&M  of \nthe new facilities. The training will be carried out in conjunction with the physical implementation \nof  the  Project.  The  rural  component  will  provide  training  to  strengthen  CBOs\u2019  capacity  to \nparticipate  in  community  development.  This  training  will  be  undertaken  by  NGOs.  In  addition, \nthe  institutional  strengthening  component  will  provide  resources  for  management  training  of \nNWSDB staff. NWSDB will submit for ADB's concurrence a 5-year strategic training plan within \n3  months  of  fielding  of  the  two  project  management  consultants  and  an  annual  training  plan \nprior  to  31  October  of  each  year.  The  plan  will  specify  training  institutions,  methodologies, \ntargeted population, and expected outputs. As per the gender action plan, 20% of the trainees \nwill be women. \n \nC. \n \nSupport for the Peace Process.  Major physical works for Batticaloa and Muttur water \n23. \nsupply  systems  will  take  place  in  conflict  affected  areas.  During  project  preparation,  the \nGovernment  of  Sri  Lanka  and  the  local  community  representatives  were  consulted  to  obtain \ntheir  consensus  and  support  for  the  project.  Both  the  Government  and  the  local  community \nbelieve  that  construction  of  badly  needed  water  supply  and  sanitation  in  these  areas  can \npromote the peace process.  \n \n24. \nEthnic  Diversity.  Ethnicity  has  been  integrated  in  project  design,  with  all  major  ethnic \ngroups  in  Sri  Lanka  significantly  represented  among  the  beneficiary  population.  Within \nsubcomponents,  attention  was  made  to  include  all  ethnic  groups  within  the  project  area  so \nbenefits will accrue equally to all groups residing in the project towns.  \n \nTargeting the Poor.  Mechanisms  to  ensure  that  the  project  benefits  will  accrue  to  the \n25. \npoorest  of  the  poor  include  the  following:  (i)  populations  that  cannot  afford  a  connection  will \nhave access to safe water through metered public stand posts to be provided by the Project; (ii) \n\n\f7\n \n\ncontinuation  of  the  financial  mechanisms  provided  by  NWSDB  to  subsidized  connection  fees \nand  facilitate  initial  payment  to  recipients  of  the  government\u2019s  social  assistance  program \n(Samurdhi);  and  (iii)  tariff  structure  is  designed  to  provide  affordable  prices  for  basic \nconsumption10  while  full  cost  recovery  prices  apply  only  to  consumption  above  100  liters  per \nperson  per  day.  See  Appendix  5,  Poverty  Reduction  and  Social  Development  Strategy,  for  a \ndetailed discussion of the Project's social impacts. \n \n26. \nDemand-Driven and Participatory Approach through NGOs.  The rural component is \nbased  in  a  demand-driven  participatory  approach  facilitated  by  NGOs  where  the beneficiaries \norganize in CBOs and collectively take responsibility for the subprojects implementation and the \nO&M of water systems. The counterpart NGOs work with the communities to raise awareness \nand introduce the project methodology. Communities are required to show their commitment by \nproviding self-assessment forms and contributing to 20% of the capital cost of the Project. The \nbeneficiaries decide on the type of technology for the schemes and, with the assistance of the \nproject staff, they take responsibility for designing and implementing the schemes. The Project \nprovides  training  and  practical  experience  to  the  beneficiaries  in  project  and  financial \nmanagement,  which  will  provide  communities  with  the  skills  to  initiate  other  community \nimprovements. \n \n27. \nSupport to Decentralization.  The Project supports decentralization of the provision of \nservices to local governments, private providers, and civil society. The rural component will be \nimplemented by CBOs, and facilitated by NGOs and Pradeshiya Sabhas. The latest will be the \nPIUs  for  the  rural  component  and  Pradeshiya  Sabhas  will  receive  training  and  assistance  to \ndevelop their technical knowledge of rural water schemes, to improve their project management \nand  monitoring  skills  and  to  enhance  their  capacity  to  work  with  NGOs  and  CBOs  using \nparticipatory  demand-driven  approaches.  The  institutional  component  will  assist  NWSDB  to \ntransfer the management of small schemes to local governments, CBOs, or the private sector \nand requires the out-sourcing to the private sector of noncore activities for all new schemes.  \n \n28. \nPolicy.  The  Project  supports  ongoing  policy  reforms  and  provides  the  resources  for \nNWSDB to adapt to its new role in the sector. The implementation of the corporate management \nstrategy,  the  financial  strategy,  and  the  operational  strategy  under  the  institutional  component \nwill allow NWSDB to continue to provide services in the sector under the new policy framework, \nwhich  includes  the  participation  of  the  private  sector,  introduction  of  independent  regulation \nunder the public utilities commission, and decentralization to local governments. \n \nResettlement. The Project will require the permanent acquisition of 10.0 hectares (ha) \n29. \nof land, of which 1.1 ha are owned by NWSDB, 7.5 ha are owned by the Government, and 1.4 \nha are privately owned. Acquisition of the identified land will not result in loss of livelihoods or \ncommunity  resources  and  it  will  affect  seven  people.  A  short  resettlement  plan  has  been \ndiscussed  with  the  affected  people  and  is  a  public  document  in  ADB\u2019s  web  page.    The \nconstruction of the Batticaloa scheme requires raising the Unnichchai tank bund to increase raw \nwater availability for domestic consumption.  During construction works, it may be necessary to \nlower the tank water level to below dead water level.  This may deprive a source of livelihood for \none dry season to 1,898 farmers and 2,200 wage laborers that depend on the Unnichchai tank \nfor irrigation.  It may also deprive 177 fishermen of income because they will not be able to fish \nfor  1  year.  If  construction  activities  affect  irrigation,  a  plan  has  been  developed  to  provide  fair \ncompensation  to  any  person  that  temporarily  may  lose  all  or  part  of  its  income  due  to  the \nproject, as defined under Sri Lanka\u2019s National Involuntary Resettlement Policy and ADB's Policy \n\n                                                 \n10  Government of Sri Lanka Water Policy defines basic consumption as 100 liters per capita per day. \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\n \n\nCost Estimates \n\non Involuntary Resettlement. Appendix 6 contains a summary of the short resettlement plans for \nland acquisition and temporary loss of income.   \n \nD. \n \n30. \nThe total cost of the Project, including physical and price contingencies, and taxes and \nduties, is estimated at $86.3 million equivalent. The cost estimates are summarized in Table 2. \nDetailed cost estimates are found in Appendix 7. \n \n\nTable 2: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n \n\nComponent \n\nBase Cost \nComponent 1:  Urban Water Supply & Sanitation \nComponent 2:  Rural Water Supply & Sanitation \nComponent 3:  Institutional Strengthening \nProject Management \nSubtotal (A) \n\nA. \n\n \n \nB. \n \n \n \n \nC. \n \nD. \n \n \n \n \n\nContingencies \n1.

ADB will finance approximately 70% of the project costs. ADB financing will be used \nto  finance  costs  relating  to  civil  works,  procurement  of  vehicles,  office  equipment,  consulting \nservices, and training and public awareness and education campaigns, but will exclude salaries \nof project counterpart staff, rental of office space, and taxes and duties. The Government and \ncommunity will provide $22.5 million and $3.6 million equivalent, respectively (26% and 4% of \ntotal  costs).  The  financing  of  the  local  currency  cost  by  ADB  is  justified  on  the  basis  of  social \nbenefits  accruing  from  the  Project  and  its  positive  environmental  impact. The summary of the \nfinancing plan is in Table 3. \n \n\n\f9\n \n\nTable 3: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \n\n \nSource \n \nAsian Development Bank  \nGovernment of Sri Lanka \nCommunity \nTotal \n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nForeign \nExchange \n \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n \n\n \n\nTotal Cost  Percent \n\n19.6 \n0 \n0 \n19.6 \n\n40.7 \n23.0 \n3.1 \n66.8 \n\n \n\n \n\n60.3 \n23.0 \n3.1 \n86.4 \n\n \n\n(%) \n \n\n70 \n27 \n3 \n100 \n\n \n32. \nThe loan will have a 32 year term, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest \ncharge  of  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  The \ncommunity contribution corresponds to the rural component, and is equal to 20% of the capital \ncost up to a defined limit for each technical option.  \n \n33. \nThe  financial  assessment  was  undertaken  to  assess  the  viability  of  the  Project, \nunderstood  as  the  capacity  of  each  subcomponent  to  generate  sufficient  revenues  to  cover \ncapital  and  operating  costs  and  generate  rates  of  return  that  meet  or  exceed  the  weighted \naverage  cost  of  capital  (WACC).  Revenues  are  those  derived  from  water  tariffs  and  other \nrelated charges directly attributable to the Project. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for \neach project town ranges between 5.2% and 9.9% and the FIRR for the project overall is 7.5%. \nAll  exceed  the  WACC  estimated  at  0.78%  for  the four towns. The sensitivity of the FIRR was \ntested  for  increases  in  capital  cost,  increases  in  O&M  cost,  and  reduction  in  overall  revenues. \nThe  FIRR  is  most  sensitive  to  a  reduction  in  incremental  revenues  derived  from  water  tariffs; \nhowever,  the  FIRR  is  sufficiently  robust  and  exceeds  the  WACC  following  the  sensitivity \nanalysis. See Appendix 8 for a detailed discussion of the financial analysis. \n \n34. \nThe  Government  will  make  the  proceeds  of  the  proposed  loan  available  to  NWSDB \nthrough  a  subsidiary  financing  agreement  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  financial  analysis  has \nassumed  current  lending  agreements  between  the  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  and  NWSDB, \nwhich  are  expected  to  be  maintained.  Of  funding  for  water  supply  schemes  in  Pradeshiya \nSabhas, 85% will be  made available to NWSDB as a grant and 15% as a loan; for urban local \nauthorities, 50% as a grant and 50% as a loan; and for rural communities, 100% as a grant. In \neach case, financing will be at the rate of 10% per annum and the repayment period will be 24 \nyears with a grace period of 8 years. \n \n35. \nThe Project is economically viable. The estimated economic internal rate of return for the \nurban component varies from 12.7% to 17.2% and the projected economic internal rate of return \nfor the rural component is 13%. Benefits were calculated taking into account the savings in time \nand  cash  currently  used  to  access  safe  water  and  sanitation.  Unquantifiable  benefits  such  as \nhealth have not been included in the analysis but will accrue in the form of gains in productive \ndays  for  the  economically  active  population  and  lower  medical  expenses  for  beneficiaries  and \nfor Government's public health institutions. The sensitivity of the results was tested for different \ntimes spent collecting water, rates of growth in real household incomes, and levels of O&M cost; \nlower cross-subsidies from nondomestic water consumption; and higher construction works and \nassumed consumption. A detailed economic analysis is in Appendix 9. \n \n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\nF. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\nProject Manage ment \n\n1. \n \nNWSDB, under the Ministry of Housing and Plantation Infrastructure (MH&PI), will be the \n36. \nexecuting agency. A PMU will be established in Colombo under NWSDB, to support the Project. \nPIUs  will  be  established  in  each  of  the  project  towns  under  the  urban  component,  and  PSIUs \nand technical support units will be established under the rural component. A provincial project \ncoordinating  committee  will  be  established  in  the  North  Central  Provincial  Council  to  provide \ncoordination for the rural PSIUs. A national steering committee (NSC) chaired by the secretary, \nMH&PI, who will be the project coordinator will guide the PMU and make all policy and strategic \ndecisions.  Complementary  project  coordinating  committees  will  be  established  at  the  district, \ndivisional,  and  village  levels.  The  Government  will  call  for  a  coordination  meeting  of  funding \norganizations to the water sector at least once a year to  assure coordination of sector reforms \nand  interventions  supported  by  external  funds  and  to  assure  exchange  of  information. \nImplementation responsibilities of each institution and a flow chart of the structure are included \nin Appendix 10. \n \n37. \nThe  PMU  will  be  established  in  the  NWSDB\u2019s  Colombo  office.  An  experienced  project \ndirector will be appointed to head the PMU. A core team of NWSDB employees will assist the \nproject director. They will be supported by a project management consulting team headed by a \nteam  leader  (international)  and  deputy  team  leader  (domestic).  A  separate  design  and \nsupervision team of consultants will assist in detailed design and construction supervision of the \nurban  water  supply  components.  PIUs  will  be  established  under  the  district  officers  of  the \nNWSDB  for  each  of  the  four  urban  water  supply  subcomponents.  A  separate  irrigation \ndepartment PIU will be established under the Irrigation Department to implement the Unnichchai \ntank bund raising subcomponent. Under the rural component, PSIUs will be established in the \nparticipating  Pradeshiya  Sabhas,  which  will  each  employ  full  time  one technical officer for the \nduration  of  the  Project.  The  technical  support  units  at  Polonnaruwa  and  Anuradhapura  will  be \nsupported by a team of consultants specializing in rural water supply, community participation, \nand institutional capacity building.  The  Rural  Water  Supply  section  of  NWSDB  will  act  as  the \ntechnical advisory unit for the rural component and will provide technical support to the technical \nsupport units and PSIUs. The Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Division in MH&PI will provide \npolicy  guidance  to  PMU,  provincial  project  coordinating  committee,  project  support  units,  and \nPSIUs, and will monitor policy implementation.  \n \nThe  NSC,  chaired  by  the  secretary,  MH&PI  will  provide  overall  coordination  and \n38. \nguidance for the Project.11 During the project implementation, the NSC will be responsible for (i) \ndealing  with  policy  matters  as  they  arise,  and  (ii)  coordinating  with  other  ministries  and \nagencies. The NSC will meet at least every 3 months, or as often as necessary. In addition, a \nprovincial  coordinating  committee  will  be  established  in  North  Central  Province  for  monitoring \nand coordination purposes immediately after the effective date. \n \n39. \nThe participating Pradeshiya Sabhas, CBOs, and NGOs will (i) implement instructions in \nthe manuals developed under the Third Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project12 when they \n                                                 \n11  The  National  Steering  Committee  will  be  chaired  by  the  secretary,  MH&PI  and  will  include  representatives  from \nNWSDB,  Ministry  of  Policy  Development  and  Planning,  Ministry  of  Irrigation,  Ministry  of  Health,  Ministry  of \nProvincial Councils and Local Government, Chief Secretary of North Central Province, line agencies under these \nministries, and others. \n\n12  The  Water  Supply  Management  Manual  for  Pradeshiya  Sabhas  and the  Water Supply Management Manual for \n\nCBOs. \n\n\f11\n \n\nhave  been  approved  by  the  Rural  Water  Supply  Division  of  the  MH&PI,  and  (ii)  institute  and \ncomply  with  the  by-laws  and  resolutions  for  the  management  of  rural  water supply developed \nunder  the  Third  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Project  when  they  have  been  approved  by  the \nprovincial councils and other concerned local authorities. The Project will ensure that CBOs and \nPradeshiya Sabhas enter into agreements relating to management, regulation, and distribution \nof water. \n \n40. \nThe PMU will undertake central procurement for the urban and institutional components, \nincluding  for  the  capacity  building  component  and  the  packages  for  materials  and  equipment. \nCounterpart funds will be channeled to the PlUs through regular budgetary allocations, including \nappropriate  allocations  for  taxes  and  duties.  For  the  rural  component,  the  funds  will  be \nchanneled from the PMU to the project support unit in Anuradhapura, to the PSIUs, and then to \nthe  CBOs  and  NGOs  involved  in  the  implementation.13  CBOs  will  be  responsible  for  the \nprocuring supplies for their own subprojects. Costs will be recovered from the consumers in the \nform of tariff charges, connection fees, and capital cost contributions.  \n \nAt the start of the Project, the PMU will help the PIUs and the PSIUs formulate budgets \n41. \nfor all activities, with estimates for each year of project implementation. These budgets will be \nreviewed  and  updated  every  6  months  and  approved  by  the  PMU  before  implementation. \nExpenditures  will  be  recorded  at  source  by  the  implementing  agencies,  PlUs,  PSIUs,  district \nPMUs, and PMU. The PMU will approve and supervise all drawdown arrangements. The PMU \nwill  be  responsible  for  compiling  project  expenditures  based  on  its  own  expenditures  and  the \nreports  of  expenditures  submitted  by  the  PlUs,  PSIUs,  and  project  support  units.  It  will  report \nproject  expenditures  to  NWSDB,  with  copies  to  ADB,  on  a  monthly  basis,  with  quarterly  and \nannual summaries.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  6  years  starting  in  March  2003  and  ending  in \n42. \nMarch  2009.  Detailed  feasibility  and  engineering  design  will  commence  1  year  after  loan \neffectiveness  and  tendering  of  contracts  will  commence  21  months  after  loan  effectiveness. \nConstruction  of  the  urban  water  supply  and  distribution  facilities  included  in  the  urban \ncomponent will begin 2 years and 9 months after loan effectiveness and be completed within 2.5 \nyears.  All  components  will  be  implemented  in  the  five  urban  cities  simultaneously.  In  the  rural \ncomponent,  review  of  guidelines,  public  awareness,  and  community  mobilization  work  will \nprecede the physical implementation of the subprojects. The project implementation schedule is \nincluded in Appendix 10. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \nGoods and services financed by the ADB loan will be procured in accordance with ADB's \n43. \nGuidelines for Procurement and the Government\u2019s procurement procedures acceptable to ADB. \nUrban  water  supply  schemes  will  be  combined  into  design,  supervision,  and  supply  and \nconstruction packages for international competitive bidding and local competitive bidding (LCB). \nDue  to  preceding  ADB  projects  in  the  water  sector  in  Sri  Lanka,  the  capacity  of  local \ncontractors,  and  the  expected  limited  interest  of  international  contractors  to  work  in  difficulty \nareas,  civil  works  contracts  valued  over  $2  million  equivalent  and  equipment  contracts  valued \nover  $500,000  equivalent  will  be  undertaken  through  international  competitive  bidding \nprocedures. Civil works contracts valued at $2 million equivalent or less will be carried out under \n\n                                                 \n13  The PIUs must have qualified for imprest accounts under the disbursement arrangements. \n\n \n\n\f 12 \n\n \n\nLCB  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  and  in  accordance  with  Government  regulations. \nEquipment  packages  valued  at  $500,000  equivalent  or  less  will  be  procured  following \ninternational  shopping  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Supply  contracts  (for  goods)  valued  at \n$100,000  and  less  could  be  procured  following  LCB  or  direct  purchase  procedures.  All \nconstruction  works  for  the  rural  component  are  expected  to  be  valued  at  less  than  $1  million \nequivalent and therefore to be procured through LCB, or, in the case of contracts valued at less \nthan  SLRs2  million  (approximately  $20,000)  equivalent,  by  the  CBOs  through  procedures  for \ncommunity  participation  in  procurement  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  proposed  procurement \npackages are in Appendix 11. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \nA  total  of  1,140  person-months  of  consulting  services  are  estimated,  of  which  120  are \n44. \ninternational  and  1,020  are  local.  For  project  management,  711  person-months of consulting \nservices will be required to support the PMUs, PIUs, PSIUs, project support units, and provincial \nproject  coordinating  committees.  Consulting  services  for  detailed  design  and  construction \nsupervision  for  the  urban  component,  including  the  Unnichchai  Tank,  will  be  contracted  out \nseparately  and  536  person-months  are  estimated  to  be  required.  International  consultants  will \nbe  involved  in  both  project  management  and  in  detailed  design  and  construction  supervision \nactivities. The international consultants in the PMU will provide advice on the best international \npractices  to  NWSDB  for  designing  strategies  to  implement  the  institutional  strengthening \ncomponent. For the rural component, the Pradeshiya Sabhas will contract with suitable NGOs to \nbe partner organizations and work with the CBOs. Summary terms of reference for all consulting \nservices are provided in Appendix 12. Consultant firms financed under the loan will be recruited \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants by Asian Development Bank \nand its Borrowers using the quality- and cost-based selection method and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants.  \n \n5. \n \n45. \nThe  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  disbursement  projections,  requesting \nbudgetary allocations for the counterpart funds, collecting supporting documents, and preparing \nwithdrawal applications and sending them to ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook.  To  facilitate  the  timely  release  of  loan  proceeds  and  counterpart  funds  and  to \nexpedite  project  implementation,  the  Government  will,  immediately  after  loan  effectiveness, \nopen and maintain a project imprest account with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka for NWSDB, to \nbe  managed  by  the  PMU.  The  total  advances  to  the  imprest  account,  including  the  initial \nadvance,  will  not  at  any  time  exceed  estimated  ADB-financed  expenditures  for  the  next  6 \nmonths or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. The ceiling of the imprest  account will \nbe  $2  million.  To  facilitate  implementation  of  the  Project  and,  with  respect  to  the  rural \ncomponent,  in  keeping  with  the  Government\u2019s  Rural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Policy  of \ndecentralization, second generation imprest accounts will be established at the Central Bank of \nSri Lanka for the technical support units and for the district office of NWSDB at Anuradhapura. \nSubject to the approval of ADB based on the development of adequate financial and accounting \ncontrols in the Pradeshiya Sabhas, third generation imprest accounts to receive funds from the \nrural component second-generation imprest accounts may be established at any bank approved \nby  the  Central  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  for  each  PSIU.  The  initial  ceiling  of  the  second  and  third \nimprest accounts will be $200,000 equivalent and $20,000 equivalent, respectively. Because the \nPradeshiya  Sabhas  have  only  limited  experience  with  implementing  externally  financed \ninvestment  projects,  the  third  generation  imprest  accounts  will  be  established  in  PSIUs  only \nafter  the  fielding  of  the  project-financed  financial  management  consultants.  The  PMU  will  be \n\n\f13\n \n\nresponsible  for  ensuring  that  all  imprest  accounts  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished, \nand  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook,  and  with  detailed \narrangements  agreed  to  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditures \nprocedure will be used to liquidate advances from the imprest accounts.  \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n46. \nThe  Government  will  provide  ADB  with  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project \nimplementation  following  the  ADB  standard  procedures.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for \nobtaining  and  consolidating  relevant  data  from  PIUs  and  PSIUs.  The  PlUs  and  PSIUs  will \nmaintain separate project accounts, in coordination with the PMU, which will prepare the project \naccounts and related financial statements, including imprest account statements for all imprest \naccounts  and  records  of  the  statement  of  expenditures.  NWSDB  and  the  Pradeshiya  Sabhas \nwill maintain an adequate accounting system. Any PIU or PSIU for which an imprest account is \nestablished  will  agree  to  have  its  project  accounts  audited  by  NWSDB.  The  accounts  and \nstatements  of  expenditure  and  revenues  related  to  the  Project  will  be  audited  annually  by \nauditors acceptable to ADB. The annual audit will include the audit of the imprest account and \nstatement of expenditure procedure. A separate audit opinion on the use of the imprest account \nand  statement  of  expenditure  procedure  will  be  included  in  the  annual  audit  report.  Audited \nproject  subaccounts  and  financial  statements,  together  with  the  report  of  the  auditor,  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB through the PMU within 9 months after the end of each fiscal/financial year. In \naddition, the audited annual report  of NWSDB will be submitted to ADB not later than 9 months \nafter  the  close  of  each  fiscal  year  following  the  reporting  period.  The  PMU  will  also  submit  to \nADB,  within  3  months  of  the  physical  completion  of  the  Project,  a  project  completion  report \nfollowing standard ADB procedures. The PMU and project support units will have an adequate \nnumber of suitably qualified accounting staff, including a senior officer. \n \n\n7. \n\nAdvance Action  \n\n \n47. \nADB management has approved advance action for procurement of consulting services \nand civil works. The Government has been informed that approval of advance action does not \ncommit  ADB  to  finance  the  whole  or  any  part  of  the  Project  and  that  consultants  will  be \ncontracted and fielded only upon effectiveness of the loan. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \nAnnual  Operation  Plans  and  Financial  Review.  To  facilitate  project  implementation \n48. \nand decentralization of communal services, both the Government and the local governments will \nprepare by 31 December of each year an operation plan for the next fiscal year. The plan will \ninclude  (i)  proposed  budgetary  allocations  for  communal  services,  and,  specifically,  the \nallocation of sufficient counterpart funds from local and central governments and other sources \nfor  timely  project  implementation;  (ii)  status  of  policy  actions;  and  (iii)  financing  plan  for  the \nproject  activities  for  the  succeeding  year.  The  plan  will  confirm  that  the  Government  has \nallocated an adequate budget for financing project implementation and recurrent costs.  \n \n49. \nProject  Performance  Monitoring  System  The  PMU,  with  the  help  of  an  external \nindependent  monitoring  institution,  will  undertake  a  quantitative  and  qualitative  performance \nmonitoring for each project component to evaluate the delivery of the planned facilities and the \nproject  benefits  accrued.  The  PMU,  with  the  assistance  of  project-financed  consultants,  will \ndevelop comprehensive project performance monitoring system (PPMS) procedures and plans \nin accordance with ADB's standards, within 6 months after loan effectiveness. The PPMS is to \n\n \n\n\f 14 \n\n \n\nbe reviewed and approved by ADB. The PlUs will assist the independent monitoring institutions \nto carry out PPMS activities. ADB and MH&PI will agree on the performance parameters to be \nmonitored  during  the  project  inception  and  will  include  the  establishment  of  benchmarks  for \nwater supply and sanitation improvements in the project areas and sector performance. \n \n50. \nBaseline data collection will be carried out prior to the start of any construction under the \nProject and in conjunction with socioeconomic surveys and focus group discussions. It will then \ncontinue  on  a  regular  basis  during  project  implementation  until  3  months  after  project \ncompletion. The results will be presented to MH&PI and ADB independently, and incorporated \ninto the project progress and completion reports. \n \n51. \nProject Review. ADB and the Government will jointly undertake annual project reviews \nto  assess  progress,  and  a  comprehensive  midterm  review  in  the  last  quarter  of  2005.  The \nproject  review  will  follow  standard  ADB  procedures.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the \nmidterm  reviewers  are  informed  of  any  policy  or  implementation  changes  affecting  the  local \ngovernments  and  the  urban  infrastructure  sector.  If  necessary,  the  midterm  review  will \nrecommend  changes  in  design  and  implementation.  The  midterm  review  will  (i)  review  the \nscope,  design,  and  implementation  arrangements  of  the  Project;  (ii)  identify  changes  needed \nsince  project  appraisal;  (iii)  assess  implementation performance against project indicators; (iv) \nreview and establish compliance with loan covenants; and (v) identify problems and constraints \nand, if necessary, recommend changes in the design or implementation arrangements.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\n \nA. \n \n52. \nSocial.  The  Project\u2019s  targeted  unit  is  the  household,  but  because  women  are \ntraditionally  responsible  for  cooking,  cleaning,  and  taking  care  of  the  family  and  are  highly \naffected  by  problems  associated  with  water  supply,  they  will  be  the  main  beneficiaries  of  the \nProject.  The  Project  will  reduce  the  time  women  spend  fetching  water,  the  burden  of  carrying \nheavy loads, and the time spent taking care of children suffering from waterborne diseases. A \ngender  action  plan,  with  specific  targets,  will  be  implemented  to  ensure  that  at  least  50%  of \nparticipants  in  community  discussions  and  CBO  committees  are  women  and  25%  of  PIU \nmembers  are  women.  The  capacity  building  and  training  of  women  members  of  CBOs, \nPradeshiya  Sabhas,  NWSDB,  and  PIUs  will  enhance  women's  role  in  the  sector.  Women's \nparticipation  in  the  CBOs  and  implementing  units  will  provide  them  with  greater  voice  in  the \nplanning, implementation, and management of water supply schemes. \n \n53. \nAn  indirect  benefit  of  the  Project  will  be  its  support  to  the  ongoing  peace  efforts.  The \nimplementation  of  the  Project  in  Muttur  and  Batticaloa  towns  will  require  the  collaboration  of \nboth  the  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  institutions  and  the  local  communities.  The cooperation \nneeded will provide a visible platform for the commitment to the peace process and will translate \nthe benefits of the peace process into specific improvements to the living conditions of the civil \npopulation,  which  has  suffered  civil  unrest  for  the  last  two  decades.  The  rural  component  will \nempower  communities  by  involving  them  in  the  decision  making  process  and  transferring  the \nassets and the responsibility for the O&M of the schemes to the CBOs. \n \n54. \nHealth.  Access to safe drinking water and sanitation will reduce waterborne diseases in \nthe  general  population,  improving  their  health  status.  This  benefit  will  accrue  especially  to \ninfants  and  children,  who  are  more  vulnerable  and  who  suffer  more  frequently  and  more \nseverely  from  waterborne  diseases.  The  Project  will  significantly  reduce  infant  and  child \n\n\f15\n \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\nmortality, and malnutrition caused or aggravated by waterborne diseases in the project areas. \n \n55. \nEconomic.    The  Project  will  reduce  the  amount  of  resources  (time  and  cash) \nhouseholds spend to procure safe water. Other benefits will accrue from savings in number of \nwork days lost due to waterborne diseases and related medical expenditures. Direct benefits to \nthe economy through contracts and employment have been estimated to amount to $7.2 million. \nBasic infrastructure will increase the potential for private investment in the project areas and will \nindirectly benefit the local economy.  \n \n56. \nEnvironmental.    With  increasing  population  and  growth  of  urban  centers,  increasing \npressure is placed on the limited aquifers if underground water continues to be the only source \nof  water.  Provision  of  piped  water  from  surface  sources  will  decrease  the  pressure  on  the \naquifers,  especially  in  Batticaloa  and  Muttur.  Provision  of  sanitation,  drainage,  and  waste \ntreatment will reduce domestic waste pollution. \n \nB. \n \n57. \nPolicy.  The  Project  assumes  a  stable  political  environment  and  positive  economic \ngrowth. A halt in the peace process, currently considered unlikely, is a significant risk as it may \nimpede the implementation of the Batticaloa and Muttur subcomponents. It is assumed that the \nimplementation  of  policy  reforms  will  continue,  including  the  development  of  a  regulatory \nstructure for the water sector under the public utilities commission and the introduction of private \nsector  participation.  The  institutional  strengthening  component  is  designed  to  support  this \nmomentum by strengthening the capacity of NWSDB to implement these policies in coordination \nwith other external agencies.  \n \n58. \nEconomic and Financial. The financial and economic viability of the Project assumes a \n2% growth in household income per year. Inadequate cost recovery and financial capacity and \ninadequate maintenance and asset management will risk the sustainability of the Project. Policy \nchanges  affecting  tariffs  would  pose  a  financial  risk  to  the  Project.  Tariff  settings  need  to  be \ndriven by financial considerations and be independent of political influence.  \n \n59.  Moreover, tariffs and connection fees should be affordable to the intended beneficiaries \nto assure an optimal connection rate and tariff collection, which are the main sources of revenue \nfor the Project. Affordability is calculated as the percent of monthly household income spent on \nthe monthly water and wastewater bill. At the proposed tariff level (in 2008) the average monthly \nwater  bill  for  a  median  and  low  income  household  will  range  between  2.4%  and  2.7%  and \nbetween 2.6% and 3.2% of household income, respectively. In all cases, this is considered well \nwithin  generally  accepted  affordability  levels.  In  accordance  with  NWSDB  existing  practice,  it \nhas  been  assumed  that  the  full  cost  of  connection  will  be  charged  to  the  customer.  The \nminimum  cost  of  a  connection  is  calculated  to  be  SLRs8,100  per  household.  Full  payment  up \nfront will be an estimated 6.8% of annual income for a median income household and 13.5% of \nannual household income for a low income household. Payment in installments over 24 months \n(i.e.,  exclusive  of  financing  charges)  will  represent  3.3%  of  household  income  or  6.5%, \nrespectively. \n \n60. \nInstitutional Capacity.  Insufficient  institutional  capacity  at  the  local  government  level \nposes  a  risk  to  the  implementation  of  the  rural  component.  Therefore,  the  Project  will  provide \ntraining  and  support  to  the  Pradeshiya  Sabhas.  In  addition,  the  Government  will  provide  the \nnecessary  budget  allocations  for  the  Pradeshiya  Sabhas  to  have  one  technical  officer  to  be \ntrained and to work full time in the Project. \n\n \n\n\f 16 \n\n \n\n \n61. \nEnvironment.  The  Project  is  in  environmental  category  B.  An  initial  environmental \nexamination  was  carried  out  for  each  of  the  project  districts,  and  supplementary  analysis  is \nbeing  carried  out  for  the  proposed  augmentation  of  the  Unnichchai  Tank  in  Batticaloa,  the \nborehole in Polonnaruwa, and the salinity barriers in Hambantota and Matara. The preliminary \ninitial  environmental  examination  shows  that  adverse  environmental  effects  will  be  limited  and \ncan be mitigated through integrated corrective measures integrated in the project environmental \nmitigation  plan.  The  examinations  indicate  that  a  safe,  clean,  and  reliable  water  supply  and \nimproved  sanitation  in  urban  areas  will  significantly  improve  public  health  and  environmental \nconditions in the project towns.  \n \n62. \nCommunities  using  wells  for  water  supply  are  vulnerable  to  the  contamination  of \ngroundwater by the high density of latrines and septic tanks, and unsatisfactory drainage works. \nThe  expansion  of  the  water  supply  systems  will  reduce  the  need  for  some  sections  of  the \ncommunity  to  continue  to  use  groundwater  and  the  awareness  campaign  will  educate \nbeneficiaries  on  how  to  mitigate  this  risk.  To  ensure  that  urban  schemes  deliver  safe  water, \neffective  monitoring  of  treatment  processes  and  O&M  procedures,  and  daily  chlorine  residual \ntesting will be instituted and monitored by NWSDB. The treatment plants will produce very small \namounts of sludge over several years. The sludge is not toxic and will be disposed of safely.  \n \n63.  Mitigation  measures  have  been  proposed  and  with  the  findings  of  the  supplementary \nstudies, these will be incorporated in the project design. Environmental management plans are \nproposed  for  each  project  component  to  the  NWSDB  district  offices  for  implementation. \nEnvironmental  training  programs  will  be  provided  for  the  staff  of  the  PSIU  and  CBOs,  to \nstrengthen  their  capacities  of  addressing  environmental  concerns  during  the  design  and \nconstruction  phases  of  the  Project.  The  contractors  will  be  required  to  prepare  and  implement \ntheir  own  environmental  management  plans,  and  carry  out  the  construction  work  in  line  with \ninternational  standards.  Other  measures  to  be  implemented  as  part  of  the  Project  include  (i) \ncontrol  and  monitoring  of  activities  in  catchments  upstream  of  water  supply  intakes  and \nborefields, (ii) monitoring of water quality and quantity at water supply intakes, and (iii) licensing \nof wastewater treatment plants. Additional information is included in Appendix 13. \n \n64.  Water Rights. The Project has identified raw water sources required to supply water for \ndomestic use to the targeted populations. With the exception of Batticaloa, no conflict between \nexisting and new users has been identified. In Batticaloa, the Project will raise the Unnichchai \nTank to increase its storage capacity to provide sufficient water for domestic use and farming. \nThe  construction  of  the  Batticaloa  water  supply  scheme  involves  raising  the  Unnichchai  Tank \nbund  and  modifying  the  spill  gates  to  increase  raw  water  available  for  domestic consumption. \nInitial feasibility studies indicated that during the raising of the tank it may be necessary to lower \nthe  tank  water  level,  which  will  temporarily  deprive  rice  cultivators,  wage  laborers,  and \nfishermen in the Unnichchai area of income. The Project has made provisions for this event and \nconsultations  have  taken  place  with  the  affected  people.  On  6  June  2002,  NWSDB  discussed \nand distributed a draft compensation plan among the affected people and relevant stakeholders. \nNWSDB  has  consulted  with  affected  farmers  in  Polonnaruwa  and  Batticaloa  to  obtain  their \nconsent  to  use  the  water  rights  for  drinking  purposes.

Consequently,  the  financial  and  operational  efficiency  of  NWSDB \ndefines the quality of service in Sri Lanka and the sector\u2019s capacity for new investments. Finally, \nNWSDB  has  a  major  role  in  implementing  new  policies  and  starting  the  decentralization  of \nservice  provision  to  local  authorities,  the  private  sector,  and  community-based  organizations \n(CBOs). \n \nA. \n \n2. \nA  financial  model  for  NWSDB  us es  NWSDB\u2019s  historical  financial  statements  and \nperformance targets as a basis for projecting water sales and revenues and operating costs. It \nreflects NWSDB ongoing capital projects and loan repayment obligations and incorporates the \ncapital  cost  and  financing  assumptions  of  the  proposed  Project.  The  financial  model  provides \nindicative  targets  for  the  tariff  levels  and  financial  and  operational  performance  improvements \nnecessary to support the sustainability of existing investments, to meet debt-service obligations, \nand to satisfy the financial covenants of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).  \n \n3. \nNWSDB\u2019s  financial  performance  has  improved  as  a  result  of  increased  customer \nnumbers  and  improved  technical  performance.  Revenue,  since  1966,  has  been  sufficient  to \nmeet actual operation and maintenance (O&M) costs and debt service; and from 1997 through \nto  2001,  NWSDB  has  achieved  a  cost  recovery  ratio  of  1.0  as  covenanted  under  its  existing \nADB loan. These achievements recognize necessary adjustments to reflect the impact of certain \naccounting  policies.1  Table  A2.1  summarizes  NWSDB\u2019s  financial  performance  from  1996  to \n2001.  Despite  NWSDB\u2019s  improved  financial  performance  to  date,  O&M  is  not  regarded  as \nadequate in many towns and debt-service obligations remain highly subsidized, with a high level \nof  grant  funding  provided  to  NWSDB.  Moreover,  except  for  some  modest  rehabilitation, \nrevenues  from  water  sales  remain  inadequate  to  make  any  real  contribution  to  future  capital \nexpenditure  out  of  tariffs  and  NWSDB  continues  to  be  heavily  reliant  on  the  Government  and \nofficial development assistance funding for major capital works.  \n \n\nTable A2.1: Summary of NWSDB\u2019s Net Profit, 1996 to 2001 \n\n \n\n1996 \nAudited \n\n1997 \nAudited \n\n1998 \nAudited \n\n1999 \nAudited \n\n2000 \nAudited \n\nItem \nAs Prese nted \nNet Profit \nCRRa \nAdjustedb \n\nNet Profit \n\n \n(312) \n1.0 \n \n(341) \n1.0 \n12.6 \n\n \n88 \n1.2 \n \n(57) \n1.1 \n7.3 \n\n \n182 \n1.2 \n \n27 \n1.1 \n6.0 \n\n \n359 \n1.3 \n \n125 \n1.2 \n5.5 \n\n \n221 \n1.2 \n \n(34) \n1.1 \n7.3 \n\nCRRa \nNondomestic : Domestic \nTariffc  \nCRR = cost recovery ratio, NWSDB = National Water Supply and Drainage Board. \na  Operation and maintenance costs plus the greater of depreciation or debt service. \nb \n\n2001 \nEst. \n \n371 \n1.2 \n \n96 \n1.1 \n6.2 \n\nAdjustments involve adding back depreciation on grant-funded assets, and reducing capitalization of overheads \nby 50%. \nRatio nondomestic (commercial) : domestic tariffs for 25 cubic meters (volumetric and fixed charges). \n\nSource: ADB and Government agreed performance targets. \n                                                 \n1  Head  office  salaries  and  planning  costs  have  been  overcapitalized,  depreciation  is  not  charged  against  grant-\nfunded assets, and a high proportion of assets remain in work-in-progress, further reducing depreciation actually \nexpensed.  \n\nc \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n24 \n\nNWSDB Financial Viability \n\n \nB. \n \n4. \nNWSDB  prepared  a  tariff  policy  for  drinking  water  that  was  endorsed  by  the previous \ngovernment.  However,  the  policy  limits  the  level  of  cost  recovery  that  could  be  achieved  by \nusers  and  does  not  adequately  distinguish  between  cost  recovery  policies  for  what  should  be \nregarded as large urban centers such as Colombo, other urban centers, and smaller urban and \nrural  centers.  Nor  are  the  affordability  of  service  levels  and  technology  options  appropriately \ntaken into account in investment decisions, which ultimately impact the level of costs. Both need \nto  be  addressed  to  best  ensure  affordable  tariff  levels  that  can  optimally  support  full  cost \nrecovery and financially sustainable service delivery.  \n \n5. \nand the following targets have been agreed:  \n \n\nFinancial  and  operational  performance  covenants  have  been  discussed  with  NWSDB \n\nTable A2.2: NWSDB Performance Indicators \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nDecrease \nIncrease of Total \nOperating Exp. \nDecrease of Total \n\nO&M \n\nIncrease of Total \nOperating Exp. \n\nPerformance Indicator \n1.  m3 Billeda (%) \n2.

Under  the  technical  support  of  the  Project\u2019s  institution  strengthening  component, \nNWSDB  will  review  the  tariff  strategy  and  develop  and  implement  a  strategy  to  transfer \nresponsibility of smaller water schemes (with less than 1,000 connections) to local government \ninstitutions, private sector, or CBOs to better ensure their cost effective operation. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n25 \n\n \n7. \nReal  increases  in  the  tariff  will  be  required  and  the  Government  has  agreed  to  ensure \nthat  tariff  levels  will  meet  at  least  O&M,  depreciation,  and  rehabilitation  cost.  The  affordability \nassessment  presented  in  this  section  suggests  the  proposed  tariff  levels  are  generally \naffordable  in  accordance  with  internationally  accepted  benchmarks.  Timely  public  campaigns \nwill be critical to generate the support of key decision makers as well as general public support \nand willingness to pay. The Project provides resources for this activity. \n \nIndependent  Regulation  and  Private  Sector  Participation. The establishment of an \n8. \nindependent regulatory structure for the water sector is currently under way. The Public Utilities \nCommission  Bill  has  been  approved  by  Parliament  and  commissioners  are  expected  to  be \nappointed by the end of 2002. The Commission will implement the regulations to be developed \nby the Ministry of Housing and Plantation Infrastructure under the water industry act.  \n\n \n\n9. \nThe private sector in Greater Colombo has successfully participated in activities such as \nmetering,  billing,  and  collection.  Outsourcing  will  be  encouraged  by  the  Project  in  all  regional \nschemes and especially in those under the urban component. The Government is in the process \nof  introducing  private  sector  participation  in  the  operation  of  some  water  schemes.  In  October \n1999, the National Policy on Private Sector Participation in Water Supply and Sanitation stated \neight  urban  water  supply  schemes  would  be  selected  as  pilot  projects  for  private  sector \nparticipation,  and  demarcated  potentially  profitable  service  areas  for  the  Government  to  enter \ninto partnerships with the private sector for O&M and to extend water systems.2 \n \n10. \nDecentralization  to  Local  Government  and  CBOs.  Currently,  local  authorities  have \nlittle  capacity  to  implement  their  recent  mandate  to  provide  water  and  sanitation.  Most  local \ngovernments do not have the financial capacity to invest in water and sanitation, and many do \nnot  even  have  the  financial  and  technical  capacity  to  operate  and  maintain  the  existing  ones. \nNWSDB manages 99 water schemes with less than 1,000 connections and although it has tried \nto  transfer  them  to  local  authorities,  they  have  not  accepted  the  responsibility.  The  small \nschemes have a higher O&M cost than large ones due to lack of economies of scale and higher \ncost of management if run by NWSDB, and should be transferred to local authorities, CBOs, or \nthe  private  sector.  The  Project  provides  support  for  these  schemes  to  be  rehabilitated  and \ntransferred. \n \n11. \nRural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector.  The  National  Policy  for  Rural  Water \nSupply and Sanitation Sector, approved in 2001, indicates that rural sector activities should be \nbased  on  participatory  approaches.  The  role  of  Government,  provincial  councils,  and  local \ngovernment  authorities  should  be  to  regulate  and  facilitate  the  implementation  of  the  sector \nactivities  while  CBOs  and \nthe  providers  of  services. \nthe  private  sector  should  be \nNongovernment organizations are recognized as facilitators of water provision. Local authorities \nare  also  recognized  as  service  providers  when  required.  The  policy  recognizes  water  as  an \neconomic  good  and  indicates  that  users  should  bear  the  full  responsibility  of  the  sustainable \nO&M of facilities and assets and be encouraged to share the initial capital investment \n\n_________________________________ \n\n2 \n\n \nGovernment of Sri Lanka. 2002.

The  institutional  strengthening \ncomponent  includes  resources  to  implement  as  strategy  to  improve \nfinancial management of NWSDB, including an assets registry. In the \nrural  component,  sustainability  is  ensured  by  demand-driven  and \ncommunity ownership approaches and the education and awareness \nregarding the O&M cost implications for each technical option. \n \n2.  Operational performance targets have been agreed with NWSDB, \nincluding for nonrevenue water. The institutional component provides \nfinancial support to implement these strategies. Specific targets and \ndates in covenants will be used as benchmarks to evaluate NWSDB\u2019s \nperformance. \n \n\nin  awareness \n3.  Sanitation  and  hygiene  have  been \ncampaigns.

The  Project  is  implemented  in  water-scarce areas of the country. \nWater  demand  management  has  been  incorporated  in  the  National \nWater Supply and Sanitation Policy and will be part of the awareness \ncampaign  message \ninstitutional \nstrengthening  component.  Similarly,  the  Project  supports  the  new \nGovernment  policy  to  target 100 liters per capita per day (instead of \n120),  already  reflected  in  the  tariff  increase  approved  in  June  2002, \nwhich penalizes high consumption. \n \n5.  The  rural  component  uses  a  demand-driven  community-based \napproach that requires the participation of beneficiaries in the design, \nimplementation, financing, and operation of the systems. The Project \nincludes  a  gender  action  plan  that  requires  women  to  participate  as \nbeneficiaries  and  implementers  in  decision-making.  Communities  will \nalso participate in the identification of subprojects. \n\n \n\nfor \n\n6.

The rural component focuses in developing the capacity of CBOs \nto  maintain  the  system.  In  the  third  project  (1575-SRI:  Third  Water \nSupply  and  Sanitation  Project),  the  NWSDB  project  implementation \nunits  with \n(NGO) \nimplemented  the  project  with  the  CBO  and,  after  project  completion, \nthe local government engineer was to provide support to the CBO. In \nthe  proposed  Project,  the  local  government  will  be  implementing  the \nProject  and  the  expertise  and  support  role  will  continue  even  after \nproject implementation. \n \n8.  The Project focuses on institutional development in the rural and \nurban  components.  The  rural  component  is  designed  to  provide \ncommunities  with  the  capacity  to  form  viable  sustainable  CBOs  that \ncan take responsibility for the systems. The institutional strengthening \ncomponent is very substantial and addresses the major challenges to \nmake  the  NWSDB  sustainable  and  capable  for  O&M  of  the  project \ninvestments. \n \n9.  The demand-driven approach, with communities providing 20% of \nthe  investment  and  being  involved  in  the  identification,  design,  and \nimplementation  of  the  schemes,  ensures  that  the  service  to  be \nprovided  meets  community's  aspiration.  Also,  the  Project  allows \nhouseholds  to  opt  for  different  technical  options  in  the  same \ncommunity when viable. \n\n10.   The Project acknowledges the different levels of social capital in \nthe communities and that this problem is more acute with a  demand-\ndriven  approach.  The  project  awareness  campaign  in  rural  areas \ncommences  with  the  introduction  of  sanitation  to  allow  communities \nto  gain  confidence  in  the  Project  and  in  their  capacity  to  organize. \nThe  use  of  NGO  partner  organizations  is  also  a  key   factor,  as  they \nhave  skills \nin \ncommunities. \n \n\nidentifying  and  strengthening  social  capital \n\nin \n\n11.

One  of  the  objectives  of  the  public  awareness campaign under \nthe  institutional  strengthening  component  is  to  educate  consumers \nregarding  their  rights  and  their  responsibilities,  emphasizing  that \nwater is scarce and is an economic good. \n \n16.   Beneficiaries  are  required  to  provide  20%  of  the  capital  cost  of \nthe  Project  and  the  CBO  takes  ownership  of  the  assets  after  project \ncompletion. \n\n17.   CBOs  are  provided  with  training  on  how  to  set  tariffs  and  are \nadvised to include not only O&M but also capital replacement. \n\n18.   Beneficiaries\u2019 involvement starts at the selection process, where \ncommunities  are  required  to  fill  in  a  self-assessment  form  to  be \neligible  for  the  Project.  CBOs  participate  in  project  identification, \ndesign,  implementation,  and  procurement,  and  they  collect  initial \ncapital contributions and monitor construction activities. \n \n\n19.   The Project encourages CBOs to use private sector providers. \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY \n \n\nA. \n\n \nSector identified as a National Priority in \nCountry Poverty Analysis? \n\n \nYes \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n \nSector identified as a National \nPriority in Country Poverty \nPartnership Agreement? \n \n\n \nYes \n\n \n\nContribution of the sector/sub-sector to reduce poverty in Sri Lanka \n \nSri  Lanka  ranked  84th  among  174  countries  in  the  2000  human  development  index.  The  percentage  of \n \npoor households has fallen from 18.2% to 13.4% in urban areas from 1992 to 1996, and, in the same period, the \npercentage  of  poor  households  has  declined  in  rural  areas.  Despite  impressive  achievements,  poverty  levels  in \nSri Lanka remain high. Poverty is multifaceted and is manifested in the ability to afford basic consumption goods, \nand lack of access to basic needs such as safe drinking water, sanitation facilities, health care, and education. In \nrecent  years,  water-related  diseases  and  child  malnutrition  have  worsened.  Twenty-eight  percent  of  the \npopulation does not have access to safe drinking water and 24% does not have access to safe sanitation. There \nare regional variations in terms of dimensions to poverty with poverty levels in the northeast among the highest in \nthe  nation.  In  some  districts,  including  Muttur,  over  half  of  the  rural  population  does  not  have  access  to  safe \ndrinking water supplies. Inadequate sanitation infrastructure and access to safe drinking water in urban and rural \nareas are the leading causes of public health problems in poor communities.  \n \n \nThe  2002  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  of  the  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  states  \u201cthe  provision  of  safe \ndrinking  water,  and  adequate  sewage  and  sanitation  systems,  is  frequently  cited  as  the  single,  highest  social \nservice  priority  by  poor  households.\u201d  The  strategy  includes  provision  of  water  to  85%  of  the  population  by  2010. \nIn April 2002, the Government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) signed a poverty partnership agreement \nthat recognizes water supply and sanitation as a main strategy for poverty reduction.  \n \n \nThe  proposed  Project  will  provide  safe  drinking  water  to  approximately  969,000  people  and  sanitation \nfacilities  to  171,500  people,  specifically  to  poor  and  low  income  households  in  rural  areas  of  Anuradhapura  and \nPolonnaruwa districts of North Central Province and in the towns of Batticaloa, Hambantota, Matara, Muttur, and \nPolonnaruwa.  The  Project  aims  to  improve  living  condition  and  health  status  of  the  people  in  the  project  area \nspecifically for the poor and disadvantaged.

There has been a significant deterioration in the general economic, social, and physical conditions have \ndeteriorated  significantly  in  the  northeast  region  over  the  past  two  decades  due  to  ethnic  conflict  and  war,  and \npoverty  is  quantitatively  and  qualitatively  different  from  that  in  other  parts  of  the  country.  Although  no  official \nstatistics are available for this region due to the unfavorable security situation, the project socioeconomic surveys \nshow  that  in  Batticaloa  and  Muttur  in  the  Northeast  Province,  poverty  is  higher  than  in  the  rest  of  the  country, \nthere is a high concentration of ethnic minorities, and health indicators are lower, and the situation is more acute \nin  Muttur.  Therefore,  74%  of  the  capital  investment  of  the  Project  will  concentrate  in  the  northeast,  where \ninvestments in basic infrastructure have been arrested for the last 20 years and poverty is greater.  \n \nIn Polonnaruwa and Anurapurah districts, the poverty incidence is 8% higher than the national figure3 and \n \nis  the  third  poorest  province  based  on  the  higher  poverty  line.  Within  the  districts,  poverty  is  higher  in  the  rural \nareas, which are targeted in the rural component. The Project will prioritize rural investments based on demand-\ndriven and need criteria. \n \nFour  of  the  five  project  districts  are  in  the  northeast  and  northcentral  regions.  In  these  four  districts,  40\u2013\n \n45%  of  the  people  live  below  poverty  line.  Hambantota  in  the  south  has  a  high  incidence of drought and limited \ngroundwater. Although income levels are similar to the national average, the population has to spend more than \nin  other  parts  of  the  country  to  have  access  to  drinking  water.  Lack  of  income,  employment,  and  water  are  the \nmain concerns among the poor in Hambantota district. In low-density areas of Hambantota, the Project will use a \ncommunity-based  approach  (currently  implemented  by  the  Third  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project)  to \nreach communities. During implementation, special attention will be given to community participation to overcome \nthe lack of trust in the Government and nongovernment organization (NGO) efforts.4 \n  \n3\n  Poverty incidence based on the lower and higher poverty line in North Central Province is 31% and 47% respectively, \n\nwhile at national level it is 25% and 39%. \n\n4\n  ADB. 2000.

The  rural  component  of  the  Project  requires  active  participation  of  people.  CBOs  will  be  formed  before \nsubproject  implementation  and  take  responsibility  for  the  selection  of  proper  water  system  and  technology, \nprocurement of goods, monitoring of construction, and contribution to the capital investment (20% in kind and/or \nlabor). After implementation, the CBOs will take ownership of the assets and be responsible for the operation and \nmaintenance  of  the  systems.

In the urban components, a mechanism will be developed for community members in project \nareas  to  bring  their  concerns  and/or  feedback  regarding  project  implementation  to  the  project  coordination \ncommittee at the central level. \n\nD. \n\nPotential Issues \n\nResettlement   \n\nImpact \n\nNot \nSignificant \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\nGender  \n\nPlan Required \n\nShort resettlement \nplan \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nThe  Project  will  require  the  permanent  acquisition  of \n10.0  hectares  (ha)  of  land,  of  which  1.1  ha  are  owned \nby  National  Water  Supply  and  Drainage  Board \n(NWSDB),  1.4  ha  private  land  and  the  rest  by  the \nGovernment.  Land  acquisition  will  not  result  in  loss  of \nlivelihoods  or  community  resources.  Temporary  loss  of \nlivelihoods may be incurred because construction in the \nUnnichchai Tank will affect approximately 4,000 people. \nA compensation plan has been prepared and disclosed \nto the affected people. \n\n Significant  The  Project  will  benefit  women  in  several  ways:  (i) \navailability  of  safe  drinking  water  in  the  household  or \nneighborhood  will  reduce  the  drudgery  of  women\u2019s \nwork  associated  with  fetching  water  and  will  reduce \nleast  50%  of  CBO \nwaterborne  diseases;  (ii)  at \nmembership  will  be  women;  (iii)  women  staff  of \nNWSDB  and  Pradeshiya  Sabhas  will  be  given \npreference  for  training  under  the  Project;  (iv)  women \nwill  be  especially  encouraged  to  apply  for  the  project \nimplementation unit (PIU).  \n\nIncorporated in the \nproject design \n\nSee gender action \nplan in Section E \n\nAffordability  \n \n \n\nNot \nSignificant \n\nLabor \n \n \n\nNot \nSignificant \n\nIndigenous People \n \n\nNot \nSignificant \n\nof \n\nfor \n\nrecipients \n\nconnection \n\nSubsidized \nthe \nGovernment\u2019s  social  assistance  program  that  provides \nsome  subsidized  or  free  food  and  other  basic  services \nto  poor  people;  provision  of  metered  communal  stand \npost  taps  in  poor  communities  and  markets;  provision \nof affordable tariff for basic consumption (100 liters per \nperson per day).  \nThe Project will ensure fair wages for the laborer in the \nconstruction  works  and  that  women  and  men  get  equal \nwages  for  similar  work.  The  Project  will  monitor  fair \nwages  for  the  laborers,  and  equal  wages  for  women \nand men laborers.  \nTwo of the project areas (Muttur and Batticaloa) include \n100% of the ethnic minority groups.  \n\nIncorporated in \nthe Project design \n\nIncorporated  in  the \nproject design \n\nNone \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n33 \n\n \n\nNone \n\nGender Action Plan \n\nNot \nSignificant \n\nOther Risks/ \nVulnerabilities \n \nE.  \n \n \nThe Project recognizes that participation of women in decision making is important, as they are providers, \nusers, and managers of water at the household level. The woman is the best person in a village household to ask \nabout  the  quantity,  quality,  and  reliability  of  water  used  by  her  family.  The  Project  also  recognizes  that \ncommunication and interaction with women are more effective when done by other women, and consequently it is \nimportant  to  include  women  in  the  implementation  team.  Therefore,  the  Project  will  actively  encourage  the \nparticipation of women as beneficiaries and implementers. \n \n \nDuring  social  mobilization  at  selected  villages,  the  importance  of  women  participation  will  be  explained  to \nbeneficiary communities in village meetings, hygiene education, and all other project activities. The following targets \nwill be achieved in the implementation of the rural component: \n \n(i) \n\nProject  facilitators  will  emphasize  the  need  to  have  active  participation  of  all  at  community  meetings, \nwhich will include 50% participation by women. \n50% participation in small group activities will be by women. \nThe executive committee of the CBO will be at least 50% women. \nSeparate discussions with women\u2019s groups will take place regarding technologies and service level of the \nwater supply facilities built by the Project. If major differences occur between women\u2019s groups and mixed \nor  men\u2019s  groups,  the  Project  facilitators  will  take  an  active  role  to  prevent  women's  decisions  being \novershadowed. \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Executing Agency will actively recruit qualified women in all levels of the project implementation \n\nstructure, especially in the rural component. The institutional strengthening component activities related to \ntraining will specify how participation of women will be encouraged. The following targets shall be achieved in the \nproject implementation and the institutional strengthening component. \n \n(i) \n\n25 % of professional and technical level staff working in the project, project monitoring unit (PMU), project \nimplementation unit (PIU), Pradeshiya Sabhas, and counterpart NGOs will be women.  \nOn the institutional strengthening component, at least 20% by NWSDB professionals who participate in \nthe training subcomponent will be women. \nIn designing awareness campaigns about water supply and sanitation, the role of women in the \nhousehold for most of the provision and use of water will be taken into account. \n\n(iii) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n \nThe NWSDB and PMU will be responsible for developing and implementing the appropriate strategies \nand action plans to achieve these targets. NWSDB and the PMU will monitor these targets through the project \nprogress reports and the project benefit monitoring. \n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n \nSUMMARY SHORT RESETTLEMENT PLAN  \n\nFor Temporary Loss of Livelihood \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nThe  Project  will  build,  among  others,  a  water  supply  scheme  for  Batticaloa  to  provide \npiped  water  to  approximately  270,000  people.  The  construction  of  this  scheme  may  require \nraising the Unnichchai Tank bund to increase raw water availability for domestic consumption. \nDuring construction, the tank water level may have to be lowered to below the level where the \ntank can provide water. This may deprive for one dry season the source of livelihood of 1,898 \nfarmers  and  2,200  wage  laborers  who  depend  on  the  tank  for  irrigation,  and  177  fishers  who \nmay not be able to fish for one year. Although engineering solutions to avoid disrupting irrigation \nare still being explored, NWSDB has prepared a draft compensation plan in the event that the \npeople  will  be  affected  by  the  tank  augmentation.  The  objective  of  this  plan  is  to  set  a \nmechanism to provide fair compensation, as defined under and Sri Lanka National Involuntary \nResettlement Policy and the Policy on Involuntary Resettlement of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB), for any person who may lose all or part of her or his income due to the Project.  \n \n2. \nEntitlements.    If  there  are  any  affected  people,  they will be entitled to compensation, \nincluding  (i)  male  and  female  farmers,  both  owners  and  tenants,  (ii)  male  and  female  wager \nlaborers, and (iii) male fishers. Affected people are entitled to be compensated for their losses \nand to be informed fully and consulted on compensation options. The assessment of the exact \nextent of cultivated land affected by the Project will be obtained from a special land assessment \ncommittee  that  will  be  formed.  It  will  comprise  a  government  agent  or  divisional  secretary, \nAgricultural  Service  Committee,  farmer  organization,  and  the  Irrigation  Department  of  the \nNational Water Supply & Drainage Board (NWSDB). The land assessment committee will use \nthe  Paddy  Land  Register  as  the  bases  of  its  assessment.  The  estimated  total  area  is \napproximately 1,227 hectares (ha) during the dry season, which may affect approximately 3,687 \npeople. A detailed description of the current estimates is provided in Supplementary Appendix \nA. \n \n3. \nConsultation, Participation, Grievances, and Public Disclosure.  After consultations \nwith the farmers and discussions with the project consultants and ADB officers, the Government \nprepared a draft compensation plan that summarized the actions that the Government and ADB \nare planning to put in effect to compensate the people affected by the raising of the Unnichchai \nTank.  The  draft  plan  was  translated  into  Tamil  and  made  into  a  simplified  cartoon  version. \nCopies were provided to the representatives of the affected farmers, wage laborers, and fishers. \nThe plan was discussed with the affected people on 6 and 7 June 2002. The affected farmers \nwere asked to raise any questions or concerns regarding the plan by 30 July 2002. \n \nThe  plan  will  set  the  guidelines  and  process  for  delivering  any  required  compensation. \n4. \nThe  details  of  the  compensation  plan  are  not  yet  finalized,  as  it  is  important  that  the  affected \npeople  and  the  stakeholders  participate  in  designing  the  final  plan.  Thus,  the  draft  plan  will \nestablish  two  local  stakeholders  committees  to  consider  compensation  entitlement  and \ngrievance  and  compensation  disbursement  procedures  (compensation  committees).  Both \nfemale and male representatives from the affected groups and from the stakeholders will be part \nof  both  compensation  committees.  The  two  groups  should  meet  separately  to  assess  their \nposition  without  undue  pressure  from  influential  persons  or  groups.  Once  their  individual \nstances  are  determined,  plenary  meetings  can  be  held  to  come  to  an  agreement.  An \nindependent  and  knowledgeable  facilitator  will  be  provided  by  the  Project  to  participate  in  the \nmeetings and assure appropriate transparency and fairness of the process. The compensation \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n35 \n\nCompensation.  The  Project  will  make  sure \n\ncommittees, in coordination with the project monitoring unit (PMU), will decide upon the (i) units \nentitled to compensation (individuals vs. households); (ii) criteria to be entitled to compensation; \n(iii)  criteria  to  assess  due  compensation  amounts  for  each  affected  unit;  (iv)  monitoring \nmechanisms  to  assure  that  compensation  has  reached  the  intended  beneficiaries;  (v) \nprocedures  to  redress  grievances  by  people  regarding  entitlement  to  compensation;  (vi) \nmodality  for  payment  of  compensation  (timing,  kind  or  cash,  etc);  (vii)  type  of  identification \nrequired to claim compensation; (viii) advance warning period needed by the different affected \ngroups before construction; and (ix) institutional arrangements for delivery of compensation. \n \n5. \nthat  people  receive  appropriate \ncompensation  for  any  losses  incurred  due  to  the  Project.  The  exact  amounts  will  be  agreed \nbetween the affected people and the committee with the assistance of a facilitator. Although the \ncompensation committee will determine the final amounts and type of compensation, the Project \nhas  prepared  estimates  using  data  from  adjacent  areas  and  information  from  local  people  in \norder  to  prepare  a  budget  to  cover  compensation.  These  estimates  were  revised  with  the \naffected  people  during  consultations  on  6  and  7  June  2002.  Payment  and  disbursement  of \ncompensation  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  Executing  Agency  (NWSDB)  and  the  project \nimplementation unit (PIU).  \n \n6. \nInstitutional  Framework.  The  project  director  appointed  by  NWSDB  is  directly \nresponsible  for  paying  the  compensation  to  the  affected  people.  The  Batticaloa  NWSDB,  with \nthe  support  of  the  resettlement  specialist,  will  coordinate  day-to-day  implementation  and \nmonitoring  of  the  plan,  including  participation  in  the  committee  meeting,  collection  of  data  on \naffected  people,  and  disbursement  of  payments.  NWSDB  will  be  responsible  for  implementing \nthe final compensation plan.  \n \n7. \nImplementation  Schedule  and  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  The construction works \nshould  be  completed  within  8\u201310 months to ensure water storage for the next year. Sufficient \nwarning  will  be  provided  to  the  affected  persons  of  disruption  to  irrigation  so  they  do  not \nunnecessarily  invest  in  crop  inputs.  In  the  6\u201312  months  leading  up  to  civil  works  to  raise  the \nbund,  names  of  people  entitled  to  compensation  will  be  assembled  by  Project  and  the \ncompensation committee. NWSDB is responsible for carrying out overall internal monitoring and \nevaluation.  The  PIU  in  Batticaloa  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  implementation  and \nmonitoring. \n\nFor Land Acquisition \n\nB. \n \n8. \nThe Project will require the permanent acquisition of 10.0 ha of land of which 1.1 ha are \nowned  by  NWSDB,  7.5  ha  are  Government  owned,  and  1.4  ha  are  privately  owned. \nApproximately  seven  private  landowners  will  be  affected  by  the  Project.  NWSDB  will  be \nresponsible for carrying out all land acquisition activities and has prepared a plan  according to \nthe National Involuntary Resettlement Policy and ADB's Policy on Involuntary Resettlement.  To \nestimate the budget needed for land acquisition, information regarding land market price in the \narea  for  similar  landholdings  has  been  used.  Discussions  have  been  held  with  the  affected \nGovernment institutions and private owners.  \n \n9. \nObjectives,  Policy  Framework,  and  Entitlements.    In  adherence  with  ADB's  policy, \nthe physical structures and pipes have been sited to avoid relocation of any permanent houses \nor structures or impact on land. Therefore, no people will be relocated. NWSDB will assure that \nthe  land  acquisition  procedures  for  project  activities  are  implemented  according  to  the \nprovisions set in the Short Resettlement Plan for Land Acquisition (SRPLA) and in accordance \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nwith  the  National  Involuntary  Resettlement  and  ADB  policies.  Affected  people  have  been \nidentified by the Project and are entitled to compensation based on replacement value. \n \n10. \nConsultation and Grievance Redress Participation. The SRPLA has been disclosed \nto  all  affected  people  and  discussed  with  them.  After  submission  by  the  Government,  it  was \nposted in ADB's web page for information. \n \n11. \nCompensation.  The  Project  consultants,  the  Government,  and  the  consultations  with \naffected  people  have  confirmed  that,  as  a  result  of  the  Project,  (i)  no  structures  or  productive \nassets are in any of the land properties; (ii)  no relocation or loss of income will result from the \nProject's  land  acquisition;  and  (iii)  all  of  the  affected  people  have  legal  titles  to  their  lands, \nalthough, all landowners (with or without legal titles) are entitled to compensation for their land. \nValuation  of  compensation  will  be  done  applying  the  replacement  value  as  defined  by  the \nGovernment  in  the  National  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  and  by  ADB's  Resettlement  and \nLand Acquisition Policy.  \n \nInstitutional  Framework.  The  PMU  in  NWSDB  is  responsible  for  the  overall \n12. \nimplementation  and  monitoring  of  the  land  acquisition.  The  NWSDB  district  offices  in \nTrincomalee  and  Hambantota  will  be  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  implementation  and \nmonitoring  of  the  SRPLA.  Project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  in  Muttur  and  Hambantota  will \ntake  over  these  responsibilities  once  they  have  been  established.  The  PMU  and  PIUs  will  be \nsupported  by  a  resettlement  specialist  provided  by  the  Project.  In  the  PIUs,  the  NWSDB \nresident  engineer  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  the  implementation  of  the  SRPLA  and \ncoordinating with the resettlement specialist.  \n \n13. \nThe  PMU  will  proceed  with  land  acquisition  procedures  as  soon  as  the  Project  is \neffective. (i) When the title to the land is clear, a government evaluation will be prepared and the \nnegotiations  with  the  owner  will  start.  Negotiations  will  be  conducted  by  NWSDB.  (ii)  The \ngovernment  evaluation  will  be  based  in  replacement  value  as  defined  in  ADB's  Involuntary \nResettlement  Policy.  Titleholders  will  be  compensated  for  all  permanent  land  losses  at  full \nreplacement cost. (iii) NWSDB will approve the earlier agreement reached between the owner \nand NWSDB. NWSDB\u2019s legal officer will execute the deed, and compensation will be disbursed \nby the PMU to the owner within one month of reaching the agreement. (iv) If agreement is not \nreached,  NWSDB  will  resort  to  compulsory  acquisition,  in  which  the  minister  responsible  for \nlands  will  issue  an  order  under  section  2  of  Lands  Acquisition.  In  such  an  event,  NWSDB  will \ncomply  with  the  National  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  and  ADB  policies  and  ensure  that \nreplacement value is paid for the required land.  \n \n14. \nImplementation  Schedule,  Budget,  and  Financing.  Land  acquisition  activities  will \ncommence 1 month after loan effectiveness (April 2003). All land acquisition will be completed, \nincluding payment of compensation, before civil works contracts can be awarded. The Project \nhas allocated counterpart funding to finance the land acquisition. The PMU will be responsible \nfor disbursing compensation within 1 month of reaching a written agreement with the landowner.\n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n37 \n\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN  \n \nTable A7.1: Detailed Project Costs and Financing Plan \n($\u2019000) \n\nItem \n \n\n \nA.

The economic internal rate of return and the \nfinancial  internal  return  (FIRR)  of  each  has  been  estimated,  and  a  sensitivity  analysis \nundertaken. In addition, the financial performance of National Water Supply and Drainage Board \n(NWSDB)  has  been  evaluated  to  determine  its  ability  to  financially  sustain  project-developed \nassets subsequent to their completion. \n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe objective of the financial analysis is to ensure that each town subcomponent and the \nProject  as  a  whole  are  financially  viable;  meaning  that  in  each  case  they  generate  revenues \nsufficient  to  cover  capital  and  operating  costs  and  rates  of  return  that  meet  or  exceed  the \nweighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  used  to  finance  each.  Revenues  are  those  derived \nfrom  water  tariffs  and  other  related  charges  that  are  directly  attributable  to  the  project. The \nmajor assumptions employed in the financial analysis are as follows:  \n \n\nProject Financial Analysis \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nScope.  Only  incremental  revenues  and  costs  directly  associated  with  each \nsubcomponent and/or the Project have been considered. The revenue and costs \nof existing systems have not been considered.  \nCost Savings Due to Reduced Nonrevenue Water (NRW). The subcomponent \nwill  rehabilitate  portions  of  the  existing  transmission  and  distribution  systems, \nresulting  in  a  reduction  in  NRW  and  a  consequent  reduction  in  the  required \nproduction per cubic meter of water sold and the unit cost of water sold.  \nForecast  Period.  The  FIRR  and  average  incremental  financial  cost  are \ncalculated from 2003 to 2050. \nPrice Basis. All revenues and costs are expressed in Sri Lankan rupees on an \nincremental basis in constant mid-2001 prices. They do not incorporate projected \ninflation  over  the  forecast  period.  All  foreign  costs  are  converted  to  Sri  Lankan \nrupees at an exchange rate of SLRs95 to US$1. \n\n(vi) \n\n(v)  Weighted Average Cost of Capital. The WACC is expressed in constant prices \nbefore tax. It is based on the cost of the capital for the subcomponents and the \nproject  respectively,  assuming  debt  at  an  interest  rate  of  10%  and  equity \nprovided by the Government, with an assumed no cost of capital  as relevant. A \nlong-term  domestic  inflation  rate  of  6.5%  is  assumed  in  the  estimate  of  the \nWACC.  \nDomestic Consumption. This is estimated assuming water consumption of 100 \nliters  per  capita  per  day  and  an  average  household  size  of  five  people. \nHouseholds are assumed to connect to water supply progressively over the initial \nyears  of  the  Project,  with  coverage  based  on  an  expected  rate  of  connection \nuptake  from  2003  in  each  town  to  2025  and  then  remaining  constant  over  the \nremainder of the forecast period. Nondomestic consumption is assumed at 30% \nof domestic sales. NRW is estimated at 25% of water production. \n\n \n3. \nProposed  real  increases  in  NWSDB  domestic  tariffs  for  the  lowest  consumption  bands \nare  approximately  50%  per  annum  over  the  next  4  years,  (i.e.,  2003\u20132006),  10%  for  the \nsubsequent 2 years (2007\u20132008), and 5% for the next 3 years (2009\u20132011). No real increase is \nassumed in 2012. The increases result in NWSDB tariffs as set out in Table A8.1. \n \n4. \n\nCapital costs are  estimated  for  each  project  town  and  include physical contingencies, \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\ndifficult areas allowance, taxes, and duties. The construction period is estimated to be over the \nperiod 2003\u20132007, with plant commissioning in 2007 but 1 year later, in 2008, in Batticaloa. No \nresidual values are assumed at the end of the evaluation period.  \n \nOperating  costs  are  based  on  the  expected  incremental  costs  of  additional  water \n5. \nproduction  and  sales.  Incremental  salaries  and  wages  are  based  on  the  expected  increase  in \nestablishment  costs  with  the  proposed  Project.  An  allowance for growth in customer numbers \nand  resulting  metering  reading  and  billing  and  other  incremental  costs  has  been  assumed  at \nSLRs0.5  per  cubic  meter  for  additional  water  production  over  the  first  year  of  operations  and \nmaterial  expenses  are  based  on  a  percentage  of  gross  fixed  assets.  It  is  assumed  that \nexpenses will be at 50% of the long-term allowance in the first year of operations and 75% in \nthe second year. \n \n\nTable A8.1:  NWSDB Tariffs Assuming Real Annual Increases \n\nItem \n\nProposed Domestic Tariff \n\n2002 \nSLRs/m3 \n1.25 \n\n2008 \n\n2012 \n\n0-10 \n\n11- 15 \n\n16 - 20 \n\n21-25 \n\n> 26 \n\nNondomestic \n\nFixed Charges \n\nDomestic \n\nNondomestic \nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n \n\n6.50 \n\n13.0 \n\n19.0 \n\n48.0 \n\n48.0 \n48.0 \n\n \n\n54 \n\n83 \n\n \n\n7.53 \n\n15.0 \n\n22.0 \n\n54.0 \n\n54.0 \n54.0 \n\n \n\n60 \n\n91 \n\n2.5 \n\n6.5 \n\n20.0 \n\n45.0 \n42.0 \n\n50 \n\n76 \n\nSLRs/month \n\n \n\n  \n \n6. \nThe  FIRR  calculated  for  each  project  town  (Batticaloa,  Hambantota,  Muttur,  and \nPolonnaruwa) and the Project as a whole are presented in Table A8.2.1 The calculated FIRR for \neach project town ranges between 5.2% and 9.9%, and the FIRR for the overall Project is 7.5%. \nAll  well  exceed  the  WACC  estimated  at  0.78%  for  the  four  towns.  The  sensitivity  analysis \nindicates  that  the  FIRR  is  most  sensitive  to  a  reduction  in  incremental  revenues  derived  from \nwater  tariffs.  However,  the  FIRR  is  robust  and  exceeds  the  WACC  following  the  sensitivity \nanalyses. The results are also summarized in Table A8.2. \n\n                                                 \n1 \n\nIn the case of Matara, the technical proposal being evaluated will improve the quality and reliability of the service \nand not the level of service. Therefore the analysis was limited to an economic evaluation of the salinity barrier to \nassess whether it represented the leas t cost option of meeting existing demand. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n41 \n\nTable A8.2:  FIRR and Sensitivity Analysis (%) \n\nPolonnaruwa  Overall \n\n8.0 \n1.6 \n \n6.8 \n7.2 \n7.8 \n\nBatticaloa  Hambantota  Muttur \n\nItem \nBase Case  \nWACC \nSensitivity \nRevenues (-10%) \nCapital (+ 10%) \nO&M (+10%) \nSensitivity Indicator \nRevenues (-10%) \nCapital (+ 10%) \nO&M (+10%) \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return, O&M = operation and maintenance, WACC = weighted average cost of \ncapital.   \nNote:  Sensitivity indicator (SI) = ratio of percentage change in FIRR to change in parameter. \nSource: TA3587-SRI: Secondary Towns Water Supply & Sanitation Project consultant\u2019s report. \n\n5.2 \n0.5 \n \n4.1 \n4.4 \n4.9 \n \n21.6 \n14.7 \n5.0 \n\n5.8 \n0.5 \n \n4.5 \n5.0 \n5.4 \n \n22.4 \n13.9 \n6.7 \n\n7.5 \n0.8 \n \n6.2 \n6.6 \n7.2 \n \n16.3 \n11.2 \n3.8 \n\n9.9 \n0.5 \n \n8.6 \n9.0 \n9.6 \n \n13.5 \n9.1 \n3.3 \n\n15.2 \n10.6 \n3.3 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\n \n1. \nAn  economic  assessment  was  undertaken  for  each  of  the  town  water  supply \ncomponents, for the rural water supply component, and for the sanitation components. For the \ntown water supply components, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) and the net present \nvalue were estimated and a sensitivity analysis undertaken. A poverty impact assessment was \nalso  undertaken  and  the  benefits  accruing  to  the  poor  estimated.  The  rural  water  supply \ncomponent has a sector-like approach; as such, the specific investments will be identified in the \ncourse of the Project, and so a specific economic analysis is not possible at this stage. Instead, \nthe  economic  analysis  considered  least-cost  technical  options,  and  identified  the  kinds  and \nscale of benefits that will be derived from the Project. The sanitation component is based strictly \non least-cost analysis of the minimally feasible alternatives. \n \n2. \nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  benefit  a  total  of  969,000  people  in  the  project  area.  The \nestimated  EIRR  for  the  town  water  supply  component  varies  from  12.7%  to  17.2%,  and  the \nprojected EIRR for the rural water supply component is 13.0%. The poverty impact ratio varies \nfrom 0.54% in Batticaloa to 2.20% for the rural component. Potential health benefits of improved \nwater  supply  have  not  been  explicitly  taken  into  account,  therefore  overall  benefits  may  be \nhigher than indicated in this analysis. Table A9.1 summarizes findings of the assessment.  \n \n\nTable A9.1: Summary of Economic Benefit Assessment \n\n \n\nSubproject \n\nNumber of \nBeneficiaries \n\nEIRR \n% \n\nNPV \n(SLRs million) \n\nBenefits to \nthe Poor \n\nBatticaloa Water Supply \nHambantota Water Supply \n\nMuttur Water Supply \n\nPolonnaruwa Water Supply \nRural Water Supply \n\n270,600 \n107,700 \n\n52,900 \n\n84,100 \n\n322,000 \n\n17.2 \n12.7 \n\n13.9 \n\n14.3 \n\n13.0 \n\n976.79 \n43.12 \n\n71.2 \n\n40.95 \n\n2.9 \n\n524.0 \n89.6 \n\n73.4 \n\n67.8 \n\n595.5 \n\nPIR \n% \n\n0.54 \n2.08 \n\n1.03 \n\n0.77 \n\n2.20 \n\nUrban Town Water Supply \n\n  EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value, PIR = poverty impact ratio. \n  Source: ADB estimates. \n \nA. \n \n3. \nExisting  Situation.  Project  towns  (Batticaloa,  Hambantota,  Polonnaruwa,  and  Matara) \nare considered major regional centers in Sri Lanka. Muttur is a smaller secondary town. Their \npopulations range between just under 50,000 to almost 300,000. With the security situation over \nthe last 20 years, Batticaloa and Muttur are particularly disadvantaged. In terms of piped water \nsupply,  in  Hambantota  approximately  30%  of  the  population  are  served,  less  than  50%  of  the \nurban population is served in Matara and Polonnaruwa, and in Batticaloa and Muttur virtually no \nhousehold has access to properly treated piped water supply. Most people in project towns rely \non groundwater for drinking and cooking. Groundwater quality in the project areas is poor and \nhigh  levels  of  fluoride  are  common  in  Anuradhapura,  Hambantota,  and  Polonnaruwa.  In  the \nmore  densely  settled  towns,  there  is  concern  regarding  pollution  of  wells  from  nearby  latrine \nsoakage  pits.  In  addition,  sand  river  extraction  and  upstream  irrigation  has caused increased \nsalinity in Matara and Muttur. Table A9.2 summarizes the situation found in each town.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n43 \n\n \nTable A9.2:  Project Towns \n\nItem \n\nBatticaloa  Hambantota  Matara \n\nMuttur \n\nPolonnaruwa \n\n2001 Population \n\n257,804 \n\n89,967 \n\n286,791 \n\n45,279 \n\n60,083 \n\nPopulation Growth Rate \n\nPopulation Without \nPiped Water \n\nAverage Monthly \nHousehold Income \n  Source:  ADB estimates. \n\n1.7% \n\n96.8% \n\n1.8 \n\n52.4% \n\n1.5 \n\n1.5% \n\n51.5% \n\n100.0% \n\n2.2 \n\n70.0% \n\n9,000 \n\n9,000 \n\n9,000 \n\n8,000 \n\n8,000 \n\n \nEconomic Benefits. Future \u201cwith- and without-project\u201d situations have been compared \n4. \nto derive the marginal benefits in terms of resource cost savings and consumer surplus from \nadditional water use with the Project. The benefits of the water supply subprojects are the value \nof  incremental  water  supply,  and  the  savings  of  time  and  cost  in  fetching,  carrying,  pumping, \npurchasing,  storing,  and  treating  water.  For  households  without  pumps,  which  is  the  majority, \nsurveys  in  Batticaloa  and  Polonnaruwa  indicated  that  households  spend  an  average  of  15 \nminutes  per  day  collecting  water  for  drinking  and  cooking.  The  economic  cost  of  time  was \nvalued at SLRs10 per hour, to which is added costs of replacement and repair of wells, bores, \njars, and buckets of SLRs475 per year. The Project is designed to provide up to 100 liters per \ncapita per day (lpcd), based on the Government service levels policy and the current average \nwater consumption in similar towns of 94\u2013127 lpcd. Surveys indicated that households currently \nuse up to 60 lpcd. Since the benefits of incremental water exceed the resource cost savings, a \nconservative  assumption  is  to  take  the  nonincremental  water  use  at  60  lpcd.  Nondomestic \nbenefits are assumed to be 1.25 times the domestic benefits per cubic meter. With nondomestic \nconsumption at 30% of domestic consumption, nondomestic benefits average about SLRs1,746 \nper household. \n \n5. \nThe Matara salinity barrier will not significantly increase the number of people connected \nto  the  system,  but  will  improve  the  quality  of  water  provided  to  current  users,  which  currently \ndoes not meet World Health Organization (WHO) standards when salinity intrusion occurs at the \nNadugala  intake.  The  discounted  present  value  of  losses  from  1  day  of  salinity  intrusion  each \nyear  is  about  SLRs2.6  million  at  12%  discount  rate.  An  average  of  50  or  more  days  per year \nwould  justify  the  construction  of  the  salinity  barrier  at  the  present  time.  Currently,  salinity \nintrusion takes place an average of 60 to 75 days a year, during the dry season. \n \n6. \nEconomic  Costs.  A  least-cost  assessment  of  project  options  for  each  town  was \nundertaken.  The  assessment  was  based  on  preliminary  cost  estimates,  and  associated \noperations  and  maintenance  (O&M)  cost.  Economic  costs  for  the  purpose  of  this  assessment \nare based on those used for the financial analysis. Financial costs (capital investment costs and \nO&M)  have  been  adjusted  to  economic  costs  by  deducting  duties  and  taxes  (value-added tax \nallowed at 10%) and applying a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.11 to the foreign component, \nand  a  shadow  wage  rate  factor  of  0.7  to  the  unskilled  labor.  To  convert  financial  costs  to \neconomic costs, the overall adjustment factor is 0.82.  \n \n7. \nSensitivity  Analysis.  The  sensitivity  of  the  results  was  tested  for  different  levels  of \ncapital cost, O&M, and benefits. Table A9.3 summarizes the extent to  which assumptions have \nto change in each town water supply subcomponent to drive the EIRR below 12%. The Project \nis most sensitive to the benefits accrued in the form of additional consumption and time savings. \nAn  increase  in  O&M  will  not  significantly  affect  any  of  the  subcomponents,  and  changes  in \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nnondomestic consumption proved to have little or no impact on the EIRR. An increase in capital \ncost is only a risk to the EIRR for Hambantota. \n \n\nTable A9.3:  EIRR Switching Values \u2013 Percentage Change in Parameters \nRequired to Reduce EIRR Below 12% \n \n\nParameter \n \nCapital Costs \nO&M Costs \nConsumption without project \nConsumption with Project \nTime Savings \n\nHambantota  \n% \n8 \n40 \n8 \n7 \n7 \n\nBatticaloa \n% \n67 \n400 \n49 \n37 \n35 \n\nMuttur \n% \n21 \n80 \n16 \n14 \n14 \n\nPolonnaruwa \n% \n30 \n95 \n20 \n19 \n19 \n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, O&M = operations and maintenance. \n\nUrban Town Sanitation \n\n  Source: ADB estimates. \n \nB. \n \n8. \nA least-cost analysis was done for each of the main urban sanitation activities, building \nof pit latrines for individual households without any sanitation, and a waste treatment plant for \nthe Batticaloa Hospital and prison. The proposed household sanitation for the urban component \nis  the  least-cost  technology  that  meets  the  requirements  of  the  Department  of  Health.  The \nselection  of  beneficiaries  and  subsidy  levels  is  the  same  as  that  used  in  the  rural  component; \ntherefore no separate analysis was undertaken. \n\n \nBatticaloa Hospital has 3,282 people who use, work on, or stay in 60 buildings within the \n9. \n8 hectares property of the hospital. It is planned to increase the capacity of the hospital by 2003 \nwith additional nurses, housing, and wards. The prison houses 363 people. Batticaloa hospital \nand the adjacent prison currently discharge their sewerage into septic tanks, which need to be \nemptied  periodically,  and  the  septage  is  disposed  of  near  the  garbage  dumpsite.  The  sludge \neffluent is disposed untreated into street drains, which flow into the Batticaloa Lagoon. Although \nthere are no national standards for discharge of wastewater from hospitals, main tolerance limits \nfor  domestic  effluents  discharged  into  marine  coastal  areas  are  not  met  by  the  effluent  from \noverflowing septic tanks. Because of the geology and the high density of population in the area, \nrehabilitation  of  the  septic  tanks  would  not  meet  the  requirements  for  discharge.  Although \npumping  and  treating  the  septage  could  be  done,  there  is  in  Batticaloa  no  adequate  septage \ntreatment available, making centralized treatment for the hospital the only alternative to ensure \nthe level treatment required for public health. \n\n \n10. \nThe  waste  treatment  plant  will  be  selected  based  on  least-cost  criteria,  with \nspecifications  of  the  amount  and  quality  of  effluent  to  be  treated  and  expected  quality  of  the \ndischarge. With the increase enforcement by the Central Environmental Authority, a number of \nlocal  firms  have  gained  expertise  in  construction  and  maintenance  of  wastewater  treatment \nplants, including package treatment plants, using anaerobic and aerobic treatments. Bidding for \nthis component will include evaluation criteria that emphasize capital cost investment as well as \nO&M to ensure that the least-cost technology is selected.  \n \n11. \nBroad estimations indicate that the town sanitation activities will benefit 32,500 people in \nthe  project  areas.  The  economic  benefits  of  sanitation  activities  are  difficult  to  measure,  but \ninclude improved health and welfare, as well as environmental benefits.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n45 \n\nRural Water Supply and Sanitation \n\nC. \n \n12. \nThe  rural  component  is  based  on  a  study  conducted  in  2001  conducted  by  Worley \nInternational of rural water supply and sanitation in Polonnaruwa district.1 The study included an \neconomic analysis, which is briefly described here. \n\n \n13. \nEconomic  Benefits.  The  rural  component  targets  322,000  beneficiaries\u2014161,000  in \nPolonnaruwa and 161,000 in Anuradhapura. It is proposed that water supply be improved for all \nthese population, and latrines will be provided for 124,000 households.  \n \n14. \nThe economic benefits of rural water supply improvement have been estimated following \nthe standard approach, by quantifying the resource cost savings and value of incremental water \nuse  provided  by  the  Project.  The  average  time  needed  to  collect  water  was  estimated  at  30 \nminutes per day. Nonincremental water use was estimated at 68 liters per capita per day, and \nincremental  water  use  was  projected  as  32  lpcd,  giving  a  total  water  use  under  the  project  of \n100 lpcd. Cost savings resulting from reduced use of water storage containers was estimated at \nSLRs5 per household per month.  \n \n15. \nThe Project is expected to significantly improve the health of beneficiaries, both from the \navailability  of  better  quality  water,  and  from  the  provision  of  sanitation  facilities.  The  health \nbenefits  may  be  substantial,  but  they  are  difficult  to  measure,  and  so  are  not  included  in  the \nbenefit-cost  analysis.  As  such,  the  benefit-cost  analysis  provides  a  conservative  evaluation  of \nthe net benefits of the Project. \n \nEconomic  Costs.  The  total  capital  investment  cost  proposed  in  the  Worley  report \n16. \nproject,  including  taxes  and  duties,  and  institutional  development  and  including  community \ncontributions,  is  SLRs1.678.5  billion,  of  which  SLRs475  million  are  community  contributions. \nO&M  costs  are  estimated,  on  average,  at  SLRs50  per  household  per  month.  Across  all \nhouseholds,  this  represents  about  SLRs36  million  per  year.  Maintenance  of  assets  is  likely  to \ncost  SLRs20  million  per  year.  Some  of  the  subprojects  will  entail  some  pumping  costs,  but  in \naggregate this will probably not exceed SLRs5 million per year. The financial cost estimate has \nbeen  adjusted  to  economic  costs  by  deducting  all  taxes  and  duties,  then  applying  a  shadow \nexchange rate factor of 1.11 to the foreign component and a shadow wage rate factor of 0.7 to \nunskilled labor.  \n \n17. \nEIRR.  The  specific  investments  to  be  undertaken  will  be  identified  in  the  course  of  the \nProject, and so a specific estimate of the EIRR is not possible at this stage. But based on the \nprojected number of beneficiaries, and assuming a constant rate of completion until the end of \nthe  Project,  the  EIRR  for  the  Project  would  be  13%.  In  the  rural  component,  the  total  capital \ninvestment  per  beneficiary  is  lower  than  that  used  by  Worley  International,  mainly  because  of \nsavings  gained  in  project  management  due  to  economies  of  scale.  However,  because  the \nbenefits  of  both  projects  are  expected  to  be  the  same,  the  EIRR  for  the  Project  should  be \nhigher. \n \nSensitivity  Analysis.  Table 9.4 shows the results of a sensitivity analysis. To drive the \n18. \nEIRR  below  12%,  capital  costs  would  have  to  increase  by  32%,  benefits  would  have  to  be \nreduced by 36%, or the lifetime of assets would have to fall by 25%. The economic basis of the \n\n                                                 \n1  The  Government  of  New  Zealand  provided  a  $500,000  grant  through  its  Asian  Development  Bank  Assistance \nFacility  for  preparing  a  preinvestment  study  for  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation  in  Polonnaruwa  District.  The \nreport was completed in January 2001. \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nIncrease in \nCapital Cost \n\nReduction in \nBenefits \n\nReduction in \nAssets Lifetime \n\nProject is therefore reasonably robust to adverse changes in the key components of the benefit-\ncost analysis. \n \n\nTable A9.4: Sensitivity Indicators and Switching Values \n\nParameter \n\nEIRR  NPV Before \n\nPercentage \nChange \n\nChange \n(SLRs\u2019000) \n\nNPV After \nChange \n(SLRs\u2019000) \n\nSwitching \nValue (SV) \n\nSensitivity \nIndicator \n(SI) \n\n+ 15 % \n\n13 % \n\n204,970 \n\n117,405 \n\n+ 32 % \n\n- 43 % \n\n-40 % \n\n11 % \n\n204,970 \n\n67,013 \n\n-36 % \n\n-47 % \n\n-10 % \n\n12% \n\n204,970 \n\n123,009 \n\n-25 % \n\n-40 % \n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \nSource: ADB estimates. \nNote:  NPVs and SVs are calculated at the 10% discount rate.  \n\n \n19. \nRural Sanitation. For the sanitation component, no useful data are available to estimate \nresource  use  savings  in  the  without-project  situation.  However,  an  average  willingness-to-pay \ncan be estimated, generally based on previous experience  of sanitation developments in other \nareas  of  Sri  Lanka,  adjusted  as  necessary  to  take  account  of  specific  conditions  in \nPolonnaruwa. This willingness-to-pay can then be taken as an approximation of the benefits that \ncan  be  attributed  from  the  sanitation  component  of  the  Project.  The  value  of  the  sanitation \nbenefits is assumed to accrue on completion of the sanitation facilities. Latrine owners will need \nto  pay  (or  contribute  labor)  for  ongoing  maintenance,  cleaning  (of  pits)  and  upgrading  of  the \nfacilities. This has been estimated as SLRs350/year, equivalent to the construction cost of the \nlatrine  depreciated  over  10  years.  Given  that  materials  form  approximately  50%  of  the \nhousehold  contribution  and  labor  the  remainder,  the  willingness-to-pay  for  sanitation  facility \nconstruction is estimated as follows:  \n \n\n  Materials contribution  \nSLRs1,750/household  \n \n  Labor contribution SLRs1,750 x 0.65 SWRF2   SLRs1,140/household  \n  Value of Sanitation Benefits  \nSLRs2,890/household  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n2   Shadow wage rate factor. \n\n-\n-\n-\n\fURBAN \nCOMPONENT  \n\nNational \nSteering \nCommittee \n\nDesign & \nSupervisio\nn \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFlow of funds \n \nCommunication & TA \n \n\nii. \n\n \n\n \n\nImplementation \n\nPolicy Guidance \n\nCoordination \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nNWSDB \n\n \n\nPMU \n\n \n\nManagement \n \nPIUs \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMH&PI \n\nNWSDB \nRWSS \nUnit \n\n \n\n \nTSUs \n\n \n\n \n\nPSIUs \n\n \nCBOs \n\nRURAL \nCOMPONENT  \n\nRWSS \nMH&PI \nDivision \n\n \nPPCU \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ni\n\nF\ng\nu\nr\ne\n \nA\n1\n0\n:\n \nI\n\nm\np\nl\ne\nm\ne\nn\nt\na\nt\ni\no\nn\nS\nt\nr\nu\nc\nt\nu\nr\ne\n \n\n \n\nI\n\nI\n\n \n\nM\nP\nL\nE\nM\nE\nN\nT\nA\nT\nO\nN\nS\nT\nR\nU\nC\nT\nU\nR\nE\nA\nN\nD\nS\nC\nH\nE\nD\nU\nL\nE\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n0\n\ni\n\n \n\n4\n7\n \n\nCBOs = community-based organizations, MH&PI = Ministry of Housing and Plantation Infrastructure, NWSDB = National Water Supply and Drainage Board, \nPIU  =  project  implementation  unit,  PMU  =  project  monitoring  unit,  PPCU  =  provincial  project  coordinating  unit,  PSIU  =  Pradeshiya  Sabha  implementation \nunit, RWSS = rural water supply and sanitation, TA = technical assistance, TSU = technical support unit. \n\n\f \n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\nQ1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3\n\n \n\n4\n8\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n0\n \n\ni\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\nT\na\nb\nl\ne\n \nA\n1\n0\n:\n \nI\n\nm\np\nl\ne\nm\ne\nn\nt\na\nt\ni\no\nn\nS\nc\nh\ne\nd\nu\nl\ne\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nProject Component\n\nLoan Period\n\nProject Management\n\nConsultant Selection\nConsultant Services\n\nWater Supply - Urban Schemes\nPreliminary and Final Design\nTendering and Evaluation\nConstruction and Commissioning\n\nUnnichchai Tank Raising\n\nPreliminary and Final Design\n\nTendering and evaluation\nConstruction and Commissioning\n\nRural Water Supply\n\nProject Commencement\nAwareness Program\nMain Implementation\n\nPolicy Reform/Institutional \nDevelopment\n\nPublic Awareness Campaign\n\nCorporate Strategy\nFinancial Mgt Strategy\nO/M Reduction Strategy\nAsset Registry\n\nStrategy to transfer water schemes\n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n49 \n\nCONTRACT PACKAGES \n ($ million) \n\nContract \n\nPackaging \n\nCost \nEstimate \n\nProcurement \nMethod \n\nCivil Works  - Head Works and Treatment \nUrban Water Supply \nSchemes \n\nUnnichchai  Tank \n \nSalinity Barriers \n \n\nCivil Works  - Distribution, Storage, and Drainage  \nUrban Water Supply \nSchemes \n \n\nPackage 1 \u2013 Batticaloa \nPackage 2  \u2013 Polonnaruwa and \nMuttur \nPackage 3 \u2013  Hambantota \n \nPackage 1\u2013 Batticaloa \n\nPackage 1 \u2013 Matara  \nPackage 2 \u2013 Hambantota   \n \n\nPackage 1 \u2013 Batticaloa \nPackage 2 \u2013 Muttur  \nPackage 3 \u2013 Polonnaruwa \nPackage 4 \u2013  Hambantota \n \nPackage 1 \u2013 Batticaloa Hospital \n \nPackage 1 \u2013 Batticaloa \nPackage 2 \u2013 Muttur \n\n \n\n5.

A  summary  IEE  can  be \nfound  in  supplementary  appendix  B.  All  the  subcomponents  are  undertaken  to  improve  the \nquality  and  security  of  water  supply  and  sanitation.  Most  IEEs  carried  out  for  each \nsubcomponent  showed  no  significant  environmental  effect.  Project  activities  that  may  have  a \nmarginally  significant  effect,  and  the  main  mitigation  measures  proposed,  are  summarized \nbelow.  \n \nB. \n \nBatticaloa. The raising by 1.5 meters of the Unnichchai water tank could create conflicts \n4. \nwith  other  users.  It  is  critical  to  ensure  participatory  planning  to  resolve  issues  and  examine \nalternatives to minimize disruption to farmers. An extra 5\u201310 meters from the current inundation \narea will be flooded. A detailed IEE will be carried out, examining the site of the dam area, the \ninundation  area,  the  affected  cultivated  areas,  and  immediate  river  valley.  Any  mitigation \nmeasures ensuing from the IEE will be included in the environmental management plan (EMP) \nand implemented. \n \nA  wastewater  treatment  plant  with  a  capacity  of  350  cubic  meters  per  day  will  be \n5. \nconstructed  for  Batticaloa  Hospital  and  the  adjacent  prison,  which  currently  discharge  their \nsewage and sullage effluent into Batticaloa Lagoon. Liquid biomedical waste is relatively small \nand  the  treatment  plant  will  have  the  appropriate  process  to  treat  it.  Under  Central \nEnvironmental  Authority  (CEA)  regulations,  the  sewage  treatment  plant  does  not  require  a  full \nIEE nor an environmental impact assessment (EIA) as its capacity is less than 500 cubic meters \nper  day.  A  supplementary  study  will  be  carried  out  during  detailed  design  to  ensure  that  all \nmitigation  measures  are  in  place  and  a  comprehensive  EMP  has  been  drawn  up  before  an \nenvironmental protection license can be issued. \n \n6. \nMuttur. High turbidity levels during the wet season and possible contaminants such as \nagro-chemicals may present a problem at the intake site. A long term water quality and quantity \nmonitoring program should be implemented at the proposed intake site, particularly for low flow \nevents.  Elephants  frequent  the  intake  site  during  the  dry  season;  therefore  the  intake \ninfrastructure will need to be designed to minimize potential damage to it by elephants. Special \nconsideration should be given to keeping workers and elephants apart during the construction \nperiod.  \n \n7. \nPolonnaruwa. Agro-industrial activities and uncontrolled solid waste management in the \nParakrama Samudra catchment area could pollute the tank water. Intermittent algal bloom have \nbeen  seen.  NWSDB  will  engage  the  assistance  of  CEA  and  local  catchment  management \nagencies  to  develop  and  implement  appropriate  catchment  and  water  source  improvement \nstrategies and a long-term water quality and quantity monitoring program.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n57 \n\n \n8. \nThough most of the proposed project infrastructure is in urban areas, well away from any \nhistorical  monuments  or  other  related  sites,  two  structures  (water  treatment  plant  and  2 \nkilometers of transmission line) will have to be carefully sited. The Archeological Authorities and \nthe Road Development Authorities have given their clearance for the two structures and it has \nbeen  agreed  that  NWSDB  will  work  closely  with  them  to  ensure  that  all  appropriate  and \nnecessary protective measures are in place to avert any damage to historical or archeological \nmonuments. \n \n9. \nHambantota. Upstream rice mill discharges into the Walawe Ganga and the presence of \nagro-chemicals are the main water quality concerns. Close monitoring by NWSDB and the CEA \nwill  be  required  to  prevent  any  upstream  pollution  of  the  raw  water  sources.  NWSDB  should \nparticipate  in  the  Mahaweli  Authority  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  Walawe  Ganga  catchment  management \nprocesses and establish a long-term water quality and quantity monitoring program. \n \n10. \nIncreased water extraction could allow saline water to intrude upstream from its existing \nlimit.  The  detailed  design  will  determine  whether  a  salinity  barrier  will  be  required  for \nHambantota. Should this be the case, a full IEE will be undertaken to ensure that all alternatives \nhave been investigated.  \n \n11.  Matara.  The  Matara  salinity  barrier  is  specifically  designed  to  enable  raw  water \nextraction  to  continue  during  low  flow  periods,  which  means  that  the  flow  of  fresh  water \ndownstream will be reduced. A conflict could arise if the reduction causes environmental flow in \nthe Nilwala Ganaga to drop to a level that results in adverse downstream environmental effects. \nCEA,  in  accordance  with  the  National  Environmental  Act,  has  requested  that  a  full  IEE  be \nundertaken to ensure that all alternatives have been investigated. The supplementary study will \nbe submitted to CEA and ADB for approval for the construction of the salinity barrier. \n \nRural Component, North Central Province. The schemes for the rural component will \n12. \ninclude  small  elements  such  as  dug  wells,  tubewells,  rainwater  collectors,  and  latrines.  These \nschemes  will  have  no  significant  environmental  effects.  A  selection  criteria  for  the  small \nschemes  has  to  be  established.  Once  the  communities  and  the  type  of  scheme  have  been \nselected, a screening will be done to determine whether an IEE or EIA is required. Based on the \nresults,  an  EMP  will  be  drawn  up  to  ensure  that  all  mitigation  measures  are  in  place  and \nimplemented.  \n \nGeneral  Potential  Environmental  Impacts.  All  sludge  generated  by  the  water \n13. \ntreatment  plants  will  be  treated  on  site,  and  not  off-site  discharges  will  occur.  To  ensure  the \nintegrity  of  the  treated  water  quality,  all  water  storages  will  be  roofed  and  ventilated,  and  the \nsystem operated to ensure that the distribution system is maintained under pressure. To ensure \nthe  health  and  safety  of  workers  and  the  public  are  not  affected  by  the  Project,  appropriate \ndetailed design and EMPs are to include a safe working environment to international standards, \ncoupled  with  appropriate  training  in  chemical  handling  and  mechanical,  electrical,  and  system \noperations.  \n \n14. \nDuring  construction,  there  will  be  some  minor  and  temporary  disruption  to  the \nsurroundings and environment. Potential environmental issues include soil erosion, siltation and \nincrease  in  runoff,  waste  and  effluent  from  temporary  construction  cam ps,  noise  pollution,  air \npollution  from  dust,  and  increased  traffic  congestion.  These  issues  will  need  to  be  minimized \nthrough  an  EMP  for  each  subcomponent  at  the  detailed  design  stage.  All  mitigation \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nInstitutional Requirement and Environmental M onitoring Program \n\nrequirements  will  be  included  in  the  contract  document  for  the  contractors,  and  for  sensitive \nareas a performance bond system might be included. \n \n15. \nEffective  monitoring  of  treatment  processes,  operation  and  maintenance  of  procedures \nand  daily  chlorine  residual  testing  will  be  instituted  to  ensure  safe  water  is  delivered. \nMicrobiological  testing  of  treated  water  will  also  be  done  periodically.  Structured  and  planned \npreventive  maintenance  programs  will  be  developed  for  all  facilities  constructed  under  the \nProject.  \n \nC. \n \n16. \nNWSDB  will  be  required  to  commission  a  detailed  EMP  for  each  project  component. \nImplementation  of  mitigation  measures  for  the  protection  of  the  environment  prior  to \nconstruction will be the responsibility of NWSDB and its district offices. A project environmental \nofficer  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  the  implementation  of  these  measures;  liaising  with \nlocal  community  groups,  the  CEA,  and  relevant  agencies  such  as  the  Archeology  Department \nand  the  Department  of  Wildlife  Conservation;  gathering  baseline  data;  and  providing  technical \nsupport.  Implementation  of  mitigation  measures  during  the  construction  stage  will  be  the \nresponsibility  of  the  contractor.  An  environmental  engineer,  who  will  be  hired  as  part  of  the \nconsultant  team  for  implementing  the  Project,  will  assist  NWSDB  in  preparing  contractual \ndocumentation so that the bidding documents, bills of quantity, and other contractual obligations \nof  contractor  clearly \nfor \nnoncompliance.  The  environmental  reports  will  be  submitted  to  local  environmental  agency \noffices  if  present  and  to  CEA  if  not,  according  to  the  engineering  phases  of  plant  construction \nand  pipe  laying.  NWSDB  will  be  responsible  for  overall  environmental  monitoring  and \nmanagement. The project implementation units and local government implementation units will \nbe  responsible  for  sending  quarterly  reports  to  the  project  monitoring  unit,  which  will  be  in \ncharge of consolidating the data and sending it on to ADB. \n \nD. \n \n17. \nThe  Project  will  improve  the  health  and  sanitation  of  the  communities.  The  IEE \nconcludes that an EIA will not be necessary based on the findings that the Project will not cause \nsignificant environmental problems and the potential adverse impacts are manageable through \nproper policy, planning, public relations, and good construction and supervision practices. CEA \napproval  is  being  sought  for  a  number  of  subcomponents  where  detailed  IEEs  are  currently \nbeing  prepared.  The  Project  has  sufficient  contingencies  should  CEA  require  additional \nmitigation measures to be put in place. However, no work will commence until the appropriate \napprovals from CEA and relevant authorities have been sought and granted.  \n \n\nidentify  environmental  responsibilities  and  describe  penalties \n\nConclusion \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 31 October 2002) \n", "Currency Unit \nSLRs1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "Sri Lankan Rupee/s (SLRe/SLRs) \n$0.010 \nSLRs96.25 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nBME \nCBO \nCEA \nEIRR \nEMP \nFIRR \nLCB \nLPCD \nMH&PI \nNGO \nNRW \nNSC \nNWSDB \nO&M \nOED \nPIU \nPMU \nPPMS \nPSIU \nSRPLA \nWACC \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n \u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nbenefit monitoring evaluation \ncommunity-based organization \nCentral Environmental Authority \neconomic internal rate of return \nEnvironmental Management Plan \nfinancial internal rate of return \nlocal competitive bidding \nliters per capita per day \nMinistry of Housing and Plantation Infrastructure \nnongovernment organization \nnonrevenue water \nNational Steering Committee \nNational Water Supply and Drainage Board \noperation and maintenance \nOperations Evaluation Department \nproject implementation unit \nproject management unit \nProject Performance Monitoring System \nPradeshiya Sabha implementation unit \nShort Resettlement Plan for Land Acquisition \nweighted average cost of capital \n", " \n \nGLOSSARY \n", " \n", "NOTES \n", "Pradeshiya Sabha \n", "\u2013 \n", "smallest political unit created under the Pradeshiya Sabha Act \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government of Sri Lanka ends on 31 December.
