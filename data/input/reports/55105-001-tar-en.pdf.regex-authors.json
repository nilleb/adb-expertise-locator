The Build Universal Health Care Program (Build UHC) follows a programmatic approach \nthat will provide long-term support to the government of the Philippines in sequencing and \nimplementing universal health care (UHC) policy reforms. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nwill specifically support implementation of the UHC Act1 by financing two subprograms with three \nkey areas for reform: (i) sustainable financing and strategic purchasing for UHC, (ii) integrated \ndelivery  of  quality  health  services,  and  (iii)  information  management  and  performance \naccountability for UHC.  \n \n2.  The program aligns with the country\u2019s development objectives of (i) health outcomes for \nall improved, (ii) health care for all Filipinos at all life stages guaranteed, (iii) a responsive and \nresilient health system ensured, and (iv) equitable health financing sustained.2 The program \noutcome will be equitable access to quality health services improved.  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  The Philippines has made significant improvements in health status in the past four \ndecades with life expectancy at birth improved from 63.7 years in 1980 to 71.2 years in 2018. \nDespite this, it continues to face ongoing and new health challenges with health outcomes still \nbehind compared to other countries in the region, especially as maternal mortality, infant mortality, \nand adolescent fertility remain high.3 Maternal mortality rate is at 121 per 100,000 livebirths in \n2017 compared to Malaysia (29), Thailand (37) and Viet Nam (43).4 Meanwhile, infant mortality \nrate is at 21.6 per 1,000 livebirths in 2019 compared to Malaysia (7), Thailand (8), and Viet Nam \n(16).5 Lastly, adolescent fertility rate is at 55 per births per 1,000 women aged 15-19 in 2019 \ncompared to Malaysia (14), Thailand (44), and Viet Nam (27).6 Its current health expenditure \n(CHE) remains low at 4.1% of gross domestic product in 2019 compared with the global average \nof 9.8% and the middle-income countries\u2019 average of 5.1% in 2018.7 Out of pocket spending for \nhealth in the Philippines remains high at 47.9% of CHE in 2019.8  \n \n4.  Major  health  system  constraints  include  insufficient  government  financing  and \nuncoordinated  health  purchasing,  inadequate  and  fragmented  health  services,  and  weak \ninformation management and accountability at the national and local government levels.9  These \nconstraints are highlighted in the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic by the \ninsufficient hospital treatment capacity, and uncertainty on paying COVID-19 healthcare costs.  \n \n1  Official Gazette. 2019.

With  a  whole-of-government  approach,  the  government  through  the  Department  of \nFinance (DOF) has requested ADB to support the implementation of the UHC Act through a series \nof logically sequenced policy reforms.10 This will be pursued and implemented by the Department \nof Health (DOH) and the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PHIC) with the support of DOF \nand other national government agencies, the local government units (LGUs), and the private \nsector. The updated Philippine Development Plan 2017\u20132022 aims to improve nutrition and health \noutcomes for all by pursuing and guaranteeing care at all life stages, ensuring responsive and \nresilient health system, and sustaining equitable health financing. 11 \n \n6.  The  government  is  mobilizing  increased  financing  for  health  care  to  make  PHIC \nmembership automatic and primary care services accessible for every Filipino. This includes \nincreasing the excise taxes from tobacco and alcohol products, and sweetened beverages \nearmarked for financing health interventions. It is also pooling financing for individual-based \nhealth services into the national health insurance fund, which will result in increased purchasing \npower of PHIC. At the local level, the different of sources of financing for health are being pooled \ninto Special Health Funds (SHFs). The SHFs can be established by a single LGU or groups of \nLGUs.   \n \n7.  The UHC policy reforms are expected to increase the quantity, efficiency, and quality of \nhealth facilities and health workers to deliver needed health services. This will improve access to \nquality health care for all Filipinos. It will ensure that they will not get into financial ruin while \naccessing health care service. All government health care providers of different levels of care are \nbeing integrated at the local level.  Private health care providers will eventually be integrated with \ngovernment providers into health care provider networks to enhance heath service delivery.  \n \n8.  The policy reforms are expanding access to primary care services, the delivery of health \npromotion services, and the use of health impact assessments of non-health sector development \nprojects. These will also enable interoperability of the health information systems, data collection, \nand management. Effective use of data and analyses will inform the health sector stakeholders, \npolicy decision-making, and implementation of UHC policy reforms. Moreover, the reforms in \nhealth  information  systems  will  help  hold  DOH,  PHIC,  LGUs  and  health  care  providers \naccountable for efficient management, quality of care, and improved health outcomes.   \n \n9.  The Build Universal Health Care Program\u2014subprogram 1 ($600 million) and subprogram \n2 ($400 million)\u2014will support policy reforms related to the UHC Act12 and provide budget support \nfor achieving the agreed policy actions. It will provide budget support for achieving agreed policy \nactions. It does not include financing for specific expenditure items and activities either the \nnational or local level. It will also not finance pilot evaluation studies, assessments, and other \ntechnical support which can inform and guide the government in crafting the policy measures.  \n   \n \n10 ADB. 2020.

Outputs and Activities \n \n10.  The proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) will have two key objectives: (i) \nsupport the pilot implementation of policy reforms achieved under subprogram 1 at the local level \nthrough select LGUs or groups of LGUs; and (ii) provide policy advisory and technical assistance \nto define and finalize substantive and logical policy measures for the subsequent set of UHC-\nrelated reforms under subprogram 2 (para. 9). The TA will build upon ongoing efforts of the \ngovernment to advance UHC in UHC Integration Sites (UHC-IS).13 These are LGUs or group of \nLGUs that have agreed with the DOH and the PHIC to adopt and implement UHC reforms at the \nsoonest possible time. The TA will select LGUs to be supported from among the UHC-IS.   \n \n11.  The TA will support three outputs that will strengthen national and local level UHC \nimplementation, and the crafting of additional key UHC policy measures. The sub-outputs and \nactivities intend to: (i) provide necessary advisory support, capacity building; and (ii) inform policy \ndialogue, and further define partnership framework between ADB and the government for health.  \n \n12.  Output 1: Increased financing and strategic purchasing for UHC strengthened.  This \noutput  will  support  increasing  the  financing  from  national  and  local  governments  and \nstrengthening government\u2019s strategic health purchasing capacities. The first set of activities will \ninvolve knowledge work and policy advisory support to (i) assess implementation polices; (ii) \nincrease funds for health at the national level; (iii) analyze health spending of LGUs; and (iv) \ndocument best practices. This includes  \n(i)  tracking the funding earmarked from excise tax collections of tobacco and alcohol \nproducts  and  sweetened  beverages,  and  mandated  transfers  from  lottery  and \ngambling revenues as well as tracking the attribution of the applicable funds to gender \nand development (GAD) plans, programs, activities, and projects;  \n(ii)  determining  and  analyzing  spending  of  all  LGUs  for  health  from  2017\u20132022, \ndisaggregating data by sex and type of service;  \n(iii)  identifying and sharing best practices in establishing and implementing the SHFs \namong UHC-IS;  \n(iv)  reviewing government spending for primary care from 2019, including sexual and \nreproductive health care services responding to the needs of women such as but not \nlimited to screening for cervical and breast cancers and other diagnostic tests for \nwomen, maternity care, and deliveries; and  \n(v)  assessing member and benefit coverage of private health insurances and health \nmaintenance organizations, and identifying policy alternatives and recommendations \non how to harmonize or complement coverage policies with those of PHIC.  \n \n13.  Drawing lessons from the first activity, the second set of activities will develop a tool or \nplatform for regular, timely updating, and accurate tracking and reporting of UHC financing. The \nthird activity will: (i) prepare the SHF operations manual and ensuring it is gender-responsive; (ii) \nincorporate guidance on strengthening expenditure management by LGUs of the SHFs; (iii) \nfacilitate mainstreaming of the manual; and (iv) organize knowledge sharing with other LGUs. The \nfourth activity will support crafting of implementation options of the National Health Financing \nStrategy.  The fifth activity is to support the design of national government incentives for LGUs \nwhich have organized health care provider networks and/or established special heath funds. The \nfinal activity will support DOH in improving its procurement processes including designing and \n \n13  DOH. 2020. Official List of Universal Health Care Integration Sites. Memorandum. 30 September 2020 (internal). \nLGUs to be supported under the TA will be selected from the 58 UHC Integration Sites identified in the Memorandum \nand in consultation with the DOH. \n \n ", "4 \nimplementing framework contracts and facilitating the digitalization of its procurement processes.  \nOutput 1 activities are estimated at $700,000. \n \n14.  Output 2: Quantity and quality of health facilities and workers increased. This output \nwill support the preparation of plans and strategies and conduct of capacity building to increase \nthe supply of health facilities and workers while improving the quality of services that they provide. \nThe activities will include: (i) preparing at least five gender-responsive local level Health Facility \nDevelopment Plans including geo-spatial maps for LGUs or groups of LGUs selected from the \nUHC-IS; (ii) preparing five gender-responsive local level Health Human Resource Strategies for \nLGUs or groups of LGUs selected from the UHC-IS; (iii) enhancing the online registry system for \nBarangay Health Workers (BHWs) at the national level; (iv) piloting implementation of BHW \nregistry system in at least 5 LGUs or groups of LGUs; and (v) designing gender-responsive \ncapability building, performance appraisal system, training modules, and digital health learning \nmaterials and platform (e.g., health promotion, literacy, health information management, public \nhealth threat surveillance, primary care modules) for BHWs. This output will require an estimated \n$700,000. \n \n15.  Output 3: Access to primary care and health promotion services expanded. This \noutput will support provision of the expanded PHIC primary care benefits and health promotion \nstrategy in at least five LGUs or group of LGUs. The activities will include: (i) identifying design \noptions to implement healthy cities, healthy workplaces, and other health promotion activities; (ii) \npreparing at least five gender-responsive local health promotion plans for province- and city-wide \nhealth system selected from the UHC-IS; (iii) developing gender-sensitive infographics and other \ncommunications to help LGUs implement the expanded PHIC primary care benefits and for PHIC \nmembers to access them; (iv) reviewing current online primary care services, and providing with \nrecommendations for improving the policy environment to further expand these online services; \n(v) reviewing existing primary care electronic medical records (EMRs) and health information \ninteroperability standards, and identifying policy options and recommendations on scaling up \nmeasures on the use of EMRs and interoperability standards; (vi) developing a gender-sensitive \nhealth promotion evaluation system to assess the impact and effectiveness of health promotion \nstrategies employed anchored on identified outcome measures; and (vii) developing a quality \nindicators  monitoring  toolkit  for  primary  health  care  and  linking  this  to  performance-based \nincentives. An estimated $600,000 will be needed to finance this output. \n \n16.  The TA will support health system innovations including EMRs, online registries of health \nworkers, and the online provision of primary care services. It will support the development of \nonline tracking tools of national and local government resource mobilization for health, and health \nspending. It will support geospatial maps of health facilities and will promote gender-responsive, \nclimate-smart, and disaster-resilient health facilities. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,050,000, of which $2,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The key expenditure \nitems are listed in Appendix 1. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of \ncounterpart staff, office space, office supplies, secretarial and coordination assistance, and other \nin-kind contributions. The government was informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB \nto finance any ensuing projects. \n \n \n \n ", "  5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n18.  The Department of Finance (DOF) will be the executing agency. ADB\u2019s Human and Social \nDevelopment Division (SEHS), Southeast Asia Department will administer the TA. ADB project \nteam consulted with the health teams at the Embassy of Japan in the Philippines and Japan \nInternational Corporation Agency. It was confirmed that there is no duplication between the \nproposed activities under the TA and their existing programs. It was suggested that the TA could \ncollaborate with JICA expert on addressing tuberculosis during the implementation. \n \n19.  The TA implementation will build on the coordination of the Build UHC program steering \ncommittee chaired by DOF and DOH. In addition, TA consultants will work with existing or planned \nDOH coordination mechanisms with relevant agencies including LGUs for various areas of UHC \nreforms. This includes the Bureau of Local Health Development coordination with the Department \nof Interior and Local Government (DILG) and LGUs on local-level UHC reforms including health \ncare provider networks and SHFs. This will also include the coordination led by the Health \nPromotion and Communications Services with DILG, LGUs and other national agencies on health \npromotion reforms. \n \n20.  ADB will work with the Bureau of International Health Cooperation of DOH and the \nInternational and Local Engagement Department of PHIC to maximize development partner \nsynergies. ADB will support the planned Philippine Health Development Cooperation mechanism \nwhich will guide the collaboration and partnership with international health partners (IHP) to \nensure alignment of development assistance with the health sector\u2019s thrusts, directions and \nprocesses, particularly the implementation of UHC. \n \n21.
