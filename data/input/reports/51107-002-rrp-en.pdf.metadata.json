It will enhance planning and delivering of essential PHC \nto  geographically  and  socioeconomically  deprived  populations  of  Central,  North  Central, \nSabaragamuwa,  and  Uva  provinces.  The  project  will  (i)  help  operationalize  the  government\u2019s \nPHC reform initiatives, (ii) improve underserved communities\u2019 access to primary health services, \nand (iii) address selected gaps in core public health capacities in line with the International Health \nRegulations (IHR).1  \n\n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT  \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nSri Lanka has made impressive gains in ensuring access and quality to health services \nfor all. Life expectancy at birth increased to 75 years in 2015 from 70 in 1990.2 Maternal mortality \nreduced from 75 to 30 per 100,000 live births and infant mortality from 17.9 to 8.0 per 1,000 live \nbirths during the same period.3 Sri Lanka has achieved these efficiently with low overall health \nspending at 3% of gross domestic product (GDP).4 Most vaccine preventable diseases are at \nnear elimination stage with immunization coverage at more than 99%.5 Sri Lanka has been polio-\nfree since 1994, and malaria- and filariasis-free since 2016.     \n\n \n4. \nAlthough  Sri  Lanka  made  significant  improvements  in  health  outcomes  during  the \nMillennium  Development  Goals  period  (1990 to 2015),  it  is  now facing new  health challenges \nrelated  to  population  aging,  changing  disease  pattern,  economic  and  social  changes,  and \nchanging lifestyles. These dynamics have resulted in a dramatic increase in noncommunicable \ndiseases (NCDs), which are causing a surge in demand for health services and an increase in \nhealth  care  costs  while  reemerging  and  emerging  communicable  diseases  remain  a  threat. \nDisparities  in  health  outcomes,  health-seeking  behavior,  life  expectancy,  and  disease  burden \nremain  in  lagging  geographic  areas  especially  in  rural  and  estate  sector  populations,  e.g., \nmalnutrition in mothers and children is a persistent health issue and more acutely seen in the \n\n                                                \n1  World Health Organization (WHO). 2005.

Government health spending is also low at 1.9% of GDP, \nwith most of the out-of-pocket spending borne by the higher wealth quintiles and partly because of strong preventive \nservices available universally. \n\n5   Government of Sri Lanka; Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine (MOHNIM); Medical Statistics Unit. \n\n2015.

Colombo. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nestate  sector.6  The  country  is  now  more  exposed  to  communicable  diseases  because  of \nincreased  labor mobility  and connectivity.  Sustaining  control  of  vaccine preventable diseases, \nmalaria  elimination  efforts,  and  containment  of  global  diseases  will  require  continuous \ninvestments in the prevention and control of communicable diseases and disease surveillance in \nSri Lanka.  \n \n5. \nPrimary health care delivery system. The public PHC system in Sri Lanka has been \ninstrumental in providing universal comprehensive care at no cost to the population at the point \nof  service delivery.  One of the most  characteristic features  of  the system  is  preventive health \ncare  services  focusing  on  communicable  diseases  control  and  maternal  and  child  care.  The \npreventive health system covers 341 geographic areas, each with a population of about 60,000. \nEach area is managed by a medical officer of health and served by 5\u201310 field health centers with \nmidwives,  public  health  inspectors,  and  preventive  health  care  staff.  In  parallel,  there  is  an \nextensive network of curative services in three tiers of care (955 PHC hospitals and dispensaries, \nand 149 secondary and tertiary health care hospitals). The government health sector provides \nas much as 90% of inpatient care, nearly 100% of preventive care, and 50% of outpatient care \n(footnote  5).  At  present,  the  health  system  planning,  policy,  and  stewardship  functions  are \ncentrally  managed  while  management  of  primary  and most  secondary  health care  services is \ndecentralized to provincial governments.7  \n \nConstraints. Since 1990, changing health challenges and population aging have led to \n6. \nprioritized  investments  for  secondary  and  tertiary  health  care  services  at  the  expense  of \ninvestments for primary curative and preventive care services. Deterioration of PHC facilities led \nto bypassing of primary curative care services for secondary and tertiary care for most health \nproblems  faced  by  the  population.  For  example,  secondary  and  tertiary  health  care  today \nmanage as much as 93% of childbirths, 75% of NCD patients, and 50% of outpatient services \n(footnote 5). On the preventive side, the medical officers of health continue to provide antenatal \ncare, nutrition, and immunization services. However, the quality of services decreased because \nof  lower  investments  (about  4.5%  of  public  health  spending),  inadequate  staffing,  and  other \nresource constraints. Expanded outreach and interventions for populations living in vulnerable \nand lagging areas are also hampered. Preventive health care services are limited to mothers and \nchildren and village environments. There is a need to expand the target group to include the total \npopulation (children, youth, adult men and women, and elderly) and expand coverage of NCDs.8    \n \n7. \nGovernment initiatives. The Government of Sri Lanka is reprioritizing PHC in line with \nits  national  health  policy  and  strategic  master  plan.9  Sector  reforms  aim  to  establish  a  more \nresponsive, patient-centered, and person-focused health care system. The system will enable \nhealth  seekers  to  access  a  comprehensive  package  of  essential  health  services  including \nfinancial  risk  protection.  The  government\u2019s  most  recent  policy  on  health  care  delivery  for \nuniversal health coverage provides the guiding framework to reform the existing PHC system.10 \n \n8. \nThe government is committed to develop a more comprehensive, accessible, and higher-\nquality  PHC  package  to  strengthen  PHC  services,  reduce  bypassing,  and  reach  vulnerable \n\n                                                \n6   The estate sector consists of all plantations, such as for tea, rubber, and coconut, which are 20 acres or more and \n\nwith 10 or more resident laborers under a single administration. \n\n7   The line ministry directly manages selected base hospitals, teaching hospitals, and specialized tertiary care hospitals. \n8   NCDs and their risk factors (diet, high blood pressure, smoking, physical inactivity) are reaching 76% of the total \n\ndisease burden. \n\n9   Government of Sri Lanka, MOHNIM. 2016.

It  is  also  committed  to  implement  e-health  to  strengthen  evidence-based  health \nservices.11 This includes scaling up the introduction of a patient e-health card, connecting health \nservices for referral and better patient care, and improving information on diseases and health-\nseeking  behavior  using  a  geographic  information  system  (GIS).  The  system  will  be  linked  to \ndisease  surveillance  for  national  health  security.  To  comply  with  international  standards \n(footnote 1),  the  government  aims  to  strengthen  the  health  assessment  of  migrants  and \nquarantine  services  at  ports  of  entry  (POEs). In support  of  efforts  to  strengthen PHC  and  the \ndigital  health  information  system,  policy  developments  are  in  preparation  for  the  essential \nservices  package,  health  human  resources,  family  medicine,  facility  norms,  and  testing \ninnovative  approaches  to  strengthen  PHC.  Capacity  building  will  also  be  implemented  in \nmanagement,  e-health,  quarantine  and  health  security,  procurement,  accounting,  gender, \nnutrition, and health care waste management.  \n \nValue added by ADB assistance.12 Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance brings \n9. \nvalue by (i) supporting equity-focused health care delivery reform especially in rural areas and \nthe  estate  sector  which  are  lagging  in  socioeconomic  and  health  indicators;  (ii)  adopting \nevidence-based planning based on GIS mapping13 and vulnerability index14 to identify and target \nunderserved  districts  and  populations;  (iii) enhancing  infrastructure  design  to  address  climate \nchange  and  disaster  risk  resilience;  (iv) scaling  up  e-health  card  and  its  integration  with  the \ngovernment\u2019s web-based health information system to improve continuity of care and disease \nsurveillance;  (v)  supporting  GIS  units  in  central  and  district  planning  departments  to  improve \ndisease surveillance and monitor health-seeking behavior; (vi) institutionalizing distance learning \nfor training PHC staff; and (vii) helping districts develop and implement innovative solutions to \nintegrate and improve PHC services.  \n \n10. \nLink to national development strategy and  ADB sector  priority. The project aligns \nwith the government\u2019s priorities identified in the Public Investment Programme, 2017\u20132020 and \nVision 2025, and with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3 on universal health \ncoverage.15 The project is in line with the objective of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Sri \nLanka to promote inclusiveness.16 \n\n \n11. \nADB experience and lessons learned. The project is ADB\u2019s reentry to the health sector \nin Sri Lanka after a gap of about 20 years. ADB\u2019s previous projects in the health sector were in \ngeneral successfully implemented.17 These past experiences and the project preparation process \nindicate  strong  commitment  by  the  government  at  the  national  and  regional  levels.

MOHNIM  convened  the  donor coordination  committee  to \n12. \nensure  collaboration  with  and  among  development  partners.  The  World  Health  Organization \n(WHO)  has  a  leading  role  in  policy  development  and  sector  coordination.  The  project  will \ncollaborate with WHO in terms of technical assistance to support selected areas related to the \nessential  services  package,  health  system  strengthening,  human  resource  development,  and \nhealth  security.  The  project  also  intends  to  work  with  the  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund \n(UNICEF) and the World Food Programme on nutrition, as well as the International Organization \nfor Migration on migrant issues. ADB\u2019s support will be coordinated with the World Bank program \nsupport to strengthen PHC, and regular discussions are held to prevent duplication of efforts and \nto synergize on the results and outcomes. \n \nB. \n \n13. \nSri Lanka\u2019s overarching development objective is a healthier nation that contributes to its \neconomic, social, mental, and spiritual development.18 The project is aligned with the following \nimpact: a healthier nation is ensured with a more comprehensive PHC system. The project will \nhave  the  following  outcome:  efficiency,  equity,  and  responsiveness  of  the  PHC  system \nimproved.19   \n \nC. \n \n14. \nin  Central,  North  Central, \nSabaragamuwa,  and  Uva  provinces;  (ii)  health  information  system  and  disease  surveillance \ncapacity strengthened; and (iii) policy development, capacity building, and project management \nsupported.  \n \n15. \nOutput 1: Primary health care enhanced in Central, North Central, Sabaragamuwa, \nand  Uva  provinces.20  Output  1  covers  four  sets  of  activities:  (i)  upgraded  curative  services, \n(ii) improved preventive services, (iii) public awareness to use PHC, and (iv) tested models for \nimproving PHC.21   \n\nThe  project  has  three  outputs:  (i)  PHC  enhanced \n\nOutputs \n\n \n16. \nFirst, the project will upgrade and rehabilitate 135 curative PHC facilities (primary medical \ncare  units  and  divisional  hospitals)  in  the  four  provinces,  supporting  equipment  for  improving \nlaboratory, emergency treatment, dental, and NCD-related clinical services. Second, the project \nwill (i) renovate and refurbish one field health center for preventive health for each of the 127 \nmedical officers of health in the four provinces, (ii) provide medical equipment for these centers, \n(iii) conduct staff training in nutrition counseling, and (iv) design community health and nutrition \npromotion. Third, the project will improve health-seeking behavior to use PHC by developing a \ncommunication strategy and implementing a communication campaign, which will include staff \ntraining,  health  promotion  materials,  and  outreach  activities.  The  campaign  will  inform  and \nencourage the community, adult men, and other groups to seek preventive and curative care at \n\n                                                \n18 Government of Sri Lanka, MOHNIM.

Finally, the project will support testing models whereby provincial and \nregional health staff propose and implement strategies to improve PHC under a PHC innovation \nfund. In the final years of project implementation,  successful initiatives will be incorporated as \nnational reforms to improve PHC services in Sri Lanka.  \n \n17. \ninformation  system  and  disease  surveillance  capacity \nstrengthened. Output 2 covers two sets of activities: (i) health information technology for better \ncontinuity of care and disease surveillance, and (ii) implementation of IHR recommendations for \nPOEs and inbound health assessment services.  \n\nOutput  2:  Health \n\n \n18. \nFirst,  the  project  will  strengthen  the  medical  information  system  to  provide  real-time \nsharing  of  health  information  vertically  and  horizontally  across  health  facilities  and  across \ndifferent episodes of patient care. This will help enhance the referral system and quality of patient \ncare, and establish a system of continuity of care for health seekers. The enhanced information \nsystem will include disease surveillance and GIS mapping functionalities for timely reporting of \nthe  28  notifiable  diseases  of  Sri  Lanka  to  enhance  health  security.  To  improve  PHC,  overall \nsector efficiency, and reduce duplications in service delivery, the medical information system will \nlink primary-level curative facilities to higher-level hospitals to track and refer patients. Second, \nthe  project  will  implement  IHR  recommendations  to  strengthen  core  capacities  for  POEs  and \ninbound health assessment by (i) providing equipment required to meet core capacity levels at \nall eight POEs, (ii) enhancing the mobility of the quarantine unit at two designated ports in Sri \nLanka, (iii) strengthening the web-based surveillance system for notifiable diseases managed by \nthe quarantine unit, (iv) providing support for training health personnel on using the quarantine \nmanual,  surveillance,  and  vector  control;  and  (v)  supporting  the  review  and  development  of \ninbound assessment guidelines for the new inbound migrant screening facility. \n \n19. \nOutput  3:  Policy  development,  capacity  building,  and  project  management \nsupported. Output 3 will support policy and strategy development for comprehensive PHC and \ncontinuum  of  care,  especially  for  vulnerable  groups  living  in  plantations,  and  with  priority  to \nnutrition.

Overall, the project is economically viable with an estimated internal \nrate of return of 14% and a net present value of $42.9 million. The economic benefits include \n(i) the direct benefit for project beneficiaries in health care cost savings, and (ii) productivity gains \nin terms of disability-adjusted life years averted. The main economic costs include (i) investment \ncosts,  such  as  construction  and  upgrading  of  health  facilities  and  purchase  of  equipment; \n(ii) indirect  project-related  costs,  such  as  maintaining  and  replacing  capital  investments;  and \n(iii) operational costs, such as wages and utilities required to run health facilities. Additionally, \neconomic benefits of health interventions accrue overtime; improved population health can lead \nto increased productivity and GDP growth in the long run.  \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nGovernance  \n\nFinancial sustainability. Financial sustainability of the project depends on the ability of \n26. \nMOHNIM to allocate sufficient budget overtime and efficiency gains in the health sector. While \nthe government is undergoing macroeconomic reforms because of its sizeable public debt, it is \nexpected  to  continue  its  commitment  to  the  health  sector  as  indicated  under  Vision  2025 \n(footnote 15) and to prioritize the health sector through adequate budget support. The project \nannual commitment over 5 years is only 0.8% of the total health sector budget (MOHNIM and \nprovinces) for 2018 and to extend the project 1 year beyond the project period would require only \n0.3%  of  total  health  sector  budget  for  2018.  As  provided  in  the  draft  loan  agreement,  the \ngovernment will ensure adequate funds towards operations and maintenance of project facilities \nwill be provided to MOHNIM during and after project implementation. MOHNIM\u2019s budget has also \nbeen increasing in absolute terms since 2014 and is expected to continue its upward trend; the \nhealth  budget  increased  by  26.5%  from  2014  to  2015  and  by  34.2%  from  2015  to  2016. \nMOHNIM\u2019s  recurrent  budget  (69.6%)  is  also  higher  than  the  capital  budget  (30.4%)  in  2016, \nindicating government financial commitment to maintain capital investments. Efficiency gains are \nexpected across the sector because of PHC reform initiatives, which will shift management of \nexpensive NCDs from secondary to primary levels and encourage long-term cost containment. \nThis will increase the fiscal space for health in the long run and encourage more efficient and \noptimal use of existing resources in the health sector. \n \nB. \n \n27. \nFinancial  management.  A  financial  management  assessment  conducted  for  the \nexecuting agency and implementing agencies concluded that the overall pre-mitigation financial \nmanagement  risk  is  substantial.  The  key  risks  identified  are  (i)  delay  in  release  of  fund  from \ndifferent fund sources, (ii) MOHNIM not familiar with ADB procedures, and (iii) limited resource \nin  internal  audit.  To  mitigate  these  risks:  (i)  cost-sharing  arrangements  will  be  avoided, \n(ii) capacity building support will be provided to PMU and PIU accounting staff, and (iii) internal \nauditor  will  be  recruited.  The  borrower,  executing  agency,  and  implementing  agencies  have \nagreed to implement the risk mitigating measures identified in the financial management action \nplan of the PAM so that the overall financial management risk of the project will become moderate \n(footnote 22).  \n \nProcurement. Procurement capacity and management risks at the central and provincial \n28. \nlevels  are  assessed  as  moderate.  The  common  finding  was  that  while  the  executing  and \nimplementing  agencies  are  well-versed  with  the  national  procurement  guidelines  and  have \nexperience in implementing development partner-funded projects, they have limited experience \nwith  ADB  procurement  practices.  To  mitigate  this  risk,  the  project  will  implement  systematic \nprocurement training to augment staff capacity in procurement and compliance monitoring. The \nproject will also improve procurement transparency by setting up a project-specific webpage on \nthe MOHNIM website wherein contract information as well as information relating to procurement \nprocesses will be uploaded.  \n\n \n29. \nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  MOHNIM.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 22).  \n \nC. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender  \n \nPoverty in Sri Lanka is more relative than absolute; 4.1% of the country\u2019s population are \n30. \ndeemed  to  be  below  the  national  poverty  line  while  the  selected  four  provinces  show  higher \npoverty  rates:  Central  (5.4%),  Sabaragamuwa  (6.7%),  and  Uva  (6.5%)\u2014with  North  Central \n\n\f9 \n \n\nSafeguards  \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\n \n(3.3%)  being  an  exception.25  Despite  following  a  path  of  inclusive  development,  regional \ndisparities remain, and are particularly evident in access, utilization, and service provision related \nto PHC. The country\u2019s changing epidemiological profile has presented a unique challenge to the \nexisting system of non-fee-based universal health care. Capitalizing on the country\u2019s extensive \nPHC network, the project will support poverty reduction and strengthen human capital through \nimprovements in both curative and preventive health care.  \n \n31. \nThe  project  has  been  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming  because  the  project \noutputs  are  designed  to  advance  both  women\u2019s  and  men\u2019s  access  to  health  services  and \ninfrastructure,  which  in  turn  will  help  promote  gender  equality.  Some  interventions  include \ngender-responsive  construction  features  (separate  toilets,  private  examination  and  changing \nrooms); gender-responsive and inclusive essential service package; sex-disaggregated data in \nhealth information systems; and training for medical officers and PHC staff on gender sensitivity, \ngender-related policies, and interventions.  \n \nD. \n \n32. \ncategories are as follows. 26 \n \nEnvironment (category B). The project will support minor renovations and expansion of \n33. \nPHC  facilities  as  well  as  small  repairs  to  field  health  centers.  It  is  not  expected  to  have  any \nsignificant or irreversible adverse environmental impacts during either construction or operation. \nAny  environmental  risks  can  be  effectively  mitigated  through  the  adoption  of  appropriate \nmitigation measures specified in the environmental assessment and review framework. An initial \nenvironmental examination and an environment assessment and review framework have been \nprepared covering 45 primary medical care units and both documents were disclosed on the ADB \nwebsite on 31 July 2018. The executing agency has adequate institutional capacity to carry out \nenvironmental safeguards and compliance measures, along with capacity development activities \nto manage related risks. \n \n34. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  C).  Civil  works  are  limited  to  reconstruction  and \nrefurbishment  of  existing  government  health  facilities,  which  does  not  necessitate  land \nacquisition and resettlement. No temporary involuntary resettlement impacts are anticipated. \n \nIndigenous peoples (category C). Physical parameters of the project are confined to \n35. \nexisting health care facilities and do not include habitats and territories with indigenous peoples. \nProject activities will not affect traditional and sociocultural beliefs of indigenous peoples. \n\n \nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan  \n\nE. \n \n36. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk mitigation plan.27  \n \n\nSignificant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in  Table 4 and described in \n\n                                                \n25 Government of Sri Lanka, Department of Census and Statistics. 2017.
