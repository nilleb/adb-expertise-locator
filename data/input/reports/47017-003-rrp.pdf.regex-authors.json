THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan  for  the Wholesale  Metering  and  Transmission  Reinforcement \nProject.1 \n \n2.  The project will improve electricity supply to households and industries in Tajikistan. The \nproject will reduce losses through metering entire high- and medium-voltage transmission grid \nand  expand  transmission  capacity  in  Panjakent  region,  which  presently  suffers  from  load \nshedding.2  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The performance of vertically integrated state-owned joint stock company Barki Tojik, \nwhich is responsible for electricity generation, transmission, and distribution in Tajikistan, is \nunsatisfactory. The corporate governance is weak, the financial management is not sustainable, \nthe  company  structure  is  inadequate  and  the  quality  of  the  service  is  poor.  These  are \nexacerbated by a flawed initial power system design that ignores energy security considerations \nas well as limited investments for modernization made during the country\u2019s civil war. \n \n4.  Realizing  that  poor  performance  of  the  power  sector  was  impeding  economic \ndevelopment, the government initiated a three-phase restructuring process (commercialization, \nseparation, and privatization)  of Barki Tojik in 2011. The first phase, commercialization, is \nsupported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) through the sector operational performance \nimprovement (SOPI) program.3 The program addresses governance, financial management, \ncontrol  and  audit,  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks,  management  systems,  organizational \nstructure,  and  technical  operations.  On  11  June  2013,  the  government  approved  the \nrestructuring action plan prepared by the SOPI program and the new structure of Barki Tojik, \nwhich  established  three  departments  (generation,  transmission,  and  distribution)  under  the \nsame legal entity. On 5 September 2014, Barki Tojik formally adopted the new structure and \ntechnical separation principle between departments. Heads of the three departments have also \nbeen appointed, and formation of the new structure, based on international practices of modern \npower utilities, is ongoing. The implementation of the full-scale management contract is also \nbeing discussed between the government and international financial institutions, including ADB. \n \n5.  Improving the operational performance of Barki Tojik requires not only organizational \nrestructuring but also  capital investment. While the entire sector needs to be modernized, \ninvestments in loss reduction are a priority.4 Tajikistan\u2019s power system has an installed capacity \nof 5,356 megawatts (MW) comprising eight large and a few small hydropower plants (4,737 \nMW), and three fossil fuel-fired combined heat and power plants (418 MW). In 2013, net power \ngeneration in Tajikistan was 16.9 terawatt-hours, of which only 13.4 terawatt-hours were billed. \nThe difference is  losses and system own consumption. Total transmission and distribution \nsystem  losses  in  Tajikistan,  as  in  any  power  system,  are  a  combination  of  technical  and \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for the project.

Technical Assistance for Power Sector Regional Master Plan. Manila. \n ", "2        \nnontechnical (or commercial) losses.5 Both types of losses are a cost to Barki Tojik, as they \nreduce the amount of electricity for which payment is received from customers. \n \n6.  Total transmission and distribution system losses in Tajikistan are estimated at around \n22%, of which transmission system technical losses accounted for 5% in 2013.6 Distribution \nsystem losses are 17% and have remained virtually unchanged since 2006. Barki Tojik does not \nrecognize commercial losses and therefore applies norms for technical losses to the amount of \nenergy received into the distribution networks from transmission. These are inaccurate figures \nand  understated  due  to  the  absence  of  proper  methodology  to  account the  losses  and a \nrelevant metering system. A wholesale metering system with sufficient accuracy for commercial \nbilling has never been installed in Tajikistan, and the absence of such a system results in \ninaccurate cost calculations and cost recovery tariff calculations. \n \n7.  Reduction of nontechnical losses is a priority for the government, which has already \nbegun to address the issue. The turnkey contract for installation of a supervisory control and \ndata  acquisition  system  and  associated  telecommunication  system, financed  by  ADB,  was \nawarded  in  September  2014  (footnote  3).  The  World  Bank  and  the  European  Bank  for \nReconstruction and Development are financing the installation of the retail (end user) meters in \nthe two largest load centers\u2014Dushanbe and Khujand. The remaining metering gap is bulk \nelectricity metering from generation through transmission and up to distribution level meters. \nThere is a need for the installation of wholesale meters and an associated settlement system, \nwhich will enable the management of Barki Tojik to (i) account for all electricity flows and \nassociated costs; (ii) quantify technical and nontechnical losses at the wholesale level of the \nentire  grid;  and  (iii)  support  the  utility  restructuring  by  defining  clear  commercial  borders \nbetween generation, transmission, and distribution. \n \n8.  Certain parts of the Tajikistan power system still suffer from transmission bottlenecks. In \nsome  regions,  current  demand  is  not  met  due  to  limited  transmission  capacity  and \ndisconnection from the Central Asian Power System in November 2009. Presently, the most \npressing problem is in Panjakent region, which has a population of 261,000 (39,122 customers) \nand several large industries. The demand in the region has grown steadily since 2005, with \npeak demand in 2013 reaching approximately 100 MW in the summer and 141 MW in the winter. \nHowever, electricity to Panjakent (through the Rudaki substation) has been supplied since 2011 \nfrom the main Tajik grid (through the 220-kilovolt [kV] Ayni substation) by a single circuit 110 kV \ntransmission line commissioned in 1965 with a rated capacity of 67 megavolt-amperes (MVA).7 \nThus, households and industry in the region suffer from frequent load shedding even during the \nsummer,  which  is  Tajikistan\u2019s  energy  surplus  period  due  to  98%  reliance  on  hydropower \n                                                \n5  Technical losses occur naturally and consist mainly of power dissipation in electricity systems. They are a measure \nof the amount of energy injected into the system (transmission or distribution), less the amount of energy offloaded \nfrom that system. They exist as a result of losses through the lines, the transformers, and associated systems (bus \nbars, circuit breakers, metering, and connections), and they are usually expressed as a percentage of the total \nenergy injected onto the system. Combined transmission and distribution losses can range from 8% to 10% in \ndeveloped modern power systems to over 40% in overloaded, poorly maintained systems in need of rehabilitation. \nCommercial losses result from inaccurate calculation of technical losses, unauthorized use of electricity (theft), \nfaulty meters, unmetered supplies, unbilled customers, inaccurate billing of customers, dishonest staff, and \nnonpayment of electricity bills. They are a measure of the amount of energy injected into the system, less technical \nlosses and the amount of energy that is paid for. These losses are usually expressed as a percentage of total \nenergy entering the system, and they range from 2% to 3% in an organized modern utility company. \n6  SOPI program consultants estimate. \n7  Until 2011 the Panjakent electrical network was still supplied with two 220 kV lines with a rated capacity of 320 \nMVA each from Uzbekistan despite the 2009 disconnection from the Central Asian Power System. In 2011, Barki \nTojik completed the construction of a new 220/110 kV substation and energized an old 110 kV line to supply \nPanjakent. \n ", "3 \ngeneration. Additional transmission capacity is urgently needed in Panjakent to satisfy current \nand future power demand, which is expected to grow to 187 MW by 2020 due to planned \nindustrial development. \n \n9.  ADB operations in the power sector have been based on government priorities and are \naligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020  and  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership \nstrategy, 2010\u20132014 for Tajikistan.8 The project is included in the country operations business \nplan, 2014\u20132016 for Tajikistan.9 It will be the seventh project intervention in the power sector of \nTajikistan. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The impact of the project will be improved electricity supply to households and industry \nin  Tajikistan.  The  outcome  of  the  project  will  be  an  expanded  and  metered  transmission \nnetwork. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n11.  The outputs of the project will be (i) installation of approximately 1,100 wholesale meters \nand an associated settlement system including approximately 1,100 current transformers and \n700 voltage transformers; and (ii) construction of an approximately 95-kilometer (km) new single \ncircuit, single conductor 220 kV transmission line connecting Rudaki and Ayni substations with a \nrated capacity of 320 MVA. \n \nD.

The \ngrant will be onlent to Barki Tojik through a subsidiary loan agreement to fund the investments. \nThe onlending is for a term of 25 years, with a 5-year grace period and an interest rate of 5% \nper annum. Barki Tojik will be responsible for foreign exchange risks, an established practice \nbetween the Ministry of Finance and Barki Tojik. The government will contribute $8 million. For \nits contribution, the government will either (i) allocate additional funds from the budget to cover \nvalue-added tax and customs duties accrued on project expenditures, or (ii) exempt the project \nfrom such taxes and duties.

The executing agency will be the power utility Barki Tojik. The project will be managed \nby an independent project management unit (PMU) that coordinates and implements power \nprojects funded through  loans  and grants from  bilateral  donors  and  international financing \ninstitutions. The PMU has performed satisfactorily in implementing six previous ADB projects.11 \n                                                \n10 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 ADB. 2000.

Two turnkey engineering, procurement, and construction contracts covering the entire \nproject will be procured by Barki Tojik. Procurement will follow international competitive bidding \nprocedures  using  standard  bidding  documents  for  plant  design,  supply,  and  installation \ncontracts. Engineering, procurement, and construction contracts will use a single-stage: two-\nenvelope  bidding  procedure  with  prior  review  and  without  prequalification.  The  project \npreparatory  technical  assistance  consultants  will  assist  the  PMU  in  preparing  bidding \ndocuments and bid evaluation, and will also provide hands-on training to the PMU procurement \nstaff (footnote 2). \n \n18.  Barki Tojik will employ a project implementation consultant firm that will provide technical, \nfinancial, and administrative support to the PMU during the entire project implementation period. \nADB grant proceeds will cover the cost of this consulting service and recruitment will follow \nADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The quality- \nand cost-based selection method with a quality:cost ratio of 90:10 will be applied to the selection \nof the consultant firm. ADB's prior approval is needed for changing the selection method. \n \n19.  To  expedite  project  implementation,  ADB  has  approved  advance  contracting  for \nconsulting services. Advance contracting allows the government to start procurement activities \nat its own risk prior to the signing of the grant agreement, but it does not allow signing a contract \nwith a firm before the grant has become effective. ADB informed the government that such \nadvance contracting (including advertising) must comply with the Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants.12 \n \n20.  The project will be implemented over a 55-month period from April 2015 to October \n2019. The implementation consultant will prepare a detailed implementation schedule during the \npreconstruction phase of the project and submit it to ADB. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n21.  ADB  conducted  in-depth  technical  due  diligence.  The  inspection  work  included \nassessments of (i) the existing metering and billing system; (ii) the accuracy, class, and age of \nmeters; (iii) the condition and accuracy of current transformers and voltage transformers; (iv) \nexisting  and  planned  communication  systems;  (v)  ongoing  end  user  metering  and  billing \nprojects; (vi) specifications and interface of the selected supervisory control and data acquisition \nsystem; and (vii) the condition of the transmission equipment in substations in Rudaki and Ayni \nand various alternative routes for the line. Various cost estimation methods were used to obtain \n                                                                                                                                                       \nDirectors: Proposed Loans, Technical Assistance Grants, and Administration of Loan to the Islamic Republic of \nAfghanistan and the Republic of Tajikistan for the Regional Power Transmission Interconnection Project.

Manila. \n12 ADB also informed the government and Barki Tojik that approval of advance contracting does not commit ADB to \nfinance the proposed project and that ADB will not finance any expenditures paid by the government prior to grant \neffectiveness. \n ", "6        \nup-to-date quotations for equipment. The project implementation schedule was prepared taking \ninto account the demand profile to minimize impact from disconnections. \n \n22.  Investment sites were visited by consultants and ADB staff. ADB is satisfied with the \nquality of the cost estimates, cost structures, appropriateness of the technology, and execution \nplan. The readiness level is high and the proposed technical solutions are assessed to be more \ncost-effective than the alternatives. Barki Tojik\u2019s operation and maintenance staff is familiar with \nthe proposed design concepts. The proposed metering and settlement system is consistent with \nexisting practices. However, it will be more advanced and employ state-of-the-art technology \nthat will require training to be included in the terms of reference for consultants and contractors. \nThis is routine practice for a utility when first implementing similar systems. \n \n23.  Tajikistan is exposed to climate change risks and variability. It is vulnerable to extreme \nweather  events  such  as  flooding  and  mass  movements.  The  project  has  taken  into \nconsideration relevant climate measures (e.g., improved tower standards, avoidance of areas \nprone  to  mass  movements).  The  contractor  will  be  required  to  undertake  additional  soil \ninvestigations to avoid locating the towers on unsafe grounds. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n24.  The project\u2019s economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 19.2%, confirming the project\u2019s \neconomic viability. The project will reduce system losses and increase the electricity consumed \nin the country. The project\u2019s incremental cost streams (i.e., capital investment and operation and \nmaintenance [O&M]), which reflect the costs of delivering the expected benefits (i.e., increased \nnet electricity consumption), were compared with a without-project scenario based on 2014 \nconstant prices for the project life of 25 years. The without-project scenario assumes that Barki \nTojik does not implement wholesale metering or reinforce the power transmission capacity \nenvisaged  under  the  project.  The  EIRR  was  estimated  for  each  component  and  was \nconsolidated for the project.13 The sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of the project\u2019s \neconomic viability under adverse conditions, including increased capital and O&M costs, and \nreduced benefits. \n \n25.  The financial analysis confirms the financial viability of the project. The financial internal \nrate of return of 15.8% is higher than the weighted average cost of capital of 2.3%. Based on a \ncomparison of the with-project and without-project scenarios, the project cash flow, measured at \n2014 constant prices for the project life of 25 years, reflects the costs (capital investment and \nO&M) and revenues (domestic sales) attributable to the project from Barki Tojik\u2019s perspective.14 \nThe project remains financially viable under the assumption that the end user tariffs continue to \nincrease at the current rate of 13% per annum in real terms. The sensitivity analysis also \nconfirms the project\u2019s financial sustainability under adverse conditions. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n26.  ADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and Barki Tojik. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any allegedly corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of the Anticorruption Policy are included in the \ngrant regulations and the bidding documents. All contracts financed by ADB in connection with \n                                                \n13 EIRR is 29.9% for the wholesale metering component and 15.1% for the transmission component. \n14 Financial internal rate of return is 18.8% for the wholesale metering component and 14.4% for the transmission \ncomponent. \n ", "7 \nthe project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records \nand accounts of the executing agencies and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other \nservice  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  project.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 10). \n \n27.  The recent financial performance of Barki Tojik has been weak and unstable, generating \nlosses for FY2007\u2013FY2009, profits for FY2010\u2013FY2011, and losses again in FY2012.15 Barki \nTojik\u2019s financial management capacity requires significant improvement. External auditing for \nFY2011  and  FY2012  based  on  international  audit  standards  indicate major  issues  with (i) \nvaluation  of  inventory,  (ii)  revaluation  of  assets,  (iii)  records  on  account  receivables  and \npayables,  and  (iv)  data  reconciliation  of  revenues. 16  Barki  Tojik\u2019s  accounting  policies, \nprocedures, and financial reporting follow International Financial Reporting Standards, which is \nrequired under the Law of Accounting and other decrees of the government.17 Each of the 30 \nsubordinate entities under the head office prepares its own financial report, and these are \nconsolidated at the holding company level. Barki Tojik has an internal audit unit established at \nthe  head  office,  but  with  limited  independence.  External  independent  auditors  have  been \nengaged  to  undertake  auditing  based  on  international  auditing  standards  for  the  holding \ncompany in compliance with the statutory requirements.18 \n \n28.  Substantial efforts are being made to strengthen the financial management capacity of \nthe power utility. In 2011, the government initiated a comprehensive program to restructure \nBarki  Tojik.  ADB  provided  support  through  the  SOPI  program  to  improve  the  commercial \noperations and financial performance of the utility, and to strengthen its capacity to service debt \nwhile providing high-quality services as referred to in paragraph 4. SOPI program includes \ninstitutional strengthening and reorganization of Barki Tojik using a phased approach (phase 1 \ninvolves sector assessment, phase 2 preparation of a detailed restructuring plan, and phase 3 \nthe restructuring itself). The program addresses governance, financial management, control and \naudit, legal and regulatory frameworks, management systems, and organizational structure. In \naddition,  the  program  will  deal  with  technical  operations  and  planning  to  optimize  future \ninvestments and allocate sufficient funds for system maintenance. It will also address corporate \nfinancing, debt management, and debt restructuring. SOPI program consultants have already \nrevised existing tariff methodology and started to develop new tariff structures for generation, \ntransmission, and distribution departments. Installation of the wholesale metering system will \nenable proper cost accounting, which is necessary to determine the cost recovery tariff level. \n \n29.  On 11 June 2013, the government approved (i) the assessment report prepared under \nthe SOPI program; (ii) the intervention plan prepared by the SOPI program consultants; and (iii) \nthe  new  structure  of  Barki  Tojik,  with  three  departments  (generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution) under the same legal entity. The detailed restructuring plan was completed and \napproved on 5 March 2014. The milestones have been set for the formation of the departments \nunder  the  new  structure  and  appointment  of  personnel.  The  entire  process,  including \nappointment of staff in regional offices, is expected to be completed by 1 May 2015. The \n                                                \n15 Details of the financial position of Barki Tojik are in the Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2). ADB is in dialogue with the government to soften the onlending terms (para. \n13), which will contribute to improving the financial position of the utility. Management of the debt is also a \ncomponent under the SOPI program. \n16 External auditing of Barki Tojik by independent auditors has resulted in a disclaimer of opinion for FY2010\u2013\nFY2012. Auditing for FY2013 has not been completed yet. \n17 Government\u2019s Decree 428 of 4 November 2002 for International Financial Reporting Standards; Government\u2019s \nDecree 231 of 2 May 2010 for Additional Arrangements for Implementing International Financial Reporting \nStandards in the Republic of Tajikistan; and President\u2019s Decree 702 of 25 March 2011 for the Law of Accounting. \n18 President\u2019s Decree 626 for the Law on Financial Management and Internal Control; and President\u2019s Decree 631 for \nthe Law on Internal Audit. \n ", "8        \npreparation  of  an  opening  balance  sheet  and  annual  budget  for  each  department  is  also \nongoing. \n \n30.  As  part  of  a  separate  project  funded  by  the  World  Bank,  Barki  Tojik  recruited \ninternational consultants to revalue assets in accordance with International Financial Reporting \nStandards  and  assess  issues  related  to  account  receivables  and  payables.19 Automated \naccounting and billing systems are being introduced, starting in major cities such as Dushanbe \nand Khujand. Continued efforts are needed to steadily increase the tariff level, improve tariff \ncollection efficiency through the adoption of computerized accounting and reporting systems, \nand modernize and rehabilitate productive assets through investment. The last tariff increase, \nwhich averaged 15%, occurred on 3 June 2014. Positive changes are expected in Barki Tojik\u2019s \naccounting procedures, financial reporting, and management reporting systems in 2014\u20132016. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n31.  A  reliable  supply  of  electricity  brings  significant  benefits  to  communities  (especially \npoorer ones), including enhanced incomes and livelihoods, improved health and education, \nbetter security, and a generally higher standard of living. In Tajikistan, winter is difficult for \npeople who lack reliable electricity and cannot afford adequate alternatives (or must spend time \nseeking fuel). Women in particular will benefit from the project because they bear the brunt of \nhousehold  and  family  responsibilities,  including  gathering  fuel  for  cooking,  heating,  and \nprocessing water; and caring for children, the sick, and the elderly. Electricity also offers women \nmore opportunities for home-based enterprises and income generation, and it has positive \nimpacts on public facilities such as schools and health centers. \n \n32.  However, because this project will provide metering in existing substations (which will \nthen supply electricity to the entire grid) as well as a new transmission line and towers, the \nbenefits  (although  substantial)  are  generalized  and  indirect,  and  do  not  target  particular \ncommunities. Similarly, there will not be specific power supply benefits for particular social \ngroups such as women or the poor, beyond those that accrue to electricity consumers in \ngeneral. The technological nature of the project allows little scope for social components, and \nthe project provides no opportunities for specific pro-poor initiatives. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n33.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environment.  The  initial  environmental \nexamination  and  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  were  prepared  by  Barki  Tojik  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). There are two legally protected \nareas and one important bird area located in the project area or its proximity. An approximately \n1.5 km section of the transmission line passes outside the northern boundary of the Say Vota \nBotanical  Reserve  (International  Union  for  Conservation  of  Nature  category  4)  conserving \njuniper. The environmental field survey found that no significant impacts on the reserve are \nexpected.20 The  Rudaki  substation  and  the  power  line  in  Panjakent  are  located  in  close \nproximity to the Sarazm Important Bird Area. The mitigation measures proposed in the project \ndesign include bird diverters to prevent collision of birds with conductors, and bird spikes that \nhave been effective on other transmission lines in Tajikistan. The Zarafshan Complex Reserve \n(International Union for Conservation of Nature category 4) is 3 km from the project area and is \nnot impacted by the project. Other anticipated adverse environmental impacts of the project are \n                                                \n19 World Bank. 2005. Energy Loss Reduction Project, 2005\u20132014.

Adequate  mitigation  measures  were  designed  and  will  be  implemented \nthrough the EMP. The safeguard capacity of the PMU is limited; therefore, the EMP includes \ntraining of PMU personnel in environmental management. Public consultations were conducted \nin the project area from 25 to 28 July 2014. The initial environmental examination and the EMP \nwere disclosed on the ADB website on 16 September 2014. \n \n34.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement.  Based  on  the \nproject\u2019s  preliminary  design,  approximately  0.70  hectares  of  farmland  will  be  permanently \nacquired, and approximately 20 hectares will be temporarily acquired for various activities such \nas stringing towers and building access roads. The temporary land acquisition will have an \nimpact on crops and trees. Entitlements for the various impacts, such as permanent land \nacquisition, crop and tree loss, and allowances for vulnerable and severely affected persons, \nhave already been defined in the draft land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP), which \nwas disclosed on the ADB website on 16 September 2014. Once the final design is available, a \nmore detailed survey of impacts will be undertaken to determine the extent of actual involuntary \nresettlement impacts. Public consultation with the potential affected persons and the general \npublic  has  been  undertaken  for  purposes  of  the  draft  LARP.  Another  round  of  public \nconsultations will be done during the finalization of the LARP. \n \n35.  The project is classified as category C for indigenous peoples safeguards. The project \nwill not impact indigenous people or any similar groups during construction and operation. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n36.  The integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. Major risks and \nmitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment \nand risk management plan.21 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measuresa \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nTransportation of large and  Bid documents will specify that the contract includes a detailed \nheavy transformers to  transportation logistics plan, and that goods be insured from point of \nRudaki substation and risk of  origin to installation on-site. \nequipment damage in transit \nLocation of transmission  The contractor will be requested to undertake additional investigations \ntowers in unsafe grounds  of tower locations, in particular soil at the locations and in the \nsurrounding area.
