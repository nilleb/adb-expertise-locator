An initial environmental examination was undertaken; the \nAssessment  summary is provided in Appendix 11.  \nProject Description  The Project will produce the following outputs: (i) rehabilitation and \nimprovement of about 123 kilometers (km) of core network roads; (ii) \nlabor-intensive routine road maintenance on 45 km; (iii) sound and \nsustainable road maintenance policies; (iv) an efficient bidding and \ncontracting  system  for  engaging  communities  in  road  maintenance \nthrough  local  small  contractors;  (v)  improved  project  management, \nsupervision,  and  monitoring;  and  (vi)  identification  of  modalities  to \nensure sustained rehabilitation and maintenance of rural feeder roads. \nRationale  Timor-Leste is one of the least-developed countries in the world. Per \ncapita  gross  domestic  product  was  estimated  at  $405  in  2004. \nOfficially, more than 40% of the population is reported to live under \n$0.55 per day, the national poverty line. However, according to the \nestimates of Asian Development Bank (ADB) technical assistance for \nTransport Sector Improvement, poverty prevalence is likely as high as \n88%, and approximately 46% of the population live in absolute poverty. \nDuring  the  1999  conflict,  most  communication  and  power  facilities \nwere destroyed. In spite of some restoration efforts, postal services are \nstill closed except in Baucau and Dili. The electrification ratio for all \nhouseholds  is  only  20%;  95%  of  rural  households  are  without \nelectricity. About 48% of the population does not have access to safe \nwater supply, and 69% does not have access to adequate sanitation \nfacilities. Access to health facilities remains problematic. The time and \nmoney costs to reach a community health center or a hospital are \nsubstantial.  Life  expectancy  is  low\u2014less  than  60  years.  Currently, \nabout a third of children are not enrolled in primary school; 20% of the \nenrolled  do  not  attend  classes.  More  than  half  the  population  is \nilliterate. Markets are either nonexistent or access is prevented due to \nmountainous topography, poor transport system, and lack of transport \nservices. \n \nAs  a  new  nation,  Timor-Leste  faces  many  challenges.  The  most \npressing  issues  include  (i)  sustained  economic  growth,  (ii)  poverty \nreduction, (iii) employment, (iv) a legal and institutional framework to \nmanage  and  administer  the  new  nation  state  and  transform  the \nagrarian subsistence production to a market-oriented economy, and (v) \nweak human and institutional capacity. ", "ii \n \nIn the short term, economic growth and employment have to come \nfrom  infrastructure  investments.  The  Government  recognizes  that \ninfrastructure  is  of  overarching  importance  to  all  sectors  of  the \neconomy and society; and that improving infrastructure, particularly the \ntransport system, is critical in fostering private sector development, \nimproving  agricultural  productivity,  reducing  poverty,  promoting \ninvestment and human development, and strengthening government \ncapacity  to  deliver  services.  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program \nupdate for 2005 identifies infrastructure development and institutional \ncapacity building as the major areas for ADB assistance. ADB has \nrecently  approved  a  technical  assistance  to  address  cross-sectoral \ninfrastructure issues and technical capacity building in the road sector. \nThe Project, therefore, will focus on physical road infrastructure and its \nimplementation. As a post-conflict country, Timor-Leste is eligible for \ngrant financing from the Asian Development Fund. \nImpact and Outcome  The Project is expected to contribute to economic growth and poverty \nreduction. It will (i) improve accessibility for project area residents to \nfood, and economic and social services; (ii) promote private sector-led \nindustrial and agricultural development; (iii) foster market formation \nand  facilitate  domestic  and  international  trade;  and  (iv)  generate \nincome and employment opportunities. The outcome will be improved \nroad infrastructure for economic and social development. \nCost Estimates  The Project is estimated to cost $12.50 million, with $5.08 million in \nforeign exchange and $7.42 million equivalent in local currency. \nFinancing Plan  ($\u2019000) \n  Foreign  Local     \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Total  Percent \nAsian Development Bank  5.08  4.92  10.00  80 \nGovernment        \u2014  2.50  2.50  20 \n Total  5.08  7.42  12.50  100 \nGrant Amount and  ADB will provide a grant of $10 million from the Asian Development \nTerms  Fund.  The  grant  will  finance  all  foreign  exchange  costs,  including \nconsulting  services  and  60%  of  the  local  cost  of  civil  works.  The \nGovernment will provide $2.5 million, financing the remaining local cost \nof civil works, including taxes and duties. \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2008 \nEstimated Project   \nCompletion Date  31 December 2007 \nImplementation  The Project will be implemented over 2 years. The prerehabilitation \nArrangements  activities\u2500detailed  design,  preparation  of  bidding  documents, \ntendering,  and  awarding  of  contracts\u2500will  start  in  January  2006. \nCommencement  of  civil  works  will  target  November  2006,  with \ncompletion in December 2007. \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Public Works ", "iii \nProcurement  All  procurement  under  the  Project,  including  both  ADB  and \nGovernment-financed  packages,  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement. The civil works will be divided into seven packages, all to \nbe procured using local competitive bidding procedures. \nConsulting Services  International and domestic consulting services will be required for (i) \nengineering  design  and  preparation  of  bidding  documents;  (ii) \nconstruction supervision; (iii) road maintenance, including formulation \nof  policies,  training,  and  supervision;  (iv)  project  management;  (v) \nsocioeconomic monitoring and evaluation; (vi) financial auditing; and \n(vii) community empowerment initiatives. The Project will fund a total of \n132  person-months  of  international  and  310  person-months  of \ndomestic consulting services.  \n  Consulting services for engineering design, construction supervision, \nproject  management,  road  maintenance  policies,  training  and \nsupervision for maintenance, and socioeconomic monitoring will be \nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants.  Due  to  Government  agencies'  limited  capacity  to \nimplement  grassroots  initiatives,  an  international  nongovernment \norganization will be recruited, using the direct selection method, to \nimplement the community empowerment component. \nProject Benefits and  The Project will reduce poverty by providing villagers in the project \nBeneficiaries  area with labor opportunities. During project implementation, about 500 \nlabor  years  of  employment  will  be  created.  At  its  completion,  the \nProject  will  contribute  to  better  livelihood  for  villagers  by  providing \nmobility to isolated societies; easing access to market centers for food, \neducation, and health services; promoting trading and hence cash crop \ncultivation; and reducing transport costs for the private sector. \nRisks and  The project design considers potential risks associated with project \nAssumptions  management and rehabilitation quality. The Project will maintain and \nexpand  the  Project  Management  Unit,  established  for  the  two \nemergency  infrastructure  rehabilitation  projects,  to  strengthen  its \ncapacity to handle increased responsibilities. A team of international \nand  domestic  consultants  will  provide  construction  supervision.  A \ncommunity empowerment component addressing road safety, human \nimmunodeficiency  virus/acquired  immunodeficiency  syndrome \n(HIV/AIDS),  and  other  social  risks  will  be  implemented  by  an \ninternational nongovernment organization. Environmental impact will \nbe monitored through construction supervision and mitigated at the \nrehabilitation stage in accordance with the environmental management \nplan. \n ", "124  o30'E 126  o30'E\nTIMOR-LESTE\nNational Capital ROAD SECTOR IMPROVEMENT PROJECT\nDistrict Capital\nTown\nPort\nProject Road (Rehabilitation)\nAtauro Island\nProject Road (Maintenance) S t r a i t     o f     W e t a r\nNational Road\nMaumeta-Atauro\nDistrict Road\nLauten Joco\nDistrict Road (planned) Laivai Tutuala Island\nRiver Baucau Cape Cutcha\n8 o 30\u2019S District Boundary Port Hera Metinaro Manatuto Laga Lospalos 8 o 30\u2019S\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste for the Road Sector Improvement Project. \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Timor-Leste is a small and mountainous island country, with a population of 925,000 and \na  land  area  of  14,609  square  kilometers.  It  is  located  at  the  eastern  end  of  the  Sunda \narchipelago and has a dramatic topography dominated by the Ramelau Mountains stretching \nacross the middle of the island from the east to the west. The coastal zones in the north and \nsouth are narrow, and are largely on steep hillsides. \n3.  Roads provide the dominant mode of transport, carrying about 70% of freight and 90% \nof passenger traffic. The total length of the extensive road network is estimated at 6,040 \nkilometers (km), comprising 1,430 km of national roads linking district centers, 870 km of district \nroads providing links to large administrative centers, and 720 km in Dili and several smaller \nregional towns. The remaining 3,020 km are rural access or feeder roads. \n4.  The extensive and dense road network was constructed with relatively low standards of \ndesign and materials. A pragmatic approach adapting to the often severe terrain conditions was \nused,  resulting  in  a  very  low  horizontal  and  vertical  geometrical  standard  in  mountainous \nregions. The road widths appear to have been compromised according to the actual terrain \nconditions, resulting in many very narrow roads. While 100% of national roads and 71% of \ndistrict roads were bitumen paved, shoulders are often constructed out of impervious earthen \nmaterial. This, combined with the difficult geological conditions, torrential rains, and lack of \nmaintenance, has caused rapid deterioration of the road system. Only 24% of national roads \nand 11% of district roads are currently in good condition. \n5.  Traffic volume is small and concentrated around Dili. Traffic counts in 2000 showed that \none third of the road network outside the urban center carried more than 200 vehicles per day \n(with 15% carrying more than 500 vehicles per day, less than 2% carrying more than 1,000 \nvehicles per day). One third of the network carried less than 50 vehicles per day. Traffic counts \nin 2005 estimate the average daily traffic for motorized vehicles at about 160 on national roads, \n90 on district roads, 30 on rural roads, and 170 on urban roads. The heaviest traffic flows in \nexcess of 400 vehicles per day are on the northern coastal road. \n6.  Walking is the most common mode of transportation, followed by small trucks, and \nmicrobuses. Transport services are mainly provided by small-scale private companies owning \none or two vehicles, and a small number of vehicle owner-operators. The Government has set \nminimum taxi fare rates, but has not set rates for passenger and freight buses and trucks.  \n7.  Drivers\u2019  associations  are  apparently  developing  and  setting  rates.  Passenger  fares \nrange from $0.50 to $3.00, depending on distance, averaging approximately $1.00 per one-way \ntrip. This is high and not affordable for many rural people, particularly the poor. These rates do \nnot provide a decent livelihood for vehicle operators/owners: almost half are estimated to be \nliving below the national poverty line. Operating costs are high; repair costs average about \n$1,500 per year. Nearly 50% of the total repair costs are caused by the poor road conditions. \n8.  Rehabilitating and maintaining the extensive road network will incur considerable cost to \nthe Government. Difficult terrain, geology, and weather conditions impose additional costs. \nGiven the current level of traffic demand and state of the economy, user charges are not likely ", "2 \nto be able to generate sufficient revenue to finance road sector development. Prioritizing and \nsequencing to maximize the benefits of investment are therefore essential. Past efforts have \nfocused on basic maintenance, rehabilitation, and emergency works. The cost of this reactive \napproach was high and needs to shift to a preventive approach of gradually rehabilitating the \nsystem  so  that  it  can  be  sustained  with  normal  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  and  a \nmanageable amount of emergency repairs. \n9.  The  Project  will  rehabilitate  and  maintain  four  crucial  roads  in  agricultural  areas  to \npromote economic and social development, and explore low-cost, community-based modalities \nfor road maintenance. The design and monitoring framework is attached as Appendix 1.  \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n10.  As a post-conflict country emerging from 3 years of United Nations (UN) administration, \nTimor-Leste faces many challenges and opportunities. The most pressing include (i) sustained \neconomic growth, (ii) poverty reduction, (iii) employment, (iv) a legal and institutional framework \nto  manage  and  administer  the  new  nation  state  and  transform  the  agrarian  subsistence \nproduction to a market-oriented economy, and (v) weak human and institutional capacity. \n1.  Problems \n11.  Economic Growth. The large influx of UN forces, bilateral and multilateral donors, \nforeign experts, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and financial aid boosted consumption \nand investment, and generated income and job opportunities. Real gross domestic product \n(GDP) growth was estimated at 18% in 2000 and 15% in 2001. But with the winding down of the \ninternational assistance, economic growth fell significantly in 2002 to an estimated 3%, and \nbecame negative in 2003 (minus 3%). Growth in 2004 was moderate at about 1%. \n12.  Poverty. Timor-Leste is one of the least-developed countries in the world, in terms of \nper capita GDP, estimated at $405 in 2004. Officially, more than 40% of the population is \nreported  to  live  below  the  national  poverty  line  of  $0.55  per  day.  However,  according  to \nestimates  of  ADB  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Transport  Sector  Improvement,1  poverty \nprevalence is likely to be as high as 88%, and approximately 46% live in absolute poverty. As \nthree quarters of the population reside in rural areas, surviving on subsistence and seasonal \nagriculture,  poverty  is  predominantly  a  rural  phenomenon.  During  the  1999  conflict,  most \ncommunication and power facilities were destroyed. In spite of some restoration efforts, postal \nservices are still closed except in Baucau and Dili. The electrification ratio for all households is \nonly 20%; 95% of rural households are without electricity. About 48% of the population do not \nhave access to safe water supplies, and 69% do not have access to adequate sanitation \nfacilities. Access to health facilities remains a problem. The time and money costs to reach a \ncommunity health center or a hospital are substantial (70 minutes by walking and 2 hours by \nminibus, $1 on average for one-way bus fare). Life expectancy is low, less than 60 years. While \naccess to schooling improved considerably prior to 1999, the quality of teaching and learning \nwas low. Currently, about a third of children are not enrolled in primary school; 20% of the \nenrolled do not attend classes. More than half of the population is illiterate. Markets are either \nnonexistent or access is prevented or severely hampered due to mountainous topography, poor \ntransport system, and lack of transport services.  \n13.  Employment. The total fertility rate is very high, estimated to be 8.3. Every year, about \n16,000 new workers enter the labor force. The rapid increase in population and labor force has \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste for Transport Sector Improvement. \nManila. ", "3 \nnot been accompanied by an increase in job opportunities. Agriculture is the principal economic \nactivity and the most important source of livelihood. But agricultural development is hampered \nby falling prices, deteriorating rural infrastructure, lack of rural services and access to markets, \nand traditional cultivation practices. Productivity and incomes are low. Underemployment is \nwidespread. Poverty prevalence is high. People are moving to the cities, particularly the capital \nDili, in search of job and income opportunities, which are scarce. The public sector offers little \nprospect  for  wage  employment,  due  to  the  limited  number  of  government  positions. \nDevelopment  of  the  small  private  business  sector  is  constrained  by  poor  and  expensive \ninfrastructure facilities, lack of legal and regulatory environment, devastated business services, \nand low labor productivity. Moreover, the withdrawal of expatriates is causing job losses. \n14.  Legal and Institutional Framework. Timor-Leste emerged from the conflict with large-\nscale devastation. With the 1999 referendum, linkages to the Indonesian legal and institutional \nframework  were  severed.  With  international  assistance,  a  government  structure  has  taken \nshape.  Some  laws  and  regulations  have  been  promulgated.  However,  the  process  of \nintroducing necessary laws and regulations is slow. The Government\u2019s organizational structure \nis still evolving and subject to constant changes. These create risks and uncertainties for the \nprivate  sector  as  well  as  donor  agencies.  The  organizational  change  of  the  Ministry  of \nTransport, Communications, and Public Works, initially formed in 2002, is a good illustration. \nThe Government recently split the ministry into the Ministry of Transport and Communications \nand Ministry of Public Works (MPW).  \n15.  Weak Human and Institutional Capacity. The human resource base is low as a result \nof  the  conflict  and  tragedies.  Administrative,  managerial,  entrepreneurial,  technical,  and \nvocational skills are in short supply in all sectors of the economy. Middle to senior managerial \npositions are difficult to fill with qualified people. The vast majority of current civil servants are \nneither experienced nor trained for the roles they are undertaking. The Government depends \nheavily on foreign experts for daily administrative operations, policy formulation, and preparation \nand implementation of development projects. The problem is also acute in the road sector. The \nDirectorate  of  Roads,  Bridges,  and  Flood  Control,  which  is  responsible  for  provision  and \nmanagement  of  road  infrastructure,  has  only  12  staff,  of  a  total  of  91,  with  technical \nqualifications. They have limited skills in the formulation of technical standards, road planning, \nprioritization, project preparation and implementation, and asset management, and have to \nfocus on managing emergency repair work. \n16.  Social, Gender, and Health-Related Issues. Difficult terrain, geology, and weather \nconditions contribute to the isolation of local communities and severely limit access to water \nsupplies, energy, food, basic social services (health and education), and local markets. The \npoor conditions of rural feeder roads especially affect rural women, who are responsible for \ncarrying clean water, collecting fodder and fuelwood, and marketing agriculture products. To \nensure tangible benefits to poor and isolated communities, the rehabilitation of national roads \nshould be accompanied by an increasing focus on the rehabilitation of secondary and rural \nfeeder roads to ensure connectivity to markets, towns, and health and educational facilities. This \ncomplementary approach is likely to increase the anticipated poverty reduction impact of road \nimprovement. Strengthening the capacity of local communities to prioritize and sequence their \nneeds in terms of feeder road rehabilitation and maintenance contributes to the sustainability of \nroad improvements. The traditional gender division of labor can be challenged by proactively \nensuring women\u2019s involvement in road rehabilitation and maintenance in a culturally sensitive \nmanner.  Areas  identified  by  local  constructors  and  surveyed  communities  for  potential \ninvolvement of women include support services to construction camps and bioengineering. \nWomen\u2019s effective access to these employment opportunities will require targeted programs of \nlabor  skills  transfer.  Timor-Leste  is  characterized  by  low\u2014mostly  underreported\u2014human \n ", "4 \nimmunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) prevalence. Although \ndata on HIV prevalence is inadequate, recent surveys jointly carried out by the Ministry of \nHealth (MOH) and the World Health Organization estimate HIV prevalence of 0.64% (MOH, \n2002 HIV/AIDS summary report). The exposure of currently isolated communities to road traffic \ncalls for special attention to the critical risks of HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infection \n(STI). In light of women\u2019s greater exposure to the risks and impacts of HIV/AIDS, culturally \nsensitive  and  gender-responsive  HIV/AIDS  awareness  initiatives  should  be  provided  in \ncampsites and corridors of influence as part of reproductive health programs. \n2.  Opportunities \n17.  National Development Plan. Following the restoration of independence in 2002, Timor-\nLeste has aspired to build a more democratic and affluent society. Its vision, priorities, and \ndevelopment strategies are articulated in the National Development Plan. The plan focuses on \ntwo overriding development objectives: (i) to reduce poverty in all sectors and regions of the \nnation; and (ii) to promote economic growth that is equitable and sustainable, and improve the \nhealth,  education,  and  well-being  of  the  population.  The  Government  recognizes  that \ninfrastructure is of overarching importance to all sectors of the economy and society; and that \nimproving infrastructure, particularly the transport system, is critical to foster private sector \ndevelopment, improve agricultural productivity, reduce poverty, promote investment and human \ndevelopment, and strengthen the Government\u2019s capacity to deliver services. \n18.  Sector Investment Plan. Fifteen sector investment plans, sponsored by ADB and other \ndevelopment partners, were developed during 2003\u20132005, covering basic services, production, \nbasic infrastructure, and governance. The plans assessed the status of each sector, identified \nissues, and predicted funding requirements. The plan for transport assessed aviation, maritime, \nand land transport, but placed the emphasis on the road sector. It argued that road investment \nshould receive priority over investments in airports and seaports, as most East Timorese travel \nby  road  and  the  road  network  is  prone  to  failures,  resulting  from  long-term  neglect  of \nmaintenance and unfavorable topographical and weather conditions. Ports and airports were \nupgraded during earlier emergency measures, and their capacity should meet demand for the \nforeseeable future. \n19.  Government Vision for the Road Sector. The Government\u2019s 10-year vision for the \nroad system is to (i) bring the road network to a sustainable condition where, with regular \nmaintenance, life-cycle costs will be minimized, road closures reduced and manageable, and \nroad access reliable; (ii) improve key roads to support a growing economy; (iii) ensure effective \ncapacity to manage the road system, comprising asset management systems (including risk \nmanagement), use of the private sector for cost-effective delivery, and reliable funding and \nadequate cost-recovery from users. Priority will be given to maintaining the current roads, \nparticularly  the  core  road  network  serving  major  economic  and  administrative  functions. \nInvestments will focus on projects that provide net economic benefits in terms of reduced road \nmaintenance  and  vehicle  operating  costs,  and  that  support  agricultural  and  industrial \ndevelopments. \n20.  ADB Strategy. In the short term, economic growth and employment have to come from \ninfrastructure  investments.  The  ADB  country  strategy  and  program  update  for  2005-20062 \nidentifies infrastructure development and institutional capacity building as the major areas for \nADB  assistance.  The  Transport  Sector  Improvement  TA  (footnote  1)  was  to  assist  the \nGovernment in prioritizing road investments to maximize benefits and search for least-cost ways \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2004.Country Assistance Program Update (2005\u20132006): Timor-Leste. Manila. ", "5 \nto rehabilitate and maintain the core road system over the coming decade. Extensive surveys of \nroad conditions, traffic volume, socioeconomic conditions, and the physical environment were \nundertaken.  Rigorous  economic  analyses  were  conducted.  A  prioritized  road  development \nprogram was proposed and will be used by the Government, ADB, and other development \npartners to plan interventions. \n21.  The Project comprises four roads located in the central and western south coast of the \ncountry. These two regions are agricultural areas and have potential for industrial and port \ndevelopment, and international trade, yet they are currently suffering from isolation and food \ninsecurity. The Project will complement efforts of the Government of Japan and the European \nUnion (EU) to (i) increase access for people in these two regions to major market centers for \nfood  and  social  services;  (ii)  open  up  opportunities  for  people  to  participate  in  economic \nactivities; and (iii) increase income to enhance their affordability for food and economic and \nsocial services. It will reduce transport costs for coffee collectors and vehicle operating costs for \nprivate transport service operators, thus promoting industrial and agricultural development. \n22.  In the area of institutional capacity building, ADB has approved a TA3 to develop an \nintegrated institutional development road map for infrastructure sectors and a road map for road \nsector capacity building that would leverage resources from development agencies. The TA will \naddress the urgent needs of the road sector by training government and private individuals to \nbuild their technical and contract management skills so that they can supervise the Project to \nfacilitate implementation and enhance quality. This will be followed by another three TAs to \nincrease  capacity  in  infrastructure  sectors,  including  roads.  For  the  Project,  the  Project \nManagement Unit (PMU) established under the previous road project will be expanded and \nstrengthened to carry out the Project. One technical staff financed by the Project will be added \nand  a  total  of  212  person-months  of  international  and  domestic  consulting  services  for \nconstruction supervision will be provided to ensure timely project implementation and quality. \n23.  External Assistance. External assistance has mainly been provided by the Government \nof Japan, EU, and ADB. Since 2000, the Government of Japan has provided grants totaling \n$34.6 million to transport; 54% to the road sector for roads improvement, project studies, and \ntraining. The ongoing Dili to Suai road rehabilitation project is adjacent to the Project. The EU \napproved a grant of $7.6 million in May 2004 to finance rehabilitation of five bridges on the \nalignment from Viqueque to Uatucarbau, which is included as one of the road sections under the \nProject.  Since  2000,  ADB  has  provided  two  TAs  to  transport  totaling  $1.5  million.  It  has \nadministered two emergency infrastructure rehabilitation projects (EIRPs) funded by the Trust \nFund for East Timor. The first EIRP was a multisector project covering the road, port, and power \nsectors. The total grant was $29.8 million; 80% was applied to roads. It aimed to facilitate peace \nand security, and humanitarian relief aid by addressing immediate system failures. The second \nEIRP, with a grant of $9 million entirely for roads, is ongoing and expected to be completed in \n2007. A summary of external assistance to the sector is presented in Appendix 2. \n24.  Lessons Learned. Several lessons can be drawn from the experience of administering \nthe EIRPs. First, as emergency needs are abated, more attention and efforts should be given to \nquality and sustainability. Second, project design needs to take into account the limited capacity \nof MPW (the Executing Agency) to undertake technical design, procure goods and services, \nmonitor and supervise rehabilitation, and manage contracts. Third, a well-staffed functional \nPMU is critical for project implementation and needs to be put in place at project onset. \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2005.

The Project is expected to contribute to economic growth and poverty reduction by \nimproving road transport in the project area. It will (i) improve accessibility for residents in the \nproject area to food, economic opportunities, and social services; (ii) promote private sector-led \nindustrial and agricultural development; (iii) foster market formation, and facilitate domestic and \ninternational trade; and (iv) generate income and employment opportunities. The outcome will \nbe improved road infrastructure for economic and social development.  \nB.  Outputs \n26.  The Project will produce the following outputs: (i) rehabilitation and improvement of \nabout 123 km of core network roads; (ii) labor-intensive routine road maintenance for 45 km; \n(iii) sound and sustainable road maintenance policies; (iv) an efficient bidding and contracting \nsystem  for  engaging  communities  in  road  maintenance  through  local  small  contractors; \n(v) improved  project  management,  supervision,  and  monitoring;  and  (vi)  identification  of \nmodalities to ensure community-based, gender-inclusive rehabilitation and maintenance of rural \nfeeder roads. Project activities include \n \n(i)  rehabilitation  of  three  road  sections  to  fair  conditions:  (a)  Oeleu\u2013Zumalai \n(35.9 km), (b) Aituto\u2013Same (30.8 km), and (c) Viqueque\u2013Uatucarbau (55.8 km), \nby strengthening the base, resurfacing, protecting and stabilizing slopes, and \nimproving drainage system and shoulders; \n(ii)  routine maintenance for Iliomar\u2013Lospalos (45 km), to be implemented by small \nlocal contractors using labor-intensive methods, and include patching, improving \nside drains, repairing culverts, improving shoulders, constructing lined drains, \nand bioengineering;4 \n(iii)  international  and  domestic  consulting  services  for  project  management, \nconstruction  supervision,  establishment  of  road  maintenance  policies,  road \nmaintenance training and supervision, and socioeconomic impact monitoring; \nand  \n(iv)  community empowerment initiatives, including (a) identification of community-\nbased and gender-inclusive modalities for rehabilitation and maintenance of rural \nfeeder roads adjacent to the project roads; (b) HIV/AIDS prevention and road \nsafety awareness programs along the project roads to be implemented by an \ninternational  NGO  with  expertise  in  community-based  and  labor-intensive \ninfrastructure development and service delivery in one selected subdistrict along \nthe project roads; and (c) monitoring of employment targets for women. \nC.  Special Features \n1.  Project Management and Supervision  \n27.  Actual implementation of the second EIRP (EIRP-2) did not commence until 2 years \nafter its effectiveness. Experience with EIRP-2 illustrates the crucial role of the PMU. Currently, \nthe PMU has four staff: a project manager, chief technical adviser (international), road engineer, \n                                                 \n4  Bioengineering is the use of vegetation, terracing, and construction of efficient drainage systems to stabilize road \nembankments and slopes. The purpose of the vegetation is to minimize water penetration into the ground layers \nand to reduce the risk of erosion of the surface soils to ensure long-term sustainability of the roads. Bioengineering \nincludes tree planting with deep-rooted species to reduce the risk of shallow slides and debris flow. ", "7 \nand financial administrator. They are working effectively and efficiently to implement EIRP-2. \nThe proposed Project will maintain and strengthen the PMU to enable it to accommodate \nincreased responsibilities. One highway engineer will be added to the PMU\u2019s current staff. \nConsulting services, comprising 212 person-months of international and domestic consulting \nservices, will assist the PMU in supervising civil works contracts and environment mitigation \nmeasures.  Another  8  person-months  of  international  consulting  and  10  person-months  of \ndomestic will assist the PMU in monitoring and evaluating the Project\u2019s socioeconomic impacts. \nThe international consultant will provide the domestic consultant with hands-on training and \nensure knowledge transfer.  \n2.  Prioritization of Road Investments \n28.  Rehabilitating and maintaining an extensive road network requires sizeable investment. \nGiven  the  constraints  of  financial  resources  and  institutional  capacity,  prioritizing  road \ninvestments to maximize economic and social benefits is crucial. \n29.  To  define  the  project  scope  and  develop  a  medium-  to  long-term  road  investment \nprogram, 1,650 km of the core road network and relevant district roads were surveyed and \ntraffic counts carried out at 30 locations across the country. Based on the road characteristics \nand conditions, traffic volume, and proposed interventions, rigorous economic analyses were \nconducted, using the highway design and management model (HDM-4) (a model for searching \nfor an optimum combination of investments and interventions for the road sector) developed \njointly by the World Bank and ADB, among others, to identify road interventions that give the \nbest economic net present values with least-cost investments. The three roads, comprising five \nroad sections to be financed by the Project, top the list in terms of economic net present value. \n30.  The 5\u201310-year prioritized road investment program based on the economic analysis will \ngive directions for future ADB assistance in the road sector, benefit aid coordination to ensure \nconsistent road sector development planning, and serve as the basis for the Government\u2019s own \nroad sector investments. \n3.  Aid Coordination and Project Complementarity \n31.  In the process of selecting road sections for the Project, close consultations with aid \nagencies involved in the road sector, particularly the Japan International Cooperation Agency \nand EU, were conducted to maximize complementarities and avoid overlap. The Aituto\u2013Same \nroad connects to the Dili\u2013Suai road, which is currently under repair funded by the Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency.  Rehabilitation  of  the  Viqueque\u2013Ilioma  road  section \ncomplements the EU\u2019s bridge project, which is now at the design stage, and ensures that the \nwhole road is in fair condition. The Project is also complementary to EIRP-2, which is repairing \nshort damaged road sections from Maliana and Zumulai. \n4.  Road Safety and Sustainability  \n32.  Road fatalities in Timor-Leste are among the highest in southeast and south Asian \ncountries with more than 20 deaths per 10,000 vehicles. The potential for even greater accident \nrates is high, considering the increase in vehicles, growing population, and increased vehicle \nspeeds resulting from improvements to the road network. However, data on traffic accidents and \nfatalities show that most occur in urban areas, and especially in Dili. A national road safety \nstrategy was prepared, but implementation has not started. \n33.  Road  accidents  have  various  causes,  including  poor  road  design  standards,  driver \nbehavior, and lack of awareness among villagers. Road widening and realignment are not \n ", "8 \njustifiable at this stage due to demand constraints. The Project includes a pilot road safety \nawareness campaign program to be implemented by an NGO.  \n34.  Road  sustainability  is  a  major  challenge.  This  is  not  mainly  because  of  financial \nconstraints and difficult geographical conditions; but rather capacity constraints to establish road \nmaintenance policies, and to plan, organize, and execute capital and maintenance works. The \nGovernment is expecting total revenues to be above $100 million per year for an indefinite \nperiod, and has committed about $190 million from the budget for road maintenance during the \nProject. In spite of growing capacity, spending the budget funds remains a challenge for the \nGovernment. The Project, through the routine road maintenance Iliomar\u2013Lospalos component, \nwill establish sound and sustainable road maintenance policies for the road sector and project \nroads, and institutionalize a bidding and contracting system for engaging local small contractors \nfrom communities in routine maintenance. This will help the Government continue with its own \nroad maintenance investments and preserve road assets at low costs. \n5.  Labor-Intensive Maintenance \n35.  Road assets can be prevented from rapidly deteriorating if timely routine maintenance \ncan be done. Routine road maintenance mainly involves clearing vegetation from shoulders, \nimproving and shaping shoulders, clearing drains and culverts, and constructing stone masonry-\nlined drains, which can be done by labor without heavy equipment. Labor-intensive routine \nmaintenance will help extend the life of roads, and generate business opportunities and income \nfor  local  communities.  Under  the  Project,  the  Lliomar\u2013Lospalos  road  section,  which  is  in \nrelatively good and maintainable condition, was selected for routine maintenance using labor-\nintensive methods. The ten contract packages for the road will target small contractors from \nlocal communities. An international road maintenance specialist will be provided to train the \nlocal contractors, improve their maintenance skills, and ensure works are done properly. With \nthe establishment of road maintenance policies, institutionalization of a bidding and contracting \nsystem for engaging local small contractors, and skill development, systematic labor-intensive \nroad maintenance is expected in the future to preserve assets, while generating income and job \nopportunities. \n6.  Gender Inclusive Development \n36.  In light of women\u2019s traditional exclusion from employment opportunities derived from \nroad construction, the Project will support socioculturally sensitive modalities to ensure women\u2019s \ninvolvement in road rehabilitation and maintenance. In this respect, MPW\u2500through the PMU\u2014\nwill encourage civil works contractors to increase the percentage of women workers to 30% of \nwage-laborers  (including  at  least  75%  of  bioengineering  activities).  The  community \nempowerment initiatives for sustainable rehabilitation and maintenance of selected rural feeder \nroads will have a strong gender focus and support a broad range of initiatives that include (i) \nparticipatory  and  gender-inclusive  identification  and  selection  of  rural  feeder  roads  to  be \nrehabilitated under the Project; and (ii) skills transfer to women in bioengineering, agroforestry, \nand agricultural extension, combined with literacy, nutrition, reproductive health, and HIV/AIDS \nprevention. The initiatives will include the design of sustainable modalities to ensure gender-\ninclusive maintenance of rehabilitated feeder roads. \n7.  HIV/AIDS Prevention and Reproductive Health \n37.  Although  accurate data on HIV prevalence are not available, recent surveys jointly \ncarried  out  by  MOH  and  the  World  Health  Organization  estimate  HIV  at  0.64%  of  the ", "9 \npopulation.5 In light of the potential impact of road rehabilitation on the spread of HIV/AIDS, the \nProject will fund culturally sensitive and gender-responsive HIV/AIDS awareness and education \ninitiatives  along  the  project  road;  and  target  high-risk  groups,  including  local  construction \nworkers, long-distance drivers, and women in the campsites and in the corridors of influence \nalong project roads. These initiatives\u2014to be funded as part of the community empowerment \ninitiatives (component 4)\u2014will complement Government-led initiatives for HIV/AIDS prevention, \nbe implemented in consultation with MOH and local government agencies, and are in line with \nthe National Strategic Plan for a Comprehensive and Multi-Sectoral Response to HIV/AIDS and \nSTI 2002\u20132005 (2002). \n8.  Institutional Capacity Development in the Road Sector \n38.  The ADB country strategy and program update for 2005-2006 identified institutional \ncapacity development as central to all activities. Four infrastructure sector capacity development \nTAs are programmed, including one approved in July 2005 (footnote 3). The TA is designed to \naddress infrastructure institutional issues across sectors; and the shortage of qualified road \nengineers to plan, execute, and supervise the road investment projects. The TA will train 60 \nlocal individuals with some technical background, both from the Government and private sector.  \n39.  Although the Project focuses on physical road infrastructure and its implementation, in \nlight of the capacity-building TA, the Project will provide an ideal training ground for the trainees \nto practice what they have learned from the courses and acquire practical experience in project \nimplementation, construction supervision, and contract management. The PMU has already \nproduced a construction supervision guide and trained four Government officials by involving \nthem in project implementation and supervision. With more technical people available, more \nstaff can be trained by working with the PMU and international consulting team.  \n9.  Stakeholder Participation and Consultation \n40.  Extensive  public  consultations  were  conducted  with  Government  officials; \ninternational/national NGOs involved in community-based infrastructure development, service \ndelivery,  and  HIV/AIDS  prevention;  as  well  as  local  communities  in  the  project  area. \nConsultations aimed to plan and prioritize road investments, assess the potential impacts of \nproposed interventions, and mitigate associated adverse risks. A consultation workshop was \nsuccessfully conducted on 7 March 2005. During road condition surveys of the national and \ndistrict  road  network  and  socioeconomic  surveys,  the  TA  consulting  team  (footnote  1) \nconducted 10 key informant interviews with district administrators, district development officers, \nvillage (suco) and hamlet chiefs, and women\u2019s groups and associations. Nine village focus \ngroup discussions were held. Sample surveys with households, vehicle operators, passengers, \nand freight shippers were conducted. In total, about 600 stakeholders were consulted. They \nshowed keen interest in sharing their perceptions about the causes of poverty, approaches to \npoverty reduction, and potential impact of road improvements on the economic and social \ndevelopment of the villages. Road improvement ranked among the main priorities, which also \ninclude education, skill training, fertilizers, farming machines, and irrigation to increase farming \nproductivity and the water supply system. Local community concerns were considered and \nreflected  in  the  project  design,  particularly  in  designing  the  community  empowerment \ncomponent (Appendix 3). \n                                                 \n5  Ministry of Health. 2002.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n43.  MPW will be the Executing Agency, responsible for overall project management. MPW \nwill  operate  through  the  PMU  established  under  MPW  for  EIRP-2.  The  PMU  will  be \nstrengthened for the Project and (i) handle bidding processes, (ii) manage contracts, (iii) monitor \nproject progress, (iv) prepare withdrawal applications, (v) prepare project progress reports and \nproject completion report, (vi) maintain project accounts and complete grant financial records for \nauditing, and (vii) monitor the Project\u2019s socioeconomic impacts. It will ensure that two resident \nengineer offices staffed with a team of international and domestic consultants are established in \nBaucau and Maliana to oversee construction supervision and environmental monitoring, and \nensure quality. To the extent possible, it will involve regional MPW offices in Baucau, Maliana, \nand Same in project implementation. \n2.  Implementation Period \n44.  The Project will be implemented over 2 years. The prerehabilitation activities\u2500detailed \ndesign, preparation of bidding documents, tendering, and awarding of contracts\u2500will start in \nJanuary 2006. Commencement of civil works is targeted for November 2006, with completion in \nDecember 2007. The implementation schedule is attached as Appendix 5.  \n3.  Procurement \n45.  All procurement under the Project, including both ADB and the Government-financed \npackages, will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The civil works will be divided into \nseven packages, all to be procured using local competitive bidding procedures (Appendix \n6). These procedures are justified because of the good experiences under EIRP-2 and \nexistence  of  a  competitive  construction  sector,  in  which  joint  ventures  and  foreign \ncontractors are permitted to bid. Postqualification procedures will be used to shorten the \nbidding process. Technical and financial qualifications of contractors will be reviewed in \nconjunction with the review of the bid proposals. Only contractors with adequate technical \nand financial capacities will be allowed to bid for several packages. They may be awarded \nmore than one contract based on the least-cost combination of contracts. The relevant \nsections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy will be included in all documents and contracts \nrelated to the bidding and project implementation. \n4.  Consulting Services \n46.  International and domestic consulting services will be required for (i) engineering design \nand preparation of bidding documents; (ii) construction supervision; (iii) road maintenance, \nincluding  formulation  of  policies,  training,  and  supervision;  (iv)  project  management;  (v) \n ", "12 \nsocioeconomic  monitoring  and  evaluation;  (vi)  financial  auditing;  and  (vii)  community \nempowerment initiatives. The Project will fund a total of 132 person-months of international and \n310 person-months of domestic consulting services (Table 3). \nTable 3: Consulting Services \n(person-months) \n \nItem  International  Domestic \n1.

Consulting  services  for  engineering  design,  construction  supervision,  project \nmanagement,  road  maintenance  policies,  training  and  supervision  for  maintenance,  and \nsocioeconomic monitoring will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. Due to Government agencies' limited capacity to implement grassroots initiatives, \nan international NGO will be recruited, using the direct selection method, to implement the \ncommunity empowerment component. With the assistance of the ADB Fact-Finding Mission, the \nGovernment has identified CARE Timor-Leste, an experienced international NGO, to implement \nthe component. CARE is the only international NGO whose geographic coverage is consistent \nwith the planned project coverage. Its strategy and priorities are consistent with ADB's program \nof assistance in the country. Its demonstrated track record of involvement in community-based \nand labor-intensive infrastructure development and service delivery, including community-based \nHIV/AIDS prevention, is in line with the objective and scope of the component. The terms of \nreference for community empowerment component are attached in Appendix 7. \n5.  Advance Action \n48.  The  Government  requested  ADB  approval  of  advance  action  for  recruitment  of \nconsulting services, and procurement of civil works. The approval of advance action was given \nduring the Management Review Meeting. Advance action covers invitation of bids, bidding, and \nbid evaluation, but will not include contract awards. The advance action will be undertaken in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \nThe Government was advised that approval of the advance action does not commit ADB to \nfinancing the Project. \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n49.  The grant will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. \nThe  disbursement  procedures  will  include  direct  payments,  imprest  account,  and \nreimbursements. The PMU will open and maintain an imprest account separate from the one for \nEIRP-2 in a domestic commercial bank in Dili. The maximum amount in the account will be \neither 10% of the total ADB grant or equivalent to 6 months of expenditure, whichever is lower. ", "13 \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n50.  MPW, through the PMU, will maintain a separate account for the Project and prepare \nseparate financial statements, indicating sources and application of funds, and have them \naudited by the international accountant engaged by the Project. The audited project accounts \nand the auditor\u2019s reports will be provided to ADB within 6 months after the end of each financial \nyear. MPW, through the PMU, will prepare and submit to ADB quarterly project progress reports \nand a project completion report within 3 months after project completion. \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n51.  ADB and the Government will agree on a set of indicators for monitoring and evaluating \nproject  performance  in  relation  to  its  goals  and  purposes,  with  an  emphasis  on  poverty \nreduction,  prior  to  project  commencement.  Eight  person-months  of  international  consulting \nservices and 10 person-months of domestic consulting services are provided under the Project \nto  establish  and  monitor  indicators,  and  evaluate  project  performance.  The  international \nconsultant will work with the domestic consultant to establish gender disaggregated baseline \ndata  for  social  and  poverty  impact  indicators,  monitor  the  indicators  during  project \nimplementation and at project completion, and assess the Project\u2019s socioeconomic impacts. The \nconsultant  will  provide  hands-on  training  to  the  domestic  consultant  on  data  collection, \nmonitoring, and evaluation. The indicators may include (i) economic development and poverty \nindicators for the project area; (ii) industrial and agricultural outputs; (iii) transport costs and \ntime; (iv) transport services and charges, (v) accident rates; (vi) level of social services including \nschool enrollment and infant mortality; and (viii) jobs created in rehabilitation and maintenance. \nEmployment impact indicators include information about unskilled laborers, poor laborers, and \nwomen laborers. \n9.  Project Review \n52.  The Project will be reviewed every 6 months. Each review will cover all institutional, \nadministrative, organizational, technical, environmental, social, poverty reduction, resettlement, \neconomic, financial, and other relevant aspects that may have an impact on the performance of \nthe Project and its continuing viability. \n10.  Anticorruption \n53.  The Fact-Finding Mission explained ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy to MPW and the PMU, \nhighlighting  the  section  on  fraud  and  corruption  in  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  Procurement  and \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. For the Project, the financial administrator in the PMU for \nEIRP-2 will continue to be employed and funded by the Project, and an international consultant \nwith adequate knowledge and experience of international accounting practices will be recruited \nto audit the project accounts and financial statements.  \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n54.  Traffic  forecasts  by  vehicle  type  and  type  of  traffic  (normal  and  generated)  were \nprepared for the project road sections for 20 years from 2005 to 2024. The forecasts are based \non expected GDP growth and on the income elasticity for national transport demand in relation \nto GDP growth. According to the International Monetary Fund\u2019s medium-term outlook for Timor-\nLeste, GDP will grow at 5% per annum. Income elasticity of demand for normal traffic is \nestimated at 1.2. Therefore, growth for normal traffic is estimated at 6%. This applies to all types \nof  vehicles  and  is  justified,  given  the  lack  of  secondary  data  and  any  previous  studies. \nGenerated traffic is assumed to represent 10% of normal traffic, adjusted for seasonal patterns. \n ", "14 \nA conservative assumption is that no traffic will be generated on roads that are not in very poor \noverall condition. The traffic forecast for the project road sections is summarized in Appendix 8. \n55.  The economic analysis was carried out for the three project roads by comparing the \nwith- and without-project scenarios using the highway design and management model (para. \n28). The economic analysis covers 20 years (2005\u20132024), based on a rehabilitation period of 1 \nyear starting in 2007. All benefits and costs are in constant 2005 prices. The economic prices \nare expressed using the world price numeraire. \n56.  The economic costs of the Project are (i) the capital cost, including labor, equipment and \nmaterials, consulting services, and physical contingency; and (ii) the costs of maintaining the \nproject  roads.  The  economic  benefits  arise  from  (i)  savings  in  vehicle  operating  costs, \nparticularly repair costs, due to the improved road conditions; (ii) savings in maintenance costs; \n(iii) time savings for road users; and (iv) benefits to generated traffic. The Project will have other \nbenefits, such as improved food security and access to economic and social services, which \nwere not included in the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) calculation.  \n57.  Using a 12% discount rate, the net present value is $6.85 million and the EIRR 24.1%. \nThe vehicle operating cost savings account for the majority of the benefits (95% of the total). \nThe results of the sensitivity analysis confirm the Project\u2019s economic viability. The switching \nvalue6 for increased rehabilitation costs is determined to be 92%, and the switching value for \ndecreased benefits 44%. In the worst case scenario\u2014a combination of increased costs and \ndecreased benefits\u2014the net present value would be reduced to $3.42 million, and the EIRR to \n17.7%. Detailed economic analysis is in Appendix 9. \nV.  POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL IMPACTS \nA.  Poverty Reduction Impact \n58.  The Project will contribute to poverty reduction in the project area and the country by \npromoting  economic  growth  through  investment  and  road  infrastructure  improvement.  The \nextensive national, district, village, and hamlet surveys indicate that the Project will directly \nbenefit  the  road  users,  such  as  rural  households,  passengers,  vehicle  operators,  freight \nshippers, traders, and the private sector as a whole. Many users, particularly poor users, are \ncurrently  suffering  from  high  transportation  costs,  while  vehicle  operators  and  owners \nexperience high vehicle operating costs, including high vehicle repair costs. The Project is \nexpected to benefit about 62,000 people, including 55,000 poor and 28,000 extremely poor.  \n59.  The Project will reduce poverty by providing villagers in the project area with immediate \nincome-generating  opportunities.  During  implementation,  about  500  person-years  of \nemployment will be created. At its completion, the Project will contribute to a better livelihood for \nvillagers by (i) providing mobility to isolated societies; (ii) easing access to market centers for \nfood, education, and health services; (iii) promoting trading and hence cash crop cultivation; and \n(iv) reducing transport costs for the private sector as presented in Appendix 10. \nB.  Social and Gender Impact \n60.  During project preparation, the potential social and gender benefits and impacts on local \ncommunities  and  vulnerable  groups  were  analyzed.  This  was  done  through  a  stakeholder \nconsultation workshop, key informant interviews in districts, subdistricts, villages (suco), and \n                                                 \n6  The switching value shows the percentage increase in a cost variable (or decline in a benefit variable) required for \nthe net present value to become zero, which is the same as the EIRR reducing to the cut-off level of 12%. ", "15 \nhamlets (aldeia), focus group discussions, and a set of small-sample surveys. The documented \nconsultations confirm widespread support for the Project. The poor condition of the roads\u2014\nincluding feeder roads to farms, gardens, and other aldeias\u2014was cited as a major concern by \nfive of nine focus groups. It was followed by lack of access to income-generating opportunities, \nwhich is closely related to the existing poor road conditions that prevent easy access to market \nactivity centers. Lack of access to other primary facilities such as a water supply system, health-\ncare facilities, and schools is considered by many as a high-priority issue. Reliable figures are \nnot available to quantify unemployment and underemployment in the project area, however \nlabor  demand  is  highly  seasonal  because  most  local  residents  are  subsistence  or  near-\nsubsistence farmers. Community consultations confirmed people\u2019s strong desire to participate in \nthe  Project  as  wage  laborers  during  road  rehabilitation,  and  their  willingness  to  carry  out \ncommunity-based maintenance activities once the roads are improved. \n61.  The gender division of labor and women\u2019s traditional exclusion from the benefits derived \nfrom  road  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  works  were  clearly  identified  during  focus  group \ndiscussions with public works constructors. The Project will seek modalities to promote gender \nequality  and  women\u2019s  greater  access  to  employment  opportunities  provided  by  road \nimprovement by encouraging civil works contractors to (i) increase the percentage of women \nworkers  to  30%  of  their  labor  force  (including  women\u2019s  involvement  in  at  least  75%  of \nbioengineering activities), and (ii) carry out gender-sensitive HIV/AIDS prevention and road \nsafety awareness in the project area. \n62.  Anecdotal evidence suggests an increase in the number of traffic accidents, with a \ncontinuing increasing trend as the road network is improved and overall traffic increases. The \nProject will carry out awareness campaigns for the local population in the project area (including \nvehicle operators as one target group) and safety education programs for school children. This \nawareness program will be accompanied by establishing checkpoints and posting warning signs \nat  the  entrance  of  each  residential  area  located  along  the  road  sections  to  be \nimproved/maintained to slow down traffic passing through the area. \n63.  Other than the HIV/AIDS and traffic safety issues, the Project will have no adverse \nimpact on vulnerable groups and no negative implication for indigenous people. No minority \nethnic groups or indigenous population groups are found in the project area. No resettlement \nplan will be necessary as the Project will occur within the existing alignment or on land owned \nby the Government. \nC.  Environmental Impacts \n64.  The Project is classified as environmental category B, as all road improvement activities \nwill  be  confined  to  existing  rights-of-way,  and  no  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  will  be \nrequired. Field surveys in the areas of roads selected for rehabilitation and improvement were \nconducted  to  assess  environmental  impacts  of  the  Project,  and  an  initial  environmental \nexamination  (IEE)  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines 2003 the summary of which is presented in Appendix 11. The IEE findings support \nthe overall category B (nonsensitive) classification for the Project. \n65.  The Project does not pass through protected areas and will have no impact on native \nfauna  and  flora.  The  construction  of  improved  drainage  structures,  stabilization  of  slopes \nthrough bioengineering, replanting of trees, and other measures undertaken by the Project will \nhave long-term beneficial effects on the environment. The frequency and severity of landslides \nwill be reduced along the project roads. The replanting of trees and native vegetation will \nstabilize the landscape, may help improve water quality, and will enhance scenic beauty. \n ", "16 \n66.  Short-term impacts will be unavoidable, such as traffic delays, noise, dust, and other \ntemporary impacts such as loss of vegetation due to earth moving. These impacts will be \ndirectly related to rehabilitation operations and will end with the completion of rehabilitation. As a \nresult, required mitigation measures are minor. Adherence to best engineering practices during \nthe rehabilitation phase and strict enforcement of the environmental management plan (EMP) \nwill avoid or adequately mitigate all of the rehabilitation-related impacts.   \nD.  Project Risks \n67.  The design of the Project has taken into account potential risks associated with the \nproject management and rehabilitation quality. The Project will maintain and expand the PMU \nestablished for EIRP-2 to strengthen its capacity so that it can handle greater responsibilities. A \nteam of international and domestic consultants will be provided for construction supervision. A \ncommunity empowerment program, dealing with road safety, HIV/AIDS, and other social risks, \nwill be implemented by an NGO. Environmental impact will be monitored through construction \nsupervision  and  mitigated  at  the  rehabilitation  stage  in  accordance  with  the  EMP.  Project \nsustainability will be enhanced by ensuring rehabilitation quality, training Government officials, \nidentifying low-cost maintenance modalities, and establishing maintenance policies for the road \nsector and project roads. \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n68.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the Grant Agreement: \n(i)  Counterpart financing. The Government will make available on a timely basis \n$2.5 million from its ordinary budgetary allocations as counterpart financing to \nensure completion of the Project. \n(ii)  Project management. The Government, through MPW, will maintain the PMU \nestablished under EIRP-2 and will provide office accommodation for the PMU. \n(iii)  Progress reports. During project implementation, the Government, through the \nPMU,  will  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  project  progress  reports  and  a  project \ncompletion report within 3 months after physical completion of the Project.  \n(iv)  Rehabilitation quality. The Government, through the PMU, will ensure that the \nproject  roads  are  rehabilitated  in  accordance  with  the  design  technical \nspecifications, and that construction supervision, quality control, and contract \nmanagement  are  carried  out  in  accordance  with  internationally  accepted \nstandards.  \n(v)  Road maintenance policy. Six months before completion of the Project, the \nGovernment,  assisted  by  the  road  maintenance  consultant,  will  establish \nmaintenance policies for the road sector and project roads, including budget and \nimplementation arrangements, and submit them through the PMU to ADB for \nreview.  \n(vi)  Environment. The Government, through the PMU, will ensure that (a) the IEE is \nreviewed and updated at the engineering design stage; (b) the Project complies \nwith the EMP reflected in the updated IEE, all applicable national environmental \nlaws, regulations, and guidelines, and ADB's Environment Policy (2002); (c) the \nEMP  in  the  IEE  is  reflected  as  part  of  bidding  documents  and  civil  works \ncontracts; (d) any adverse environmental impacts arising from the Project are ", "17 \nminimized  by  implementing  the  agreed  mitigating  measures;  and  (e) \nenvironmental monitoring is done properly by the construction supervision team.  \n(vii)  Project performance monitoring and evaluation. The Government, through \nthe PMU, assisted by the international and domestic consultants engaged under \nthe  Project,  will  monitor  and  evaluate  project  impacts.  The  Government  will \ndiscuss and agree with ADB on the indicators and baseline data prepared by \nthese consultants prior to the commencement of civil works, and will ensure that \nthe consultants monitor and compare the data during project implementation and \nat project completion. The Government, through the PMU, will submit monitoring \nand evaluation reports to ADB 1 month after the completion of the consultants\u2019 \nfield work. To the extent possible, the indicators and baseline data will make full \nuse of gender-disaggregated data and information. \n(viii)  Labor laws. The Government, through the PMU, will ensure that civil works \ncontractors comply with all applicable labor laws and related international treaty \nobligations, and do not employ child labor for rehabilitation and maintenance \nactivities.  \n(ix)  Road safety. The Government will ensure that MPW installs appropriate road \nsafety  facilities  during  project  implementation,  including  pavement  markings, \ntraffic signs and signals, warning signs, and hazard barriers. \n(x)  Land acquisition and resettlement. The Government will ensure that all project \nrehabilitation works are undertaken within existing rights-of-way. In the event of \nany unforeseen resettlement, the Government will inform ADB and prepare a \nresettlement plan or plans according to relevant laws and regulations, and ADB\u2019s \nPolicy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995).  The  PMU  will  ensure  that  no \nconstruction of civil works commences until ADB has reviewed and approved the \nresettlement plan/s. \n(xi)  Gender and development. The PMU will (a) encourage local contractors to \nemploy 30% of women in road rehabilitation and labor-intensive maintenance of \nselected  national  roads  (including  at  least  75%  of  those  employed  for \nbioengineering activities), (b) provide equal pay to men and women for work of \nequal type in accordance with national laws and international treaty obligations, \nand  (c)  provide  safe  working  conditions  for  both  male  and  female  workers. \nSpecific provisions to this effect will be included in the bidding documents. The \nPMU will be responsible for monitoring the employment targets for women by \nreviewing  periodically  the  payroll  statements  of  the  construction  contractors \nthrough  the  engagement  of  CARE  Timor-Leste,  and  will  reflect  progress  in \nachieving the employment targets for women in the project progress reports and \nproject completion report. \n(xii)  Health risks. The PMU will ensure that all civil works contractors engaged under \nthe Project participate in the HIV/AIDS prevention and road safety program to be \nfunded under the Project in the construction campsites. In addition, the PMU will \nensure that similar information on the risk of transmission of HIV/AIDS and other \nsexually transmitted diseases is disseminated to local communities in the corridor \nof influence, in coordination with national agencies working on this issue. The \nPMU will include specific provisions to this effect in civil works contracts, and will \nstrictly monitor compliance through CARE Timor-Leste. \n ", "18 \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n69.  I am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove the grant of $10 million to the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste for the Road Sector \nImprovement Project from ADB's Special Funds resources with terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Grant Agreement presented to the \nBoard. \n \n \n \n \nJOSEPH B.

Overview \n1.  During the process of identifying and designing the Project, consultations were held at \nvarious levels, involving a broad range of stakeholder groups and over 600 individuals. The \nconsultations were conducted in the form of (i) a large stakeholder workshop; (ii) key informant \ninterviews at district, subdistrict, village, and hamlet levels; (iii) focus group discussions; and \n(iv) a set of small-sample surveys of local households, passengers, vehicle operators, freight \noperators, and shops throughout the country. The list of the consultations is as follows: \n(i)  large consultation workshop, The Future of Timor-Leste\u2019s Road Sector, (over 50 \nparticipants  from  government  agencies,  international  organizations,  local  and \ninternational nongovernment organizations (NGOs), March 2005; \n(ii)  field  consultations  throughout  the  country,  which  included  key  informant \ninterviews  at  district,  subdistrict,  village,  and  hamlet  levels,  focus  group \ndiscussions,  small  sample  surveys  of  local  population,  vehicle  operators, \npassengers, freight shippers, and shops, between March and May 2005; and  \n(iii)  consultations  to  assess  the  needs  and  practicality  of  increasing  community \nparticipation  in  the  project  implementation  with  NGOs  and  other  parties \nconcerned, May 2005. \n2.  These  consultations  serve  as  the  basis  for  the  social  and  poverty  analyses  of  the \nProject.  The  insights  obtained  are  incorporated  in  the  project  design  in  the  form  of  a \nparticipation  strategy  in  general  and  for  women,  and  in  the  mitigation  measures  and \ncomplementary  actions  to  increase  the  Project's  benefits  received  by  the  poor  and  other \nvulnerable groups. \nB.  Stakeholder Consultation Workshop \n3.  The first consultation workshop, The Future of Timor-Leste\u2019s Road Sector, was held at \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)\u2013World  Bank  (WB)  Conference  Room  with  over  50 \nparticipants  from  various  departments  of  the  Government  of  Timor-Leste,  international \ndevelopment agencies such as the Japan International Cooperation Agency, and international \nand local NGOs. The workshop was very well received and greatly enhanced the understanding \nof the Project among the parties concerned, with the participants actively engaging in the \ndiscussions. The topics covered in the workshop are (i) project goals and general approach, (ii) \nprioritizing road investments, (iii) commercial management and financing roads, (iv) social and \npoverty analyses, and (v) presentation on environmental analysis. The workshop was attended \nby the following organizations: \n(i)  Government: Directorate General of Roads, Bridges, and Flood Control; district \nadministration  (Aileu,  Bobonaro,  Dili,  Ermera,  Lautem,  Oecusse,  Suai,  and \nViqueque);  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Forestry,  and  Fisheries;  and  Ministry  of \nPlanning and Finance\u2014Treasury; \n(ii)  international organizations: Japan International Cooperation Agency; \n(iii)  nongovernment  organizations:  Associacao  Mai  Halibur  Hamutuk,  Associacao \ndos Ex-Presineros Politicos, Associacao dos Veteranos Das Falintil, Christian \nChildren Fund, Comite Mediasi dan Advocacy Hak-Hak Buruh (Come Right),East \nTimor Agriculture Development Program, Fundacao Creshe 12 de Novembro, \nFundacao De Espinhos Da Rosa, Feto Ki\u2019ik Servico Hamutuk,Fundasaun Terus \nAtu Ukun Rasik An (Fundasaun TAURAN), GERTIL FAUTL, Hotu Hotu Fo Lima ", "  Appendix 3  23 \nTane  Timor  Oan,  World  Vision  People\u2019s  Economic  Development  Center, \nFundasaun Dame no Demokrasia, and Peace Winds Japan. \nC.  Field Consultations \n4.  The local population was consulted between 18 March and 5 May 2005 to assess their \nneeds, demands, and willingness to support the Project; socioeconomic status; and absorptive \ncapacity in Bobonaro, Ermera, Manatuto, Baucau, and Viqueque districts. The consultations \nincluded 10 key informant interviews with district administrators, district deputy administrators, \ndistrict development officers, suco (village) chiefs, and other key figures in villages; nine focus \ngroup  discussions  with  seven  participants  on  average;  and  small-sample  surveys  of  local \nhouseholds, local population, passengers, vehicle operators, freight shippers, and shops (about \n400 survey responses in total). \nD.  Key Informant Interviews \n5.  The key informant interviews serve multiple purposes. A key feature is that, by engaging \nthe potential beneficiaries, it was found how much the informants support the Project and what \nconcerns they have about the Project. Next, it was observed directly the degree and depth of \npoverty evident in the area, which helps justify the estimates of the number of poor and very \npoor beneficiaries. The interviews also show the relative importance of other concerns held by \nthe beneficiaries, and how improving the roads ranks relative to other needed public works \nprojects and needed provision of other public services. \n6.  Prior  to  visiting  villages  and  markets  for  interviews  and  surveys,  meetings  were \nconducted with respective district administrators, deputy district administrators, and/or district \ndevelopment officers; basic socioeconomic information on the district was gathered. With the \noverall picture of the district, villages were visited and markets located along the potential roads \nto be improved. Key village informant interviews were conducted with suco chiefs and/or other \nkey persons in the village, such as school teachers. The villages for key informant interviews \nwere selected to obtain a representative picture of the area. Those interviewed are listed in \nTable A3.1. \n \nTable A3.1: List of Interview Participants \nName  Title  District  Subdistrict  Village \nMarcelino Ferreira Neto  District Development Officer  Baucau  \u2014  \u2014 \nLeonel de Jesus Carvalho  District Administrator   Bobonaro  \u2014  \u2014 \nJustino Viegas Amaral  Village Chief/School Teacher  Bobonaro  Bobonaro  Tapo \nSilvino Cardoso  Village Chief  Bobonaro  Bobonaro  Lourba \nJoao Mestre  District Development Officer  Ermera  \u2014  \u2014 \nDomingos Magalhaes  Village Chief  Ermera  Letefoho  Haufu \nPedro Afonso Soares  Village Chief/School Teacher  Ermera  Letefoho  Catrai \nLeten \nDuarte Martins  Village Chief  Ermera  Hatulia  Hatulia \nGaspar Da Silva  District Development Officer   Manatuto  \u2014  \u2014 \nFrancisco Da Silva  District Administrator        \nEstevao  District Development Officer   Viqueque  \u2014  \u2014 \nSabino  District Administrative Officer       \nSource:  ADB.  2001.

The information gathered through key informant interviews included population; number \nof households and average household size; ethnic distribution; availability of public and private \n ", "24  Appendix 3 \ntransport; availability of and average distance to schools, health facilities, electricity, running \nwater, and economic centers; major economic activities and main income sources; average \nincome; and the educational status of the population. Key informant interviews also provided \nuseful insights into basic infrastructure community programs. \nE.  Focus Group Discussions \n8.  Following  the  key  informant  interviews,  separate  focus  group  discussions  were \nconducted  with  female  and  male  participants  in  selected  villages  to  assess  the  villagers' \nperceptions of poverty, basic poverty profiles, and potential impact of road improvement on the \neconomic and social development of the village, and to obtain information on gender-specific \nissues and concerns. To provide the opportunity for different gender groups to express their \nviews  more  comfortably,  a  female  interviewer  facilitated  and  recorded  the  focus  group \ndiscussions for females, and a male interviewer for the men. The list of focus group discussions \nheld is provided in Table A3.2. \n9.  Nine focus group discussions were conducted, of which five were male focus group \ndiscussions, and four, female. Each discussion consisted of three to eight persons and lasted \nfrom  one-  to  one-and-a-half  hours.  The  villagers  were  very  willing  to  participate  in  lively \ndiscussions, and the proposed Project received overwhelming positive responses from the \nvillagers.  Roads  are  considered  as  one  of  the  main  issues  of  their  concern,  and  road \nimprovement  is  perceived  very  important  for  their  daily  living.  Thus,  virtually  all  of  the \nrespondents expressed their strong desire to participate in the construction as wage laborers \nand their willingness to carry out community-level maintenance activities. \nTable A3. 2: Focus Group Discussions \nNumber of \nDistrict  Subdistrict  Village  Focus Discussion Group \nParticipants \nBobonaro  Bobonaro  Lourba  Male  9 \nBobonaro  Bobonaro  Lourba  Female  10 \nBobonaro  Bobonaro  Oeleo  Male  3 \nErmera  Letefoho  Haufu  Female  5 \nErmera  Letefoho  Haufu  Male  7 \nErmera  Hatulia  Hatulia  Male  8 \nErmera  Hatulia  Hatulia  Female  8 \nViqueque  Ossu  Ossu de Cima  Male  7 \nViqueque  Ossu  Ossu de Cima  Female  4 \nSource: ADB. 2001.

Small-sample  surveys  comprised  a  total  of  about  400  survey  responses  including \ndetailed household interviews, and surveys of local population, vehicle operators, passengers, \nfreight shippers, and shops. These surveys were conducted in the areas, including market \nplaces, along the potential roads to be improved, except freight shipper surveys. The freight \nshipping sector is underdeveloped in Timor-Leste, and virtually all freight shippers are within \nDili, thus the surveys were conducted in Dili. \n11.  Each surveyed group provided information critical to performing the poverty and social \nanalyses,  and  to  providing  ideas  about  the  best  complementary  actions  and  mitigation \nmeasures. Moreover, the group survey responses reinforced the method used to estimate the ", "  Appendix 3  25 \nnumber of beneficiaries and of poor and very poor beneficiaries. The passenger and local \npopulation  surveys  show  how  the  poor  and  very  poor  use  the  roads,  which  is  a  critical \nparameter  to  the  poverty  impact  assessment.  The  survey  collected  a  great  deal  more \ninformation  about  the  passengers  and  local  population.  For  example,  the  results  provide \ninformation on the degree of difficulty people experience in accessing schools and hospitals, \nand how they believe an improved road would affect them, which would form a critical part of \nthe social analysis. The vehicle operator survey provides information on the structure and \nperformance of the transportation services markets, which are also key parameters for the \npoverty impact analysis.  \n12.  Both  the  detailed  household  and  the  local  population  surveys  collected  basic \nsocioeconomic information on local households. While they are similar in many ways, they differ \nin that the detailed household survey is designed mainly for the social analysis to (i) obtain more \ndetailed information on household income sources, expenditure items, and household living \nstatus than the local population surveys; and (ii) assess the individual perspective on poverty, \ngender roles, and concerns. \nG.  Consultations to Assess the Prospect of Increasing Community Participation in \nProject Implementation \n \n13.  During the ADB Fact-Finding Mission in May 2005, meetings were conducted with staff \nfrom a number of local and international NGOs; Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries; \nand East Timorese consulting firms and civil works contractors (for the list of the consulted \norganizations, see Table A3.3). The main purpose was to identify and assess, in the specific \ncontext of Timor-Leste: the pros and cons of community-based, labor-intensive rehabilitation \nand maintenance of roads; appropriate modalities to increase women's participation in the \nProject in a culturally sensitive and acceptable manner; adequate methods to address the issue \nof HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infection (STI); and the capacity of East Timorese NGOs \nto carrying out the community empowerment component of the Project. \nTable A3.3: Consulted Organizations \nName  Type of Organization \nAssociation HAK (Association for Law,  East Timorese nongovernment organization \nHuman Rights and Justice) \nCare International in Timor-Leste  International nongovernment organization \nCaritas  International nongovernment organization \nCarya Timor-Leste  East Timorese civil works contractor \nKaiwatu Kmanek (KWK) Consultant  East Timorese consulting firm \nLao Hamutuk  East Timorese nongovernment organization \nMinistry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries   \nNongovernment Organization Forum  Umbrella organization for East Timorese nongovernment \nTimor-Leste  organizations \nOxfam Australia  International nongovernment organization \nPT Gunung Kijiang  East Timorese civil works contractor \nRede Feto Timor-Leste  Umbrella organization for East Timorese  \nnongovernment organizations working on women\u2019s \nissues \nPT = perseroan terbatas (limited liability company).  \nSource:  ADB.  2001.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries carries out, under the Agricultural \nRehabilitation Project, community-based feeder road rehabilitation activities. Considering the \npossibility of applying a similar approach to the proposed Project, the Mission met with the \nministry's  irrigation  adviser  to  assess  the  past  performance  of  such  projects,  problems \nencountered, and actual procedures of implementing such projects. \n15.  Meetings were also conducted with a number of organizations (both East Timorese and \ninternational), which included the NGO Forum Timor-Leste; Rede Feto Timor-Leste; and major \ninternational NGOs working extensively in the areas of community empowerment and rural \ndevelopment in Timor-Leste, such as Care International, Caritas, and Oxfam Australia. The \nmeetings were to obtain feedback on a range of issues, including the capacity of East Timorese \nNGOs, appropriate measures to address HIV/AIDS and STI issues in the cultural context of \nTimor-Leste, and modalities to promote the participation of women and other vulnerable groups \nin project implementation. \n16.  To assess the practicality of placing gender-inclusive modalities in the project design \nand addressing HIV/AIDS and STI issues with construction workers, meetings were conducted \nwith two East Timorese civil works contractors and one East Timorese consulting firm. These \nfirms have been working on similar civil works projects in Timor-Leste using local laborers. \nInformation was obtained on their hiring practices and their views and opinions on including \nemployment quota requirements for women and the poor, and on how culturally sensitive issues \nsuch as HIV/AIDS and STI should be addressed. The feedback and opinions received are \nreflected throughout the project design. \n ", "  Appendix 4  27 \nCOST ESTIMATE AND FINANCING PLAN \n($ \u2018000) \n \n          ADB    Government   \n  Foreign  Local  Total  Foreign  Local  Total  Foreign  Local  Total \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost  Exchange  Currency  Cost  Exchange  Currency  Cost \nA.

Objectives and Scope \n1.  The community empowerment component of the Road Sector Improvement Project aims \nto  strengthen  the  capacity  of  rural  communities  to  respond  to  the  risks  and  opportunities \nassociated with increased connectivity to the national roads. The three subcomponents will \ninclude (i) sustainable rehabilitation and maintenance of rural feeder roads in one selected \nsubdistrict; (ii) HIV/AIDS prevention and road safety program along the project roads, which \ninclude Aituto\u2013Same [A05], Viqueque\u2013Uatucarbau [A08], Oeleu\u2013Zumalai [A16], and Iliomar\u2013\nLospalos [A08]; and (iii) monitoring of the employment target for women. Consulting services \nwill  be  provided,  during  the  2  years  of  project  implementation,  by  an  international \nnongovernment  organization  (NGO)  with  expertise  in  community-based  and  labor-intensive \ninfrastructure development and service delivery in the project area. This integrated approach to \ncommunity empowerment\u2014connecting isolated communities to main roads, primary facilities, \nand/or markets while providing skills necessary for economic activities and raising awareness \non  health  and  safety  related  issues\u2014is  likely  to  bring  significant  benefits  to  participating \ncommunities as a whole, building upon extensive experience and demonstrated success of \ninternational NGOs working in one selected district. \nB.  Project Subcomponents \n2.  Subcomponent A: Sustainable Rehabilitation and Maintenance of Rural Feeder \nRoads.  This  component  aims  to  empower  local  communities  to  ensure  community-based, \nlabor-intensive, and sustainable rehabilitation and maintenance of rural feeder roads in one \nselected subdistrict along the project road. The subcomponent will support (i) participatory and \ngender-inclusive identification and selection of rural feeder roads to be rehabilitated under the \nProject; (ii) training of local communities (focusing on veterans, other disaffected stakeholder \ngroups, and the youth) on labor-intensive road rehabilitation and maintenance, combined with \nmanagement and business skills transfer; (iii) training of women (with focus on widows and \nwomen who are household heads) in bioengineering and agricultural extension, combined with \nliteracy, food nutrition, reproductive health and HIV/AIDS prevention, road safety management, \nand business skills transfer; (iv) rehabilitation of selected rural feeder roads that are required to \ndirectly connect to the project trunk roads; and (v) design of gender-inclusive modalities to \nensure sustainable maintenance of rehabilitated feeder roads. The subcomponent will support \nan integrated approach to community empowerment and contribute to (i) reducing travel time; \n(ii)  supporting  basic  needs  for  water  supply,  energy,  and  food  security;  (iii)  ensuring \nuninterrupted access to basic social services (health and education) and markets where the \nlocal farmers can sell their products; (iv) promoting income-generating opportunities; and (v) \nensuring the mitigation of HIV/AIDS and road safety risks associated with road construction. \n3.  Specific features of the subcomponent include \n(i)  consulting with the Ministry of Public Works (MPW)/project management unit \n(PMU), and relevant central and district government agencies on the proposed \nsubdistrict community empowerment initiatives; \n(ii)  selecting rural feeder roads to be rehabilitated from among those connecting \nrural communities to the main project roads to be rehabilitated or maintained \nunder the other two project components;1 \n                                                 \n1  The selection and length of the feeder roads will be done by mutual understanding between the NGO and ADB. ", "  Appendix 7  31 \n(iii)  ensuring that quality road engineering assessment and detailed design for the \nrehabilitation of the rural feeder roads are carried out, by recruiting national \nand/or international engineering consultants, as needed; \n(iv)  ensuring  the  effective  involvement  of  women  and  women\u2019s  groups  in  the \nconsultative  process  for  identifying  and  selecting  rural  feeder  roads  to  be \nrehabilitated under the Project; \n(v)  ensuring vulnerable groups (veterans, the youth, widows and female heads of \nhouseholds,  and  other  disaffected  stakeholders)  are  targeted  for  the  skills \ntransfer activities to be funded under the Project; and \n(vi)  organizing  training  and  labor  skills  transfer  activities  so  that  they  are \nappropriately timed and sequenced with the rural communities\u2019 involvement in \nproject activities. \n4.  Subcomponent B: HIV/AIDS Prevention and Road Safety. The international NGO will \nprovide a broad range of HIV/AIDS and road safety awareness programs to target high-risk \ngroups,  including  local  construction  workers,  long-distance  drivers,  and  women  in  the \nconstruction campsites and corridors of influence. The programs will include (i) publication of \ninformation, education, and communication materials on HIV/AIDS and reproductive health for \nilliterate  communities;  (ii)  behavior  change  communication  on  HIV/AIDS  and  reproductive \nhealth,  including  family  planning;  (iii)  socioculturally  sensitive  condom  awareness  and \navailability  in  construction  camps  and  corridors  of  influence;  and  (iv)  dissemination  of \neducational and advisory materials on road safety. Emphasis will be on ensuring women's \neffective involvement in the design and implementation of the HIV/AIDS prevention and road \nsafety program. \n5.  The Government\u2019s commitment to ensure effective participation of construction workers \nat campsites in the HIV/AIDS prevention and road safety program to be funded under the \nProject is covenanted in the Assurances section of the grant document. \n6.  Subcomponent C: Monitoring of the Employment Targets for Women. In line with \nthe project goal of promoting increased access by women to opportunities provided by road \nrehabilitation and maintenance, the international NGO, in coordination with MPW/PMU, will be \nresponsible for monitoring the implementation of employment targets for women under the \nProject, which will encourage public works contractors to increase the percentage of women \nworkers to 30% of wage-laborers (including at least 75% of bioengineering activities). \n7.  The  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  ensure  the  enforcement  of  specific  employment \ntargets for women is covenanted in the Assurances section of the grant document. \nC.

Implementation Arrangements \n9.  A qualified international NGO, which will affiliate with domestic NGOs, will be recruited \nfor not more than 24 months to implement the component. The international NGO will be \nretained  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants, based  on  direct  selection \nprocedure. To be eligible for funding, the international NGO must have (i) long-term presence \nand credibility in working with local communities in districts adjacent to the project roads; (ii) \ndemonstrated track record of involvement in community-based and labor-intensive infrastructure \ndevelopment  and  service  delivery;  (iii)  involvement  in  promoting  socioculturally  sensitive \nHIV/STI prevention and road safety in the project roads; (iv) extensive experience in working \nwith and strengthening the capacity of local NGOs in the project area; and (v) expertise in the \nproposed areas of agricultural extension services, food nutrition issues, and rural development \nin general. The services are expected to commence in the second half of 2006 or 3 months \nbefore the commencement of the road rehabilitation and to be completed 2 years later in 2008. \nEquipment, supplies, and materials under the component will be procured following ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. The equipment will be turned over to the local communities after \ngrant completion. \nE.  Monitoring and Reporting \n10.  The  international  NGO  will  produce  an  inception  report  2  months  after  the \ncommencement of services, and submit quarterly progress reports and a final report to the PMU \nand ADB. It will submit a draft final report covering all subjects and requirements after the \ncompletion of all activities. The final report will include comments from the Government and \nADB 30 days after the final tripartite meeting of the Government, ADB, and the international ", "  Appendix 7  33 \nNGO. The report will be submitted in English and should include technical analysis supported by \ndata, with administrative and other details in appendixes. \n11.  The component will be monitored based on indicators including (i) women\u2019s inclusion in \nthe  processes  of  identification  and  selection  of  rural  feeder  roads;  (ii) veterans\u2019  and  other \ndisaffected stakeholder groups\u2019 inclusion in the process of identification and selection of rural \nfeeder roads; (iii) meeting the employment targets for women workers; (iv) visits to health \nfacilities and local markets; (v) acquired labor skills in bioengineering, feeder roads built, and \nagricultural extension; (vi) knowledge on literacy, nutrition, reproductive health, and HIV/AIDS \nprevention; and (vii) knowledge on road safety, management and business skills acquired, and \ngender-inclusive  modalities  for  sustainable  maintenance  of  rural  feeder  roads.  Specific \nindicators will be established by mutual understanding between the NGO and the PMU, along \nwith conditions that will enable the NGO to achieve the targets set through the indicators within \nthe time frame of the Project and within the agreed-upon final budget. \n \n \n ", "34  Appendix 8 \nROAD SECTOR ANALYSIS \nA.  Road Network \n1.  Roads, the dominant mode of transport in Timor-Leste, carry about 70% of freight and \n90%  of  passenger  traffic.  The  road  network  is  dense  compared  with  other  countries  with \ncomparable income levels. The total length of the road network is estimated at 6,040 kilometers \n(km), consisting of 1430 km of national roads linking district centers, 870 km of district roads, \nproviding links to large administrative centers, and 720 km in Dili and several smaller regional \ntowns. The remaining 3,020 km comprises rural access or feeder roads. Urban roads represent \nabout 800 km and feeder/rural roads roughly 3,020 km. About 1,800 km of roads are paved, \nrepresenting a relatively large part of the core network (84%). Almost 100% of the national \nroads are paved, and all were paved at some time. \n2.  The road network is strongly influenced by its spatial and physical environment. A main \narterial road runs along the semiarid northern coast, serving the economic activity around Dili \nand trade connections by sea and to the west. Connections with the southern economic zone \ncross a mountainous and midland area, which includes steep lands of unstable rock and poor \nsoils  that  are  highly  susceptible  to  erosion  and  landslides.  Most  of  the  north\u2013south  road \nconnections are impassable year-round at this time. The southern coastal zone, which has \nhigher population density, agricultural production, and energy reserves, has a moisture climate \nand comprises alluvial formations and numerous rivers which are prone to changing course \nduring the monsoon. The network is thus vulnerable to natural hazards of erosion and flooding, \nand access is frequently cut at high-risk locations during the wet season and frequently remains \nimpassable during the dry season. The terrain and low standard of roads limit the support \nprovided to the economy in the south and midlands, such as coffee and agriculture, and soon \nenergy resources. \n3.  The extensive road network was constructed with relatively low standards of design and \nmaterials. A pragmatic approach adapting to the often severe terrain conditions were obviously \nused,  resulting  in  a  very  low  horizontal  and  vertical  geometrical  standard  in  mountainous \nregions. The road widths appear to have been compromised according to the actual terrain \nconditions, resulting in many very narrow roads. While 100% of national roads and 71% of \ndistrict roads were bitumen paved, shoulders are often constructed out of impervious earthen \nmaterial. This, combined with the difficult geological conditions, torrential rains, and lack of \nmaintenance, has caused rapid deterioration of the road system. Only 24% of national roads \nand 11% of district roads are currently in good condition. \nB.  Traffic Volume \n4.  Traffic volume is small and concentrated around Dili. Traffic counts in 2000 showed that \none third of the road network outside urban centers carried more than 200 vehicles per day \n(with 15% carrying more than 500 vehicles per day, less than 2% carrying more than 1,000 \nvehicles per day). One third of the network carried less than 50 vehicles per day. Traffic counts \nconducted in 2005 suggest that the average daily traffic for motorized vehicles is about 160 on \nnational roads, 90 on district roads, 30 on rural roads, and 170 on urban roads. The heaviest \ntraffic flows, in excess of 400 vehicles per day, are on the northern coastal road. \n5.  The truck fleet consists almost entirely of light and medium-sized trucks, due to the \nnarrow winding mountainous roads, which are hardly passable for large trucks. The traffic \nloading on the roads is generally very light, and is not the cause of the poor condition of the \nroad network. This is evidenced by the fairly good shape of the payment structure in spite of a \ndamaged and washed-out surface due to adverse weather conditions and lack of maintenance \nfor more than a decade. In addition, the roads have little rutting\u2014normally a sign of overloading.  ", "  Appendix 8  35 \nC.  Transport Services \n6.  Walking is the most common mode of transportation, followed by small trucks and \nmicrobuses. Transport services are mainly provided by small-scale private companies, with one \nor two vehicles, and a small number of vehicle owner-operators. The Government has set \nminimum taxi fare rates, but has not set rates for passenger and freight buses and trucks. \nDrivers associations are apparently developing and setting rates. Passenger fares range from \n$0.50 to $3.00, depending on the distance, and average approximately $1.00 per one-way trip. \nThis is high and not affordable for many rural people, particularly, the poor. On the other hand, \nthe fares barely allow vehicle operators to achieve a decent living standard. Half of vehicle \noperators  and  owner-operators  are  estimated  to  be  living  below  the  national  poverty  line. \nOperating costs are high, with repair costs averaging about $1,500 per year. Nearly 50% of the \ntotal repair costs are caused by the poor road conditions. \nD.  Road Safety \n7.  Road fatalities are relatively high with more than 20 persons per 10,000 vehicles. A \nrecent study of available data gathered at the National Dili Hospital shows that the total number \nof patients from road traffic accidents reached 2,728 or an average of 114 patients per month in \n2002 and 2003. There were 41 deaths for the same period or an average of 2 deaths per month \nassociated with road traffic accidents. In 2003, 1,354 road traffic accident patients were treated \nat the emergency facility, accounting for 11% of all hospitalized patients in the same year. The \npotential for even greater accident rates is high, considering the increased number of vehicles, \ngrowing population, and increased vehicle speeds resulting from improvements to the road \nnetwork. A national road safety strategy was prepared, but implementation has not started. \nE.  Institutional Framework \n8.  The Government has made great progress in establishing the institutions necessary to \nrun the country. In the road sector, the Government has established much of the essential \nframework, including laws, institutions, and development plans. \n9.  In 2003, the Government introduced two laws to regulate and manage the road sector: \n(i) Basic Law for Vehicle Transport; and (ii) Road Code. The former covers rules and regulations \ngoverning  vehicle  registration,  road  charges,  passenger  and  freight  transport  services  and \npassenger fares, and planning and coordination of public infrastructure provision. The Road \nCode  covers  road  rules,  traffic  management,  classification  and  use  of  roads,  vehicle \ncategorization, fines, vehicle emissions, accident reporting, and licensing of drivers.  \n10.  The Directorate of Roads, Bridges, and Flood Control (DRBFC) of MPW is responsible \nfor  the  provision  and  management  of  road  infrastructure.  It  operates  through  a  central \nadministration and five regional offices (in, Baucau, Dili, Maliana, Oecussi and Same). The \nDirectorate  of  Equipment  and  Materials  manages  equipment  owned  by  the  Government. \nDRBFC  has  12  staff  with  engineering  qualifications,  out  of  a  total  of  91.  Due  to  historic \ncircumstances, DRBFC has a very limited capacity for strategic planning, project preparation \nand  implementation,  construction  supervision,  contract  management,  and  socioeconomic \nevaluation.  \nF.  Government Vision and Strategy  \n11.  The Government currently is faced with managing a degraded road network, which \nentails a very high cost for the reactive work needed to keep it functioning. The Government \ntherefore has set a 10-year vision for the road system to accomplish the following: \n ", "36  Appendix 8 \n(i)  Bring  the  road  network  up  to  a  sustainable  condition  where,  with  regular \nmaintenance, life-cycle costs will be minimized, road closures will be reduced \nand manageable, and road access will be reliable. \n(ii)  Improve key roads to support regional connectivity and a growing economy. \n(iii)  Ensure  effective  capacity  to  manage  the  road  system,  comprising  asset \nmanagement systems (including risk management), use of the private sector for \ncost-effective delivery,  and reliable funding and adequate cost-recovery from \nusers. \n12.  The Government has the following objectives for roads, bridges, and flood control: \n(i)  Identify the national, district, and rural road networks essential for the support of \neconomic and social development.  \n(ii)  Initiate policies within a legal and regulatory framework to improve quality of life, \nencourage  private  enterprise,  and  improve  access  and  safety  particularly  in \nimpoverished areas.  \n(iii)  Develop  roads,  bridges,  and  topologies  of  flood  control  that  provide \nenvironmental protection and reverse existing ecological damage.  \n(iv)  Ensure development and regulation for the safe circulation of transport.  \n(v)  Ensure transport infrastructure meets national defense imperatives, and establish \ntechnical standards for a national road network.  \n(vi)  Preserve  existing  road  assets  as  the  first  priority  through  sustainable \nmaintenance and long-term management plans for support systems.  \n(vii)  Establish  an  institutional  structure  and  develop  technical  and  administrative \ncapacity  of  East  Timorese  staff  to  manage,  maintain,  and  improve  the  road \nnetwork.  \n(viii)  Implement sustainable strategies for the maintenance of rural access roads.  \n(ix)  Establish  and  implement  erosion  control  measures  to  prevent  damage  to \nphysical  infrastructure  and  economically  valuable  property  (National \nDevelopment Plan, 2002:271). \nG.  Budget Allocation for Road Maintenance \n13.  According to the Ministry of Planning and Finance, the Government is expecting total \nrevenues to be above $100 million per year for an indefinite period, and total expenditures to be \nbetween $70 million and $80 million each year. The Government has committed about $190 \nmillion from the budget for road maintenance during the Project\u2019s life. This will be sufficient to \ncover the maintenance cost of the project roads, which only accounts for about 5% of the total \nbudget allocation for road maintenance, or $8.8 million during 18 years after project completion. \nH.  Main Issues and Challenges \n14.  The  Government  faces  a  number  of  challenges  with  respect  to  the  road  transport \ninfrastructure.  The  challenges  relate  mainly  to  financing  and  capacity  of  planning  and \nimplementing capital investment projects. Major issues include (i) rehabilitating roads in some \nlocations, (ii) moving from a reactive to a preventive approach regarding infrastructure works, \n(iii) orienting road design standards and maintenance practices in a way to minimize life-cycle \ntransport costs, (iv) developing sustainable arrangements for managing the rural road network, \n(v) addressing social impacts and involvement, (vi) providing additional resources and skills for \nDRBFC, and (vii) increasing spending levels to maintain the current road system. \n ", "  Appendix 9  37 \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \nA.  Traffic Analysis and Projections \n1.  Existing Traffic \n1.  Based on Timor-Leste\u2019s existing vehicle fleet, the following vehicle types were adopted \nfor the traffic analysis: (i) motorcycles; (ii) cars, jeeps, and four-wheel drives; (iii) pickups and \nvans; (iv) micro and minibuses (up to 20 seats); (v) medium and large buses (more than 20 \nseats); (vi) light trucks (less than 5 tons); and (vii) medium and heavy trucks (over 5 tons). \n2.  Traffic surveys were conducted on the proposed project road sections as a basis for \ndetermining average daily traffic. Seasonal patterns were used to obtain annual average daily \ntraffic, and adopted as normal traffic for 2005 (Table A9.1). \n \nTable A9.1: Annual Average Daily Traffic \nCategories of Vehicles  A05-01 and 02  A08-01  A12-02  A12-03 \nMotorcycles  108  43  106  67 \nCars/Jeeps and 4WD  32  4  158  66 \nPickups and Vans  25  12  185  73 \nMicro and Minibuses  86  23  132  66 \nMedium and Large Buses  0  13  12  6 \nLight Trucks  105  27  83  56 \nMedium and Heavy Trucks  43  25  86  52 \nTotal  399  147  762  386 \nA05-01 = Aituto-Betulala, A05-02 = Betulala-Same, A08-01 = Viqueque-Uatucarbau, A12-02 = Lourba-Zumalai, \nPhase I, A12-03 = Lourba-Zumalai, Phase II, 4WD = four-wheel drive. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n  2.  Traffic Forecast \n3.  Normal traffic growth rates were based on the projected gross domestic product (GDP) \ngrowth rate.1 Traffic growth rates for 2005\u20132024 were subsequently based on the income \nelasticity  for  the  national  transport  demand  in  relation  to  GDP  growth,  estimated  at  1.2. \nTherefore, growth for normal traffic is estimated at 6%.  \n4.  Generated traffic arises either because a journey becomes more attractive by virtue of a \ncost reduction or because of the increased development brought about by the road investment. \nFor all sections in very poor overall condition and for all the major improvement options, which \nwould bring up the condition level of the road to good, the generated traffic was assumed to \nrepresent 10% of the levels of normal traffic, once adjusted for seasonal patterns. Generated \ntraffic would occur during the first year after rehabilitation works end. Overall, generated traffic \naccounts for 4% of total traffic after the year of opening. To ensure conservative estimates, no \ntraffic is assumed to be generated for roads that are not in very poor overall condition.  \n5.  Volumes of traffic forecast on the project road sections are summarized in Table A9.2. \n                                                 \n1  International Monetary Fund medium-term outlook for Timor-Leste: 5% GDP growth per year. \n ", "38  Appendix 9 \nTable A9.2: Actual and Projected Average Traffic Volume (2005\u20132024) \n(vehicles per day) \nRoad Segment  Component  2005  2009  2014  2019  2024 \nA05 Jct\u2013Betulala  Normal Traffic  398  502  672  900  1,204 \n  Generated Traffic  0  50  69  95  131 \n  Subtotal  398  552  741  995  1,335 \nA10&A12 Jct\u2013Zumalai  Normal Traffic  387  489  654  875  1,171 \n  Generated Traffic  0  49  68  93  128 \n  Subtotal  387  538  722  968  1,299 \nBetulala\u2013Same  Normal Traffic  398  502  672  900  1,204 \n  Generated Traffic  0  0  0  0  0 \n  Subtotal  398  502  672  900  1,204 \nOeleu\u2013A10&A12 Jct  Normal Traffic  633  799  1069  1431  1,915 \n  Generated Traffic  0  0  0  0  0 \n  Subtotal  633  799  1,069  1,431  1,915 \nViqueque\u2013Uatucarbau  Normal Traffic  147  186  248  332  445 \n  Generated Traffic  0  0  0  0  0 \n  Subtotal  147  186  248  332  445 \n    Total  1963  2577  3452  4626  6198 \nJct = junction. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n6.

Economic Evaluation \n1.  General \n7.  The economic analysis was carried out for the three project roads by comparing the \nwith- and without-project scenarios using the highway design and management (HDM-4) model. \nThe economic analysis covers 20 years (2005\u20132024), based on a construction period of 1 year \nstarting in 2007. All benefits and costs are in constant 2005 prices. The economic prices are \nexpressed using the world price numeraire. \n8.  In the without-project scenario, the project road sections road are assumed to receive a \nminimum of maintenance and to continue to deteriorate from average roughness of 13.5 in 2008 \nto an average of 16 in 2016. Minimum maintenance means maintenance required to prevent the \nroads from collapsing. The with-project scenario includes routine and periodic maintenance.  \n9.  During  project  preparation,  various  mutually  exclusive  improvement  options  were \nconsidered, and the Project is based on the most cost-effective. In the with-project scenario, the \naverage level of roughness would decrease to about 4.5 in 2008 and only slightly vary thereafter \n ", "40  Appendix 9 \nto  reach  about  5.5  in  2015.  The  improvement  in  2008  reflects  that  substantial  road \nimprovements are gained through construction in 2007. \n  2.  Costs \n10.  Project economic costs include the financial construction costs of road improvement in \nterms of materials, equipment, labor, and consulting services. Taxes and duties are excluded. \nCosts were divided into tradable and nontradable components. The nontradable component is \nmade  of  labor  and  represents  5%  of  costs.  To  account  for  local  unemployment  and \nunderemployment, costs for labor were adjusted by a shadow wage rate factor of 0.50 to arrive \nat the economic opportunity cost. \n  3.  Benefits \n11.  Benefits are substantial on the three project roads because they have relatively high \ntraffic levels due to high agricultural and business activities, and because they are in overall \npoor or very poor condition. The main benefits comprise savings of vehicle operating costs and \ntime for road users, and of maintenance costs. \n12.  Vehicle operating costs include the costs of (i) spare parts replacement; (iii) gas and \ndiesel; (iv) lubricating oil; (v) maintenance labor; and (vi) crew wages. We used the economic \ncosts for inputs to the analysis. \n13.  The value of time as derived in the economic analysis is made of two components: (i) \nworking time and (ii) nonworking time. The value of working time during productive hours was \nderived from the per capita average income of $415 per year. A 48-hour work week and 48 \nweeks of work per year were assumed. The hourly value of working time used in the analysis \nwas therefore $0.180. Nonworking value of time was estimated to be a quarter of the value of \nworking  time,  or  $0.045  per  hour.  This  conservative  assumption  is  commonly  used  to \nacknowledge that time is a valuable resource, even if the time is not used to earn income. \nThese two values were used as inputs to the highway design and management model, along \nwith other assumptions made on vehicle characteristics, to determine the value of time at a \ndisaggregated  level.  Other  vehicle  characteristics  considered  are  (i)  annual  km  driven,  (ii) \nworking hours per year, (iii) percentage of private use of the vehicle, and (iv) work-related \npassenger trips. Based on a typical day of 8 hours of work and 16 hours of \u201cleisure\u201d or other \ntime, we estimate that the daily value of time would be around $2.20. \n14.  Table A9.5 shows the main benefits in terms of vehicle operating costs, as calculated by \nthe highway design and management model: \nTable A9.5: Vehicle Operating Costs by Vehicle Type \n(average for all project at end of opening year, 2008) \n($ per \u2018000 vehicle km) \nItem  Without Project  With Project  VOC Savings \nJeep and 4WD  492.1  319.4  172.7 \nLight Truck  373.7  272.2  101.5 \nMedium and Big Bus  380.1  273.6  106.5 \nMedium Truck  592.9  446.4  146.4 \nMicrobus and Minibus  340.0  262.2  77.8 \nMotorcycle  50.4  38.8  11.6 \nPickup and Van  373.5  264.7  108.8 \nTotal  2602.7  1877.3  725.3 \nVOC = vehicle operating cost, 4WD = four-wheel drive. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. ", "  Appendix 9  41 \n15.  Maintenance  cost  savings  are  derived  from  less  investment  required  on  the  newly \nrehabilitated roads. A road improvement project does not necessarily lead to a reduction in \nmaintenance  costs,  especially  when  without  the  project  the  road  is  not  maintained  at  all. \nHowever, the results on the priority roads project show that over the analysis period, the present \nvalue of capital cost after project implementation is smaller in the with-project scenario than with \nthe without-project scenario. \n  4.  Results of Economic Analysis \n16.  Using a 12% discount rate, the economic benefits for the infrastructure component of the \nProject are substantial. The net present value is $6.85 million and the economic internal rate of \nreturn (EIRR) is 24.1%. Benefits are made of (i) $14.68 million decrease in vehicle operating \ncosts, and (ii) $0.80 million in time savings. These benefits more than compensate for the \nincreased capital and recurrent costs of $8.62 million over the economic evaluation analysis \nperiod.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n   \nIs the sector identified as a national priority in country  Is the sector identified as a national priority in \npoverty analysis?  Yes  country poverty partnership agreement?  Yes \n \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste:  \n \nTimor-Leste is one of the poorest countries in the world. With a population between 750,000 and 1 million. Gross \ndomestic product (GDP) per capita was $405 in 2004, with more than 40% of the population living below the national \npoverty line of $15.44 per capita per month. Moreover, field surveys conducted in 2005 found that 88% of the \npopulation is poor and 46% are very poor, where the very poor are defined as having periods of food insecurity of 1 \nmonth or more per year. The literacy rate is around 40%; life expectancy is 57 years; and unemployment is high \nnationwide, especially among the youth. Coupled with this is a high incidence of disease, particularly tuberculosis, \nmalaria, dengue, and Japanese encephalitis, which are endemic. For every 1,000 births, there are 125 deaths, and \nthe maternal mortality rate is 890 per 100,000 births. Malnutrition is rife with 3\u20134% of children aged 6 months to 5 \nyears diagnosed as acutely malnourished and 20% chronically malnourished. \n \nThe focus of the Project on the rehabilitation and maintenance of national roads matches the priorities set forth by the \nGovernment in the national development plan. The entire road network, from feeder roads to national roads, is quickly \ndeteriorating and impassable at many points. The key element is to save the national road network, and then \nsequence improvements to district and rural feeder roads so that farmers are able to reach markets, and industries to \nchoose locations based on nontransport factors, such as availability of local labor and natural resources. The key \nobjective is to ensure connectivity between urban areas and agricultural production centers, ports, and markets. While \ncontributing to the overarching goal of poverty reduction, the rehabilitation of national roads should be complemented \nby a long-term strategy to ensure connectivity between national, district, and rural feeder roads, and cost-effective \nmodalities to ensure sustainable rehabilitation and maintenance of rural feeder roads. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                 Proposed Classification: General intervention \n \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nA detailed poverty impact assessment (PIA) and social analysis were conducted during the project preparatory \ntechnical assistance (TA). The TA consultants (i) held a stakeholder consultation workshop, key informant interviews, \nfocus group discussions, and field surveys to determine poverty prevalence; (ii) conducted distribution analysis; (iii) \nestimated the poverty impact ratio; (iv) developed poverty profiles and assessed the needs, demands, and absorptive \ncapacity of the project-affected groups; and (v) assessed the gender profiles, with emphasis on gender division of \nlabor and persistent gender-based discriminatory practices affecting women\u2019s effective access to the opportunities and \nbenefits provided by road rehabilitation and maintenance works. \n \nThe PIA analyzed the impact of the Project on the poor by determining the use of the roads by the poor and very poor, \nthe competitive conditions of the road transport services sector, and structural constraints that prevent more of the \nProject\u2019s benefits from being passed on to the poor. The PIA also distributed the economic net benefits among \ndifferent stakeholder groups, which include (i) poor, very poor, and non-poor passengers; (ii) vehicle operators and \nowners; (iii) freight shippers, and construction labor; and (iv) the Government. \n \nIn general, the surveys found that the prevalence of poverty is highest in the southwest region. The majority of the \nproject roads are in this region: Oeleu\u2013Zumalai (NR A 12) and Aituto\u2013Same (NR A 05). The project roads in the \nsoutheast region (Viqueque\u2013Uatucarbau, NR A 08) serve a relatively less poor area of the country, but the region is \npoor by any international standards. Malnutrition is evident in the corridors of influence in the southeast region as well. \nMoreover, the project road improvements in the southeast will reestablish connectivity of the region with the rest of the \ncountry,  thus  preventing  more  people  from  descending  into  poverty  and  hunger.  The  reestablishment  of  this \nconnectivity will allow residents of this region to have access to health care and educational services. \n \nThe social analysis analyzed the profile of local villages and villagers\u2019 perspectives on poverty and causes of poverty, \nidentified their needs and demands for socioeconomic development, and assessed the degree of their support to the \nProject and willingness to participate in the process. They identified roads as one of the main issues of concern, and \n ", "44  Appendix 10 \nroad  improvement  as  being  very  important  for  their  daily  living.  Thus,  the  reactions  from  local  villagers  are \noverwhelmingly positive; virtually all respondents expressed their desire to participate in the construction as wage \nlabors and their willingness to carry out community maintenance activities. \n \nThe impact of road construction on poverty reduction can be measured in terms of (i) anticipated reduction of \ntransportation costs to road passengers and freight users, (ii) increased benefits to rural communities in terms of \naccess to basic social services (education and health) and local markets, (iii) increased employment opportunities for \nunskilled laborers in the project area, and (iv) indirect and induced economic growth in the project-affected regions \nand the nation as a whole. \n \nThe estimated distribution analysis includes estimates for all of these listed quantifiable elements, but does not include \nan estimate of the benefits of improved access to health and education services; except indirectly through the induced \neffects on regional and national economies. \n \nBy far, the largest benefit comes from the economic and social development indirectly induced by the Project on the \nregional and national economies. This overall benefit to the economy is estimated to be $14 million in present value \nterms over the 20-year life of the Project. Approximately 40% of the total benefits, or about $5.6 million, to the \neconomy are likely to accrue to the poor. \n \nAt the project level, the benefits to passengers and passenger vehicle owners are estimated at $3.8 million, and the \nbenefits to freight shippers (i.e., users of freight shipping services, including small farmers) and owners of freight \nvehicles are estimated at $ 1.6 million, all in net present value terms over the 20-year life of the Project. The poor are \nestimated to capture between 19 and 24% of the Project\u2019s economic net present value of $5.4 million. The very poor, \na subgroup of the poor, will capture between 5% and 10% of the Project\u2019s economic net present value. Further, about \n6.9 million passengers (annual total) are expected to travel on the rehabilitated project road sections for a typical year, \nsuch as 2014. Of these, about 4.2 million will be poor passengers, or 61% of the total passengers, and 1.5 million, or \n21%, very poor.1\n \nThe direct causality between road rehabilitation and increased access to basic social services and in terms of \nemployment opportunities is maximized when the rehabilitation of national roads is combined with the rehabilitation of \nadjacent rural feeder roads, resulting in increased connectivity of rural communities to the national road networks. \nBased on the estimates made during the TA, a total of 62,000 people, of which 55,000 are poor and 28,000 are very \npoor, living in the corridors of influence of the core road sections to be rehabilitated are likely to benefit from the \nrehabilitation of the national roads. In addition, for the labor-intensive maintenance component for Iliomar\u2013Lospalos \nsection of national road A08, the component is estimated to benefit an additional 12,000 people, of which 11,000 are \npoor and 6,000 very poor. The third component, community empowerment initiatives, will rehabilitate selected feeder \nroads applying a community-based labor-intensive approach to connect isolated communities to one of the major \nroads to be rehabilitated or maintained under the Project or to the closest social facilities such as clinics or markets. \nThis  component  will  incorporate  skills  transfer  programs  in  the  areas  of  agricultural  extension,  food  nutrition, \nreproductive health, and bioengineering, with a particular emphasis on targeting women to ensure empowerment of \nvulnerable groups and the community as a whole. This integrated approach\u2014connecting isolated communities to main \nroads, primary facilities, and/or markets while providing skills necessary for economic activities and raising awareness \non health issues\u2014is likely to bring significant benefits to participating communities as a whole, building upon extensive \nexperience and demonstrated success of international NGOs working in the selected districts. \n \nBoth the main road rehabilitation component and the main road maintenance component will employ local laborers to \nprovide immediate income-generating opportunities. To promote women's participation, a number of components that \nwill not require specific construction skills have been identified for employing women, such as bioengineering, stone \nmasonry and gabion work, cleaning of drainage, and vegetation clearing. The main road rehabilitation component is \nexpected to create 169 person-years of employment opportunities for the local population, and the labor-intensive \nmaintenance component, 77 person-years, of which approximately 70% of the workers are expected to be poor. In \naddition, works contractors will be required to award 30% of the total wage-labor contracts to women. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  Based on estimates in Supplementary Appendix B: Poverty Impact Assessment. ", "  Appendix 10  45 \nC.  Participation Process \n \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? Yes \n \nDuring the TA, a broad range of stakeholders were identified and consulted by the consultant team and during TA fact-\nfinding  on  many  issues,  involving  the  pros  and  cons  of  community-based,  labor-intensive  rehabilitation  and \nmaintenance; culturally-sensitive modalities to increase employment opportunities for women involved in rehabilitation \nand maintenance; and ensuring adequate attention to human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency \nsyndrome (HIV/AIDS) prevention and road safety, in the specific context of Timor-Leste. Consultations included a \nlarge stakeholder consultation workshop; key informant interviews at district, subdistrict, village, and hamlet levels, as \nwell as with international and local NGOs, focus group discussions, and a set of small-sample surveys of local \nhouseholds, passengers, vehicle operators, freight shippers, and shops throughout the country. The stakeholders \nconsulted include staff from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries, who conduct community-based feeder \nroads and irrigation rehabilitation programs; the NGO Forum Timor-Leste (the umbrella organization for East Timorese \nNGOs); Rede Feto Timor-Leste (the umbrella organization for NGOs working on women's issues); major international \nNGOs working extensively in Timor-Leste such as Care International, Caritas, and Oxfam Australia; and East \nTimorese civil works contractors and consulting firms. Stakeholder analysis identified critical social and gender issues, \nand anticipated impacts that are reflected in the design features of the Project, and its increasing focus on ensuring \ngender-inclusive  modalities  for  road  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  and  increased  focus  on  community-based \nrehabilitation and maintenance. In all, over 600 stakeholders were consulted in the design of the Project.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy? Yes \n \nThe local population is mostly characterized by unskilled, unemployed, and/or underemployed laborers, eager to \nsupport the Project. They have a strong desire to benefit as wage laborers during the construction phase and are \nwilling to conduct community-based maintenance activities once the roads are rehabilitated. Project design features \nwill  allow  for  some  opportunities  of  interaction  and/or  consultation  with  local  communities  during  project \nimplementation as follows: (i) interaction with local communities in the design and implementation of HIV/AIDS \nprevention, reproductive health, and road safety programs along the project roads; (ii) labor-intensive community-\nbased maintenance of the national road for Iliomar\u2013Lospalos section of national road A08; and (iii) consultation with \nlocal communities on the selection of rural feeder roads to be rehabilitated under component three, and in the \nestablishment of cost-effective and gender-inclusive modalities of maintenance of selected rural feeder road to be \nfunded under the Project. \n \n \nD.  Gender and Development \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nTraditional  gender  division  of  labor  can  be  challenged  by  proactively  ensuring  women\u2019s  involvement  in  road \nrehabilitation and maintenance in a culturally sensitive manner. Areas identified by local constructors and surveyed \ncommunities for additional involvement of women include support services to construction camps and bioengineering. \nWomen\u2019s effective access to these employment opportunities will require targeted programs of labor skills transfer. In \nlight  of  women\u2019s  traditional  exclusion  from  the  employment  opportunities  and  benefits  associated  with  road \nconstruction,  the  TA  will  support  socioculturally  sensitive  modalities  to  ensure  women\u2019s  involvement  in  road \nrehabilitation and maintenance through the adoption of employment quotas. MPW, through the PMU, will require civil \nworks contractors to increase the percentage of women workers to 30% of wage-laborers (including at least 75% for \nbioengineering activities). Community empowerment initiatives for sustainable rehabilitation and maintenance of \nselected rural feeder roads (component three) will have a strong gender focus and include (i) participatory and gender-\ninclusive identification and selection of rural feeder roads to be rehabilitated under the Project; (ii) skills transfer to \nwomen in bioengineering, agroforestry, and agricultural extension, combined with literacy, nutrition, reproductive \nhealth, and HIV/AIDS prevention; and (iii) design of gender-inclusive modalities to ensure sustainable maintenance of \nrehabilitated feeder roads. The international NGO to be recruited under the community empowerment component will \nbe responsible for monitoring implementation of the HIV/AIDS employment targets for women under the Project. \n \nHas an output been prepared?

Introduction \n1.  This summary initial environmental examination (SIEE) provides information about the \ngeneral environmental settings of a project proposed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide technical assistance in preparing the feasibility study and preliminary design of a first-\nyear program for rehabilitation of roads in Timor-Leste. The SIEE summarizes the findings of \nthe initial environmental examination (IEE) regarding the potential impacts of the Project, their \nmagnitude and duration, and potentially affected groups. Mitigation measures are prescribed \nand an environmental management plan (EMP) has been prepared as an appendix to the full \nIEE.  The  Project  will  comply  with  the  environmental  provisions  of  both  ADB  and  the \nGovernment. The IEE procedure follows the provisions of ADB\u2019s Environmental Policy and \nguiding  framework  (2003  and  later  revisions)  and  the  Government\u2019s  Guideline  No.2a \n(Development Proposal and Pollution License Applications) of 2002. The IEE was submitted to \nthe Government in July 2005 and was approved on 23 August 2005.   \nB.  Description of the Project \n2.  The Project is a component of a 10-year road sector investment master plan and will be \nfinanced  by  a  grant  of  $10  million  from  ADB  and  a  contribution  of  $2.5  million  from  the \nGovernment. The environmental classification of the Project is category B.  \n3.  The road network is in poor to very poor condition and is continuously facing problems \nwith landslide-prone sections as well as rapid deterioration of the pavement during each rainy \nseason.  The  poor  roads  gravely  limit  transport  opportunities  to  such  an  extent  that  large \nproportions of the population have limited or no access to basic social services and markets. \nEven from a macro perspective, connectivity is limited. Not single, fairly good all-weather road \nconnects the north coast with the capital and export harbor in Dili, to the south coast with its rich \nagricultural potential. Two of the four project roads are connecting roads from the south to the \nnorth.  \n4.  The Project will produce the following outputs: (i) rehabilitation and improvement of \nabout 123 kilometers (km) of core network roads; (ii) labor-intensive routine road maintenance \nfor 45 km; (iii) sound and sustainable road maintenance policies; (iv) an efficient bidding and \ncontracting  system  for  engaging  communities  in  road  maintenance  through  local  small \ncontractors;  (v) improved  project  management,  supervision,  and  monitoring,  and  (vi) \nidentification  of  modalities  to  ensure  community-based,  gender-inclusive  rehabilitation  and \nmaintenance of rural feeder roads. Project activities include \n(i)  rehabilitation  of  three  road  sections  to  fair  conditions:  (a)  Oeleu\u2013Zumalai \n(35.9 km), (b) Aituto\u2013Same (30.8 km), and (c) Viqueque\u2013Uatucarbau (55.8 km), \nby strengthening the base, resurfacing, protecting and stabilizing slopes, and \nimproving drainage system and shoulders; \n(ii)  routine maintenance for Iliomar\u2013Lospalos (45 km), to be implemented by small \nlocal contractors using labor-intensive methods, and include patching, improving \nside drains, repairing culverts, improving shoulders, constructing lined drains, \nand bioengineering;1\n                                                 \n1  Bioengineering is the use of vegetation, terracing, and construction of efficient drainage systems to stabilize road \nembankments and slopes. The purpose of the vegetation is to minimize water penetration into the ground layers \nand to reduce the risk of erosion of the surface soils to ensure long-term sustainability of the roads. Bioengineering \nincludes tree planting with deep-rooted species to reduce the risk of shallow slides and debris flow. \n ", "48  Appendix 11 \n(iii)  international  and  domestic  consulting  services  for  project  management, \nconstruction  supervision,  establishment  of  road  maintenance  policies,  road \nmaintenance training and supervision, and socioeconomic impact monitoring; \nand  \n(iv)  community empowerment initiatives, including (a) identification of community-\nbased and gender-inclusive modalities for rehabilitation and maintenance of rural \nfeeder roads adjacent to the project roads; (b) HIV/AIDS prevention and road \nsafety awareness programs along the project roads to be implemented by an \ninternational  NGO  with  expertise  in  community-based  and  labor-intensive \ninfrastructure development and service delivery in one selected subdistrict along \nthe project roads; and (c) monitoring of employment targets for women.  \nC.  Description of the Environment \n  1.  Physical Resources \n5.  Timor-Leste comprised the eastern end of the island of Timor, plus the enclave territory \nof Oecusi and the islands of Atauro and Jaco; this amounts to a land area of about 14,609 \nsquare kilometers. Timor is the easternmost of the Lesser Sunda islands, lying from 8\u201310 \ndegrees south of the equator and about 500 km north of Australia.2 The country has a dramatic \nand mountainous topography, dominated by the Ramelau Mountains stretching across the \nmiddle of the island from the eastern to the western tip.  \n6.  The island is unique among the major islands of the Sunda archipelago in that it is not of \nvolcanic  origin,  but  is  a  continental  fragment,  composed  largely  of  limestone  and  other \nsedimentary deposits. The island is geologically young, with steep and unstable slopes and \ndeep valleys, prone to flash floods. More than 40% of the land area is estimated to have a slope \nof greater than 40%3. The steep topography and torrential rains result in thin and unstable soils, \nwith low water-holding capacity (footnote 2). Occasionally deeper soils may be found on the \ncoastal and inland plains.  \n7.  The climate is hot and humid tropical, with large variations in rainfall and temperature \nover short distances due to the steep topography. Broadly speaking two annual seasons are \ndetermined  by  the  monsoon,  which  varies  in  length  according  to  location.  Timor-Leste  is \nsignificantly drier than the other islands in the archipelago. The Ramelau Mountain ridge forms \nthe main watershed in the country and is the source of all major streams. Even with more than \n100 rivers, surface water is scarce, as most rivers are not perennial. The country has only one \nlake of significant size (Iralalaru lake in the east). Most water for domestic and agricultural use is \nobtained from streams and springs, with the exception of the eastern part of the country, where \nwells are fairly common.  \n8.  Baseline  data  for  air  or  water  quality  is  lacking.  Given  that  the  country  is  very \nunderdeveloped with almost no industrial infrastructure and very little vehicular traffic, air quality \ncan be expected to be good overall. Despite the generally sparse traffic, vehicular emissions in \nurban areas may sometimes produce significant levels of pollution. The other major source of \nair pollution is smoke from the burning of wood as a cooking fuel.  \n9.  The country has few water-polluting industries; the processing of coffee beans is the \nmajor  industrial  pollution  source.  Domestic  sewage  and  waste,  domesticated  animals,  and \nsedimentation due to soil erosion are the main causes of water pollution overall.

Provided the environmental management plan (EMP) is followed, the Project is expected \nto have minor and short-term adverse impacts on the physical environment during construction. \nSome soil erosion and sedimentation of surface waters will be unavoidable as the result of \nearth-moving activities. Dry river beds will be used for the extraction of sand and gravel, and \nsome upland sites may be required for the quarrying of building materials. The EMP prescribes \nmeasures to avoid or mitigate each of these impacts. \n11.  The bioengineering measures of the Project (such as terracing, construction of efficient \ndrains, and planting of native species) will provide long-term beneficial effects by reducing soil \nerosion and sedimentation of surface waters. The frequency and intensity of landslides near the \nproject roads will be significantly reduced. \n2.  Ecological Resources \n12.  Since  Timor-Leste  is  an  island,  fisheries  and  other  marine  resources  constitute  an \nimportant segment of the natural environment. Overall, the marine and coastal environments \nappear to be more intact here than on most other islands in the region. Overexploitation of the \nresource in general, and overfishing by commercial interests in particular, are not identified as \nproblems at this point. Since the Project is not anticipated to impact the marine resources, these \nresources are not discussed in detail here. \n13.  Timor-Leste is situated east of the Wallace line and, therefore, has biological elements \nof both Asian and Australian origin. This creates the potential for unique species. However, no \nup-to-date information is available on the number or location of remaining native species, with a \nfew exceptions regarding bird species. Nearly 200 species of mammals have been identified on \nthe island, but their status today is poorly known. Much of the wildlife commonly seen today is \nferal domestics, such as cattle, buffalo, donkeys, and pigs. Native wildlife can only be seen in \nthe more isolated forest areas (for example, deer, monkeys, civets, cuscus, and a variety of \nbat). Reptiles are very poorly described. Cobras, pythons, and crocodiles are said to inhabit the \nisland, but nothing is known of their number or distribution (footnote 3). Both hunting and trading \nin protected species are prohibited under United Nations regulations, but both practices were \nobserved during the project surveys. The Project will not affect any protected natural areas or \necologically isolated habitats, and no impacts are anticipated on native wildlife.  \n14.  Numerous primary and secondary documentary sources describe massive deforestation \nin  recent  years,  and  this  was  confirmed  by  the  environmental  field  surveys.  Estimates  of \nclearing range as high as 90% of the original forest cover. Today the dominant vegetation \nacross the island and within the project area is savannah/grassland, interspersed with shrubs \nand  occasional  stands  of  trees.  Most  lands  show  evidence  of  clearing  and  significant \ndisturbance by human activities, especially slash-and-burn cultivation, and coffee growing and \ngrazing, even on steep slopes. In the one project area where sizable stands of forest were \nobserved (Road A08 Lospalos), the forest was definitely secondary rather than primary.  \n15.  By far the most common ecosystems on the island are the grasslands and what Carter \nterms \u201cregrowth communities.\u201d Regrowth communities occur throughout landscapes that have \nbeen disturbed by slash-and-burn agriculture and by other rural land-clearing activities. \u201cWhere \nleft unattended, regrowth communities range from simple herbaceous communities to areas \nwith scattered bamboo, casuarinas, and eucalypts, and structurally more complex communities \nthat include dense formations of shrubs, small trees, and creepers\u201d (footnote 3). Field surveys \n ", "50  Appendix 11 \nshow  that  most  of  the  project  area  is  covered  in  either  grassland  or  these  regrowth \ncommunities, the exception being the secondary forests around Lospalos. \n16.  Due to the highly disturbed condition of the environment in most of the project area, no \nsignificant danger of adverse impacts to threatened or endangered species of plants or animals \nis  likely.  Project  road  A08  passes  through  a  stretch  of  secondary  forest  in  the  vicinity  of \nLospalos; however, no general tree cutting will occur, and the EMP will limit all project activities \nin this area to the existing right-of-way. These measures will provide adequate protection for the \nforest environment.  \n17.  The  island  has  15  protected  natural  areas  (PNAs).  The  PNAs  have  not  yet  been \nsystematically  surveyed  due  to  the  Government\u2019s  lack  of  personnel  and  funds.  Formal \nboundaries have not been established. A table listing the PNAs and a map showing their \napproximate locations is included in the IEE. The project roads will not affect any PNAs.  \n3.  Economic Development \n18.  The population of Timor-Leste ranges from 750,000 to 1,000,000 and is young, with a \nmedian age of 20 years. Life expectancy at birth is 57 years, well below the average for east \nAsian and Pacific island countries. The population is predominately rural (75%). Timor-Leste \nhas one of the least-developed economies in the region. The UNDP Human Development \nIndex4 places Timor-Leste in the low human development category, ranking 158 among 177 \ncountries.  \n19.  In late 1999, about 70% of the economic infrastructure of Timor-Leste was laid to waste \nby Indonesian troops and anti-independence militias; 260,000 people fled westward. Over the \nnext 3 years, a massive international program, staffed by 5,000 peacekeepers (8,000 at peak) \nand 1,300 police officers, led to substantial reconstruction in both urban and rural areas. By mid-\n2002, all but about 50,000 of the refugees had returned. Growth, however, was held back in \n2003 by extensive drought and the gradual winding down of the international presence. \n20.  As yet, no infrastructure supports tourism and virtually no industry exists. The agriculture \nsector is weak due to recently deficient monsoons, an inequitable land tenure system, and lack \nof education and training for farmers. Since roads provide the dominant form of transportation, \nthe  lack  of  a  serviceable  road  infrastructure  contributes  significantly  to  the  prevalence  of \npoverty.  \n21.  The  Project\u2019s  poverty  impact  and  social  analyses  provide  a  detailed  description  of \nhuman and economic development, based on extensive field work.  \n4.  Social and Cultural Resources \n22.  Timor-Leste is one of the poorest countries in the world. Project fieldwork indicates that \nas much as 88% of the population are poor, 46% are very poor. The improved roads that will \nresult from the Project will benefit about 62,000 people. Of these, 55,000 are poor, and 28,000 \nare  very  poor.  More  detailed  information  on  socioeconomic  values,  public  health,  cultural \nvalues,  and  quality  of  life  values  are  provided  in  the  Project\u2019s  poverty  impact  and  social \nanalyses. No indigenous peoples live in the country.  \n23.  As yet, no official listing is available for historical and archaeological sites, although the \nGovernment has plans to undertake a survey when possible. Within the project area no sites of \nclearly archaeological or historical significance were noted. \n                                                 \n4  UNDP. 2004. Human Development Report. United States. ", "  Appendix 11  51 \n24.  Numerous settlements, from hamlets to large villages, plus scattered habitations are \nlocated along the project roads. In the villages a small number of houses are located very close \nto the project roads, but still outside the right-of-way. Encroachments onto the right-of-way were \nnot encountered. Generally, kitchen gardens are placed between houses and the roads.  \n25.  No adverse impacts will occur to dwellings due to loss of land or relocation, because all \nroads  will  be  rehabilitated  within  the  existing  right-of-way.  Short-term  adverse  impacts  are \nassociated with project construction: increased noise, vibration and dust, plus the inconvenience \nof traffic delays. These impacts will be mitigated as prescribed in the EMP. \nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n26.  Overall, the Project\u2019s beneficial impacts to people and the environment will substantially \noutweigh the adverse impacts, provided that best engineering practices are followed and the \nEMP is effectively implemented. Impacts on environmental, cultural, and human resources are \nidentified in the respective sections of this SIEE. Those impacts are summarized here.  \n27.  Erosion of soil and sedimentation of waterways are two of the most pervasive impacts \nfrom road rehabilitation projects. Sediment deposition and suspension in water courses have \ndirect, negative impacts on water quality and aquatic ecosystems. Soil loss and redeposit can \nalso adversely affect residential and agricultural properties. A related set of impacts are loss of \nnative vegetation and the opening of habitats to the invasion of weeds. These impacts can be \nsubstantially mitigated or avoided altogether by implementing engineering best practices and \nbioengineering. Restricting earth-moving and clearing activities to the dry season will likewise \ngreatly reduce the potential adverse impacts of road rehabilitation. \n28.  The potential reduction in water quality is a concern. Prevention of erosion and proper \nhandling of sediment will largely prevent any reduction in water quality due to added sediment \nload. Proper storage, handling, and disposal of potential contaminants (such as fuels, lubricants, \nand solvents) will generally provide adequate protection of water quality from these potential \nsources of contamination. The waste and runoff from encampments must also be handled in \naccordance with the EMP to prevent adverse impacts on water quality. \n29.  Quarrying  and  extraction  of  construction  materials  must  be  strictly  regulated  in \naccordance  with  Government  guidelines  and  the  EMP,  to  avoid  such  adverse  impacts  as \nreduced  water  quality,  destruction  of  aesthetic  values,  and  creation  of  a  long-term  safety \nhazard.  \n30.  The siting of encampments will be a critical issue. Encampments must be situated so \nthat they do not seriously degrade the natural or social environment. Waste and effluent from \nencampments must be contained and disposed of safely, away from water courses, wells, and \ndwellings. \n31.  Disruption and delay of traffic plus the generation of noise, vibration, and dust are \nimpacts that will be particularly noticeable to the local population. Asphalt mixing plants may \nproduce a significant amount of air pollution. These impacts cannot be entirely avoided, as they \nare part of the nature of a construction project. However, they are temporary and can be greatly \nmitigated  through  proper  planning  and  scheduling,  proper  maintenance  of  equipment,  and \nfollowing the EMP.  \n32.  The majority of potentially adverse impacts are temporary and will cease with the end of \nproject construction. Provided that proper maintenance is given to the roads throughout their \noperational life, no significant adverse impacts will result from the existence and operation of the \nroads themselves. Maintenance activities will produce minor impacts, but these are manageable \n ", "52  Appendix 11 \nthrough a continuation of the engineering practices and mitigation measures specified by the \nEMP.  \n33.  The anticipated beneficial effects of the Project will be long term and will continue \nthroughout the life of the project roads. The installation of proper drainage structures, coupled \nwith the planned bioengineering features (such as planting of native species and erosion control \nmeasures), will greatly reduce the risk of landslides on the roads, thus improving traffic safety. \nThese features will also help protect habitations and agricultural lands from excessive runoff \nand sedimentation. Water quality will be protected and will be improved relative to the current \ncondition. Driving times and costs will be reduced, while access to markets and essential \nservices will be greatly improved. \nE.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring \n1.  Institutional Requirements \n34.  As the project proponent, the Ministry of Public Works has ultimate responsibility for \nobtaining  all  the  required  approvals  from  the  Government  (Ministry  of  Development  and \nEnvironment),  for  ensuring  compliance  with  the  EMP,  and  for  complying  with  local  public \ndisclosure  requirements.  The  Project  Management  Unit  (PMU)  will  manage  these \nresponsibilities.  \n35.  Current and anticipated near-term staffing levels of the PMU will not permit the PMU to \nassign a senior manager to oversee the environmental requirements of the Project. Therefore, \nthe services of a qualified international environmental inspector must be obtained. He or she will \nbe a member of the construction supervision consultant\u2019s team. Construction contractors should \nalso be required to retain environmental specialists to oversee compliance with their respective \nparts of the EMP and to serve as direct liaisons with the international environmental inspector. \nThe requirements to obtain the needed personnel and to comply with the EMP will be made part \nof the bidding documents. \n2.  Environmental Monitoring Plan \n36.  The  provisions  of  the  EMP  are  designed  to  avoid  adverse  environmental  impacts \nwherever  possible  and  to  mitigate  adverse  effects  to  an  acceptable  level  where  complete \navoidance is not feasible. Enforcement of the EMP will be the responsibility of the international \nenvironmental inspector, acting on behalf of the PMU. The international inspector will work with \nthe respective contractors\u2019 environmental specialists and will have direct access to the PMU \nmanager to resolve problems.  \n37.  The EMP requires routine monitoring of air and water quality, noise levels, and waste \nmanagement  throughout  the  construction  phase  of  the  Project.  Sampling  locations  and \nfrequencies are designed to ensure that no significant degradations of quality of life indicators \noccur, especially near population centers. Proper selection and prior approval will be required \nfor the location of staging areas, encampments, and building materials extraction sites. Earth-\nmoving activities will be restricted to the dry season to minimize siltation. The movement of \nconstruction-related vehicles will be routinely monitored to minimize disturbance to vegetation, \nand cleared areas will be reseeded promptly. \nF.  Public Information and Information Disclosure \n38.  The first public consultation was held at the ADB-World Bank Conference Room on \n7 March 2005. Over 50 participants from various government departments, international and \nnational NGO members, officers from international development agencies, and some district ", "  Appendix 11  53 \nadministrators  attended.  The  participants  were  actively  involved  in  discussions  related  to \npoverty reduction, the Project\u2019s goals, and environmental issues.  \n39.  In addition, the following government agencies were consulted:  \n(i)  Ministry  of  Development  and  Environment,  Directorate  of  Environmental \nServices, to obtain information on the institutional laws and guidelines applied in \nroad rehabilitation and improvement projects;  \n(ii)  Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Division of Forestry, to obtain \ninformation on environmental PNAs and other sensitive environmental resources; \nand \n(iii)  Ministry  of  Transport,  Communication  and  Public  Works;  Division  of  Road, \nBridges, and Flood Control, to discuss the capabilities of that agency to manage \nthe environmental requirements of the Project.  \n40.  About 50 local stakeholders were consulted and informed during field visits to project \nroads. They stated that road deterioration is mainly caused by poor drainage maintenance and \ntoo few culverts and bridges. These informants expressed a desire to be consulted in the \nplanning process for road rehabilitation.   \n41.  Stakeholder consultations are critical for obtaining understanding of and support for the \nProjects, and serve as an important source of information. Therefore, the project team will \ncontinue  to  consult  with  various  stakeholder  groups  throughout  the  course  of  project \nimplementation in addition to holding another large-scale consultation workshop. \n42.  Information contained in the IEE, SIEE, and related studies will be disseminated to the \npublic and made available for public comment and participation as prescribed by the applicable \nguidelines  of  the  Government,  Ministry  of  Development  and  Environment.  At  a  minimum, \ngovernment  regulations  require  that  public  notices  of  the  proposed  actions  be  widely \ndisseminated and that members of the affected public be given at least 30 days to comment on \nthe proposals. \nG.  Findings, Recommendations, and Conclusion \n43.  The three project roads were surveyed by a team of environmental specialists. There is \nno undisturbed habitat in the project impact area. Road A08 between Iliomar and Lospalos \npasses through secondary forest. Within the forest, no general tree cutting will occur; selected \ntrees will be removed only where absolutely necessary to maintain safety standards for the \nroad. Provided the requirements of the EMP are met, to mitigate potentially adverse impacts \nduring project construction, no significant or long-term impacts will be made on the forested \narea, and no additional or special studies are needed. A replanting program will replace cut \ntrees. The Project will not affect any PNAs or registered cultural/historical sites.  \n44.  Overall,  the  project  area  has  been  subjected  to  long-term,  intense  agricultural  and \ngrazing activities. The lands in the vicinity of the project roads have been heavily disturbed. \nSlash-and-burn agricultural techniques and the grazing of domesticated animals are common \nthroughout the project area. Many areas are nearly devoid of vegetation cover from overgrazing. \nThis environment is dominated by introduced or weedy species of plants and by domesticated \nspecies of animals, and is generally not able to support native fauna species. No known species \nof endangered plants or animals are found in the project area. \n45.  Residential areas are found along all three project roads. No habitations are within the \nexisting right-of-way, and no involuntary relocation of residents is required. Short-term adverse \nimpacts on habitations during project construction are primarily noise, vibration, and increased \ndust.  Careful  adherence  to  the  specifications  of  the  EMP  will  adequately  mitigate  these \n ", "54  Appendix 11 \nconstruction-related impacts. The Project will have no long-term adverse impacts on the local \nsociety  and  no  negative  implications  for  vulnerable  groups.  No  minority  ethnic  groups  or \nindigenous population groups live in the project area.   \n46.  The construction of improved drainage structures, stabilization of slopes, replanting of \nthe right-of-way with a proper mix of native species, and other similar measures undertaken by \nthe  Project  will  have  long-term  beneficial  effects  on  the  environment.  The  frequency  and \nseverity of landslides will be reduced along the project roads. The replanting of trees and native \nvegetation will stabilize the landscape, may help improve water quality, and will enhance scenic \nbeauty. The greatly improved ability of the population to move from place to place and to access \nmuch-needed social services will be a substantial and long-term enhancement. The overall, \nlong-term effect of the Project on society will be to generate employment and improve access to \nmarkets  and  social  services.  The  potential  for  economic  growth  and  income-generating \nopportunities, expected impact on poverty reduction, and enhanced overall connectivity of the \ncore road network will promote sustainable economic and social growth.  \n47.  The findings of the IEE confirm that this Project be designated as ADB environmental \ncategory  B.  Therefore,  no  additional  environmental  investigations  are  required.  The  report \nrecommends that (i) the Project proceed as proposed in the accompanying reports and that the \nrequirements of the EMP be incorporated into all subsequent project activities and contract \nbidding documents, and (ii) the construction supervision contractor be required to retain the \nservices of a qualified international environmental inspector. The environmental inspector must \nreport directly to the construction supervision contractor and will serve as the single point of \ncontact between the Ministry of Development and Environment, the construction supervision \ncontractor, and the individual construction contractors.
