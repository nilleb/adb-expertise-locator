An initial environmental examination was undertaken; the \nsummary is provided in Appendix 11.  \n\nProject Description \n\nThe  Project  will  produce  the  following  outputs:  (i)  rehabilitation  and \nimprovement  of  about  123  kilometers  (km)  of  core  network  roads;  (ii) \nlabor-intensive  routine  road  maintenance  on  45  km;  (iii)  sound  and \nsustainable  road  maintenance  policies;  (iv)  an  efficient  bidding  and \ncontracting  system  for  engaging  communities  in  road  maintenance \nthrough  local  small  contractors;  (v)  improved  project  management, \nsupervision,  and  monitoring;  and  (vi)  identification  of  modalities  to \nensure sustained rehabilitation and maintenance of rural feeder roads. \n\nTimor-Leste  is  one  of  the  least-developed  countries  in  the  world.  Per \ncapita  gross  domestic  product  was  estimated  at  $405  in  2004. \nOfficially,  more  than  40%  of  the  population  is  reported  to  live  under \n$0.55  per  day,  the  national  poverty  line.  However,  according  to  the \nestimates  of  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  technical  assistance  for \nTransport Sector Improvement, poverty prevalence is likely as high as \n88%, and approximately 46% of the population live in absolute poverty. \nDuring  the  1999  conflict,  most  communication  and  power  facilities \nwere destroyed. In spite of some restoration efforts, postal services are \nstill  closed  except  in  Baucau  and  Dili.  The  electrification  ratio  for  all \nhouseholds  is  only  20%;  95%  of  rural  households  are  without \nelectricity. About 48% of the population does not have access to safe \nwater  supply,  and  69%  does  not  have  access  to  adequate  sanitation \nfacilities. Access to health facilities remains problematic. The time and \nmoney  costs  to  reach  a  community  health  center  or  a  hospital  are \nsubstantial.  Life  expectancy  is  low\u2014less  than  60  years.  Currently, \nabout a third of children are not enrolled in primary school; 20% of the \nenrolled  do  not  attend  classes.  More  than  half  the  population  is \nilliterate. Markets are either nonexistent or access is prevented due to \nmountainous topography, poor transport system, and lack of transport \nservices. \n\nAs  a  new  nation,  Timor-Leste  faces  many  challenges.  The  most \npressing  issues  include  (i)  sustained  economic  growth,  (ii)  poverty \nreduction,  (iii)  employment,  (iv)  a  legal  and  institutional  framework  to \nmanage  and  administer  the  new  nation  state  and  transform  the \nagrarian subsistence production to a market-oriented economy, and (v) \nweak human and institutional capacity. \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nIn  the  short  term,  economic  growth  and  employment  have  to  come \nfrom  infrastructure  investments.  The  Government  recognizes  that \ninfrastructure  is  of  overarching  importance  to  all  sectors  of  the \neconomy and society; and that improving infrastructure, particularly the \ntransport  system,  is  critical  in  fostering  private  sector  development, \nimproving  agricultural  productivity, \nreducing  poverty,  promoting \ninvestment  and  human  development,  and  strengthening  government \ncapacity  to  deliver  services.  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program \nupdate  for  2005  identifies  infrastructure  development  and  institutional \ncapacity  building  as  the  major  areas  for  ADB  assistance.  ADB  has \nrecently  approved  a  technical  assistance  to  address  cross-sectoral \ninfrastructure issues and technical capacity building in the road sector. \nThe Project, therefore, will focus on physical road infrastructure and its \nimplementation.  As  a  post-conflict  country,  Timor-Leste  is  eligible  for \ngrant financing from the Asian Development Fund. \n\nImpact and Outcome  The Project is expected to contribute to economic growth and poverty \nreduction.  It  will  (i)  improve  accessibility  for  project  area  residents  to \nfood, and economic and social services; (ii) promote private sector-led \nindustrial  and  agricultural  development;  (iii)  foster  market  formation \nand  facilitate  domestic  and  international  trade;  and  (iv)  generate \nincome and employment opportunities. The outcome will be improved \nroad infrastructure for economic and social development. \n\nCost Estimates \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nGrant Amount and \nTerms \n\nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $12.50  million,  with  $5.08  million  in \nforeign exchange and $7.42 million equivalent in local currency. \n\n \nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \nTotal \n\n($\u2019000) \n\nForeign \nExchange \n5.08 \n      \u2014 \n5.08 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n4.92 \n2.50 \n7.42 \n\n \nTotal \n10.00 \n2.50 \n12.50 \n\n \nPercent \n80 \n20 \n100 \n\n \nADB  will  provide  a  grant  of  $10  million  from  the  Asian  Development \nFund.  The  grant  will  finance  all  foreign  exchange  costs,  including \nconsulting  services  and  60%  of  the  local  cost  of  civil  works.  The \nGovernment will provide $2.5 million, financing the remaining local cost \nof civil works, including taxes and duties. \n\nPeriod of Utilization \n\nUntil 30 June 2008 \n\nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n\n \n31 December 2007 \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nExecuting Agency \n\nMinistry of Public Works \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  2  years.  The  prerehabilitation \nactivities\u2500detailed  design,  preparation  of  bidding  documents, \ntendering,  and  awarding  of  contracts\u2500will  start  in  January  2006. \nCommencement  of  civil  works  will  target  November  2006,  with \ncompletion in December 2007. \n\n\fProcurement \n\nConsulting Services \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\niii \n\nincluding  both  ADB  and \nAll  procurement  under \nGovernment-financed  packages,  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement. The civil works will be divided into seven packages, all to \nbe procured using local competitive bidding procedures. \n\nthe  Project, \n\nInternational  and  domestic  consulting  services  will  be  required  for  (i) \nengineering  design  and  preparation  of  bidding  documents;  (ii) \nconstruction  supervision;  (iii)  road  maintenance,  including  formulation \nof  policies,  training,  and  supervision;  (iv)  project  management;  (v) \nsocioeconomic  monitoring  and  evaluation;  (vi)  financial  auditing;  and \n(vii) community empowerment initiatives. The Project will fund a total of \n132  person-months  of \ninternational  and  310  person-months  of \ndomestic consulting services.  \n\nroad  maintenance  policies, \n\nConsulting  services  for  engineering  design,  construction  supervision, \nproject  management, \ntraining  and \nsupervision  for  maintenance,  and  socioeconomic  monitoring  will  be \nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants.  Due \nto \nto  Government  agencies' \nimplement  grassroots \ninternational  nongovernment \norganization  will  be  recruited,  using  the  direct  selection  method,  to \nimplement the community empowerment component. \n\nlimited  capacity \n\ninitiatives,  an \n\nThe  Project  will  reduce  poverty  by  providing  villagers  in  the  project \narea with labor opportunities. During project implementation, about 500 \nlabor  years  of  employment  will  be  created.  At  its  completion,  the \nProject  will  contribute  to  better  livelihood  for  villagers  by  providing \nmobility to isolated societies; easing access to market centers for food, \neducation, and health services; promoting trading and hence cash crop \ncultivation; and reducing transport costs for the private sector. \n\nThe  project  design  considers  potential  risks  associated  with  project \nmanagement  and  rehabilitation  quality.  The  Project  will  maintain  and \nexpand  the  Project  Management  Unit,  established  for  the  two \nemergency  infrastructure  rehabilitation  projects,  to  strengthen  its \ncapacity  to  handle  increased  responsibilities.  A  team  of  international \nand  domestic  consultants  will  provide  construction  supervision.  A \ncommunity  empowerment  component  addressing  road  safety,  human \nsyndrome \nimmunodeficiency \n(HIV/AIDS),  and  other  social  risks  will  be  implemented  by  an \ninternational  nongovernment  organization.  Environmental  impact  will \nbe  monitored  through  construction  supervision  and  mitigated  at  the \nrehabilitation stage in accordance with the environmental management \nplan. \n\nimmunodeficiency \n\nvirus/acquired \n\n \n\n \n\n\fo\n124  30'E\n\no\n126  30'E\n\no\n\n8  30\u2019S\n\no\n\n9  30\u2019S\n\nPort Hera\n\nAileu\n\nFatalulic\n\nCape Suai\n\no\n\n8  30\u2019S\n\no\n\n0\n\no\n10  00'S\n\no\n\n9  30\u2019S\n\no\n10  00'N\n\no\n130  00'E\n\no\n10  00'N\n\nBeacu\n\no\n126  30'E\n\no\n110  00'E\n\no\n\n0\n\no\n10  00'S\n\n0\n5\n-\n4\n6\n7\n0\nH\nR\n\n \n\no\n124  30'E\n\no\n110  00'E\n\no\n130  00'E\n\nT\nI\nM\nO\nR\n-\nL\nE\nS\nT\nE\nS\n \na\n \nv\n \nu\n \n \n \n \n \nS\n \ne\n \na\nS\n \nt\n \nr\n \na\n \ni\n \nt\n \n \n \n \n \no\n \nf\n \n \n \n \n \nW\n \ne\n \nt\n \na\n \nr\nT\n \ni\n \nm\n \no\n \nr\n \n \n \n \n \nS\n \ne\n \na\nI\n \nN\n \nD\n \nI\n \nA\n \nN\n \n \n \n \n \nO\n \nC\n \nE\n \nA\n \nN\nP\nA\nC\nI\nF\nI\nC\n \n \nO\nC\nE\nA\nN\nS\no\nu\nt\nh\n \nC\nh\ni\nn\na\n \nS\ne\na\nJ\n \na\n \nv\n \na\n \n \n \n \n \nS\n \ne\n \na\nO\ns\ns\nu\nV\ni\nq\nu\ne\nq\nu\ne\nM\na\nn\na\nt\nu\nt\no\nL\na\nk\nl\no\nL\na\nc\nl\nu\nb\na\nr\nL\na\nl\ne\ni\na\nV\ne\nn\ni\nl\na\nl\ne\nV\ne\nm\na\ns\ns\ne\nB\na\nu\nc\na\nu\nL\na\ng\na\nQ\nu\ne\nl\ni\nc\na\ni\nL\na\nu\nt\ne\nn\nL\nu\nr\no\nL\no\nr\ne\nL\no\ns\np\na\nl\no\ns\nT\nu\nt\nu\na\nl\na\nC\na\np\ne\n \nC\nu\nt\nc\nh\na\nJ\no\nc\no\nI\ns\nl\na\nn\nd\nL\na\ni\nv\na\ni\nI\nr\na\nl\na\nl\na\nr\no\nB\na\nq\nu\ni\na\nU\na\nt\nu\nc\na\nr\nb\na\nu\nI\nl\ni\no\nm\na\nr\nB\na\nr\ni\nq\nu\ne\nS\na\nm\ne\nD\nI\nL\nI\nA\ni\nn\na\nr\no\nA\nt\ns\na\nb\ne\nZ\nu\nm\na\nl\na\ni\nO\ne\nl\ne\nu\nS\nu\na\ni\nM\na\nl\ni\na\nn\na\nP\na\nn\ne\n \nM\na\nc\na\ns\ns\na\nr\nB\no\nb\no\nn\na\nr\no\nF\no\nh\no\nr\ne\nm\nH\na\nt\no\n-\nU\nd\no\nB\ne\nt\na\nn\no\nB\na\nl\ni\nb\no\nN\ni\nt\ni\nb\ne\nA\nt\na\nb\na\ne\nL\na\nc\nl\nu\nt\na\nM\na\nu\nb\na\nr\na\nL\ni\nq\nu\ni\ns\na\nE\nr\nm\ne\nr\na\nT\nu\nr\ni\ns\nc\na\ni\nA\nl\na\ns\nM\ne\nt\ni\nn\na\nr\no\nA\nt\na\nu\nr\no\n \nI\ns\nl\na\nn\nd\nM\na\nu\nm\ne\nt\na\n-\nA\nt\na\nu\nr\no\nR\na\ni\nl\na\nk\no\nF\na\nt\nu\nb\ne\ns\ns\ni\nM\na\nu\nb\ni\ns\ns\ne\nA\ni\nt\nu\nt\no\nN\na\nt\na\nr\n-\nB\no\nr\na\nO\ne\n-\nS\ni\nl\no\nP\na\ns\ns\na\nb\ne\nB\nO\nB\nO\nN\nA\nR\nO\nE\nR\nM\nE\nR\nA\nA\nI\nL\nE\nU\nD\nI\nL\nI\nL\nI\nQ\nU\nI\nC\nA\nM\nA\nN\nU\nF\nA\nH\nI\nA\nI\nN\nA\nR\nO\nC\nO\nV\nA\n-\nL\nI\nM\nA\nV\nI\nQ\nU\nE\nQ\nU\nE\nM\nA\nN\nA\nT\nU\nT\nO\nB\nA\nU\nC\nA\nU\nL\nA\nU\nT\nE\nM\nO\nE\nC\nU\nS\nS\nI\nB\nU\nR\nU\nF\nL\nO\nR\nE\nS\nS\nU\nM\nB\nA\nT\nI\nM\nO\nR\nC\nE\nR\nA\nM\nK\nE\nP\nU\nL\nA\nU\nA\nN\n \nA\nR\nU\nH\nA\nL\nM\nA\nH\nE\nR\nA\nB\nA\nL\nI\nS\nU\nM\nB\nA\nW\nA\nB\nA\nN\nG\nK\nA\nB\nE\nL\nI\nT\nU\nN\nG\nK\nA\nL\nI\nM\nA\nN\nT\nA\nN\nS\nU\nM\nA\nT\nR\nA\nJ\n \nA\n \nV\n \nA\nS\nU\nL\nA\nW\nE\nS\nI\nN\na\nt\ni\no\nn\na\nl\n \nC\na\np\ni\nt\na\nl\nD\ni\ns\nt\nr\ni\nc\nt\n \nC\na\np\ni\nt\na\nl\nT\no\nw\nn\nP\no\nr\nt\nP\nr\no\nj\ne\nc\nt\n \nR\no\na\nd\n \n(\nR\ne\nh\na\nb\ni\nl\ni\nt\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n)\nP\nr\no\nj\ne\nc\nt\n \nR\no\na\nd\n \n(\nM\na\ni\nn\nt\ne\nn\na\nn\nc\ne\n)\nN\na\nt\ni\no\nn\na\nl\n \nR\no\na\nd\nD\ni\ns\nt\nr\ni\nc\nt\n \nR\no\na\nd\nD\ni\ns\nt\nr\ni\nc\nt\n \nR\no\na\nd\n \n(\np\nl\na\nn\nn\ne\nd\n)\nR\ni\nv\ne\nr\nD\ni\ns\nt\nr\ni\nc\nt\n \nB\no\nu\nn\nd\na\nr\ny\nI\nn\nt\ne\nr\nn\na\nt\ni\no\nn\na\nl\n \nB\no\nu\nn\nd\na\nr\ny\nB\no\nu\nn\nd\na\nr\ni\ne\ns\n \na\nr\ne\n \nn\no\nt\n \nn\ne\nc\ne\ns\ns\na\nr\ni\nl\ny\n \na\nu\nt\nh\no\nr\ni\nt\na\nt\ni\nv\ne\n.\nT\nI\nM\nO\nR\n-\nL\nE\nS\nT\nE\nR\nO\nA\nD\n \nS\nE\nC\nT\nO\nR\n \nI\nM\nP\nR\nO\nV\nE\nM\nE\nN\nT\n \nP\nR\nO\nJ\nE\nC\nT\nK\ni\nl\no\nm\ne\nt\ne\nr\ns\n0\n2\n5\n5\n1\n0\n1\n5\n2\n0\nN\nN\no\nt\ne\n \n:\n \nN\no\nt\ne\nd\n \nb\ny\n \n:\n \nF\ni\nr\ns\nt\n \nP\nr\no\no\nf\n,\n \n3\n1\n \nA\nu\ng\nu\ns\nt\n \n2\n0\n0\n5\nS\ne\nc\no\nn\nd\n \nP\nr\no\no\nf\n,\n \n1\n \nS\ne\np\nt\ne\nm\nb\ne\nr\n \n2\n0\n0\n5\nR\nI\nC\nA\nR\nD\nO\n \nC\nH\nA\nN\n,\n \nO\nS\nE\nC\n1\n8\n \nA\nu\ng\nu\ns\nt\n \n2\n0\n0\n5\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \n\n1. \nto the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste for the Road Sector Improvement Project. \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nTimor-Leste is a small and mountainous island country, with a population of 925,000 and \na  land  area  of  14,609  square  kilometers.  It  is  located  at  the  eastern  end  of  the  Sunda \narchipelago  and  has  a  dramatic  topography  dominated  by  the  Ramelau  Mountains  stretching \nacross  the  middle  of  the  island  from  the  east  to  the  west.  The  coastal  zones  in  the  north  and \nsouth are narrow, and are largely on steep hillsides. \n\n3. \nRoads provide the dominant mode of transport, carrying about 70% of freight and 90% \nof  passenger  traffic.  The  total  length  of  the  extensive  road  network  is  estimated  at  6,040 \nkilometers (km), comprising 1,430 km of national roads linking district centers, 870 km of district \nroads  providing  links  to  large  administrative  centers,  and  720  km  in  Dili  and  several  smaller \nregional towns. The remaining 3,020 km are rural access or feeder roads. \n\nThe extensive and dense road network was constructed with relatively low standards of \n4. \ndesign and materials. A pragmatic approach adapting to the often severe terrain conditions was \nused,  resulting  in  a  very  low  horizontal  and  vertical  geometrical  standard  in  mountainous \nregions.  The  road  widths  appear  to  have  been  compromised  according  to  the  actual  terrain \nconditions,  resulting  in  many  very  narrow  roads.  While  100%  of  national  roads  and  71%  of \ndistrict  roads  were  bitumen  paved,  shoulders  are  often  constructed  out  of  impervious  earthen \nmaterial.  This,  combined  with  the  difficult  geological  conditions,  torrential  rains,  and  lack  of \nmaintenance,  has  caused  rapid  deterioration  of  the  road  system.  Only  24%  of  national  roads \nand 11% of district roads are currently in good condition. \n\n5. \nTraffic volume is small and concentrated around Dili. Traffic counts in 2000 showed that \none third of the road network outside the urban center carried more than 200 vehicles per day \n(with  15%  carrying  more  than  500  vehicles  per  day,  less  than  2%  carrying  more  than  1,000 \nvehicles per day). One third of the network carried less than 50 vehicles per day. Traffic counts \nin 2005 estimate the average daily traffic for motorized vehicles at about 160 on national roads, \n90  on  district  roads,  30  on  rural  roads,  and  170  on  urban  roads.  The  heaviest  traffic  flows  in \nexcess of 400 vehicles per day are on the northern coastal road. \n\n6. \nWalking  is  the  most  common  mode  of  transportation,  followed  by  small  trucks,  and \nmicrobuses.  Transport  services  are  mainly  provided  by  small-scale  private  companies  owning \none or two vehicles, and a small number of vehicle owner-operators. The Government has set \nminimum taxi fare rates, but has not set rates for passenger and freight buses and trucks.  \n\n7. \nDrivers\u2019  associations  are  apparently  developing  and  setting  rates.  Passenger  fares \nrange from $0.50 to $3.00, depending on distance, averaging approximately $1.00 per one-way \ntrip. This is high and not affordable for many rural people, particularly the poor. These rates do \nnot  provide  a  decent  livelihood  for  vehicle  operators/owners:  almost  half  are  estimated  to  be \nliving  below  the  national  poverty  line.  Operating  costs  are  high;  repair  costs  average  about \n$1,500 per year. Nearly 50% of the total repair costs are caused by the poor road conditions. \n\nRehabilitating and maintaining the extensive road network will incur considerable cost to \n8. \nthe  Government.  Difficult  terrain,  geology,  and  weather  conditions  impose  additional  costs. \nGiven the current level of traffic demand and state of the economy, user charges are not likely \n\n\f2 \n\nto  be  able  to  generate  sufficient  revenue  to  finance  road  sector  development.  Prioritizing  and \nsequencing  to  maximize  the  benefits  of  investment  are  therefore  essential.  Past  efforts  have \nfocused  on  basic  maintenance,  rehabilitation,  and  emergency  works.  The  cost  of  this  reactive \napproach  was  high  and  needs  to  shift  to  a  preventive  approach  of  gradually  rehabilitating  the \nsystem  so  that  it  can  be  sustained  with  normal  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  and  a \nmanageable amount of emergency repairs. \n\n9. \nThe  Project  will  rehabilitate  and  maintain  four  crucial  roads  in  agricultural  areas  to \npromote economic and social development, and explore low-cost, community-based modalities \nfor road maintenance. The design and monitoring framework is attached as Appendix 1.  \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nAs a post-conflict country emerging from 3 years of United Nations (UN) administration, \n10. \nTimor-Leste faces many challenges and opportunities. The most pressing include (i) sustained \neconomic growth, (ii) poverty reduction, (iii) employment, (iv) a legal and institutional framework \nto  manage  and  administer  the  new  nation  state  and  transform  the  agrarian  subsistence \nproduction to a market-oriented economy, and (v) weak human and institutional capacity. \n\n1. \n\nProblems \n\nEconomic  Growth.  The  large  influx  of  UN  forces,  bilateral  and  multilateral  donors, \n11. \nforeign experts, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and financial aid boosted consumption \nand  investment,  and  generated  income  and  job  opportunities.  Real  gross  domestic  product \n(GDP) growth was estimated at 18% in 2000 and 15% in 2001. But with the winding down of the \ninternational  assistance,  economic  growth  fell  significantly  in  2002  to  an  estimated  3%,  and \nbecame negative in 2003 (minus 3%). Growth in 2004 was moderate at about 1%. \n\n12. \nPoverty.  Timor-Leste  is  one  of  the  least-developed  countries  in  the  world,  in  terms  of \nper  capita  GDP,  estimated  at  $405  in  2004.  Officially,  more  than  40%  of  the  population  is \nreported  to  live  below  the  national  poverty  line  of  $0.55  per  day.  However,  according  to \nestimates  of  ADB  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Transport  Sector  Improvement,1  poverty \nprevalence is likely to be as high as 88%, and approximately 46% live in absolute poverty. As \nthree  quarters  of  the  population  reside  in  rural  areas,  surviving  on  subsistence  and  seasonal \nagriculture,  poverty  is  predominantly  a  rural  phenomenon.  During  the  1999  conflict,  most \ncommunication and power facilities were destroyed. In spite of some restoration efforts, postal \nservices are still closed except in Baucau and Dili. The electrification ratio for all households is \nonly 20%; 95% of rural households are without electricity. About 48% of the population do not \nhave  access  to  safe  water  supplies,  and  69%  do  not  have  access  to  adequate  sanitation \nfacilities.  Access  to  health  facilities  remains  a  problem.  The  time  and  money  costs  to  reach  a \ncommunity  health  center  or  a  hospital  are  substantial  (70  minutes  by  walking  and  2  hours  by \nminibus, $1 on average for one-way bus fare). Life expectancy is low, less than 60 years. While \naccess  to  schooling  improved  considerably  prior  to  1999,  the  quality  of  teaching  and  learning \nwas  low.  Currently,  about  a  third  of  children  are  not  enrolled  in  primary  school;  20%  of  the \nenrolled do not attend classes. More than half of the population is illiterate. Markets are either \nnonexistent or access is prevented or severely hampered due to mountainous topography, poor \ntransport system, and lack of transport services.  \n\n13. \nEmployment. The total fertility rate is very high, estimated to be 8.3. Every year, about \n16,000 new workers enter the labor force. The rapid increase in population and labor force has \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2001.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Democratic  Republic  of  Timor-Leste  for  Transport  Sector  Improvement. \n\nManila. \n\n\f3 \n\nnot been accompanied by an increase in job opportunities. Agriculture is the principal economic \nactivity and the most important source of livelihood. But agricultural development is hampered \nby falling prices, deteriorating rural infrastructure, lack of rural services and access to markets, \nand  traditional  cultivation  practices.  Productivity  and  incomes  are  low.  Underemployment  is \nwidespread. Poverty prevalence is high. People are moving to the cities, particularly the capital \nDili, in search of job and income opportunities, which are scarce. The public sector offers little \nprospect  for  wage  employment,  due  to  the  limited  number  of  government  positions. \nDevelopment  of  the  small  private  business  sector  is  constrained  by  poor  and  expensive \ninfrastructure facilities, lack of legal and regulatory environment, devastated business services, \nand low labor productivity. Moreover, the withdrawal of expatriates is causing job losses. \n\n14. \nLegal and Institutional Framework. Timor-Leste emerged from the conflict with large-\nscale devastation. With the 1999 referendum, linkages to the Indonesian legal and institutional \nframework  were  severed.  With  international  assistance,  a  government  structure  has  taken \nshape.  Some  laws  and  regulations  have  been  promulgated.  However,  the  process  of \nintroducing necessary laws and regulations is slow. The Government\u2019s organizational structure \nis  still  evolving  and  subject  to  constant  changes.  These  create  risks  and  uncertainties  for  the \nprivate  sector  as  well  as  donor  agencies.  The  organizational  change  of  the  Ministry  of \nTransport,  Communications,  and  Public  Works,  initially  formed  in  2002,  is  a  good  illustration. \nThe Government recently split the ministry into the Ministry of Transport and Communications \nand Ministry of Public Works (MPW).  \n\n15.  Weak Human and Institutional Capacity. The human resource base is low as a result \nof  the  conflict  and  tragedies.  Administrative,  managerial,  entrepreneurial,  technical,  and \nvocational skills are in short supply in all sectors of the economy. Middle to senior managerial \npositions are difficult to fill with qualified people. The vast majority of current civil servants are \nneither  experienced  nor  trained  for  the  roles  they  are  undertaking.  The  Government  depends \nheavily on foreign experts for daily administrative operations, policy formulation, and preparation \nand implementation of development projects. The problem is also acute in the road sector. The \nDirectorate  of  Roads,  Bridges,  and  Flood  Control,  which  is  responsible  for  provision  and \nmanagement  of  road  infrastructure,  has  only  12  staff,  of  a  total  of  91,  with  technical \nqualifications. They have limited skills in the formulation of technical standards, road planning, \nprioritization,  project  preparation  and  implementation,  and  asset  management,  and  have  to \nfocus on managing emergency repair work. \n\n16. \nSocial,  Gender,  and  Health-Related  Issues.  Difficult  terrain,  geology,  and  weather \nconditions  contribute  to  the  isolation  of  local  communities  and  severely  limit  access  to  water \nsupplies,  energy,  food,  basic  social  services  (health  and  education),  and  local  markets.  The \npoor  conditions  of  rural  feeder  roads  especially  affect  rural  women,  who  are  responsible  for \ncarrying  clean  water,  collecting  fodder  and  fuelwood,  and  marketing  agriculture  products.  To \nensure  tangible  benefits  to  poor  and  isolated  communities,  the  rehabilitation  of  national  roads \nshould  be  accompanied  by  an  increasing  focus  on  the  rehabilitation  of  secondary  and  rural \nfeeder roads to ensure connectivity to markets, towns, and health and educational facilities. This \ncomplementary  approach  is  likely  to  increase  the  anticipated  poverty  reduction  impact  of  road \nimprovement. Strengthening the capacity of local communities to prioritize and sequence their \nneeds in terms of feeder road rehabilitation and maintenance contributes to the sustainability of \nroad  improvements.  The  traditional  gender  division  of  labor  can  be  challenged  by  proactively \nensuring  women\u2019s  involvement  in  road  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  in  a  culturally  sensitive \nmanner.  Areas  identified  by  local  constructors  and  surveyed  communities  for  potential \ninvolvement  of  women  include  support  services  to  construction  camps  and  bioengineering. \nWomen\u2019s effective access to these employment opportunities will require targeted programs of \nlabor  skills  transfer.  Timor-Leste  is  characterized  by  low\u2014mostly  underreported\u2014human \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nimmunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) prevalence. Although \ndata  on  HIV  prevalence  is  inadequate,  recent  surveys  jointly  carried  out  by  the  Ministry  of \nHealth  (MOH)  and  the  World  Health  Organization  estimate  HIV  prevalence  of  0.64%  (MOH, \n2002 HIV/AIDS summary report). The exposure of currently isolated communities to road traffic \ncalls  for  special  attention  to  the  critical  risks  of  HIV/AIDS  and  sexually  transmitted  infection \n(STI).  In  light  of  women\u2019s  greater  exposure  to  the  risks  and  impacts  of  HIV/AIDS,  culturally \nsensitive  and  gender-responsive  HIV/AIDS  awareness  initiatives  should  be  provided  in \ncampsites and corridors of influence as part of reproductive health programs. \n\n2. \n\nOpportunities \n\n17. \nNational Development Plan. Following the restoration of independence in 2002, Timor-\nLeste  has  aspired  to  build  a  more  democratic  and  affluent  society.  Its  vision,  priorities,  and \ndevelopment strategies are articulated in the National Development Plan. The plan focuses on \ntwo  overriding  development  objectives:  (i)  to  reduce  poverty  in  all  sectors  and  regions  of  the \nnation; and (ii) to promote economic growth that is equitable and sustainable, and improve the \nhealth,  education,  and  well-being  of  the  population.  The  Government  recognizes  that \ninfrastructure is of overarching importance to all sectors of the economy and society; and that \nimproving  infrastructure,  particularly  the  transport  system,  is  critical  to  foster  private  sector \ndevelopment, improve agricultural productivity, reduce poverty, promote investment and human \ndevelopment, and strengthen the Government\u2019s capacity to deliver services. \n\n18. \nSector Investment Plan. Fifteen sector investment plans, sponsored by ADB and other \ndevelopment partners, were developed during 2003\u20132005, covering basic services, production, \nbasic infrastructure, and governance. The plans assessed the status of each sector, identified \nissues, and predicted funding requirements. The plan for transport assessed aviation, maritime, \nand land transport, but placed the emphasis on the road sector. It argued that road investment \nshould receive priority over investments in airports and seaports, as most East Timorese travel \nby  road  and  the  road  network  is  prone  to  failures,  resulting  from  long-term  neglect  of \nmaintenance  and  unfavorable  topographical  and  weather  conditions.  Ports  and  airports  were \nupgraded during earlier emergency measures, and their capacity should meet demand for the \nforeseeable future. \n\n19. \nGovernment  Vision  for  the  Road  Sector.  The  Government\u2019s  10-year  vision  for  the \nroad  system  is  to  (i)  bring  the  road  network  to  a  sustainable  condition  where,  with  regular \nmaintenance,  life-cycle  costs  will  be  minimized,  road  closures  reduced  and  manageable,  and \nroad access reliable; (ii) improve key roads to support a growing economy; (iii) ensure effective \ncapacity  to  manage  the  road  system,  comprising  asset  management  systems  (including  risk \nmanagement),  use  of  the  private  sector  for  cost-effective  delivery,  and  reliable  funding  and \nadequate  cost-recovery  from  users.  Priority  will  be  given  to  maintaining  the  current  roads, \nparticularly  the  core  road  network  serving  major  economic  and  administrative  functions. \nInvestments will focus on projects that provide net economic benefits in terms of reduced road \nmaintenance  and  vehicle  operating  costs,  and  that  support  agricultural  and  industrial \ndevelopments. \n\nADB Strategy. In the short term, economic growth and employment have to come from \n20. \ninfrastructure  investments.  The  ADB  country  strategy  and  program  update  for  2005-20062 \nidentifies  infrastructure  development  and  institutional  capacity  building  as  the  major  areas  for \nADB  assistance.  The  Transport  Sector  Improvement  TA  (footnote  1)  was  to  assist  the \nGovernment in prioritizing road investments to maximize benefits and search for least-cost ways \n\n                                                 \n2   ADB. 2004.Country Assistance Program Update (2005\u20132006): Timor-Leste. Manila. \n\n\f5 \n\nto rehabilitate and maintain the core road system over the coming decade. Extensive surveys of \nroad  conditions,  traffic  volume,  socioeconomic  conditions,  and  the  physical  environment  were \nundertaken.  Rigorous  economic  analyses  were  conducted.  A  prioritized  road  development \nprogram  was  proposed  and  will  be  used  by  the  Government,  ADB,  and  other  development \npartners to plan interventions. \n\n21. \nThe Project comprises four roads located in the central and western south coast of the \ncountry.  These  two  regions  are  agricultural  areas  and  have  potential  for  industrial  and  port \ndevelopment,  and  international  trade,  yet  they  are  currently  suffering  from  isolation  and  food \ninsecurity. The Project will complement efforts of the Government of  Japan and the European \nUnion  (EU)  to  (i)  increase  access  for  people  in  these  two  regions  to  major  market  centers  for \nfood  and  social  services;  (ii)  open  up  opportunities  for  people  to  participate  in  economic \nactivities;  and  (iii)  increase  income  to  enhance  their  affordability  for  food  and  economic  and \nsocial services. It will reduce transport costs for coffee collectors and vehicle operating costs for \nprivate transport service operators, thus promoting industrial and agricultural development. \n\nIn  the  area  of  institutional  capacity  building,  ADB  has  approved  a  TA3  to  develop  an \n22. \nintegrated institutional development road map for infrastructure sectors and a road map for road \nsector capacity building that would leverage resources from development agencies. The TA will \naddress the urgent needs of the road sector by training government  and private  individuals to \nbuild  their  technical  and  contract  management  skills  so  that  they  can  supervise  the  Project  to \nfacilitate  implementation  and  enhance  quality.  This  will  be  followed  by  another  three  TAs  to \nincrease  capacity  in  infrastructure  sectors,  including  roads.  For  the  Project,  the  Project \nManagement  Unit  (PMU)  established  under  the  previous  road  project  will  be  expanded  and \nstrengthened to carry out the Project. One technical staff financed by the Project will be added \nand  a  total  of  212  person-months  of  international  and  domestic  consulting  services  for \nconstruction supervision will be provided to ensure timely project implementation and quality. \n\n23. \nExternal Assistance. External assistance has mainly been provided by the Government \nof  Japan,  EU,  and  ADB.  Since  2000,  the  Government  of  Japan  has  provided  grants  totaling \n$34.6  million  to  transport;  54%  to  the  road  sector  for  roads  improvement,  project  studies,  and \ntraining. The ongoing Dili to Suai road rehabilitation project is adjacent to the Project. The EU \napproved  a  grant  of  $7.6  million  in  May  2004  to  finance  rehabilitation  of  five  bridges  on  the \nalignment from Viqueque to Uatucarbau, which is included as one of the road sections under the \nProject.  Since  2000,  ADB  has  provided  two  TAs  to  transport  totaling  $1.5  million.  It  has \nadministered  two  emergency  infrastructure  rehabilitation  projects  (EIRPs)  funded  by  the  Trust \nFund for East Timor. The first EIRP was a multisector project covering the road, port, and power \nsectors. The total grant was $29.8 million; 80% was applied to roads. It aimed to facilitate peace \nand security, and humanitarian relief aid by addressing immediate system failures. The second \nEIRP, with a grant of $9 million entirely for roads, is ongoing and expected to be completed in \n2007. A summary of external assistance to the sector is presented in Appendix 2. \n\nLessons Learned. Several lessons can be drawn from the experience of administering \n24. \nthe EIRPs. First, as emergency needs are abated, more attention and efforts should be given to \nquality and sustainability. Second, project design needs to take into account the limited capacity \nof  MPW  (the  Executing  Agency)  to  undertake  technical  design,  procure  goods  and  services, \nmonitor  and  supervise  rehabilitation,  and  manage  contracts.  Third,  a  well-staffed  functional \nPMU is critical for project implementation and needs to be put in place at project onset. \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB.  2005.

It will  (i) improve  accessibility  for  residents  in  the \nproject area to food, economic opportunities, and social services; (ii) promote private sector-led \nindustrial and agricultural development; (iii) foster market formation, and facilitate domestic and \ninternational  trade;  and  (iv)  generate  income  and  employment  opportunities.  The  outcome  will \nbe improved road infrastructure for economic and social development.  \n\nB. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  Project  will  produce  the  following  outputs:  (i)  rehabilitation  and  improvement  of \n26. \nabout  123  km  of  core  network  roads;  (ii)  labor-intensive  routine  road  maintenance  for  45  km; \n(iii) sound  and  sustainable  road  maintenance  policies;  (iv)  an  efficient  bidding  and  contracting \nsystem  for  engaging  communities  in  road  maintenance  through  local  small  contractors; \n(v) improved  project  management,  supervision,  and  monitoring;  and  (vi)  identification  of \nmodalities to ensure community-based, gender-inclusive rehabilitation and maintenance of rural \nfeeder roads. Project activities include \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nrehabilitation  of  three  road  sections  to  fair  conditions:  (a)  Oeleu\u2013Zumalai \n(35.9 km), (b) Aituto\u2013Same (30.8 km), and (c) Viqueque\u2013Uatucarbau (55.8 km), \nby  strengthening  the  base,  resurfacing,  protecting  and  stabilizing  slopes,  and \nimproving drainage system and shoulders; \nroutine  maintenance  for  Iliomar\u2013Lospalos  (45  km),  to  be  implemented  by  small \nlocal contractors using labor-intensive methods, and include patching, improving \nside  drains,  repairing  culverts,  improving  shoulders,  constructing  lined  drains, \nand bioengineering;4 \ninternational  and  domestic  consulting  services \nfor  project  management, \nconstruction  supervision,  establishment  of  road  maintenance  policies,  road \nmaintenance  training  and  supervision,  and  socioeconomic  impact  monitoring; \nand  \ncommunity  empowerment  initiatives,  including  (a)  identification  of  community-\nbased and gender-inclusive modalities for rehabilitation and maintenance of rural \nfeeder  roads  adjacent  to  the  project  roads;  (b)  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  road \nsafety  awareness  programs  along  the  project  roads  to  be  implemented  by  an \ninternational  NGO  with  expertise  in  community-based  and  labor-intensive \ninfrastructure development and service delivery in one selected subdistrict along \nthe project roads; and (c) monitoring of employment targets for women. \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nProject Management and Supervision  \n\nActual  implementation  of  the  second  EIRP  (EIRP-2)  did  not  commence  until  2  years \n27. \nafter its effectiveness. Experience with EIRP-2 illustrates the crucial role of the PMU. Currently, \nthe PMU has four staff: a project manager, chief technical adviser (international), road engineer, \n                                                 \n4  Bioengineering is the use of vegetation, terracing, and construction of efficient drainage systems to stabilize road \nembankments  and slopes. The purpose of the vegetation is  to minimize  water penetration into the ground layers \nand to reduce the risk of erosion of the surface soils to ensure long-term sustainability of the roads. Bioengineering \nincludes tree planting with deep-rooted species to reduce the risk of shallow slides and debris flow. \n\n\f7 \n\nand  financial  administrator.  They  are  working  effectively  and  efficiently  to  implement  EIRP-2. \nThe  proposed  Project  will  maintain  and  strengthen  the  PMU  to  enable  it  to  accommodate \nincreased  responsibilities.  One  highway  engineer  will  be  added  to  the  PMU\u2019s  current  staff. \nConsulting  services,  comprising  212  person-months  of  international  and  domestic  consulting \nservices,  will  assist  the  PMU  in  supervising  civil  works  contracts  and  environment  mitigation \nmeasures.  Another  8  person-months  of  international  consulting  and  10  person-months  of \ndomestic will assist the PMU in monitoring and evaluating the Project\u2019s socioeconomic impacts. \nThe  international  consultant  will  provide  the  domestic  consultant  with  hands-on  training  and \nensure knowledge transfer.  \n\n2. \n\nPrioritization of Road Investments \n\n28. \nRehabilitating and maintaining an extensive road network requires sizeable investment. \nGiven  the  constraints  of  financial  resources  and  institutional  capacity,  prioritizing  road \ninvestments to maximize economic and social benefits is crucial. \n\n29. \nTo  define  the  project  scope  and  develop  a  medium-  to  long-term  road  investment \nprogram,  1,650  km  of  the  core  road  network  and  relevant  district  roads  were  surveyed  and \ntraffic counts carried out at 30 locations across the country. Based on the road characteristics \nand  conditions,  traffic  volume,  and  proposed  interventions,  rigorous  economic  analyses  were \nconducted, using the highway design and management model (HDM-4) (a model for searching \nfor  an  optimum  combination  of  investments  and  interventions  for  the  road  sector)  developed \njointly  by  the  World  Bank  and  ADB,  among  others,  to  identify  road  interventions  that  give  the \nbest economic net present values with least-cost investments. The three roads, comprising five \nroad sections to be financed by the Project, top the list in terms of economic net present value. \n\n30. \nThe 5\u201310-year prioritized road investment program based on the economic analysis will \ngive directions for future ADB assistance in the road sector, benefit aid coordination to ensure \nconsistent road sector development planning, and serve as the basis for the Government\u2019s own \nroad sector investments. \n\n3. \n\nAid Coordination and Project Complementarity \n\n31. \nIn  the  process  of  selecting  road  sections  for  the  Project,  close  consultations  with  aid \nagencies  involved  in  the  road  sector,  particularly  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency \nand  EU,  were  conducted  to  maximize  complementarities  and  avoid  overlap.  The  Aituto\u2013Same \nroad  connects  to  the  Dili\u2013Suai  road,  which  is  currently  under  repair  funded  by  the  Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency.  Rehabilitation  of \nthe  Viqueque\u2013Ilioma  road  section \ncomplements  the  EU\u2019s  bridge  project,  which  is now  at  the  design  stage,  and  ensures  that  the \nwhole road is in fair condition. The Project is also complementary to EIRP-2, which is repairing \nshort damaged road sections from Maliana and Zumulai. \n\n4. \n\nRoad Safety and Sustainability  \n\n32. \nRoad  fatalities  in  Timor-Leste  are  among  the  highest  in  southeast  and  south  Asian \ncountries with more than 20 deaths per 10,000 vehicles. The potential for even greater accident \nrates  is  high,  considering  the  increase  in  vehicles,  growing  population,  and  increased  vehicle \nspeeds resulting from improvements to the road network. However, data on traffic accidents and \nfatalities  show  that  most  occur  in  urban  areas,  and  especially  in  Dili.  A  national  road  safety \nstrategy was prepared, but implementation has not started. \n\nRoad  accidents  have  various  causes,  including  poor  road  design  standards,  driver \n33. \nbehavior,  and  lack  of  awareness  among  villagers.  Road  widening  and  realignment  are  not \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\njustifiable  at  this  stage  due  to  demand  constraints.  The  Project  includes  a  pilot  road  safety \nawareness campaign program to be implemented by an NGO.  \n\n34. \nRoad  sustainability  is  a  major  challenge.  This  is  not  mainly  because  of  financial \nconstraints and difficult geographical conditions; but rather capacity constraints to establish road \nmaintenance policies, and to plan, organize, and execute capital and maintenance works. The \nGovernment  is  expecting  total  revenues  to  be  above  $100  million  per  year  for  an  indefinite \nperiod, and has committed about $190 million from the budget for road maintenance during the \nProject.  In  spite  of  growing  capacity,  spending  the  budget  funds  remains  a  challenge  for  the \nGovernment. The Project, through the routine road maintenance Iliomar\u2013Lospalos component, \nwill establish sound and sustainable road maintenance policies for the road sector and project \nroads, and institutionalize a bidding and contracting system for engaging local small contractors \nfrom communities in routine maintenance. This will help the Government continue with its own \nroad maintenance investments and preserve road assets at low costs. \n\n5. \n\nLabor-Intensive Maintenance \n\nRoad  assets  can  be  prevented  from  rapidly  deteriorating  if  timely  routine  maintenance \n35. \ncan  be  done.  Routine  road  maintenance  mainly  involves  clearing  vegetation  from  shoulders, \nimproving and shaping shoulders, clearing drains and culverts, and constructing stone masonry-\nlined  drains,  which  can  be  done  by  labor  without  heavy  equipment.  Labor-intensive  routine \nmaintenance will help extend the life of roads, and generate business opportunities and income \nfor  local  communities.  Under  the  Project,  the  Lliomar\u2013Lospalos  road  section,  which  is  in \nrelatively  good  and  maintainable  condition,  was  selected  for  routine  maintenance  using  labor-\nintensive  methods.  The  ten  contract  packages  for  the  road  will  target  small  contractors  from \nlocal  communities.  An  international  road  maintenance  specialist  will  be  provided  to  train  the \nlocal  contractors,  improve  their  maintenance  skills,  and  ensure  works  are  done  properly.  With \nthe establishment of road maintenance policies, institutionalization of a bidding and contracting \nsystem  for  engaging  local  small  contractors,  and  skill  development,  systematic  labor-intensive \nroad maintenance is expected in the future to preserve assets, while generating income and job \nopportunities. \n\n6. \n\nGender Inclusive Development \n\n(including  at \n\n36. \nIn  light  of  women\u2019s  traditional  exclusion  from  employment  opportunities  derived  from \nroad construction, the Project will support socioculturally sensitive modalities to ensure women\u2019s \ninvolvement in road rehabilitation and maintenance. In this respect, MPW\u2500through the PMU\u2014\nwill encourage civil works contractors to increase the percentage of women workers to 30% of \nwage-laborers \nleast  75%  of  bioengineering  activities).  The  community \nempowerment initiatives for sustainable rehabilitation and maintenance of selected rural feeder \nroads  will  have  a  strong  gender  focus  and  support  a  broad  range  of  initiatives  that  include  (i) \nparticipatory  and  gender-inclusive  identification  and  selection  of  rural  feeder  roads  to  be \nrehabilitated under the Project; and (ii) skills transfer to women in bioengineering, agroforestry, \nand agricultural extension, combined with literacy, nutrition, reproductive health, and HIV/AIDS \nprevention.  The  initiatives  will  include  the  design  of  sustainable  modalities  to  ensure  gender-\ninclusive maintenance of rehabilitated feeder roads. \n\n7. \n\nHIV/AIDS Prevention and Reproductive Health \n\n37. \nAlthough  accurate  data  on  HIV  prevalence  are  not  available,  recent  surveys  jointly \ncarried  out  by  MOH  and  the  World  Health  Organization  estimate  HIV  at  0.64%  of  the \n\n\f9 \n\npopulation.5 In light of the potential impact of road rehabilitation on the spread of HIV/AIDS, the \nProject will fund culturally sensitive and gender-responsive HIV/AIDS awareness and education \ninitiatives  along  the  project  road;  and  target  high-risk  groups,  including  local  construction \nworkers,  long-distance  drivers,  and  women  in  the  campsites  and  in  the  corridors  of  influence \nalong  project  roads.  These  initiatives\u2014to  be  funded  as  part  of  the  community  empowerment \ninitiatives (component 4)\u2014will complement Government-led initiatives for HIV/AIDS prevention, \nbe implemented in consultation with MOH and local government agencies, and are in line with \nthe National Strategic Plan for a Comprehensive and Multi-Sectoral Response to HIV/AIDS and \nSTI 2002\u20132005 (2002). \n\n8. \n\nInstitutional Capacity Development in the Road Sector \n\n38. \nThe  ADB  country  strategy  and  program  update  for  2005-2006  identified  institutional \ncapacity development as central to all activities. Four infrastructure sector capacity development \nTAs are programmed, including one approved in July 2005 (footnote 3). The TA is designed to \naddress  infrastructure  institutional  issues  across  sectors;  and  the  shortage  of  qualified  road \nengineers  to  plan,  execute,  and  supervise  the  road  investment  projects.  The  TA  will  train  60 \nlocal individuals with some technical background, both from the Government and private sector.  \n\n39. \nAlthough  the  Project  focuses  on  physical  road  infrastructure  and  its  implementation,  in \nlight of the capacity-building TA, the Project will provide an ideal training ground for the trainees \nto practice what they have learned from the courses and acquire practical experience in project \nimplementation,  construction  supervision,  and  contract  management.  The  PMU  has  already \nproduced  a  construction  supervision  guide  and  trained  four  Government  officials  by  involving \nthem  in  project  implementation  and  supervision.  With  more  technical  people  available,  more \nstaff can be trained by working with the PMU and international consulting team.  \n\n9. \n\nStakeholder Participation and Consultation \n\nExtensive  public  consultations  were  conducted  with  Government  officials; \n40. \ninternational/national  NGOs  involved  in  community-based  infrastructure  development,  service \ndelivery,  and  HIV/AIDS  prevention;  as  well  as  local  communities  in  the  project  area. \nConsultations  aimed  to  plan  and  prioritize  road  investments,  assess  the  potential  impacts  of \nproposed  interventions,  and  mitigate  associated  adverse  risks.  A  consultation  workshop  was \nsuccessfully  conducted  on  7  March  2005.  During  road  condition  surveys  of  the  national  and \ndistrict  road  network  and  socioeconomic  surveys,  the  TA  consulting  team  (footnote  1) \nconducted 10 key informant interviews with district administrators, district development officers, \nvillage  (suco)  and  hamlet  chiefs,  and  women\u2019s  groups  and  associations.  Nine  village  focus \ngroup discussions were held. Sample surveys with households, vehicle operators, passengers, \nand  freight  shippers  were  conducted.  In  total,  about  600  stakeholders  were  consulted.  They \nshowed  keen  interest  in  sharing  their  perceptions  about  the  causes  of  poverty,  approaches  to \npoverty  reduction,  and  potential  impact  of  road  improvements  on  the  economic  and  social \ndevelopment  of  the  villages.  Road  improvement  ranked  among  the  main  priorities,  which  also \ninclude education, skill training, fertilizers, farming machines, and irrigation to increase farming \nproductivity  and  the  water  supply  system.  Local  community  concerns  were  considered  and \nreflected  in  the  project  design,  particularly  in  designing  the  community  empowerment \ncomponent (Appendix 3). \n\n                                                 \n5  Ministry of Health. 2002.

MPW  will be the Executing Agency, responsible for overall project management. MPW \nwill  operate  through  the  PMU  established  under  MPW  for  EIRP-2.  The  PMU  will  be \nstrengthened for the Project and (i) handle bidding processes, (ii) manage contracts, (iii) monitor \nproject progress, (iv) prepare withdrawal applications, (v) prepare project progress reports and \nproject completion report, (vi) maintain project accounts and complete grant financial records for \nauditing, and (vii) monitor the Project\u2019s socioeconomic impacts. It will ensure that two resident \nengineer offices staffed with a team of international and domestic consultants are established in \nBaucau  and  Maliana  to  oversee  construction  supervision  and  environmental  monitoring,  and \nensure quality. To the extent possible, it will involve regional MPW offices in Baucau, Maliana, \nand Same in project implementation. \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n44. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  2  years.  The  prerehabilitation  activities\u2500detailed \ndesign,  preparation  of  bidding  documents,  tendering,  and  awarding  of  contracts\u2500will  start  in \nJanuary 2006. Commencement of civil works is targeted for November 2006, with completion in \nDecember 2007. The implementation schedule is attached as Appendix 5.  \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n45. \nAll procurement under the Project, including both ADB and the Government-financed \npackages, will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The civil works will be divided into \nseven  packages,  all  to  be  procured  using  local  competitive  bidding  procedures  (Appendix \n6).  These  procedures  are  justified  because  of  the  good  experiences  under  EIRP-2  and \nexistence  of  a  competitive  construction  sector,  in  which  joint  ventures  and  foreign \ncontractors  are  permitted  to  bid.  Postqualification  procedures  will  be  used  to  shorten  the \nbidding  process.  Technical  and  financial  qualifications  of  contractors  will  be  reviewed  in \nconjunction with the review of the bid proposals. Only contractors with adequate technical \nand financial capacities will be allowed to bid for several packages. They may be awarded \nmore  than  one  contract  based  on  the  least-cost  combination  of  contracts.  The  relevant \nsections  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  will  be  included  in  all  documents  and  contracts \nrelated to the bidding and project implementation. \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nInternational and domestic consulting services will be required for (i) engineering design \n46. \nand  preparation  of  bidding  documents;  (ii)  construction  supervision;  (iii)  road  maintenance, \nincluding  formulation  of  policies,  training,  and  supervision;  (iv)  project  management;  (v) \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nfinancial  auditing;  and  (vii)  community \nsocioeconomic  monitoring  and  evaluation;  (vi) \nempowerment initiatives. The Project will fund a total of 132 person-months of international and \n310 person-months of domestic consulting services (Table 3). \n\nTable 3: Consulting Services \n(person-months) \n \n\nItem \n1.

Due to Government agencies' limited capacity to implement grassroots initiatives, \nan  international  NGO  will  be  recruited,  using  the  direct  selection  method,  to  implement  the \ncommunity empowerment component. With the assistance of the ADB Fact-Finding Mission, the \nGovernment has identified CARE Timor-Leste, an experienced international NGO, to implement \nthe component. CARE is the only international NGO whose geographic coverage is consistent \nwith the planned project coverage. Its strategy and priorities are consistent with ADB's program \nof assistance in the country. Its demonstrated track record of involvement in community-based \nand labor-intensive infrastructure development and service delivery, including community-based \nHIV/AIDS  prevention,  is  in  line  with  the  objective  and  scope  of  the  component.  The  terms  of \nreference for community empowerment component are attached in Appendix 7. \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Action \n\n48. \nThe  Government  requested  ADB  approval  of  advance  action  for  recruitment  of \nconsulting services, and procurement of civil works. The approval of advance action was given \nduring the Management Review Meeting. Advance action covers invitation of bids, bidding, and \nbid  evaluation,  but  will  not  include  contract  awards.  The  advance  action  will  be  undertaken  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \nThe  Government  was  advised  that  approval  of  the  advance  action  does  not  commit  ADB  to \nfinancing the Project. \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nThe  grant  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook. \n49. \nThe  disbursement  procedures  will \nimprest  account,  and \nreimbursements. The PMU will open and maintain an imprest account separate from the one for \nEIRP-2  in  a  domestic  commercial  bank  in  Dili.  The  maximum  amount  in  the  account  will  be \neither 10% of the total ADB grant or equivalent to 6 months of expenditure, whichever is lower. \n\ninclude  direct  payments, \n\n\f13 \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n50.  MPW,  through  the  PMU,  will  maintain  a  separate  account  for  the  Project  and  prepare \nseparate  financial  statements,  indicating  sources  and  application  of  funds,  and  have  them \naudited  by  the  international  accountant  engaged  by  the  Project.  The  audited  project  accounts \nand the auditor\u2019s reports will be provided to ADB within 6 months after the end of each financial \nyear. MPW, through the PMU, will prepare and submit to ADB quarterly project progress reports \nand a project completion report within 3 months after project completion. \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n\nfor  social  and  poverty \n\n51. \nADB and the Government will agree on a set of indicators for monitoring and evaluating \nproject  performance  in  relation  to  its  goals  and  purposes,  with  an  emphasis  on  poverty \nreduction,  prior  to  project  commencement.  Eight  person-months  of  international  consulting \nservices and 10 person-months of domestic consulting services are provided under the Project \nto  establish  and  monitor  indicators,  and  evaluate  project  performance.  The  international \nconsultant  will  work  with  the  domestic  consultant  to  establish  gender  disaggregated  baseline \nindicators  during  project \ndata \nimplementation and at project completion, and assess the Project\u2019s socioeconomic impacts. The \nconsultant  will  provide  hands-on  training  to  the  domestic  consultant  on  data  collection, \nmonitoring,  and  evaluation. The  indicators  may  include  (i) economic  development  and  poverty \nindicators  for  the  project  area;  (ii) industrial  and  agricultural  outputs;  (iii) transport  costs  and \ntime; (iv) transport services and charges, (v) accident rates; (vi) level of social services including \nschool enrollment and infant mortality; and (viii) jobs created in rehabilitation and maintenance. \nEmployment  impact  indicators  include  information  about  unskilled  laborers,  poor  laborers,  and \nwomen laborers. \n\nindicators,  monitor \n\nimpact \n\nthe \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\nThe  Project  will  be  reviewed  every  6  months.  Each  review  will  cover  all  institutional, \n52. \nadministrative, organizational, technical, environmental, social, poverty reduction, resettlement, \neconomic, financial, and other relevant aspects that may have an impact on the performance of \nthe Project and its continuing viability. \n\n10. \n\nAnticorruption \n\n53. \nThe Fact-Finding Mission explained ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy to MPW and the PMU, \nhighlighting  the  section  on  fraud  and  corruption  in  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  Procurement  and \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. For the Project, the financial administrator in the PMU for \nEIRP-2 will continue to be employed and funded by the Project, and an international consultant \nwith adequate knowledge and experience of international accounting practices will be recruited \nto audit the project accounts and financial statements.  \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n54. \nTraffic  forecasts  by  vehicle  type  and  type  of  traffic  (normal  and  generated)  were \nprepared for the project road sections for 20 years from 2005 to 2024. The forecasts are based \non expected GDP growth and on the income elasticity for national transport demand in relation \nto GDP growth. According to the International Monetary Fund\u2019s medium-term outlook for Timor-\nLeste,  GDP  will  grow  at  5%  per  annum.  Income  elasticity  of  demand  for  normal  traffic  is \nestimated at 1.2. Therefore, growth for normal traffic is estimated at 6%. This applies to all types \nof  vehicles  and  is  justified,  given  the  lack  of  secondary  data  and  any  previous  studies. \nGenerated traffic is assumed to represent 10% of normal traffic, adjusted for seasonal patterns. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nA conservative assumption is that no traffic will be generated on roads that are not in very poor \noverall condition. The traffic forecast for the project road sections is summarized in Appendix 8. \n\n55. \nThe  economic  analysis  was  carried  out  for  the  three  project  roads  by  comparing  the \nwith-  and  without-project  scenarios  using  the  highway  design  and  management  model  (para. \n28). The economic analysis covers 20 years (2005\u20132024), based on a rehabilitation period of 1 \nyear starting in 2007. All benefits and costs are in constant 2005 prices. The economic prices \nare expressed using the world price numeraire. \n\nThe economic costs of the Project are (i) the capital cost, including labor, equipment and \n56. \nmaterials,  consulting  services,  and  physical  contingency;  and  (ii)  the  costs  of  maintaining  the \nproject  roads.  The  economic  benefits  arise  from  (i)  savings  in  vehicle  operating  costs, \nparticularly repair costs, due to the improved road conditions; (ii) savings in maintenance costs; \n(iii) time savings for road users; and (iv) benefits to generated traffic. The Project will have other \nbenefits,  such  as  improved  food  security  and  access  to  economic  and  social  services,  which \nwere not included in the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) calculation.  \n\nUsing a 12% discount rate, the net present value is $6.85 million and the EIRR 24.1%. \n57. \nThe  vehicle  operating  cost  savings  account  for  the  majority  of  the  benefits  (95%  of  the  total). \nThe  results  of  the  sensitivity  analysis  confirm  the  Project\u2019s  economic  viability.  The  switching \nvalue6  for  increased  rehabilitation  costs  is  determined  to  be  92%,  and  the  switching  value  for \ndecreased  benefits  44%.  In  the  worst  case  scenario\u2014a  combination  of  increased  costs  and \ndecreased benefits\u2014the net present value would be reduced to $3.42 million, and the EIRR to \n17.7%. Detailed economic analysis is in Appendix 9. \n\nV. \n\nPOVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL IMPACTS \n\nA. \n\nPoverty Reduction Impact \n\nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  in  the  project  area  and  the  country  by \n58. \npromoting  economic  growth  through  investment  and  road  infrastructure  improvement.  The \nextensive  national,  district,  village,  and  hamlet  surveys  indicate  that  the  Project  will  directly \nbenefit  the  road  users,  such  as  rural  households,  passengers,  vehicle  operators,  freight \nshippers,  traders,  and  the  private  sector  as  a  whole.  Many  users,  particularly  poor  users,  are \ncurrently  suffering  from  high  transportation  costs,  while  vehicle  operators  and  owners \nexperience  high  vehicle  operating  costs,  including  high  vehicle  repair  costs.  The  Project  is \nexpected to benefit about 62,000 people, including 55,000 poor and 28,000 extremely poor.  \n\nThe Project will reduce poverty by providing villagers in the project area with immediate \n59. \nincome-generating  opportunities.  During \nimplementation,  about  500  person-years  of \nemployment will be created. At its completion, the Project will contribute to a better livelihood for \nvillagers  by  (i)  providing  mobility  to  isolated  societies;  (ii)  easing  access  to  market  centers  for \nfood, education, and health services; (iii) promoting trading and hence cash crop cultivation; and \n(iv) reducing transport costs for the private sector as presented in Appendix 10. \n\nB. \n\nSocial and Gender Impact \n\n60. \nDuring project preparation, the potential social and gender benefits and impacts on local \ncommunities  and  vulnerable  groups  were  analyzed.  This  was  done  through  a  stakeholder \nconsultation  workshop,  key  informant  interviews  in  districts,  subdistricts,  villages  (suco),  and \n\n                                                 \n6  The switching value shows the percentage increase in a cost variable (or decline in a benefit variable) required for \n\nthe net present value to become zero, which is the same as the EIRR reducing to the cut-off level of 12%. \n\n\f15 \n\nhamlets (aldeia), focus group discussions, and a set of small-sample surveys. The documented \nconsultations  confirm  widespread  support  for  the  Project.  The  poor  condition  of  the  roads\u2014\nincluding feeder roads to farms, gardens, and other aldeias\u2014was cited as a major concern by \nfive of nine focus groups. It was followed by lack of access to income-generating opportunities, \nwhich is closely related to the existing poor road conditions that prevent easy access to market \nactivity centers. Lack of access to other primary facilities such as a water supply system, health-\ncare facilities, and schools is considered by many as a high-priority issue. Reliable figures are \nnot  available  to  quantify  unemployment  and  underemployment  in  the  project  area,  however \nlabor  demand  is  highly  seasonal  because  most  local  residents  are  subsistence  or  near-\nsubsistence farmers. Community consultations confirmed people\u2019s strong desire to participate in \nthe  Project  as  wage  laborers  during  road  rehabilitation,  and  their  willingness  to  carry  out \ncommunity-based maintenance activities once the roads are improved. \n\n61. \nThe gender division of labor and women\u2019s traditional exclusion from the benefits derived \nfrom  road  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  works  were  clearly  identified  during  focus  group \ndiscussions with public works constructors. The Project will seek modalities to promote gender \nequality  and  women\u2019s  greater  access  to  employment  opportunities  provided  by  road \nimprovement  by  encouraging  civil  works  contractors  to  (i)  increase  the  percentage  of  women \nworkers  to  30%  of  their  labor  force  (including  women\u2019s  involvement  in  at  least  75%  of \nbioengineering  activities),  and  (ii)  carry  out  gender-sensitive  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  road \nsafety awareness in the project area. \n\n62. \nAnecdotal  evidence  suggests  an  increase  in  the  number  of  traffic  accidents,  with  a \ncontinuing  increasing  trend  as  the  road  network  is  improved  and  overall  traffic  increases.  The \nProject will carry out awareness campaigns for the local population in the project area (including \nvehicle operators as one target group) and safety education programs for school children. This \nawareness program will be accompanied by establishing checkpoints and posting warning signs \nat \nto  be \nimproved/maintained to slow down traffic passing through the area. \n\nthe  entrance  of  each  residential  area \n\nthe  road  sections \n\nlocated  along \n\n63. \nOther  than  the  HIV/AIDS  and  traffic  safety  issues,  the  Project  will  have  no  adverse \nimpact  on  vulnerable  groups  and  no  negative  implication  for  indigenous  people.  No  minority \nethnic  groups  or  indigenous  population  groups  are  found  in  the  project  area.  No  resettlement \nplan will be necessary as the Project will occur within the existing alignment or on land owned \nby the Government. \n\nC. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\nThe Project is classified as environmental category B, as all road improvement activities \n64. \nwill  be  confined  to  existing  rights-of-way,  and  no  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  will  be \nrequired. Field surveys in the areas of roads selected for rehabilitation and improvement were \nconducted  to  assess  environmental  impacts  of  the  Project,  and  an  initial  environmental \nexamination  (IEE)  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines 2003 the summary of which is presented in Appendix 11. The IEE findings support \nthe overall category B (nonsensitive) classification for the Project. \n\nThe  Project  does  not  pass  through  protected  areas  and  will  have  no  impact  on  native \n65. \nfauna  and  flora.  The  construction  of  improved  drainage  structures,  stabilization  of  slopes \nthrough bioengineering, replanting of trees, and other measures undertaken by the Project will \nhave long-term beneficial effects on the environment. The frequency and severity of landslides \nwill  be  reduced  along  the  project  roads.  The  replanting  of  trees  and  native  vegetation  will \nstabilize the landscape, may help improve water quality, and will enhance scenic beauty. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nShort-term  impacts  will  be  unavoidable,  such  as  traffic  delays,  noise,  dust,  and  other \n66. \ntemporary  impacts  such  as  loss  of  vegetation  due  to  earth  moving.  These  impacts  will  be \ndirectly related to rehabilitation operations and will end with the completion of rehabilitation. As a \nresult, required mitigation measures are minor. Adherence to best engineering practices during \nthe  rehabilitation  phase  and  strict  enforcement  of  the  environmental  management  plan  (EMP) \nwill avoid or adequately mitigate all of the rehabilitation-related impacts.   \n\nD. \n\nProject Risks \n\n67. \nThe  design  of  the  Project  has  taken  into  account  potential  risks  associated  with  the \nproject  management  and  rehabilitation  quality.  The  Project  will  maintain  and  expand  the  PMU \nestablished for EIRP-2 to strengthen its capacity so that it can handle greater responsibilities. A \nteam of international and domestic consultants will be provided for construction supervision. A \ncommunity empowerment program, dealing with road safety, HIV/AIDS, and other social risks, \nwill be implemented by an NGO. Environmental  impact will be monitored through construction \nsupervision  and  mitigated  at  the  rehabilitation  stage  in  accordance  with  the  EMP.  Project \nsustainability  will  be  enhanced  by ensuring  rehabilitation quality,  training  Government  officials, \nidentifying low-cost maintenance modalities, and establishing maintenance policies for the road \nsector and project roads. \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n68. \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the Grant Agreement: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nCounterpart  financing.

The Government, through the PMU, will submit monitoring \nand  evaluation  reports  to  ADB  1  month  after  the  completion  of  the  consultants\u2019 \nfield work. To the extent possible, the indicators and baseline data will make full \nuse of gender-disaggregated data and information. \n\n(viii)  Labor  laws.  The  Government,  through  the  PMU,  will  ensure  that  civil  works \ncontractors comply with all applicable labor laws and related international treaty \nobligations,  and  do  not  employ  child  labor  for  rehabilitation  and  maintenance \nactivities.  \n\nRoad  safety.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  MPW  installs  appropriate  road \nsafety  facilities  during  project  implementation,  including  pavement  markings, \ntraffic signs and signals, warning signs, and hazard barriers. \n\nLand acquisition and resettlement. The Government will ensure that all project \nrehabilitation  works  are  undertaken  within  existing  rights-of-way.  In  the  event  of \nany  unforeseen  resettlement,  the  Government  will  inform  ADB  and  prepare  a \nresettlement plan or plans according to relevant laws and regulations, and ADB\u2019s \nPolicy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995).  The  PMU  will  ensure  that  no \nconstruction of civil works commences until ADB has reviewed and approved the \nresettlement plan/s. \n\nGender  and  development.  The  PMU  will  (a)  encourage  local  contractors  to \nemploy 30% of women in road rehabilitation and labor-intensive maintenance of \nselected  national  roads  (including  at  least  75%  of  those  employed  for \nbioengineering  activities),  (b)  provide  equal  pay  to  men  and  women  for  work  of \nequal type in accordance with national laws and international treaty obligations, \nand  (c)  provide  safe  working  conditions  for  both  male  and  female  workers. \nSpecific  provisions  to  this  effect  will  be  included  in  the  bidding  documents.  The \nPMU  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  the  employment  targets  for  women  by \nreviewing  periodically  the  payroll  statements  of  the  construction  contractors \nthrough  the  engagement  of  CARE  Timor-Leste,  and  will  reflect  progress  in \nachieving the employment targets for women in the project progress reports and \nproject completion report. \n\n(xii)  Health risks.

The \nconsultations were conducted in the form of (i) a large stakeholder workshop; (ii) key informant \ninterviews  at  district,  subdistrict,  village,  and  hamlet  levels;  (iii)  focus  group  discussions;  and \n(iv) a  set  of  small-sample  surveys  of  local  households,  passengers,  vehicle  operators,  freight \noperators, and shops throughout the country. The list of the consultations is as follows: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nlarge consultation workshop, The Future of Timor-Leste\u2019s Road Sector, (over 50 \nparticipants  from  government  agencies,  international  organizations,  local  and \ninternational nongovernment organizations (NGOs), March 2005; \nfield  consultations  throughout  the  country,  which  included  key  informant \ninterviews  at  district,  subdistrict,  village,  and  hamlet  levels,  focus  group \ndiscussions,  small  sample  surveys  of  local  population,  vehicle  operators, \npassengers, freight shippers, and shops, between March and May 2005; and  \nconsultations  to  assess  the  needs  and  practicality  of  increasing  community \nparticipation  in  the  project  implementation  with  NGOs  and  other  parties \nconcerned, May 2005. \n\n2. \nThese  consultations  serve  as  the  basis  for  the  social  and  poverty  analyses  of  the \nProject.  The  insights  obtained  are  incorporated  in  the  project  design  in  the  form  of  a \nparticipation  strategy  in  general  and  for  women,  and  in  the  mitigation  measures  and \ncomplementary  actions  to  increase  the  Project's  benefits  received  by  the  poor  and  other \nvulnerable groups. \n\nB. \n\nStakeholder Consultation Workshop \n\n3. \nThe first consultation workshop, The Future of Timor-Leste\u2019s Road Sector, was held at \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)\u2013World  Bank  (WB)  Conference  Room  with  over  50 \nparticipants  from  various  departments  of  the  Government  of  Timor-Leste,  international \ndevelopment  agencies  such  as  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  and  international \nand local NGOs. The workshop was very well received and greatly enhanced the understanding \nof  the  Project  among  the  parties  concerned,  with  the  participants  actively  engaging  in  the \ndiscussions. The topics covered in the workshop are (i) project goals and general approach, (ii) \nprioritizing road investments, (iii) commercial management and financing roads, (iv) social and \npoverty analyses, and (v) presentation on environmental analysis. The workshop was attended \nby the following organizations: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nGovernment:  Directorate  General  of  Roads,  Bridges,  and  Flood  Control;  district \nadministration  (Aileu,  Bobonaro,  Dili,  Ermera,  Lautem,  Oecusse,  Suai,  and \nViqueque);  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Forestry,  and  Fisheries;  and  Ministry  of \nPlanning and Finance\u2014Treasury; \ninternational organizations: Japan International Cooperation Agency; \nnongovernment  organizations:  Associacao  Mai  Halibur  Hamutuk,  Associacao \ndos  Ex-Presineros  Politicos,  Associacao  dos  Veteranos  Das  Falintil,  Christian \nChildren Fund, Comite Mediasi dan Advocacy Hak-Hak Buruh (Come Right),East \nTimor  Agriculture  Development  Program,  Fundacao  Creshe  12  de  Novembro, \nFundacao De Espinhos Da Rosa, Feto Ki\u2019ik Servico Hamutuk,Fundasaun Terus \nAtu Ukun Rasik An (Fundasaun TAURAN), GERTIL FAUTL, Hotu Hotu Fo Lima \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n23 \n\nTane  Timor  Oan,  World  Vision  People\u2019s  Economic  Development  Center, \nFundasaun Dame no Demokrasia, and Peace Winds Japan. \n\nC. \n\nField Consultations \n\nThe local population was consulted between 18 March and 5 May 2005 to assess their \n4. \nneeds, demands, and willingness to support the Project; socioeconomic status; and absorptive \ncapacity  in  Bobonaro,  Ermera,  Manatuto,  Baucau,  and  Viqueque  districts.  The  consultations \nincluded  10  key  informant  interviews  with  district  administrators,  district  deputy  administrators, \ndistrict development officers, suco (village) chiefs, and other key figures in villages; nine focus \ngroup  discussions  with  seven  participants  on  average;  and  small-sample  surveys  of  local \nhouseholds, local population, passengers, vehicle operators, freight shippers, and shops (about \n400 survey responses in total). \n\nD. \n\nKey Informant Interviews \n\n5. \nThe key informant interviews serve multiple purposes. A key feature is that, by engaging \nthe potential beneficiaries, it was found how much the informants support the Project and what \nconcerns  they  have  about  the  Project.  Next,  it  was  observed  directly  the  degree  and  depth  of \npoverty  evident  in  the  area,  which  helps  justify  the  estimates  of  the  number  of  poor  and  very \npoor beneficiaries. The interviews also show the relative importance of other concerns held by \nthe  beneficiaries,  and  how  improving  the  roads  ranks  relative  to  other  needed  public  works \nprojects and needed provision of other public services. \n\n6. \nPrior  to  visiting  villages  and  markets  for  interviews  and  surveys,  meetings  were \nconducted  with  respective  district  administrators,  deputy  district  administrators,  and/or  district \ndevelopment  officers;  basic  socioeconomic  information  on  the  district  was  gathered.  With  the \noverall picture of the district, villages were visited and markets located along the potential roads \nto be improved. Key village informant interviews were conducted with suco chiefs and/or other \nkey  persons  in  the  village,  such  as  school  teachers.  The  villages  for  key  informant  interviews \nwere  selected  to  obtain  a  representative  picture  of  the  area.  Those  interviewed  are  listed  in \nTable A3.1. \n \n\nTable A3.1: List of Interview Participants \n\nTitle \nDistrict Development Officer \n\nName \nMarcelino Ferreira Neto \nLeonel de Jesus Carvalho  District Administrator  \nJustino Viegas Amaral \nSilvino Cardoso \nJoao Mestre \nDomingos Magalhaes \nPedro Afonso Soares \n\nVillage Chief/School Teacher \nVillage Chief \nDistrict Development Officer \nVillage Chief \nVillage Chief/School Teacher \n\nDuarte Martins \nGaspar Da Silva \nFrancisco Da Silva \nEstevao \nSabino \n\nVillage Chief \nDistrict Development Officer  \nDistrict Administrator  \nDistrict Development Officer  \nDistrict Administrative Officer \n\nDistrict \nBaucau \nBobonaro \nBobonaro \nBobonaro \nErmera \nErmera \nErmera \n\nErmera \nManatuto \n \nViqueque \n \n\nSubdistrict \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \nBobonaro \nBobonaro \n\u2014 \nLetefoho \nLetefoho \n\nHatulia \n\u2014 \n \n\u2014 \n \n\nVillage \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \nTapo \nLourba \n\u2014 \nHaufu \nCatrai \nLeten \nHatulia \n\u2014 \n \n\u2014 \n \n\nSource:  ADB.  2001.

Manila. \n \n7. \nThe information gathered through key informant interviews included population; number \nof households and average household size; ethnic distribution; availability of public and private \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\ntransport;  availability  of  and  average  distance  to  schools,  health  facilities,  electricity,  running \nwater,  and  economic  centers;  major  economic  activities  and  main  income  sources;  average \nincome;  and  the  educational  status  of  the  population.  Key  informant  interviews  also  provided \nuseful insights into basic infrastructure community programs. \n\nE. \n\nFocus Group Discussions \n\n8. \nFollowing  the  key  informant  interviews,  separate  focus  group  discussions  were \nconducted  with  female  and  male  participants  in  selected  villages  to  assess  the  villagers' \nperceptions of poverty, basic poverty profiles, and potential impact of road improvement on the \neconomic  and  social  development  of  the  village,  and  to  obtain  information  on  gender-specific \nissues  and  concerns.  To  provide  the  opportunity  for  different  gender  groups  to  express  their \nviews  more  comfortably,  a  female  interviewer  facilitated  and  recorded  the  focus  group \ndiscussions for females, and a male interviewer for the men. The list of focus group discussions \nheld is provided in Table A3.2. \n\n9. \nNine  focus  group  discussions  were  conducted,  of  which  five  were  male  focus  group \ndiscussions,  and  four,  female.  Each  discussion  consisted  of  three  to  eight  persons  and  lasted \nfrom  one-  to  one-and-a-half  hours.  The  villagers  were  very  willing  to  participate  in  lively \ndiscussions,  and  the  proposed  Project  received  overwhelming  positive  responses  from  the \nvillagers.  Roads  are  considered  as  one  of  the  main  issues  of  their  concern,  and  road \nimprovement  is  perceived  very  important  for  their  daily  living.  Thus,  virtually  all  of  the \nrespondents  expressed  their  strong  desire  to  participate  in  the  construction  as  wage  laborers \nand their willingness to carry out community-level maintenance activities. \n\nTable A3. 2: Focus Group Discussions \n\nDistrict \n\nSubdistrict \n\nVillage \n\nFocus Discussion Group \n\nNumber of \nParticipants \n\nBobonaro \nBobonaro \nBobonaro \nLetefoho \nLetefoho \nHatulia \nHatulia \nOssu \nOssu \n\nBobonaro \nBobonaro \nBobonaro \nErmera \nErmera \nErmera \nErmera \nViqueque \nViqueque \nSource: ADB. 2001.

These  surveys  were  conducted  in  the  areas,  including  market \nplaces,  along  the  potential  roads  to  be  improved,  except  freight  shipper  surveys.  The  freight \nshipping  sector  is  underdeveloped  in  Timor-Leste,  and  virtually  all  freight  shippers  are  within \nDili, thus the surveys were conducted in Dili. \n\n11. \nEach  surveyed  group  provided  information  critical  to  performing  the  poverty  and  social \nanalyses,  and  to  providing  ideas  about  the  best  complementary  actions  and  mitigation \nmeasures. Moreover, the group survey  responses reinforced the method used to estimate the \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n25 \n\nnumber  of  beneficiaries  and  of  poor  and  very  poor  beneficiaries.  The  passenger  and  local \npopulation  surveys  show  how  the  poor  and  very  poor  use  the  roads,  which  is  a  critical \nparameter  to  the  poverty  impact  assessment.  The  survey  collected  a  great  deal  more \ninformation  about  the  passengers  and  local  population.  For  example,  the  results  provide \ninformation  on  the  degree  of  difficulty  people  experience  in  accessing  schools  and  hospitals, \nand  how  they  believe  an  improved  road  would affect  them,  which  would  form  a  critical  part  of \nthe  social  analysis.  The  vehicle  operator  survey  provides  information  on  the  structure  and \nperformance  of  the  transportation  services  markets,  which  are  also  key  parameters  for  the \npoverty impact analysis.  \n\n12. \nBoth  the  detailed  household  and  the  local  population  surveys  collected  basic \nsocioeconomic information on local households. While they are similar in many ways, they differ \nin that the detailed household survey is designed mainly for the social analysis to (i) obtain more \ndetailed  information  on  household  income  sources,  expenditure  items,  and  household  living \nstatus than the local population surveys; and (ii) assess the individual perspective on poverty, \ngender roles, and concerns. \n\nG. \n\nConsultations  to  Assess  the  Prospect  of  Increasing  Community  Participation  in \nProject Implementation \n\n \n13. \nDuring the ADB Fact-Finding Mission in May 2005, meetings were conducted with staff \nfrom a number of local and international NGOs; Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries; \nand  East  Timorese  consulting  firms  and  civil  works  contractors  (for  the  list  of  the  consulted \norganizations,  see  Table  A3.3).  The  main  purpose  was  to  identify  and  assess,  in  the  specific \ncontext  of  Timor-Leste:  the  pros  and  cons  of  community-based,  labor-intensive  rehabilitation \nand  maintenance  of  roads;  appropriate  modalities  to  increase  women's  participation  in  the \nProject in a culturally sensitive and acceptable manner; adequate methods to address the issue \nof HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infection (STI); and the capacity of East Timorese NGOs \nto carrying out the community empowerment component of the Project. \n\nTable A3.3: Consulted Organizations \n\nName \nAssociation HAK (Association for Law, \nHuman Rights and Justice) \nCare International in Timor-Leste \nCaritas \nCarya Timor-Leste \nKaiwatu Kmanek (KWK) Consultant \nLao Hamutuk \nMinistry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries \nNongovernment Organization Forum \nTimor-Leste \nOxfam Australia \nPT Gunung Kijiang \nRede Feto Timor-Leste \n\nType of Organization \n\nEast Timorese nongovernment organization \n\nInternational nongovernment organization \nInternational nongovernment organization \nEast Timorese civil works contractor \nEast Timorese consulting firm \nEast Timorese nongovernment organization \n\n \n\nUmbrella organization for East Timorese nongovernment \norganizations \n\nInternational nongovernment organization \nEast Timorese civil works contractor \nUmbrella organization for East Timorese  \nnongovernment organizations working on women\u2019s \nissues \n\nPT = perseroan terbatas (limited liability company).  \nSource:  ADB.  2001.

Considering  the \npossibility  of  applying  a  similar  approach  to  the  proposed  Project,  the  Mission  met  with  the \nministry's  irrigation  adviser  to  assess  the  past  performance  of  such  projects,  problems \nencountered, and actual procedures of implementing such projects. \n\n15.  Meetings were also conducted with a number of organizations (both East Timorese and \ninternational), which included the NGO Forum Timor-Leste; Rede Feto Timor-Leste; and major \ninternational  NGOs  working  extensively  in  the  areas  of  community  empowerment  and  rural \ndevelopment  in  Timor-Leste,  such  as  Care  International,  Caritas,  and  Oxfam  Australia.  The \nmeetings were to obtain feedback on a range of issues, including the capacity of East Timorese \nNGOs,  appropriate  measures  to  address  HIV/AIDS  and  STI  issues  in  the  cultural  context  of \nTimor-Leste, and modalities to promote the participation of women and other vulnerable groups \nin project implementation. \n\n16. \nTo  assess  the  practicality  of  placing  gender-inclusive  modalities  in  the  project  design \nand addressing HIV/AIDS and STI issues with construction workers, meetings were conducted \nwith  two  East  Timorese  civil  works  contractors  and  one  East  Timorese  consulting  firm.  These \nfirms  have  been  working  on  similar  civil  works  projects  in  Timor-Leste  using  local  laborers. \nInformation  was  obtained  on  their  hiring  practices  and  their  views  and  opinions  on  including \nemployment quota requirements for women and the poor, and on how culturally sensitive issues \nsuch  as  HIV/AIDS  and  STI  should  be  addressed.  The  feedback  and  opinions  received  are \nreflected throughout the project design. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\na.  Aituto\u2013Same \nb.   Viqueque\u2013Uatucarbau \nc.

The  three  subcomponents  will \ninclude  (i)  sustainable  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  of  rural  feeder  roads  in  one  selected \nsubdistrict;  (ii)  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  road  safety  program  along  the  project  roads,  which \ninclude  Aituto\u2013Same  [A05],  Viqueque\u2013Uatucarbau  [A08],  Oeleu\u2013Zumalai  [A16],  and  Iliomar\u2013\nLospalos  [A08];  and  (iii)  monitoring  of  the  employment  target  for  women.  Consulting  services \nwill  be  provided,  during \ninternational \nnongovernment  organization  (NGO)  with  expertise  in  community-based  and  labor-intensive \ninfrastructure development and service delivery in the project area. This integrated approach to \ncommunity  empowerment\u2014connecting  isolated  communities  to  main  roads,  primary  facilities, \nand/or  markets  while  providing  skills  necessary  for  economic  activities  and  raising  awareness \non  health  and  safety  related  issues\u2014is  likely  to  bring  significant  benefits  to  participating \ncommunities  as  a  whole,  building  upon  extensive  experience  and  demonstrated  success  of \ninternational NGOs working in one selected district. \n\nthe  2  years  of  project \n\nimplementation,  by  an \n\nB. \n\nProject Subcomponents \n\n2. \nSubcomponent  A:  Sustainable  Rehabilitation  and  Maintenance  of  Rural  Feeder \nRoads.

The  international  NGO  will  be \nretained  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  based  on  direct  selection \nprocedure.  To  be  eligible  for  funding,  the  international  NGO  must  have  (i)  long-term  presence \nand  credibility  in  working  with  local  communities  in  districts  adjacent  to  the  project  roads;  (ii) \ndemonstrated track record of involvement in community-based and labor-intensive infrastructure \ndevelopment  and  service  delivery;  (iii)  involvement  in  promoting  socioculturally  sensitive \nHIV/STI  prevention  and  road  safety  in  the  project  roads;  (iv)  extensive  experience  in  working \nwith and strengthening the capacity of local NGOs in the project area; and (v) expertise in the \nproposed areas of agricultural extension services, food nutrition issues, and rural development \nin  general.  The  services  are  expected  to  commence  in  the  second  half  of  2006  or  3  months \nbefore the commencement of the road rehabilitation and to be completed 2 years later in 2008. \nEquipment,  supplies,  and  materials  under  the  component  will  be  procured  following  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  The  equipment  will  be  turned  over  to  the  local  communities  after \ngrant completion. \n\nE. \n\nMonitoring and Reporting \n\nThe \n\ninternational  NGO  will  produce  an \n\n10. \nthe \ncommencement of services, and submit quarterly progress reports and a final report to the PMU \nand  ADB.  It  will  submit  a  draft  final  report  covering  all  subjects  and  requirements  after  the \ncompletion  of  all  activities.  The  final  report  will  include  comments  from  the  Government  and \nADB  30  days  after  the  final  tripartite  meeting  of  the  Government,  ADB,  and  the  international \n\ninception  report  2  months  after \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n33 \n\nNGO. The report will be submitted in English and should include technical analysis supported by \ndata, with administrative and other details in appendixes. \n\n11. \nThe component will be monitored based on indicators including (i) women\u2019s inclusion in \nthe  processes  of  identification  and  selection  of  rural  feeder  roads;  (ii) veterans\u2019  and  other \ndisaffected  stakeholder  groups\u2019  inclusion  in  the  process  of  identification  and  selection  of  rural \nfeeder  roads;  (iii)  meeting  the  employment  targets  for  women  workers;  (iv) visits  to  health \nfacilities  and  local  markets;  (v)  acquired  labor  skills  in  bioengineering,  feeder  roads  built,  and \nagricultural  extension;  (vi)  knowledge  on  literacy,  nutrition,  reproductive  health,  and  HIV/AIDS \nprevention; and (vii) knowledge on road safety, management and business skills acquired, and \ngender-inclusive  modalities  for  sustainable  maintenance  of  rural  feeder  roads.  Specific \nindicators will be established by mutual understanding between the NGO and the PMU, along \nwith conditions that will enable the NGO to achieve the targets set through the indicators within \nthe time frame of the Project and within the agreed-upon final budget. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nA. \n\nRoad Network \n\nROAD SECTOR ANALYSIS \n\n1. \nRoads, the dominant mode of transport in Timor-Leste, carry about 70% of freight and \n90%  of  passenger  traffic.  The  road  network  is  dense  compared  with  other  countries  with \ncomparable income levels. The total length of the road network is estimated at 6,040 kilometers \n(km),  consisting  of  1430  km  of  national  roads  linking  district  centers,  870  km  of  district  roads, \nproviding links to large administrative centers, and 720 km in Dili and several smaller regional \ntowns. The remaining 3,020 km comprises rural access or feeder roads. Urban roads represent \nabout  800  km  and  feeder/rural  roads  roughly  3,020  km.  About  1,800  km  of  roads  are  paved, \nrepresenting  a  relatively  large  part  of  the  core  network  (84%).  Almost  100%  of  the  national \nroads are paved, and all were paved at some time. \n\nThe road network is strongly influenced by its spatial and physical environment. A main \n2. \narterial  road  runs  along  the  semiarid  northern  coast,  serving  the  economic  activity  around  Dili \nand trade connections by sea and  to the west. Connections with the southern economic zone \ncross a mountainous and midland area, which includes steep lands of unstable rock and poor \nsoils  that  are  highly  susceptible  to  erosion  and  landslides.  Most  of  the  north\u2013south  road \nconnections  are  impassable  year-round  at  this  time.  The  southern  coastal  zone,  which  has \nhigher population density, agricultural production, and energy reserves, has a moisture climate \nand  comprises  alluvial  formations  and  numerous  rivers  which  are  prone  to  changing  course \nduring the monsoon. The network is thus vulnerable to natural hazards of erosion and flooding, \nand access is frequently cut at high-risk locations during the wet season and frequently remains \nimpassable  during  the  dry  season.  The  terrain  and  low  standard  of  roads  limit  the  support \nprovided to the economy in the south and midlands, such as coffee and agriculture, and soon \nenergy resources. \n\n3. \nThe extensive road network was constructed with relatively low standards of design and \nmaterials. A pragmatic approach adapting to the often severe terrain conditions were obviously \nused,  resulting  in  a  very  low  horizontal  and  vertical  geometrical  standard  in  mountainous \nregions.  The  road  widths  appear  to  have  been  compromised  according  to  the  actual  terrain \nconditions,  resulting  in  many  very  narrow  roads.  While  100%  of  national  roads  and  71%  of \ndistrict  roads  were  bitumen  paved,  shoulders  are  often  constructed  out  of  impervious  earthen \nmaterial.  This,  combined  with  the  difficult  geological  conditions,  torrential  rains,  and  lack  of \nmaintenance,  has  caused  rapid  deterioration  of  the  road  system.  Only  24%  of  national  roads \nand 11% of district roads are currently in good condition. \n\nB. \n\nTraffic Volume \n\n4. \nTraffic volume is small and concentrated around Dili. Traffic counts in 2000 showed that \none  third  of  the  road  network  outside  urban  centers  carried  more  than  200  vehicles  per  day \n(with  15%  carrying  more  than  500  vehicles  per  day,  less  than  2%  carrying  more  than  1,000 \nvehicles per day). One third of the network carried less than 50 vehicles per day. Traffic counts \nconducted in 2005 suggest that the average daily traffic for motorized vehicles is about 160 on \nnational  roads,  90  on  district  roads,  30  on  rural  roads,  and  170  on  urban  roads.  The  heaviest \ntraffic flows, in excess of 400 vehicles per day, are on the northern coastal road. \n\nThe  truck  fleet  consists  almost  entirely  of  light  and  medium-sized  trucks,  due  to  the \n5. \nnarrow  winding  mountainous  roads,  which  are  hardly  passable  for  large  trucks.  The  traffic \nloading  on  the  roads  is  generally  very  light,  and  is  not  the  cause  of  the  poor  condition  of  the \nroad network. This is evidenced by the fairly good shape of the payment structure in spite of a \ndamaged and washed-out surface due to adverse weather conditions and lack of maintenance \nfor more than a decade. In addition, the roads have little rutting\u2014normally a sign of overloading.  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n35 \n\nC. \n\nTransport Services \n\n6. \nWalking  is  the  most  common  mode  of  transportation,  followed  by  small  trucks  and \nmicrobuses. Transport services are mainly provided by small-scale private companies, with one \nor  two  vehicles,  and  a  small  number  of  vehicle  owner-operators.  The  Government  has  set \nminimum  taxi  fare  rates,  but  has  not  set  rates  for  passenger  and  freight  buses  and  trucks. \nDrivers  associations  are  apparently  developing  and  setting  rates.  Passenger  fares  range  from \n$0.50 to $3.00, depending on the distance, and average approximately $1.00 per one-way trip. \nThis is high and not affordable for many rural people, particularly, the poor. On the other hand, \nthe  fares  barely  allow  vehicle  operators  to  achieve  a  decent  living  standard.  Half  of  vehicle \noperators  and  owner-operators  are  estimated  to  be  living  below  the  national  poverty  line. \nOperating costs are high, with repair costs averaging about $1,500 per year. Nearly 50% of the \ntotal repair costs are caused by the poor road conditions. \n\nD. \n\nRoad Safety \n\n7. \nRoad  fatalities  are  relatively  high  with  more  than  20  persons  per  10,000  vehicles.  A \nrecent study of available data gathered at the National Dili Hospital shows that the total number \nof patients from road traffic accidents reached 2,728 or an average of 114 patients per month in \n2002 and 2003. There were 41 deaths for the same period or an average of 2 deaths per month \nassociated with road traffic accidents. In 2003, 1,354 road traffic accident patients were treated \nat the emergency facility, accounting for 11% of all hospitalized patients in the same year. The \npotential for even greater accident rates is high, considering the increased number of vehicles, \ngrowing  population,  and  increased  vehicle  speeds  resulting  from  improvements  to  the  road \nnetwork. A national road safety strategy was prepared, but implementation has not started. \n\nE. \n\nInstitutional Framework \n\n8. \nThe  Government  has  made  great  progress  in  establishing  the  institutions  necessary  to \nrun  the  country.  In  the  road  sector,  the  Government  has  established  much  of  the  essential \nframework, including laws, institutions, and development plans. \n\n9. \nIn 2003, the Government introduced two laws to regulate and manage the road sector: \n(i) Basic Law for Vehicle Transport; and (ii) Road Code. The former covers rules and regulations \ngoverning  vehicle  registration,  road  charges,  passenger  and  freight  transport  services  and \npassenger  fares,  and  planning  and  coordination  of  public  infrastructure  provision.  The  Road \nCode  covers  road  rules,  traffic  management,  classification  and  use  of  roads,  vehicle \ncategorization, fines, vehicle emissions, accident reporting, and licensing of drivers.  \n\nThe Directorate of Roads, Bridges, and Flood Control (DRBFC) of MPW is responsible \n10. \nfor  the  provision  and  management  of  road  infrastructure.  It  operates  through  a  central \nadministration  and  five  regional  offices  (in,  Baucau,  Dili,  Maliana,  Oecussi  and  Same).  The \nDirectorate  of  Equipment  and  Materials  manages  equipment  owned  by  the  Government. \nDRBFC  has  12  staff  with  engineering  qualifications,  out  of  a  total  of  91.  Due  to  historic \ncircumstances,  DRBFC  has  a  very  limited  capacity  for  strategic  planning,  project  preparation \nand  implementation,  construction  supervision,  contract  management,  and  socioeconomic \nevaluation.  \n\nF. \n\nGovernment Vision and Strategy  \n\n11. \nThe  Government  currently  is  faced  with  managing  a  degraded  road  network,  which \nentails  a  very  high  cost  for  the  reactive  work  needed  to  keep  it  functioning.  The  Government \ntherefore has set a 10-year vision for the road system to accomplish the following: \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n12. \n\nThe Government has the following objectives for roads, bridges, and flood control: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n(ix) \n\nBring  the  road  network  up  to  a  sustainable  condition  where,  with  regular \nmaintenance,  life-cycle  costs  will  be  minimized,  road  closures  will  be  reduced \nand manageable, and road access will be reliable. \nImprove key roads to support regional connectivity and a growing economy. \nEnsure  effective  capacity  to  manage  the  road  system,  comprising  asset \nmanagement systems (including risk management), use of the private sector for \ncost-effective  delivery,  and  reliable  funding  and  adequate  cost-recovery  from \nusers. \n\ntopologies  of \n\nroads,  bridges,  and \n\nIdentify the national, district, and rural road networks essential for the support of \neconomic and social development.  \nInitiate policies within a legal and regulatory framework to improve quality of life, \nencourage  private  enterprise,  and  improve  access  and  safety  particularly  in \nimpoverished areas.  \nDevelop \nflood  control \nenvironmental protection and reverse existing ecological damage.  \nEnsure development and regulation for the safe circulation of transport.  \nEnsure transport infrastructure meets national defense imperatives, and establish \ntechnical standards for a national road network.  \nPreserve  existing  road  assets  as \nmaintenance and long-term management plans for support systems.  \nEstablish  an  institutional  structure  and  develop  technical  and  administrative \ncapacity  of  East  Timorese  staff  to  manage,  maintain,  and  improve  the  road \nnetwork.  \nImplement sustainable strategies for the maintenance of rural access roads.  \nEstablish  and  implement  erosion  control  measures  to  prevent  damage  to \nphysical \n(National \nDevelopment Plan, 2002:271). \n\ninfrastructure  and  economically \n\nthrough  sustainable \n\nvaluable  property \n\nthat  provide \n\nfirst  priority \n\nthe \n\nG. \n\nBudget Allocation for Road Maintenance \n\n13. \nAccording  to  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Finance,  the  Government  is  expecting  total \nrevenues to be above $100 million per year for an indefinite period, and total expenditures to be \nbetween  $70  million  and  $80  million  each  year.  The  Government  has  committed  about  $190 \nmillion from the budget for road maintenance during the Project\u2019s life. This will be sufficient to \ncover the maintenance cost of the project roads, which only accounts for about 5% of the total \nbudget allocation for road maintenance, or $8.8 million during 18 years after project completion. \n\nH. \n\nMain Issues and Challenges \n\nThe  Government  faces  a  number  of  challenges  with  respect  to  the  road  transport \n14. \ninfrastructure.  The  challenges  relate  mainly  to  financing  and  capacity  of  planning  and \nimplementing  capital  investment  projects.  Major  issues  include  (i)  rehabilitating  roads  in  some \nlocations,  (ii)  moving  from  a  reactive  to  a  preventive  approach  regarding  infrastructure  works, \n(iii) orienting road design standards and maintenance practices in a way to minimize life-cycle \ntransport costs, (iv) developing sustainable arrangements for managing the rural road network, \n(v) addressing social impacts and involvement, (vi) providing additional resources and skills for \nDRBFC, and (vii) increasing spending levels to maintain the current road system. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n37 \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\nA. \n\nTraffic Analysis and Projections \n\n1. \n\nExisting Traffic \n\n1. \nBased on Timor-Leste\u2019s existing vehicle fleet, the following vehicle types were adopted \nfor  the  traffic  analysis:  (i)  motorcycles;  (ii)  cars,  jeeps,  and  four-wheel  drives;  (iii)  pickups  and \nvans;  (iv)  micro  and  minibuses  (up  to  20  seats);  (v)  medium  and  large  buses  (more  than  20 \nseats); (vi) light trucks (less than 5 tons); and (vii) medium and heavy trucks (over 5 tons). \n\n2. \nTraffic  surveys  were  conducted  on  the  proposed  project  road  sections  as  a  basis  for \ndetermining  average  daily  traffic.

Generated \ntraffic would occur during the first year after rehabilitation works end. Overall, generated traffic \naccounts for 4% of total traffic after the year of opening. To ensure conservative estimates, no \ntraffic is assumed to be generated for roads that are not in very poor overall condition.  \n\n5. \n\nVolumes of traffic forecast on the project road sections are summarized in Table A9.2. \n\n                                                 \n1  International Monetary Fund medium-term outlook for Timor-Leste: 5% GDP growth per year. \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nTable A9.2: Actual and Projected Average Traffic Volume (2005\u20132024) \n(vehicles per day) \n\nRoad Segment \n\nComponent \n\n2005 \n\n2009 \n\n2014 \n\n2019 \n\n2024 \n\nA05 Jct\u2013Betulala \n \n \nA10&A12 Jct\u2013Zumalai \n \n \n\nBetulala\u2013Same \n \n \nOeleu\u2013A10&A12 Jct \n \n \n\nViqueque\u2013Uatucarbau \n \n \n \n\nNormal Traffic \nGenerated Traffic \nSubtotal \nNormal Traffic \nGenerated Traffic \nSubtotal \n\nNormal Traffic \nGenerated Traffic \nSubtotal \nNormal Traffic \nGenerated Traffic \nSubtotal \n\nNormal Traffic \nGenerated Traffic \nSubtotal \n \n\nTotal \n\n398 \n0 \n398 \n387 \n0 \n387 \n\n398 \n0 \n398 \n633 \n0 \n633 \n\n147 \n0 \n147 \n1963 \n\n502 \n50 \n552 \n489 \n49 \n538 \n\n502 \n0 \n502 \n799 \n0 \n799 \n\n186 \n0 \n186 \n2577 \n\n672 \n69 \n741 \n654 \n68 \n722 \n\n672 \n0 \n672 \n1069 \n0 \n1,069 \n\n248 \n0 \n248 \n3452 \n\n900 \n95 \n995 \n875 \n93 \n968 \n\n900 \n0 \n900 \n1431 \n0 \n1,431 \n\n332 \n0 \n332 \n4626 \n\n1,204 \n131 \n1,335 \n1,171 \n128 \n1,299 \n\n1,204 \n0 \n1,204 \n1,915 \n0 \n1,915 \n\n445 \n0 \n445 \n6198 \n\nJct = junction. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n6. \nMotorcycles and buses each make up an average of 22% of total motorized traffic.

All  benefits  and  costs  are  in  constant  2005  prices.  The  economic  prices  are \nexpressed using the world price numeraire. \n\n8. \nIn the without-project scenario, the project road sections road are assumed to receive a \nminimum of maintenance and to continue to deteriorate from average roughness of 13.5 in 2008 \nto an average of 16 in 2016. Minimum maintenance means maintenance required to prevent the \nroads from collapsing. The with-project scenario includes routine and periodic maintenance.  \n\n9. \nDuring  project  preparation,  various  mutually  exclusive  improvement  options  were \nconsidered, and the Project is based on the most cost-effective. In the with-project scenario, the \naverage level of roughness would decrease to about 4.5 in 2008 and only slightly vary thereafter \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n2. \n\nCosts \n\nto  reach  about  5.5  in  2015.  The  improvement  in  2008  reflects  that  substantial  road \nimprovements are gained through construction in 2007. \n\n \n\n \n\nProject  economic  costs  include  the  financial construction costs  of  road  improvement  in \n10. \nterms of materials, equipment, labor, and consulting services. Taxes and duties are excluded. \nCosts were divided into tradable and nontradable components. The nontradable component is \nmade  of  labor  and  represents  5%  of  costs.  To  account  for  local  unemployment  and \nunderemployment, costs for labor were adjusted by a shadow wage rate factor of 0.50 to arrive \nat the economic opportunity cost. \n\n3. \n\nBenefits \n\nBenefits  are  substantial  on  the  three  project  roads  because  they  have  relatively  high \n11. \ntraffic  levels  due  to  high  agricultural  and  business  activities,  and  because  they  are  in  overall \npoor or very poor condition. The main benefits comprise savings of vehicle operating costs and \ntime for road users, and of maintenance costs. \n\nVehicle  operating  costs  include  the  costs  of  (i)  spare  parts  replacement;  (iii)  gas  and \n12. \ndiesel;  (iv)  lubricating  oil;  (v)  maintenance  labor;  and  (vi)  crew  wages.  We  used  the  economic \ncosts for inputs to the analysis. \n\nThe  value  of  time  as  derived  in  the  economic  analysis  is  made  of  two  components:  (i) \n13. \nworking time and (ii) nonworking time. The value of working time during productive hours was \nderived  from  the  per  capita  average  income  of  $415  per  year.  A  48-hour  work  week  and  48 \nweeks of work per year were assumed. The hourly value of working time used in the analysis \nwas therefore $0.180. Nonworking value of time was estimated to be a quarter of the value of \nworking  time,  or  $0.045  per  hour.  This  conservative  assumption  is  commonly  used  to \nacknowledge  that  time  is  a  valuable  resource,  even  if  the  time  is  not  used  to  earn  income. \nThese  two  values  were  used  as  inputs  to  the  highway  design  and  management  model,  along \nwith  other  assumptions  made  on  vehicle  characteristics,  to  determine  the  value  of  time  at  a \ndisaggregated  level.  Other  vehicle  characteristics  considered  are  (i)  annual  km  driven,  (ii) \nworking  hours  per  year,  (iii)  percentage  of  private  use  of  the  vehicle,  and  (iv)  work-related \npassenger  trips.  Based  on  a  typical  day  of  8  hours  of  work  and  16  hours  of  \u201cleisure\u201d  or  other \ntime, we estimate that the daily value of time would be around $2.20. \n\nTable A9.5 shows the main benefits in terms of vehicle operating costs, as calculated by \n\n14. \nthe highway design and management model: \n\nTable A9.5: Vehicle Operating Costs by Vehicle Type \n(average for all project at end of opening year, 2008) \n($ per \u2018000 vehicle km) \n\nItem \n\nWithout Project \n\nWith Project \n\nVOC Savings \n\nJeep and 4WD \nLight Truck \nMedium and Big Bus \nMedium Truck \nMicrobus and Minibus \nMotorcycle \nPickup and Van \n\n492.1 \n373.7 \n380.1 \n592.9 \n340.0 \n50.4 \n373.5 \n\n319.4 \n272.2 \n273.6 \n446.4 \n262.2 \n38.8 \n264.7 \n\nTotal \n\n2602.7 \n\n1877.3 \n\nVOC = vehicle operating cost, 4WD = four-wheel drive. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n172.7 \n101.5 \n106.5 \n146.4 \n77.8 \n11.6 \n108.8 \n\n725.3 \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n41 \n\n15.  Maintenance  cost  savings  are  derived  from  less  investment  required  on  the  newly \nrehabilitated  roads.  A  road  improvement  project  does  not  necessarily  lead  to  a  reduction  in \nmaintenance  costs,  especially  when  without  the  project  the  road  is  not  maintained  at  all. \nHowever, the results on the priority roads project show that over the analysis period, the present \nvalue of capital cost after project implementation is smaller in the with-project scenario than with \nthe without-project scenario. \n\n \n\n4. \n\nResults of Economic Analysis \n\n16. \nUsing a 12% discount rate, the economic benefits for the infrastructure component of the \nProject are substantial. The net present value is $6.85 million and the economic internal rate of \nreturn  (EIRR)  is  24.1%.  Benefits  are  made  of  (i)  $14.68  million  decrease  in  vehicle  operating \ncosts,  and  (ii)  $0.80  million  in  time  savings.  These  benefits  more  than  compensate  for  the \nincreased  capital  and  recurrent  costs  of  $8.62  million  over  the  economic  evaluation  analysis \nperiod. Vehicle operating cost savings are by far the most important; they make up to 95% of \nthe total road user savings.

Yes \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national priority in \ncountry poverty partnership agreement?  Yes \n \n\n \n\n \n\nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste:  \n \nTimor-Leste  is  one  of  the  poorest  countries  in  the  world.  With  a  population  between  750,000  and  1  million.  Gross \ndomestic product (GDP) per capita was $405 in 2004, with more than 40% of the population living below the national \npoverty  line  of  $15.44  per  capita  per  month.  Moreover,  field  surveys  conducted  in  2005  found  that  88%  of  the \npopulation is poor and 46% are very poor, where the very poor are defined as having periods of food insecurity of 1 \nmonth  or  more  per  year.  The  literacy  rate  is  around  40%;  life  expectancy  is  57  years;  and  unemployment  is  high \nnationwide,  especially  among  the  youth.  Coupled  with  this  is  a  high  incidence  of  disease,  particularly  tuberculosis, \nmalaria,  dengue,  and  Japanese  encephalitis,  which  are  endemic.  For  every  1,000  births,  there  are  125  deaths,  and \nthe  maternal  mortality  rate  is  890  per  100,000  births.  Malnutrition  is  rife  with  3\u20134%  of  children  aged  6  months  to  5 \nyears diagnosed as acutely malnourished and 20% chronically malnourished. \n \nThe focus of the Project on the rehabilitation and maintenance of national roads matches the priorities set forth by the \nGovernment in the national development plan. The entire road network, from feeder roads to national roads, is quickly \ndeteriorating  and  impassable  at  many  points.  The  key  element  is  to  save  the  national  road  network,  and  then \nsequence improvements to district and rural feeder roads so that farmers are able to reach markets, and industries to \nchoose  locations  based  on  nontransport  factors,  such  as  availability  of  local  labor  and  natural  resources.  The  key \nobjective is to ensure connectivity between urban areas and agricultural production centers, ports, and markets. While \ncontributing to the overarching goal of poverty reduction, the rehabilitation of national roads should be complemented \nby  a  long-term  strategy  to  ensure  connectivity  between  national,  district,  and  rural  feeder  roads,  and  cost-effective \nmodalities to ensure sustainable rehabilitation and maintenance of rural feeder roads. \n \n \nB. \n \n\nPoverty Analysis                                                 Proposed Classification: General intervention \n\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nA  detailed  poverty  impact  assessment  (PIA)  and  social  analysis  were  conducted  during  the  project  preparatory \ntechnical assistance (TA). The TA consultants (i) held a stakeholder consultation workshop, key informant interviews, \nfocus  group  discussions,  and  field  surveys  to  determine  poverty  prevalence;  (ii)  conducted  distribution  analysis;  (iii) \nestimated the poverty impact ratio; (iv) developed poverty profiles and assessed the needs, demands, and absorptive \ncapacity  of  the  project-affected  groups;  and  (v)  assessed  the  gender  profiles,  with  emphasis  on  gender  division  of \nlabor and persistent gender-based discriminatory practices affecting women\u2019s effective access to the opportunities and \nbenefits provided by road rehabilitation and maintenance works. \n \nThe PIA analyzed the impact of the Project on the poor by determining the use of the roads by the poor and very poor, \nthe  competitive  conditions  of  the  road  transport  services  sector,  and  structural  constraints  that  prevent  more  of  the \nProject\u2019s  benefits  from  being  passed  on  to  the  poor.  The  PIA  also  distributed  the  economic  net  benefits  among \ndifferent  stakeholder  groups,  which  include  (i)  poor,  very  poor,  and  non-poor  passengers;  (ii)  vehicle  operators  and \nowners; (iii) freight shippers, and construction labor; and (iv) the Government. \n \nIn  general,  the  surveys  found  that  the  prevalence  of  poverty  is  highest  in  the  southwest  region.  The  majority  of  the \nproject  roads  are  in  this  region:  Oeleu\u2013Zumalai  (NR  A  12)  and  Aituto\u2013Same  (NR  A  05).  The  project  roads  in  the \nsoutheast region (Viqueque\u2013Uatucarbau, NR A 08) serve a relatively less poor area of the country, but the region is \npoor by any international standards. Malnutrition is evident in the corridors of influence in the southeast region as well. \nMoreover, the project road improvements in the southeast will reestablish connectivity of the region with the rest of the \ncountry,  thus  preventing  more  people  from  descending  into  poverty  and  hunger.  The  reestablishment  of  this \nconnectivity will allow residents of this region to have access to health care and educational services. \n \nThe social analysis analyzed the profile of local villages and villagers\u2019 perspectives on poverty and causes of poverty, \nidentified their needs and demands for socioeconomic development, and assessed the degree of their support to the \nProject and willingness to participate in the process. They identified roads as one of the main issues of concern, and \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nroad  improvement  as  being  very  important  for  their  daily  living.  Thus,  the  reactions  from  local  villagers  are \noverwhelmingly  positive;  virtually  all  respondents  expressed  their  desire  to  participate  in  the  construction  as  wage \nlabors and their willingness to carry out community maintenance activities. \n \nThe  impact  of  road  construction  on  poverty  reduction  can  be  measured  in  terms  of  (i)  anticipated  reduction  of \ntransportation  costs  to  road  passengers  and  freight  users,  (ii)  increased  benefits  to  rural  communities  in  terms  of \naccess to basic social services (education and health) and local markets, (iii) increased employment opportunities for \nunskilled  laborers  in  the  project  area,  and  (iv)  indirect  and  induced  economic  growth  in  the  project-affected  regions \nand the nation as a whole. \n \nThe estimated distribution analysis includes estimates for all of these listed quantifiable elements, but does not include \nan estimate of the benefits of improved access to health and education services; except indirectly through the induced \neffects on regional and national economies. \n \nBy far, the largest benefit comes from the economic and social development indirectly induced by the Project on the \nregional and national economies. This overall benefit to the economy is estimated to be $14 million in present value \nterms  over  the  20-year  life  of  the  Project.  Approximately  40%  of  the  total  benefits,  or  about  $5.6  million,  to  the \neconomy are likely to accrue to the poor. \n \nAt the project level, the benefits to passengers and passenger vehicle owners are estimated at $3.8 million, and the \nbenefits  to  freight  shippers  (i.e.,  users  of  freight  shipping  services,  including  small  farmers)  and  owners  of  freight \nvehicles are estimated at $ 1.6 million, all in net present value terms over the 20-year life of the Project. The poor are \nestimated to capture between 19 and 24% of the Project\u2019s economic net present value of $5.4 million. The very poor, \na subgroup of the poor, will capture between 5% and 10% of the Project\u2019s economic net present value. Further, about \n6.9 million passengers (annual total) are expected to travel on the rehabilitated project road sections for a typical year, \nsuch as 2014. Of these, about 4.2 million will be poor passengers, or 61% of the total passengers, and 1.5 million, or \n21%, very poor.1\n \nThe  direct  causality  between  road  rehabilitation  and  increased  access  to  basic  social  services  and  in  terms  of \nemployment opportunities is maximized when the rehabilitation of national roads is combined with the rehabilitation of \nadjacent  rural  feeder  roads,  resulting  in  increased  connectivity  of  rural  communities  to  the  national  road  networks. \nBased on the estimates made during the TA, a total of 62,000 people, of which 55,000 are poor and 28,000 are very \npoor,  living  in  the  corridors  of  influence  of  the  core  road  sections  to  be  rehabilitated  are  likely  to  benefit  from  the \nrehabilitation  of  the  national  roads.  In  addition,  for  the  labor-intensive  maintenance  component  for  Iliomar\u2013Lospalos \nsection of national road A08, the component is estimated to benefit an additional 12,000 people, of which 11,000 are \npoor and 6,000 very poor. The third component, community empowerment initiatives, will rehabilitate selected feeder \nroads  applying  a  community-based  labor-intensive  approach  to  connect  isolated  communities  to  one  of  the  major \nroads to be rehabilitated or maintained under the Project or to the closest social facilities such as clinics or markets. \nThis  component  will  incorporate  skills  transfer  programs  in  the  areas  of  agricultural  extension,  food  nutrition, \nreproductive  health,  and  bioengineering,  with  a  particular  emphasis  on  targeting  women  to  ensure  empowerment  of \nvulnerable groups and the community as a whole. This integrated approach\u2014connecting isolated communities to main \nroads, primary facilities, and/or markets while providing skills necessary for economic activities and raising awareness \non health issues\u2014is likely to bring significant benefits to participating communities as a whole, building upon extensive \nexperience and demonstrated success of international NGOs working in the selected districts. \n \nBoth the main road rehabilitation component and the main road maintenance component will employ local laborers to \nprovide immediate income-generating opportunities. To promote women's participation, a number of components that \nwill not require specific construction skills have been identified for employing  women, such as bioengineering, stone \nmasonry and gabion  work, cleaning of drainage, and vegetation clearing. The main road rehabilitation component is \nexpected  to  create  169  person-years  of  employment  opportunities  for  the  local  population,  and  the  labor-intensive \nmaintenance  component,  77  person-years,  of  which  approximately  70%  of  the  workers  are  expected  to  be  poor.  In \naddition, works contractors will be required to award 30% of the total wage-labor contracts to women. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1   Based on estimates in Supplementary Appendix B: Poverty Impact Assessment. \n\n\f \n\nC. \n \n\nParticipation Process \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n45 \n\n \n\n \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? Yes \n \nDuring the TA, a broad range of stakeholders were identified and consulted by the consultant team and during TA fact-\nfinding  on  many  issues,  involving  the  pros  and  cons  of  community-based,  labor-intensive  rehabilitation  and \nmaintenance; culturally-sensitive modalities to increase employment opportunities for women involved in rehabilitation \nand  maintenance;  and  ensuring  adequate  attention  to  human  immunodeficiency  virus/acquired  immunodeficiency \nsyndrome  (HIV/AIDS)  prevention  and  road  safety,  in  the  specific  context  of  Timor-Leste.  Consultations  included  a \nlarge stakeholder consultation workshop; key informant interviews at district, subdistrict, village, and hamlet levels, as \nwell  as  with  international  and  local  NGOs,  focus  group  discussions,  and  a  set  of  small-sample  surveys  of  local \nhouseholds,  passengers,  vehicle  operators,  freight  shippers,  and  shops  throughout  the  country.  The  stakeholders \nconsulted include staff from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries, who conduct community-based feeder \nroads and irrigation rehabilitation programs; the NGO Forum Timor-Leste (the umbrella organization for East Timorese \nNGOs); Rede Feto Timor-Leste (the umbrella organization for NGOs working on women's issues); major international \nNGOs  working  extensively  in  Timor-Leste  such  as  Care  International,  Caritas,  and  Oxfam  Australia;  and  East \nTimorese civil works contractors and consulting firms. Stakeholder analysis identified critical social and gender issues, \nand anticipated impacts that are reflected in the design features of the Project, and its increasing focus on ensuring \ngender-inclusive  modalities  for  road  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  and  increased  focus  on  community-based \nrehabilitation and maintenance. In all, over 600 stakeholders were consulted in the design of the Project.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy? Yes \n \nThe  local  population  is  mostly  characterized  by  unskilled,  unemployed,  and/or  underemployed  laborers,  eager  to \nsupport  the  Project.  They  have  a  strong  desire  to  benefit  as  wage  laborers  during  the  construction  phase  and  are \nwilling  to  conduct  community-based  maintenance  activities  once  the  roads  are  rehabilitated.  Project  design  features \nwill  allow  for  some  opportunities  of  interaction  and/or  consultation  with  local  communities  during  project \nimplementation  as  follows:  (i)  interaction  with  local  communities  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  HIV/AIDS \nprevention,  reproductive  health,  and  road  safety  programs  along  the  project  roads;  (ii)  labor-intensive  community-\nbased maintenance of the national road for Iliomar\u2013Lospalos section of national road A08; and (iii) consultation  with \nlocal  communities  on  the  selection  of  rural  feeder  roads  to  be  rehabilitated  under  component  three,  and  in  the \nestablishment  of  cost-effective  and  gender-inclusive  modalities  of  maintenance  of  selected  rural  feeder  road  to  be \nfunded under the Project. \n \n\nGender and Development \n\nD. \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nTraditional  gender  division  of  labor  can  be  challenged  by  proactively  ensuring  women\u2019s  involvement  in  road \nrehabilitation  and  maintenance  in  a  culturally  sensitive  manner.  Areas  identified  by  local  constructors  and  surveyed \ncommunities for additional involvement of women include support services to construction camps and bioengineering. \nWomen\u2019s effective access to these employment opportunities will require targeted programs of labor skills transfer. In \nlight  of  women\u2019s  traditional  exclusion  from  the  employment  opportunities  and  benefits  associated  with  road \nconstruction,  the  TA  will  support  socioculturally  sensitive  modalities  to  ensure  women\u2019s  involvement  in  road \nrehabilitation and maintenance through the adoption of employment quotas. MPW, through the PMU, will require civil \nworks contractors to increase the percentage of women workers to 30% of wage-laborers (including at least 75% for \nbioengineering  activities).  Community  empowerment  initiatives  for  sustainable  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  of \nselected rural feeder roads (component three) will have a strong gender focus and include (i) participatory and gender-\ninclusive  identification  and  selection  of  rural  feeder  roads  to  be  rehabilitated  under  the  Project;  (ii)  skills  transfer  to \nwomen  in  bioengineering,  agroforestry,  and  agricultural  extension,  combined  with  literacy,  nutrition,  reproductive \nhealth, and HIV/AIDS prevention; and (iii) design of gender-inclusive modalities to ensure sustainable maintenance of \nrehabilitated feeder roads. The international NGO to be recruited under the community empowerment component will \nbe responsible for monitoring implementation of the HIV/AIDS employment targets for women under the Project. \n \nHas an output been prepared?

The  SIEE  summarizes  the  findings  of \nthe initial environmental  examination (IEE) regarding the potential impacts of the Project, their \nmagnitude  and  duration,  and  potentially  affected  groups.  Mitigation  measures  are  prescribed \nand  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  has  been  prepared  as  an  appendix  to  the  full \nIEE.  The  Project  will  comply  with  the  environmental  provisions  of  both  ADB  and  the \nGovernment.  The  IEE  procedure  follows  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Policy  and \nguiding  framework  (2003  and  later  revisions)  and  the  Government\u2019s  Guideline  No.2a \n(Development Proposal and Pollution License Applications) of 2002. The IEE was submitted to \nthe Government in July 2005 and was approved on 23 August 2005.   \n\nB. \n\nDescription of the Project \n\n2. \nThe Project is a component of a 10-year road sector investment master plan and will be \nfinanced  by  a  grant  of  $10  million  from  ADB  and  a  contribution  of  $2.5  million  from  the \nGovernment. The environmental classification of the Project is category B.  \n\n3. \nThe road network is in poor to very poor condition and is continuously facing problems \nwith landslide-prone sections as well as rapid deterioration of the pavement during each rainy \nseason.  The  poor  roads  gravely  limit  transport  opportunities  to  such  an  extent  that  large \nproportions  of  the  population  have  limited  or  no  access  to  basic  social  services  and  markets. \nEven from a macro perspective, connectivity is limited. Not single, fairly good all-weather road \nconnects the north coast with the capital and export harbor in Dili, to the south coast with its rich \nagricultural potential. Two of the four project roads are connecting roads from the south to the \nnorth.  \n\n4. \nThe  Project  will  produce  the  following  outputs:  (i)  rehabilitation  and  improvement  of \nabout 123 kilometers (km) of core network roads; (ii) labor-intensive routine road maintenance \nfor  45  km;  (iii) sound  and  sustainable  road  maintenance  policies;  (iv)  an  efficient  bidding  and \ncontracting  system  for  engaging  communities  in  road  maintenance  through  local  small \ncontractors; \n(vi) \nidentification  of  modalities  to  ensure  community-based,  gender-inclusive  rehabilitation  and \nmaintenance of rural feeder roads. Project activities include \n\n(v) improved  project  management,  supervision,  and  monitoring,  and \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nrehabilitation  of  three  road  sections  to  fair  conditions:  (a)  Oeleu\u2013Zumalai \n(35.9 km), (b) Aituto\u2013Same (30.8 km), and (c) Viqueque\u2013Uatucarbau (55.8 km), \nby  strengthening  the  base,  resurfacing,  protecting  and  stabilizing  slopes,  and \nimproving drainage system and shoulders; \nroutine  maintenance  for  Iliomar\u2013Lospalos  (45  km),  to  be  implemented  by  small \nlocal contractors using labor-intensive methods, and include patching, improving \nside  drains,  repairing  culverts,  improving  shoulders,  constructing  lined  drains, \nand bioengineering;1\n\n                                                 \n1  Bioengineering is the use of vegetation, terracing, and construction of efficient drainage systems to stabilize road \nembankments  and slopes. The purpose of the vegetation is to minimize  water penetration into the ground layers \nand to reduce the risk of erosion of the surface soils to ensure long-term sustainability of the roads. Bioengineering \nincludes tree planting with deep-rooted species to reduce the risk of shallow slides and debris flow. \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nfor  project  management, \ninternational  and  domestic  consulting  services \nconstruction  supervision,  establishment  of  road  maintenance  policies,  road \nmaintenance  training  and  supervision,  and  socioeconomic  impact  monitoring; \nand  \ncommunity  empowerment  initiatives,  including  (a)  identification  of  community-\nbased and gender-inclusive modalities for rehabilitation and maintenance of rural \nfeeder  roads  adjacent  to  the  project  roads;  (b)  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  road \nsafety  awareness  programs  along  the  project  roads  to  be  implemented  by  an \ninternational  NGO  with  expertise  in  community-based  and  labor-intensive \ninfrastructure development and service delivery in one selected subdistrict along \nthe project roads; and (c) monitoring of employment targets for women.  \n\nC. \n\n \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n1. \n\nPhysical Resources \n\n5. \nTimor-Leste comprised the eastern end of the island of Timor, plus the enclave territory \nof  Oecusi  and  the  islands  of  Atauro  and  Jaco;  this  amounts  to  a  land  area  of  about  14,609 \nsquare  kilometers.  Timor  is  the  easternmost  of  the  Lesser  Sunda  islands,  lying  from  8\u201310 \ndegrees south of the equator and about 500 km north of Australia.2 The country has a dramatic \nand  mountainous  topography,  dominated  by  the  Ramelau  Mountains  stretching  across  the \nmiddle of the island from the eastern to the western tip.  \n\n6. \nThe island is unique among the major islands of the Sunda archipelago in that it is not of \nvolcanic  origin,  but  is  a  continental  fragment,  composed  largely  of  limestone  and  other \nsedimentary  deposits.  The  island  is  geologically  young,  with  steep  and  unstable  slopes  and \ndeep valleys, prone to flash floods. More than 40% of the land area is estimated to have a slope \nof greater than 40%3. The steep topography and torrential rains result in thin and unstable soils, \nwith  low  water-holding  capacity  (footnote  2).  Occasionally  deeper  soils  may  be  found  on  the \ncoastal and inland plains.  \n\n7. \nThe  climate  is  hot  and  humid  tropical,  with  large  variations  in  rainfall  and  temperature \nover  short  distances  due  to  the  steep  topography.  Broadly  speaking  two  annual  seasons  are \ndetermined  by  the  monsoon,  which  varies  in  length  according  to  location.  Timor-Leste  is \nsignificantly drier than the other islands in the archipelago. The Ramelau Mountain ridge forms \nthe main watershed in the country and is the source of all major streams. Even with more than \n100 rivers, surface water is scarce, as most rivers are not perennial. The country has only one \nlake of significant size (Iralalaru lake in the east). Most water for domestic and agricultural use is \nobtained from streams and springs, with the exception of the eastern part of the country, where \nwells are fairly common.  \n\n8. \nBaseline  data  for  air  or  water  quality  is  lacking.  Given  that  the  country  is  very \nunderdeveloped with almost no industrial infrastructure and very little vehicular traffic, air quality \ncan be expected to be good overall. Despite the generally sparse traffic, vehicular emissions in \nurban  areas  may  sometimes  produce  significant  levels  of  pollution.  The  other  major  source  of \nair pollution is smoke from the burning of wood as a cooking fuel.  \n\nThe  country  has  few  water-polluting  industries;  the  processing  of  coffee  beans  is  the \n9. \nmajor  industrial  pollution  source.  Domestic  sewage  and  waste,  domesticated  animals,  and \nsedimentation  due  to  soil  erosion  are  the  main  causes  of  water  pollution  overall.  The  country \n                                                 \n2  Sandlund,  Odd  Terje,  et  al.  2001.

Water \nquality is now threatened by high levels of erosion and the increasing amount of domestic waste \ndischarged untreated into the environment. \n\n10. \nProvided the environmental management plan (EMP) is followed, the Project is expected \nto have minor and short-term adverse impacts on the physical environment during construction. \nSome  soil  erosion  and  sedimentation  of  surface  waters  will  be  unavoidable  as  the  result  of \nearth-moving  activities.  Dry  river  beds  will  be  used  for  the  extraction  of  sand  and  gravel,  and \nsome upland sites may be required for the quarrying of building materials. The EMP prescribes \nmeasures to avoid or mitigate each of these impacts. \n\n11. \nThe bioengineering measures of the Project (such as terracing, construction of efficient \ndrains, and planting of native species) will provide long-term beneficial effects by reducing soil \nerosion and sedimentation of surface waters. The frequency and intensity of landslides near the \nproject roads will be significantly reduced. \n\n2. \n\nEcological Resources \n\nSince  Timor-Leste  is  an  island,  fisheries  and  other  marine  resources  constitute  an \n12. \nimportant  segment  of  the  natural  environment.  Overall,  the  marine  and  coastal  environments \nappear to be more intact here than on most other islands in the region. Overexploitation of the \nresource in general, and overfishing by commercial interests in particular, are not identified as \nproblems at this point. Since the Project is not anticipated to impact the marine resources, these \nresources are not discussed in detail here. \n\n13. \nTimor-Leste is situated east of the Wallace line and, therefore, has biological elements \nof both Asian and Australian origin. This creates the potential for unique species. However, no \nup-to-date information is available on the number or location of remaining native species, with a \nfew exceptions regarding bird species. Nearly 200 species of mammals have been identified on \nthe island, but their status today is poorly known. Much of the wildlife commonly seen today is \nferal domestics, such as cattle, buffalo, donkeys, and pigs. Native wildlife can only be seen in \nthe  more  isolated  forest  areas  (for  example,  deer,  monkeys,  civets,  cuscus,  and  a  variety  of \nbat). Reptiles are very poorly described. Cobras, pythons, and crocodiles are said to inhabit the \nisland, but nothing is known of their number or distribution (footnote 3). Both hunting and trading \nin  protected  species  are  prohibited  under  United  Nations  regulations,  but  both  practices  were \nobserved during the project surveys. The Project will not affect any protected natural areas or \necologically isolated habitats, and no impacts are anticipated on native wildlife.  \n\nNumerous primary and secondary documentary sources describe massive deforestation \n14. \nin  recent  years,  and  this  was  confirmed  by  the  environmental  field  surveys.  Estimates  of \nclearing  range  as  high  as  90%  of  the  original  forest  cover.  Today  the  dominant  vegetation \nacross  the  island  and  within  the  project  area  is  savannah/grassland,  interspersed  with  shrubs \nand  occasional  stands  of  trees.  Most  lands  show  evidence  of  clearing  and  significant \ndisturbance by  human  activities,  especially  slash-and-burn  cultivation,  and  coffee  growing  and \ngrazing,  even  on  steep  slopes.  In  the  one  project  area  where  sizable  stands  of  forest  were \nobserved (Road A08 Lospalos), the forest was definitely secondary rather than primary.  \n\nBy far the most common ecosystems on the island are the grasslands and what Carter \n15. \nterms  \u201cregrowth  communities.\u201d  Regrowth  communities  occur  throughout  landscapes  that  have \nbeen disturbed by slash-and-burn agriculture and by other rural land-clearing activities. \u201cWhere \nleft  unattended,  regrowth  communities  range  from  simple  herbaceous  communities  to  areas \nwith scattered bamboo, casuarinas, and eucalypts, and structurally more complex communities \nthat include dense formations of shrubs, small trees, and creepers\u201d (footnote 3). Field surveys \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nshow  that  most  of  the  project  area  is  covered  in  either  grassland  or  these  regrowth \ncommunities, the exception being the secondary forests around Lospalos. \n\n16. \nDue to the highly disturbed condition of the environment in most of the project area, no \nsignificant danger of adverse impacts to threatened or endangered species of plants or animals \nis  likely.  Project  road  A08  passes  through  a  stretch  of  secondary  forest  in  the  vicinity  of \nLospalos; however, no general tree cutting will occur, and the EMP will limit all project activities \nin this area to the existing right-of-way. These measures will provide adequate protection for the \nforest environment.  \n\n17. \nThe  island  has  15  protected  natural  areas  (PNAs).  The  PNAs  have  not  yet  been \nsystematically  surveyed  due  to  the  Government\u2019s  lack  of  personnel  and  funds.  Formal \nboundaries  have  not  been  established.  A  table  listing  the  PNAs  and  a  map  showing  their \napproximate locations is included in the IEE. The project roads will not affect any PNAs.  \n\n3. \n\nEconomic Development \n\n18. \nThe  population  of  Timor-Leste  ranges  from  750,000  to  1,000,000  and  is  young,  with  a \nmedian  age  of  20  years.  Life  expectancy  at  birth  is  57  years,  well  below  the  average  for  east \nAsian  and  Pacific  island  countries.  The  population  is  predominately  rural  (75%).  Timor-Leste \nhas  one  of  the  least-developed  economies  in  the  region.  The  UNDP  Human  Development \nIndex4  places  Timor-Leste  in  the  low  human  development  category,  ranking  158  among  177 \ncountries.  \n\n19. \nIn late 1999, about 70% of the economic infrastructure of Timor-Leste was laid to waste \nby  Indonesian  troops  and  anti-independence  militias;  260,000  people  fled  westward.  Over  the \nnext 3 years, a massive international program, staffed by 5,000 peacekeepers (8,000 at peak) \nand 1,300 police officers, led to substantial reconstruction in both urban and rural areas. By mid-\n2002,  all  but  about  50,000  of  the  refugees  had  returned.  Growth,  however,  was  held  back  in \n2003 by extensive drought and the gradual winding down of the international presence. \n\n20. \nAs yet, no infrastructure supports tourism and virtually no industry exists. The agriculture \nsector is weak due to recently deficient monsoons, an inequitable land tenure system, and lack \nof education and training for farmers. Since roads provide the dominant form of transportation, \nthe  lack  of  a  serviceable  road  infrastructure  contributes  significantly  to  the  prevalence  of \npoverty.  \n\nThe  Project\u2019s  poverty  impact  and  social  analyses  provide  a  detailed  description  of \n\n21. \nhuman and economic development, based on extensive field work.  \n\n4. \n\nSocial and Cultural Resources \n\n22. \nTimor-Leste is one of the poorest countries in the world. Project fieldwork indicates that \nas much as 88% of the population are poor, 46% are very poor. The improved roads that will \nresult from the Project will benefit about 62,000 people. Of these, 55,000 are poor, and 28,000 \nare  very  poor.  More  detailed  information  on  socioeconomic  values,  public  health,  cultural \nvalues,  and  quality  of  life  values  are  provided  in  the  Project\u2019s  poverty  impact  and  social \nanalyses. No indigenous peoples live in the country.  \n\n23. \nAs yet, no official listing is available for historical and archaeological sites, although the \nGovernment has plans to undertake a survey when possible. Within the project area no sites of \nclearly archaeological or historical significance were noted. \n\n                                                 \n4  UNDP. 2004. Human Development Report. United States. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n51 \n\nNumerous  settlements,  from  hamlets  to  large  villages,  plus  scattered  habitations  are \n24. \nlocated along the project roads. In the villages a small number of houses are located very close \nto the project roads, but still outside the right-of-way. Encroachments onto the right-of-way were \nnot encountered. Generally, kitchen gardens are placed between houses and the roads.  \n\nNo adverse impacts will occur to dwellings due to loss of land or relocation, because all \n25. \nroads  will  be  rehabilitated  within  the  existing  right-of-way.  Short-term  adverse  impacts  are \nassociated with project construction: increased noise, vibration and dust, plus the inconvenience \nof traffic delays. These impacts will be mitigated as prescribed in the EMP. \n\nD. \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n26. \nOverall, the Project\u2019s beneficial impacts to people and the environment will substantially \noutweigh  the  adverse  impacts,  provided  that  best  engineering  practices  are  followed  and  the \nEMP is effectively implemented. Impacts on environmental, cultural, and human resources are \nidentified in the respective sections of this SIEE. Those impacts are summarized here.  \n\n27. \nErosion  of  soil  and  sedimentation  of  waterways  are  two  of  the  most  pervasive  impacts \nfrom  road  rehabilitation  projects.  Sediment  deposition  and  suspension  in  water  courses  have \ndirect, negative impacts on water quality and aquatic ecosystems. Soil loss and redeposit can \nalso adversely affect residential and agricultural properties. A related set of impacts are loss of \nnative vegetation and the opening of habitats to the invasion of weeds. These impacts can be \nsubstantially  mitigated  or  avoided  altogether  by  implementing  engineering  best  practices  and \nbioengineering.  Restricting  earth-moving  and  clearing  activities  to  the  dry  season  will  likewise \ngreatly reduce the potential adverse impacts of road rehabilitation. \n\nThe  potential  reduction  in  water  quality  is  a  concern.  Prevention  of  erosion  and  proper \n28. \nhandling of sediment will largely prevent any reduction in water quality due to added sediment \nload. Proper storage, handling, and disposal of potential contaminants (such as fuels, lubricants, \nand  solvents)  will  generally  provide  adequate  protection  of  water  quality  from  these  potential \nsources  of  contamination.  The  waste  and  runoff  from  encampments  must  also  be  handled  in \naccordance with the EMP to prevent adverse impacts on water quality. \n\n29. \nQuarrying  and  extraction  of  construction  materials  must  be  strictly  regulated  in \naccordance  with  Government  guidelines  and  the  EMP,  to  avoid  such  adverse  impacts  as \nreduced  water  quality,  destruction  of  aesthetic  values,  and  creation  of  a  long-term  safety \nhazard.  \n\n30. \nThe  siting  of  encampments  will  be  a  critical  issue.  Encampments  must  be  situated  so \nthat  they  do  not  seriously  degrade  the  natural  or  social  environment.  Waste  and  effluent  from \nencampments must be contained and disposed of safely, away from water courses, wells, and \ndwellings. \n\nDisruption  and  delay  of  traffic  plus  the  generation  of  noise,  vibration,  and  dust  are \n31. \nimpacts  that  will  be  particularly  noticeable  to  the  local  population.  Asphalt  mixing  plants  may \nproduce a significant amount of air pollution. These impacts cannot be entirely avoided, as they \nare part of the nature of a construction project. However, they are temporary and can be greatly \nmitigated  through  proper  planning  and  scheduling,  proper  maintenance  of  equipment,  and \nfollowing the EMP.  \n\n32. \nThe majority of potentially adverse impacts are temporary and will cease with the end of \nproject  construction.  Provided  that  proper  maintenance  is  given  to  the  roads  throughout  their \noperational life, no significant adverse impacts will result from the existence and operation of the \nroads themselves. Maintenance activities will produce minor impacts, but these are manageable \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nthrough  a  continuation  of  the  engineering  practices  and  mitigation  measures  specified  by  the \nEMP.  \n\n33. \nThe  anticipated  beneficial  effects  of  the  Project  will  be  long  term  and  will  continue \nthroughout the life of the project roads. The installation of proper drainage structures, coupled \nwith the planned bioengineering features (such as planting of native species and erosion control \nmeasures), will greatly reduce the risk of landslides on the roads, thus improving traffic safety. \nThese  features  will  also  help  protect  habitations  and  agricultural  lands  from  excessive  runoff \nand sedimentation. Water quality will be protected and will  be improved relative to the current \ncondition.  Driving  times  and  costs  will  be  reduced,  while  access  to  markets  and  essential \nservices will be greatly improved. \n\nE. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring \n\n1. \n\nInstitutional Requirements \n\n34. \nAs  the  project  proponent,  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  has  ultimate  responsibility  for \nobtaining  all  the  required  approvals  from  the  Government  (Ministry  of  Development  and \nEnvironment),  for  ensuring  compliance  with  the  EMP,  and  for  complying  with  local  public \ndisclosure \nthese \nresponsibilities.  \n\nrequirements.  The  Project  Management  Unit \n\n(PMU)  will  manage \n\nCurrent and anticipated near-term staffing levels of the PMU will not permit the PMU to \n35. \nassign a senior manager to oversee the environmental requirements of the Project. Therefore, \nthe services of a qualified international environmental inspector must be obtained. He or she will \nbe a member of the construction supervision consultant\u2019s team. Construction contractors should \nalso be required to retain environmental specialists to oversee compliance with their respective \nparts of the EMP and to serve as direct liaisons with the international environmental inspector. \nThe requirements to obtain the needed personnel and to comply with the EMP will be made part \nof the bidding documents. \n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental Monitoring Plan \n\n36. \nThe  provisions  of  the  EMP  are  designed  to  avoid  adverse  environmental  impacts \nwherever  possible  and  to  mitigate  adverse  effects  to  an  acceptable  level  where  complete \navoidance is not feasible. Enforcement of the EMP will be the responsibility of the international \nenvironmental inspector, acting on behalf of the PMU. The international inspector will work with \nthe  respective  contractors\u2019  environmental  specialists  and  will  have  direct  access  to  the  PMU \nmanager to resolve problems.  \n\n37. \nThe  EMP  requires  routine  monitoring  of  air  and  water  quality,  noise  levels,  and  waste \nmanagement  throughout  the  construction  phase  of  the  Project.  Sampling  locations  and \nfrequencies are designed to ensure that no significant degradations of quality of life indicators \noccur,  especially  near  population  centers.  Proper  selection  and  prior  approval  will  be  required \nfor  the  location  of  staging  areas,  encampments,  and  building  materials  extraction  sites.  Earth-\nmoving  activities  will  be  restricted  to  the  dry  season  to  minimize  siltation.  The  movement  of \nconstruction-related vehicles will be routinely monitored to minimize disturbance to vegetation, \nand cleared areas will be reseeded promptly. \n\nF. \n\nPublic Information and Information Disclosure \n\nThe  first  public  consultation  was  held  at  the  ADB-World  Bank  Conference  Room  on \n38. \n7 March  2005.  Over  50  participants  from  various  government  departments,  international  and \nnational  NGO  members,  officers  from  international  development  agencies,  and  some  district \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n53 \n\nadministrators  attended.  The  participants  were  actively  involved  in  discussions  related  to \npoverty reduction, the Project\u2019s goals, and environmental issues.  \n\n39. \n\nIn addition, the following government agencies were consulted:  \n(i) \n\nMinistry  of  Development  and  Environment,  Directorate  of  Environmental \nServices, to obtain information on the institutional laws and guidelines applied in \nroad rehabilitation and improvement projects;  \nMinistry  of  Agriculture,  Fisheries  and  Forestry,  Division  of  Forestry,  to  obtain \ninformation on environmental PNAs and other sensitive environmental resources; \nand \nMinistry  of  Transport,  Communication  and  Public  Works;  Division  of  Road, \nBridges, and Flood Control, to discuss the capabilities of that agency to manage \nthe environmental requirements of the Project.  \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n40. \nAbout  50  local  stakeholders  were  consulted  and  informed  during  field  visits  to  project \nroads. They stated that road deterioration is mainly caused by poor drainage maintenance and \ntoo  few  culverts  and  bridges.  These  informants  expressed  a  desire  to  be  consulted  in  the \nplanning process for road rehabilitation.   \n\n41. \nStakeholder consultations are critical for obtaining understanding of and support for the \nProjects,  and  serve  as  an  important  source  of  information.  Therefore,  the  project  team  will \ncontinue  to  consult  with  various  stakeholder  groups  throughout  the  course  of  project \nimplementation in addition to holding another large-scale consultation workshop. \n\n42. \nInformation contained in the IEE, SIEE, and related studies will be disseminated to the \npublic and made available for public comment and participation as prescribed by the applicable \nguidelines  of  the  Government,  Ministry  of  Development  and  Environment.  At  a  minimum, \ngovernment  regulations  require  that  public  notices  of  the  proposed  actions  be  widely \ndisseminated and that members of the affected public be given at least 30 days to comment on \nthe proposals. \n\nG. \n\nFindings, Recommendations, and Conclusion \n\n43. \nThe three project roads were surveyed by a team of environmental specialists. There is \nno  undisturbed  habitat  in  the  project  impact  area.  Road  A08  between  Iliomar  and  Lospalos \npasses through secondary forest. Within the forest, no general tree cutting will occur; selected \ntrees  will  be  removed  only  where  absolutely  necessary  to  maintain  safety  standards  for  the \nroad.  Provided  the  requirements  of  the  EMP  are  met,  to  mitigate  potentially  adverse  impacts \nduring  project  construction,  no  significant  or  long-term  impacts  will  be  made  on  the  forested \narea,  and  no  additional  or  special  studies  are  needed.  A  replanting  program  will  replace  cut \ntrees. The Project will not affect any PNAs or registered cultural/historical sites.  \n\n44. \nOverall,  the  project  area  has  been  subjected  to  long-term,  intense  agricultural  and \ngrazing  activities.  The  lands  in  the  vicinity  of  the  project  roads  have  been  heavily  disturbed. \nSlash-and-burn  agricultural  techniques  and  the  grazing  of  domesticated  animals  are  common \nthroughout the project area. Many areas are nearly devoid of vegetation cover from overgrazing. \nThis environment is dominated by introduced or weedy species of plants and by domesticated \nspecies of animals, and is generally not able to support native fauna species. No known species \nof endangered plants or animals are found in the project area. \n\n45. \nResidential areas are found along all three project roads. No habitations are within the \nexisting right-of-way, and no involuntary relocation of residents is required. Short-term adverse \nimpacts on habitations during project construction are primarily noise, vibration, and increased \ndust.  Careful  adherence  to  the  specifications  of  the  EMP  will  adequately  mitigate  these \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nconstruction-related  impacts.  The  Project  will  have  no  long-term  adverse  impacts  on  the  local \nsociety  and  no  negative  implications  for  vulnerable  groups.  No  minority  ethnic  groups  or \nindigenous population groups live in the project area.   \n\n46. \nThe  construction  of  improved  drainage  structures,  stabilization  of  slopes,  replanting  of \nthe right-of-way with a proper mix of native species, and other similar measures undertaken by \nthe  Project  will  have  long-term  beneficial  effects  on  the  environment.  The  frequency  and \nseverity of landslides will be reduced along the project roads. The replanting of trees and native \nvegetation will stabilize the landscape, may help improve water quality, and will enhance scenic \nbeauty. The greatly improved ability of the population to move from place to place and to access \nmuch-needed  social  services  will  be  a  substantial  and  long-term  enhancement.  The  overall, \nlong-term effect of the Project on society will be to generate employment and improve access to \nmarkets  and  social  services.  The  potential  for  economic  growth  and  income-generating \nopportunities,  expected  impact  on  poverty  reduction,  and  enhanced  overall  connectivity  of  the \ncore road network will promote sustainable economic and social growth.  \n\n47. \nThe  findings  of  the  IEE  confirm  that  this  Project  be  designated  as  ADB  environmental \ncategory  B.  Therefore,  no  additional  environmental  investigations  are  required.  The  report \nrecommends that (i) the Project proceed as proposed in the accompanying reports and that the \nrequirements  of  the  EMP  be  incorporated  into  all  subsequent  project  activities  and  contract \nbidding  documents,  and  (ii)  the  construction  supervision  contractor  be  required  to  retain  the \nservices of a qualified international environmental inspector. The environmental inspector must \nreport  directly  to  the  construction  supervision  contractor  and  will  serve  as  the  single  point  of \ncontact  between  the  Ministry  of  Development  and  Environment,  the  construction  supervision \ncontractor, and the individual construction contractors.  \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENT \n \nTimor-Leste uses the US dollar as its currency \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "Asian Development Bank \n", "Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental management plan \nEuropean Union \ngross domestic product \nhuman immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome \ninitial environmental examination \nkilometer \nlocal competitive bidding \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013  Directorate of Roads, Bridges, and Flood Control \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n_ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Ministry of Health \n\u2013  Ministry of Public Works \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  United Nations \n", "nongovernment organization \npoverty impact assessment \nproject management unit \nprotected national area \nsummary initial environmental examination \nsexually transmitted infection \ntechnical assistance \n", "NOTE \n", "The fiscal year of the Government ends on 30 June \n", " \nADB \nDRBFC \nEIRP \nEIRR \nEMP \nEU \nGDP \nHIV/AIDS \nIEE \nkm \nLCB \nMOH \nMPW \nNGO \nPIA \nPMU \nPNA \nSIEE \nSTI \nTA \nUN \n \n \n", " \n \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "This report was prepared by M.
