The program is aligned \nwith  the  government\u2019s  Seventh  Five-Year  National  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan \nthe  establishment  of  an  accountable,  effective, \n(NSEDP7),  2011\u20132015,  which  makes \ntransparent,  and  responsive  public  administration  to  strengthen  service  delivery  a  key \ndevelopment objective.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nGross domestic product (GDP) growth in the Lao PDR has been steady since 2010 and \n2. \naveraged  8%  during  2010\u20132013  largely  due  to  relatively  accommodative  macroeconomic \nenvironment that was supported by a resource boom, rapid credit expansion, and robust foreign \ndirect  investment  inflows,  particularly  in  the  hydropower  and  mining  sectors.  This  growth  is \nexpected to moderate to 7.3% in 2014 and 7.4% in 2015. While the proportion of the population \nliving below the poverty line declined from 27.6% in 2008 to 22.9% in 2012 and progress toward \nachieving  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  also  accelerated,  the  country  still  faces \nsignificant  challenges  in  delivering  efficient  and  equitable  education  and  health  outcomes. \nDespite  an  increased  spending  on  education  and  health  services  during  2012\u20132014,  budget \nresources  are  grossly  inadequate  when  compared  with  the  needs  identified  in  sector \ndevelopment plans.3 This is largely due to rising fiscal pressures: budget deficit rose from 1.5% \nof GDP in FY2012 to 5.8% of GDP in FY2013,4 but is expected to go down to 4.2% of GDP in \nFY2014  and  4.4%  of  GDP  in  FY2015. 5  In  addition  to  the  growing  public  sector  resource \nconstraint, inadequate public sector management (PSM) systems and capacity, especially at the \nlocal  government  level,  also  greatly  lower  the  effectiveness  and  quality  of  delivery  of  public \nservices in general and in delivery of pro-poor programs in particular.6 \n \n3. \nThe government views a well-functioning public financial management (PFM) system as \na  critical  fundamental  for  ensuring  fiscal  discipline,  spending  efficiency,  and  macroeconomic \nstability.  The  NSEDP7  emphasizes  the  clear  link  between  good  governance  and  broader \n\n                                                \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 Government of the Lao PDR (Ministry of Planning and Investment). 2011.  The Seventh Five-Year National Socio-\n\nEconomic Development Plan (2011\u20132015). Vientiane. \n\n3 In 2012, the National Assembly passed a resolution mandating the government to allocate 9% of total spending to \n\nthe health sector and 17% of total spending to the education sector during the FY2013. \n\n4 The  wage-bill-to-GDP  ratio  rose  from  5%  in  FY2012  to  9.5%  in  FY2013  due  to  large  increases  in  civil  service \nwages, including provision of a monthly allowance, as well as an increase in the number of public employees. To \ntame  fiscal  pressures,  the  government  cancelled  a  cost-of-living  allowance  for  the  civil  service  in  FY2014  and \npostponed some infrastructure projects. The government has stopped a third hike in civil service wages planned for \nFY2015 and has directed banks to curb lending for public infrastructure. Spending on new projects is expected to \nremain constrained for several more years. \n\n5   Estimates  of  budget  deficit  in  FY2014  and  FY2015  are  from  the  IMF\u2019s  preliminary  conclusions  of  the  Article  IV \n\nmission, 26 October 2014. \n\n6  Poor public service delivery has also affected gender equality: of 151 countries on the 2014 gender inequality index \nof  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP),  the  Lao  PDR  was  ranked  118th.

New \nYork. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n \n\ndevelopment  effectiveness.  The  draft  strategic  plan  on  governance  for  2011\u20132020,  prepared \nwith  support  of  UNDP,  aims  to  make  the  state  function  more  efficiently  by  improving  people\u2019s \nparticipation,  public  service  delivery,  the rule of  law,  and  PFM.7 The  National  Governance  and \nPublic  Administration  Reform  Program  (NGPARP)  for  2011\u20132015,  which  builds  on  the  draft \nstrategic plan on governance, seeks to ensure the foundations of an effective, accountable, and \nresponsive public administration. The midterm review of the NSEDP7 in 2013 identified several \npriority  actions  and  measures  needed  to  strengthen  public  sector  governance  reforms  and \nsustain  them  during  the  next  national  socioeconomic  development  plan  period  in  2016\u20132020. \nThe  GCDPSMP,  which  was  approved  in  September  2012,  supports  government\u2019s  reforms  in \npublic financial  management  and  public administration  during  2010\u20132014  in an  integrated  and \ncoordinated manner within the NGPARP framework.8 \n \nThe  pace  of  PSM  reforms  has  been  influenced  by  the  implementation  of  the \n4. \ngovernment\u2019s  overarching  public  sector  reform\u2014the  Sam  Sang  initiative.  It  was  launched  in \n2012  on  a  pilot  basis  that  covers  all  17  of  the  country\u2019s  provinces,  51  districts,  and  108  focal \nvillages  nationwide  and  aims  to  empower  provinces,  districts,  and  villages  to  make  public \nservice  delivery  more  effective  and  efficient.9 Government  evaluation  of  the  Sam  Sang  pilot \ninitiative  is  expected  to  be  completed  in  late  2014.  Overall,  the  Sam  Sang  initiative \nimplementation  is  expected  to  sustain  reforms  supported  under  the  GCDPSMP,  such  as \nadequate  spending  on  health  and  education,  new \ntransfer \narrangements, and strengthening of the civil service capacity building framework. \n \n5. \nIn parallel, the government continues to facilitate a gradual transition to a private sector-\nled market economy. It aims to increase domestic and foreign direct investment, particularly in \nthe agriculture, education, and health sectors. The goals are to achieve GDP growth of at least \n8%  annually  over  the  medium  term  and  address  the  financing  gap  under  NSEDP7.  The \ncountry\u2019s  accession  to  the  World  Trade  Organization  in  February  2013  was  particularly \nimportant to this effort, since this will allow the Lao PDR to build on and accelerate trade-related \nPSM  reforms.  These  reforms  will  help  diversify  the  country\u2019s  exports  and  spur  investment  in \nmanufacturing  that  can  gradually  shift  trade  and  investment  flows  from  their  current \nconcentration in the natural resource sector. The World Bank\u2019s Doing Business shows business \nenvironment improvement in such areas as strengthening legal rights of borrowers, lenders, and \nminority  investors.10 The  Lao  PDR  is  also  positioned  well  to  benefit  from  the  growing  global \ntrend of South\u2013South investment. The government is committed to the goal of graduating from \nthe least developed country status by 2020. \n \nADB\u2019s  support.

In addition, the implementation of several \nADB  education  and  health  projects  has  strengthened  the  capacity  for  budget  planning  and \nbudget  execution  in  these  sectors.13 The  GCDPSMP,  including  subprogram  2,  builds  on  this \nearlier work. ADB collaborates closely with other development partners in all activities under the \nGCDPSMP. This includes cooperation under the NGPARP coordination framework.14 \n \n7. \nLessons  learned.  Implementation  of  the  GCDPSMP  so  far  has  reconfirmed  the  long-\nterm nature of governance reforms. They also demand flexibility in implementation to respond to \nchanges  in  priorities.  This  need  is  compounded  in  the  case  of  the  Lao  PDR  by  the  country\u2019s \nparticular  political  and  government  institutional  framework,  rising  fiscal  pressures,  and  the  low \ncapacity  in  the  government  agencies  at  all  levels.  Given  the  weak  enabling  environment  and \nlack of efficient managerial structures and capacity for institutions to succeed at an anticipated \npace, it is critical that ADB be continuously engaged and provide technical advice quickly. It is \nequally important that ADB understand the political economy, the overall environment, and the \nformal  and  informal  rules  that  govern  the  PSM  reform  process  in  the  country.  Another  lesson \nhas been that the public administration  and PFM reforms require effective coordination across \nseveral ministries. These lessons have been taken into account in preparing subprogram 2. \n \nB. \n \n8. \nThe  impact  will  be  an  improved  delivery  of  key  public  services.  The  benchmark  of  the \nimpact  will  be  progress  toward  achieving  education  and  health  MDGs.  The  outcome  will  be \nstrengthened public sector management at national and subnational levels. \n \nC. \n \n9. \nThe GCDPSMP  will achieve its outcome by delivering three outputs: (i) implementation \nof  multiyear  budgeting  and  intergovernmental  fiscal  relations;  (ii)  strengthening  of  civil  service \ncapacity  at  the  central  and  subnational  levels,  including  gender-responsive  capacity;  and  (iii) \nstrengthening  investment  management  capacity  in  the  public  sector  for  private  sector \ninvestments and identifying potential public\u2013private partnership (PPP) arrangements. Since the \napproval  of  the  GCDPSMP  in  2012,  the  reform  momentum  has  been  maintained  between \nsubprograms  1  and  2.  Under  subprogram  2,  which  advances  reforms  initiated  under \nsubprogram  1,  the  government  has  accomplished  19  policy  actions\u20149  triggers  and  10 \nmilestones.15 Against their formulation at GCDPSMP approval, several policy actions have been \nupdated and one policy trigger has been added.16 Details are in Appendix 4.17 \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                \n12 ADB. 2010.

The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  has  continued  with  reforms  initiated  during \nsubprogram  1  that  target  areas  found  challenging  by  a  2011  public  financial  accountability \nassessment. 18  Specifically,  under  subprogram  2,  the  government  has  made  progress  on \ndeveloping  an  integrated  public  finance  development  strategy  for  the  period  to  2020.  The \nstrategy  is  aimed  at  linking  policy,  planning,  and  budgeting  in  a  consistent  framework  and \nimproving  coordination  between  the  MOF,  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment  (MPI),  and \nthe  Bank  of  the  Lao  PDR.  This  strategy  will  be  informed  by  the  fiscal  strategy  paper,  the \nmedium-term  budget  framework  being  supported  by  ADB,  and  an  integrated  macroeconomic \ncoordination framework developed by the MOF.19 The MOF is also finalizing revisions to the law \non state budget for submission to the National Assembly in December 2014. The revisions will \nseek  to  address  the  most  serious  PFM  weaknesses. 20  Central  and  provincial  government \nexpenditures for health and education increased significantly during 2012\u20132014 (footnote 3). In \naddition,  the  MOF,  in  partnership  with  the  Ministry  of  Education  and  Sports  (MOES)  and  the \nMinistry of Health (MOH), has initiated development of medium-term expenditure framework in \nthe health and education sectors.  \n \n11. \nThe government  also  amended  its  law  on  accounting  in December  2013. The  law  now \nrequires  all  government  entities  to  comply  with  the  cash-based  International  Public  Sector \nAccounting  Standards  (IPSAS).  The  government  prepared  an  accounting  manual  to  guide \nimplementation  of  these  standards.  The  scope of the government financial  information  system \n(GFIS)\u2014the core system for reporting and accounting purposes\u2014has been enhanced by linking \nthe  GFIS  to  the  tax  and  customs  information  management  systems.  The  MOF  has  initiated  a \nreview  on  the  information  technology  solution  for  the  Lao  financial  management  information \nsystem that would eventually take over from the GFIS and would cover the budget preparation \nand execution phases. To improve the transparency, equity, predictability, and effectiveness of \ncentral government transfers to provinces and districts, the MOF has undertaken a review and \nadopted a road map for improving intergovernmental fiscal transfer arrangements to accelerate \nimplementation  of  the  Sam  Sang  initiative. 21  As  part  of  implementation  of  the  Sam  Sang \ninitiative in the short term, the MOF issued guidelines on revenue collection responsibilities and \nrevenue sharing between the central government and local administrations, since this was not \ncovered in sufficient detail in the budget law. \n \n12. \nSince subprogram 1, the SAO has continued making progress on its high priority to build \ncapacity and improve systems in procurement audit. A total of 527 of its auditors, 31% of whom \nwere  women,  were  trained  in  procurement  audit  in  May  2012\u2013April  2014.  SAO  developed \n                                                                                                                                                       \nactions.  Implementation  of  Sam  Sang  initiative\u2019s  pilot has  provided context  to  the  pace  of  subprogram 2  reforms \nsuch as intergovernmental fiscal transfers and civil service capacity building. \n\n17 The  formulation  of  policy  actions  has  been  updated  to  better  reflect  the  status  of  reforms  without  affecting  the \nsubstance of the policy actions. In some cases, the updated formulations reflect the greater-than-expected reform \nprogress.  A  new  trigger  was  introduced  to  reflect  the  progress  in  improving  the  civil  service  training  framework. \nSubsequent discussion on the outputs relates to accomplishments under both policy milestones and triggers. \n\n18  Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Public  Sector  Management  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n19 Fiscal Strategy for the Lao PDR (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). Given the large civil \nservice wage bill increase in FY2013, the MOF considers the medium-term budget framework to be an important \ntool to ensure fiscal sustainability. \n\n20  Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Public  Sector  Management  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\n21 The review considers determination of total envelope of transfers to provinces and districts as a defined share of \ncentral government\u2019s revenues; this transfer envelope would then be apportioned to provinces and districts based \non a formula reflecting the area, population, poverty level, and level of economic development of each province and \ndistrict. \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nprocurement  audit  implementation  guidelines  and  training  materials  benchmarked  against  the \nInternational  Standards  of  Supreme  Audit  Institutions  (ISSAI). 22  SAO  staff  members  also \nconducted two pilot audits in March\u2013June 2013 and two model audits in January\u2013March 2014.23 \nThis helped validate their professional capacity under actual conditions in real audits. In addition, \ncoordination  between  the  economic  planning  and  finance  committee  (EPFC)  of  the  National \nAssembly  and  the  SAO  has  been  strengthened  by  ensuring  a  detailed  examination  of  SAO\u2019s \naudit reports by the EPFC; introducing\u2014for the first time in Lao PDR\u2014a provision on hearing by \nthe National Assembly on the SAO\u2019s audit report on government expenditures; and entitling the \nSAO  to  follow  up  on  the  resolutions  of  the  National  Assembly.  The  SAO\u2019s  involvement  in  the \nbudget  and  public  investment  plan  approval  process  has  also  been  strengthened.  A \ncomprehensive  training  program  for  500  EPFC  staff  members  and  members  of  the  National \nAssembly took place. Among the topics covered was the examination of SAO audit reports (133 \nofficials participated, of which 45 were women, in the training on this topic).  \n \n13. \nOutput  2:  Civil  service  capacity  at  the  central  and  subnational  levels,  including \ngender-responsive  capacity,  strengthened.  Since  subprogram  1,  the  government  has \ncontinued  with  reforms  aimed  at  strengthening  civil  service  capacity  at  the  central  and \nsubnational levels\u2014with distinct emphasis on mainstreaming gender equality. This is in line with \nthe Sam Sang initiative. The NGPARP has continued to serve as an integrated implementation \nand  coordination  framework  for  governance  projects  supported  by  development  partners. 24 \nDevelopment  of  a  civil  service  law  is  at  advanced  stage.  The  law  will  address  such  issues  as \nscope of coverage, civil service structure, recruitment and promotion frameworks, performance \nand  competence  management  systems,  fiscally  sustainable  salary  and  benefits  frameworks, \nand  human  resource  development  systems.  It  is  expected  to  be  submitted  to  the  National \nAssembly  in  December  2015,  after  incorporation  of  findings  from  the  evaluation  of  the  Sam \nSang pilot at the end of 2014.25 The Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA) has started developing a \n10-year strategy and a five-year plan on public administration reform, building on the experience \nof implementation of the strategic plan on governance, 2011\u20132020. The government\u2019s national \nleading committee on NGPARP, chaired by the deputy prime minister, has continued to closely \nmonitor public administration reforms, as has the NGPARP board. Both met regularly in 2012\u2013\n2014.  Although  the  government  has  yet  to  approve  a  proposed  national  strategy  for  gender \nequality in public administration, some of the concepts it will contain are starting to be applied. \nThe  MOHA  has  facilitated  establishment  of  divisions  on  the  advancement  of  women  in  home \naffairs offices at provincial and district levels to ensure mainstreaming of gender equity in public \nadministration  at  the  local  level  and  to  support  strengthening  of  the  capacity  of  female  civil \nservants in local administrations. \n \n14. \nThe  Public  Administration  Research  Training  Institute  (PARTI)\u2014a  nonpolitical  civil \nservice capacity-building institution established within the MOHA in 2012 under subprogram 1\u2014\n\n                                                \n22  Among  the  standards  used  for  developing  the  guidelines  and  training  materials  were  ISSAI  standards  on \ncompliance audit, fundamental precepts of auditing, supreme audit institution independence, code of ethics, audit \nquality control, fundamental auditing principles, and performance auditing. \n\n23 Two  pilot  audits  were  aimed  at  testing  the  application  of  procurement  audit  on  small  projects  at  the  Ministry  of \nPublic Works and Transport and at MOH. In the pilot audits, the SAO auditors focused on only some selected steps \nin  procurement\u2014e.g.,  bid  document  preparation,  prequalification,  and  opening  of  bidding  documents.  The  two \nmodel audits helped test the procurement audit methodology through the entire procurement process of two large-\nscale projects valued at more than $1 million each at the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the MOH. \n\n24  These  projects  include  (i)  the  UNDP-supported  Strengthening  Capacity  and  Service  Delivery  of  Local \nAdministrations Project, (ii) the UNDP-supported Civil Society Support Program, (iii) the ADB\u2019s GCDPSMP, and (iv) \nthe European Commission\u2019s Legal and Institutional Framework for Public Administration Project. \n\n25 The  draft  law  also  provides  for  equality  among  civil  servants  regardless  of  age  and  gender  and  extends  the \n\nretirement age of women from 55 to 60 to equal that of men. \n\n\f6 \n \n\nfund  under \n\nhas  started  providing  public  administration  and  management  training  at  the  central  and \nsubnational  levels.26 At  least  30%  of  training  participants  have  been  women,  in  line  with  the \nprovisions of the draft national strategy for gender equality in public administration. PARTI is still \nunderstaffed and under-resourced and has drafted and submitted for MOHA\u2019s review a 5-year \nstrategic  development  plan  and  proposal  to  gradually  increase  its  staffing  and  resources. 27 \nUnder this plan, the PARTI would aim to have 40% of its employees, 15% of its managers, and \n30%  of  the  overall  training  participants  be  women.  To  provide  a  framework  for  civil  servant \ndevelopment,  the  MOHA  has  begun  developing  a  decree  on  training  and  development  in  the \ncivil service. As the secretariat of the Sam Sang steering committee, the MOHA has continued \nto  lead  the  government  effort  to  strengthen  the  new  administrative  architecture  at  the  district \nlevel.  Its  efforts  have  also  included  establishment  of  rules  and  mechanisms  for  village \nadministration,  initiation  of  a  revision  of  administrative  arrangements  to  empower  local \nadministrations,  clarifications  on  salaries  of  village  administration  staff,  and  improvement  of \nvillage  administration  capacity.  In  the  Sam  Sang  pilot  districts  covered  by  the  district \ndevelopment \nthe  Strengthening  Capacity  and  Service  Delivery  of  Local \nAdministrations Project funded by the UNDP, the government has ensured that the head of the \ndistrict Lao Women's Union and one woman village representative were members of the district \ndevelopment fund committees to empower women in the decision making at the local level.  \n \n15. \nSince subprogram 1, the National Commission for the Advancement of Women (NCAW), \nwhich  is  a  government  agency  responsible for  the  implementation  of  the  National  Strategy  for \nthe  Advancement  of  Women  (NSAW),  has  continued  increasing  the  role  of  women  in  public \nadministration  through  subcommittees  on  advancement  of  women  established  in  all  line \nministries  and  provincial  and  district  administrations. To  monitor  implementation  of  the  NSAW, \nthe  NCAW  has  developed  a  comprehensive  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  and  reporting \nframework and conducted training in selected line ministries. As part of the implementation of a \nfive-year  strategy  for  the  advancement  of  women  in  the  agriculture  and  forestry  sector,  the \nMinistry  of  Agriculture  and  Forestry  (MAF)  has  developed  a  comprehensive  framework  and \nconducted  capacity  building  to  mainstream  gender  equity  into  sector  planning,  budgeting,  and \nM&E. \n \n16. \nOutput 3: Investment management capacity in the public sector for private sector \ninvestments  and  potential  public\u2013private  partnership  arrangements  strengthened.  The \ngovernment  announced  a  moratorium  in  June  2012  during  subprogram  1  on  granting  land \nconcessions and leases for the predominantly foreign private sector initiatives in the mining and \nagricultural  sector,  especially  for  rubber  and  palm  oil  plantations.  Since  then,  the  Ministry  of \nNatural  Resources  and  Environment  (MONRE)  has  made  headway  on  developing  a  national \nland  policy  and  amendments  to  the  country\u2019s  land  law.  Both  are  in  final  preparation  for  the \nNational Assembly\u2019s consideration. The MONRE has also developed revisions to the decree on \ncompensation and resettlement for development projects that aims to improve fairness and the \nscope of compensation in cases of land acquisition and resettlement in the public interest. The \nproposed  revisions  are  undergoing  review  in  the  government.  To  synchronize  land  and \nenvironmental sustainability frameworks, the MONRE has developed a national resources and \nenvironment policy. Land management issues are also being mainstreamed in the revisions to \n\n                                                \n26 These courses cover such areas as public administration, office management, induction for new recruits, training of \ntrainers, leadership development and planning, and budgeting and financial management for managers not expert \nin finance. Besides incorporating gender content into its courses, PARTI is finalizing dedicated courses on gender \nmainstreaming and gender and human resource management. \n\n27 PARTI  currently  has  17  staff  members,  of  whom  6  are  women.  Under  the  plan  submitted  to  the  MOHA,  PARTI \naims  to  expand  its  staff  to  50  and  has  plans  for  a  new  building.  PARTI\u2019s  research  department  has  no  staff  yet. \nPARTI could recruit only one staff member in 2013 and two in 2014. \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nThe government has requested a single tranche loan in various currencies equivalent to     \n\nin  handling \n\nto  build  capacity \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\nthe Lao PDR\u2019s national investment policy that the MONRE has submitted for review to the MPI \nminister.  Apart  from  improving  its  policy  and  legal  framework  for  land  management,  the \ngovernment  conducted  a  comprehensive  program \nland \nmanagement issues in the MPI, MAF, and MONRE at the central and provincial levels.28 \n \n17. \nThe  government  recognizes  the  potential  role  of  the  private  sector  in  the  delivery  of \npublic services and in helping to fill the country\u2019s large infrastructure gap. Since subprogram 1, it \nhas made substantial progress on developing a policy and legal framework for making PPPs a \nregular  modality  for  the  development  of  public  infrastructure.  The  MPI  has  developed  and \ndisclosed  an  initial  conceptual framework  on the  development  of  PPPs, which sets  out  a road \nmap  for  PPP  reforms  in  2014\u20132016.  It  has  also  reached  the  public  consultation  phase  in  the \ndevelopment of a decree on PPPs expected to be submitted for the prime minister\u2019s approval by \nthe end of 2014. The decree will reflect government policy and principles for PPPs, institutional \nset-up  (e.g.,  high-level  government  committee  on  PPPs,  a  nodal  PPP  office,  and  a  project \ndevelopment facility), project preparation support arrangements; investor selection procedures; \ntreatment  of  unsolicited  proposals;  government  support  mechanisms  (e.g.,  viability  gap  and \ncontingent  liability  funding);  and mainstreaming  of  gender  responsiveness  in  PPPs.  The  MOH \nand  the  MOES  have  established PPP  committees  and  have prepared  prefeasibility  studies for \ntwo pilot PPP projects in the health sector and one in education.29 \n \nD. \n \n18. \nSDR10,052,000  from  ADB's  Special  Funds  resources  to  help  finance  subprogram  2  of  the \nGCDPSMP.30 The loan size of subprogram 2 takes in account Lao PDR\u2019s increased fiscal space \nconstraints and financing needs for development expenditure programs.31 The loan will have a \n24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin  the  draft  loan  agreement.  The  amount  of  the  loan  has  been  included  in  the  government's \nexternal borrowing program for  FY2015, which will total $290 million. The government will use \nthe  funds  generated  from  this  policy-based  loan  to  support  full  implementation  of  the  policy \nactions contained in the policy matrix and to ensure sustainability of the program\u2019s reforms, with \na special focus on public financing for education and health sectors.32  \n \nE. \n \nThe  implementation  period  for  subprogram  2  is  August  2012\u2013September  2014.  The \n19. \nexecuting  agency  is  the  MOF,  and  it  is  responsible  for  the  coordination  between  relevant \ngovernment agencies, maintenance of all program records, communication with ADB on behalf \n                                                \n28 A total of 94 staff members from the central and local governments, including 10 women, were given this training. \n29 The prefeasibility studies also covered gender considerations, such as an assessment of the education and health \nstatus of women, assessment of their access and use of facilities, establishment of gender-disaggregated baseline \ninformation, assessment of employment opportunities for women during the construction and operation phases of \nthe project, and analysis of project impacts on the security and safety of women. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n30 The overall adjustment cost of implementing the reform measures under subprogram 2 is estimated at $23 million. \n\nSummary Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n31 The  FY2014  deficit  is  estimated  at  4.2%  of  GDP,  which  is  higher  than  the  planned  deficit  of  1.5%  of  GDP.  In \nFY2014, realization of revenue collection was about 85%; tax revenue collection fell short of the plan by 2.5% of \nGDP  due  to  weak  mining  profit  tax  collection  and  overly  optimistic  revenue  forecast.  Capital  expenditure  was \nhigher than planned due to arrears payment of about 1.5% of GDP. \n\n32 Actual expenditure of the MOES increased by 104% in FY2013 from FY2012. Similarly, the actual expenditure of \nthe MOH increased by 193% in FY2013. These increases are substantial when compared with the 37% growth in \ntotal expenditure in FY2013 over FY2012. \n\n\f8 \n \n\nof the government, and disbursement of loan proceeds. A program steering committee, chaired \nby the vice-minister of finance, oversees program implementation and provides overall guidance. \nThe SAO, EPFC, MOHA, NCAW, MAF, MONRE, and MPI are the implementing agencies. \n \nDisbursement arrangements. The policy-based loan for subprogram 2 will be released \n20. \nin  a  single  tranche,  following  loan  effectiveness.  The  closing  date  of  the  loan  will  be  30  June \n2015.  The  government  will  use  the  local  currency  counterpart  funds  generated  by  the  loan \nproceeds mainly to meet program expenditures and associated costs of reform. The proceeds \nof  the  subprogram  2  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB's \nSimplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans.33 \nBefore withdrawing any funds, the government will open or nominate a deposit account with the \nBank of the Lao PDR to receive the loan proceeds. The account will be managed, operated, and \nliquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2012,  as  amended  from \ntime  to  time).  ADB  will  retain  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  to  verify  the \naccuracy of the government\u2019s certification for the withdrawal application. \n \nPost-program  partnership  framework.  PSM  reforms  being  initiated  under  the \n21. \nGCDPSMP are long-term in nature, and subprograms 1 and 2 represent important milestones in \na  PSM  reform  continuum.  To  maintain  the  reform  momentum  spurred  by  the  GCDPSMP,  the \ngovernment  and  ADB  will  continue  partnering  in  the  PSM  area  through  a  post-program \npartnership framework (P3F). The P3F will allow the continuation of the policy dialogue in 2015\u2013\n2016  in such  areas  as  budget reforms  that  include multiyear  budgeting and  intergovernmental \nfiscal  transfers;  public  administration  reforms,  including  civil  service management  and  training; \nand  improved  governance  of  land  management,  as  well  as  development  of  PPPs.  It  will  also \nbuild  a  platform  for  the  next  phase  of  ADB  policy-based  support  to  PSM  reforms,  which  is \nprogrammed for 2016. The P3F directions in each of the PSM reform areas are in Appendix 4.34 \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \n22. \nThe  increased  budget  for  the  education  and  health  sectors  will  make  government \nexpenditure  more  efficient  by  reallocating  its  financial  resources  to  development  priorities  with \nhigher  rates  of  socioeconomic  returns.  Ongoing  public  administration  reforms  that  improve \ninstitutional  and  legal  frameworks,  build  capacity  through  training,  and  organize  civil  service \nmore efficiently will make government staff more productive in performing their duties and lead \nto  more  efficient  interaction  with  the  public  and  better  delivery  of  services.  In  addition,  the \ngovernment\u2019s plans for the administrative and fiscal strengthening of district administrations can \nlead  to  a  better  assignment  of  functions  between  levels  of  public  administration  and  more \neffective  service  delivery,  given  limited  budget  envelope.  Land  management  reform  and  the \nPPP  framework  will  have  large  potential  economic  spin-offs  from  increased  and  better  quality \nprivate sector investment. \n \nB. \n \n23. \nSince the GCDPSMP was approved, the government has continued its PFM reforms to \nimprove  public  sector  governance  in  general  and  to  address  key  weaknesses  in  budget \n                                                \n33 ADB. 1998.

These  efforts  have  included \ninstitutional and capacity development measures to mitigate risks arising from a lack of qualified \nand skilled  personnel  in the  MOF, the  SAO, and  line ministries.  A  new  government  decree  on \nprocurement, its implementing rules and regulations, procurement manual and standard bidding \ndocuments has improved public procurement practice. Implementation of laws on anticorruption, \nstate  inspection,  complaints,  state  audit,  and  state  accounting  has  helped  strengthen \nanticorruption  measures  and  tackle  patronage  and  corruption  in  the  public  sector.  Good \ngovernance  is  a  major  cross  cutting  theme  in  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to  improve  the  land \nmanagement systems and develop PPPs.35 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \nC. \n \n24. \nThe GCDPSMP is a general intervention aimed at improving public service delivery. It is \nexpected to have an indirect positive effect on poverty reduction by improving implementation of \npublic expenditure programs that target poor and vulnerable groups.36 The program is likely to \nhave a positive impact on gender equity by (i) narrowing gender gaps in access to education in \npoor,  rural,  remote,  and  ethnic  group  areas;  (ii)  reducing  maternal  mortality  through  better \nfunding that will improve the access to emergency obstetric care and skilled attendants at birth, \nas well as lower financial barriers to the use of health services; (iii) enhancing the participation \nof  women  in  decision  making;  and  (iv)  improving  gender  awareness  and  the  gender-sensitive \ncapacity of civil servants to support the delivery of public services. Subprogram 2 is categorized \nas effective gender mainstreaming. \n \nD. \n \n25. \nIn  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  GCDPSMP  is \nclassified  as  category  C  for  impacts  on  the  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and \nindigenous peoples.  \n \nE. \n \nThe  government  has  shown  a  continuous  commitment  to  improving  governance  by \n26. \nundertaking several key reforms in PFM, the legal and capacity development framework for the \ncivil  service,  and  public  asset  and  investment  management  systems.  The  cumulative  benefits \nand  impacts  of  these  reforms  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  associated  risks  and  costs.  Major \nrisks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  the  table  below.

Media and civil society are \ninsufficiently empowered, which limits \nthe bottom-up demand for and feedback \nto reforms. \nImplementation risk: Implementation of \nPFM, public administration, land \nmanagement, and PPP reforms could be \nundermined or delayed by institutional \nresistance to reform; insufficient \nhorizontal and vertical coordination \nwithin government; weak capacity of civil \nservants at central and local levels; and \na lack of skilled professionals in public \nfinance, public administration, the civil \nservice, and project finance.  \nExternal risk: The GCDPSMP\u2019s \neffectiveness could be diminished by \nmacroeconomic imbalances from \ninability to tame fiscal deficits due to \nlarge public sector wage bills and \nbenefits expenditures and/or \nexacerbated volatility in prices of key \nexport commodities. \n\nMitigating Measures \nintergovernmental fiscal transfer systems, and raise capacity in \naccounting and reporting. The government has continued \nimplementation of civil society empowerment projects under the \nNGPARP framework. \nInstitutional risk has been mitigated through continuous \nsupervision of high-level government coordination \nmechanisms, such as the national leading committee on \ngovernance and the NGPARP board, as well as through proper \ncoordination between central level agencies and local \nadministrations for the Sam Sang pilot implementation. \nAdoption of amendments to several major laws and long-term \npublic finance and public administration reform strategies will \nhelp sustain reform over time. Strengthening of PARTI and \ndevelopment of training modules on public\u2013private partnership \nwill help address skills shortage. \nThe government remains committed to macroeconomic \nstability, as shown by its expenditure cuts and measures to \nstrengthen public administration. Ongoing development of a \nlong-term public finance development strategy will be important \nto mitigate this risk.
