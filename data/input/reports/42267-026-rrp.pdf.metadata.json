THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \npolicy-based loan, (ii) a proposed project loan, and (iii) proposed administration of a grant to be \nprovided  by  the  Sanitation  Financing  Partnership  Trust  Fund  (SFPTF)1 under  the  Water \nFinancing  Partnership  Facility,  all  to  India  for  the  Rajasthan  Urban  Sector  Development \nProgram.  The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Capacity \nDevelopment of Institutions in the Urban Sector in Rajasthan, and if the Board approves the \nproposed loans and grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve \nthe TA.2 \n \n2.  The sector development program (SDP) will complement past and ongoing efforts of the \nGovernment of Rajasthan to improve water supply and wastewater services to the residents of \nthe state of Rajasthan.3 The SDP comprises (i) a program, financed by a policy-based loan, to \nsupport policy reforms, including institutional development and governance improvement in the \nurban sector in the state; and (ii) a project, financed by a project loan, to invest in the water \ndistribution network in five project cities and sewerage systems in the six project cities.4 \n \nII.  THE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Urban centers as engines of growth. Urban centers have been driving economic \ngrowth in India, led by services and manufacturing, placing cities at the forefront of the country\u2019s \neconomic transformation.5 According to recent estimates, the urban sector contributes about \n63% of India\u2019s gross domestic product (2009\u20122010); this share is projected to increase to 75% \nby 2021.6 Similarly, while India\u2019s urban population currently constitutes about 31% of the total \npopulation, it is expected to grow to 43% by 2031.7 Increasing urbanization has aggravated the \nalready deficient urban infrastructure and poor services.8 The country partnership strategy, \n2013\u20132017 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for India identifies the urban infrastructure \ndeficit as one of the most important binding constraints to inclusive growth.9 The SDP fits well \nwith  the  priorities  identified  in  the  strategy,  and  will  address  the  country\u2019s  urbanization \nchallenge, including plans for urban renewal and development of smart cities. The proposed \ninvestment is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2013\u20132015 for India.10  \n                                                \n1  Financing partner: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance: ADB. 2011. Technical \nAssistance to India for Preparing the Rajasthan Urban Development Program. Manila (TA 8043-IND). \n4  The six project cities (with population per Census 2011) are Bhilwara (359,483), Sri Ganganagar (237,780), Pali \n(230,075), Tonk (165,294), Hanumangarh (150,958), and Jhunjhunu (118,473). The water supply component will \nbe implemented in all cities except Bhilwara.  \n5  Government of India, High Powered Expert Committee. 2011.

Report of the Steering Committee on Urbanization, Twelfth Five \nYear Plan (2012\u20132017). New Delhi.  \n8  Only 64% of India\u2019s urban population has individual water connections; water supply is mostly intermittent ranging \nfrom 1 to 6 hours a day; nonrevenue water accounts for about 50% of production; most cities do not have \nfunctional water meters; only 5% of cities have any kind of sewerage system; 18% of urban households defecate in \nthe open; and only 21% of wastewater generated is treated (footnote 5). \n9  ADB. 2013.

Rajasthan, with a population of 68.6 million and \nan area of 342,239 square kilometers, is the largest state in the country. About 25% of the \npopulation is urban, this percentage is increasing rapidly at 2.9% per annum. Since 2000, the \nstate government has successfully implemented two multisector urban investment projects, \nwhich benefitted more than 5 million residents of six major cities under the first project and more \nthan 2 million residents of 15 secondary cities under the second project.11 Important lessons \nfrom the projects have been incorporated in the SDP design, including (i) consultations on \nproject design, last-mile connectivity, cost recovery, user charges, and timely induction and \ncapacity  building  of  counterpart  staff  are  crucial  for  sustainability;  (ii)  contracts  should  be \ngrouped into fewer packages with long-term operation and maintenance (O&M) provisions; and \n(iii)  advance  actions  for  procurement  should  be  undertaken  to  enhance  project  readiness. \nAnother important lesson, reiterated in the review of the country partnership strategy, 2009\u2013\n2012, is that investments have to be coupled with sustainable and vibrant institutions and \neffective governance systems to sustain and maximize their impacts.12 \n \n5.  Need for a sector development program. The SDP modality will support both the \ninfrastructure needs and the reform program, which focuses on strengthening institutions and \nadjusting the policy, institutional, legal, financial, and regulatory framework. The policy-based \nloan will provide financial support to the state government to implement reforms that will unlock \nthe potential of various stakeholders, including municipal bodies, individual households, and \nprivate  sector  investors.  The  project  loan  will  support  catalytic  investments  that  enhance \nproductivity and leverage finances from various other sources in the project cities. The project \nwill  also  introduce  innovations  in  water  supply  and  wastewater  management,  such  as \ncontinuous water supply, and long-term O&M embedded construction contracts for nonrevenue \nwater (NRW) reduction and sustainability of operations.13 If implemented successfully, the SDP \nmay play a demonstrative role for urban sector operations in India. \nB.  Impact and Outcome  \n6.  The  impact  of  the  SDP  will  be  sustainable  urban  development  in  Rajasthan.  The \noutcome will be improved urban service delivery in Rajasthan. \n  \nC.  Outputs \n7.  The SDP will have five outputs: the policy-based loan will support outputs 1 and 2; the \nproject loan will support outputs 3, 4, and 5. The policy-based loan will have two tranches with \n                                                \n11  ADB. 1998. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to India for the \nRajasthan Urban Infrastructure Development Project. Manila; ADB. 2007. Report and Recommendation of the \nPresident to the Board of Directors: Proposed Multitranche Financing Facility to India for the Rajasthan Urban \nSector Development Investment Program. Manila. The two projects focused on the urban sector with several \nsubsectors, such as water supply, wastewater, urban transport, drainage, solid waste management, fire fighting, \nand heritage. The six cities proposed under the SDP were not covered in these two earlier projects. \n12  Water supply and wastewater operations are handled by the Public Health Engineering Department throughout the \nstate, with overlap in responsibilities with municipalities, development authorities, and housing boards in some \nareas. Recently, the Government of Rajasthan delegated operations to municipalities; however, the decision is not \nyet operationalized. \n13  Current status of water supply in the six project cities: average duration varies from 1 hour every 3 days to 2 hours \nevery day; coverage varies from 80% to 100%; production varies from 69 to 136 liters per capita per day; and \nhousehold service connections coverage varies from 57% to 96%. NRW ranges from 36% to 76% due to poor \nquality networks, unauthorized connections, ineffective metering, and poor revenue realization. There is no piped \nsewerage system, and septic tank coverage varies from 65% to 99%. Tariffs are very low (for example, the rate for \nup to 15,000 liters consumption for a domestic consumer is Rs1.56 per 1,000 liters) and covers around 20% of the \nO&M cost of water supply. Sewerage charge is collected as a percentage (20% to 33%) of the water charge.  \n   ", "        3 \n10 and 13 policy actions, respectively. The project will invest in water supply in five project cities \nand in wastewater in six project cities (footnote 4), which were selected in consultation with the \nstate government using the criteria that each city: (i) has a population of more than 100,000; (ii) \nis a district headquarter not covered under the earlier two projects (footnote 11); (iii) is an \nimportant administrative and economic center; and (iv) has potential to play demonstrative role \nfor other cities in the country in implementing and sustaining the proposed sector reforms.   \n \n8.  Output  1:  Urban  institutions  strengthened.  Activities  include  (i)  creation  of  a \nsustainable corporatized state institution for urban development; (ii) corporatization of water \nsupply and wastewater operations in the capital city of Jaipur; (iii) implementation of long-term \nperformance-based management contracts in at least six cities; (iv) delegation of water supply \nand sewerage functions, along with adequate resources and tariff-setting authority, to municipal \nbodies; and (v) rationalization of urban property tax for municipal bodies.  \n \n9.  Output 2: Urban governance improved. Activities include (i) formulation and approval \nof a long-term urban development policy; (ii) development of a human resource development \nplan  for  urban  governance,  including  establishment  of  a  state  training  institute;  \n(iii) implementation of water sector reforms such as reduction of NRW, 24-hour water supply, \nindividual household connections to residents in slum areas, benchmarking of urban services, \nand development of geographic information systems (GIS) and customer databases, and water \nand wastewater quality monitoring systems; (iv) support for total sanitation and solid waste \nmanagement; (v) support for linkages between sanitation and health; and (vi) rationalization of \nwater and sewerage tariffs for O&M cost recovery, and improvement of collection efficiency. \n \n10.  Output 3: Water supply system rehabilitated and expanded in five project cities. \nActivities include (i) distribution network improvement, including digital network systems, on a \ndistrict metering area basis for NRW reduction; (ii) provision of individual property connections \nto residents, especially the poor and households headed by women; (iii) provision of 24-hour \nwater supply; and (iv) improvement of water supply efficiency by reducing NRW and energy \nlosses of electromechanical machinery.  \n \n11.  Output 4: Wastewater system rehabilitated and expanded in six project cities. \nActivities include (i) rehabilitation and expansion of the sewerage network, including separation \nof sanitary sewers from drains, and property connections; (ii) modernization and expansion of \nwastewater  treatment  plants;  (iii)  use  of  wastewater  as  a  resource,  including  recycling  of \nwastewater,  and  energy  generation  through  sludge  digestion  and gasification; (iv)  septage \nmanagement and decentralized wastewater treatment systems in suitable areas; and (v) total \nsanitation and solid waste management.  \n \n12.  Output  5:  Capacity  building  and  efficient  program  management  implemented. \nActivities include (i) capacity building of urban institutions and municipal bodies, (ii) project \nmanagement, (iii) implementation of a gender equality and social inclusion action plan, and (iv) \nimplementation of a community awareness and participation plan. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Investment and Financing Plans \n13.   The policy-based loan will provide budget support to the state government to finance \nthe policy reforms as outlined in the Government of India\u2019s development policy letter and policy \nmatrix (Appendixes 3 and 4). The size of the policy-based loan was determined based on (i) \nfinancial support required to prepare, implement, and monitor the proposed policy actions; (ii) \nassessment  of  the  state  government\u2019s  overall  financial  resources,  allocation  for  and ", "4 \n \ndevelopment  financing  needs  in  the  urban  sector;  (iii)  the  state  government\u2019s  absorptive \ncapacity  demonstrated  through  implementation  of  the  urban  sector  projects;  and  (iv) \nrequirement of capacity building of institutions in the urban sector.14 The government of India \nhas requested a loan of $250 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the \nprogram, which the government will relend to the state government under the same terms as \nthe original loan. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, an \nannual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The two tranches of $125 \nmillion each are expected to be released, upon full compliance with the respective tranche \nconditions, in December 2015 and December 2017, respectively. \n \n14.

LSGD will be the executing agency for the \nTA, and the TA will be implemented over 3 years during SDP implementation.17 \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n18.  Water supply and improved efficiency. RUIDP will work with the state government to \nestablish 24-hour water supply in the major cities in the state, including the five project cities. To \nensure  sustainability  of  operations,  the  SDP  will  implement  a  comprehensive  network \nmanagement plan based on a district metering areas approach for NRW assessment.18 \n \n19.  Smart cities and economic corridors. The SDP will support development of well-\nplanned, ecologically friendly, and technologically integrated smart cities in the state, which are \nlivable,  workable,  and sustainable.19 In  addition,  the  SDP  will  implement  a  comprehensive \ninformation technology-based network, including GIS and asset management plan, in the urban \nsector focusing on real time data collection and use in urban operations. The SDP will support \n                                                \n17  Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 A district metering area refers to a zone of a water supply network that can be isolated, and provided with a bulk \nmeter to measure input water quantity and consumer meters to measure consumption. The difference is used for \nassessing NRW in the district metering area. \n19  The concept of smart cities is still evolving in India; the SDP will provide timely and suitable mechanism to facilitate \ndevelopment and implementation of this new concept.  \n   ", "        7 \nupdating the water and sewerage GIS, which will help improve operationalization of the NRW \nreduction plan and asset management plan.  \n \n20.  Energy-efficient treatment processes and septage management. Under the project, \nwastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) will be constructed with energy-efficient and mechanized \ntreatment processes. The project will support integrated planning and development of WWTPs, \nwhich will include (i) use of wastewater as a resource with recycling of wastewater, and energy \ngeneration from sludge digestion or gasification, wherever feasible; (ii) septage management; \nand (iii) landscaping, plantation, and information centers in WWTPs sites. \n \n21.  Operation  and  maintenance  embedded  construction  contracts.  The  project  will \ninclude O&M embedded construction contracts for a sufficiently long period (7\u201210 years), which \nwill mitigate the municipalities\u2019 lack of O&M capacity, improve construction quality by providing \ncontinuity in system operation, and obligate municipalities to allocate adequate O&M budget. \nSpecial contract conditions for NRW reduction will be incorporated in the bidding documents. \n \n22.  Sanitation and solid waste management. Solid waste is frequently disposed of in \nsewers and utility holes, causing blockages, flooding, and problems for operations, or in the \nwater bodies. Similarly, open defecation is practiced in many urban areas. The SDP will support \nongoing programs on total sanitation and solid waste management. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n23.   Economic analysis. The estimated economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) of the five \nwater supply subprojects range from 17.30% to 21.70% and six wastewater subprojects range \nfrom 15.80% to 25.20%, higher than the economic opportunity cost of capital, estimated at \n12.0%, indicating sufficient economic return.20 The consolidated EIRR is 19.29% for water \nsupply subprojects and 18.04% for wastewater subprojects. The results are satisfactory against \nindividual downside risks, including a 20% increase in capital expenditure, 20% increase in \noperating costs, 20% decrease in benefits, and 1-year delay in project completion.  \n \n24.  Financial analysis. The financial internal rates of return for the project, calculated only \non the basis of income from water and sewerage tariffs, are negative against a weighted \naverage cost of capital of 2.62% per annum since the water tariffs are expected to recover \npartial O&M costs only. A municipal cash-flow analysis, including revenues from property tax \nand institutionalized transfers from the state government to municipal bodies, is more relevant \nand confirms that project cities have the financial capacity to sustain infrastructure and deliver \nthe services.21 Moreover, the SDP will help municipal bodies in improving financial sustainability \nby  (i) increasing revenues by rationalizing the urban property tax, (ii) rationalizing water and \nsewerage  tariffs,  (iii)  improving  collection  efficiency,  (iv)  recovering  arrears  with  adequate \nprovisioning for bad debts, and (v) computerizing operations and financial management.22 \n \nC.  Governance \n25.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to,  and \ndiscussed  with,  the  governments  of  India  and  Rajasthan,  and  LSGD.  The  specific  policy \n                                                \n20 Details are included in the Economic Analysis: Project Loan (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n21 Details are included in the Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Details are included in the Economic Analysis: Program Loan (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2).  ", "8 \n \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 15). Based on \nthe risk assessments, some of the mitigation measures incorporated in the SDP design aim to \n(i)  establish  a  mechanism  for  regular  voluntary  disclosure  of  project-related  information  to \nresidents; (ii) develop and update a website to enhance transparency in project implementation, \nprocurement, and safeguards; and (iii) establish a grievance redress mechanism to ensure \nquick and effective resolution. The delegation of water supply operations to municipal bodies will \nrequire coordination between the Public Health Engineering Department and municipal bodies. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n26.  Urban poverty in the state is estimated at 10.7%.23 Poverty is more evident in rural \nareas, but the gravity of poverty in cities is more severe due to lack of access to basic services, \nuncertainty about security of tenure, and concerns about safety in highly populated but insecure \nenvironments. The project prioritizes water supply and sewerage connections to the poor and \nhouseholds headed by women.24 The SDP will complement the state government\u2019s ongoing \nefforts to provide pro-poor and gender-inclusive water and sanitation services by (i) reducing \nconnection  fees  and  facilitating  individual  connections  to  the  poor,  socially  excluded,  and \nhouseholds headed by women, especially in slums; (ii) ensuring project cities are free of open \ndefecation; (iii)  incorporating  pro-poor  and gender-sensitive  sanitation services  in  the  state \ngovernment master plans; and (iv) piloting alternative onsite sanitation. A community awareness \nand participation plan is prepared for widespread, ongoing, and meaningful participation.25 \n   \n27.  Gender. The project loan is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. The gender \nequality  and  social  inclusion  action  plan  prepared  has  clear  targets,  responsibilities,  and \nresource allocation.26 RUIDP will implement the action plan, and community awareness and \nparticipation plan with support from the community awareness and participation consultant, \nnongovernment organizations, and water and sanitation committees of municipal bodies. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n28.  Social  safeguards.  The  project  loan  is  classified  as  category  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement and category C for indigenous peoples. The project does not involve permanent \nland acquisition or physical displacement. Families of scheduled tribes living in the project cities \nare mainstreamed with the general population. Draft resettlement plans prepared for the six \nproject cities are in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) to address \ntemporary livelihood impacts. 27 The plans will be finalized and disclosed at the time of the \ndetailed engineering design. The resettlement framework prepared will guide RUIDP on an \nadditional component in Pali, targeting industrial effluent treatment and disposal, and expected \nto have limited resettlement impacts.28 Meaningful and widespread consultations will continue \nwith  all  communities  in  the  project  area,  and  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  will  be \nestablished. The policy-based loan is not anticipated to have social safeguards impacts.29 \n \n                                                \n23  Government of India, Planning Commission. 2013.

Environmental  safeguards.  The  project  loan  is  classified  as  category  B  for \nenvironmental safeguards. Six initial environmental examinations (IEEs) with environmental \nmanagement plans were prepared for the six project cities in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009) and government laws.30 Draft IEEs will be finalized and submitted to \nADB for review and disclosure at the time of detailed engineering design. Project sites are \nlocated  outside  protected  areas  and  construction  impacts  will  be  mitigated  through \nimplementation of the environmental management plans as part of the contract documents. A \nfeasibility  study  and  IEEs  for  the  additional  component  in  Pali  will  be  guided  by  the \nenvironmental  subproject  selection  criteria  in  the  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework.31 No significant environmental impacts are envisaged. The policy-based loan is not \nanticipated to have environmental impacts (footnote 29). \n \n30.  Monitoring  of  wastewater.  The  project  will  support  improved  monitoring  of \nenvironmental regulatory  standards  by  (i)  enforcing  domestic sewage  discharge standards,  \n(ii) monitoring  the quality  of  discharge  to  water  bodies, (iii)  providing a  properly  equipped \nlaboratory, (iv) enforcing pretreatment of industrial effluent before discharging, (v) developing a \nseptage management plan, and (vi) processing and disposing of sludge and screenings.  \n \n31.  Natural  disasters  and  climate  change.  Climate  change  projections  indicate  an \nincrease of 2.40\u00ba Celsius during 2071\u20132100 in Rajasthan.32 Mean annual rainfall is predicted to \ndecrease slightly; extreme rainfall is expected to increase in frequency and intensity. The key \nrisk factors are frequent droughts, extremely low and erratic rainfall, and very limited surface \nwater sources resulting in greater dependence on groundwater resources. The SDP will focus \non NRW reduction and water use efficiency, improved sewerage collection, treatment, and \nenergy generation; and adaptation measures for risks related to earthquakes, landslides, floods, \nand climate change. Detailed design of the project components will consider findings from \nongoing climate change analysis models. \n  \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n32.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.33 The fiduciary risk for the program loan is \nmedium; the state government\u2019s public financial management systems are adequate to mitigate \nsuch risks. The integrated project benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nDelays in project  LSGD and UDH will assign qualified staff to RUIDP and minimize staff turnover. \nimplementation, including  The project management, design, and supervision consultant will support project \navailability of clear sites, may  management, safeguards, reporting, and training on FIDIC contracts.
