The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Capacity \nDevelopment  of  Institutions  in  the  Urban  Sector  in  Rajasthan,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the \nproposed loans and grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve \nthe TA.2 \n \n2. \nThe sector development program (SDP) will complement past and ongoing efforts of the \nGovernment of Rajasthan to improve water supply and wastewater services to the residents of \nthe state of Rajasthan.3 The SDP comprises (i) a program, financed by a policy-based loan, to \nsupport policy reforms, including institutional development and governance improvement in the \nurban  sector  in  the  state;  and  (ii)  a  project,  financed  by  a  project  loan,  to  invest  in  the  water \ndistribution network in five project cities and sewerage systems in the six project cities.4 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nUrban  centers  as  engines  of  growth.  Urban  centers  have  been  driving  economic \ngrowth in India, led by services and manufacturing, placing cities at the forefront of the country\u2019s \neconomic  transformation.5 According  to  recent  estimates,  the  urban  sector  contributes  about \n63% of India\u2019s gross domestic product (2009\u20122010); this share is projected to increase to 75% \nby  2021.6 Similarly,  while  India\u2019s  urban  population  currently  constitutes  about  31%  of  the  total \npopulation, it is expected to grow to 43% by 2031.7 Increasing urbanization has aggravated the \nalready  deficient  urban  infrastructure  and  poor  services. 8 The  country  partnership  strategy, \n2013\u20132017  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  India  identifies  the  urban  infrastructure \ndeficit  as  one  of the  most  important  binding  constraints to  inclusive growth.9 The  SDP fits  well \nwith  the  priorities  identified  in  the  strategy,  and  will  address  the  country\u2019s  urbanization \nchallenge,  including  plans  for  urban  renewal  and  development  of  smart  cities.  The  proposed \ninvestment is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2013\u20132015 for India.10  \n\n                                                \n1   Financing partner: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. \n2   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance:  ADB.  2011.

Manila (TA 8043-IND). \n\n4  The  six  project  cities  (with  population per  Census 2011)  are  Bhilwara  (359,483),  Sri  Ganganagar  (237,780),  Pali \n(230,075), Tonk (165,294), Hanumangarh (150,958), and Jhunjhunu (118,473). The water supply component will \nbe implemented in all cities except Bhilwara.  \n\n5   Government of India, High Powered Expert Committee. 2011.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n Need  for  investments  and  reforms. Rajasthan, with a population of 68.6 million and \n4. \nan  area  of  342,239  square  kilometers,  is  the  largest  state  in  the  country.  About  25%  of  the \npopulation is  urban,  this  percentage is  increasing  rapidly  at  2.9%  per  annum.  Since  2000, the \nstate  government  has  successfully  implemented  two  multisector  urban  investment  projects, \nwhich benefitted more than 5 million residents of six major cities under the first project and more \nthan  2  million  residents  of  15  secondary  cities  under  the  second  project.11 Important  lessons \nfrom  the  projects  have  been  incorporated  in  the  SDP  design,  including  (i)  consultations  on \nproject  design,  last-mile  connectivity,  cost  recovery,  user  charges,  and  timely  induction  and \ncapacity  building  of  counterpart  staff  are  crucial  for  sustainability;  (ii)  contracts  should  be \ngrouped into fewer packages with long-term operation and maintenance (O&M) provisions; and \n(iii)  advance  actions  for  procurement  should  be  undertaken  to  enhance  project  readiness. \nAnother  important  lesson,  reiterated  in  the  review  of  the  country  partnership  strategy,  2009\u2013\n2012,  is  that  investments  have  to  be  coupled  with  sustainable  and  vibrant  institutions  and \neffective governance systems to sustain and maximize their impacts.12 \n \n5. \nNeed  for  a  sector  development  program.  The  SDP  modality  will  support  both  the \ninfrastructure  needs  and  the  reform  program,  which  focuses  on  strengthening  institutions  and \nadjusting  the  policy,  institutional,  legal,  financial,  and  regulatory  framework.  The  policy-based \nloan will provide financial support to the state government to implement reforms that will unlock \nthe  potential  of  various  stakeholders,  including  municipal  bodies,  individual  households,  and \nprivate  sector  investors.  The  project  loan  will  support  catalytic  investments  that  enhance \nproductivity and leverage finances from various other sources in the project cities. The project \nwill  also  introduce  innovations  in  water  supply  and  wastewater  management,  such  as \ncontinuous water supply, and long-term O&M embedded construction contracts for nonrevenue \nwater (NRW) reduction and sustainability of operations.13 If implemented successfully, the SDP \nmay play a demonstrative role for urban sector operations in India. \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome  \n\nThe  impact  of  the  SDP  will  be  sustainable  urban  development  in  Rajasthan.  The \n\n6. \noutcome will be improved urban service delivery in Rajasthan. \n  \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n7. \nThe SDP will have five outputs: the policy-based loan will support outputs 1 and 2; the \nproject loan will support outputs 3, 4, and 5. The policy-based loan will have two tranches with \n\n                                                \n11  ADB. 1998. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to India for the \nRajasthan  Urban  Infrastructure  Development  Project.  Manila;  ADB.  2007.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the \nPresident  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Multitranche  Financing  Facility  to  India  for  the  Rajasthan  Urban \nSector  Development  Investment  Program.  Manila.  The  two  projects  focused  on  the  urban  sector  with  several \nsubsectors,  such  as  water  supply,  wastewater,  urban  transport,  drainage,  solid  waste  management,  fire  fighting, \nand heritage. The six cities proposed under the SDP were not covered in these two earlier projects. \n\n12  Water supply and wastewater operations are handled by the Public Health Engineering Department throughout the \nstate,  with  overlap  in  responsibilities  with  municipalities,  development  authorities,  and  housing  boards  in  some \nareas. Recently, the Government of Rajasthan delegated operations to municipalities; however, the decision is not \nyet operationalized. \n\n13  Current status of water supply in the six project cities: average duration varies from 1 hour every 3 days to 2 hours \nevery  day;  coverage  varies  from  80%  to  100%;  production  varies  from  69  to  136  liters  per  capita  per  day;  and \nhousehold  service  connections  coverage  varies  from  57%  to  96%.  NRW  ranges  from  36%  to  76%  due  to  poor \nquality networks, unauthorized connections, ineffective metering, and poor revenue realization. There is no piped \nsewerage system, and septic tank coverage varies from 65% to 99%. Tariffs are very low (for example, the rate for \nup to 15,000 liters consumption for a domestic consumer is Rs1.56 per 1,000 liters) and covers around 20% of the \nO&M cost of water supply. Sewerage charge is collected as a percentage (20% to 33%) of the water charge.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f        3 \n\ntraining \n\nfor  urban  governance, \n\nincluding  establishment  of  a  state \n\n10 and 13 policy actions, respectively. The project will invest in water supply in five project cities \nand in wastewater in six project cities (footnote 4), which were selected in consultation with the \nstate government using the criteria that each city: (i) has a population of more than 100,000; (ii) \nis  a  district  headquarter  not  covered  under  the  earlier  two  projects  (footnote  11);  (iii)  is  an \nimportant administrative and economic center; and (iv) has potential to play demonstrative role \nfor other cities in the country in implementing and sustaining the proposed sector reforms.   \n \n8. \nOutput  1:  Urban  institutions  strengthened.  Activities  include  (i)  creation  of  a \nsustainable  corporatized  state  institution  for  urban  development;  (ii)  corporatization  of  water \nsupply and wastewater operations in the capital city of Jaipur; (iii) implementation of long-term \nperformance-based management contracts in at least six cities; (iv) delegation of water supply \nand sewerage functions, along with adequate resources and tariff-setting authority, to municipal \nbodies; and (v) rationalization of urban property tax for municipal bodies.  \n \n9. \nOutput 2: Urban governance improved. Activities include (i) formulation and approval \nof  a  long-term  urban  development  policy;  (ii)  development  of  a  human  resource  development \ninstitute;  \nplan \n(iii)  implementation  of  water  sector  reforms  such  as  reduction  of  NRW,  24-hour  water  supply, \nindividual  household  connections  to residents  in  slum  areas,  benchmarking  of  urban  services, \nand development of geographic information systems (GIS) and customer databases, and water \nand  wastewater  quality  monitoring  systems;  (iv)  support  for  total  sanitation  and  solid  waste \nmanagement; (v) support for linkages between sanitation and health; and (vi) rationalization of \nwater and sewerage tariffs for O&M cost recovery, and improvement of collection efficiency. \n \n10. \nOutput  3:  Water  supply  system  rehabilitated  and  expanded  in  five  project  cities. \nActivities  include  (i)  distribution  network  improvement,  including  digital  network  systems,  on  a \ndistrict metering area basis for NRW reduction; (ii) provision of individual property connections \nto  residents,  especially  the  poor  and  households  headed  by  women;  (iii)  provision  of  24-hour \nwater  supply;  and  (iv)  improvement  of  water  supply  efficiency  by  reducing  NRW  and  energy \nlosses of electromechanical machinery.  \n \n11. \nOutput  4:  Wastewater  system  rehabilitated  and  expanded  in  six  project  cities. \nActivities include (i) rehabilitation and expansion of the sewerage network, including separation \nof  sanitary  sewers  from  drains,  and  property  connections;  (ii)  modernization  and  expansion  of \nwastewater  treatment  plants;  (iii)  use  of  wastewater  as  a  resource,  including  recycling  of \nwastewater,  and  energy  generation  through  sludge  digestion  and  gasification;  (iv)  septage \nmanagement  and  decentralized  wastewater  treatment  systems  in  suitable  areas;  and  (v)  total \nsanitation and solid waste management.  \n \n12. \nOutput  5:  Capacity  building  and  efficient  program  management  implemented. \nActivities  include  (i)  capacity  building  of  urban  institutions  and  municipal  bodies,  (ii)  project \nmanagement, (iii) implementation of a gender equality and social inclusion action plan, and (iv) \nimplementation of a community awareness and participation plan. \n \nD. \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs and Investment and Financing Plans \n\n13. \n The  policy-based  loan  will  provide  budget  support  to  the  state  government  to  finance \nthe policy reforms as outlined in the Government of India\u2019s development policy letter and policy \nmatrix  (Appendixes  3  and  4).  The  size  of  the  policy-based  loan  was  determined  based  on  (i) \nfinancial  support  required  to  prepare,  implement,  and  monitor  the  proposed  policy  actions;  (ii) \nfor  and \nassessment  of \n\nfinancial  resources,  allocation \n\nthe  state  government\u2019s  overall \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ndevelopment  financing  needs  in  the  urban  sector;  (iii)  the  state  government\u2019s  absorptive \ncapacity  demonstrated  through  implementation  of  the  urban  sector  projects;  and  (iv) \nrequirement  of  capacity  building  of  institutions  in  the  urban  sector.14 The  government  of  India \nhas requested a loan of $250 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the \nprogram,  which  the  government  will  relend  to  the  state  government  under  the  same  terms  as \nthe  original  loan.  The  loan  will  have  a  15-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  an \nannual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms \nand  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements.

The  State  of  Rajasthan  acting  through  its  Local  Self  Government \nDepartment  (LSGD)  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  the  Rajasthan  Urban  Infrastructure \nDevelopment  Project  (RUIDP)  will  be  the  implementing  agency.  LSGD  will  be  responsible  for \noverall strategic planning, guidance, and management of the SDP, and for ensuring compliance \nwith the tranche release conditions and loan covenants. A policy support unit will be established \nin  LSGD  to  support  the  state  government  with  implementation  of  the  tranche  release  policy \nactions  under  the  policy-based  loan.  RUIDP  will  be  responsible  for  planning,  implementation, \nmonitoring and supervision, and coordination of all activities under the SDP. RUIDP will recruit \nconsulting firms\u2015project management, design, and supervision consultant (which will also work \nas  the  engineer  for  administration  of  civil  works  contracts),  and  community  awareness  and \nparticipation consultant\u2015using the quality- and cost-based selection method with a quality\u2012cost \nratio  of  90:10  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).

It  will  have  two  outputs  to  support  the \nstate  government:  (i)  urban  institutions  strengthened,  (ii)  urban governance  improved,  and  (iii) \ncapacity building support provided. The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The Government of \nRajasthan  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  space, \nworkshop  venues,  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  LSGD  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the \nTA, and the TA will be implemented over 3 years during SDP implementation.17 \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n18.  Water supply and improved efficiency. RUIDP will work with the state government to \nestablish 24-hour water supply in the major cities in the state, including the five project cities. To \nensure  sustainability  of  operations,  the  SDP  will  implement  a  comprehensive  network \nmanagement plan based on a district metering areas approach for NRW assessment.18 \n \n19. \nSmart  cities  and  economic  corridors.  The  SDP  will  support  development  of  well-\nplanned, ecologically friendly, and technologically integrated smart cities in the state, which are \nlivable,  workable,  and  sustainable. 19  In  addition,  the  SDP  will  implement  a  comprehensive \ninformation technology-based network, including GIS and asset management plan, in the urban \nsector focusing on real time data collection and use in urban operations. The SDP will support \n                                                \n17  Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 A district metering area refers to a zone of a water supply network that can be isolated, and provided with a bulk \nmeter to measure input water quantity and consumer meters to measure consumption. The difference is used for \nassessing NRW in the district metering area. \n\n19  The concept of smart cities is still evolving in India; the SDP will provide timely and suitable mechanism to facilitate \n\ndevelopment and implementation of this new concept.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f        7 \n\nupdating  the  water  and  sewerage  GIS,  which  will  help  improve  operationalization  of  the  NRW \nreduction plan and asset management plan.  \n \n20. \nEnergy-efficient treatment processes and septage management. Under the project, \nwastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) will be constructed with energy-efficient and mechanized \ntreatment processes. The project will support integrated planning and development of WWTPs, \nwhich will include (i) use of wastewater as a resource with recycling of wastewater, and energy \ngeneration  from  sludge  digestion  or  gasification,  wherever  feasible;  (ii)  septage  management; \nand (iii) landscaping, plantation, and information centers in WWTPs sites. \n \n21. \nOperation  and  maintenance  embedded  construction  contracts.  The  project  will \ninclude O&M embedded construction contracts for a sufficiently long period (7\u201210 years), which \nwill mitigate the municipalities\u2019 lack of O&M capacity, improve construction quality by providing \ncontinuity  in  system  operation,  and  obligate  municipalities  to  allocate  adequate  O&M  budget. \nSpecial contract conditions for NRW reduction will be incorporated in the bidding documents. \n \nSanitation  and  solid  waste  management.  Solid  waste  is  frequently  disposed  of  in \n22. \nsewers  and  utility  holes,  causing  blockages,  flooding,  and  problems  for  operations,  or  in  the \nwater bodies. Similarly, open defecation is practiced in many urban areas. The SDP will support \nongoing programs on total sanitation and solid waste management. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n23. \n Economic analysis. The estimated economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) of the five \nwater supply subprojects range from 17.30% to 21.70% and six wastewater subprojects range \nfrom  15.80%  to  25.20%,  higher  than  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital,  estimated  at \n12.0%,  indicating  sufficient  economic  return. 20 The  consolidated  EIRR  is  19.29%  for  water \nsupply subprojects and 18.04% for wastewater subprojects. The results are satisfactory against \nindividual  downside  risks,  including  a  20%  increase  in  capital  expenditure,  20%  increase  in \noperating costs, 20% decrease in benefits, and 1-year delay in project completion.  \n \n24. \nFinancial  analysis. The financial internal rates of return for the project, calculated only \non  the  basis  of  income  from  water  and  sewerage  tariffs,  are  negative  against  a  weighted \naverage  cost  of  capital  of  2.62%  per  annum  since  the  water  tariffs  are  expected  to  recover \npartial  O&M  costs  only.  A  municipal  cash-flow  analysis,  including  revenues  from  property  tax \nand institutionalized  transfers from  the  state government  to municipal  bodies,  is  more  relevant \nand confirms that project cities have the financial capacity to sustain infrastructure and  deliver \nthe services.21 Moreover, the SDP will help municipal bodies in improving financial sustainability \nby    (i)  increasing  revenues  by  rationalizing  the  urban  property  tax,  (ii)  rationalizing  water  and \nsewerage  tariffs,  (iii)  improving  collection  efficiency,  (iv)  recovering  arrears  with  adequate \nprovisioning for bad debts, and (v) computerizing operations and financial management.22 \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to,  and \n25. \ndiscussed  with,  the  governments  of  India  and  Rajasthan,  and  LSGD.  The  specific  policy \n\n                                                \n20 Details  are  included  in  the  Economic  Analysis:  Project  Loan  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\n21 Details are included in the Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Details  are  included  in  the  Economic  Analysis:  Program  Loan  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\nAppendix 2).  \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 15). Based on \nthe risk assessments, some of the mitigation measures incorporated in the SDP design aim to \n(i)  establish  a  mechanism  for  regular  voluntary  disclosure  of  project-related  information  to \nresidents; (ii) develop and update a website to enhance transparency in project implementation, \nprocurement,  and  safeguards;  and  (iii)  establish  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  to  ensure \nquick and effective resolution. The delegation of water supply operations to municipal bodies will \nrequire coordination between the Public Health Engineering Department and municipal bodies. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nUrban  poverty  in  the  state  is  estimated  at  10.7%.23 Poverty  is  more  evident  in  rural \n26. \nareas, but the gravity of poverty in cities is more severe due to lack of access to basic services, \nuncertainty about security of tenure, and concerns about safety in highly populated but insecure \nenvironments. The  project  prioritizes  water  supply  and  sewerage  connections  to  the  poor  and \nhouseholds  headed  by  women.24 The  SDP  will  complement  the  state  government\u2019s  ongoing \nefforts  to  provide  pro-poor  and  gender-inclusive  water  and  sanitation  services  by  (i)  reducing \nconnection  fees  and  facilitating  individual  connections  to  the  poor,  socially  excluded,  and \nhouseholds headed by women, especially in slums; (ii) ensuring project cities are free of open \ndefecation;  (iii)  incorporating  pro-poor  and  gender-sensitive  sanitation  services  in  the  state \ngovernment master plans; and (iv) piloting alternative onsite sanitation. A community awareness \nand participation plan is prepared for widespread, ongoing, and meaningful participation.25 \n \nGender.  The  project  loan  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming. The  gender \n27. \nequality  and  social  inclusion  action  plan  prepared  has  clear  targets,  responsibilities,  and \nresource  allocation.26 RUIDP  will  implement  the  action  plan,  and  community  awareness  and \nparticipation  plan  with  support  from  the  community  awareness  and  participation  consultant, \nnongovernment organizations, and water and sanitation committees of municipal bodies. \n\n \n\nE. \n\n \nSafeguards \n\n28. \nSocial  safeguards.  The  project  loan  is  classified  as  category  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement  and  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples.  The  project  does  not  involve  permanent \nland acquisition or physical displacement. Families of scheduled tribes living in the project cities \nare  mainstreamed  with  the  general  population.  Draft  resettlement  plans  prepared  for  the  six \nproject  cities  are  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  to  address \ntemporary  livelihood  impacts. 27 The  plans  will  be  finalized  and  disclosed  at  the  time  of  the \ndetailed  engineering  design.  The  resettlement  framework  prepared  will  guide  RUIDP  on  an \nadditional component in Pali, targeting industrial effluent treatment and disposal, and expected \nto  have  limited  resettlement  impacts.28 Meaningful  and  widespread  consultations  will  continue \nwith  all  communities  in  the  project  area,  and  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  will  be \nestablished. The policy-based loan is not anticipated to have social safeguards impacts.29 \n \n                                                \n23  Government of India, Planning Commission. 2013.

The  project  will  support \nenvironmental  regulatory  standards  by  (i)  enforcing  domestic  sewage  discharge  standards,  \n(ii)  monitoring  the  quality  of  discharge  to  water  bodies,  (iii)  providing  a  properly  equipped \nlaboratory, (iv) enforcing pretreatment of industrial effluent before discharging, (v) developing a \nseptage management plan, and (vi) processing and disposing of sludge and screenings.  \n \n31. \nNatural  disasters  and  climate  change.  Climate  change  projections  indicate  an \nincrease of 2.40\u00ba Celsius during 2071\u20132100 in Rajasthan.32 Mean annual rainfall is predicted to \ndecrease  slightly;  extreme  rainfall  is  expected  to  increase  in frequency  and  intensity.  The  key \nrisk  factors  are  frequent  droughts,  extremely  low  and  erratic  rainfall,  and  very  limited  surface \nwater  sources  resulting in greater  dependence on groundwater resources. The  SDP  will  focus \non  NRW  reduction  and  water  use  efficiency,  improved  sewerage  collection,  treatment,  and \nenergy generation; and adaptation measures for risks related to earthquakes, landslides, floods, \nand  climate  change.  Detailed  design  of  the  project  components  will  consider  findings  from \nongoing climate change analysis models. \n  \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n32.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.33 The  fiduciary  risk  for  the  program  loan  is \nmedium; the state government\u2019s public financial management systems are adequate to mitigate \nsuch risks. The integrated project benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n\n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nDelays in project \nimplementation, including \navailability of clear sites, may \nresult in cost and time \noverruns. \nLack of coordination among \nvarious agencies may result in \nsuboptimal outcomes. \nThe state government may not \nimplement the proposed \ninstitutional and staffing \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nLSGD and UDH will assign qualified staff to RUIDP and minimize staff turnover. \nThe project management, design, and supervision consultant will support project \nmanagement, safeguards, reporting, and training on FIDIC contracts.
