Between  1980  and  2000, \nPRC achieved a quadrupling of its gross domestic product (GDP) with only a doubling of energy \nconsumption,  effectively  decoupling  the  relationship  between  economic  growth  and  energy \nconsumption.  However,  during  PRC\u2019s  transition  to  a  market-based  economy,  many  of  the \ncountry\u2019s  energy  efficiency  programs  were  dismantled  between  2001  and  2005.  Since  2001, \naccordingly,  energy  use  has  outpaced  economic  growth,  with  elasticity  reaching  1.6  in  2004. \nThe growth in energy consumption moderated to some extent in 2005 but averaged a high 9.5% \nyearly in 2000\u20132005, only slightly lower than GDP growth, resulting in elasticity of just under 1, \nversus the 0.4\u20130.5 in 1980\u20132000. Continuation of this 1:1 ratio of energy consumption to GDP, \ngiven  the  PRC\u2019s  stated  goal  of  again  quadrupling  GDP  in  2000\u20132020,  will  lead  to  significant \ndemand for energy, most of it coal-based; 82% of electricity is now produced by burning coal. \nThe resulting local, national, and global environmental impact could be substantial. \n \nThe  current  energy  path  is  neither  environmentally  nor  economically  sustainable. \n3. \nIncreasing the efficiency of energy use, to wring more service value from each primary energy \nunit consumed, has large environmental and economic benefit. Energy efficiency is essential, to \nreduce  global  emissions  of  GHGs,  ease  growth  in  fossil  energy  demand  and  the  upward \npressure  on  energy  prices,  and  improve  energy  security.  Investments  in  energy  efficiency \ntechnologies  in  the  rapidly  growing  economies  are  required,  to  prevent  being  locked  into  an \nenergy-intensive  capital  stock  in  the  future.  The  benefits  of  energy  efficiency  are  described  in \nAppendix 2.  \n\n2. \n\nDemand-Side Efficiency Potential \n\n \n \n4. \nEnergy efficiency means delivering services with less primary energy. Energy efficiency \nprojects  are  defined  as  economic  investments  in  energy  equipment  and  infrastructure  that \ndeliver higher useful energy outputs or services. Reducing energy use creates a compounded \nefficiency increase throughout the energy value chain. This is evident in the case of electricity, \nwhere  overall  network  and  system  losses  and  inefficiencies,  from  production  to  end-use,  100 \nunits of input energy to only 9.5 units of actual energy service at the point of end use. As such, a \nsmall increase in demand-side efficiency will reverse the compounding losses. It results in both \nlower  energy  consumption  and  reduced  emissions  of  GHGs.  The  technical  and  economic \n\n \n\n\fpotential exists to save 20\u201340% of energy use, with cost-effective investments in a broad range \nof applications, such as in motors, which account for about 50% of power use, heating and air-\nconditioning, controls, water supply, lighting, and efficient combustion systems. \n \nImprovements  in  demand-side  efficiency  are  required  across  all  sectors\u2014commercial, \n5. \nindustrial,  governmental,  agricultural,  residential,  and  transport.  In  addition,  specific  electricity \nconsumption in the products is much higher in the PRC compared with international standards. \nTo achieve its economic and environmental target, the PRC needs to attract a huge investment \nin energy efficiency technologies and practices. The Energy Research Institute of the National \nDevelopment and Reform Commission estimates the investment needs by 2010 to be at least \n$120\u2013$160 billion.  \n \n\n3. \n\nPolicies and Regulations \n\n \n6. \nImproving  energy  efficiency  has  been  a  cornerstone  of  the  PRC\u2019s  energy  policy  for \n20 years. In the 1980s, the Government employed a monitoring and quota mechanism through \nthe  planned  economy  to  promote  energy  conservation  and  curtail  at  least  the  most  blatant \ncases of energy waste. As recently as the 1990s the number of energy efficiency projects that \nreceived  funding  was  determined  by  a  top-down  approach  that  largely  depended  on  state \nsubsidies. State-owned banks were instructed to finance projects selected by the Government.  \n \n7. \nWhen the PRC began its transition toward a market economy, however, the Government \nmade  significant  changes  that  affected  energy  efficiency.  It  reformed  the  banking  sector, \nliberalized energy prices, and phased out subsidies for energy efficiency projects. \n \n8. \nFaced with the recent energy intensity increase since 2001, the Government recognizes \nthe urgency to invest in and significantly improve energy efficiency. From its previous emphasis \non  energy  exploitation,  the  national  energy  policy  now  assigns  top  priority  to  energy \nconservation and energy efficiency. Expanding investment in energy efficiency projects, among \nothers,  is  a  high  priority  for  environmental  sustainability  and  enterprise  competitiveness.  The \nGovernment seeks to promote market-based methods to deliver and finance energy efficiency \nprojects, in partnership with the private sector.  \n \n9. \nThe  11th  Five-Year  Plan  (2006\u20132010)  strengthens  the  policy  orientation  to  energy \nconservation,  high-efficiency  use,  and  energy  security.  The  large  energy  efficiency  potential  is \nseen  as  a  great  opportunity  to  obtain  some  flexibility  in  the  PRC\u2019s  dependency  on  external \nsources of energy. By the end of this period, the Government aims to improve energy intensity \nby  20%  and  reduce  sulfur  dioxide  (SO2)  emissions  by  10%  compared  with  2005  levels. \nAchieving these targets requires major policy changes that would both revitalize investment in \nenergy  efficiency  throughout  the  PRC  and  encourage  the  shift  to  less  energy-intensive  and \nmore  economically  productive  sectors.  A  number  of  steps  have  been  taken  to  support  this \ntarget.  The  Medium-  and  Long-Term  Energy  Conservation  Plan  highlights  key  sectors  and \nprovides  a  conceptual  road  map  for  improving  energy  efficiency.  The  plan  puts  forward  10 \nspecific  types  of  energy  efficiency  projects,  and  identifies  the  industry,  transport,  and  building \nsectors  as  having  the  most  potential  for  energy  efficiency  improvement.  In  addition,  energy \nefficiency  is  granted  special  attention  along  with  energy  development  in  all  energy-related \nplanning  by  the  Government.  The  Energy  Conservation  Law  is  being  revised  and  a \ncomprehensive Energy Law is expected to be in effect by 2008.  \n \n10. \nFurthermore,  the  PRC\u2019s  highest  governing  bodies  have  made  resource  conservation  a \nstrategic  focal  point  for  future  economic  development.  The  State  Council  has  called  for  the \n\n 2 \n \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nestablishment  of  a  \u201cresource-saving  society\u201d  and  emphasized  every  citizen\u2019s  duty  to  conserve \nenergy  and  other  resources.  National  standards  are  being  developed  for  energy  efficiency \nmonitoring and evaluation, verification, and labeling.  \n\nB. \n\nEnergy Efficiency Financing \n\n11. \nDespite the recent policy shift in favor of energy efficiency, market barriers still limit the \nexpansion of energy efficiency projects. One of the key bottlenecks is lack of access to finance. \nThe reluctance of banks to finance energy efficiency projects is often cited as a key obstacle to \nscaling up energy efficiency project implementation. According to recent surveys and comments \nobtained  through  ADB\u2019s  Energy  Efficiency  Initiative  (EEI)  consultation  process,  the  main \nreasons why financially viable energy efficiency projects fail to attract commercial bank loans in \nthe PRC are summarized as follows: \n \n\nEnergy  efficiency  projects  involve  a  wide  range  of  technologies  with  which  the \ncommercial  banks  are  often  unfamiliar.  There  is  gap  in  energy  efficiency \nknowledge  and  misperceptions  of  actual  technology  risks.  Commercial  banks \nhave  not  yet  developed  sufficient  technical  knowledge  and  experience.  No \nspecific  training  system  exists.  As  a  result,  that  there  is  little  marketing, \nevaluation, and structuring of energy efficiency projects. \n\nManagement  awareness  about  energy  efficiency  financing  is  low,  and  no \neffective  financing  model  for  energy  efficiency  projects  has  been  developed  in \nthe  market.  Few  management  resources  have  therefore  been  allocated  for  this \npurpose. \n\nThe  due  diligence  costs  associated  with  energy  efficiency  projects  are  high \nbecause of the need for technical evaluation regardless of the project size. \n\nAvailability of medium- and long-term loans, even for 3\u20135 years, is very limited. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n  \n(iii) \n\n  \n(iv) \n \n(v) \n\nThe  local  banking  sector  is  highly  liquid,  but  financing  is  often  based  on  high \ncollateralization,  making  it  difficult  for  energy  end  users  to  raise  financing. \nSubstantial  credit  enhancement  is  needed  to  meet  the  security  requirements  of \nlocal commercial banks. \n\n \n12. \nA window of opportunity exists for ADB to make a real impact in this sector in the PRC. \nBy  mobilizing  available  domestic  funds  in  an  effective  investment  program,  ADB  can  help \nsupport  energy  efficiency  investment  and  create  better  awareness  among  commercial  banks. \nThe program approach, broad in reach, will enable ADB to provide financing support for a large \nnumber of energy efficiency projects, which are often too small for ADB to finance directly.  \n\nC. \n\nADB\u2019s Operations \n\n1. \n\nCountry Strategy \n\n \n13. \nADB\u2019s  country  strategy  for  the  PRC  is  based  on  four  development  objectives: \n(i) equitable  and  inclusive  growth,  (ii)  better  and  more  efficient  markets,  (iii)  environmental \nimprovements, and (iv) regional cooperation.  \n \n\n \n\n\fTo support the initiatives taken by the Government to let the private sector contribute as \n14. \nthe  driving  force  for  long-term  economic  growth  and  job  creation,  ADB  plans  to  substantially \nincrease  its  private  sector  operations  in  the  PRC,  particularly  in  the  infrastructure  and  energy \nsectors, the financial sector, and environmental improvements. In the infrastructure and energy \nsectors, ADB prioritizes pioneering projects with innovative contractual and financial structuring \nto encourage private sector participation and enhance management expertise.  \n\n2. \n\nMedium-Term Strategy II  \n\n15. \nADB\u2019s Medium-Term Strategy II (2006\u20132008) seeks more directly to help DMCs acquire \nlow-carbon technologies, and to implement energy efficiency and renewable energy projects to \nenable  Asia  to  take  the  technology  leap.  Catalyzing  investment  to  improve  the  investment \nclimate, expanding private sector operations, and managing the environment are also priorities. \n\n3. \n\nEnergy Sector Strategy \n\n16. \nADB\u2019s  energy  sector  strategy  supports,  as  operational  priorities,  (i)  poverty  reduction, \nthrough  such  means  as  energy  infrastructure  development  for  sustainable  economic  growth, \nand  increased  access  to  energy  for  the  poor,  particularly  in  rural  areas;  (ii)  private  sector \ninvolvement,  through  energy  sector  restructuring  and  the  creation  of  an  enabling  environment \nfor the private sector to invest and operate; (iii) regional and global environment impact, through \nmeasures  that  address  acid  rain  problems  and  promote  the  use  of  clean  energy;  and  (iv) \nregional  cooperation.  The  ongoing  review  of  ADB\u2019s  energy  policy  is  expected  to  recommend \ngreater focus on energy efficiency. \n\n4. \n\nThe Energy Efficiency Initiative \n\nADB\u2019s EEI aims to expand ADB operations in energy efficiency and clean energy to at \n\n17. \nleast $1 billion a year, according to the general framework for the implementation of EEI.  \n \n18. \nThe  EEI  task  force  has identified  the  PRC  as  a  priority  DMC  with  the highest  potential \namong DMCs in Asia and the Pacific for energy efficiency and clean energy investments. The \ntask  force  has  been  holding  consultative  meetings  in  the  PRC  to  learn  firsthand  from  energy \nefficiency  market  stakeholders\u2019  about  immediate  investment  opportunities  and  barriers  in  the \nPRC  market  as  a  prerequisite  for  developing  energy  efficiency  projects.  EEI  consultations \nconfirmed  many  different  approaches  are  needed  to  tap  various  segments  with  significant \nenergy efficiency potential. ADB has developed several projects under the EEI in the PRC. In its \npublic  sector  operations,  ADB  is  working  with  a  provincial  government  to  provide  a  financial \nintermediation  loan  to  a  provincial  trust  company  to  finance  energy  efficiency  in  the  industrial \nsector  (multitranche  financing  facility  for  the  Guangdong  Energy  Efficiency  and  Environment \nImprovement Investment Program). In the private sector, in addition to the proposed Program, \nADB has called for proposals from private equity funds interested in equity investment in clean \nenergy and energy efficiency projects in the region. \n \n19. \nThe  proposed  Program  responds  to  a  request  from  EEI  task  force  to  design  and \nimplement a new risk-sharing methodology in order to facilitate investments in energy efficiency \nprojects. Ongoing consultation with a wide range of stakeholders has enabled ADB to develop \nthe Program as a pilot project to address the financing needs of a series of small and medium \nscale energy efficiency projects.  \n\n 4 \n \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nA. \n \nThe  impact  of  the  Program  is  to  expand  private  sector  investment  in  energy  efficiency \n20. \nprojects in the PRC by developing the energy efficiency financing activities of qualified financial \ninstitutions (Partner Banks), thereby achieving energy efficiency improvements and associated \nreduction  in  the  growth  of  GHGs  and  other  pollutants.  To  achieve  this  objective,  the  Program \nwill provide PCGs that will enable commercial banks to offer energy end users access to energy \nefficiency financing at reliable and reasonable terms and conditions.  \n \n21. \nEnergy  efficiency  investments  are  needed  in  a  range  of  market  segments  and  each \nsector  has  distinct  credit  characteristics  and  investment  needs.  Since  the  commercial  banks \nhave limited experience in energy efficiency financing, the Program will focus on a specific area \nto accelerate learning among the banks. Consultations have led to the selection of the energy \nefficiency of buildings as the initial target market on the basis of market potential as well as the \ncommercial  banks\u2019  interest,  appetite,  and  capacity.  Energy  efficiency  of  buildings  can  be \nachieved  with  proven  technologies  and  has  significant  improvement  potential.  Yet  this  market \nhas  been  neglected  because  of  relatively  more  attention  being  focused  on  improving  industry \nenergy  efficiency.  Urban  areas  are  responsible  for  about  75%  of  all  energy  use  and  GHG \nemission in the world. Buildings account for nearly 40% of GHG emissions worldwide. Improving \nenergy efficiency in buildings with appropriate technologies locks in the pattern of energy use for \nmany  years.  Given  the  PRC\u2019s  rapid  urbanization,  energy  efficiency  of  buildings  will  have \nlong-lasting  and  large  cumulative  impact.  The  Program  will  provide  energy  end  users  with \naccess  to  the  necessary  funds  to  retrofit  existing  buildings  with  energy-saving  improvements \nand install energy-efficient products in their buildings, typically leading to energy savings of 20\u2013\n40%. \n\nB. \n\nDescription \n\n1. \n\nThe Program \n\n \n22. \nThe Program will set up systems and framework agreements to provide energy end user \nwith  increased  access  to  finance  for  energy  efficiency  projects  that  have  so  far  not  been  fully \naddressed through local financing. ADB will provide a PCG to each Partner Bank to cover the \ncredit risks associated with energy efficiency projects, thereby mobilizing their funds for energy \nefficiency  projects.  The  lack  of  technical  competence  among  commercial  banks  to  make  a \ntechnical  assessment  of  energy  efficiency  projects  is  a  key  bottleneck.  Thus,  combining  the \ntechnical skills of a private sector energy management company (Technical Partner) with ADB \nrisk-sharing is a key innovation under the Program.  \n \n23. \nEach energy efficiency project financed by a Partner Bank under the Program will benefit \nfrom  comprehensive  technical  input  from  the  Technical  Partner  throughout  the  project  cycle. \nThe  Technical  Partner  will  take  the  lead  in  marketing,  energy  audit,  technical  due  diligence, \nsetting the energy policy for end users, and equipment procurement. The Technical Partner will \nsource  the  projects  to  be  financed  by  a  Partner  Bank  for  credit  assessment  and  further  due \ndiligence.  Each  eligible  energy  efficiency  loan  is  subject  to  detailed  technical  review  by  the \nTechnical Partner and credit assessment and approval by the relevant Partner Bank. \n\n \n\n\f 6 \n \n\nC. \n\nThe Credit Guarantee  \n\nRationale \n\n1. \n \nCommercial  banks  in  the  PRC  tend  to  lend  mainly  against  fixed  asset  collateral  as \n24. \nopposed  to  the  prospective  project  cash  flow  and  debt  service  capacity.  This  approach  often \nlimits the market for commercial bank financing. Because of lack of experience, the banks often \nperceive the risk of lending for energy efficiency purposes to be higher than the actual risks. The \nProgram is intended to help close this gap. It will support projects that are viable but lack access \nto  finance  under  current  lending  practices.  Energy  efficiency  projects  can  often  pay  for \nthemselves from energy cost savings, but these projects generally lack collateral value, as the \nequipment is engineered for and installed at the energy user\u2019s facilities and is difficult to remove \nand  use  economically  in  other  locations.  The  Program  will  help  address  this  barrier  to  energy \nefficiency finance by providing a substitute for collateral value, allowing the commercial banks to \nunderwrite  financing  on  the  basis  of  the  economic  merits  and  cash  flows  of  energy  efficiency \nprojects. With the credit enhancement tool to be provided by the Program, Partner Banks can \nprudently  extend  their  risk  horizons,  enter  new  markets,  and  offer  loans  for  energy  efficiency \nprojects at reliable and reasonable terms and conditions. \n \n\n2. \n\nScope of the Guarantee \n\n25. \nEach PCG will cover an agreed portion of the principal amount financed by the relevant \nPartner  Bank  under  the  relevant  energy  efficiency  loans.  ADB\u2019s  aggregate  liability  under  the \nProgram will be limited to CNY800 million. ADB will agree on the lending selection criteria and \nrisk management process with each Partner Bank. Once ADB is satisfied with the record of a \nPartner Bank and its borrowers, portfolio targets may be revised to encourage the Partner Bank \nto expand to new customer segments.  \n \n\n3. \n\nEligibility Criteria and Use of Proceeds \n\n26. \nThe  PCG  covers  both  the  retrofitting  of  existing  buildings  with  energy  efficiency \ntechnology  and  equipment  and  also  the  financing  of  new  buildings,  such  as  green  buildings, \nwith  improved  arrangements  for  more  efficient  energy  use.  The  Program  will  consider  energy \nefficiency projects that (i) have energy efficiency potential, as confirmed through an energy audit \nby the Technical Partner; and (ii) are creditworthy, as evaluated and approved by the applicable \nPartner  Bank.  Eligible  energy  efficiency  projects  will  be  selected  according  to  the  preagreed \nminimum criteria. These eligibility criteria and procedures will be adopted by each Partner Bank. \nEnergy  efficiency  loans  that  involve  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  will  not  be  considered. \nLoans  provided  under  the  Program  will  be  used  to  fund  all  costs  associated  with  energy \nefficiency  projects:  (i)  energy  equipment  and  systems,  (ii)  installation  costs;  (iii)  engineering \ncosts; (iv) financing costs and fees; and (v) project development costs. \n \n\nD. \n\nProgram Implementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nSelection and Approval of Partner Banks \n\n \n27. \nPartner Banks will be selected at the sole discretion of ADB. Before final selection, each \nPartner  Bank  will  be  subject  to  detailed  due  diligence  and  credit  analysis.  The  standardized \ncredit  review  of  each  Partner  Bank  will  include  an  analysis  of  capital  adequacy,  asset  quality, \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nliquidity, connected or large lending, and profitability. It will also include a review of ownership, \nintegrity,  governance,  money  laundering  controls,  credit  approval  process,  and  operating \ncapacity.  \n\n \n\n3. \n\nReporting and Management \n\n28. \nEach Partner Bank will be required to follow a pre-agreed and standardized format both \nfor loan documentation and for regular reporting. It must promptly notify ADB of any defaults in \nthe portfolio.  \n\nIV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACT, AND RISKS \n\n \n\nJustification \n\n \nA. \n \n29. \nThe  Program  is  justified  by  its  development  impact  and  demonstration  effects.  It \nsupports  the  Government\u2019s  development  plans,  ADB\u2019s  operational  strategies,  and  the  value \nadded of ADB\u2019s participation.  \n \n\nThe  Program  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  policy  of  promoting  a  resource-\nsaving  society  by  bridging  the  gap  between  the  substantial  level  of  investment \nrequired  in  energy  efficiency  projects  and  the  limited  financing  capacity  of \ncommercial  banks.  It  addresses  and  is  aligned  with  the  Government\u2019s  strategic \npriorities for energy and environment as set forth in the 11th Five-Year Plan.  \n\nThe  Program  will  embody  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy \nthe  PRC,  which \nemphasizes  supporting  environmental  improvement.  The  Program  introduces  a \nnew  mechanism  for  efficiently  addressing  demand-side  energy  management, \nwhich  helps  to  arrest  environmental  degration,  and  advance  sustainable \ndevelopment without sacrificing the standard of living. \n\nfor \n\nThe  Program  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  operations  policy  in  the \nPRC,  which  is  focused  on  the  infrastructure  and  energy  sectors,  the  financial \nsector,  and  environmental  improvements.  This  Program  contributes  to  the \nintroduction  and \ntechnology  and  management \nknow-how to be used in dealing with energy management in the PRC.  \n\ntransfer  of  state-of-the-art \n\nThe Program is in line with ADB\u2019s energy sector strategy, which recommends a \nreorientation  of  energy  sector  activities \nto  address  regional  and  global \nenvironmental  impact.  By  introducing  energy  efficiency,  the  Program  will \ncontribute  to  mitigating  climate  change.  The  proposed  guarantee  structure  is  a \nmulti-obligor  guarantee  in  local  currency  with  a  clear  thematic  intervention  for \nenergy efficiency, consistent with ADB\u2019s credit enhancement operations policy. \n\nThe  Program  will  embody  ADB\u2019s  EEI  and  Innovation  and  Efficiency  Initiative, \nwhich  recommends  the  introduction  of  new  forms  of  cofinancing  through  active \nrisk-sharing with commercial financing partners.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n \n\nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact  \n\n30. \nThe Program is designed to promote economic growth and environmental improvement \nin the PRC  through improved energy efficiency. The impacts of improving energy efficiency in \nthe  PRC  will  decrease  in  the  growth  rate  of  GHG  emissions,  increase  energy  services,  and \nimprove energy security. Specifically, the Program will (i) demonstrate the potential for energy \nefficiency  in  retrofitted  and  new  buildings,  which  are  untapped  areas  of  energy  efficiency,  and \nset  standards  for  competitors  to  follow;  (ii)  improve  global  and  local  environmental  conditions \nthrough  improved  energy  efficiency;  (iii)  support  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  build  a  resource-\nsaving  society  through  private  sector  participation;  (iv)  help  remove  barriers  to  investments  in \nenergy  efficiency,  thereby  promoting  enterprise  competitiveness  and  economic  growth;  and \n(v) demonstrate that energy efficiency projects are bankable and encourage the private sector \nto invest in energy efficiency beyond the Program\u2019s intervention. \n \n31. \nThe  development  impact  of  the  Program  will  be  assessed  and  described  from  the \nperspective of development effectiveness and Program framework, and its contribution to both \neconomic sustainability and private sector development as per guidelines for the implementation \nof  the  Good  Practice  Standards  for  Evaluation  of  Private  Sector  Investment  Operations \nprepared  by  the  Evaluation  Cooperation  Group  of  the  multilateral  development  banks.  It  is \ndeemed  to  be  developmentally  effective,  and  its  performance  measurable.  A  summary \ndiscussion of each of these assessment parameters follows. \n\n \n\n1. \n\nProgram Performance \n\n32. \nThe  Program  will  be  assessed  against  its  specific  investment  capital,  operational  and \nfinancial  objectives.  Effectiveness  will  be  measured  in  terms  of  how  successfully  the  Program \nattracts private sector investment in energy efficiency, and leads to annual energy savings and \nreductions in GHG emissions.  \n\n2. \n\nEconomic Sustainability \n\nThe  Program  will  be  assessed  for  economic  sustainability,  by  evaluating  its  ability  to \n33. \ndevelop  and  implement  energy  efficiency  infrastructure  and  contribute  to  sustainable  growth. \nThe  Program\u2019s  successful  implementation  will  promote  retrofitted  and  green  buildings  in  the \nPRC. \n \n\n3. \n\nPrivate Sector Development \n\n \nThe  Program  will  be  assessed  by  its  contribution  to  private  sector  development.  This \n34. \nassessment will focus on the Program\u2019s commercial and financial viability, and its demonstrative \nand catalytic effect on future private sector participation in energy efficiency and the economy \nas a whole. \n \n35. \nThe  Program  will  not  be  specifically  assessed  from  an  investment  profitability  point  of \nview, as a profitability assessment is better gauged and measured against a portfolio of similar \nloans  and  equity  investments.  Similarly,  the  Program  will  not  be  assessed  and  measured \nagainst overall operational effectiveness, as this is a department-wide consideration.  \n \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nC. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n\n1. \n\nADB Safeguards \n\n \nThe Program has been classified environmental category FI and assigned as category C \n36. \nwith respect to indigenous people and resettlement. Each Partner Bank will set up and maintain \nan environmental management system (EMS) for new projects and build capacity to implement \nthe  system.  At  least  one  bank  officer  will  attend  ADB-sponsored  training  in  environmental \nmanagement.  \n\n2. \n\nClean Development Mechanism \n\nEnergy  savings  provide  an  environmentally  sound  solution  to  reduce  GHG  emissions \n37. \nsuch as carbon dioxide (CO2) and have the potential to generate carbon credits under the Clean \nDevelopment  Mechanism  (CDM).  The  CDM  is  a  market-based  arrangement  under  the  Kyoto \nProtocol  that  allows  industrialized  countries  with  GHG  reduction  commitment  to  purchase \ncarbon  credits  from  developing  countries  to  meet  their  commitment.  The  Program  will  support \nthe energy end users in exploring possibilities for generating carbon revenue from their projects \nduring the feasibility studies, and will also seek assistance from ADB\u2019s Carbon Market Initiative \nfor  this  purpose.  The  additional  carbon  revenue  will  assist  in  removing  the  barriers  to  energy \nefficiency projects. \n\nD. \n\nAnticorruption Policy; Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of \nTerrorism \n\n38. \nEach Partner Bank will be advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate)  and  the  policy  relating  to  the  Combating  of  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of \nTerrorism  (2003).  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB will require each Partner Bank to institute, maintain, and comply with internal \nprocedures and controls following international best practice standards for preventing corruption \nor  money  laundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain \nfrom engaging in such activities. The credit guarantee documentation between ADB and each \nPartner  Bank  will  further  allow  ADB  to  investigate  any  violation  or  potential  violation  of  these \nundertakings. \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n39. \nConsistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Articles of \nAgreement),  the  Government  will  be  requested  to  confirm  that  it  has  no  objection  to  the \nproposed  assistance  to  the  Program.  No  funds  will  be  disbursed  until  ADB  receives  such \nconfirmation.  \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  credit  guarantee  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \n40. \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the absence of the President, \nunder the provisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the

The  slowdown  in \nCO2 emissions will help reduce the adverse impact of climate change and promote sustainable \neconomic  growth.  Such  impact  merits  support  from  both  developed  and  developing  countries. \nThe rationale for energy efficiency must be firmly established to sustain political will and long-\nterm  investment  focus  at  the  required  scale.  Investments  in  energy  efficiency  can  be  justified \nand  pursued  to  the  extent  of  their  economic  merits.  This  is  known  as  the  no-regrets  strategy, \nwhich  means  that  making  energy  efficiency  investments  that  are  economically  viable  now, \nirrespective  of  their  long-term  environmental  benefits,  can  later  create  no  regrets  if  predicted \nclimate change impacts do not occur.  \n \nEnergy  efficiency  has  a  large  technical  and  economic  potential,  at  a  scale  that  can \n2. \ncontribute substantially to meeting future demands for energy services. The economy does not \nneed  energy  per  se,  but  rather  energy  services\u2014transport,  heating,  cooling,  drive  power, \nrefrigeration,  pumping,  lighting,  etc.  Energy  efficiency  means  delivering  the  services  with  less \nprimary  energy.  Technological  development  already  does  this;  over  the  years  the  energy \nintensity in industrialized countries has substantially improved. The International Energy Agency \nhas  argued  that  energy  efficiency  needs  to  be  viewed  like  other  energy  sources;  it  estimates \nthat  without  the  energy  savings  in  the  25-year  period  from  1973  to  1998,  the  Organisation  for \nEconomic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD)  countries  would  have  been  almost  50% \nhigher,  which  makes  the  contribution  of  energy  efficiency  greater  than  that  of  oil  and  coal. \nFurther,  energy  efficiency  can  be  exploited  faster,  more  cheaply,  and  with  employment  that \ngenerates domestic economic growth and investment. \n\nB. \n\nEnergy Efficiency Benefits \n\n3. \nCapital Stock Turnover Rates. Each investment in infrastructure for energy supply and \nenergy-using  equipment  locks  in  the  pattern  of  primary  energy  use  for  many  years. \nInfrastructure  for  energy-intensive  industries  such  as  steel,  cement,  aluminum,  and  power \ngeneration  and  transmission,  lasts  20\u201340  years.  It  follows  that  energy  efficiency  investments \nwould also have a long-lived and large cumulative impact. \n \n4. \nMacroeconomic  Benefits.  Energy  efficiency  reduces  fossil  fuel  consumption,  thereby \nlowering fossil fuel imports (saving foreign currency) and trade deficits, reducing vulnerability to \noil price volatility, and improving overall international competitiveness (in the face of high energy \nprices).  Employment  and  domestic  job  growth  are  also  associated  with  energy  efficiency. \nMarket-wide  declines  in  fossil  fuel  demand  can  create  a  downward  pressure  on  international \nfuel  prices,  or  diminish  upward  price  trends,  resulting  in  lower  or  more  stable  prices  to  the \nbenefit of the region\u2019s economies, which are generally net fossil fuel consumers. \n \n5. \nefficiency reduces urban air pollution and generates quantifiable public health benefits.  \n \n\nAir Pollution and Health. When linked to a reduction in coal use in urban areas, energy \n\n                                                 \n \n1  Based on ADB. 2006. Report on Energy Efficiency Initiative. Manila. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n15 \n\nEnterprise  Benefits. Energy efficiency results in economic benefits to energy users at \n6. \nthe enterprise level. Many energy efficiency projects have compelling economics, with savings \nof 20\u201340% of energy use in a given application and simple payback periods in the range of 2\u20133 \nyears.  Yet  these  investments  have  remained  largely  undeveloped  because  of  various  market \nand  institutional  barriers.  By  reducing  energy  use  per  unit  of  output  or  service  delivered, \nenterprises save money, reduce maintenance costs, increase productivity, and improve product \nquality (energy efficiency often involves upgrading technology). \n \nAchieving  the  Development  Goals  of  Developing  Member  Countries.  Energy \n7. \nefficiency  projects  can  contribute  to  reducing  poverty  and  meeting  the  development  goals  of \ndeveloping  member  countries  because  they  are  often  the  least-cost  means  for  expanding \nenergy  services  and  allowing  the  population  to  enjoy  a  high  quality  of  life  with  less  primary \nresource consumption overall\u2014a key to long-term sustainability. \n\n \n\n\f16     Appendix 3 \n\nGOVERNMENT POLICIES AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK \n\nTop-Down Energy Efficiency Policy \n\nA. \n \nImproving energy efficiency has been a cornerstone of the energy policy of the People\u2019s \n1. \nRepublic  of  China  (PRC)  for  20  years.  In  the  1980s,  the  Government  employed  a  monitoring \nand  quota  mechanism  through  the  planned  economy  to  promote  energy  conservation  and \ncurtail  at  least  the  most  blatant  cases  of  energy  waste.  As  late  as  the  1990s  the  number  of \nenergy  efficiency  projects  that  received  funding  was  determined  by  a  top-down  approach  that \ndepended  largely  on  state  subsides.  State-owned  banks  were  instructed  to  finance  projects \nselected by the Government. The Energy Conservation Law, passed in 1997, was intended to \nfacilitate  energy  saving,  improve  the  efficiency  of  energy  use,  protect  the  environment,  and \nguarantee national economic and social development. It calls for increased efficiency of energy \nuse and encourages the development and use of new sources of energy. Accordingly, energy-\nusing  entities  must  \u201cstrengthen  energy  management,  and  formulate  and  implement  technical \nmeasures  for  energy  savings.\u201d  The  Circular  of  the  State  Council  on  the  View  of  Further \nDeveloping  the  Comprehensive  Resource  Utilization  (Guo  Fa,  August  1996,  No.  36)  is \nsupplementary to the law and emphasizes the key field of energy conservation.  \n \nWhen the PRC began its transition toward market economy, however, the Government \n2. \nmade  a  variety  of  significant  changes  that  affected  energy  efficiency.  It  reformed  the  banking \nsector, liberalizing energy prices, and phasing out subsidies for energy efficiency projects.  \n\nB. \n\nMarket-Based Energy Efficiency Policy \n\n3. \nFaced with the recent energy intensity increase since 2001, the Government recognizes \nthe  urgency  of  the  need  for  significant  improvements  and  investments  in  energy  efficiency.  A \nshift  in  the  national  energy  policy  has  assigned  first  priority  to  energy  conservation  and \nimproved  energy  efficiency  from  the  previous  emphasis  on  energy  exploitation.  Expanded \ninvestment  in  energy  efficiency  projects,  among  others,  is  a  high  priority  for  environmental \nsustainability and enterprise competitiveness. The Government seeks to promote market-based \nmethods to deliver and finance energy efficiency projects, in partnership with the private sector.  \n \n4. \nThe  10th  Five-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005)  set  the  goals  of  improving  the  energy \ninfrastructure,  increasing  the  share  of  energy  provided  by  natural  gas,  and  reducing  coal  use \nthrough various measures, including energy conservation and efficiency.  \n \n5. \nThe  11th  Five-Year  Plan  (2006\u20132010)  further  strengthens  the  policy  orientation  toward \nenergy  conservation,  high-efficiency  use,  and  energy  security.  The  high  energy  efficiency \npotential is seen as a great opportunity to obtain some flexibility in the country\u2019s dependency on \nexternal sources of energy. By the end of the plan period, the PRC Government aims to achieve \na  20%  improvement  in  energy  intensity  compared  with  2005  levels.  Achieving  this  target \nrequires  major  policy  changes  that  would  both  revitalize  investment  in  energy  efficiency \nthroughout  the  PRC  and  encourage  the  shift  to  less  energy-intensive  and  more  economically \nproductive sectors. The plan aims to achieve structural, technical, and management of energy \nconservation  through  an  optimized  industrial  structure,  wide  use  of  energy  conservation \ntechnology,  and  strengthened  systems \ntransportation,  and \nconsumption  industries  and  other  industries.  Chapter  12  of  the  plan,  related  to  the  energy \nindustry,  emphasizes  pluralistic  and  optimal  development  to  secure  a  stable,  economically \nsustainable, clean, and safe energy supply system.  \n\nthe  energy  production, \n\nin \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n17 \n\nFurthermore, \n\nA  number  of  steps  have  been  taken  to  support  the  achievement  of  the  20%  reduction \n6. \ntarget.  The  related  administrative  regulations  include  the  Circular  of  the  General  Office  of  the \nNational  Development  Reform  Commission  on  Organizing  and  Implementing  the  National \nDevelopment  of  Important  Industries  and  Technologies  in  Energy  Conservation  and  Key \nTechnologies  of  Renewable  Energies  (September  2004),  the  Circular  of  the  General  Office  of \nthe  State  Council  on  Further  Pushing  the  Innovation  of  Wall  Materials  and  Popularizing  the \nBuilding  of  Energy  Conservation  (Guo  Ban  Fa,  June  2005,  No.  33),  and  the  Circular  of  the \nGeneral Office of the State Council on the View of Encouraging the Development for the Energy \nEfficient,  Environmental  Friendly  and  Low  Emission  Vehicles  (Guo  Ban  Fa,  December  2005, \nNo.  61).  Most  importantly,  the  Medium-  and  Long-Term  Energy  Conservation  Plan  highlights \nkey sectors of emphasis and provides a conceptual road map for improving energy efficiency. \nThe plan puts forward 10 specific types of energy efficiency projects, and identifies the sectors \nwith  the  most  potential  for  energy  efficiency  improvement.  Energy  efficiency  is  also  granted \nspecial  attention  along  with  energy  development  in  all  of  the  Government\u2019s  energy-related \nplanning.  In  addition,  the  Energy  Conservation  Law  is  being  revised  and  a  comprehensive \nEnergy  Law  is  expected  to  be  in  effect  by  2008.  The  revised  Energy  Conservation  Law  will \n(i) specify  the  enforcement  authority;  (ii)  broaden  the  field  of  energy  conservation;  (iii) provide \nconcrete  measures  for  energy  pricing,  financing,  and  taxation  or  fiscal  budgeting;  and \n(iv) provide stricter punishment. \n \nthe  PRC\u2019s  highest-level  governing  bodies  have  defined  resource \n7. \nconservation as a strategic focal point for the PRC\u2019s future economic development. In this vein, \nthe  State  Council  has  called  for  the  establishment  of  a  \u201cresource-saving  society\u201d  and \nemphasized every citizen\u2019s duty to conserve energy and other recourses.  \n \n8. \nIn  2004,  the  PRC\u2019s  Initial  National  Communication  to  the  United  Nations  Framework \nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) stated that \u201cA key component of the PRC\u2019s industrial \npolicies  is  to  reduce  consumption  of  energy  and  other  resources,  improve  the  comprehensive \nutilization  and  efficient  use  of  energy  and  other  resources,  promote  cleaner  production,  and \nprevent  and  control  industrial  pollution.\u201d  It  added:  \u201cThe  Chinese  government  has  all  along \nattached great importance to international cooperation in the field of climate change.\u201d National \nstandards  for  energy  efficiency  monitoring  and  evaluation,  verification,  and  labeling  are  being \ndeveloped. \n \n9. \nIn  April  2006  the  Government  launched  the  Top-1000  Program  to  improve  energy \nefficiency  in  industrial  enterprises.  The  top  1,000  enterprises  were  in  the  following  industries: \n(i) building  materials,  (ii)  power,  (iii)  textile,  (iv)  iron  and  steel,  (v)  chemical,  (vi)  coal, \n(vii) petroleum  and  petrochemical,  (viii)  nonferrous  metal,  and  (ix)  paper.  Each  enterprise  is \nsupposed  to  sign  an  energy  efficiency  agreement  with  the  Government  set  energy  efficiency \ngoals,  implement  an  energy  utilization  reporting  system,  conduct  energy  audits,  draw  up  an \nenergy  conservation  plan,  invest  in  energy  efficiency  improvement,  and  train  its  officials  and \nstaff in energy efficiency.  \n \n10. \nThe  Decision  of  the  State  Council  on  Strengthening  Energy  Conservation  (Guo  Fa, \nAugust, 2006, No. 28) places energy conservation in a position of greater strategic urgency to \nensure  the  fulfillment  of  the  energy  conservation  goals  of  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan.  Overall \nenergy  consumption  in  key  industries  should  reach  internationally  advanced  levels.  The \ndecision  reiterates  the  main  goals  of  energy  conservation,  which  are  to  (i)  lower  the \nconsumption of each CNY 10,000 GDP to 0.98 tons of standard coal, about 20% less than at \nthe  end  of  the  10th  Five-Year  Plan  Period;  and  (ii)  achieve  an  annual  average  energy \nconservation efficiency of 4.4%. The decision also explicitly asks all areas and departments to \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n \n\n 18 \n \n\nin \n\n(vi) \n\n(v)  accelerate \n\ntechnological  development, \n\nthe  10  energy  conservation  projects \n\n \nadopt  the  following  measures  to  meet  the  energy  conservation  goal:  (i)  revise  industry \nstructures and build energy-saving industrial systems by increasing the proportion of the service \nindustry  in  the  national  economy,  strictly  controlling  the  growth  of  industries  with  high  energy \nconsumption, and developing high-efficiency, clean, and renewable sources of energy; (ii) focus \non  energy  conservation  in  key  fields,  including  energy-consuming  industries,  residential  and \npublic  buildings,  transportation,  commercial  and  civilian  fields,  rural  areas,  and  government \ndepartments;  (iii)  pursue  the  development  of  energy  conservation  technologies  and  the \nimplementation  of \nthe  11th  Five-Year  Plan; \n(iv) strengthen  energy  conservation  supervision  and  administration;  and  (v)  establish  energy \nconservation  guarantee  mechanisms  comprising  energy  price  reforms,  preferential  taxation \npolicies, and a reward system for energy conservation.  \n \nIn March 2007, Premier Wen Jiabao reported to National People\u2019s Congress that eight \n11. \nmeasures  would  be  implemented  in  2007  to  further  improve  energy  conservation:  (i)  improve \ncompliance  with  energy  consumption  standards,  (ii)  abolish  obsolete  production  capacity, \n(iii) prioritize  energy  conservation  in  high-consumption  sectors,  (iv)  improve  the  policy \nimprove  pollution  control, \nframework, \n(vii) strengthen the regulatory compliance system, and (viii) effectively delegate responsibility for \nenergy conservation. CNY10 billion has been set aside for 2007 to be used in doing away with \noutdated production methods in industry, upgrading production technologies, and management \nof  high-energy-consuming  and  polluting  industries.  The  Integrated  Work  Plan  for  Energy \nConservation and Emission Reduction issued by the State Council in June 2007 reconfirmed 10 \nenergy-saving projects during the period of the 11th Five Year Plan. The aim is to produce 240 \nmillion tons of standard coal energy-saving capacity. \n \n12. \nPreferential  tax  treatment  policies  for  energy  conservation  were  introduced  in  the  new \nEnterprise  Income  Tax  Law.  Companies  that  engage  in  projects  involving  environmental \nprotection,  energy  saving,  and  water  conservation  will  enjoy  income  tax  deductions  or \nexemption. Investment in the purchase of specialized equipment used in those projects can be \noffset against income tax at specified percentages. In addition, other tax benefits have been put \nin  place, such  as  deduction  of  value-added  tax  for  energy efficiency  activities.  It  is  anticipated \nthat more detailed tax and fiscal policies will be issued to promote energy efficiency.  \n \nin \n13. \nSeptember 2007 \nfurther  encourages  energy  efficiency  and  conservation.  Provincial \nDevelopment and Reform Commissions, Economic and Trade Commissions, and Price Bureaus \nare  to  identify  high-energy-consuming  enterprises  and  remove  favorable  electricity  price \nincentives previously granted to those industries, especially the aluminum (removal of incentive \nof  CNY0.02  or  CNY0.05  by  the  end  of  2007  and  elimination  of  any  remaining  incentives  in \n2008),  iron  alloy  (removal  of  the  incentive  of  CNY0.02  per  kilowatt-hour  by  21  October  2007) \nand chlorine-caustic soda (removal of incentives in 2008) industries. \n \n\nThe  Notification  on  Enhanced  Carrying  out  of  Differential  Electricity  Prices \n\n \n\n\f    Appendix 4           19 \n\nADB\u2019S EFFORTS TO IMPROVE ENERGY EFFICIENCY \n\nADB in Asia and the Pacific1\n\nA. \n \n1. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) has made several investments in energy efficiency, \nincluding (i) a $150 million credit line for the Industrial Development Bank of India that was used \nfor  large  industrial  energy  efficiency  projects  (1995);  (ii)  a  $100  million  credit  line  for  the  India \nRenewable  Energy  Development  Agency  (IREDA),  used  primarily  for  industrial  biomass \ncogeneration,  waste  heat  recovery,  and  wind  energy  projects  (1997);  and  (iii)  equity  fund \ninvestments  in  FondElec  Global/Asia  Clean  Energy  (FEGACE)  Fund  and  China  Environment \nFund  (2003).  ADB  successfully  developed  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism  (CDM) \ntransaction related to the coal-mine methane (CMM) capture project in Fuxin, People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC); emission reduction credits from another two ADB projects in the PRC were sold \ndirectly  by  the  project.  Numerous  energy  efficiency  investments  have  been  made  in  power \ntransmission  and  distribution  system  upgrades,  which  were  components  of  mainstream  power \nsector  loans.  Urban  environment  improvement  and  energy  projects  in  the  PRC,  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic,  and  Mongolia  include  projects  aimed  at  increasing  energy  efficiency  in  heat \ndistribution  and  gas  supply.  These  supply-side  projects  were  generally  rated  satisfactory  or \npartly satisfactory, except for the loan through a financial intermediary. \n \n2. \nADB has made a limited number of interventions on the demand-side energy efficiency; \nthese  were  implemented  in  the  1990s  mainly  with  the  objective  of  improving  the  environment \nthrough the use of cleaner production technologies. Of the 11 such loans that were extended to \nindustrial  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs),  nine  were  rated  successful  and  two  partially \nsuccessful on completion. Continued and enhanced support for regulation to improve demand-\nside  efficiency  is  essential  for  reducing  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions.  In  markets  where \nsuch policies and regulations exist but are not effective, further interventions will be required. To \nsuitably  address  the  concern  related  to  market  distortion,  interventions  can  be  designed  for \nSOEs  using  the  non-sovereign  public  sector  financing  facility  (under  ADB\u2019s  Innovation  and \nEfficiency Initiative), which enables the use of market-based lending terms.  \n \n3. \nADB  has  actively  promoted  energy  efficiency  in  the  region  through  its  technical \nassistance  (TA)  and  capacity-building  programs.  Most  recently,  an  interdepartmental  program \nwas established on Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency and Climate Change (REACH). One \nof  its  key  roles  is  to  administer  the  following  funds:  (i)  the  Netherlands  Cooperation  Fund  on \nPromotion  of  Investments  in  Developing  Member  Countries  (DMCs);  (ii)  the  Canadian \nCooperation  Fund  on  Greenhouse  Gas  Abatement,  Adaptation,  and  Carbon  Sequestration, \nwhich aims to help and engage ADB\u2019s DMCs at the programming and policy level in managing \nand  abating  climate  change  to  reduce  the  growth  of  GHG  emissions;  (iii)  the  Danish \nCooperation  Fund  on  Renewable  Energy  and  Energy  Efficiency  in  Rural  Areas,  which  helps \nADB  promote  environmental  sustainability;  and  (iv)  the  Finnish  Technical  Assistance  Grant \nFund  to  support  environmental  protection  and  development  of  renewable  energy  These  funds \nhave  been  used  to  finance  projects  focused  on  advocacy,  training,  and  capacity  building  and \nhave also supported numerous energy efficiency project pre-feasibility studies, identifying cost-\neffective  investments,  for  example,  in  bagasse  and  rice  husk  cogeneration,  agricultural  and \nlivestock waste biogas, and industrial efficiency. \n\n                                                 \n \n1 Based on ADB. 2006. Report on Energy Efficiency Initiative. Manila. \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n20 \n \n \nOverall, ADB\u2019s level of investment in sustainable energy has so far been below both the \n4. \npotential  and  the  need.  Advocacy  and  training  programs  are  useful,  but  success  needs  to  be \nmeasured  in  terms  of  investments  made,  energy  saved  or  produced,  and  emissions  reduced. \nThe current challenges call for ADB to increase its sustainable energy investing as a thematic \narea,  through  both  targeted  special  energy  efficiency  projects  and  deeper  incorporation  of \nenergy efficiency components within mainstream investments.  \n\nB.  \n\nADB in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n\nthe \n\nfacilitated \n\nBy  2006,  ADB\u2019s  energy  sector  lending  to  the  PRC  exceeded  $3.5  billion  for  29  loans, \n5. \nwhich  had  successfully \nintroduction  and  expansion  of  higher-risk  new \ntechnologies and new mechanisms, such as combined heat and power plants, CMM and coal-\nbed  methane  (CBM)  extraction,  pumped  storage  power  plants,  emission  trading  mechanisms, \n500  kilovolt  transmission  lines,  gas  insulated  substations,  as  well  as  documentation  and \ntransaction for CDM projects. Non-lending support of about $50 million has evolved from tariff \nreforms,  sector  restructuring,  establishment  of  the  electricity  regulator,  and  mainstreaming \nenvironment  evaluation,  to  innovative  technologies  and  mechanisms  in  energy  efficiency  and \nrenewable energy, and to capacity building for CDM.  \n \nADB assistance, in the form of policy advice, knowledge services, TA, project financing, \n6. \nand  risk  mitigation  services,  will  focus  on  (i)  energy  efficiency  and  energy  conservation; \n(ii) renewable  energy,  mainly  wind,  biomass,  and  hydropower;  (iii)  clean  coal  technologies; \n(iv) urban environment improvement; (v) CMM and CBM; and (vi) regional cooperation in power. \nADB  will  also  support  the  Government  in  intensifying  sector  reforms  and  building  capacity \n(particularly at the provincial and project implementation level), nurturing a more efficient energy \nmarket  by  catalyzing  private  investment,  mobilizing  the  participation  of  domestic  financial \ninstitutions, stimulating CDM-related  carbon  trading,  assisting  local  energy  service  companies, \nand removing major barriers to the transfer and adoption of low-carbon technologies.  \n \n7. \nIn these focal areas, ADB will continue to conceptualize innovative projects and use new \ninitiatives and flexible financing tools, e.g., the Carbon Market Initiative (CMI), the Clean Energy \nFinancing  Partnership  Facility,  the  Energy  Efficiency  Initiative  (EEI),  financial  intermediation, \nand  multitranche  financing  facilities,  in  planning,  designing,  and  implementing  projects  with \ntangible demonstration effects and significant opportunities for replication. Sector interventions \nwill  be  closely  coordinated  with  private  sector  operations,  and  will  actively  seek  private  or \nnon-sovereign  investment.  Some  projects  targeted  for  the  poor  western  provinces  will  directly \nbenefit  local  rural  communities,  thereby  promoting  inclusive  growth.  ADB  assistance  will \nimprove  sector  governance  by  adopting  international  best  practices, ensuring  efficient  and  fair \nprocurement,  mainstreaming  participatory  project  design,  and  enhancing  compliance  with \nsafeguards. \n \n8.  \nMany  different  approaches  are  needed  to  fully  tap  various  segments  with  significant \nenergy  efficiency  potential  in  the  PRC.  ADB  has  developed  several  projects  under  EEI.  In  its \npublic  sector  operations,  ADB  is  working  with  provincial  government  to  provide  a  financial \nintermediation  loan  to  a  provincial  trust  company  to  finance  energy  efficiency  in  the  industrial \nsector. In the private sector, in addition to the proposed Program, ADB has called for proposals \nfrom private equity funds interested in equity investment in clean energy and energy efficiency \nprojects. \n\n \n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 12 November 2007) \n", "Currency Unit\nCNY1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "yuan (CNY) \n$0.13 \nCNY7.41 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n \n", "\u2013  Asian Development Bank \n\u2013  Annual growth rate \n\u2013  building management system \n\u2013  Clean Development Mechanism \n\u2013  developing member country \n\u2013  Energy Efficiency Initiative \n\u2013  environmental management plan \n\u2013  gross domestic product \n\u2013  greenhouse gas \n\u2013  partial credit guarantee  \n\u2013  project performance evaluation report \n\u2013  People\u2019s Republic of China \nstate-owned enterprise \n\u2013 \n", "ADB \nAGR \nBMS \nCDM \nDMC \nEEI \nEMP \nGDP \nGHG \nPCG \nPPER \nPRC \nSOE \n", "WEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n", "EJ \nGWh \nkWh \nMTCE \nMWh \nquad \nsq m \n", "exajoule (1018 joules) \ngigawatt-hour (1 billion watt-hours) \nkilowatt-hour (1,000 watt-hours) \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  million tons of coal equivalent \n\u2013  megawatt-hour (1 million watt-hours) \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "quadrillion British thermal units (BTU) (1015 BTU) \nsquare meter (1 meter x 1 meter) \n", " \nNOTE \n", "In this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars. \n", "L.
