The \nproject  will  also  continue  strengthening  project  development  capacity,  sustainable  service \ndelivery, and community awareness.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nUrbanization.  Bangladesh  is  urbanizing  rapidly,  particularly  in  large  cities  such  as \nDhaka and Khulna, exacerbating challenges in a country that has one of the highest population \ndensities  in  the  world.  In  2018,  about  61  million  people,  or  37%  of  the  total  population  of  164 \nmillion, lived in urban areas. Since 2015 the average annual urban population growth is 3.17%, \nfaster  than  the  annual  national  population  growth  average  of  1.37%.  The  country\u2019s  urban \npopulation is expected to reach 74 million by 2025, or 42% of the total population, with Dhaka \nbecoming  the  world\u2019s  fourth-largest  urban  agglomeration.3  Urbanization  raises  economic \nproductivity  through  agglomeration  advantages,  but  places  severe  strains  on  the  environment \nand urban infrastructure and services. More needs to be done urgently, especially in the large \ncity  regions,  for  sustaining  growth  while  safeguarding  environmental  standards  and  making \ncities more livable in line with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.4 \n \n4. \nCity  region  development.  A  \u201ccity  region\u201d  is  an  agglomeration  of  a  large  city  (city \ncorporation) surrounding pourashavas (secondary towns) and adjacent peri-urban areas (urban \ncenters in upazilas [subdistricts]) with close economic and social links.5 City region development \ncan  improve  livability  by  decongesting  a  core  city  and  promoting  economic  growth  through \nplanning,  institutional  development,  and  infrastructure  investments  that  transcend  restrictive \nadministrative jurisdictions. Therefore, closer coordination among fragmented institutions in city \nregions and increased mobility within urban agglomerations are critical. Investments to improve \ncity regions\u2019 resilience to climate and disaster risks triggered by earthquakes, floods, droughts, \n\n                                                \n1  ADB. Bangladesh: City Region Development Project. \n2  Project  preparation  was  supported  by  (i)  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V) and the Netherlands Trust Fund under the ADB-administered \nWater Financing Partnership Facility; and (ii)  a project design advance loan of $5 million  for preparation,  design, \nand  supervision  consultancy  services.  Both  were  approved  on  15  December  2016.  The  Cities  Development \nInitiative  for  Asia  (CDIA)  provided  pre-feasibility  support  for  Khulna  (CDIA.  2017.

The  first  project  improved  the  Dhaka  and  Khulna  city \nregions  by  (i)  upgrading  roads,  bridges,  and  bus  terminals  to  reduce  travel  time  and  enhance \nroad  safety;  (ii)  improving  storm  drains  to  reduce  flooding;  (iii)  upgrading  the  water  supply; \nimproving  solid  waste \n(iv) improving  sanitation  access \nmanagement.8  The  first  project  also  financed  the  preparation  of  the  Dhaka  Structure  Plan, \n2016\u20132035,9  a  framework  for  infrastructure  development  and  interagency  coordination,  and \nsupported  project  municipalities  in  improving  governance  and  service  delivery.10  Overall,  the \nfirst  project  facilitated  logistics,  easier  access  to  employment  opportunities  and  social  service \nfacilities,  and  the  reduction  of  water  logging  and  incidences  of  waterborne  diseases.11 \nNotwithstanding  progress  made  under  earlier  support  from  ADB  and  other  development \npartners,12  key  implementation  issues  under  the  first  project  that  need  attention  include \ninteragency coordination for decision-making, a significant infrastructure gap, start-up delays in \ndetailed  design  preparation,  and  timely  implementation  of  project  activities  of  diverse  nature. \nThe  project  builds  on  lessons  and  past  gains  in  community  awareness,  institutional  capacity, \nand  coordination  among  municipalities,13  while  continuing \nto  develop  much-needed \ninfrastructure in the Dhaka and Khulna city regions.14 \n \n6. \nValue addition. Investments will be in multiple municipalities based on priorities defined \nin the regional development plans of the two city regions. For the Dhaka city region, investments \nare for the first time being selected based on the Dhaka Structure Plan to improve connectivity \nand linkage of peri-urban areas within the city region. For the Khulna city region, the preparation \nof comprehensive drainage master plans and related critical infrastructure investments, as well \nas a detailed solid waste management concept for Khulna city corporation (KCC), will improve \nclimate  and  disaster  resilience  and  overall  livability.15  To  reduce  start-up  delays  in  additional \nfuture  projects,  support  for  the  preparation  of  detailed  engineering  designs  for  investments \ninvolving  the  latest  technologies  and  smart  applications,  including  integrated  real-time  data \n                                                \n6  Climate Change Assessment and Abridged Climate Risk and Vulnerability Analysis Report (accessible from the list \n\nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7  ADB-supported  urban  projects  include  (i)  ADB.

Dhaka  city  region  roads  were  selected  based  on \nconnectivity  to  key  roads,  population  served,  present  condition,  traffic  count,  and  travel  time \nsavings, among other criteria. Public information campaigns and traffic management assistance \nwere  recommended  for  subprojects  in  built-up  areas,  and  road  design  guidelines  were \ndeveloped  to  address  climate  change  adaptation  measures.  Drainage  subprojects  were \nselected  considering  the  type  and  location  of  drains  with  respect  to  the  drainage  network, \nconnectivity to the outfall, and the improvements required. Community awareness programs and \nimproved  solid  waste  management  will  improve  the  overall  environment  and  reduce  drainage \ncongestion. Development and update of drainage master plans and preparation of O&M plans \nwill  improve  overall  planning  capacity,  infrastructure  quality,  and  sustainability  of  service \ndelivery.  Design  options  were  compared  before  selecting  the  best  possible  technologies  in \nterms  of  cost,  construction  materials,  and  environmental  and  social  impacts.  Sample \nsubprojects  developed  during  project  preparation  confirmed  technical  viability  with  due \nconsideration  of  local  capacity  for  implementation  and  O&M.  The  same  approach  will  be \nfollowed  for  subprojects  to  be  prepared  during  project  implementation.  All  subprojects  will  be \ntechnically  and  operationally  appropriate;  least-cost;  and  designed  based  on  a  whole-of-life \nanalysis,  including  appropriate  climate  and  disaster  resilience measures based  on  current risk \nscenarios. \n \nB. \n \nEconomic analysis. The economic rationale for the government\u2019s intervention is sound, \n18. \nas the project aims to provide stronger and more sustainable urban basic services focusing on \ndrainage  systems,  urban  roads,  and  solid  waste  management  in  the  Dhaka  and  Khulna  city \nregions. The  economic internal  rates of return of  the three sample subprojects  were  (i)  11.7% \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nfor  drainage  (Sonargaon);  (ii)  16.3%  for  roads  (Savar);  and  (iii)  15.3%  for  solid  waste \nmanagement (Khulna), higher than the economic opportunity cost of capital estimated at 9.0%, \nindicating  significant  economic  returns.  Most  of  the  sample  subprojects  have  also  yielded \nsatisfactory results when subjected to sensitivity analysis using the following downside risks: (i) \n20% capital cost overrun, (ii) 20% O&M cost overrun, (iii) 20% decline in estimated benefits, (iv) \n1-year implementation delay, and (v) all four downside risks. Economic viability could be higher \nif unquantifiable benefits such as environmental improvements are included in the analysis.24 \n \nFinancial analysis. The financial analysis was conducted for three sample subprojects \n19. \nto make sure that the project municipalities can cover the incremental costs; all subprojects are \nexpected  to  be  maintained  through  their  general  revenue,  as  they  are  all  nonrevenue \ngenerating. The projected overall financial position of the  sample project municipalities reflects \nincremental  revenues  and  expenditures,  the  growth  trend  of  revenue  streams,  and  expected \npopulation  growth.  Financial  projections  demonstrate  that  by  (i)  improving  the  collection \nefficiency  of  taxes  and  other  charges  and  (ii)  providing  continued  and  additional  government \nsupport,  the  revenue  account  will  remain  in  surplus.  Increased  budget  allocation  to  urban \ndevelopment  during  the  past  5  years  underlines  the  government\u2019s  commitment  to  urban \ninfrastructure O&M. The project will also assist the project municipalities in enhancing financial \nsustainability parameters through extensive capacity building support. ADB will closely monitor \nprogress toward the necessary revenue realizations through continuous government dialogue.25 \n \nC. \n \nThe  overall  procurement  and  financial  management  risk  for  the  project  is  moderate.26  \n20. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  concluded  that  the  executing  and  implementing \nagencies  can  conduct  adequate  project  financial  management.  A  significant  strength  of  the \nexecuting  and  implementing  agencies  is  their  considerable  experience  in  handling  externally \nfunded  projects  with  substantial  values.  The  executing  agency  and  most  of  the  proposed \nimplementing agencies implemented the first project satisfactorily in terms of (i) timely receipt of \nproject funds, including counterpart funds; (ii) efficient project management with adequate staff; \nand  (iii)  prompt  funds  disbursement  to  contractors  and  consultants.  The  executing  and \nimplementing  agencies  have  an  established  legal,  institutional,  and  monitoring  framework  for \nbudgeting, accounting, and auditing. Risk mitigation measures include (i) securing government \ncommitment to ensure timely establishment of project implementation units (PIUs) with qualified \nstaff, (ii) extending training and skill development support for financial management capacity of \nnewly  assigned  PMCU  and  PIUs  staff,  and  (iii)  strengthening  the  accounts  section  of  project \nmunicipalities by engaging qualified staff for timely preparation of budget and financial reports. \nClose  monitoring  and  resolution  of  capacity  gaps  will  be  implemented  with  the  support  of  the \nloan consultants. \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n21. \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 18). \n \n\n                                                \n24 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 Project Procurement Risk Assessment Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fGender.  The  project \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nis  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  Budget \n\nD. \n \n22. \nPoverty.  The  country\u2019s  population  living  below  the  poverty  line  is  estimated  to  have \ndropped 7% from 2010 to 2016, but the proportion of poor people continues to be high at almost \n25%  in  2016.27  The  number  of  urban  poor  people  is  growing  as  job  opportunities  attract \nmigrants from rural areas, resulting in the growth of slums with inadequate urban infrastructure \nand  poor  quality  of  life.  The  improved  roads  will  provide  safer  and  more  pedestrian-friendly \nconditions and enable better access to basic services, such as health care and education, and \nto workplaces. The improved roads, drains, and solid waste management will improve quality of \nlife  for  all,  including  the  poor  communities  in  the  project  area.  The  project  recognizes  the \nimportance of stakeholder participation, including civil society, women, and poor groups, and will \ninclude community consultation as well as community awareness activities.28 \n \n23. \nfor \nimplementation  and  monitoring  of  the  gender  action  plan  (GAP)  is  included  in  the  project \ncosts.29 Experience with the first project has resulted in specific activities that will directly benefit \npoor  women  through  job  generation  and  skills  development.  For  example,  the  project  will  use \nconstruction techniques that will enable women to comprise  at least 20% of unskilled workers. \nThrough  community-based  organizations,  women  will  be  encouraged  to  become  actively \ninvolved  in decision-making  under the  project  outputs.  Female  staff  and community facilitators \nwill  be  trained  to  collect  sex-disaggregated  data  from  construction  sites  as  input  to  a  sex-\ndisaggregated geospatial database to manage and track the GAP. The PMCU will have a full-\ntime social development expert to monitor timely and effective GAP implementation and prepare \nquarterly  progress  reports  to  be  submitted  to  ADB.  GAP  implementation  will  be  evaluated  as \npart of benefit monitoring at project completion. \n \nE. \n \n24. \ncategories are as follows.30 \n \n25. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  An  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework \n(EARF)  was  prepared  and  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  following  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (2009)  and  government\u2019s  environmental  regulations.  The  EARF  provides  guidance \non  subproject  selection, screening  and  categorization,  information  disclosure and consultation, \nassessment,  planning,  institutional  arrangement,  and  processes  to  be  followed  in  the \nformulation  and  implementation  of  subprojects.  The  project  will  not  include  subprojects \ntriggering  category  A  per  the  EARF.  Three  sample  subprojects  were  appraised  and  initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE)  reports  were  prepared  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (2009)  and  the  EARF.31  The  IEEs  and  information  on  the  subprojects  indicate  that \nthe  subprojects  are  located  on  existing  rights-of-way  and  government-owned  lands,  and  there \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n27 Government  of  Bangladesh,  Ministry  of  Planning,  Statistics  and  Informatics  Division,  Bangladesh  Bureau  of \n\nStatistics. 2017.

The potential impacts, such as \nconstruction vibration affecting the structural integrity of properties, road safety issues, and safe \ndisposal of excavated materials, are site-specific; few are irreversible and most can be readily \nmitigated  and  minimized  using  proven  mitigation  measures  and  environmentally  sound \ninternational  good  practice.32 \nengineering  and  construction  practices  consistent  with \nStakeholders were involved through meaningful consultations and their views were fed into the \nIEEs  and  subproject  designs.  The  consultation  process  will  continue  during  project \nimplementation  to  maintain  full  engagement  with  stakeholders.  The  IEEs  and  environmental \nmanagement  plans  will  form  part  of  the  bid  and  contract  documents.  All  draft  IEEs  will  be \nupdated based on the detailed design, and works cannot start until ADB reviews and approves \nthe  final  IEEs,  which  will  be  disclosed  on  the  ADB,  PMCU,  and  PIU  websites;  and  to  the \naffected people. The PAM includes a grievance redress mechanism (footnote 18). The PMCU is \ncommitted and has the capacity to carry out the requirements of the EARF and  IEEs, and the \nproject  includes  sufficient  PMCU  and  PIU  safeguards  staff  and  consultant  support  to  ensure \nsatisfactory environmental compliance to meet Safeguard Policy Statement requirements. \n \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B).  To  guide  subproject  preparation,  the  PMCU \n26. \nprepared a resettlement framework in line with the Safeguard Policy Statement and government \npolicies, a resettlement plan, and three due diligence reports for the sample subprojects.33 The \nresettlement plan addresses the impacts identified through appropriate mitigation measures and \nPMCU  and  PIUs  conducted  meaningful  stakeholder  consultations  for  its  preparation.  The \ngrievance  redress  mechanism  will  address  issues  and  grievances  timely  and  effectively.  The \nPMCU  is  committed  to and  can carry  out  the  requirements  of the resettlement framework  and \nthe  resettlement  plan,  as  demonstrated  in  the  first  project,  and  will  submit  semiannual  social \nsafeguard  monitoring  reports  to  ADB.  PMCU  safeguards  staff  will  be  supported  by  loan \nconsultants in monitoring safeguard compliance.
