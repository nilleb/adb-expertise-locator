The project supports the Government of Viet \nNam  in  developing  bankable  and  commercially  viable  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP) \ninitiatives,  promoting  a more  conducive environment for  PPP,  and  using  PPP  as  a  catalyst for \nbroader  sector  reforms.  Under  the  project,  ADB  will  provide  funding  of  SDR13,171,000 \n(equivalent to $20 million) for the establishment and operation of a project development facility \n(PDF) as a funding mechanism to support PPP project preparation activities, which will include \nthe  preparation  of  prefeasibility  studies,  detailed  feasibility  studies,  and  bid  and  contract \ndocumentation. The loan agreement for the project was signed by ADB and the government on \n17 January 2013 and became effective on 28 May 2013.  \n \n2. \nThe  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment  (MPI)  is  the  executing  agency.  The \nprocurement  process  for  the  core  team  of  consultants  that  will  support  MPI  is  currently  being \nimplemented.  The  impact  of  the  project  will  be  increased  private  sector  investment  in \ninfrastructure.  This  will  in  turn  improve  the  efficiency  and quality  of  infrastructure  services  and \naccelerate Viet Nam\u2019s economic growth. The outcome will be stronger government capacity to \ncatalyze PPPs and infrastructure investments. The key outputs  are an institutional mechanism \nfor  developing  bankable  PPP  projects,  a  more  robust  PPP  enabling  framework,  and  stronger \ninstitutional capacity for PPP.  \n    \n\nII. \n\nTHE ADDITIONAL FINANCING \n\nRationale \n\nImpact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\nA. \n \n3. \nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) has agreed to provide a cofinancing loan of \n\u20ac8 million (equivalent to $10 million) that will be used to fund the PDF. AFD and the government \nsigned the loan agreement on 9 April 2013. The additional financing from AFD will be used to \nexpand the scale of the PDF, and is consistent with project development objectives, government \npriorities,  and  ADB\u2019s  current  country  partnership  strategy1.  A  cofinancing  agreement  between \nADB  and  AFD  now  needs to  be  prepared,  setting  out  the  administration  arrangements  for  the \nfacility. \n \nB. \n \nThe aggregate impact and outcome of the project will not change as a consequence of \n4. \nthe additional financing. The project outputs remain the same, although the additional financing \nfrom AFD will enable the pipeline of PPP projects to be processed by PDF will increase from 10 \nto  15  by  2016.  The  loan  funds  from  ADB  and  AFD  (the  cofinanciers\u2019  loans)  will  be  used  to \nfinance  the  following  activities  based  on  defined  ratios  for  each  cost  category: 2  (i) engage \ninternational consultants for the PDF technical team who will support the MPI in managing the \nPDF  and  (ii)  engage  consultants  to  undertake  project  preparation  activities  for  potential  PPP \nprojects,  including  the  preparation  of  prefeasibility  studies  and  detailed  feasibility  studies,  and \nprovision  of  transaction  advisory  services.  The  estimated  number  of  international  consultant \ninputs for the PDF technical team will increase from 52 months to 90 months.  The consultant \n\n                                                \n1 ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: Viet Nam, 2012\u20132015. Manila \n2 The cost allocation arrangement between ADB and AFD will be done in line with Option 3 of OM J6 (i.e., different \nratios specified for each cost category) and will be as follows: (i) 63.5:36.5 for international consultants on the PDF \ntechnical team and (ii) 67.7:32.3 for project development costs (Appendixes 2 and 3). \n\n\fCofinancing \n\ninputs  for  project  development  will  be  determined  by  the  PDF technical  team  following  project \nscreening and selection. \n \n5.         ADB will partially administer the AFD funds and be responsible for the recruitment of \nconsultants and the disbursement of the cofinanciers\u2019 loans for the purposes detailed in para. 4. \nThe  selection,  engagement,  and  services  of  these  consultants  will  be  in  accordance  with  the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). For the purposes \nof  the  project,  the  disbursements  from  the  AFD  loan  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time). \n \nC. \n \nThe proposed AFD cofinancing was initially part of the project concept, but at the time of \n6. \nADB loan negotiations the government had not secured internal clearance to borrow from AFD. \nTherefore, AFD cofinancing was not included in the report and recommendation of the President \nfor the project.3 AFD has completed negotiations with the government and signed an agreement \nfor an \u20ac8 million loan on 9 April 2013 under its sovereign loan conditions. The AFD loan will fund \nthe PDF, and it will be administered by ADB under a proposed cofinancing agreement on a joint \nbasis. Interest on the AFD loan has been computed at 2.38% per annum as per standard AFD-\nsubsidized  loan  conditions  (PS2).4 This  cost  will  be  directly  borne  by  the  government  and  will \nnot  be  drawn  from  the  loan  proceeds.  AFD  will  provide  retroactive  financing  for  project \ndevelopment  expenses  already  incurred  by  the  Authorised  State  Agencies  or  People\u2019s \nCommittees subject to the latter following the prescribed procedure detailed in the procurement \nplan. The retroactive financing amount will not exceed \u20ac60,000 and will be for eligible expenses \nincurred  within  9  months  before  signing  of  the  loan  agreement  between  AFD  and  the \ngovernment. The revised investment and financing plans are in Tables 1 and 2. \n\n \nTable 1: Revised Investment Plan  \n($ million) \n \n\nItem \nA.  Base Costa \n \n \n\nPDF operating costsb \n\n1. \n2.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the Socialist \nRepublic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the Public  Private  Partnership  Support  Project.  Manila  (project  no.  44507-002,  October \n2012). \n\n4   A  category  of  subsidized  AFD  sovereign  loans.  Interest  rate  of  AFD  loan  is  Euribor  +0.18%  per  annum,  the \n\nequivalent fixed rate estimated based on the market conditions of October 17, 2012 was 2.38% per annum. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAFD = Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, PDF = project development facility. \na  Includes  taxes  and  duties  of  $2.1  million  to  be  financed  from  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  AFD  loan \nresources. Financing of taxes and duties from the ADB\u2013AFD loan funds are justified because (i) it will not represent \nan excessive share of the project investment plan, (ii) the taxes and duties apply only to ADB- and AFD-financed \nexpenditures, and (iii) the financing of taxes and duties is material and relevant to the success of the project. \n\nb  PDF  operating  costs  include  establishment  costs  of  the  government\u2019s  project  management  unit,  staff  salaries, \n\noffice rental, utilities, supplies, transportation, and miscellaneous costs. \n\nc  PDF  technical  team  costs  consist  of  consultant  fees  over  the  first  3  years  for  consultants  that  will  support  the \n\nMinistry of Planning and Investment in managing the PDF. \n\nd Project development consists of consultant fees for the preparation of prefeasibility studies and  detailed feasibility \n\nstudies and the provision of transaction advisory services for PPP projects. \n\ne  Includes interest charges. Interest  on the ADB loan has been computed at 1% per annum for the first 8 years as \nper standard Asian Development Fund loan guidelines.  Interest on the AFD loan has been computed at 2.38% per \nannum as per standard AFD PS2 loan conditions. This cost will be directly borne by the Government of Viet Nam \nand will not be drawn from the loan proceeds. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nTable 2: Revised Financing Plan \n\nSource \nADBa \nAFD  \nGovernment \n\nAdditional \nCurrent \nAmount \nAmount \n($ million) \n($ million) \n0.0 \n20.0 \n10.0 \n  0.0 \n1.0 \n  2.9 \n11.0 \n22.9 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, AFD = Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement. \na ADB\u2019s disbursement percentages are presented in Attachment to Schedule 3 of ADB\u2019s loan agreement and this \n  table will be updated to reflect the additional financing (Appendix 3).

The  MPI  prepared  feasibility  studies for  both  the  ADB \nand AFD loans. ADB completed a mission to  Viet Nam from 10\u201312 December 2012, and held \ndiscussions with the MPI and AFD on the status of feasibility studies and loan negotiations. ADB \nhas received a copy of the signed loan agreement between the government and AFD.   \n \n8. \nThere is no change to the implementation arrangements for the project. The MPI will be \nthe executing agency in collaboration with the PPP task force and other government ministries \nand agencies involved in PPP. The task force, chaired by the MPI and comprising the Ministry \nof Finance, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Industry and Trade, Ministry of Transport, Ministry of \nConstruction,  State  Bank  of  Viet  Nam,  and  other  relevant  agencies,  was  established  in  mid-\nJanuary 2011 to provide overall guidance to the government\u2019s PPP piloting initiative. The task \nforce  is  being  restructured  to  allow  more  senior  representation  of  the  ministries,  which  will \nenable it to function more effectively as an inter-ministerial coordination body for PPP. The task \nforce will have high-level oversight of the PDF and will be the mechanism for coordination of line \nministries on the use of the PDF. A dedicated project management unit will be established with \nstaff assigned from the PPP office of the MPI for day-to-day management of the PDF under the \nproject. The unit will be supported by a team of national and international experts on PPP who \nwill be funded by the project. The estimated completion date continues to be June 2018. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fIII. \n\nTHE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n\n \n9. \nThe  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  the  loan  not \nexceeding  the  equivalent  of  \u20ac8.0  million  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  additional \nfinancing  of  the  Public\u2013Private  Partnership  Support  Project,  to  be  provided  by  Agence \nFran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement. \n \n \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fCurrent project  \n\nCurrent project \n\nCurrent project \n\nCurrent project \n\n \n\n \n\nDesign Summary \n\nImpact \n\nIncreased private sector \ninvestment in \ninfrastructure \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n5 \n\nREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n\nPerformance Targets \nand Indicators with \nBaselines \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\nBy the end of 2020, \naggregate private sector \ninvestment in \ninfrastructure will \nincrease by 50% of the \n2010 aggregate total \n(2010 baseline: $3 \nbillion) \n\nInternational and \nnational business \nclimate surveys \n\nWorld Bank PPP \ndatabase \n\nMOC, MOF, MPI, SBV, \nand other government \nstatistics on \ninfrastructure \ninvestments contained in \nwebsites, reports, and \npublications \n\nAssumptions \n\nStable macroeconomic \nenvironment and finance \nsector \n\nSufficient liquidity \navailable in the private \nsector \n\nRisk \n\nExogenous, international \nfinancial shock and \nmacroeconomic \ninstability \n\nWith additional financing \n\nWith additional financing \n\nWith additional financing  \n\nWith additional financing \n\nUnchanged \n\nUnchanged \n\nUnchanged \n\nUnchanged \n\nOutcome \n\nCurrent project  \n\nCurrent project  \n\nCurrent project  \n\nCurrent project  \n\nStronger government \ncapacity to catalyze \nPPPs and infrastructure \ninvestments \n\n \n\nBy the end of 2018, at \nleast five commercially \nviable PPP \ninfrastructure projects \nare successfully bid out \nand at least two project \ncommenced \nimplementation \n\nReports of procurement \nagencies of key \nministries involved in \npublic infrastructure \ninvestments \n\nAnnual reports of \nproject sponsors or \nfinanciers \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAssumptions \n\nAppropriate incentives \nfor private sector \nparticipation are \navailable. \n\n \nRisks \nPolitical resistance and \nvested interest may \nslow down reforms. \n\nPoor governance and \ncorruption.
