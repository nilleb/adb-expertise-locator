IIFCL  will  ensure  that  for  each \nSocial Safeguards  subproject,  the  initial  environmental  examination,  environmental \nAssessment  impact  assessment,  and  environmental  management  plan,  as \napplicable, are submitted to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for \nreview and approval before submission of a periodic financing request \n(PFR). IIFCL, with ADB assistance, has developed an environmental \nand social safeguards framework (ESSF) to guide the assessment of \nsubprojects during implementation of the Second India Infrastructure \nProject Financing Facility (IIPFF II). The objective of the ESSF and its \ndocumentation and review process is to ensure that ADB finances only \nsubprojects through the IIPFF II that are compliant with national and \nADB safeguard requirements applicable at the date the relevant PFR \nis submitted. The ESSF adopts the same approach as the First India \nInfrastructure Project Financing Facility (IIPFF I) approved by the ADB \nBoard  of  Directors  in December  2007.  The  ESSF  will  be  updated \nbased on ongoing national initiatives to strengthen environmental and \nsocial safeguard requirements and relevant ADB policies.   \n   \nInvestment Program   The IIPFF II supports the Scheme for Financing Viable Infrastructure \nDescription  Projects  through  the  India  Infrastructure  Finance  Company  Limited \n(the  Scheme)  for  promoting  infrastructure  development  primarily \nthrough public\u2013private partnerships (PPP). Pursuant to the Scheme, \nIIFCL provides long-term financing on commercial terms for stand-\nalone  nonrecourse  infrastructure  projects.  IIFCL  will  finance  PPP \nsubprojects selected through a transparent and competitive bidding \nprocess and only those assessed for commercial viability.  \n \nAs of August 2009, IIFCL\u2019s project pipeline included 88 sanctioned \nprojects with a total project cost of about $32 billion. The pipeline is \nexpected  to  increase  by  25  projects  a  year.  As  a  result,  IIFCL's \nbalance  sheet  is  projected  at  around  $11  billion  by  fiscal  year \n(FY)2013.      \n   \nMultitranche  IIFCL,  through  the  Government  of  India  (the  Government),  has \nFinancing Facility  requested ADB to finance a portion of its investment program through \nIIPFF II via a multitranche financing facility (MFF). The MFF modality is \nuniquely  suited  to  the  IIPFF  II  as  it  will  enable  IIFCL  to  release \n ", "ii   \nfinancing in line with project finance requirements in a phased manner \nand  provide  ADB  with  the  flexibility  to  monitor  progress  in  earlier \ntranches to guide implementation of subsequent tranches. The MFF \nwill provide $700 million over 5 years (FY2009\u2013FY2013) to IIFCL, for \nfinancing  eligible  subprojects  in  accordance  with  the  Scheme  and \nagreed criteria, including the ESSF. The MFF will be provided in three \ntranches\u23affirst tranche of $210 million, second tranche of $250 million, \nand third tranche of $240 million.  \n   \nRationale  Reliable  and  high  quality  infrastructure  is  a  critical  determinant  of \nproductivity  to  support  sustained  economic  growth  and  poverty \nreduction.  While  high  quality  infrastructure  is  essential  to  harness \ngrowth impulses in the economy, insufficient infrastructure capacity of \nIndia results in lower productivity, higher transport and logistic costs, \nand reduces competitiveness. With higher growth target and a rising \npopulation, even maintaining current levels of infrastructure will require \nstaggering an enormous increase in investments.  \n \nBased  on  the  targeted  growth  rate  and  identified  deficit,  required \ninfrastructure investment is estimated at approximately $514 billion. \nAccordingly, the goal of the Government of India (the Government) is \nto  increase  infrastructure  investment  from  4.5%  to  9%  of  gross \ndomestic product during the 11th Five-Year Plan (FYP) period, FY \n2007\u2013FY2011. Investments deficits of this scale cannot be bridged by \npublic financing that is already limited by fiscal constraints.  \n \nRecognizing  the  role  of  the  private  sector  in  infrastructure \ndevelopment, the Government has placed private sector participation \n(PSP) and PPP at the core of its infrastructure development strategy. \nIn line with this approach, infrastructure development is being fostered \nby initiatives to create an enabling environment for PPP through (i) \naddressing  policy  and  regulatory  gaps  in  several  infrastructure \nsubsectors,  (ii)  enhancing  the  capacity  of  public  institutions  and \nofficials to manage PPP processes, and (iii) increasing the volume of \nfinancing and availability of risk mitigation instruments to manage and \nallocate risks in line with the new business model. ADB is providing \nextensive  support  for  mainstreaming  PPP  in  India  through  four \nongoing technical assistance (TA) projects.  \n \nThe Government has also taken reform initiatives to develop financial \nmarkets and expand the suite of financial products for promoting PSP \nand  PPP.  As  result,  the  equity,  government  securities,  foreign \nexchange,  and  money  markets  along  with  their  corresponding \nderivatives  segments  are  now  reasonably  deep  and  liquid.  The \nreforms have also strengthened price discovery, eased restrictions on \ntransactions,  lowered  transaction  costs,  and  enhanced  liquidity. \nHowever, long-term investors, such as pension and insurance funds, \nhave  a  limited  presence  in  the  Indian  market  due  to  regulatory \nrestrictions.  Further,  domestic  investment  banks  are  inadequately \ncapitalized and the asset-liability position of many large commercial \nbanks may not support large scale infrastructure exposures.  \n ", "  iii\nWhile reforms to mitigate the financial constraints are ongoing and \ncontemplated, mobilizing available resources and catalyzing additional \nresources  still  presents  a  challenge.  The  tight  liquidity  in  the \ninternational financial markets as a result of the global financial crisis \nhas  further  constrained  the  flow  of  long-term  financing  for \ninfrastructure projects. In the circumstances, it is all the more important \nthat reforms promote a infrastructure financing model where existing \ninstitutional  capacity,  skills  products  and  services  are  leveraged \nthrough  partnerships  and  synergies  for  bridging  the  infrastructure \ndeficits through exchange of sector expertise, underwriting skills, and \nrisk management.  \n \nIndia  Infrastructure  Finance  Company  Limited.  In  this  context, \nIIFCL's operating paradigm as articulated in its 'Scheme' is designed \nto  catalyze  funds  as  part  of  a  lending  consortium,  and  leverage \nfinancing and project development skills available in the market. IIFCL \nprovides  innovative  financing  products  (e.g.,  long-term  debt  and \nsubordinated debt) required for PPP infrastructure subprojects that are \ncurrently scarce in the Indian market, despite financial sector reforms. \nThe  Government  guarantees  IIFCL's  borrowings  which  acts  as  an \nadditional  layer  of  credit  enhancement  for  investors  by  providing \nimplicit risk capital.  \n \nEstablished in January 2006, as the nodal agency for PPP under the \nCompanies  Act  (1956),  IIFCL  is  mandated  to  provide  financing  to \neligible infrastructure projects on commercial terms. As of the end of \nMarch 2009, IIFCL has a sanctioned pipeline of 88 subprojects, of \nwhich 85 have already reached financial closure. These projects have \nall been assessed for commercial and technical viability and have \nbeen  developed  by  independent  professional  project  development \nagencies. The total project cost of the sanctioned subprojects amounts \nto about $31 billion, of which IIFCL will take up around $4 billion, \nthereby every dollar of IIFCL's investment in subprojects will mobilize \nover  $7  from  the  market,  demonstrating  its  significant  ability  to \nleverage resources.  \n \nIIFCL has successfully supported PPP projects, particularly with ADB's \nloan (IIPFF I) amounting to $500 million, approved in December 2007 \nprovided through the MFF modality. IIPFF I has thus far financed 24 \nsubprojects. In addition to providing IIFCL with long-term funding, ADB \nhas  supported  IIFCL  with  technical  assistance  to  enhance  internal \ncredit risk assessment procedures and pricing policies. As a result of \nthis support, IIFCL is now planning to access the international bond \nmarkets  on  the  strength  of  its  own  balance  sheet  without  a \nGovernment  guarantee.  This  will  not  only  open  a  new  channel  of \nfunding for IIFCL but will also provide a benchmark for similar Indian \ncorporations in international markets. \n \nIIPFF  II.  The  IIPFF  II  is  designed  to  support  the  Government\u2019s \ninfrastructure  development  agenda.  IIPFF  II  will  provide  funds  at \ncommercial terms with more than 20-year maturities for infrastructure \n ", "iv   \nPPP subprojects. Funds at such terms are currently not available in \nthe domestic market. The global crisis has further constrained the \navailability of long-term funds in international capital markets. ADB's \nsupport to IIFCL will also encourage long-term investors to participate \nin IIFCL's market offerings.  \n \nSupport for the IIPFF II is an integral part of ADB\u2019s sector strategy, \nincluding the India country partnership strategy 2009\u20132012 and ADB's \nStrategy 2020. It complements ADB\u2019s parallel initiatives in contractual \nsavings, corporate bonds, PPP, and infrastructure development, all of \nwhich contribute to creating an enabling environment for infrastructure \ndevelopment  in  India.  The  IIPFF  II  is  closely  aligned  with  the \ndevelopment goal and targets set forth in the Government's 11th FYP. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of IIPFF II is to improve overall availability and reliability of \nphysical infrastructure in line with the targets of the 11th FYP. The \noutcome of IIPFF II include (i) increased private sector participation; (ii) \nimproved commercial lending terms (particularly those of IIFCL) for \ninfrastructure subprojects; (iii) strengthened institutional capacity for \nESSF  monitoring  and  implementation;  and  (iv)  catalyzing  of \ncomplementary resources and skills in the market. These are to be \nrealized  through  coordinated  efforts  of  ADB,  Japan  International \nCooperation  Agency,  KfW,  World  Bank,  IIFCL's  international \nsubsidiary, and private equity providers.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  An MFF of $700,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nprovided  in  multiple  tranches  at  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \nloan and guarantee agreements. IIFCL has provided ADB with (i) the \nreasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and \nnot made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB.  \n \nIndicative Financing Plan FY2009\u2013FY2013 \n($ million) \n \nSource  Total  % \nAsian Development Bank  700  6.36 \nLocal Market Borrowingsa  5,000  45.45 \nForeign Borrowingsb  5,300  48.18 \n  Total  11,000  100.00 \na Funds that India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited (IIFCL) will raise \nfrom the domestic market including insurance and pension funds and the \nnational savings scheme.  \nb Foreign borrowings include bilateral and multilateral sources and funds \nthat IIFCL will raise from the international capital markets. \nSources: Asian Development Bank estimates and India Infrastructure Finance \nCompany Limited. \n \nIndia  will  provide  a  sovereign  guarantee,  in  form  and  substance \nacceptable to ADB, for the term of each loan as a condition precedent \n ", "  v\nto the effectiveness of each tranche requested by IIFCL and provided \nby ADB pursuant to the terms of each loan agreement.  \n   \nSubloan Terms  IIFCL will relend funds received through the MFF (via subloans) to \neligible subprojects on commercial terms based on an independent \nassessment of subproject risk. The eligibility of the subprojects will be \nassessed in terms of compliance with the ESSF, the conditions of the \nScheme, and additional criteria agreed with IIFCL. The relending to \neligible  subprojects  will  be  preceded  by  an  upfront  evaluation  of \nsubprojects to ensure compliance with the ESSF to confirm that all \nsubprojects financed through the IIPFF II comply with ADB safeguard \nrequirements as with the IIPFF I.     \n   \nEstimated Project  Implementation of the IIPFF II is expected to be completed by 31 \nCompletion Date   December 2014.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization   The MFF will be available for a 5-year disbursement period (FY2009\u2013\nFY2013). The last PFR must be submitted to ADB no later than 31 \nMarch 2014. The last disbursement date will be 31 December 2014. \n   \nSubproject and  Each subproject and subborrower will satisfy at all times the subproject \nSubborrower  and  subborrower  selection  criteria  set  out  in  the  Scheme,  which \nSelection Criteria  includes appraisal for technical, economic, and commercial viability. In \naddition,  each  subborrower  will  (i)  be  selected  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time); \n(ii) have adequate resources and financial capability to raise resources \nto complete and operate the relevant qualified subproject successfully; \n(iii) not be in default on any prior loan to any participating members of \nthe consortium including IIFCL; (iv) be able to provide security as \nrequired  by  the  consortium  of  lenders;  (v)  maintain  appropriate \nfinancial records of income and expenditure to the satisfaction of ADB \nand IIFCL; and (vi) comply with ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements and \nnational  and  state  policies,  laws,  and  regulations  relating  to \nenvironment, resettlement, and indigenous peoples.    \n   \nImplementation  IIFCL will be the executing agency of the IIPFF II. Policy direction and \nArrangements  strategic oversight will be provided by IIFCL\u2019s board of directors. The \nproject management unit will monitor day-to-day implementation of the \nIIPFF  II  and  improve  IIFCL  capacity  for  identification,  screening, \nselection, and monitoring of all subprojects, including compliance with \nstate  and  national  policies  and  the  ESSF.  In  addition,  it  will  be \nresponsible for developing and implementing an investment program \nperformance monitoring system.  \n   \nProcurement and   All goods and services financed by the IIPFF II will be procured in \nDisbursement  accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). The individual loan proceeds will be disbursed in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). An imprest account will be established in \na current account with a commercial bank acceptable to ADB. The \nimprest amount, at any time, will not exceed (i) 10% of each loan \n ", "vi   \ntranche, or (ii) estimated expenditures for the first 6 months of project \nimplementation, whichever is lower. \n   \nFramework  IIFCL and the Government have entered into a framework financing \nFinancing  agreement  (FFA)  with  ADB.  The  FFA  satisfies  the  requirements \nAgreement  established  in  ADB's  Innovation  and  Efficiency  Initiative:  Pilot \nFinancing Instruments and Modalities. The FFA records the full set of \nassurances, warranties, and representations on crosscutting themes, \nincluding  safeguards,  governance,  anticorruption,  financial \nmanagement, procurement, disbursement, and subproject selection. \n   \nPeriodic Financing  The MFF proposal is accompanied by a PFR, received from IIFCL for \nRequest  the first tranche (PFR1) for $210 million. The PFR1 lists 14 subprojects \nfor ADB financing. The subprojects are all in the road and power \nsubsectors. The total cost of the subprojects is about $8.4 billion, of \nwhich IIFCL's exposure will be about $731 million.  \n \nBefore ADB accepts the PFR, IIFCL and the Government will ensure \nfull compliance with the terms and conditions of the FFA. \n   \nRetroactive  Retroactive  financing  may  be  possible  under  individual  loans  for \nFinancing  expenditures  incurred  up  to  12  months  before  the  signing  of  the \ncorresponding  loan  agreement,  with  a  ceiling  of  20%  of  the  loan \namount. IIFCL and the Government were informed that approval of \nretroactive financing does not commit ADB to financing any of the \nproposed subprojects. Each PFR will specify the nature of financing if \nretroactive financing is requested.    \n   \nBenefits and  The IIPFF II is designed to enable ADB to finance a wide range of \nBeneficiaries  subprojects  across  subsectors  rather  than  to  discretely  finance \nindividual projects. The transaction costs for ADB and the Government \nare  significantly  reduced  as  subproject  evaluation,  appraisal,  and \nfinancial  structuring  are  conducted  by  specialized  agencies \nseamlessly. The success of this approach is evidenced from the IIPFF \nI, which has already financed 24 infrastructure PPP subprojects. Under \nIIPFF I, IIFCL has leveraged over 5 times its own resources and IIPFF \nII is expected to improve the leverage ratio to at least 7. \n \nIIFCL is well-positioned to finance PPP subprojects emerging from the \nongoing ADB support for mainstreaming PPP. The development of \nPPP subprojects by professional project developers and consideration \nof such subprojects for financing by a consortium of investors and \nlenders, including IIFCL, ensures deepening of project preparation and \nfinancing skills in the country. With regard to expanding the required \nsuite of financing and risk management products, IIPFF II will enable \nIIFCL to provide long-term subordinated debt (mezzanine financing) to \nPPP  subprojects  which  increase  its  financing  options  for  PPP \nsubprojects.  Risk-based  pricing  of  subloans  by  IIFCL  provides  a \nbenchmark for corporate debt issuance which establishes the basis for \nallocating  capital.  The  same  will  guide  policymakers  in  initiatives \ndesigned to improve project returns for any given level of risk. \n ", "  vii\nInfrastructure  investments  lead  to  higher  farm  and  nonfarm \nproductivity,  employment  and  income  opportunities,  and  increased \navailability of wage goods thereby reducing poverty by raising mean \nincome  and  consumption.  The  IIPFF  II,  therefore,  is  expected  to \nreduce  poverty  and  increase  income  with  the  development  and \npromotion of PPP subprojects, especially in the transport and power \nsubsectors. Mobilization of private sector resources is envisaged to \nmitigate fiscal stress.  \n   \nRisks and  The envisaged benefits are based on several assumptions that are \nAssumptions  subject  to  varying  degrees  of  risk,  including  (i)  the  Government \ncontinues  to  prioritize  and  support  policy  actions  for  infrastructure \ndevelopment  through  PPP,  (ii)  the  Government  continues  its \ncommitment to maintain IIFCL as a commercially oriented entity, and \n(iii)  IIFCL  maintains  sufficient  institutional  capacity  and  staffing  for \nsmooth project implementation.  \n \nPotential risks include (i) a change in the Government infrastructure \ndevelopment  focus  away  from  PPP,  (ii)  poor  quality  of  the  IIFCL \npipeline resulting from weak internal capacity, and (iii) IIFCL's asset \nprofile having a high degree of concentration in a limited number of \ninfrastructure  subprojects  creating  concentration  risk.  The  following \nmitigating measures are in place.  \n \nThe  Government  has  reaffirmed  its  commitment  to  infrastructure \ndevelopment  and  the  role  of  the  private  sector  thereby  ensuring \neffective demand for IIPFF II. ADB and other development partners \nare closely involved in the policy dialogue with the Government and \nare  committed  to  supporting  initiatives  that  are  in  line  with  best \npractices. The evolution of IIFCL's Scheme has consistently reflected \nmarket requirements and is expected to do so going forward.  \n \nFactors mitigating weak internal capacity resulting in poor quality of the \nsubproject pipeline include (i) intensive appraisal of subprojects by \nIIFCL;  (ii)  the  emphasis  of  IIFCL\u2019s  mandate  and  Scheme  on \ncommitment  to  operating  autonomy,  good  governance,  and \ncommercial orientation; and (iii) ongoing ADB and World Bank support \nto IIFCL for developing systems, procedures, and human resources. In \naddition,  the  ongoing  ADB  TA  will  also  enhance  IIFCL's  project \nfinancing capacity and governance framework.  \n \nIIFCL's Scheme currently does not permit IIFCL to take an exposure in \nexcess of 20% of the total capital costs for any particular project; this \nensures sector and geographic diversification in the asset portfolio. \nThe ongoing efforts for mainstreaming PPP will help generate viable \nsubprojects in all parts of the country. \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL   \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited (IIFCL), to \nbe guaranteed by India, for the Second India Infrastructure Project Financing Facility (IIPFF II). \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNTIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  Reliable and high quality infrastructure is a critical determinant of productivity to support \nsustained economic growth and poverty reduction.1 While high quality infrastructure is essential \nto harness growth impulses in the economy, insufficient infrastructure capacity in India results in \nlower productivity, higher transport and logistic costs, and reduces competitiveness. With a \nhigher growth target and a rising population, even maintaining current levels of infrastructure will \nrequire significant increase in investments. Based on the targeted growth rate and identified \ndeficit,  required  infrastructure  investment  is  estimated  at  approximately  $514  billion. \nAccordingly, the goal of the Government of India (the Government) is to increase infrastructure \ninvestment from 4.5% to 9% of gross domestic product (GDP) during the 11th Five-Year Plan \n(FYP) period, FY2007\u2013FY2011.  \n \n3.  The global financial crisis negatively impacted growth rates in India as reflected in the \ndecline in GDP growth from 9.2% in FY2007 to 6.7% in FY2008. Growth is projected to decline \nto around 6% in FY2009.2 The crisis has also adversely affected private sector infrastructure \ninvestment due to a loss in investor confidence. Concurrently, fiscal constraints have impacted \npublic sector infrastructure investment. The impact of these factors is reflected in the reduced \ngrowth  rate  in  the  core  infrastructure  index  from  5.9%  in  FY2007  to  2.7%  in  FY2008.  In \nresponse to the crisis, the stimulus packages announced by the Government have prioritized \nsupport to the infrastructure sector. In addition, considering the magnitude of the infrastructure \ndeficits the Government has embarked on a broad-based reform agenda to enable greater \nprivate sector participation (PSP) in infrastructure investments. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n4.  As of 2008, an analysis of infrastructure capacity reveals that only the power subsector \nhas achieved capacity expansion in line with 11th FYP targets; while ports, airports, and roads \nare at 85%, 75%, and 50%, respectively.3 This is reflected in the situation prevailing in utilities of \nports, roads, railways, and airports subsectors which operate at close to or beyond capacity. An \n                                                 \n1  The 11th Five-Year Plan policy framework indicates that the percentage of the population living below the official \npoverty line has appreciably declined from 36% in fiscal year (FY)1993 to 28% in FY2004. However, the rate of \ndecline in poverty has not accelerated commensurate with the growth in gross domestic product (GDP), and the \nincidence of poverty among traditionally marginalized groups has shown an insignificant decline. Further, given \npopulation growth, the absolute number of poor has declined only marginally from 320 million to 302 million during \nthe same period. Other indicators of deprivation suggest that the proportion of the population deprived of a \nminimum level of living is much higher. For example, the National Family Health Survey 3 shows that almost 46% \nof children in the 0\u20133 year age group suffered from malnutrition in FY2005 showing almost no decline from the \n47% reported in 1998 by the National Family Health Survey 2. \n2  Projections provided by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the central bank, in April 2009 and based on the \nassumption of a normal monsoon.   \n3  McKinsey  and  Company,  Financial  Services  Practice.  2008.  Building  India,  Financing  and  Investing  in \nInfrastructure. New Delhi.  \n ", "2   \naverage of 21 days is required to clear cargo in India compared with 3 days in Singapore. The \nberths of Jawaharlal Nehru Port in Mumbai, which handles 60% of India\u2019s container traffic, can \nhandle nine cargo vessels while Singapore\u2019s main port can handle 40. India\u2019s national highways \naccount for only 2% of the total highway network and only 12% or 8,000 km of which are dual \ncarriageway.4 The situation is equally alarming in urban roads as evidenced by the drop in \naverage traffic speed in Delhi from 27 kph in 1997 to 10 kph currently. With regard to power, \npeak demand exceeds supply by almost 15% as several capacity initiatives for the 11th FYP are \nyet to come on line. World Bank estimates suggest that 9% of potential industrial output is lost \nto power cuts and 600 million Indians have no electricity at all. A detailed infrastructure sector \nanalysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n5.  Role  of  Public\u2013Private  Partnerships.  The  traditional  model  of  developing  and \nfinancing infrastructure is predicated on government ownership with the government bearing all   \nrisks. However, this model has limitations due to large investment requirements, growing fiscal \ndeficits, and limited capacity in the public sector in developing high-quality infrastructure. Thus, \nthe traditional model is being replaced with a new business model based on PSP, largely \nthrough  public\u2013private  partnerships  (PPP).  This  requires  the  entire  risk  matrix  of  project \ndevelopment, management, performance as well as market and credit risk to be optimally \nallocated  among  stakeholders.  The  planned  30%  private  sector  share  in  the  aggregate \ninfrastructure investment during the 11th FYP underscores the importance of the envisaged role \nof the private sector.5  \n \n6.  In line with the new business model, infrastructure development is being fostered by \ninitiatives  to  create  an  enabling  environment  to  sustain  PPPs  by  addressing  regulatory, \ninstitutional, and financing gaps. These include development of a risk allocation mechanism \nbased on the principle that risk should be allocated to stakeholders best able to manage and \nmitigate them. Ongoing initiatives include (i) addressing policy and regulatory gaps in several \ninfrastructure  subsectors,  (ii)  enhancing  the  capacity  of  public  institutions  and  officials  to \nmanage PPP processes, and (iii) increasing the volume of financing and availability of risk \nmitigation instruments to manage and allocate risks in line with the new business model.  \n \n1.  Policy and Regulatory Framework for Public\u2013Private Partnerships \n \n7.  Infrastructure Sector Reforms. Sectors are increasingly being opened to private and \nforeign investment. Levy of user charges is being promoted, and regulatory institutions are \nbeing set up and strengthened to create a PPP enabling environment. The command and \ncontrol mode relying on state ownership is evolving towards a model based on independent \nregulation and contract law. In this context, core regulatory tasks of independent regulatory \ncommissions include tariff setting, enforcing service standards, and fostering a subsidy and \ncross-subsidy framework.  \n \n8.  While  the  Government  has  enacted  and  amended  different  laws  and  regulations, \ncommon  regulatory  principles  are  needed  to  guide  and  evolve  regulatory  institutions.  In \nresponse, the Government has drafted the Regulatory Reform Bill,6 key provisions of which \ninclude establishing an institutional framework for regulatory commissions. The Bill further sets \nout the role of the regulatory commissions and their accountability to the legislature. Table 1 \nprovides an overview of the regulatory framework for the infrastructure sector.  \n                                                 \n4  Of the remaining national highways, 50% are two-lane and 38% are single-lane.  \n5  The total private sector investment envisaged during the 10th FYP was 17% of GDP.   \n6  Planning Commission. 2009.

Project Development and Management Process \n \n9.  To  increase  PSP,  capacity  to  manage  PPP  development  and  effectively  interface \nbetween  project  sponsors,  private  sector,  and  end  users  are  needed.  In  support  of  the \nGovernment's  holistic  approach,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  assistance \nincluding four ongoing technical assistance (TA)7 projects and long-term loans8 to facilitate all \nphases of the Government's efforts to mainstream PPP-led infrastructure development (Figure \n1). Project development and management process is mainstreamed by (i) establishing a PPP \ncell in the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance for coordinating and supervising \nnationwide PPP project development; and (ii) establishing PPP cells with in-house PPP and \nmanagement  information  systems  experts  in  17  states  and  7  central  line  ministries.  The \ncapacity of the PPP cells has been strengthened by training staff and exposing the PPP cells to \ninternational  best  practices.  The  PPP  cells  have  developed  a  potential  pipeline  of  PPP \nopportunities in urban transport, health, education, and water and sanitation indicating the \nsuccess of the TAs in mainstreaming PPPs.9 To promote commercial viability, IIFCL provides \nlong-term  financing  as  per  its  mandate  supported  by  the  First  India  Infrastructure  Project \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2006.

In addition, a website \n(footnote 9) exclusively devoted to PPP functions as a virtual marketplace for PPP.

Impact of Global Economic and Financial Crisis. In addition to limited availability of \nfinancing,  the  contagion  effects  of  the  global  financial  crisis  have  affected  India.  As  a \nconsequence  of  the  crisis,  external  financing  available  to  Indian  financial  institutions  has \ndecreased, forcing them to raise credit domestically. However, this substitution of financing \nsources squeezed domestic money and credit markets and put pressure on the rupee. To \nmanage volatility of the currency, RBI's interventions in the markets added to liquidity tightening. \nBeyond  the  financial  channels,  the  crisis  also  affected  confidence.  Tightened  liquidity  has \nincreased  risk  aversion,  making  banks  cautious.  In  response,  the  Government  announced \nstimulus  packages  in  December  2008  and  January  2009  to  expand  domestic  demand  by \nexpanding public expenditure and lowering taxes. Consequently, the fiscal situation suffered \nsetbacks15 with India's sovereign rating outlook downgraded from \u201cstable\u201d to \u201cnegative\u201d by an \ninternational credit-rating agency.16 Concerns raised by credit-rating agencies increased overall \nborrowing costs, contributing to delays in starting new projects and completing ongoing projects. \n \n13.  Given  large  infrastructure  financing  requirements,  all  potential  sources  need  to  be \ntapped by channeling available domestic and international funds into project finance. However, \nlong-term investors, such as pension and insurance funds, have a limited presence in the Indian \nmarket  due  to  regulatory  restrictions.  Further,  domestic  investment  banks  that  were  major \nparticipants in infrastructure in the 1990s are inadequately capitalized on a risk-weighted basis \nto support large scale infrastructure expansion. Most large public sector banks do not have \nproject  finance  experience  and  their  asset-liability  position  may  not  support  large  scale \n                                                 \n14  Of the $514 billion investment requirements, the total debt requirement is estimated at around $247 billion. The \nremaining investment is expected to come from internal cash generation and budgetary support for central and \nstate government projects, and from internal accruals and equity in private sector projects.  \n15  The two packages include (i) an across-the-board cut of 4% in ad valorem central value-added tax rate except for \npetroleum products, (ii) increase in foreign institutional investors investment limit in rupee-denominated corporate \nbonds in India from $6 billion to $15 billion, and (iii) authorization to IIFCL to raise $2 billion through tax-free bonds \nby 31 March 2009 for refinancing bank lending of longer maturity to eligible infrastructure PPP projects. \n16  However, India's sovereign rating by major credit-rating agencies remains at BBB\u2013. The fiscal deficit in India is \nsubject to the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act 2003. The Act requires that the fiscal deficit is \ncontained at 3% of GDP. While this has been relaxed to support countercyclical measures, the limits are expected \nto be reinstated when the impact of the crisis abates.  \n ", "6   \ninfrastructure exposures. Therefore, mobilizing available resources and catalyzing additional \nresources still presents a challenge. Thus, it becomes imperative that financial sector reforms \ncontinue in order to offer products and services to meet financing and risk management needs \nfor PPP infrastructure projects. These include long-term debt, risk-based lending and loan \nsyndication,  credit  enhancements  such  as  guarantees,  mezzanine  financing  (subordinated \ndebt), private equity capital raising, refinancing, cash management, general insurance, and \nadvisory services.  \n \n14.  In  response,  the  Government  has  taken  several  initiatives  to  develop  markets  and \nexpand the suite of financial products for promoting PSP and PPP. As a result, financial markets \nin India have developed significantly since financial sector reforms were initiated in the early \n1990s.  The  reforms  emphasized  strengthening  price  discovery,  easing  restrictions  on \ntransactions,  lowering  transaction  costs,  and  enhancing  liquidity.  Greater  domestic  market \nintegration has resulted from a series of policies. The equity, government securities, foreign \nexchange, and money markets along with their corresponding derivatives segments are now \nreasonably deep and liquid.  \n \n15.  Government  Securities  Market.  RBI  used  the  fiscal  deficits  of  the  mid-1990s  to \ndevelop the government securities market and the risk-free yield curve through a deliberated \ndebt issuance strategy. RBI also carried out additional reform measures including (i) creating a \nsystem of market makers in the form of specialized primary dealers; (ii) removing frictions in \ntrading, such as removing stamp duties and withholding taxes; (iii) establishing better trading, \nclearing and settlement infrastructure in the form of an online primary auction mechanism, a \ntrade reporting system, and an electronic order matching system; (iv) establishing a clearing \ncorporation for India; and (v) introducing innovations like collateralized borrowing and lending \nobligations. These reforms occurred in the context of a decline in inflation and interest rates \nfollowing the 1997 Asian crisis allowing traders in government debt to make trading profits\u2014\nencouraging the development of an active secondary market. While challenges remain, the \ngovernment securities market is generally considered a success story. \n \n16.  Corporate  Debt  Market.  Compared  with  the  government  securities  market,  the \ncorporate bond market is still underdeveloped with illiquid primary and secondary markets, \ninadequate tenors, and absence of risk management and credit enhancement instruments. The \nGovernment is considering initiatives to support market development, including (i) allowing \ndomestic financial institutions greater leeway to invest in corporate bonds; (ii) steadily raising \nthe limit on foreign investment in corporate bonds; (iii) amending the bankruptcy code to protect \nrights of unsecured creditors; (iv) reducing transaction costs in issuing and trading corporate \nbonds  by  reducing  the  need  for  repeated  disclosures,  as  well  as  high  stamp  duties;  and  \n(v) reducing the preference of banks for loans over bonds by subjecting both assets to similar \nmark-to-market requirements, especially for interest rate exposure. \n \n17.  Existing  Constraints. However, despite reforms, several financial products are not \navailable in India or markets are illiquid. Mezzanine financing, which is critical for funding \ninfrastructure projects, is limited due to the lack of a sufficiently large pool of infrastructure \nprojects and absence of pricing benchmarks. This inevitably led to an overwhelming reliance on \ndebt  financing,  which  in  itself  is  not  sufficient  for  meeting  the  diverse  financing  and  risk \nmanagement requirements. Further, while the primary market in corporate bonds has expanded \nand the issuance of such bonds has increased, the secondary market has not developed \ncommensurately. Development of credit derivatives has also not been significant.  \n \n ", "  7\n18.  Regulatory  and  institutional  problems  also  constrain  the  participation  of  financial \nintermediaries  in  infrastructure.  A  factor  limiting  the  participation  of financial  intermediaries \nstems  from  regulatory  uncertainty  raising  the  risk-profile  of  projects.  This  makes  financial \ninstitutions reluctant to finance infrastructure, particularly in the early stages. Restrictive policies \nand guidelines have further constrained the participation of insurance and pension funds. For \nexample, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority requires insurance companies \nto invest in debt with a minimum credit rating of AA, which excludes investment by insurance \ncompanies in debt instruments of most private infrastructure sponsors. These also accentuate \nthe limited availability of risk capital and long-term financing, and constrain availability of risk-\nbased pricing of loans and credit enhancement mechanisms.  \n \n19.  Further  limitations  include  relatively  few  professional  project  development  and \ntransactions advisory agencies. This is combined with a limited or non-existent PPP mandate \nfor other dedicated long-term infrastructure financing agencies17 and the fact that banks do not \nhave the ability to undertake large-scale project finance on their own and also have asset-\nliability constraints. On the other hand, agencies with project finance expertise do not have the \ncapital base to build up large scale exposure to projects. \n \n20.  While reforms to mitigate the existing constraints are ongoing and contemplated, these \nnecessarily  will  have  to  be  sequenced  over  a  medium-term.  Meanwhile,  specific  financing \nrequirements for PPP and the diverse skills sets to manage and allocate project risk dictates an \napproach that includes commercial long-term financing and leverages complementary skills in \nthe  market  to  develop  projects  and  allocate  risks.  To  significantly  increase  infrastructure \ninvestments through PPP, it is important that existing institutions, products and services are \nleveraged through partnerships and synergies. For instance, institutions offering specialized \nfinancing partnering with larger banks, project development agencies, and equity funds enable \nan origination and syndication approach coupled with transaction advisory to provide the range \nof financial services needed for achieving financial closure of PPP projects. This business \nmodel facilitates exchange of sector expertise, underwriting skills, and risk management.  \n \n21.  India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited. In pursuance of this business model \nfor  promoting  PPP  and  given  the  need  to  mobilize  all  available  resources,  IIFCL  was \nestablished with the mandate to (i) play a catalytic role by leveraging resources and specialized \nskills, and (ii) be a nodal PPP financing agency as an integral element of the overall PPP \ndevelopment strategy.18 IIFCL was set up on 5 January 2006 as a wholly owned Government \ncompany under the Companies Act 1956. IIFCL provides commercial long-term debt financing \nfor stand-alone nonrecourse infrastructure projects, such as project specific special purpose \nvehicles established for PPP, or projects that are units of larger corporate entities whose cash \n                                                 \n17  The Infrastructure Development Finance Company (IDFC) was promoted by the Government and government-\nowned financial institutions with other investors including ADB, International Finance Corporation, Government of \nSingapore Investment Corporation, and Commonwealth Development Corporation. IDFC\u2019s focus was purely on \ninfrastructure projects, when diversified PPP opportunities did not exist and there was a shortage of bankable \nprojects. In this context, IDFC developed large exposures to the power subsector before reforms took off and the \nlimited capital market did not allow IDFC to exit from unviable investments. Thus, in the case of IDFC, the tradeoff \nbetween expansion of loans and maintaining asset quality was not well understood. Subsequently, IDFC undertook \nan initial public offering in January 2006 and became privately owned. More recently, IDFC has focused more on \nfee-based income activities such as advisory services, asset management, and equity investments. Infrastructure \nLeasing and Financial Services has adopted a similar business model.  \n18  Other dedicated infrastructure financing nonbank financial institutions, such as Rural Electrification Corporation \nLimited and Power Finance Corporation Limited, have a limited subsector focus and do not have a PPP-specific \nmandate.   \n ", "8   \nflows can be \u201ccaptured.\u201d The Government guarantees all IIFCL borrowings. IIFCL's Articles of \nAssociation and Memorandum of Understanding are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n4.  Role of IIFCL in Promoting PSP and PPP  \n \n22.  IIFCL  operating  paradigm,  namely  the  Scheme  for  Financing  Viable  Infrastructure \nProjects through the India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited (the Scheme), provides \nIIFCL's  mandate  and  guides  its  business  plan  and  operations  manual.19 Recognizing  the \nconstraints in the domestic capital markets,20 the Scheme allows IIFCL to catalyze funds and \nevolve an origination and syndication approach. First, the Scheme allows IIFCL to take an \nexposure  not  exceeding  20%  of  total  capital  costs  in  a  project,  thus  requiring  consortium \nfinancing  with  loan  origination  occurring  at  a  lead  bank.21 This  also  protects  IIFCL  from \ndeveloping a concentrated asset profile that resulted in the restructuring of earlier financial \ninstitutions dedicated to project financing (footnote 17). Second, the Scheme requires IIFCL to \nestablish in-house risk assessment and management capabilities enabling IIFCL to price loans \non a risk basis marking a shift in the pricing mechanism for infrastructure loans.22 Third, IIFCL \nprovides subordinated debt at longer tenors expanding the suite of infrastructure financing \nproducts and enhancing the availability of risk capital. This also promotes commercial viability of \nprojects. Fourth, IIFCL is mandated to extend the tenor of loans to pure private sector projects \nby a minimum of 2 years beyond the longest tenor offered by commercial lenders, underscoring \nIIFCL's role in enhancing commercial viability of projects. Fifth, the Scheme requires project \nappraisal to be done by specialized agencies thereby leveraging diverse skills to address the \nrequirements  of  financing  complex  projects.  Finally,  the Scheme  requires  IIFCL  to  finance \ncommercially viable projects only. \n \n23.  In addition to providing direct debt financing, IIFCL has undertaken other initiatives to \npromote PPP including (i) participating in the India Infrastructure Finance Initiative, which is a \nprivate  equity  fund  with  an  investable  corpus  of  $875  million;  (ii)  establishing  the  India \nInfrastructure  Finance  Company  (United  Kingdom)  Limited  as  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary \nmandated to borrow from RBI and relend resources to Indian infrastructure companies for \nforeign currency expenditures outside India; and (iii) providing refinancing to reduce the asset \nand  liability  mismatch  of  banks,  enabling  them  to  continue  financing  projects  and  sustain \ninvestor interest in PPP. The success of this approach can be judged by the leverage achieved \nby IIFCL in catalyzing market resources (para. 28) and the reduction in transaction costs to ADB \ncompared with discreetly financing individual projects to achieve the same development impact. \nMarket analysis of the role of IIFCL is in Appendix 3.  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n19 The Scheme was notified, to the Committee on Infrastructure headed by the Prime Minister, by the Ministry of \nFinance, Department of Economic Affairs vide O.M. No. 10/12/2005-INF dated 4 January 2006. Under the \nprovisions of the Scheme, the Government may review it at the end of 5 years or earlier if required. The Scheme \nwas first amended on 23 April 2007 and, subsequently, additional amendments have expanded and further defined \nthe role of IIFCL in line with the evolving infrastructure financing scenario in India. The Scheme is provided in \nSupplementary Appendix B. \n20 When financial markets are illiquid or deviate from the economic price, markets become incomplete not permitting \ninnovations to provide the set of products required for the financial closure of PPP projects. \n21  The lead bank is defined as a bank in the lending consortium that takes the maximum exposure to the project. \n22  Currently, 80%\u201385% of infrastructure loans are estimated to be priced below prime lending rates of banks.  \n ", "  9\n5.  Performance Assessment of India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited  \n \n24.  As part of its support for PPP in India, ADB provided an MFF of $500 million (IIPFF I) to \nIIFCL in December 2007 to support its long term financing role.23 During the midterm review for \nIIPFF  I,  ADB  noted  enhancements  in  IIFCL's Scheme,  reporting  requirements,  institutional \nstructure, operating framework, and disbursements. The first periodic financing request (PFR1) \nfor $300 million of IIPFF I is disbursed for 24 subprojects. The remaining amount of IIPFF I is \ncommitted to identified subprojects for which due diligence has been completed. As such, the \nresidual disbursements for IIPFF I will be achieved against phased subproject benchmarks, \nincluding the progress of subproject implementation plans and needs of subproject sponsors \n(para. 45).  \n \n25.  Under IIPFF I, ADB and IIFCL staff visited all subproject sites to ensure compliance with \nADB's safeguard requirements. IIFCL prepared safeguard due diligence reports for review prior \nto ADB approval. The compliance review for the IIPFF I with regard to legal aspects contained \nin the framework financing agreement (FFA) and the environmental and social safeguards \nframework (ESSF) is in Supplementary Appendix C.  \n   \n26.  Financial  Performance  and  Risk  Management.  As of  31 March 2009, IIFCL had \nauthorized capital $400 million and paid-up capital of $263 million representing a significant \nincrease in paid-up capital from $2.2 million when it was established in January 2006. IIFCL had \nan operating profit of around $20 million in FY2008 compared with about $5 million in FY2007, \naugmenting the capital base. As of 31 March 2009, IIFCL had outstanding infrastructure loans \nof about $990 million, compared with about $343 million in the previous year. IIFCL's capital \nbase is expected to be augmented periodically by capital infusion by the Government and \ninternal accruals. In support of its asset expansion, IIFCL's borrowings amounted to close to $3 \nbillion as of 31 March 2009 compared with around $709 million in the previous year.  \n \n27.  Analysis of IIFCL's balance sheet and income statements reveals growing financial \nstrength and market presence (Table 3). IIFCL's increased borrowings are supported by a \nstronger capital base through direct equity infusions. While the figures in Table 3 are derived \nfrom IIFCL's audited financial statements as of 31 March 2009, IIFCL's un-audited financial \nstatements  as  of  30  June  2009  reflect  an  additional  $60  million  equity  infusion,  further \nstrengthening  IIFCL's  capital  structure.  IIFCL's  growing  profitability  and  sustainability  are \nreflected in its financials, as is the fact that being a debt-financing institution its loan assets are \nfinanced by market borrowings. IIFCL has maintained a debt service coverage ratio of more \nthan 1, and has no arrears in the repayment of its current debt obligations.  \n \nTable 3: Key Financial Ratios of India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited \n \nRatio  31 March 2009  31 March 2008 \nDebt/Equity   10.80  4.20 \nDebt/Total Assets   0.95  1.08 \nProfit after Tax ($ million)  21.82  5.38 \nROI (%)  1.71  0.88 \nROE (%)  8.88  7.47 \nROI = return on investment, ROE = return on equity.  \nSources: Asian Development Bank estimates and India Infrastructure \nFinance Company Limited. \n                                                 \n23  ADB 2007.

Demonstration of Resources Leverage. Since the commencement of its operations in \nJanuary 2006, IIFCL has received 192 project proposals, of which it has sanctioned 107 eligible \nprojects as per the Scheme. However, due to the ongoing financial crisis with resulting market \npressure  and  loss  in  investor  confidence,  the  flow  of  funds  to  infrastructure  has  been \nconstrained. Reflecting the decline in the flow of credit, the total volume of IIFCL's sanctioned \nsubprojects declined in FY2008 to $362 million compared with $1.7 billion in the previous year. \nOn the contrary, disbursements for the sanctioned projects showed a strong upward trend \nduring FY2008. As of the end of August 2009, IIFCL had a sanctioned pipeline of 88 projects, of \nwhich 85 have already reached financial closure. The total project cost of the sanctioned 88 \nprojects is about $32 billion, of which IIFCL will finance about $4.0 billion. Thus for every $1 of \nIIFCL's investment, over $7 will come from the market reflecting IIFCL's catalytic role. The list of \nsubprojects sanctioned by IIFCL is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n29.  Operations Manual and Corporate Governance Framework. IIFCL developed and \nadopted an operations manual in April 2009 stipulating the processes and guidelines to be \nfollowed  by  each  department.  The  manual  establishes  risk  management  and  assessment \nprocesses and details functional separation between loan origination, credit risk assessment \nand rating, pricing and disbursal functions. The manual also details IIFCL's accounting, legal, \ncredit risk assessment and management, human resources policies, as well as the Board \nprocedures and the functioning of the chairman and managing director's secretariat. The human \nresources  and  organization  structure  are  being  further  enhanced  in  line  with  credit  risk \nassessment  and  management  requirements.  A  review  of  corporate  governance  and \norganization structure of IIFCL is in Appendix 4. \n \n30.  IIFCL's Scheme can only be amended by the Empowered Committee of Secretaries 24 to \nthe Government, and amendments need to be signed off by the Finance Minister or the Prime \nMinister. IIFCL is regulated under the Scheme by a separate Oversight Committee,25 thus \nseparating IIFCL's policy making and regulatory arms. IIFCL is governed by the Companies Act \n1956,  which  prescribes  operating  norms  including  Board  composition  and  responsibilities, \nconflict  of  interest  rules,  disclosure,  and  financial  performance.  Despite  not  being  formally \ngoverned by RBI regulations, as a self-regulatory measure IIFCL adopted RBI norms for (i) \nnonperforming assets, (ii) asset classification, (iii) provisioning, (iv) income recognition, (v) credit \nconcentration,  (vi)  special  reserve  maintenance  (capital  requirements),  (vii)  liquidity \nrequirements, and (viii) resource raising. IIFCL will annually review and report its adherence to \nits Board. Finally, under IIFCL's three tier audit framework audit reports are regularly placed \nbefore the Board Audit committee. \n  \n31.  Business Plan for FY2009. IIFCL's business plan projects a cumulative loan sanction of \naround $4.8 billion and disbursements of $2.2 billion including subordinated debt for FY2009, \ncompared  with  loans  of  $3.8  billion  and  disbursements  of  $900  million  in  FY2008.  The \ndisbursements  are  expected  to  be  supported  by  higher  utilization  of  lines  of  credit  from \nmultilateral and bilateral institutions. IIFCL also projects an operating profit of $45 million in \nFY2009 compared with $20 million in FY2008. A significant factor contributing to the expansion \nin IIFCL\u2019s balance sheet is expected to come from the power subsector especially through the \ntwelve 4,000 megawatt (MW) (each) ultra-mega-power projects (all super critical technology) to \n                                                 \n24  The Empowered Committee comprises the secretary, economic affairs; secretary, planning commission; secretary, \nexpenditure; secretary, financial sector, and, in his/her absence, special secretary and/or additional secretary \n(financial sector); and secretary of the line ministry dealing with the subject. \n25  The Oversight Committee is being constituted to review IIFCL's performance in line with the Scheme on a biannual \nbasis. The oversight and empowered committees have no common membership.  \n ", "  11\nbe developed by the private sector with a capital cost of around $3.14 billion each.26 Contract \nawards have been awarded to four of these, which are expected to reach financial closure in \nFY2009. In addition, as many as 17 road projects are expected during FY2009\u2013FY2010 with a \ntotal project cost of $2.4 billion, offering significant opportunities for IIFCL financing. \n \n6.  Asian Development Bank Strategy and Assistance  \n \n32.  Strategy.  ADB's  country  operations  and  business  plan  200827 and  India  country \npartnership strategy 2009\u20132012,28 which are closely aligned with ADB's long-term strategic \nframework (2008\u20132020) (Strategy 2020),29 are designed to support the Government's efforts to \naddress infrastructure constraints as laid down in the 11th FYP.30 According to Strategy 2020, \nADB will focus its operations in five core areas, including infrastructure and environmentally \nsustainable development. Further, ADB will scale up private sector development and operations \nin all operational areas, reaching 50% of annual operations by 2020. The 11th FYP highlights \ninfrastructure,  agriculture  and  water  management,  and  employment  generation  while \nemphasizing inclusive growth. In addition, the Government has facilitated private investment \nmanifested through PPP in the infrastructure sector. Supporting the same, ADB strategies, \nincluding through the IIPFF II, will (i) support the process of inclusive and environmentally \nsustainable growth in India; (ii) catalyze investment through the use of innovative business and \nfinancing  modalities  (e.g.,  PPP,  nonsovereign  operations,  tapping  the  carbon  market,  and \ngreater cofinancing); (iii) strengthen, among others, the results orientation of project design and \nimplementation; and (iv) support regional cooperation. In addition, in line with the three pillars of \nits Energy Policy (2009),31 ADB supports energy sector development (i) to promote efficiency, \n(ii) maximize access, and (iii) promote sector reform and capacity building.  \n \n33.  Sector Assistance. Since India began to borrow from ADB in 1986, ADB has assisted \npublic sector infrastructure projects especially in transport and power. As of 30 April 2009, \nADB's infrastructure portfolio in India includes 66 projects (energy, power, transport, roads, \nrailways, and communications) totaling more than $12.08 billion, and 129 technical assistance \nprojects totaling more than $67.75 million (Appendix 5). \n \n34.  To catalyze investment, ADB supports the Government's efforts to promote PPP in \ninfrastructure.  A  series  of  TA  projects  (footnote  7)  are  being  provided  to  several  state \ngovernments and central (infrastructure) line ministries to build capacity for identifying and \nappraising projects for the PPP mode of finance. Significant capacity building has improved  \n(i) PPP project preparation, appraisal, and evaluation skills; (ii) operationalization of identified \nPPP opportunities; (iii) the PPP regulatory and policy framework; (iv) bidding documents and \nprocedures; (v) compliance with public safety norms; (vi) the building of a PPP database; and \n(vii) conduct of value-added research. In addition, ADB has provided sector-specific TA to \n                                                 \n26  As of February 2009, 12 ultra-mega-power projects were planned in Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, \nJharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra (2), Orissa (2), and Tamil Nadu (2).  \n27  ADB. 2008.

The ADB-funded Financial Sector Program33 supported the development of a \ndiversified, competitive, and market-based financial sector. Building on this, financing for the \nCapital Market Development Program 34 helped establish an integrated national capital market \nsystem. With regard to market development, ADB has also been actively engaged in insurance \nand  pension  reforms.35 These  programs  have  increased  operating  and  market  efficiency, \nreduced costs and risks, improved market accessibility, strengthened investor protection, and \nenhanced the availability of long-term funds for infrastructure and industry.  \n \n35.  Lessons. The IIPFF II incorporates lessons36 from earlier financial intermediation loans \nfor infrastructure37 and, in particular, from implementing IIPFF I. First, IIFCL will conduct the \nrequired assessment of environmental and social safeguards compliance of subprojects at all \nstages of the project cycle and not only at subproject design. Further, the track record and \nenvironmental performance of subproject borrowers will be taken into account for subprojects \nsupported by ADB. For subprojects at the implementation stage, due diligence will focus on the \nsubproject's environmental performance through a compliance audit and on-site assessment. In \naddition, the IIPFF II has drawn on the IIPFF I experience for ensuring strong and sustainable \ninstitutional capacity of IIFCL to comply with the safeguards requirements. Additional assurance \nis  included to  ensure  that  IIFCL  develops  in-house  expertise  on  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards to monitor and evaluate subprojects on an ongoing basis (para. 85, xviii).  \n \n36.  Second,  building  a  strong  partnership  among  stakeholders,  including  subproject \ndevelopers, executing agency, Government, and ADB is essential to meaningfully pursue PPP \ndevelopment  in  India.  Therefore,  a  holistic  approach  has  been  undertaken  to  support  the \nGovernment's infrastructure development priorities and assist executing agencies with capacity \nbuilding, policy advice, and provision of financing to promote PPP.       \n                                                 \n32  ADB. 1998.

The  country  assistance  program  evaluation38 stresses  the  importance  of  effective \ndemand and sector relevance when designing financial intermediary loans. Keeping this in view, \nIIPFF  II  is  being  processed  in  concert  with  Government's  efforts  to  create  an  enabling \nenvironment for mainstreaming PPP and for financing PPP development and implementation. \nIIPFF II supports IIFCL\u2019s ability to leverage resources and expand the infrastructure investor \nbase and sustain a tested business model that has resulted in a robust pipeline of projects. The \ncountry  assistance  program  evaluation  also  identifies  the  need  to  develop  corporate  bond \nmarkets, enhance the institutional investment base and enhance corporate governance.  \n \n7.  External Assistance and Donor Coordination  \n \n38.  External  Assistance.  As  of  May  2009,  the  World  Bank  (including  International \nDevelopment  Assistance)  had  an  infrastructure  investment  portfolio  of  55  projects  totaling \n$12.45 billion.39 As of December 2008, the Japan International Cooperation Agency had more \nthan 100 official development assistance loan projects, 50 grant aid projects, and 40 technical \ncooperation projects, of which its official development assistance loan commitment to India \nstands at \u00a51,240.27 billion (approximately $13.68 billion).40 The Japan Bank for International \nCooperation (JBIC) provides support through its nonsovereign window. Currently, JBIC has a \ntotal nonsovereign exposure to infrastructure amounting to around $623.7 million from loans \nand guarantees. The German Government through Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW) has \nextended \u20ac590.29 million ($879.53 million) to finance projects in India in energy, watershed \ndevelopment, rural water supply, and transport and communication.41 External assistance to the \ninfrastructure sector in India from key development partners is summarized in Appendix 6. \n \n39.  Donor Coordination. ADB coordinated with the JBIC, Japan International Cooperation \nAgency, KfW, and the World Bank during the processing and implementation of IIPFF I as well \nas the processing of the IIPFF II (Appendix 7). In addition to financing support to IIFCL, the \nscope of coordination with development partners cover (i) developing and operationalizing the \nESSF  (ii)  providing  technical  assistance  to  IIFCL,  and  (iii)  finalization  of  the  financial \nmanagement assessment (FMA).  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED FACILITY \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n40.  The  impact  of  IIPFF  II  is  to  improve  overall  availability  and  reliability  of  physical \ninfrastructure  in  line  with  the  targets  of  the  11th  FYP.  The  outcome  of  IIPFF  II  include  \n(i) increased private sector participation, (ii) improved lending terms (particularly those of IIFCL) \nfor infrastructure subprojects, and (iii) strengthened institutional capacity for ESSF monitoring \nand implementation, and catalyze complementary resources and skills in the market. These are \nto be realized through coordinated efforts of ADB, Japan International Cooperation Agency, \nKfW, World Bank, IIFCL's international subsidiary, and private equity providers.  \n \n \n                                                 \n38  ADB. 2007.

Outputs \n \n41.  The outputs of the IIPFF II can be categorized into three areas: \n \n(i)  High-quality  and  commercially  viable  infrastructure  assets.  IIFCL's \ninvestment program will create high-quality viable infrastructure assets across \nsectors including projects for roads (56), power (22), ports (5), airports (2), and \nurban infrastructure (1). IIFCL will finance 14 subprojects (Appendix 8) through \nthe IIPFF II. \n \n(ii)  Cofinancing  and  provision  of  innovative  financing  instruments,  and \nenhanced investor participation. The IIPFF II will assist IIFCL in catalyzing the \nflow of domestic and foreign funds into PPP projects in India. The Government \nguarantee  of  IIFCL's  borrowings  (including  the  ADB  loan)  and  IIFCL's \nsupplementary  financing  initiatives  enable  financing  options  beyond  products \ncurrently offered by the market. These include subordinated debt and risk capital, \nwhich  is currently  scarce.  In  addition,  ADB  support  to  IIFCL  will  provide  an \nadditional layer of assurance to investors in IIFCL's longer tenor corporate debt \nissuances. The IIPFF II is expected to help catalyze $7.6 billion of investments \nfrom the private sector to finance the 14 PPP subprojects. \n \n(iii)  IIFCL institutional capacity. The IIPFF II seeks (a) to improve IIFCL's financial \npolicies and risk management system including development and adoption of an \nintegrated risk management system and installation of relevant hardware and \nsoftware, and (b) to enhance implementation of the updated ESSF.42  \n \nC.  Special Features  \n \n42.  Public\u2013Private  Synergy.  The IIPFF II is part of the Government\u2019s  integrated PPP \ndevelopment strategy and draws on extensive ADB support for infrastructure development \nthrough PPP. IIFCL is well-positioned to finance PPP subprojects emerging from the ongoing \nADB support for mainstreaming PPP. The development of PPP subprojects by professional \nproject developers (Infrastructure Development Finance Company and Infrastructure Leasing \nand Financial Services) and consideration of such projects for financing by a consortium of \ninvestors and lenders, including IIFCL, ensures deepening of project preparation and financing \nskills in the country. ADB is uniquely placed to finance PPP subprojects by offering customized \nfinancing options through its public and private sector windows.  \n \n43.  Efficiency and Effectiveness. The IIPFF II is designed to enable ADB to finance a wide \nrange of subprojects across subsectors rather than to discretely finance individual projects. The \ntransaction costs for ADB and the Government are significantly reduced as project evaluation, \nappraisal, and financial structuring are conducted by specialized agencies seamlessly. The \nsuccess  of  this  approach  is  evidenced  from  the  IIPFF  I,  which  has  already  financed  24 \ninfrastructure PPP subprojects. Under IIPFF I,  IIFCL has leveraged about 5 times its lending \nand IIPFF II is expected to achieve a leverage ratio of about 7.  \n \n44.  Enhancing Investor Confidence. The IIPFF II has been processed when liquidity in the \ninternational financial markets is tight and investor interest in long duration instruments are low. \n                                                 \n42  The ESSF will be updated based on the National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy (2007) expected to be \nenacted in 2009, and ADB's new Safeguard Policy Statement, to be effective on 20 January 2010. \n ", "  15\nIn this situation, access to long-term financing through IIPFF II reduces the need for subproject \ndevelopers to front-load tariffs and improves affordability of services to the end user. In addition, \nIIPFF II is designed to catalyze private sector debt and equity fund flow into PPP subprojects \nthat will improve subproject financials and promote commercial viability.  \n \n45.  Application of MFF. The provision of financing through the MFF modality 43 to IIFCL is \nwell suited for PPP. PPP subprojects are typically developed in a phased manner based on \nproject implementation requirements that can involve long gestation periods. Therefore, the \nMFF modality provides IIFCL with flexibility to release financing in line with subproject readiness \nbased  on  achievement  of  phased  benchmarks  including  finalization  of  risk-sharing \narrangements, readiness of engineering and procurement contracts, phased release of equity \nby subproject promoters, and so on. This enables IIFCL to be an effective partner of the lending \nconsortium. Finally, with MFF the performance of earlier tranches can serve as an indicator to \nguide the financing modality of subsequent tranches.  \n \nD.  Policy Dialogue for Continued Financing Support for PPP  \n \n46.  ADB  engages  in  policy  dialogue  on  infrastructure  and  PPP  at  various  levels  of \ngovernment (para. 9). In this context, ADB is also extensively engaged with IIFCL to ensure \nevolution and enhancements of the Scheme in line with infrastructure financing requirements as \nwell as systems and processes needed to expand its product and services. The policy dialogue \nhas  focused  on  market  gaps,  institutional  and  capacity  development  needs  within  IIFCL, \nfinancial  and  pricing  policies  and  mechanisms  as  well  as  the  evolving  reforms  in  the \ninfrastructure and financial sectors.44 As a result of this intensive engagement, the IIPFF I was \ndesigned to demonstrate a business model for financing PPP that leverages partnerships and \nsynergies between institutions and their products and services (para. 20). This business model \nis now widely considered as part of second generation infrastructure reforms. As a result, ADB \nthrough  IIPFF  II  and  the  World  Bank 45 has  extended  further  support  to  ensure  that  PPP \nsubprojects have continued access to long-term financing in the context of the adverse impact \nof the financial crisis. IIPFF II has been processed in a more mature policy environment for \nPPPs and IIFCL's institutional capacity for mainstreaming PSP and PPP. ADB will also provide \nTA to the Government for enhancing the PPP policy and regulatory framework.   \n \n47.  The deepening and widening shelf of PPP projects has significantly increased IIFCL's \nfunding requirements. With immense infrastructure gaps, the domestic financial market is still \nnot equipped to provide more sophisticated risk management and financing products in the \nvolume, scale and scope required to meet infrastructure PPP project requirements. Taking a \nmedium-term perspective, further ADB support to IIFCL in addition to lines of credit, would aim \nat promoting a wider range of financial and risk management products and services required by \nthe increasingly diverse project requirements for attaining financial closure. This may include \ndeveloping arrangements and capacity in IIFCL to offer credit enhancements such as credit \nwrap insurance to projects46 and partial guarantees for the exposures of commercial banks to \ninfrastructure projects.47  The partial credit guarantee for the exposure of commercial banks will \n                                                 \n43 ADB. 2005.

Manila. \n44 ADB has supported IIFCL in obtaining an international credit rating from an international credit rating agency and \nacquiring hardware and software for accessing and managing credit risk and for pricing loans commensurately.  \n45 The World Bank has approved a $1.195 billion loan to IIFCL in September 2009.  \n46 Credit wrap offered by IIFCL has the potential to accord subproject special purpose vehicle (SPV) with the rating on \npar with IIFCL which will then enable the subproject to access domestic insurance funds (see para. 18) \n47 The rating of project specific SPVs which are in the BB and BBB range attract a risk weight of 100% to 150% as \nper Basel norms. \n ", "16   \nreduce the risk weight of the guaranteed portion that would result in lower capital requirements \nand, thus the freed up capital could be leveraged further. Additionally, IIFCL could also be \nsupported to offer 'takeout financing\u2019, which can help free up capital of commercial banks for \nfinancing additional projects.48 IIFCL is also planning to access the international bond markets \non the strength of its own balance sheet without government guarantee. This will open an \nadditional channel of funding and also provide a benchmark for similarly rated Indian corporates \nin international markets.  \n \nE.  Investment Plan  \n \n48.  As of the end of August 2009, IIFCL had a pipeline of 88 sanctioned projects with a total \ncost of Rs1,472.80 billion ($31.90 billion); IIFCL\u2019s financing is estimated at Rs184.48 billion \n($4.0 billion). Its lending pipeline is expected to grow on average by 25 projects per year during \nthe investment program period (FY2009\u2013FY2013). As a result of these asset additions, IIFCL\u2019s \nbalance sheet is expected to grow to around $11 billion during the same period.  \n \nF.  Financing Plan \n \n49.  Table  4  summarizes  the  indicative  financing  plan  for  FY2009\u2013FY2013  under  the \nassumption that IIFCL\u2019s balance sheet will grow to $11 billion.  \n \nTable 4: Indicative Financing Plan FY2009\u2013FY2013 \n($ million) \n \nSource  Total  % \nAsian Development Bank  700  6.36 \nLocal Market Borrowingsa  5,000  45.45 \nForeign Borrowingsb  5,300  48.18 \n  Total  11,000  100.00 \na  Funds that India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited will raise \nfrom the domestic market, including insurance and pension funds \nand the national savings scheme.  \nb  Foreign borrowings include bilateral and multilateral sources and \nfunds that India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited will raise \nfrom international capital markets. \nSources: Asian Development Bank estimates and India Infrastructure \nFinance Company Limited.  \n \n50.  IIFCL,  through  the  Government,  has  requested  financing  through  an  MFF  of \n$700,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to finance part of its Investment Program. \nAccordingly, the MFF is included in the India country operations business plan for FY2009. The \nMFF  will  have  multiple  tranches,  with  the  first  tranche  programmed  for  \n$210  million  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Innovation  and  Efficiency  Initiative:  Pilot  Financing \nInstruments and Modalities.49 The MFF loans will have an interest rate set in accordance with \nADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge, and \n                                                 \n48 \nUnder take-out financing, institutions engaged in long term financing such as IIFCL, agree to 'take out' loans from \nthe books of banks financing infrastructure projects after a fixed time period (e.g. 5 years), when the project \nreaches certain previously defined milestones. This ensures that projects get long-term funding from various \nparticipants. This will enable banks to participate in infrastructure project financing despite having short term \nliabilities (deposits) and not suffer adverse asset-liability mismatches. \n49  ADB. 2005. Innovation and Efficiency Initiative: Pilot Financing Instruments and Modalities. Manila.  \n ", "  17\nsuch other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft loan and guarantee agreements.50 \nIIFCL has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB's LIBOR-\nbased lending facility, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent \ndecision and not made based on any communications or advice from ADB.  \n \n51.  The Government will provide a sovereign guarantee in form and substance acceptable \nto ADB, for the term of each loan as a condition precedent to the effectiveness of each tranche \nrequested by IIFCL and provided by ADB pursuant to the terms of each loan agreement. \n \n52.  Framework Financing Agreement. IIFCL and the Government have entered into an \nFFA with ADB. The FFA satisfies requirements established in ADB\u2019s Innovation and Efficiency \nInitiative:  Pilot  Financing  Instruments  and  Modalities.  The  FFA  records  the  full  set  of \nassurances,  warranties,  and  representations  on  cross-cutting  themes  covering  safeguards, \ngovernance, anticorruption, financial management, procurement, disbursement, and subproject \nselection. Before ADB accepts the periodic financing request (PFR), the Government and IIFCL \nwill ensure full compliance with the terms and conditions of the FFA. \n \n53.  Periodic Financing Request. Multipurpose subloans will be extended under the IIPFF II \nto a range of subprojects subject to submission of the related PFR by IIFCL and execution of \nrelated loan and guarantee agreements. Each PFR will be accompanied by a list of subprojects \nidentified for financing under the IIPFF II, including subprojects that can be substituted for \nsubprojects not in compliance with ADB requirements. ADB has received the first tranche \n(PFR1) for $210 million to finance infrastructure subprojects (Appendix 8). The subsequent \ntranches are of $250 million (second) and $240 million (third).  \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n54.  Project Management. IIFCL will be the Executing Agency for the IIPFF II. IIFCL\u2019s board \nof directors will provide policy direction and strategic oversight. IIFCL\u2019s Project Management \nUnit (PMU), established under the IIPFF I, will monitor day-to-day implementation of the IIPFF II \nand build capacity of IIFCL in areas of identification, screening, selection, and monitoring of all \nsubprojects, including compliance with state and national policies and the ESSF. In addition, \nIIFCL will be responsible for developing and implementing an investment program performance \nmonitoring system (IPPMS). The implementation schedule is provided in Appendix 9. \n \n55.  Subproject Identification. The selection of subprojects is based on agreed selection \ncriteria (para. 56). The 14 subprojects under the proposed IIPFF II have been selected based on \nthe  agreed  criteria.  The  selection  criteria  stress  commercial  and  technical  viability  and \ncompliance with relevant national and ADB norms. Further, the identified subprojects will be \napproved by ADB for eligibility based on an agreed approval procedure (para. 57) that ensures \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguard  due  diligence  and  fulfillment  of  ADB  disclosure \nrequirements. The required due diligence and documentation requirements are being conducted \nfor  the  14  subprojects  to  ensure  subproject  readiness  to  absorb  financing  of  ADB  loan \nproceeds. \n \n56.  Subproject  and  Subborrower  Selection  Criteria.  The  Scheme  defines  the \nsubborrower  and  subproject  selection  criteria,  appraisal  and  monitoring  mechanisms,  and \nlending  terms  for  subprojects  (Supplementary  Appendix  B),  which  include  appraisal  by  a \n                                                 \n50  ADB rules on commitment charges, which are in effect when a tranche is provided, will apply with respect to such \ntranche. \n ", "18   \nspecialized and designated appraisal agency for technical, economic, and financial viability.51 In \naddition, each subborrower funded under the IIPFF II will \n \n(i)  be  selected  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time); \n(ii)  have adequate resources and financial capability to raise resources to complete \nand operate the relevant subproject successfully; \n(iii)  not be in default under any prior loan from IIFCL or from any of the participating \nmembers of the consortium of lenders;  \n(iv)  be able to provide security as required by the consortium of lenders; \n(v)  maintain  appropriate  financial  records  of  income  and  expenditure  to  the \nsatisfaction of IIFCL and ADB; and \n(vi)  comply  with  and  cause  each  subproject  to  comply  with  ADB's  safeguard \nrequirements and national and state policies, laws, and regulations relating to \nenvironment, resettlement, and indigenous peoples applicable at the date the \nrelevant PFR is submitted. \n \n57.  Approval Procedure. Subprojects under the IIPFF II will be processed as follows. \n \n(i)  IIFCL will review the preliminary designs and cost estimates for all subprojects \nproposed under the respective tranches as approved by the lending consortium.  \n(ii)  Prior to the preparation of each PFR, the applicability and relevance of the \ncommon  ESSF  for  environmental  assessment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and \nindigenous peoples will be reviewed and updated to ensure its relevance and \nconsistency with applicable country frameworks, and ADB's environmental and \nsocial safeguard policy and procedural requirements.  \n(iii)  In  formulating  each  new  PFR,  IIFCL  will  conduct  due  diligence  on  potential \ncandidate subprojects to ascertain their compliance with the ESSF. IIFCL will \nforward to ADB its findings, supported by other relevant safeguard documents, \nincluding  as  applicable,  the  initial  environmental  examination,  environmental \nassessment report, and environmental management plan, or environmental audit \nand  collective  action  plans  as  required,  for  information  and  review.  ADB's \nfindings will be forwarded to IIFCL, which will fulfill additional ADB requirements, \nas required for any compliance gaps. In addition, any subproject financed under \nthe IIPFF II will follow the approved common ESSF. \n(iv)  IIFCL will submit the compliance certificate, along with the PFR, to ADB for \napproval. \n \n58.  A PFR will (i) state the tranche amount; (ii) list subprojects to be financed under the \ntranche;  (iii)  will  include  appraisal  reports  (or  project  information  memorandum)  for  listed \nsubprojects including the environmental assessment report52 and appropriate resettlement and \nindigenous peoples plan, if any; (iv) detail cost estimates and the financing plan; (v) detail \nimplementation  arrangements;  (vi)  confirm  the  continuing  validity  and  adherence  to  FFA \nprovisions; (vii) confirm compliance with provisions under previous loan agreements; and (viii) \n                                                 \n51  IIFCL's Scheme requires IIFCL to only finance commercially viable projects, provide financing on commercial \nterms, and price loans accordingly. Thus, all aspects of project economics and credit worthiness with regard to \nprojects are subject to extensive due diligence prior to loan approval by IIFCL. Further, as the Scheme requires \nIIFCL to finance projects in critical infrastructure subsectors only, a positive development impact is expected.      \n52  For  projects  categorized  as  environment  category  B\u2013sensitive  or  category  A,  ADB\u2019s  120-day  rule  for  the \nsubmission of the PFR will apply. \n ", "  19\nprovide other information required under IIPFF II administration memorandum which will be \nprepared  and  agreed  upon  by  ADB,  the  Government,  and  IIFCL  to  facilitate  MFF \nimplementation and processing. \n \n59.  Maximum Subloan Size and Free Limit. As IIFCL is limited by its Scheme to financing \nup to 20% of subproject cost, ADB will not stipulate any additional limitation on subloan size. \nHowever, all subloans under the first tranche will be subject to prior review and approval of \nADB.  For  subsequent  tranches,  a  suitable  free  limit  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  ADB's \noperations manual53 may be determined for IIFCL, based on ADB's assessment of IIFCL's \noperating performance, appraisal standards, portfolio quality, management, average loan size, \nand the subproject pipeline. However, ADB reserves the right to review subprojects even below \nthe free limit to ensure safeguard compliance.  \n \n60.  Period of Utilization. The utilization period will be up to 31 December 2014. To ensure \ntimely implementation in line with the Government\u2019s emphasis on the disbursement readiness of \napproved loans, IIFCL will prepare a detailed disbursement plan for the PFR of the tranches. \nThe final PFR should be submitted no later than 31 March 2014. \n \n61.  Procurement. All procurement to be financed under an ADB loan will be carried out in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and will \ncomply with the operations manual adopted by the IIFCL board of directors (14 November \n2008).54 ADB  will  encourage  IIFCL  to  require  its  subborrowers  to  adopt  internationally \ncompetitive bidding procedures to the extent possible when the amount of the investment is \nunusually large, and economy and efficiency can be gained by following such procedures. For \nprocurement of goods and services to be financed by sub-loans from the ADB loan, IIFCL will \nensure that the price paid is reasonable and that account is taken of factors such as time of \ndelivery, efficiency, and reliability. For build-operate-transfer projects and their variants, if the \nsubproject sponsor or engineering procurement and construction contractor is selected through \ncompetitive bidding among international entities in accordance with procedures acceptable to \nADB, such engineering procurement and construction contractor may apply its own procedures \nfor procurement provided that such procurement is for goods, services, and works supplied from \nor produced in ADB member countries.  \n \n62.  Disbursement Arrangements. IIFCL will ensure that the individual loan proceeds under \nthe IIPFF II will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as \namended from time to time). While making disbursements, IIFCL will review the utilization report \nfor each subproject verified by a chartered accountant and lead bank. The utilization report will \nbe accompanied by an engineer\u2019s certificate. IIFCL will establish an imprest account in a current \naccount with a commercial bank acceptable to ADB. The imprest amount, at any time, will not \nexceed (i) 10% of each loan tranche, or (ii) estimated expenditures for the first 6 months of \nproject implementation, whichever is lower.  \n \n63.  Financial  Management.  An  FMA  to  examine  IIFCL's  financial  and  fiduciary \nmanagement capacity for implementing the IIPFF II was undertaken (Supplementary Appendix \nE).55 The  FMA  concluded  that  IIFCL  has  adopted  accounting  systems  in  line  with  norms \n                                                 \n53  ADB. 2003. Operation Manual. Section D6/OP: Financial Intermediation Loans. Manila (15 December, para. 7).  \n54 ADB. 2007. Procurement Guidelines. Manila (para. 3.12).  \n55  The FMA is based on discussions with various officials of IIFCL, Indian Credit Rating Agency Limited, and the \nWorld Bank. The World Bank conducted its own financial management assessment and the ADB and World Bank \nteams shared the findings of their respective assessment reports. \n ", "20   \nprescribed by the Institute of Charted Accountants of India and supported by standardized \nsoftware. IIFCL undertakes (i) a concurrent internal audit by an external firm of chartered \naccountants, (ii) a statutory audit by an independent firm of chartered accountants appointed by \nthe comptroller and auditor general of India,56 and (iii) a supplementary audit by the comptroller \nand auditor general of India. IIFCL has constituted an audit committee in line with Section \n292(A) of the Companies Act, 1956 which reports directly to the Board. As part of the IIPFF II, \nIIFCL will closely monitor physical and financial progress of subprojects based on utilization \ncertificates provided by the firm of chartered accountants and lead banks prior to disbursements \nin line with Government norms. ADB reserves the right to verify IIFCL's financial accounts and \nthose of related entities. \n \n64.  Governance  and  Anticorruption  Policy.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with IIFCL. Consistent with its commitment to \ngood  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  review  and \nexamine,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the \nsubprojects  under  the  IIPFF  II.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the bidding documents for projects \nunder the IIPFF II. In particular, all subprojects financed by ADB in connection with the IIPFF II \nshall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to review and examine the records and \naccounts of the Borrower, subborrowers, suppliers, contractors, and other service providers as \nthey relate to the subprojects.  \n \n65.  Under its operations manual, IIFCL discloses to its Board all financial relationships and \ntransactions of nonexecutive directors in its annual report. The compensation of all Board \nmembers is also disclosed. IIFCL management is required to disclose to the Board all material, \nfinancial,  and  commercial  transactions  where  members  of  management  have  a  personal \ninterest and transactions where such members have a potential conflict of interest with the \ninterests of IIFCL.57 In the event that a director is an interested party in a transaction, based on \ndisclosure, the director may not, in any way, take part in or influence arrangements in the \ntransaction, in accordance with Section 300(1) of the Companies Act. The management of \nIIFCL provides a clear description of contingent liabilities and associated risks.    \n \n66.  In addition, IIFCL has a \u201cwhistle blower\u201d policy to maintain ethical standards. Under this \npolicy, staff members who notice unethical or improper practices are able to approach the audit \ncommittee without informing their supervisors. On review of the compliant, the audit committee \ndesignates an investigation officer, who is required to submit a report within 30 days, or 3 \nmonths  if  the  case  has  vigilant  overtones.  The  case  may  then  be  investigated \ninterdepartmentally  or  may  be  entrusted  to  the  Central  Bureau  of  Investigation.  Once  an \ninvestigation is initiated, the interdepartmental authorities or the Central Bureau of Investigation \nare responsible for conducting the entire process to its logical conclusion including drafting of \nthe charge sheet and conduct of criminal proceedings. \n \n67.  Accounting,  Auditing,  and  Reporting. IIFCL, through the PMU, will establish and \nmaintain separate records for works, goods, and services financed from the loan proceeds. \nIIFCL  will  maintain  separate  project  accounts  according  to  generally  accepted  accounting \nprinciples for all expenditures incurred under the IIPFF II and the subprojects, whether out of \nloan proceeds or from other sources, and record, in a transparent manner, all funds received \nfrom the Government, ADB, and other sources. \n                                                 \n56  Gupta Nanda and Company is the statutory auditor.  \n57  Nondisclosure is a punishable offense under Section 299(4) of the Companies Act.  \n ", "  21\n68.  IIFCL, through the PMU, will maintain detailed consolidated annual project accounts to \nbe audited by independent auditors with qualifications, experience, and terms of reference \nacceptable to ADB. The accounts will be submitted to ADB within 6 months at the end of the \nfiscal year. The annual audit report will include a separate audit opinion on the use of loan \nproceeds, use of the imprest account, free limit, and compliance with financial loan covenants. \nIIFCL has been made aware of ADB\u2019s policy regarding delayed submission of audits and its \nrequirements for a satisfactory and acceptable audit of accounts. \n \n69.  Retroactive Financing. IIFCL may request retroactive financing for the first PFR under \nthe MFF. For subsequent loans, ADB may agree to a request for retroactive financing of civil \nworks, equipment, and materials, subject to the request being made under following PFRs and \nbeing in accordance with the agreed procedures and guidelines. All such requests will be \nassessed on a subproject-by-subproject basis to ensure that the proposals demonstrate (i) the \nexpenditures incurred are genuine, reasonable, and material to getting the subproject started; \nand (ii) they were incurred for proper reasons, in a transparent manner, over a reasonable \nperiod of time. These arrangements will facilitate the readiness of subprojects under the IIPFF II \nand will be considered for subsequent subprojects during the processing of individual PFRs. \nThe total eligible expenditure under retroactive financing will not exceed an amount equivalent \nto 20% of the individual loan and must have been incurred not more than 12 months before \nsigning of the related legal agreements. However, approval of retroactive financing does not \ncommit ADB to finance the subprojects being developed under the IIPFF II. Before being \naccepted for retroactive financing, subprojects will be reviewed and certified by IIFCL for ESSF \ncompliance. \n \n70.  Subproject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation. IIFCL will be responsible for \nestablishing an IPPMS acceptable to ADB within 6 months from the signing of the FFA and \nPFR1. For the IPPMS, IIFCL will first select a set of clearly measurable performance monitoring \nindicators relating to implementation, improvements, institutional development, and capacity \nbuilding milestones including those in the design and monitoring framework. IIFCL will establish \nbaseline data for each of the selected indicators within 6 months of the date that the PFR1 \nunder IIPFF II takes effect. Subsequently, IIFCL will conduct annual surveys and update ADB \non progress against each indicator. IIFCL will submit quarterly progress reports attached to the \nfacility administration memorandum and submit to ADB a completion report within 3 months \nafter the completion of all subprojects identified for financing. \n \n71.  Subproject Review. Subproject review is designed to ensure that all ADB funds to \nIIFCL are relent only to subprojects that comply with the ESSF and other ADB requirements. \nFurther, all subproject sites will be visited by environmental and social safeguard consultants, \nand the compliance reports submitted to ADB for review. Thus, ADB will have prior information \non  subproject  location,  development  impact,  and  potential  environmental  and/or  social \nsafeguards issues and will have the ability to reject subprojects not in compliance with ADB \nrequirements. In addition, IIFCL is continuously upgrading its internal subproject monitoring \ncapabilities as indicated in the assurances (para. 85).  \n \n72.  ADB will, at its discretion, conduct reviews of the management, financial, and operating \nprocesses of IIFCL and subprojects financed under the IIPFF II, with regard to the potential pool \nof funds that could be generated in the event of tenor differentials between ADB loans to IIFCL \nand IIFCL's relending. ADB monitoring will ensure that the usage is compliant with ADB norms \nand conforms to subproject eligibility and approval guidelines.   \n \n ", "22   \n73.  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  The  performance  of  the  IIPFF  II  will  be  periodically \nreviewed using the design and monitoring framework by (i) IIFCL through the PMU (quarterly), \n(ii) IIFCL\u2019s board of directors (semiannually), and (iii) ADB (annually). The PMU will complete \nthe report based on its quarterly review by the 10th day following the end of the quarter. IIFCL\u2019s \nBoard will forward the semiannual progress reports to ADB by the 10th day of the month \nfollowing the semiannual review. ADB will review the quarterly progress reports and semiannual \nreports, and undertake annual review missions during the tripartite reviews chaired by the \nGovernment. In addition, a midterm review of the investment program will be conducted in \nFY2011. The review will cover disbursements, implementation progress (including progress of \ncapacity building initiatives), ESSF implementation, and the status of the IPPMS. The review will \nidentify weaknesses and suggest changes in scope, outputs, and due diligence, as required. \n \nIV.  INVESTMENT PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n \n74.  Benefits  of  the  IIPFF  I.  The IIPFF I generated significant benefits as it supported \nindustrial and agricultural development by reducing vehicle operating costs, minimizing delay in \npassenger and freight movements, and reducing accidents. Specifically, the IIPFF I supported \nthe National Highway Development Program of the Government by financing upgrading of the \nnational and state highway networks by widening existing roads and building new highways. \nOverall, the IIPFF I supported upgrading and expansion of more than 1,100 km of the road \nnetwork across the country. Given that on average, 20,000 person-days of employment are \ngenerated per km of road construction, the IIPFF I will result in about 22 million person-days of \nemployment. This increased employment opportunity will significantly benefit rural workers in \nthe unorganized sector. Following the IIPFF I success, the IIPFF II is envisaged to increase \ninfrastructure investment, particularly through PPP, to achieve the goal of attracting 30% of \noverall infrastructure investment from the private sector by 2012. The IIPFF II also envisages \nfinancing  subprojects  for  roads,  power,  and  airports;  and  increase  overall  availability  and \nreliability of physical infrastructure in India. Improved infrastructure investment will in turn lead to \nhigher productivity, employment, income, and other economic benefits. The summary poverty \nreduction  and  social  strategy  is  in  Appendix  10.  Promotion  of  infrastructure  development \nthrough PSP also mitigates fiscal stress both at the central and state levels. \n \n75.  Demonstration Effect as a Model Institution. The $700 million IIPFF II, while small in \nrelation to requirements, will have a demonstration effect in restoring investor confidence amid \nthe  global  financial  crisis.  Moreover,  IIFCL  has  introduced  best  practices  in  infrastructure \nfinancing including through innovative financial products and technology. As a result, other ADB \ndeveloping member countries are currently replicating the institutional and operational model of \nIIFCL to suit their specific circumstances. Therefore, building upon the success of IIPFF I and \nthe strong partnership established among stakeholders during IIPFF I implementation, IIPFF II \nwill help IIFCL sustain and continue its successful operations as well as perfect its business \nmodel in promoting PPP in infrastructure financing in India.  \n \n76.  Economic and Financial Returns. IIPFF II is expected to catalyze an investment of \naround over $7.5 billion from the private sector to finance 14 subprojects. While the projects \nsanctioned by IIFCL are spread across all infrastructure subsectors, the majority of subprojects \nidentified for the IIPFF II are for roads and energy. The economic efficiency of road projects is \ntypically high with an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) in the 25%\u201330% range and \nfinancial internal rate of return (FIRR) in the 10%\u201315% range. The estimates are also robust \nfrom a sensitivity point of view with the EIRRs and FIRRs not declining significantly even in \n ", "  23\nworst case scenarios. Further, the EIRRs and FIRRs are significantly above the opportunity cost \nof capital. IIPFF II is also expected to finance power generation and airport projects where EIRR \nestimates also meet benchmark requirements.58 \n \n77.  Environmental and Social Safeguards. ADB took the lead during processing of IIPFF \nI59 in developing a common ESSF60 (Supplementary Appendix F) in consultation with JBIC, \nKfW,  and  World  Bank  for  harmonizing  the  safeguards  policy  framework  for  environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples in 2007. IIFCL has adopted the ESSF and \nimproved in-house capacity with ADB support. The ESSF is uploaded on IIFCL\u2019s website.61 \nAdditional improvements are under way with the support of the ongoing capacity development.62 \nIIFCL will continue to ensure all subproject proposals, to be financed under the IIPFF II, comply \nwith  the  requirements  of  the  ESSF.  IIFCL  will  appoint  qualified  specialists  in  areas  of \nenvironmental and social safeguards to build in-house capacity for which an advertisement has \nbeen placed on IIFCL's website. The ESSF will be reviewed and updated taking into account \nADB Board approval of the Safeguard Policy Statement,63 expected approval of the Indian \nNational Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy, and ADB's experience in implementing the \nESSF under the IIPFF I.  \n \n78.  Enhanced Project Financing Framework. In line with the growing balance sheet and \nthe requirements of the Scheme, IIFCL has evolved a risk assessment and rating migration \nframework to address credit and market risks. Risk-rating templates were introduced and every \nloan proposal is subjected to risk rating with ADB assistance. In addition, a framework to \naddress asset and liability mismatches as well as portfolio monitoring mechanisms is being \nestablished. Risk-based pricing of subloans by IIFCL provides a benchmark for corporate debt \nissuance and provides the basis for allocating capital and building up assets based on risk-\nreturn criteria. The same will guide policymakers in initiatives designed to improve project \nreturns for any given level of risk. The demands of international rating agencies provide IIFCL \nwith an incentive to adopt best practices for ensuring an investment grade rating and managing \nborrowing costs.64 \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n58 According to a review paper, Sector Assistance Program Evaluation for the Energy Sector in India 2007, by ADB's \nIndependent Evaluation Department, the EIRRs of ADB-funded energy sector projects in India were higher than \n12% ranging from 13% to 31.5%, implying economic efficiency in resource allocation and use.  \n59  The process of preparing the environmental and social safeguards framework was guided by ADB\u2019s Environmental \nand Social Safeguards Division. The first meeting of the development partners took place on 9 February 2007 and \nthe second on 13 August 2007. The draft social safeguards framework was uploaded to the ADB website on  \n17 August 2007. Available at http://www.adb.org/Documents/Resettlement_Plans/IND/40655/default.asp. \n60  The common safeguards frameworks include (i) the anticipated impacts of the components or projects likely to be \nfinanced under the MFF on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples; (ii) safeguards \ncriteria to be used in selecting projects; (iii) requirements and procedures to be followed to screen and categorize \nprojects, conduct impact assessments, develop management plans, hold public consultations, and disclose public \ninformation (including the 120-day disclosure rule, if required), and monitor and report the progress of such projects \nor project components; (iv) the institutional arrangements (including budget and capacity requirements); and  \n(v) IIFCL\u2019s and ADB\u2019s responsibilities and authorities for the preparation, review, and clearance of safeguards \ndocuments. \n61  Available at http://www.iifcl.org/whatsnew_details.php?wid=18. \n62  Under the IIPFF I, two national (one environmental and one social safeguards) specialists were hired in July 2007.  \n63  ADB.

Assumptions, Potential Risks, and Mitigation \n \n79.  The envisaged benefits and impacts are based on several assumptions that are subject \nto varying degrees of risk, including (i) the Government continues to prioritize and support policy \nactions  for  infrastructure  development  through  PPP;  (ii)  the  Government  continues  its \ncommitment  to  maintain  IIFCL  as  a  commercially  oriented  entity;  and  (iii)  IIFCL  maintains \nsufficient institutional capacity and staffing for smooth project implementation.  \n \n80.  Potential risks include (i) a change in the Government infrastructure development focus \naway from PPP, (ii) poor quality of the IIFCL pipeline resulting from weak internal capacity; and \n(iii)  IIFCL's  asset  profile  having  a  high  degree  of  concentration  in  a  limited  number  of \ninfrastructure subprojects creating concentration risk. The following mitigating measures are in \nplace.  \n \n81.  Government  Commitment.  The  Government  has  reaffirmed  its  commitment  to \ninfrastructure development and the role of the private sector thereby ensuring effective demand \nfor IIPFF II. ADB and other development partners are closely involved in the policy dialogue with \nthe Government and are committed to supporting initiatives that are in line with best practices. \nThe  evolution  of  IIFCL's  Scheme  has  consistently  reflected  market  requirements  and  is \nexpected to do so going forward.  \n \n82.  Institutional Capacity. Factors mitigating weak internal capacity resulting in poor quality \nof  the  subproject  pipeline  include  (i)  intensive  appraisal  of  subprojects  by  IIFCL;  (ii)  the \nemphasis  of  IIFCL\u2019s  mandate  and  Scheme  on  commitment  to  operating  autonomy,  good \ngovernance, and commercial orientation; and (iii) ongoing ADB and World Bank support to \nIIFCL for developing systems, procedures, and human resources.  \n \n83.  Portfolio Diversification. IIFCL's Scheme currently does not permit IIFCL to take an \nexposure in excess of 20% of the total capital costs for any particular project; this ensures \nsector  and  geographic  diversification  in  the  asset  portfolio.  The  ongoing  efforts  for \nmainstreaming PPP will help generate viable subprojects in all parts of the country. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n84.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and IIFCL have given the \nfollowing  assurances,  which  will  be  incorporated  in  the  individual  loan  agreement(s)  as \napplicable and mutually agreed by the Government and ADB for each tranche under the MFF.  \n \n85.  The Government and IIFCL will ensure the following:  \n \n(i)  The Government remains committed to the implementation of the Scheme for \nFinancing Viable Infrastructure Projects through IIFCL as further amended from \ntime to time. In the event of any change in the Scheme, the Government, IIFCL, \nand ADB will assess the potential impact on the IIPFF II and evaluate any \nchange in scope, amendment, or continuation, as appropriate, of the IIPFF II. \n(ii)  IIFCL complies, at all times, with the prudential norms as made applicable to it by \nthe Government, including capital adequacy, income recognition, classification, \nand provisioning of nonperforming assets. \n(iii)  IIFCL maintains a debt service coverage ratio of at least one and ensures that it \nhas no arrears in repayment of its current debt obligations. \n(iv)  The subprojects and subborrowers meet the eligibility criteria agreed with ADB, \n ", "  25\nincluding financial and economic viability and positive development impact. \n(v)  The onlending rates to subborrowers are market-based and adequate to cover all \ncosts and risks associated with onlending, including any foreign exchange risk. \n(vi)  The subborrowers adopt and implement appropriate procurement procedures \nthat  are  based  on  competitive  bidding  and  foster  economy,  efficiency,  and \ntransparency.  \n(vii)  A  subloan  to  a  subborrower  is  made  for  only  such  subproject  that  involves \nprocurement of goods, works, and consulting services from ADB's developing \nmember countries and the amount of which is at least equal to the size of the \nsubloan for such subproject. \n(viii)  IIFCL  will  provide  long-term  finance  to  eligible  infrastructure  subprojects  in \naccordance with the requirements of its Scheme. IIFCL will select subprojects for \nfinancing in accordance with the selection and approval criteria. IIFCL will ensure \nthat the eligibility requirements for subproject and subborrower selection criteria \nof the IIPFF II adhere to the Scheme. \n(ix)  All subprojects are submitted to ADB for prior review, unless otherwise agreed \nbetween ADB and IIFCL. \n(x)  The environmental management system framework, as set out in the ESSF, is \nimplemented in accordance with its terms.

Further, that for \neach  subproject,  environmental  assessment,  as  applicable  such  as  initial \nenvironmental  examination,  environmental  impact  assessment,  and  the \nenvironment management plan, or environmental audit including collective action \nplans if required, are submitted to ADB for review and approval before IIFCL \nsubmits the PFR; and that for any category A or environmentally sensitive B \nsubproject, the initial environmental examination or the summary environmental \nimpact assessment is made available to the public 120 days before a PFR is \nsubmitted to ADB.  \n(xi)  IIFCL will implement the social safeguards framework, as set out in the ESSF, is \nimplemented in accordance with its terms. IIFCL will ensure that each subproject, \nwhich involves land acquisition and has resettlement impacts, is implemented \nand  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  ESSF \nacceptable  to  ADB,  and  the  resettlement  plan  is  submitted  to  ADB  before \napproval. IIFCL will also ensure that an adequate number of staff are trained and \ndeployed to fully implement and comply with the ESSF. \n(xii)  IIFCL will cause each qualified enterprise to ensure that each subproject, which \ninvolves  land  acquisition  and  has  resettlement  impacts,  is  undertaken  in \ncompliance with all the applicable laws of India, the relevant State of India, and \nADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995),  or  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009) as effective on the date the PFR is submitted. Further, the \nresettlement  plans  for  those  sub-projects  proposed  for  financing  under  the \nFacility are submitted to ADB for approval for ADB financing. Furthermore, each \nsubborrower is required by IIFCL to ensure that (a) all land and rights-of-way \nrequired for subprojects are obtained in a timely manner, (b) the provisions of the \nresettlement  plans  are  implemented  in  accordance  with  the  terms,  (c)  all \ncompensation and resettlement assistance is given to the affected persons prior \nto their dispossession and displacement and commencement of civil works, (d) \n ", "26   \nresettlement  plans  are  updated  upon  completion  of  the  detailed  design  and \nsubmitted  to  ADB  for  approval  prior  to  commencement  of  civil  works,  (e) \nadequate  staff  and  resources  are  committed  to  supervising  and  monitoring \nimplementation  of  the  resettlement  plans,  and  (f)  an  independent  agency \nacceptable to ADB and IIFCL is engaged by the subborrower to monitor and \nevaluate results of implementation of resettlement plans and forward reports to \nADB and IIFCL as required. \n(xiii)  IIFCL shall (a) implement the recommendations set out in the human resources \nassessment65 in  accordance  with  the  procedures  described  therein,  and  (b) \nupdate ADB on the status of implementation of the human resources assessment \nin each quarterly progress report provided to ADB. \n(xiv)  Subprojects  do  not  adversely  affect  vulnerable  groups,  such  as  indigenous \npeoples,  and,  in  the  event  of  any  impact  or  their  involvement,  IIFCL  will \nimplement  the  social  safeguards  framework  as  set  out  in  the  ESSF  in \naccordance with its terms to ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous \nPeoples (1998), or ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) as effective on the \ndate the PFR is submitted; \n(xv)  Accountability and transparency in IIFCL are maintained in its operations through \nstakeholder meetings and publication of progress reports through the duration of \nthe IIPFF II.

Average economic growth of 8.6% in India over the past 3 years has resulted in the \ninfrastructure sector in India being stretched significantly beyond capacity. Spiraling demand for \nair travel; reliable power supply; and efficient ports, roads, and railways have not been matched \nby a proportionate increase in supply. Severe supply-side bottlenecks are acknowledged to \nretard the economy\u2019s potential rate of growth. To improve India\u2019s poor roads, narrow bridges, \nand dilapidated airports, which choke the flow of goods and people, a large injection of capital \ninto the system is required. Maximum attention is being given in policy to the infrastructure \nsector to ensure that supply shortages do not trigger runaway inflation.  \n \n2.  Decades of underinvestment in roads, ports, airports, and power have left India with a \nsevere infrastructure deficit. Roads in the main cities are frequently clogged with heavy traffic \nand 90% are structurally unsuitable for loaded trucks. Ports are running close to full capacity. \nStructural impediments in the financial system coupled with the global economic and financial \ncrisis have constrained capital flows to the sector, perpetuating the deficit in core public goods \nand persistent inefficiencies in the economy. If India improves its physical infrastructure, the \nentrepreneurial drive is estimated to respond with double-digit growth.  \n \nA.  Role of the Private Sector in Infrastructure Development  \n \n3.  The consensus among policy formulators is growing that the private\u2013public partnership \n(PPP) mode holds the key to developing infrastructure in the country. In the past, the state \ndominated infrastructure with limited private sector participation. It is now dismantling long-\nstanding barriers and actively encouraging private investment in large infrastructure projects. \nPrivate sector companies have been invited to manage airports, which used to be exclusively \ngovernment-run. The Government of India (the Government) is also helping private sector \ndevelopers by mitigating some of the risks in road projects. The introduction of private capital in \ntelecommunications  and  aviation  has  demonstrated  that  this  introduces  discipline  of  time \nmanagement and leads to remarkable results even within the short term. To harness private \nsector  efficiencies  in  design  and  construction  of  infrastructure  projects,  the  Planning \nCommission envisages that at least 75% of incremental investment in infrastructure will come \nfrom the private sector, some in the form of fully private ventures and others as PPPs.1 The aim \nis to ensure that infrastructure does not become a capacity constraint on 9% growth rate of the \neconomy.  This  is  feasible  when  investment  in  infrastructure  grows  to  about  9%  of  gross \ndomestic product (GDP) compared with the current 4.5%. The infrastructure requirements of \nIndia and the envisaged role of the private sector during the 11th Five-Year Plan (FYP) period \nare provided in Table A2.1.  \n \n4.  To meet the infrastructure deficit and address the financing and project management \ncapabilities of the private sector, the Government has taken several initiatives to provide the \nnecessary environment in which the private sector can operate both via direct private sector \nparticipation  as  well  as  through  PPP  arrangements.  These  include  (i)  introducing  model \nconcession  agreements  in  various  subsectors  such  as  roads,  ports,  and  airports;  \n(ii) establishing independent regulatory mechanisms to enforce service standards and improve \ncash flow stability; (iii) encouraging participation of long-term financiers in the market through \n                                                 \n1  Public sector has been the main provider of basic infrastructure in India. However, public financing\u2014already limited \nby the deficit reduction provisions of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act 2003\u2014will not be able \nto generate alone the needed levels of investments to improve infrastructure facilities.  \n ", "Appendix 2  33\ncredit enhancement measures and provision of implicit risk capital; and (iv) reforming the capital \nmarkets to support long-term financing instruments and implicit risk capital. Government policy \ninitiatives indicate that it is being driven by a desire to make infrastructure inclusive. The overall \nreform agenda is being pursued to ensure that policy and regulatory frameworks under which \ninfrastructure is developed, promote contestable markets that ensure competitive pricing of \nservices provided by natural monopolies.  \n \nTable A2.1: Sector Investment Requirements for the 11th Five-Year Plan \n($ billion) \n \nSubsector  FY2007  FY2008 FY2009 FY2010  FY2011  Total \nElectricity  20.49  25.39  31.60  39.51  49.65  166.63 \nRoads  12.96  13.70  14.80  17.09  19.99  78.54 \nTelecommunication  7.84  9.53  12.15  15.41  19.67  64.61 \nRailways  8.52  10.24  12.38  15.10  19.18  65.45 \nIrrigation  6.87  8.98  11.80  15.64  20.11  63.33 \nWater Supply   4.82  5.70  6.83  8.32  10.27  35.93 \nPorts  3.10  3.70  4.34  5.00  5.85  22.00 \nAirports  1.30  1.38  1.48  1.66  1.92  7.74 \nStorage  0.94  1.02  1.11  1.21  1.31  5.59 \nGas  0.68  0.75  0.83  0.93  1.03  4.21 \nTotal   67.52  447.24  97.32  119.87  148.98  514.03 \nPublic Sector (%)  71.08  70.69  70.27  69.37  69.01  69.87 \nPrivate Sector (%)  28.92  29.31  29.73  30.63  30.99  30.13 \nSource: Planning Commission, Government of India.  \n \nB.  Current State of Infrastructure \n \n5.  The  infrastructure  deficit  in  India  requires  large-scale  investments  in  all  subsectors \nincluding roads, ports, airports, power, and urban infrastructure. For power alone, India needs \naround 10,000 MW of capacity addition every year over the next decade to sustain GDP growth \nof 9%. This would require an estimated investment of more than $600 billion over the next few \ndecades. These investments do not include investments needed to augment capacity in fuel \nsupply  infrastructure,  mining  and  supply,  and  ports  and  terminals  to  sustain  expansion  in \ngeneration capacity. Thus, meeting infrastructure requirements in one subsector may not be \nsufficient as subsectors are linked through the supply chain that ultimately delivers electricity, \nwater, transportation, and other services to end beneficiaries. These linkages suggest an overall \ninvestment  program  that  includes  power  plants,  electricity  transmission  and  distribution \nsystems, ports, roads and expressways, bridges, railway engines and tracks, product handling, \nand storage facilities.  \n \n1.  Roads \n \n6.  After the successful implementation of the Golden Quadrilateral project, the next phase \nof  roadways  expansion  is  gathering  momentum.  In  this  context,  the  National  Highway \nDevelopment  Program  is  being  executed  in  five  phases.  Phases  I,  II,  and  IIIA  envisage \nimproving more than 25,785 km of arterial routes on national highways to global standards. \nWhile problems in land acquisition have resulted in massive delays for several projects, the new \nmodel concession agreement has clauses to ensure that the National Highway Authority of India \ncompletes 60% of the land acquisition and utilities clearances and passes these on to the road \ndeveloper  before  financial  closure  of  the  project.  Phase  IV  of  the  National  Highway \nDevelopment Project includes doubling of lanes for about 1,000 km of intermediate lane and \n ", "34  Appendix 2 \nsingle-lane roads and upgrading 20,000 km of national highways with paved shoulders. Phase \nIV  is  divided  into  four  phases,  each  comprising  5,000  km,  to  be  approved  by  2009  and \ncompleted by 2015. Phase V envisages six-laning 6,500 km of four-lane national highways.  \n \n2.  Power \n \n7.  According to the Planning Commission's estimates, the electricity subsector (including \nnonconventional power) requires an investment of around $134 billion during the 11th FYP \nperiod. Of this, 27.8% is expected to come from the private sector. As of November 2008, the \n1,482 power projects entailed a total investment of $240 billion. Collectively, these projects aim \nto install more than 200,000 MW of power generation capacity. The ultra-mega power projects \ndeveloped by the private sector were expected to be financed through external commercial \nborrowings. However, the global financial crisis has severely constrained this avenue of funding. \nThis, coupled with known hurdles like delays in land acquisition, awarding of contracts, and \nsupply of equipment, means the country may have difficulty meeting the capacity addition target \nof 78,000 MW during the 11th FYP period. While planned capacity addition targets are largely \non track on an overall basis, during FY2007, the first year of the 11th FYP, about 60% of the \ntargeted 11,061 MW materialized. However, the Government is optimistic of achieving the FYP \ntarget.  \n \n3.  Airports  \n \n8.  Civil aviation is experiencing double-digit growth, growing at about 25%\u201330%\u23afthis rate \nis expected for the next 5 years. Investments in aviation are expected to be $30 billion by 2012 \nand about $50 billion by 2015.2 The airport subsector is struggling with a strange dichotomy \nwhere ground infrastructure is not fully prepared to handle increased traffic\u2014number of aircrafts \nhas grown exponentially. India\u2019s major airports are overloaded. Estimates suggest that during \npeak passenger traffic hours, New Delhi and Mumbai international airports operate at about \n20%\u201325% overcapacity. \n \n9.  Rapid expansion of airport infrastructure is essential due to unprecedented growth. \nInternational air traffic has been growing at 15% annually, while domestic passenger traffic \ngrowth has at times surpassed 40%. The domestic market size is expected to reach 60 million \nand international traffic 20 million at the end of 2010. India expects to add aircraft worth about \n$80  billion  by  2020.  This  would  necessitate  an  investment  of  about  $30  billion  in  airport \ninfrastructure. Given the difficulty in generating resources from either the public sector or PPP, \nthe Government is exploring the option of merchant airports. \n \n4.  Railways \n \n10.  Indian Railways has a registered growth rate of 14% in passenger earnings and 17% in \nfreight earnings, and reported a surplus of almost $4 billion during the last few years. However, \nrailway modernization and infrastructure projects require around $12 billion\u23afadditional funds \nare needed to complete existing and new projects in a time-bound manner. Indian Railways has \nidentified 22 stations to be modernized under PPP including setting up of shopping and food \nplazas,  budget  hotels,  and  retiring  rooms.  This  includes  setting  up  spatial  segregation  of \nfacilities on different floors for smooth passenger flow. While newly designed railway stations \n                                                 \n2  Aviation  investment  includes  airport  infrastructure (runways  and  air  traffic  controls),  aircraft,  noncommercial \nairports, aircraft components, feeder services, and air catering.     \n ", "Appendix 2  35\nwill  present  the  customer-friendly  face  of  Indian  Railways,  its  freight  stations  with  new \nintermodal facilities will be its main sources of revenue in the years to come. The Ministry of \nRailways has selected 16 such terminals to be provided with amenities for better communication \nfacilities  with  control  offices  and  road  connectivity.  Modernized  terminals  will  help  reduce \nturnaround  time  and  facilitate  quicker  material  handling  at  terminals.  Indian  Railways  has \nestablished Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India Ltd. to implement the freight corridor \nproject over the next 5 years.3 The corporation currently has authorized capital of $800 million, \nwhich is likely to be increased depending on requirements. \n \n5.  Ports \n \n11.  Ports handle almost 95% of the export\u2013import trade\u23afport capacity is a constraint in \nsustaining 9% GDP growth. The Government plans to double the total capacity of major and \nnonmajor ports in the country to 1,500 million tons per annum from the current capacity of  \n750 million tons per annum by FY2011 and create surplus port capacity of around 30% by \nFY2011. While the bulk of funding for increased cargo-handling capacity would be obtained \nfrom the private sector and the ports themselves through internal resource generation and \nborrowings, the Government will contribute about $600 million to dredging major ports to enable \nthem to cater to large ships. Jawaharlal Nehru Port in Mumbai has developed projects costing \nmore than $200 million, Mumbai Port Trust has drawn up plans for new berths and terminals \nrequiring $500 million, Kandla Port is expecting an investment of $300 million, and Tuticorin Port \nhas berth development projects costing more than $200 million. In response, the Ministry of \nShipping and Transport proposes to set up five megaports with total capacity of 500 million tons.   \n \n6.  Urban Infrastructure \n \n12.  Adequate and equitable distribution of urban infrastructure services, such as water and \nsewage disposal and per capita provision of these basic services, is not in accordance with the \nprescribed norms.4 According to the Ministry of Urban Development data, only about 77 of the \n393 class I cities have water supply coverage. Per capita water supply is as low as 9 liters per \ncapita per day in some areas. Also, 203 of the 401 class II towns have supply of less than 100 \nliters per capita per day. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission envisages \nassistance of around $12.74 billion over the next 7 years to improve infrastructure in 63 cities \nacross the country, with total investments of about $26.28 billion.  \n \n13.  While five cities including Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, and Mumbai \nhave opted for mass rapid transit systems, an estimated 26 or more cities in the country require \nthese systems. The Government has been formulating measures to bring in an element of \nuniformity in the execution of these projects and is planning to bring all metrorail systems across \nthe  country  under  the  purview  of  a  single  central  authority.  To  bring  consistency  and \ntransparency  in  the  execution  of  urban  transport  projects,  the  Government  is  planning  to \nintroduce a model concession agreement for metrorail projects across the country. Further, the \nGovernment has approved the operation of a bus rapid transit system, via PPP, in the cities of \nAhmedabad, Indore, Nagpur, and Pune in an effort to improve urban transportation. \n                                                 \n3  The existing trunk routes of Howrah-Delhi on the eastern corridor and Mumbai-Delhi on the western corridor are \nhighly saturated with line capacity utilization varying between 115% and 150%. The surging power needs requiring \nheavy coal movement, booming infrastructure construction, and growing international trade led to the conception of \ndedicated freight corridors along the eastern and western routes. \n4  The Planning Commission prescribes norms such as for per capita water availability, sewerage coverage and \ntreatment, waste disposal, and sanitation.  \n ", "36  Appendix 2 \nC.  Conclusion \n \n14.  The  infrastructure  sector  in  India  faces  multiple  constraints,  and  the  policy  and \ninstitutional  response  is  appropriately  designed.  With  regard  to  financing,  initiatives  are \nunderway  to  strengthen  the  capital  market  to  channel  long-term  funds  to  the  sector. \nSimultaneously, institutional mechanisms will provide the market with the necessary risk capital \nto attract long-term debt and equity. Initiatives are also underway to establish appropriate \nregulatory mechanisms in various subsectors. While these initiatives are ongoing, they have not \nyet been fully completed. Various subsectors still require regulatory commissions, regulatory \nrulings, and redressal mechanisms. These mechanisms need to be strengthened to provide \nstability to long-term cash flows and reduce the need for risk capital and/or allow the market-\nbased provision of the same. The scale of financing required is beyond the financial capabilities \nof the public sector alone. Widespread reforms are thus underway to ensure sustained and \nviable private sector operations in infrastructure development.  \n \nTable A2.2: Overview of Private Sector Participation and \nPublic\u2013Private Partnership Policy Initiatives in the Infrastructure Sector \n \nSector  Key Reform Initiatives  Forward Reform Agenda \nRoads and  MCA for PPPs in national highways mandated  Reduce resource constraints in terms \nHighways    of finances, technical human \nTo attract private investment in road development,  resources, project management, and \nmaintenance, and operation, the National Highways  institutional strengthening in sector \nAct 1956 amended in June 1995 enabling (i) private  institutions.  \ninvestment in national highway projects by allowing   \nprivate investors to levy, collect, and retain user  Establish a policy framework for PSP in \nfees;

New Delhi. India Infrastructure Report 2008. \n ", "38  Appendix 3 \nMARKET ANALYSIS OF THE ROLE OF  \nINDIA INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE COMPANY LIMITED \n \n1.  India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited (IIFCL) was incorporated as a special \npurpose vehicle on 5 January 2006 under the Companies Act 1956 as a 100% government-\nowned company. IIFCL is a dedicated financial institution assuming a development and catalytic \nrole in the financing of infrastructure in India with the primary objective of providing long-term \nfinancing. The authorized a capital of IIFCL is about $400 million of which the current paid-up \ncapital is around $263 million. Given its incorporation under the Companies Act, it is not subject \nto Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulations and guidelines with respect to capital adequacy \nnorms despite being a financial intermediary. The Scheme for Financing Viable Infrastructure \nProjects  through  the  India  Infrastructure  Finance  Company  Limited  (the  Scheme) \n(Supplementary Appendix B) articulates the mechanism through which IIFCL will play a catalytic \nrole in the infrastructure finance market in India.  \n \nA.  Operating Paradigm \n \n2.  The  Scheme  governs  IIFCL\u2019s  operations  and  enables  it  to  play  a  key  role  in \ninfrastructure finance in India. Its role is not only to catalyze investments from the private sector \nfor infrastructure projects with an emphasis on public\u2013private partnership (PPP), but also to \ndraw-in investable long-term resources from the market. The key elements of the Scheme are \ndesigned to catalyze complementary financing on the debt and equity side, reduce market risk, \ndraw-in latent long-term resources, and leverage project development and management skills \navailable in complementary institutions in the market. \n  \n3.  In this context, IIFCL does not function in isolation but is central to the coordinated PPP \nstrategy of the Government. The key pillars of this strategy are \n \n(i)  PPP cell in the Department of Economic Affairs in the Ministry of Finance for \ncoordinating the mainstreaming of PPPs nationwide;  \n(ii)  PPP  cells  in  selected  state  and  central  line  ministries  for  identifying  PPP \nopportunities, developing projects, and bringing them to the market for financial \nclosure;  \n(iii)  Transaction advisors and standardized bidding and contractual documents such \nas master concession agreements;   \n(iv)  India  Infrastructure  Project  Development  Fund  for  financing  PPP  project \npreparation activities such as conduct of feasibility studies;  \n(v)  IIFCL, the executing agency for the proposed Second India Infrastructure Project \nFinancing Facility, for providing long-term funds for infrastructure development; \nand   \n(vi)  Viability  gap  fund  with  a  current  annual  allocation  of  about  $309  million  for \nencouraging PPPs.1  \n \n4.  In  addition  to  providing  direct  debt  financing,  IIFCL  has  (i)  participated  in  India \nInfrastructure Finance Initiative, a private equity fund with a subscribed capital of $875 million; \n                                                 \n1  The viability gap fund can provide catalytic grant assistance of up to 20% of the capital costs through which it \nexpects several projects to become bankable, attract private capital, and mobilize private sector efficiencies. This \nsupport is especially important for regions and sectors where the private sector is not readily forthcoming. The \namount indicated is the allocation in the FY2010 budget.    \n ", "Appendix 3  39\n(ii) established the India Infrastructure Finance Company (United Kingdom) Ltd. as a wholly \nowned  subsidiary  to  borrow  from  RBI  and  onlend  the  resources  to  Indian  infrastructure \ncompanies for meeting capital expenditure outside India; (iii) undertaken refinancing to reduce \nthe asset and liability mismatch of banks and enable banks to continue financing viable projects \nand thus sustain investor interest in PPP projects; and (iv) provided subordinated debt to \naugment risk capital in the market. Taken as a whole, these initiatives, in conjunction with the \nmechanisms of the Scheme, capital market and financial sector reforms, additional measures to \nfacilitate PPP, and sector reforms (Appendix 2) are designed to work in concert and facilitate \ncommercial financing for infrastructure and catalyze private sector interest.     \n \nB.  Historical Context  \n \n5.  IIFCL\u2019s role is rooted in India\u2019s experiences with development finance institutions (DFIs). \nDFIs were originally set up to provide cheap long-term funding to industries. In the absence of a \nwell-developed market for long-term capital, DFIs were the vehicles through which corporations \nmet project financing needs. The Government provided long-term funding at concessional terms \nto DFIs and directed onlending of funds by them. This was the primary reason for inefficient \nprice discovery and suboptimal capital allocation. As part of financial reforms starting mid-\n1990s2, access to subsidized funding to DFIs from the Government was gradually restricted. As \na result, DFIs had to float bonds to meet funding requirements. Since the maturity of available \nfunding  became  shorter,  while  infrastructure  financing  needs  remained  long-term,  maturity \nmismatches developed. Locking up funds in projects adversely affected DFIs\u2019 cash flows in the \nabsence of an efficient secondary market for corporate debt that would have provided exit \nopportunities. At the same time, liberalization allowed blue chip corporations to raise money \ninternationally, enabling them to source cheaper funds.  \n \n6.  In response, DFIs moved into the territory of commercial banks.3 In April 2001, RBI \nannounced that DFIs could become commercial banks if they met prudential and regulatory \nrequirements. The Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India was the first to submit a \nroad map for this purpose in late 2000 and subsequently merged with Industrial Credit and \nInvestment Corporation of India Bank Ltd. and became a commercial bank. In FY2002, the \nGovernment  approved  the  conversion  of  Industrial  Development  Bank  of  India  into  a \ncommercial bank. In FY2005, its restructuring was preceded by the repeal of the Industrial \nDevelopment Bank of India Act 1964, which provided the foundation for its transition to a \ncommercial bank.  \n  \n                                                 \n2  Starting in 1948 and throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the Government of India (the Government) established three \nDFIs to provide long-term finance: Industrial Finance Corporation of India (1948), Industrial Credit and Investment \nCorporation of India (1955), and Industrial Development Bank of India (1964). RBI and the Government nurtured \nthe DFIs through financial incentives and other policy measures, such as the provision of low-cost funds and \nguarantees by the Government for bond issuances. RBI allocated a substantial part of its national industrial credit \n(long-term operations) funds to Industrial Development Bank of India.  \n3  On 8 December 1997, RBI constituted a working group chaired by S.H. Khan to bring about greater clarity in the \nrespective roles of banks and other financial institutions for greater harmonization of facilities and obligations. The \nreport of the committee on banking reforms (the Narasimham committee) had a major bearing on the issues \nconsidered by the Khan working group. The Narsimham committee suggested that DFIs should convert ultimately \ninto either commercial banks or nonbank finance companies. The Khan working group also held the view that DFIs \nshould  be  allowed  to  become  banks  at  the  earliest  opportunity.  The  feedback  on  the  working  group \nrecommendations indicates that universal banking is desirable from the point of view of efficient use of resources. \n \n ", "40  Appendix 3 \n7.  With the conversion of DFIs into commercial banks (without a core infrastructure focus) \nand the limited ability of debt markets to provide long-term debt, financing sources for long-term \ndebt  have  dried  up.  Banks  largely  depend  on  short-term  deposits  for  funding  and  do  not \nundertake long-term market borrowings.4 Loan officers of banks are typically not trained to \nassess  the  long-term  stability  of  cash  flows  from  a  project  finance  perspective.  Further, \ninstitutions  such  as  Infrastructure  Leasing  and  Financial  Services  and  Infrastructure \nDevelopment Finance Company that have the ability and expertise to finance large subprojects \nare unable to do so due to capital constraints. \n \n8.  While the demise of DFIs should have encouraged corporates to go to the market for \nresources, leading to a vibrant corporate debt market, the corporate debt market remains weak, \nilliquid, and does not offer long-term financing instruments. Several initiatives are ongoing to \ndevelop the long-term corporate debt market. The Government appointed the Patil committee5 \nto recommend measures to develop the corporate debt market. Key recommendations include \n(i) develop a credit enhancement mechanism for bonds issued by state-owned corporations or \nother special purpose vehicles for financing infrastructure, (ii) apply an affordable stamp duty on \ndebt assignments, and (iii) allow repossession of corporate bonds.6 In addition, the Securities \nand Exchange Board of India is providing the regulatory framework for the secondary corporate \ndebt market. RBI has also drafted guidelines on the use of credit derivatives (specifically credit \ndefault swaps).7 \n \n9.  Illiquid secondary markets put banks at risk by constraining their ability to hive-off risk \nand have adverse implications for infrastructure financing: \n \n(i)  Insufficient market maturity and absence of benchmarks. A weak secondary \nmarket leads to illiquid interest rate derivatives and hedging mechanisms. In \nresponse  to  these  constraints,  banks  generally  charge  floating  rates  that \neffectively make loans short in duration. \n(ii)  Lack of investor interest. Given investor comfort with protected investments, \ninvestors are unwilling to accept a risk of decline in the value of assets in the \nabsence of liquid secondary markets. On the other hand, institutional investors, \nsuch as insurance and pension funds, have investment criteria for credit ratings \n(minimum AA) constraining them to invest in government securities.8 \n \n10.  Further, during FY1996\u2013FY2006, the bulk of corporate issuances belonged to the public \nsector (81%) through private placements (on the back of a government guarantee). Regulations \nthat allow market accessibility only to top-rated companies are a major reason for low private \nsector mobilization. Of the total issuance of $14.11 billion in FY2004, $13.70 billion was credit-\nrated, suggesting that credit rating is necessary for market access.9  \n                                                 \n4  Long-term issuances of government securities are usually absorbed by pension and insurance funds and held until \nmaturity.  \n5  High Level Committee on Corporate Bonds and Securitization 2005.  \n6  This measure is to give investors who have illiquid corporate bonds an opportunity to recycle them. \n7  Source: RBI, DBOD. NO.BP.1409.157/2006-07, 16 May 2007. \n8  At present, except for raising funds for infrastructure projects, banks are not allowed to issue bonds with long \nmaturities. Thus, there are not enough issuers of bonds. Restrictions have also been imposed on the investment \nactivity of life insurance companies and mutual funds\u23afthese restrictions are one of the reasons for the lack of \ngrowth in bond investment.  \n9  Investors in corporate debt instruments are excessively safety conscious, as can be noted from the fact that  \ndemand for paper rated below AA or its equivalent is almost negligible. Debt instruments with credit rating of BBB \n(or its equivalent) and above are considered investment grade.  \n ", "Appendix 3  41\n11.  Despite reforms and measures to improve the regulatory environment and develop long-\nterm debt markets, policy, institutional, and market gaps remain as financial and infrastructure \nsector reforms are ongoing. The existence of several interlocking factors (regulatory and policy \ngaps,  the  conversion  of  DFIs,  illiquid  capital  markets,  higher  risk  profile  of  infrastructure \nsubprojects, inadequate risk capital,10 and suboptimal risk allocation) requires an innovative \nresponse to address market gaps. The establishment of IIFCL and the elements of its operating \nparadigm (the Scheme) are a reflection of the Government\u2019s response to these interlocking \nfactors and a part of the ongoing reform agenda for the financial and infrastructure sectors.   \n \nC.  Market Justification for IIFCL\u2019s Operating Model \n \n12.  The key elements of IIFCL\u2019s Scheme have a specific role in promoting an enabling \nenvironment for PPP and infrastructure development, and filling the gaps.  \n \n13.  Guarantee Arrangement. The individual investor in India is very risk averse and, even \nat very large negative real returns, prefers risk-free investments to risky ones. The same is the \ncase for pension and insurance funds. Thus, intermediaries and markets are needed to perform \nthe three functions of risk, maturity, and duration transformation; and attract funds from the \nabove-mentioned  sources  by  providing  an  additional  layer  of  credit  enhancement.  In  this \ncontext, government guarantees, as provided to IIFCL, can be a viable mechanism for providing \nthe required risk capital in an environment where the Government is seeking to remain within its \nfiscal  limits.11 Typically,  such  credit  enhancements  should  come  from  the  market,  through \nspecialized guarantee mechanisms or credit derivatives. However, this is not possible in the \ncurrent Indian context as the markets are not fully developed and the reform process is ongoing.  \n  \n14.  The requirement for the guarantee comes from the state of available risk mitigation \nmechanisms. Credit derivatives have not become fully established in India, while banks are not \npermitted to trade in equity and commodity derivatives.12 Further, the market for interest rate \nderivatives is limited given the strict restrictions on the participation of banks in exchange-traded \nderivatives. While over-the-counter derivatives may be traded by banks, public sector banks are \nlargely  absent  from  the  market.  Insurance  companies  (the  other  natural  counterparties  to \ninfrastructure  providers)  have  not  received  permission  from  the  Insurance  Regulatory  and  \n                                                 \n10 The risk capital required in the infrastructure sector can be explained as the explicit capital brought in as equity by \nthe project sponsors and the implicit risk capital provided by the lenders to projects. Implicit risk capital is therefore \nthe credit enhancement provided to retail and long-term investors to draw in funds for infrastructure. Implicit capital \nproviders  seek  to  manage  their  risk-return  reward  by  ensuring  availability  of  adequate  explicit  capital  and \ndiversification across various projects. Given this profile of explicit capital, greater flow of risk capital can be \nensured by removing the effects of controllable uncertainties in the policy environment and making available the \nbenefits of diversification through alternate mechanisms. New sources of this risk capital can be sourced by  \n(i) providing risk guarantees (through IIFCL\u2019s Scheme), (ii) forming highly capitalized financial intermediaries \n(unlikely in a fiscally constrained regime), and (iii) encouraging securitization transactions.  \n11  In the United States, monocline insurance companies like MBIA Inc. provide such credit enhancements for urban \nlocal bodies and other borrowers. MBIA is a US-based financial guarantee insurance company, rated AAA by \nStandard & Poor\u2019s. It has been providing AAA credit enhancement for municipal and structured debt obligations \nsince 1974, and guaranteed more than 35,000 municipal and asset-backed transactions with a total value \nexceeding $1.5 trillion. \n12  As a consequence, banks that have lent against the security of shares have been unable to hedge their exposure \nin falling markets and have lost money. Further, insurance companies, which largely have very long duration and \nfixed-income liabilities, have lost value almost every month as interest rates have fallen and they have been unable \nto hedge their exposure. Finally, banks and DFIs that have lent to companies engaged in commodity businesses, \nsuch as cement, paper, and steel, have been unable to lay off the underlying commodity exposures in the \ninternational market and have lost value as commodity cycles have turned against them. Studies suggest that \ninterest rate risk exposure inherent in the balance sheet of most banks is very high. \n ", "42  Appendix 3 \nDevelopment Authority13 to enter the market in the absence of credit enhancing instruments. \n \n15.  Thinly capitalized entities, from a risk-weighted perspective, that focus on infrastructure \nfinance are unlikely to maintain viability if they finance subprojects without exposure limits. \nThese limits will impose financing constraint on subprojects given their long gestation periods \nand length of debt amortizations. Further, no single entity will have sufficient capital to meet all \ninfrastructure  finance  requirements.  Thus,  spreading  the  risk  among  a  large  number  of \ninvestors, for each of whom this represents only a small exposure, is the only way this risk \ncapital can be sourced. In the context of IIFCL\u2019s guarantee, this amounts to commoditizing risk \nas a public good (as it is borne by the Government). This credit enhancement mechanism stems \nfrom recommendations of the Patil committee.  \n  \n16.  Exposure Limit. By financing only 20% of the capital costs of a project, IIFCL functions \nas part of a lending consortium and will only finance commercially viable projects. The limited \nproject financing provided by IIFCL ensures that it builds a diversified portfolio and does not \nsuffer from a lumpy investment profile that previously caused distress to DFIs. In this respect, \nIIFCL  will  benefit  from  the  PPP  development  initiatives  currently  underway.  Thus,  IIFCL \nfunctions under a different paradigm from earlier DFIs and does not undertake subproject \norigination and/or have directed lending requirements. \n \n17.  Efficient Capital Allocation. The presence of IIFCL results in efficient capital allocation \nin financial institutions engaged in infrastructure finance. With IIFCL providing an independent \nsource of funding, financial institutions may take exposures for projects in line with their risk \nreturn  capital  allocation  framework.  While  the  combined  exposures  of  financiers  may  be \ninsufficient to meet project needs, an additional independent source of funding through IIFCL \nwould likely fill the financing gap. The optimal capital allocation and risk-based return on capital \npromoted  through  this  framework  will  provide  additional  benchmarks  for  the  pricing  of \ninfrastructure risk in the market.     \n \n18.  Long-Term Financing. IIFCL will offer long-term financing for tenors not currently being \noffered by the market. This is expected to improve the bidding mechanism and quality of bids. \nAs project sponsors will have better cash flow projections, the bidding process will be facilitated \nand will not normally include anomalies on notional hedging costs to account for repricing \nuncertainties. Long tenor financing with maturity of more than 20 years will enable IIFCL to take \nan exposure to projects in line with the length of the concession agreements. Thus, potential \ninvestors in special purpose vehicles of subprojects and/or concessionaires will be provided with \nan additional layer of comfort given debt exposure to a subproject that matches the length of \nequity exposure. Thus, IIFCL will also catalyze explicit risk capital (private equity share in \nspecial purpose vehicles of subprojects) in addition to its other market enhancing roles. IIFCL \nwill onlend to subprojects based on market borrowing. Thus, unlike the older DFIs, IIFCL does \nnot have subsidized financing sources.      \n \n                                                 \n13  As per the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority regulations, life insurance and general insurance \ncompanies are required to invest minimum amounts (20% for general insurance and 25% for life insurance) in \ndifferent combinations of state and central government securities (without any quota for state governments). \nFurther, while there are stipulations for investments in infrastructure and social sectors (15% for life insurance and \n10% for general insurance sectors), the stipulation of a minimum rating of AA for such investments makes \navailability of such funds very limited. If such stipulation cannot be removed, the case for a first loss deficiency \nguarantee-backed investment becomes compelling. \n ", "Appendix 3  43\n19.  Market Benchmarks. Currently, the Indian market does not fully support risk-based \npricing of loans. In this context, IIFCL is establishing procedures and systems to price loans on \na risk basis. This will form the basis through which long-term debt can be structured for project \nfinance by sourcing financing from insurance and pension funds. The critical element of this \nmechanism is the pricing of IIFCL's loans on a risk-adjusted return on capital principle.14 Recent \nequity infusions by the Government have resulted in IIFCL having a comfortable enough capital \nbase to price loans based on a risk-return basis.15 This pricing mechanism holds the potential to \ncreate a risk-based benchmark for infrastructure debt. Risk-based pricing benchmarks provide \nan opportunity for allocating exposure based on a capital asset pricing model. This serves as a \nguide  for  policy  makers  to  develop  policy  reform  to  improve  the  risk-return  profile  of \ninfrastructure projects and expand financing to the sector.            \n \n20.  Subordinated Debt. Amendments of IIFCL's Scheme enable it to provide long-term \nsubordinated debt at tenors beyond the longest tenors offered by the lead bank and be priced \naccordingly. The subordinated debt represents a quasi explicit risk capital, which is scarce in the \nIndian market. The subordinated debt offering dovetails risk-based pricing, benchmarking, and \nimplicit risk capital (through the guarantee). This combination of products, in conjunction with \nthe Scheme, provides the basis for a new financing model for the delivery of financing products \nneeded to effect (i) risk transfer, (ii) mezzanine financing, (iii) capital allocation, (iv) credit \nenhancement, (v) private equity, and (vi) transaction advisory.  \n \n21.  Public\u2013Private  Partnership. IIFCL will seek to leverage resources available in the \nmarket to improve the viability of projects by reducing financing risk. In this context, IIFCL has \ndeveloped partnerships with project developers such as Infrastructure Development Finance \nCompany  and  Infrastructure  Leasing  and  Financial  Services,  as  well  as  with  concession-\nawarding agencies such as National Highway Authority of India. The role played by IIFCL in \nPPP development is provided in Figure A3.1.  \n \n22.  IIFCL takes a complementary role in the infrastructure finance market. It addresses \nmarket gaps for encouraging PPP by (i) providing draw-in equity funds; (ii) providing long-term \ndebt; (iii) partnering with complementary project development agencies; and (iv) promoting \ncapital efficiency in the consortium institutions. Thus, IIFCL\u2019s presence in the market allows the \nfinancing of projects that would otherwise have been denied financing. The role played by IIFCL \nis  also  demonstrated  in  the  manner  PPP-type  subprojects  are  brought  to  the  market  and \noperationalized (Figure A3.2). \n                                                 \n14  As it became clearer that banks needed to add an appropriate capital charge in the pricing process, the concept of \nrisk adjusting the return or risk adjusting the capital arose. The value-producing capacity of an asset (or a \nbusiness) is expressed as a ratio that allows comparisons to be made between assets (or businesses) of varying \nsizes and risk characteristics. The ratio is based either on the size of the asset or the size of the capital allocated to \nit. When an institution can observe asset prices directly (and/or infer risk from observable asset prices), then it can \ndetermine how much capital to hold based on the volatility of the asset. Risk-adjusted return on capital principle \nallocates a capital charge to a transaction or a line of business at an amount equal to the maximum expected loss \n(at a 99% confidence level) over a year on an after-tax basis. As may be expected, the higher the volatility of the \nreturns, the more capital is allocated. The higher capital allocation means that the transaction has to generate cash \nflows large enough to offset the volatility of returns, which results from the credit risk, market risk, and other risks \ntaken.  \n15  The principle that potential return rises with an increase in risk. Low levels of uncertainty (low risk) are associated \nwith low potential returns, whereas high levels of uncertainty (high risk) are associated with high potential \nreturns. According to the risk-return tradeoff, invested money can render higher profits only if it is subject to the \npossibility of being lost.  Because of the risk-return tradeoff, investors are aware of risk tolerance when choosing \ninvestments. Taking on some risk is the price of achieving returns. Therefore, if you want to make money, you \ncannot cut out all risks. The goal instead is to find an appropriate balance.  \n ", "44  Appendix 3 \n  \nFigure A3.1: Framework for Developing  Infrastructure through PPPand PSP \n \nNote\n \nIIFCL PPP Cells IIPDF Partnership \n \nLong-term debt Identification of  Funding for \nequity opportunities   project  Fund Flow\ndeal flow development\n  Relationship\n  Project \n  Developers\nIDFC/IL&FS\n \nSPV(s)\nEquity Funds   \nInvestment in \n \nSPV(s)\n \n \nConcession Authority Regulatory \nVGF   Award of concession Framework/\nPromoting  land acquisition and  Concession \n \ncommercial  resettlement Agreements\nviability  \n \n \nIDFC = Infrastructure Development Finance Corporation, IIFCL = India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited, IL&FS = Infrastructure \n \nLeasing and Financial Services Limited, IIPDF = India Infrastructure Project Development Facility, PPP = public\u2013private partnership, PSP \n= private sector participation, SPV = special purpose vehicle, VGF = v iability gap funding.\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.\n \n \n \n \nFigure A3.2 Process Flow of Developing and OperationalizingPPP Subprojects\n \n \n  Identification of \nOpportunity  Deal Structuring Award of Concession  Construction and Operation \n \nPhase I Phase II Phase III Phase IV\n \n \nFormation of SPV(s)  Bidding for Concession Land Acquisition and \n  Under Companies  Resettlement\nPPP Cells Act, 1956\n  IIPDF SPV(s) Project  Project \n  SPV SPV\n \n \n  Debt Equity Commercial Viability\nProject Development\n \n \n \n  Facilitators / \nPartners\n \n  IL&FS IIFCL/  Equity  VGF Concession Authority \n  IDFC Consortium Funds (e.g., NHAI)\n \n \nIDFC = Infrastructure Development Finance Company, IIFCL = IndiaInfrastructure Finance Company Limited, IIPDF = India Infrastructure \nProject Development Facility, IL&FS = Infrastructure Leasing andFinancial Services, NHAI = National Highway Authority of India,PH = \nphase, PPP = public\u2013private partnership, SPV = special purpose vehicle, VGF = viability gap funding. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.\n ", "Appendix 4  45\nCORPORATE GOVERANCE FRAMEWORK OF INDIA INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE \nCOMPANY LIMITED AND PROPOSED ENHANCEMENTS  \n \n1.  The India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited (IIFCL) is a unique entity established \nby the Government of India (the Government) under the Companies Act 1956 and is governed \nby the provisions of the act. Further, IIFCL has undertaken a series of internal initiatives to scale \nup capacity and functional norms to manage the expansion of its balance sheet in an efficient \nmanner.      \n \nA.  Companies Act 1956  \n \n2.  The Companies Act (1956, amended from time to time) is the most important piece of \nlegislation empowering the Government to regulate the formation and functioning of companies. \nThe Government administers the act through the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and the offices of \nbodies such as the Registrar of Companies,1 official liquidators, public trustee, company law \nboard, and director of inspection. \n \n3.  The Companies Act states that a company is \"a company formed and registered under \nthe Act or an existing company, i.e. a company formed or registered under any of the previous \ncompany laws.\" The basic objectives of the law are to (i) enforce a minimum standard of good \nbehavior and business honesty in company promotion and management, (ii) ensure fair and \ntrue disclosure of the company\u2019s affairs in its annual published balance sheet and profit and loss \naccounts, (iii) provide investigation into the affairs of any company managed in a manner \noppressive to a minority of the shareholders or prejudicial to the interest of the company as a \nwhole, and (iv) enforce performance of duties by those engaged in the management of public \ncompanies or their subsidiaries by providing sanctions in the case of breach and subjecting \nmanagement to restrictive provisions of the law.  \n \nB.  Corporate Governance Framework \n \n4.  The peak policy-making body of IIFCL is the empowered committee of secretaries, \nwhich is authorized to make changes to the 'Scheme for Financing Infrastructure through the \nIndia Infrastructure Finance Company Limited' (the Scheme). The committee is independent of \nIIFCL\u2019s board, with minimal duplication of membership, and includes one member (secretary) \nfrom the line ministry that will be impacted by, or has sought changes to, the Scheme (i.e., the \nempowered  committee  could  have  one  floating  member  based  on  the  subject  under \nconsideration).  This  mechanism  ensures  separation  between  policy-making  and \nimplementation, and minimizes potential conflict of interest and the possibility of structuring the \nScheme  to  favor  a  particular  subsector  or  lending  modality.  Further  to  the  empowered \ncommittee, the oversight committee was established to implement the regulatory process. The \ncomposition  of  the  oversight  committee  is  independent  and  distinct  from  the  empowered \ncommittee\u2014the two committees do not have any common members.   \n \n                                                 \n1  Registrars of companies appointed under Section 609 of the Companies Act covering the various states and union \nterritories are vested with the primary duty of registering companies floated in the respective states and the union \nterritories, and ensuring that such companies comply with statutory requirements under the act. These offices \nfunction as a registry of records relating to the companies registered with them and the records are available for \ninspection by members of the public on payment of the prescribed fee. The central government exercises \nadministrative control over these offices through the respective regional directors. \n ", "46  Appendix 4 \n5.  As per its Memorandum and Articles of Association, IIFCL will have no fewer than three \ndirectors and no more than 13, or such number as may be determined from time to time by \nIIFCL  in  its  general  meeting  in  accordance  with  the  aforesaid  limit  and  provisions  of  the \nCompanies  Act  1956.  As  per  the  Memorandum  and  Articles  of  Association,  the  board  of \ndirectors will consist of the following: \n \n(i)  two full-time directors (one of whom will be chairperson and managing director) \nwho will not be liable to retire on rotation; \n(ii)  two directors who may be nominated officials of the Government; \n(iii)  three expert part-time directors from outside the Government; and \n(iv)  directors elected by the members other than the Government, as follows: \n \n(a)  two directors, when the total amount of equity share capital issued to \nsuch shareholders is 25% or less of the total issued equity capital; \n(b)  four directors, when the total amount of equity share capital issued to \nsuch shareholders is more than 25% but less than 40% of the total equity \nshare capital; and \n(c)  six directors, when the total amount of equity share capital issued to such \nshareholders is 40% or more of the total issued equity capital. \n \n6.  Powers of Directors. As per the Memorandum and Articles of Association, the board \nwill exercise powers on behalf of the company and by means of resolutions passed in its \nmeetings: \n \n(i)  make calls on shareholders for money unpaid on their shares, \n(ii)  authorize the buy-back of shares, \n(iii)  issue debentures, \n(iv)  borrow money by means other than debentures, \n(v)  invest the funds of the company, and \n(vi)  make loans. \n \n7.  Board Procedures. The comprehensive business plan proposes the following prudent \nboard procedures: \n \n(i)  Board meetings will be held at least four times a year, with a maximum interval of \n4 months between any two meetings. \n(ii)  The information provided to the board periodically will include \n \n(a)  annual operating and resources plans; \n(b)  quarterly results; \n(c)  minutes of meetings of the audit committee and other board committees; \n(d)  information on recruitment and remuneration of senior management; \n(e)  details  of  any  collaboration  agreements  and  signed  memoranda  of \nunderstandings; and \n(f)  credit risk and portfolio analysis, market risk reports including interest rate \nsensitivity statements, and statements on foreign exchange exposure and \nhedging. \n \n8.  Disclosures.  The  comprehensive  business  plan  emphasizes  transparency  in  IIFCL \noperations through an appropriate disclosure plan as follows.  \n \n ", "Appendix 4  47\n(i)  All pecuniary relationships or transactions of the nonexecutive directors with \nIIFCL will be disclosed in the annual report. In addition, compensation of all the \ndirectors will be disclosed. \n(ii)  Management  will  disclose  to  the  board  relating  to  all  material  financial  and \ncommercial transactions where they have personal interest that may have a \npotential conflict with the interest of the company at large. \n(iii)  Management will provide a clear description of each material contingent liability \nand its risks to be accompanied by auditors\u2019 comments. \n(iv)  IIFCL will aim to include (as part of the directors\u2019 report in the annual report or as \nan  addition  thereto)  a  management  discussion  that  includes  (a)  financial \nperformance,  (b)  risks  and  concerns,  (c)  internal  control  systems  and  their \nadequacy,  and  (d)  material  developments  in  human  resources  including  the \nnumber of people employed. \n(v)  IIFCL will present its corporate governance framework in a separate section in its \nannual report. \n \n9.  In  addition,  IIFCL  undertakes  (i)  concurrent  internal  audit  by  a  firm  of  chartered \naccountants, (ii) statutory audit by an independent firm of chartered accountants appointed by \nthe comptroller and auditor general of India, and (iii) supplementary audit by the comptroller and \nauditor general of India. \n \nC.  Internal Process Improvements  \n \n10.  Information Technology. A robust information technology system is expected to play a \npredominant role in the effective functioning of IIFCL considering the nature of operations and \ngrowth curve of the organization. The information technology plan envisages a robust and \nenterprise-wide  information  technology  platform  for  supporting  business  strategies  and  the \nmanagement control process using a long-term perspective. Information system structures will \ninclude the following systems: (i) loan origination, (ii) appraisal and administration, (iii) loan \nrecovery,  (iv)  resource  mobilization,  (v)  treasury  management,  (vi)  financial  accounting,  (vii) \npayroll and human resources, and (viii) the secretarial system for the chair and managing director. \n \n11.  Resources and Treasury. The expansion of IIFCL's balance sheet under its Scheme \nrequires it to meet short and long-term resource requirements, and enable IIFCL to cater to \nsector needs of credit in line with expansion in operations. In this context, the resources manual \nincludes  funding  policies,  preparation  of  long-term  and  annual  resource  budgets,  various \ninstruments for raising resources in rupee and foreign currencies, approvals from authorities, \ndesigning  of  instruments  and  checking  of  statutory  requirements,  detailed  procedure  for \nappointment of approved brokers, selection of brokers from an approved list, accounting of \nresources and servicing procedures, requirements of the management information system, and \nchecks and balances.  \n \n12.  Legal. As per the provisions of its Scheme, IIFCL is engaged in financing infrastructure \nprojects  but  not  as  the  lead  bank.  The  legal  documentation  for  the  terms  of  concession \nagreements is ensured by the lead lender, the lender\u2019s legal counsel and/or security trustee, \nwhich may be a bank or any other financial institution on behalf of other participants of the \nconsortium, who agree to finance the project together as a consortium. Therefore, a certain \nspecialized set of legal documents are required to be executed by all the lenders who are a part \nof a consortium for all loans sanctioned by IIFCL. The documentation for credit finance can be \nbroadly classified as (i) financing documentation, (ii) security documentation, (iii) creation of \nsecurity documentation, and (iv) other related documentation.  \n ", "48  Appendix 4 \n13.  Further,  legal  documentation  is  required  for  raising  resources  such  as  information \nmemorandum,  trustee  agreement,  terms  of  appointment  of  the  credit-rating  agency,  and \nGovernment guarantee for resource-raising, staff loans, and purchase and lease agreements for \nhuman resource requirements.  \n \n14.  In the context of establishing proper systems, the operating procedures for business \ndevelopment are conducted by the planning and business development department for IIFCL. It \nis  responsible  for  planning  and  keeping  the  organization  updated  with  market  conditions, \nfluctuations, and ever-changing economic requirements. Operating procedures are set out to be \nfollowed by the department. The procedures are documented in the planning and business \ndevelopment manual and have to be strictly implemented. \n \n15.  Credit Risk Management and Policy. IIFCL's credit risk management policy is based \non the nature and objectives of the organization as articulated in its Scheme. The objectives of \nthe policy are to (i) establish a credit strategy aligned with the goals of the organization; (ii) \ndefine  the  organization  structure  for  implementing  the  risk  framework  including  roles  and \nresponsibilities of the credit risk management department (CRMD), which is an integral part of \nthe credit department under the general manager (credit) or vice president (credit); (iii) define \ncredit and risk management processes so that credit risk can be identified, measured, and \nmanaged; (iv) set up proper pricing framework to ensure that the return is commensurate with \nthe  risk  involved;  (v)  put  in  place  an  adequate  management  information  system  for  early \nidentification  of  problem  accounts  to  initiate  remedial  action;  and  (vi)  define  information \ntechnology infrastructure supporting credit and risk functions. \n \n16.  Risk  Strategy.  The risk strategy is designed to help IIFCL focus on achieving the \nprimary  objectives  of  funding  infrastructure  projects  while  managing  associated  risks.  The \nstrategy has goals to (i) implement internal rating models to evaluate credit risk for infrastructure \nprojects, (ii) use internal ratings (obtained from the rating models) in making lending decisions, \n(iii)  install  a  framework  to  eventually  link  pricing  to  internal  ratings,  and  \n(iv) develop a road map to implement the building blocks to ensure that IIFCL can maintain risk-\nbased capital.  \n \n17.  Risk Management Committee and Credit Risk Management Department. The credit \nrisk strategy is implemented by the risk management committee (RMC) under the guidance of \nthe board, which periodically reviews the management of credit risk as per the processes and \npolicies laid down for the RMC. The board also periodically provides directives to the RMC for \nmodifying the risk policy to suit the changing environment, amends the roles and responsibility \nof the RMC based on requirements, comments on issues raised by the RMC, and provides \nfeedback on strategic direction and on any other matter deemed fit by the board in the normal \ncourse of business. \n \n18.  The CRMD implements the credit risk management policy and guidelines of the RMC. \nThe CRMD identifies, measures, and manages credit risk within the limits set by the board and \nRMC. In addition, it assists the RMC in performing its activities as envisaged by the board and \ndesigns, implements, and validates the credit risk models. Further, the CRMD reviews the \noutstanding portfolio including review and analysis of the past behaviour of assets, sanctions, \nand disbursals. Finally, the CRMD specifies activities of day-to-day management, including \nproviding comments on proposals and cases considered for financing, laying down benchmarks \nfor the different credit risk models used at IIFCL and benchmarks risk premium table (rating \ngrade-wise), while reporting any exceptions to the policy. \n \n ", "Appendix 4  49\n19.  Accounting. As IIFCL is governed by the provisions of the Companies Act 1956, all \naccounting  standards  pronounced  by  the  Institute  of  Chartered  Accountants  of  India  are \napplicable. Further, IIFCL is required to maintain all the statutory registers as mandated by \nvarious  provisions  of  the  Companies  Act.  In  this  context,  the  accounting  and  auditing \nprocedures outlined in the accounting manual compiles all routine accounting policies and \nprocedures, educates employees to facilitate day-to-day matters, and ensures standardization \nin accounting of transactions. The accounting procedures and practices outlined in the manual \nalso serve as a tool for auditors to measure performance with reference to adherence to policies \nand procedures set in the manual.  In addition, IIFCL undertakes (i) concurrent internal audit by \na  firm  of  chartered  accountants,  (ii)  statutory  audit  by  an  independent  firm  of  chartered \naccountants appointed by the comptroller and auditor general of India, and (iii) supplementary \naudit by the comptroller and auditor general of India. \n \n20.  Human  Resources.  IIFCL  adopted  a  human  resources  plan  that  presents  the \norganization\u2019s policies and procedures with regard to employed staff. The human resources \nmanual is a tool designed to acquaint managers and supervisors with the organization\u2019s policies \nand procedures, and to help them carry out their day-to-day responsibilities. It states the human \nresources policy of the company and a broad overview of the various processes, such as \nhuman  resource  planning,  recruitment,  compensation  and  benefits,  training  and  employee \nadministration. With growth, other processes may be added to keep the manual updated. \n \n21.  Management Structure. The organization of IIFCL is setup to ensure that the loan \nappraisal, resource mobilization and treasury, and loan recovery functions are separate. The \nfunctional segregation is based on minimizing conflict of interest and ensuring independence in \nloan evaluation, pricing, and risk evaluation (e.g., the risk management function has no lending \ntargets and performance is assessed on the basis of documentation and data integrity). Further, \nthe responsible officers are selected on the basis of their banking experience and are drawn \nfrom various commercial banks. Figure A4 details the IIFCL operating structure.  \n \n22.  Functional  segregation  and  independence  is  ensured  through  the  Scheme,  which \nmandates that project appraisal be undertaken by specialized agencies. Thus, there is no loan \norigination in IIFCL and it finances projects cleared by the boards of other consortium members.  \n \nD.  Proposed Credit Risk and Financial Operations Framework \n \n23.  Given envisaged growth, a new and strengthened corporate governance framework is \nproposed within IIFCL to ensure efficient business expansion.2 Under the new framework, it is \nproposed that the functions of resource mobilization and treasury be performed by separate \npersonnel within the department as the objectives of the two functions are different. It is further \nproposed that a separate corporate assurance division be created to serve a specialized credit \nrisk assessment and management function. As the organization grows, this segregation of \nactivities would develop specialization within the department. \n \n24.  Credit Department. The credit department will be responsible for lending operations \nand will be responsible for direct lending, refinancing, environmental and social safeguards \nmonitoring, and project appraisal. The key activities envisaged within the credit department \ninclude project appraisal and compliance review with pre-disbursement conditions including \nenvironmental and social safeguards and project monitoring including site visits. A key aspect of \n                                                 \n2 Proposed in the Ma Foi Manpower Assessment Study which was adopted by the IIFCL board on 14 June 2009.  \n ", "50  Appendix 4 \nproject  monitoring  is  following-up  of  interest  and  loan  installments.  In  addition,  the  credit \ndepartment would also be responsible for refinancing in line with the Government's view of \nusing IIFCL as the key refinancing agency.  \n \n \n  Figure A4: Updated Organization Structure\nof India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited\n \n \nCMD\n  Sh.

Finance  Department  (Resource  Mobilization  and  Treasury).  The  resource \nmobilization  division  is  expected  to  coordinate  with  banks,  financial  institutions,  and  other \nlending agencies like insurance companies for fund mobilization. The division is expected to \nreview  the  domestic  market  from  time  to  time  with  respect  to  exercise  the  call  option, \nderivative/swap possibilities, prepayment, rollover interest reset, etc.   \n \n26.  The treasury department is expected to deploy funds with scheduled commercial banks \nempanelled with IIFCL of other avenues as decided by the management from time to time and \nto meet funding shortfalls by availing funds based on a cost-benefit analysis. Broadly, the \ntreasury is expected to (i) empanel banks and fix exposure limits for deployment of surplus \nfunds, (ii) meet working capital requirements, (iii) prepare cash flow statements as required from \ntime to time, and (iv) coordinate with the resource mobilization division for funds requirements. It \nis further expected that the front office and back office activities be performed by separate \npersonnel to have effective controls over treasury management. \n \n27.  Corporate  Assurance. The corporate assurance department is expected to play a \nstrategic role in reviewing the risk management framework and processes ensuring that there \nare sufficient and systematic arrangements for review of risks across businesses. The corporate \nassurance division will be subdivided into divisions responsible for the credit risk management, \nresources and treasury risk management, and auditing and coordination/compliance. The key \nresponsibilities of the credit risk management division would include establishing an appropriate \n ", "Appendix 4  51\ncredit risk environment in order to identify, measure, and manage credit risk within the limits set \nby the board. Further, the credit risk management division would ensure adequate controls over \ncredit risk by designing, implementing, and periodically validate the credit risk model and lay \ndown benchmarks for the different credit risk models used by IIFCL. The resources and treasury \nrisk management division would be responsible for improving cash forecasting and positioning \nand optimizing liquidity and improving foreign exchange and interest exposure management.  \n \n28.  The auditing and accounting functions, which are presently subdepartments within the \ncredit department and resources and treasury, respectively, are recommended as independent \ndivisions  with  the  corporate  assurance  department.  The  division  would  be  responsible  for \ninternal audits, statutory audit under the Companies Act, and audit by the comptroller and \nauditor general of India. The coordination and compliance division would be responsible for \ncoordination with the department of financial services and other government agencies. The \ndivision  would  also  provide  management  information  system  with  respect  to  information \nrequired by the above departments. Finally, the division would be responsible for compliance \nwith the right to information Act.        \n \nE.  Proposed Human Resource Framework \n \n29.  IIFCL  has  decided  to  scale  up  its  human  resources  capabilities  and  framework  to \nsuccessfully implement internal initiatives with respect to the credit assessment and financial \nmanagement framework. The credit, finance, and corporate assurance departments will report \nto separate functional heads. Further, the manpower composition (footnote 2) of each of the \nfunctional streams and the scaling up required up to 2011 has been established. The required \nlevel of expertise at each level of management within the overall human resources structure has \nalso  been  established.  Further,  the  manpower  planning  and  succession  norms  are  being \nimplemented across IIFCL to mainstream the human resource framework.    \n \n ", "52  Appendix 5 \nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ASSISTANCE TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE SECTOR \n(as of 30 April 2009) \n \nNumber of  Amount \nProjects  ($ million) \nADB Assistance  ADB  India  ADB  India \nA.

A key area of concern for the development partners is to ensure that the funds are only \nrelent to those subprojects that conform to national environmental and social safeguards norms \nas well as those of the development partners. The development partners agreed that the IIFCL \nshould have common \u2018safeguards policy frameworks\u2019 for involuntary resettlement, environment, \nand indigenous peoples. In addition, capacity building to undertake the same was considered \nintegral to operationalizing this approach. In this context, ADB organized donor harmonization \nmeetings with JBIC, KfW, and the World Bank to (i) discuss developing a common donor ESSF \nwhich satisfies the Government and donor requirements, and (ii) map out issues relating to \ncapacity building in IIFCL to implement the ESSF. The ESSF,1 developed under the guidance of \nthe Regional and Sustainable Development Department, was subsequently endorsed by the \ndevelopment  partners. ADB  is  providing  support  for  in-house  capacity  building  of  IIFCL  to \nensure that subprojects financed from ADB support conform to the common ESSF. 2  \n \n3.  The World Bank3 is providing technical assistance to assist IIFCL in developing an \noperations  manual,  project  implementation  plan,  and  in  identifying  capacity  gaps.  Closely \naligned to this initiative is the ADB technical assistance (footnote 2) to procure and install \nhardware and software to assist IIFCL in evaluating credit risk of projects and price loans in line \nwith the requirements of the operations manual and efficiently manage business expansion. \nShowing an appreciation of IIFCL's forward borrowing program, ADB also assisted4 IIFCL with \nan international credit rating. This enabled IIFCL to access the international capital markets and \nthus  benefits  other  lenders  interested  in  participating  in  IIFCL's  borrowing  program.  Given \nIIFCL's desire to expand sources of financing to include all potential sources, the credit rating \nwould  also  be  necessary  in  the  event  that  IIFCL  accesses  funding  from  the  International \nFinance Corporation.  \n \n                                                 \n1 The common safeguards frameworks will cover specific information of the Second India Infrastructure Project \nFinancing Facility and ADB\u2019s safeguard policy requirements including (i) anticipated impacts of the components or \nsubprojects (likely to be financed under the multitranche financing facility on environment, involuntary resettlement, \nand indigenous peoples; (ii) safeguards criteria to be used in selecting project components or subprojects; (iii) \nrequirements and procedure to be followed to screen and categorize them, conduct impact assessments, develop \nmanagement plans, hold public consultation and disclose public information (including the 120-day disclosure rule, \nif required), and monitor and report the progress of such subprojects or project components; and (iv) the \ninstitutional  arrangements  (including  budget  and  capacity  requirements),  and  counterparty\u2019s  and  ADB\u2019s \nresponsibilities and authorities in the preparation, review, and clearance of safeguards documents. \n2 ADB. 2007.Technical Assistance to India for Capacity Development for India Infrastructure Finance Company \nLimited.

Given the strong support from donor organizations during the nascent stages of IIFCL's \noperations, ADB closely coordinated its efforts in finalizing the FMA. While the World Bank \nconducted its own FMA, ADB and the World Bank project teams shared and discussed the \nfindings of their respective FMA reports. As needed, the FMAs will be made available to other \ndevelopment partners. \n \n5.  Since ADB is the first development partner to provide lending support to IIFCL, its \nassessment  of  IIFCL  capacity  and  systems  and  procedures  is  a  valuable  input  for  the \ndevelopment partners that plan to provide funding support to IIFCL. Accordingly, ADB review \nmissions have shared implementation progress and issues. In addition, coordination is also \nmaintained in terms of subprojects to be financed. ADB and the World Bank also coordinate \ncapacity  building  to  states  for  identifying  and  conceptualizing  public\u2013private  partnership \nprojects.  \n \n6.  Since IIFCL catalyzes consortium financing, coordinated efforts on ESSF, credit rating, \nand  FMA  supports  implementation  of  IIFCL's  mandate.  The  achievement  of  common \ndevelopment and capacity building objectives is a key feature of the coordination efforts. Going \nforward, coordination efforts would include supporting IIFCL's access to international capital \nmarkets and the strengthening of IIFCL's capacity to provide a greater sophistication in market-\nbased financial and risk management products and services.  \n \n ", "  6\n0\nLIST OF SUBPROJECTS \nA\n($ million)   p\np\ne\n        Loan  Loan  Disbursement n\nd\nSl.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe investment supports poverty reduction development goals of the Government of India (the Government) and \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) for India. \n \nPoverty reduction and social development through faster and more inclusive growth is the goal of the 11th Five-\nYear-Plan (FYP) of the Government. The Planning Commission\u2019s approach papera to the 11th FYP identifies \ninfrastructure bottlenecks and lack of adequate long-term funds for infrastructure investments as key binding \nconstraints to realizing more equitable and sustainable growth and bridging the divides between regions, sectors, \nand gender. In addition, the same approach paper states that \u201cgood quality infrastructure is the most critical \nphysical requirement for attaining faster growth in a competitive world and also for ensuring investment in backward \nregions.\u201d The thrust of the 11th FYP is to scale up investment in infrastructure from 4.6% to around 9% of gross \ndomestic product (GDP) in the FYP period and to ensure (i) electricity connection to all villages and below-poverty \nline households by 2009, and round-the-clock power by the end of the 11th FYP; and (ii) all-weather road \nconnections to all habitations with populations of 1,000 or more (500 and above in hilly and tribal areas) by 2009.  \n \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy 2009\u20132012b recognizes that the adoption of ADB\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy \nin 1999 by India to support infrastructure-led poverty reduction in line with the 10th FYP priorities was valid and \ncontinues to be relevant for the 11th FYP. The assessment of the country assistance and program evaluation cites \nevidence that ADB assistance for infrastructure development had an impact on economic growth, which has in turn \nhelped to mitigate income poverty. The key lessons that emerge is that ADB needs to continue its focus on \ninfrastructure development but should try to increasingly mainstream innovative business and financing modalities \nsuch as support for public\u2013private partnership (PPP) infrastructure projects. The intervention seeks to expand the \navailability of funding sources to the India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited (IIFCL) and simultaneously \nimprove IIFCL\u2019s capacity to access market sources of finance. The availability of additional sources will significantly \nassist IIFCL in fulfilling its mandate of expanding the availability of high-quality infrastructure in India through PPPs. \nThe assistance will also result in subprojects being priced on competitive terms, thereby reducing financing risk and \nrationalizing pricing of services to the end borrowers. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nKey Issues. The poverty and social analysis identifies the socioeconomic profile of the population in the investment \nfacility areas, expected benefits and constraints, and ability of the poor and vulnerable groups to benefit from the \ninvestment facility. The analysis also identifies ways to incorporate the needs of the poor and minimize and/or \ncompensate for adverse impacts. This was done through a review of existing studies on poverty and social \nanalysis, focus group discussions and information gathering interviews with primary and secondary stakeholders, \nand an additional socioeconomic survey. To assess whether benefits are reaching the most vulnerable groups, \nattention was given to profile beneficiaries with gender-disaggregated demographic, economic, and social analysis. \nThis will be supported by analysis of the incidence of poverty, identification of vulnerable groups, ability and \nwillingness of targeted beneficiaries to pay for cost recovery, and any anticipated adverse impacts. \n \nDesign Features. The key anticipated impact on poverty will be through greater affordability of high quality \ninfrastructure. With more efficient and lower cost infrastructure, analysis would be necessary to establish if this \ntranslates into greater affordability and higher usage. This, in turn, is expected to lead to greater incidence of \ncompliance with tariffs and reduction in leakages.   \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 10  63\nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nKey  Issues.  Development  of  infrastructure  contributes  to  economic  growth,  which  in  turn  contributes  to \ninfrastructure development through increased demand for infrastructure services. Moreover, investments in human \ncapital and infrastructure interact, thus increasing the returns to each investment. Investment in infrastructure \nservices can contribute to sustainable growth by (i) reducing transaction costs and facilitating trade flows within and \nacross borders; (ii) enabling economic agents\u2014individuals, firms, and governments\u2014to respond to new types of \ndemand in different geographic areas; (iii) lowering input costs in the production of almost all goods and services; \n(iv) opening new opportunities for entrepreneurs or making existing businesses more profitable; and (v) creating \nemployment in public works. \n \nThe absence of local infrastructure is most critically felt by the poor who are acutely affected by the impact of \ninadequate infrastructure on their livelihoods. Shocks to the national economy, such as the rationing of electricity, \nare particularly evident to large numbers of people dependent on employment in small enterprises in the informal \nsector. While indirect benefits are more difficult for poor people to perceive, the development and maintenance of \nnational infrastructure is essential if India will secure potential gains from globalization. Improving local availability is \nunlikely to transform the economy and development benefits will not be fully realized unless simultaneous local and \nnational improvements are introduced and managed.   \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \na. Consultation and Participation. For subprojects funded by IIFCL, compliance requirements will necessarily \ninclude conduct of stakeholder consultations on environmental and social safeguards issues. The consultations \nwill assist the subproject developer in establishing an environmental impact assessment or the subproject \ninformation memorandum. Based on these, an environmental action plan, a resettlement plan, and a tribal \ndevelopment plan will be prepared with mitigations, wherever necessary. \n \nb. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and \nmonitoring?  \n  Information-sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision-making       Empowerment \n \nc. Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nFor subprojects funded by IIFCL, compliance requirements will include stakeholder consultations as per both \nthe environmental and social safeguards framework (ESSF) of IIFCL and ADB requirements. \nC.  Gender and Development \n \n1.  Key Issues. Women will benefit from the investment facility through improved access to various infrastructure \nservices and more affordable pricing. Women entrepreneurs have suffered due to the lack of quality infrastructure, \nsuch as regular power supply for production units, and roads for market access requiring them to walk through \ndifficult terrain. Further, regular water supply and adequate drainage improves working conditions for women \nemployees. Moreover, quality infrastructure will assist women and other vulnerable groups through better quality \nhealth care and education. Women will benefit from subprojects that conform to required environmental standards.  \n \n2.  Key Actions. Measures are included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment: \naccess to and use of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making \nprocess: \n  Gender plan          Other actions/measures         No action/measure \nIII.
