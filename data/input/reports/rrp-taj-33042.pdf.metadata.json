An  initial  environmental  examination  was  undertaken  and \nthe summary is in Appendix 4. \n \nThe  Project  will  rehabilitate  the  selected  irrigation  and  drainage  (I&D) \nfacilities  in  Sughd  and  Vahdat  districts  in  the  Region  of  Republican \nSubordination,  Farkhor  and  Pianj  districts  in  Khathlon  Oblast,  and \nRushan  district  in  Gorno  Badakhshan  Autonomous  Oblast.  Improved \nI&D  services  will  cover  an  area  of  47,500  hectares  (ha),  benefiting \n262,000  people  whose \nirrigated \nagriculture. A population of 57,000 will also gain access to safe drinking \nwater in these areas. \n \nThe  Project  will  also  provide  farm  support  services  to  increase  crop \nyields  and  improve  on-farm  land  and  water  management,  as  well  as \ncapacity  building  within  the  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and  Land \nReclamation (MWRLR) to promote participatory irrigation management \nthrough water users\u2019 associations (WUAs). \n \nIn  addition,  the  Project  will  assist  the  Government  in  accelerating  the \nimplementation  of  key  agriculture  sector  reforms  that  have  been \nrecommended  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  technical \nassistance (TA) 4052-TAJ: Farm Debt Resolution and Policy Reforms, \nparticularly  in  the  areas  of  cotton  farm  debt,  land  reform,  farm \nprivatization,  and  water  management.  The  Government  has  taken  a \nstep forward by agreeing  to  further  deepen  the  reforms  in  the  project \nareas, \nfarm  structure,  operations,  and \nmanagement based on market-oriented principles; (ii) removal of cotton \nproduction  quotas,  and  involvement  of  local  authorities  in  directing \ncotton  credit;  (iii) issuance  of  tradable  land  lease  certificates  that  can \nthen be used as collateral; and (iv) introduction of open cotton sales.  \n \nThe  agriculture  sector  plays  a  significant  role  in Tajikistan\u2019s economy, \ncontributing 22% of gross domestic product (GDP) and employing 52% \nof the total workforce. Due to the arid climate of the country, irrigation is \ncrucial  for  agricultural  production  and  85%  of  the  cultivated  area  is \nirrigated. \n \n\n(i) improved \n\nincluding \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \nObjective \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\nMost  of  the  I&D  facilities  were  built  in  the  1950s  and  1960s,  and \nTajikistan  has  not  been  able  to  maintain them adequately  due  to  the \ncivil  war  and  the  lack  of  financial  resources.  The decrepit state of the \nI&D facilities is resulting in a continuing decline in crop yield and farm \nprofitability, excessive water losses, low irrigation efficiency, and rapidly \nspreading water logging and soil salinization.  \n \nDespite the relative abundance of water resources in the country, only \nabout  15%  of  the  4.6 million  rural  population  are  currently  served  by \nsafe, piped, drinking water. Morbidity due to unsafe drinking water is an \nacknowledged contributor to poverty in rural areas.  \n \nThe Project will address these problems by providing cost-effective and \npriority-based  rehabilitation  of  key  I&D  facilities  and  easy-to-maintain \nrural  water  supply  systems  in  areas  selected  through  a  systematic \nscreening process and stakeholder consultation.  \n \nThe  rehabilitation  of  I&D  facilities  will  provide  the  security  of  water \nservices\u2014the  most  serious  concern  of  many  rural  communities \naccording to the social analysis\u2014allowing increased yield and improved \noperational efficiency of the irrigation systems over an extended useful \nlife. In the longer run, the returns of the investment could be increased \nsubstantially,  if  the  ongoing  policy  reforms  are  strengthened  and \ndeepened.  To  accelerate  the  reform  process,  the  Government  agreed \nto implement specific reform actions (see Project Description above) in \nthe  project  areas,  and  to  monitor  and  assess\u2014through  an  open  and \nparticipatory \ninvolving  development  partners,  civil  society \nmembers, and other stakeholders\u2014the impacts for future replication. \n \nThe objective of the Project is to increase farm productivity and income \nof rural communities, and improve rural potable water supply schemes. \nThe Project will also support policy reforms with regard to cost recovery \nfor operation and maintenance (O&M), cotton financing and marketing, \nfarm restructuring, and farm debt resolution.  \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $29.0 million  equivalent, \nforeign  exchange  cost  and \ncomprising  $13.3 million  (45.7%) \n$15.7 million (54.3%) in local currency cost.

The \nproject management structure will rely on the experience gained during \nimplementation of three ADB-financed projects previously executed by \nMWRLR.  A  high-level  project  steering  committee  established  during \nproject  preparation  will  continue \nfunction  during  project \nimplementation to provide policy guidance and facilitate interministerial \ncoordination  at  the  central  level.  The  minister  of  MWRLR  will  be \ndesignated  as  project  director  with  overall  responsibility  for  project \nimplementation. A project management office (PMO) will be established \nwithin MWRLR to manage project activities and to liaise with ADB and \nthe  coordinating  bodies.  Five  regional  offices  (ROs)  of  PMO  will  be \nresponsible for project implementation in their areas, and will maintain \nliaison  with \nlocal  administration,  and  beneficiary \norganizations. The PMO will be led by a full-time manager and the ROs \nby  regional  managers.  The  PMO  manager  will  be  nominated  by  the \nGovernment,  and  endorsed  by  ADB.  The  regional  managers  and  key \nstaff  will  be  selected  by  a  panel  of  experts  appointed  by  the \nGovernment and agreed to by ADB. \n \nThe  Project  will  procure  machinery,  equipment,  civil works, services, \nvehicles,  office  equipment,  and  materials.  All  procurement  will  be \nundertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n \n\nthe  PMO, \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n \nConsulting Services  The  Project  will  provide  78  person-months  of  international  and  606 \nperson-months  of  domestic  consultants  in  areas  for  which  technical \ncapacity  is  currently  unavailable  in  MWRLR,  including  (i) institutional \n(ii) design,  preparation/evaluation  of  bidding \ncapacity  building; \ndocuments,  and  construction  supervision;  (iii) agricultural  support \nservices; and (iv) project management, monitoring, and evaluation. The \ninternational  consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  will  be  used  for  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n\nProject  Benefits  and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n \n\nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\nto \n\nthem  will \n\nrehabilitated  systems \n\nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  an  irrigation  area  of  47,500  hectares \n(ha) and 262,000 people, who depend primarily on irrigated agriculture \nfor their livelihood. The annual output of cotton in the project areas will \nincrease from 38,700 tons (t) to 47,700 t, and of wheat production from \n26,800 tons to 32,400 tons. Benefits also accrue from the reduction in \npumping  costs  and  savings  of  O&M  costs  in  the  I&D  systems, \namounting to about $1.5 million per year. \n \nRehabilitation  of  rural  potable  water  supply  systems  will  improve  the \nhealth  standards  of  57,000  people,  particularly  women  and  children. \nOrganization  and  training  of  beneficiary  organizations  and  transfer  of \nmanagement  of \nfacilitate \nsustainability  of  the  benefits.  In  order  to  assist  extremely  poor \nhouseholds  in  the  near  term,  government  and  project  officials  have \nagreed  to  hire,  through  project-financed contracts,  members  of  poor \nand  vulnerable  groups  from  local  villages  for  civil  works  to  the \nmaximum extent possible. \n \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the Project is 20.7% and \nthe  economic  net  present  value  (NPV) at  the  discount  rate  of  12%  is \n$9.9 million.  Sensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  the  EIRR  is  robust, \ndespite adverse effects of price and yield declines, benefit delays, and \ninvestment  cost  increases.  The  farm  budget  analyses  for  large  and \nsmall  farms  and  household  plots  in  each  district  indicate  that  farm \nincomes at all levels will increase with the Project.  \n \nThe  Project  will  be  ADB\u2019s  third  investment  project  implemented  by \nMWRLR, which has demonstrated adequate implementation capacity in \nthe past. Thus the risk of implementation delays arising from MWRLR\u2019s \nunfamiliarity with ADB procedures is low. For the Project, MWRLR staff \nhave been closely involved in the project processing throughout project \npreparatory  technical  assistance  stage  and  thereafter,  and  their \nunderstanding and knowledge of the Project will also minimize the risk \nof  initial  implementation  delays  that  are  commonly  observed  in  ADB \nprojects. \n \nThe risk of the rehabilitated I&D  schemes not maintained adequately is \nsignificant.  Clearly,  the  Government  does  not  have  the  financial \nresources  to  ensure  sustainable  O&M  without  relying  on  recovery  of \nirrigation  service  fees  from  beneficiaries.  The  Project  addresses  this \nrisk by (i) selecting, through systematic screening and consultation with \nstakeholders,  I&D  schemes  with  low  O&M  costs;  (ii) helping  develop \nparticipatory  management  of \nthrough  WUAs;  and \n(iii) assisting MWRLR implement an improved cost recovery policy.  \n\nI&D  systems \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nvii \n \n\nThe  policy  reform  program  to  be  implemented  under  the  Project  is \nambitious,  particularly  in  addressing  the  vested  interests  of  local \nauthorities,  cotton  investors,  and  local  government-appointed  farm \nmanagers.  To  implement  the  reforms,  the  Government  needs  a  high \nlevel  of  political  commitment.  If  the  reforms  are  not  implemented \nproperly  in  a  comprehensive  manner,  rural  poverty  may  significantly \ndeepen\u2014perhaps  in  the  form  of  further  accumulation  of  cotton  farm \ndebts.  On  the  other  hand,  if  the  reforms  are  implemented  too  rapidly, \ncotton  investors  may  decide  to  stay  out  of  the  business,  thereby \neffectively taking away the livelihood of many cotton farm workers. To \naddress these risks, the Project will establish an open and participatory \nforum,  involving  farmers,  local  authorities,  development  partners,  civil \nsociety  and  cotton  investors,  to  regularly  review  and  assess  the \nprogress and impacts of reforms. \n \nThe  Project  provides  for  an  associated  technical  assistance  (TA)  for \nSupport for Monitoring Policy Reforms and Improving Farm and Water \nManagement  to  (i) monitor  and  evaluate  progress  in  implementing \npolicy reforms in the project areas; (ii) promote competitive providers of \nfarm  inputs,  technical  advice,  credit,  and  marketing  of  products  in  the \nproject  areas;  and  (iii) assist  the  Government  in  establishing  a  WUA \nsupport  unit  within  MWRLR.  The  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at \n$625,000  equivalent,  of  which  $500,000  equivalent  will  be  financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program.  \n \nThe  TA  will  provide  for  12  person-months  of  international  and  37 \nperson-months of domestic consulting services. The consultants will \nbe  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants.  Other arrangements satisfactory to ADB will \nbe  used  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented over a period of 24 months, starting in early 2006. \n \n\nTechnical \nAssistance \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\ni\n\nx\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan  for  the  Irrigation  Rehabilitation  Project  (IRP).  The  report  also \ndescribes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Support for Monitoring of Policy Reforms and \nImproving Farm and Water Management, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \n2. \nAt  the  request  of  the  Government  of  Tajikistan,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \napproved a TA1 to prepare the Irrigation Rehabilitation Project. The preparatory TA was carried \nout from January to August 2004. This report and recommendation of the President is based on \nthe  consultants\u2019  reports,  the  findings  of  ADB  missions,  and  discussions  with  government \nagencies,  potential  beneficiaries  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs).  The  Project \nframework is shown in Appendix 1. \n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe agriculture sector plays a significant role in Tajikistan\u2019s economy, contributing 22% \nof  gross  domestic  product  (GDP).  This  role  has  increased  since  independence because the \nsector  has  provided  an  important  social  safety  net  as  industry  has  contracted.  Currently,  the \nsector generates 30% of export revenues, 35% of tax revenues, and employs 52% of the total \nwork force, despite the fact that only 9% of the total land area is arable. Cereals and cotton are \nthe most important crops, accounting in 2003 for 46% and 32%, respectively, of the sown area.  \n \n4. \nDue to its arid climate, irrigation is crucial for agricultural production, and irrigated areas \nconstitute  85%  of  total  agricultural  production  areas.  Most  irrigation  and  drainage  (I&D) \nschemes were constructed in the 1950s and 1960s. Many have reached the end of their useful \nlives, and require major rehabilitation. The infrastructure has further deteriorated due to the civil \nwar, lack of capital investment, and inadequate operation and maintenance (O&M) funds. This \nis worsened by the fact that the end water users have virtually no participation in O&M.  \n \n5. \nThe  poor  condition  of  I&D  facilities  results  in  excessive  water  losses,  low  irrigation \nefficiencies, waterlogging, soil salinization, and declining crop yields. It is estimated that due to \nthe  poor  condition  of  I&D  infrastructure,  16%  of  formerly  irrigated  land  has  been  out  of \nproduction since 1991. Therefore, rehabilitation of these systems is a key intervention to boost \nagriculture  sector  productivity  and  farm  profitability.  Inadequate  irrigation  supplies,  insufficient \ninputs  and  financing,  and  lack  of  agricultural  support  services  have  led  to  a  decline  in \nagricultural productivity. Cotton production has fallen from 800,000 tons (t) in 1990 to 450,000 t \nin  2002.  Current  cotton  yields  average  1.7  t/hectare  (ha)  compared  with  2.8 t/ha  before \nindependence.  Wheat  yields  are  also  low  at  an  average  of  1.3 t/ha.  The  reduced  productivity \nresulted in declining profitability of farms and increased poverty incidence in rural areas.  \n \nFalling on-farm incomes, coupled with the lack of adequate off-farm income-generating \n6. \nopportunities, have been the major factors in the widespread income poverty in the country. The \nupdated  World  Bank  Living  Standard  Survey  (2004)  reported  that  the  country\u2019s  poverty \nincidence was 70% in 2003, the highest in Central Asia. Poverty is more prevalent in rural areas \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2003.

The  rehabilitation  of \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities  \n\nwhere  more  than  three  fourths  of  the  country\u2019s  population  resides.  Half  of  the  workforce  is \ndependent on agriculture for income, the majority of whom rely on miniscule plots of land (about \n0.1  ha  per  household)  for  their  subsistence.  Income  poverty  is  severe  in  the  countryside \nbecause of lack of income-earning and job opportunities outside the agriculture sector, and the \ndeclining productivity of the land. Inadequate irrigation water supplies and farm inputs, imperfect \nmarkets,  and  insecure  land  tenure  rights  have  contributed  to  the  poor  performance  of  the \nagriculture sector. Rural poverty is also nonincome based. A key element of nonincome poverty \nis the lack of safe drinking water, as only 40% of the country\u2019s population use piped water.  \n \nB. \n \n7. \nimproved  water \nmanagement are crucial for improving the performance of irrigated agriculture. Since 1991, the \nmajority of pumping stations and the main I&D works have not been properly funded, operated, \nor  maintained.  As  a  consequence,  there  has  been  a  rapid  deterioration  of  pumping  stations, \nincreased water losses in the main canals, and low field-level water-use efficiency.  \n \n8. \nThe role of water sector institutions is closely related to performance of the I&D systems \nand their O&M. The Ministry of Water Resources and Land Reclamation (MWRLR) plays a key \nrole in the administration of water resources. In particular, it is responsible for the construction \nand O&M of I&D infrastructure and of river regulation works. The O&M of the secondary canal \nlevel  and  the  on-farm  infrastructure  can  be  divested  as  the  main  responsibility  of  the  water \nusers\u2019 associations (WUAs). The existing associations operate on the basis of legislation in the \nWater  Code,  the  Civil  Code,  and  the  Law  on  Public  Associations.  The  ADB-funded  TA  4052-\nTAJ:  Farm  Debt  Resolution  and  Policy  Reforms  has  made  specific  recommendations \nconcerning changes to the legal framework to strengthen the water institutions.  \n \n9. \nRural Potable Water Supply. Only about 15% of the 4.6 million people, who live in rural \nareas, are currently served by drinking water. During the winter months, reduced availability of \npower supplies typically restrict water supply to 2 hours per day and many rural people pay $3\u2013\n5 per cubic meter (m3) to have water delivered by truck to their village. Morbidity due to unsafe \ndrinking water is an acknowledged contributor to poverty in rural areas. There are 669 publicly \nowned  water  supply  schemes  in  Tajikistan,  but  due  to  lack  of  funding  and  damage  sustained \nduring  the  civil  war,  most  of  these  are  in  a  state  of  disrepair.  Opportunities  to  improve  water \nsupplies are hampered by institutional barriers and existing taxation rules.  \n \nAgricultural  Support  Services. Most farms suffer from inadequate supplies of inputs, \n10. \nthe absence of extension services, and inefficient farm management. Since 1997, the situation \nhas  been  exacerbated  by  cotton  debt  built  up,  because  local  intermediary companies, called \n\u201cinvestors,\u201d2 frequently have a monopoly on the supply of inputs, which are provided late and at \ninflated  prices.  Improving  access  to  inputs  coupled  with  the  promotion  of  improved  production \ntechniques  would  increase  farm  productivity  by  helping  farmers  improve  crop  yields,  and \ndiversify cropping to achieve higher revenues (para. 36). \n \nGovernment  Agriculture  Sector  Policy.  The  Government  is  currently  implementing \n11. \nmajor  policy  initiatives  in  the  sector:  (i) farm  privatization,  (ii) increasing  competition  in  the \n\n                                                 \n2  These  are  cotton  traders/exporters  who  provide  seasonal  credit,  mostly  in  kind,  to  farmers  using  cotton  as \n\ncollateral. Generally, the local governments nominate one investor per district. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n \n\nprovision of essential agricultural support services, and (iii) price liberalization3 and privatization \nof agribusiness enterprises. In the medium-term, the Government will focus the reform agenda \non  (i) reforms  of  the  land  and  water  sectors  to  increase  privatization  and  cost  recovery; \n(ii) development of a rural finance system; and (iii) restructuring of government institutions to fit \na  market-oriented  economy.  The  main  objectives  of  the  Government\u2019s  Poverty  Reduction \nStrategy Paper4 (PRSP) include better access of the poor to land and water, and the creation of \na favorable framework for private sector involvement in agriculture. \n \nAgriculture  Sector  Reforms.  Since  independence,  the  Government  has  introduced a \n12. \nrange  of  reforms  intended  to  transform  agriculture  into  a  competitive  market-oriented sector: \n(i) the  state  procurement  system  for  agricultural  commodities  has  been  dismantled;  (ii) price \ncontrols have been reduced; (iii) ongoing land reform allows private farms to operate based on \nlife-long heritable, but not tradable leases; and (iv) irrigation service fees have been introduced, \nto partly recover O&M costs. However, the implementation of these reforms is poor, because of \nthe lack of adequate capacity and resources of the public institutions to implement the reforms \nand  provide  the  required  services  to  private  farmers,  and  because  of  the  mindset  of  the  local \nadministrations that continue to interfere with farm management and marketing of produce.  \n \n13. \nLand is the property of the state and farmers are given heritable, but not tradable, land \nuse  rights.  In  2002,  some  500  state  farms  were  transformed  into  collective  farms,  joint-stock \ncompanies, or cooperative farms.5 At present, the lack of information on legal rights, and clear \nguidelines for the land reform process, leads to exploitation of farmers by local authorities and \nvested  interests.  The  current  cotton  farm  debt  burden  (paras. 15  and  16),  and  inability  to \ntransfer  and  mortgage  land  use  rights,  restricts  the  financing  of  farm  operations  and  farm \nrestructuring. Since 2004, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has been coordinating \nthe development of a common strategy for the restructuring of state farms.  \n \n14. \nIrrigation service fees were first introduced in 1996 and collection rates have risen from \nabout  15%  in  1997  to  59%  in  2003.  Until  recently,  there  has  been  a  single  national  tariff \nequivalent  to  $2  per  1,000  m3  of  water  delivered  to  the  farm.  In  June  2004,  a  regulation  was \nissued by the Government establishing a differential rate for Sughd region, of $3.30 equivalent \nper  1,000  m3,  because  of  the  high  proportion  of  pump  irrigation.  Changing  the  structure  of \nirrigation water fees to reflect differences in system costs (e.g., the high costs of pumping water) \nwould  help  achieve  higher  efficiencies  in  water  utilization  and  agricultural  production,  more \nappropriate  cropping  patterns,  and  higher  productivity  and  return  per  unit  of  water.  The \nGovernment is also committed  under the World Bank Rural Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project \nto gradually increasing irrigation service fees to finance the full amount of O&M costs. \n \n15. \nCotton Farm Debts. Tajikistan was a major supplier of cotton fiber to the former Soviet \neconomy. After independence, Tajikistan\u2019s cotton lost both its market and source of financing. \nTherefore, the Government directed loans through the National Bank of Tajikistan to fund cotton \nproduction  of  the  state-owned  farms,  which  resulted  in  huge  annual  carryover  of  operating \ndebts.  In  1996,  this  practice  was  terminated  by  an  agreement  with  the  International  Monetary \nFund (IMF). To continue funding of cotton production, the Government, in 1997, entered into an \nagreement  to  borrow  and  guarantee  a  loan  of  $60 million  from  a  banking  consortium  led  by \n                                                 \n3  The  Government  has  fully  liberalized  the  prices  of  fruits,  vegetables,  grain,  and  livestock  inputs  and  products. \nHowever, the cotton sector continues to be affected by low raw seed cotton producer prices, mostly as a result of \nhigh levels of taxation and high transaction costs involved in the marketing, transport, and export of lint cotton. \n4  The Poverty Reduction Strategy Program (PRSP) was approved by the Parliament of the Republic of Tajikistan in \n\nJune 2002. \n\n5  Usually, the farm chairperson holds a land certificate for the farm, and individual farmers are not fully independent. \n\n. \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\nCredit  Suisse  First  Boston.  Funds  from  this  loan  were  loaned  to  cotton  farms  through  local \ninvestors.  However,  the  manner  in  which  cotton  contracts  between  the  investors  and  farm \nmanagers are implemented was often inconsistent with sound financial principles. For example, \nthe production target is not led by farm profitability, but by the production quota determined by \nthe  local  authorities.  The  choice  of  investors  is  not  with  the  farmers,  but  with  the  local \nauthorities. The inputs provided under the contract are often overpriced. Also, there are issues \ninternal to farm management: the \u201creorganized\u201d farms are run by farm managers appointed by \nlocal authorities, and many farm workers are unaware of farm reorganization at all.  \n \n16. \nThe lack of competition in cotton financing and processing, and the absence of freedom \nof choice for farmers has resulted in steady decline of cotton farm productivity and profitability, \nand  the  accumulation  of  debts  estimated  at  $180 million  as  of  January  2004.  ADB  has been \nplaying a major role in  studying the debt  issue and seeking a solution in consultation with the \nGovernment  and  other  development  partners.  In  October  2002,  ADB  sponsored  the  first \nroundtable on farm debt and subsequently  implemented  TA  4052-TAJ: Farm Debt Resolution \nand Policy Reforms, which recommended comprehensive policy initiatives and specific actions \nto  resolve  farm  debts,  including  (i) improving  farm  structure,  operations,  and  management; \n(ii) abolishing  cotton  production  quotas,  and  involvement  of  local  authorities  in  cotton  credit; \n(iii) issuing tradable land lease certificates that can be used as collateral; (iv) establishing strict \nlending rules/practices; (v) adopting international cotton grading standards; and  (vi) introducing \nopen cotton sales, simplified cotton export procedures, and reduced costs of cotton exports. \n \nExternal  Assistance  to  Agriculture  and  Water  Sectors. Most external assistance to \n17. \nTajikistan  has  been  related \ninfrastructure \nrehabilitation. ADB has financed two projects in the water sector\u2014the Emergency Restoration of \nthe  Yavan  Water  Conveyance  Project,  and  the  ARP.  ARP  supports  rehabilitation  of  I&D \nfacilities; establishment of farm machinery units, seed multiplication, and pest control programs; \nand supports the construction of rural water supply systems. Various development partners are \nassisting  Tajikistan  in  implementing  agriculture  sector  reforms.  The  World  Bank has promoted \nfarm  privatization,  land  certificate  distribution,  rural  credit  institutions,  irrigation  rehabilitation, \nand establishment of WUAs. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) \nhas supported establishment and development of WUAs. The International Finance Corporation \nmanages a program, creating an example of transparent and profitable cotton production. The \nEuropean  Union  has  provided  grants  for  development  of  small  businesses,  and  currently \nprovides support to issue land titles. FAO has established a monitoring mechanism for the land \nreform  process  and  supported  veterinary  services  in  rural  areas.  The  Department  for \nInternational  Development  assists  in  setting  up  the  legal  framework  for  cotton  debt  dispute \nresolution.  The  Swedish  International  Development  Cooperation  Agency  (SIDA)  is  providing \nassistance  to  cadastral  mapping  and  a  land  registration.  The  Government  of  Japan  has \nprovided $20 million grant for procurement of agricultural machinery and inputs. NGOs such as \nCooperative  for  Asian  and  Relief  Everywhere  (CARE),  the  Aga  Khan  Foundation,  Agence \nd'Aide \u00e0 la Coop\u00e9ration Technique et au D\u00e9veloppement (ACTED), and Oxfam are involved in \nrural development and community support. Major external assistance to the sector is shown in \nAppendix 3. \n \nADB  Country  Strategy.  ADB\u2019s  current  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP)6 identifies \n18. \nrural  development  as  a  strategic  focus  to  support  more  inclusive  growth;  improve  productivity \nand  profitability  in  the  rural  sector  through  institution  building  that  strengthens  policy \nimplementation  and  promotes  private  sector  activities;  and  improve  infrastructure  (irrigation). \n\nto  emergencies,  structural  adjustment,  and \n\n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2003. Country Strategy and Program (2004\u20132008): Tajikistan. Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5 \n \n\nThe CSP update7 recognizes ADB\u2019s role in spearheading the assistance to the Government in \nresolving the cotton farm debt issues (para. 15), noting that the cotton debt problem needs to be \naddressed through a well-designed restructuring program in phases.  The CSP also states that \nADB  will  continue  its  support  for  (i) rehabilitation  of  I&D  facilities,  (ii) improvements  in  rural \n(iii) establishment  of  community-based  organizations,  and \npotable  water  supply, \n(iv) improvements in agricultural support services and financing.  \n \n19. \nLessons  Learned.  ADB  has  financed  two  projects  in  the  water  sector.  The  first  is  the \nalready  completed  Emergency  Restoration  of  the  Yavan  Water  Conveyance  Project,  and  the \nARP, for which implementation started in 2003.  MWRLR is the Executing Agency (EA) for both \nprojects.  The  performance  of  MWRLR  in  these  projects  was  carefully  reviewed,  and  its \nstrengths (construction supervision and interaction with local authorities) as well as weaknesses \n(weak  coordination  with  other  agencies,  and  limited  planning  and  design  capacity)  have  been \nfully reflected in the proposed project implementation arrangements and in drawing the terms of \nreference  for  the  project  consultants.  The  lessons  learned  from  other  water  sector  projects, \nhave  also  been  incorporated  in  the  Project\u2019s  design.  These  include  (i) the  need  to  involve  the \nprimary stakeholders in construction, monitoring, and supervision of irrigation subprojects; and \n(ii) the need for clear targets to monitor participatory processes undertaken. To avoid common \nstart-up  delays,  the  staff  of  MWRLR  have  been  closely  involved  in  preparing  the  feasibility \nstudy, and local authorities have been consulted frequently during project design, so that they \nmay acquire full understanding of the project design and the implementation arrangements. \n \n20. \nThe  Project\u2019s  reform  agenda  is  designed  on  the  experience  and  lessons  learned  from \nother Central Asian countries, particularly  Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan. While \nthe  progress  of  reforms  in  these  countries  varies,  monitoring  the  impacts  of  the  reforms, \nparticularly in terms of rural poverty, has been often neglected. Applying the reform agenda on a \npilot basis, by limiting it in the project-specific context, has a better chance of acceptance, and \nof scaling up. The experience in the Kyrgyz Republic also shows the need for investment and \npolicy support for the restructured farms, and completion of land reform and farm privatization \nas the priority reform issues. These lessons have been suitably incorporated in prioritizing and \ndesigning the implementation arrangements for the specific reform agenda under the Project.  \n \nFurther,  from  its  various  projects  in  the  region,  the  World  Bank 8 has concluded that \n21. \n(i) proper sequencing is important for successful reform; (ii) the reform agenda must proceed at \na pace at which it receives the support of elected representatives and civil society; (iii) delaying \ninvestments until the policies are right can reduce the ability to help the poor and can increase \nthe cost of investments; (iv) modest investments combined with focused policy reforms are most \nlikely to be successful; and (v) project design should be simple and, geographically focused.  \n \n22. \nProject Rationale. Most of Tajikistan\u2019s I&D facilities have long reached the end of their \nuseful life. Major facilities were destroyed during the civil war and the remaining facilities have \nfurther  deteriorated  due  to  neglected  O&M  in  the  postwar  period.  The  worsening  condition  of \nI&D  infrastructure  results  in  declining  crop  yields  and  farm  profitability,  as  well  as  excessive \nwater losses, low irrigation efficiency, and rapidly spreading land degradation\u2014including water \nlogging  and  soil  salinization.  If  I&D  facilities  are  allowed  to  further  deteriorate,  the  country\u2019s \nirrigated area is estimated to be reduced by 20% within 10 years, resulting in a huge disruption \nin  the  primary  livelihood  of  a  large  and  poor  farming  population.  In  addition,  morbidity  due  to \nunsafe drinking water is an acknowledged contributor to poverty in rural areas. The Government \n\n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2004.

Washington, DC. \n\n. \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\nplaces high priority on restoring and improving the key water sector infrastructure facilities\u2014I&D \nand rural water supply\u2014toward achieving its goal of reducing rural poverty. \n \n23. \nThe nine districts proposed by the Government for inclusion in the Project were ranked \nthrough  a  systematic  screening  and  stakeholder  consultation  process.  The  selection criteria \nincluded the need for irrigation infrastructure rehabilitation and low O&M costs; social, financial, \nand  economic  indicators;  high  potential  to  increase  agricultural  production;  and  environmental \nimpacts. Subsequently, irrigation schemes in five districts, covering 47,500 ha, were selected. \n \n24. \nThe Project will support low-income farmers by improving livelihood and income through \nthe provision of improved irrigation and potable water supplies, and the promotion of sustainable \nand  profitable agricultural practices.  Improvement  in  productivity  and  income  that  the  Project \nintends  to  deliver  will  bring  substantial  impacts  on  reducing  poverty  in  the  project  areas.  The \nreturns of investment, however, could still be improved further, if the persisting policy constraints \nthat  significantly  affect  farm  productivity  and  profitability,  are  addressed.  These  constraints \ninclude  slow  and  uneven  progress  in  farm  privatization;  continuing  strong  public  authorities\u2019 \ninterventions  in  farm  management  and  in  access  to  credit  and  inputs;  monopoly  in  cotton \nfinancing  and  marketing;  and  inadequate  O&M  of  I&D  facilities.  The  Project  will  assist  the \nGovernment  address  these  policy  constraints  by  implementing  specific  reforms  within  the \nproject areas, and by monitoring and assessing the impacts for future replication.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nObjectives \n\n \nA. \n \n25. \nThe Project\u2019s goal is to improve the living standards of the rural population in the project \nareas. The purposes of the Project are to increase productivity and income of rural communities \nin the project areas, and to improve the access of the rural population to potable water supply. \nThe  Project  will  cover  the  four  poorest  provinces  of  the  country.  In  the  northern  province  of \nSughd,  work  will  be  carried  out  on  the  Asht-1  irrigation  scheme.  In  the  Central  Region  of \nRepublican Subordination, irrigation systems in Vahdat district will be targeted. In the southern \nprovince of Khatlon, work will be done in both Farkhor and Panj districts. In the remote eastern \nGorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast, the irrigation infrastructure in Rushon will be repaired. \nAn estimated 262,000 beneficiaries live in the project areas, of whom 153,000 are poor. During \nstakeholder meetings at the project sites, three general themes emerged as causes of poverty: \nlack  of  reliable  irrigation  and  drinking  water  supplies,  limited  opportunities  to  become \nindependent farmers, and lack of jobs. These causes are addressed in the project design.  \n \nB. \n \nTo  achieve  higher  crop  productivity  and  income  of  rural  communities,  the  Project  will \n26. \n(i) rehabilitate  the selected  irrigation  infrastructure  and  support  improved  water  management; \n(ii) rehabilitate  the  selected  water  supply  schemes  and  establish  water  supply  committees for \nsustained  O&M;  (iii) provide  agricultural  support  to  farmers;  and  (iv) establish  appropriate \nmechanisms for project management, monitoring, and evaluation.  \n \n27. \nThe key outputs of the Project in terms of increasing productivity and rural incomes are  \n(i) rehabilitated  I&D  systems  at  the  project  sites,  (ii) improved  water  management,  and \n(iii) improved  agricultural practices and technologies.  The  key  outputs  to  improving  access  to \nsafe  drinking  water  are  the  reconstruction  of  potable  drinking  water  supply  systems  and \nimproved  participatory  management  of  these  facilities.  The  Project\u2019s outputs  also include  the \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n \n\nestablishment  of  a  project  management  office.  The  Project  is  also  accompanied  by  a  set  of \nassurances by the Government to implement a specific reform program within the project areas. \nA brief description of project components follows. \n \n\nInfrastructure  and  Support \n\nfor \n\nImproved  Water \n\n1. \n\nRehabilitation  of \nManagement \n\n \n28. \nIn  Sughd  district  (Asht-1  irrigation  system),  the  Project  will  (i) improve  the  intake  and \nprovide  sediment  removal  facilities;  (ii) rehabilitate  the  lowest  pumping  station  (ANS-1), \nincluding  replacement  of  pipeline  sections,  and  construct  a  protective  shelterbelt  for  pipelines; \n(iii) rehabilitate pumping stations ANS-2 and ANS-3B; (iv) provide gravity irrigation supply to the \nupper system levels;9 and (v) renovate canal linings, structures, and restore drain capacities. \n \n29. \nIn  Vahdat  district  (Rohati  and  Dashtibed  irrigation  systems),  the  works  include \n(i) rehabilitation of the headworks and a major siphon of the Rohati canal, (ii) rehabilitation of the \nheadworks  of  the  Dashtibed  canal  and  provision  of  a  weir  across  the  Kofarnihon  river,  and \n(iii) repairs to selected structures on both systems.  \n \n30. \nIn  Farkhor  district,  the  Project  will  focus  on  improving  sediment  and  water  control  and \nprioritized  rehabilitation  of  the  Urtaboz  pumping  system,  including  (i) improvement  of  the \nChubek headworks, construction of a new sediment removal facility,10 and provision of sediment \nremoval equipment; (ii) repair of canal linings and control structures and restoration of hydraulic \nperformance of key canals/drains; and (iii) priority rehabilitation of the Urtaboz pumping stations.  \n \nintake, \n31. \n(ii) rehabilitation  of  sediment  removal  facilities/provision  of  sediment  removal  equipment, \n(iii) repair  of  key  control  structures,  (iv) improvement  of  hydraulic  efficiency  of  canal/drain \nsections, and (v) priority rehabilitation of the Fayazabadkala pumping stations.11     \n \n32. \nIn  Rushon  district,  the  works  cover  repairs  to  small  systems:  (i) rehabilitation of intake \nworks and removal of large rocks from canals, (ii) selective repair of control structures and canal \nlinings, and (iii) restoration of main drains capacity.  \n \n33. \nDesilting  of  canals  and  drains  within  the  schemes  in  Farkhor  and  Panj  districts  will  be \ncarried  out  by  MWRLR.  The  Government  has  given  an  assurance  to  ADB  that  adequate \nbudgetary  allocations  will  be  made  to  complete  these  works12 before the award of civil works \ncontracts financed by the Project.  \n \n34. \nImproved  Water  Resources  Management.  The  Project  will  finance  institutional \ncapacity  building  of  the  water  management agencies and improvement of water management \nprocedures. The Project will also facilitate an increased role for the water users. WUAs will be \nestablished  in  the  project  areas  to  ensure  sustainable  O&M  of  the  rehabilitated  systems,  and \nstrengthen  rural  water  sector  institutions.  The  goal  is  to  have  WUAs  operating  successfully  at \nthe project sites. The formation of WUAs will initially focus on the core demonstration areas, to \n\nrehabilitation  work  comprises  (i) improvement  of \n\nIn  Panj  district, \n\nthe \n\n                                                 \n9  Providing a gravity irrigation supply to an area that at present receives pumped water supplies.  \n10  The location of this facility will be decided during the detailed design phase, in consultation with MWRLR. \n11  The  scope  of  replacement  of  pipelines  will  be  reviewed  during  the  detailed  design  stage,  and  corresponding \n\nbudget realignment within the allocation for rehabilitation of the cascades will be made if necessary. \n\n12  These works involve (i) excavation of 440,000 m 3 of sediments from drains, 255,000 m 3 from canals, and leveling \nof 475,000 m3 of previously removed material in Farkhor district; and (ii) excavation of 410,000 m3 from drains, \n145,000 m 3 from canals, and leveling of 180,000 m 3 in Panj district.  \n\n. \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\nshowcase  improved  land  and  water  management  techniques.  A  key  element  in  the  Project's \nWUA strengthening activities is the establishment of a WUA support unit at MWRLR, which will \nbe supported by the TA accompanying the loan (para. 57).  The purpose of this unit will be the \ninstitutionalization of WUA support, and its integration in MWRLR's planning activities.  \n \n\n2. \n\nAgricultural Support to Farmers  \n\n \n35. \nThere are severe deficiencies in the supply of quality seeds and in pest management in \nthe project areas. The ADB-financed ARP already includes subprograms for seed improvement \nand pest management, implemented by the Agricultural Academy of Sciences. These programs \nwill be extended in the core demonstration areas, where crop husbandry trials will be introduced \nto  promote  increased  crop  productivity,  crop  diversification,  and  intensification,  together  with \nimproved water management practices. Demonstration plots, with a total area of 500 ha, will be \nimplemented in each of the five project areas and training will be provided to district agricultural \nstaff.  An  integrated  pest  management  (IPM)  program  will  be  implemented  in  each  district,  to \nintroduce  farmers  to  the  IPM  concept.  The  program  will  be  implemented  by  the  Agricultural \nAcademy  of  Sciences  and  supported  by  local  and  international  research  institutes.  Upgrading \nthe quality of seed and introducing IPM could increase yields by more than 30%.  \n \n\n3. \n\nImprovement of Rural Potable Water Supply Systems \n\n \n36. \nThe Project will support reconstruction of five rural potable water supply systems within \nthe project areas and will provide drinking water to 57,000 beneficiaries. Villages to benefit from \nthe Project were selected in consultation with local communities and MWRLR. Criteria used in \nselection of target villages included (i) absence of a safe water source at present, (ii) potential \nfor  poverty  reduction  through  provision  of  an  improved  water  source,  and  (iii) the  priority \naccorded by local community representatives and MWRLR.  \n \nThe main works include (i) construction of intakes, a reservoir, distribution pipework, and \n37. \nstandpipes in Asht; (ii) construction of wells, and repairs to reservoirs and distribution network in \nVahdat  district;  (iii) provision  of  pumps  and  generators,  repairs  to  reservoirs  and  distribution \npipework  in  Farkhor;  (iv) construction  of  wells,  reservoirs,  pumping  stations,  pipelines,  and \nprovision  of  generators  in  Panj;  and  (v) construction  of  an  intake,  storage  reservoir,  and \ndistribution  pipework  in  Rushon.  After  construction,  community-based  water  committees  will \noperate  the  systems.  The  Project,  working  with  the  local  administration,  will  facilitate  the \nformation of water committees for each scheme at an early stage of the Project. Furthermore, \nthe  communities  will  provide  assistance  during  construction,  in  digging  pipeline  trenches. \nTraining will be given to the water committees to prepare them to carry out their responsibilities. \n \n\n4. \n\nProject Management, Monitoring, and Evaluation \n\n \n38. \nThe Project will establish and provide support to a project management office (PMO) in \nMWRLR,  Dushanbe  and  five  regional  offices  (ROs),  the  one  for  Vahdat  operating  out  of  the \nPMO  in  Dushanbe  and  the  others  based  in  their  project  areas.  ROs  will  be  responsible  for \nproject  implementation  in  their  areas,  and  for  maintaining  liaison  with  the  PMO,  local \nadministration,  and  beneficiary  organizations.  A  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  unit  will  be \nestablished within the PMO to implement the environmental monitoring system recommended in \nthe  summary  initial  environmental  examination  (Appendix  4)  and  to  monitor  the  economic, \npoverty, gender, social and environmental impacts of the Project. Specifically, the M&E unit will \nbe responsible for (i) collecting, collating, and analyzing baseline data relating to the economic, \npoverty, social, and environmental conditions disaggregated by gender, income, and farm types \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n \n\n5. \n\nPolicy Reforms in the Project Areas \n\nwithin the project areas; (ii) benefit monitoring during project implementation; and (iii) evaluating \nthe Project\u2019s economic, poverty, gender, social, and environmental impacts within the selected \nsystems.  The  M&E  unit  will  have  two  staff  members,  who  will  work  with  the  responsible \nagencies. For environmental monitoring, they will collect and analyze data relating to the quality \nof I&D water, soil chemistry, and groundwater depth and quality, and will provide  a comparison \nof the before and after project situations. Project performance monitoring and evaluation will be \ndone in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines on its project performance management system.  \n \nTo monitor the Project\u2019s social impact, during the first year of project implementation, the \n39. \nM&E  unit  will  compile  a  benchmark  database  on  basic  economic  and  social  conditions  to \nprovide  a  socioeconomic  profile  of  the  beneficiary  communities.  Key  indicators  will  be  tracked \nduring  project  implementation  and  a  comparison  made  between  the  benchmark  and  project \ncompletion situations. The database will be analyzed to provide an assessment of the Project\u2019s \nimpact on different social groups, including women and low-income households.  \n \n \n \n40. \nTo  deepen  the  ongoing  agriculture  sector  reforms,  the  Government  has  agreed  to \nimplement  specific  pilot-based  reform  actions  in  the  project  areas,  including  (i) improved farm \nstructure,  operations,  and  management  based  on  market-oriented  principles;  (ii) removal  of \ncotton  production  quotas,  and  involvement  of  local  authorities  in  directing  cotton  credit; \n(iii) issuance  of  tradable  land  lease  certificates  that  can  then  be  used  as  collateral;  and \n(iv) introduction of open cotton sales. These actions would help farms reorganize into a proper \nsize, under self-elected farm managers; accelerate land reforms; and substantially improve the \nprofitability, and hence productivity, of cotton, as well as of other crops. To help the Government \nsuccessfully  implement  these  reforms,  an  associated  TA  is  proposed  to  provide  technical \nexpertise and resources, including establishment of an open, participatory framework, involving \nfarmers, local authorities and investors, to guide, monitor, and assess the progress of reforms. \n \nC. \n \n41. \nRecognizing and promoting the primary beneficiaries\u2019 role in O&M of I&D facilities is an \nimportant element in improving system performance, water management, and cost recovery, as \nwell as ensuring equitable distribution of irrigation regardless of gender or poverty. The Project \nsupports  participatory  irrigation  management  through  development  of  WUAs,  in  close \ncollaboration with other development partners, including the USAID, which in principle, agreed \nto support the  establishment  of  WUAs  in  the  Asht-2 irrigation system in Sughd.  The progress \nand impacts of the reform agenda under the Project will have a significant influence on future \nsector reforms. Therefore, the Government has agreed to  review the Project\u2019s reform progress \nat  a  national-level  forum,  involving  development  partners,  NGOs,  and  other  stakeholders.  To \nmaximize  employment  and  income-generating  opportunities  at  the  project  sites,  government \nofficials have agreed to hire, through project-financed contracts, poor and vulnerable groups for \ncivil works to the maximum extent possible. \n \nD. \n \n42. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $29.0 million  equivalent,  comprising \n$13.3 million (45.7%) in foreign exchange cost and $ 15.7 million (54.3%) in local currency cost. \nThe cost estimates include $4.3 million for taxes and duties, and 5% of base costs for physical \ncontingencies.

A  PMO  will  be  established within MWRLR to \nmanage project activities and to liaise with ADB and with other coordinating bodies. Five ROs \nwill be established, the one for Vahdat operating out of the PMO in Dushanbe and the others \nbased in their subproject area. ROs will be responsible for project implementation in their areas, \nand  for  maintaining  liaison  with  local  administrations,  and  beneficiary  organizations.  The  PMO \nwill be led by a full-time manager and the ROs by regional managers. The PMO manager will be \nnominated by the  Government  and  endorsed  by  ADB.  The  regional  managers  and  other  key \nstaff will be selected by a panel of experts appointed by the Government.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n45. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  6  years,  starting  in  July  2005.  Project  activities \nduring the first year will concentrate on selecting and fielding consultants, procuring equipment, \ndeveloping  operational  systems  for  the  PMO/ROs,  and  training  their  staff.  Field  surveys, \ninvestigations, preparation of designs and bidding documents, and agricultural support activities \nin  the  five  project  districts  will  also  commence  in  the  first  year.  The  Project  civil  works  will  be \nimplemented in separate packages with construction starting in the second half of year 2. The \nproject implementation schedule is shown in Appendix 6.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n46.  Machinery,  equipment,  civil  works,  and  services;  vehicles;  office  equipment;  and \nmaterials  required  for  project  implementation  will  be  procured  following  ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement. To the extent possible, the Project will procure similar items in groups to optimize \nvolume discounts. Equipment supply and installation contracts estimated at $500,000 or more \nwill  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international  competitive  bidding.  Contracts  costing  less than \n$500,000 will be awarded on the basis of international shopping procedures acceptable to ADB.  \n \nEach civil works contract estimated to cost the equivalent of $1.0 million or more will be \n47. \nawarded  on  the  basis  of  international  competitive  bidding  among  prequalified  contractors  as \ndescribed  in  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Civil  works  packages  costing  less  than \n$1.0 million will be carried out on the basis of local competitive bidding procedures acceptable \nto  ADB.  For  works  whose  size,  nature,  and  location  make  them  unsuitable  for  competitive \nbidding, and if MWRLR has the facilities and capacity to implement these works expeditiously \nand  at  a  reasonable  cost,  ADB  may  agree  to  force  account  procedures.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \n\nRepublic of Tajikistan for the Agricultural Rehabilitation Project. Manila.  \n\n14  EA has been assessed by TA 4052-TAJ, and TA recommendations are incorporated in the project design.    \n15  The project steering committee is chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister in charge of agriculture, water, land, and of \nenvironment protection. The members of the committee include the Minister of MWRLR, Minister of Agriculture, \nDeputy Minister of Nature Protection and Forestry, Chairman of State Committee for Land Management, Deputy \nMinister of Finance, Deputy Minister of Economy and Trade, and Deputy Minister of Health. \n\n. \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n\nimplemented  through  force  account  will  be  determined  during  implementation.  The  upper  limit \nfor a force account works package will be $50,000. A list of contract packages is in Appendix 7. \n \n48. \nTo  procure  goods  and  services  with  the  loan  proceeds,  the  Borrower  will  need  to \ndemonstrate that the local procurement procedures adopted are transparent and efficient, and \nconform with ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy. The EA will certify to ADB that the goods and services \nfinanced  by  the  loan  are  procured  from  ADB  member  countries.  Where  the  value  of  goods \nfinanced by the loan exceeds $1,000,000, a preshipment inspection certificate from an agency, \nacceptable to ADB, will be required. The award of contracts will be subject to approval by ADB. \n \n\n4. \n\nAdvance Procurement Action and Retroactive Financing \n\n \nAt the Government's request, ADB has approved retroactive financing of PMO and ROs \n49. \nstaff,  facilities,  and  equipment  to  facilitate  timely  establishment  of  these  management  offices \nand  accelerate  project  implementation.  The  retroactive  financing  will  be  provided  to  finance \neligible  expenditures  under  contracts  approved  only  on  or  after  appraisal  date,  and  will  be \nsubject to a ceiling of $100,000 equivalent covering the expenses incurred in the period from 16 \nSeptember 2004 to effectiveness of the Loan Agreement. The Government has been informed \nthat  (i) advance  action  for  the  procurement  of  items  other  than  those  covered  under  the \nretroactive financing will cover actions up to, but not including, contract signing; and (ii) approval \nof advance action and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the Project.  \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nThe Project will provide a total of 684 person-months of consulting services, comprising \n50. \n78 person-months of international consultants and 606 person-months of domestic consultants \nto  supplement  MWRLR's  project  management  capacity.  To  minimize  the  over  reliance  on \nconsultants  and  the  burden  of  consulting  services  costs,  input  of  international  consultants  has \nbeen kept to a minimum, restricted to areas for which technical capacity is limited in government \nagencies;  institutional  capacity-building  programs  have  also  been  incorporated  in  the  project \ndesign.  The  consultants  will  assist  MWRLR  in  (i) design,  procurement,  and  construction \nsupervision;  (ii) agricultural  support  services;  and  (iii) project  management,  monitoring,  and \nevaluation. These services will be provided by an international consulting firm(s) in association \nwith  domestic  consulting  firm(s)  to  be  engaged  by  MWRLR  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the \nengagement of domestic consultants.16 \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n51. \nAn  imprest  account  will  be  established  at  a  bank  acceptable  to  ADB,  to  facilitate  the \ntimely  release  of  loan  funds  for  payments  in  local  currency.  During  the  first  year  of \nimplementation,  the  ceiling  of  the  imprest  account  will  be  set  at  $500,000.  Subsequently,  the \nimprest account ceiling should be 6 months\u2019 estimated expenditures or 10% of the loan amount, \nwhichever  is  lower.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established  and  managed  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedures will be used \nto  reimburse  expenditures  and  liquidate  the  imprest  account  for  payments  not  exceeding \n$100,000 equivalent per payment. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n16  ADB's quality- and cost-based selection method will be used. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13 \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n52.  MWRLR will keep separate accounts and financial statements for the Project, which will \nbe audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. Loan proceeds will be used for \nengaging auditors acceptable to ADB. Certified copies of the audited financial statements will be \nsubmitted  to  ADB  within  6  months  after  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year  to  which  they  relate.  A \nseparate opinion on the use of imprest account and statement of expenditures procedures will \nbe included in the audit report. The Government was informed of ADB\u2019s policy on submission of \naudited accounts, which covers failure in submitting audited accounts and financial statements \nwithin the due date. A formal warning will be issued for accounts more than 6 months overdue \nand disbursements will be suspended for accounts that are more than 12 months overdue. \n \n53.  MWRLR, through the PMO, will submit quarterly and annual reports to ADB. The reports \nwill  indicate  progress  made  and  problems  encountered  during  the  period  under  review,  steps \ntaken  to  remedy  the  problems,  the  proposed  program  of  activities,  and  expected  progress \nduring  the  remaining  implementation  period. MWRLR will also provide such other reports and \ninformation  relating  to  the  Project  as  ADB  may  reasonably  request,  including  the  Project\u2019s \nenvironmental impacts, dialogue with beneficiaries, and any social issues relating to the Project. \nWithin 3 months after physical completion of the Project, MWRLR will submit to ADB a project \ncompletion report detailing information on project implementation, use of the loan proceeds, and \nthe extent to which the objectives of the Project have been accomplished.  \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \nTo  monitor  the  progress  of  physical  works,  the  Project  provides  for  a  comprehensive \n54. \nsystem of performance monitoring and evaluation (para. 39). An M&E unit will be established to \nmonitor  project  performance,  including  environmental,  poverty,  gender,  and  social  impacts  as \nspecified  in  the  summary  initial  environmental  examination  and  the  poverty  and  social \nassessment,  and  the  progress  of  various  reform  measures  introduced  under  the  Project, \naccording to the specific monitoring indicators described in the project framework (Appendix 1). \nThe TA accompanying the loan will monitor progress of  policy reforms in the project areas, and \ntheir impact on farm productivity/profitability, financial gains, farmers\u2019 incentives, etc.  \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n55. \nThe Project will be reviewed regularly by ADB missions. During the third year of project \nimplementation,  the  Government  and  ADB  will  carry  out  a  midterm  review  to  assess  the \nachievement of project objectives. Project objectives will be measured against the performance \ncriteria  listed  in  Appendix  1.  The  parameters  for  assessing  the  implementation  milestones  will \ninclude  (i) implementation  status,  (ii) design  and  construction  standards,  (iii) physical progress \nand  disbursements  in  relation  to  the  implementation  schedule,  (iv) performance  of  the \nconsultants  and  contractors,  (v) status  of  compliance  with  loan  covenants,  and  (vi) status of \nachievement of the Project\u2019s development objectives. The midterm review will also  assess the \nneed for changes in the project, and recommend measures to achieve project objectives. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n56. \nThe objectives of the TA Support for Monitoring Policy Reforms and Improving Farm and \nWater  Management  are  to  (i) monitor  progress  in  implementing  policy  in  the  project  areas; \n(ii) promote  competitive  providers  of  farm  inputs,  technical  advice,  credit,  and  marketing  of \nproduce in the project areas; and (iii) assist the Government in establishing a WUA support unit \n\n. \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\nwithin  MWRLR.  The  TA  will  provide  comprehensive  monitoring,  evaluation,  and  reporting  on \nprogress  being  made  by  the  Government  toward  its  commitments  to  accelerate  land  reform, \nfarm  privatization,  and  farm  debt  resolution,  based  on  feedback  from  community  and \nnongovernment  organizations  and  elected  representatives.  The  TA  component  for  the \nalternative business providers will focus on (i) analyzing the strengths and limitations of existing \nbusiness  providers  beyond  the  services  offered  by  traditional  investors,  and  (ii) providing \ncapacity building for selected providers to expand their services to farmers in the project areas. \nThe TA assistance for the WUA support unit will focus on (i) defining the support unit\u2019s mandate, \norganizational  structure,  functions,  staffing  pattern,  and  legal  status;  and  (ii) providing \ninstitutional  strengthening  and  technical  advice  to  ensure  that  the  support  unit  can  properly \noperate  in  a  sustainable  manner.  A  grant  of  $500,000  equivalent17 financed by  ADB\u2019s  TA \nfunding  program will provide the services of 12 person-months of international and 37 person-\nmonths of domestic consultants.18 MWRLR will be the EA for the TA, which will be implemented \nover  a  period  of  24  months,  starting  in  2006.  The  implementation  will  be  divided  into  two \nphases\u2014preparation and capacity building. Details of the TA are shown in Appendix 8. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\n \nA. \n \n\nExpected Impacts \n\n1. \n\nEconomic and Financial Analyses \n\n \n57.   Economic and financial analyses were carried out to assess the economic viability and \nsustainability  of  the  Project,  and  the  financial  viability  of  the  participating  farms.  The  main \nquantifiable benefits of the investment come from (i) preventing the loss of production that may \noccur due to further deterioration of I&D facilities without the Project; and (ii) modest increases \nin  yields  and  cropping  intensity  resulting  from  more  reliable  irrigation  water  supply,  improved \nseed quality, reduced pests and disease, and improved cropping technologies.  \n \n58.  Without the Project, declining water supply and increasingly inefficient pumps will have a \nnegative impact on crop yields and the area cultivated. In the pump irrigation areas, the average \nyield for cotton will decline from the present level of 1.3 t/ha to around 1.1 t/ha, and wheat yields \nwill decline from 2.5 t/ha to 2.2 t/ha. In the gravity-supplied areas, yield declines of cotton and \nwheat will be slight. With the Project, in the pump irrigation areas, the average cotton yield will \nincrease  to  about  1.9 t/ha  and  the  wheat  yield  will  increase  to  3.3 t/ha.  In  the  gravity  areas, \ncotton  yields  will  increase  to  2.0 t/ha  and  wheat  yields  will  increase  to  around  3.5 t/ha.  The \nannual  output  of  cotton  will  increase  from  38,700  t  to  47,700  t  and  wheat  production  will  rise \nfrom  26,800  t  to  32,400  t  by  the  eighth  year  after  implementation.  These  are  conservative \nassumptions compared with best practices in the area.19 \n \nBenefits also accrue from the reduction in pumping costs for water in the pump irrigation \n59. \narea  and  savings  of  maintenance  costs  of  the  rehabilitated  systems.  The  greater  efficiency  of \nnew  pumps  and  the  conversion  of  the  upper  areas  of  the  Asht  cascade  to  gravity  supply  will \n\n                                                 \n17  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $625,000 equivalent. The Government, through in-kind contributions, will \n\nfinance $125,000 equivalent. \n\n18  International  consultants  will  be  selected  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants. \nArrangements satisfactory to ADB will be used for the engagement of domestic consultants. Simplified technical \nproposals and ADB's quality- and cost-based selection system will be used.  \n\n19  The assumed yields for cotton in the future with this Project are attainable given that current best practices in the \ndistricts achieve up to 3.2 t/ha for cotton and generally achieve 50% or more on the above current district average \nyields. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15 \n \n\nreduce the energy cost of pumping by an estimated $1,312,500 per year (in economic prices). \nRehabilitation of headworks, canal structures, and sediment basins will reduce O&M costs by an \nestimated $191,200 per year. Proper O&M for the pumping stations will require an increase in \nexpenditures from the current level of about $44,000 per year with the Project. \n \n60. \nThe  rehabilitation  of  rural  water  supply  schemes  has  been  assessed  separately  using \nthe  time  savings  method  developed  by  ADB\u2019s  Economics  and  Research  Department.  The \nschemes will improve the access of selected villages to a safe water supply and will have health \nbenefits as well as save time spent collecting water. The results of this analysis are consistent \nwith all five schemes having an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) greater than 12%. \n \n61. \nThe  EIRR  of  the  Project  is  20.7%  and  the  economic  net  present  value  (NPV) at  the \ndiscount rate of 12% is $9.9 million. The EIRR of the individual district subprojects varies from \n13.5%  in  Rushon  to  26.1%  in  Farkhor.  Sensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  the  EIRR  is  robust, \nabove 12%, despite adverse effects of price and yield declines, benefit delays, and investment \ncost increases. The farm budget analyses for large and small farms and household plots in each \ndistrict indicate that farm incomes at all levels will increase with the Project.  \n \n62. \nA  benefit  distribution  and  poverty  impact  analysis  was  carried  out.  The  economic \nbenefits  are  distributed  among  the  three  main  stakeholder  groups  with  $0.4 million  to  farm \nhouseholds,  $7.0 million  to  dekhan 20  farms,  and  $2.4 million  to  the  Government.  A  poverty \nimpact ratio of 69% was calculated, indicating that $6.8 million of the economic benefits accrue \nto the poor. Detailed economic and financial analyses is shown in Appendix 9.  \n \nThe  effect  of  the  intended  policy  initiatives 21  has  not  been  taken  into  account  in  the \n63. \nfinancial and economic analyses. However, the implementation of the reform agenda will further \nincrease  the  projected  with-project  benefits,  and  empower  private  farmers  to  improve  farm \nfinancing, management, marketing of produce, and profitability.  \n \n\n2.   \n\nImpact on Environment \n\n \n64. \nAn  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  conducted  during  project  preparation. \nThe  IEE  confirms  that  the  Project  will  result  in  significant  positive  environmental  impacts.  The \nProject  does  not  involve  construction  of  new  canals,  and  will  not  expand  irrigated  areas,  or \npumping capacity. The rehabilitation of I&D systems and improved water efficiency will reduce \nland degradation from salinity buildup and soil erosion. Coupled with  the improvement of rural \nwater supply, the Project addresses two of six major environmental problems in Tajikistan.22  \n \n65. \nNone of the project components is located within a protected area. The ecosystem in the \nproject  areas  have  been  extensively  modified  and  as  a  result  both  terrestrial  and  aquatic \nbiodiversity  is  considered  to  have  been  much  reduced  since  the  beginning  of  accelerated \nagricultural  and  industrial  development  in  the  1950s. 23  Measures  have  been  proposed  to \nmitigate  minor  potential  negative  impacts  identified  in  the  IEE.  Of  these  impacts,  the  most \ncrucial  is  related  to  fish  movement  upstream  from  the  proposed  weir  on  the  Kofarnihon  river, \nand  the  integration  of  measures  to  avoid  fish  entrainment  in  the  rehabilitated  intakes.  Further \nstudy  will  be  undertaken  during  project  implementation.

Manila. \n23  Due to large-scale hydropower, mining, and logging projects. \n\n. \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\nenvironmental  management  and  monitoring  have  been  integrated  into  the  project  design  and \ncosts. \n \n\n \n\n3.   \n\nImpact on Living Standards \n\na. \n\nPoverty Reduction \n\nthrough \n\nincomes \n\nincreased \n\nfarm  productivity  and \n\n \nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  reduction  in  income-based  poverty  by  improving  farm \n66. \nincreasing  employment \nhousehold \nopportunities. To address this type of poverty, the Project will improve the reliability of irrigation \nwater supplies to 47,500 ha of irrigated land and ensure better, cheaper, and timely access to \nagricultural  inputs.  These  will  benefit  153,000  poor  people,  generate  an  increase  of  41%  in \ndekhan  farm  incomes  and  33%  in  household  plots  incomes.  Increased  agricultural  outputs \n(cotton by 23% and wheat by 21%) will lead to increased rural incomes. Improved agricultural \nactivities  will  spur  the  demand  for  labor  estimated  at  750,000  labor-days. As illustrated by the \ndistribution  analysis,  the  Project\u2019s  economic  benefits  will  accrue  more  to  the  poor  households \nthan other beneficiary groups. Sustained income benefits for poor households will also translate \ninto a decrease, in the medium term, in the incidence of poverty in the project areas by 5%. The \nbenefits  accrue  at  these  levels  immediately  after  providing  a  reliable  source  of  water  for \nirrigation even without institutional reforms being in place. Once such reforms are implemented, \nthe benefits, especially those for the poor, will be even greater. \n \n67. \nNonincome-based  poverty  in  rural  Tajikistan  is  also  closely  related  to  the  lack  of  clean \ndrinking water. The Project will address this issue by rehabilitating rural water supply systems, \nand 5,150 poor households will benefit from new potable water supplies. The summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 10. \n \n\nb. \n\nGender and Development \n\n \n68. \nAn estimated 18% of total households in Tajikistan are headed by women. In rural areas, \nthat percentage increases dramatically. In many rural households, women have the dual roles of \nboth caregiver and breadwinner, as many men have migrated to Russia to find employment. As \nmany of the men do not send remittances to their families from Russia, the women often have to \nearn income and care for the children at the same time. Women traditionally work in the social \nand agriculture sectors, where wages are five to eight times lower than salaries in industrial and \nconstruction sectors.  \n \n69. \nThe Project will improve women's access to food and income-generating activities, and \ndecrease their vulnerability to waterborne diseases. The Project will ensure that female-headed \nfarms  in  project  areas  are  WUA  members  and  that  women  are  fully  represented  in  project \ndesign, planning, and implementation meetings. Women will make up at least 30% of the local \nwater  supply  committees  and  they  will  be  provided  with  training  in  rural  water  supply \nmanagement. Women will be also trained in new agricultural practices.  A gender action plan is \nshown in Appendix 11. The Project will not have any adverse impact on ethnic minorities and \nwill not activate ADB\u2019s policy on indigenous peoples.  \n \n\nc. \n\nImproved Rural Institutions \n\n \nThe Project will explicitly tie or link the physical improvement in irrigation and rural water \n70. \nsupply  systems  with  institutional  development.  Rural  institutions  to  be  established  and \nirrigation  management  and  O&M, \ndeveloped \n\ninclude  (i) WUAs \n\nfocusing  on \n\nimproved \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17 \n \n\n(ii) participatory  water  supply  committees  responsible  for  long-term  O&M  of  the  rehabilitated \nrural water supply systems, (iii) women's groups focusing not only on women-specific activities \nbut broadening the opportunities for women to participate in project activities, and (iv) informal \nassociations of independent farmers formed to take advantage of economies of scale. \n \n\nd. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n \n71. \nThere  will  be  limited  new  construction  under  the  Project.  A  settling  basin  will  be \nconstructed,  on  government  land  near  the  main  canal  in  Khatlon  region.  Nine  households \nwithout  title  or  permission  to  use  the  land  are  presently  cultivating  approximately  6.5  ha  of \ngovernment  land  at  the  potential  settling  basin  site.  The  household  members  are  not  living  at \nthe site, but only cultivating land. No structures, therefore, would have to be moved or replaced. \nThe  size  of  the  settling  basin  requires  less  than  half  of  the  land  potentially  available  for \nconstruction, and therefore a more advantageous location could be selected, based on detailed \ntopographic  surveys.  Nevertheless,  a  short  resettlement  plan  has  been  developed  (Appendix \n12) to adequately address and compensate these households, ensuring that their livelihood will \nnot be negatively affected by the construction.  \n \n72. \nIn Asht district, the construction of a drinking water reservoir will require a village road to \nbe moved slightly using  vacant government land. Additionally, it is possible that a small edge of \na household fence, involving an area of less than 5.0  square meter (m2), may also have to be \nmoved,  thus,  only  a  short  resettlement  plan  is  required.  Specific  assurances  have  been \nobtained  from  the  Government  that,  should  any  resettlement  become  unavoidable  (para.  80), \nthe Government will ensure that land acquisition is carried out in accordance with all applicable \nlaws and regulations of the Borrower, and with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement. \n \n\ne. \n\nGovernance and Anticorruption \n\nRisks and Safeguards  \n\n \n73.  During project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to the Government. \nAttention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement, \nparticularly on the need for bidders, suppliers, and contractors to observe the highest standards \nof  ethics  in  procurement  and  execution  of  ADB-financed  contracts,  and  the  sanctions  if  fraud \nand corruption are discovered. A monitoring system will be established under the associated TA \nto, among other things, promote transparency in contract awarding and monitor the execution of \ncontracts. \n \nB. \n \n74. \nThe Project will be ADB\u2019s third investment project implemented by MWRLR,  which has \ndemonstrated  adequate  implementation  capacity  in  the  past.  Thus  the  risk  of  implementation \ndelays  arising  from  MWRLR\u2019s  unfamiliarity  with  ADB  procedures  is  low.  For  the  Project, \nMWRLR staff have been closely involved in the project processing, and their understanding and \nknowledge  of  the  Project  will  also  minimize  the  risk  of  initial  implementation  delays  that  are \ncommonly observed in ADB projects. \n \n75. \nThe risk of the rehabilitated I&D schemes not being maintained adequately is significant. \nThe  Government  does  not  have  the  financial  resources  to  ensure  sustainable  O&M,  without \nrelying on recovery of irrigation service fees from beneficiaries. The Project addresses this risk \nby  (i) helping  develop  participatory  management  of  I&D  systems  through  WUAs,  and \n(ii) assisting  MWRLR  implement  an  improved  cost  recovery  policy.  In  addition,  the  project \nschemes have been selected for  low O&M costs; design and procurement of equipment will be \n\n. \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n\nbased on energy efficiency; and differential irrigation service fees will be introduced for lift and \ngravity schemes. Specific assurances in these areas have been obtained from the Government; \ndetails of the proposed O&M arrangements are in Supplementary Appendix C.  \n \nFor  the  farmers  to  take  full  advantage  of  improved  and  secured  irrigation  water  supply \n76. \nand turn this into improved productivity, they need to access technologies through sustainable \ninstitutional  arrangements.  The  Project  addresses  the  risk  of  a  technology  gap  by  providing \nimmediate TA through demonstration farms (para. 36), and by accelerating private sector entry \ninto farm support services (para. 57). \n \n77. \nThe  policy  reforms  to  be  implemented  under  the  Project  is  ambitious,  particularly  in \naddressing the vested interests of local authorities, cotton investors, and the local government-\nappointed  farm  managers.  To  implement  the  reforms,  the  Government  needs  a  high  level  of \npolitical commitment. If the reforms are not implemented properly in a comprehensive manner, \nrural  poverty  may  significantly  deepen\u2014perhaps  in  the  form  of  further  accumulation  of  farm \ndebts.  On  the  other  hand,  if  the  reforms  are  implemented  too  rapidly,  cotton  investors  may \ndecide  to  stay  out  of  business,  thereby  effectively  taking  away  the  livelihood  of  many  cotton \nfarm workers. To address these risks, the Project will establish an open and participatory forum, \nincluding farmers, local authorities, development partners, civil society, and cotton investors, to \nregularly review and assess the progress and impacts of reforms. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nA. \n \n78. \nthe legal documents: \n \n\nThe Government has given the following specific assurances, which are incorporated in \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nPreconstruction works.  The  Borrower  will  ensure  that  desilting  of  canals and \ndrains  within  the  project  schemes  is  carried  out,  and  will  provide  budgetary \nallocation to ensure that these works will be completed before the award of civil \nworks contracts financed by the Project.   \nEnvironment.  (a)  The  Project  will  be  carried out, and all facilities constructed, \noperated,  maintained,  and  monitored,  in  accordance  with  the  existing  laws, \nregulations, and standards of the  Borrower concerning environmental protection, \nand  ADB\u2019s  environment  policy;  and  (b) the  Borrower  will  ensure  that  MWRLR \nimplements the environmental mitigation measures and monitoring requirements \nas  outlined  in  the  IEE.  Further,  the  Borrower  will  assure  that  an  appropriate \nbudgetary  allocation  (including  vehicles,  material  and  equipment,  operating \nexpenses, and staff) is provided by MWRLR and the State Committee of Nature \nProtection  and  Forestry  to  fulfill  their  responsibilities  for  implementation  of \nmitigation measures and monitoring requirements as outlined in the IEE. \nResettlement.  The Borrower will ensure that involuntary resettlement under the \nProject,  if  any,  including  loss  of  crops,  land,  other  resources/assets,  is \nundertaken in conformity with a resettlement plan to be prepared by the Borrower \nin accordance with ADB's policy on involuntary resettlement. The compensation \nto  the  persons  affected  by  the  resettlement  will  make  them  as  well  off  as  they \nwould  be  in  the  absence  of  the  Project.  The  resettlement  plan  will  be  updated, \nbased  on  detailed  designs,  and  it  will  be  disclosed  to  all  affected  persons  in  a \nform  and  language  that  they  can  understand,  and  it  will  be  submitted  with  the \nEA's endorsement to ADB for review and approval before any civil works contract \nis awarded.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19 \n \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nGender  and  development.  The  Borrower  will  start,  within  1  year  of  loan \neffectiveness, implementation of the gender action plan outlined in the summary \npoverty  reduction  and  social  strategy.

(a) The  Borrower  will  provide  adequate  budgetary  allocation, \nincluding  that  needed  to  cover  the  transition  period  up  to  full  cost  recovery  and \ncollection  of  the  irrigation  service  fees;  (b) the  Borrower  will  issue  a  resolution, \nnot later than 31 December 2007, to set differential irrigation service fees for lift \nand gravity irrigation schemes. These fees will be increased gradually until they \nfully cover the cost of O&M of the irrigation facilities by 31 December 2010, in line \nwith the Borrower's agreement with the World Bank; (c) the Borrower will provide \nadequate  budgetary  allocation,  including  that  needed  to  cover  the  transition \nperiod  up  to  full  cost  recovery  and  collection  of  the  irrigation  service fees; and \n(d) the Borrower will formulate, with the assistance of the Project, a potable water \nsupply  cost  recovery  and  fee  structure  based  on  assessment  of  ability  to  pay, \nespecially of poor farm households, and will, not later than 31 December 2008, \nimplement such a policy. \n\n(vi)  Water  user\u2019s  associations  and  water  supply  committees  in  the  project \nareas. Within 3 years of loan effectiveness, the  Borrower will ensure that WUAs \nand  water  supply  committees  are  established  in  the  project  areas,  and  that  the \nWUAs will assume the responsibilities to carry out the O&M of the on-farm I&D \nfacilities after they are fully organized and trained, but not later than 2 years after \nrehabilitation of their infrastructure is complete. \n\n(vii)  Cotton  financing  and  marketing.  Not  later  than  31  December  2006,  (a)  the \nBorrower will insure that Presidential Decree No. 899 of 23 September 2002 be \nstrictly  implemented  by  the  regional  and  district  level  administrations  in  the \nProject area to abolish planning target for cotton production,  which sets both the \narea of farm land for producing cotton and the quantity of fiber to be produced; \n(b) the Borrower, in consultation with ADB, develop and implement mechanism to \nensure that the farm-gate prices for raw cotton will be linked to world prices for \ncotton  fiber;  the  fixed  export  price  for  cotton  fiber  will  be  changed  from  a \nmaximum to a minimum price; and  these prices will be published/made available \nto  the  public;  (c) within  the  project  areas  the  Borrower  will  ensure  that,  in \naccordance  with  Presidential  Decree  No.  899  of  23  September  2002  and \nResolution  No.  412  of  22  October  1999,  the  regional  and  district  administration \nwill  permit  financing  by  multiple  cotton  investors,    ensure  that  ginning  services \nare not restricted by administrative boundaries, and permit the movement of raw \ncotton  across  the  administrative  boundaries  for  ginning  and  marketing;  and \n(d) the  Borrower  will,  with  the  assistance  of  the  TA  for  Support  for  Monitoring \nPolicy Reforms and Improving Farm and Water Management, develop standard \ncotton  financing  and  production  contracts  to  ensure  introduction  of  financial \ndisciplines and appropriate allocation of rights, benefits, responsibilities, and risks \namong  the  concerned  parties.  The  Borrower  will  submit  such  draft  standard \ncontracts for ADB\u2019s review and, after ADB\u2019s approval, implement these contracts \nin the project areas.  \n\n. \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  Agricultural  support  services  in  the  project  areas.  Not  later  than  31 \nDecember 2006,  with  the  assistance  provided  under  the  Project,  the  Borrower \nwill (a) develop a farm support service plan and  implement measures to improve \nfarm  productivity  and  profitability, \nthrough  dissemination  of  market \ninformation;  provision of farm support services for improved farming technology \nand crop diversification; and increasing crop value through improved marketing, \nprocessing,  and  adoption  of  international  standards  for  cotton  grading.  The \nBorrower will  jointly  review  with  ADB  on  an  annual  basis  the  availability  and \nquality  of  farm  support  services;  and  (b) ensure  that  the  planned  and  existing \nfarm  support  services,  particularly  farm  machinery  provided  through  the \nJapanese  Non-Project  Grant  funded  Program  are made available to the private \nfarms in the project areas within one year of loan effectiveness. \nFarm reorganization and land reform.

 \nIntroduction \nA. \n\nAGRICULTURE AND WATER SECTOR ANALYSIS \n\n1. \nThe  agriculture  sector  resource  base  covers  some  4.07 million hectares (ha) of which \n3.3 million  ha  are  permanent  pastures.  The  cultivated  area  is  about  0.84 million  ha  of  which \n0.72 million  ha  are  irrigated.  Agricultural  production  is  dominated  by  cotton  and  wheat,  which \ntogether account for around 75% of total cultivated area, and provide employment for more than \n50% of the country\u2019s labor force. The sector generates about 30% of export revenues and 35% \nof  tax  revenues.  Since  independence  from  the  former  Soviet  Union,  allocating  sufficient \nresources to maintain rural infrastructure, including the irrigation systems, has been difficult for \nthe Government and there has been extensive deterioration. \n \n2. \nDuring  the  1990s,  Tajikistan  experienced  significant  increases  in  the  levels  of  poverty, \nespecially in rural areas. The Government recognizes the need to reduce poverty and increase \nincomes.  The  target  stated  in  its  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper1 is to reduce the poverty \nlevel from 83% in 1999 to 60% in 2015.2  Since the majority of the poor are in rural areas, these \nobjectives cannot be  achieved  without  effective  measures  to  increase  agricultural  output  and \npromote  agricultural  employment.  As  part  of  its  development  strategy,  the  Government  is \ncommitted to  (i) rehabilitation of key irrigation facilities, (ii) improving the efficiency of  irrigation \nwater  use,  (iii) continuing  farm  reorganization,  (iv) developing  a  rural  credit  system,  and \n(v) implementing a poverty reduction program with a substantial agriculture sector component. \n \nB. \n \n\nSector Performance \n\n1. \n\nAgriculture and Land  \n\n \nDuring the 1990s, performance in the agriculture sector was characterized by a decline \n3. \nin the area, yields, and output of the key cotton crop and by an increase in the area and output \nof  cereals.  In  many  areas,  food  security  became  of  overriding  importance.  Agricultural \nproductivity  is  also  well  below  pre-independence  levels  with  average  cotton  yields  currently \n1.7 t/ha compared with 2.8 t/ha before independence. Wheat yields are also low at an average \nof 1.3 t/ha. During the same period, the number of people employed in rural areas rose by over \n32%,  but  much  of  this  employment  is  intermittent  or  part  time  and  underemployment  in  the \nsector is high. \n \n4. \nLand remains the property of the state and families either individually or collectively are \ngiven  land  use  rights,  which  are  heritable  but  not  tradable.  These  limitations  restrict  the \nevolution  of  commercial  agriculture.  The  lack  of  clear  procedures  under  the  existing  Law  on \nDekhan Farms adopted in 1992 for land allocation to private farmers and for dispute settlement \nresulted in local authorities\u2019 use of these procedures being viewed as arbitrary. To remove these \nflaws, the Parliament amended the law in 2002. By the end of 2002, the State Land Committee \nhad  transformed some 500 state farms into  dekhan  farms3 but the related land tenure rights \nremain weak and can be rescinded by local authorities. Only 10% of rural families have direct \n\n                                                 \n1  The  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper  (PRSP)  was  approved  by  the  Majlisi  Oli  (Parliament)  of  the  Republic  of \n\nTajikistan on 19 June 2002. \n\n2  Based on the government-defined poverty level in 1999 of Tajik Somoni 20 per person per month. Appendix 10: \nSummary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy contains a summary of the poverty rates estimated for Tajikistan. \n\n3  Dekhan farms are collectively owned farms based on nuclear or extended families. \n\n. \n\n\f     Appendix  2 \n\n26 \n\ncontrol  over  land  assets  other  than  household  plots.4  Many  structural,  legal,  and  political \nimpediments prevent a comprehensive implementation of land reform and much of Tajikistan's \nrural  land  is  managed  and  operated  by  collective  dekhan  farms,  joint  stock  companies,  or \ncooperative production farms, which are little different in operation to the old state farms. \n \n5. \nSince 1997, many farms have accumulated significant amounts of debt, which is linked \nto  the  financing  of  cotton,  using  the  crop  as  collateral. 5     More  than  70%  of  farm  debt  is \nconcentrated  within  108  farms  that  have  never  repaid  any  cotton  loans.6    These  collective \ndekhan  farms  have  been  reorganized  in  such  a  way  during  the  land  reform  process  that  any \neconomic  incentives  to  improve  performance  have  been  minimized.  For  this  type  of  farm,  the \nfarm managers are largely unaccountable to the members (who are responsible for repayment \nof the debt). Debt levels are now high enough in many cases to provide a further disincentive to \nproduction and are placing a constraint on the further development of irrigated agriculture. Along \nwith policy reforms, it has been proposed by the recently conducted study (technical assistance \n[TA] 4052-TAJ: Farm Debt Resolution and Policy Reforms) that a financial restructuring of the \nunprofitable farms be undertaken to resolve this problem.  \n \n6. \nThe proposed debt resolution strategy is based on the premise that the solution to farm \ndebt is profitable farms. The main contention of the recent study is that the number of profitable \nfarms  will  not increase without major restructuring of the existing collective  dekhan farms and \nwithout  substantial  policy  reforms  to  create  an  appropriate  commercial  environment  for  farm \nenterprises to grow. \n \n7. \nMany  existing  farms  as  well  as  newly  organized  dekhan  farms  suffer  from  a  lack  of \naccess  to  supplies  of  inputs  (including  credit)  at  competitive  prices,  and  technical  extension \nservices. The inputs provided by the cooperative  dekhan farms can be twice as expensive as \ninputs  purchased  in  the  markets,  and  often  the  inputs  are  provided  late.  Independent  dekhan \nfarms, on the other hand, are free to purchase inputs they want in local markets at competitive \nprices,  although  the  lack  of  alternative  sources  of  credit  can  affect  the  production activities of \nthese farms and act as a constraint against achieving higher output levels. \n \n8. \nProposed policy reforms for farm debt resolution include (i) farm management reforms to \nrestructure  collective  farms  into  smaller  manageable  farms  with  farm  managers  who  are \naccountable to their members; (ii) government reforms to stop issuing cotton production targets; \n(iii) enacting legislation for land registration and leasehold rights; (iv)  reforms on recognition of \nland  and  leases  as  collateral,  implementation  of  loan  classification,  and  investors  accepting \nliability  for  trade  credit;  (v) cotton  processing  and  marketing  reforms  to  reduce  the  costs  of \ncotton  exports,  force  ginneries  to  compete  for  raw  material  supplies  and  allow open pricing of \ncotton sales; and (vi) irrigation finance to ensure pricing of water delivery reflects its true costs.  \n \nDue  to  the  lack  of  funding  and  personnel,  there  is  no  formal  agricultural  extension \n9. \nservice  in  Tajikistan.  At  the  district  level,  agricultural  offices  try  to  provide  some  agricultural \nextension  and  advice,  but  they  have  limited  resources.  At  the  field  level,  farmers  receive  little \nsystematic  information  on  agricultural  inputs,  markets  or  improved  water  management \n\n                                                 \n4  These  and  most  other  land  reform  issues  are  being  addressed  by  ongoing  World  Bank  projects,  the  recently \ncompleted Farm Debt Resolution and Policy Reforms TA, some bilateral agencies, and by Food and Agriculture \nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO)-led coordination group monitoring the land reform process. \n\n5  During this period, cotton credit has been almost the only source of working capital available to farms and some \n\nfarm managers freely admit that some of the funds have been used to finance crops other than cotton. \n\n6  The TA for  Farm Debt Resolution and Policy Reforms (TA 4052-TAJ) has recently completed a detailed study of \n\nthis issue. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix  2  \n\n27 \n \n\ntechniques. Independent dekhan farmers may seek advice and information from any source but \nthose linked to collective  dekhan  farms  have  few  options  to  pursue  information  and  extension \nadvice.  The  World  Bank  has  established  a  National  Agricultural  Training  Center,  and  trainees \nfrom the center have begun setting up extension services. Improving access to these services \ncould increase productivity by helping farmers to (i) improve crop yields, (ii) intensify their crop \nrotations, and (iii) diversify their cropping to achieve higher revenues. \n \n\n2. \n\nWater Management \n\n10.  Water resources management systems in Tajikistan have not changed significantly since \nthe  Soviet  period  but  as  agriculture  evolves  from  the  former  centrally  directed  model  to  one \nwhere farmers have greater freedom to manage resources these management systems are no \nlonger appropriate.  \n\n11.  Water  users\u2019  associations  (WUAs)  are  increasingly  providing  water  management  roles \nand  performing  on-farm  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M).  Under  the  old  Soviet  system,  the \ncollective  and  state  farms  acted  as  the  \"middlemen\"  between  the  large  government  ministries \nsupplying water and the field level application of water. With the breakup of the Soviet Union, \nthat link or connection between water supply and demand was broken, and there is now a large \ngap  (almost  a  black  hole)  between  the  \"big  water\"  suppliers  at  the  ministry,  and  the  \"small \nwater\"  users  at  the  field  level.  Farm  water  management  at  the  field  level  is  a  vital  part  of \nimproved irrigation management, but it is a neglected area in Tajikistan's irrigation systems. \n\n12. \nRehabilitation  of  irrigation  systems  is  linked  to  the  cost  of  maintaining  them.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  ability  to  support  the  cost  of  O&M  is  limited  and  irrigation  service  fees  were \ntherefore  introduced  in  1996.  Irrigation  service  fees  depend  on  the  volume  nominally  supplied \nand so depend on the crop grown. The tariff is currently TJS6 ($2) per 1,000 m3, although the \ngeneral  lack  of  measuring  and  metering  installations  precludes  the  proper  application  of \nvolumetric irrigation service fees.7  Irrigation service fees are uniform across the country and do \nnot  differentiate  between  gravity  and  pump  irrigation  schemes  even  though  energy  costs  in \npump irrigation schemes typically account for at least two thirds of total O&M costs. The water \nfees at the current level are almost sufficient to cover off-farm O&M costs, excluding the costs of \noperating and maintaining pump stations. In 2003, reported expenditures on off-farm O&M were \nabout $5 per ha, compared with an estimated requirement for gravity schemes of $5.6 per ha. \nThe total O&M costs for pumping, at the current electricity tariff, are about twice the total cost for \nthe  gravity  schemes.  Increasing  cost  recovery  through  water  fees  or  payment  in  kind  using \ncommunity labor is the only possible long-term solution for meeting O&M costs and sustaining \nthe irrigation system. \n \nC. \n \n\nSector Institutions \n\n1. \n\nLegal Basis \n\n13. \nThe  Water  Code  is  the  legal  basis  for  resource  management  at  present  but  requires \nrevision  to  accommodate  the  concept  of  basin-wide water resources management and water \nallocation across sectors. It also needs to be amended to recognize explicitly the role of water \nas an economic good. Although the Water Code provides for the formation of WUAs, it needs to \n\n                                                 \n7  In a number of locations, the MWRLR and its line offices have begun to introduce measuring devices on the tertiary \ndistribution system, for example in parts of the Asht-2 cascade. A Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation \n(SDC) project, Integrated Water Resources Management in Fergana Valley,  is also introducing measuring devices \nin pilot areas. \n\n. \n\n\f     Appendix  2 \n\n28 \n\nbe  updated  to  promote  and  safeguard  their  specific  requirements  through  the  incorporation  of \nappropriate legal provisions.8  \n \n\n2.  National Institutions \n\n14. \nThe  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and  Land  Reclamation  (MWRLR)  plays  a  key  role  in \nthe system of water resources administration of Tajikistan. In particular, it is responsible for the \nconstruction  and  O&M  of  irrigation  and  drainage  infrastructure,  and  river  regulation  works.  A \nnumber  of  other  agencies  also  hold  some  water  management  responsibilities,  with  monitoring \nand  water  management  for  energy  generation  being  key  areas  where  responsibilities  are \nshared.9 \n \nThe  fragmentation  of  responsibilities  in  the  water  resources  sector  and  a  lack  of \n15. \ncoordination  between  the  two  major  water  users  in  Tajikistan  limits  efficient  utilization  of \navailable water for both agriculture and power generation. To improve water resource utilization, \nthe Government needs to harmonize the conflicting water requirements of the major users. A \nriver  basin  or  watershed  management  approach  to  water  resources  utilization  has  generally \nbeen accepted by MWRLR as the most appropriate approach to water resources utilization and \nmanagement.  A  river  basin  management  approach  also  implies  an  institutional  framework, \nwhich would also redefine the role of MWRLR as either a bulk water supplier or as a regulatory \nauthority.10  \n \n16. \nThe responsibilities of the Ministry of Agriculture include the development of agriculture, \nensuring the efficiency of land use and the preservation of the quality of agricultural land. The \nministry develops cotton production targets and schedules for oblasts and raions, which provide \nthe basis for annual irrigation plans prepared at the farm level and approved by MWRLR and its \nregional  and  district  offices.  The  ministry  also  controls  the  transportation,  storage  and  use  of \nchemical fertilizers and herbicides for cotton production and determines the content of residual \nquantity of pesticides in water and soil. A major weakness in the sector is that there is no overall \nagricultural sector strategy and therefore a lack of direction in programs and activities. \n \n\n3. \n\nLocal Institutions \n\n17. \nAt  the  regional  and  district  levels,  MWRLR\u2019s  regional  (oblvodkhoz)  and  district \n(raivodkhoz) offices are responsible for the development and distribution of water resources and \nfor  the  construction  and  O&M  of  the  I&D  networks,  from  system  headworks  down  to  farm \nboundaries.  The  district  offices  make  agreements  with  farms  and  WUAs  for  the  delivery  of \nwater,  but  these  agreements  only  mention  the  volume  of  water  to  be  delivered  and  make  no \nreference to the timing of deliveries.  \n \nAt  the  district  level  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  is  represented  by  the  Department  of \n18. \nAgriculture  within  the  Hukumat  (administrative  offices)  and  the  first  deputy  of  the  Hukumat  is \nalways  responsible  for  agricultural  matters  within  the  local  administration.  The  role  of  the \n\n                                                 \n8  A detailed review of the legal and institutional aspects of water management in Tajikistan has been prepared by the \nTACIS/EuropeAid  funded  project  Aral  Sea  Water  Resources  Management  Project  (ASWERAM:  Project  30560: \nDevelopment of effective integrated water resources management in pilot sub-catchments of the Aral Sea basin). \n9  To  detail  the  provision  of  the  Water  Code,  the  Government  has  progressively  adopted  a  series  of  decisions \n(postanovlenye) calling, in turn, for ministerial orders (prekaz ) and instructions (instruktsia) for their implementation. \nA list of the water-related legislation in force is shown on Table 1.2, Supplementary Appendix L.  \n\n10 The  report  on  Farm  Debt  Resolution  and  Policy  Reforms  (TA  4052-TAJ) contains a comprehensive analysis of \nwater sector institutional issues. Annex 6 on Water Resources Management, Finances, and Institutions presents an \noverview of the sector, an analysis of existing institutions, and recommendations for institutional changes. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix  2  \n\n29 \n \n\ndepartment is essentially one of planning and coordination of production. It does not include, for \nexample,  any  extension  or  technical  service  for  crop  production.  Under  the  former  system, \ntechnical  inputs  were  provided  by  specialists  attached  to  the  sovkhozes and  kolkhozes or by \nresearch  institutes.  In  the  post-independence period, this system has collapsed and while the \nMinistry  of  Agriculture  retains  its  planning  and  managerial  function,  the  provision  of  technical \nservices to the sector has largely collapsed. \n \nD. \n\nSector Challenges  \n\n19. \nThe  principal  challenges  facing  the  agriculture  and  water  sectors  are  to  increase \nagricultural  production  to  benefit  all  farm  households  through  increased  farm  productivity, \ngreater  employment  opportunities,  higher  incomes,  and  increased  food  security.  Irrigation \ninfrastructure is a key element in the rural economy but has deteriorated extensively due to the \ncivil  conflict  and  the  lack  of  resources  for  adequate  O&M  and  investment.  Key  areas  for  the \nfuture are the O&M and sustainability of irrigation infrastructure, farmer participation in irrigation \nmanagement, the reduction of farm debt and increased access to credit, improved agricultural \nsupport  services,  and  an  incentive  structure  for  promoting  increased  production.  In  order  to \nprovide  the  resources  for  continuing  maintenance  of  the  irrigation  and  drainage  systems, \nappropriate  scales  of  payment  for  water  delivery  services  need  to  be  established,  and  regular \npayment of these fees assured. \n \n20. \nTA  linked  to  the  loan  will  provide  for  the  establishment  of  a  WUA  support  unit  within \nMWRLR and  the  institutionalization  of  water  user  groups  as  an  accepted  part  of  the  overall \nmanagement  of  water  resources.  The  TA  will  also  identify  measures  that  can  be  taken  to \nenhance  and  strengthen  the  role  of  the  private  sector  in  the  provision  of  input  and  output \nservices to the agriculture sector. \n \n21. \nThe Government has already made considerable progress toward the establishment of \nmore  sustainable  policies  for  land,  agriculture,  and  water  and  it  is  committed  to  furthering  this \nprocess  and  enhancing  the  performance  of  the  agriculture  and  water  sectors  to  improve \nincomes  and  reduce  rural  poverty.  The  Project  will  support  this  objective  through  the \nrehabilitation of essential irrigation infrastructure in five project areas.  \n\n22. \nThough  many  rural  institutions  are  weak,  there  is  wide  acknowledgement  from  both \ngovernment and development partners that change is needed, not least of which is the growing \nrealization that institutional strengthening must go hand in hand with physical rehabilitation. It is \nanticipated that WUAs will take on increasing importance in Tajikistan's farm water management \nand O&M. Likewise, village-based organizations developing potable water supply systems need \ninstitutional  strengthening,  to  ensure  long-term  O&M  and  financial  viability.  Agricultural \ninstitutions need to be refocused on the needs of the farmers, and providing services to farmers, \nrather than meeting the needs of larger external investors. The rural poor, especially vulnerable \ngroups  such  as  women,  also  require  institutional  support  and  active  participation  in  all  project \nactivities.  The  Project  will  explicitly  provide  institutional  capacity  building  in  these  sectors,  to \nensure the long-term institutional and financial viability of rural institutions. \n\n. \n\n\f     Appendix 3 \n\n30 \n\n \nProject \n\nMAJOR EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE RELATED TO AGRICULTURE SECTOR \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n\nFund \nSource \nWB \nWB \nWB \nWB \nWB \nWB \nWB \nWB \nWB \nWB \nWB \nWB \nWB \nWB \nWB \nWB \nWB \nWB \n \n \nADB \nADB \nADB \n\n5.0 \n50.0 \n12.0 \n10.0 \n10.0 \n50.0 \n5.0 \n6.7 \n20.0 \n6.7 \n2.0 \n0.5 \n20.0 \n3.1 \n50.0 \n13.8 \n10.0 \n20.0 \n295.0 \n \n40.0 \n5.0 \n3.6 \n\nInstitutional Building Technical Assistance Project \nAgriculture Recovery and Social Protection Credit \nPilot Poverty Alleviation Project \nPostconflict Rehabilitation Credit \nPostconflict Emergency Reconstruction Project \nStructural Adjustment Credit Project \nEmergency Flood Assistance Project \nStructural Adjustment Credit (Supplement) \nFarm Privatization Support Project \nInstitutional Building Technical Assistance Project (2) \nEmergency Flood Assistance Project (Supplement) \nLake Sarez Emergency Mitigation Project \nRural Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project \nEmergency Drought Assistance \nStructural Adjustment Credit Project (2) \nSecond Poverty Alleviation Project \nPamir Private Power Project \nCommunity Agriculture and Watershed Management Project \n                 Subtotal \n \nPostconflict Infrastructure Program \nEmergency Flood Rehabilitation Project \nEmergency Restoration of Yavan Water Conveyance \n   System Project \nAgriculture Rehabilitation Project \n                  Subtotal \nTajikistan Rural Poverty Reduction Project \n                  Subtotal \nFarm Privatization Support Project \nSeed Program Project \nReconstruction, Rehabilitation and Development Program \nFarmers\u2019 Irrigation Project \nDangara Valley Irrigation Project \nIrrigation Sector Improvement Project \nFarmer Ownership Model \nDevelopment of Effective Integrated Water Resources \nManagement (ASREWAM) \nWater User Association Program (Central Asia) \nNon-Project Grant funded Aid Program \nSEF SugdAgroServe/ Farmer Ownership Model \n                      Subtotal \n                       Total \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  EU  =  European  Union,  IDB  =  Islamic  Development  Bank,  IFC  = \nInternational  Finance  Corporation,  JFPR  =  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction,  UNDP  =  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme, USAID = United States Agency for International Development, WB = World Bank. \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n\nADB \n \nJFPR \n \nEU, USAID \nEU \nUNDP \nUSAID \nIDB \nUSAID  \nIFC \nEU \n\n35.0 \n83.6 \n2.9 \n2.9 \n1.1 \n11.0 \n13.5 \n1.5 \n20.0 \n2.5 \n0.25 \n \n\nUSAID  \nJapan \nIFC \n \n \n\n7.5 \n20.0 \n0.5 \n77.85 \n459.35 \n\nYear \n\n1996 \n1996 \n1997 \n1997 \n1998 \n1998 \n1998 \n1999 \n1999 \n1999 \n1999 \n2000 \n2000 \n2001 \n2001 \n2002 \n2002 \n2004 \n \n \n1998 \n1999 \n2001 \n\n2002 \n \n2000 \n \n1996 \n1996 \n1996 \n2000 \n2001 \n2002 \n2002 \n2003 \n\n2004 \n2001 \n2004 \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n31 \n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nThis  summary  initial  environmental  (SIEE)  examination  includes  an  assessment  of \n1. \nenvironmental benefits, adverse effects, and recommended mitigation and monitoring measures \nrelated to the Irrigation Rehabilitation Project in Tajikistan.  \n \nB. \n\nDescription of the Project \n\n2. \nThe objective of the Project is to increase the income of rural communities through: (i) \nprovision  of  reliable  irrigation  supplies  in  the  project  areas,  (ii)  improved  farm  productivity,  (iii) \nimproved access to safe water for targeted rural communities, and (iv) policy reforms supporting \nproject  implementation.  The  Project  will  be  located  in  five  districts  and  will  have  four \ncomponents:  (i) cost-effective  and  prioritized  rehabilitation  of \nirrigation  and  drainage \ninfrastructure and support to improve water management covering 47,000 hectares (ha) with a \nrural  beneficiary  population  of  246,000;  (ii) improvement  of  rural  water  supply  systems  for \n53,000 beneficiaries; (iii) support to farmers for improved agricultural development with on-farm \ndemonstrations covering 500 ha; and (iv) project management, monitoring, and evaluation. \n \nC. \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n3. \nThe  climate  of  Tajikistan  is  continental,  with  hot  summers  and  cold  winters.  Rainfall  is \nlow  and  occurs  mainly  in  winter  and  spring.  Lowland  project  areas  are  situated  on  sloping \nalluvial  outwash  fans  or  level  valley  floors  below  and  in-between  moderate  to  steeply  sloping \nmountains.  Soils  are  typically  silty  gray-brown  desert  soils  of  alluvial  origin  and  relatively  low \ninherent fertility. In some places loess (wind-blown) soils are irrigated; these are more fertile but \nsuffer from erosion where water is uncontrolled. Soil salinity is a problem in some locations due \nto high groundwater resulting from excess irrigation and/or poor drainage. One project area lies \nalong the Bartang river in the Pamirs, a tributary of the Panj river which forms the border with \nAfghanistan. Irrigation water supplies are all taken from surface water. Chemical water quality is \ngenerally good. Groundwater is fresh under the larger rivers, but can be saline elsewhere.  \n \n4. \nTajikistan\u2019s wide range of altitudes is home to a rich mixture of ecosystems and has rich \nbiodiversity,  however,  the  ecosystems  in  project  areas  have  been  extensively  modified  in  the \nlast 50 years.1 As a result, both terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity is considered to have been \nmuch reduced since the beginning of accelerated agricultural and industrial development in the \n1950s.  The  project  areas  are  now  commercial  agricultural  landscapes  comprising  cultivated \nfields, orchards and vineyards, mulberry and poplar plantations, roads, canals, drains, and built-\nup  areas  with  houses  and  gardens.  These  artificial  landscapes  provide  little  habitat  for \nendangered or threatened species. There are no protected areas within the project areas.  \n \n5. \nThe  project  areas  are  dependent  on  agriculture.  The  principal  crop  within  the  irrigation \nsystems is irrigated cotton. Most agricultural workers wages are extremely low and often unpaid \nor  made  in  kind  (cotton  stalks  for  winter  fuel).  Household  food  security  is  dependent  on \n\n                                                 \n1  This  is  due  to  large-scale  projects  for  irrigation,  especially  for  cotton,  hydroelectricity,  water  reservoirs,  mining, \nagricultural  expansion,  and  logging.  Industrial  pollution,  discharge  of  mining  wastes,  use  of  pesticides,  and  the \nconstruction of infrastructure for water resource development have had a particularly severe impact on aquatic and \nriparian  ecosystems.  The  protracted  civil  war  and  economic  problems  that  followed  independence  reduced \nindustrial  pollution  but  exacerbated  other  problems,  in  particular  uncontrolled  deforestation  for  fuelwood, \nagricultural expansion, hunting, and fires.  \n\n. \n\n\f     Appendix 4 \n\n32 \n\nhousehold  plots,  rain-fed  winter  wheat  on  former  rangeland,  limited  domestic  livestock,  and \nremittances  from  male  household  members  working  seasonally  in  Russia.  There  are  high \ndegrees  of  poverty  in  the  project  area,  whose  districts  have  all  been  classified  as  poor,  very \npoor, or extremely poor in a recent national survey.2 The rural poor eat an inadequate diet, have \ninsufficient income or production to provide food for all seasons, and have low stocks of food. \nMalnutrition is widespread.  \n \n6. \nPublic  health  in  the  project  areas  is  affected  by  both  agricultural  practices  and \nproblematic  drinking  water  supplies.  Food  insecurity  encourages  the  expansion  of  wet  rice \ncultivation  close  to  human  settlements,  which  provides  habitat  for  malaria-transmitting \nmosquitoes.  Most  piped  water  systems  have  fallen  into  disrepair.  Many  rural  households  now \ndepend on surface water, usually rivers or canals. This water is often of low bacteriological and \nchemical quality and, together with low levels of hygiene and high groundwater levels in human \nsettlements  that  adversely  affects  sanitation,  contributes  to  the  high  levels  of  communicable \ndisease, especially amongst children. \n \nD. \n\nPotential Env ironmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n7. \nEnvironmental  Benefits.  The  Project  will  have  significant  positive  environmental \nimpacts  primarily  through  arrested  land  degradation  due  to  salinity  buildup  and  soil  erosion  in \nirrigated  areas,  and  providing  rural  water  supply  in  the  project  areas.3  The  improvement  of \nintake  structures,  construction  of  sedimentation  basins,  and  provision  of  sediment  handling \nequipment will reduce sediment entering the systems by 70%. The repair of canal lining and key \ncontrol  structures,  and  the  desilting  of  canals  will  result  in  restoration  of  canal  capacity  and  a \nreduction in water losses thereby improving water availability. The revegetation of sand dunes \nwill  prevent  the  deposition  of  saline  wind-blown  sand  on  pressure  pipes.  Desilting  drains  will \nimprove  the  drainage  system  reducing  waterlogging  and  secondary  soil  salinization.  The \nproblem of waterlogging affects not only agricultural areas but also human settlements resulting \nin higher groundwater, which adversely affects sanitation and causes public health problems.  \n \n8. \nThe Project will support sustainable agricultural development including the promotion of \nintegrated pest management. The Project will also support the establishment of on-farm water \nmanagement  demonstration  sites  in  each  project  area.  These  will  promote  the  use  of \ntechniques  such  as  land  leveling  and  precise  irrigation  applications,  thus  promoting  improved \nwater  use  efficiency.  Through  the  provision  of  safe  water  supply  to  rural  communities,  the \nProject is expected to result in significant positive impacts on public health, household workload, \nand quality of rural life. Significant positive impacts on agricultural development and productivity, \nrural incomes, institutional development, public health, and soil and water resources, brought by \nthe Project will enhance net environmental benefits. \n \nEnvironmental  Issues  Related  to  Project  Location.  The  Project  will  rehabilitate \n9. \nexisting systems for irrigation water supply, which are based on diversion of river flows. There \nwill  be  no  additional  abstraction  above  preexisting  levels  except  on  one  mountain  stream  and \ntherefore no change in river hydrology. The quality and volume of return flows are not expected \nto change measurably within the lifetime of the Project.4 The Project has been designed to avoid \n                                                 \n2  National Social Investment Fund for Tajikistan (NSIFT). 2002.

Resettlement  impacts,  if  any,  will  be  addressed  through  a \nshort resettlement plan in accordance with government regulations and approval procedures, as \nwell as Asian Development Bank (ADB) safeguard policies. \n \n10. \nThe  settling  basins  proposed  for  rehabilitation  and  construction  at  canal  intakes  along \nthe  Panj  river  are  adjacent  to  wetlands  in  controlled  zones  along  the  border  with  Afghanistan. \nMeasures  will  be  undertaken  to  minimize  impacts  on  wetland  habitats  during  construction. In \nRushon, Farkhor, and Panj districts irrigated areas are subject to bank erosion along the Panj \nriver.  The  Ministry  of  Emergency  Situations  and  Civil  Defense  is  undertaking  bank  protection \nworks in some of these areas. In Sughd region, gravity water supply to the eastern parts of the \nAsht  irrigation  scheme  adjacent  to  the  project  areas  is  reported  to  be  affected  by  inadequate \nirrigation releases from Uzbekistan despite an international water-sharing agreement. Improved \ncooperation should be sought. In Khatlon region, water is taken from the Panj river, which forms \nthe border with Afghanistan\u2014no additional diversion is considered and the status quo will not be \naltered by the Project. \n \n11. \nAll drinking water supplies will be from springs or groundwater. Water abstraction will be \nsmall scale and will not significantly affect local rivers or aquifers. All centralized water supplies \nwill be disinfected to avoid impacts from poor water quality. The Project will not cause conflicts \nin water use. \n \n12. \nEnvironmental  Issues  Related  to  Project  Design. The project areas rely on surface \nwater  diversion  for  irrigation  water  supply.  Major  design  issues  are  (i) management  of  flood \nflows  at  intakes,  (ii) capture  of  water  during  low  flows,  and  (iii) high  levels  of  suspended \nsediment. Project investments will be designed to resist flooding and erosion, and to cope with \nhigh  sediment  levels  and  variable  flows.  High  sediment  levels  are  a  major  burden  on \nmaintenance budgets, but can be reduced by providing settling basins at the main intakes. The \nProject  will  ensure  that  these  structures  are  properly  designed  and  will  provide  training  to \nensure efficient operation. Projected return flows from the settling basins and from drainage will \nnot  significantly  alter  downstream  water  quality  either  in  terms  of  mineralization  or  sediment. \nThe  Project  will  assist  in  minimizing  irrigation  water  supply  conflicts  by  supporting  the \ndevelopment  of  government  capacity  to  promote  water  users\u2019  associations  (WUAs),  by \nimproving  the  reliability  of  the  supply  and  by  setting  up  on-farm  water  management \ndemonstration areas to promote increased water use efficiency. \n \nConsistent  with  the  provisions  of  the  Water  Code  and  associated  decree  number  437 \n13. \nissued in 2002, the Project will ensure that measures are undertaken to ensure adverse effects \non  fish  resources  are  mitigated.  Of  particular  relevance  to  this  is  the  proposed  weir  on  the \nKofarnihon  river,  where  possible  negative  impacts  on  upstream  fish  movement  has  been \nidentified. The initial environmental examination (IEE) proposes a further study and integrate in \nthe  Project  the  measures  to  avoid  fish  entrainment  in  intakes  and  pumps,  if  necessary.  The \nproposed study has been included in the terms of reference for consulting services, and will be \nconducted jointly with the Ministry of Water Resources and Land Reclamation (MWRLR) during \nthe  initial  state  of  project  implementation.  It  will  recommend  appropriate mitigation measures \nproposing a fixed schedule for their implementation, and will be a precondition to the start of any \nrelated construction activity. \n \nThe  Project  will  promote  improved  seed  production,  multiplication,  and  distribution. \n14. \nThese activities will not affect the limited existing agrobiodiversity or wild diversity. Tajikistan is \ndeveloping  policies  and  capacity  in  relation  to  genetically-modified  organisms  following  its \n\n. \n\n\f     Appendix 4 \n\n34 \n\naccession to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety of the Convention on Biological Diversity. The \nProject will operate in accordance with the Protocol.  \n \n15. \nEnvironmental  Issues  Related  to  Construction  Stage.  The  Project  will  not  involve \nextensive earthworks on sloping ground, and is not expected to create erosion hazards. Existing \ngullying  in  Vahdat  district  will  be  dealt  with  through  structural  and  vegetative  measures. \nSediment  from  desilting  operations  in  channels  is  nontoxic  and  will  be  disposed  of  in  fields  or \nother  approved  sites.  All  work  in  or  near  rivers  will  be  carefully  controlled  to  avoid  localized \npollution  from  waste  oils  and  spills  of  diesel.  Work  near  the  Panj  river  will  require  security \nclearance  from  the  border  security  force  and  formal  confirmation  from  Russian  military \nauthorities that the areas are clear of mines. \n \nHealth,  safety,  and  environmental  management  standards  during  construction  will  be \n16. \nimproved by developing and enforcing relevant contract clauses. In addition to controlling solid \nand  liquid  waste  disposal  and  site  environmental  management  especially  dust,  these  clauses \nwill  include  a  requirement  for  testing  oils  for  polychlorinated  biphenyls  (PCBs)  from  any \ntransformers  removed  from  service,  and  their  proper  disposal.  Careful  attention  will  also  be \ngiven  to  transparency  in  tendering  and  payment  procedures  and  effective  supervision  on  site. \nThe Project will also provide testing kits to local units of the Sanitary-Epidemiological Station to \nsupport drinking water source approval functions. \n \n17. \nEnvironmental  Issues  Related  to  Project  Operation. Flood damage to canal intakes \nwill be reduced by appropriate intake strengthening and design. Siltation of canals and sediment \ndamage to pumps will be reduced by providing settling basins. Silt from settling basins will either \nbe  disposed  of  to  waste  land  or  flushed  back  to  the  main  rivers.  No  significant  impacts  are \nexpected. Reduced siltation of canals will permit diversion of maintenance funds to desilting of \ndrainage  channels,  reducing  groundwater  levels  and  thereby  reducing  secondary  salinization. \nPesticide  and  fertilizer  use  may  increase  if  agricultural  incomes  rise;  the  Project  will  train \nfarmers  in  integrated  pest  management  techniques  and  no  significant  negative  impacts  are \nexpected.  \n \n18. \nrecommended mitigation measures, excluding consulting services. \n \nE. \n\nA  total  of  $112,000  or  0.4%  of  total  project  costs  will  be  invested  for  implementing  the \n\nEnvironmental Monitoring Program and Institutional Requirements  \n\nA  monitoring  and  evaluation  unit  (MEU)  will  be  established  within  the  project \n19. \nmanagement  office  (PMO)  to  monitor  project  implementation,  performance,  and  impacts. \nConsultants will be engaged to provide further assessment of environmental impacts of project \ncomponents,  evaluate  environmental  monitoring  requirements,  and  prepare  a  long-term \nenvironmental monitoring program for the Project.5  \n\n                                                 \n5  The environmental monitoring program will have two components: environmental compliance monitoring focusing \non ensuring that physical investments are carried out in accordance with relevant clauses in contract documents \nand Government regulations; and environmental performance monitoring. Environmental performance monitoring \nwill  cover:  (i) key  variables  on  each  irrigation  scheme  (irrigation  water  quality,  drainage  water  quality,  depth  to \ngroundwater,  and  soil  quality);  (ii) health,  gender  and  other  social  impacts;  and  (iii) public involvement (through \ninput of local information by the WUAs and water supply committees). Additional consultants inputs of 2 person-\nmonths international and 4 person-months domestic, will reduce the risk of under-performance of environmental \nmonitoring and evaluation. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n35 \n\nIt  is  recognized  that  it  will  be  difficult  to  completely  resolve  the  issues  with  respect  to \n20. \nfisheries in the short term. However, as the precautionary principle states, \u201clack of full scientific \ncertainty  will  not  be  used  as  a  reason  for  postponing  cost-effective  measures  to  prevent \nenvironmental degradation.\u201d  The IEE proposes to conduct further study on the fisheries issues.  \nThe  completion  of  this  study,  which  will  become  an  integral  part  of  the  detailed  design,  with \nrecommendations  on  appropriate  mitigation  measures,  will  become  a  precondition  to  start  of \nany related construction activities.  Consultants\u2019 inputs will be provided to assist in planning and \nexecuting  the  required  fisheries  studies,  and  consequent  measures  to  be  adopted.  Detailed \nterms of reference6, budget and an implementation schedule have been prepared.  \n\nto \n\ntraining \n\nPublic Consultation and Information Disclosure \n\n21. \nFor  sustainability,  the  Project\u2019s  environmental  monitoring  program  should  be  based  on \nmaking maximum use of existing institutions and building on  directly relevant initiatives such as \nthose undertaken under the Agriculture Rehabilitation Project (ARP). The ARP is supporting the \nState  Committee  for  Nature  Protection  and  Forestry  (SCNPF)  with  about  $100,000  to  ensure \nregular  monitoring  of  environmental  impacts  and  mitigation  measures.  In  addition,  ADB  has \nassisted the SCNPF with a 12-month institutional strengthening TA7 which included the supply \nof  field  monitoring  equipment.  The  World  Bank  Rural  Infrastructure  Rehabilitation  Project  has \nsupplied  equipment  and \nlaboratory  of  MWRLR\u2019s  specialized \nthe  central \nHydrogeological Amelioration Expedition for monitoring irrigation and drainage water quality.8  \n \nF. \n \n22. \nA  significant  level  of  public  consultation  was  undertaken  during  project  preparation. \nStakeholders at the central, regional, district, and project area levels were identified. Fieldwork \nfor  poverty  and  social  analysis  sought  the  opinion  of  stakeholders  including  the  conduct  of  a \nlarge  number  of  village-  and  farm-level  interviews.  A  household  survey  was  undertaken \ninvolving 200 respondents. Meetings were conducted with concerned government agencies at \nall administrative levels. Interviews were held with nongovernment organizations and farmers to \ncollect  data  and  identify  local  issues  and  priorities.  A  stakeholder  workshop  was  held  in \nDushanbe in July 2004 to obtain feedback on the proposals in the interim report and assist final \ndesign.  All  consultations  supported  the  project  interventions,  which  match  clear  district-level \npriorities.  The  stakeholder  workshop  was  followed  by  meetings  with  the  SCNPF  to  elicit  their \ncomments on the IEE and to ensure that the Project followed the environmental regulations of \nTajikistan.  During  project  implementation,  public  participation  will  be  channeled  through  the \nWUAs and water supply committees. \n \nG. \n \n23. \nThe  Project  will  have  significant  positive  environmental  impacts,  primarily  through \narrested land degradation that has been caused by salinity buildup and soil erosion in irrigated \nareas,  and  through  providing  rural  water  supply  in  the  project  areas\u2014major  environmental \nissues  in  Tajikistan.  Findings  show  that  the  Project  will  have  no  significant  adverse \nenvironmental  impacts.  Sufficient  mitigation  measures,  and  environmental  management  and \nmonitoring  integrated  into  project  design  and  cost,  will  address  the  small  impacts  identified.  A \nfull-scale environmental impact assessment is not required. \n\nFindings and Conclusions \n\n                                                 \n6   The detailed terms of reference for consulting services  is in Supplementary Appendix G. \n7  ADB. 2000.

The  TA  for  the \nalternative business providers will focus on (i) analyzing the strengths and limitations of existing \nbusiness  providers  beyond  the  services  offered  by  the  traditional  investors;1 and (ii) providing \ncapacity  building  for  selected  provider(s)  to  expand  their  services  to  private  farmers  in  the \nproject  areas.  The  TA  support  for  the  WUAs  support  unit  will  focus  on  (i) defining  the  unit\u2019s \nmandate,  organizational  structure,  functions,  staffing  pattern,  and  legal  status;  (ii) the \ndevelopment of guidelines for WUA formation and support within the country; and (iii) providing \ninstitutional strengthening to ensure that the support unit can properly operate in a sustainable \nmanner.  \n \nThe  TA  is  divided  into  two  phases:  the  preparation  and  the  capacity-building phases. \n3. \nThe outcome is that the farmers in the project areas will receive better service from providers of \nirrigation and drainage, and be more able to manage their own farms effectively. \n \nB. \n\nConsultants \n\n4. \nThe  TA  will  require  a  total  input  of  12  person-months  of  international  and  37  person-\nmonths  of  domestic  consultants.  The  following  breakdown  of  the  consultants  is  indicative  and \nsubject to revision at consultant selection stage, allowing one specialist to cater for more than \none position (person-months are given in parentheses). The international consultant inputs will \ninclude an agricultural economist/team leader (7), an irrigation institutions specialist (3), and a \nsmall business development/credit specialist (2). The domestic consultancy inputs will comprise \na  legal  specialist  (3),  a  WUA  specialist  (6),  an  irrigation  specialist  (4),  a  financial \nmanagement/credit  specialist  (6),  an  agricultural  economist  (3),  a  monitoring  and  evaluation \nspecialist (12), and a public awareness specialist (3).   \n \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  engage,  through  a  suitably  qualified  firm, \n5. \ninternational  consultants  with  domestic  associates,  to  provide services in accordance with the \nterms of reference following the  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.2  The  consultants  will  be \nrequired  to  work  closely  with  MWRLR  and  other  key  stakeholders.  The  other  government \ninstitutions that might participate in TA implementation include the National Bank of Tajikistan, \nMinistry  of  Agriculture,  Ministry  of  Economics  and  Trade,  and  Ministry  of  Justice.  The \n                                                 \n1  Traditional  investors  are  local  traders/exporters  who  provide  seasonal  credit,  mostly  in  kind,  to  farmers  using \n\nfarming products, mainly cotton, as collateral.  \n\n2  Simplified technical proposals and ADB's quality- and cost-based selection system will be used for the selection of \n\ncons ultants.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8          43 \n \n\nconsultants  will  also  interact  with  the  ADB-financed  Agricultural  Rehabilitation  Project,  and \nrelevant ongoing projects of other international agencies. Intensive consultations should also be \nconducted  with  civil  society  organizations  such  as  the  Cooperative  for  Assistance  and  Relief \nEverywhere  (CARE)  International,  Agence  d'Aide  \u00e0  la  Coop\u00e9ration  Technique  et  au \nD\u00e9veloppement  (ACTED),  Aga  Khan  Foundation,  and  private  sector  organizations,  such  as \nTojiksogirot Bank, First Microfinance Bank, farmers, WUAs, and traders.  \n \nC. \n\nDescription of Tasks \n\n1. \n\nPhase I: Needs Assessment, Analysis, and Preparatory Activities  \n\na. \n\nSelection of Alternative Business Providers  \n\nThe consultants will undertake the following tasks: \n\n6. \n \n\n(i)  Assess  marketing  channels  and  value  added  chains  of  key  farming  inputs  and \n\nproducts, and assess the input delivery systems in the project areas;

In general,  comparisons of costs and  benefits in the \nanalysis  of  projects  are  made  on  the  basis  of  quantifiable  physical  inputs  and  outputs. \nIncremental net benefits are estimated, where possible, on the basis of the changes expected to \noccur  and  other  conditions  expected  to  prevail  within  targeted  geographic  areas  (i) in  the \nabsence of the proposed Project\u2019s interventions, and (ii) as a consequence of implementing the \nproposed  interventions.  For  the  economic  analysis,  these  quantifiable  inputs  and  outputs  are \nvalued according to their border  price equivalents. For the financial analysis, established prices \nare applied as determined by local markets.  \n \n2. \nThe  principal  objective  of  the  economic  analysis  is  to  establish  whether  proposed \ninvestments are profitable for the economy as a whole, determined when the net present value \n(NPV) of costs and benefits are positive when discounted at the opportunity cost of capital. \n \n3. \nThe project has four principal components, which are: (i)  rehabilitation  of  irrigation  and \ndrainage  infrastructure,  (ii)  support  for  agricultural  development,  (iii)  improvement  of  potable \nwater supply systems, and (iv) project management. \n \n4. \nThe  Rehabilitation  of  Irrigation  and  Drainage  Infrastructure  component  includes \nrehabilitation  of  both  pump  stations  and  of  headworks,  canal  structures, and other civil works. \nWithin the component there are five subcomponents for the districts of Asht, Vahdat, Farkhor, \nPanj,  and  Rushon.  Each  district  subcomponent  has  been  assessed  separately  and  then \ncombined to give an assessment for the whole project. The costs of the Support for Agricultural \nDevelopment are prorated for the overall project options according to the investment in irrigation \nand drainage in each district. The costs of Project Management are split evenly among the five \nsubcomponents. \n \n5. \nEconomic  analysis  for  the  Improvement  of  Potable  Water  Supply  Systems  has  been \ncarried out separately using the time-savings method recently developed by the Economics and \nResearch  Department  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  the  analysis  of  rural  water \nsupply  systems.  This  method  compares  time  savings  with  the  annualized  capital  costs  and \noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  of  each  system  to  determine  whether  the  minimum \nrequirement of positive NPV at the opportunity cost of capital is met. It does not calculate actual \nNPV  or  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR).  All  five  water  supply  schemes  have  results \nconsistent  with  EIRR  greater  than  12%.  The  costs  and  benefits  of  this  component  are  not \nincluded in the assessment of the overall Project. \n \nB. \n\n Areas, Cropping Pattern, and Yields \n\n6. \nThe total project area, in the five districts, is 47,500 hectares (ha) of irrigated land, with \nan  estimated  262,000  beneficiaries.  The  two  major  crops,  cotton  and  wheat,  are  planted  on \nabout  50%  and  21%  of  the  area.  The  remaining  area  is  planted  with  fruit,  vegetables,  and \nfodder.  Orchards  are  particularly  important  in  Asht  district  and  in  the  upper  part  of  the  Asht-1 \ncascade are the dominant crop, occupying about 75% of the area. Present average yields vary \namong the districts, from 1.2 tons (t)/ha for cotton in Asht to 2.0 t/ha in Panj. For wheat, average \nyields vary from 1.6 t/ha in Asht to 3.1 t/ha in Farkhor. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix  9          49 \n\nThe quality of seed available to farmers, especially for the major crops, is generally of a \n7. \nlow  standard  with  the  result  that  yields  are  lower  than  could  be  achieved  if  seed  of  higher \nperforming  varieties  were  more  widely  available.  Increasing  the  supply  of  higher  quality  seed \ncan  have  significant  benefits  for  farmers.  Crop  pests  and  diseases  are  also  widespread,  with \nsimilar negative impacts on crop output.  \n \n8. \nDouble  cropping  is  not  widespread  in  Tajikistan,  although  there  is  some  scope  for  it  in \nlocations where a short cycle vegetable or fodder crop can follow wheat or an early vegetable \ncrop. The potential and practical possibilities for intensifying and diversifying crop production will \nbe  demonstrated  in  the  crop  production  program  in  the  core  demonstration  areas.  Gradual \nadoption of these methods, supported by expanding domestic markets as the economy grows, \nwill lead to an increase in cropping intensity. \n \nC. \n\n Major Assumptions \n\n9. \nEconomic  and  financial  prices  for  traded  goods  (wheat  and  cotton  and  nitrogen, \nphosphorous  and  potassium  fertilizers)  are  derived  from  World  Bank  commodity  price \nprojections  for  the  years  up  to  2015.  Prices  are  adjusted  to  2004  constant  prices  using  the \nmanufacturing unit values index and are adjusted for insurance, freight, and handling to derive \nborder  prices.  The  border  prices  are  adjusted  by  the  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  and  by \ndeductions  for  local  transport,  storage,  handling,  and  processing  costs  (where  appropriate)  to \nobtain estimated farm-gate prices and are converted to somoni at the official exchange rate.  \n \n10. \nPrices  for  nontraded  agricultural  inputs  and  outputs  are  based  on  2004  prices in the \nproject  districts.  A  combination  of  official  sources,  data  from  farms  in  each  district  and  market \nprices,  adjusted  to  allow  for  transport  and  traders\u2019  margins,  have  been  used.  Machinery  costs \nhave  been  based  on  current  data  from  farms  in  each  district  for  the  principal  mechanized \nactivities.  Taxes  on  land  and  wages  have  been  applied  at  the  current  rates  in  the  financial \nanalysis of farm budgets. \n \n11. \nDaily  wage  rates  for  each  district  have  been  calculated  based  on  data  from  farms  in \neach  district.  This  data  generally  implies  different  daily  rates  for  each  crop,  but  in  order  to \nsimplify  the  analysis,  a  single  average  rate  has  been  estimated  and  applied  for  each  district. \nThese rates vary from TJS1.00 per day in Rushon to TJS1.50 per day in Asht and Vahdat.  \n \n12. \nThe  cost  of  pumping  water  to  farms  in  the  Asht  and  Farkhor  pump  irrigation  areas  is \ndirectly  proportional  to  the  cost  of  electricity.  The  financial  price  used  in  the  analysis  is  TJS \n0.012/kilowatt-hour (kWh) which is the current price applying for the water sector. The economic \nprice  adopted  for  this  project  is  the  long-run  marginal  cost  of  electricity  of  $0.021/kWh  (TJS \n0.063/kWh).1 \n \n13. \nThe  analysis  is  in  2004  constant  prices.  An  exchange  rate  of  $1=  TJS3.00  has  been \nused,  the  discount  rate  is  12%,  and  the  project  life  is  25  years.  The  shadow  exchange  rate \nfactor is 1.11, which is the value generally accepted for use in Tajikistan and is consistent with \nthe general level of tariffs in force and with other factors affecting domestic prices. Domestic and \nnontraded goods are valued at their local market rates. The shadow wage rate factor for rural \nlabor  is  0.80,  which  reflects  the  high  levels  of  unemployment  and  underemployment  currently \nfound in rural areas of Tajikistan.  \n\n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 2004.

The level of \nbenefits accruing varies among the districts, with the main differences occurring between pump \nand gravity-fed areas: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nwith rehabilitation of pump stations, the water supply to farms will be assured and \nthe risk of supply failure reduced or eliminated; the security of supply will reduce \nthe  potential  for  stress  during  critical  growth  periods  and  encourage  farmers  to \nincrease investment in production; \nwithout  rehabilitation,  the  pump  stations  would  continue  in  operation  for  some \ntime\u2014perhaps  10  years  or  more\u2014but  would  experience  a  gradual  decline  in \nefficiency and in the volumes of water supplied to the canals as they age further; \nrehabilitation  of  headworks,  canals,  and  canal  structures  in  areas  supplied  by \ngravity will also improve the reliability and timeliness of supply and will reduce the \nrisk of stress at critical periods of plant growth; and \nwithout  rehabilitation  of  these  structures,  the  supply  of  water  to  farms  will \ngradually  be  less  reliable  and  the  volumes  supplied  may  decline.  In  gravity-fed \nareas, the decline will be less than in pump irrigation areas and the risk of total \nfailure of supply is minimal. \n\n \n15. \nThe  Project  supports  the  expansion  of  the  supply  of  high  quality  seed  available  to \nfarmers  and  will  introduce  a  training  program  in  integrated  pest  management.  Both  of  these \nprograms will have a positive impact on crop yields and agricultural production. \n \n16. \nRehabilitation  of  the  pumping  cascades  results  in  energy  savings  in  Asht  and Farkhor \ndistricts. Significant energy saving benefits also arise from the conversion of the upper parts of \nthe Asht-1 cascade to gravity supply through the diversion of the Pongaz-Say river. \n \nE. \n\n Economic Internal Rate of Return \n\n17. \nThe EIRR for the Project is 20.7% with an NPV of $9.9 million. The EIRR and NPV for \nthe  district  subprojects  are  shown  in  Table  A9.1.  All  the  district  subprojects  have  acceptable \nEIRRs well above 12%.  \n \n\nTable A9.1:  Net Present Value and Economic Internal Rate of Return \n\nSubproject \n\nNPV ($\u2019000) \n\nEIRR (%) \n\nAsht \nFarkhor \nPanj \nRushon \nVahdat \n     Project Total \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n1,324 \n5,254 \n1,779 \n117 \n1,407 \n9,880 \n\n16.2 \n26.1 \n19.3 \n13.5 \n23.3 \n20.7 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix  9          51 \n\nF. \n\n Sensitivity Analysis \n\n18. \nThe results of the sensitivity analysis for the Project are shown in Table A9.2.

Delays in project implementation and \nconsequent  delays  in  achieving  benefits  would  be  the  most  likely  source  of  a  threat  to  the \nProject\u2019s overall economic viability. \n \nG. \n\n Financial Analysis: Farm Budgets \n\n20. \nBased on the models developed to assess the project, farm budgets were estimated for \nlarge farms, dekhan farms, and household plots, for each district. These allow the impact of the \nProject  on  the  different  types  of  farms  to  be  evaluated.  There  are  still  many  large  farms \noperating in these districts, but the Government is committed to phasing them out within several \nyears and replacing them with individual  dekhan farms. The expected impact of the Project on \ndekhan farms and household plots is therefore important. \n \nAs shown in Table A9.3, the dekhan farms all show increases in income with the Project, \n21. \nwith the largest proportional increases in Asht where current yields for cotton and wheat are low \ncompared  with  other  districts.  The  smallest  expected increases in  dekhan farm income are in \nthe  gravity-fed  parts  of  the  Farkhor  system,  but  these  and  other  gravity-fed  areas  are  less \nvulnerable than the pump irrigation areas to fall in income without the Project.  \n \n22. \nThe  Project  will  also  have  a  positive  impact  on  production  from  household  plots  in  all \nareas,  with  the  increase  after  7  years  ranging  from  20%  in  the  Farkhor  gravity-fed  areas  to \naround 30% in the pump irrigation areas of Asht and Farkhor because of the expected greater \nimpact  of  the  Project  on  water  supply  in  the  pumped  areas.  These  increases  are  important \nbecause many rural households depend upon the production of these plots to supplement food \nsupplies and, to a lesser extent, household income as indicated in Table A9.4. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n\n \n\nDistrict \n\nAsht-1\u2014upper area \nAsht-1\u2014lower area \nVahdat \nFarkhor\u2014pump area \nFarkhor\u2014gravity area \nPanj \nRushon \n   ha = hectare. \n   Note: Pumping cost of water not included. \n   Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n16.6 \n16.6 \n5.0 \n69.0 \n69.0 \n22.0 \n44.0 \n\nTable A9.3: Farm Net Income \u2014Dekhan Farms \n(TJS, 2004 constant prices) \n\nArea  \n(ha) \n\nPresent \n\nFuture with Project \n\nFuture without \nProject \n\nYear 5 \n\nYear 10 \n\nYear 5 \n\nYear 10 \n\n692 \n(-124) \n2,171 \n20,959 \n20,959 \n12,906 \n28,074 \n\n2,182 \n2,676 \n3,032 \n31,257 \n30,103 \n15,209 \n37,324 \n\n2,613 \n2,844 \n3,241 \n37,138 \n35,157 \n16,620 \n41,356 \n\n233 \n(-705) \n2,394 \n17,091 \n22,896 \n13,576 \n26,948 \n\n-328 \n(-1,899) \n2,376 \n9,937 \n22,265 \n13,151 \n25,080 \n\nTable A9.4:   Farm Net Income \u2014Household Plots \n(TJS, 2004 constant prices) \n \n\nDistrict \n\nArea  \n(ha) \n\nPresent \n\nFuture with Project \n\nFuture without \nProject \n\nYear 5 \n\nYear 10 \n\nYear 5 \n\nYear 10 \n\nAsht-1\u2014upper area \nAsht-1\u2014lower area \nVahdat \nFarkhor\u2014pump area \nFarkhor\u2014gravity area \nPanj \nRushon \n   ha = hectare. \n   Note: Pumping cost of water not included. \n   Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n0.18 \n0.18 \n0.13 \n0.09 \n0.09 \n0.22 \n0.05 \n\n133 \n119 \n185 \n83 \n83 \n173 \n128 \n\n \n\n172 \n158 \n221 \n111 \n101 \n198 \n159 \n\n188 \n181 \n243 \n133 \n115 \n214 \n176 \n\n116 \n99 \n185 \n68 \n80 \n128 \n117 \n\n96 \n81 \n185 \n51 \n76 \n128 \n108 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 10         53 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \n\nA. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\n \nIs the sector identified as a national priority \nin country poverty analysis?   \n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Tajikistan: \n\n \nGrowth  in  Tajikistan\u2019s  agriculture  sector,  and  the  cotton  subsector  in  particular,  would  play  a  crucial  role  in  poverty \nreduction. In 2002, the agriculture sector contributed 26% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) and two thirds of \nits  labor  force  (World  Bank,  2004,  Tajikistan  Poverty  Assessment  Update,  draft,  page  19).  The  cotton  subsector,  which \nsupported three fourths of the country\u2019s farm households and occupied the same share of its farmlands, accounted for 30% \nof Tajikistan\u2019s export revenues (ibid).  \n \nAlthough there is no official definition of poverty line in the country, recent available statistics indicate that income poverty in \nTajikistan is widespread and severe in the countryside, especially in the cotton-growing areas. If defined according to the \nState  Statistical  Agency  (SSA)  minimum  food  basket  benchmark  of  Tajik  Somoni  20  per  person  per  month,  the  poverty \nincidence of the country in 1999 was 83%; this declined to 67% in 2003 (ibid, page 3). The World Bank study, which used a \npoverty threshold of $2.15 per person per day, at 2000 purchasing power parity (PPP), also showed a decreasing (albeit \nhigh)  trend\u2014from  81%  in  1999  down  to  64%  in  2003.  Poverty  was  more  prevalent  in  rural  areas  where  65%  of  its \nhouseholds were poor (using the $2.15 per day poverty line definition), compared with 59% in the urban centers. Khatlon \nand Sughd regions, which produced 85% of the country\u2019s cotton and home to 65% of the country\u2019s population, accounted \nfor 76% of the total poor households and 72% of the total extremely poor households (using $1 per person per day at 2000 \nPPP). The rural poor consisted mainly of agricultural workers, especially on cotton farms, families with many children, the \nelderly,  the  sick  and  invalids,  and  women  (especially  female-headed  households).  Labor  income  remained  the  most \nimportant  income  source  for  all  households  (at  45%  of  total  household  income),  followed  by  the  imputed  value  of  food \nproduced at home and gifts of foodstuffs (24%) (ibid, Annex 1). Consumption expenses grew even for the poor households \nin 2003. As expected, the share of total household expenditure on food for the bottom 20% of the income decile was higher \n(71\u201373% of all expenditure on food) than the top 20% (62%). Interestingly, the share of the imputed consumption value of \nhome food-produced to total food expenditures was much lower for all household incomes levels when compared with its \nshare in 1999. More than half of food expenditures for all household income groups were purchased from the market. The \nmajor reason for the lower share of home food consumption was because food from the garden plots was becoming less \nsufficient  to  support  a  family  due  to  declining  productivity  of  these  plots.  While  access  to  food  from  markets  may  have \nimproved,  the  purchasing  power  especially  of  the  bottom  20%  was  nevertheless  still  insufficient  so  that  various  coping \nmechanisms  (like  selling  household  assets,  sending  children  to  relatives,  etc.) were employed. The most disturbing fact \nfrom a nutritional viewpoint was that more than half of the poorest households ate an average of one meal or less a day.  \n\n \nWhile  high  and  continued  positive  economic  growth  in  the  past  years  (averaging  8%  per  annum )  particularly  from  the \nagriculture sector, has contributed to poverty reduction (as indicated by the poverty reduction elasticity of 1.08), the benefits \nto the rural poor were uneven. Khatlon and Sughd, which recorded the highest per capita GDP growth rates in 2003, had \nstill  the  largest  proportion  of  poor  households.  The  major  reason  for  the  high  GDP  growth  rates  in  the  cotton-growing \nregions was the increase in the world price of cotton. For growth to have a more lasting impact on poverty in the cotton \nsubsector, structural reforms would be required that would essentially improve the profitability of cotton farms.  \n \nIt should be stressed that poverty in Tajikistan is also nonincome based, characterized by a worsening human development \nsituation due to lack of essential services, and increasing economic and social disparities that particularly affect women. A \nkey  element  of  nonincome-based  poverty  is  the  lack  of  clean  drinking  water  in  rural  Tajikistan.  The  Poverty  Reduction \nStrategy Paper (PRSP) of 2003 reported that only 40% of Tajikistan's population used piped water at home or outdoors. \nLimited access to potable water has a tremendous impact on poverty, including work-days lost due to illness and time spent \ntransporting water from long distances. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                      Targeting Classification:  Targeted Intervention  \n \nThough poverty statistics countrywide indicate that the incidence of poverty is decreasing, most villagers in the Project\u2019s \ncotton-growing  areas  think  otherwise.  During  stakeholder  meetings,  villagers  who  participated  in  the  self-rating poverty \nassessments  said  that  the  income  structure  has  not  changed  and  that  poor  households  in  their  villages  constitute \napproximately  75%  of  all  households ,  middle  about  15%,  and  rich  10%.  Local  villagers  typically  described  the  poor  or \nvulnerable  groups  as  agricultural  workers,  dekhan  farmers  working  for  collective  dekhan  farms  or  joint  stock  farms, \ngovernment  workers  on  a  salary,  households  without  garden  plots  or  livestock,  single  women,  households  containing \nmultiple  families  under  one  roof,  pensioners,  and  invalids.  Villagers  identified  the  rich  in  their  villages  as  independent \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10          \n\n54 \n \n\ndekhan farmers, people who had developed an asset base during the Soviet period (and still maintained that asset base), \nand those who knew how to operate in a market economy. \n\n \nAt the five project sites, three general themes emerged as a cause of poverty\u2014lack of water for irrigation and drinking, lack \nof access to land, and lack of jobs. Villagers saw physical improvements in their irrigation systems as a potential avenue to \nescape  extreme  poverty,  if  the  improvements  led  directly  to  more  reliable  and  assured  irrigation  water  supplies  for  both \nlarge  cotton  fields  and  also  smaller  household  gardens.  Villagers  also  consistently  commented  on  the  need  for  more \nopportunities  to  become  independent  dekhan  farmers,  in  control  of  their  agricultural  inputs  and  outputs,  rather  than \ndependent on collective dekhan farms and outside investors. Village women in particular often stated that they have skills \n(e.g., baking, weaving) but they have no \"job place\" to demonstrate those skills and earn an income. \n\n \nThe  design  of  the  Project  addresses  the  key  causes  of  income  poverty.  Low  productivity  and  hence low incomes from \ncotton  farms  are  caused  by  the  unreliable  supply  of  irrigation  water  due  to  deteriorating  irrigation  and  drainage  (I&D) \nfacilities.  The  Project  will  cover  the  rehabilitation  of  I&D  facilities  on  47,500  ha  in  five  districts.  The  five  districts were \nselected through a systematic screening and stakeholder consultations that took into account social (predominance of poor \nhouseholds)  and  institutional  factors,  potential  to  increase  economic  and  social  benefits,  and  low  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) costs. Rehabilitation of I&D will be complemented with improvement of land and water management, \nformation of water users\u2019 associations (WUAs) in core demonstration areas and the establishment of a WUA support unit in \nthe Ministry of Water Resources and Land Reclamation (MWRLR). Together with improved land and water management \npractices, these project measures will increase yields and cropping intensities in both the cotton and household farms; will \ngenerate  on-farm  jobs;  and  thus,  will  ensure  more  stable and secure farm income.  The  Project  is  likewise  pro-gender. \nWomen-headed  farm  households  and  women  farmers  will  be  proactively  involved  in  the  whole  project  cycle  and  in  the \norganization  and  development  of  WUAs.  Nonincome  poverty  will  also  be  partly  addressed  by  the  Project  through  the \nprovision of rural potable water for a population of 57,000 in selected project areas.  \n \nIrrigation development in the project areas will lead to job creation and higher incomes. Approximately 153,000 poor farm \nhouseholds will benefit from the Project; generate an increase of 41% in dekhan farm incomes, and 33% in household plots \nincomes; and create opportunities for growth. Increased agricultural outputs (cotton by 23% and wheat by 21%) will lead to \nincreased  rural  incomes,  particularly  among  the  poor.  Improved  agriculture  activities  will  spur  the  demand  for  labor \nestimated  at  750,000  labor-days.  In  sum,  the  economic  benefits  will  redound  more  to  the  poor  households  than  the \nbeneficiary groups. Sustained income benefits to the poor households will translate in the medium term into a decrease in \nthe poverty incidence in the project areas of 5%.  \n \nThe Project will also produce indirect impacts. Improved land privatization efforts would accelerate the ability of the poor to \ngenerate  income,  as  being  an  independent  dekhan  farmer  consistently  means  more  freedom  of  choice,  more  ability  to \nfollow the market, and ultimately higher incomes. \n \n \nFull  land  privatization  often  results  in  cheaper  farm  inputs,  as  competition  accompanies  land privatization. Independent \ndekhan  farmers  in  the  project  sites  consistently  reported  agricultural  input  prices  50%  cheaper  than  that  input  prices  at \ncollective  dekhan  farms.  Lastly,  nonincome  poverty  will  be  addressed  in  this  Project  by  rehabilitating rural water supply \nsystems, and 5,150 poor households are estimated to benefit from new potable water supply facilities. \n\nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\n \nTwelve stakeholder meetings  were  held  in  the  project  areas.  A  total  of  175  stakeholders  participated  in  the  dialogues. \nStakeholder  representatives  included  those  from  local  government,  irrigation,  and  agricultural  officials,  teachers, \ndoctors/health  workers,  women's  groups,  agricultural workers,  dekhan  farmers  (independent  and  collective),  landless \nlaborers,  dekhan  farmers'  associations,  and  local  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs).  After  gathering  quantitative \ndescriptive data from local village officials, discussions were held focusing on poverty (definition, causes, how to escape, \netc.),  village  needs  and  demands,  rural  and  agricultural  structure,  debt,  socioeconomic  profile,  and  prospects  and \nconstraints of WUAs. Wealth ranking and role playing exercises were also employed to more fully understand the villagers' \nperceptions,  attitudes,  and  behavior  toward  poverty.  During  the  stakeholder  meetings,  the  participation  exercises  helped \nsharpen how the irrigation rehabilitation should be carried out and managed, and how the Project could be focused more to \nfight poverty (e.g., better water management, employing local villagers in civil works to the maximum extent possible, urging \nthe government to accelerate and improve land privatization). \n \n   Yes               \n \nThe Project's participation strategy will focus on ensuring the involvement of the project beneficiaries \u2014including the poor, \nwomen,  and  vulnerable  groups \u2014in  all  phases  of  project  design,  implementation,  and  monitoring.

Processes include \n(i) further stakeholder meetings at the village level as project design and implementation proceeds; (ii) a participatory and \ncommunity-based monitoring and evaluation (M&E) mechanism and process focusing on strengthening local users' groups \nduring the actual monitoring process; (iii) rehabilitation consultation/dialogues with farmers meeting regularly with irrigation \nofficials  (primarily  through  the  WUAs)  to  coordinate  canal  closings,  water  delivery  times,  and  future  irrigation  canal \nmanagement  strategies;  and  (iv) intercommunity  exchanges/immersions  with  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and  Land \nReclamation  officials,  government  policy  makers,  representatives  of  development  partners,  and  project  officials,  to \nexchange  experiences  and  improve  implementation  procedures.  Rural  institutions  will  include  (i) WUAs  formed  in  the \nirrigation systems focusing on improved irrigation management and on O&M; (ii) participatory water committees responsible \nfor long-term O&M of the rehabilitated village water supply system; (iii) women's groups supported by international and local \nNGOs, focusing not only on activities specific to women, but also enlarging activities for women to fully participate in all \nproject activities; and (iv) informal associations of independent dekhan farmers who have banded together for economies of \nscale. \n\nD.  Gender Development \n \nA gender action plan has been prepared (Appendix 12) that will maximize the impact of this Project on women.

It is estimated \nthat  about  18%  of  total  rural  households  are  headed  by  women.  The  share  of  this  type  of \nhousehold is expected to rise as more men from rural areas migrate in search of work. As many \nof the men do not send remittances to their families from Russia, the women often have to play \nthe multiple roles of earning income for their families, providing for their sustenance, and taking \ncare of the children. In the project sites, the women are in charge of the garden plots, which are \noften  the  family\u2019s  main  source  of  food.  Reliable  access  to  irrigation  water  would  help  women \nincrease their garden plot\u2019s productivity. \n  \n2. \nAside  from  the  garden  plots,  women  augment  their  incomes  by  working.  However, \nunemployment  and  underemployment  in  the  villages  are  considered  as  the  most  important \nproblems  by  villagers  (especially  the  women).  Some  local  officials  estimated  the  level  of \nunemployment in their  areas  at  80%.  Often,  there  are  only  one  or  two  employers  in  a  given \narea, such as a cotton factory or school. Women traditionally work in the social (education and \nhealth) and agriculture sectors, where wages are five to eight times lower than salaries in the \nindustry and construction sectors. The women\u2019s role in the cotton farms is particularly important \nduring both the planting (spring) and harvest (fall) seasons when as many as 90% of the field \nworkers  are  women  and  children.  However,  salaries  as  agricultural  workers  on  the  collective \ndekhan  farms  are  extremely  low.  During  cotton  harvesting,  agricultural  workers  are  paid  per \nkilogram picked, ranging from approximately 6 diram/kg to 55 diram/kg picked.  \n \n3. \nAny  economic  event  in  the  cotton  sector  will  have  large  implications  on  women's \nincomes,  their  time,  and  their  families.  On  five  different  occasions  during  the  12  stakeholder \nmeetings,  women  working  in  the  cotton  sector  pointed  out  that  they  would  need  better  water, \nland,  and  jobs.  They  said  their  present  status  as  agricultural  workers  in  the  cotton  sector  was \ncharacterized  by  unreliable  water  supplies  and  few  opportunities  to  join  the  ranks  of \nindependent dekhan farmers or find employment opportunities. \n \n4. \nIncreasing  access  to  potable  drinking  water  will  favorably  impact  on  women  in  the \nproject  areas.  About  30%  of  the  farm  households  in  the  project  sites  get  water  from  rivers, \nlakes, and ponds. Over 40% of the project households use water from sources more than 100 \nmeters  away  and  the  majority  of  those  who  fetch  the  water  are  women  and  children. \nWaterborne  diseases  are  likewise  common  in  these  areas.  Improved  access  to  potable  water \nsupplies would thus help women play a more active role in village economic activities, as less \ntime would be spent in carrying water and caring for the sick.  \n \nB. \n\nGender Strategy and Action Plan \n\n5. \nThe  Project  will  address  these  concerns  by  taking  actions  that  on  the  one  hand  will \nimprove  (i) women\u2019s  participation  in  the  water  users\u2019  association  (WUAs),  water  committees, \nand  in  the  planning,  implementation,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  project;  (ii) their \naccess to project information; and (iii) their technical skills in farm production and organizational \nskills as they become involved in community-based organizations and project-related activities; \nand  on  the  other  hand  will  promote  gender  responsiveness  among  policy  makers  and  other \nstakeholders involved in the project.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n57 \n\nThe Project\u2019s gender action plan will focus on: \n\n6. \n \n\n(i) \n\nWomen\u2019s  representation.  The  Project  will  ensure  that  in  the  provision  and \ndelivery of each of the  four  project components, the participation of women will \nbe  ensured.  Under  the  rehabilitation  of  irrigation  and  drainage  infrastructure \ncomponent (a) 50% of households headed by women in the project sites will be \nmembers  of  the  WUAs;1 and (b) at  least  25%  of  representatives  in  the  project \ndesign,  planning,  and  implementation  meetings  will  be  women.  For  the \nimprovement of potable water supply systems component, women will constitute \nat least 30% of the members of the local drinking water decision-making bodies. \nIn  the  support  for  agricultural  development  component,  at  least  30%  of  women \nfarm  workers  will  become  members  of  local  farmers\u2019  groups.  In  the  project \nmanagement, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) component, at least 20% of \nthe  staff  of  project  management  offices,  project  implementation  units,  and  the \nM&E units will be women. \n\nSkills enhancement for women. The Project will ensure that at least (a) 20% of \nfarm households headed by women participate in activities in the Project\u2019s core \ndemonstration  areas;  (b) 25%  of  those  trained  in  land  and  water  farm \nmanagement,  new  cultural  practices,  and  rural  water  supply  management  are \nwomen;  and  (c) 25%  of  those  participating  in  other  organizational  skills \nenrichment activities are women. \n\nProvision  of  a  gender  specialist. A gender and social development specialist \nwill  be  employed  to  (a) provide  an  assessment  of  the  gender  and  social \n(including poverty) issues and concerns in the project sites using quantitative and \nqualitative  methods  of  analysis,  (b) develop  a  gender  plan  of  action  that  will \naddress  the  issues  and  concerns  related  to  the  project,  and  (c) develop  an \nimplementation  mechanism  and  advocacy  strategy  for  following  through  the \naction  plan.  The  specialist  will  also  assist  in  the  design  of  the  M&E  system  to \nensure that it incorporates gender, poverty, and social concerns adequately.   \n\nGender  sensitivity  in  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  gender  and  social \ndevelopment  specialist  will  ensure  that  the  design  of  the  M&E  system \nincorporates  appropriate  inputs,  outputs,  and  outcome  indicators  that  reflect \nwomen\u2019s  concerns  about  the  Project.  The  M&E  system  will  also  include  a \nfeedback  mechanism  to  provide  project  staff  with  information  and  assessments \nof  the  perceptions  and  views  of  the  Project\u2019s  female  and  male  beneficiaries  on \nthe progress and impact of the Project.  \n\nAdvocacy  for  gender  and  development.  Gender  and  development  as  an \nintegral  policy  outcome  of  the  project  will  be  pursued  through  the  inclusion  of \ngender-related  agenda  in  the  policy  dialogues  with  central  and  local  policy \nmakers and in stakeholder meetings and other forums that will be initiated during \nthe Project. \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1  This is the same target proportion as for farm households as a whole. \n\n\f58 \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \nA. \n\nBackground \n\nSHORT RESETTLEMENT PLAN  \n\nWithin  the  Project,  rehabilitation  and  improvement  of  irrigation  and  drainage  systems \n\nThe  Irrigation  Rehabilitation  Project  will  improve  the  living  standards  of  farming \n1. \ncommunities in project areas with improvements in farm household incomes through increased \nfarm  productivity  and  improved  access  to  potable  water.  To  achieve  this  the  Project  has  four \nmain components: (i) selected rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage infrastructure, (ii) support \nfor agricultural development, (iii) improvement of potable water supply systems, and (iv) project \nmanagement.  \n \n2. \nand rural water supply systems have potential limited involuntary resettlement impacts.   \n \n3. \nAll land in Tajikistan is state-owned. Land use is directed by the state through the district \nadministrations,  specifically  the  local  offices  of  the  State  Land  Committee  and  district \nadministrative offices (Hukumat). Inheritable land use rights are provided for under Tajikistan's \nland tenure reform, but the process is at a very early stage of implementation. Tajikistan\u2019s Land \nCode  addresses  potential  compensation  for  people  who  legally  occupy  government  land  and \nare  forced  to  relocate,  but  the  Land  Code  does  not  address  compensation  for  people  illegally \noccupying government land and forced to relocate. \n \n4. \nPotable  Water  Supply  Systems.  In  Asht  district,  the  construction  of  a  drinking  water \nreservoir  will  require  a  village  road  to  be  moved  slightly  (a  few  meters),  thus  using  some \nadditional  empty  government  wasteland.  Additionally,  it  is  possible  that  a  small  edge  of  a \nhousehold fence, which encloses a large vegetable garden, may also have to be moved slightly \n(less than a meter [m]) , along a distance of less than 5.0 m and thus involving no more than 5.0 \nsquare meter (m2). As the potential drinking water reservoir is fed by springs, the location of the \nreservoir is critical and it may be that other design options are not feasible. The actual degree of \nconstraint  will  not  be  possible  to  determine  until  the  topographical  survey  is  carried  out  at  the \nstart  of  the  design  process.  It  is  presumed  that  the  fenced  land  is  legally  occupied  and \ncompensation  would  therefore  need  to  be  negotiated  if  the  garden  is  to  be  encroached.  It  is \nquite possible that for such a small area, the compensation could be in kind, such as provision \nof a new fence and gate, rather than financial.  \n \n5. \nAdditionally,  some  rehabilitation  of  rural  water  systems  requires  laying  of  underground \npipes, which will require digging up agricultural land during the off-season, outside the growing \nperiod. Temporarily, therefore, this pipe laying could disrupt some agricultural land, though the \nland  would  be  restored  for  the  next  growing  season.  There  will  be  no  impact  on  harvest  from \nthese  activities  and  therefore  no  compensation  will  be  required.  The  Ministry  of  Water \nResources and Land Reclamation (MWRLR) has agreed that during the laying of underground \npipes, households whose agricultural land is affected will be given priority for construction jobs \nwith contractors to the maximum extent possible.  \n \nIrrigation and Drainage Rehabilitation. For irrigation and drainage rehabilitation, works \n6. \nwill  be  confined  within  the  boundaries  of  installations  (e.g.,  pumping  stations),  or  along  linear \nstructures (irrigation and drainage canals). \n \nThere will be very limited new construction in WRDRP. The priority for new construction \n7. \nin  WRDRP  is  a  new  settling  basin  on  government  land  near  the  intake  of  the  main  canal  in \nHamadoni district, Khatlon region. The size of the potential settling basin will be from 10 to 15 \nhectares  (ha).  Nine  Tajik  households  without  title  or  permission  to  use  the  land  are  presently \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n      Appendix 12 \n\n59 \n\ncultivating approximately 6.5 ha of government land at the settling basin site. The households \nmembers  are  not  living  at  the  site,  they  are  only  cultivating  land  at  the  site.  No  structures, \ntherefore,  would  have  to  be  moved  or  replaced.  The  size  of  the  future  settling  basin  requires \nless than half of the land potentially available for construction and therefore there is scope for \nselecting  a  more  advantageous  location  and  not  extending  to  areas  illegally  and  irregularly \ncultivated  by  persons  residing  in  villages  outside  the  site.  Nevertheless,  a  short  resettlement \nplan has been developed to adequately address and compensate these households, ensuring \nthat their livelihood will not be negatively affected by the construction of the settling basin. \n \n8. \nSeven  of  the  nine  households  were  contacted,  interviewed,  and  consulted  about  the \npotential Project and the possible resettlement required. The size of the land being cultivated by \nthe seven interviewed households is shown in Table A12.1. \n \n\nTable A12.1: Size of Cultivated Land per Household \n \n\nHousehold \n\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \nTotal \n\nEstimated Size of Land Cultivated \n(hectares) \n0.80 \n1.40 \n0.61 \n0.50 \n0.20 \n0.02 \n3.00 \n6.53 \n\nFarmers from the seven households contacted said the other two households farm have \n\n                         Source: Field surveys . \n \n9. \nvery small plots of land on the potential settling basin site, approximately 0.02 ha each. \n \n10. \nTwo of the seven interviewed households have four family members, and the other five \nhouseholds have from 12 to 24 family members. The heads of the seven households all have \nsecondary  level  education,  with  two  heads  of  households  with  technical  secondary  education, \nand  two  with  university  level  education.  Household  members  are  either  former  or  present \nemployees of the District Irrigation Office and they are very familiar with the needs for irrigation \nsystem  rehabilitation  and  a  new  settling  basin.  Five  of  seven  households  have  children  living \nand working in Russia. \n \n11. \nThe main crops grown in the 6.5 ha are wheat, onions, cucumbers, tomatoes, melons, \nand  maize.  The  interviewed  farmers  did  not  know  the  exact  yields  of  their  crops,  but  they \nestimate that onions were at about 2.0 metric tons (mt)/ha, melon at 1.5 mt/ha, and maize at 4.0 \nmt/ha.1 Three of the seven households (covering 3.63 ha of the total 6.53 ha) reported that the \ncrops  are  for  home  consumption  and  they  receive  no  cash  income  from  the  crops.  The  other \nfour  households  (covering  2.9  ha  out  of  the  total  6.53  ha)  estimated  that  they  receive  small \nannual  incomes  from  the  crops  grown,  ranging  from  300-400  TJS/year  ($100\u2013133), to 3,000 \nTJS/year ($1,000).2  \n                                                 \n1  The  accuracy  of  their  yield  estimates  is  questionable  and  would  require  further  verification.  One  respondent \n\nguessed his onion yield was 7.0\u20138.0 mt/ha. \n\n2  The accuracy of these income figures is also questionable. The respondents have no formal records of either their \nyields  or  incomes,  and  during  the  interviews  the  respondents  said  that  they  really  did  not  know  the  yields  or \nincomes. It was only when interviewers asked for estimates of yields and incomes, that the respondents provided \ninformation. Data from the Poverty and Social Analysis in nearby Farkhor District show annual household incomes \nrange from about TJS2,600 ($866) to TJS24,000 ($8,000). \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nSix of the seven households reported that they were not farming land outside the land \n12. \nthey are cultivating in the proposed settling basin site.3 One household reported that they have \n0.7 ha of land outside the site. \n \nDuring more qualitative discussions, the seven households were aware of the benefits to \n13. \nthe  entire  district  if  a  settling  basin  were  to  be  constructed,  as  they  all  work  for  the  district \nirrigation office. The respondents said they realize they have no title or permission to farm this \nland,  but  since  the  land  was  vacant,  they  started  cultivating  small  plots  there.  The  heads  of \nhousehold interviewed all agreed that they would have no objection to giving up this land for the \nsettling  basin.  They  agreed  that  being  offered  alternative  land  by  the  district  Hukumat \n(administrative  office)  would  be  accepted,  as  well  as  receiving  employment  and  wages  during \nthe  construction  of  the  settling  basin.  All  nontitled  affected  persons  will  be  allowed  to  harvest \ntheir crops before civil works start.  \n \nB. \n\nScope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n \n\nThere will be no land acquisition during resettlement as the government presently owns \n14. \nthe  land,  and  there  are  no  structures  on  the  land.  Only  the  6.5  ha  of  cultivated  land  will  be \naffected. There will be no loss of homes, but the loss of livelihood will be compensated.  \n \nC. \n\nObjectives, Policy Framework, and Entitlements  \n\n15. \nThe  Tajikistan  Land  Code  (Article  48)  states  that  if  land  is  taken  from  a  physical  and \njuridical or legal person for state and public needs, those persons will be apportioned the same \nvalue  of  land,  and  losses  including  income  will  be  fully  compensated.  The  chief  of  the \nDepartment of International Relations at Tajikistan\u2019s State Land Committee has stated that the \ndistrict-level  Hukumat  can  compensate  people  who  are  forced  to  relocate,  even  if  it  is  only \ncultivated land, not houses, that must be relocated. Extensive discussions have been held with \nthe  Hamadoni  district  Hukumat  to  ensure  that  the  nine  households  receive  full  and  complete \ncompensation.  \n \n \n16. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement  addresses \n\u201closses  of  land,  resources,  and  means  of  livelihood  or  social  support  systems,  which  people \nsuffer  as  a  result  of  ADB  projects\u2026\u201d.  The  proposed  Project  will  not  cause  any  population \ndisplacement,  but  there  is  the  possibility  that  a  few  households  may  lose  access  to  land  from \nwhich they derive some income. Although these households do not possess land use rights, the \nresettlement plan ensures that those whose lives and incomes may be affected will be assisted \nto ensure the same level of well-being as prior to the Project. \n \nD. \n\nConsultation and Grievance Redress Participation \n\n17. \nConsultations  with  the  affected  people  cultivating  the  6.5  ha  have  been  ongoing  since \nthe project preparatory technical assistance stage, involving trips to sites by both international \nand national consultants, consultations with the affected people, socioeconomic questionnaires, \nqualitative discussions with members of the affected households, multiple meetings with district-\nlevel and irrigation offices, and numerous discussions at the national level with the State Land \nCommittee of Tajikistan, and the Ministry of Water Resources and Land Reclamation (MWRLR) \nin Dushanbe.  \n \n                                                 \n3  Like many rural households in Tajikistan, it is very likely that these seven households do have household gardens \nand  presidential  land  plots  outside  the  site,  but  during  the  interviews,  they  only  referred  to  independent  land \noutside the site. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n      Appendix 12 \n\n61 \n\nAll  parties  to  the  discussions  have  agreed  to  ensure  the  welfare  of  the  nine  affected \n18. \nhouseholds.  Most  of  the  nine  households  have  members  who  are  presently  or  previously \nemployed  by  the  district  irrigation  office.  The  district  administration  in  Hamadoni  district,  in \ncoordination  with  the  district  irrigation  offices  in  Hamadoni  and  Farkhor,  will  address  any \nappeals of affected persons. \n \nE. \n\nCompensation, Relocation, and Income Restoration \n\nThere  are  three  key  elements  related  to  compensation,  relocation,  and  income \n19. \nrestoration. First, the Hukumat of Hamadoni district has agreed to provide irrigated land for the \nnine households, of equal or better quality, for compensation for their potential loss of livelihood. \nSecond, MWRLR has agreed that during construction of the settling basin, members from the \nnine  households  will  be  given  priority  for  construction  jobs  with  contractors  to  the  maximum \nextent possible.4 Third, MWRLR has also agreed to the extent possible, qualified members from \nthe nine affected households will be considered for employment with the district irrigation office. \nAs  noted  above,  most  of  the  households  have  members  already  employed  by  the  district \nirrigation office, making future employment even more likely. \n \n20. \nThere  will  be  no  housing  relocation,  as  the  households  are  outside  the  proposed \nconstruction site. Only cultivated land will be affected. The land provided to the households from \nthe district authorities will also have to consider accessibility, fertility, and provision of irrigation \nwater. \n \nF. \n\nInstitutional Framework \n\n21. \nPlanning,  implementation,  inspection,  and  assessment  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the \ndistrict  authorities,  in  coordination  with  the  district  irrigation  office.  The  project  management \noffice (PMO) and MWRLR will also provide oversight to the implementation of the resettlement \nplan. Dissemination of information and public discussions with the affected people will also be \nundertaken  at  periodic  intervals  to  ensure  proper  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan  and \nfacilitate resettlement. \n \nG. \n\nResettlement Budget and Financing \n\n22. \nThere will be no land acquisition. For households that lose access to land, MWRLR will \nensure  that  replacement  land  will  be  provided  and  households  will  receive  land  use  rights  on \nthis  land.  There  will  be  minor  costs  involved  in  monitoring  and  providing  support  for \nresettlement, and those costs, as well as any unforeseen costs, will be covered by the Project. \n \nH. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\nDetailed  planning  and  implementation  of  resettlement  will  take  place  well  before  the \n\n23. \nbeginning of civil works construction of the settling basin. Details are provided in Table A12.2. \n \n\n                                                 \n4 \n\nIt should be noted that the seven households interviewed enthusiastically agreed that if they were able to receive \nemployment during the construction of the settling basin, they would willingly give up their illegal cultivation on this \n6.5 ha. The prospect of income-producing jobs seemed to outweigh their desire to continue cultivating these small \nplots of land. It is also difficult at this time to accurately estimate the potential income lost due to the loss of the 6.5 \nha, as three of the seven households reported no income from the crops, and the other four households were very \nvague  regarding  income  received  from  the  crops.  Though  income  was  reported  from  these  four households, \nfarmers generally said that crops were for home consumption. In any event, jobs during the construction of the \nsettling basin could pay as much as TJS300 per person per month.  \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nTable A12.2: Approximate Schedule for Resettlement Efforts \n\nActivity \n \nConsultations with affected people, local authorities, and district \nirrigation office \n \nDetailed resettlement planning and social preparation including a \ncomplete census of households eligible for entitlements (names \nof households and claimed land areas recorded by the PMO) \nprior to loan effectiveness \n \nFinalization of new land site \n \nResettlement \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates .  \n \nI. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\nTime \n\n \nOngoing \n\n \n6 months prior to construction \n\n \n3 months prior to construction \n \n1 month prior to construction (condition for civil \nworks commencement on settling basin)  \n\n24. \nThe PMO will implement a detailed monitoring and evaluation plan for the entire Project, \nincluding  preparation,  implementation,  and  after-effects. With regard to resettlement, the PMO \nwill  develop  baseline  data  for  monitoring  indicators  including:  amount  of  land  lost;  amount  of \nreplacement  land  (of  similar  or  better  quality);  number  of  jobs  provided  (temporary  and \npermanent); compensation payments; and other assistance for moving, training, and tracking of \nhousehold  incomes  (or  agricultural  incomes  or  output  value).  In  support  of  these  activities, \naffected  persons  will  be  invited  to  attend  public  meetings  to  discuss  issues  regarding  the \nresettlement.  The  Executing  Agency  will  submit  quarterly  progress  reports  to  ADB  on  the \nimplementation of the resettlement plan and a resettlement completion report.  \n \nJ. \n\nConclusion \n\n25. \nThe  overall  philosophy  and  thrust  of  the  resettlement  plan  is  to  ensure  that  the  nine \nhouseholds  cultivating  the  6.5  ha  without  titles  will  be  fully  compensated  for  any  economic, \nsocial, or institutional distress they may suffer as a result of the construction of the settling basin \nbenefiting approximately 17,700 ha. The resettlement plan is designed to ensure that these nine \nhouseholds are in no way adversely affected by their cultivation on the government land. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n", " \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 31 October 2004) \n", "Currency Unit \nTJS1.00 \n$1.00 \n \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n \n", "somoni (TJS) \n$0.3351 \nTJS2.9839 \n \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nARP \nCSP \nEA \nIEE \nEIRR \nFAO \nI&D \nGDP \nIPM \nLCB \nM&E \nMWRLR \nNGO \nNPV \nO&M \nPMO \nPRSP \nRO \nSDR \nSCNPF \nTA \nWUA \n", "ha \nmt \nm2 \nm3 \nt \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAgriculture Rehabilitation Project \ncountry strategy and program \nexecuting agency \ninitial environmental examination \neconomic internal rate of return \nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations \nirrigation and drainage  \ngross domestic product \nintegrated pest management \nlocal competitive bidding \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  monitoring and evaluation \n\u2013  Ministry of Water Resources and Land Reclamation \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "nongovernment organization \nnet present value \noperation and maintenance \nproject management office \nPoverty Reduction Strategy Paper \nregional office \nspecial drawing rights \nState Committee for Nature Protection and Forestry \ntechnical assistance \nwater users\u2019 association \n", "WEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "hectare \nmetric ton \nsquare meter \ncubic meter \nton \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government and its agencies ends on 31 December. \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", "This report was prepared by a team consisting of P.
