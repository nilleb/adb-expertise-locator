An  overall  initial  environmental  examination  and  three \ninitial  environmental  examinations  were  undertaken.  An \nsample \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  procedure  was  prepared  to \nguide \nthe  environmental  assessment  of  subprojects  during \nimplementation. \n \nIn  October  2000,  the  Government  of  Karnataka  (GoK)  appointed  the \nHigh Power Committee (HPC) to study regional imbalances within the \nstate  and  to  advise  GoK  on  remedial  measures  to  redress  such \nimbalances. Following a detailed analysis, the High Power Committee \nReport for Redressal of Regional Imbalances proposed an investment \nplan  of  Rs11,527  crores  ($2,652  million)  for  north  Karnataka.  The \ninvestment  plan  covers  many  sectors,  including  agriculture,  rural \ndevelopment, \ntransport, \nscience and technology, financial services, and social services. Urban \ndevelopment  and  tourism,  included  in  the  social  services  sector,  are \ngiven an allocation of about 33% ($862 million) of the total investment \nplan  and  are  recognized  as  priorities.  Based  on  the  HPC  report\u2019s \nrecommendation,  GoK  has  initially  selected  25  ULBs  for  assistance \nand  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  help  these \nurban local bodies (ULBs) in north Karnataka improve their delivery of \nbasic  urban  services.  Each  selected  ULB  prepared  a  city-level \ninfrastructure  plan  to  articulate  its  needs  in  the  form  of  investment \nprojects \ninfrastructure,  water  supply \ninfrastructure,  urban  transport  infrastructure,  slum  improvement,  and \nnonmunicipal \nthe  overall \nprogram  in  the  HPC  report  includes  state  government  funds,  central \nGovernment  funds,  and  funds  from  ULBs,  the  National  Bank  for \nthe  Housing  and  Urban \nAgriculture  and  Rural  Development, \nDevelopment  Corporation,  ADB, \nthe  World  Bank,  and  bilateral \ndevelopment agencies. \n \nThe North Karnataka Urban Sector Investment Program will help GoK \nrehabilitate  existing  urban  infrastructure  facilities  and  construct  new \nones in ULBs of north Karnataka. The Investment Program will assist \nGoK  in  meeting  its  urban  sector  investment  plan  and  providing  water \nsupply  systems,  sewerage  systems,  drainage,  and  urban  road \nresurfacing  and  junction  improvements.  The  living  environment  in \nslums will be improved with the provision of basic services. Firefighting \ncapacity  improvements,  tourism  infrastructure,  and  lake  rehabilitation \nare  also  included.  The  Investment  Program  will  introduce  private \nsector participation (PSP) in selected subsectors in selected ULBs and \nsupport  ongoing  institutional  reforms  and  training  for  ULB  staff \ncurrently being conducted by GoK under the Nirmala Nagar Program. \n \n\ninfrastructure).

The  requested  MFF  amounts  to  $270  million  over  an  8-year \nperiod  to  finance  the  infrastructure  investments  and  the  institutional \ndevelopment of the selected Investment Program ULBs. \n \n \nThe  HPC  report  indicates  that  while  some  diversification  has  taken \nplace  in  north  Karnataka,  agriculture  remains  the  primary  economic \ndriver  in  most  districts.  The  economy  has,  therefore,  remained \nsusceptible  to  weather  patterns,  and  the  current  economic  growth  is \nnot shared across the state on an equitable basis. One of the reasons \nfor the limited diversification in north Karnataka is the lack of adequate \nurban infrastructure and services in the ULBs. \n \nThe  Investment  Program  supports  the  investment  plan  for  ULBs \nrecommended  by  the  HPC  report  with  their  municipal  functions,  i.e., \nthe  provision  of  basic  urban  infrastructure  and  services  as  mandated \nby the 74th Amendment Act to the Constitution of India. \n \nThe  Investment  Program  would  be  a  logical  progression  of  previous \nADB  assistance  to  the  state  in  the  southern  and  coastal  areas  and \nwould  specifically  address  the  imbalance  in  the  level  of  urban \ninfrastructure  and  services  in  ULBs  in  north  Karnataka.  Furthermore, \nthe  Investment  Program  would  provide  an  opportunity  to  further \ndevelop  the  ongoing  relationship  between  ADB  and  the  Karnataka \nUrban  Infrastructure  Development  and  Finance  Corporation  (the \nKUIDFC)  to  both  build  up  state-level  capability  and  to  promote \ninvolvement  by  the  private  sector  in  designing,  constructing,  and \noperating  and  maintaining  infrastructure  facilities  for  the  efficient  and \nequitable  provision  of  basic  urban  infrastructure  and  services.  Under \nthe  Karnataka  Municipalities  Act \nthe  Municipality \nCorporations  Act  (1976),  ULBs  are  responsible  for  urban  service \ndelivery  and  operation  and  maintenance.  To  fulfill  this  responsibility \nwith  the  additional  infrastructure  to  be  created  under  the  Investment \nProgram,  the  Investment  Program  ULBs  need  to  maintain  sound \nfinancial  management  and  employ  adequate,  capable  human \nresources. \n \nThe \nimproved  urban \nInvestment  Program \ninfrastructure  and  services  resulting  in  overall  improvement  of  quality \nof life in the Investment Program ULBs, related increase in economic \nopportunities and growth in north Karnataka, and reduced imbalances \nbetween  north  Karnataka  and  the  rest  of  the  state.  The  Investment \nProgram  will  (i) improve  urban  services  for  at  least  the  4.3  million \npeople  living  in  the  initially  identified  25  Investment  Program  ULBs; \n(ii) improve  and  sustain  infrastructure  services  within  Investment \nProgram ULBs, which will in turn benefit the agriculture, industry, and \ntourism sectors; and (iii) promote PSP in selected subsectors with the \naim  of  bringing  in  a  proper  incentive  framework  for  efficient  and \nequitable service provision and of linking the private sector\u2019s financial \nliquidity with the large investment requirements in the urban sector. \n \nThe  HPC  report\u2019s  investment  plan  amounts  to  $862  million,  out  of \nwhich  the  identified  Investment  Program  is  estimated  to  cost  $440 \nmillion. \n \n\n(1964)  and \n\nimpact  of \n\nthe \n\nis \n\n\fFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nv\n\nIdentified \nInvestment \nProgram \n($ million) \n270 \n \n170 \n\nPercentage \nof Total \n   61 \n  \n   39 \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \n\nGovernment of Karnataka and  \n\nother agencies \n\nTotal \n\n440 \n\n  100 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nAn MFF of $270 million from the ordinary capital resources of ADB will \nbe  provided  to  the  Government.  Final  terms  and  conditions  will  be \ndetermined  in  the  context  of  each  loan  and  will  be  based  on  ADB\u2019s \nprevailing  policies.  Financing  made  available  under  each  loan  will  be \nprovided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \nfacility.  The  Government  has  the  option  to  choose  between  eligible \ncurrencies  and  the  interest  rate  regime  most  suitable  for  each  loan. \nADB also provides flexibility in terms of repayment and interest swaps \nduring  the  financing  period.  Repayment  schedules  can  be  structured \nfor  each  loan  to  match  the  needs  of  each  batch  of  subprojects  with \ntheir cost-recovery and sustainability profiles. \n \nThe  Government  will  onlend  the  amount  to  GoK  on  the  same  terms \nand conditions as the ADB loans under the MFF. GoK will pass on the \nproceeds  of  the  loans  to  the  implementing  agencies  in  a  mix  of  loan \nand  grants  based  on  agreed  arrangements  for  the  subsectors.  GoK \nwill assume the foreign exchange risks for the loans under the MFF. \n \n30  June  2016  (the  last  periodic  financing  request  submission  by  31 \nDecember 2013). \n \n31 December 2015. \n \nKarnataka Urban Infrastructure Development and Finance Corporation \n \nThe head office of the KUIDFC, in coordination with the regional office \nbased  in  Dharwad,  shall  constitute  the  Program  Management  Unit \n(PMU) for the Investment Program. The PMU will consist of a team of \ntechnical,  administrative,  social,  environmental,  and  financial  experts \nand officials that will assist with and monitor the Investment Program\u2019s \nimplementation  activities.  The  implementing  agencies  will  be  the \nInvestment  Program  ULBs;  the  Karnataka  Urban  Slum  Clearance \nBoard; the Directorate of Municipal Administration; the Department of \nInformation,  Tourism,  and  Youth  Services;  Karnataka  State  Fire  and \nEmergency Services; the Lake Development Authority; the Karnataka \nUrban Water Supply and Drainage Board; and the KUIDFC. \n \nProcurement of all goods and services under the Investment Program \nwill be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines, \nas  amended  from  time  to  time.  To  the  extent  possible,  goods  to  be \nprocured  will  be  grouped  into  packages  larger  than  $1  million  to  be \nsuitable \nprocedures. \nMiscellaneous goods that cannot be grouped into larger contracts and \nare  estimated to cost less than $1 million per contract will be procured \n\ninternational \n\ncompetitive \n\nbidding \n\nfor \n\nFacility Amount and Terms \n\n \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Program \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nConsulting Services \n\nBenefits and Beneficiaries \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\nfor \n\nthe \n\nthrough \n\ninitial  civil  works  and \n\nthrough  limited  international  bidding  or  national  competitive  bidding \nprocedures.  Off-the-shelf  items  and  standard  products  costing  less \nthan $100,000 will be procured following ADB\u2019s shopping procedures. \n \nCivil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost  $10  million  or  more  will  be \ninternational  competitive  bidding.  Civil  works \nprocured \ncontracts  estimated  to  cost  less  than  $10  million  will  be  procured \nthrough  national  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Subprojects  under \nthe  PSP  modalities  (i.e.,  performance-based  deferred  payment \nstructure  [PBDPS]  and  performance-based  management  contract \n[PBMC])  will  be  procured,  in  principle,  through  performance-based \nprocurement  procedures  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines.  PBDPS  contracts  account  for  the  capital  investment \nsegment \nthe  10-year  operation  and \nmaintenance segment. Thus the international competitive bidding and \nnational competitive bidding threshold of $10 million will be applied to \nthe estimated capital investment cost segment. \n \nConsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  using  quality-  and  cost-\nbased  selection  procedures  and/or  least  cost  selection  procedures  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. A total \nof about 1,700 person-months of consulting services will be required. \nFour  national  firms  will  be  engaged  as  the  program  consultants  to \nassist  the  PMU  with  overall  project  management  and  implementation \nand \nimplementing  agencies  with  design,  monitoring,  and \nsupervision  of  subprojects.  The  PMU  will  also  engage  one  national \nfirm  as  the  program  performance  monitoring  system  consultant  to \nmonitor  and  assess \nInvestment  Program. \nimpacts  of \nPerformance-based  contract  may  be  used  as  agreed  by  ADB  for \nconsultancy packages. \n \nThe  Investment  Program  will  potentially  benefit  at  least  4.3  million \npeople  living  in  the  initially  identified  25  ULBs  by  providing  them  with \nimproved  water  supply,  cleaner  environmental  conditions,  safer  and \nfaster  urban  transportation,  and  other  public  facilities.  These  physical \nimprovements  will  enhance  their  living  conditions  and  equip  the \nselected  ULBs  with  infrastructure  assets  to  provide  services  of  a \nreasonable quality for their residents, and thereby address the current \nimbalance between north Karnataka and the rest of the state. \n \nThe  institutional  development  component  of  the  Investment  Program \nwill  support  the  selected  ULBs\u2019  efforts  to  increase  property  tax  and \ntariff  revenues;  make  the  transition  to  a  fund-based  accounting \nsystem, which is compatible with international standards (i.e., double-\nentry,  accrual-based  accounting),  as  opposed \nthe  current, \nantiquated,  single-entry,  cash-based  system;  and  build  the  technical \nand  managerial  capacity  of  the  staff  to  maintain  better-quality  basic \nurban  services.  Through  the  PBDPS  and  PBMC  modalities,  the \nInvestment  Program  will  mobilize  private  resources,  including  capital, \ntechnical,  and  managerial  skills  and  other  human  resources,  to \nimprove service delivery and minimize the costs incurred by GoK. \n \nThe main risks include (i) Investment Program ULBs failing to manage \nand  maintain  the  newly  acquired  and/or  created  assets  properly  and \nbeing  tempted  to  minimize  costs  through  inappropriate  operations; \n(ii) lack of acceptance of the required changes in water tariffs needed \nto  achieve  cost  recovery  within  a reasonable time frame; (iii) lack of \n\nthe \n\nthe \n\nto \n\n\f \n\nvii\n\nprivate  sector  interest  in  the  PBDPS  and  PBMC  procurement \nmodalities;  (iv) conflicting  upstream  demands  for  water  sources;  and \n(v) delays in land acquisition that prevent construction activities. \n \nBased  on  lessons  from  global  experience  with  similar  contracting \napproaches, identifiable risks inherent in PSP arrangements, including \nthose identified during the preliminary sounding out of potential private \ncontractors,  will  be  mitigated  through  careful  design  of  the  PSP \ncontracts  and  of  the  underlying  legal  and  regulatory  regime.  The \nremaining  risks  will  be  allocated,  to  the  extent  possible,  to  those \nparties  best  able  to  bear  them.  This  principle  will  be  adopted  in \ndeveloping PSP contracts and associated bidding documents. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fo\n78  00'E\n\nINDIA\nNORTH KARNATAKA\nURBAN SECTOR INVESTMENT PROGRAM\n\n75  00'Eo\n\nUTTARANCHAL\n\n85  00'Eo\n\nHARYANA\n\nDelhi\n\nRAJASTHAN\n\n25  00'No\n\nUTTAR\nPRADESH\n\nBIHAR\n\nGUJARAT\n\nMADHYA  PRADESH\n\nCHHATTISGARH\n\nSIKKIM\n\nARUNCHAL\nPRADESH\n\nA S S A M\n\nMEGHALAYA\n25  00'No\n\nJHARKHAND\n\nTRIPURA\n\nWEST\nBENGAL\n\nMIZORAM\n\nO R I S S A\n\nB a y   o f\nB e n g a l\n\nGulf  of\nCambay\n\nMAHARASHTRA\n\nANDHRA\nPRADESH\n\nGOA\n\nKARNATAKA\n\nBangalore\n\nA r a b i a n\nS e a\n\n10  00'No\n\nKERALA\n\nTAMIL\nNADU\n\n75  00'Eo\n\n85  00'Eo\n\no\n74  00'E\n\nI N D I A N      O C E A N\n\no\n18  00'N\n\n10  00'No\n\nMAHARASTHRA\n\no\n18  00'N\n\nBIDAR\n\nBasavakalyan\n\nBidar\n\nGulbarga\n\nShahabad\n\nGULBARGA\n\nYadgir\n\nRaichur\n\nJamkhandi\n\nBijapur\n\nBIJAPUR\n\nNippani\n\nRabkavi-Banhatti\n\nGokak\n\nBAGALKOT\n\nBELGAUM\n\nBelgaum\n\nBadami\n\nIlkal\n\nRAICHUR\n\nSindhanoor\n\nANDHRA  PRADESH\n\nG OA\n\nDharwad\n\nDHARWAD\n\nKOPPAL\n\nGadag-Betageri\n\nGangavathi\n\nSupa\n\nHubli\n\nGADAG\n\nKoppal\n\nBellary\n\nN\n\nUTTARAKANNDA\n\nSirsi\n\nHaveri\n\nHAVERI\n\nHospet\n\nBELLARY\n\n0\n\n25\n\n50\n\n75\n\n100\n\nKilometers\n\nRanebennur\n\nDAVANGERE\n\nDavangere\n\nChitradurg\n\nCHITRADURG\n\nSagar\n\nSHIMOGA\n\nShimoga\n\nBhadravati\n\nUDUPI\n\nKadur\n\nCHIKMAGALUR\n\nUdupi\n\nChikmagalur\n\nHosdurga\n\nHarnahalli\n\nTUMKUR\n\nTumkur\n\nChikballanpur\n\nKOLAR\n\nKolar\n\nHassan\n\nHASSAN\n\nMercara\n\nBangalore\n\nMANDYA\nMandya\n\nBANGALORE\n\nCharmapatna\n\nKODAGU\n\nHunsur\n\nSrirangapatnam\n\nMysore\n\nMYSORE\n\nProject Urban Local Body\n\nMangalore\n\nDASHINA\nKANNADA\n\nBantyal\n\nA r a b i a n     S e a\n\nProject District\n\nNational Capital\n\nState Capital\n\nUrban Local Body\n\nNational Road\n\nOther Road\n\nRailway\n\nRiver\n\nDistrict Boundary\n\nState Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\no\n74  00'E\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\no\n12  00'N\n\nCHAAMRAJNAGAR\n\nChamarajnagar\n\no\n12  00'N\n\nKERALA\n\nTAMIL  NADU\n\no\n78  00'E\n\n06-3574 HR\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nmultitranche financing facility to India for the North Karnataka Urban Sector Investment Program.1  \n\nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nRapid  urbanization  and  underinvestment  in  infrastructure  have  resulted  in  serious \nenvironmental  and  health  problems  in  India\u2019s  cities.  Most  urban  households,  particularly  poor \nhouseholds, have limited access to potable water, sanitation, and drainage facilities and services. \nThe Government\u2019s2 successive five-year plans stressed rural development, and it was not until the \neighth five-year plan for fiscal year (FY) 1992\u20131997 that the Government specifically recognized the \nrole  and  importance  of  the  urban  sector.  This  change  in  emphasis,  together  with  India\u2019s  focus  on \neconomic liberalization; financial sector reform; and passage of the 74th Constitutional Amendment \nAct  in  1992,  which  laid  out  the  basis  for  decentralization  in  the  urban  sector,  has  brought  about \nsome  improvements,  but  large  inefficiencies  in  service  delivery,  inadequate  investment  to  expand \nservice coverage, and lack of maintenance persist. \n \nThis  is  the  case  throughout  the  state  of  Karnataka,  but  is  more  pronounced  in  the  urban \n3. \nlocal  bodies  (ULBs)  in  north  Karnataka.  Water  supply  in  the  vast  majority  of  ULBs  in  north \nKarnataka is intermittent, and is often as infrequent as once every 3 days to once a week. Only a \nfew  ULBs  receive  piped  water  for  1  to  2  hours  every  day,  and  the  water  quality  is  usually  poor. \nService coverage is limited and, on average, houses with water supply connections account for only \n67%  of  those  registered  for  property  taxes.  Where  sewerage  systems  have  been  constructed, \ncoverage is limited, and generally only the older, or more affluent, sections of the ULBs are served. \nOnly a few sewage treatment plants exist, and many of these do not function well, if at all. Storm \nwater drainage facilities are inadequate, poorly maintained, and frequently misused for solid waste \ndisposal. Roads are generally unpaved and junctions inefficient. Slums exist in most ULBs in north \nKarnataka and are served by only the most basic water supply and sanitation services. Each public \nstandpost (public tap) serves up to about 300 people, and sanitation is limited to poorly constructed \nlatrines. Details of the existing levels of urban infrastructure and services in each of the Investment \nProgram ULBs are presented in Appendix 2. \n \n4. \nThe  financial  performance  of  ULBs  in  north  Karnataka  is  poor,  and  current  tariffs  and \ncharges cover barely 20% of the operation and maintenance (O&M) costs of urban services. These \nULBs  rely  heavily  on  state  subsidies  to  pay  electric  bills  and  other  operating  costs.  Because  of  a \nlong-term  freeze  on  staff  recruitment,  the  ULBs  do  not  currently  have  the  institutional  capacity  or \nskills required to properly manage, operate, and maintain existing urban infrastructure facilities and \nservices. \n \nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n5. \nIn October 2000, the Government of Karnataka (GoK) appointed the High Power Committee \n(HPC)  to  study  regional  imbalances  within  the  state  and  to  advise  GoK  on  remedial  measures  to \nredress  the  imbalances.  Based  on  detailed  analysis,  the  High  Power  Committee  Report  for \nRedressal  of  Regional  Imbalances 3  proposed  an  investment  plan  of  Rs11,527  crores  ($2,652 \nmillion)  in  north  Karnataka.  The  investment  plan  covers  many  sectors,  including  agriculture,  rural \ndevelopment,  irrigation,  energy,  industry  and  mining,  transport,  science  and  technology,  financial \nservices,  and  social  services.  Urban  development  and  tourism,  which  are  included  in  social \nservices, are given an  allocation of about 33% ($862 million) of the total investment plan and are \nrecognized as priorities. The financing plan for the overall program in the HPC report includes state \ngovernment  funds,  central  Government  funds,  funds  from  the  ULBs,  the  National  Bank  for \nAgriculture  and  Rural  Development,  the  Housing  and  Urban  Development  Corporation,  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), the World Bank, and bilateral development agencies. \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework for the Investment Program is presented in Appendix 1. \n2  \u201cGovernment\u201d refers to the Government of India. \n3  Government of Karnataka. 2002. High Power Committee Report for Redressal of Regional Imbalances. Bangalore. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n6. \nThe HPC report indicates that while some diversification has taken place in north Karnataka, \nagriculture  remains  the  primary  economic  driver  in  most  districts.  The  economy  has,  therefore, \nremained  susceptible  to  weather  patterns,  and  the  current  economic  growth  is  not  shared \nthroughout  the  state  on  an  equitable  basis.  The  key  reason  for  the  limited  diversification  in  north \nKarnataka  is  the  lack  of  adequate  urban  infrastructure  and  services  in  the  ULBs.  The  goal  of  the \ninvestment plan proposed by the HPC report is to increase economic growth in backward clusters \nof ULBs (known as taluks) and to reduce imbalances between north Karnataka and the rest of the \nstate. \n \n7. \nBased  on  the  HPC  report\u2019s  recommendation,  GoK  asked  ADB  to  help  selected  ULBs  in \nnorth Karnataka improve their delivery of basic urban services. The Investment Program supports \nthe investment plan recommended by the HPC report. \n \n8. \nThe  Investment  Program  has  initially  identified  25  ULBs  located  in  north  Karnataka  to  be \nassisted  with  their  municipal  functions,  i.e.,  delivery  of  basic  urban  services  as  mandated  by  the \n74th  Constitutional  Amendment  Act  of  India.  The  assumption  is  that  improvements  in  the  urban \nsector  will  effectively  stimulate  economic  growth,  as  economic  activities  in  urban  areas  contribute \ndisproportionately to the region\u2019s overall economy. Each Investment Program ULB has prepared a \ncity-level infrastructure plan (CLIP) for improving its urban environment based on its needs for basic \nurban  infrastructure  and  services.  As  each  ULB  proposed  many  subprojects,  ADB  proposed  a \nsector  loan  approach  to  allow  flexibility  in  selecting  subprojects  and  to  enable  investment  that  is \nlinked to reforms by means of subproject selection criteria. \n \nThe Investment Program will support that part of the investment plan proposed by the HPC \n9. \nreport that focuses on urban infrastructure development. The Investment Program will initially focus \non  investments  in  priority  components,  namely,  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  slum  improvement. \nInstitutional  development  and  nonmunicipal  infrastructure  components  will  also  be  implemented \nduring  the  first  phase.  Upon  successful  progress  in  relation  to  the  foregoing  activities,  the \nInvestment  Program  will  then  start  investments  in  urban  transport  infrastructure.  Appendix  3 \npresents  subproject  selection  criteria  agreed  on  between  GoK  and  ADB  for  the  Investment \nProgram. \n \n10. \n\nThe sector loan approach is based on the following context: \n(i) \n\nGoK has analyzed regional imbalances within the state in a systematic manner and \nhas  made  recommendations  that  include  urban  development  as  one  of  the  key \ninvestment  priorities  in  order  to  reduce  the  imbalances.  Furthermore,  GoK  has \nalready  started  implementing  some  of  the  recommendations  from  the  HPC  report \nusing its own resources. \nThe  executing  agency  is  the  Karnataka  Urban  Infrastructure  Development  and \nFinance  Corporation  (the  KUIDFC),  which  has  proven  that  it  is  capable  of \nimplementing  urban  development  components  in  the  Investment  Program  ULBs  as \npart  of  the HPC  investment  plan.  The  KUIDFC  has  already  implemented  two  ADB-\nassisted  projects,  as  well  as  other  externally-funded  and  domestically-funded \nprojects, in the urban sector. Supplementary Appendix A presents a detailed analysis \nof the KUIDFC\u2019s capabilities as an executing agency.  \nPolicies  to  support  the  CLIPs,  including  municipal  reforms  and  tariff  reforms,  are \nongoing, and GoK has already initiated reform activities and the studies required to \nimplement these policies. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n11. \nThe development of urban infrastructure in the southern and coastal areas of Karnataka has \ncontinued  with  the  assistance  of  ADB  funding,  which  began  in  1993.  The  Karnataka  Urban \nInfrastructure  Development  Project  (the  KUIDP) 4  provided  total  assistance  of  $105  million  for \nformulating  an  integrated  urban  development  strategy  for  the  Bangalore  subregion.  The  KUIDP \nprovided an opportunity to develop \u201ccounter magnet\u201d urban locations, or growth centers, to reduce \ncongestion  in  Bangalore  by  including  a  component  directed  toward  improving  infrastructure  in  the \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1995. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Loans to India for the \nKarnataka Urban Infrastructure Development Project. Manila (Loan 1415-IND and Loan 1416-IND, for $85 million and \n$20 million, respectively, approved on 14 December 1995). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nfour  ULBs  of  Channapatna,  Mysore,  Ramanagaram,  and  Tumkur.  The  ULBs  of  Maddur  and \nMandya were subsequently added. The Karnataka Urban Development and Coastal Environmental \nManagement  Project  (KUDCEMP) 5  provided  assistance  of  $145  million  to  support  urban \ninfrastructure development in 10 coastal ULBs6 and to facilitate policy reforms to strengthen urban \nmanagement.  The  objectives  of  KUDCEMP  included  (i) strengthening  the  capacity  of  local \ngovernments  in  relation  to  resource  generation  and  cost  recovery  to  achieve  sustainability  in  the \nO&M  of  the  investments;  and  (ii) establishing  appropriate  environmental  planning,  management, \nand monitoring mechanisms to address the potential environmental impacts associated with urban \nand  industrial  growth  in  the  region.  KUDCEMP  initially  experienced  implementation  delays,  but  is \ncurrently  rated  as  satisfactory  by  the  ADB\u2019s  project  performance  monitoring  system.  Appendix  2 \npresents details of external assistance to the urban sector in India. \n \n12. \nThe  executing  agency  for  both  these  previous  projects  was  the  KUIDFC,  which  was \nincorporated in 1993 under the Companies Act (1956) and is wholly owned by GoK. The KUIDFC \nhas the following functions: (i) formulating and appraising urban infrastructure projects, (ii) providing \nfinancial and technical assistance to municipalities and development agencies, (iii) mobilizing funds \nfrom  various  sources,  (iv) implementing  and  monitoring  projects,  (v) formulating  and  implementing \ncapacity-building  programs  for  the  effective  delivery  of  urban  services,  and  (vi) assisting  with \nmunicipal sector reforms. Following its experience with implementing the KUIDP, KUDCEMP, and \nother  externally-funded  and  domestically-funded  projects,  the  KUIDFC  has  now  evolved  into  an \nagency capable of managing large projects for GoK. \n \n13. \nThe  Investment  Program,  which  will  include  urban  infrastructure  development  in  ULBs  in \nnorth  Karnataka,  would  be  a  logical  progression  of  previous  ADB  assistance  to  the  state  in  the \nsouthern and coastal areas and would specifically address the imbalance in the level of basic urban \ninfrastructure  and  services  in  the  ULBs  in  north  Karnataka.  Furthermore,  the  Investment  Program \nwould  provide  an  opportunity  to  further  develop  the  ongoing  relationship  between  ADB  and  the \nKUIDFC and build up state-level capability, as well as to promote involvement by the private sector \nin the design, construction, and O&M of infrastructure facilities for efficient and equitable provision \nof basic urban infrastructure and services. Urban service delivery and O&M are the responsibility of \nULBs under the Karnataka Municipalities Act (1964) and Municipality Corporations Act (1976). Even \nthough  some  Investment  Program  ULBs  adopting  the  performance-based  deferred  payment \nstructure  (PBDPS)  and  performance-based  management  contract  (PBMC)  modalities,  which  are \nelaborated in Paras. 54 through 57, will delegate asset creation and O&M responsibilities to private \ncontractors, the ultimate responsibility for tariff setting, billing, and revenue collection will still remain \nwith the Investment Program ULBs. To fulfill this responsibility for the additional infrastructure to be \ncreated  under  the  Investment  Program,  the  Investment  Program  ULBs  need  to  maintain  sound \nfinancial  management  and  employ  sufficient,  capable  human  resources.  As  the  initial  step  of  the \nreform,  the  monthly  tariffs  for  unmetered  domestic  water  use  have  been  increased  from  Rs45 \n(previously the uniform tariff across the state) to at least Rs55 per month in all 25 ULBs that have \nbeen identified as initial Investment Program ULBs.7 \n\n \n14. \nThe Investment Program is compatible with the Government\u2019s 10th five-year plan (FY2002\u2013\nFY2007), which targets economic growth of 8% per year and focuses on four basic themes: (i) high \ngrowth,  (ii) equitable  growth,  (iii) human  development,  and  (iv) reforms.  With  80%  of  planned \nbudget allocations targeting social expenditures, the 10th five-year plan aims to reduce poverty by \nensuring  access  to  education,  health  care,  potable  water,  and  sanitation.  The  10th  five-year  plan \nalso  focuses  on  good  governance  as  a  cross-cutting  theme  and  identifies  the  declining  role  of \ngovernment  in  the  provision  of  services.  The  plan  emphasizes  the  development  of  private  sector \nparticipation (PSP) in service delivery and the provision of an improved regulatory environment. \n \n15. \nThe proposed Investment Program is highly relevant to ADB\u2019s country strategy and program \n(CSP) for India, which rests on the three pillars of (i) pro-poor growth for reducing income poverty, \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB. 1999. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to India for the \nKarnataka  Urban  Development  and  Coastal  Environmental  Management  Project.  Manila  (Loan  1704-IND,  for  $145 \nmillion, approved on 26 October 1999). \n\n6  Ankola, Bhatkal, Dandeli, Kandapura, Karwar, Mangalore, Puttur, Sirsi, Udupi, and Ullal. \n7  There is no longer a single statewide uniform tariff. The new  monthly tariffs for unmetered domestic water use for the \n\n25 ULBs now range from Rs55 to Rs90. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n(ii) social  development  for  reducing  human  poverty,  and  (iii) good  governance  for  leveraging  and \nmaximizing the impact of development. As stated in the CSP, the private sector accounts for three \nfourths of both gross domestic product and investments in India, and even though the private sector \nhas  grown  considerably  during  the  last  two  decades,  the  CSP  notes  that  poor  infrastructure  has \nconstrained this growth. The development of improved infrastructure is, therefore, the backbone of \nthe CSP and accounts for 80% of ADB\u2019s 2005\u20132007 lending program. The CSP expresses a strong \ndesire to use ADB funding to leverage increased PSP in the urban sector. The sheer scale of the \nrequirements for urban infrastructure investment in India indicates that public financing through the \ngovernment  budget  together  with  multilateral  and  bilateral  agency  financing  will  be  insufficient  to \nachieve the desired improvements. Thus the Investment Program intends to establish a viable PSP \nbusiness model that will link existing financial liquidity in the private sector with the large investment \nrequirements in the urban sector, in particular, the water supply and sanitation and urban transport \nsubsectors. \n \n16. \nGoK  is  currently  implementing  comprehensive  reforms  in  line  with  the  10th  five-year  plan \nand, through the Directorate of Municipal Administration (DMA), is implementing the Nirmala Nagar \nProgram  (NNP).  The  latter  is  a  six-module  program  funded,  among  others,  by  ADB  under \nKUDCEMP that is addressing the key issues of (i) property taxes, (ii) accounting, (iii) thrift and credit \ninstitutions, (iv) public toilets, (v) rainwater harvesting, and (vi) solid waste management. The NNP \nis  being  supported  by  a  well-prepared  human  resources  policy  designed  to  abolish  obsolete  or \nredundant positions and recruit well-qualified professionals, such as accountants and environmental \nengineers,  through  competitive  selection  procedures.  Improving  the  poor  rates  of  property \nassessment  and  registration  for  tax  purposes  and  of  property  tax  collection  has  been  a  key \nobjective,  as  only  about  75%  of  the  properties  in  the  state  are  assessed  and  registered,  and  of \nthese,  only  50%  actually  pay  property  taxes.  The  unrealized  additional  tax  revenues  are  on  the \norder  of  $70  million  annually,  and  the  DMA  is  currently  70%  of  the  way  through  an  ambitious \nprogram to survey 3 million properties in the 63 ULBs initially targeted under the reforms. The NNP \nis being supported by well-designed management information and geographic information systems \nthat  were  developed  by  the  eGovernments  Foundation.  The  software  packages  being  used  are \nhighly advanced. \n \n17. \nUnder the KUIDP, GoK developed the fund-based accounting system, which is compatible \nwith  international  standards  (i.e.,  double-entry,  accrual-based  accounting),  using  Bangalore  and \nTumkur as pilot cases. The system has been working reasonably well, and the DMA upgraded it as \npart of the ongoing sector reforms before rolling it out to the 63 ULBs targeted for the first phase of \nreforms. As of April 2006, the fund-based accounting system was already being implemented in all \n63  ULBs.  These  63  ULBs  include  all  25  of  the  initially  identified  Investment  Program  ULBs.  The \nInvestment  Program  will  support  the  ULBs\u2019  efforts  to  increase  property  tax  revenues  and  tariff \nrevenues; make the transition from the current, antiquated, single-entry, cash-based system to the \nfund-based  accounting  system;  and  build  the  technical  and  managerial  capacity  of  the  staff  to \nmaintain better quality urban services by complementing the ongoing NNP urban reform initiatives. \nIn  particular,  policy  dialogues  have  been  conducted  between  the  KUIDFC  and  ADB  and  an \nagreement has been reached on overall water supply and sewerage tariff reforms, which started out \nwith  an  increase  in  the  current  monthly  flat-rate  water  tariffs  for  unmetered  water  and  will  be \nfollowed by careful adoption of a volumetric tariff schedule for metered water. \n \n18. \nIn parallel with the NNP, the Urban Development Department of GoK, through the KUIDFC, \nis conducting the Karnataka Urban Water Sector Improvement Project (KUWASIP) with assistance \nfrom  the  World  Bank.  Activities  already  undertaken  include  (i) the  water  supply  demonstration \nschemes  in  selected  zones  in  the  ULBs  of  Belgaum,  Gulbarga,  and  Hubli-Dharwad  that  provide \nwater  for  24  hours  a  day,  7  days  a  week;  (ii) an  implementation  of  rapid  social  assessment  and \npreparation  of  communication  strategy;  and  (iii) an  implementation  of  environmental  impact \nassessment. Studies currently being carried out under KUWASIP include (i) the establishment and \noperationalization  of  the  Karnataka  State  Urban  Water  Supply  Council,  (ii) the  creation  of \ninformation  on  water  supply  and  sanitation  and  the  benchmarking  of  service  provision,  (iii) the \nstrengthening of urban water supply and sanitation service delivery in ULBs, and (iv) the investment \nin  the  water  and  sanitation  sector  and  tariff  reforms.  A  key  component  of  KUWASIP  is  a  contract \ninvolving  the  KUIDFC:  the  ULBs  of  Belgaum,  Gulbarga,  and  Hubli-Dharwad;  and  a  private \ncontractor to run the water supply demonstration schemes in selected zones of the three ULBs to \nshow how  well a water supply system can  be run when a  capable and experienced management \nunit is put in place. This relates not only to the quantity and quality of water supplied, but also to the \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nimproved  efficiency  in  meter  reading,  system  maintenance,  and  response  to  customers\u2019  problems \nand complaints. \n \n19. \nStakeholder consultations conducted in the initially identified 25 Investment Program ULBs \nindicate a strong desire for improved urban infrastructure and services. Water supply was given the \nhighest  priority  in  18  of  the  25  selected  ULBs,  while  sanitation  was  ranked  second  and  drainage \nwas ranked third. Urban transport was given the lowest priority in 11 of the 25 ULBs. In the slum \nareas, preference for water supply was overwhelming, followed by sanitation. Drainage and urban \ntransport  were  not  ranked  as  highly,  reflecting  a  desperate  need  for  the  most  basic  urban \ninfrastructure. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n20. \nThe  impact  of  the  Investment  Program  is  improved  urban  infrastructure  and  services \nresulting in overall improvement of quality of life in the Investment Program ULBs, related increase \nin economic opportunities and growth in north Karnataka, and reduced imbalances between north \nKarnataka and the rest of the state. To achieve this impact, the Investment Program will help the \nparticipating  ULBs  rehabilitate  existing  urban  infrastructure  facilities  and  construct  new  ones, \nincluding  water  supply  systems,  sewerage  systems,  and  drainage,  along  with  urban  transport \nimprovements. The living environment of urban slums will be improved with the provision of basic \nservices.  The  Investment  Program  also  includes  firefighting  capacity  improvements,  tourism \ninfrastructure  improvements,  and  lake  rehabilitation.  The  Investment  Program  will  support  the \ninstitutional  reforms  and  training  for  ULB  staff  currently  being  conducted  under  the  ongoing  NNP. \nThe Investment Program is expected to (i) improve urban services for at least the 4.3 million people \nliving  in  the  initially  identified  25  ULBs;  (ii) improve  and  sustain  infrastructure  services  within  the \nparticipating  ULBs,  which  will  in  turn  benefit  the  agriculture,  industry,  and  tourism  sectors;  and \n(iii) introduce PSP in selected subsectors with the aim of introducing a proper incentive framework \nfor efficient and equitable service provision and linking the private sector\u2019s financial liquidity with the \nlarge requirements for investment in the urban sector. \n\nB. \n\n21. \n\nOutputs \nThe outputs of the Investment Program will be derived from the following components:8 \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n\ncomponent A: sanitation infrastructure, \ncomponent B: water supply infrastructure, \ncomponent C: slum improvement, \ncomponent D: nonmunicipal infrastructure, \ncomponent E: urban transport infrastructure, \ncomponent F: institutional development, and \ncomponent G: Investment Program assistance facility. \n\n \n22. \nComponents  A,  B,  C,  and  E  are  designed  to  address  the  basic  urban  sector  needs  of  the \nInvestment  Program  ULBs;  component  D  is  designed  to  incorporate  tourism  and  disaster \nmanagement  services  for  the  Investment  Program  ULBs;  component  F  is  designed  to  assist  with \ncapacity-building  initiatives  and  staff  training  requirements  in  the  Investment  Program  ULBs;  and \ncomponent G is designed to assist with implementation of the Investment Program. Except for the \nthree  ULBs\u2014Belgaum,  Gulbarga,  and  Hubli-Dharwad\u2014currently  being  assisted  under  the  World \nBank-funded  KUWASIP  and,  therefore,  not  expecting  any  financing  for  component  B  under  the \nInvestment  Program,  most  Investment  Program  ULBs  have  subprojects  under  components  A  and \nB,  i.e.,  most  of  the  investments  are  focused  on  the  provision  of  water  supply  and  sanitation \ninfrastructure. \n \n23. \nAll the initially identified 25 Investment Program ULBs are covered by the ongoing NNP. The \nreforms being implemented under the NNP will support the institutional framework under which the \nULBs  are  designing,  constructing,  operating,  and  maintaining  basic  urban  infrastructure  and \nservices.  These  reforms  may  still  be  ongoing  at  the  time  of  effectiveness  of  the  first  loan  and the \n\n                                                 \n8  Solid waste collection and disposal facilities and sports facilities are integral parts of GoK\u2019s investment plan; however, \n\nGoK has decided to finance these facilities using its own funds. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nInvestment  Program  may  have  to  be  implemented  in  parallel  with  the  reforms.  Hence,  the \nimplementation  of  reform  measures  (i.e.,  property  tax  reform  and  revenue  mobilization  measures) \nwill be closely monitored throughout the Investment Program. \n \n\n1. \n\nComponent A: Sanitation Infrastructure \n\n24. \nThis component comprises (i) sewerage and sanitation, which includes rehabilitation and/or \nexpansion of existing systems (sewer networks, sewage pumping stations, and sewage treatment \nplants), and construction of new systems; and (ii) urban drainage, which includes improvements to \nprimary and secondary drains. \n \n\n2. \n\nComponent B: Water Supply Infrastructure \n\n25. \nThis  component  comprises  (i)  the  rehabilitation  of  existing  systems,  that  is,  of  intakes, \ntreatment  plants,  transmission  mains,  and  distribution  networks  (including  mains  and  reservoirs); \nand (ii) the provision of new infrastructure, including expansions of the distribution network and the \nprovision  of  additional  house  connections  in  both  the  existing  and  expanded  service  areas  in  the \nInvestment Program ULBs. \n \n\n3. \n\nComponent C: Slum Improvement \n\nThis component will address the poor environmental conditions in low-income settlements. \n26. \nThe Investment Program aims to build on the successful experiences of the KUIDP and KUDCEMP \nwith  the  help  of  nongovernment  organizations.  The  subprojects  include  community  development \nprograms,  such  as  the  initiation  of  self-help  groups,  the  launching  of  health  and  sanitation \nawareness campaigns, and the provision of low-cost sanitation facilities to improve the environment \nin these settlements. \n \n\n4. \n\nComponent D: Nonmunicipal Infrastructure \n\nThis component focuses on such nonmunicipal infrastructure as firefighting and emergency \n\n27. \nservices, tourism, and lake rehabilitation in selected ULBs. \n \n\n5. \n\nComponent E: Urban Transport Infrastructure \n\n28. \nThis  component  comprises  improvements  to  the  urban  roads  of  the  public  works \ndepartments of the ULBs and the state. It involves improving and strengthening critical road links, \nroad  safety  measures,  and  traffic  management  measures.  Urban  transport  improvement  will  be \nundertaken  in  Investment  Program  ULBs  based  on  their  progress  with  regard  to  implementing \ncomponents A, B, and C under the Investment Program. \n \n\n6. \n\nComponent F: Institutional Development \n\n29. \nThis component will support the DMA\u2019s current institutional reform efforts under the NNP. It \nwill be managed by the DMA, and will consist of capacity building within Investment Program ULBs \nthrough \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nintroducing computerization, property tax assessment, and utility line mapping using \na geographic information system; \nfacilitating  the  transition  of  ULB  accounting  functions  to  the  fund-based  accounting \nsystem; and \nproviding  training  for  ULB  and  state  line  department  staff  in  relation  to  project \nimplementation and urban management. \n\n \n30. \nThe  training  will  include  courses  and  sessions  on  urban  management  to  be  conducted  by \ninstitutes like the Indian Institute of Management and the Indian Institute of Science. All seminars, \nconferences, and city visits to learn from best practices to be funded under the Investment Program \nshall take place in India. \n \n\n7. \n\nComponent G: Investment Program Assistance Facility \n\n31. \nThis  component  comprises  consulting  services  for  Investment  Program  implementation \nsupport, financing for the Program Management Unit (PMU), and incremental administration costs \nfor the KUIDFC and other agencies involved in implementing the Investment Program. Civil works \nfor the KUIDFC office building in Bangalore are also provided under this component. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n \n\n7 \n\n32. \nPrivate  Sector  Participation  Schemes.  In  addition  to  ADB\u2019s  conventional  procurement \nmodalities,  an  alternative  PSP  procurement  modality  referred  to  as  the  PBDPS  will  be  used  for \nselected subprojects in selected ULBs to increase the extent of PSP. This modality requires private \ncontractors to provide some of the bridge financing for the construction and subsequent O&M costs \nof the subprojects in exchange for annuity-like payments over a 10-year period that consist of base \nfees and bonuses linked to predetermined key performance indicators. The PBDPS is expected to \nhelp  (i) introduce  private  investment  into  the  sector,  thereby  facilitating  greater  leverage  of  public \nfunds;  and  (ii) achieve  higher  accountability  on  the  part  of  contractors  by  combining  construction \nand actual service delivery during the operational phase into a single contract package. \n \n33. \nAs the PBDPS is still at an early stage of development, the level of contractor interest is not \nyet  clear.  Should  the  risk-sharing  aspects  of  the  PBDPS  be  unpalatable  to  the  private  sector,  an \nalternative  PSP  modality,  the  PBMC,  will  be  used  instead.  Under  the  PBMC  modality,  civil  works \nare  procured  through  conventional  procurement  modalities  and  the  managing  contractor  is \nresponsible  for  overall  management  of  the  provision  of  services  and  the  O&M  of  the  facilities, \ntypically over a 5- to 6-year period. The management contractor will be also reimbursed by means \nof  base  fees  and  bonuses  linked  to  predetermined  key  performance  indicators.  The  best \nprocurement  modality  will  be  chosen  following  consultations  with  and  surveys  of  potential \ncontractors.  Lessons  from  the  PBDPS  and  PBMC  modalities  based  on  global  experience  with \nsimilar  contracting  approaches  by  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  development  agencies  and  their \napplication  in  India\u2019s  urban  sector  have  been  assessed  and  are  presented  in  Supplementary \nAppendix E. These lessons and the results of the consultations and surveys will be incorporated in \nthe contract documents. \n \n34. \nThe  intent  of  the  proposed  PSP  schemes  is  to  provide  optimal  risk-sharing  arrangements \nbetween  ULBs  and  private  contractors  and  to  create  an  incentive  framework  to  promote  private \nsector  efficiency  through  performance-based  and/or  output-based  service  provision  for  the \nsubprojects.  Appendixes  4  and  5  present  the  key  features  and  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the \nPBDPS contracts and the PBMC contracts, respectively, and Supplementary Appendix D presents \na more detailed description of the PBDPS contracts. \n \n35.  Multitranche  Financing  Facility. The Investment Program will use ADB\u2019s MFF. The MFF \nmodality is particularly well suited for the Investment Program because (i) the aim of the Investment \nProgram  is  to  support  the  GoK\u2019s  long-term  objectives  as  stated  in  the  HPC  report;  (ii)   the \nperformance of previous loans can guide the provision of subsequent loans, thereby offering proper \nincentives  in  relation  to  implementation;  (iii) the  implementation  period  for  urban  development \nprojects is generally longer than projects for other sectors, including the initial detailed design and \nengineering  period;  (iv) the  MFF  can  allow  the  flexibility  required  for  the  Investment  Program  to \nsupport participating 25 ULBs with different needs and absorptive capacities; and (v) the proposed \nperformance-based contract schemes require contract periods that are longer than the conventional \ncontract modality. \n \n36. \nThe subprojects and components under the first loan with an estimated cost of $51.4 million \n(ADB  financing  of  $33  million  and  a  GoK  contribution  of  $18.4  million)  were  fully  appraised  and \nincluded  in  the  first  periodic  financing  request  (PFR).  The  first  loan  covers  sanitation  and  water \nsupply infrastructure in 3 ULBs, firefighting equipment in 23 ULBs, tourism infrastructure in 6 ULBs, \ngeographic  information  systems  and  other  hardware  in  21  ULBs,  5  consultancy  packages, \nincremental  administration  costs,  and  the  KUIDFC  building.  No  PSP  contracts  will  be  financed \nunder the first loan, as further preparation for PSP contracts is required under the bridging technical \nassistance  (TA).  Each  individual  loan  will  finance  mutually  exclusive  distinctive  packages, \nsubprojects, and/or components. \n \n37. \nBridging  Technical  Assistance. The $400,000 in grant-funding for the bridging TA will be \nmade available under the TA Cluster for Project Processing and Capacity Development9 to support \n\n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2006.

This bridging TA will support GoK with Investment \nProgram  preparation,  including  (i) preparing  contract  documents  for  the  PBDPS,  the  PBMC,  and \nconventional  civil  work  contracts  and  associated  preparatory  work  needed  to  introduce  PSP \nschemes, including formulating post-PBDPS operations strategy and human resources strategy for \nexisting ULB employees who will be affected by the introduction of PBDPS contracts; (ii) preparing \na  business  plan  and  operational  procedures  for  the  KUIDFC  and  operations  manuals  for  the \nInvestment  Program  ULBs;  and  (iii)  undertaking  analysis  and  making  recommendations  on \nappropriate  water  and  sewerage  tariffs  for  the  Investment  Program  ULBs.  Outline  terms  of \nreference for this TA are in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n38. \nThe total cost of the Investment Program from 2006 to 2015 is $862 million out of which the \nidentified  investment  requirements  under  the  MFF  are  estimated  to  cost  $440  million  (Table  1). \nAppendix 6 presents indicative cost estimates for the MFF (estimated total costs of $440 million). \n \n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates for the Investment Program \n($ million) \n \n\nComponent \n\n($ million) \n\nShare (%) \n\nTotal Investment \nRequirements \n\nIdentified Investments \nunder Asian \nDevelopment Bank \nLoans ($ million) \n\nSanitation Infrastructure  \n\nA \nB  Water Supply Infrastructure \nC  Slum Improvement \nD  Nonmunicipal Infrastructure \nE  Urban Transport Infrastructure \nInstitutional Development \nF \nInvestment Program Assistance \nG \nFacilitya \n  Total Investment Program \n\n \n\n360 \n200 \n27 \n67 \n199 \n9 \n \n0 \n862 \n\n163 \n92 \n12 \n31 \n91 \n4 \n \n47 \n440 \n\n37 \n21 \n3 \n7 \n21 \n1 \n \n10 \n100 \n\na  For total investment requirements, the cost of component G is distributed among components A\u2013F. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates; High Power Committee Report for Redressal of Regional Imbalances. \n\nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n39. \nThe Government has requested financing up to $270 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the Investment Program. The financing will be provided under the \nMFF  in  accordance  with  ADB  policy.10 The  MFF  will  extend  multiple  loans  to  finance  a  range  of \nsubprojects and components under the Investment Program, subject to the submission of a related \nPFR  by  the  Government  and  the  execution  of  the  related  Loan  Agreement  and  Project \nAgreement(s). The Government has entered into an FFA with ADB and is required to comply with \nthe agreement\u2019s requirements. Pursuant to the FFA, the Government has submitted the first PFR in \nan  amount  of  $33  million  to  ADB.  The  loans  under  the  MFF  will  finance  civil  works,  equipment, \nconsulting  services,  training,  and  incremental  administration  costs.  The  minimum  amount  of \nsubsequent  PFRs  will  be  $50  million.  All  provisions  of  ordinary  operations  loan  regulations \napplicable  to  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  loans11 will  apply  to  each  loan, \nsubject  to  modifications,  if  any,  that  may  be  included  under  any  loan  and  project  agreement.  The \nGovernment has the option to choose between eligible currencies and the interest rate regime for \neach  loan.  The  specific  terms  of  each  loan  will  be  based  on  the  related  PFR,  with  interest  to  be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility. The Government has provided \nADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, and \n\n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2005.

Such \ncofinancing may benefit from ADB credit enhancements, including ADB guarantee instruments, and \nwill be presented separately for Board consideration as and when the need arises. \n \n41. \nThe Government will onlend the proceeds of the loans under the MFF to GoK on the same \nterms and conditions as the ADB loans. The financing plan for the Investment Program is presented \nin Table 2 and the details are presented in Appendix 6. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan of the Investment Program \n($ million) \n \n\nIdentified \nInvestments under \nAsian Development \nBank Loans \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGoK and other agencies \n\nTotal \n\n($ million) \n270 \n170 \n440 \n\nShare (%) \n  61 \n  39 \n100 \n\nGoK = Government of Karnataka. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n42. \nGoK will pass on the proceeds of the loans to the implementing agencies in a mix of loans \nand grants based on the agreed arrangements for the subsectors. The loans will be provided for the \nwater supply subprojects, and have a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years, and the \ninterest  rate  will  be  determined  in  accordance  with  the  incentive  scheme  adopted  by  GoK  to \nencourage  the  ULBs  to  implement  reforms.  The  implementing  agencies  will  make  required \ncontributions  either  from  their  own  resources  or  from  the  State  Finance  Commission\u2019s  allocations \nfor the respective implementing agencies. GoK will assume the foreign exchange risks on the ADB \nloans. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nInvestment Program Management \n\n43. \nThe executing agency for the Investment Program will be GoK acting through the KUIDFC. \nThe KUIDFC is a fully state-owned company that was incorporated in 1993 under the Companies \nAct (1956). As a nodal agency for urban infrastructure projects financed by GoK, the KUIDFC has \nalready  successfully  implemented  the  first  ADB-assisted  project,  the  KUIDP,  and  is  now \nimplementing  the  second  ADB-assisted  project,  KUDCEMP.  In  addition  to  being  the  project \nmanager, the KUIDFC will act as a conduit of funds between GoK, which will disburse the ADB loan \nfunds to the ULBs via the KUIDFC, and the ULBs which will repay agreed portions of the ADB loan \nfunds  to  GoK  via  the  KUIDFC.  Supplementary  Appendix  A  provides  detailed  information  on  the \nroles,  the  capabilities,  and  a  financial  assessment  of  the  KUIDFC,  GoK,  and  the  Investment \nProgram ULBs. \n \n44. \nThe head office of the KUIDFC, in coordination with its regional office based in Dharwad, will \nconstitute the PMU for the Investment Program. The PMU will be headed by the managing director \nof the KUIDFC as the program director at the head office and by the executive program director12 at \nthe regional office who reports to the program director. The program director will be responsible for \noverall implementation and management of the Investment Program and for coordination with and \nreporting to the state-level empowered committee for the Investment Program, which is made up of \n\n                                                 \n12 The executive program director will be an officer from the Indian Administrative Service. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nrepresentatives  of  GoK,  the  Government,  and  ADB,  while  the  executive  program  director  will  be \nresponsible  for  day-to-day  implementation  activities  for  the  Investment  Program.  The  PMU\u2019s \nregional  office  will  be  staffed  with  properly  qualified  and  sufficiently  experienced  experts  and \nofficials and will include divisions related to engineering, community development, accounting and \nfinance, land acquisition, and administration. \n \nFour divisional PMU offices will be established in Belgaum, Bellary, Dharwad, and Gulbarga \n45. \nto supervise the implementing agencies in each geographical area.13 Each divisional office will be \nheaded  by  a  divisional  program  director14 who  will  report  to  the  executive  program  director.  The \ndivisional  offices,  assisted  by  the  respective  program  consultant  teams,  will  be  responsible  for \nproject  planning,  preparation  of  subprojects  and  cost  estimates,  coordination,  technical  guidance \nand supervision, financial control, training, and overall subproject monitoring; and will also assist the \nULBs in this regard for the respective components. \n \n46. \nThe  implementing  agencies  under  the  Investment  Program  will  be  as  follows:  (i) for \ncomponents  A,  B,  and  E:  the  respective  ULBs 15  reporting  to  the  respective  divisional  program \ndirector, except for bulk water supply schemes of component B, for which the implementing agency \nwill  be  the  Karnataka  Urban  Water  Supply  and  Drainage  Board  (KUWSDB),  on  behalf  of  the \nrespective ULBs, reporting to the respective divisional program director;16 (ii) for component C: the \nKarnataka Slum Clearance Board reporting to the executive program director; (iii) for component D: \nthe  Department  of  Information,  Tourism  and  Youth  Services,  the  Karnataka  State  Fire  and \nEmergency  Services,  the  Lake  Development  Authority,  and  relevant  ULBs  reporting  to  the \nexecutive  program  director;  (iv) for  component  F:  the  DMA  and/or  the  KUIDFC  reporting  to  the \nprogram  director;  and  (v) for  component  G:  the  KUIDFC  reporting  to  the  program  director.  ULBs \nintending  to  delegate  the  implementation  responsibilities  of  bulk  water  supply  schemes  to  the \nKUWSDB  are  required  to  pass  relevant  resolutions.  Tender  evaluation  committees  to  evaluate \ntenders  and  provide  recommendations  on  issues  related  to  all  works  that  will  subsequently  be \nforwarded for approval to the ULB commissioner will be set up. Each tender evaluation committee \nwill  consist  of  a  ULB  engineer,  a  representative  of  the  KUIDFC,  and  a  member  of  the  program \nconsultant team with relevant expertise. \n \n47. \nA state-level empowered committee has been formed to oversee the Investment Program. \nCommittee  members  include  the  additional  chief  secretary  (the  committee  chair),  the  principal \nsecretary  of  the  Urban  Development  Department,  the  principal  secretary  of  the  Planning \n\n                                                 \n13 Coverage by the four divisional offices will be as follows: (i) Belgaum: Badami, Ilkal, Jamkhandi, and Rabkavi-Banhatti \n(Bagalkot  District),  and  Belgaum,  Gokak,  and  Nippani  (Belgaum  District);  (ii) Bellary:  Bellary  and  Hospet  (Bellary \nDistrict),  Gangavathi  and  Koppal  (Koppal  District),  and  Raichur  and  Sindhanoor  (Raichur  District);  (iii) Dharwad: \nChamarajnagar  (Chamarajnagar  District),  Davangere  (Davangere  District),  Hubli-Dharwad  (Dharwad  District),  Gadag-\nBetageri  (Gadag-Betageri  District),  and  Haveri  and  Ranebennur  (Haveri  District);  (iv) Gulbarga:  Basavakalyan  and \nBidar (Bidar District); Bijapur (Bijapur District), and Gulbarga, Shahabad and Yadgir (Gulbarga District). The divisional \noffice in Dharwad will be attached to the PMU\u2019s regional office. The program consultant for Dharwad will therefore will \nperform some additional functions relative to the other three program consultants. \n\n14 The divisional program directors will be officers from the Karnataka Administrative Service or the Karnataka Municipal \n\nAdministrative Service. \n\n15 The  initially  selected  Investment  Program  ULBs  are  (i) 4  city  corporations  (Belgaum,  Bellary,  Gulbarga,  and  Hubli-\nDharwad);  (ii) 14  city  municipality  councils  (Bidar,  Bijapur,  Chamarajnagar,  Davangere,  Gadag-Betageri,  Gangavathi, \nGokak,  Haveri,  Hospet,  Koppal,  Nippani,  Rabkavi-Banhatti,  Raichur,  and  Ranebennur);  (iii) 6  town  municipalities \n(Basavakalyan, Ilkal, Jamkhandi, Shahabad, Sindhanoor, and Yadgir;) and (iv) 1 town panchayat, which is the smallest \nULB category of the four (Badami). \n\n16 Even though the provision of basic urban infrastructure and services, including water supply, became a mandate of the \nULBs under the 74th Amendment Act to the Constitution of India, most ULBs in north Karnataka have yet to develop \nsufficient  capacity  to  carry  out  this  mandate.  In  Karnataka,  expertise  in  this  sector  has  been  accumulated  primarily \nwithin  the  KUWSDB    because,  under  the  act  that  established  it,  this  agency  had  monopoly  power  in  relation  to  the \nplanning, preparation, and execution of all water supply and sewerage asset creation schemes above a certain value. \nIn  addition,  bulk  water  supply  schemes  under  the  Investment  Program  cross  ULB  boundaries.  Considering  these \nfactors, it was agreed between GoK and ADB to include the KUWSDB as an implementing agency for bulk water supply \nschemes on behalf of concerned ULBs. From a contractual viewpoint, contracts for bulk water supply schemes will be \nsigned  between  the  KUWSDB  and  the  contractor,  while  ones  for  water  supply  distribution  schemes  and  sewerage \nschemes will be signed between individual ULBs and the contractor. In addition, for PSP schemes, tripartite contracts \nwill be signed by the ULB, the contractor, and the KUIDFC.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\nthe \n\nInvestment  Program  and  decide  on  major \n\nDepartment,  the  secretary  for  Municipalities  and  Urban  Development  Authorities  of  the  Urban \nDevelopment Department, the secretary for expenditure of the Finance Department, the director of \nthe  Directorate  of  Municipal  Administration,  and  the  managing  director  of  the  KUIDFC  (the \ncommittee secretary). The empowered committee will meet every quarter to review the performance \nof \nfunding, \nimplementation  bottlenecks,  land  disputes,  and  special  procurement.  Furthermore,  district-level \nprogram  steering  committees  have  been  formed  in  each  of  the  13  districts  to  monitor  the \nimplementation of subprojects and institutional reforms in the Investment Program ULBs, as well as \nto  coordinate  between  various  agencies  regarding  approvals  and  clearances.  Each  district-level \nprogram steering committee, which reports to the executive program director, is made up of deputy \ncommissioner  of  the  district  (who  serves  as  the  chair),  divisional  program  director  from  the \nconcerned  divisional  office,  municipal  commissioners  or  chief  officers  of  the  Investment  Program \nULBs,  and  presidents  or  chairs  of  the  Investment  Program  ULBs.  Appendix  7  shows  the \norganizational arrangements for implementation of the Investment Program. \n \n\nissues,  such  as  counterpart \n\n2. \n\nSubproject Appraisal and Approval \n\nIdentification,  appraisal,  and  approval  of  subprojects  under  the  Investment  Program  will \n\n48. \nfollow the steps outlined in the following paragraphs. \n \nSubproject Identification and Selection. Twenty-five ULBs have been initially selected for \n49. \nthe Investment Program. With the assistance of the KUIDFC, each of these ULBs has prepared a \nCLIP that identifies the gaps between current and target levels of urban infrastructure, estimates the \ninterventions required to fill the gaps, and proposes subprojects in components A\u2013E to be funded \nunder  the  Investment  Program.  The  25  Investment  Program  ULBs  sent  the  CLIPs  through  the \nKUIDFC to the empowered committee, which subsequently approved them. ADB then reviewed the \nCLIPs. Any additional ULB that wishes to be included in the Investment Program will have to follow \nthe same procedures. All the subprojects proposed for funding should meet the subproject selection \ncriteria (Appendix 3). ADB will also review the CLIPs of additional ULBs to ensure their compliance \nwith the provisions of the framework financing agreement. \n \n50. \nSubproject  Appraisal  and  Approval  and  Submission  of  PFRs.  The  KUIDFC  will  be \nresponsible for detailed appraisal of the subprojects with the assistance of the program consultants. \nThe  KUIDFC  will  prepare  a  summary  subproject  appraisal  report  based  on  the  CLIPs  that  will \ninclude  the  rationale  for  each  subproject,  the  scope  and  components,  a  technical  description  and \nanalysis, the cost estimates and financing plan, an environmental assessment, a resettlement plan, \nan  indigenous  peoples  development  plan,  and  the  implementation  arrangements  along  with \nfinancial, economic, and institutional analyses. All the summary subproject appraisal reports will be \nsent  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval  in  a  format  agreed  on  by  GoK  and  ADB.  If  necessary,  ADB \nmay  advise  the  KUIDFC  to  modify  the  subproject  appraisal  reports.  Following  ADB  approval,  and \nsubject  to  any  modifications  and  measures  required  by  ADB,  the  KUIDFC  and  GoK  will  prepare \nPFRs for ADB financing. PFRs will be formally submitted to ADB for further processing through the \nGovernment. \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n51. \nThe  Investment  Program  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  8  years  from  2006  to  2015 \n(Appendix 8). Advance contracting for first loan will be undertaken before the effectiveness of the \nfirst  loan.  Civil  works  and  equipment  purchases  included  under  the  first  loan,  in  particular,  civil \nworks for fully appraised subprojects for three ULBs (Haveri, Hospet, and Raichur) are expected to \ncommence  immediately  on  effectiveness  of  the  first  loan  by  taking  advantage  of  advance \ncontracting and retroactive financing. \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n52. \nProcurement of all goods and services under the Investment Program will be undertaken in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines as amended from time to time. Contracts for civil \nworks estimated to cost $10 million or more will be procured using international competitive bidding \n(ICB) procedures. Contracts estimated to cost less than $10 million will be procured under national \ncompetitive bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to ADB. To the extent possible, the procurement \nof  goods  will  be  grouped  into  packages  larger  than  $1  million  to  be  suitable  for  ICB  procedures. \nMiscellaneous goods that cannot be grouped into larger contracts and cost less than $1 million per \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\ncontract will be procured through limited international bidding or NCB procedures. Minor items that \ncost  less  than  the  equivalent  of  $100,000  per  contract  may  be  purchased  through  shopping \nprocedures.  Appendix  9  shows  the  procurement  plan  and  indicative  procurement  packaging.  The \nAppraisal Mission, with the KUIDFC, reviewed GoK\u2019s standard bidding documents and procurement \nprocedures that were used for NCB (civil works and goods) and limited international bidding (goods) \nunder ADB\u2019s previous loan and found them to be consistent with ADB requirements. The KUIDFC \nwill furnish further modifications it requires, together with justifications, to ADB for its no objection. \nNecessary  provisions  and  detailed  procedures  for  the  Investment  Program  will  be  incorporated  in \nthe facility administration memorandum.17 \n \n53. \nThe  KUIDFC  has  proposed  carrying  out  the  tendering  for  the  subprojects  under  the \nInvestment  Program  electronically,  as  permitted  under  the  Information  Technology  Act  of  India \n(2000).  A  demonstration  was  conducted  during  the  Appraisal  Mission,  and  the  proposed  system \nwas  found  to  be  generally  acceptable  to  ADB  (http://www.tenderwizard.com).  E-tendering  for  the \nInvestment  Program  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  and  E-bidding  Requirements  for \nMDB  [Multilateral  Development  Banks]  Loans,  Grants,  and  Credits.  The  program  consultants  will \ndevelop specifics of e-tendering to be adopted with required customization, which will be submitted \nto  ADB  for  its  no  objection.  E-tendering  should  start  with  simple  contracts  that  are  easy  to  define \nand  specify,  for  example,  water  meter  procurement,  to  be  expanded  further  in  consultation  with \nADB. \n \n54. \nSubprojects under the PSP modality (the PBDPS and PBMCs) will be procured, in principle, \nthrough  performance-based  procurement  procedures  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines.  The  Use  of  a  two-stage  bidding  procedure  to  be  preceded  by  prequalification  is \nproposed for recruiting private contractors under these modalities. For tendering PBDPS contracts, \nthe first stage will involve an evaluation of technical proposals, which, if necessary, will be revised \nto fit specified requirements by means of clarification between the employer and the bidders. The \nfirst-stage  technical  proposal  clarification  is  to  be  followed  by  the  issuance  of  amended  bidding \ndocuments and the submission of final technical proposals and priced bids in the second stage. The \nselection of the contractor will be based on the minimum annuity payment, which also reflects the \nlifetime cost approach. More details of the proposed procedures are shown in Appendix 4. \n \n55. \nPBDPS contracts account for the capital investment segment for initial civil works and the 10 \nyears\u2019  O&M  segment.  Thus  the  ICB  and  NCB  threshold  of  $10  million  will  be  applied  to  the \nestimated  capital  investment  cost  component.  Notwithstanding  this  arrangement,  the  KUIDFC  will \nstart procurement of the first PBDPS contract for the water supply and sewerage component under \nICB  procedures  regardless  of  the  estimated  cost  for  the  capital  investment  segment.  All  PBDPS \ncontracts  are  subject  to  prior  approval  by  ADB  for  subprojects  and  a  full  procurement  review \nprocess regardless of the estimated costs of their capital investment segments and whether ICB or \nNCB procedures are adopted. \n \n56. \nFor  PBDPS  contracts,  payment  can  be  in  local  currency.  Payment  in  local  currency  is \nsensible,  because  revenues  for  these  subprojects  will  be  in  local  currency  and  the  contracts  are \nsubstantially longer than ordinary civil works contracts. Furthermore, private contractors, including \ninternationally  affiliated  companies,  present  at  the  PSP  workshop  conducted  during  the  Appraisal \nMission did not object to this proposal,. This possibility should be clearly emphasized in the bidding \ndocuments. \n \n57. \nThe recruitment of management contractors will be carried out under ADB's  Guidelines on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  as  amended  from  time  to  time.  Like  PBDPS  contracts,  PBMCs  for \nsubprojects  are  required  to  have  ADB\u2019s  prior  approval  and  to  undergo  a  full  procurement  review \nprocess. For the recruitment of management contractors, ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection \nprocedures  will  generally  be  followed  with  suitable  modifications.  A  two-stage  procedure  is \nproposed. The first stage will be for the preparation of a shortlist of well-qualified potential bidders \namong  those  who  submitted  expressions  of  interest  in  response  to  an  advertisement.  The \nshortlisted companies or consortia will then be invited to submit second-stage proposals containing \ndetailed technical plans for the improvements to and operation of the water supply and sewerage \n                                                 \n17 In  particular,  the  facility  administration  memorandum  will  incorporate  provisions  for  smoothly  and  expeditiously \n\ncompleting the balance of works in the case of failure of initial civil works contracts. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13 \n\nsystems  together  with  financial  proposals  in  line  with  the  request  for  proposals  documents.  More \ndetails of the proposed procedures are shown in Appendix 5. With ADB assistance, the bridging TA \nconsultants  (footnote  8)  will  develop  respective  sets  of  requests  for  proposals  and  draft  contract \ndocuments  for  the  PBDPS  and  PBMC  modalities  based  on  lessons  from  global  experiences  with \nsimilar contracting approaches. The bridging TA consultants will be recruited under TA 4814\u2013IND. \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n58. \nConsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  using  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nprocedures and/or least cost selection procedures in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof  Consultants.  Consulting  services  will  be  provided  in  five  packages.  Four  national  firms  will  be \nengaged  as  the  program  consultants,  corresponding  to  the  four  divisional  offices  under  the  PMU. \nThe  program  consultants  will  assist  the  respective  PMU  offices  with  overall  project  management \nand implementation and will help the implementing agencies carry out detailed engineering design, \nprocurement,  and  quality  control.  The  program  consultants  for  the  divisional  office  based  in \nDharwad  will  serve  both  the  PMU  regional  office  and  the  divisional  office.  Thus  this  program \nconsultant team will include a transaction adviser (or advisers) (6 person-months) with both Indian \nand international experience in PSP to facilitate the recruitment of PBDPS and PBMC contractors, \nparticularly  in  the  water supply  and sewerage  subsectors,  for  the  entire  Investment  Program.  The \nestimated  staffing  requirement  for  the  four  program  consultant  packages  is  about  1,700  person-\nmonths.  A  full  technical  proposal  will  be  required  for  firms  bidding  for  the  program  consultant \npackages. The KUIDFC has proposed the use of a single shortlist for the four program consultant \npackages. Any one firm on the shortlist will be allowed to submit bids for a maximum of any two of \nthe four program consultant packages and may be awarded a maximum of two packages based on \nthe evaluation of its bids. This selection mechanism is almost the same as that used under the two \nprevious  ADB-assisted  projects.  For  this  selection  arrangement,  a  shortlist  of  six  firms  is  deemed \nappropriate  to  ensure  sufficient  competition  for  each  of  the  four  packages.  Performance-based \ncontract is used for the program consultants and hence payments to the program consultants are \nlinked to clearly defined deliverables as shown in Supplementary Appendix P. \n \n59. \nOne national firm will be engaged as the program performance monitoring system (PPMS) \nconsultant  to  help  the  PMU  generate  baseline  data,  provide  midcourse  corrections,  and  track  the \nInvestment Program\u2019s benefits. The estimated staffing requirement for the PPMS will be 80 person-\nmonths  (national).  A  biodata  proposal  will  be  used  for  selecting  the  consultants  for  the  PPMS. \nOutline terms of reference for consulting packages are in Supplementary Appendix P. \n \n\n6. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\nADB management has approved (i) the use of advance action to recruit consultants and to \n60. \nprocure  goods  and  civil  works;  and  (ii) the  request  to  seek  the  approval  of  ADB\u2019s  Board  for \nretroactive financing for each of the individual loans under the MFF. Advance action is necessary to \nexpedite  start-up  of  the  Investment  Program  and  its  continuous,  smooth  implementation,  and \nretroactive  financing  will  ease  GoK\u2019s  budgetary  constraints,  especially  during  the  start-up  period. \nRetroactive  financing  covers  up  to  20%  of  each  individual  loan  amount  for  eligible  expenditures \nincurred  during  the  12  months  before  the  signing  of  the  corresponding  loan  agreement. 18 The \nGovernment  and  GoK  have  been  advised  that  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  advance  contracting  and \nretroactive financing does not constitute a commitment to finance the relevant expenditures under \nthe Investment Program. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n61. \nEach  PFR  will  result  in  a  separate  loan  agreement,  which  will  describe  the  detailed \ndisbursement  arrangements  agreed  between  the  Government  and  ADB.  Loan  disbursements  will \nbe  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and  Interim  Guidelines  for \nDisbursement  Operations,  LIBOR-Based  Loan  Product,  as  updated  from  time  to  time.  Each  loan \nwill have its own imprest account. GoK will also establish a second-generation imprest account for \neach  loan,  if  necessary  or  required,  in  a  non  interest-bearing  current  account  with  a  commercial \n\n                                                 \n18 This  is  in  accordance  with  ADB.  2005.  Cost  Sharing  and  Eligibility  of  Expenditures  for  Asian  Development  Bank \n\nFinancing: A New Approach. Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nbank.  The  amount  at  any  given  time  in  the  imprest  account  and  the  second-generation  imprest \naccount  shall  be  equivalent  to  6  months  of  estimated  expenditures  or  10%  of  the  related  loan \namount,  whichever  is  lower.  The  imprest  account  and  the  second-generation  imprest  account  will \nbe established, managed, and liquidated in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook \nas  updated  from  time  to  time.  The  statement  of  expenditures  will  be  used  to  reimburse  any \nindividual payments not exceeding a certain amount to be determined for each loan. \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n62. \nThe  KUIDFC  has  a  satisfactory  financial  management  and  accounting  system.  Its  Finance \nDivision has adequate resources, including a financial management manual that clearly documents \nits  financial  and  accounting  policies  and  procedures.  The  KUIDFC  follows  an  accrual-based, \ndouble-entry  bookkeeping  system,  and  its  accounting  standards  are  those  promulgated  by  the \nInstitute of Chartered Accountants of India. Its account books are computerized and are maintained \nby project and by funding agency. The audit of accounting of he GoK and KUIDFC are carried out \nby  the  Comptroller  and  Auditor  General  of  India.  The  Internal  Audit  Division  of  the  KUIDFC \ncoordinates  its  annual  statutory  audit  of  financial  statements  to  be  carried  out  by  chartered \naccountants appointed by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India as prescribed under Article \n619  of  the  Companies  Act  (1956).  More  details  on  the  KUIDFC\u2019s  accounting  and  auditing \nprocedures are presented in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n63. \nFor  the  Investment  Program,  the  PMU  and  the  implementing  agencies  will  establish  and \nmaintain separate accounts and records adequate to identify the goods and services financed from \nthe  loan  proceeds,  the  expenditures  incurred  from  the  Investment  Program  components  and  their \nsubprojects under each individual project, and the use of local funds under each individual project. \nIndependent  auditors  will  audit  these  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  annually  in \naccordance  with  international  auditing  standards.  Within  9  months  of  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year, \nGoK  will  submit  consolidated  annual  audited  reports  and  related  financial  statements  for  each \nindividual project to ADB. The auditors\u2019 opinion of that part of the examination relating to the imprest \naccounts and statements of expenditure should be separately set out in the auditors\u2019 opinion.  \n \n64. \nThe  PMU  is  responsible  for  providing  ADB  with  quarterly  progress  reports  on  the \nimplementation of each individual project within 45 days of the end of each quarter. The progress \nreports  will  cover  progress  made  during  the  period  of  review;  changes  to  the  implementation \nschedule,  if  any;  problems  or  difficulties  encountered  and  remedial  actions  taken;  and  work  to  be \nundertaken and subprojects and/or components to be proposed for financing in the coming quarter. \nThe  reports  will  also  include  a  summary  financial  account  for  each  implementing  agency, \nexpenditures to date, and a report on benefit monitoring. Based on the quarterly progress reports, \nADB  will  prepare  annual  implementation  progress  reports  to  be  submitted  to  the  Board  each \nDecember.  The  PMU  will  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report  within  3  months  of  physical \ncompletion  of  the  subprojects  financed  under  each  loan  and  an  MFF  completion  report  within  3 \nmonths  of  physical  completion  of  the  subprojects  under  the  MFF.  These  reports  will  describe  the \ndetails  of  implementation,  costs,  monitoring  and  evaluation  results,  problems  encountered  and \nactions taken, and other relevant information that ADB may request.  \n \n\n9. \n\nAnticorruption Policy and Governance Measures \n\n65. \nADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  KUIDFC.  Consistent \nwith its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right \nto investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive \npractices relating to the Investment Program. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s \nanticorruption  policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the \nInvestment Program. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Investment \nProgram  shall  include  provisions  specifying  ADB\u2019s  right  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and \naccounts of the KUIDFC and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as \nthey relate to the Investment Program. \n \nthe \nfinancial  management  capacity \n66. \nimplementation of two earlier ADB projects is expected to mitigate the risks of corruption under the \nInvestment  Program.  The  adoption  of  the  PSP  modality,  which  would  bring  in  competent  private \nparties  who  will  be  held  accountable  for  clearly  identified  outputs  in  a  comprehensive  manner,  is \nexpected  to  further  mitigate  the  risks  of  corruption.  Furthermore,  all  the  PSP  contracts  will  be \n\nThe  KUIDFC's  strong \n\nit  gained \n\nthrough \n\nthat \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15 \n\nsubject to technical auditing by independent auditors. GoK\u2019s NNP, which is to be supported under \nthe  Investment  Program,  is  designed  to  improve  governance  at  the  ULB  level,  in  particular,  by \nintroducing  transparent  accounting  systems  and  publishing  municipal  information  on  ULBs\u2019  web \nsites.19 The  ULB  web  sites  provide  access  to  the  public  grievance  redress  system,  which  can  be \nused  for  handling  grievances  related  to  the  Investment  Program.  GoK  will  disclose  various \ninformation  about  the  Investment  Program  on  the  KUIDFC  web  site  and  the  respective  ULB  web \nsites  as  appropriate,  including  procurement-related  information,  financial  statements,  and  physical \nprogress.  With  regard  to  procurement,  the  web  sites  will  disclose  lists  of  participating  bidders, \nnames  of  winning  bidders,  basic  details  of  the  bidding  procedures  adopted,  contract  values,  and \nlists  of  goods  and  services  procured.  In  addition,  the  e-tendering  proposed  for  selected \nprocurement is expected to enhance fair, transparent, and efficient bidding procedures. \n \n\n10. \n\nProgram Performance Monitoring System \n\n67. \nThe PMU will ensure that a PPMS satisfactory to ADB is established within 3 months of the \neffectiveness of the first loan under the MFF. The PPMS will monitor and evaluate the performance \nof  the  Investment  Program,  as  well  as  of  subprojects  under  each  loan,  including  key  impact  and \noutcome  indicators  and  associated  assumptions  with  corresponding  target  dates.  For  subprojects \nunder  the  PBPDS  and  PBMC  modalities,  key  performance  indicators  satisfactory  to  ADB  will  be \ndeveloped during the preparation of requests for proposals and draft contract documents for each \nsubproject.  To  monitor  the  key  performance  indicators,  for  each  PDBPS  contract  and  PBMC,  the \nKUIDFC will propose three program consultant teams not directly involved in the geographical area \nconcerned as independent auditor candidates. The private contractor concerned will be allowed to \nselect a preferred candidate from the list of the three that will be employed by the KUIDFC. \n \n\n11. \n\nInvestment Program Review \n\n68. \nBased on a review of quarterly progress reports, ADB and GoK representatives will meet as \nrequired  to  discuss  the  progress  of  the  Investment  Program  under  each  loan,  any  changes  to \nimplementation  arrangements,  or  remedial  measures  required  to  be  undertaken  to  achieve  the \noverall objectives of specific subprojects and components and of the overall Investment Program. \n \n69. \nIn addition to regular reviews, including a midterm review for each loan, a detailed midterm \nreview of the Investment Program will be undertaken within a certain period of the effective date as \nagreed  under  the  first  loan  agreement  by  ADB  and  the  Government.  The  midterm  review  will \ninclude  a  detailed  evaluation  of \nimplementation \narrangements,  any  outstanding  issues,  environment,  resettlement  and  other  safeguard  issues, \nachievement of scheduled targets, progress with PSP contracts, and other issues, as appropriate. \n \n\nInvestment  Program, \n\nthe  scope  of \n\nthe \n\nIV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n70. \nThe economic analysis reviewed the following 10 areas for the Investment Program: (i) the \nrationale  for  government  involvement;  (ii) the  goals  of  the  HPC  report\u2019s  investment  plan;  (iii) the \nsector  development  plan;  (iv) the  associated  economic  policies;  (v) the  economic  risks;  (vi) GoK\u2019s \ncapacity;  (vii) the  fiscal  impacts;  (viii) GoK\u2019s  commitment;  (ix) the  coordination  of  foreign  aid;  and \n(x) the conditions attached to the loans. Supplementary Appendix F presents the detailed economic \nanalysis. The economic rationale for government intervention is sound, as the Investment Program \nsupports  only  the  ULBs\u2019  constitutionally  mandated  functions,  which  are  related  to  basic  public \nservices characterized by monopolistic conditions, externality management, and protection of public \ngoods.  The  goals  of  accelerating  economic  growth  in  north  Karnataka  and  reducing  regional \nimbalances within the state are well conceived as the state\u2019s priority through wide consultation. The \nInvestment Program is the least-cost approach to realizing that goal by focusing investments in the \nurban  sector,  as  urban  areas  drive  the  region\u2019s  economic  growth  by  attracting  private  investment \nand  industry.  The  economic  viability  of  subprojects  is  ensured  by  applying  economic  selection \ncriteria  developed  for  the  Investment  Program.  The  Investment  Program  fits  in  well  with  and \n                                                 \n19 Each ULB\u2019s web site is operational with the support of the eGovernments Foundation. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\ncomplements  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  promote  performance-  and  reform-linked  urban \ninfrastructure development in India, as embodied in its 10th five-year plan, in the Jawarharlal Nehru \nNational  Urban  Renewal  Mission,  and  in  the  Urban  Infrastructure  Development  in  Small  and \nMedium Towns. The Investment Program seeks financing from different sources, including central \nGovernment  fund,  state  funds,  and  World  Bank  loans.  In  particular,  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Karnataka \nMunicipal  Reform  Project  supports  the  urban  development  plans  of  ULBs  that  are  not  covered \nunder the ADB financing in a modality consistent with the Investment Program. As a nodal agency \nfor  urban  infrastructure projects  financed  by  GoK,  the  KUIDFC  is  capable  of  coordinating  multiple \nprojects at the state level to make efficient use of available resources. \n \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n71. \nThe financial operating plans for all 25 initially identified Investment Program ULBs examine \nwhether  the  ULBs  can  absorb  the  respective  subprojects  in  relation  to  equity  contributions,  O&M \ncosts, and debt-service repayments. According to the financial operating plans, 13 of the 25 ULBs \nhave  demonstrated  that  their  municipal  cash  flows  would  be  sufficient  to  meet  the  additional \nexpenditures  resulting  from  the  Investment  Program,  as  their  projected  closing  balances  are \npositive.  The  other  12  should  propose  a  financial  improvement  action  plan  for  sustaining  the \nimproved urban services resulting from the Investment Program before they can start implementing \nthe respective subprojects. The financial analysis is presented in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n72. \nFinancial  projections  were  also  undertaken  for  revenue-generating  subprojects  in  three \nrepresentative  ULBs  to  examine  the  financial  viability  of  individual  subprojects.  Tariff  levels  are \ncurrently low, but raising tariffs substantially before realizing actual improvements in urban services \nis  difficult.  Hence  the  financial  internal  rates  of  return  for  water  supply  and  sewerage  subprojects \nare estimated to be lower than the weighted average cost of capital of 2.5% for all three ULBs. GoK \nis,  however,  committed  to  restructuring  water  tariffs  and  introducing  sewerage  tariffs,  and  has \nalready  initiated  the  necessary  studies  and  surveys.  In  particular,  ADB  will  help  GoK  develop \nsewerage  tariffs  for  the  Investment  Program  ULBs  under  the  bridging  TA.  The  financial \nsustainability of subprojects in each ULB is expected to rely on ULBs\u2019 general revenue mobilization \nefforts, especially property tax increases, which will be assisted by the Investment Program. \n \n\n3. \n\nPoverty Reduction and Social Development \n\nThe  Investment  Program  will  result  in  wider  access  to  and  sustainable  improved  quality  of \n73. \nurban infrastructure and services in Investment Program ULBs. The resulting benefits are upgraded \nprovision of basic needs, enhanced living conditions, and improved public health. Baseline surveys \nindicate that the poor suffer more than the average population from poor-quality urban infrastructure \nand services in north Karnataka.20 Benefits from the sanitation component are expected to accrue \nto  households  connected  to  the  sewerage  network.  Networks  will  be  provided  in  densely  built-up \ncore  and  unserved  or  underserved  areas.  Sewerage  networks  will  reach  the  boundaries  of  slum \nareas,  which  will  enable  connection  by  a  large  number  of  households  and  provide  sewered,  low-\ncost  toilets.  The  benefits  to  poor  households  from  the  urban  transport  component  will  be  derived \nfrom  employment  generation  and  access.  Water  supply  will  benefit  all  Investment  Program  ULB \npopulations.  The  Investment  Program  will  also  result  in  broader  benefits  to  the  poor,  including \neconomic  growth  and  employment  generation.  In  addition,  the  slum  improvement  component  will \nresult in community development in poor areas. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy \nis in Appendix 10. \n \nCommunity  development  is  a  key  objective  of  the  slum  improvement  component. \n74. \nCommunity  development  programs \nthrough \nin  poor  communities, \nnongovernment  organizations,  will  focus  on  health  and  sanitation  awareness,  low-cost  sanitation \ninfrastructure,  and  self-help  groups  for  women.  The  programs  are  hinged  on  community \n                                                 \n20 Fewer than 30% of households in north Karnataka have access to water connections, and in slum areas, the figure is \nless than 10%. More than 75% of slum dwellers in north Karnataka ULBs such as Bellary, Gagad-Betageri, Gulbarga, \nKoppal,  and  Rabkavi-Banhatti    and  45%  to  60%  in  Badami,  Basavakalyan,  Davangere,  Gokak,  Raichur,  and  Yadgir \ndepend on standposts. The slum populations also receive lower water pressure delivered less frequently and for shorter \ndurations  compared  with  the  general  population.  More  than  85%  of  slum  households  completely  lack  access  to  safe \nsanitation.  Slum  households  in  16  of  the  25  Investment  Program  ULBs  reported  a  lack  of  access  to  underground \ndrainage connections. Surveys also show that more than 60% of slum dwellers in the Investment Program ULBs report \npoor access to roads. \n\nimplemented \n\nto  be \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17 \n\nparticipation. A participation strategy is provided in Supplementary Appendix H. Self-help groups for \nwomen will bring positive benefits to poor women in poor areas, where the percentage of female-\nheaded  households  is  disproportionately  larger  compared  with  the  overall  average.  The  gender \nstrategy presented in Supplementary Appendix I focuses on women\u2019s participation to maximize the \nInvestment  Program\u2019s  beneficial  impacts  on  women.  Appendix  11  presents  a  gender  action  plan. \nThe  Investment  Program\u2019s  benefits  for  women  are  expected  to  include  a  reduction  of  the  burden \nentailed in collecting water, health benefits, and employment opportunities. \n \n\n4. \n\nSocial and Environmental Safeguards \n\n75. \nSocial.  The  KUIDFC  prepared  short  resettlement  plans  for  sample  subprojects  in  three \nInvestment  Program  ULBs  (Haveri,  Hospet,  and  Raichur)  following  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary \nresettlement, the resettlement framework for the Investment Program, and applicable policies and \nlaws of the Government and GoK. Draft short resettlement plans are in Supplementary Appendixes \nJ1  to  J3.  Subprojects  are  not  expected  to  result  in  significant  land  acquisition  and  resettlement. \nCareful  subproject  site  and  alignment  selection  will  minimize  the  amount  of  land  acquisition \nrequired, and GoK land will be used to the extent possible. The draft short resettlement plans show \nthat 13, 12, and 14 hectares, respectively, will be permanently acquired for the Haveri, Hospet, and \nRaichur  sewage  treatment  plants.  This  acquisition  will affect  a  total  of  29  households  in  the  three \nULBs.  No  permanent  land  acquisition  is  required  for  water  supply  subprojects,  which  will  be \nundertaken  in  existing  facilities,  or  for  urban  road  improvements,  which  will  be  confined  to \nimprovements to the riding surface. While temporary land acquisition is not expected for any of the \nsubprojects,  this  will  be  re-examined  during  detailed  engineering  design  of  water  supply  and \nsewerage  network  components.  To  ensure  compliance  with  the  policies  and  requirements  on \nresettlement  of  the  Government,  GoK  and  ADB,  the  KUIDFC  has  formulated  a  resettlement \nframework  to  guide  the  implementation  of  future  subprojects.  A  summary  of  the  resettlement \nframework is in Appendix 12 and the resettlement framework is in Supplementary Appendix K. \n \n76. \nThe  Investment  Program  provides  social  benefits  through  improvements  of  and  expanded \naccess  to  urban  infrastructure  and  services  and  enhances  the  potential  for  investments  and \neconomic growth in poorer districts of north Karnataka. Social assessments undertaken for sample \nsubprojects  do  not  indicate  any  adverse  impacts  on  vulnerable  groups,  including  indigenous \npeoples.  The  KUIDFC  has  formulated  an  indigenous  peoples  development  framework  to  ensure \nthat appropriate indigenous peoples development plans or specific actions will be undertaken that \nenable equal sharing of Investment Program benefits should a future subproject affect indigenous \npeoples (Supplementary Appendix L). \n \n77. \nEnvironmental.  The  KUIDFC  has  prepared  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  for \nthree  sample  subprojects  in  the  Investment  Program  ULBs  of  Haveri,  Hospet,  and Raichur  in  line \nwith  ADB\u2019s  environment  policy.  The  IEEs  show  that  subprojects  will  result  in  net  environmental \nbenefits, including (i) improved quality of drinking water from water supply investments; (ii) improved \nsurface and groundwater quality; (iii) improved public health as a result of sanitation and drainage \ninvestments;  (iv) reduced  flooding  as  a  result  of  drainage  investments;  (v) reduced  volume  of \nsuspended  particulates  in  the  air  as  a  result  of  improved  roads;  and  (vi) increased  social  benefits \nfrom community participation, slum improvement, and nonmunicipal infrastructure investments. The \nsalient  points  of  the  IEEs  are  summarized  in  Appendix  13  (the  actual  IEEs  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendixes M1 to M3). \n \nThe  Investment  Program  will  not  generate  any  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts. \n78. \nPotential adverse environmental impacts are largely temporary and localized and can be addressed \nthrough  subproject  design  and  mitigation  measures.  The  IEEs  contain  environmental  monitoring \nplans that identify monitoring parameters and the agencies responsible for ensuring that mitigation \nmeasures are undertaken. The IEEs conclude that no further assessment of environmental impacts \nis  required  for  sample  subprojects.  To  ensure  compliance  with  the  environmental  guidelines  and \nrequirements  of  the  Government,  GoK  and  ADB,  the  KUIDFC  has  formulated  environmental \nassessment  and  review  procedures  to  guide  the  implementation  of  future  subprojects.  Should  a \ncategory A or B (sensitive) subproject be prepared, a Summary Environmental Impact Assessment \nor  Summary  Initial  Environmental  Examination  will  be  prepared  and  made  available  to  the  public \n120 days in advance of subproject approval in line with ADB\u2019s implementation procedures for sector \nloans.  The  environmental  assessment  of  sector  impacts,  summary  IEEs  for  sample  subprojects, \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nB. \n\nRisks \n\nenvironmental  criteria  for  subproject  selection,  and  environmental  assessment  and  review \nprocedures are in Supplementary Appendix N. \n\n79. \nThe  effectiveness  of  the  infrastructure  to  be  developed  under  the  Investment  Program \ndepends on the level of ownership of and commitment by the Investment Program ULBs. The ULBs \nmust be committed to institutional change and financial reforms, especially the NNP. Offering ULBs \nmore  favorable  loan  conditions  based  on  the  number  of  core  reforms  adopted  will  mitigate  some \nrisks,  but  at  the  same  time,  the  ULBs  must  continue  to  demonstrate  the  political  will  to  increase \ntariffs  to  achieve  full  cost  recovery  within  a  reasonable  time  frame.  A  key  risk  is  that  Investment \nProgram  ULBs  may  fail  to  manage  and  maintain  the  newly  acquired  assets  properly  and  may  be \ntempted to minimize costs through inappropriate operations. GoK is mitigating this risk by launching \na well-prepared human resources policy designed to abolish redundant and/or antiquated positions \nand appoint well-qualified staff through competitive selection procedures. \n \nLong-term  contractual  relationships,  such  as  the  PBDPS  and  PBMC  modalities,  involve \n80. \nrisks.  Each  of  these  risks  carries  with  it  a  cost  to  the  contracting  parties,  and  these  costs  are \nultimately borne by Investment Program beneficiaries in the form of tariffs or taxes. As such, careful \nattention  to  risk  mitigation  measures  can  help  ensure  that  PSP  arrangements  result  in  improved \nservice delivery at the lowest possible cost to Investment Program beneficiaries. The allocation of \nrisk for a subproject will depend on specific subproject conditions, including the type and location of \nthe subproject, the services to be provided, and the negotiating positions of the parties involved. At \npreliminary  consultations  with  prospective  private  contractors  at  a  workshop  held  during  the \nAppraisal  Mission  on  12  September  2005  (Supplementary  Appendix  E),  the  private  contractors \nidentified the risks that need to be addressed in the design of PSP subprojects as follows: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n\nforce majeure risks; \nrevenue  risks,  in  particular,  the  need  for  escalation  clauses  that  would  allow  the \nprivate contractors\u2019 remuneration to be adjusted for inflation and the need to ensure \npayments to the private contractors from the ULBs; \npolitical  risks,  in  particular,  assurances  that  GoK  is  strongly  committed  to  its  stated \npolicies; \nconstruction  risks,  in  particular,  delays  caused  by  the  failure  to  complete  land \nacquisition prior to the onset of construction; \nfinancial risks, in particular, with regard to foreign currency exposure; and \noperating risks, specifically, the reliability of water sources in the case of water and \nsewerage projects. \n\n \nBased  on \n\nlessons \n\n81. \nfrom  global  experiences  with  similar  contracting  approaches \n(Supplementary  Appendix  E),  identifiable  risks  inherent  in  PSP  arrangements,  including  those \noutlined  above,  will  be  mitigated  through  careful  design  of  both  types  of  contracts  and  the \nunderlying legal and regulatory regime. The remaining risks will be allocated, to the extent possible, \nto those parties best able to bear them. This principle will be adopted in developing PSP contracts \nand associated bidding documents. \n \n82. \nA number of Investment Program ULBs will continue to depend on water sources which are \nnot  under  their  control  but  from  which  sufficient  quantities  of  water  must  be  made  available  for \nthem. Thus one risk is the impact of potential conflicting upstream demands on water sources and \nanother  is  upstream  pollution.  The  success  of  the  Investment  Program  also  depends  on  the \nsuccessful rehabilitation of existing water treatment, transmission, and distribution systems and of \nexisting  sewerage  systems.  As  these  assets  continue  to  deteriorate  with  age,  the  level  of \ninvestment required to achieve the stated objectives may increase. The risk of underinvestment is \nincreased as a result of the current limited knowledge of the systems because of the lack of original \nplans, as-built drawings and operational data. Improving the level of system understanding will be a \nkey  task  for  the  program  consultants.  In  addition,  delays  in  land  acquisition,  where  undertaken, \ncould result in implementation delays. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19 \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n83. \nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government and GoK have given the following \nassurances,  which  have  been  incorporated  in  the  framework  financing  agreement,  and  will  be \nincorporated  in  the  individual  loan  agreements  as  applicable,  subject  to  any  amendments  to  be \nmutually agreed by the Government and ADB. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nGoK will ensure that sufficient counterpart funds are made available from its budget \nfor each fiscal year in a timely manner to cover (a) its contribution, and (b) those of \nthe implementing agencies for the subprojects under components A, B, C, D, and E. \nGoK will ensure that adequate funds for the O&M of project facilities created under \nindividual subprojects will be provided for appropriate implementing agencies during \nand after subproject completion through budgetary allocations or other means. \nThe Government will make available to GoK the proceeds of the financing provided \nby ADB. GoK commits to bearing the foreign exchange risk of such proceeds. \nGoK will relend the loan proceeds to the implementing agencies through the KUIDFC \nunder appropriate relending arrangements acceptable to ADB. \nGoK  will  ensure  that  contractual  documents  under  the  PBDPS  and/or  PBMC \narrangements are provided for ADB for prior review and approval before their use for \nindividual subprojects. \nGoK will ensure that necessary provisions are made for each PSP contractor to meet \nthe  contractual  obligations  of  GoK  and  of  the  pertinent  Investment  Program  ULB. \nGoK will ensure that the PSP fund that has been established is operationalized and \nthat  sufficient  funds  are  provided  to  and  maintained  in  the  fund  to  mitigate \nnonpayment risks for PSP contractors. \n\n(vii)  GoK will ensure that all land and rights-of-way required for any of the subprojects are \nmade  available  in  a  timely  manner;  that  compensation  at  replacement  value  is \nprovided  prior  to  the  award  of  relevant  civil  works  contracts;  and  that  involuntary \nresettlement, including relocation, is carried out in accordance with the resettlement \nframework  and  resettlement  plans  agreed  upon  between  GoK  and  ADB,  the \nGovernment\u2019s national policy on resettlement and rehabilitation, and ADB\u2019s policy on \nInvoluntary Resettlement.  A resettlement plan will be prepared for every subproject \ninvolving land acquisition or resettlement, including relocation, and will be submitted \nto  ADB  for  review  and  approval  prior  to  the  award  of  any  related  civil  works \ncontracts.  For  sample  subprojects,  updated  resettlement  plans  will  be  provided  to \nADB  for  review  and  approval  following  detailed  engineering  design  and  prior  to  the \naward  of  civil  works  contracts.  Similarly,  revised  resettlement  plans  based  on \ndetailed designs for all subprojects will also be provided for ADB approval prior to the \naward of related civil works contracts. \n\n(x) \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  GoK  will ensure that subprojects will, as far as possible, have a  minimal impact on \nindigenous peoples. If an impact is anticipated, GoK will ensure that the subprojects \nare  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  indigenous  peoples  development  framework \nagreed  upon  between  GoK  and  ADB  and  will  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \nIndigenous Peoples. \nGoK  will  ensure  that  subprojects  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  gender \naction plan (Appendix 11) and ADB\u2019s policy on gender and development. \nGoK  will  ensure  that  the  design,  construction,  operation,  and  implementation  of  all \nsubproject facilities is carried out in accordance with the environmental assessment \nand review procedures and IEEs for sample subprojects agreed upon between GoK \nand  ADB  and  complies  with  the  environmental  laws  and  regulations  of  the \nGovernment  and  GoK,  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy.  Any  adverse  environmental \nimpacts  arising  from  the  construction,  operation,  and  implementation  of  subproject \nfacilities  will  be  minimized  by  implementing  the  environmental  mitigation  and \nmanagement  measures  and  other  recommendations  specified  in  environmental \nassessment  reports  (e.g.,  Initial  Environmental  Examinations,  and  Environmental \nImpact  Assessments).  GoK  will  ensure  that  environmental  requirements  are \nincorporated in bidding documents and civil works contracts. \nGoK  will  conduct  surveys  under  the  bridging  TA  referred  to  in  paragraph  37,  to \ndetermine the real volumetric water tariff by measuring the actual amounts of water \nsupplied to 3 ULBs to be selected by the KUIDFC. \n\n(xi) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n(xii)  GoK will ensure that for each of the Investment Program ULBs receiving funds under \nthe  loan,  the  (nominal)  base  volumetric  water  tariff  will  be  increased  to  the  real \ncurrent volumetric tariff per m3 and that the tariff schedule will be changed zone by \nzone or for the related town, as feasible, upon completion of the related water supply \nsubproject,  from  the  (un-metered)  monthly  flat-rate  to  volumetric  metered  tariff  with \nthe  lifeline  block  set  at  8  m3  for  which  the  rate  shall  not  be  less  than  the  flat-rate. \nUpon completion of the studies currently being carried out by consultants under the \nWorld  Bank-supported  Karnataka  Urban  Water  Sector \nImprovement  Project \n(KUWASIP), and by the bridging TA consultants, the water tariffs of the Investment \nProgram  ULBs  will  be  reviewed  and  revised  based  on  recommendations  of  these \nstudies. Recommendations to the Investment Program ULBs will be firmed up by the \nmid-term review of the Investment Program. \n\n(xiii)  For subprojects consisting of sewerage provision, sewerage tariffs will be introduced \nby GoK. The appropriate levels of sewerage tariffs for the Investment Program ULBs \nwill  be  agreed  between  GoK  and  ADB  upon  completion  of  studies  currently  being \ncarried  out  by  consultants  under  the  World  Bank-supported  KUWASIP,  and \nsubsequently  upon  completion  of  studies  by  the  bridging  TA  consultants.  Such \nsewerage tariffs will take effect upon related subproject\u2019s completion. \n\n(xiv)  GoK  will  ensure  that  measures  are  taken  to  improve  bill  collection  efficiency \nincluding  the  enforcement  of  existing  provisions  for  service  cut-off  due  to  non-\npayment.  The  appropriate  levels  of  bill  collection  efficiency  improvement  targets  for \nthe  Investment  Program  ULBs  will  be  agreed  between  GoK  and  ADB  upon \ncompletion of the studies currently being carried out by consultants under the World \nBank-supported KUWASIP project, and the studies by the bridging TA consultants. \n\n(xv)  GoK  will  ensure  that  the  Investment  Program  ULBs  will  by  not  later  than  31 \nDecember  2011,  (a)  take  measures  to  significantly  improve  bill  collection  efficiency \nincluding  the  enforcement  of  existing  provisions  for  service  cut-off  due  to  non \npayment,  and  (b) introduce  self  assessment  system  or  capital  value  system  for \nproperty tax. \n\n(xvi)  For each PSP contract, the KUIDFC will propose three program consultant teams not \ndirectly involved in the geographical area concerned as candidates for independent \nauditor.  The  PSP  contractor  concerned  will  be  allowed  to  select  a  preferred \ncandidate for independent auditor\u2014to be employed by the KUIDFC\u2014from the list of \nthe three. \n\n(xvii)  GoK  will,  in  sofar  as  it  relates  to  the  related  projects,  promptly  notify  ADB  of  any \nproposal  to  amend,  cancel,  or  repeal  any  of  the  provisions  of  the  KUIDFC\u2019s \nmemorandum  of  association  or  articles  of  incorporation  and  will  give  ADB  an \nadequate opportunity to comment on such proposals before taking any action. \n(xviii)  GoK  will  ensure  that  the  necessary  resolutions  shall  have  been  passed  by  the \nrelevant  ULBs  prior  to  allowing  the  KUWSDB  to  implement  bulk  water  supply \nschemes under component B of the Investment Program on behalf of a ULB. \n(xix)  GoK  will  ensure  that  all  subprojects  meet,  to  the  satisfaction  of  ADB,  the  criteria \n\ndescribed in Schedule 4 to the Framework Financing Agreement. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n84. \nI am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the Articles \nof Agreement of the ADB and, acting in the absence of the President, under the provisions of Article \n35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  provision  of \nloans  under  the  multitranche  financing  facility  in  an  aggregate  principal  amount  not  exceeding \n$270,000,000  equivalent  to  India  for  the  North  Karnataka  Urban  Sector  Investment  Program  from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-\nbased lending facility, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the Framework Financing Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n\n \n\nLiqun Jin \nVice President \n\n14 November 2006 \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\n21\n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nDesign Summary \n\nPerformance \nTargets/Indicators \n\nImpact \n \nImprovement of Urban \nInfrastructure  and services \nresulting in overall \nimprovement in quality of \nlife in project ULBs;

Most cities must deal with a \nlack of reliable and safe water supplies, inadequate wastewater systems, poorly maintained streets, \nand  growing  slum  areas.  The  resultant  negative  social,  economic,  and  environmental  impacts  are \nsignificant, with the urban poor being most directly affected. The Government's passage of the 74th \nConstitutional Amendment Act in 1992 marked the beginning of a new and committed approach to \naddressing  the  problems  facing  India's  growing  urban  areas.  The  act  provides  for  the  progressive \ndevolution  of  authority  and  responsibility  for  urban  affairs  from  the  states  to  urban  local  bodies \n(ULBs).  Essential  to  this  provision  is  the  need  to  undertake  significant  policy  reforms  aimed  at \nimproving urban management, finance, and governance at the local level. The Government has also \nformulated an urban sector strategy and plan for the most urbanized states in the country. \n \nB. \n\nUrban Sector \n\n1. \n\nNational \n\n2. \nIndia  faces  a  formidable  challenge  in  responding  to  the  increasing  demand  for  urban \ninfrastructure, urban services, and housing in the country's rapidly expanding urban areas. With an \nurban population of around 285 million in 2001, the inadequacy of existing urban infrastructure and \nservices,  coupled  with  a  severe  shortage  of  affordable  housing,  poses  serious  constraints  to \nsustained economic growth and productivity. While India's cities are home to less than 30% of the \npopulation, they currently account for about 50% of gross domestic product and more than 90% of \nall  Government  revenues.  However,  the  continued  productivity  of  India's  cities  is  contingent  upon \nsignificant investments to upgrade and maintain urban infrastructure and to provide adequate levels \nof  urban  services.  With  India's  urban  population  expected  to  grow  to  405  million  by  2011  and  550 \nmillion by 2021, the challenge lies in accommodating an average of more than 11 million new urban \nresidents per year. \n \n3. \nIn  addition  to  being  a  major  constraint  to  economic  growth  and  productivity,  the  lack  of \nadequate investments in urban infrastructure, urban services, and housing has social ramifications, \nespecially for the urban poor. According to some estimates, as much as 30% of the urban population \nlives below the official poverty line. In the larger cities, estimates indicate that approximately 28% of \npeople  live  in  slums.  India's  slum  population  increased  from  about  28  million  in  1981  to  some  51 \nmillion  in  1991  and  is  expected  to  have  exceeded  100  million  by  2000.  The  health  and \nenvironmental  implications  of  sprawling  slums  and  households\u2019  lack  of  access  to  potable  water, \nsewerage, drainage, sanitation, and waste disposal facilities are staggering. \n \n\n2. \n\nKarnataka \n\n4. \nKarnataka is one of India\u2019s most urbanized states, with an urban population of 17.9 million in \n2001,  accounting  for  34%  of  the  state's  total  population.  About  one  third  of  the  state's  urban \npopulation lives below the poverty line. The state capital of Bangalore is one of the fastest growing \nmetropolitan  areas  in  the  country  and  constitutes  the  center  of  India's  high-technology  industries, \nsuch  as  aerospace,  telecommunications,  and  computer  hardware  and  software  development.  The \nrapid  expansion  of  industrial  activities  and  the  increased  migration  of  people  from  rural  areas  and \nother  parts of  the  country  to  Bangalore  are  placing  considerable  strains  on  the city\u2019s  infrastructure \nand  services.  Living  conditions  are  deteriorating  rapidly,  urban  poverty \nis  rampant,  and \nenvironmental problems are on the rise. \n \nAlthough Bangalore has been Karnataka's center of urban and industrial growth for the past \n5. \ntwo decades, the state has recognized that the social and economic development potential of other \nprincipal urban centers has not been realized, mainly because of the absence of adequate levels of \ninvestment  in  basic  urban  infrastructure  and  services.  In  particular,  the  state  has  identified  the \ncoastal  region,  with  Mangalore  constituting  the  primary  urban  center,  as  a  priority  area  for \ninvestment.  Despite  this  region's  rich  resource  base  and  strategic  location,  poor  infrastructure \nconditions  have  directly  contributed  to  a  deterioration  in  living  standards  and  served  as  a  major \nconstraint to economic growth. \n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n \n\n \n\n6. \nThe state has recently recognized that north Karnataka is also lagging behind the rest of the \nstate. Indeed, the High Power Committee Report for Redressal of Regional Imbalances1 noted that \nthe  economy  of  north  Karnataka  has  been  worse  off  than  that  of  other  parts  of  the  state  for  more \nthan  four  decades.  The  economy  is  primarily  based  on  agriculture,  with  more  than  36%  of  the \nworkforce employed in this sector. Average per capita incomes in all districts in north Karnataka are \nlower  than  the  state  average.  Of  the  78  clusters  of  ULBs  defined  as  suffering  from  abject  poverty \n(more than 40% of the population below the poverty line), 48 are located in north Karnataka. \n \n7. \nThe level of urban services in north Karnataka is poor. The water supply is intermittent in all \ntowns  and  is  often  as  infrequent  as  once  every  3  days  to  once  a  week.  Only  a  few  towns  receive \nwater for 1 to 2 hours each day and the water quality is poor. Service coverage is limited, and on \naverage, houses with water supply connections account for only 67% of properties registered to pay \nproperty taxes. Where sewer systems have been constructed, coverage is limited and they generally \nserve only the older sections of each ULB. Only a few sewage treatment plants exist, and these do \nnot function well, if at all. Storm water drainage facilities are inadequate and frequently misused for \nsolid waste disposal. Roads are generally unpaved and junctions are inefficient. Slums exist in most \ntowns  and  their  levels  of  urban  infrastructure  and  services  are  extremely  low,  with  some  public \nstandposts  serving  up  to  about  300  people  and  only  the  most  basic  level  of  sanitation  available. \nDetails  of  the  existing  service  levels  in  each  of  the  proposed  Investment  Program  ULBs  are \npresented in Table A2.1 at the end of this appendix. \n \nC. \n\nGovernment Policies \n\n1. \n\nNational \n\nIndia\u2019s 10th five-year plan (fiscal year 2002\u2013fiscal year 2007) proposes 8% annual growth for \n8. \nthe economy and focuses on four basic themes: high growth, equitable growth, human development, \nand reforms. With 80% of plan allocations targeting social expenditures, the 10th five-year plan aims \nto reduce poverty through access to education, health care, potable water, and sanitation. The plan \nalso focuses on good governance as a cross-cutting issue, notes the declining role of government in \nthe  provision  of  services,  and  emphasizes  the  development  of  private  sector  participation  and  the \nprovision of an improved regulatory environment. \n \n9. \nThe  Government  has  stressed  its  resolve  to  energetically  pursue  the  goals  of  poverty \nreduction  through  shared  growth  and  of  inclusive  social  development  as  encapsulated  in  the \nNational  Common  Minimum  Program.  This  program  seeks  to  ensure  that  economic  reforms  are \noriented  primarily  toward  spreading  and  deepening  rural  prosperity,  improving  the  quality  and \ndelivery of public services, and bringing about a visible and tangible difference in the quality of life of \nordinary  citizens.  Overall,  the  program  emphasizes  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  undertake \neconomic reforms \u201cwith a human face.\u201d Its main goals relevant to the urban infrastructure sector are \nto \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nincrease  investments  in  the  development  and  expansion  of  physical  infrastructure \nsuch  as  roads  including  highways,  ports,  power,  railways,  water  supply,  sewage \ntreatment, and sanitation; \nraise public spending on education from 4.1% to 6% of gross domestic product, with \nat least half to be spent on primary and secondary education; \nraise  public  spending  on  health  from  less  than  1%  to  at  least  2%  to  3%  of  gross \ndomestic product over the next 5 years, focusing mainly on primary health care; \neliminate  the  federal  Government\u2019s  revenue  deficit  by  2009  to  release  more \nresources for investments in social and physical infrastructure; and \nstrengthen social security, health insurance, and other schemes to improve the lives \nof informal sector workers. \n\n \n\n2. \n\nKarnataka \n\n10. \nThe government of Karnataka is currently implementing comprehensive reforms in line with \nthe 10th five-year plan through the Directorate of Municipal Administration\u2019s (DMA\u2019s) Nirmala Nagar \nProgram.  This  is  a  six-module  program  that  is  addressing  the  key  issues  of  property  taxes, \naccounting, thrift and credit, public toilets, rainwater harvesting, and solid waste management.

Bangalore. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n27\n\n \n\nNirmala Nagar Program is being supported by a well-prepared human resources policy designed to \nabolish  obsolete  and  redundant  positions  and  appoint  well-qualified  professionals,  such  as \naccountants and environmental engineers, through competitive selection procedures. \n \n11. \nImproving  the  poor  rates  of  property  registration  (for  tax  purposes)  and  assessment  and  of \nproperty tax collection have been key objectives, as only about 75% of properties in Karnataka are \nassessed  and  registered,  and  of  these  only  50%  actually  pay  property  taxes.  The  unrealized  tax \nincome  is  in  the  order  of  $70  million.  The  DMA  is  currently  70%  through  an  ambitious  program  to \nsurvey 3 million properties in the 63 ULBs initially targeted under the reforms. The program is being \nsupported by well-designed management information and geographic information systems that were \ndeveloped  by  the  eGovernments  Foundation.  The  software  packages  being  produced  are  highly \nadvanced. \n \n12. \nUnder  the  Karnataka  Urban  Infrastructure  Development  Project,  the  government  of \nKarnataka  developed  the  fund-based  accounting  system  using  the  town  of  Tumkur  and  the  city  of \nBangalore as pilot cases. The system has been working well, and the DMA is currently upgrading it \nas part of the ongoing sector reforms before rolling it out to the same 63 ULBs targeted for the first \nphase of reforms.  \n \nD. \n \n13. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) has derived numerous lessons from its experience with \nintegrated urban development projects. For example, such projects must (i) be well defined in terms \nof  their  scope  and  scale;  (ii)  take  into  account  both  absorptive  and  implementation  capacity  when \nassessing  the  number  of  subsectors  and  towns  to  be  included;  (iii)  limit  the  number  of  executing \nagencies so as not to complicate decisionmaking and the management process; (iv) ensure that the \nselection of towns for inclusion in the project is demand driven and based on the towns\u2019 commitment \nand  ability  to  implement  policy  reforms,  strengthen  institutional  capacities,  and  support  community \nparticipation;  and  (v)  have  clear  implementation  arrangements,  especially  when  projects  involve  a \nmultiplicity  of  institutions  with  overlapping  responsibilities.  Of  particular concern  is  land  acquisition, \nwhich is normally the primary cause of delay in implementing urban infrastructure projects. Advance \nactions  and  the  strengthening  of  institutions  responsible  for  project  implementation  are  needed  to \navoid  such  delays.  Experience  also  shows  that  project  ownership  by  the  community  should  be \nestablished at an early stage of project design to achieve satisfactory operation and maintenance as \nwell  as  improved  cost  recovery.  Finally,  the  emphasis  on  introducing  market  discipline  into  project \ndesign  must  be  greater  than  observed  in  the  past  experiences  in  an  effort  to  identify  options  for \nrecovering  costs  and  achieving  financial  sustainability.  Table  A2.2  lists  the  externally  assisted \nprojects in the urban sector in India at the end of this appendix. \n \nE. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy \n\nLessons  \n\n14. \nIn  India,  ADB's  overall  strategic  thrust  has  been  to  help  the  Government  promote  efficient \nand  sustainable  economic  growth  to  improve  employment  opportunities  and  reduce  poverty.  By \nsupporting  the  development  of  urban  infrastructure,  providing  long-term  funds  for  housing  finance, \nand  developing  sustainable  mechanisms  for  the  delivery  of  social  services,  ADB  is  increasingly \nintegrating  social  welfare  concerns  into  its  strategy.  Through  its  technical  assistance  and  lending \nprograms,  ADB  is  also  promoting  policy  reform  measures  to  address  the  legal,  institutional,  and \nfinancial problems confronting India's urban sector. These reform measures are aimed at liberalizing \nIndia's  land  and  housing  markets  to  attract  more  private  investment  into  the  sector.  ADB's  urban \nsector  assistance  emphasizes  capacity-building  and  institutional  strengthening  initiatives  aimed  at \npromoting sustainable urban management. \n \nOver the medium term, ADB's urban sector strategy for India calls for continued support for \n15. \nintegrated  urban  development  projects  in  an  effort  to  improve  the  urban  environment  and  living \nconditions,  especially  of  the  urban  poor,  and  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  ULBs  to  implement \nprojects  and  deliver  services.  Furthermore,  urban  projects  in  India  are  demand-driven,  with  key \ncriteria being ULBs' willingness to initiate policy reform measures as part of ADB-financed projects. \nThe  overall  design  of  integrated  urban  development  projects  takes  ULBs\u2019  absorptive  capacity  into \naccount. The strategy also emphasizes the importance of using projects as a way to gain valuable \nlocal  experience  for  improving  project  implementation  and operation  and  maintenance  capabilities. \nThus,  to  the  extent  possible,  project  execution  should  be  through  existing  institutions,  particularly \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n \n\n \n\nULBs.  Integrated  urban  development  projects  funded  by  ADB  are  also  used  to  introduce  and \nimplement  various  cost-recovery  mechanisms  and  privatization  measures,  especially  for  water \nsupply  subprojects,  to  ensure  financial  sustainability.  ADB's  sector  strategy  emphasizes  the \nincorporation  of  appropriately  designed  community  awareness  and  participation  programs.  ADB \nrecognizes that innovative approaches to participation by communities and beneficiaries, particularly \nlow-income  households,  are  essential  for  overall  project  sustainability  and  replicability.  In  addition, \nADB\u2019s  focus  on  the  urban  poor  goes  beyond  infrastructure:  it  prescribes  a  holistic  approach  to \nmeeting their needs and empowering them to improve their own living conditions, including the use \nof self-help schemes and the careful application of cross-subsidies. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nTable A2.1: Summary of Population and Service Levels in Investment Program ULBs (as of 2004)   \n\n \n\nPopulation (\u2018000) \n\nWater Supply \n\nSewerage \n\nTransport \n\nSource \nSupply \n(liters per \ncapita/day) \n67 \n\nPercentage \nof \nPopulation \nServed by \nConnection \n39 \n\nPercentage \nof \nPopulation \nServed by \nSewers \n0 \n\nPercentage \nof \nPopulation \nServed \nby STP \n0 \n\nTotal \nLength \n(km) \n35 \n\nPercentage \nof Roads \nSurfaced \n70 \n\nUrban Local Body \nBadami \n\nDistrict \n\nBagalkot \n\n2004 \n26 \n\n2021 \n39 \n\nBasavakalyan \n\nBidar \n\nBelgaum \n\nBelgaum \n\nChamarajnagar \n\nChamarajnagar \n\nDavangere \n\nDavangere \n\nBellary \n\nBidar \n\nBijapur \n\nGadag-Betageri \n\nGangavathi \n\nGokak \n\nGulbarga \n\nHaveri \n\nHospet \n\nHubli-Dharwad \n\nIlkal \n\nJamkhandi \n\nKoppal \n\nNippani \n\nRaichur \n\nRanebennur \n\nShahabad \n\nSindhanoor \n\nYadgir \n\nBellary \n\nBidar \n\nBijapur \n\nGadag \n\nKoppal \n\nBelgaum \n\nGulbarga \n\nHaveri \n\nBellary \n\nDharwad \n\nBagalkot \n\nBagalkot \n\nKoppal \n\nBelgaum \n\nRaichur \n\nHavari \n\nGulbarga \n\nRaichur \n\nGulbarga \n\nRabkavi-Banhatti \n\nBagalkot \n\n60 \n\n447 \n\n331 \n\n194 \n\n267 \n\n64 \n\n400 \n\n166 \n\n106 \n\n70 \n\n463 \n\n59 \n\n172 \n\n842 \n\n56 \n\n61 \n\n62 \n\n62 \n\n73 \n\n98 \n\n66 \n\n70 \n\n60 \n\n227 \n\n85 \n\n615 \n\n416 \n\n330 \n\n400 \n\n102 \n\n636 \n\n393 \n\n159 \n\n97 \n\n756 \n\n81 \n\n262 \n\n67 \n\n81 \n\n89 \n\n79 \n\n90 \n\n343 \n\n140 \n\n84 \n\n126 \n\n84 \n\n1,137 \n\nSupply \nFrequency \n1 hr/2d \n\n1 hr/3d \n\n2 hr/2d \n\n2 hr/2d \n\n1.5 hr/d \n\n2 hr/2d \n\n4 hr/d \n\n2 hr/2d \n\n1.5 hr/2d \n\n2 hr/2d \n\n1.5 hr/3d \n\n1 hr/2d \n\n1 hr/3d \n\n3 hr/d \n\n1 hr/week \n\n3\u20144 hr/2d \n\n1 hr/3d \n\n2 hr/2d \n\n3\u20134 hr/2d \n\n1.5 hr/2d \n\n1 hr/d \n\n0.75 hr/d \n\n2 hr/d \n\n3\u20144 hr/2d \n\n1 hr/2d \n\n40 \n\n58 \n\n44 \n\n24 \n\n70 \n\n67 \n\n25 \n\n46 \n\n18 \n\n64 \n\n37 \n\n48 \n\n26 \n\n44 \n\n31 \n\n53 \n\n23 \n\n73 \n\n42 \n\n51 \n\n50 \n\n21 \n\n52 \n\n52 \n\n0 \n\n67 \n\n37 \n\n15 \n\n16 \n\n0 \n\n46 \n\n12 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n25 \n\n0 \n\n54 \n\n19 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n5 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n100 \n\n37 \n\n36 \n\n0 \n\n32 \n\n63 \n\n14 \n\n79 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n62 \n\n653 \n\n549 \n\n330 \n\n587 \n\n199 \n\n502 \n\n121 \n\n98 \n\n113 \n\n643 \n\n53 \n\n99 \n\n630 \n\n84 \n\n98 \n\n141 \n\n86 \n\n73 \n\n172 \n\n247 \n\n33 \n\n71 \n\n76 \n\n16 \n\n83 \n\n39 \n\n29 \n\n77 \n\n10 \n\n44 \n\n46 \n\n26 \n\n42 \n\n42 \n\n57 \n\n40 \n\n70 \n\n21 \n\n26 \n\n11 \n\n59 \n\n12 \n\n46 \n\n33 \n\n46 \n\n38 \n\n54 \n\n50 \n\n51 \n\nd = day (2d = 2 days, 3d = 3 days), hr = hour, STP = sewerage treatment plant. \nSource: Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development Finance Corporation. 2005.

The  state  has  175  clusters  of  ULBs  in  27  districts.  The \nmajority  of  clusters  of  ULBs  classified  as  \u201cmost  backward\u201d  are  located  in  north  Karnataka.  Hence \nULBs  located  in  north  Karnataka  are  selected  for  support  under  the  Investment  Program.1  The \noperational selection criteria used for ULB selection are as follows: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n\nThe ULB contributes no less than 10% of the related costs of the subproject. \nThe  ULB  has  passed  the  necessary  council  resolutions  to  implement  the  Nirmala \nNagar Program reforms. \nThe  ULB  is  for  a  town  with  a  population  larger  than  50,000,  unless  otherwise \nacceptable to the GoK and ADB. \nThe ULB is not supported by the World Bank-assisted Karnataka Municipal Reform \nProject. \nThe ULB is the district headquarters of a newly created district. \nThe ULB is for a town that is important for tourism and has been identified as such \nby the state\u2019s tourism policy.  \n\n \n3. \nThe  criteria  (i)-(iv)  are  required  for  all  the  ULBs  to  be  selected  for  the  Program,  while  the \ncriteria  (v)-(vi)  are  additional  consideration  factors  applied  when  selecting  some  of  the  initial  25 \nULBs. Based on the foregoing criteria, 25 ULBs have been initially selected for support and consist \nof  4  city  corporations,  14  city  municipality  councils,  6  town  municipalities,  and  1  town  panchayat. \nOther  ULBs  that  meet  the  foregoing  selection  criteria  may  subsequently  be  included  in  the \nInvestment  Program  if  additional  financial  resources  become  available  through  budget  savings  or \ninitially selected ULBs drop out because they fail to meet the criteria for continued support. \n \nC. \n\nSelection of Components \n\n4. \nBased on discussions and consultations at both the state and ULB levels, it was concluded \nby the ADB and the Government that the Investment Program should support ULBs in developing 9 \nof  the  18  basic  urban  services  that  are  their  mandated  municipality  functions  under  the  12th \nschedule of the Constitution (included in the 74th Amendment to the Constitution in 1992), namely: \n(i) public health, sanitation and solid waste management; (ii) water supply for domestic, industrial, \nand commercial purposes; (iii) roads; (iv) public amenities, including street lighting, parking lots, bus \nstops,  and  public  toilets;  (v)  slum  improvement  and  upgrading;  (vi)  safeguarding  the  interests  of \nweaker  sections  of  society;  (vii)  urban  poverty  reduction;  (viii)  firefighting  services;  and  (ix)  urban \nforestry,  protection  of  the  environment,  and  promotion  of  ecological  aspects.  The  basic  urban \nservices  not  included  in  the  Investment  Program  relate  to  urban  planning,  regulation  of  land  use, \nplanning  for  economic  and  social  development,  provision  of  urban  amenities  and  facilities  (e.g., \nparks,  gardens,  and  playgrounds),  promotion  of  cultural,  education  and  aesthetic  aspects,  burials \nand cremations, cattle pounds, vital statistics, and regulation of slaughter houses and tanneries.  \n \n5. \nassistance, have been amalgamated into seven Investment Program components as follows: \n\nThe  foregoing  items,  along  with  institutional  development  and  Investment  Program \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\ncomponent A: sanitation infrastructure, \ncomponent B: water supply infrastructure, \ncomponent C: slum improvement, \ncomponent D: nonmunicipal infrastructure, \n\n                                                 \n1  One  exception  is  Chamarajanagar,  which  is  located  in  south  Karnataka  and  is  the  headquarters  of  one  of  six  newly \n\nformed districts in Karnataka. All other initially identified Investment Program ULBs are located in north Karnataka. \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n\ncomponent E: urban transport infrastructure, \ncomponent F: institutional development, and \ncomponent G: Investment Program assistance facility. \n\n  \nD. \n\nSelection of Subprojects \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nEach ULB will prepare a city-level investment plan (CLIP), which may include all or some of \n6. \nthe five basic urban services components. The CLIP will be based on the current level of services, \nthe  needs  and  preference  of  stakeholders,  the  financial  and  institutional  capacity  of  the  ULB,  and \nthe  norms  and  standards  prescribed  by  GoK.  In  selecting  subprojects  in  each  ULB,  GoK\u2019s \nempowered committee should check and ensure the following: \n\nAll the proposed CLIPs show reasonable financial improvements in accordance with \ncriteria agreed between GoK and the ULBs. \nAll subprojects in components B and E should demonstrate an effective internal rate \nof return of at least 12%. Other subprojects should demonstrate cost-effectiveness in \ncomparison with alternative schemes. \nAll subprojects will have prepared resettlement plans, if required, in accordance with \nthe Investment Program\u2019s resettlement framework.  \nAll  subprojects  will  meet  environmental  subproject  selection  criteria  and  ULBs  will \nhave  prepared \nincluding  environmental \nmonitoring  plans,  in  accordance  with  the  Investment  Program\u2019s  environmental \nassessment and review procedures (Supplementary Appendix N). \nAll  subprojects  will  have  prepared  indigenous  peoples  development  plans,  if \nrequired, \nindigenous  peoples \ndevelopment framework. \n\ninitial  environmental  examinations, \n\nInvestment  Program\u2019s \n\nin  accordance  with \n\nthe \n\nFor each component in each ULB, the subprojects selection criteria were developed further \n\n \n7. \nto include the following: \n \n8. \n\nComponent A: Sanitation Infrastructure \n\nThe  ULB  will  introduce  and  make  effective  upon  subproject  completion  an \nappropriate sewerage tariff, as agreed between Asian Development Bank (ADB) and \nGoK, of no less than Rs10 per month. \nSewerage subprojects are limited to the areas where the per capita water supply is \nsufficient to ensure that self-cleansing velocities can be achieved on a regular basis \nwithout frequent system flushing. \nSewerage  subprojects  will  only  commence  once  sample  surveys  show  that \nconsumers are willing to connect. \nDrainage  subprojects  are  limited  to  areas  where  a  tendency  for  flooding-related \nincidents has resulted in socioeconomic problems. Downstream rehabilitation and/or \nexpansion works should also be considered for inclusion as appropriate. ULBs must \nprepare  a  comprehensive  drainage  master  plan  in  advance  of  commencing  any \nwork. \n\n \n9. \n\nComponent B: Water Supply Infrastructure \n\n(i) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe ULB passes a relevant council resolution for the water tariff structure proposed \nunder the Investment Program. \n\n(ii)  Work on the water supply component will only commence once it is certain that the \n\nraw water source can be made secure under the Investment Program. \nThe norms for net per capita demand for water are fixed at a minimum of 90 litters \nper capita per day for all the ULBs. \n\n(iv)  Water  supply  subprojects  will  only  commence  once  sample  survey  shows  a \n\nwillingness of consumers to pay. \n\n(v)  Water supply subprojects must include provision for slum areas and for the poor in \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\ngeneral covered by the subproject. \nThe ULB passes a relevant council resolution, to achieve majority customer metering \nwithin 2 years after the completion of construction work.  \nThe ULB passes a relevant council resolution to increase the base volumetric water \ntariff  to  the  real  current  volumetric  tariff  per  cubic  meter  and  to  change  the  tariff \nschedule from the current unmetered monthly flat rate to a volumetric metered tariff \n\n\f \n\n \n11. \n\n \n12. \n\n \nE. \n \n13. \n\n(ix) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n35 \n\nwith the lifeline block set at 8 cubic meters for Rs55 per month, to be effected zone \nby  zone  or  for  the  related  town,  as  feasible,  upon  completion  of  the  related \nsubproject.  \n\n(viii)  The unmetered monthly tariff for domestic water use has been increased from Rs45 \n\nto at least Rs55 per month. \nThe ULB passes a relevant council resolution to set up separate accounting systems \nfor water supply and sewerage within the ULB. \n \n\n10. \n\nComponent C: Slum Improvement \n\nSubprojects  are  limited  to  water  supply,  sanitation  infrastructure,  formation  of  self-\nhelp  groups,  health  and  environmental  sanitation  awareness  campaigns,  footpaths, \nand pavements within notified slums. \nSubprojects  in  slums  will  be  conducted  in  coordination  with  neighborhood  groups \nand ULB-level nongovernment organizations. \n\nComponent D: Nonmunicipal Infrastructure \n\nFirefighting  service  subprojects  should  be \naccelerated fire and emergency services improvement plan. \nSupport  for  tourism  infrastructure  is  to  be  provided  only  to  those  ULBs  identified  in \nthe state tourism policy (i.e., a maximum of 6 ULBs out of the initially identified 25). \nDistrict  information  centers  are  to  focus  on  attracting  industrial  investment  and \npromoting tourism.  \nOnly  lakes  in  the  ULBs  that  suffer  from  significant  degradation  and/or  solid  waste \ndeposition will be included in cleanup programs. \n\nin  accordance  with  Karnataka\u2019s \n\nComponent E: Urban Transport Infrastructure \n\nThe  relevant  ULB  shall  have  progressed \nin  completing  subprojects  under \nComponent  A,  B  and  C  to  the  satisfaction  of  GoK,  the  Karnataka  Urban \nInfrastructure Development and Finance Corporation (KUIDFC) and ADB, so that the \nsubprojects under this component are ready to be tendered upon approval. \n\n(ii)  Work is limited to rehabilitating existing roads and upgrading of junctions.  \n(iii)  Widening  of  existing  roads  involving  land  acquisition  and/or  resettlement  is  not \nincluded under the Investment Program, except as otherwise accepted by ADB and \nthe  KUIDFC  and  subject  to  compliance  requirements  under  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995)2 and related frameworks. \n\n(iv)  Work is limited to roads within the municipal jurisdiction of related project town. \n\nApproval Procedures for Subprojects \n\nAll the subprojects will be prepared and processed as follows: \n\nWith  the  assistance  of  KUIDFC,  each  ULB  will  prepare  a  City-level  Infrastructure \nPlan  (CLIP)  which  will  identify  the  gaps  between  the  current  and  target  levels  of \nurban infrastructure, estimate the required interventions required to fill the gaps, and \npropose subprojects in components A-E to be funded under the Investment Program. \nAll the subprojects should meet the subproject selection criteria. \nThe  ULBs  will  send  their  CLIPs  via  the  KUIDFC  to  the  empowered  committee  for \napproval  and  to  ADB  for  review  to  ensure  their  compliance  with  provisions  in  the \nframework financing agreement. \nThe KUIDFC will undertake detailed appraisal of the subprojects with the assistance \nof the program consultants, and will prepare a summary subproject appraisal report \nbased  on  the  CLIPs  that  include  the  rationale  for  each  subproject;  the  scope  and \ncomponents;  a  technical  description  and  analysis;  the  cost  estimates  and  financing \nplan;  an  environment  assessment  as  required;  a  resettlement  plan  as  required;

ADB may advise \nthe KUIDFC to modify the reports if necessary. \nBased on ADB\u2019s approval, and subject to any modifications and measures required \nby  ADB,  the  KUIDFC  and  GoK  will  prepare  periodic  financing  requests  for  ADB \nfinancing.  \nPeriodic  financing  requests  will  be  formally  submitted  to  ADB  through  the \nGovernment for further processing. \n\nF. \n\nMonitoring during Implementation \n\n14. \nof all subprojects. \n\nThe GoK, acting through the KUIDFC, will be responsible for monitoring of implementation \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n37 \n\nKEY FEATURES AND OUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR PERFORMANCE-BASED \nDEFERRED PAYMENT STRUCTURE CONTRACTS \n\nA. \n\nRationale and Key Features \n\n1. \nTo  date,  the  Government  of  India\u2019s  approach  to  capital  investments  in  infrastructure  has \nbeen by means of conventional construction or turnkey contracts on a competitive basis. These are \nthen handed over to urban local bodies (ULBs) for operation, and the latter generally bear the risk \nof contractors adopting low capital cost but high maintenance cost designs. Once the assets have \nbeen handed over to the ULBs, the required operation and maintenance (O&M) tends to be ignored \nbecause  of  the  ULBs\u2019  insufficient  finances,  inadequate  skills,  and  poor  management  practices, \nleading  to  deterioration  of  the  assets  and  poor  service  performance,  plus  failure  to  achieve  the \nobjectives of projects to deliver adequate services. \n\n2. \nThus with the objective of achieving long-term sustainability of service delivery and ensuring \nthe use of the lowest-cost designs over the entire period of a project, including construction as well \nas  O&M,  the  Government  has  reviewed  this  traditional  approach  and  decided  to  adopt  the \nperformance-based  deferred  payment  structure  (PBDPS)  modality  as  an  alternative  for  selected \nsubprojects under the Investment Program. \n\n3. \nWhile  seeking  improved  accountability  of  contractors  through  performance-based  service \nprovisions, the Government, at the same time, intends to pursue another objective: mobilizing the \nabundant  private  sector  liquidity  for  worthy  public  sector  projects.  By  implementing  subprojects \nusing the PBDPS modality, the Government expects to realize the efficiencies of the private sector \nin relation to both construction and O&M in addition to bringing in private funding to augment scarce \npublic  funding.  Government  agencies  will  continue  to  be  responsible  for  overall  service  provision, \nincluding the regulation of tariffs and the collection of revenues. \n\nIndia  has  already  implemented  a  few  projects  in  the  transport  and  municipal  solid  waste \n4. \nsubsectors  using \nInfrastructure \nDevelopment  and  Finance  Corporation  (KUIDFC)  is  preparing  a  pilot  project  under  the  PDBPS \nmodality  in  the  city  of  Bijapur,  one  of  the  Investment  Program  ULBs,  for  the  water  supply  and \nsewerage subsectors, using its own resources.  \n\nthe  PBDPS  modality.  Furthermore, \n\nthe  Karnataka  Urban \n\n5. \n The  KUIDFC  undertook  an  initial  sounding  out  of  potential  local  contractors  during \npreparation  of  the  Investment  Program,  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  Fact-Finding \nMission  did  so  at  the  time  of  loan  appraisal,  and  a  comprehensive  workshop  was  held  with \nprospective  private  contractors  resulting  in  valuable  feedback.  The  workshop  was  primarily \nattended  by  local  contractors.1  The  consultants  recruited  by  ADB  to  carry  out  the  workshop  will \nfollow  up  with  a  detailed  market  research  exercise  in  the  form  of  a  written  survey  to  seek  further \nfeedback  from  private  contractors not  limited  to  those  who  attended  the  workshop.  The  workshop \nindicated that there are private contractors interested in participating in PBDPS contracts. The key \nconcerns  expressed  by  participants  at  the  workshop  will  be  taken  into  consideration  during  the \ncontract preparation stage. These include force majeure, provisions for price escalation, security of \nwater sources, payment guarantees, arbitration provisions, and provisions for independent auditors \nto  monitor  and  assess  performance  benchmarks.  The  participants  also  noted  that  strong  political \ncommitment  to  the  process  and  early  resolution  of  land  acquisition  issues  are  paramount  for  the \nsuccess of private sector participation (PSP) contracts. \n\nThe operating framework for the PBDPS modality necessitates a clear definition of services, \n6. \nwhose  delivery  will  be  the  responsibility  of  private  contractors,  rather  than  indicating  a  set  of \ndiscrete  activities  aimed  at  physical  improvements.  The  contracts  will  be  configured  in  such  a \nmanner that all activities relevant to service delivery are clearly identified and included in the terms \nof reference for the private contractor. In cases where making the private contractor responsible for \nthe  entire  range  of  activities  is  not  feasible,  the  contractors\u2019  specific  responsibilities  will  be  clearly \ndelineated.  \n\n                                                 \n1  Twelve private contractors, including two international contractors, attended the workshop. \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nThe consultants recruited under the bridging technical assistance (TA)2 will prepare a model \n7. \nrequest  for  proposal,  including  a  draft  contract  for  water  supply  and  sewerage  subprojects,  with \nsupport from international (individual) consultants recruited separately by ADB. \n\n8. \nThe  following  criteria  will  be  used  to  identify  the  amenability  to  and  appropriateness  of \nsubprojects  adopting  the  PBDPS  modality:  (i) the  ratio  of  the  cost  of  operations  to  total  life  cycle \ncost;  (ii) the  risk  allocation  among  relevant  parties  as  envisaged  under  the  PBDPS  modality;  and \n(iii) the size of the subproject, the willingness of urban ULBs to adopt the PBDPS modality, and the \ninterest of the private sector. The cost of operations is the net present value of O&M expenses and \ndebt  servicing  liabilities.  Total  life  cycle  is  the  sum  of  total  capital  investment  costs  (including \ninterest during construction and financing charges) and the cost of operations. Subprojects with a \ncost  of  operations  to  total  life  cycle  ratio  of  approximately  20%  or  more  could  be  considered \namenable  to  the  PBDPS  modality.  Similarly,  the  size  of  a  subproject  is  an  indicator  of  its \nattractiveness  to  private  contractors.  Other  factors  in  determining  whether  or  not  the  PBDPS \nmodality is appropriate include ULB-related concerns, such as geography and availability of human \nresources and physical resources. \n\nThe  KUIDFC  and  the  ULBs  will  recruit  private  contractors  with  support  from  the  program \n\n9. \nconsultants.  \n\n10. \nThe  KUIDFC  will  (i) act  as  the  fund  manager  for  the  PSP  fund  to  be  established  for \nsubprojects  using  the  PBDPS  modality;  (ii) act  as  the  technical  cell  for  developing  projects, \npreparing  draft  contracts  and  bidding  documents  and  requests  for  proposals,  assisting  with  the \nrecruitment  of  suitable  private  contractors,  and  helping  with  contract  execution  and  monitoring  of \ncontractors\u2019  performance;  and  (iii) assist  in  building  the  capacity  of  the  ULBs  for  contract \nmanagement, including monitoring contractors\u2019 performance. \n\nEach ULB will (i) provide all necessary approvals from its council for implementing identified \n11. \nsubprojects  using \nthe  contract  and  monitor  contractors\u2019 \nperformance;  (iii) enter  into  commitments  for  replenishing  and  ensuring  the  availability  of  funds  to \nmeet contractual obligations; (iv) ensure the timely fulfillment of project requirements, such as land \nacquisition  and  rights-of-way;  and  (v) assist  private  contractors  in  obtaining  relevant  permits  and \nclearances and resolving any local issues as required. \n\nthe  PBDPS  modality;  (ii) award \n\n12. \nThe  private  contractor  will  be  paid  annuity-like  payments  throughout  the  contract  period \n(typically  10  years),  subject  to  adherence  to  the  predetermined  performance  standards.  The \ncontract is broken into two phases: construction and operations. The payments would be made to \nthe  private  contractor  during  the  construction  phase  and  the  operations  phase  on  achieving \nrespective  sets  of  predetermined  milestones.  Each  payment  will  consist  of  a  base  fee  and  an \nadditional  incentive  bonus  linked  to  the  contractor\u2019s  performance  as  measured  by  a  set  of  key \nperformance  indicators.  Contracts  for  subprojects  using  the  PBDPS  modality  will  be  tripartite \ncontracts among the relevant Investment Program ULB, the private contractor, and the KUIDFC. \n\n13. \nThe KUIDFC will establish the PSP fund, which will safeguard contractors in case of default \nby  ULBs,  and  will  ensure  that  sufficient  funds  are  provided  for  and  maintained  under  this  facility. \nConsidering  the  innovative  nature  of  the  PBDPS,  such  a  fund  is  necessary  to  increase  bidders\u2019 \nconfidence  and  attract  private  financing.  Based  on  estimates  that  capital  investments  using  the \nPBDPS  (and/or  performance-based  management  contract)  modality  will  total  $50  million  and  that \nunder  the  payment  schedule  to  be  adopted,  the  maximum  exposure  by  contractors  will  total \napproximately $10 million, the value of the fund will be approximately $10 million. The fund release \nmechanism  will  be  developed  by  the  KUIDFC  with  the  assistance  of  the  bridging  TA  consultants \nand will be agreed on with ADB.  \n\n14. \nhypothetical case for the water supply and sewerage components for a typical ULB. \n\nA financial model has been prepared and a summary presented in Figure A4.1, based on a \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB.  2006.

Standards  are  minimum  requirements \n(e.g., water quality standards), with a failure to achieve them possibly triggering financial penalties \nfor  the  private  contractor,  while  key  performance  indicators  are  for  the  purpose  of  measuring  the \nprivate  contractor\u2019s  performance,  which  will  be  reflected  in  the  amount  of  additional  incentive \nbonuses paid. \n\nindicators \n\nfor \n\nAn independent auditor or engineer will review, monitor, and where contractually required, \n17. \napprove  activities  associated  with  design,  construction,  and  O&M  under  each  PBDPS  contract  to \nensure the private contractor\u2019s compliance with contract provisions. \n\n18. \nSubprojects  under  the  PBDPS  modality  will  be  procured  under  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement.  The  use  of  a  two-stage  bidding  procedure  to  be  preceded  by  prequalification  is \nproposed for the recruitment of private contractors under this modality. The first stage will involve \nthe  evaluation  of  technical  proposals,  which,  if  necessary,  will  be  revised  to  meet  specified \nrequirements by discussions between the ULB and the bidders. The second stage will involve the \nevaluation  of  financial  proposals,  prepared  based  on  revised  technical  proposals.  The  financial \nselection  of  the  bidders  will  be  based  on  the  minimum  annuity  payment,  which  also  reflects  a \nlifetime cost approach. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n19. \nThe  private  contractor  will  be  responsible  for  managing  system  O&M  and  for  delivering \nservices,  including  overseeing  investments  on  behalf  of  the  ULB  for  the  relevant  subsector.  In \nparticular, the tasks of the private contractor will include the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\nDesign  and  build  infrastructure  facilities  in  line  with  specified  output  requirements \nand construction standards. \nOperate the systems according to specified operational standards. \nImprove  long-term  performance  and  efficiency  and  expand  service  coverage  in  the \nULB\u2019s service area. \nContinue mass meter installation and connection programs in the ULB. \nImprove the O&M of water supply and wastewater systems through various means, \nsuch as using staff efficiently, rehabilitating distribution networks, improving customer \nservice, enhancing occupational safety practices, and reducing leakage. \nAssist  and  advise  the  ULB  in  relation  to  network  expansion  planning,  investment \nbudget preparation, and tariff setting. \nImprove  the  long-term  effectiveness  of  the  ULB\u2019s  human  resources  through  a \ncapacity building and skills transfer program. \nImplement  programs  to  expand  water  distribution  networks,  including  bulk  water \nmetering, properly sequenced network rehabilitation, and renewal of connections. \nResolve customer complaints and measure customer satisfaction. \n\n(ix) \n \nArrangements for Personnel and Organizational Structure \n\nC. \n\n20. \nGiven the strong policy stand taken by the government of Karnataka (GoK) in freezing staff \nrecruitment for more than a decade, most ULBs are not overstaffed. In addition to a few senior staff \nassigned by the state, the ULBs have their own staff to oversee operations in each subsector. For \nwater supply and sewerage, for instance, the ULBs have between 20 and 45 permanent staff. \n\n21. \nThe bridging TA consultants will help GoK formulate a post-PBDPS operations strategy and \na  human  resources  strategy  for  existing  ULB  employees  affected  by  the  introduction  of  PBDPS \ncontracts.  \n \n22. \nThe implementing agencies will undertake the following preparatory  measures to ensure a \nsmooth  transition  and  a  sustainable  organizational  structure  in  relation  to  the  private  contractors \nduring and after the PBDPS contracts: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nfor \n\nto  delegate \n\nthe  ULBs  and  agree \n\nFor  the  water  supply  and  sewerage  subsector,  GoK  will  continue  its  recruitment \nfreeze  policy \ntheir  service  provision \nresponsibilities to the private contractors. \nThe KUIDFC and the ULBs will consult with staff in the concerned subsector(s), as \nwell as with the Directorate of Municipal Administration and the Municipal Employees \nAssociation,  to  prepare  the  following  options,  which  will  be  offered  to  current \nemployees: \n(a) \n\nStaff  may  be  assigned  to  the  private  contractor  for  a  maximum  period  of  5 \nyears  in  line  with  rule  2004  of  the  Karnataka  Municipal  Corporation,  with  a \nprovision for extension with mutual agreement. \nStaff  may  agree  to  enter  into  the  voluntary  retirement  scheme  if  offered  by \nGoK. \nStaff may be reassigned to other ULB functions or departments. \n\n(c) \nA  comprehensive  list  of current  employees  in  various  categories,  such  as  assistant \nor junior engineers, work inspectors, valve workers, fitters, clerks, and bill collectors, \nwill be prepared as part of the requests for proposal and draft contract documents for \nsubprojects using the PBDPS. ULBs will provide the bidders with the names, ages, \nqualifications, and terms of employment of each of these employees. \n\n(b) \n\nAs  part  of  their  proposals,  the  bidders  will  then  be  required  to  submit  strategies  for  taking \n23. \nover  a  certain  minimum  percentage  of  the  permanent  employees  (the  percentage  to  be  decided \nafter  consultation  between  the  ULB  and  the  bidders  at  the  prebid  conference  for  each  subproject \nusing  the  PBDPS).  Bidders  will  be  given  incentives  to  take  the  maximum  number  of  current \nemployees  as  part  of  their  capacity-building  and  skills  transfer  strategy.  The  length  of  their \nassignment to the private contractor and the strategy and arrangements for their return to the ULB \nwill also form part of the bidders\u2019 proposals, which will subsequently be agreed to between the ULB \nand the private contractor. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n41 \n\n24. \nThe  private  contractor  will  have  full  day-to-day  management  responsibilities  over  the \nassigned  staff  from  the  date  of  their  deputation.  The  contractor  shall  ensure  that  assigned  ULB \nemployees  are  entitled  to  wages,  increments,  bonuses,  paid  leaves  of  absence,  and  all  other \nemployee  benefits  and  entitlements  in  the  same  manner  as  or  better  than  what  such  employees \nwould have been entitled to in the employment of the ULBs in the absence of such assignment. \n\nDuring  the  initial  5-year  period,  the  assigned  staff  will  have  the  opportunity  to  assess  the \n25. \nopportunities offered to them, such as returning to the ULB or becoming permanent employees of \nthe private contractor. At an early stage of the contract, the ULB must provide a clear post-PBDPS \noperational strategy for the private contractor, in consultation with ADB, so that the contractor can \neither offer permanent employment to the employees or return them to the ULB. \n\n26. \nadditional staff from the ULB. \n\nAfter the expiry of the initial 5 years, the private contractor will not be obliged to take on any \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nKEY FEATURES AND OUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR PERFORMANCE-BASED \nMANAGEMENT CONTRACTS \n\nA. \n\nRecruitment Procedures \n\n1. \nThe workshop held during the appraisal of the Investment Program revealed that while \nsome private contractors are interested in participating in performance-based deferred payment \nstructure (PBDPS) contracts, the level of interest may decline as more of the contractual details \nare  determined  and  the  full  extent  of  private  contractors\u2019  responsibilities  under  the  PBDPS \nbecomes  more  widely  known.  The  ADB  and  the  Government  of  Karnataka  (GoK)  therefore \nconsidered it prudent to develop a performance-based management contract (PBMC) option as \na  less  onerous  alternative  for  some  subprojects.  Under  this  arrangement,  the  management \ncontractor  will  be  reimbursed  through  a  base  fee  (i.e.,  for  experts\u2019  inputs  and  out-of-pocket \nexpenditures)  for  management  services  and  additional  performance-based  incentive  bonus \npayments  linked  to  its  performance  as  measured  by  a  set  of  key  performance  indicators.  A \nmanagement contract that does not require the management contractor to invest in the physical \ninfrastructure  of  water  supply  and  wastewater  systems  is  more  straightforward  and  less  risky \n(for  the  urban  local  body  (ULB)  as  well  as  for  the  private  contractor)  than  other  private  sector \nparticipation  modalities  that  require  financial  investments  by  the  private  sector  such  as  the \nPBDPS.  Recruitment  of  management  contractors  will  be  carried  out  under  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB's) Guidelines on the Use of Consultants with some adjustments. \n\n2. \nyears, with a possibility of extension. \n\nThe  typical  length  of  contracts  under  the  PBMC  modality  will  range  between  3  and  6 \n\nThe  management  contractor  will  be  a  company  or  consortium  of  companies  that  will \n3. \nhave  direct  responsibility  for  managing  the  operations  of  a  proposed  subproject  for  the \nconcerned  ULB.  The  management  contractor  will  have  to  bear  much  more  risk  than  a  typical \nconsultant, because a substantial amount of the contractor\u2019s total remuneration will depend on \nits  success  in  improving  the  delivery  of  services  currently  provided  by  the  ULB.  In  addition, \nwhen  preparing  its  proposals,  the  management  contractor  will  have  to  investigate  the  state  of \nexisting  systems  in  greater  depth  than  the  typical  consultant,  and  the  costs  of  preparing  a \nproposal will be therefore be higher. Because of the limited number of private contractors with \nthe  required  expertise  and  possible  limited  interest  because  of  the  high  costs  of  preparing  a \ncompetitive  proposal,  the  shortlist  may  not  meet  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  of \n\"normally 5\u20137 firms.\" \n\n4. \nshortlisting will include the following:  \n\nTo  come  up  with  a  shortlist  of  qualified  companies  and/or  consortia,  the  criteria  for \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\na  set  of  criteria  to  identify  companies  and/or  consortia  that  have  the  necessary \npractical  operating  experience  and  financial  capacity  to  be  able  to  execute  the \ncontract successfully; and \na  summary  of  the  experience  and  skills  of  the  companies  and/or  consortia, \ntogether with brief responses to a list of questions that focus on how they have \naddressed  or  would  address  problems  similar  to  those  the  ULBs  would  face  in \nimproving service provision in the concerned subsectors. \n\n5. \nAn  evaluation  committee  would  consider  private  contractors  meeting  these  criteria  for \nshortlisting based on expressions of interest received.1 The primary weight in this evaluation will \nbe  given  to  each  contractor's  corporate  experience  and  approach  to  managing  operational \nproblems  such  as  those  prevalent  in  north  Karnataka.  Ensuring  a  reasonable  geographic  and \ncountry balance in the resulting shortlist of contractors may be difficult, as the expertise required \nfor  such  services  is  not  widely  available.  It  is  therefore  proposed  by  ADB  to  waive  the \nguidelines' \"reasonable\" geographic and country balance requirement. However, contractors are \nfree  to  associate  with  any  regional  and  national  firms  and  individuals  from  ADB  member \ncountries  to  strengthen  their  proposals.  Also  contractors  must  demonstrate  not  only  their  in-\ndepth technical strengths, but also the availability of high-quality backup support to ensure that \nthey can fulfill their commitment during the period of the contract. The shortlisted contractors will \nthen  be  invited  to  submit  technical  proposals  containing  detailed  technical  plans  for  operating \n                                                 \n1  Interested companies and/or consortia will be given an expression of interest template to complete. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n43 \n\nand  improving  the  services  and  systems  together  with  financial  proposals  in  line  with  the \nrequest  for  proposal  documents.  The  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  is  used  in \naccordance with the guidelines. \n\n6. \nThe evaluation of the technical proposals submitted will give approximately equal weight \nto  (i) the  qualifications  of  the  individuals  making  up  the  proposed  management  team;  (ii) the \nexperience,  expertise,  and  support  facilities  of  the  contractors;  and  (iii) the  proposals  for \noperating and improving the services and systems. The proposed management team for each \ncontractor  will  be  required  to  present  its  proposal  to  the  Karnataka  Urban  Infrastructure \nDevelopment and Finance Corporation and the pertinent ULB and to answer questions about its \nmembers\u2019 experience and the team\u2019s approach to addressing the problems the ULB is facing. \nThe  financial  proposals  will  indicate  the  contractor\u2019s  costs  for  performing  the  services \n(remuneration  and  out-of-pocket  expenditures).

Less than 30% of households have access to water connections, and in \nslum  areas  the  figure  is  less  than  10%.  More  than  75%  of  slum  dwellers  in  north  Karnataka  towns  such  as  Bellary, \nGagad-Betageri,  Gulbarga,  Koppal,  and  Rabkavi-Banhatti  and  45%  to  60%  in  Badami,  Basavakalyan,  Davangere, \nGokak,  Raichur,  and  Yadgir  depend  on  standposts  (public  taps).  The  slum  populations  also  receive  lower  water \npressure  delivered  less  frequently  and  in  shorter  durations  compared  with  the  general  population.  In  addition,  more \nthan 85% of slum households lack access to safe sanitation. Lack of access to underground drainage connections was \nreported by slum households in 16 of the 25 initially identified Investment Program ULBs. Surveys also show that more \nthan 60% of slum dwellers in the Investment Program ULBs report poor access to roads.  \n \nSecondary data from the Karnataka Slum Clearance Board place the slum population in Investment Program ULBs at \nroughly 20% of the total population. A baseline socioeconomic survey conducted in the slums of Investment Program \nULBs shows that 85% of the slum population accounts for the core and intermediate poor (with a household income of \nless  than  Rs2,500  per  month).  The  Investment  Program  is  expected  to  benefit  all  slum  households  residing  in \nrecognized slums (70% of the total slum population) in Investment Program ULBs. It will also benefit poor households \nin  nonslum  areas  (15%  of  the  total  urban  population).  The  Investment  Program  will  result  in  better  access  to  urban \ninfrastructure services. Benefits from the sanitation component are expected to accrue to households connected to the \nsewerage network. Networks will be provided in densely built-up core and unserved or underserved areas. Sewerage \nnetworks  will reach the boundaries of slum  areas,  which  will  enable the  networking  of a  large number  of slums and \nprovide  low-cost  toilets  connected  to  sewers.  Benefits  to  poor  households  from  the  road  component  will  be  through \nemployment  generation  and  access.  Water  supply  will  benefit  all  Investment  Program  urban  local  body  populations. \nBroader  benefits  to  the  poor  will  include  economic  growth  and  employment  generation.  In  addition,  the  slum \nimprovement component will result in community development in poor areas. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nPoverty impact analyses undertaken in three Investment Program ULBs suggest that 30% to 50% of beneficiaries for \nthe water supply component comprise the core and intermediate poor (the proportion varies between 25% to 40% for \nsewerage  and  80%  to  100%  for  drainage.  Participatory  analysis  using  a  combination  of  qualitative  and  quantitative \ntechniques  will  gauge  post\u2013Investment  Program  benefits  in  terms  of  improved  access  to  urban  infrastructure  and \nservices  by  the  poor.  The  baseline  survey  will  serve  as  the  benchmark  against  which  post\u2013Investment  Program \nimpacts on the poor  will be measured. Benefits to poor  households, benefits to  women, increased participation, and \ncapacity building of the poor (including women) are some of the items that will be measured and monitored following \nimplementation. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nStakeholder  consultations  have  been  an  important  element  of  the  Investment  Program\u2019s  development  and  design. \nConsultation  workshops  were  held  with  those  affected,  district  and  municipal  officials,  elected  representatives, \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  eminent  citizens.  Workshops  were  held  during  the  initial  phase  of  the \nstudy  and  following  the  selection  and  prioritization  of  proposed  interventions  in  each  Investment  Program  town. \nBaseline  surveys  and  focus  group  discussions  held  in  slum  and  nonslum  Investment  Program  ULBs  obtained  the \nexpressed needs of communities and recorded people\u2019s opinions. Consultations and interactions with the community \nhelped identify and prioritize subprojects in each Investment Program ULB. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nPublic  participation  has  been  a  key  feature  of  the  Investment  Program\u2019s  design  and  will  continue  through  detailed \ndesign,  planning,  implementation,  and  operation  and  maintenance.  The  strategy  for  public  participation  focuses  on \npartnership  building  between  NGOs,  business  communities,  urban  local  bodies,  stakeholder  agencies  like  the \nKarnataka  Slum  Clearance  Board,  and  neighborhoods.  An  assessment  of  communities\u2019  absorptive  capacity  was \nundertaken prior to preparing the participation strategy. Local, town-, and district-level NGOs and an apex NGO will be \ninvolved in monitoring community participation. Ongoing consultation and participatory monitoring will help ensure that \nthe Investment Program meets communities\u2019 needs, thereby contributing to sustainability. The participation strategy is \nin Supplementary Appendix H. \n\nTargeting Classification: General Intervention \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No  \n\n  Yes \n\n   No \n\n                                                 \n1  Government of Karnataka. 2002.

Gender Development \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nPrimary and secondary information has been analyzed to assess the status of women in Investment Program ULBs. \nBaseline  survey  information  shows  that  the  town-level  proportion  of  female-headed  households  is  up  to  15%.  The \nproportion  is  larger  in  slums,  particularly  Koppal  (50%);  Gokak  and  Ranebennur  (30%);  and  Haveri,  Nippani,  and \nRaichur (20% to 25%). The female work participation rate in slums in Investment Program ULBs averages 10%\u2014and \nnotably  higher  in  Haveri  (35%),  Chamarajnagar  (23%),  and  Ilkal  (19%)\u2014compared  with  nonslum  populations. \nDisparities in the educational attainment of women is evident in Investment Program ULBs for both slum and nonslum \npopulations.  \n \nThe  gender  strategy  proposed  for  the  Investment  Program  focuses  participation  by  women,  which  is  expected  to \nmaximize beneficial impacts on women. The Investment Program proposes an increased role than currently observed \nin  decision  making  by  women  in  Investment  Program  design,  implementation,  and  monitoring.  The  Investment \nProgram  is  expected  to  result  in  benefits  for  women  that  include  a  reduced  burden  in  relation  to  collecting  water, \nhealth benefits, and employment opportunities. Monitoring and evaluation systems will generate gender-disaggregated \ninformation to enable tracking of the Investment Program\u2019s gender impacts.  \n \nHas an output been prepared? \nThe gender strategy is in Supplementary Appendix I and a gender action plan is provided in Appendix 11. The gender \naction plan details goals and objectives from a gender perspective, actions to be taken, indicators and mechanisms for \nmonitoring, and responsibilities to be assigned to various stakeholders at various stages of the Investment Program. \n \nE.

Short resettlement \nplans have been prepared for sample subprojects and a \nresettlement framework has been prepared to guide the \nimplementation of future subprojects.  \nThe proposed water tariff increase will not have significant \nnegative impacts on the poor (2% of household income). \nconsidering that 5.5% of household income is now spent \non alternatives to piped water. To ensure affordability for \nthe poor, a lifeline tariff is part of the proposed water tariff \nstructure.    \nThe Investment Program will result in 450,000 person-\ndays of employment in construction and operations. \nPrivate sector participation will not result in a loss of \nemployment of those currently employed by the \nGovernment of Karnataka.  \n\nSubprojects are not anticipated to result in any negative \nimpacts to indigenous peoples. Sample subprojects were \nnot found to have any impacts on indigenous peoples. \nHowever, an indigenous peoples development framework \nhas been formulated by the Karnataka Urban \nInfrastructure Development and Finance Corporation to \nensure that Investment Program benefits are equally \nshared should a future subproject affect indigenous \npeoples \n \nNo other risks or vulnerabilities have

Investment  Program  will  facilitate  economic  growth  in  towns  of  north  Karnataka  and \nbring  about  urban  development  by  means  of  equitable  distribution  of  urban  services  in  an \nenvironmentally sound and operationally sustainable manner. The Investment Program will help the \nGovernment  of  Karnataka  (GoK)  rehabilitate  and  construct  urban  infrastructure,  including  water \nsupply  systems,  sewerage  systems,  drainage,  and  urban  road  improvements  through  resurfacing \nand  junction  improvements.  It  will  have  poverty  reduction,  institutional  development,  investment \nprogram assistance,1 and nonmunicipal infrastructure2 components.  \nThe  Investment  Program  is  designed  so  as  to  minimize  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \n2. \nimpacts.  Subprojects  involving  rehabilitation  will  be  accommodated  within  the  premises  of  existing \nfacilities and will not involve land acquisition and resettlement. Subprojects involving the construction \nof water supply systems, sewage treatment plants, and nonmunicipal infrastructure are proposed on \nGovernment  land  wherever  possible.  Overall  impacts  are  to  be  further  minimized  through  careful \nsubproject siting and alignment during detailed design and subproject implementation.3 \n3. \nShort resettlement plans were prepared for sample subprojects in three Investment Program \nULBs  (Haveri,  Hospet,  and  Raichur)  (Supplementary  Appendixes  J1  to  J3).4  Permanent  land \nacquisition  is  required  for  sewage  treatment  plants  in  Haveri  (13  hectares),  Hospet  (12  hectares), \nand Raichur (14 hectares). There are no structures on the proposed sewage treatment plant sites, \nwhich  are  currently  being  used  for  agriculture.  No  permanent  or  temporary  land  acquisition  is \nanticipated  for  road  resurfacing.  The  laying  of  water  and  sewer  pipelines  and  drain  improvements \nare proposed within existing road corridors, and only temporary land acquisition that affects hawkers \nand  vendors  is  anticipated  during  construction.  Impacts  will  be  finalized  during  detailed  design.

The  resettlement  framework  outlines  the  objectives,  policy  principles, \nand procedures for land acquisition (if required), compensation, and other assistance measures for \nthose affected. The resettlement framework is based on the Land Acquisition Act (1894, amended in \n1984),  the  national  policy  on  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  for  Investment  Program-affected \npersons,  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement.5  The \n\n                                                 \n1   Covering  the  construction  of  the  Karnataka  Urban  Infrastructure  Development  and  Finance  Corporation  building  on \n\nvacant government land. \n\n2  Covering firefighting, lake development, tourism, and sports. \n3  The  total  estimated  land  requirement  for  the  Investment  Program  in  25  subproject  ULBs  is  512.12  hectares.  Of  this, \n215.8 hectares are Government land. About 300 hectares will need to be acquired, of which about 120 hectares have \nnot yet been identified.   \n\n4  Sample  ULBs  were  selected  based  on  their  representation  of  the  25  project  ULBs,  geographic  location  (indicating \ninfrastructure  requirement  characteristics),  availability  of  existing  infrastructure  facilities,  and  presence  of  multiple \nsubprojects. \n\n5  ADB. 1995.

The Investment Program will help the \nGovernment  of  Karnataka  (GoK)  rehabilitate  and  construct  urban  infrastructure,  including  water \nsupply  systems,  sewerage  systems,  drainage,  and  urban  road  improvements  through  resurfacing \nand  junction  improvements.  It  will  have  poverty  reduction,  institutional  development,  investment \nprogram  assistance,1  and  nonmunicipal  infrastructure2  components.  An  initial  environmental \nexamination  (IEE)  (Supplementary  Appendix  K)  and  IEEs  for  subprojects3  in  three  Investment \nProgram ULBs (Haveri, Hospet, and Raichur) (Supplementary Appendixes J1 to J3) were prepared. \nIEEs were based on field surveys, secondary information, and discussions with stakeholders.  \n\nB. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n2. \nSector Impacts. The Investment Program is designed to maximize environmental benefits. \nNet  environmental  impacts  are  positive  and  large,  including  (i) improved  quality  of  drinking  water \nfrom  water  supply  investments;  (ii) improved  surface  and  groundwater  quality;  (iii)  improved  public \nhealth as a result of water supply, sanitation, and drainage investments; (iv) reduced flooding as a \nresult of drainage investments; (v) reduced volume of suspended particulates in the air as a result of \nimproved roads; and (vi) increased social benefits from community participation and investments in \nnonmunicipal  infrastructure.  Negative  impacts  of  some  components,  notably  the  sewage  treatment \nplants,  will  not  be  significant  considering  the  scale  of  the  Investment  Program  and  the  mitigation \nmeasures that will be incorporated in designs (Supplementary Appendix N). \n\n3. \nSubproject  Impacts.  Subproject  selection  will ensure  that  the  Investment  Program  will  not \nhave  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  or  impacts  on  environmentally  sensitive  areas. \nImpacts that are potentially severe and permanent in nature have been identified, and the criteria for \nsubproject  selection  will  result  in  the  rejection  of  subprojects  with  such  impacts  (Supplementary \nAppendix  N).  Potential  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  mostly  localized  and  temporary.  These \nimpacts can largely be avoided through proper subproject design (particularly in relation to siting) or \nmitigated  by  means  of  proper  mitigation  measures  and  environmental  management.  Potential \nadverse impacts and mitigation measures are summarized in Table A13.1 (details in Supplementary \nAppendixes M1 to M3).  \n\nTable A13.1: Potential Adverse Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\nPotential Adverse Impact \n\nSeverity  Duration \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nCategory \nA.

Four divisional offices will assist the PMU. The implementing agencies will \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n69 \n\nbe the Investment Program urban local bodies (ULBs); the Karnataka Urban Slum Clearance Board; \nthe  Directorate  of  Municipal  Administration;  the  Department  of  Information,  Tourism,  and  Youth \nServices;  Karnataka  State  Fire  and  Emergency  Services;  the  Lake  Development  Authority;  the \nKarnataka Urban Water Supply and Drainage Board; and the KUIDFC. An environmental engineer \nin each ULB will be responsible for environmental assessment, monitoring, and management.4  \n\n \nEnvironmental  monitoring  plans  in  the  IEEs  identify  environmental  monitoring  activities  to \n5. \nensure  that  negative  environmental  impacts  are  addressed.  The  IEEs  also  identify  agencies  and \ninstitutions  responsible  for  monitoring  and  provide  indicative  monitoring  costs  (Supplementary \nAppendixes M1 to M3). The PMU will undertake monitoring during preconstruction work. The PMU \nwill  be  responsible  for  providing  technical  approval  for  subprojects  after  verifying  designs  and \nincorporating  mitigation  measures  into  design  and  contract  documents.  During  construction, \nmonitoring  will  largely be  undertaken  by  contractors  and ULBs.  The ULBs  will  monitor  contractors\u2019 \nenvironmental  performance.  During  the  operational  stage,  monitoring  will  continue  to  be  the \nresponsibility of ULBs. Third-party monitoring will be undertaken by relevant government agencies, \nsuch as pollution control boards. \n \n6. \nThe  ULBs  will  prepare  progress  reports  on  all  aspects  of  environmental  assessment, \nmanagement, and monitoring. Independent monitoring will be undertaken by academic or research \ninstitutions with experience in environmental assessment that the KUIDFC will engage to carry out \nexternal  monitoring  of  the  environmental  assessment  and  management  process  for  the  entire \nInvestment  Program.  External  monitoring  will  be  carried  out  twice  a  year  during  implementation  of \nthe Investment Program. Reports will be submitted to the KUIDFC and the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  for  review.  During  review  missions,  ADB  will  also  assess  environmental  compliance  with \nADB\u2019s Environmental Policy.5  \n\nincluding  representatives  of \n\nPublic Consultation and Disclosure \n\n \nD. \n \n7. \nDuring  preparation  of  the  Investment  Program,  consultations  were  undertaken  with  various \nlocal  governments,  government  agencies, \nstakeholder  groups, \nnongovernment  organizations,  urban  residents,  and  affected  persons.  These  consultations  were \nconducted at various levels (Investment Program level,6 ULB level,7 and subproject level8) and took \nthe  form  of  workshops,  individual  and  focus  group  discussions,  and  surveys.  Community \nparticipation  was  ensured  through  a  sample  survey.  During  preparation  of  the  resettlement  plan, \nthose affected by land acquisition for sewage treatment plants in all three ULBs were consulted and \npotential  environmental  impacts  for  proposed  sewage  treatment  plants,  safeguards,  and  impact \nmitigation  measures  were  disclosed  during  the  consultations.  During  detailed  design,  more \ninformation  will  be  disclosed  and  public  awareness  programs  will  be  conducted.  The  IEEs  will  be \ntranslated into the local language and presented by means of public notices at ULB offices and the \nmass  media.  They  will  also  be  posted  on  the  KUIDFC  web  site.  Information  dissemination  and \nconsultation will continue throughout implementation of the Investment Program. \n \nE. \n \n8. \nThe IEEs show that subprojects in sample Investment Program ULBs will result in large net \nenvironmental  benefits  and  will  not  generate  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts.  Potential \nadverse environmental impacts are largely temporary and localized and can be addressed through \nsubproject  design  and  mitigation  measures.  No  further  assessment  of  environmental  impacts  is \nrequired for subprojects in sample Investment Program ULBs.  \n \n\nFindings, Recommendations, and Conclusion \n\n                                                 \n4   ULB environmental engineers have recently been recruited based on the Government\u2019s revised Cadre and Recruitment \nPolicy, to ensure compliance with requirements for all urban infrastructure projects particularly solid waste management. \nThe KUIDFC, through the PMU will provide support to the ULB environmental engineers in environmental management. \nTraining  for  ULB  environmental  engineers  will  be  in  the  form  of  support  during  subproject  design  and  implementation \nfrom the PMU, program consultants, and the Pollution Control Board. \n\n5  ADB. 2002.
