Subsequently,  what  began  as  a  financial  crisis\nrapidly  spilled  over  to  the  real  sectors  revealing  significant\nremaining  policy  distortions.  The  industry  sector  has  been\naffected  by  a  legacy  of  discretionary,  nontransparent,  and\nanticompetitive practices that inhibited structural change and led\nto  a  highly  concentrated  industrial  structure  biased  in  favor  of\nlarge  firms.  The  restraints  to  competition  have  imposed  costs\nthrough  higher  prices,  limited  consumer  and  business  choice,\ncross-subsidies benefiting inefficient firms at the cost of efficient\nfirms,  and  inadequate  incentives  for  innovation  and  efficiency.\nFurthermore,  a  complex  system  of  approvals,  licenses,  and\npermits  has  imposed  significant  operational  costs  on  business\u2013\nespecially for SMEs. This regulatory system continues to impede\nthe  efficient  allocation  of  resources  and  the  ability  of  domestic\nfirms  to  compete  effectively  in  overseas  markets  and  against\nimports.\n\nComplex  and  burdensome  license  and  approval  procedures  for\nboth  domestic  and  foreign  investment,  and  insufficient  weight\ngiven  to  the  promotional  and  facilitation  role  of  the  investment\ncoordination  agency  have  created  significant  impediments  to\nefforts  to  attract  and  promote  investment.  The  legal  basis  for\nforeign  investment  policies  and  institutions  remains  unchanged\nfrom  the  1960s,  and  gives  limited  assurances  of  safety  and\nsecurity  to  both  domestic  and  foreign  investors.  Nontransparent\ncustoms procedures delay shipments and undermine the impact\nof policy liberalization. The uncertainty and risk resulting from this\nsystem  have  compounded \ninvestor\nconfidence.\n\nthe  ongoing  crisis  of \n\nAssistance to the SME sector has achieved only limited success\nin mitigating SME difficulties in operating in a nontransparent and\ncomplex  regulatory  environment.  Targeted  assistance  for  SMEs\nhas often not been cost effective and subsidized credit schemes\nin particular have led to incentive distortions, weakening of credit\nculture, nonrepayment, and misallocation of resources.\n\nThe  economic  crisis  calls  for  decisive  policy  signals  to  ensure\nmarket  efficiency;  restore  confidence  of  investors,  lenders,  and\nproducers;  and  position  the  economy  for  recovery.  This  will\nrequire  rationalizing  the  trade  and  industrial  regime  to  promote\n\n\fObjective \nand Scope\n\niii\n\nderegulation  and  competition  and  thus  provide  assurances  that\nmarkets  will  operate  more  efficiently  and  transparently,  so  that\nwhen resources are committed to commercial activities, there are\nreasonable prospects that they will be employed productively.\n\nincluding  SMEs.  This \n\nis \n(ii) promoting \n\nThe  Program\u2019s  objective  is  to  support  economic  recovery  and\nsustained growth by encouraging a more diversified and efficient\nindustrial structure through deregulation and adoption of policies\nthat promote competition, and provide a level playing field for all\nenterprises \nto  be  achieved  by\n(i) strengthening  competition, \ninvestment  and\nfacilitating  trade,  and  (iii)  rationalizing  assistance  to  SMEs.  The\nindustrial  deregulation  and  liberalization  will  promote  industrial\ndevelopment consistent with Indonesia\u2019s comparative advantage\nand  competitive  edge;  this  will  help  revive  economic  growth.  A\ndynamic  SME  sector  will  generate  employment  and  reduce\npoverty.  The  resulting  impetus  to  structural  change  is  expected\nto lead to a reduction of the concentrated structure of industry in\nIndonesia with concomitant benefits in terms of a more even size\ndistribution of firms and market power, and increased consumer\nwelfare.  The  reforms  will  improve  governance  by  reducing  the\nopportunities for rent seeking and corruption.\n\nCategory  C.  The    environmental    implications  of    the    Program\nare minimal.\n\nfrom  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \n\nIt  is    proposed    that    ADB  support  the  Government\u2019s  policy\nreform  program by providing a loan of $200 million.1 The loan will\ninterest\nbe \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  pool-based  variable\nlending  rate  system  for  US  dollar  loans  and  a  commitment\ncharge  of  0.75  percent  per  annum  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nstandard procedure. A front-end fee will be payable in an amount\nequal to 1 percent of the loan. The loan will have an amortization\nperiod of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years.\n\nresources  with \n\nThe program period will be two years. The loan will be released\nin  two  equal  tranches.  The  first  tranche  ($100  million)  will  be\nmade available upon loan effectiveness. The second tranche will\nconsist  of  an  incentive  subtranche  and  a  final  subtranche,  of\nequal  amounts  ($50  million  each),  to  be  released  in  December\nsatisfactory\n2000 \n2001, \nimplementation of the agreed conditions.\n\nand  September \n\nsubject \n\nto \n\nClassification\n\nEconomic Growth\n\nEnvironmental\nAssessment:\n\nThe ADB Loan\n\nLoan Amount\nand Terms\n\nProgram Period\n\n            and Tranching\n\nExecuting\nAgency\n\nMinistry of Finance\n\n                                                          \n1 The  possibilities  of  loan  cofinancing  have  been  pursued  in  conjunction  with  the  ADB  loan  from  the  beginning  of\nprogram processing. Potential loan cofinanciers include, among others, Japan Bank for International Cooperation.\n\n\fiv\n\nProcurement and\nDisbursement\n\nThe    loan    proceeds    will    be    utilized    to      finance      the    full\nforeign exchange  costs  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of\nimports procured in and from ADB member countries, other than\nthose  specified  in  the  list  of  ineligible  items  and  those  items\nfinanced  by  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  official  sources.  All\nprocurement  under  the  loan  will  be  undertaken  through  normal\ncommercial practices for the private sector or the Government\u2019s\nprescribed procurement procedures acceptable to ADB, with due\nconsideration  to  economy  and  efficiency.  The  Borrower  will\ncertify that the volume of eligible imports exceeds the amount of\nthe  projected  disbursements  under  the  ADB  loan  in  a  given\nperiod. ADB will have the right to audit the use of loan proceeds\nand to verify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification.\n\nCounterpart\nFunds\n\nThe counterpart  funds  to  be generated  from  the loan proceeds\nwill  be  used  to  finance  the  cost  of  structural  adjustment  and\nactivities consistent with the Program.\n\nTechnical Assistance\n\nPromoting\nDeregulation and\nCompetition\n\n Small and Medium\nEnterprise\nDevelopment\n\ntask \n\nforce \n\nthat  will  help \n\nthe  Commission \n\nThe  advisory  TA  of  $1.5  million  will  support  a  deregulation  and\nfor\ncompetition \nCompetition  Supervision  simplify  the  policy  framework,  promote\ncompetition  policy  according  to  best  practice,  and  to  develop\ncapacity to review commercial laws and regulations that impede\ncompetition,  with  a  view  to  eliminating  those  that  cannot  be\njustified  in  terms  of  net  public  benefits.  The  TA  will  be  financed\non a grant basis from the Asian Currency Crisis Support Facility\n(ACCSF),  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan.  It  is  estimated\nthat about 30 person-months of international consulting services\nand  30  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  will  be\nrequired.  All  consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with\nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other\narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  recruitment  of  domestic\nconsultants.\n\nThe  advisory  TA  of  $2  million  will  help  the  SME  Task  Force\nevaluate  existing  support  programs  and  develop  a  strategy  for\nSME  development.  The  SME  policy  framework  should  focus  on\nrationalizing the institutional mandate for SME policy formulation\nand implementation, and the provision of business and financial\nsupport  in  accordance  with  international  best  practice.  The  TA\nwill be financed on a grant basis from the ACCSF, funded by the\nGovernment  of  Japan.  It  is  estimated  that  about  40  person-\nmonths  of  international  consulting  services  and  50  person-\nmonths  of  domestic  consulting  services  will  be  required.  All\nconsultants  will  be  engaged \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other  arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB for recruitment of domestic consultants.\n\n\fv\n\nThe key concern is the adverse transitional consequences of the\nadjustment  program  such  as \nlabor  retrenchment,  subsidy\nreductions, and higher user fees, which could provoke resistance\nfrom  affected  groups,  slow  the  pace  of  reforms,  and  jeopardize\ntheir  sustainability.  This  risk  is  mitigated  by  the  Government\u2019s\nstrong commitment to the reform agenda and its efforts to reach\nconsensus, as well as by the provision of financial support by the\ninternational  community.  While  the  program  aims  to  remove\npolicy inefficiencies, the counterpart funds from the program will\nhelp  finance  the  provision  of  safety  nets  for  groups  most  hard-\npressed  by  the  economic  crisis.  The  risk  of  policy  reversals  is\nfurther mitigated by governance reforms that strengthen the role\nof  independent  agencies  such  as  BI,  and  the  Commission  for\nCompetition  Supervision.  Finally,  measures  taken  to  reduce\neconomic  rent  seeking  are  expected  to  strengthen  public\nconfidence in the reform program.\n\nA  second  risk  is  the  possibility  that  measures  to  rationalize\nsubsidized  credit  policies  will  be  misconceived  as  reductions  in\ncredit and support for vulnerable sectors. This risk is mitigated by\nthe  Program  and  associated  TA,  which  call \nfor  public\nconsultation  and  the  participation  of  SMEs  in  the  formulation  of\nmore effective policies to promote the sector and meet its needs\nfor business services, credit, and capacity building.\n\nA third risk is that bank and corporate restructuring  will  proceed\nat a slow pace. This would mean that fewer firms would be able\nto  take  advantage  of  the  opportunities  to  reposition  themselves\nprovided by the improving industrial policy environment. This risk\nis  mitigated  by \nthe  Government\u2019s  recent  adoption  of  an\nenhanced  strategy  for  restructuring  and  by  the  substantial\nassistance  being  provided  by  the  International  Monetary  Fund,\nADB,  World  Bank,  and  bilateral  funding  agencies  for  bank  and\ncorporate restructuring.\n\nRisks and\nSafeguards\n\n \n\n\f1.\nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  Report  and  Recommendation  on  (i)  a proposed\nloan  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Industrial  Competitiveness  and  Small  and  Medium\nEnterprise Development Program and (ii) two technical assistance (TA) grants for (a) Promoting\nDeregulation and Competition, and (b)  Small and Medium Enterprise Development.\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n2.\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, economic growth in Indonesia was led by the oil and mineral\nindustry  sectors  that  thrived  in  the  inward-oriented  and  import  substitution  policy  regime.  Oil\nrevenues helped speed up industrialization through extensive public investment in upstream and\ncapital  intensive  industries.  Following  the  collapse  of  oil  prices  in  the  world  market,  Indonesia\nfaced  balance  of  payment  difficulties  that  underscored  the  urgency  to  reorient  its  industrial\nstrategy  to  achieve  greater  diversification  toward  the  non-oil  sector.  Starting  in  the  mid-1980s,\nIndonesia repositioned itself to adopt an export-oriented industrial strategy with emphasis on non-\noil industries and private sector participation. The main elements of the industrial reform packages\nadopted  from  the  mid-1980s  to  1993  were  a  greater  openness  to  private  sector  and  foreign\ninvestment  (although  entry  prohibitions  remained  in  selective  areas),  and  across-the-board\nreductions  in  nominal  tariffs.  These  reforms  were  complemented  by  a  limited  reorganization  of\ncustoms, ports, and shipping operations. These liberalization efforts spurred more than a decade\nof rapid economic growth based on high rates of industrial growth, much of it in export-oriented\nindustries.  Economic  growth  contributed  to  a  significant  decline  in  poverty  between  1976  and\n1996.\n\n3.\nDespite  considerable  structural  transformation,  significant  industrial  policy  distortions\nremained or emerged. These included (i)  wide prevalence of government-sanctioned monopolies\n(such  as  Agency  for  National  Logistics  [BULOG])  and  cartel  arrangements,  entry  restrictions  on\n\u201csensitive\u201d  or  \u201cstrategic\u201d  subsectors  (plywood,  cement,  fertilizer,  sugar  processing,  aircraft\nmanufacturing, steel); (ii) protection, on an ad hoc basis, for selected sectors and products; and\n(iii) distribution controls.\n\nThese  distortions  diverted  significant  resources  to  industries  that  were  not  competitive;\n4.\nencouraged  rent  seeking;  promoted  concentration  in  industrial  structure;  and  raised  business\ncosts, official and unofficial, associated with the complex regulations, approvals, and licenses still\nrequired by many types of commercial activity. The impediments to resource allocation resulted in\nslower  growth  rates  by  the  mid-1990s,  and  reduced  competitiveness  relative  to  other  high-\nperforming  economies  in  Asia.  These  developments  took  place  when  Indonesia  was  becoming\nmore  integrated  into  the  international  economy  and  facing  increased  competition;  together  they\ncontributed to increasing the country\u2019s vulnerability to external shocks.\n\n5.\nThe  economic  crisis  has  revealed  the  underlying  weaknesses  of  the  industry  sector\nthrough  the  unprecedented  contraction  in  manufacturing,  which  had  been  the  engine  of  growth.\nThe magnitude of the impact of the crisis on the sector resulted from three major factors:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii)\n\nthe Indonesian rupiah depreciated to record lows; firms that had high exposure to\nshort-term  foreign  debt  faced  insolvency  given  their  inability  to  service  debt  and\nraise fresh liquidity to resume operations;\nlegal  and  other  constraints  impeded  the  restructuring  of  the  corporate  sector  and\nthe ability of firms to settle debt obligations and resume production activity; and\nthe  remaining  distortions  in  industrial  and  trade  policies  reduced  competitiveness\nand    prevented  the  rapid  reallocation  of  resources  required  to  recover  from  the\ncrisis.\n\n\f2\n\nIndonesia  responded  to  the  economic  crisis  by  adopting  a  macroeconomic  stabilization\n6.\nprogram  and  wide-ranging  structural  reforms  supported  by  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),\nWorld  Bank,  and  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  A  major  component  of  the  reforms  is  bank\nrestructuring and recapitalization assisted by ADB,1 as well as corporate restructuring. The initial\nround  of  industry  sector  reforms  addressed  longstanding  anticompetitive  policy  distortions\nincluding  elimination  of  (i)  fiscal  subsidies  for  the  aircraft  industry;  (ii)  tax  exemptions  for  the\nNational Car Program; (iii) restraints to interprovincial trade, and (iv) entry restraints, local content\nrequirements,  or  administered  prices  in  several  subsectors  including  the  sawmilling  and  the\nlogging  industry.  With  a  view  to  ensuring  a  consistent  and  systematic  approach  to  industrial\npolicy, and supporting the overall restructuring efforts, the Government, with ADB assistance, has\nformulated  a  comprehensive  industrial  deregulation  and  liberalization  program  to  dismantle\nremaining distortionary policies.\n\nADB  provided  TA  for  the  formulation  of  a  consistent  industry  and  trade  sector  strategy.2\n7.\nThe  TA  examined,  in  depth,  the  industrial  structure,  policy,  regulatory,  and  institutional  issues.\nWithin  this  context,  a  review  was  conducted  of  the  commercial  legal  environment,  tariffs  and\nnontariff  barriers,  domestic  trade  and  distribution  constraints,  investment  laws  and  regulations,\ncustoms  administration  and  trade  facilitation,  and  export  incentives  and  promotion.  The  TA  also\nanalyzed distortions and constraints to private enterprises including small and medium enterprises\n(SMEs). Based on this economic and sector work, since 1997 ADB has pursued an active policy\ndialogue with the Government and other funding agencies to promote a competitive, transparent\nand predictable policy environment that provides a level playing field for all enterprises.\n\n8.\nIn  1998  ADB  fielded  reconnaissance  missions  in  April  and  July,  and  the  Fact-Finding\nMission in September to reach an understanding with the Government on the objectives, scope,\nand  pace  of  the  industrial  and  trade  policy  reforms  under  the  Program.  The  Appraisal  Mission3\nwas fielded in March 1999 to firm up understandings reached on the policy actions as enunciated\nin  the  Development  Policy  Letter  and  attached  Policy  Matrix  (Appendix  1).  It  was  followed  by\npolicy  consultation  missions  in  May  and  July  1999.  With  the  resumption  of  the  policy  dialogue\nfollowing the election of a new government, a Technical and a Policy Consultation Mission were\nfielded in November and December 1999 to reach final understandings. The program framework\nand its monitoring arrangements are given in Appendix 2.\n\nIII.\n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT\n\nA. \n\nGovernment Strategy and Policies\n\n9.\nThe  democratic  political  transition  in  Indonesia  has  given  it  a  historic  opportunity  to\nreinforce  and  consolidate  its  reform  efforts,  accelerate  economic  recovery  and  improve  the  well\nbeing of its people. While focusing on economic recovery and job creation as key tasks, the new\ngovernment  has  reconfirmed  its  commitment  against  corruption,  collusion  and  nepotism.  These\nobjectives will need to be achieved under tighter budgetary constraints due to the ongoing cost of\nthe financial crisis. Driven by political and economic imperatives, there is thus a need for a policy\nagenda that is cost efficient and effective.\n\n10.\nThe tremendous political changes in Indonesia have been caused by, and have increased,\nthe  growing  power  of  civil  society.  This  has  manifested  itself  in  the  form  of  newly  empowered\nlobby  groups  and  organizations,  and  generally  greater  freedom  of  expression.  The  immediate\n\n                  \n\non 25 June 1998.\n\n1 Loans 1618/1619/1620-INO: Financial Governance Reforms: Sector Development Program, for $1,497 million, approved\n\n2 TA  2705-INO:  Trade and Industry Planning and Strategy Formulation for Repelita VII,  for  $860,000,  approved  on\n\n12 December 1996. A supplementary increase of $140,000 was approved on 22 December 1998.\n\n3 The Mission consisted of J. Ahmed, Senior Economist, Mission Leader; X. Yao, Senior Programs Officer; Y. Qian, Project\n\nEconomist; Y. Elhan, Economist; and P. Van Diermen, consultant.\n\n\f3\n\nresult has been a demand by the people for a much more accountable and effective government.\nResponding to these demands, Indonesia\u2019s democratically elected Parliament has adopted State\nPolicy Guidelines that define an agenda for reviving the economy and laying the foundation for a\nsustained  recovery  that  will  reduce  poverty  and  provide  opportunity  to  all.  Based  on  these\nguidelines, the  Government has  adopted a comprehensive economic reform program supported\nby IMF, World Bank, and ADB that will accelerate the restructuring of the Indonesian economy.\n\n11.\nThe  Government\u2019s  economic  stabilization  program  is  complemented  by  wide-ranging\nstructural reforms to (i) adopt an expansionary fiscal policy, (ii) improve monetary management to\nbe steered by an independent Bank Indonesia (BI), (iii) increase the efficiency and transparency\nof  public  sector  activities,  (iv) restructure  banks  and  corporates,  (v) preserve  productive  assets\nand ease pressure on the exchange rate, (vi) improve governance at public sector and corporate\nlevels, and (vii) strengthen social protection and shield the poor and other vulnerable groups.\n\n12.\nKey emphasis has been placed on implementing banking reforms. At the same time, debt\nrestructuring  of  large  firms  is  underway  to  support  bank  restructuring.  The  Indonesia  Bank\nRestructuring  Agency  (IBRA)  was  set  up  and  entrusted  with  legal  powers  to  deal  with  the  debt\nresolution. The portfolio of nonperforming banks was transferred to IBRA, which closed a number\nof  banks. Of the 160  private banks in 1997, 66 were closed, 12 taken over by the Government,\nand  8  jointly  recapitalized  with  their  owners.  The  Government  has  issued  bonds  to  recapitalize\nbanks  that  have  potential  to  survive.  The  total  cost  of  recapitalization  is  expected  to  be  about\n$89 billion, or 60 percent of GDP. Of the state banks, four were merged into an entity called Bank\nMandiri, which is undergoing restructuring. Robust measures were taken following the discovery\nof  the  Bank  Bali  scandal.  To  restore  market  confidence  the  Bank  Bali  investigation  is  being\nadvanced,  and  systems  and  procedures  to  prevent  recurrence  are  being  strengthened;  the\nattorney  general  has  made  one  indictment  and  additional  actions  are  forthcoming  as  the\ninvestigation proceeds.\n\nThe  Frankfurt  Agreement  of  June  1998  paved  the  way  for  establishing  the  Indonesian\n13.\nDebt Restructuring Agency, which provides foreign exchange cover for interest and amortization\npayments  on  restructured  debt.  While  IBRA  has  taken  charge  of  nonperforming  loans  and  is\norganizing debt workouts, the Jakarta Initiative was launched for voluntary bilateral negotiations to\nfacilitate  settlement  of  corporate  debt  outside  the  judicial  system.  Although  the  institutional\nframework  was  well  conceived,  implementation  fell  short  of  expectations.  This  was  partly  the\nresult of administrative bottlenecks, and the absence of explicit incentives to encourage creditors\nand  debtors  to  negotiate  restructuring  deals  speedily  and  to  accept  the  losses  implicit  in\nrestructuring.  In  view  of  the  limited  progress  achieved  by  mid-1999,4  fresh  momentum  has  now\nbeen  given  to  corporate  restructuring  by  empowering  IBRA  to  take  over  assets  of  recalcitrant\ndebtors and by establishing a procedure by which the Government can direct cases to the Jakarta\nInitiative Task Force. The Government is also considering other measures including referral to the\nattorney general for the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings against firms that refuse to negotiate\nin good faith under the mediation procedures of the Jakarta Initiative. ADB support for the Jakarta\nInitiative includes the provision of $1 million to finance expert services to facilitate restructuring of\nSMEs.5  Restructuring  and  privatization  of  State-owned  enterprises  is  an  integral  part  of  these\ncorporate sector reforms.\n\n14.\n  These  efforts  are  being  supplemented  by  improvements  to  the  governance  of  key\neconomic institutions essential to achieve and maintain the soundness of the financial sector and\nsupport  restructuring  efforts.  A  new  Central  Bank  Law  has  been  enacted  establishing  BI  as  an\n\n                  \n\n4  280 Indonesian companies with a total outstanding debt of $23.2 billion (external) and Rp14.6 trillion (domestic) entered\ninto debt negotiations under this framework, only 24 cases covering a total amount of $3.04 billion and Rp2.2 million were\nsuccessfully negotiated.\n\n5 Under TA Loan 1620-INO: Capacity Building for Financial Governance, for $50 million, approved on 25 June 1998 as part\n\nof Financial Governance Reforms: Sector Development Program  (see footnote 1).\n\n\f4\n\nindependent  central  bank.  BI  has  been  audited  and  the  results  submitted  to  Parliament  in\nDecember 1999.  BI has now adopted a time-bound plan to address the issues raised by the audit\nand  has  approved  a  strategy  for  strengthening  bank  supervision.  A  master  plan  is  also  being\ndeveloped for the oversight of the nonbank financial sector by the Ministry of Finance.\n\n15.\nTo complement the corporate restructuring process, the Government initiated a review of\nindustrial  and  trade  policies  to  identify  obstacles  and  distortions  and  improve  the  incentive\nframework,  promote  competition,  and  enhance  the  transparency  and  predictability  of  policy\nmaking.  Steps  have  been  taken  to  reform  trade  policies,  open  up  sectors  to  competition  and\nforeign  investment,  dismantle  monopolies,  and  establish  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for\ncompetition. A strategic concern is to revitalize SMEs, whose development has been constrained\nin the past due to various policy and regulatory biases. This concern is underscored by the SME\nsector\u2019s high potential for labor absorption and income generation which will be key mechanisms\nfor restoring growth and reducing poverty. The trade and industry reforms aimed at strengthening\ncompetition  and  market  orientation  will  pave  the  way  for  further  corporate  restructuring  and\nimprove the efficiency of the Indonesian economy in the coming years.\n\nB.\n\nRecent Performance and Prospects\n\n16.\nAs  a  result  of  the  Government\u2019s  considerable  flexibility  and  prudence  in  economic\nmanagement,  Indonesia  is  emerging  from  the  worst  of  what  has  been  an  unprecedented\neconomic crisis. This is reflected in an across-the-board recovery which according to preliminary\nestimates has resulted in a growth rate of gross domestic product (GDP) of about 0.3 percent in\n1999.  This  contrasts  with  the  contraction  of  real  GDP  of  13.2  percent  in  1998.6  Prudent\nmacroeconomic  management,  tight  domestic  liquidity  conditions,  and  gradual  restoration  of\nconfidence in the rupiah has stabilized the exchange rate, which is presently at about Rp7,500 to\nthe  dollar.    A  major  accomplishment  was  the  reining  in  of  inflation,  with  the  annual  rate  in  1999\nprojected at 2 percent. This is much lower than the forecast 25 percent earlier in the year. This\ndeceleration is significant, as inflation peaked at around 78 percent in June 1998. Tight monetary\npolicy  and  the  agriculture  sector\u2019s  recovery  following  the  El  Ni\u00f1o  episode  of  1997-1998,  helped\nreduce inflation. As inflationary expectations subsided, the benchmark interest rate on one-month\nTreasury bills has steadily declined, from a peak of 70 percent in August 1998 to about 13 percent\nat present. A commensurate decline in bank deposit rates (with virtually unchanged lending rates)\nhas eliminated negative intermediation spreads for most banks.\n\n17. While  rising  oil  prices  boosted  non-oil  export  revenues,  overall  export  revenues  declined\nby about 7 percent in 1999. However, the weak overall export revenue performance masks more\nrobust export volume growth but this was mitigated by lower international prices for both natural\nresource and manufactured exports. Manufactured exports are constrained by lack of access to\nbank  finance  which  will  require  speedier  bank  restructuring.  Import  compression  declined  with\nimports falling about 11 percent in 1999, in contrast to a fall of 30 percent in 1998. Capital goods\nimports lagged in 1999, reflecting the fall in investment demand. However, intermediate imports,\ncrucial for sustaining recovery of exports and growth, stabilized in mid-year and grew by 5 percent\nin  1999.  To  strengthen  export  performance,  the  Government  is  pursuing  trade  liberalization  and\nhas set up the Bank Export Indonesia as a one-stop shop to handle trade financing.\n\n18.\nInvestment  activity  continues  to  be  depressed.  As  output  and  incomes  remain  low,  to\noffset the low level of private investment and stimulate aggregate demand, the Government has\npursued an expansionary fiscal policy. The budget deficit for FY 1999/2000 is projected to rise to\n4.3 percent  of  GDP  to  support  an  expansion  in  public  expenditures.  The  growing  costs  of\n\n                  \n\n6 For  the  first  time  in  30  years  non-oil  manufacturing  experienced  negative  growth,  declining  by  12  percent  during  1998.\nWhile  non-oil  manufacturing  grew  only  1.9  percent  in  1999,  there  was  a  strong  and  encouraging  recovery  in  the  final\nquarter of the year.\n\n\f5\n\nrecapitalization  of  banks  and  provision  of  social  safety  nets  to  vulnerable  groups  are  significant\ncontributors to this deficit.\n\n19.\nAmong  the  various  social  safety  net  programs  for  poor  and  vulnerable  groups  was  the\nprovision  of  subsidized  supply  of  rice  to  the  poor  that  reached  10 million  families  by  the  end  of\nOctober 1998.  A further Rp2.7 trillion has been allocated in the budget for FY 1999/2000 for this\nprogram.  In  addition,  significant  allocations  have  been  made  for  poverty  alleviation,  health,\nspecific  employment  programs,  including  to  enhance  women\u2019s  employment,  and  to  local\ngovernments  to  launch  regional  development  programs.  These  programs  have  enhanced\nmonitoring  provisions  and  other  safeguards  to  prevent  abuse  and  protect  implementation,\nincluding  frequent  reporting  on  key  performance  indicators,  independent  verification,  and  close\ninvolvement  by  civil  society.  ADB  has  provided  extensive  assistance  to  help  mitigate  the  social\nimpact of the crisis (see paras. 69 and 70).\n\n20.\nOverall,  recent  developments  provide  grounds  for  renewed  optimism.  Prospects  for\nmacroeconomic  stability  are  encouraging  given  the  reduction  of  inflation  and  the  stabilization  of\nthe rupiah. Financial and real sectors have benefited from the fall in interest rates to below pre-\ncrisis  levels,  as  indicated  by  the  evident  resumption  of  GDP  growth.  Based  on  these\ndevelopments, for 2000, GDP growth is expected to accelerate to about 3 to 4 percent. However,\nthe  economic  recovery  is  fragile  and  macroeconomic  stability  is  vulnerable  to  swings  in  market\nsentiment.  The  recent  buildup  in  foreign  exchange  reserves  resulting  from  rising  oil  revenues\nprovides  an  important,  if  limited,  cushion  to  absorb  such  swings.  This  will  need  to  be\nsupplemented,  and  the  recent  economic  gains  consolidated,  through  continued  stress  on\nacceleration of structural adjustment reforms.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE SECTOR\n\nA. \n\nBackground and Recent Performance\n\n1.\n\nIndustrial Growth and Structural Transformation\n\n21.\nIndonesia\u2019s  industrial  strategy  has  undergone  significant  changes  over  the  years.\nEmphasis on import substitution up to 1983 and large-scale public sector involvement in industry\nled  to  the  development  of  costly  capital-intensive  industries.  Between  1976  and  1983,\nmanufacturing value added grew at an average of 10 percent per annum, largely because of high\ncapital intensity rather than efficiency in its use.7\n\n22.   Subsequently,  the  export-oriented  industrial  strategy  pursued  from  the  mid-1980s  to  the\nmid-1990s focused on significant reductions in international trade barriers, and encouraged more\nfriendly  policies  toward  foreign  direct  investment  (FDI).  Fostering  greater  efficiency  in  markets,\nthese  policies  led  to  growth  of  export-oriented  industries  (including  garments,  textiles,  and\nfootwear), food processing, and construction. Following the shift in industrial strategy from import\nsubstitution  to  export  orientation,  manufacturing  value  added  growth  rose  to  16  percent  per\nannum  between  1984  and  1993.  The  total  factor  productivity  contribution  to  growth  rose  to\n33 percent,  with  the  rest  of  the  growth  attributable  to  increments  in  capital  and  labor.  Despite\nthese  improvements,  the  level  of  productivity  and  efficiency  of  Indonesian  industry  compares\nunfavorably with other high-performance Asian economies where total factor productivity growth\naccounts  for  about  50  percent  of  increases  in  manufacturing  productivity.  Given  resource\nconstraints,  large  increments  in  labor  and  capital  inputs  are  no  longer  sustainable.  Productivity\n\n                  \n\n7  Productivity increases are the result of increased use of factor inputs such as labor and capital, and improved total factor\nproductivity  (TFP)  from  more  efficient  use  of  these  inputs  through  their  reallocation  to  more  productive  sectors.  The\ncontribution of TFP to the growth rate during 1976-83 was barely 8 percent, while increments in capital stock contributed\n73 percent. Despite the growth in inputs, inappropriate policies for resource allocation offset the contributions of input to\noutput growth.\n\n\f6\n\ngains will have  to come  from resource shifts into more productive activities induced by a higher\ndegree of domestic and international competition.\n\n23.\nOver  the  same  period,  key  structural  changes  occurred  in  the  economy:  (i)  the  non-oil\nindustry\u2019s  value  added  share  in  GDP  increased  from  16  percent  to  23  percent,  (ii)  agriculture\u2019s\nshare declined from 22 percent to 19 percent, and (iii) the service sector\u2019s fell from 12 percent to\n7 percent.  Within  the  manufacturing  sector,  the  share  of  the  oil  and  gas  sector  declined  from\n17 percent to 11 percent. With a decline in oil refining, the share of non-oil/gas in manufacturing\nvalue  added  increased  from  83  percent to  89 percent.  The  rapid  economic  growth  benefited\nIndonesian workers whose wage employment and average real wages grew at an average rate of\n6 percent  and  10  percent  per  annum,  respectively.  Growth  and  industrial  transformation  also\nbenefited  SMEs  whose  employment  and  income  generation  capacity  and  contribution  to\nproduction of low cost goods and services are significant in the Indonesian economy. The policy\nbias  towards  large  scale  industry  persisted,  however,  and  was  reflected  in  an  industrial\nconcentration level higher than most regional competitors.\n\nSubsequently,  economic  performance  began  to  slow  down  by  the  mid-1990s;  this  was\n 24.\nreflected  in  a  decline  in  manufacturing  employment  growth  and  the  GDP  growth  rate.  Factors\nbehind  this  slowdown  were  the  rapid  real  effective  appreciation  of  the  rupiah,  a  continuing\nantiexport bias in the trade policy regime, and the prevalence of numerous restraints to domestic\ntrade  and  competition.  With  the  crisis,  economic  progress  ceased  altogether  with  output  and\nemployment  declining  across  all  industry  subsectors.  The  capacity  utilization  rates  in  the\nchemical,  electronics,  textile,  garment,  and  food  processing  subsectors  fell  from  an  average  of\nabout  80  percent  in  1996  to  about  50 percent  in  the  last  quarter  of  1998.  The  severity  of  the\nimpact of the crisis varied depending on firm size, market, and location. Foreign-owned and large\nfirms,  firms  operating  in  the  outer  islands  and  medium-scale  exporters,  as  well  as  producers  of\nresource-based  products,  report  smaller  declines  in  capacity  utilization  relative  to  smaller  and\nnonexporting  firms.8  While  access  to  credit  was  an  issue  for  many  firms,  some  exporting  firms\nhave  been  able  to  obtain  financing  from  their  foreign  affiliates  and  from  their  suppliers.    For  all\nfirms, the major cause of disruption was the decline in aggregate demand.\n\n2.\n\nSize distribution of firms9 and Interfirm Linkages\n\n25.\nIndonesia\u2019s corporate sector is characterized by a small number of relatively large export-\noriented  firms  and  large  domestic-oriented  firms.  In  1996,  the  formal  industry  sector  included\nabout 7,000 large firms, 6,000 medium firms, and 229,000 small firms. The large firms contributed\n85 percent of manufacturing value added, and small, medium and cottage enterprises\u20135 percent\neach. Relative to regional economies, Indonesia has not as yet fully exploited the potential of the\nSME  sector,  although  small  enterprises  have  performed  relatively  well  in  terms  of  creating\nemployment. The contribution to value added of medium enterprises, however, declined to a low\nof 5 percent in 1996 from a high of 14 percent in 1975.\n\n26.\nBetween 1975 and 1996 the share of large firms in manufacturing employment increased\nfrom  13  percent  to  35  percent;  the  share  of  small  enterprises  increased  from  7  percent  to\n19 percent; and the share of cottage enterprises declined from 75 percent to 40 percent. What is\nunusual by international experience is the initial increase of the share of medium enterprises from\n5 percent in 1975 to 9 percent in 1986, followed by a decline to 6 percent in 1996.\n\n                  \n\n8 See Widianto, B. and Choesni, A.  1999. Asian Corporate Recovery. BAPPENAS, Jakarta.\n9 Internationally, there is no clear definition of what constitutes large, medium, or small enterprises. Indonesia has recently\nadopted  a  definition  that  is  based  on  size  of  assets.  For  analytical  purposes,  and  for  ease  of  data,  this  report  uses  the\nclassification  by  the  Central  Bureau  of  Statistics  of  firms  by  number  of  employees.  Cottage  establishments  employ  1-\n4 persons, small establishments 5-19 persons, medium 20-99 persons, and large 100 persons or more.\n\n\f7\n\nThe relative underdevelopment of SMEs in Indonesia reflects structural characteristics of\n27.\nan economy at an early stage of economic development. In addition, however, the performance of\nlarge,  medium  and  small  firms  has  varied  because  of  differences  in  credit  access,  potential  to\nmitigate  market  conditions,  and  the  impact  of  a  complex  and  highly  regulated  business\nenvironment. Small family-oriented enterprises tend to fall outside the regulatory framework and\nescape most of the regulatory costs. In contrast, formal SMEs generally pay a large proportion of\ntheir  income  to  meet  regulatory  costs  both  legal  and  illegal.  Medium  enterprises,  using  more\nmodern equipment and management systems, and yet too small to capture government benefits,\nare most affected by the regulatory framework.\n\n28.\nDespite low SME contribution to manufacturing value added, the sector provides a training\nground  for  entrepreneurs.  Thus,  about  one  fourth  of  the  value  added  from  large  enterprises  in\n1990 originated from firms that started as SMEs. The growth of SMEs and their graduation to a\nlarger  size  is  thus  a  vital  factor  in  industrial  structural  change  leading  to  greater  employment\nopportunities,  increased  competition,  and  a  more  even  distribution  of  market  power.  Ensuring  a\npolicy environment that continues to support the SME sector is essential to promote the structural\ntransformation of the industry sector.\n\n29.\nRelative  to  international  experience,  SMEs  in  Indonesia  are  underrepresented  as\nsubcontractors in the manufacture, service, and subassembly of components because the policy\nenvironment  tended  to  encourage  large-scale  vertically  integrated  operations.  These  policy\ndistortions  need  to  be  addressed  to  promote  more  efficient  resource  allocation  based  upon\ngreater SME participation. By developing interfirm linkages SMEs can provide assured and cost\neffective  supply  of  manufactured  components  and  other  inputs  to  the  industrial  sector.  Such\nsubcontracting is flourishing in textiles and garments. Besides these vertical linkages, horizontal\ninterfirm  linkages  are  emerging  as  SMEs  are  finding  it  advantageous  to  locate  in  geographic\nclusters.  These  clusters  are  largely  made  up  of  small  SMEs.  While  they  make  a  substantial\ncontribution  to  employment,  their  contribution  to  value  added  is  significantly  smaller.  Dynamic\nSME clusters are usually based on linkups with larger firms that provide access to markets and\ntechnologies that contribute to upgrading SME capability.\n\n3.\n\nLabor Standards\n\n30.\nHistorically,  Indonesia\u2019s  labor  standards  have  been  supported  by  a  legal  framework\nadvocating a centralized enforcement system for mandatory standards, rather than allowing labor\nrepresentatives  to  self-regulate.  Prospects  for  collective  action  were  limited  because  of  the\nabsence of independent trade unions to provide the institutional support and information base for\nadequate labor representation and advocacy in disputes concerning labor standards. Without this\nright,  workers  were  prevented  from  effectively  participating  in  activities  to  monitor  and  regulate\ntheir  working  conditions.  Until  shortly  prior  to  the  crisis,  there  was  only  one  legally  recognized\nunion in the private sector, i.e., the Indonesia Workers Union.\n\n31.\nGreater  public  awareness  of  and  desire  to  seek  redress  for  work-related  grievances  has\nincreased  labor  actions  in  recent  years.  To  respond  to  this,  the  Ministry  of  Manpower  has\nattempted  to  play  a  more  active  role  in  enforcing  mandated  labor  standards.  Unlike  in  the  past\nwhen  labor  unrest  was  prompted  by  dismissals,  in  the  1990s,  labor  action  has  been  instigated\nmainly  by  deteriorating  wages  and  working  conditions.  Principal  issues  were  the  lack  of\nconfidence in the officially sanctioned union to negotiate better working conditions and wages, the\nweakness of dispute resolution mechanisms, and the limited independence of the bodies involved\nin the mediation process.\n\n32.\nPoor working conditions affect worker morale and increase costs. Recognizing that the key\nto ensuring humane and efficient working conditions and standards lies in allowing free collective\nbargaining, the Government has embarked on mandating improved standards and providing the\n\n\f8\n\nlegal  basis  for  a  greater  role  to  be  played  by  independent  unions.  In  1998,  Indonesia  signed  a\nletter of intent with the International Labor Organization (ILO) for the ratification of the seven core\nILO  conventions  covering  the  four  central  issues  of  (i) freedom  of  association,  (ii) forced  labor,\n(iii) nondiscrimination, and (iv) child labor.10 As of June 1999, Indonesia is the only country in Asia\nto  have  ratified  all  seven  core  conventions.  The Tripartite  Task  Force  consisting  of  unions,\nGovernment,  and  employers  was  established  and  is  working  with  ILO  to  implement  the  core\nstandards.  With  ILO\u2019s  assistance,  Indonesia  is  strengthening  labor  legislation  by  reviewing  the\nManpower  Act  and  preparing  laws  on  trade  unions  and  trade  union  disputes  settlement.  These\nwill aim to strike a balance between union monopoly and multiple unions and to include provision\nfor  promoting  the  principle  of  \u201cmost  representative  organization\u201d  under  which  a  union  with  a\nmajority  will  have  exclusive  rights  for  collective  bargaining.  As  a  result  of  these  efforts,  trade\nunions  now  number  18.  The  legal  and  regulatory  environment  as  well  as  actual  implementation\nnow compares favorably with other economies in the region. In June 1999, Indonesia was cited by\nILO in recognition of labor standards improvements.\n\nB. \n\nConstraints and Issues\n\n1.\n\nInadequate Commercial Law and Competition Framework\n\n33.\nThe efficiency of the corporate restructuring process and ensuing economic recovery are\nconstrained by weaknesses in the legal system. Chief among these are an inadequate bankruptcy\nlaw,  the  absence  of  a  law  on  acquisitions  and  mergers,  legal  uncertainty  over  land  titles  and\nmovable securities, and a deficient contract law. Problems of transparency and corruption in the\nlegal  system  are  other  key  impediments  to  the  growth  and  development  of  efficient  enterprises.\nThe  increased  sophistication  of  the  Indonesian  economy  and  the  closer  integration  with  world\nmarkets in the last decade have increased the urgency for implementing an effective commercial\nlegal system.\n\nIndustrial performance and restructuring has been further affected by inadequacies of the\n34.\nlegal and institutional framework to sustain and promote a truly competitive economy. Therefore,\nthe  enactment  of  a  competition  law  is  a  cornerstone  of  industrial  policy.  Experience  in  other\ncountries shows that it is essential to focus such a law on market conduct rather than on a firm\u2019s\nmarket  share.  This  implies  preventing  such  anticompetitive  practices  as  collusive  (or  horizontal)\nagreements  to  fix  prices  and  market  shares.  Such  practices  should  be  per  se  illegal.  It  is  also\nprudent to avoid legislating against certain non competitive practices that may increase consumer\nwelfare, such as joint ventures and various types of vertical restraints. These practices are better\naddressed  by  weighing  their  costs  and  benefits.  Provisions  related  to  this  category  of  conduct\nneed to be grounded in economic analysis to ensure that rigid prohibitions are not automatically\nimposed.  International  best  practice  suggests  that  exemptions  to  the  law  need  to  be  minimized\nand the law\u2019s coverage extended to State-owned-enterprises and other monopolies to ensure that\nliberalization measures are not impaired by their conduct. A dedicated enforcement agency in the\nform of a commission that is independent and has powers of investigation and legal sanction is\nrequired to effectively implement competition law.\n\n2.\n\nAnticompetitive Policies\n\n35.\nThe industry sector is characterized by a wide range of restraints to domestic competition.\nThese include the cumbersome licensing system, entry and exit controls, regulated partnerships\nbetween firms of different sizes, public ownership of specific industries, informal levies, marketing\nrestrictions,  price  controls,  and  special  assistance  (subsidies  and  tax  holidays)  to  specific  firms\n\n                  \n\n10 Child labor is infrequent in the industrial sector and  is a recognized problem in only a limited number of sub-sectors in the\neconomy (e.g., fisheries). Indonesia has adopted a minimum working age of 15 years, although as a developing economy\nit could have chosen a lower age in accordance with standards contained in the ILO core convention (convention C.138,\nadopted by the ILO in 1973). Further efforts are underway to identify and outlaw the most intolerable forms of child labor.\n\n\f9\n\nand industries. In addition to the entry barriers included in the Negative Investment List (para. 47),\nthere were restrictions to the participation of private firms in clove distribution, cement, paper and\nplywood, wholesaling and retailing, fertilizers, and oil products distribution. These restraints were\nlong-standing  impediments  to  competitive  markets  and,  except  for  those  on  oil  products,  have\nbeen removed under the Program.\n\n36.\nA typical example is the cement industry, in which regulatory arrangements were based on\na  series  of  decrees  governing  the  regional  distribution  of  cement,  both  domestically  and  for\nexports,  and  including  the  setting  of  ex-factory  and  retail  prices.  These  regulations  protected\ninefficient  firms,  deterred  entry,  led  to  underinvestment  in  cement  production  capacity,  and\ndistorted  regional  investment  decisions.  The  fertilizer  industry  operated  in  a  subsidized,  highly\nregulated, and administratively cumbersome environment with the objective of securing the supply\nof subsidized fertilizers to farmers. All five urea fertilizer producers in Indonesia are State owned.\nThe  Government  set  ex-factory  and  farm-gate  prices,  provided  direct  and  indirect  subsidies  to\nfertilizer producers, monopolized the distribution system, restricted imports, and set export quotas.\nThese pricing and marketing arrangements resulted in inefficient supply and consumption of urea\nfertilizer.\n\n37.\nSimilarly, the importation and distribution of several oil products is controlled by the State-\nowned oil and gas company (Pertamina) and two closely affiliated companies. Their monopolies\ninclude solid and liquid lubricants, crude lubricant oil, ethylene, and propylene. Pertamina assigns\ndomestic distributors for these products. Industrial companies are allowed to import some of these\nproducts for their own use (i.e., under importer-producer licenses). These import and distribution\nrestrictions increase the cost of basic industrial raw materials used by producers in downstream\nindustries like plastics, textiles, and footwear. Pertamina also has a retail monopoly for gasoline.\nInternational experience indicates that a monopolistic market structure reduces the incentives for\nefficiency  improvements  in  the  retail  sector.  Opening  up  the  distribution  and  retail  gasoline\nsubsector  to  competition  will  improve  efficiency  and  ensure  competitive  distribution  margins.  A\ndraft  law  is  to  be  submitted  to  Parliament  eliminating  Pertamina\u2019s  monopoly  for  transportation,\nstorage,  transmission,  and  marketing.  On  enactment  of  the  law,  private  companies  may\nparticipate  in  these  activities  after  obtaining  a  business  license.  Exploration  and  exploitation  will\nbe retained in the public sector, with private sector operations defined on the basis of contracts\nwith the Government.\n\n38.\nRestraints to competition in Indonesia have imposed costs through higher prices for basic\nraw materials as well as for final goods; reduced consumer and business choice; increased cross-\nsubsidies, which benefit inefficient firms at the cost of efficient firms; and reduced incentives for\ninnovation  and  efficiency.  While  under  some  circumstances  unrestricted  markets  may  fail,  thus\njustifying policy interventions in the public interest, the onus of proof that competition is causing\nmore  harm  than  good  should  be  on  the  proponents  of  restrictions.  In  this  context,  the  guiding\nprinciple  for  deregulation  should  be  that  legislation  should  not  restrict  competition.  Temporary\nrestrictions  are  justifiable  if  their  public  benefits  outweigh  the  costs.  To  strengthen  competition,\nexisting  laws  and  regulations  must  be  reviewed,  and  institutional  mechanisms  developed  to\nevaluate public or net benefit and review legislation that impedes competition.\n\n3.\n\nInternational Trade Protection\n\n39.\nIndonesia,  like  some  of  its  competitors  in  the  region,  significantly  liberalized  its  trade\nregime  prior  to  the  economic  crisis.  The  average  unweighted  tariff  of  14  percent  in  1997  was\nfurther reduced to 8.9 percent by September 1999. However, maximum tariffs are still high, with\nsome very high rates for automotive components and the alcohol industry.\n\nThere  are  five  major  categories  of  nontariff  barriers  to  international  trade.  The  first  is\n40.\nBULOG\u2019s  import  monopoly  over  wheat,  wheat  flour,  sugar,  garlic,  soybeans  and  rice.  These\n\n\f10\n\nitems,  previously  exempt,  are  now  subject  to  multilateral  negotiation.  In  1998,  the  Government\neliminated importation and distribution monopolies of all BULOG items. However, rice and sugar\nimports  were  placed  under  temporary  licensing  requirements  with  a  view  to  achieving  price\nstabilization  objectives  for  rice  and  orderly  restructuring  of  the  sugar  industry.  This  policy  was\nfurther  liberalized  in  December  1999  by  eliminating  restrictive  import  licensing  and  replacing  it\nwith temporary import tariffs on both commodities.\n\n41.\nThe second category includes the National Car Policy adopted in 1996 according special\ntax and import privileges to enhance the local content of motor vehicles. This policy allowed Timor\nPutra, the domestic producer of cars and its joint venture partner, KIA Motors of the Republic of\nKorea,  to  be  exempt  from  luxury  sales  tax  and  tariffs  subject  to  their  achieving  20 percent  local\ncontent by the end of the first year, 40 percent by the end of the second year, and 60 percent by\nthe end of the third year. However, any manufacturer of commercial vehicles, vans, or sedan cars\nthat could reach the level of 60 percent of local content would also be exempted from the luxury\nsales  tax  and  customs  duties.  The  Government  maintained  this  policy  until  the  onset  of  the\neconomic crisis.\n\n42.\n\nThe third category relates to local content requirements for dairy products.11\n\n43.\nThe fourth category includes restrictions on the import of new and used ships. Since mid-\n1996,  the  shipbuilding  industry  in  Indonesia  has  also  been  protected  through  a  local  content\nprogram,  although  notification  of  this  was  not  given  to  the  World  Trade  Organization.  An  earlier\nimport ban on ships (including fishing vessels), which reduced national efficiency and raised costs\nof inter-island shipping, was replaced in mid-1996 by an import licensing system, linked to a local\ncontent requirement. Buyers of vessels were obliged to purchase a certain number of locally built\nships for each imported vessel as part of the agreement for their receiving import licenses.\n\n44.\nThe fifth category includes import licenses that apply to some 190 items (at the nine-digit\nlevel  of  the  Harmonized  System  tariff  code).  Of these,  some  items  require  a  license  involving  a\nsimple registration system for interested importers. The remaining restrictive licenses are used for\nimport  control  with  the  following  categories:  (i)  dilarang  (or  controlled  imports);  (ii)  AT  (agen\ntunggal) or licenses for importation by sole agents; (iii) IT (importir terdaftar) or licenses granted\nfor  specific  imports,  where  an  importer  can  only  import  under  legal  or  government  decree;  and\n(iv) IP (importir produsen) or importer-producer licenses for the importation of inputs by firms for\ntheir own use in production. Within categories (i) and (ii) are many items for which licenses\u2014or\nsome  other  means  of  control\u2014are  justified  for  security,  social,  moral,  environmental,  or  safety\nreasons. These include explosives, insecticides, and herbicides. Outside of these items, the ITs\nand  IPs  are  the  principal  source  of  nontariff  barriers  for  a  small  number  of  food  and  beverage\nproducts (most of which were marketed through Government channels); motor vehicles; ships; oil;\nartificial  sweeteners;  hand  tools;  and  iron  and  steel.  In  many  cases,  these  licenses  remain  in\nplace  as  a  means  of  protecting  local  producers.  They  also  have  a  distinctly  anti-SME  bias\nbecause  they  prevent  importers  from  selling  such  goods  to  other  users.  As  a  result,  SMEs  that\nfind it too costly to import these types of goods in commercial quantities are effectively limited to\npurchasing their inputs from local producers.\n\n4.\n\nHigh Regulatory and Licensing Costs\n\n45.\nBesides ad hoc protection and restraints to competition to favor certain industrial groups,\nGovernment  policy  interventions  expanded  the  system  of  licenses,  approvals,  and  permits\nrequired for most commercial functions. To establish a trading business, for example, a firm may\nneed  as  many  as  46  licenses  at  various  levels.  Dealing  with  these  administrative  requirements\n\n                  \n\n11  Local  content  programs  in  the  Uruguay  Round  Agreement  are  identified  under  the  Agreement  on  Trade-Related\nInvestment  Measures  as  being  inconsistent  with  General  Agreement  on  Tariffs  and  Trade  Article  III  (national  treatment)\nand must be eliminated, once notified. The Government is committed to removing such programs.\n\n\f11\n\nimposes  high  financial  and  opportunity  costs  in  terms  of  the  limited  amount  of  time  available  to\nentrepreneurs.  Larger  firms  have  an  advantage  relative  to  smaller  ones  in  that  they  can  assign\nspecialist  staff  to  deal  with  the  regulatory  burden.  The  cost  of  obtaining  such  licenses  is\nconservatively estimated at 3 percent of the gross sales for large trading firms, and as much as\n5 percent for SMEs.12 Appendix 3 describes the complex process involved in obtaining a trading\nlicense.\n\n46.\nThis costly licensing system has several negative implications for the economy. First, it is\na  major  factor  that  contributes  towards  the  \u201chigh-cost\u201d  economy.  This  in  turn  reduces\ncompetitiveness  of  firms,  especially  SMEs.  Second,  the  cumbersome  regulatory  procedures\nimpede firms\u2019 ability to quickly switch productive capacity to alternative commercial activities (e.g.,\nexporting  their  products)  in  response  to  changing  market  conditions.  Third,  those  firms  which\ncannot  afford  the  high  cost  of  formalizing  their  business  activities  choose  to  remain  outside  the\nformal sector. These are again primarily SMEs.\n\n5.\n\nDistortions in Investment Policy and Trade Facilitation\n\na.\n\nInvestment Laws and Processes\n\n47.\nThe  collapse  of  investment  during  the  crisis  underscores  the  need  for  a  policy  response\nthat  provides  a  stable  and  predictable  policy  regime  that  reduces  uncertainty  and  promotes\ninvestor  confidence.  The  restrictive  legal  and  regulatory  regime,  entry  barriers  defined  by  the\nnegative  list  of  industries  and  the  lack  of  a  level  playing  field  and  transparency  in  investment\npolicy framework are major impediments to reviving investment growth. In 1998, the Government\nrevised  the  negative  investment  list  by  publishing  two  lists  (instead  of  one).  Presidential  Decree\nNo. 96/1998 specifies (i) 16 sectors closed to all types of investment, and (ii) 9 sectors closed to\nnew FDI, while Presidential Decree No. 99/1998 (i)  reserves 33 product groups for small firms,\nand  (ii)  opens  26 product  groups  to  medium-  and  large-scale  investors,  but  only  in  partnership\nwith small firms/cooperatives.\n\n48.\nBesides the need to remove investment restrictions, the legal framework needs to ensure\nconsistency with competitive trends and liberalization in other aspects of the Indonesian economy.\nIn particular, the discrepancy between the relatively restrictive basic laws and subsequent reform\ninitiatives  has  resulted  in  unnecessary  confusion  and  lack  of  transparency  regarding  the  policy\nframework  for  investment.13  The  existing  Foreign  Capital  Investment  Law  of  1967  and  the\nDomestic Capital Investment Law of 1968 need to be repealed and replaced with an investment\nlaw  that  establishes  a  transparent  framework  for  both  foreign  and  domestic  investors.  In\naccordance with best practice, the law should provide for more simplified and uniform treatment of\ninvestment  approvals,  whether  domestic  or  foreign;  improve  transparency;  and  reduce  the\nopportunities for corruption, collusion, and nepotism by reducing and rationalizing the provision of\nad hoc fiscal and other special incentives to investment. Effective implementation of the new legal\nand  regulatory  framework  will  require  a significant  reorientation  of  the  Investment  Board14  as  its\nmandate  shifts  from  regulating  and  controlling  FDI  to  promoting  and  facilitating  both  FDI  and\ndomestic  investment  under  the  new  framework.  In  addition,  the  Government  will  need  to\nstreamline departments that traditionally regulated investment and maintain various types of price,\nimport, and distribution controls.\n\n                  \n\nWorld Bank. 1996. Washington, D.C.\n\n12 The Domestic Distribution System for Manufactured Goods: Supplying Competitive Industrial Growth. Report No. 16173.\n\n13 For example, the base laws provide approval for FDI for 30 years and require divestment to reduce the share of foreign\nownership.  The  procedures  for  renewing  licenses  and  the  scope  of  the  investment  requirement  are  not  clearly  or\ntransparently specified.\n\n14  The  former  Investment  Coordinating  Board  [BKPM]  was  reconstituted  in  1999  as  the  Investment  Board  of  the  Board  of\n\nInvestment and State Owned Enterprises [BPM-PBUMN].\n\n\fb.\n\nDistribution Policy\n\n12\n\nFollowing  the  onset  of  the  economic  crisis,  new  implementing  regulations  for  FDI  which\n\n49.\nproved unusually restrictive, were introduced in April 1998:15\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nForeign retailers must be a large-scale retailer; this is defined as having capital of\nat least $100,000, excluding land and buildings. No minimum capital requirements\nare specified for wholesalers, although they must own a warehouse.\nForeign wholesalers and retailers are prohibited from operating in regions outside\nthe capital cities of DATI I and DATI II.16 This effectively prevents foreign firms from\noperating  in  many  major  urban  centers  outside  the  provincial  capitals.  One  such\nexample is Bogor, a large city with a per capita income comparable to Jakarta.\n\n(iii)  Wholesalers and/or retailers must be part of a joint venture with a local Indonesian\n\n(iv) \n\npartner who must have at least 49 percent of total equity.\nThe  local  joint  venture  partners  of  foreign  wholesalers  and  retailers  operating  in\nDATI II regions must be small-scale enterprises and/or cooperatives.\n\n50.\nThese regulations curb the advantages of foreign entrants in the distribution system such\nas greater competition and lower distribution costs, improvements in the delivery of goods to end\nusers,  and  technology  spillovers  to  local  retailers.  Under  these  regulations,  investors  are  also\nfaced with the problem of finding suitable small enterprise partners. 17\n\nc.\n\nTrade Facilitation: Operation of Customs and Ports\n\nPrior to April 1997, responsibility for customs tariff classification and valuation for imports\n51.\nover $5,000 was essentially handled by a preshipment inspection company, Societe Generale de\nSurveillance  (SGS).  Examinations  were  performed  by  SGS  in  the  country  of  export,  and  the\ninformation  was  transmitted  to  Indonesia  to  form  the  basis  of  payment.  Customs  procedures\nwithin Indonesia were restricted to the control of the remaining imports valued at less than $5,000.\n\n52. With  the  termination  of  SGS\u2019s  contract  in  April  1997,  the  Government  introduced  new\nprocedures  for  clearing  imported  goods.  Although  the  new  procedures  have  achieved  some\nsuccess,  their  implementation  has  been  jeopardized  by  several  factors,  including  (i)  lack  of\ncapacity  to  implement  and  manage  the  procedures,  (ii)  insufficient  training  of  customs  officers,\nand (iii) poor control of staff in the workplace.\n\nAlthough  the  transition  plan  included  the  necessary  features  of  modern  customs\n53.\nadministration, embodied in the new Customs Law that became effective on 1 April 1997, the new\nresponsibilities coupled with poor planning resulted in confusion and delays, and added a financial\nburden for importers who were not adequately notified of procedures. Importers faced delays and\ncosts not experienced under the previous preshipment inspection import regime. For example, a\nstatistical  analysis  of  information  on  container  dwell  times  at  Tanjuk  Priok  (a  major  port  for\ninternational  shipping)  shows  that  about  40  percent  of  containers  had  been  in  the  port  area  for\nover 12 days, about 20 percent for 7 to 12 days, and the remaining 40 percent for 1 to 6 days. By\ninternational standards, this is excessive dwell time.\n\n54.\nThese  factors  coupled  with  the  impact  of  corruption  on  international  trade  increase\nindustrial  costs.  Minor  adjustments  of  policies  and  procedures  within  Customs  and  the  port\nauthority  alone  will  not  achieve  significant  improvement,  given  the  weakness  of  these\n\n                  \n\n15 BKPM decrees 11/SK/1998 and 12/SK/1998.\n16 DATI I refers to provincial capitals, and DATI II to regions outside of provincial capitals.\n17 Partly in recognition of these problems, in 1994 the Government effectively removed the joint venture requirement for\n\nforeign investors in the trading sector.\n\n\f13\n\norganizations in staff management and enforcing governance. A systematic approach is required\nthat combines efficient information technology in both Customs and the port authority with basic\nprocedural changes to the processing of imports, including the setting of monitorable performance\nstandards.\n\n6.\n\nInefficient SME policies\n\na.\n\nPolicy Framework, Regulatory Costs, and Coordination\n\n55.\nSME development is a Government priority to promote private-sector-led growth, generate\nemployment  and  incomes,  and  alleviate  poverty.  Reflecting  the  view  that  SMEs  were\ndisadvantaged  by  unregulated  competition,  past  policies  emphasized  special  measures  to  put\nthem on a level playing field with larger companies. The Government provided SMEs with a range\nof  incentives  and  concessions  including  subsidized  or  free  access  to  business  services,\nsubsidized  credit,  and  mandated  targets  to  commercial  banks  to  lend  to  the  sector  (at  market\ninterest  rates).  Paradoxically,  this  policy  framework  led  to  additional  rules,  regulations,  licenses,\nand fees that have burdened SMEs.\n\n56.\nThe increased efforts to support SMEs have resulted in significant coordination problems.\nA  large  number  of  Government  departments  and  agencies  are  concerned  with  SMEs  but  few\nsystems are in place to coordinate efforts. There has been no systematic attempt to evaluate the\nvalue  and  impact  of  the  various  programs  provided,  as  a  result  of  which  duplication  and  waste\noccur quite regularly. A related difficulty has been the sporadic and limited nature of consultation\nbetween  policymakers,  SMEs,  and  the  organizations  representing  SMEs.  This  has  meant  that\npolicy  formulation  has  often  not  been  effectively  designed  to  respond  to  client  concerns.\nA renewed  effort \nfeedback  between\npolicymakers, SMEs, and nongovernment organizations, and to develop a systematic approach to\nevaluating the success of SME support programs is an important objective of the Government\u2019s\nreform agenda.\n\nto  establish  robust  channels \n\nfor  consultation  and \n\nb.\n\nThe Impact of the Crisis and Initial Mitigation Measures\n\nThe  dimensions  of  the  economic  crisis  were  revealed  by  a  Government  survey  in  mid-\n57.\n1998 indicating that of 175,903 SMEs surveyed across Indonesia, 75,453 (43 percent) had closed\ntheir  business,  44,305 (25 percent)  had  experienced  a  decline  in  activity,  and  31,127  (18  percent)\nhad  stopped  trading  but  had  not  yet  closed.  Of  the  nine  subsectors  covered  by  the  survey,\nhusbandry, mining, and manufacturing had fared the worst. Although subsequent surveys showed\nthat  many  SMEs  were  able  to  take  advantage  of  new  market  opportunities,18  the  extent  of  the\ninitial  impact  on  SMEs  led  the  Government  to  focus  on  subsidized  financing  to  help  SMEs\nweather the crisis. The principal SME credit programs have included:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nCredit  for  Small  Enterprises,  which  requires  that  commercial  banks  allocate  22 \u2013\n25 percent of their portfolio to small borrowers at market rates for working capital\nand investment purposes;\nthe  provision  of  subsidized  credit  to  farm  cooperatives  and  SMEs  through\n16 schemes funded or managed by BI; and\nVillages General Credit, a program intermediated by Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI)\nthat  serves  SMEs  and  microenterprises  throughout  the  country  at  near-market\nrates.\n\n                  \n\n18 The  picture  of  SMEs  in  the  wake  of  the  economic  crisis  has  not  altogether  been  gloomy  as  some  SMEs  have  actually\nthrived  in  these  difficult  times.  For  example,  the  export-oriented  furniture  industry  in  Jepara,  Central  Java,  which  largely\nconsists of SMEs that use locally sourced inputs and hence pay in rupiah but export their products and earn their revenue\nin foreign currency, has significantly increased.\n\n\f14\n\nOf these programs, the Credit for Small Enterprise scheme continues to be the largest with\n58.\nan outstanding portfolio of about Rp45 trillion, compared with Rp5 trillion for the Villages General\nCredit,  and  Rp22  trillion  for  all  liquidity  credit  schemes  funded  by  BI  (as  of  August  1999).\nNevertheless,  the  Credit  for  Small  Enterprises  scheme  shows  a  34 percent  reduction  in  the\noutstanding  portfolio  relative  to  about  Rp68 trillion  in  March  1998;  this  is  indicative  of  the  sharp\ndecline  in  new  lending  to  the  SME  sector.  The  Villages  General  Credit  scheme  continued  to\nfunction  during  the  crisis,  although  with  sharply  reduced  lending  levels.  The  bulk  of  the  recent\ncredit  expansion  has  been  to  support  food  crop  production  in  view  of  the  need  to  mitigate  the\ndepletion  of  farm  savings  following  two  years  of  drought  and  the  weakening  credit  provision  to\nagriculture  from  commercial  sources  affected  by  the  economic  crisis.  In  this  connection,  the\nGovernment  increased  the  provision  of  subsidized  credit  under  the  BI-financed  scheme,  Kredit\nUsaha Tani (KUT), to help farmers and agricultural production. Lending for KUT increased from\nRp400 billion in June 1998 to Rp4.2 trillion in March 1999 to about 8.5 trillion by December 1999,\nwhile  interest  rates  were  reduced  from  14  percent  to  10.5  percent.  In  addition,  the  Government\nguarantee for the scheme was increased from 65 percent to 100 percent, effectively ensuring that\nbanks carry no risks and just administer the scheme.\n\nc.\n\nShortcomings of  SME Credit Programs\n\n59.\nThe substantial ad hoc growth in the number of subsidized credit schemes and credit flows\nafter the economic crisis is a major departure from the previous policy that (i) emphasized delivery\nof  SME  credit  at  market-determined  interest  rates  and  (ii) advocated  a  reduction  in  BI\u2019s  liquidity\nsupport  for  SMEs,  restricting  this  for  credit  requirements  of  food  security  operations.  This  SME\ncredit program and its recent growth raises several concerns:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nBI\u2019s liquidity support for special schemes has adverse monetary policy implications\nand is inconsistent with its role as an independent central bank.\nThe  subsidies  associated  with  these  schemes  are  high  and  unsustainable  in  the\nlong-run,  for  example,  the  fiscal  costs  of  the  interest  subsidy  alone,  excluding\nprovisioning, were close to Rp4 trillion for fiscal year 1999.\nAccess to large volumes of subsidized credit poses the risk of reducing demand for\ncommercially available sources of finance.\nThe  subsidized  credit  often  is  delivered  without  adequate  risk  assessment  and\nsince  it  is  difficult  to  target  the  poor  it  often  results  in  large-scale  leakages  and\nnonrepayment.19\nMandatory  credit  programs  that  require  banks  to  lend  22  to  25  percent  of  loans\nrepresent a tax on banks and add additional costs as banks failing to meet these\ntarget  are  subject  to  penalties.  In  the  short  term,  there  is  a  strong  case  for\neliminating  noncompliance  penalties,  while  over  the  long  term,  mandatory  credit\nprograms should be eliminated as many banks lack the extensive regional branch\nnetworks  or  the  knowledge  and  organizational  structure  that  are  necessary  for\nlending to SMEs.\nSMEs are relatively underserved by alternative financial institutions. The exception\nis  a  state-owned  venture  capital  firm,  Bahana  Artha  Ventura,  but  its  capabilities\nvary  across  the  country  and  its  operations  are  not  transparent.  Basic  financial\nservices  such  as  leasing  or  factoring  are  not  readily  available  to  SMEs.  A  further\nset of constraints relates to the absence of effective institutions for the provision of\nmarketing and trading services.\n\n60. While  past  liabilities  of  SME  credit  programs  carry  a  high  fiscal  burden,  the  cost  of\nmaintaining  new  flows  of  subsidized  credit  has  declined  with  the  fall  in  overall  interest  rates  to\n\n                  \n\n19 Evidence confirms that the repayment of KUT-credit prior to the crisis has been poor. To allow defaulters to borrow under\nthe  KUT  scheme,  the  Government  wrote-off  their  accumulated  nonperforming  loans  for  1985-1995  period  and  then\nextended the repayment period for arrears.\n\n\f15\n\nsingle digit levels in 1999. However, these schemes (in particular, KUT the largest scheme) are\ncostly  to  administer.  With  the  strong  recovery  of  agriculture,  the  justification  for  maintaining  the\nsubsidized  credit  programs  for  this  sector  has  weakened.  Among  other  factors,  it  perpetuates\nleakages and corruption, and diverts credit from the industry sector\u2014credit flows to industry have\neffectively dried up.\n\nd.\n\nTechnical and Business Capacity Building\n\nThe  Government  has  set  up  technical  service  centers  and  small  industrial  estates  to\n61.\nprovide direct assistance to develop SME managerial and technological capabilities and improve\ntheir access to markets. These programs have had a mixed impact, being effective when services\nhave  been  directed  to  overcoming  specific  market  failures,  but  in  other  cases  the  resources\ninvested  in  the  services  were  dissipated  given  the  range  of  services  provided,  the  nationwide\naudience, and the limited funding. The combination of being free to the client and the enormous\nsize of the target has resulted in a pattern of one-shot services to small firms, with little possibility\nof providing follow-up. Most of the programs do not have a clear budget, and staff find it difficult to\nimplement  concrete  projects  even  when  they  are  able  to  identify  them.  Over  the  years,  most\ndepartments have been able to secure some foreign funding for specific programs that allowed for\nmore  than  one-shot  interventions  and  brief  training  courses.  Such  foreign  assistance-sponsored\ninterventions have been the exception and are expensive. The tendency to centralize has reduced\nflexibility,  an  essential  ingredient  in  technical  support  programs.  Where  such  support  has  been\nrelatively  successful,  it  has  been  based  on  the  engagement  of  private  sector  service  providers\nwho have been subject to monitoring and evaluation by the appropriate Government agencies.\n\nTechnical  support  programs  have  promoted  horizontal  linkages  between  SMEs  by\n62.\nsupporting joint action by clusters of small-scale entrepreneurs. These are designed to stimulate\nproduct and process innovations needed to help SMEs adjust to structural change. The programs\nconsist  of  courses  provided  by  extension  workers  and  the  introduction  of  new  equipment  to\ndemonstrate  the  advantages  of  technological  change  to  the  producers.  The  program  budget  is\nlimited, and like the other forms of assistance, it is nonrecurring. Extension officers generally have\nlittle technical or business experience, and training or other technical facilities have been largely\nprovided according to the direction of central planners, rather than having been adapted to local\nneeds. Vertical linkages between small and large firms have been promoted through mandatory\npartnership programs. These programs have also had limited success in fostering viable business\npartnerships  between  SMEs  and  large  firms.  There  is  a  need  for  an  alternative  approach  that\nconcentrates on the creation of an enabling environment to stimulate the private sector to develop\ncloser alliances. \n\n7.\n\nGovernance and Corruption\n\nIndustry sector and SME financing policies and the lack of competition and transparency in\n63.\nthese  policies  have  provided  the  public  and  private  sectors  with  opportunities  for  rent  seeking.\nThe principal policy instruments that have created such opportunities are quantitative restrictions,\nsubsidies,  tariffs,  and  price  controls.  While  tariffs  and  price  controls  have  been  substantially\nrationalized,  rent-seeking  opportunities  remain  due  to  nontariff  barriers  and  the  large-scale\nexpansion of subsidized KUT financing provided to farmers without due credit risk assessments.\nIn  addition,  low  wages  and  poor  incentive  mechanisms  in  the  civil  service  and  nontransparent\nadministrative  mechanisms  provide  additional  venues  for  corruption.  As  part  of  its  economic\nrecovery strategy, the Government has launched wide-ranging initiatives to combat corruption and\nimprove governance with the objective of promoting transparent rule-based behavior and credibly\nbind the Government to a well-defined set of procedures for the regulation of economic activities\nand resolution of disputes. These include (i) improved access to markets, (ii) legal and regulatory\nreforms, and (iii) strengthening of public administration. So far, the Government has\n\n\f16\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nreformed central bank and commercial bank laws, the competition law, bankruptcy\ncodes,  tax  laws,  laws  dealing  with  property  rights,  and  business  registration\nrequirements;\ncreated  institutions  that  effectively  implement  these  rules  such  as  improved\nindependent  central  bank,  a  competition\nrevenue  collection  agencies,  an \ncommission, and strengthened bankruptcy courts;\nissued  the  Anticorruption  Law  in  April  1999,  which  provides  disclosure  standards\nfor  public  employees  and  mandates  the  establishment  of  an  independent\nanticorruption body within two years; and\npassed  the  Antibribery  Law  in  July  1999  specifying  criminal  sanctions  for\ncorruption.\n\nADB is playing a major role through policy dialogue, TA, and policy loans, in helping the\n64.\nGovernment  develop  and  implement  its  governance  and  anticorruption  strategy.  ADB  has\nadopted an anticorruption action plan for Indonesia; it was discussed at a high-level meeting with\nthe Government, and in an open forum with Indonesian civil society groups and non-government\norganizations  in  July  1999.  TA  has  been  provided  for  supporting  the  establishment  of  an\nindependent  anticorruption  commission  as  well  as  improvements  in  public  sector  management\nand governance. 20\n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n65.\nThe  overall  framework  of  assistance  to  Indonesia  is  being  developed  under  the  IMF-led\naid support package of which structural reform is a key component. The World Bank approved the\nPolicy  Reform  Support  Loan  (PRSL)  of  $1  billion  in  July  1998  to  address  macroeconomic\nstabilization  and  structural  reform  concerns,  and  has  followed  up  with   PRSL II for  $500 million\napproved  in  May  1999.  The  primary  thrust  of  PRSL  II  is  on  efficient  corporate  restructuring\nthrough  fiscal,  monetary,  and  financial  sector  reforms;  and  improved  governance  and  public\nsector  management.  In  addition,  PRSL  II  is  supporting  reforms  in  trade,  forestry  and  agriculture\nsectors. As a part of its assistance package, ADB has provided $2.82 billion to support structural\nreforms  for  the  finance,  power,  agriculture,  and  social  sectors    (see  paras.  69  and  70).  These\nefforts  are  now  supplemented  with  the  Program.  In  developing  the  policy  framework  for  these\noperations,  ADB  has  coordinated  closely  with  IMF  and  World  Bank  to  ensure  complementarity.\nADB has also coordinated with the United States Agency for International Development, which is\nproviding TA for legal, trade, and governance reforms.\n\nSeveral aid agencies and organizations have provided support for policy-oriented studies,\n66.\nTA  and  financial  services  for  SMEs.  In  formulating  the  proposed  Program,  ADB  has  closely\ncoordinated  with  other  sources  of  assistance  to  ensure  that  the  various  activities  are  mutually\nsupporting and reinforcing. At the request of the Government, ADB has taken the lead role in aid\ncoordination  for  the  SME  sector.  ADB  has  consulted  all  major  funding  agencies,  the  Asia\nFoundation,  Gesellschaft  fur  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  (German  Development  Corporation),\nSwisscontact,  Canadian  International  Development  Agency,  Australian  Agency  for  International\nDevelopment, United States Agency for International Development, Japan Bank for International\nCooperation  (JBIC;  formerly  Overseas  Economic  Cooperation  Fund  and  Export-Import  Bank  of\nJapan) and the World Bank.21\n\n                  \n\n20 TA 3381\u2013INO: Establishment of an Anticorruption Commission, for $1 million, approved on 28 December 1999; TA 3214\u2013\nINO: Improving the Management of Government Onlending Operations, for $400,000, approved on 1 July 1999; and TA\n3233\u2013INO: Strategy for Restructuring Public Services, for $488,000, approved on 30 July 1999.\n\n21 The World Bank is examining the feasibility of providing a small learning and innovation loan to help develop possible\nproject support for SMEs. This project has been coordinated with ADB\u2019s operations and will contribute to developing\nmore efficient lending mechanisms and promoting venture capital.\n\n\f17\n\nADB chaired four major aid coordination meetings in Jakarta in July and September 1998,\n67.\nand  July  and  November  1999  to  examine  issues  relating  to  the  policy  environment,  financial\nservice provision, and technical and business capacity building for the SME sector. The findings\nand  recommendations  of  other  funding  agencies  are  incorporated  in  the  design  and  the  policy\nreform  agenda  of  the  proposed  Program.  Its  preparation  represents  a  collective  effort  of  the\nconcerned aid agencies as well as the Government.\n\nD.\n\nADB\u2019s Operations and Strategy\n\n1.\n\nCountry Strategy\n\n68.\nIn  response  to  the  deepening  financial  and  economic  crisis,  ADB  has  reviewed  its\noperational priorities in consultation with the Government and adopted an interim strategy to guide\nits operations during 1998-2000. Key components of the strategy include provision of support for\nreforms  of  the  financial  sector,  complemented  by  supporting  reforms  in  the  restructuring  and\ndevelopment of trade, industry, and energy sectors and State-owned enterprises. The successful\nimplementation  of  reforms  in  these  sectors  is  intended  to  help  restore  investors\u2019  confidence,\nimprove  transparency  and  predictability  of  policy  making,  thereby  sustaining  economic  recovery\nand a return to sustainable and efficient growth. The interim strategy further emphasizes support\nfor  implementation  of  the  decentralization  agenda  and  governance  reforms,  and  strengthened\nmeasures  for  poverty  reduction  and  social  protection.  ADB\u2019s  operational  program  supports  the\nIMF-led aid assistance package for Indonesia. In this context, ADB has been pursuing its interim\nstrategic  agenda  in  close  coordination  with  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies  that  have\nactive programs of operations in Indonesia.\n\n69.\nIn  June  1998,  ADB  approved  the  Financial  Governance  Reforms:  Sector  Development\nProgram  loan22  that  is  assisting  the  Government  to  undertake  wide-ranging  reforms  in  financial\ngovernance  by  restructuring  commercial  banks,  developing  domestic  capital  markets,  and\nproviding  institutional  strengthening  of  agencies  concerned  with  financial  governance.  This  was\nfollowed  in  July  1998,  by  the  Social  Protection  Sector  Development  Program  (SDP)  loan23  to\nmitigate  the  effects  of  the  economic  crisis  on  the  poor  and  to  strengthen  policy  and  institutional\nmeasures concerning the provision of basic social services including education, health, nutrition,\nand family planning.\n\n70.\nIn 1999, ADB approved three major policy-based lending initiatives including (i) Health and\nNutrition  SDP  loan,24  (ii)  Power  Sector  Restructuring  Program  loan,25  and  (iii)  Community  and\nLocal Government Support Sector Development loan.26 The Health and Nutrition SDP broadens\nthe policy agenda of the Social Protection SDP on effective public spending to target the provision\nof essential social services for the poor and vulnerable groups. The Power Sector Restructuring\nProgram  supports  the  Government\u2019s  reform  agenda  to  dismantle  the  vertical  monopoly  in  the\npower sector to increase private sector participation, and to move toward competitive markets for\ngeneration, transmission, and distribution. The Community and Local Government Support SDP\nsupports  the  implementation  of  administrative  and  fiscal  decentralization  agenda  and  the\ninvolvement of local communities and civil society in development planning and implementation.\n\n                  \n\non 25 June 1998.\n\n22 Loans 1618/1619/1620-INO: Financial Governance Reforms: Sector Development Program, for $1,497 million, approved\n\n23 Loan 1622-INO: Social Protection Development Program and Loan 1623-INO: Social Protection Development Project, for\n\n$100 million and $200 million approved on 9 July 1998.\n\n24 Loan 1675-INO: Health and Nutrition Program and Loan 1676-INO: Health and Nutrition Project, for $100 million and $200\n\nmillion approved on 25 March 1999.\n\n25 Loan 1673-INO: Power Sector Restructuring Program, for $ 380 million approved on 23 March 1999.\n26 Loan 1678-INO: Community and Local Government Support Sector Development Program, for $ 320 million approved on\n\n25 March 1999.\n\n\f18\n\nConsistent with the interim strategy, ADB places greater emphasis on managing the loan\n71.\nportfolio to Indonesia to ensure its continued relevance in the current situation. In 1998, ADB in\ncooperation  with  the  Government  undertook  a  major  review  of  its  portfolio  to  reassess  the\nrelevance  of  all  the  ongoing  projects  in  the  context  of  the  crisis,  including  their  contribution  to\naddressing immediate economic and social development concerns. The review resulted in scaling\ndown  a  number  of  projects  and  canceling  about  $1  billion  from  the  then  undisbursed  loan\nbalances. In 1999, ADB and the Government undertook another portfolio review that focused on\nrestructuring slow-moving and poorly performing projects. Together with the portfolio review, loan\nsavings amounting to $500 million were identified in 1999 for cancellation.\n\n2.\n\nSector Strategy\n\nfor \n\nthe \n\nADB\u2018s  strategy \n\nindustry  sector  aims \n\nincrease\n72.\ncompetitiveness, improve the business environment, and develop a modern financial system that\nprovides  the  range  of  instruments  and  volume  of  financing  required  to  sustain  industrial  growth.\nThis involves strengthening institutions needed for the restructuring of the corporate and financial\nsectors, as well as sector and economywide reforms that promote competition, governance, and\nbalanced growth in both the financial and industry sectors.\n\nthe  Government \n\nto  help \n\nBuilding  on  the  policy  framework  of  the  Financial  Governance  Reforms:  SDP,  ADB  is\n\n73.\nassisting the Government implement the following:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nstructural reforms to increase competition and efficiency, and improve governance\nand transparency in trade and industry;\ncorporate  restructuring  to  preserve  productive  assets  and  achieve  efficient  debt\nrecovery that promotes the health of the financial sector;\nshort-term  measures  including  adequate  working  capital  and  provision  of  trade\nfinance to sustain the corporate sector and restore growth and profitability; and\nfinancial sector reforms to restore credit flows, improve financial governance, and\nrebuild  the  financial  sector,  and  promote  the  development  of  nonbank  financial\ninstitutions, including the contractual savings industry.\n\nThe  Program,  together  with  a  program  for  corporate  governance  for  State-owned\n74.\nenterprises, which is being processed, will help the Government meet the immediate challenge of\nbuilding a more conducive business environment and promoting structural reforms that increase\ncompetitiveness and improve governance.\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\nV.\n\nTHE PROGRAM\n\n75.\nThe main challenge now facing policymakers is to devise and implement policies that will\nallow Indonesia to recover from the economic crisis and stimulate broad-based growth to mitigate\nthe hardships of those most adversely affected. Together with banking, the industry sector, which\nhas strongly contributed to the growth of the Indonesian economy in the past decades, has been\nthe hardest hit by the economic crisis. The depth of the crisis and the severity of the contraction of\nindustrial  output  have  been  exacerbated  by  the  legacy  of  distortionary  industrial  policies  that\nrestricted competition, favored large firms, promoted rent seeking, increased costs, impeded the\ngrowth of SMEs, and led to a highly concentrated industrial structure. These distortions limit the\nability  of  private  investors  to  respond  to  new  opportunities,  inhibit  economic  restructuring,  and\nincrease the vulnerability of the industry sector to the adverse effects of a weak banking system\nand external financial shocks.\n\n\f19\n\nMore  than  two  years  since  the  crisis  started,  there  is  a  pressing  need  for  decisive\n76.\nmeasures to build on the recent macroeconomic gains and rapidly restore confidence of investors,\nlenders, and producers. Restoring confidence and growth requires a fundamental transformation\nof the economy by removing the impediments to the development of a more competitive industry\nsector. These include: (i) high transaction costs resulting from excessive licensing and regulatory\nrequirements;  (ii) concentrated  industrial  structure  dominated  by  a  few  large  firms;  (iii) an\ninconsistent  and  inadequate  policy  framework  for  industrial  competition;  (iv)  inefficiencies  in\nmarkets and resource allocation caused by protection of existing firms from foreign and domestic\ncompetition;  (v) a discretionary  investment  policy  that  generates  uncertainty  and  discriminates\nbetween  domestic  and  foreign  investment,  and  (vi) inefficiencies  and  delays  in  customs\nprocedures.\n\n77. While  these  policies  have  impeded  the  economic  recovery,  their  adverse  effects  have\nbeen  more  pronounced  on  SMEs,  which  can  ill  afford  the  high  transactions  costs  resulting  from\nthe complex regulatory framework. Historically, Indonesia promoted SME development through a\nlarge  number  of  special  programs,  incentives,  and  concessions  to  encourage  their  growth,\nreflecting a view that the sector was weak and in need of protection. This approach to the support\nof  SMEs  is  no  longer  sustainable  given  the  ongoing  structural  adjustment  of  the  Indonesian\neconomy based on comparative and competitive advantage. With sharply constrained budgetary\nresources,  the  Government  is  no  longer  in  a  position  to  channel  resources  directly  to  and  for\nSMEs as in the past. The new economic environment requires a reorientation of policies to make\nSMEs  efficient  and  competitive.  Special  concessions  and  incentives  protecting  SMEs  from\ncompetitive  forces  will  render  them  inefficient  and  incapable  of  coping  with  the  new  market\nconditions. International experience suggests significant benefits from SME support policies that\nfocus  less  upon  the  notion  of  size  per  se,  and  more  on  creating  a  business  climate  that\nencourages the emergence of new and efficient firms.\n\n78.\nAddressing these issues will require a coordinated policy response to promote competition\nand  facilitate  structural  change  through  smoother  entry  and  exit  by  firms,  both  foreign  and\ndomestic,  large  or  small.  Without  further  deregulation  that  reduces  the  high  cost  of  doing\nbusiness,  measures  to  strengthen  domestic  competition  will  not  be  successful.  Only  such\nderegulation  will  ensure  that  markets  are  operated  efficiently  and  transparently,  so  that  when\nresources are committed to commercial activities, there are reasonable prospects that they will be\nemployed  productively.  It  is  also  necessary  to  improve  governance,  strengthen  the  commercial\nlegal  environment  for  competition,  increase  transparency  and  consistency  in  the  policy  making\nprocess, improve customs performance, and reduce corruption in the bureaucracy.\n\n79.\nGiven  their  high  potential  for  growth,  the  Government\u2019s  reform  strategy  includes  a\nrenewed policy focus on SME development. Many SMEs will grow significantly without exiting that\nsize category, while others will eventually become larger firms. This is in sharp contrast to micro\nor household enterprises, which rarely graduate from their size class. A coordinated approach to\npromoting  competition  and  leveling  the  playing  field  for  all  enterprises  will  promote  SMEs  with\ncorresponding  benefits  in  terms  of  broad-based  growth  of  employment  and  incomes.  With  the\nrevival  of  industrial  growth  and  the  industrialization  process,  the  distribution  of  manufacturing\nemployment is expected to shift out of household activities into wage employment. SMEs will play\nan important role in absorbing this labor shift.\n\n80.\nGreater  competition  that  promotes  growth,  a  dynamic  SME  sector,  and  the  resulting\nimpetus to structural change will lead to a transformation of the highly concentrated structure of\nindustry  in  Indonesia  with  concomitant  benefits  in  terms  of  greater  efficiency  in  resource\nallocation, reduced market power, and increased consumer welfare.\n\n\f20\n\nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n81.\nThe  overall  goal  of  the  Industrial  Competitiveness  and  SME  Development  Program  is\nhigher,  sustained  economic  growth  through  more  efficient  resource  allocation.  The  Program\u2019s\nobjective  is  to  achieve  economic  recovery  by  encouraging  a  more  diversified  and  efficient\nindustrial  structure  through  deregulation  and  adoption  of  policies  that  promote  competition  and\nprovide  a  level  playing  field  for  all  enterprises  including  SMEs.  These  policies  are  expected  to\ncontribute  to  restoring  investor  confidence  and  lead  to  renewed  growth.  Thus,  the  Program\nfocuses on the following areas (for details, see the Policy Matrix in Appendix 1):\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nstrengthening competition by (a) establishing an appropriate legal environment for\ncommercial activity; (b) simplifying the regulatory framework; (c) removing  barriers\nto domestic competition and trade; and (d) liberalizing international trade;\nfacilitating  investment  and  trade  by  (a)  strengthening  the  policy  framework\ngoverning  domestic  investment  and  FDI,  and  (b)  improving  duty  drawback  and\ncustoms procedures; and\nrationalizing  assistance \nto  SMEs  by  (a) improving  policy  coordination  and\nimplementation,  (b)  improving  financial  intermediation,  and  (c) strengthening\ntechnical and business service support.\n\nC. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions\n\n1.\n\nStrengthening Competition\n\na.\n\nStrengthening the Commercial Legal and Regulatory Environment\n\n82.\nBeginning in 1998, as a part of the Program, the Government has initiated a far reaching\nreform  of  the  commercial  legal  system  to  promote  competition  and  provide  individuals  and\nbusinesses with greater certainty on their rights, and with predictability relative to their commercial\ntransactions  and  legal  relationships.  To  facilitate  resource  mobility  and  exit  mechanisms  the\nGovernment  approved  a  new  Bankruptcy  Law  in  August  1998  and  issued  a  supplementary\nPresidential  Decree  and  implementing  regulations  that  established  commercial  courts  with\nexclusive \njurisdiction  over  bankruptcy  proceedings,  permitted  qualified  private  sector\nprofessionals  to  serve  as  receivers  and  administrators  in  bankruptcy  and  reorganization\nproceedings,  and  specified  time  limits  for  the  proceedings.  Supported  by  a  number  of  aid\nagencies,  the  Government  completed  training  for  the  first  group  of  commercial  court  judges,\nreceivers,  and  administrators.  Complementing  these  measures,  the  Jakarta  Initiative  has\nestablished  a  mechanism  for  out  of  court  settlements  of  debt-restructuring  that  will  facilitate\ncorporate restructuring and resource mobility.\n\n83.\nHowever, both the court and out-of court avenues for debt resolution have suffered from\nimplementation difficulties and delays. The number of bankruptcy cases has been small, and the\nquality  of  some  judgements  questionable.  The  out-of-court  avenue  for  restructuring  has  been\nslow. The Government has, therefore, initiated a review with a view to developing a more effective\nstrategy. Based on this review, a Financial Sector Policy Committee was established in December\n1999  to  implement  an  enhanced  restructuring  strategy,  and  IBRA  and  the  Government  were\nempowered  to  take  steps  against  recalcitrant  debtors  including  that  of  referral  to  the  Jakarta\nInitiative,  and  to  the  Attorney  General  for  initiation  of  bankruptcy  proceedings.  These  measures\nsignificantly  strengthen  mechanisms  and  incentives  for  bankruptcy  proceedings  and  out-of-court\nsettlements  of  debt  restructuring,  and  are  complemented  by  a  renewed  focus  on  strengthening\ninsolvency  procedures  through  judicial  training  and  reform.  As  a  result  of  these  measures,  by\nDecember 1999, 620 of 800 large debtors (i.e. with loans over Rp50 billion; these accounting for\n70 percent  of  non-performing  loans)  had  signed  letters  of  commitment  with  specified  tests  of\n\n\f21\n\ncooperation; a data base has been created of 3,900 debtors with debts over Rp1 billion; and the\nfirst round of legal actions initiated against 119 non-cooperating debtors.\n\n84.\nTo  further  promote  industrial  restructuring,  the  Program  strengthens  the  legal  basis\nallowing  firms  entry  into  markets  and  providing  them  adequate  protection  from  anticompetitive\npractices.  In  March  1999,  the  Government  issued  the  Competition  Law  that,  in  accordance  with\ninternational best practice, (i) focuses on fair market conduct (ii) applies to both SOEs and private\nenterprises  and  (iii) makes  provision  for  an  independent  commission  to  prevent  anticompetitive\npractices.  A Presidential  Decree  was  issued  in  July  1999  establishing  the  independent\nCommission for Competition Supervision. By June 2000, the Program envisages that an adequate\nbudget  and  staff  will  be  provided  to  enable  the  Commission  to  undertake  its  initial  background\nwork.    By  September  2001,  the  Government  is  expected  to  operationalize  the  commission  and\nhave  issued  its  manual  of  administrative  procedure,  and  the  rules  and  procedures  governing\nmarket conduct and anti-competitive practices.  An ADB-financed TA will support capacity building\nof the commission (see paras. 119 to 122).\n\nb.\n\nSimplification of the Regulatory Framework\n\n85.\nThe  Government  established  a Deregulation  and  Competition  Task  Force  in  September\n1999 to work closely with the Commission for Competition Supervision to rationalize and simplify\nthe regulatory regime, promote competition, and create a level playing field for all enterprises. In\nthis connection, the Task Force will (i) review and devise criteria for the economic evaluation of\ncommercial laws and regulations from the perspective of the net public benefit; (ii) complete the\nreview  of  existing  laws,  regulations,  and  decrees  for  agreed  manufacturing  subsectors  that  are\ninconsistent  with  the  Competition  Law,  with  a  view  to  determining  their  cost  and  benefit  to  the\npublic  and  making  recommendations  for  improving  or  repealing  such  laws,  regulations,  and\ndecrees; (iii) identify existing licenses, approvals, and permits imposing high compliance costs on\nSMEs,  and  develop  proposals  for  eliminating  or  replacing  them.  The  Task  Force  will,  by\nSeptember  2001, publish  a  report  of  its  findings  and  recommendations.  Taking  into  account  the\nTask  Force\u2019s  recommendations,  and  in  consultation  with  ADB,  the  Government  will  simplify  the\nregulatory framework.\n\nc.\n\nPromotion  of  Domestic  Competition  by  Removing  Entry  Barriers  to\nDomestic Trade\n\n86.\nThe Program supports the Government\u2019s efforts to increase competition in domestic trade\nby  eliminating  entry  barriers  to  the  participation  of  domestic  investment  and  FDI,  and  removing\ndomestic marketing and distribution restraints applicable to cloves, paper, plywood, and cement.\nSince  attracting  foreign  distributors/wholesalers  is  an  important  objective  under  the  Program,  in\nOctober 1998 the Government revoked the Investment Coordination Board (BKPM) Decree Nos.\n11/SK/1998  and  12/SK/1998,  which  restricted  FDI  in  these  areas.  Foreign  investors  are  now\nallowed  to  undertake  wholesale  and  retail  activities  in  the  domestic  market  and  act  as  general\nexporters  and  importers.  Among  others,  this  will  benefit  local  exporters,  particularly  SMEs,  that\nare currently unable to afford to enter the export business on their own.\n\n87.\nThe  Government  is  also  strengthening  competition  and  the  efficiency  of  resource\nallocation by (i) eliminating controls on ex-factory prices of fertilizer set by the Ministry of Finance\n(MOF);  (ii)  eliminating  the  fertilizer  distribution  monopoly  held  by  the  state-owned  PT  Pusri  and\nvillage cooperatives; and (iii) developing an action plan to liberalize the distribution of oil products\nand the gasoline retail subsector. Actions (i) and (ii) have been completed and action (iii) will be\ncompleted by September 2001.\n\n\f22\n\nd.\n\nStrengthening  of  International  Competition  by  Reducing  Tariff  and\nNontariff Barriers\n\nThe Program supports the Government\u2019s proposals for tariff reductions under Asean Free\n88.\nTrade  Area.  These  envisage  a  maximum  rate  of  10  percent  and  virtually  all  rates  reduced  to\n0-5 percent by 2003. To gradually move toward these long term targets some key tariff reductions\nwere made between April 1998 and October 1999. These include reduction in: (i) the maximum\ntariff  rate  on  automotive  components  from  200  percent  to  80  percent;  (ii)  tariff  rates  by\n5 percentage  points  for  all  goods  with  rates  of  15-25  percent  (excluding  motor  vehicles  and\nalcohol);  (iii)  tariff    rates  by  5  percentage  points  for  nonfood  agriculture  products;  and  (iv)  zero\ntariffs  in  the  final  rate  of  import  duty  on  basic  materials  for  the  production  of  automotive\ncomponents. Finally, imports of goods and materials from bonded warehouses to be processed,\nassembled, or installed in other goods for manufacturing motor vehicles destined for exports were\nexempted from import duties.\n\nFollowing the above, Indonesia now has one of the most transparent tariff structures in the\n89.\nworld with almost all specific and split tariffs replaced by ad valorem rates in blocks of 5 percent.\nAs of November 1999, there were 7,274 tariff lines with only 74 of them exceeding 30 percent and\nthe bulk of them (5,249) being between zero (1,508 lines) and 10 percent.\n\n90.\nThe  Government  has  also  been  liberalizing  the  historically  complex  and  restrictive\nstructure of nontariff barriers. In this connection, by December 1999, it has (i) eliminated BULOG\u2019s\nimport  monopoly;  (ii)  abolished  local  content  requirements  for  dairy  products;  (iii) abolished\nnontariff  barriers  on  imports  of  used  ships;  and  (iv)  accelerated  the  phasing  out  of  protection  of\nthe automotive industry by eliminating local content requirements for the industry. In addition, as\nof December 1999, the restrictive import licensing requirement has been liberalized on about 120\nof  190  items.  Of  the  remaining  items  still  subject  to  restrictive  licensing,  the  Government  is\nexpected to retain licenses imposed for environmental, moral, safety, security, and public health\nreasons.  By September 2001, all IP and IT licenses outside of these categories will be liberalized\ninto  a  system  of  transparent  and  non-discriminatory  instruments  involving  either  (a) conversion\ninto the general class of licenses available to all interested importers through simple registration,\nor (b) conversion into duties and excise taxes.\n\n2.\n\nInvestment Promotion and Trade Facilitation\n\na.\n\nImprovement of  Investment Policy Framework and Practice\n\n91.\nThe Program supports the Government\u2019s objective of introducing a new investment policy\nand law that will provide a more liberal, transparent and uniform legal and institutional framework\nfor  investment.  This  will  improve  confidence  of  investors  and  lay  the  foundation  for  a  more\ncompetitive  and  robust  industrial  sector  that  is  consistent  with  Indonesia\u2019s  comparative\nadvantage. By reducing the opportunities for discretionary and ad hoc provision of incentives, the\nProgram will reduce opportunities for corruption and contribute to improved governance.\n\n92. With a view to eliminating discriminatory constraints embedded in the legal and regulatory\nframework,  between  July  and  September  1999,  the  Government  took  the  following  steps:\n(i) establishment  of  performance  targets  for  approval  \u201cin  principle\u201d  for  FDI  within  no  more  than\n10 working  days  for  investments  up  to  $100  million  and  20  working  days  for  investments  above\n$100  million;  (ii) relaxation  of  the  requirement  that  FDI  be  located  in  designated  industrial\nestates/zones; (iii) transfer of investment approvals below $100 million from the President to the\nInvestment Board  and (iv) transfer of approvals below  Rp10 billion from the Investment Board to\nregional  authorities.  These  measures  were  capped  in  November  1999  by  the  elimination  of  the\nrequirement  of  Presidential  approvals  for  foreign  investment.  Futhermore,  all  investors  are  now\n\n\f23\n\nable  to  seek  approval  of  investment  proposals,  regardless  of  the  amount,  from  the  Investment\nBoard,  the  regional  investment  coordinating  boards,  or  Indonesian  Embassies.  By  September\n2000 the Government will also have removed restrictions that FDI can only be made in existing\nfirms to \u201crescue and restore\u201d these firms.\n\n93.\nConsistent  with  a  more  open  approach  to  attracting  foreign  investment,  the  Government\nhas curtailed the negative investment list that limits FDI and reduced the number of sectors closed\nto new FDI from 35 prior to the crisis to 9 as of June 1999. By September 2000, the Government\nwill  further  reduce  the  number  of  sectors  closed  to  FDI;  and,  by  December  2000  reduce  the\nnumber  of  sectors  (i)  reserved  for  small  enterprises  and  (ii) in  which  enterprises  are  required  to\nenter into mandatory business partnerships with SMEs.\n\nBased on the liberalizing measures above, and on a review of international experience, by\n94.\nDecember 2000 the Government plans to announce an investment policy statement that will set\nout its incentive framework and approach for promoting and facilitating investment in accordance\nwith international best practice. The policy statement will outline key steps to be taken to attract\nforeign investment, strengthen the Investment Board\u2019s role, rationalize the provision of incentives\non  a  sustainable  basis,  and  outline  the  scope  of  the  new  law  for  investment.  Following  this,  an\ninvestment  law  based  on  the  investment  policy  statement  will  be  issued  by  September  2001.\nLaunching its work in this area, the Government is reevaluating the role of the Investment Board.\nBased  on  this,  the  role  of  the  Investment  Board  as  a  resource  centre  for  investors  and  as  an\nagency  for  investment  facilitation  and  promotion  will  be  strengthened  by  September  2001,  and\nreflected in the budget and staffing of appropriate departments.\n\n b.\n\nStreamlining  of  Duty  Drawback  Procedures  and  Improvement  of\nTransparency\n\n95.\nAs  highlighted  above,  the  trade  rationalization  and  liberalization  program  will  be\naccelerated to reduce differential tariff treatment of firms and reduce the duties on imported raw\nmaterials and intermediate products. While this will ultimately reduce the significance of incentives\ncurrently provided via duty drawbacks and rebates, there remains significant scope to improve the\nsystem\u2019s  treatment  of  and  accessibility  to  SMEs  and  indirect  exporters.  The  Government  will\nthe\ncomplete  a  review  of  duty  drawback  procedures  by  March  2001  and \nrecommendations arising out of the review.\n\nimplement \n\nc.  \n\nFacilitation of Trade Through Improved Customs Procedures\n\n96.\nIndonesia\u2019s  recovery  from  the  economic  crisis  depends  in  large  part  on  revitalizing\nindustries  that  depend  critically  on  trade,  both  importers  and  exporters.  Inefficient  customs\nprocedures  have  undermined  the  impact  of  trade  and  industrial  policy  liberalization  as  they\nobstruct and delay the smooth flow of traded goods. The Government is improving the efficiency\nof  customs  procedures  and  strengthening  the  Customs  and  Port  authorities  by  eliminating\ndiscretionary  interventions  by  using  red  and  green  channel  system;  reducing  excessive\nexaminations; incorporating performance standards; and making other procedural, administrative,\nand organizational changes. Under these new arrangements, effective June 1999 (i) no more than\n10  percent  of  imports  are  subject  to  inspection;  (ii)  the  release  order  for  imports  is  to  be  issued\nautomatically within 4 hours of submission of import documents unless it has been classified for\nscrutiny  through  the  red  channel;  and  (iii)  imports  routed  through  the  red  channel  are  to  be\nreleased  within  12 hours  of  submission  of  documents.  These  measures  and  performance\nstandards  for  document  clearances  conform  to  international  best  practice  and  place  greater\nreliance  on  processing  approvals  through  modern  computerized  systems.  They  thus  help  avoid\ndiscretionary interventions by Customs while enabling the transport of a major portion of imports\ndirectly  from  ports  and  airports  to  importer  premises.  The  Program  will  monitor  the  progress  in\nachieving closer integration between importers, shipping companies and banks.\n\n\f24\n\n3.\n\nRationalization of  Assistance to SMEs\n\n97.\nThe  dynamics  of  SME  growth  have  important  implications  for  policy  making.  SMEs\noperate  in  a  highly  competitive  and  risky  environment,  are  conservatively  leveraged,  and  use\nsmall  amounts  of  capital  that  is  turned  over  rapidly.  Those  able  to  produce  for  a  niche  market,\nadapting quality and cost to market demand, have high potential. The sector experiences high exit\nand  entry  rates.  Rather  than  being  a  symptom  of  structural  weakness  that  requires  corrective\npolicies,  the  high  rate  of  entry  and  exit  reflects  the  flexibility  with  which  the  sector  adjusts  to\nchanging market conditions, including sharp macroeconomic downturns like that experienced by\nIndonesia. The ongoing structural transformation of the economy provides opportunities for both\nexisting  and  new  SMEs,  and  requires  a  reorientation  of  the  approach  to  promoting  SMEs  away\nfrom its previous focus on protecting the sector to one in which the focus is on providing it greater\nflexibility.  The  thrust  of  the  policy  focus  should  thus  be  on  reducing  excessive  bureaucratic\ninterference  rather  than  on  seeking  additional  support  programs.  Where  support  programs  are\nrequired  they  should  be  demand  driven  and  supplied  by  the  market  rather  than  Government\ndepartments.\n\n98.\nReflecting the above considerations, the Government\u2019s primary objective is to identify and\nset an appropriate overall strategy. The strategy will, in turn, set the direction for policy development\nand  determine  what,  if  any,  specific  programs  are  required  for  SMEs.  Under  the  Program,  the\nGovernment will enhance the efficiency of SMEs through industrial deregulation (which will reduce\ntransactions  costs),  more  effective  financial  intermediation,  and  improved  provision  of  business\nand technical services. These policy reforms will be formulated and implemented in consultation\nwith stakeholders. The Government will launch surveys and studies to update information on the\nimpact  of  the  economic  crisis  on  SMEs  and  design  appropriate  policy  and  monitoring\nmechanisms.\n\na.\n\nBroadening  of  Participation  of  SMEs \nImplementation, and Improved Interagency Coordination\n\nin  Policy  Making  and\n\n99.\nTo coordinate the design and implementation of a reform strategy for SMEs, in September\n1999  the  Government  established  the  SME  Task  Force.  An  SME  Policy  Workshop  was  held  in\nDecember  1999  with  the  support  of  aid  agencies  including  ADB.    Based  on  its  deliberations,\nbroad terms of reference were drawn up for the SME Task Force. By September 2000, the Task\nForce  will  develop  a  medium-term  strategy  for  SME  development,  and  implement  measures  to\nensure  that  this  strategy  is  implemented  and  publicly  disseminated.  The  strategy  is  expected  to\ncover  the  following:  (i)  developing  an  institutional  framework  for  SME  policy  implementation;\n(ii) expanding  access  to  finance  for  SMEs;  (iii)  making  business  development  services  more\nresponsive to SME needs;  (iv) streamlining government regulations affecting small and medium\nbusinesses;  and  (v)  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  government  SME  programs.  These  efforts  will\nbe supported by TA from ADB (paras. 123 to 126).\n\n100.\nIn 1997, the Government initiated steps to identify the plethora of regulations and licenses\nfaced  by  SMEs.  As  part  of  these  efforts,  the  State  Ministry  of  Cooperatives  and  Small  and\nMedium  Enterprises  (SMOCSME)  undertook  limited  studies  on  the  licensing  requirements  for\nSMEs.  Studies  have  also  been  carried  out  by  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs).  These\nefforts will be  supplemented with a more comprehensive survey that will identify bottlenecks and\nrecommend simplification of the regulatory system.  Bank TA will assist in this undertaking (see\nparas. 119-122).\n\n\f25\n\nb.\n\nEfficiency of Financial Intermediation\n\n101.\nTo reduce wastage of public resources and opportunities for rent seeking, and to improve\nmarket  access  of  all  economic  sectors  to  sustainable  sources  of  finance  on  market  terms,  the\nGovernment will rationalize and streamline SME finance programs with improved risk sharing and\nrisk assessment by intermediating banks. As a first step, the Government has eliminated BI\u2019s role\nin  the  provision  of  liquidity  credit  that  financed  most  such  programs.  In  November  1999,  the  16\ncredit programs previously financed or managed by BI were transferred to three institutions that\nwill  act  as  coordinators  in  their  continued  operation:  (i) 12 credit  programs  for  SMEs  and\ncooperatives  will  be  managed  by  the  state-owned  company,  PT  Madani;27  (ii)  KUT  and  credit\nschemes  for  primary  credit  cooperatives  and  sugar  cane  cooperatives  have  been  transferred  to\nBRI;  and  (iii)  the  credit  program  for  low  cost  housing  has  been  transferred  to  Bank  Tabungan\nNegara.\n\n102. Under the Guidance of the SME Task Force, the Government will launch an evaluation of\nthe  rationale,  effectiveness,  and  performance  of  all  existing  credit  schemes  for  SMEs,\ncooperatives, and plantations (currently being managed by PT Madani). The recommendations of\nthe review and evaluations carried out in consultation with ADB will be implemented in a phased\nmanner starting from September  2000.  By December 2000, the credit schemes will have been\nconsolidated to no more than two schemes for cooperatives and SMEs. These schemes are to be\nbased on a single interest rate determined on commercial principles with full risk of default borne\nby  participating  banks.  Interest  rate  subsidies,  if  any,  will  be  supported  by  adequate  budget\nprovisions.\n\n103. Similarly,  the  Government  will  initiate  the  evaluation  of  agricultural  credit  schemes,\ncurrently managed on its behalf by BRI, with the view to developing a more effective strategy for\nthe provision of rural credit.\n\nTo improve financial intermediation, by June 2000, the Government will announce a plan\n104.\nto phase out mandatory lending requirements under which commercial banks must lend a certain\nproportion of their loan portfolio to SMEs.  At the same time, measures will be taken to encourage\ncommercial banks to develop effective lending mechanisms to improve financial intermediation for\nSMEs.  The key objective is to reduce the transaction costs for SME credit through use of proper\ncredit  information  and  monitoring  systems  that  identify  creditworthy  borrowers  and  facilitate\nprudent  lending  decisions  and  an  effective  loan  recovery  mechanism  backed  by  a  registry  for\ncollateral.    These  measures  will  draw  upon  the  results  achieved  by  BRI  and  other  sound  SME-\nlending  institutions  that  have  demonstrated  the  efficacy  of  these  techniques,  while  continuing  to\nlend at market-based rates even during the economic crisis. These efforts will be supported by TA\nprovided under the Program (see paras. 123 to 126).\n\nc.\n\nCommercial Orientation of Technical and Business Support\n\n105. Under  supervision  of  the  SME  Task  Force,  by  September  2001  the  Government  will\nconsolidate  and  streamline  the  existing  SME  technical  and  business  support  operations.  This\nundertaking will involve (i) rationalizing the responsibilities for designing, implementing, monitoring\nand  evaluating  business  service  programs;  (ii)  shifting  from  supply  pushed  to  demand  driven\n\n                  \n\n27 The schemes are Working Capital Credits\u2013Bank Perkreditan Rakyat/Bank Perkreditan Rakyat Syariah (KMK-BPR/BPRS);\nMicro-and  Small-Scale  Entrepreneurs\u2019  Credits  through  Bank  Perkreditan  Rakyat  (KPKM-BPR);  Micro-and  Small-Scale\nEntrepreneurs\u2019  Credits  through  Bank  Perkreditan  Rakyat  (KPKM-BPR);  Micro-and  Small-Scale  Entrepreneurs\u2019  Credits\nthrough  Commercial  Banks  (KPKM-Commercial  Banks);  City  Bus  General  Transport  Businesses\u2019  Credits  (KUAUBP);\nNational Private Large Plantations\u2019 Credits (PBSN); Transmigration People Core Company Credits (PIR-Trans); Primary\nCooperatives  Credits  for  Members-General  (KKPA-General);  Primary  Cooperatives  Credits  for  Members-Profit  Sharing\n(KKPA-Profit-Sharing);  Primary  Cooperatives  Credits  for  Members-Fishermen  (KKPA-fishermen);  Primary  Cooperatives\nCredits  for  Members-Poultry  (KKPA-Poultry);  Primary  Cooperatives  Credits  for  Members-Indonesian  Manpower  (KKPA-\nTKI); Primary Cooperatives Credits for Members-the People\u2019s Transmigration Core Plantation (KKPA-PIR Trans).\n\n\f26\n\nservices;  (iii)  shifting  of  service  delivery  from  the  Government  to  private  sector  providers.  The\nSME Task Force will develop performance criteria to evaluate support operations and prepare an\naction  plan  to  commercialize  and  eventually  privatize  commercially  oriented  technical  and\nbusiness services including technical service centers and small business industrial estates.\n\nD.\n\nEconomic and Poverty Impact\n\n1.\n\nEconomic Impact\n\n106.\nIn the long run, the Program will result in higher industrial productivity and efficiency.  The\nProgram\u2019s  support  of  reforms  to  deregulate  entry  and  exit  will  raise  capacity  utilization  and\nproductivity  in  the  medium  term.  By  enhancing  competitive  pressures  these  policy  changes  are\nexpected  to  induce  technical  change,  innovation,  and  sustained  effort  to  raise  productivity  and\nreduce costs. By encouraging FDI the Program eases barriers to the free flow of resources and\nenhances access to technology and managerial and organizational expertise.\n\n107. While  promoting  investment,  however,  the  Program  will  be  affected  by  the  broader\neconomic environment that affects investment decisions. The supply or investment response will\ndepend  critically  on  the  impact  of  stabilization  measures,  with  substantial  international  evidence\nindicating that resumption of private investment may be delayed in the aftermath of stabilization.28\nThe initial contractionary monetary policy put pressure on interest rates, reducing investment and\ngrowth of output. Despite recent declines in interest rates, there is continued investor reluctance\nto  commit  resources  given  their  perceived  uncertainty  regarding  the  policy  regime.  The  sharp\ndecline in investment following the implementation of stabilization measures in 1998 is consistent\nwith international experience.  However, the Government's recent success in lowering inflation is\nhighly encouraging as experience from other countries shows that a sustained low inflation rate is\nstrongly associated with investment recovery.\n\n2.\n\nPoverty Impact\n\n108.\nThe  Poverty  Impact  Assessment  is  provided  in  Appendix  4.  The  actions  under  the\nProgram are fully consistent with the three key components of ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy,\nnamely, pro-poor sustainable economic growth, good governance, and social development.29 Pro-\npoor  sustainable  economic  growth  is  to  be  achieved  through  the  Program\u2019s  focus  on  removing\nmarket-distorting  restrictions  on \nimports  and  exports,  eliminating  credit  subsidies,  and\nderegulating  to  level  the  playing  field  for  all  enterprises  and  provide  a  conducive  business\nenvironment. These measures will expand economic opportunities by reversing policies that often\nprovided  protection  and  assistance  to  large  or  influential  firms  or  business  groups.  While  the\nProgram  will  lead  to  income  generation  and  higher  employment,  one  of  the  proposed  TAs  (see\nparas.  123  to  126)  provides  a  mechanism  for  monitoring  the  impact  of  the  economic  crisis  and\nrestructuring  on  vulnerable  groups.  The  Program\u2019s  focus  on  improving  governance  by\nstrengthening  regulation  of  competitive  markets,  and  institutionalizing  greater  participation  of\nSMEs, women entrepreneurs, and other typical low-income stakeholders in the policy formulation\nand implementation process contributes to poverty reduction by way of empowerment of affected\nclasses  of  civil  society.  The  identification  and  support  of  groups  representing  female  SME\nentrepreneurs  carried  out  under  the  Program,  and  their  participation  in  its  implementation,  will\npromote gender development.\n\n                  \n\n28 The general proposition is that the predictability of the incentive structure and the macroeconomic policy environment are\nthe most important factors explaining private investment. The volatility of output, prices, the real exchange rate and export\nrevenues  tend  to  reduce  private  investment.  A.Solimano,  \"How  Private  Investment  Reacts  to  Changing  Macroeconomic\nConditions\",  World  Bank  Working Paper Series No. 212  (1989);  and  A.  Dixit,  \"Investment  and  Hysterisis\",  Journal of\nEconomic Perspectives, 1991.\n\n29 Fighting Poverty in Asia and the Pacific: The Poverty Reduction Strategy of the Asian Development Bank, approved on\n\n9 November 1999.\n\n\f27\n\nThe  experience  with  alternative  reform  strategies  in  Indonesia  indicates  that  trade  and\n109.\nindustrial  deregulation  more  effectively  promotes  productivity  growth,  higher  real  wages,  and\ngreater employment of unskilled labor than do policies that impair competition. Improvements in\nreal  wages  and  rapid  creation  of  jobs  for  unskilled  and  semiskilled  workers  is  key  to  long-term\npoverty reduction. The Program\u2019s focus on promoting SME growth and development contributes\nto  the  demand  for  wage  employment  of  these  categories  of  workers.  As  it  is  SMEs  rather  than\nlarge enterprises that are the primary buyers of goods and services from the household or cottage\nsector from whom the poor are predominantly drawn, the vitality of the SME sector is essential to\npoverty reduction. The liberalization of the enabling environment under the Program will allow this\nsector  to  become  more  dynamic  and  productive,  absorb  greater  numbers  of  poor  into  the  labor\nforce,  and  increase  the  standard  of  living  for  a  significant  proportion  of  the  population  already\nengaged in the sector. As large numbers of women are employed in the sector or operate as SME\nbusiness  owners,  particularly  at  the  lowest  end  of  the  scale,  they  will  benefit  from  the  program\nreforms.  The  SME  sector  has  also  shown  great  resilience  and  ability  to  adapt  to  the  changes\nbrought about by the economic crisis. For these reasons, strong recovery in the SME sector will\nnot  only  increase  demand  for  the  goods  and  services  of  the  poor  and  increase  the  standard  of\nliving  for  a  large  proportion  of  the  labor  force,  but  will  also  be  seen  as  a  positive  sign  of  the\nbeginning of the end of the crisis.\n\n110.\nThe  Program  does  not  contribute  to  significant  additional  unemployment,  as  this\nadjustment had occurred over 1998 and 1999. The Government\u2019s capacity to mitigate the social\ncosts  of  adjustment  are  augmented  by  the  resources  provided  by  the  Program,  which  can  be\ndrawn  from  the  budget  in  a  general  way  to  supplement  the  considerable  resources  the\nGovernment  is  directing  towards  this  objective.  The  success  of  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  in\nmanaging  the  adjustment  process  is  reflected  in  the  aggregate  level  of  consumption  in  the\neconomy showing a relatively small decline in real terms in 1998, and a return in 1999 to levels\nclose to those prior to the crisis. These aggregate figures are supported by the preliminary results\nof  ADB\u2019s  country  poverty  study  which  indicate  that  the  incidence  of  poverty  has  increased  less\nthan had originally been thought.\n\nA. \n\nAmount of Loan, and Source of Funds\n\nVI.\n\nTHE PROPOSED LOAN\n\n111.\nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  support  the  Government\u2019s  policy  reforms  by  providing  a  loan  of\n$200 million.30  The  Borrower  will  be  the  Republic  of  Indonesia.  The  loan  will  be  from  the  ADB\u2019s\nordinary  capital  resources  with  interest  determined  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  pool-based\nvariable  lending  rate  system  for  US  dollar  loans  and  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75  percent  per\nannum  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  standard  terms  for  program  loans.  A  front-end  fee  will  be\npayable  in  an  amount  equal  to  one  percent  of  the  amount  of  the  loan.  ADB  shall  be  entitled  to\nwithdraw and pay itself on behalf of the Government the amount of the front-end fee from the loan\naccount.  The  loan  will  have  an  amortization  period  of  15  years,  including  a  grace  period  of\n3 years. It is expected that the loan proceeds will be utilized over a period of 18 months from the\ndate  of  loan  effectiveness.  Total  adjustment  costs  related  to  the  Program  is  estimated  at  about\n$650 million during the Program period. These consist of:\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nlost revenues from tariff reform (about $150 million);\ncosts of administrative reforms linked to the computerization and reorganization of\ncustoms ($25 million);\nestablishment of Commission for Competition Supervision and other administrative\nreforms ($5 million); and\n\n                  \n\n30 The possibilities of loan cofinancing have been pursued in conjunction with the ADB loan from the beginning of processing.\n\nPotential loan cofinanciers include, among others, JBIC.\n\n\f28\n\n(iv) \n\nlost revenues resulting from the simplification of the licensing and approval regime\n($470 million over two years).\n\nThe  elimination  of  protection \nfertilizer  distribution,\nin  a  number  of  sectors, \npetrochemicals  and  other  domestic  trade  sectors  is  expected  to  impose  upfront  costs  to\nenterprises  in  terms  of  restructuring  and  retooling  needs  to  meet  the  requirements  of  a  more\ncompetitive environment introduced by the Program. These costs are expected to be considerable\nbut are difficult to quantify.\n\nincluding \n\nB.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1.\n\nExecuting Agency and Steering Committee\n\n112. MOF  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  and  will  (i)  have  overall  supervision  of  program\nimplementation,  (ii)  ensure  that  the  reforms  under  the  Program  are  undertaken  in  line  with  the\nagreed upon timetable,  (iii) initiate withdrawals under the loan, and (iv) allocate and monitor the\nuse of counterpart funds.\n\n113. MOF will be assisted by a program steering committee (PSC) for interagency consultation\nand  coordination  relating  to  item  (i)  above.  The  Coordinating  Ministry  for  Economy  and  Finance\nwill  chair  the  PSC  comprising  senior  officials  from  BAPPENAS,  MOIT,  MOF,  BI,  the  Investment\nBoard,  and  SMOCSME.  A  program  implementation  secretariat  will  be  established  within\nBAPPENAS to support the functioning of the PSC.\n\n2.\n\nProcurement and Disbursement\n\n114.\nThe  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  utilized  to  finance  the  foreign  exchange  costs  of  items\nproduced  in,  and  procured  from,  ADB\u2019s  member  countries  (other  than  those  items  specified  in\nAppendix 5 and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources, including other loans\nmade by ADB). The Government will certify that, (i) in case the proceeds of the loan will finance\nimports already made, the value of eligible imports in the period concerned exceed the amount of\nthe requested withdrawal, or (ii) in case the loan proceeds are to finance goods to be imported,\nthe value of eligible imports in the immediately preceding one year period are equal to or greater\nthan the amount of the requested disbursement plus all other amounts expected to be withdrawn\nfrom the loan during the succeeding one year. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan\nproceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification.\n\n3.\n\nCounterpart Funds\n\n115.\nThe  counterpart  funds  to  be  generated  out  of  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  by  the\nGovernment to support the costs of structural adjustment and other activities consistent with the\nProgram.\n\n4.\n\nTranching and Monitoring\n\n116.\nThe Program period will be two years. The first tranche, equivalent to $100 million, will be\nmade available upon loan effectiveness planned for March 2000. The conditions for release of the\nfirst  tranche  includes  30  policy  actions  that  have  been  fully  complied  with.  The  second  tranche\nincludes  an  incentive  subtranche,  equivalent  to  $50  million  and  a  final  subtranche  equivalent  to\n$50  million.  The  incentive  subtranche  is  to  be  released  by  December  2000,  upon  satisfactory\ncompliance with the following conditions:\n\n(i) \n\nProvision  of  an  adequate    budget  and    staff  for  the  Commission  for  Competition\nSupervision;\n\n\f(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n29\n\nIssuance of a Presidential Decree to reduce the number of business fields to new\nforeign investment;\nIssuance  of  a  Presidential  Decree  to  reduce  the  number  of  business  fields\nreserved  for  small  firms  and  in  which  enterprises  are  required  to  enter  into\nmandatory business partnerships with small firms;\nRemoval  of  restrictions  to  allow  FDI  to  be  made  in  existing  firms  to  \u201crescue  and\nrestore these firms;\nIssuance of an Investment Policy Satement setting out the Government\u2019s approach\nto further streamlining and rationalizing the promotion and facilitation of investment\nin accordance with international best practices; and\nRationalization  of  the  SME  credit  program  by  reducing  the  number  of  credit\nschemes to no more than two catering for cooperatives and for SME sector. These\nschemes  are  to  be  based  on  a  single  interest  rate  determined  on  commercial\nprinciples with full risk of nonpayment being borne by participating banks. Interest\nrate subsidies, if any, are to be supported by adequate provisions in the budget.\n\nThe final subtranche of the second tranche, equivalent to $50 million, will be released by\n117.\nSeptember 2001 upon the Government\u2019s maintaining compliance with the earlier met conditions,\nincluding the incentive subtranche conditions, and compliance with the following specific actions:\n\nPublishing of the Deregulation and Competition Task Force  findings of the review\nof  the  existing  laws,  regulations  and  decrees  that  are  inconsistent  with  the\nCompetition  Law  and \nimpose  high  compliance  costs  on  SMEs,  and\nrecommendations on simplifying and rationalization of the regulatory framework;\nLiberalization of all license approvals and permits required of IP and IT other than\nthose required for environmental, moral, safety, security, or public health reasons\nby converting these into (a) the general class of licenses available to all interested\nimporters through simple registration; (b) appropriate duties or excise taxes;\nStrengthening  of  the  role  of  the  Investment  Board  as  a  resource  center  and  an\ninvestment promotion and facilitation body;\nIssuance  of  an  Investment  Law  consistent  with  the  Investment  Policy  Statement;\nand\nConsolidation and streamlining of the SME technical/business support programs.\n\n118.\nThe Government will monitor the implementation of the Program, and the Government and\nADB  will  undertake  regular  reviews  of  the  implementation  and  assess  the  impact  of  all  relevant\nsector reforms. To assist ADB\u2019s reviews, which are tentatively scheduled for October 2000, March\n2001  and  July  2001  (prior  to  the  second  tranche  release),  the  Government  will  provide  relevant\ninformation through quarterly reports on the progress and impact of the policy reforms. At the end\nof the program period, the Government will submit a program completion report to ADB.\n\nVII.\n\nTHE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\n\nA.\n\nPromoting Deregulation and Competition\n\n119.\nThe proposed TA is an integral part of the Program as it will help continue deregulation of\ntrade  and  industry.  The  TA\u2019s  objective  is  to  provide  institutional  and  analytical  support  to  the\nGovernment  in  reviewing  and  rationalizing  the  industrial  regulatory  system  based  on  consistent\neconomic criteria for the assessment of net benefits of policy interventions. The TA will help the\nDeregulation  and  Competition  Task  Force  and  the  Commission  for  Competition  Supervision  in\ntheir efforts to simplify the policy framework and promote competition.\n\n120.\n\nThe scope of the TA will include (for details see Appendix 6):\n\n\f(i)\n\nanalytical and institutional support for development of\n\n30\n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n(c) \n\neconomic criteria and framework to evaluate commercial laws, regulations,\nand policies that impede competition;\nguiding principles for public review of legislation; and\ndetailed procedures for a systematic review of commercial regulations and\nlaws  constraining  competition,  including  preparation  of  clear  and  simple\nnontechnical  guidelines  and  checklists \nthe  development  and\nimplementation of recommendations of a public benefit review process;\n\nfor \n\n(ii)\n\n(iii) \n\nimplementation  of  a  public  benefit  review  of  selected  industrial  policy  legislation\nand sectors based on the policy evaluation; and\n\ncapacity  building  through  workshops,  training  exercises,  and  other  assistance  as\nneeded  to  strengthen  the  analytical  and  institutional  capacity  of  the  Deregulation\nand Competition Task Force and the Commission for Competition Supervision.\n\n121.\nThe TA is estimated to cost $1.875 million equivalent, of which $1.22 million is the foreign\nexchange cost and $0.655 million is the local currency cost. The Government has asked ADB to\nfinance  $1.5  million  equivalent  to  cover  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $0.28 million\nequivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The  TA  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  Asian\nCurrency Crisis Support Facility (ACCSF), funded by the Government of Japan. The Government\nwill provide $0.375 million equivalent to finance counterpart staff, office facilities, and workshops.\nAppendix 7 presents the detailed cost estimates and financing plan.\n\n122.\nThe  TA  will  be  executed  by  the  Ministry  of  Industry  and  Trade  (MOIT)  and  will  be\nimplemented  over  12  months  starting  in  July  2000.  It  is  estimated  that  the  TA  will  require\n30 person-months of international consulting services. The international consultants will consist of\nexperts in industrial competition policy, trade and industry, and law. The international consultants\nwill  associate  with  domestic  consultants  who  will  provide  about  30 person-months  of  consulting\nservices  in  the  same  areas  of  expertise.  The  consultants  will  be  selected  in  accordance  with\nADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for\nrecruitment of domestic consultants.\n\nB.\n\nSmall and Medium Enterprise Development\n\nThe  objective  of  this  TA  is  to  develop  a  policy  and  institutional  framework  for  SMEs  in\n123.\naccordance  with  best  practice.  The  TA  will  assist  the  SME  Task  Force  in  formulating  and\nimplementing  a medium-term  SME  development  strategy,  and  will  contribute \nthe\nimplementation of the reform agenda under the Program, of which the TA is an integral part.\n\nto \n\n124.\n\nThe TA will focus on (see Appendix 8 for details):\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(v) \n\nassessing  the  institutional  mandate  of  concerned  ministries  and  agencies,  and\npreparing recommendations on policy measures to streamline and strengthen the\nagencies\u2019 respective functions and their coordination in the SME sector;\nreviewing and evaluating existing SME programs for delivery of business services;\nassessing  the  effectiveness  of  existing  SME  credit  schemes  and  identifying  ways\nto streamline and strengthen these while safeguarding existing viable commercial\nSME financial institutions;\n\n(iv)  monitoring  the  impact  of  the  economic  crisis  on  SMEs  to  ensure  informed  policy\n\nmaking; and\nbuilding capacity and providing training to improve awareness of the best practices\nin the policy design and implementation.\n\n\f31\n\nThis  will  lead  to  the  formulation  and  implementation  of  an  SME  development  strategy  and  the\nadoption of market-oriented approaches in the provision of SME services based on best practice.\n\nThe TA is estimated to cost $2.50 million equivalent, of which $1.61 million is the foreign\n125.\nexchange cost and $0.89 million equivalent is the local currency cost. The Government has asked\nADB  to  finance  $2.00  million  equivalent,  covering  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and\n$0.39 million equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from\nthe  Asian  Currency  Crisis  Support  Facility  (ACCSF),  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan.  The\nGovernment will provide $0.50 million equivalent to finance counterpart staff, office facilities, and\nworkshops. Appendix 9 presents a detailed cost estimates and financing plan.\n\nThe  TA  will  be  executed  by  SMOCSME  and  will  be  implemented  over  12  months\n126.\ncommencing  in  July  2000.  International  consultants  will  provide  about  40  person-months  of\nservices  and  will  include  experts  in  the  areas  of  SME  business  management  and  finance,\ninstitutional  development,  banking  and  law.  The  international  consultants  will  associate  with\ndomestic consultants, who will provide about 50 person-months of services in the areas of SME\nbusiness  service  provision,  financing  and  banking,  economics,  and  law.  The  consultants  will  be\nrecruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB for recruitment of domestic consultants.\n\nVIII.\n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS AND RISKS\n\nA.\n\nBenefits\n\n127.\nThe  policy  and  institutional  reforms  supported  by  the  Program  will  promote  competition\nand  efficiency,  reduce  the  costs  of  doing  business  in  Indonesia,  and  contribute  positively  to  the\nrestoration  of  economic  growth  and  development.  More  efficient  allocation  of  resources  is\nexpected to spur higher productivity and export growth across a wide range of industry sectors.\n\n128. A  significant  outcome  is  a  transparent  and  predictable  policy  framework  for  trade  and\nindustrial policy making and implementation. This will particularly benefit SMEs, which will face a\nmore predictable and less costly business environment. The more conducive policy environment\nunder  the  Program  will  promote  broad-based  growth  in  the  real  sector  and  will  improve  wage\nlevels and employment. An expanding SME sector will stimulate demand for labor from household\nand cottage industries where the poor are predominantly found in the urban manufacturing sector.\nTogether,  these  will  promote  structural  transformation  of  the  industrial  sector  and  shifting  of\nworkers  from  agriculture  and  nonwage  employment  to  higher  productivity,  higher  wage  jobs  in\nindustry and services. This growth in overall employment and the intersectoral shifting of workers\nwill  reduce  poverty.  This  effect  will  be  reinforced  by  the  expected  expansion  in  exports.  As\nIndonesia\u2019s manufacturing exports are labor intensive, export expansion will increase employment\nand  incomes  directly  among  households  whose  main  asset  is  their  labor,  i.e.,  relatively  poor\nhouseholds.\n\n129. Reduction of the remaining nontariff barriers and the provision of subsidies, and removal\nof  protection  will  contribute  to  reducing  opportunities  for  rent  seeking  and  corruption.  A  further\nmajor expected benefit is the considerable simplification of business registration requirements that\nwill significantly reduce the opportunities for illegal payments to facilitate business.\n\nThe  Government  will  benefit  from  improved  capabilities  in  industrial  and  SME  policy\n130.\nformulation,  while  stakeholders  will  have  more  effective \ninto  policy  design  and\nimplementation.  The  strengthening  of  key  independent  agencies  such  as  the  Commission  for\nCompetition Supervision and reorganization of Customs administration will improve governance in\npublic sector institutions.\n\ninput \n\n\f32\n\n131.\nThe  magnitude  of  the  anticipated  benefits  and  positive  impacts  of  the  Program  will  be\nlinked  to  progress  in  macroeconomic  stabilization  measures,  financial  sector  and  banking\nreforms,  State  owned  enterprises  reforms  and  restructuring,  and  resolution  of  corporate  debts.\nTaken  together,  these  reform  efforts  will  create  a  conducive  environment  for  sustainable\neconomic growth in Indonesia.\n\nB. \n\nRisks\n\n132.\nThe  Government\u2019s  management  of  the  reform  process  seeks  to  achieve  consensus\namong  stakeholders,  while  maintaining  the  objectives  and  timetables  of  its  structural  reform\nprogram.  The  key  concerns  are  the  adverse  transitional  consequences  of  labor  retrenchment,\nsubsidy reductions, and higher user fees that could provoke resistance from affected groups, slow\nthe pace of reforms, and jeopardize their sustainability. This risk is mitigated by the Government\u2019s\nstrong  commitment  to  the  reform  agenda  as  well  as  by  the  provision  of  financial  support  by  the\ninternational  community.  ADB  funding  for  the  Program  will  enable  the  Government  to  support\ntransfer programs that will help maintain consumption levels of groups most hard pressed by the\neconomic  crisis.  The  risk  of  policy  reversals  is  further  mitigated  by  governance  reforms  that\nstrengthen  the  role  of  independent  agencies  such  as  BI,  and  the  Commission  for  Competition\nSupervision. Finally, measures taken to reduce economic rent seeking are expected to strengthen\npublic confidence in the reform program.\n\n133. A second risk is the possibility that measures to rationalize subsidized credit policies will\nbe misconceived as reductions in credit and support for vulnerable sectors. This risk is mitigated\nby the Program and the associated TA, which support public consultation and the participation of\nSMEs in formulating more effective policies to promote the sector and meet its needs for business\nservices, credit, and capacity building.\n\n134. A third risk is that bank and corporate restructuring will proceed at a slow pace. This would\nmean  that  fewer  firms  would  be  able  to  take  advantage  of  the  opportunities  to  reposition\nthemselves provided by the improving industrial policy environment. This risk is mitigated by the\nGovernment\u2019s recent adoption of a more proactive strategy for industrial restructuring and by the\nsubstantial assistance being provided by the International Monetary Fund, ADB, World Bank, and\nbilateral funding agencies for bank and corporate restructuring.\n\nIX.\n\nASSURANCES\n\n135.\nThe Government has assured ADB that (i) the policies adopted and actions taken prior to\nthe date of the Loan Agreement, as described in the Development Policy Letter, will continue in\neffect for the duration of the Program; and (ii) it will promptly adopt the other policies and take the\nother  actions  included  in  the  Program  as  specified  in  the  Development  Policy  Letter  and  Loan\nAgreement  to  ensure  that  such  policies  and  actions  continue  in  effect  for  the  duration  of  the\nProgram.\n\n\f33\n\nX.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of ADB\n\n136.\nand recommend that the Board approve:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nthe loan of $200,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to the Republic of\nIndonesia  for  the  Industrial  Competitiveness  and  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise\nDevelopment Program, with a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years,\nand  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  pool-based  variable\nlending  rate  system  for  US  dollar  loans,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as\nare  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement\npresented to the Board;\nthe provision of technical assistance in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of\n$1,500,000  to  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  Promoting\nDeregulation and Competition; and\nthe provision of technical assistance in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of\n$2,000,000 to the Government of the Republic of Indonesia for Small and Medium\nEnterprise Development.\n\n22 February 2000\n\nTADAO CHINO\nPresident\n\n\f34\n\nAPPENDIXES\n\nNumber\n\nTitle\n\nPage\n\nCited on\n(page, para.)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nDevelopment Policy Letter\nand Policy Matrix\n\nProgram Framework\n\nPoverty Impact Assessment\n\nIneligible Items\n\nRequired Licenses to Operate a Trading Business\n\nTerms of Reference for Technical Assistance for Promoting\nDeregulation and Competition\n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan for Technical\nAssistance for Promoting Deregulation and Competition\n\nTerms of Reference for Technical Assistance for Small and\nMedium Enterprise Development\n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan for Technical\nAssistance for Small and Medium Enterprise Development\n\n35\n\n48\n\n51\n\n54\n\n65\n\n66\n\n69\n\n70\n\n74\n\n2, 8\n\n2, 8\n\n11, 45\n\n26, 108\n\n28, 114\n\n29, 120\n\n29, 121\n\n30, 124\n\n30, 125\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIX\n(available on request)\n\n1\n\n2\n\nTechnical Assistance for Promoting Deregulation and Competition\n\nTechnical Assistance for Small and Medium Enterprise Development\n\n\f\f\f\f\fPOLICY MATRIX\n\nProgram Goal:\nProgram Objective: \n\nTo promote higher and sustained economic growth based on more efficient resource allocation.\nTo  achieve  economic  recovery  by  encouraging  a  more  diversified  and  efficient  industrial  structure  through  deregulation  and  adoption  of\npolicies that promote competition and provide a level playing field for all enterprises including small and medium enterprises (SMEs).

Modern markets are defined in the Ministry of Industry and Trade\u2019s (MOIT) decree\nNo. 420/MPP/Kep/10/1997  to include plazas, malls, shopping centers, department stores, and\nsupermarkets  with  at  least  2000  meters  of  floor  space.  To  operate  a  modern  market,  the\ncompany must obtain a modern market license (izin usaha pasar modern or IUPM), while other\ntraders must obtain a trading license (surat izin usaha pasar or SIUP) from (MOIT).\n\n2.\nThe  modern  market  retailer  must  first  apply  for  a  modern  market  license  from  the\ndirector  of  domestic  trade  at  MOIT.  The  granting  of  the  trade  license  is  conditional  upon\nobtaining many of the other licenses, permits, and/or letters listed below, including the Ministry\nof Cooperatives and Small-Scale Enterprise Development (MOCSED) approval of the retailer\u2019s\nSmall  and  medium  enterprise  partnership  program  (MOIT  decree  no.  107/MPP/Kep/2/1998).\nUnder  decree  No.  420/MPP/Keps/10/1997,  the  modern  market  retailer  must  submit  an  SME\npartnership program (known as program kemitraan usaha kecil) to the MOC for approval.\n\n3.\nApproval Letters. Letters of approval to operate a modern market in a region must be\nobtained from the regional office of MOIT, the provincial governor, and the city major or county\nhead.\n\n4.\nLocation Licenses. A location license (or izin lokasi) is required from the national land\nagency,  and  a  domicile  license  (or  izin  tempat  usuaha)  is  required  from  the  district  office.

The importance of SMEs\nin  terms  of  labor  absorption  relative  to  its  contribution  to  value  added  indicates  the  need  for\nenhancing the sector efficiency. Although no aggregate gender-based statistics exist for percent\nfemale ownership and management of SMEs, it is generally agreed that women are represented\nin  large  numbers  as  owners  and  managers,  as  well  as  workers.  SMEs,  rather  than  big\nenterprises, are the primary buyers of goods and services from the poor, and the vitality of the\nSME  sector  is  essential  for  poverty  reduction.  The  Program  addresses  some  of  the  major\nrequirements  for  SME  growth  and  development:  (i) strengthening  competition,  (ii)  investment\npromotion and trade facilitation, and (iii) promotion of SMEs.\n\nThe  Poverty  Impact  Assessment  matrices  are  presented  here  together  with  a  more\n\n2.\ndetailed discussion of the key conditionalities of the Program.\n\n1. \n\nPolicy  Area \nenvironment to promote entry, exit, and resource mobility\n\nIA:  Strengthening  competition:  Strengthen \n\nthe \n\nlegal\n\n3.\nPassage  of  a  competition/antimonopoly  law  is  required  to  create  a  healthy  competitive\nmarket  by  ending  the  sanction  of  monopolies,  monopsonies,  market  control,  and  collaboration\namong business players that can result in unfair competition. An uncompetitive market results in\nhigher prices and restricted business and employment opportunities, and provides opportunities\nfor  rent  seeking.  The  law  prevents  big  businesses  from  using  their  position  to  hinder  small\nbusinesses. A fair business practice law limits vertical integration and market share, but must be\nsufficiently  flexible  to  accommodate  natural  monopolies  such  as  water  supply  and  to  avoid\npenalizing  efficient  businesses.  For  this  reason  an  independent  commission  is  required  to\ndetermine whether a company is engaged in a monopoly or not. Proper implementation of the\nlaw requires technical competence, integrity, and autonomy of members of the commission, and\ndetailed and unambiguous implementing regulations.\n\n4.\nAs  a  well-functioning  market  allows  smooth  exit  as  well  as  entry  of  companies,\na bankruptcy law is essential to protect debtors from nuisance petitions, to protect creditors from\ndeterioration of assets when there is no hope for the successful operation of the company, and\nto ensure an equitable formal distribution to creditors. Under a bankruptcy law, employees are\nconsidered  as  creditors  and  their  interest  in  back  wages  and  severance  pay  is  protected.\nA bankruptcy court is required to review the bankruptcy plan of the debtor or creditors to ensure\nthat  is  fair,  equitable,  and  feasible.  An  effective  and  just  insolvency  law  can  contribute  to\ninvestor confidence and accelerate resolution of private sector debt. This will help to revitalize\nthe  economy.  Mechanisms  for  voluntary  restructuring,  debt  resolution,  and  debt-equity\nconversions  by  holding  companies  promotes  exit  and  improves  resource  mobility  as  an\nalternative to liquidation thus enabling otherwise viable business concerns to continue.\n\n2. \n\nPolicy Area IB: Simplify and improve the regulatory framework across the\nindustry sector\n\n5.\nIt is commonly agreed that the regulatory burden is one of the main impediments to SME\ndevelopment, particularly during this time of crisis when many small businesses are on the brink\nof  closure.  The  efficiency  of  the  SME  sector  is  undermined  by  a  cumbersome  and  complex\nlicensing  system  and  by  other  regulations  restricting  domestic  trade.  These  contribute  to  the\nhigh  cost  environment  in  which  Indonesian  business  must  operate  and  fall  most  heavily  on\nSMEs.  A  trading  firm,  for  example,  would  need  to  obtain  46  licenses  from  various  levels  of\ngovernment. The cost and hidden cost of compliance can amount to 2 percent of gross sales for\n\n\f55\n\nAppendix 4, page 2\n\nlarge firms and 3 to 5 percent for small and medium-sized trading firms.1 Microenterprises are\nalso  burdened  by  such  regulation,  in  principle,  a  traditional  fishing  boat  would  require\n30 licenses before putting out to sea. The cost of formal or informal compliance with trade and\nlicensing  regulations  is  a  major  business  cost  for  SMEs.  Removing  these  impediments  would\nincrease  SME  competitiveness  and  reduce  the  uncertainty  caused  by  bureaucratic  interest  in\ntheir affairs.\n\n3. \n\nPolicy Area IC: Promote domestic competition by removing price and entry\nbarriers to domestic trade and distribution\n\na. \n\nPolicy  Area \nefficiency of fertilizer supply and distribution to farmers.\n\nIC1:  Eliminate  producer  subsidies  and \n\nimprove\n\n6.\nThe present system of subsidizing the production of fertilizer obscures the amount of the\nsubsidy and creates disincentives for production efficiency. At times price controls have acted to\nthe disadvantage of farmers, as supplies of fertilizer have tended to dry up when fertilizer prices\nwere  below  border  prices.  The  Indonesian  farmer  is  well  aware  of  the  benefits  of  fertilizer  to\nproduction and the gradual lifting of subsidized inputs over the 1980s did not result in a drop of\ndemand.  Domestic  rice  prices  are  on  par  with  world  market  prices,  and  actual  fertilizer  prices\npaid  by  farmers  indicate  that  the  subsidy  provided  has  been  captured  within  the  distribution\nsystem.  The  use  of  price  controls  to  maintain  below  world  market  prices  has  resulted  in\nunofficial exports and domestic shortages. Finally removing the monopoly over distribution will\nlead  to  more  efficient  and  timely  distribution  of  fertilizer  to  farmers.  To  avoid  disruption  to  the\nprovision  of  fertilizer,  completion  of  these  actions  has  been  set  for  after  the  main  planting\nseason.\n\nb.\n\nPolicy Area IC2. Revoke the decrees issued in April 1998 that restrict\nforeign investment in selected sectors, equity, and location\n\nthe \n\ninfant \n\ninward-looking \n\nimport-substitution, \n\nindustry  protection, \n\n7.\nThis  policy  area  (IC2)  revokes  the  Investment  Coordination  Board  (BKPM)  decree\nrestricting foreign investment in terms of sectors, equity, and location. The decree has its roots\nin \nforeign  exchange\nconservation policies of the late 1970s and early 1980s as well as distrust of market forces. The\nargument  was  that  limiting  foreign  investment  in  all  but  the  strongest  and  largest  industries\nprotected Indonesian businesses from unfair competition. The Government attempted to replace\nthe  flow  of  information  and  technology  to  small  firms  that  would  have  resulted  from  foreign\nbusiness  linkages  with  Government-sponsored  training  and  marketing  support.  A  similar\nargument  was  used  to  protect  small  traditional  traders  from  modern  retailers  by  posing\nrestrictions  on  the  location  of  modern  supermarkets,  by  preventing  combining  wholesale  and\nretail  activities,  as  well  as  by  dictating  business  linkages.  Mistrust  of  market  forces  has  led  to\npolicies  attempting  to  prevent  large  businesses  from  competing  with  small  businesses  while\nmandating relationships between them.\n\n8.\nThese policies fail to recognize the benefits to trade and of the free flow of information\nand  technology.  By  limiting  foreign  investment  to  large  investments,  and  then  under  highly\nrestrictive circumstances, only particular industries have been able to benefit. Other sectors, the\ngarment,  furniture,  and  silver  industries  in  particular,  have  failed  to  develop  to  their  potential\nbecause  of  restrictions  on  foreign-domestic  business  linkages.  At  present  a  foreign  buyer  is\nconsidered a foreign investor and must meet all foreign investment requirements to open a local\n\n                                                \n1 TA  2705-INO:  Trade and Industry Planning and Industry Formulation for Repelita VII,  for  $860,000,  approved  on\n\n16 December 1996.\n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 4, page 3\n\noffice. Yet these sectors would benefit from partnerships with small foreign businesses providing\nmainly market information and market linkages.\n\n4. \n\nPolicy Area ID: Strengthen international competition by reducing tariff and\nnontariff barriers\n\na. \n\nPolicy  area  ID1.  Increase  international  competition  and  improve\nefficiency in trade and industry sectors by reducing the distortion in\nthe antiexport bias due to high and variable import tariffs\n\n9.\nThis  policy  seeks  to  accelerate  proposed  tariff  reductions  under  the  World  Trade\nOrganization\u2019s  agreement  and  explicit  outlines  the  steps  required  to  reaching  this  goal.  High\nimport  taxes  increase  the  cost  of  goods  produced  for  the  domestic  market  and  reduce  the\ncompetitiveness of most export commodities. As the current foreign exchange regime provides\nmarket-based  protection  to  domestic  industries  against  imports,  acceleration  of  tariff  reduction\nminimizes  any  potential  negative  impact  of  increased  foreign  competition  while  lowering  input\ncosts for domestic industries stimulating growth and employment.\n\nb. \n\nPolicy  area  ID2,  3  and  4:  Strengthening  competition:  (ID2)  Remove\nthe  Agency  for  National  Logistics  (BULOG)  Import  Monopoly,  (ID3)\nReduce  the  list  of  importer-producer  (IP)  and  importer-trader  (IT)\nlicenses and (ID4) Government to liberalize all IP and IT licenses\n\n10.\nThis policy is aimed at speeding up the process of reducing non-tariff barriers (NTBs) to\ninternational trade such as import licensing and quantitative restrictions. With the development\nof a private and competitive network of traders throughout the archipelago, BULOG is no longer\nneeded  to  secure  the  supply  of  basic  food  commodities  such  as  rice.  While  BULOG  will\ncontinue to play a role in providing national food security, it no longer needs to do so by acting\nas  sole  importer.  NTBs  were  heavily  used  during  the  late  1970s  and  early  1980s  as  part  of  a\ndevelopment  strategy  that  sought  to  conserve  foreign  exchange  and  provide  stimulus  to\ndomestic  industries.  While  the  Indonesian  development  strategy  has  since  turned  outward\ntoward  a  trade-oriented  global  market,  NTBs  are  no  longer  an  appropriate  part  of  its\ndevelopment  strategy  and,  instead,  enable  rent  collection  by  companies  holding  sole  or\nrestricted  licenses  and  undue  protection  to  particular  industries.  While  prior  to  the  crisis  there\nmight have been a concern that some industries may be adversely affected by competition from\nimports,  this  concern  should  be  mitigated  by  the  natural  protection  offered  these  industries  by\nthe fall of the rupiah. NTBs on basic food stuffs such as sugar, garlic, and soybeans and other\nitems  such  as  plastics  result  in  higher  consumer  prices.  The  large  number  of  NTBs  on\nintermediate manufacturing goods also increases production costs, affects the competitiveness\nof downstream industry, and reduces opportunities for growth and employment. This effect will\nbe  removed  by  the  conversion  of  IP  and  IT  licenses  into  transparent  and  nondiscriminatory\ninstruments such as general licenses, or conversion into duties or excise taxes thus removing\nrent-seeking opportunities. Licenses required for environmental or health considerations will be\nmade more transparent.\n\n5. \n\nPolicy area IIA: Improve investment policy framework and practice\n\n11.\nThe  underlying  legal  framework  for  Indonesian  foreign  investment  policies  is  the  view\nthat the function of foreign investment was to supplement domestic investment and was to be\nphased down over time to balance the need for capital against the threat of foreign domination.\nThis  has  resulted  in  policies  that  have  rationed  foreign  investment  opportunities  by  sector,\nlocation, and size of investment. In addition, the implementation of foreign investment screening\nand  approvals  has  been  subject  to  complex  and  somewhat  uncertain  procedures  including\n\n\f57\n\nAppendix 4, page 4\n\ngranting of tax holidays. The net effect has been to reduce Indonesia\u2019s attractiveness to quality\nforeign  investment  and  cluster  investment  in  capital  intensive  industries  and  those  enjoying\nsome  degree  of  protection.  Limits  on  the  duration  of  foreign  investment  licenses  have  had  a\nnegative  impact  on  investors\u2019  decisions  regarding  upgrading  of  technology,  decreasing\nopportunities for workers to learn new skills. Redirecting the Investment Board from a regulatory\nbody allocating investment opportunities to an investment facilitation role will encourage foreign\ninvestment  and  reduce  rent-seeking  activities.  Reorienting  investment  policies  and  opening\nforeign  investment  in  almost  all  economic  sectors  will  produce  benefits  beyond  capital\nmobilization  to  include  access  and  exposure  to  improved  technology,  business  skills,  and\nopportunities  to  SMEs  that  have  been  shut  out  of  foreign  investment,  thus  restricting  their\naccess to capital, technology, and markets. Mandated business partnerships between small and\nlarge  enterprises  that  have  been  in  place  since  the  late  1970s  have  failed  to  bring  about  a\ndeepening  of  linkages  between  large  and  small  industries.  While  some  large  industries  have\ntaken on a social mission to develop small industries, many others put off by the rigidities of the\nsystem have preferred to adopt an arm\u2019s length relationship. Others have been able to exploit\nopportunities  provided  to  small  firms  by  setting  up  their  own  small  establishments.  These\narrangements have done little to promote healthy business links between large and small firms\nand may, in fact, be counterproductive to the development of these relationships.\n\n6. \n\nPolicy  area  IIB:  Streamline  duty  drawback  procedures  and  improve\ntransparency\n\n12.\nThis  policy  is  intended  to  improve  the  efficiency  with  which  exemptions  or  rebates  on\nimport  duties  are  provided  to  manufacturers  of  exported  goods.  The  draw-back  facility  serves\nindirect exporters, generally SMEs that have subcontracting arrangements with large exporters.\nEstablishing  a  timetable  for  tariff  reduction  consistent  with  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian\nNations  tariff  reduction  agreements  ensures  the  facility  is  available  to  the  extent  that  it  is\nneeded.\n\n7. \n\nPolicy  area  IIC:  Investment  Promotion  and  Trade  Facilitation:  Facilitate\ntrade through improved customs procedures\n\nThe  liberalization  of  the  foreign  trade  regime  has  not  been  matched  by  institutional\n13.\nstrengthening  of  the  customs  and  port  systems.  These  functions  had  been  devolved  to  the\nSociete Generale de Surveillance (SGS) for 10 years prior to 1997 for preshipment inspections.\nIn  April  1997,  Customs  control  reverted  to  Indonesian  authorities.  The  SGS  arrangement  was\nsuccessful in raising import tax revenues. However, no provisions for transfer of technology or\ndevelopment  of  customs  systems  were  made.  At  the  end  of  10  years,  Customs  was  left  with\nantiquated  systems,  no  experience  in  import  valuation,  and  poor  import  tracking  capability.\nReversion  to  Indonesian  based  customs  has  resulted  in  delays  and  additional  costs  to\nimporters, and delays in servicing and clearance has put heavy pressure on port areas. Import\nclearance time has increased from nearly two days to nearly two weeks, which places an undue\nburden on importers and affects the efficiency of industries that depend on trade. There are few\neconomic activities that do not rely on some import component in their operations. Creating an\nefficient customs and port authority system is therefore critical for expanding international trade\nwhich in turn will create demand for goods and services, and increase the opportunities for the\npoor.\n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 4, page 5\n\n8. \n\nPolicy  area  IIIA:  Broaden  participation  of  SMEs  in  policy  making  and\nimplementation, \ninteragency  coordination,  and  broaden\nparticipation of SMEs in policy making and implementation processes.\n\nimprove \n\n14.\nThe Government system for improving SME technology and human resources requires\noverhaul.  The  National  SME  Policy  Workshop  held  in  December  1999  at  Jakarta  identified\nseveral constraints that are addressed under this policy area. There is a great deal of overlap in\nthe support provided by various technical Government agencies, (the Ministries of Industry and\nTrade,  Cooperatives  and  SMEs,  Manpower,  Agriculture,  and  Home  Affairs,  and  the  Family\nPlanning  Agency)  all  of  which  have  their  own  SME  support  program.  Better  coordination  is\nneeded as well as a system for integrating SME needs into policy decision making. Government\nprograms  promote  technology  and  skills  based  on  a  top  down  assessment  of  SME  needs.\nThere is no system for incorporating SME inputs in policy making and implementation of support\nto SMEs, with the result that the policies are sometimes inconsistent such as promoting the use\nof particular imported technologies while imposing heavy import taxes.\n\n9. \n\nPolicy Area IIIB: Improve efficiency of financial intermediation\n\n15.\nDirected  subsidized  credit  lending  schemes  have  been  a  source  of  frustration  as\nchanneling  banks  bear  responsibility  for  loan  repayment,  borrowers  experience  hidden  costs\nand delays in accessing the credit, and prospective borrowers perceive that access to credit has\nbeen captured by better connected borrowers. Directed credit schemes have been plagued by\npoor  repayment  performance  linked  to  rent-seeking  opportunities  by  banking  and  Government\nofficials and other credit delivery problems. As a result some borrowers were unable or did not\nfeel obligated to repay. Responsibility for loan repayment and lack of familiarity of the bank with\nthe intended beneficiary group has contributed to the capture of directed credit by non-intended\nbeneficiaries  known  to  the  bank.  While  directed  credit  may  continue  to  serve  as  an  important\npolicy  tool  for  the  Government,  its  channeling  terms  and  availability  must  be  clear,  and\nusefulness  demonstrated.  The  number  of  schemes  should  be  streamlined  and  terms  and\nconditions  standardized  and  known.  It  is  important  to  reduce  the  incentives  for  rent-seeking\nbehavior  or  capture  by  other  consumer  groups.  For  this  reason  the  gap  between  the  rate  for\nsubsidized  lending  and  commercial  lending  should  be  narrowed  and  appropriate  risk-sharing\nincentives  established  as  this  will  reduce  the  scope  for  informal  charges,  the  incentives  for\ndiversion of lending to other borrowers, and improve the effectiveness of targeting and delivery.\nNarrowing  the  gap  requires  establishing  an  appropriate  benchmark  to  avoid  inflation  of\noutstanding  debt  obligations.  In  addition,  a  transparent  mechanism  for  assessing  subsidies  is\nrequired  to  allocate  resources  and  subsidies  across  sectors  and  to  ensure  appropriate\nbudgetary allocation.  Bringing SME  credit into the budget and the use of public audit will help\nensure that funds are used in an accountable fashion and that policymakers are able to assess\ntrade-offs and optimal levels of funding.\n\n16.\nThe  need  to  improve  access  to  capital  and  the  problem  of  the  high  cost  of  capital  has\nlong been recognized by the Government as an impediment to the growth of SMEs. Most SME\nStakeholders  agree  that  they  are  constrained  by  low  access  to  information  and  services  from\nfinancial institutions, complicated and unclear procedures, and high interest rates. There is now\na  gap  between  the  SMEs  seeking  credit  and  the  financial  institutions  that  would  like  to  serve\nthem.  Policies  to  improve  the  operations  of  small  business  programs  and  encourage  the\nextension of successful programs will help close this gap. The Government should encourage\nthe  development  of  institutions  that  specialize  in  SMEs.  The  unintended  consequence  of  the\nCredit for Small Enterprises lending requirement of all commercial banks is that some financial\ninstitutions have been forced to lend in areas where they lacked advantage and expertise. The\nresulting  difficulty  in  delivering  expected  services  has  contributed  to  the  perception  of  low\n\n\f59\n\nAppendix 4, page 6\n\naccess to financial services. As Bank Rakyat Indonesia has been successful in demonstrating\nthat  rural  banking  and  small  business  credit  programs  can  be  profitable,  it  should  be\nencouraged to build on this strength and to serve as a model for other commercial institutions\nseeking to specialize in SME lending.\n\n10. \n\nPolicy  area  IIIC:  Promotion  of  SMEs:  Promote  commercially  oriented\ntechnical and business support for SMEs\n\nA review is needed of the existing SME programs to reduce the overlap and duplication\n17.\nin the support provided by various technical Government agencies. Training plans are based on\ntop  down  perceptions  of  required  skills  rather  than  beneficiary  demand.  Outreach  is  poor.\nTraining and support are to be provided to businesses already under departmental guidance or\nthat are already successful. Technical and business support activities should be commercialized\nto  ensure  these  activities  are  demand  driven.2  This  does  not  imply  that  100  percent  cost\nrecovery  is  required  but  there  should  be  some  contribution  on  the  part  of  recipients  who  are\nexpected to profit from the services. Increasing beneficiary contributions enable the Government\nto stretch tight development resources and to extend their outreach, particularly outside of Java\nwhere the less developed communications network increases the cost of service delivery. SMEs\nhave indicated their interest in expanding technical service centers3 to smaller industrial centers.\nThe  Government  should  avoid  competing  with  private  sector  resources  and  should  take\nadvantage  of  private  sector  capacity  to  deliver  support  services.  Where  possible  the\nGovernment  should  commercialize  and  privatize  existing  ownership  in  technical  and  business\nsupport activities.\n\n                                                \n2  If business is willing to pay for services, their relevance is assured.\n3  Proceedings of the National SME Policy Workshop; December 8-9, 1999, Jakarta.\n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 4, page 7\n\nPolicy Area IA:\nStrengthening Competition:\nStrengthen the legal environment to promote entry, exit, and resource mobility\n\nAccess for Poor\n\nDirect\n\nMacro\n\nIndirect\nMore opportunities to\nprovide goods and\nservices\n\nEmployee wages are\nprotected under\nbankruptcy laws\n\nNon-Poor\nMore opportunities to\nprovide goods and\nservices\n\nCreditors assets are\nprotected through\nreorganization or can\nrecover part of their\nassets for new\nproductive investment\nthrough liquidation\nLower prices\n\nPrices\nCrucial\nAssumptions:\n\nNet Impact:\nNarrative:\n\nLower prices\n\nCompetition creates business opportunities and lowers consumer prices.\nMembers independent commission are independent, honest, and technically competent.\nCommercial courts judges understand modern bankruptcy laws financial concepts.\nCommercial courts can implement favorable liquidations (i.e., no fire sales).\nIndirect, positive\nStrengthening  the  legal  framework  to  promote  competition  enhances  market  access,  market\nefficiency,  and  greater  employment  opportunities.
