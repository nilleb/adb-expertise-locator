The  project  will  demonstrate  the  efficiency  and \nviability  of  large-scale  natural  gas  and  wind-based  district  heating  in  IMAR.  Combining  these \ntwo energy sources will improve the poor air  quality in urban areas of  IMAR during the winter \nand help reduce carbon dioxide  emissions.2\n \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nIMAR is located in a severe cold climate zone of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), \nwhere  winter  temperatures  can  drop  to  as  low  as  \u201340\u00b0C  and  subzero  temperatures  typically \nlast for 6 months of the year. Thus, adequate heating is a basic human need and essential  for \nsocioeconomic activities. Coal has been the predominant fuel for heating in IMAR, contributing \nto  indoor  and  outdoor  air  pollution  and  undermining  human  health.  A  district  heating  system \nwith  a  centralized  plant  and  a  network  of  distribution  pipes  to  provide  space  heating  and  hot \nwater  is  one  of  the  most  energy-efficient  and  least-polluting  heating  modes  in  urban  areas. \nSuch a system allows heat sources to be located away from densely populated areas and has \nthe  flexibility  to  use  a  wide  range  of  energy  sources.  As  rapid  urbanization  increases  the \ndemand for heating, heavy use of coal-based district heating will worsen air quality, especially \nin large urban areas such as Hohhot. Switching  to a low-emission fossil fuel, such as natural \ngas, and emission-free renewable energy is urgently needed. \n \n4. \nHohhot has the highest concentration of urban residents in IMAR. About 10% of IMAR\u2019s \ntotal  population  resides  in  the  city.  As  urbanization  and  population  growth  increase  heating \ndemand,  Hohhot  faces  critical  gaps  in  its  heating  infrastructure.  As  of  2013,  district  heating \ncovered  only  86.8  million  square  meters  (m2)  of  floor  area;  existing  isolated,  decrepit,  and \ninefficient  heating systems for an additional 42.0 million m2 of floor area need to be replaced. \nThe hazy skies above Hohhot already have a high concentration of inhalable particulate matter \nduring  winter.3 Through  a  decree  issued  in  2013,  the  Hohhot  municipal  government  (HMG) \npromoted the use of natural gas to meet the growing energy  demand and address associated \nenvironmental  and  health  concerns.  The  decree  includes  (i)  a  natural  gas  subsidy  for \nresidential  heating, and (ii) financial support to  heating operators  that replace small coal-fired \nneighborhood boilers with natural gas boilers in central business districts . Compared with coal, \nnatural  gas  emits  half  as  much  carbon  dioxide,  a  fraction  of  particulate  matter  and  nitrogen \noxides  (NOX),  and  negligible  sulfur  oxides.  Since  the  decree  was  issued,  HMG  has  provided \nCNY230  million  in  subsidies  for  natural  gas  use  and  switching  from coal  to  gas  boilers.  The \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.  ADB.  2013.  Technical \nAssistance  to  the  People's  Repub lic  of  China  for  Preparing  Low  Carbon  District  Heating  in  Hohhot  in  Inner \nMongolia Autonomous Region Project. Manila. \n\n3  Inhalable particulate matter refers to particulate matter  less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM2.5). In January \n2014, Hohhot recorded 81\u201395 micrograms per cubic meter (m 3) of daily PM2.5, more than three times higher than \nthe 25 micrograms per m 3 recommended by the World Health Organization. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nHMG  policy to promote natural gas in  district heating is aligned with the central government\u2019s \n2013  Air  Pollution  Prevention  Act,  which  requires  all  prefecture-level  cities  like  Hohhot  to \nreduce inhalable  particulate matter by 10% in 2017 compared with 2012 levels. \n \nIMAR  is  a  resource-rich  province.  In  addition  to  being  the  PRC\u2019s  top  coal-producing \n5. \nprovince, 4 IMAR  has  large  reserves  of  natural  gas 5  and  excellent  solar  and  wind  energy \nresources. In 2013, IMAR reached 18 gigawatts of installed wind power capacity, equivalent to \n25% of the total installed wind power capacity in the PRC. The Government of IMAR (GIMAR) \nplans  to  increase  installed  wind  capacity  up  to  50  gigawatts  by  2020.  IMAR  prioritizes \ncombined  heat  and  power  plants  to  meet  the  electricity  and  heat  demand,  rather  than \nelectricity-only wind power plants. As a result, many wind farms are forced to disconnect from \nthe  grid,  particularly  at  night  during  the  winter  when  power  demand  is  low  but  wind  power \ngeneration  is high.  In 2013, about 11.3 terawatt-hours of wind power generation was curtailed \nin IMAR.   \n \n6. \nThe National Energy  Administration in  the PRC issued a policy notice in 2013 strongly \nencouraging the use of curtailed wind power for district heating, which requires high energy use \nat night during the winter. Both the GIMAR and HMG are keen to pilot the use of curtailed wind \npower  for  district  heating,  taking  into  consideration  that  the  current  curtailed  wind  power  in \nIMAR could meet the heating demand up to about 100 million m 2 of floor area and contribute to \nbetter  air  quality  in  the  winter  by  eliminating  hazardous  emissions  from  coal-based  heating \nsystems.  Yet,  IMAR  currently  does  not  have  a  business  model  for  using  the  curtailed  wind \nenergy  for  district  heating  and  needs  to  gain  more  insights  into  the  technical  and  economic \nchallenges before wider deployment. The proposed project will demonstrate a large-scale low-\nemission and low-carbon district heating system using wind power and natural gas. Because of \nits  easy  access  to  sufficient  natural  gas  and  excess  wind  power,  Hohhot  is  an  appropriate \nchoice  to  demonstrate  such  heating  system.  If  successful,  it  can  be  replicated  in  IMAR  and \nelsewhere in the PRC\u2019s northern provinces. \n \n7. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  supported  two  other  projects  in  IMAR  to \nprovide  energy-efficient  district  heating. 6 The  Hohhot  project  is  a  logical  next  step  to  improve \nenergy  efficiency  and  reduce  emissions  from  such  projects  through  advanced  natural  gas \nboiler technology. The project will also pilot a new business model [This information has been \nremoved  as  it  falls  within  exceptions  to  disclosure  specified  in  paragraph  97,  (v)  of  ADB\u2019s \nPublic Communications Policy (2011)]. The project is closely aligned with the  Midterm Review \nof Strategy 2020, which identifies environmentally sustainable growth as a priority  for helping \ndeveloping  member  countries  move  onto  a  low-carbon  growth  path  by  improving  energy \nefficiency  and  expanding  renewable  energy. 7 The  project  also  supports  the  goal  of  ADB\u2019s \nEnergy Policy, which prioritizes energy efficiency and access to energy for all, including district \n\n                                                 \n4  IMAR is the top coal-producing province, followed by Shanxi and Shaanxi. IMAR  produced 1,062 million tons in \n\n2012, accounting for 30% of the PRC\u2019s total coal production (3,549 million tons). \n\n5  IMAR has about 834.4 billion m 3 of natural gas, equivalent to 19% of the total natural gas reserves in the PRC. \nAccording to the Statistics Bureau of the PRC, the proven natural gas reserves in the PRC total 4.4 trillion m 3. \n6  ADB.  2006.

The \noutcome  will  be  improved  air  quality  and  reduced  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  Hohhot.  The \noutputs will be (i) district heating coverage  expanded, (ii)  low-carbon and highly efficient heat-\ngeneration  system  installed,  and  (iii)  a  new  business  model  for  wind-based  district  heating \npiloted. \n \n9. \nThe  project  will  install  (i)  low-emission  natural  gas  boilers,  (ii)  wind-powered  electric \nboilers with zero emissions, (iii) energy-efficient heat exchange stations, (iv) insulated heating \npipelines,  and  (v)  a  distribution  control  and  data  management  system  to  optimize  system \noperation.  The  project  covers  three  heating  zones  (Jinqiao,  Xinjiaying,  and  Haoqingying)  in \nSaihan and Xincheng districts in the eastern part of Hohhot. About 61,000 households in these \nareas  are  currently  connected  to  50 small  and  inefficient  coal-fired  boilers  (equivalent  to  158 \nmegawatts  thermal),  and  more  than  210,500  households  are  using  coal-fired  heating  stoves \nwithout any emission control. After completion, the project will avoid 848,500 tons of standard \ncoal, and will emit 60%  less carbon dioxide, 82%  less NOX, negligible particulate matters, and \n98%  less  sulfur  dioxide  compared  with  the  existing  heating  supply.  The  project  will  achieve \nenergy  efficiency  of  0.5  gigajoule/m 2,  which  is  17%  more  efficient  than  the  average  IMAR \ndistrict  heating  system.10 Table  1  summarizes  the  project\u2019s  key  features  in  the  three  heating \nzones. \n \n\nTable 1: Key Features and Heating Zones of the Project \n\n \n\nJinqiao \n\nXinjiaying \n\nHaoqingying \n\nNatural Gas  Natural Gas  Natural Gas  Wind Powera \n\nItem \nHeating areas \nHeat source capacity \nHeating pipe network \nHeat exchange stations  \nm 2 = square meter, MWt  = megawatt thermal, km = kilometer. \na  Wind-powered  electric  boilers  are  piloted  only  in  the  Haoqingying  heating  zone  because  the  availability  of  a \n\n  9.5 \n490 \n17.1 \n45 \n\n  8.8 \n490 \n26.0 \n48 \n\n10.4 \n580 \n\n30.7 \n87b \n\n1.0 \n50 \n\n \n\nHeating Zone \nUnit \nmillion m 2 \nMWt \nkm \nset \n\n \nTotal \n29.7 \n1,610 \n73.8 \n180 \n\nsuitable power transmission line for electric boilers makes incremental costs lower. \n\nb  Eleven out of 87 are building-level heat exchange stations , which are more energy efficient. \nSources:  Domestic  feasibility  study  reports   commissioned  by  from  Hohhot  City  Development,  Investment,  and \nOperation Company (2012). \n \n10. \nThe  new  business  model  for  district  heating  benefits  three  key  stakeholders\u2014wind \nfarms,  the  district  heating  company,  and  the  grid  company. 11 [This  information  has  been \nremoved  as  it  falls  within  exceptions  to  disclosure  specified  in  paragraph  97,  (v)  of  ADB\u2019s \nPublic  Communications  Policy  (2011)],  the  new  business model  will  enable  (i)  wind  farms  to \nsell surplus wind energy for district heating, (ii) the heating company to buy wind energy at an \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2009.

The business \nmodel enables the heating company to  purchase wind energy at an affordable cost of [This information has been \nremoved as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in paragraph 97, (v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications \nPolicy (2011)]. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\faffordable  cost,  and  (iii)  the  grid  company  to  cover  wheeling  charges  for  transmitting  the \nadditional  wind  power.  This  business  model  will  benefit  IMAR  environmentally,  socially,  and \neconomically by improving air quality, reducing health risks, and using surplus wind power that \nwould  otherwise  have  been  wasted.  The  successful  demonstration  of  this  business model  in \nHohhot  will  provide  lessons  and  guidance  to  other  major  cities  in  IMAR  and  other  northern \nprovinces  that  might  want  to  replicate  this  approach  because  of  similar  conditions.  The \nsuccessful  demonstration  is  also  expected  to  lead  to  a  new  policy  promoting  wind  power \nutilization for heating  in northern PRC, thereby reducing curtailment of abundant wind power. \n \nC. \n \n11. \ncost will finance civil works, 54.4% for equipment and 0.2% for consulting services. \n \n\nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $403.1  million  (Table  2),  of  which  27.4%  of  the  base \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nTable 2: Project Investment Plan \n\nAmount  ($ million)a \n\nJinqiao heating zone \nXinjiaying heating zone \nHaoqingying heating zone \nConsulting services \nSubtotal (A) \n\nBase Costb \n1.  \n2.  \n3.  \n4.  \n \nContingenciesc \nFinancing  Charges During  Implementationd \n \n\n \nItem \nA. \n \n \n \n \n \nB. \nC. \n \na  Includes taxes and duties of $28.2 million to be financed by the go vernment and the  Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) loan.

HCDIO owns 98.17% of HCHC . \n\n14 Since 2000, HCHC has provided highly efficient district heating services in Hohhot, achieving the energy intensity \nof 0.55 GJ/m 2 per year (the average district heating energy intensity in IMAR is 0.60 GJ/m 2 per year). Its current \ncoverage is 32 million m 2 and is expected to expand the heating coverage to 74 million m 2 by 2016. \n\n15  Terms  of  reference  for  loan  implementation  consultants  are  provided  in  the  Project  Administration  Manual \n\n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n16 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nAspects \n\n(i)   Oversight body \n\n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)   Implementing agency \n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n \nConsulting services \nRetroactive financing and/or \nadvance contracting \n\nDisbursement  \n\nArrangements \nIMAR  Development and Reform Commission, IMAR Region Finance Bureau, \nIMAR  Construction Bureau, and IMAR  Environmental Protection Bureau \nGIMAR \nHohhot Chengfa Heating Company \nProject management office at the Hohhot Chengfa Heating Company, 11 staff \n(including four staff from Hohhot City Development, Investment, and Operation \nCompany) \nNational competitive bidding \n$18.6 million \nInternational competitive bidding \n$130.9 million \n$0.5 million \nIndividual  \nThe GIMAR  has requested advance contracting and retroactive financing.

The  resource  availability,  cost \n\nimplications,  and \n15. \nenvironmental impacts of different heat sources were assessed. While coal is widely available \nat  a  low  cost,  it  was  not  considered  because  of  its  environmental  and  health  impacts. \nGeothermal and biomass resources are not adequate in the project area. Despite good solar \nradiation, solar photovoltaic utilization is low in Hohhot because of its high cost.17 Excess wind \npower  can  be  utilized  for  heating  without  much  additional  investment.  To  gain  experience, \nHCDIO  and  HCHC  decided  to  heat  an  area  of  1.0  million  m2 on  a  pilot  basis  using  curtailed \nwind  power.  Natural  gas  was  assessed  as  the most  suitable  option  for  district  heating  in  the \nproject area because of its superior  environmental performance (para. 4) compared with coal \nand its availability in  IMAR. China Gas (Hohhot) Company, the major  gas supplier in  Hohhot, \nhas confirmed its commitment to supply adequate natural gas to the project.18 \n \nEnergy-efficient  and  low-emission  design.  The  project  design  uses  the  most  cost-\n16. \neffective,  technically  advanced,  energy-efficient,  and  low-emission  technologies  and  features. \nDifferent  boiler  options  for  natural  gas  and  electric  boilers  were  assessed  to  improve  energy \nefficiency and reduce emissions. Key features of the project design are (i) low NO X natural gas \nboilers,  (ii)  high-voltage  and  large  25-megawatt  electric  boilers,  and  (iii)  building-level  heat \nexchange  units.  Compared  with  conventional  natural  gas  boilers,  low  NO X  boilers\u2014a  mature \ntechnology that is widely  used in the PRC\u2014can reduce about 85% of NO X emissions without \naffecting  boiler  efficiency.  Electric  boilers  are  also  a  proven  technology  with  99%  boiler \nefficiency,  quick  response  time  to  operate,  and  low  maintenance  cost.  A  high-voltage,  large-\nscale  electrode  boiler  has  a  competitive  advantage,  as  it  requires  a cheaper  transformer  and \nless space  than  a small,  low-voltage  electric  boiler.  A  high-voltage  large  electrode  boiler  that \n\n                                                 \n17 Despite significant cost reductions, solar power is the most expensive renewable energy technology. The current \n\nsolar photovoltaic tariff is more than double the wind power tariff. \n\n18 Such commitments are often treated as firm long-term gas supply arrangements in the PRC. \n\n \n\n\frequires  less space  to  install  is more  suitable  for  urban  district  heating.  A  building-level  heat \nexchange unit eliminates secondary pipelines and reduces pipe size. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n17. \nEconomic  analysis.  The  economic  benefits  of  district  heating  include  heating \nefficiency  and  environmental  improvements.  The  calculations  reflect  all  project-related  costs \nand net environmental benefits. Additional health benefits from cleaner air were excluded. The \neconomic  analysis  of  the  project  indicates  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of \n18.52%,  which  is  more  than  the  12%  economic  cost  of  capital.  Therefore,  the  project  is \neconomically  viable.  Sensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  the  EIRR  will  decrease  to  (i)  11.72% \nwhen economic benefits decrease by 10%, (ii) 17.00% when capital costs increase by 10%, (iii) \n13.70%  when  O&M  costs  increase  by  10%,  and  (iv)  18.49%  if  project  implementation  is \ndelayed  by  1  year.  The  project\u2019s  economic  viability  is  sensitive  to  changes  in  benefits,  but \nremains robust under all scenarios. If the substantial health benefits were  included,  the  EIRR \nwould improve further under all sensitivity scenarios. \n \n18. \nFinancial  analysis. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is calculated under the \nassumption that both (i) the natural gas subsidy from the HMG and (ii) adequate wind power at \nreduced  tariff  (footnote  11)  will  continue  for  the  life  of  the  project.  Financial  analysis  of  the \nproject indicates that the FIRR is 8.93%, substantially higher than the corresponding weighted \naverage  cost  of capital  (2.48%).  Sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the  FIRR  would  be  (i)  7.96% \nwhen project capital costs increase by 10%, (ii) 2.53% when O&M costs increase by 10%, (iii) \n3.60% if revenues from heat sales decrease by 10%, and (iv) 7.65%  if project implementation \nis delayed by 1 year.  If all the above adverse cases occur at the same time, the project would \nnot be financially viable. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n19. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  shows  that  the  GIMAR  has  (i)  sufficient \nexperience with a number of ADB-financed loan projects, (ii) adequate capacity to manage an \nimprest account, and (iii) a good track record of delivering  ADB-financed projects. HCDIO and \nHCHC have solid financial management systems and procedures in place to guarantee proper \nfinancial  management  and  reporting.  The  accounting  systems  of  HCDIO  and  HCHC  are  also \nadequate  for  implementing  an  ADB  loan.  HCDIO  and  HCHC  have  experience  with  projects \nfinanced  by  other  international  financial  institutions.19 Additional  assessments  of  governance \nrisks indicate low associated risks regarding (i) accounting policies and procedures, (ii) staffing, \n(iii)  reporting  and  monitoring,  (iv)  information  systems,  (v)  internal  auditing,  and  (vi)  external \nauditing. HCHC and HCDIO also have extensive project implementation experience for multiple \ndistrict  heating  projects  at  a  scale  and  scope  similar  to  this  project.  Both  have  consistently \ndemonstrated  timely  and  high-quality  delivery  within  agreed  cost  frameworks.  However,  as \nHCDIO  and  HCHC  have  no  experience  with  ADB-financed  projects,  the  overall  control  risks \nbefore mitigation have been conservatively estimated as medium. \n \nTo  mitigate  these  risks,  HCDIO  and  HCHC  will  strengthen  the  financial  management \n20. \ncapacity by undertaking capacity development training on ADB policies and procedures, and by \nseeking external financial management  assistance as needed.  During the project processing, \n                                                 \n19 They completed two projects funded by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation in 1998 and 2006. The third \nproject  funded  by  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  was  signed  in  March  2012  and  is  being \nimplemented. HCDIO and HCHC recently signed a project loan with German development cooperation through \nKfW. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fADB provided training on disbursement and procurement to PMO that is responsible for project \nmanagement,  including  procurement,  disbursement,  consultant  management,  construction \nsupervision, and all  other tasks relevant to successful project implementation. Core PMO staff \nhave  benefited  from  training  and  will  continue  to  be  trained  on  disbursement,  procurement, \nreporting, and other ADB rules and regulations important for project implementation. \n \n21. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed with the GIMAR, the  HDCIO, and the  HCHC. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 16). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nSocial benefits. The project will generate substantial direct and indirect social gains. It \n22. \nwill  directly  benefit  294,500  households  (30%  of  Hohhot\u2019s  total  population),  of  which  271,500 \nhouseholds  are  currently  connected  to  either  coal-based,  small,  and  inefficient  neighborhood \nboilers  or  coal-fired  household  stoves.  By  income  level,  4.9%  of  the  households  are  poor \n(14,570  households)  and  24.8%  are  in  the  low-income  group.  In  addition,  the  project  will \nbenefit 18 schools with about 12,000 students, 35 kindergartens with about 4,000 children, and \n12  hospitals.  The  project  will  (i)  reduce  the  number  of  cases  involving  people  suffering  from \nrespiratory  diseases  by  improving  indoor  and  outdoor  air  quality;  (ii)  reduce  indoor  carbon \nmonoxide poisoning by providing safer district heating services; (iii) reduce heating expenditure \nby switching from household stoves to centralized energy-efficient heating system; (iv) support \na better medical environment by providing cleaner and reliable heating services to hospitals; (v) \nimprove living conditions through adequate, reliable, and affordable heating services; and (vi) \nsupport  a  better  school  environment  during  winter  by  providing  cleaner  and  reliable  heating \nservices. \n \n23. \nLabor  retrenchment.  The  HMG  will  close  down  50  small,  inefficient  boilers  in  29 \nneighborhood boiler houses and 132 seasonal workers will lose their seasonal jobs working at \nneighborhood  boiler  houses.  The  prepared  labor  retrenchment  and  reemployment  plan  will \nsafeguard  the  livelihoods  of  the  affected  workers.  Skills  training  will  be  provided  to  affected \nworkers, and HCHC is committed to retain them as long as they acquire the required skills. \n \n24. \nGender  impact.  The  project  will  give  about  441,750  women,  including  8,000  female \nstudents, access to cleaner, safer, and more affordable heating services. It will also ensure that \nhalf the 280 permanent positions created by the project will be filled by women. In addition, the \nproject will conduct energy conservation awareness campaigns targeting women and students \nin  collaboration  with  the  local  women\u2019s  federation  at  least  twice  during  the  project \nimplementation period. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n25. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  category  A  for  environment.  A  draft  project \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 12 May 2014. The \nEIA  complies  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  and  requirements,  including  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (2009),  and  identifies  potential  adverse  impacts.  During  construction,  such  risks \nwould  include  (i)  noise,  vibration,  and  dust;  (ii)  solid  waste;  (iii)  community  disturbance  and \npublic  safety;  and  (iv)  occupational  health  and  safety.  During  operation,  potential  adverse \nimpacts would be (i) emissions, (ii) noise, (iii) wastewater from the heat source plants, and (iv) \noccupational  health  and  safety  risks.  The  EIA  concludes  that  those  impacts can  be mitigated \nthrough the implementation  of the environmental management plan, which specifies mitigation \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fmeasures,  monitoring  requirements,  and  institutional  responsibilities  for  ensuring  proper \nenvironmental management throughout the project\u2019s construction and operation. \n \n26. \nInvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples.  The project is classified category \nC for involuntary resettlement and  indigenous peoples. The project does not entail permanent \nland  acquisition.  Installing  the  underground  heating  pipelines  will  temporarily  occupy  the \npublicly  owned  land  (road  and  sidewalks)  for  a  maximum  of  6  months,  which  will  not  cause \ninvoluntary resettlement of people. The project will  not  entail demolition  of any structure. The \nproject  beneficiaries  include  ethnic  minorities.  Thus,  the  project  does  not  have  any  adverse \nimpact on ethnic minority people. \n \nF. \n\nProject Readiness \n\n27. \nThe GIMAR has approved the feasibility study report and the EIA of the project. There \nis  no  pending  safeguard  issue.  The  PMO  was set  up  to manage  the  project  since  May  2014 \n(para 14). The  GIMAR and  HCHC requested advance contracting and retroactive financing to \nproceed with project-related procurement. The GIMAR and HCHC engaged a tendering agency \nin October 2014 to  assist in procurement management.20 The HCDIO and  HCHC will engage \nloan  implementation  consultants  (para  14)  using  advance  contracting  to  further  strengthen \nproject management.  \n \nG. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n28. \nThere are no major outstanding risks. The identified  risks and mitigating measures are \nsummarized  in  Table  5  and  described  in  detail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management \nplan.21 The integrated  benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nTable 5: Summary  of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nFinancial  management \nReduction or removal of \nsubsidies on gas and wind \nwill undermine the financial \nviability of the project. \n\nProcurement \nProject implementation may \nbe delayed because of \nlimited experience in ADB \nprocurement procedures. \n\nOther risks \nReduction in urban air \npollution from the project \n\nMitigating  Measures \n\nThe State Council\u2019s air pollution reduction and control measures have triggered \nwider use of natural gas for district heating. Most of the northern provinces and \ncities have introduced or plan to introduce a subsidy scheme to switch to natural \ngas. The subsidy scheme of the Hohhot municipal government (para. 4) is \nassessed to be a well-funded scheme as IMAR gets large revenues from energy \nresource utilization in the province. \n \nFor the wind subsidy, the business model described in para. 10 is developed \nbased on an agreement signed by all three parties : Datang (Hohhot) New Energy \nCompany; Inner Mongolia Power Grid Company; and HCDIO, which represents \nHCHC. \nHCDIO and HCHC have experience with projects funded by the Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation and German development cooperation through KfW, but \nno ADB project experience. The staff at HCDIO and HCHC received training on \nADB\u2019s procurement and disbursement procedures during project preparation. \nDuring project implementation, their institutional capacity will be strengthened \nfurther. A  tendering agency with extensive experience with ADB procurement \nprocedures is engaged to further supplement the capacity of the project \nmanagement office, which has already been set up. \nThe GIMAR  has taken additional measures to reduce air pollution, including (i) \neliminating small coal-fired boilers in urban areas , (ii) enhancing air pollution \ncontrol measures in key industries , (iii) introducing more stringent fuel standards \n\n                                                 \n20 The  China  Far  East  International  Tendering  Company  has  extensive  procurement  experience,  managing  a \n\nnumber of projects financed by multilateral development banks, including ADB.   \n\n21 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fMitigating  Measures \n\nRisks \nmay be negated by the \nconstruction of additional \npolluting industries in urban \nareas. \nADB =  Asian Development Bank, GIMAR = Go vernment of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region,  HCDIO = Hohhot \nCity Development, In vestment, and Operation Company, HCHC = Hohhot Chengfa Heating Company, IMAR  = Inner \nMongolia Autonomous Region.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nfor vehicles, (iv) promoting more clean energy, (v)  relocating industries and \neliminating outdated polluting plants, (vi) introducing more stringent environmental \nstandards for industry approval, and (vii) enhancing environmental monitoring. \nThus, associated risks are minimal. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nThe Government of the PRC and the GIMAR have assured ADB that implementation of \n29. \nthe  project  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies \nincluding  those  concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the project administration manual and loan  documents. \nThe national government and the GIMAR have agreed with  ADB on certain covenants for  the \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. \n \n30. \nThe  disbursement  is  conditional  upon  the  borrower\u2019s  certification  that  an  onlending \nagreement  between  HCDIO  and  HCHC  will  have  been  duly  executed  and  delivered,  and  all \nconditions precedent to their effectiveness will have been fulfilled. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n31. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$150,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Low-Carbon District Heating Project in \nHohhot  in  Inner  Mongolia  Autonomous  Region,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with \ninterest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased  lending  facility;  for  a  term  of  25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  and  such \nother terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth  in the draft \nloan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n\nTakehiko  Nakao \nPresident \n \n\n18 November 2014 \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nDesign Summary \nImpact \nImproved energy \nefficiency and cleaner \nenvironment in IMAR \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n\nPerformance Targets and \nIndicators with Baselines \n\nData Sources and \nReporting  Mechanisms \n\n \nData from IMAR \nEnvironment Protection \nBureau \n\nOutcome \nImproved air quality and \nreduced greenhouse \ngas emissions in \nHohhot  \n\nOutputs \n1.
