Given  their  high  growth \npotential and strategic location, the project will develop these cities to be engines of growth for \nGuangxi  and  gateways  for  the  country  to  its  Southeast  Asian  neighbors.  The  project  will \nincorporate  innovative  ideas  on  environmentally  friendly  and  climate-proof  technologies, \nuniversal  design,  and  transport  planning  for  enhancing  urban  safety.  These  new  urban \napproaches will be widely replicable within Guangxi and in the rest of the PRC.2\n \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nGuangxi is one of 12 less-developed provinces and autonomous regions covered under \n3. \nthe PRC\u2019s Western Development Strategy.3\n Guangxi shares a  border of 1,020 kilometers (km) \nwith  Viet  Nam  and  has  1,595  km  of  seacoast,  which  make  Guangxi  the  only  province  that \nprovides  both  seaport  and  land  access  for  the  neighboring  landlocked  provinces  of  Guizhou, \nYunnan, and Hunan and farther west. Guangxi is emerging as an important national multimodal \ntransport and trade gateway to link south and west parts of the PRC with neighboring countries \nin the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). This can help Guangxi better contribute \nto achieving greater balance in the social and economic development of the PRC. \n  \nAlthough  the  growth  in  Guangxi\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  has  exceeded  the \n4. \nnational average since 2001 due to support under the Western Development Strategy, GDP per \ncapita  in  2010  is  only  $2,791  and  far  below  the  national  average  of  $4,394.4\n Trade  statistics \nshow that the speed at which Guangxi is achieving growth from regional economic integration is \nnot  great  enough.  Guangxi  is  significantly  less  urbanized  than  the  other  provinces  and  its  per \ncapita  rates  of  urban  infrastructure  investment  and  coverage  are  among  the  country\u2019s  lowest. \nThe growth potential of Guangxi has been effectively constrained by the less developed urban \ninfrastructure of the port cities along the Beibu gulf, which are endowed with deepwater harbors \nto serve as the national gateway for international trade and economic cooperation. \n\n \nTogether with the capital city of Nanning, the three project cities comprise the core part \n5. \nof  the  Guangxi  Beibu  Gulf  Economic  Development  Zone. 5\n Despite  national  and  provincial \ngovernment  support,  they  are  struggling  to  expand  their  basic  urban  infrastructure  quickly \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic \n\nof China for Preparing the Guangxi Beibu Gulf Cities Development Project. Manila. \n\n3  The  Western  Development  Strategy  launched  in  1999  aims  to  support  economic  development  in  the  western \nregions of the PRC so that that they can catch up with the faster-growing eastern provinces. The strategy covers \nsix provinces (Gansu, Guizhou, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan), five provincial-level autonomous regions \n(Guangxi  Zhuang,  Inner  Mongolia,  Ningxia  Hui,  Xizang  [also  known  as  Tibet  Autonomous  Region],  and  Xinjiang \nUygur), and one municipality of provincial status directly administered by the central government (Chongqing). \n\n4  Guangxi\u2019s GDP growth in 2010 was 14.2%, compared with the national average of 10.3%. \n5  In March 2008, the national and Guangxi governments identified the Guangxi Beibu Gulf Economic Development \n\nZone for a key development thrust to promote domestic and international regional economic integration. \n\n\fenough to improve poor living conditions and meet their growth targets. In Qinzhou and Beihai, \nlimited  road  networks  and  the  poor  quality  of  existing  roads  result  in  fragmented  urban \nexpansion  and  low  quality  of  life  for  residents.  Inefficient  transport  connections  between \nresidential  areas  and  port  industrial  zones  also  make  industrial  operations  difficult  in  these \ncities.  In  Fangchenggang,  inadequate  existing  road  capacity  and  poor  traffic  safety  cannot \nsupport  basic  living  conditions  for  the  increasing  urban  population  and  growing  logistics \nactivities  with  the  border  city  of  Dongxing.  Untreated  municipal  and  industrial  wastewater \ndegrades  the  urban  environment  and  increases  public  health  risks.  The  lack  of  a  centralized \nwastewater  treatment  plant  (WWTP)  is  also  a  bottleneck  for  industrial  development  in \nFangchenggang. All of these lead to (i) deterioration in the quality of life especially for the poor, \n(ii)  limited  investment  prospects  in  the  three  project  cities,  and  (iii)  delay  in  promoting \ninternational and national regional economic integration for Guangxi.6\n \n \n6. \nThe  project  will  help  these  three  cities  (i) promote  environmentally  sound  urban \ndevelopment;  (ii)  improve  quality  of  life  by  providing  access  to  better  social  services  and  a \ncleaner  environment  to  the  poor;  (iii) improve  the  investment  climate,  as  well  as  international \nand domestic trade and commerce; and (iv) accelerate sustainable socioeconomic development \nand  poverty  reduction  through  increased  employment  opportunities  for  the  poor  and  rural \nmigrants. Improved road access and transport facilities will connect key urban districts and port \nindustrial  areas,  and  contribute  to  better  ambient  air  quality  and  fuel  efficiency.  A  WWTP  will \nalleviate environmental pollution of surface water and reduce health hazards. The project design \nincorporates lessons from past Asian Development Bank (ADB)-financed projects in the PRC to \nensure  financial  viability  of  the  wastewater  facility,  close  institutional  coordination  for  timely \nsewer network construction, enhanced road safety, and sustainable operation and maintenance \n(O&M) of project facilities.7\n  \n \n7. \nThe project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 that is now \nunder  preparation  and  that  will  continue  to  highlight  sustainable  urban  development  with  low \nenvironmental impacts. This will also be the focus of the government's Twelfth Five-Year Plan, \n2011\u20132015. The PRC\u2019s national and regional strategies for growth prioritize urban infrastructure \nand  environmental  sustainability.  The  project  is  also  consistent  with  ADB's  urban  sector \nstrategy, water policy, and strategic priorities on climate change,8 and will help the PRC work to \nachieve  Millennium  Development  Goal  7,  Target  7.C. 9\n The  project  will  demonstrate  special \nfeatures for potential replication in other cities in the PRC: \n\n(i) \n\nEnvironmentally  friendly  technologies.  The  choice  of  technology  for  the \nproject  has  been  driven  by  medium-  and  long-term  environmental,  social,  and \neconomic  benefits.  The  project  roads  will  be  the  first  in  Guangxi  to  use  public \nutility  conduits  for  underground  urban  infrastructure  to  avoid  unnecessary \nenvironmental  impact  from  O&M.\n Energy-efficient  street  lighting  and  signage \nwill  also  support  low-carbon  city  development.  The  WWTP  will  use  advanced \n\n10\n\n                                                \n6  Sector Assessment (Summary): Multisector (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n7  ADB. 2004.

The  three  coastal \ncities  are  vulnerable  to  future  climate  change  impacts.  The  technical  design  of \nthe  project  roads  includes  such  climate-proofing  measures  as  slope  protection \nand  erosion  control  and  permeable  surfacing  for  sidewalks  for  a  sustainable \nurban drainage system. A study on design guidelines for climate proofing will also \nbe prepared under the capacity development component. \n\n(iii)  Universal design for urban infrastructure and public facilities.11\n\n  The project \nwill  strengthen  the  cities\u2019  capacity  to  adopt  the  concept  of  universal  design  in \nplanning  urban  infrastructure.  This  will  enable  them  to  raise  livability  standards \nand better meet the needs of elderly and vulnerable people. The basic design will \nbe  considered  during  the  detailed  design  and  a  separate  study  will  be \nimplemented under the project to enhance design concept and planning policy. \n\n(iv)  Human-centered  planning  of  urban  districts  transport.  The  project  will \nprovide  capacity  development  training  to  promote  urban  safety  and  human-\ncentered  district  and  transport  planning,  including  advanced  urban  transport \nplanning  for  emergency  response  and  inclusive  district  land  use  planning  to \nbenefit the poor and rural migrants. \n\n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n8. \nThe  impact  will  be  improved  basic  living  conditions  and  socioeconomic  development  in \nthe three port cities to support the PRC\u2019s regional cooperation. The outcome will be better urban \ninfrastructure services and environment in the three project cities. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  project  will  generate  outputs  from  five  investment  components  and  one  capacity \n\n9. \ndevelopment and institutional strengthening component:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nBeihai Zhulin urban road and related infrastructure.

Engineering  designs  with  records  of  proven \nreliable  performance  will  be  adopted  for  construction  of  roads  and  bridge,  the  WWTP,  and \nrelated  municipal  infrastructure.  Technical  feasibility  was  found  to  be  adequate  after  careful \nexamination of the project\u2019s compatibility with local conditions and future demand projections for \nroad traffic and wastewater generation. Different technical options were analyzed to identify the \nbest  routes  and  plant  location,  road  materials,  bridge  design,  and  wastewater  and  sludge \ntreatment process. The project engineering designs will adopt advanced technologies, such as \nenergy-saving  street  lighting,  public  utility  conduits,  and  a  treatment  process  capable  of \nremoving  more  nitrogen  and  phosphorous  from  wastewater.  Technical  due  diligence  analysis \nrevealed little technical risk in having these components locally constructed and operated. The \nproject  will  provide  training  under  its  capacity  development  component  to  ensure  sustainable \nO&M of project facilities. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n15. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  was  estimated  by  comparing  with-  and \nwithout-project  scenarios.  The  project\u2019s  economic  costs  reflect  (i)  the  capital  cost  for \nconstruction, including physical contingencies, land acquisition, resettlement and environmental \nmonitoring  costs;  and  (ii)  O&M  costs,  which  include  routine  annual  maintenance  and  periodic \nmajor  maintenance.  The  economic  benefits  of  the  road  components  are  savings  in  (i)  vehicle \noperating costs, (ii) travel time for road users, and (iii) road accident costs\u2014the result of fewer \naccidents.  Quantifiable  economic  benefits  of  the  Maoling  WWTP  component  are  focused  on \nhealth benefits. The EIRRs for the project\u2019s five components ranged from 12.7% to 23.7%. The \nnet present value for the whole project is CNY1,391.8 million and the EIRR is 18.7%. Sensitivity \n\n \n\n\fanalysis shows that the EIRRs for a 20% reduction in benefits, a 20% increase in capital cost, a \n1-year  project  completion  delay,  and  the combination  of these  three  cases  are  16.0%,  16.6%, \n18.6%, and 13.8% respectively. This indicates that the project is economically viable.15\n \n \nThe  financial  viability  of  the  revenue-generating  Maoling  WWTP  component  indicates \n16. \nthat  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  is  5.2%,  which  exceeds  the  weighted  average \ncost of capital (WACC) of 2.4%. Sensitivity analysis of the FIRR shows that the project remains \nfinancially  robust  in  the  face  of  adverse  changes  including  capital  cost  increases,  demand \ndecreases,  operating  cost  increases,  and  a  1-year  delay  in  project  completion.  Wastewater \ntariffs  will  need  to  be  increased  every  5  years  after  the  ADB-financed  facilities  commence \noperation.  The  analysis  concluded  that  low-income  households  will  be  able  to  afford  the \nprojected tariff increases since the share of income expended on water and wastewater will be \naround  0.6%  of  household  income  per  month  which  is  well  below  the  benchmark  of  5%. \nLessons  from  past  urban  sector  projects  generated  recommendations  for  detailed  financial \nanalysis of potential delays in water and wastewater tariff increases. The financial sustainability \nof  the  Maoling  WWTP  was  also  supported  by  the  analysis  that  its  FIRR  would  remain  higher \nthan the WACC (2.4%) if the proposed tariff increase is implemented every 10 years instead of \nevery 5 years. The FIRR drops to 2.5%, in the case of a combination of (i) a 10% increase in \ncapital  costs, (ii)  a  10% decrease  in  demand,  and  (iii)  a  10%  increase  in  operating  costs. The \nFangchenggang  municipal  government  has  committed  to  provide  subsidies  to  sustain  the \noperation if revenues do not cover O&M costs. For nonrevenue road components, the financial \nanalysis indicated that the three cities present acceptable levels of fiscal risk in their abilities to \nprovide  counterpart funds, service  project  debt, and fund the O&M  of  the  project components. \nThe highest percentage of the cities\u2019 municipal fiscal revenues that would be required for such \nfunding  annually  ranges  from  0.65%  to  1.28%  over  the  project  period  (2011\u20132016).  The \nmaximum projected debt service requirements for the three cities will be about 0.03% to 0.06% \nof their projected annual revenues during the project operation period.16\n \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n17. \nThe  project  will  be  ADB\u2019s  ninth  loan  to  Guangxi,  which  is  also  successfully  managing \nother multisector urban development projects funded by other bilateral and multilateral financial \ninstitutions. The financial management and procurement capacity assessments concluded that \nGZARG,  the  municipal  governments,  and  the  project  implementing  companies  (PICs)  have \nadequate capacity for financial management and procurement in accordance with ADB policies \nand  procedural  requirements,  and  national  procurement  laws  and  regulations.  Under  GZARG \nsupervision, the municipal governments and the PICs are also receiving support and knowledge \non  governance  issues  from  the  project  cities  of  ADB\u2019s  Guangxi  Southwestern  Cities \nDevelopment  Project. 17  They  and  GZARG  will  also  benefit  from  the  capacity  development \nprograms and governance activities under ADB\u2019s technical assistance for Capacity Building for \nEnhanced  Partnership  and  Development  Impact.18\n The  project\u2019s  technical  support  provides  a \nfurther opportunity for the PICs to strengthen their internal audit system through training. ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with GZARG, \nthe municipal governments, and their project management offices. Specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n\n                                                \n15  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16  Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 ADB.  2010.

The  project \nconstruction  phase  will  create  9,850  person-years  of  direct  employment  opportunities  and \nanother 25,610 person-years indirectly, generating an estimated CNY240.36 million in earnings \nfor  the  direct  beneficiaries  and  CNY624.94  million  for  those  who  benefit  indirectly.  Direct  jobs \nduring  the  project  operation  phase  will  total  1,190,  indirect  jobs,  3,090.  They  will  generate \nestimated  earnings  of  CNY26.89  million  and  CNY69.83  million,  respectively.  GZARG  and  the \nmunicipal  governments  have  committed  to  prioritizing  the  employment  of  vulnerable  groups, \nincluding the poor, women, and ethnic minorities. To reinforce the positive benefits of improved \ntransport  and  wastewater  treatment,  municipal  governments  will  conduct  public  programs  on \nroad safety and environmental awareness during the project. These programs will address the \nneeds  of  and  risks  to  women  and  children  presented  by  increased  traffic  and  environmental \ndegradation. The social action plan will be supervised and monitored by resettlement and social \ndevelopment specialists under the project management consulting services.19\n \n \nGender benefits. The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. Results \n19. \nfrom the household survey and focus group discussions indicate that the primary responsibilities \nof  women  in  the  project-influenced  area  are  household-related  travel,  housekeeping  activities, \nand taking care of sick and old family members. The project will reduce travel time burdens on \nwomen and improve their mobility and access. Women in all project areas strongly support the \nproject  and  expect  it  to  improve  their  quality  of  life  and  to  create  employment  and  income \nopportunities.  The  project  includes  a  gender  action  plan  to  help  ensure  (i)  increased  women\u2019s \nparticipation  in  the  project,  including  a  target  of  at  least  20%  employment  for  women;  (ii) \nwomen\u2019s  participation  in  gender-sensitive  training  on  public  road  safety  and  environmental \nawareness  programs;  and  (iii)  the  setting  and  tracking  of  gender  targets,  indicators,  and  sex-\ndisaggregated  data \n Resettlement  and  social \ndevelopment  specialists  in  the  project  management  consulting  service  will  ensure  that  the \ngender action plan is implemented and monitored. \n \nE. \n\nfor  project  monitoring  and  evaluation. 20\n\nSafeguards \n\nEnvironment. The project is classified under environmental category A. Environmental \n20. \nimpact  assessments  (EIAs)  were  prepared  for  each  of  the  five  investment  components  and \nreviewed  and  approved  by  the  respective  environmental  protection  bureau.  GZARG  disclosed \nrelevant  environment  information  to  environmentally  affected  people  through  consultations  in \nApril\u2013October  2010  and  the  results  and  findings  were  reflected  in  the  EIAs  and  the  project \ndesign. A project EIA, including an environmental management plan (EMP) and environmental \nmonitoring  program,  assesses  the  potential  adverse  environmental  impacts  of  urban  road \nnetworks  and  the  WWTP  during  construction  and  operation  of  project  facilities. 21\n The  main \nidentified  environmental  impacts  relate  to  air,  water  and  noise  pollution,  solid  waste  disposal, \nand borrow and spoil management during project construction. The EMP fully addresses these \nimpacts  as  well  as  occupational  health  and  safety  issues  to  ensure  residual  environmental \nimpacts are insignificant. In addition to addressing common environmental protection issues, the \nproject also demonstrates good environmental due diligence practice by pursuing measures to \nenhance  environmental  management  on  an  existing  nature \nreserve.  The  municipal \nenvironmental  protection  bureaus  will  support  the  municipal  governments  and  the  PICs  in \n\n                                                \n19 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Environmental Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fimplementing  the  EMPs.  Capacity  building  in  environmental  management  will  be  provided  for \nGZARG, the municipal governments, and the PICs. An environmental monitoring report will be \nprepared  by  GZARG  and  submitted  to  ADB  semiannually  during  implementation  and  annually \nfor  2  years  after  project  completion.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  was  established  under \nGZARG,  the  municipal  governments,  and  the  PICs  to  receive  and  redress  public  grievances \nrelated to environment. The EIA was circulated to the ADB Board of Directors and made publicly \navailable through the ADB website on 10 December 2010. \n \nInvoluntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  under  involuntary  resettlement \n21. \nsafeguard  category  A.22 Five  resettlement  plans  were  approved  by  ADB  on  7 January  2011, \ndisclosed to affected persons, and uploaded to the ADB website on 25 January 2011.23 Overall, \nthe  project  will  acquire  5,288.55  mu  of  land  permanently,  of  which  30.36%  is  classified  as \nfarmland.24\n Permanent land acquisition will affect 4,555 persons. Temporary acquisition of 469 \nmu of land will affect 3,173 persons. A total of 1,045 persons will be relocated and about 34,804 \nsquare  meters  of  residential  and  non-residential  buildings  will  be  demolished.  Removal  of \n546.62  mu  of  shrimp  aquaculture  ponds  will  affect  the  livelihoods  of  155  persons.  In  addition, \nassociated productive assets, ground attachments, and basic infrastructure facilities will also be \naffected.  The  levels  of  compensation  are  based  on  the  relevant  PRC  regulations,  which  were \nconfirmed  to  be  adequate  after  consultation  with  local  governments  and  those  affected,  and \nconsidering  general  practice  in  project  cities.  The  implementation  of  the  project\u2019s  five \nresettlement  plans  will  be  monitored  and  evaluated  internally  and  externally.  The  municipal \ngovernments  will  report  implementation  progress  regularly  to  GZARG,  which  in  turn  will \nsummarize  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  progress  in  the  quarterly  progress  report  to \nADB. The Guangxi project management office will also engage an independent external monitor \nwho will (i) review resettlement progress and the general welfare of affected persons, (ii) make \nrecommendations to resolve any issues or problems, and (iii) provide advice to GZARG and the \nmunicipal  governments.  The  external  monitor  will  pay  special  attention  to  vulnerable  groups, \nincluding the poor, women, and the ethnic minorities, to assess whether they have fully regained \ntheir standard of living. Monitoring and evaluation reports will be prepared semiannually during \nimplementation and annually for 2 years after resettlement is completed. They will be submitted \nto  ADB  and  published  on  ADB\u2019s  website.  The  project  has  also  established  a  transparent \ngrievance  channel  that  will  (i)  provide  a  meaningful  consultation  mechanism  and  (ii) trigger \nremedial action by GZARG and the municipal governments. \n \n22. \nIndigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified  under  indigenous  people  safeguard \ncategory C. Ethnic minorities, predominantly from the Zhuang ethnic group, make up 23.7% of \nthe  urban  population. The  poverty  and  social  assessment  survey  and  consultations  concluded \nthat all urban beneficiaries, including ethnic minorities in the project areas, will benefit from the \ninfrastructure  improvements.  There  will  be  no  adverse  impacts  other  than  resettlement  for  13 \nethnic  minority  households.  This  will  be  addressed  under  the  resettlement  plan  for  the \nFangchenggang Fangcheng\u2013Jiangshan road and related infrastructure component. The overall \nproject design includes prioritization of ethnic minorities for construction jobs and O&M activities \nand  the  use  of  the  local  language,  where  necessary,  in  communication  and  outreach  for \ninvoluntary resettlement consultations. \n\n                                                \n22 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) adjusted the terminology for involuntary resettlement, changing \"affected  \npersons\"  to  \"displaced  persons,\"  who  were  defined  as  persons  physically  and/or  economically  displaced  due  to \ninvoluntary acquisition of land or involuntary restrictions on land use or on access to legally designated parks and \nprotected  areas.
