As a major mode of \npassenger  and  freight  transport,  roads  play  a  pivotal  role  in  the \nnational  economy.  They  also  enhance  regional  cooperation. \nHowever,  the  road  subsector  faces  four  main  development \nchallenges:  (i)  deteriorating  infrastructure;  (ii)  poor  safety  record; \n(iii)  inefficient  crossborder  and  transit  facilities;  and  (iv)  limited \ninstitutional capacity at national, regional, and road agency levels. \n \nThe  improvement  of  road  infrastructure  is  one  of  the  priorities  in \ntwo  state  programs:  (i) State  Program  on  Poverty  Reduction  and \nEconomic Development, and (ii) State Program on Socioeconomic \nDevelopment of Regions. To implement these state programs, the \nMinistry of Transport has drafted a transport policy paper, followed \nby  a  transport  sector  development  strategy.  This  work  involved \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) assistance. The Transport Policy \nPaper  and  the  ensuing  Transport  Sector  Development  Strategy \npaved the way for a road subsector road map. This highlights key \nproblems  and  causes  for  the  execution  of  investment  and  non-\ninvestment changes. \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Transport  developed  a  Road  Network \nDevelopment Program for 2006\u20132015 (the Program) in July 2006. \nThe  Program,  which  includes  an  investment  component  and  a \nnon-investment component, will pave the way for the development \nof an adequate, efficient, safe, and sustainable road network. The \ninvestment  component  will  construct,  upgrade,  and  rehabilitate \nabout  9,500  kilometers  (km)  of  124  priority  roads,  comprising \n3,570 km of 64 state roads and 5,928 km of 58 secondary roads. \nThe  non-investment  component  will  focus  on  priority  reforms, \nincluding development of regulations and operational procedures; \nencouragement of private sector participation in construction and \nmaintenance;  and  capacity  building  for  planning,  monitoring, \nevaluation,  and  reporting.  The  overall  investment  reaches  $3.4 \nbillion over the next 10  years.   Most of this will be financed from \nthe  Government\u2019s  budget.  The  Government  has  also  sought \nexternal  financing,  with  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  as  the  main \nsources. ADB\u2019s share of the Program is 15%. \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n\n \nMultitranche Financing \nFacility \n\n \nRationale \n\nresources \n\nfrom  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \n\nThe first project (Project 1) of the Program has four components: \n(i)  construction  of  about  59  km  of  a  new  expressway  between \nMasalli  and  Astara  on  the  southern  corridor,  (ii)  rehabilitation  of \nlocal  roads  in  the  project  area,  (iii)  installation  of  a  vehicle \nthe  Masalli\u2013Astara  expressway  and \nweighing  station  along \nprocurement  of  road  maintenance  equipment,  and  (iv)  project \nsupport and capacity building for road network management. \n \nThe Government has requested ADB to help finance the Program \nthrough a multitranche financing facility (MFF) in the amount up to \nthe  equivalent  of  $500  million.  The  financing  will  be  provided \nprimarily \n(OCR), \nsupplemented  by  its  Special  Funds  resources.  The  MFF  will \ncomprise  multiple  loans,  subject  to  the  submission  of  related \nperiodic  financing  requests  (PFR)  by  the  Government  and \nexecution  of  related  loan  agreements  and  other  warranties  and \nrepresentations. \n \nThe  Government  has  entered  into  a  Framework  Financing \nAgreement  (FFA)  with  ADB.  In  accordance  with  the  FFA,  the \nGovernment  has  submitted  the  first  PFR  for  tranche  1  to  ADB, \nrequesting a blend of two loans in a total amount of $200 million, \ncomprising  an  OCR  loan  of  $190  million  and  a  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  6,535,000  ($10 \nmillion  equivalent)  from  the  Special  Funds  resources,  to  help \nfinance Project 1. The first PFR is presented to the Board together \nwith this report and the FFA. \n \nConnectivity,  both  domestically  and  internationally,  is  the  key  to \nsustainable  development.  However,  about  70%  of  Azerbaijan\u2019s \nroad network is in poor condition, resulting in high transport costs, \nlong  delivery  times,  and  traffic  accidents.  This  constitutes  an \nimpediment  to  non-oil  sector  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  The \nroad  network  needs \nto  be  developed.  This  requires  new \ninvestments  and  improved  maintenance.  The  subsector  also \nneeds  improved  safety  measures  and  standards,  and  \u201csoft\u201d \ninvestments to facilitate crossborder trade and transit traffic. \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  total  investment  plan  for  the  road  network  is \n$350 million a year during 2006\u20132015. The financing plan for such \ninvestments  relies  mainly  on  allocation  of  the  Government\u2019s \nbudget. Nevertheless, the Government has also opted for external \nfinancing.  The  World  Bank  and  ADB  are  part  of  this  financing \nplan.  The  Government  is  seeking  money  but  also  \u201cbest  practice\u201d \nideas on project design, quality, standards, and reforms. As roads \nare  identified  as  a  strategically  important  area  in  ADB\u2019s  country \nthe  Program \nstrategy  and  program  update \nwarrants  ADB  support.  The  MFF  modality  will  allow \nthe \nGovernment (i) a greater degree of certainty on the financing plan, \n\nfor  Azerbaijan, \n\n\f \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nInvestment Plan \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\niii\n\nin \n\nto  establishing  a \n\nthe  country  domestically  and \n\nand  (ii)  to  borrow  according  to  progress  on  project  preparation. \nThe  MFF  will  also  contribute \nlong-term \npartnership between ADB and Azerbaijan. \n \nThe  Program  will  contribute  to  sustained  economic  and  social \ndevelopment  in  Azerbaijan.  It  will  create  a  better  trade  logistic \ncorridor  and, \nthis  manner,  enhance  cooperation  with \nneighboring  countries.  The  principal  outcome  of  the  Program  will \nbe  an  adequate,  efficient,  safe,  and  sustainable  road  network, \nlinking \ninternationally.  The \nsuccessful  implementation  of  the  Program  will  result  in  (i) \nincreased  mobility  and  accessibility  to  markets,  jobs,  and  social \nservices; (ii) greater opportunities for private sector participation in \nbusiness activities; (iii)  lower  transport  costs;  (iv)  increased  trade \nflows  and  competitiveness;  and  (v)  improved  governance  in  the \nroad subsector. \n \nThe  Program  is  estimated  at  $3.4  billion  equivalent.  The  cost  of \nProject  1, \ntaxes,  duties,  physical  and  price \ncontingencies,  interest,  and  other  charges,  is  estimated  at  $249 \nmillion equivalent. \n\nincluding \n\nInvestment Program \n \n\nItem \n\nItem \n\n1.

An OCR \nloan  will  have  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.35%  per  annum,  and  such \nother  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  related  loan  agreements. \nThe loan from the Special Funds resources will have a term of 32 \nyears,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  interest  of  1.0% \nper  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the \nrelated loan agreement. \n \nUntil 31 December 2014 \n \n30 June 2014 \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Program \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \n\n \nMinistry of Transport \n \n\n\fImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n \n\n \nProcurement \n\nConsulting Services \n\n  v\n\nto  ensure \n\nin  ARS\u2014managing \n\ninteragency  coordination, \n\nThe  AzerRoadService  Open  Joint-Stock  Company  (ARS)  under \nthe  Ministry  of  Transport  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency.  The \nchairman of ARS will be responsible for overall supervision of the \nProgram.  The  recently  reorganized  project  implementation  unit \nthe  projects  supported  by  ADB, \n(PIU) \nEuropean  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  and  World \nBank\u2014will  handle  day-to-day  implementation  activities  of  the \nProgram.  The  PIU  will  also  undertake  such  functions  as  (i) \npreparation  of  PFRs,  (ii)  engagement  and  supervision  of \nconsultants  and  contractors,  (iii)  preparation  of  reports,  and  (iv) \nobtainment of approvals from ADB and the Government. The PIU \nis headed by the project director, who will report to the chairman \nof  ARS.  The  PIU  comprises  ARS  staff  and  a  team  of  externally \ncontracted  qualified  technical,  safeguards,  financial,  and  support \nstaff to supplement resources in ARS. \n \nA steering committee will be established with representation from \nthe  Cabinet  of  Ministers\u2019  Office,  Ministry  of  Economic \nDevelopment, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Transport, ARS, and \nthe  PIU  director  among  others.  The  steering  committee  will  be \ntransport  and  will  meet \nchaired  by  a  deputy  minister  of \nsemiannually \nreview \nimplementation progress, and provide approvals and guidance as \nnecessary. \n \nADB-financed  goods  and  services  will  be  procured  according  to \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime). \nInternational  competitive  bidding  procedures  will  be \nfollowed  for  contracts  with  an  amount  above  $3  million  for  civil \nworks, and at least $1 million for goods. The upper limit for a civil \nworks  contract  to  be  procured  through  national  competitive \nbidding procedures will be set at $3 million. \n \nADB approved advance contracting of civil works under Project 1 \non  22  June  2007.  The  Government  was  advised  that  ADB \napproval of advance contracting does not commit ADB to finance \nany ensuing project(s) from the MFF. \n \nConsulting services will be required for capacity development and \nproject implementation support. Key tasks include (i) construction \nsupervision, (ii) monitoring of project performance, (iii) preparation \nof  subsequent  projects,  and  (iv)  capacity  development.  The \ncapacity development component will involve the establishment of \na management unit comprising long-term and short-term advisors. \nThis team will define a detailed work plan; establish a modern and \nefficient management information system; and cater for planning, \nreforms,  technical,  fiduciary  oversight,  safeguards,  and  other \nmatters  connected  with \nimplementation\u2014including  reporting, \nmonitoring, and evaluation.

This comprises (i) 766 person-months (146 \ninternational  and  620  national)  for  construction  supervision, \nproject monitoring and evaluation, and preparation of Project 2; (ii) \nfor \n70  person-months \nstrengthening  the  database  for  secondary  roads;  and  (iii)  24 \nperson-months  (6  international  and  18  national)  for  developing \nlegal  and  regulatory  frameworks  and  operational  procedures  for \ntoll  roads.  Additional  consulting  services,  if  necessary,  will  be \nprocured under subsequent projects. The consulting services will \nbe  financed  from  ADB  loans.  ARS  will  select  and  engage  the \nconsultants  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  using  the \nquality- and cost-based selection method. \n \nProject  1  of \nis  classified  category  A.  An \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) was undertaken, and the \nsummary  environmental  impact  assessment  (SEIA)  circulated  to \nthe Board and publicly disclosed through the ADB website on 16 \nJanuary  2007.  The  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework for the Program is included in the SEIA. \n \nThe  Program  will  cut  transport  costs  and  bring  benefits  to  road \nusers,  road  construction  companies,  traders,  and  other  people \nwho  derive  income  from  expanded  road  traffic  and  trade  in \nAzerbaijan.  The  direct  benefits  from  the  improved  road  network \ninclude (i) lower road transport and maintenance costs; (ii) faster \nand  more  reliable  road  transport  services;  (iii)  reduced  traffic \naccidents;  (iv)  improved  access  to  markets  and  social  services; \nand (v) jobs and income created during implementation (i.e., use \nof  local  labor  and  construction  materials)  and  after  completion \n(i.e.,  roadside  business  activities).  The  direct  benefits  will  initially \naccrue  to  vehicle  owners  and  operators  and  road  construction \ncompanies,  but  will  be  gradually  shared  with  passengers  and \nfreight customers through reduced bus fares and freight charges. \nWhile  Azerbaijan  is  the  major  beneficiary,  other  countries  in  the \nregion  may  also  benefit  from  the  Program  through  efficient \nmovements of transit traffic via Azerbaijan. The indirect benefits of \nthe  Program,  which  are  expected  to  become  tangible  after  the \ncompletion  of  Project  1,  include  (i)  improved  road  network \nmanagement,  and  (ii)  increased  business  activities  and  jobs  that \nhave forward or backward linkages to road network development. \n \n\n\f  vii\n\n(ii) \n\nimplementation, \n\n(iii) \nto  regional  cooperation,  (iv) \n\nThe  key  assumptions  underlying  the  Program  are  (i)  continued \npolitical and macroeconomic stabilities in Azerbaijan, (ii) effective \nimplementation  of  the  State  Program  on  Poverty  Reduction  and \nthe  Government\u2019s  continued \nEconomic  Development, \nthe  Government\u2019s \ncommitment \ncommitment to implement the road map and the Program, and (v) \nadequate financing. \n \nRisks  to  the  Program  include  (i)  limited  coordination  among \ngovernment  agencies  during \nrapid \ndeterioration  of  the  road  network  caused  by  weak  axle-load \ncontrols  and  insufficient  funding  for  maintenance,  (iii)  delays  in \npreparation  and  implementation  of  subsequent  projects,  and  (iv) \ncost  overruns  caused  by  unexpected  increases  in  prices  of  fuel \nand  raw  materials.  The  Government  has  taken  the  necessary \nmeasures  to  minimize  these  risks.  The  steering  committee  will \ncoordinate  work  of  the  agencies  to  ensure  that  issues  are \nresolved  promptly  and  that  these  agencies  extend  concerted \nsupport  for  the  Program.  The  Government  is  committed,  through \nthe Ministry of Transport, to enforce axle-load controls and further \nincrease  funding  for  road  maintenance.  ADB,  together  with  its \npartners,  will  provide  continued  support  to  ARS  to  strengthen  its \ncapacity  for  road  network  management.  Adequate  consulting \nservices  are  provided  to  help  prepare  subsequent  projects  and \nmanage  implementation,  monitor  performance,  measure  results, \nand  report  to  ADB.

The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nAzerbaijan\u2019s  transport  sector  plays  an  important  role  in  the  national  economy, \naccounting  for  around  6%  of  the  country\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  2005.  It  also \nenhances  regional  cooperation.  The  transport  sector  comprises  railways,  roads,  civil  aviation, \nmaritime transport, and pipelines. Roads are the dominant mode of passenger transport (74% of \ntotal passengers in passenger kilometers [km]) and the second major mode of freight transport \n(28% of total freight volume in ton-km). While freight is mainly carried by railways, the volume \ncarried by roads rose by 1,330% from 1995 to 2005, more rapidly than other modes of transport. \nWith continued economic growth in Azerbaijan, the share of roads in total transport is projected \nto increase, enhancing the road subsector\u2019s importance to the country\u2019s development. Detailed \nanalysis of the road subsector is in Appendix 2. \n \n3. \nThe  road  network  comprises  around  25,000  km  of  roads,  including  4,498  km  in  the \nNagorno-Karabakh  area  and  2,078  km  in  the  Nakhchivan  Autonomous  area.1  It  consists  of  \n7,016  km  of  state  roads  and  17,997  km  of  municipal  roads.  The  network  is  dominated  by  two \nmajor highways: (i) the east\u2013west highway linking  the country\u2019s capital, Baku, to the Georgian \nborder; and (ii) the north\u2013south highway running from the Russian border to the Iranian border \nthrough Baku. About 51% of the roads are paved and 49% gravel. However, about 70% of the \nroad network is in poor condition and requires rehabilitation. \n \n4. \nThe  motorization  rate  is  low  by  international  standards.  The  vehicle  fleet  numbered \nabout  612,000  in  2005,  including  480,000  cars,  91,000  trucks,  and  27,000  buses.  This  was \nequivalent to 73 vehicles per 1,000 people. About 70% of trucks and 50% of buses have been \noperating  for  over  10  years,  with  an  inevitable  effect  on  the  level  of  service  and  costs  of \noperation. The vehicle fleet grew rapidly at an annual rate of 10% in recent years, and this trend \nis projected to gain momentum with continued economic growth in the country. \n \nAfter a gradual decline during 1994\u20132000, the number of road traffic accidents, fatalities, \n5. \nand  injuries  has  risen  sharply  at  an  annual  rate  of  12.5%  since  2001.  There  were  3,179  road \ntraffic accidents in 2005, resulting in 1,065 fatalities and 3,668 injuries. The fatality rate in 2005 \nwas  174  per  10,000  vehicles,  much  higher  than  that  in  European  countries.  Pedestrians \naccounted for around 60% of casualties in urban areas, while passengers made up about 50% \nof the casualties in rural areas. \n \n6. \nThe road transport service market is almost fully liberalized. The private sector plays a \nkey  role  in  provision  of  road  transport  services,  accounting  for  more  than  95%  of  freight  and \npassenger traffic. The state-owned road transport operators were largely privatized and foreign \nroad  transport  operators  are  allowed  to  set  up  business.  Freight  charges  and  bus  fares  for \ndomestic road transport are determined based on market conditions, although the Government \n\n                                                 \n1  Nakhchivan  is  separated  from  central  Azerbaijan  by  Armenia.  Central  Azerbaijan  and  Nakhchivan  are  connected \n\nby air transport or road transport via Iran. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nis setting up prices for urban passenger transport, and tariffs for crossborder and transit traffic. \nThe Government has recently introduced vehicle licensing to enhance vehicle axle-load controls \nand improve road safety. \n \nThe  transport  sector  is  managed  by  the  Ministry  of  Transport.  The  road  network \n7. \n(excluding  Nakhchivan)2  is  under  the  responsibility  of  the  AzerRoadService  Open  Joint-Stock \nCompany  (ARS)  under  the  Ministry  of  Transport,  which  was  reorganized  from  the  Road \nTransport  Service  Department  in  March  2007.  The  Government  made  efforts  to  improve \nmanagement in the road subsector. An amendment to the Road Law is being reviewed at the \nCabinet  of  Ministers  and  a  corporate  plan  for  ARS  was  developed.  ARS\u2019s  budget  increased \nfrom $15.7 million in 2003 to $106.8 million in 2006. With the abolishment of the Road Fund in \n2001,  the  road  subsector  was  financed  primarily  from  the  Government\u2019s  budget.  The \nGovernment decided to restore the Road Fund in January 2007, but it is too early to assess its \nperformance.  The  overall  institutional  capacity  in  the  road  subsector  is  limited  and  needs \nstrengthening. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nChallenges \n\n \nLike  other  sectors  in  Azerbaijan,  the  road  subsector  is  in  transition  from  a  centrally \n8. \nplanned to a market-oriented system. The subsector faces four major development challenges: \n(i)  deteriorating  infrastructure,  (ii)  poor  safety  record,  (iii)  inefficient  crossborder  and  transit \nfacilities, and (iv) limited institutional capacity at national, regional, and road agency levels. \n \n9. \nRoad  Network  Infrastructure.  The  road  network  was  primarily  developed  under  the \nformer Soviet Union, and does not meet adequately the need of the fast expanding economy. \nThere  are  only  191  km  of  4-lane  highways,  and  most  roads  are  in  poor  condition  due  to  two \nreasons. First, despite an increase from $5.7 million in 2001 to $55.5 million in 2006, funding for \nroad  maintenance  remains  inadequate,  accounting  for  less  than  0.5%  of  GDP.  As  a  result,  a \nlarge part of the road network deteriorated rapidly and became non-maintainable. Second, due \nto  weak  enforcement  of  vehicle  axle  load  regulations,  vehicle  axle  overloading  is  prevalent, \ncausing rapid pavement deterioration. Surveys showed that about 20% of 4-axle trucks, 5-axle \ntrucks,  and  buses  exceeded  the  axle-load  limit.  The  poor  road  conditions  results  in  high \ntransport  costs,  long  delivery  times,  and  traffic  accidents,  thus  constituting  an  impediment  to \nnon-oil sector growth and poverty reduction. The road network needs to be developed so as to \nspur growth of trade, investment, and tourism in Azerbaijan. \n \n10. \nRoad Safety. Road safety is an acute problem, reflected by a sharp rise in the number \nof traffic accidents, fatalities, and injuries since 2001. The current fatality rate is about 10 times \nthat in the European countries, causing significant economic and human losses. While there are \nseveral causes of traffic accidents, the inadequacy of the road network with poor conditions is a \nprimary  cause.  Curves  and  superelevation  are  inappropriately  designed,  pavements  are \ndeteriorating,  and  safety  furniture  is  lacking  on  many  roads.  Other  causes  of  road  traffic \naccidents  include  weak  enforcement  of  safety  regulations,  intoxicated  driving,  and  inadequate \ndriver  education.  With  the  rapid  expansion  of  vehicle  fleet,  road  traffic  accidents  are  likely  to \nincrease  in  the  future,  unless  remedial  action  is  undertaken.  Road  safety  should  be  improved \nthrough road network development and increased public safety awareness. \n \n\n                                                 \n2  Nakhchivan has its own road agency, Nakhavtoyol. \n\n\f \n\n 3\n\nCrossborder  and  Transit  Transport.  Azerbaijan\u2019s geographic location in the southern \n11. \nCaucasus  makes  its  road  network  crucial  to  regional  transport  and  trade.  The  east\u2013west  and \nnorth\u2013south highways form part of the Asian highway network3 connecting Iran and the Russian \nFederation,  as  well  as  Georgia  and  Turkey  to  Central  Asia.  Azerbaijan  is  a  signatory  to  a \nnumber  of  international  transport  agreements  and  conventions.  However,  crossborder  and \ntransit road transport remains inefficient. Surveys showed that 80% of firms experienced delays \nof  1\u22123  days  in  crossing  the  borders  of  Azerbaijan. 4   The  major  causes  include  poor  road \nconditions,  inadequate  crossborder  facilities,  and  nonharmonized  crossborder  procedures  with \nneighboring  countries.  These  barriers  severely  hinder  crossborder  and  transit  traffic,  which \naccounts  only  for  around  5%  of  the  total  traffic  on  the  east\u2013west  and  southern  highways. \nDevelopment  of  an  integrated  and  efficient  road  network  will  facilitate  crossborder  and  transit \ntraffic, and contribute to regional cooperation and integration. \n \n12. \nInstitutional  Capacity.  Despite  some  progress  on  policy  and  institutional  reforms, \ninstitutional capacity in the road subsector remains limited. This is reflected by (i) lack of a legal \nand  regulatory  framework  for  managing  the  road  network;  (ii)  weak  enforcement  of  some \nexisting  regulations  such  as  those  relating  to  vehicle  axle-load  controls  and  road  safety;  (iii) \nweak financial management; (iv) lack of private sector participation in road maintenance; and (v) \nlimited staff experience in management of road projects. ARS received World Bank assistance \nfor institutional strengthening during 2003\u20132005. As the first step toward sound governance in \nthe  road  subsector,  World  Bank  assistance  produced  a  number  of  recommendations.  Further \nexternal  assistance  is  needed  to  strengthen  the  institutional  capacity  in  the  subsector  by \nsupporting implementation of these recommendations. \n \n\n2. \n\nOpportunities \n\n \n13. \nAn inadequate and inefficient road network is a bottleneck to sustained economic growth \nand rapid poverty reduction. Despite recent strong growth driven by the oil sector, oil output in \nAzerbaijan is projected to reach peak around 2015, unless new oil reserves can be found. Thus, \nnon-oil  sector  development  is  crucial  to  the  country.  Good  transport  infrastructure  contributes \nsignificantly  to  non-oil  sector  development.  In  recognition  of  this,  the  Government  has  set \ndevelopment  of  road  infrastructure  as  one  of  the  priorities  in  two  state  programs:  (i)  State \nProgram on Poverty Reduction and Economic Development (SPPRED) for 2003\u22122005,5 and (ii) \nState Program on Socioeconomic Development of Regions for 2004\u20132008.6 The Government is \nnow preparing a follow-up 10-year poverty reduction strategy, based on achievement of country-\nspecific targets linked to the Millennium Development Goals. In support of implementing these \nprograms,  the  Ministry  of  Transport  drafted  a  transport  policy  paper,  followed  by  a  transport \nsector development strategy developed with Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance.7 The \ndraft Transport Policy Paper and the ensuing Transport Sector Development Strategy paved the \nway for a road subsector roadmap. This highlights key problems and causes for the execution of \ninvestment and non-investment changes. Both documents identified road network development \nas  a  high  priority  over  the  medium  term.  Specifically,  the  documents  set  the  following  major \n\n                                                 \n3   The  concept  of  the  Asian  highway  network  was  developed  with  assistance  of  the  United  Nations  Economic  and \nSocial  Commission  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific.  Twenty-seven  Asian  countries  including  Azerbaijan  have  signed  the \nIntergovernmental Agreement on the Asian Highway Network. \n\n4  World Bank. 2002.

The \nProgram includes an investment component and a non-investment component. The investment \ncomponent  will  construct,  upgrade,  and  rehabilitate  approximately  9,500  km  of  124  priority \nroads, comprising 3,570 km of 64 state roads and 5,928 km of 58 secondary roads. The non-\ninvestment  component  will  focus  on  priority  reforms,  including  the  development  of  regulations \nand  operational  procedures;  encouragement  of  private  sector  participation  in  construction  and \nmaintenance;  and  capacity  building  for  planning,  monitoring,  evaluation,  and  reporting.  The \noverall  investment  reaches  $3.4  billion  over  the  10-year  period.  Most  of  this  will  be  financed \nfrom the Government\u2019s budget. The Government has also sought external financing, with ADB \nand the World Bank as the main sources. The road subsector road map and investment plan for \n2006\u20132015 are in Appendix 3. \n \n\n3. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n \n15. \nThe  road  subsector  has  received  external  assistance  since  the  mid-1990s.  The  major \nsources of external assistance are ADB, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development \n(EBRD),  European  Union,  Islamic  Development  Bank  (IsDB),  and  World  Bank.  Details  of \nexternal  assistance  to  the  road  subsector  are  in  Appendix  4.  In  line  with  the  Government\u2019s \npriority,  external  assistance  focused  on  improving  the  east\u2013west  and  north\u2013south  highways. \nCivil works on the majority of the east\u2013west highway were either completed or underway. The \nAlyat\u2013Hajigabul section was improved in 2003 with funding from IsDB and the Kuwait Fund for \nArab  Economic  Development,  and  the  Ganja\u2013Qazakh  section  was  reconstructed  with  World \nBank  assistance  in  2006.  The  sections  expected  to  be  improved  by  2008  include  (i)  the \nHajigabul\u2013Kyurdamir  section  with  EBRD  assistance,  and  (ii)  the  Qazakh\u2013Georgian  border \nsection and Ganja bypass with ADB assistance. EBRD and the Czech Export Bank are helping \nreconstruct the  northern  highway  from  Baku  to  the  Russian  border,  while  the  World  Bank  and \nADB will jointly develop the southern highway between Alyat and Astara. The World Bank, ADB, \nEBRD,  and  European  Union  have  provided  technical  assistance  for  feasibility  studies  and \ncapacity development. \n \n\n4. \n\nADB\u2019s Strategy and Sector Operations \n\n \nADB\u2019s  assistance  strategy  for  Azerbaijan 9   aims  to  reduce  poverty  and  raise  living \n16. \nstandards  in  a  sustainable  manner.  Given  Azerbaijan\u2019s  geographic  location,  the  latest  country \nstrategy  and  program  update10  identifies  roads  as  a  priority  area  for  ADB  assistance.  ADB \nassistance  to  roads  focuses  on  improving  the  main  highways  connecting  Azerbaijan  to  its \nneighboring countries, supporting policy reform, and promoting capacity development. The first \nlending  project,  approved  in  2005,  aimed  to  rehabilitate  the  Yevlakh\u2013Ganja  and  Qazakh\u2013\n\n                                                 \n8  Republic of Azerbaijan. 2006.

ADB \nassisted  the  Government  in  developing  a  transport  sector  development  strategy  during  2005\u2013\n2006,12  which  will  guide  ADB\u2019s  future  assistance  to  the  transport  sector.  The  Program,  which \nwas prepared with ADB technical assistance approved in November  2005,13 is consistent with \nADB\u2019s assistance strategy for Azerbaijan. \n \n17. \nADB has approved two loans and three TA projects to the transport sector, with a total \namount of around $53.6 million. The portfolio performance in the transport sector is better than \nthe  country  average.  The  East\u2013West  Highway  Improvement  Project  is  being  implemented  as \nscheduled. The detailed design has been completed and bidding documents have been issued. \nOf  the  two  completed  TA  projects,  the  TA  completion  report  for  the  Transport  Sector \nDevelopment Strategy14 has been prepared and the TA was rated fully satisfactory. \n \n\n5. \n\nLessons \n\n \nADB  operations  in  Azerbaijan  are  relatively  new\u2014five  loans  have  been  approved  to \n18. \ndate.15  Thus,  substantive  lessons  cannot  be  drawn  from  previous  projects.  Nevertheless,  the \nProgram was designed with careful consideration of the lessons learned from operations of ADB \nand development partners in Azerbaijan and similar ADB projects in other transition economies. \nThe  following  five  lessons  need  to  be  highlighted.  First,  each  project  and  subproject  financed \nunder  the  MFF  was,  and  will  be,  carefully  evaluated  based  on  in-depth  technical,  economic, \nenvironmental, and social (including land acquisition and resettlement) assessments to ensure \nquality  at  entry.  Second,  advance  contracting  was  undertaken \nto  expedite  project \nimplementation. Third, road infrastructure investments will be accompanied by support for policy \nreform  and  institutional  strengthening  to  maximize  the  development  impact  and  benefits  of \ninvestment. Fourth, the Program will improve both road infrastructure and crossborder facilities, \nto the extent possible, to complement efforts for eliminating physical and nonphysical barriers to \ncrossborder  traffic.  Fifth,  the  Program  was  designed  in  collaboration  with  development \npartners\u2014particularly the World Bank, which is helping construct an expressway between Alyat \nand Masalli on the same southern corridor. \n \n\n6. \n\nRationale for ADB Support for the Program \n\nConnectivity,  both  domestically  and \n\n \n19. \nto  sustainable \ndevelopment  in  Azerbaijan.  However,  about  70%  of  the  country\u2019s  road  network  is  in  poor \ncondition,  resulting  in  high  transport  costs,  long  delivery  times,  and  traffic  accidents.

The \nsubsector also needs improved road safety measures and standards, and \u201csoft\u201d investments to \nfacilitate crossborder trade and transit traffic. \n \n20. \nThe  Government\u2019s  total  investment  plan  for  the  road  network  is  $350  million  a  year \nduring  2006\u20132015.  The  financing  plan  for  such  investments  relies  mainly  on  allocation  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s budget. Nevertheless, the Government has also opted for external financing. The \nWorld Bank and ADB are part of this financing plan. The Government is seeking money but also \n\u201cbest practice\u201d ideas on project design, quality, standards, and reforms. As roads are identified \nas a strategically important area in ADB\u2019s country strategy and program update for Azerbaijan, \nthe Program warrants ADB support. The MFF modality will allow the Government (i) a greater \ndegree  of  certainty  on  the  financing  plan,  and  (ii)  to  borrow  according  to  progress  on  project \npreparation. The MFF will also contribute to establishing a long-term partnership between ADB \nand Azerbaijan. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  Program  will  contribute  to  sustained  economic  and  social  development  in \n21. \nAzerbaijan. It will create a better trade logistic corridor and, in this manner, enhance cooperation \nwith  neighboring  countries.  It  is  an  integral  part  of  Azerbaijan\u2019s  transport  sector  development \nstrategy. The outcome of the Program will be an adequate, efficient, safe, and sustainable road \nnetwork,  linking  Azerbaijan  domestically  and  internationally.  Successful  implementation  of  the \nProgram  will  result  in  (i)  increased  mobility  and  accessibility  to  markets,  jobs,  and  social \nservices; (ii) greater opportunities for private sector participation in business activities; (iii) lower \ntransport costs; (iv) increased trade flows and competitiveness; and (v) improved governance in \nthe road subsector. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  outputs  of  the  Program  will  be  (i)  an  improved  national  road  network;  and  (ii) \n22. \neffective and efficient management of the road network. The outputs will be achieved from two \ncomponents:  (i)  road  infrastructure  development,  and  (ii)  road  network  management  capacity \ndevelopment.  The  road \ninfrastructure  development  component  will  cover  construction, \nupgrading, or rehabilitation of the priority roads. The roads to be financed under the MFF have \nbeen,  or  will  be,  selected  based  on  Azerbaijan\u2019s  Transport  Sector  Development  Strategy  and \neconomic,  social,  environmental,  and  technical  assessments.  The  selection  criteria  and \napproval process for projects and subprojects to be financed under the MFF are in Appendix 5. \nThe road network management capacity development component will focus on priority reforms, \nincluding the development of regulations and operational procedures; encouragement of private \nsector participation in building and maintenance; and capacity building for planning, monitoring, \nevaluation, and reporting. \n \n\n1. \n\nOutputs for Project 1 \n\n \n23. \nThe outputs of the first project (Project 1) of the Program will be (i) an improved southern \nroad transport corridor, and (ii) enhanced management capacity in ARS. These will be achieved \nthrough four components: (i) construction of a new expressway between Masalli and Astara, (ii) \nrehabilitation  of  local  roads  in  the  project  area,  (iii)  installation  of  a  vehicle  weighing  station \n\n\f \n\n 7\n\nalong  the  Masalli\u2013Astara  expressway  and  procurement  of  road  maintenance  equipment,  and \n(iv) project support and capacity building. Each of these components is briefed below. \n \n24. \nConstruction of the Masalli\u2013Astara Expressway. Project 1 will construct about 59 km \nof a new 4-lane expressway between Masalli and Astara on the border with Iran on the southern \ncorridor\u2014the  southern  segment  of  the  new  expressway  between  Alyat  and  Astara.  The \nexpressway  will  comprise  dual  carriageways  with  a  10-meter-wide  pavement  on  each \ncarriageway  and  3-meter  outer  shoulders,  three  interchanges,  and  26  bridges.  It  conforms  to \nAzerbaijan\u2019s standards for a category I road, and is designed for a speed of 120 km per hour \nand with cumulative 13-ton vehicle axle loading. Activities comprise (i) civil works, and (ii) land \nacquisition and resettlement. \n \nRehabilitation of Local Roads. Project 1 will rehabilitate local roads totaling about 120 \n25. \nkm  in  the  project  area  to  enhance  access  to  the  Masalli\u2013Astara  expressway  for  local \ncommunities. Each of the local roads conforms to Azerbaijan\u2019s standards for a category III road, \nwith two lanes of a 5\u20138 meter wide pavement. These local roads were selected in consultations \nwith ARS and local stakeholders, and based on road conditions. \n \n26. \nInstallation of a Vehicle Weighing Station and Procurement of Road Maintenance \nEquipment. Project 1 will install a vehicle weighing station along the Masalli\u2013Astara expressway \nand procure road maintenance equipment. This aims to increase the sustainability of investment \nin  the  expressway  through  the  enforcement  of  vehicle  axle-load  controls  and  adequate \nmaintenance. \n \nProject  Support  and  Capacity  Building  for  Road  Network  Management.  Project  1 \n27. \nwill  provide  support  for  (i)  implementation  of  Project  1,  including  construction  supervision, \nproject  management,  monitoring,  and  evaluation;  (ii)  preparation  of  Project  2  (e.g.,  feasibility \nstudies and due diligence); and (iii) independent external financial auditing. This component will \nalso  help  build  the  capacity  of  ARS  for  road  network  management,  including  (i)  developing  a \ndatabase  for  secondary  roads, 16   and  (ii)  developing  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks  and \noperational  procedures  for  toll  roads.  This  non-investment  component  will  be  implemented \nprimarily through consulting services. \n \n28. \nProject 1 adopts a sector lending modality, comprising Subproject A\u2014a core subproject \ncovering  the  section  km  0\u2013km  22.1  of  the  Masalli\u2013Astara  expressway  and  2  non-core \nsubprojects: (i) Subproject B (section km 22.1\u2013km 45.1 of the Masalli\u2013Astara expressway), and \n(ii)  Subproject  C  (section  km  45.1\u2013km  58.6  of  the  Masalli\u2013Astara  expressway).  Under \nSubproject A the financing will also be provided for rehabilitation of local roads, procurement of \nroad maintenance equipment, installation of a vehicle weighing station along the Masalli\u2013Astara \nexpressway, project support, and capacity building. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutputs for Project 2 \n\n \n29. \nThe  outputs  of  Project  2  under  the  Program  will  be  produced  from  three  tentative \ncomponents:  (i)  upgrading  of  a  2-lane  road  between  Ganja  and  Qazakh  on  the  east\u2013west \ncorridor  to  a  4-lane  expressway  (about  94  km),  (ii)  development  of  crossborder  infrastructure \nand  facilities  in  Astara  (provided  that  the  Government  has  decided  the  location  of  the  new \nborder  crossing  point),  and  (iii)  project  support  and  capacity  building  for  road  network \n\n                                                 \n16 The World Bank is assisting ARS in strengthening the database for state roads. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\nmanagement.  The  outputs  and  components  for  Project  2  will  be  finalized  during  the \nimplementation of Project 1. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n30. \nRegional  Cooperation  and  Integration.  The  Program  will  contribute  to  regional \ncooperation  and  integration  by  improving  Azerbaijan\u2019s  segment  of  the  trans-Caucasian  road \nnetwork and border facilities in Astara. The southern and east\u2013west highways form part of the \nAsian  highway  network  and  have  the  potential  to  become  important  corridors  for  transit  traffic \nbetween  Asia  and  Europe.  Successful  implementation  of  the  Program  will  connect  Azerbaijan \nclosely with neighboring countries, increasing regional traffic and trade. \n \n31. \nCapacity  Development.  The  Program  includes  a  strong  component  on  capacity \ndevelopment  of  road  network  management,  which  will  address  issues  on  road  maintenance, \nroad safety, vehicle axle load controls, and private sector participation. Given a lack of reliable \nroad information, Project 1 will develop a database for secondary roads, which will help ARS to \nbetter  plan  and  undertake  road  maintenance  operations.  Project  1  will  also  develop  legal  and \nregulatory frameworks and operational procedures for toll roads, which will create an enabling \nenvironment  for  private  sector  participation  in  road  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance. \nCapacity  building  assistance  will  continue  under  subsequent  projects.  This  will  supplement \nphysical investments to achieve sustained development in the road subsector. \n \n32. \nAid  Coordination.  The  Program  was  prepared,  and  will  be  implemented,  in  close \ncoordination with the World Bank, which is also providing assistance to the road subsector and \ncofinancing, on a parallel basis, construction of an expressway between Alyat and Masalli\u2014the \nnorthern section of the new expressway between Alyat and Astara. During project processing, \nADB\u2019s project team frequently consulted with World Bank counterparts on issues such as policy \nreforms and capacity development in the road subsector, road alignments, technical standards, \ntraffic projection, safeguards, and project implementation. The ADB-funded project preparatory \ntechnical  assistance  consultant  worked  with  the  consultant  engaged  under  the  World  Bank \nproject.  The  recently  reorganized  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  in  ARS  will  manage \nimplementation of the Program, together with the World Bank-assisted highway II project. The \naid  coordination  during  the  design  and  implementation  of  the  Program  will  improve  the \neffectiveness  of  external  assistance,  mitigate  the  Government\u2019s  administrative  resources \nconstraints, and contribute to enhancing the capacity of ARS for project management. \n \nD. \n\nInvestment Plan \n\n33. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Program  is  estimated  at  around  $3.4  billion  equivalent.  The  total \ncost of Project 1\u2014including taxes, duties, physical and price contingencies, interest, and other \ncharges\u2014is estimated at $249 million equivalent.

ARS  has  been  implementing  the  ADB-funded  East\u2013West  Highway \nImprovement Project and has developed required capacity to manage the implementation of the \nProgram with support of ADB and other partners. The chairman of ARS will be responsible for \noverall  supervision  of  the  Program.  The  recently  reorganized  PIU  in  ARS\u2014managing \nimplementation of road projects supported by ADB, EBRD, and World Bank\u2014will handle day-to-\nday  implementation  activities  of  the  Program.  The  PIU  will  also  undertake  periodic  functions \nsuch  as  (i)  preparation  of  PFRs,  (ii)  engagement  and  supervision  of  consultants  and  \ncontractors,  (iii)  preparation  of  reports,  and  (iv)  obtainment  of  approvals  from  ADB  and  the \nGovernment. The PIU is headed by the project director, who will report to the chairman of ARS. \nThe  PIU  comprises  ARS  staff  and  a  team  of  externally  contracted  qualified  technical, \nsafeguards, financial, and support staff to supplement resources in ARS. \n \n\n\f \n\n 11\n\nA  steering  committee  will  be  established  with  representation  from  the  Cabinet  of \n37. \nMinisters\u2019 Office, Ministry of Economic Development, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Transport, \nARS,  and  the  PIU  director  among  others.  The  steering  committee  will  be  chaired  by  a  deputy \nminister  of  transport  and  will  meet  at  least  semiannually  to  ensure  interagency  coordination, \nreview implementation progress, and provide approvals and guidance as necessary. A program \nand project management organization chart is in Appendix 7. \n \n38. \nADB will finance staff, equipment, and operating expenses in the PIU for implementing \nthe  Program  from  Special  Funds  resources.  Specifically,  ADB  will  finance  the  salaries  of  a \nhighway  engineer,  procurement  specialist,  financial  specialist,  and  administrative  assistant,  as \nwell as related office equipment and supplies. ADB financing for PIU costs is justifiable because \n(i) limited capacity of ARS for project implementation needs to be complemented, and (ii) this is \nan  integral  part  of  ADB\u2019s  support  for  capacity  development  in  the  road  subsector.  The \nGovernment  has  given  assurance  that,  upon  completion  of  the  Program,  PIU  staff  will  be \nintegrated into ARS to implement future projects. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Preparation and Appraisal \n\n39. \nThe Program will follow MFF implementation procedures. For Project 1, pre-construction \nactivities  have  been  completed,  and  resettlement  activities  will  be  completed  prior  to  the \ncommencement  of  civil  works.  For  subsequent  projects,  ARS,  with  the  assistance  of  the \nprogram  support  consultants,  will  prepare  (i)  the  project  report,  including  technical,  economic, \nenvironmental, and social assessments; and (ii) a PFR for each project. The project report will \nbe  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  criteria  and  procedures  stated  in  Schedule  4  of  the  FFA, \nand other related requirements of the Government and ADB. After appraising each project for \ntechnical and economic feasibility and compliance with safeguard requirements, ARS will submit \nto ADB, through the Ministry of Transport, a summary appraisal report in the format specified in \nthe  Program  administration  memorandum,  and  the  draft  PFR.  ADB  will  then  undertake  due \ndiligence in accordance with its relevant policies and procedures, and approve ARS\u2019s appraisal, \nsubject to any amendments. If required by ADB, ARS will amend the PFR and submit it to ADB \nfor  approval  on  or  before  the  due  date  of  the  PFR.  Meanwhile,  ARS  will  make  advance \ncontracting as approved by ADB to expedite project implementation. \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n40. \nThe  Program  will  be  implemented  over  7  years,  to  be  completed  at  the  end  of  2014. \nProject 1 will be implemented over 3 years, with estimated completion by 31 December 2009. \nARS  will  prepare  detailed  implementation  schedules  for  subsequent  projects.  An  indicative \nimplementation schedule for the Program and a detailed implementation schedule for Project 1 \nare in Appendix 8. \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n41. \nADB-financed  goods  and  services  will  be  procured  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). International competitive bidding procedures \nwill  be  followed  for  contracts  with  an  amount  above  $3  million  for  civil  works  and  at  least  $1 \nmillion  for  goods.  The  upper  limit  for  a  civil  works  contract  to  be  procured  through  national \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  will  be  set  at  $3  million.  National  competitive  bidding  will  be \nconducted  under  Azerbaijan\u2019s  legislation  on  state  procurement,  subject  to  modification  and \nclarification set forth in the individual loan agreements. A procurement plan for the Program is in \nAppendix 9. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n42. \nADB approved advance contracting of civil works under Project 1 on 22 June 2007. The \nGovernment  was  advised  that  ADB  approval  of  advance  contracting  does  not  commit  ADB  to \nfinance any ensuing project(s) from the MFF. \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nrequired \n\ntechnical, \n\nConsulting  services  will  be \n\n43. \nfor  capacity  development  and  project \nimplementation support. Key tasks include (i) construction supervision, (ii) monitoring of project \nperformance,  (iii)  preparation  of  subsequent  projects,  and  (iv)  capacity  development.  The \ncapacity  development  component  will  involve  the  establishment  of  a  management  unit \ncomprising  long-term  and  short-term  advisors.  This  team  will  define  a  detailed  work  plan; \nestablish  a  modern  and  efficient  management  information  system;  and  cater  for  planning, \nreforms, \nfiduciary  oversight,  safeguards,  and  other  matters  connected  with \nimplementation\u2014including reporting, monitoring, and evaluation. \n \nProject 1 will require a total of 860 person-months (182 international and 678 national) of \n44. \nservices from consulting firms. This comprises (i) 766 person-months (146 international and 620 \nnational)  for  construction  supervision,  project  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  preparation  of \nProject  2;  (ii)  70  person-months  (30  international  and  40  national)  for  strengthening  the \ndatabase  for  secondary  roads;  and  (iii)  24  person-months  (6  international  and  18  national)  for \ndeveloping  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks  and  operational  procedures  for  toll  roads.  Outline \nterms  of  reference  for  consultants  are  in  Supplementary  Appendixes  A,  B,  and  C.  Additional \nconsulting  services,  if  necessary,  will  be  procured  under  subsequent  projects.  The  consulting \nservices  will  be  financed  from  ADB  loans.  ARS  will  select  and  engage  the  consultants  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime) using the quality- and cost-based selection method. \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n45. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the project(s) under the Program. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and bidding documents for the Program. In particular, all contracts financed by \nADB in connection with the Program shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of ARS and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Program. \n \nThe Government and ARS agreed to take additional measures to improve governance, \n46. \naccountability,  and  transparency  under  the  MFF.  These  measures  include  (i)  independent \nexternal  auditing  of  contracts,  project  accounts,  and  financial  statements;  (ii)  decisions  of  all \nprocurement-related matters by the Tendering Committee, which comprises representatives of \nthe Ministry of Economic Development, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Transport, and the State \nProcurement  Agency  (as  observer)  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines;    (iii) \nverification  of  contractors\u2019  payment  claims  by  the  supervision  consultant  in  accordance  with \ncontract specifications; and (iv) timely disclosure of information on selection of consultants and \ncontractors through local newspapers. \n \n\n\f \n\n 13\n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n47. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). The last disbursements under the MFF will be \nmade  by  31  December  2014.  To  reduce  cash  flow  difficulties  in  ARS  and  facilitate  project \nimplementation,  the  imprest  account  procedures  described  in  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook  will  be  followed.  An  imprest  account  will  be  established  at  the  central  bank  or  a \ncommercial  bank  in  Azerbaijan  acceptable  to  ADB  after  the  loan  effectiveness,  and  will  be \nliquidated and replenished in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The total \nadvance will not exceed ADB\u2019s estimated share of eligible project expenditures to be financed \nthrough  the  imprest  account  for  the  next  6  months,  or  10%  of  the  amount  of  the  loan  from \nSpecial  Funds  resources,  whichever  is  lower.  For  simplified  documentation,  the  statement  of \nexpenditure procedures, as described in the Loan Disbursement Handbook, will be followed to \nreimburse expenditures and liquidate the imprest account for any individual payment transaction \nof $100,000 equivalent and below. \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n48. \nThe  Ministry  of  Transport  and  ARS  agreed  to  adhere  to  sound  financial  management \nrequirements  during  implementation  of  the  Program.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  and  ARS  will \nmaintain separate project records and accounts adequate to identify the (i) goods and services \nfinanced from the loan proceeds, (ii) financing resources received, (iii) expenses incurred on the \ncomponents  of  each  project,  and  (iv)  use  of  counterpart  funds.  ARS  will  engage  independent \nexternal auditors acceptable to ADB to audit project accounts and financial statements annually, \nand  will  arrange  a  periodic  or  annual  audit  of  statement  of  expenditure  transactions.  ARS  will \nsubmit  to  ADB  certified  copies  of  audited  annual  project  accounts  and  related  financial \nstatements as well as the auditor\u2019s report in English within 6 months of the end of each fiscal \nyear  during  implementation.  ARS  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  requirement  for  timely  submission  of \naudited annual project accounts and financial statements, and the suspension of disbursements \nof ADB loans in case of noncompliance with the requirement. \n \n49. \nARS  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  progress  reports  for  individual  projects, \nwhich  will  include  (i)  a  narrative  description  of  progress  made  during  the  reporting  period,  (ii) \nchanges  in  the  implementation  schedule,  (iii)  problems  or  difficulties  encountered,  and  (iv) \nactivities to be undertaken in the next reporting period. ARS will prepare and submit to ADB a \nproject  completion  report  within  3  months  of  the  completion  of  each  project,  and  a  program \ncompletion report after completion of all projects under the Program. \n \n\n9. \n\nPerformance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nA  set  of  targets  and  indicators  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  program  performance \n50. \nwere discussed with the Government during fact-finding (key performance targets and indicators \nare provided in Appendix 1). ARS  will (i) engage consultants for monitoring and evaluation by \nDecember 2007; (ii) collect additional data from relevant agencies, including local governments \nand  statistics  bureaus,  to  measure  the  performance  indicators  at  inception,  completion,  and  3 \nyears after completion of each project and the Program; and (iii) report to ADB key findings on a \nquarterly basis. ARS, with the assistance of the PIU and the supervision consultant, will monitor \nand evaluate program impacts to ensure that the program facilities are managed effectively and \nthe program benefits maximized. ADB  Management will prepare periodic reports to inform the \nBoard of overall progress. A Board information report will be submitted annually, and progress \nreports will be submitted to inform the Board of the approval of loans for subsequent projects. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n10. \n\nReviews \n\n51. \nADB will field an inception mission within 3 months of the loan approval for each project, \nand  a  review  mission  annually.  The  Government  and  ADB  will  jointly  undertake  a  midterm \nreview of Project 1 in 2008 and a midterm review of the Program in 2010. The timing of midterm \nreviews of subsequent projects will be agreed during the appraisal of each project. The midterm \nreviews  will  focus  on  (i)  program  impacts;  (ii)  implementation  progress;  (iii)  road  subsector \nreform  and  performance;  (iv)  performance  of  consultants  and  contractors;  (v)  status  of \ncompliance  with  the  covenants  stipulated  in  the  FFA  and  individual  loan  agreements;  and  (vi) \nthe  need  for  any  midcourse  changes  in  the  scope  or  schedule  of  the  Program  to  ensure  full \nachievement of its impact. \n \n\nIV. \n\nINVESTMENT PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits \n\n52. \nThe Program will bring benefits to road users, road construction companies, traders, and \nother people who derive income from expanded road traffic and trade in Azerbaijan. The direct \nbenefits from the improved road network include (i) lower road transport and maintenance costs, \n(ii) faster and more reliable road transport services, (iii) reduced traffic accidents, (iv) improved \naccess to markets and social services, and (v) jobs and income created during implementation \n(i.e., use of local labor and construction materials) and after completion (i.e., roadside business \nactivities).  The  direct  benefits  will  initially  accrue  to  vehicle  owners  and  operators  and  road \nconstruction  companies,  but  will  be  gradually  shared  with  passengers  and  freight  customers \nthrough reduced bus fares and freight charges. While Azerbaijan is the major beneficiary, other \ncountries in the region may also benefit from the Program through efficient movements of transit \ntraffic  via  Azerbaijan.  The  indirect  benefits  of  the  Program,  which  are  expected  to  become \ntangible after the completion of Project 1, include (i) improved road network management, and \n(ii)  increased  business  activities  and  jobs  that  have  forward  or  backward  linkages  to  road \nnetwork development. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n53. \nEconomic  analysis  of  all  projects  financed  under  the  MFF  will  be  conducted  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects. 18  The  economic \nanalysis  for  Project  1  is  in  Appendix  10.  It  was  based  on  a  comparison  of  with-  and  without-\nproject cases and covers a period of 20 years (2008\u20132027), comprising 2 years of construction \nand 18 years of operation. On the basis of projected growth of GDP per capita and population, \nas  well  as  the  estimated  income  elasticity  of  demand  in  Azerbaijan,  traffic  on  the  new \nexpressway between Masalli and Astara was projected to grow at 8.3% annually, with average \ndaily traffic increasing from about 4,000 vehicles in 2008 to 20,300 vehicles in 2027. \n \n54. \nThe major benefits of Project 1 are savings on vehicle operating costs and travel time, \nand reduced traffic accidents caused by improved road conditions and the shorter length of the \nnew  expressway  after  project  completion.  The  new  expressway  will  have  an  average \ninternational  roughness  index  (IRI)  value  of  2.5,  compared  with  the  IRI  value  of  11.0  for  the \nexisting road between Masalli and Astara in 2006. Savings on vehicle operating costs and travel \ntime were calculated using the highway design and maintenance 4 (HDM4) model, which shows \n\n                                                 \n18 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n\f \n\n 15\n\nthat  Project 1  will  lead  to  savings  on  vehicle  operating  costs  per  km  of  11%  for  cars,  14%  for \nheavy  trucks,  and  around  20%  for  articulated  trucks.  Project  1  will  also  result  in  savings  on \ntravel time between Masalli and Astara of about 60% for all types of vehicles, and contribute to \nreducing the number of road traffic accidents by half. \n \n55. \nThe  economic  analysis  shows  that  Project  1  is  economically  viable,  with  an  estimated \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  12.8%  and  an  estimated  net  present  value  of  $7.0 \nmillion at a 12% discount rate. A sensitivity analysis confirms the economic viability of Project 1, \nwith the EIRR higher than 12% when operation and maintenance costs increase by 20%. The \nEIRR figures are marginally lower than 12% when (i) project implementation extends by 1 year, \n(ii) capital costs increase by 10%, (iii) traffic growth decrease by 10%, and (iv) project benefits \ndecrease  by  10%.  However,  these  figures  are  deemed  within  an  acceptable  range.  The  risk \nanalysis  shows  that  Project  1  has  93%  probability  of  having  an  EIRR  higher  than  12%  and  a \npositive net present value. \n \nC. \n\nFinancial Management and Sustainability \n\n56. \nFinancial analysis will be conducted for projects financed under the MFF, if necessary, in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects.19  Project  1  is  not  a \nrevenue-earning  project  and  does  not  require  a  financial  analysis.  A  financial  management \nassessment of ARS was undertaken based on questionnaires and field interviews to assess its \nability to fulfill ADB's fiduciary requirements for the Program. ARS\u2019s financial management was \nfound  acceptable,  although  further  improvement  is  needed.  ARS  received  World  Bank \nassistance in developing a corporate plan and financial reporting and procedures manual, and \nEBRD  assistance  in  implementing  the  corporate  plan.  With  external  assistance,  ARS  has \nimproved  its  capacity  of  managing  implementation  of  aid-funded  projects.  Under  Project  1, \nexternal  independent  auditing  of  contracts,  accounts,  and  financial  statements  will  be \nundertaken to ensure fiduciary oversight. \n \n57. \nAnalysis was undertaken to assess the Government\u2019s counterpart funding for, and debt \nrepayment  from,  Project  1.  The  Government  is  committed  to  timely  provision  of  the  required \ncounterpart  funding  during  implementation  of  Project  1.  Azerbaijan\u2019s  external  debt  situation \nremains moderate and its debt repayment capacity is strong. At the end of 2006, the total stock \nof public and publicly guaranteed external debt amounted to $1.9 billion (15% of GDP) and the \ndebt service ratio accounted for 1.1% of exports of goods and services. Fitch Ratings upgraded \nAzerbaijan\u2019s  sovereign  rating  to  \u201cBB+\u201d  from  \u201cBB\u201d  for  long-term  foreign  currency  and  local \ncurrency  credit  in  February  2007.  With  Azerbaijan\u2019s  strong  medium-term  macroeconomic \noutlook, the MFF is expected to have a limited impact on the debt situation in the country. \n \nD. \n\nEnvironmental Impact \n\n58. \nEnvironmental assessment will be conduced for all projects financed under the MFF in \naccordance  with  the  Environmental  Assessment  and  Review  Framework  prepared  by  the \nGovernment and agreed with ADB in compliance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) as well \nas  relevant  laws  and  regulations  in  Azerbaijan.  Project  1  is  classified  category  A.  An \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) of Project 1 was undertaken, and is being approved by \nthe  Ministry  of  Ecology  and  Natural  Resources.  The  SEIA  was  circulated  to  the  Board  and \npublicly  disclosed  through  the  ADB  website  on  16  January  2007.  The  environmental \nassessment and review framework for the Program is included in the SEIA. The EIA concludes \n\n                                                 \n19 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\nthat the overall environmental impacts of Project 1 will be insignificant and can be minimized by \nadequate mitigation measures included in the environmental management plan. \n \n59. \nProject 1 is located far from the protected areas\u2014Hirkan National Park and Astara Chay \nImportant Bird Area\u2014and is thus expected to have no impacts on them. It will neither block any \nknown animal migration trails, nor intersect any known protected species of flora or fauna along \nthe  alignment.  Bridge  contractors  will  avoid  substructure  (foundation)  work  during  any  known \nspawning season for the rivers that the project expressway traverses. No historical, cultural, or \narchaeological sites are within or near the project area. Although some trees will be cut from the \nsecondary growth Moscow Forest, civil works contracts will be mandated to replant trees. If the \nexpressway noise exceeds local standards, linear sound barriers and insulated windows will be \nused to mitigate the noise impacts. Complete fencing on both sides of the expressway between \nMasalli  and  Astara,  coupled  with  improved  signage  and  controlled  access,  will  substantially \nimprove  safety  for  local  residents.  The  overall  risks  on  the  environment  under  Project  1  are \nconsidered manageable. \n \nE. \n\nPoverty and Social Impacts \n\n60. \nPoverty and social analysis will be conducted for all projects financed under the MFF in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Handbook for Integrating Poverty Impact Assessment in the Economic \nAnalysis  of  Projects.20  A  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  for  Project  1  is  in \nAppendix  11.  The  project  expressway  will  traverse  three  rayons  (districts)\u2014Masalli,  Lenkaran, \nand Astara\u2014with a total population of 790,700. About 70% of the households in the project area \nlived below the poverty line in 2006, compared with the official poverty rate of about 20% for the \ncountry.  While  the  direct  benefits  of  the  project  expressway  for  the  poor  are  relatively  small, \nProject  1  will  create  an  enabling  environment  for  poverty  reduction,  which  will  generate \nsubstantially  indirect  benefits  for  the  poor.  The  overall  (both  direct  and  indirect)  poverty \nreduction impacts of Project 1 include (i) reduced prices of transport services, food, and other \ndaily  necessities  because  of  lower  transport  costs;  (ii)  jobs  and  income  generated  from \nconstruction and maintenance of the project expressway; and (iii) improved access to markets \nand social services. \n \nThe Program will have a positive impact on gender, because the civil works contracts will \n61. \ninclude provisions to encourage employment of women during implementation, and women will \nbe encouraged to participate in activities to monitor program impacts. The PIU will develop and \nimplement a gender plan, with the assistance of the supervision consultants. \n \n62. \nAll  projects  financed  under  the  MFF  will  include  appropriate  measures  to  mitigate  the \npotential risk of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections, as well as drug and human \ntrafficking. These measures include raising public awareness of the risks of HIV/AIDS and other \nsexually transmitted infections, as well as drug and human trafficking. Civil works contracts will \ninclude provisions requiring contractors to take measures to protect construction workers from \nthe risks of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections, and giving construction workers \ntime to be tested or receive treatment. \n \nF. \n\nSocial Safeguards \n\n63. \nThe  impact  on  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  will  be  assessed  for  all  projects \nfinanced  under  the  MFF  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement  framework  prepared  by  the \n\n                                                 \n20  ADB. 2001. Handbook for Integrating Poverty Impact Assessment in the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n\f \n\n 17\n\nGovernment  and  agreed  with  ADB  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy \n(1995)  and  relevant  laws  and  regulations  in  Azerbaijan.  Substantial  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  impacts  are  expected  for  the  projects  that  will  involve  construction  of  new  roads. \nThe  resettlement  framework  was  prepared,  which  specifies  compensation  provisions  and \nprocedures  on  preparation  and  implementation  of  resettlement  plans  for  the  projects  financed \nunder  the  MFF.  The  resettlement  framework  is  summarized  in  Appendix  12  and  provided  in \nSupplementary Appendix D. \n \nProject 1 is classified category A, because construction of the new expressway between \n64. \nMasalli  and  Astara  entails  significant  land  acquisition.  The  Resettlement  Plan  for  the  core \nsubproject\u2014Section A of the Masalli\u2013Astara expressway (km 0\u2013km 22.1)\u2014was prepared and is \nin Supplementary Appendix E. The drafts of the resettlement framework and the Resettlement \nPlan for Section A of Project 1 are found satisfactory. The Ministry of Transport endorsed these \ntwo draft resettlement documents and disclosed them to affected persons on 11 June 2007. The \nresettlement  plans  for  all  non-core  subprojects  with  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts \n(i.e.,  sections  B  and  C  of  the  Masalli\u2013Astara  expressway)  are  being  prepared  in  accordance \nwith  the  resettlement  framework,  and  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval  and  fully \nimplemented before the awards of concerned civil works contracts. Appraisal of the subsequent \nprojects  financed  under  the  MFF  will  require  reviewing  the  resettlement  framework  and \npreparing resettlement plans for those projects with land acquisition and resettlement impacts. \nImplementation  of  the  resettlement  plans  will  be  a  condition  for  commencement  of  civil  works \nunder the relevant projects. \n \n65. \nAn  assessment  of  impact  on  indigenous  peoples  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998).  The  Program  will  primarily  affect  Azeri  people, \nthough some scattered members of other ethnic groups\u2014particularly Talysh\u2014may be affected. \nAs  Talysh  people  have  the  same  rights  as  other  Azerbaijan  groups  and  have  been  fully \nintegrated into institutional, cultural, and economic processes in the country, they do not display \nsufficient features to classify them indigenous peoples. The Program is classified category C. \n \nG. \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\nThe  Program  was  designed  based  on  the  following  key  assumptions:  (i)  continued \n66. \npolitical  and  macroeconomic  stabilities  in  Azerbaijan,  (ii)  effective  implementation  of  the  State \nProgram  on  Poverty  Reduction  and  Economic  Development,  (iii)  the  Government\u2019s  continued \ncommitment to regional cooperation, (iv) the Government\u2019s commitment to implement the road \nmap and the Program, and (v) adequate financing. \n \n67. \nRisks to the Program include (i) limited coordination among government agencies during \nimplementation,  (ii)  rapid  deterioration  of  the  road  network  caused  by  weak  axle-load  controls \nand  insufficient  funding  for  maintenance,  (iii)  delays  in  preparation  and  implementation  of \nsubsequent  projects,  and  (iv)  cost  overruns  caused  by  unexpected  increases  in  prices  of  fuel \nand raw materials. The Government has taken the necessary measures to minimize these risks. \nThe steering committee will coordinate work of the agencies to ensure that issues are resolved \npromptly and that these agencies extend concerted support for the Program. The Government \nis  committed,  through  the  Ministry  of  Transport,  to  enforce  axle-load  controls  and  further \nincrease  funding  for  road  maintenance.  ADB,  together  with  its  partners,  will  provide  continued \nsupport to ARS to strengthen its capacity for road network management. Adequate consulting \nservices  are  provided  to  help  prepare  subsequent  projects,  manage  implementation,  monitor \nperformance, and report to ADB. Price contingency funds are included in the MFF to respond to \nunforeseen cost changes. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n68. \nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  ARS  have  given  the \nfollowing  assurances,  and  assurances  agreed  to  in  the  FFA,  which  will  be  incorporated  in  the \nlegal documents: \n \n\nConstruction  Quality.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  will  ensure  that  the  projects  and \nsubprojects  financed  under  the  MFF  comply  with  technical  specifications  of  the \ndesign.  The  Ministry  of  Transport,  through  ARS,  will  ensure  that  construction \nsupervision,  quality  control,  and  project  management  are  performed  according  to \ninternationally accepted standards and practices. \n\nRoad  Maintenance.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  will  cause  ARS  to  develop  in \nconsultation  with  ADB  and  approve  a  road  maintenance  plan  for  2008\u20132015  by  30 \nSeptember  2008,  which  will  (i)  establish  a  system  for  efficient  planning  and \nprioritization of road maintenance works; (ii) provide funding modalities to finance the \nmaintenance  of  relevant  roads  acceptable  to  ADB,  (iii)  develop  or  adopt  adequate \nroad  maintenance  standards  and  prepare  relevant  road  maintenance  planning  and \noperational  manuals;  and  (iv)  provide  training  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  local \nmaintenance units. The Ministry of Transport will ensure that the road maintenance \nplan  is  implemented.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  will  use  its  best  efforts  to  enter  in \n2009 into a maintenance concession with a private sector entity for at least 20 km of \nthe local roads financed under tranche 1 of the MFF. The Ministry of Transport will \ncause ARS to submit the bidding documents and the concession framework to ADB \nby the end of 2008. \n\nRoad  Safety.  At  least  6  months  prior  to  the  start  of  operation  of  the  expressway \nfinanced  under  tranche  1  of  the  MFF,  (i)  the  Ministry  of  Transport  will  develop  and \nimplement  a  plan,  acceptable  to  ADB,  for  ensuring  safe  operation  of  road \ninfrastructure  facilities;  and  (ii)  Azerbaijan  acting  through  relevant  government \nagencies will ensure that traffic police patrols the road and enforces the national laws \nand  regulations.  ARS  will  ensure  monitoring  of  the  accident  rate  and  traffic  volume \nafter  commencement  of  the  operation  of  the  roads  financed  under  the  MFF  and \ninstitute  appropriate  safety  enforcement  measures.  Azerbaijan  acting  through \nrelevant government agencies will ensure strict border control to prevent trafficking of \nhumans and illegal substances on the roads financed under the MFF. \n\nAxle  Loads.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  will  ensure  that  ARS  establishes  vehicle \nweighing  station(s)  within  the  expressway  financed  under  tranche  1  of  the  MFF  to \ncontrol  axle  overloading  and  institute  appropriate  procedures  and  regulations  to \nenforce axle load controls by the completion of the relevant project or subproject. \n\nTolling. At least 6 months prior to the start of operation of the expressway financed \nunder  tranche  1  of  the  MFF,  ARS  will  provide  ADB  with  the  Ministry  of  Transport-\nendorsed  framework  and  definitive  plan  for  establishing  tolling  roads  along  any \nexpressway road financed under the MFF. By mid 2010, ARS will review and inform \nADB  of  any  significant  difficulties  in  establishing  tolls  on  expressways  under \nAzerbaijan\u2019s laws and regulations. \n\n\f \n\n(vi) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChange in Ownership and Operation. In the event that (i) any change in ownership \nof the road, road facility, or structure financed under the MFF; (ii) any sale, transfer, \nor  assignment  of  interest  or  control  in  the  road,  road  facility,  or  structure  financed \nunder the MFF; or (iii) any lease or other contract or modification of the functions and \nauthority of the Ministry of Transport or ARS over operation and maintenance of any \nroad, road facility, or structure financed under the MFF, is anticipated, the Ministry of \nTransport  will  ensure  that  ADB\u2019s  consent  is  obtained  at  least  6  months  prior  to  the \nimplementation  of  such  a  plan.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  will  ensure  that  any  such \nchanges will be carried out in a legal and transparent manner. \n\n(vii) \n\nVehicle  Emissions. At least 6 months prior to the start of operation of the Masalli\u2013\nAstara expressway financed under tranche 1 of the MFF, ARS, jointly with concerned \ngovernment agencies, will provide to ADB Azerbaijan\u2019s emission standards and the \npenalties for infringement of such standards. Azerbaijan will ensure that through the \nrelevant agencies the said vehicle emission standards are enforced. \n\n(viii)  Policy  Dialogue.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  and  ARS  will  ensure  that  ADB  is  kept \ninformed of Azerbaijan\u2019s policies and programs related to the road subsector that will \nmaterially  affect  the  economic  viability  of  each  project,  subproject,  or  component \nfinanced under the MFF. \n\nEnvironment. The Ministry of Transport will ensure that (i) all roads or road facilities \nand  structures  financed  under  the MFF  are  designed, constructed,  and  operated in \naccordance  with  Azerbaijan\u2019s  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  ADB\u2019s  Environment \nPolicy  and  the  EIA;  (ii)  any  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  minimized  by  the \nmitigating  measures  and  monitoring  program  detailed \nthe  environmental \nmanagement  plan  (EMP)  in  the  EIA;  (iii)  implementation  of  the  EMP  and  any \nin \nviolation  of  environmental  standards  are  reported \naccordance  with  the  specifications  set  forth  in  the  EIA;  and  (iv)  the  EMP  is \nincorporated in bidding documents and bills of quantities of the civil work contracts. \n\nto  ADB  semiannually \n\nin \n\nLand  Acquisition  and  Resettlement.  The  Ministry  of  Finance,  assisted  by  the \nMinistry  of  Transport,  will  ensure  that  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  are  carried \nout  promptly  and  efficiently  in  a  legal  and  transparent  manner  following  the \nresettlement framework and resettlement plans agreed with ADB and in accordance \nwith  Azerbaijan\u2019s  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy. \nARS  will  ensure  that  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plans  is  monitored, \nevaluated, and reported to ADB as required in the resettlement plans. \n\nLabor,  Social,  Gender  and  Development,  Health.  The  Ministry  of  Transport, \nthrough ARS, will ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development \n(1998)  during  implementation  of  the  Program  and  will  take  necessary  steps  to \nencourage women living in the area of MFF-financed projects to participate in such \nproject implementation, including causing the contractors to maximize employment of \nwomen. The Ministry of Transport will ensure an independent monitoring of the social \nimpacts \nlocal \ngovernments and beneficiaries.

As Azerbaijan \nis located in the southeastern part of the Caucasus between Iran and the Russian Federation, \nthe  transport  sector  contributes  significantly  to  regional  cooperation,  and  facilitates  the \ndevelopment of international trade and transit traffic. The transport sector is also crucial to the \ndomestic economy as it links the rural population to urban and international markets. \n \n2. \nThe  transport  sector  comprises  railways,  roads,  civil  aviation,  maritime  transport,  and \npipelines. Roads are the dominant mode of passenger transport, carrying 74% of passengers in \npassenger-kilometers  (km)  (Table  A2.1).  Civil  aviation  accounts  for  11%,  urban  transport  for \n9%, and railways for 6%. Freight is mainly carried by railways (36% of the total volume in ton-\nkm),  followed  equally  by  roads  and  maritime  transport  (28%).  Although  the  freight  volume \ncarried by railways is larger than by roads, the volume carried by roads increased more rapidly \nthan other modes of transport. While the total volume of freight increased by 218% from 1995 to \n2005, the volume carried by roads increased by 1,330% during the same period. \n \n\nTable A2.1: Freight and Passenger Transport by Mode \n\nTransport Mode \n \nRailways \nRoads \nMaritime \nAir \nPipelines \n \n\nTotal \n\n \nRailways \nRoads \nMaritime \nAir \nUrban Transporta\n \n\n1990 \n\n2000 \nFreight Transport (million ton-km) \n\n1995 \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n37,076 \n3,287 \n5,778 \n47 \n3,353 \n49,541 \n\n1,827 \n7,480 \n68 \n4,869 \n1,721 \n15,965 \n\n2,409 \n527 \n4,325 \n57 \n1,013 \n8,331 \n\n791 \n4,664 \n24 \n1,733 \n1,401 \n8,613 \n\n5,770 \n3,513 \n5,192 \n102 \n1,371 \n15,948 \n\n493 \n9,153 \n6 \n798 \n917 \n11,367 \n\n7,719 \n6,241 \n6,555 \n204 \n1,572 \n22,291 \n\n654 \n9,861 \n6 \n1,113 \n954 \n12,588 \n\n7,536 \n6,965 \n6,771 \n315 \n1,696 \n23,283 \n\n789 \n9,603 \n7 \n1,450 \n1,965 \n13,814 \n\n9,628 \n7,536 \n7,521 \n310 \n1,539 \n26,534 \n\n878 \n10,892 \n7 \n1,588 \n1,382 \n14,747 \n\nPassenger Transport (million passenger-km) \n\nTotal \nkm = kilometer. \na    Including tram, trolley, and subway. \nSource: State Statistical Committee of the Republic of Azerbaijan. 2006. Transport Statistical Yearbook. Baku. \n \n3. \nWith  the  breakup  of  the  former  Soviet  Union  in  the  early  1990s  and  the  subsequent \ndisruption  in  interlinked  transport  operations  across  the  region,  transport  volumes  fell \nsignificantly  in  Azerbaijan.  Traffic  volumes  have  recovered  over  the  last  10  years,  but  they \nremain below those in the 1980s. With the continued economic growth, transport volumes are \nprojected to further revive over the medium term, increasing the transport sector\u2019s importance to \nthe development in the country. \n \n4. \nLike  other  sectors  in  Azerbaijan,  the  transport  sector  is  in  transition  from  a  centrally \nplanned to a market-based system, and faces a number of challenges. With Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  assistance,  the  Ministry  of  Transport  prepared  a  transport  sector  development \n\n \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nRoad Infrastructure \n\nstrategy  in  response  to  the  challenges  in  June  2006. 1  The  strategy  identified  five  strategic \npriorities for transport sector development for the medium term: (i) development of a regulatory \nframework, (ii) development of transport infrastructure, (iii) development of the transport service \nmarkets, (iv) improvement of transport safety, and (v) facilitation of transit traffic. \n \nB. \n \n5. \nThe road network comprises 25,013 km of roads, of which 4,498 km are in the Nagorno-\nKarabakh area and 2,078 km are in the Nakhchivan Autonomous area (Table A2.2). The road \nnetwork  is  dominated  by  two  major  highways:  the  east\u2013west  highway  linking  the  country\u2019s \ncapital,  Baku,  to  the  Georgian  border;  and  the  north\u2013south  highway  running  from  the  Russian \nborder  to  the  Iranian  border  through  Baku.  In  terms  of  ownership,  the  roads  are  divided  into \nstate  and  municipal  roads.  The  state  roads  consist  of  1,531  km  of  M-roads  (main  roads  and \ntheir feeders) and 5,485 km of A-roads (access roads and their feeders), while the total length of \nmunicipal roads is 17,997 km. Only 191 km are four-lane highways. Approximately 51% of the \nroads (including all M-roads) are paved and 49% gravel. \n \n\nTable A2.2: Summary of the Road Network, 2005 \n(kilometers) \n\nTotal \n\nState Road \n\nA-road \n3,563 \n857 \n1,065 \n5,485 \n22 \n\nM-road \n1,531 \n0 \n0 \n1,531 \n6 \n\nTotal \n \n18,437 \n2,078 \n4,498 \n25,013 \n100 \n\nPercent of  \nTotal \n74 \n8 \n18 \n100 \n \n\nArea \nMunicipal \n \nRoad \nAzerbaijan (main) \n13,343 \nNaknchivan \n1,221 \nNagorno-Karabakh area \n3,433 \n \n17,997 \n% \n72 \nSource: AzerRoadService Open Joint-Stock Company, Ministry of Transport. \n \nThe  road  network  was  primarily  developed  under  the  former  Soviet  Union.  Because  of \n6. \ninsufficient  funding  for  road  maintenance,  about  75%  of  the  road  network  is  in  poor  to  bad \ncondition. Based on the road condition data available, the major highways have an international \nroughness  index  (IRI)  of  6\u201310,  and  about  70%  of  A-roads  require  rehabilitation.  Many  roads \nhave to be first reconstructed or rehabilitated so that they can be maintainable. The poor road \nconditions resulted in high transport costs and low safety levels. \n \n7. \nIn recognition of this, the Government has set improvement of road infrastructure as one \nof  the  priorities  in  the  State  Program  on  Poverty  Reduction  and  Economic  Development \n(SPPRED)  for  2003\u221220052  and  embarked  on  a  transport  development  program  (2005\u20132014), \nwhich starts with improvement of the east\u2013west and north\u2013south highways. The majority of the \neast\u2013west highway has been or is being improved with external assistance. The Ganja\u2013Qazakh \nsection  was  improved  with  World  Bank  assistance  in  November  2006.  The  sections  that  are \nexpected to be improved by 2008 include (i) the Hajigabul\u2013Kyurdamir section with assistance of \nthe European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and (ii) the Qazakh\u2013Georgian \nborder  section  and  Ganja  Bypass  with  ADB  assistance.  The  World  Bank  and  ADB  are  jointly \nhelping develop the southern highway, while EBRD and the Czech Export Bank are assisting in \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB  Technical  Assistance  Consultant  Report.  2006.

The  Government  is  also  finalizing  a  program  for  improving \nsecondary roads. \n \n8. \nMost  technical  standards  and  specifications  for  road  design,  construction,  and \nmaintenance  date  from  the  Soviet  era.  Although  the  standards  are  based  on  sound  technical \nprinciples,  they  contain  rigid  criteria  for  upgrading  road  capacity  that  are  based  on  traffic \nvolumes and do not consider the level of services or economic viability. The inappropriateness \nof  such  standards  for  a  market-based  economy  is  widely  recognized;  they  need  updated  to \nmatch the needs and economic resource base in the country. \n \nC. \n \nThe  motorization  rate  in  Azerbaijan  is  low  by  international  standards.  The  vehicle  fleet \n9. \nnumbered  about  612,000  in  2005,  including  around  480,000  cars,  91,000  trucks,  and  27,000 \nbuses (Table A2.3). This was equivalent to 73 vehicles per 1,000 people. About 70% of trucks \nand 50% of buses have been operating for over 10 years, with an inevitable effect on the level \nof service and the costs of operation. The vehicle fleet has recently grown rapidly at an annual \nrate of 10%. This trend is projected to gain further momentum with continued strong economic \ngrowth  in  the  country.  The  rapid  increase  in  vehicle  fleet  will  require  development  or \nimprovement of road infrastructure. Vehicle ownership varies regionally, with a national average \nof 26 vehicles per 100 families compared with nearly 35 vehicles in Baku. \n \n\nVehicle Fleet \n\nTable A2.3: Vehicle Fleet (\u2018000 units) \n\n \n\nVehicle Type \n\n1990 \n260.2 \n14.0 \n99.5 \n25.0 \n398.7 \n\n2004 \n439.0 \n21.0 \n80.9 \n13.1 \n554.0 \n\n2003 \n400.4 \n18.8 \n79.0 \n13.2 \n511.4 \n\n2005 \n479.4 \n26.7 \n90.9 \n15.0 \n612.0 \n\n1995 \n278.3 \n12.8 \n79.7 \n21.4 \n392.2 \n\n2000 \n332.0 \n16.8 \n78.6 \n13.3 \n440.7 \n\nTotal \n\nInstitutions \n\nCars \nBuses \nTrucks \nOther \n \nSource: State Statistical Committee of the Republic of Azerbaijan. 2006.

The  decree  also  outlines  the  basic  relations  between  stakeholders  in  the  road \nsubsector. \n \n11. \nPrior  to  2003,  Azeravtoyol,  a  state  company,  managed  the  road  subsector.  As \nAzeravtoyol  was  modeled  on  centralized  decision-making  processes,  bureaucracy,  and \nadministration procedures inherited from the former Soviet Union, it could not perform functions \nproperly.  As  a  result,  the  Government  dissolved  Azeravtoyol  and  established  the  Ministry  of \nTransport  to  assume  overall  responsibility  for  policy,  regulations,  and  administration  of  the \ntransport sector in 2003. The road network (excluding Nakhchivan)3 is under the responsibility of \nthe AzerRoadService Open Joint-Stock Company (ARS) under the Ministry of Transport, which \nwas  reorganized  from  the  Road  Transport  Service  Department  in  March  2007.  ARS  has \nheadquarters in Baku with 90 staff, and 61 rayon (district)-based units with approximately 3,000 \nstaff.

While  the  creation  of  ARS  to  replace  Azeravtoyol  was  a  major  achievement,  the \ninstitutional  capacity  in  the  road  subsector  remains  limited.  ARS  received  assistance  from  the \nWorld Bank for institutional strengthening during 2003\u20132005. The assistance covered 11 areas, \nwith  the  major  components  including  (i)  developing  a  corporate  plan,  (ii)  reviewing  road  user \ncharges,  (iii)  establishing  a  pavement  management  system,  (iv)  formulating  a  financial \nmanagement system, (v) developing a multiyear rolling budget and a multiyear road investment \nprogram, and (vi) preparing a traffic safety plan. As the first step toward sound governance in \nthe  road  subsector,  the  World  Bank  assistance  produced  a  number  of  recommendations. \nFurther external assistance is needed to strengthen the institutional capacity in the subsector by \nsupporting implementation of these recommendations. \n \n13. \nThe  Government  has  recently  taken  further  measures  to  enhance  the  institutional \ncapacity in the road subsector. A Motor Law was drafted and is currently being discussed at the \nCabinet  of  Ministers.  A  corporate  plan  was  developed,  which  includes  establishing  a  \u201cclient-\nsupplier\u201d  relationship  between  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and  ARS.  This  relationship  will  be \nformulated  through  a  service  agreement  supported  under  the  EBRD-assisted  project.  A  Road \nAdvisory Board will be established to enhance subsector governance. \n \nE. \n \n14.  With  the  abolishment  of  the  Road  Fund  in  2001,  the  road  subsector  was  financed \nprimarily  from  the  Government\u2019s  budget,  while  all  revenues  from  taxes  related  to  roads  were \ncredited  to  the  Government\u2019s  budgets.  The  Government  decided  to  restore  the  Road  Fund  in \nJanuary 2007, but it is too early to assess its performance. ARS\u2019s budget increased from $15.7 \nmillion  in  2003  to  $106.8  million in 2006.  The  2006  budget comprised  $45.2  million for  capital \ninvestment  (42.3%  of  the  total),  $55.5  million  for  road  maintenance  (52.0%),  $3.9  million  for \nadministration  (3.6%),  and  $2.2  million  for  planning  and  design  (2.1%)  (Table  A2.4).

The  World  Bank  assisted  ARS  in  developing  a  computerized  accounting \nsystem. Although equipment was purchased and staff training provided, ARS has yet to receive \nthe approval of the Ministry of Transport to implement the computerized accounting system. The \nWorld  Bank  also  prepared  a  manual  on  financial  management  for  ARS.  Further  external \nassistance is needed to strengthen ARS\u2019s capacity for financial management. \n \n\nTable A2.4: Budgetary Allocation to the Road Subsector, 2001\u20132006 ($ million) \n\n \n\nItem \nCapital Investment  \nRoad Maintenance \nRoutine Maintenance \n \nPeriodic Maintenance \n \n \nEquipment \nAdministration \nPlanning and Design  \nTotal \n \n\n \n\n2001 \n2.9 \n \n5.0 \n0.7 \n0.0 \n0.2 \n0.0 \n8.8 \n\n2002 \n3.2 \n \n4.3 \n1.3 \n0.0 \n0.2 \n0.0 \n9.0 \n\n2003 \n9.6 \n \n4.0 \n1.5 \n0.3 \n0.2 \n0.1 \n15.7 \n\n2004 \n1.9 \n \n7.0 \n7.3 \n0.0 \n0.4 \n0.0 \n16.6 \n\n2005 \n53.1 \n \n18.6 \n6.5 \n0.0 \n \n0.0 \n78.2 \n\n2006 \n45.2 \n \n31.1 \n22.2 \n2.2 \n3.9 \n2.2 \n106.8 \n\nRoad Maintenance \n\nSource: AzerRoadService Open Joint-Stock Company, Ministry of Transport. \n \nF. \n \n16. \nAzerbaijan  inherited  a  large  stock  of  road  infrastructure  from  the  former  Soviet  Union \nand  is  facing  the  challenge  of  properly  maintaining  the  road  network  with  limited  resources. \nHowever,  funding  for  road  maintenance  has  since  then  been  inadequate.  As  a  result,  a  large \npart  of  the  road  network  deteriorated  rapidly  and  has  become  non-maintainable.  While  ARS \nestimates  that  maintenance  costs  for  2006  were  about  $273  million  based  on  the  assumption \nthat  the  entire  road  network  is  maintainable,  ADB  staff  estimates  that  minimum  road \nmaintenance  costs  for  2006  were  $41  million,  partly  because  only  about  25%  of  the  road \nnetwork is currently maintainable and partly because the unit rates were estimated lower (Table \nA2.5).  In  recognition  that  the  transport  development  program  cannot  be  sustained  without \nadequate resources to properly maintain them, the Government significantly increased funding \nfor road maintenance from $5.7 million in 2001 to $55.5 million in 2006 (Table A2.4), and further \nto $90 million in 2007. It also plans to launch a road maintenance program in parallel with the \nroad  improvement.  The  program  envisages  a  steady  increase  in  the  maintainable  network  as \nroad  improvement  takes  place  and a  corresponding  increase  in  maintenance  funding  to  cover \nthe entire network by 2015. \n \n17. \nARS\u2019s 61 rayon-based maintenance units undertake road maintenance works on a force \naccount basis. Each unit is responsible for the main and secondary roads in an individual rayon, \nand  operates  using  its  own  labor  force  and  equipment.  However,  the  maintenance  units  are \ninefficient  because  of  lack  of  economic  scale  and  weak  management.  The  World  Bank \nrecommended  that  the  61  rayon-based  maintenance  units  be  restructured  into  4\u20135  regional \nmaintenance  units,  with  each  responsible  for  about  5,000  km  of  the  road  network.  It  also \nrecommended that periodic maintenance be undertaken through competitive bidding by private \nsector  contractors,  while  routine  maintenance  will  be  initially  undertaken  by  the  regional \nmaintenance  units,  and  be  gradually  open  to  private  sector  contractors.  ADB  and  EBRD  are \nassisting ARS in reorganizing regional maintenance units. \n\n \n\n\fTable A2.5: Annual Funding Requirements for Road Maintenance, 2006\u20132015 ($ million)a\n\nARS Assessment \n\nADB Staff Assessment \n\n28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nYear \n\n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n\nMaintainable \nNetwork \n25% \n35% \n50% \n60% \n70% \n80% \n85% \n90% \n95% \n100% \n\n273 \n287 \n301 \n316 \n332 \n348 \n366 \n384 \n403 \n424 \n\n41 \n48 \n57 \n65 \n75 \n85 \n93 \n101 \n110 \n120 \n\nRoad Safety \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, ARS = AzerRoadService Open Joint-Stock Company. \na  Adjusted with estimated annual inflation of 5%. \nSources: AzerRoadService Open Joint-Stock Company and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nARS  developed  a  pavement  management  system  with  World  Bank  assistance.  The \n18. \nsystem  provides  the  necessary  steps  of  the  planning  cycle  and  relies  on  the  highway  design \nand  maintenance  4  (HDM4)  model  for  prioritizing  the  network  for  utilization  of  available \nresources.  However,  ARS  needs  support  to  implement  the  system  by  conducting  annual \nsurveys on road network conditions and preparing and implementing annual maintenance plans \nbased on the outcome of the pavement management system. The World Bank will assist ARS \nto  develop  a  database  for  main  roads,  while  ADB  plans  to  help  establish  a  database  for \nsecondary roads. \n \nG. \n \n19. \nRoad safety has become an acute problem in Azerbaijan. After a gradual decline during \n1994\u20132000, the number of road traffic accidents, fatalities, and injuries has risen rapidly at an \nannual rate of 12.5% since 2001. There were 3,179 road traffic accidents in 2005, resulting in \n1,065  fatalities  and  3,668  injuries  (Table  A2.6).  The  fatality  rate  in  2005  was  174  per  10,000 \nvehicles,  or  roughly  10  times  the  fatality  rate  in  the  Nordic  European  countries.  Pedestrians \naccounted for 60% of casualties in urban areas, while passengers made up 50% of casualties in \nrural areas. The major causes of road traffic accidents are poor road conditions, lack of safety \nfeatures and facilities, weak enforcement of road safety regulations, intoxicated driving, excess \nspeed, and inadequate driver education. \n \n20. \nTwo  government  agencies  (i.e.,  Road  Traffic  Police  Department  of  the  Ministry  of \nInternal Affairs and ARS of the Ministry of Transport) are responsible for road safety. However, \neach  operates  largely  independently.  Although  the  National  Road  Safety  Commission \ncoordinates activities of the two agencies, it does not have executive or operational powers. \n \n21. \nTo  improve  road  safety,  the  Government  prepared  a  5-year  road  safety  program  with \nWorld  Bank  assistance.  The  key  recommendations  included  (i)  replacing  the  National  Road \nSafety Commission with a road safety board that has defined objectives, executive powers for \ntaking  actions  to  reduce  accidents,  adequate  funding,  and  a  permanent  secretariat;  (ii) \nstrengthening ARS\u2019s capability to identify and rectify accident black spots on the road network; \n(iii) establishing road accident monitoring, reporting, and information systems; (iv) reviewing and \nrevising,  if  necessary,  legislation  and  regulations  on  road  safety;  and  (v)  raising  public \nawareness  for  road  safety.  The  ADB-assisted  East\u2013West  Highway  Improvement  Project  is \nhelping  implement  the  road  safety  program;  develop  road  accident  monitoring,  reporting,  and \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n29\n\ninformation  systems;  identify  accident  black  spots  on  the  road  network;  and  provide  staff \ntraining. \n \n\nTable A2.6: Road Traffic Accidents \n\nYear \n1994 \n1995 \n1996 \n1997 \n1998 \n1999 \n2000 \n2001 \n2002 \n2003 \n2004 \n2005 \n\nRoad Accidents \n2,908 \n2,556 \n2,200 \n2,001 \n1,998 \n1,996 \n1,987 \n1,985 \n2,196 \n2,311 \n2,388 \n3,179 \n\nNumber of Deaths \n1,130 \n1,001 \n767 \n606 \n595 \n554 \n596 \n559 \n642 \n724 \n811 \n1,065 \n\nNumber of Injuries \n3,301 \n2,823 \n2,441 \n2,292 \n2,309 \n2,316 \n2,199 \n2,228 \n2,486 \n2,691 \n2,766 \n3,668 \n\nVehicle Axle-Load Control \n\nSource: State Statistical Committee of the Republic of Azerbaijan. 2006. Transport Statistical Yearbook. Baku. \n \nH. \n \nAzerbaijan  has  developed  regulations  to  limit  vehicle  axle  load  to  13  tons,  but \n22. \nenforcement is weak primarily because of limited institutional capacity and lack of vehicle weigh \nfacilities  along  the  main  roads.  As  a  result,  vehicle  axle  overloading  is  prevalent.  Surveys \nconducted showed that about 20% of 4-axle trucks, 5-axle trucks, and buses exceeded the axle-\nload  limit.  Heavy  vehicle  weights  are  one  of  the  primary  causes  of  rapid  pavements \ndeterioration.  The  enforcement  of  vehicle  axle-load  control  is  urgently  needed  to  prevent \npremature deterioration of the road network. \n \nIn  response,  the  Government  recently  decided  to  enforce  axle-load  regulations  by  (i) \n23. \nestablishing 12 vehicle weighing stations along main roads, where overloaded vehicles will be \nrequired  to  redistribute  or  unload  exceeded  freight;  and  (ii)  collecting  reliable  data  on  vehicle \naxle  loads  by  installing  permanent  \u201cweigh-in-motion\u201d  devices  at  key  points  along  the  road \nnetwork.  ADB  is  assisting  ARS  in  establishing  and  operating  vehicle  weigh  stations,  and \nimproving  monitoring  of  axle  overloading  under  the  East\u2013West  Highway  Improvement  Project, \nand will continue to do so under the proposed multitrache financing facility. \n \nI. \n \n24. \nThe  road  transport  service  market  is  almost  fully  liberalized  in  Azerbaijan.  The  private \nsector plays a key role in provision of road transport services, accounting for more than 95% of \nfreight  and  passenger  transport.  The  state-owned  road  transport  operators  were  largely \nprivatized and foreign road transport operators are allowed to set up business. Freight charges \nand bus fares for domestic road transport are determined based on market conditions, although \nthe Government is setting up tariffs and prices for urban passenger transport, and crossborder \nand  international  transit  traffic.  The  Government  has  recently  introduced  vehicle  licensing  to \nenhance axle-load control and improve road safety. \n\nRoad Transport Services \n\n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nChallenges \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \n \n\n(i) \n\nROAD SUBSECTOR ROAD MAP AND INVESTMENT PLAN \n\nAzerbaijan\u2019s road subsector faces four major development challenges: \n\nDeteriorating  infrastructure. The public road network was primarily developed \nunder the former Soviet Union, and cannot meet the need of the rapidly growing \neconomy.  Most  roads  are  in  poor  condition  because  of  insufficient  funding  for \nroad  maintenance,  and  weak  enforcement  of  vehicle  axle-load  controls.  As  a \nresult,  a  large  part  of  the  road  network  is  not  maintainable  and  needs \nreconstruction  or  rehabilitation.  The  poor  road  conditions  resulted  in  high \ntransport  costs,  long  travel  time,  and  low  safety  levels.  The  rapid  increase  in \nvehicle fleet, which is projected to continue over the medium term, would require \ndevelopment of the road network. \n\nPoor  safety  record.  Road  safety  is  an  acute  problem,  as  the  number  of  road \ntraffic accidents, fatalities, and injuries has increased rapidly since 2001, causing \nsignificant  economic  and  human  losses.  The  current  fatality  rate  is  around  10 \ntimes the fatality rate in the Nordic European countries. The major causes of road \naccidents are poor road conditions, lack of safety features, weak enforcement of \nsafety  regulations,  intoxicated  driving,  excess  speed,  and  inadequate  driver \neducation. With the rapid growth of vehicle fleet, there is potential for more road \ntraffic accidents in the future, unless remedial action is taken. \n\nInefficient  crossborder  and  transit  facilities.  Azerbaijan  is  a  signatory  to  a \nnumber  of  international  transit  and  transport  agreements  and  conventions. \nHowever, crossborder and transit road transport is inefficient, mainly because of \nfacilities,  as  well  as \ninadequate \nnonharmonized  procedures  with  neighboring  countries.  Surveys  showed  that \n80%  of  companies  experienced  delays  of  1\u22123  days  in  crossing  the  borders  of \nAzerbaijan.1 These barriers severely hinder crossborder and transit traffic. \n\ninfrastructure  and  crossborder \n\nroad \n\ninstitutional  capacity.  Despite  some \n\nLimited \ninstitutional \ncapacity in the road subsector remains limited. This is reflected by (a) lack of a \nlegal and regulatory framework for  tolling roads; (b) weak enforcement of some \nregulations;  (c)  lack  of  private  sector  participation  in  road  maintenance;  (d)  the \nneed \nin \nmanagement of road projects. Limited institutional capacity is a major constraint \non sustainable development of the road subsector. \n\nfinancial  management;  and  (e) \n\nlimited  experience \n\nimprovement, \n\nimprove \n\nto \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nDevelopment Strategy \n\n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  Government  has  set  improvement  of  road  infrastructure  as  one  of  the  priorities  in \ntwo  state  programs:  (i)  State  Program  on  Poverty  Reduction  and  Economic  Development \n(SPPRED),  and  (ii)  State  Program  on  Socioeconomic  Development  of  Regions.

The \neconomic  analysis  of  Project  1  covers  two  major  project  components:  construction  of  the  new \nexpressway  between  Masalli  and  Astara  and  rehabilitation  of  local  roads.  The  economic \nanalysis covers 2008\u20132027, comprising 2 years of construction and 18 years of operation. It is \nbased on a comparison of with- and without-project cases, and uses 2006 economic prices. \n \nB. \n \nTraffic on the new expressway between Masalli and Astara near the Iranian border was \n2. \nbased  on  traffic  surveys  on  the  existing  road  between  Alyat  and  Astara  conducted  by  the \nconsultants under the project preparatory technical assistance, supplemented by (i) surveys and \nanalysis from Passillo Engineering Consultants, (ii) regular traffic counts from  AzerRoadService \nOpen Joint-Stock Company (ARS)  under the Ministry of Transport, and (iii) spot traffic checks \nfrom  the  World  Bank  consultants  (for  the  Alyat\u2013Masalli  section).  The  results  of  the  traffic \nsurveys  are  summarized  in  Table  A10.1.  Four  major  findings  are  worth  mentioning.  First,  the \ncurrent level of traffic follows a decreasing trend from Alyat to Astara. The average daily traffic \nfell  from  about  7,000  vehicles  near  Alyat  to  about  5,000  vehicles  near  Masalli  and  further  to \naround 3,800 vehicles near Astara. Second, cars and jeeps account for about three quarters of \nthe  traffic,  while  heavy  vehicles  make  up  20%  of  the  traffic.  Third,  approximately  60%  of  the \ntraffic is local, with crossborder and international transit vehicles, either coming from or destined \nfor Iran or Turkey, accounting for about 5% of the total traffic. \n \n\nTable A10.1: Summary of Average Daily Traffic, 2006 \n\n% \n\nNear Masalli (km 242) \nNumber \n3,606 \n221 \n125 \n84 \n393 \n259 \n42 \n212 \n53 \n4,995 \n\nVehicle \n \nCar/Jeep \nMicrobus \nVan \nBig bus \nTruck 2 axles \nTruck 3 axles  \nTruck 4 axles \nTruck 5 axles \nTruck 6 axles \nTotal \n \nSources: Asian Development Bank staff and project preparatory technical assistance.  \n \n3. \nTraffic  demand  was  projected  based  on  projected  growth  of  gross  domestic  product \n(GDP)  per  capita  and  population,  as  well  as  the  estimated  income  elasticity  of  demand  in \nAzerbaijan. GDP was projected to grow at 9% annually for 2008\u20132012 and 8.1% for 2013\u20132027. \nThe annual growth rate of population was forecast to remain stable at 1%.

The  new  expressway  is  projected  to  attract  a  low \nvolume  of  generated  traffic  initially,  because  road  users  are  not  expected  to  significantly \nincrease their travel on the expressway. Once the reconstruction of the entire north\u2013south road \ncorridor  running  from  the  Russian  border  to  the  Iranian  border  through  Baku  is  completed, \ngenerated traffic is projected to grow rapidly. The expressway is also expected to result in little \ndiverted  traffic,  because  the  majority  of  the current  traffic  between  Masalli  and  Astara  is  local. \nAs  such,  traffic  projection  uses  the  diversion  rates  of  100%  for  international  traffic,  100%  for \ntraffic from/to Baku, 90% from through traffic from other origins and destinations, 50% for local \ntraffic  between  rayon  (district)  centers,  and  20%  for  local  traffic  within  the  same  rayon.  Traffic \nvolume  on  the  expressway  is  projected  to  grow  at  8.3%  annually,  with  average  daily  traffic \nincreasing from 4,040 vehicles in 2008 to 20,358 vehicles in 2027 (Table A10.2). \n \n\nTable A10.2: Traffic Projection for the Masalli\u2013Astara Expressway, 2008\u20132027 \n(number of vehicles per day) \n\nYear \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n2026 \n2027 \n\nNormal and Diverted Traffic \n4,040 \n4,408 \n4,811 \n5,249 \n5,728 \n6,192 \n6,694 \n7,236 \n7,822 \n8,456 \n9,141 \n9,881 \n10,681 \n11,547 \n12,482 \n13,480 \n14,559 \n15,724 \n16,981 \n18,340 \n\nGenerated Traffic \n0 \n0 \n505 \n551 \n601 \n650 \n702 \n759 \n821 \n887 \n959 \n1,037 \n1,121 \n1,211 \n1,310 \n1,416 \n1,530 \n1,654 \n1,788 \n1,933 \n\nTotal Traffic \n4,040 \n4,408 \n5,316 \n5,800 \n6,329 \n6,842 \n7,396 \n7,995 \n8,643 \n9,343 \n10,100 \n10,918 \n11,802 \n12,758 \n13,791 \n14,909 \n16,116 \n17,422 \n18,833 \n20,358 \n\nEconomic Costs \n\nSources: Asian Development Bank staff and project preparatory technical assistance. \n \nC. \n \n5. \nThe  economic  costs  of  Project  1  comprise  (i)  capital  investment,  including  civil  works, \nenvironmental  mitigation,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and  consulting  services  for \nconstruction  supervision;  and  (ii)  road  maintenance.  Costs  related  to  taxes  and  duties  and \nfinancing  charges  during  implementation  were  excluded.  The  project  costs  were  divided  into \ntradable  and  non-tradable  components.  The  costs  of  non-tradable  components  such  as \nunskilled  labor  and  domestic  materials  were  converted  into  the  world  price  numeraire  using  a \n\n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\nconversion factor of 0.92.1 Capital investment costs are estimated at $2.29 million per km. The \nannual  average  maintenance  cost  of  the  existing  road  between  Masalli  and  Astara  under  the \nwithout-project scenario is estimated at $27,500 per km, while the annual maintenance cost of \nthe  new  expressway  is  estimated  at  $13,800  per  km.  The  reduction  in  maintenance  costs  is \nbecause  the  new  expressway  entails  lower  expense  on  maintenance  than  the  existing  road, \nwhich  is  in  poor  condition  and  requires  major  surfacing  and  rehabilitation  during  the  analysis \nperiod.  The  shadow  wage  rate  factor  of  0.7  was  used  to  estimate  the  economic  price  of \nunskilled  labor.  Skilled  labor  is  not  shadow  priced  since  Azerbaijan  has  no  surplus  of  skilled \nlabor. \n \nD. \n \nThe  economic  benefits  of  Project  1  are  savings  on  vehicle  operating  costs  and  travel \n6. \ntime, and reduced traffic accidents because of improved road conditions and the short distance \nof  the  new  expressway  after  project  completion.  The  new  expressway  will  have  an  average \ninternational  roughness  index  (IRI)  value  of  2.5,  compared  to  the  IRI  value  of  11.0  for  the \nexisting road between Masalli and Astara in 2006. Savings on vehicle operating costs and travel \ntime were calculated using the highway design and maintenance 4 (HDM4) model. Savings on \nvehicle operating costs embody the value of time saved by vehicle drivers and crews, but not by \npassengers or freight. Travel time savings for passengers were calculated at $1.00 per hour\u2014\nthe average nominal wage\u2014for work-related trips. For nonbusiness trips, one third of the value \nof  the  work  time  saved  is  used  as  proxy  for  willingness  to  pay.  The  time  saved  for  freight  is \nestimated at $0.2 per ton per hour.2   \n \nRehabilitation  of  local  roads  in  the  project  area  also  generates  economic  benefits \n7. \nbecause  it  improves  the  access  to  the  Masalli\u2013Astara  expressway  for  local  communities.  The \nselected  local  roads  are  in  poor  condition,  and  the  improvement  of  these  roads  will  reduce \ntransport  costs  and  travel  time  for  local  residents.  However,  it  is  difficult  to  quantify  such \nbenefits.  \n \n8. \nThe economic benefits are summarized in Table A10.3. It shows that Project 1 will bring \nsavings on vehicle operating costs per km of 11% for cars, 14% for heavy trucks, and near 20% \nfor articulated trucks. The benefits from savings on vehicle operating costs, which initially accrue \nto  vehicle  owners  and  operators,  will  be  gradually  shared  with  passengers  and  freight \ncustomers through reduced bus fares and freight charges. Project 1 will also result in savings on \ntravel time between Masalli and Astara of about 60% for all types of vehicles. The benefits from \nreduced  traffic  accidents  are  not  easy  to  quantify,  so  it  is  assumed  that  Project  1  will \nconservatively  reduce  the  number  of  road  traffic  accidents  by  half,  based  on  similar \nassumptions  used  in  economic  analysis  from  other  road  projects  in  Azerbaijan.  The  benefits \nfrom reduced traffic accidents were conservatively estimated at $25,000 for a fatality and $1,500 \nfor an injury. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   The  conversion  factor  of  0.92  was  also  used  by  the  World  Bank  for  its  Highway  II  project,  which  includes \n\nconstructing the new Alyat\u2013Masalli expressway on the same southern corridor. \n\n2  This figure has been widely used in the economic analysis of road projects in Central Asia.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n49\n\nTable A10.3: Economic Benefits by Vehicle Type \n\nSavings \n\nSavings (%) \n\nWith Project \n\nWithout Project \n\n11.1 \n20.5 \n15.9 \n18.8 \n20.7 \n14.0 \n19.8 \n\n0.01 \n0.09 \n0.05 \n0.14 \n0.13 \n0.12 \n0.30 \n\n0.13 \n0.35 \n0.25 \n0.58 \n0.49 \n0.75 \n1.20 \n\n0.14 \n0.44 \n0.30 \n0.72 \n0.62 \n0.87 \n1.50 \n\nVehicle Type \nA.

They show that Project 1 is economically viable, with \nan  estimated  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  12.8%  and  an  estimated  net  present \nvalue  of  $7.0  million  at  a  12%  discount  rate.  Section  B  has  a  lower  EIRR  of  8%  and  a \ncorresponding  negative  net  present  value,  mainly  due  to  the  high  construction  cost  of  a  new \nLenkaran  bridge.  However,  section  B  is  an  integral  part  of  the  entire  Masalli\u2013Astara \nexpressway, so it is justifiable to include this section in Project 1. \n \n\n1.01 \n1.13 \n1.06 \n1.13 \n1.21 \n1.09 \n1.06 \n\n0.36 \n0.46 \n0.42 \n0.46 \n0.51 \n0.44 \n0.42 \n\n0.65 \n0.67 \n0.64 \n0.67 \n0.70 \n0.65 \n0.64 \n\n64.4 \n59.3 \n60.3 \n59.3 \n57.9 \n59.6 \n60.4 \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return \n\nTable A10.4: Summary Results of Economic Analysis \n\nRoad Section \n\nSection A (km 0\u2013km 22.1) \nSection B (km 22.1\u2013km 45.1) \nSection C (km 45.1\u2013km 58.6) \nTotal Project 1 Expressway \n( ) = negative number, km = kilometer. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nLength \n(km) \n22.1 \n23.0 \n13.5 \n58.6 \n\nEconomic Internal \nRate of Return (%)\n17 \n8 \n17 \n12.8 \n\nNet Present Value  \n($ million) \n\n15.9 \n(17.1) \n11.0 \n7.0 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nYear  Without  \n\nWith Project \n\nTable A10.5: Detailed Economic Analysis ($ million) \n\nCosts \n\nBenefits \n\nProject  Capital  O&M \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.79 \n0.79 \n0.79 \n0.79 \n0.79 \n0.79 \n0.79 \n0.79 \n0.79 \n0.79 \n0.79 \n0.79 \n0.79 \n0.79 \n0.79 \n0.79 \n0.79 \n0.79 \n \n \n\n39.17 \n91.40 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n \n \n\n0.00 \n0.00 \n1.71 \n1.71 \n1.71 \n1.71 \n1.71 \n1.71 \n1.71 \n1.71 \n1.71 \n1.71 \n1.71 \n1.71 \n1.71 \n1.71 \n1.71 \n1.71 \n1.71 \n1.71 \n \n \n\nVOC \nSavings \n0.00 \n0.00 \n8.40 \n9.19 \n10.06 \n10.88 \n11.76 \n12.71 \n13.74 \n14.85 \n16.05 \n17.35 \n18.76 \n20.28 \n21.92 \n23.70 \n25.62 \n27.69 \n29.93 \n32.36 \n\nNet \n39.17 \n91.40 \n(0.92)\n(0.92)\n(0.92)\n(0.92)\n(0.92)\n(0.92)\n(0.92)\n(0.92)\n(0.92)\n(0.92)\n(0.92)\n(0.92)\n(0.92)\n(0.92)\n(0.92)\n(0.92)\n(0.92)\n(0.92)\nNet present value (at 12% discount rate, $ million) \nEconomic Internal Rate of Return (%) \n\nAccident \nReduction \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.28 \n0.31 \n0.33 \n0.36 \n0.39 \n0.42 \n0.46 \n0.49 \n0.53 \n0.58 \n0.62 \n0.67 \n0.73 \n0.79 \n0.85 \n0.92 \n0.99 \n1.07 \n\nTime \nSavings \n0.00 \n0.00 \n2.45 \n2.67 \n2.91 \n3.15 \n3.40 \n3.68 \n3.97 \n4.30 \n4.64 \n5.02 \n5.43 \n5.87 \n6.34 \n6.85 \n7.41 \n8.01 \n8.66 \n9.36 \n\nTotal  \n \n0.00 \n0.00 \n11.13 \n12.17 \n13.30 \n14.38 \n15.55 \n16.81 \n18.17 \n19.64 \n21.23 \n22.95 \n24.81 \n26.82 \n28.99 \n31.34 \n33.88 \n36.62 \n39.59 \n42.79 \n\n \n\n \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n2026 \n2027 \n \n \n\nNet  \nBenefits \n \n\n(39.17) \n(91.40) \n12.05 \n13.09 \n14.22 \n15.30 \n16.47 \n17.72 \n19.09 \n20.56 \n22.15 \n23.87 \n25.73 \n27.74 \n29.91 \n32.26 \n34.79 \n37.54 \n40.50 \n43.71 \n7.0 \n12.8 \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\n( ) = negative number, O&M = operation and maintenance, VOC = vehicle operating cost. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF. \n \nThe  sensitivity  analysis  assesses  the  variables  to  which  the  estimated  EIRR  and  net \n10. \npresent value of Project 1 are sensitive.

However,  about  70%  of  the  road  network  is  in  poor  condition,  inhibiting \nsustained  economic  growth  and  social  development.  The  State  Program  on  Poverty  Reduction  and  Economic \nDevelopment  developed  with  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  assistance  and  the  State  Program  on  Socioeconomic \nDevelopment  of  the  Regions  identified  improvement  of  road  network  infrastructure  as  a  high  priority  for  economic \ngrowth  and  poverty  reduction. The  Road  Network  Development  Program  (the  Program)  will  construct,  upgrade,  and \nrehabilitate  about  9,500  kilometers  (km)  of  124  priority  roads  during  2006\u20132015,  which  will  result  in  (i)  people\u2019s \nincreased  mobility  and  accessibility  to  markets,  jobs,  and  social  services;  (ii)  greater  opportunities  for  private  sector \nparticipation; and (iii) improved governance in the road subsector. The major poverty reduction impacts of the Program \ninclude (i) reduced prices of transport services, food, and other daily necessities because of lower transport costs; (ii) \njobs  and  income  generated  for  the  poor  from  road  reconstruction,  operation,  and  maintenance,  as  well  as  roadside \ncommercial activities; and (iii) improved access of the poor to markets and social services. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nDespite  recent  oil-based  economic  growth,  poverty  in  Azerbaijan  remains  high\u2014the  official  poverty  rate  was  about \n20% for the country in 2006. Poverty is severer in rural areas (45% in 2003), compared to urban areas (44%). Poverty \nis higher in the rayons (districts) of Nakhichevan (59%) and Mughan-Salyan (52%). Project 1 of the Program covers \nthree  rayons\u2014Masalli,  Lenkaran,  and  Astara  in  southern  Azerbaijan\u2014with  a  total  population  of  790,700.  Rural \nresidents account for the majority of the population and about 70% of the households live below the poverty line in the \nproject area in 2006. The average monthly per capita income in the project area is estimated at AZN40.4, lower than \nthe national poverty line of AZN42. Rural villages located at the foot of the Talysh mountains and along the existing \nroad in Astara on the border with Iran appear to be the poorest since they have too little unfertile land and insufficient \nmeans of livelihood. Overall, the majority of the population in the project area is prone to flooding and increase in the \nCaspian Sea level. \n \nThe  main  causes  of  poverty  in  the  project  area  are  (i)  economic  degradation  in  southern  Azerbaijan  as  a  result  of \ndecline in demand for the region\u2019s exports of citrus and other fruits, and the collapse of local processing industries; (ii) \nlimited  access  to  the  country\u2019s  capital,  Baku  and  international  markets  because  of  remoteness;  (iii)  high  rural  out-\nmigration;  (iv)  natural  calamities;  (v)  limited  social  services;  and  (vi)  deterioration  of  health  among  working-age \npopulations (e.g., tuberculosis, malaria). However, poor road network infrastructure imposes constraints on access to \njob  opportunities,  markets,  and  basic  social  services  (education  and  health),  and  thus  affect  the  poor.  Most  villages \nare located 0.5 km or more from the main roads. The majority of the rural population, particularly the poor, has to walk \nto the main roads to access social services and buy necessities. The cost of reaching markets outside the village is \nhigh,  due  to  poor  road  conditions  and  expensive  transport  services.  Improving  road  infrastructure  is  one  of  the \npriorities  in  the  State  Program  on  Poverty  Reduction  and  Economic  Development  and  the  State  Program  on \nSocioeconomic Development of the Regions. \n \nThe  Program  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  in  Azerbaijan  by  creating  an  enabling  environment  for  poverty \nreduction;  and  increasing  access  to  markets,  job  opportunities,  and  basic  social  services  for  the  whole  population, \nincluding  the  poor.  Project  1  is  expected  to  create  about  3,000  person-years  of  jobs  for  road  construction,  of  which \nabout 2,000 person-years will be unskilled jobs; half of the unskilled work will be for the poor.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n53\n\nC.  Participation Process \n\n \n\n \n\n   No \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\n   Yes               \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nDuring the preparation of the Program and  Project 1, extensive consultations  were held  with various stakeholders\u2014\nincluding  representatives  of  central  and  local  governments,  civil  society,  local  communities,  the  private  sector,  road \nusers,  and  external  aid  agencies.  The  public  consultations  were  held  through  meetings,  interviews,  surveys,  group \ndiscussions,  and  written  communications,  with  the  participation  of  about  3,000  people.  The  consultations  covered \nmajor  issues  such  as  selection  of  roads,  road  alignment,  transport  services,  investment  benefits,  and  social  and \nenvironmental  impacts  of  the  Program.  The  results  showed  a  high  degree  of  public  support  for  the  Program.  The \ndesigns of the Program and Project 1 incorporated the views of stakeholders. Special attention was given to the needs \nand  constraints  faced  by  women,  internally  displaced  people,  refugees,  and  other  vulnerable  groups.  The  summary \nenvironmental impact assessment of Project 1 was disclosed publicly through the ADB website. The resettlement plan \nfor subproject A of Project 1 was disclosed to the affect persons. The resettlement plans for subprojects B and C of \nProject  1  are  being  prepared  in  consultation  with  affected  persons,  and  will  be  disclosed  to  them  upon  completion. \nStakeholder  participation  and  consultation  will  continue  during  implementation.  The  AzerRoadService  Open  Joint-\nStock  Company  (ARS)  under  the  Ministry  of  Transport  will  ensure  that  resettlement  monitoring  reports  are  made \navailable to affected persons. For subsequent projects, ARS will hold stakeholder consultations during the preparation \nof resettlement plans and environmental assessments, and disclose them to the public through the ADB website. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \nThe participation strategy aims to ensure the active participation of stakeholders during the design and implementation \nof the Program to achieve its impact fully. This strategy will include the need for raising stakeholders\u2019 awareness of the \nimpacts, outcome, outputs, and activities of the Program, using multiple methods such as public meetings, interviews, \nsurveys, newspapers, and local announcements. The strategy will include a consultative phase during detailed design, \nthrough which the program support consultant will assist in the participatory process, together with local stakeholders, \nto develop appropriate locations and designs for pedestrian and livestock crossing points, lighting, speed control, and \nroadside market areas. This strategy  will be reviewed  with representatives of target groups and modified, if needed, \naccording to relevant inputs during implementation. \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nDuring preparation of Project 1, a gender analysis was conducted, based on the gender-disaggregated data collected \nvia  household  surveys,  review  of  secondary  data,  and  qualitative  data  gathered  though  community  consultations  in \ncollaboration with the Azerbaijan Women and Development Center, one of the leading nongovernment organization in \nAzerbaijan.  The  analysis  showed  that  women  (single,  young,  elderly,  and  those  with  many  children)  need  special \nassistance to fully benefit from the Program. \n \nThe  Program  is  expected  to  create  job  opportunities  for  women  during  implementation  (e.g.,  construction,  catering, \ncleaning, and food services) and in roadside businesses (e.g., cafes and shops) after completion. Contracts for civil \nworks  and  consulting  services  will  include  provisions  to  encourage  employment  of  skilled  and  unskilled  women \nlaborers.  During  detailed  design,  the  consultant  will  coordinate  closely  with  representatives  of  vulnerable  women\u2019s \nassociations  in  the  project  area  to  identify  effective  modalities  to  ensure  (i)  their  involvement  in,  and  direct  benefit \nfrom,  increased  commercial  activities  in  roadside  markets;  and  (ii)  appropriate  mitigation  measures  included  in  the \nproject design to minimize negative impacts on them. During implementation, civil works contractors will be required to \ntake measures to mitigate the potential risks of HIV/AIDS. These measures  will include raising  public  awareness on \nthe risk of sexually transmitted infections (including HIV/AIDS) through leaflet distribution to road construction workers \nand local communities, and giving workers time to be tested or receive treatment. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n\n   No, included in the contract documents. \n\n    Yes \n\n \n\n\fStrategy to Address Issues \n\nPlan Required \n\n(MFF) \n\nfacility \n\nin  accordance  with \n\nThe  impact  on  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  will  be \nassessed  for  all  projects  financed  under  the  multitranche \nfinancing \nthe \nresettlement framework prepared by the Government and \nagreed  with  ADB  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nlaws  and \nResettlement  Policy  (1995),  and  relevant \nregulations in Azerbaijan. Project 1 will require significant \nland acquisition. The preparation of the resettlement plan \nfor  Project  1  follows  a  sector  modality.  The  resettlement \nplan for section A of the Project 1 expressway (km 0\u2013km \n22.1)\u2014a  core  subproject\u2014was  prepared  to  ensure  that \nfair  compensation  and  assistance  are  provided \nfor \naffected  persons  or  businesses.  The  resettlement  plans \nfor all non-core subprojects under Project 1 (i.e., sections \nB and C of the Project 1 expressway) are being prepared \nin  accordance  with  the  resettlement  framework,  and  will \nbe  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval  and  fully  implemented \nbefore  the  awards  of  concerned  civil  works  contracts. \nAppraisal of subsequent projects financed under the MFF \nwill  require  reviewing  the  resettlement  framework  and \npreparing  resettlement  plans  for  those  projects  with  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  impacts.  Implementation  of \nthe \nto \nresettlement  plans  will  be  a  condition \ncommencement of civil works under the relevant projects. \nNo  tolls  will  be  collected  on  the  project  roads  financed \nunder  the  MFF.  The  Program  will  lead  to  savings  on \nvehicle operating cost, which will lower transport costs. \nThe Program will create a considerable number of jobs for \nroad  construction  work.  Civil  works  contractors  will  be \nrequired  to  meet  labor  law  standards,  in  terms  of \nconditions of employment, work safety, pay and insurance \naccording  to  national  laws;  and  equal  job  opportunities \nand payments for national and international laborers. \nThe  Program \nimpact  on \nindigenous  peoples.  Ethnic  Azeri  peoples  account  for \nmore than 95% of the population in Azerbaijan; there are \nfew  other  ethnic  groups,  which  include  Kurds,  Russian, \nand  Turks.  The  minorities  are  neither  indigenous  nor \nexpected to be adversely affected by the Program. \nAll projects financed under the MFF will include measures \nto  mitigate  the  risks  of  sexually  transmitted  infections \n(including  HIV/AIDS)  and  drug/human  trafficking.  Civil \nworks  contractors  will  be  required \nto  raise  public \nawareness  of  the  risks  of  HIV/AIDS  and  other  sexually \ntransmitted  infections  at  construction  sites,  and  give \nconstruction  workers \ntested  or  receive \ntreatment. \n\nto  have  no \n\nis  expected \n\nto  be \n\ntime \n\n Full \n Short \n None \n\n Yes \n  No \n\n Yes \n  No \n\n Yes \n  No \n\n Yes \n  No \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n54 \n\n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nE.

The  MFF  will \ncomprise  multiple  loans.  The  projects  financed  under  the  MFF  are  expected  to  cause  land \nacquisition and resettlement (LAR) impacts. Project 1 will construct about 59 kilometers (km) of \na new four-lane expressway between Masalli and Astara on the border with Iran, which is the \nsouthern  segment  of  the  new  expressway  between  Alyat  and  Astara  the  southern  transport \ncorridor. Project 1 comprises subproject A\u2014a core subproject covering section km 0\u2013km 22.1 of \nthe  Masalli\u2013Astara  expressway  and  two  non-core  subprojects:  (i)  subproject  B  (section  km \n22.1\u2013km  45.1  of  the  Masalli\u2013Astara  expressway),  and  (ii)  subproject  C  (section  km  45.1\u2013km \n58.6 of the Masalli\u2013Astara expressway). Under subproject A, the financing will also be provided \nfor  rehabilitation  of  local  roads,  procurement  of  road  maintenance  equipment  and  vehicle \nweighing  station  to  be  used  on  the  Masalli\u2013Astara  expressway,  project  support,  and  capacity \nbuilding. All subprojects on the new Masalli\u2013Astara expressway will entail LAR. No impacts on \nindigenous peoples are envisaged for the entire Program. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nLAR  will  follow  Azerbaijan\u2019s  relevant  laws  and  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  Operations  Manual  F2  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (2006). \nAppraisal  of  the  MFF  and  each  project  involving  LAR  will  require  preparing  the  following \ndocuments. \n \n\nGeneral Procedures \n\nA  resettlement  framework  for  the  MFF  to  be  reviewed,  updated  (if  necessary), \nand submitted to ADB for approval annually and before the preparation of each \ntranche. \n\nAn  initial  poverty  and  social  assessment,  indicating  whether  LAR  impacts  are \nexpected and, if so, their type and magnitude for each project. \n\nA  resettlement  plan  for  the  project  with  LAR  impact,  based  on  detailed  design \nand inclusive of compensation budgets and schedules.1 \n\nAppraisal of the MFF and each project will meet the following LAR-related requirements. \n\nAppraisal  of  MFF  and  Project  1:  conditional  to  preparation  of  a  resettlement \nframework  for  the  MFF  and  a  resettlement  plan  for  the  core  subproject \nacceptable to ADB. \n\nAppraisal  of  subsequent  projects:  conditional  to  (a)  review  and  updating  of  the \nresettlement  framework,  and  (b)  preparation  of  the  resettlement  plans  for  all \nprojects with LAR impact. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nContract  awards  for  each  project:  conditional  to  preparation  of  the  concerned \nresettlement plan, based on the final design and accepted by ADB. \n\n                                                 \n1   According  to  ADB.  2006.  Operations  Manual.  Section  F2:  Involuntary  Resettlement.  Manila,  the  type  of \nresettlement  plan  rests  on  the  significance  of  the  involuntary  resettlement  impacts.  If  200  or  more  people  will  be \nresettled  from  housing,  or  10%  or  more  of  their  income  will  be  lost,  a  project  is  classified  category  A  and  a  full \nresettlement plan will be prepared. If less than 200 people will be resettled or less than 10% of their income will be \nlost, a project is classified category B and a short resettlement plan will be prepared. \n\n \n3. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n(iv) \n\nStart  of  civil  works  for  each  project:  conditional  to  the  implementation  of  a  full \nresettlement plan. \n\nResettlement Framework \n\n \n4. \nIn  accordance  with  the  above  requirements,  the  Ministry  of  Transport,  the  Executing \nAgency  and  the  AzerRoadService  Open  Joint-Stock  Company  (ARS)  under  the  Ministry  of \nTransport, the Implementing Agency, prepared the resettlement framework and the resettlement \nplan for section A of Project 1\u2014the core subproject under Project 1. The resettlement plans for \nall non-core subprojects under Project 1 (i.e., sections B and C of the Project 1 expressway) are \nbeing prepared in accordance with the resettlement framework, and will be submitted to ADB for \napproval and fully implemented before the awards of concerned civil works contracts. \n \nC. \n \nThe  resettlement  framework  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  relevant  laws  and \n5. \nregulations  in  Azerbaijan  and  ADB\u2019s  Resettlement  Policy.  The  resettlement  framework \nprescribes  the  following  principles:  (i)  LAR  will  be  avoided  or  at  least  minimized;  (ii) \ncompensation will ensure the maintenance of the pre-project living standards of affected people; \n(iii) affected persons will be fully informed of and consulted on compensation options; (iv) socio-\ncultural institutions of affected persons will be supported and used; (v) LAR provisions will apply \nequally  to  both  genders;  (vi)  lack  of  formal  title  will  not  be  a  bar  to  compensation  and \nrehabilitation; (vii) particular attention will be paid to women-headed households and vulnerable \ngroups;  (viii)  LAR  will  be  conceived  and  executed  as  an  integral  part  of  the  project  and  LAR \nbudgets  will  be  included  in  project  costs;  and  (ix)  compensation  will  be  fully  provided  prior  to \nground leveling and demolition. The resettlement framework also covers all relevant issues for \nLAR  tasks  to  be  carried  out  effectively  in  accordance  with  ADB  policy,  and  sets  the \neligibility/entitlement provisions in Table A12.1. \n \n\nTable A12.1: Compensation Entitlement Matrix \n\n \n\nAsseta \nPermanent \nimpact on \narable land \n\nSpecification \nAll land losses \nindependently \nfrom impact \nseverity \n\nAffected People \nFarmer/Titleholder \n\nCompensation Entitlements \n\n\u2022  Land for land compensation with plots of equal value and \n\nproductivity to the plots lost, or \n\n\u2022  Cash compensation for affected land at replacement cost based \n\non market valueb free of taxes, registration, and transfer. \n\n\u2022  Residual portions of plots affected by the required right-of-way \nthat are reduced to less than 400 m2 or rendered unusable by \nalterations in access, irrigation, or workability will be included in \nthe affected land and compensated as above indicated above. \n\nLeaseholder \n\n\u2022  Renewal of lease in other plots of equal value/productivity of \n\nplots lost, or  \n\n\u2022  Cash compensation for affected land at full replacement cost \n\nfree of taxes, registration, and transfer costs. \n\nSharecroppers \n\n\u2022  Cash compensation equal to the market value of the lost \n\nAgricultural  \nworkers losing their \ncontract \nSquatters \n\nFarmer/Titleholder \nLeaseholder \n\nharvest share once (temporary impact) or twice (permanent \nimpact).  \n\n\u2022  Cash indemnity corresponding to their salary (including portions \n\nin kind) for the remaining part of the agricultural year. \n\n\u2022  Actual crop loss compensation and resettlement assistance will \n\nbe provided (see below). \n\n\u2022  1 severe impact allowance equal to market value of 1 net \n\nharvest of the affected land for 1 year (inclusive of winter and \nsummer crop and (additional to standard crop compensation). \n\nSharecroppers \n\n\u2022  1 severe impact allowance equal to market value of share of \n\nharvest (additional to standard crop compensation). \n\nSquatters \n\n\u2022  1 severe impact allowance equal to market value of net harvest \n\nAdditional \nprovisions for \nsevere impacts \n(more than \n10% of land \nloss) \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n57\n\nAsseta \n\nSpecification \n\nAffected People \n\nCompensation Entitlements \n\nResidential/ \ncommercial \nland \n\n \n\n \n\nHouses and \nStructures \n\nAll relevant affected \npersons \n\nof the affected land for 1 year (additional to standard crop \ncompensation). \n\nTitleholder \n\n\u2022  Land for land compensation through provision of a plot \n\ncomparable in value/location to plot, or  \n\n\u2022  Cash compensation for affected land at full replacement cost \n\nfree of taxes, registration, and transfer costs. \n\nRenter/Leaseholder  \u2022  1\u20133 months allowance \nSquatters \n\n\u2022  Provision of a free or leased plot in a government resettlement \n\narea or a self-relocation allowance. \n\n\u2022  Cash compensation at replacement rates for affected structure \n\nand other fixed assets free of salvageable materials, \ndepreciation and transaction costs.

ARS has overall responsibility for the Program including \n6. \nthe  preparation,  implementation,  and  financing  of  all  LAR  tasks  and  interagency  coordination. \nARS  will  exercise  its  functions  through  the  project  implementation  unit  (PIU),  which  will  be \nresponsible for handling day-to-day project implementation activities. Within ARS, LAR tasks will \nbe  managed  by  the  Land  Acquisition  Division  (LAD),  which  will  organize  and  monitor \npreparation,  approval,  and  implementation  of  resettlement  plans  (including  surveys,  asset \nvaluation,  and  community  consultation);  and  LAR-related  interagency  coordination.  In  the \nimplementation of these tasks, LAD will be supported by: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\na resettlement team under the supervision consultants, which will assist in LAR \nplanning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation, and training of staff in ARS \nand  local  governments  in  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement \nPolicy; \n\na  local  consulting  team  engaged  to  prepare  resettlement  plans,  undertake \nsurveys, collect baseline information, or consult with affected persons; and \n\nan independent agency, engaged to conduct periodic monitoring and evaluation, \nand third party validation of implementation of the resettlement plans. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nDisclosure  and  Public  Consultation.  The  preparation  and \n\n \n7. \nLocal  governments  at  rayon  levels  have  jurisdiction  for  land  administration,  valuation, \nand  acquisition,  while  a  number  of  other  local  officials  (i.e.,  local  representatives  of  the  State \nLand  Committee  and  Institute  of  Cartography)  will  carry  out  specific  roles  such  as  title \nidentification  and  verification.  Functions  pertaining  to  compensation  of  non-land  assets  (i.e. \nbuildings  and  crops)  or  income  rehabilitation  also  fall  on  local  governments  and,  more \nspecifically, on relevant rayon offices. \n \nA  central  LAR  commission  will  be  established,  which  will  be  chaired  by  the  Ministry  of \n8. \nTransport  and  will  comprise  representatives  of  the  Ministry  of  Transport,  Ministry  of  Finance, \nMinistry  of  Economic  Development,  State  Land  and  Cartography  Committee,  and  the  State \nService for Land Registration. The function of this commission is to ensure effective interagency \ncoordination at central government level, carry out a final review of the resettlement framework \nand resettlement plans, and provide official approval of these documents.  To provide effective \ninteragency  coordination  and  officially  endorse  the  impacts  and  compensation  rates  surveys, \neach  affected  rayon  government  will  also  establish  a  rayon  LAR  commission,  comprising \nrepresentatives of the following local government agencies: Department of Roads, Department \nof  Finance,  Land  and  Cartography  Commission,  local  division  of  the  Ministry  of  Ecology  and \nNatural  Resources,  Real  Estate  Registration  Service,  local  executives,  and  other  relevant \norganizations. \n \n9. \nimplementation  of \nresettlement  plans  will  involve  extensive  consultation  with  affected  persons.  As  an  appraisal \ncondition,  the  resettlement  framework  and  relevant  resettlement  plans  in  English  will  be \ndisclosed on the ADB website, while the resettlement framework and resettlement plans in the \nAzeri language will be disclosed to affected persons. \n \n10. \nGrievance  Procedures.  Affected  persons  will  first  lodge  a  complaint  with  the  PIU.  If \nsettlement  is  not  reached  within  15  days,  the  complaint  would  then  be  lodged  with  the  rayon \nLAR commission. If the grievance is still not settled within 2 weeks, the affected persons may \nseek redress directly with ARS headquarters. If no solution is found, they may then lodge their \ncomplaints with the appropriate court of law. \n \n11.  Monitoring and Evaluation. The  PIU  will  monitor  implementation  of  the  resettlement \nplans and ARS will report to ADB on a quarter basis. ARS will engage an independent agency \nfor  external  monitoring.  External  monitoring  reports  will  be  submitted  to  ARS  and  ADB \nsemiannually.  At  the  end  of  project  implementation,  the  independent  monitoring  agency  will \ncarry out a general evaluation of LAR implementation. \n \n12. \nthat  each \nresettlement plan will detail LAR budgets and provide clear schedules linking LAR tasks to the \ninitiation of civil works. \n \nD. \n \n13. \nThe core subproject of Project 1 is section A of the Masalli\u2013Astara expressway from east \nof Khil village in Masalli rayon approximately to the vicinity of Girdani Canal (km 0\u2013km 22.1, 22 \nkm).  The  resettlement  plan  for  section  A  of  Project  1,  which  was  prepared  based  on  the \nresettlement  framework  and  detailed  design,  outlines  the  impacts,  compensation  policy, \ncompensation and rehabilitation provisions, cost estimates, and implementation schedule.

The \n\nframework  prescribes \n\nresettlement \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n59\n\nof 5.5 square meters (km2) will be affected, and the land taken from these lots for the right-of- \nway (ROW) is 1.55 km2. The lots to be affected comprise 604 private lots (including a lot owned \nby  the  municipality  but  leased  to  the  private  sector)  and  187  public  lots.  The  total  area  of \naffected private land is 4.2 km2 and the area taken for the ROW is 0.8 km2. Most of the land is \nunfenced  grazing  land  freely  used  by  owners  of  animals  with  few  structures  and  little  active \ncultivation.  Public  lands  are  the  land  belonging  to  the  central  or  municipal  governments,  and \nused for public works such as roads, canals, irrigation channels, and open grazing lands. The \ntotal area of affected public land is 0.6 km2, all of which will be taken for the ROW. The majority \nof the public land is municipal and non-arable. A total of 141 public infrastructure assets on the \naffected  non-arable  public  land\u2014comprising  canal  structures,  irrigation  structures,  and \nagricultural  assess  structures\u2014are  expected  to  be  affected  by  the  project.  The  project  is  also \nexpected  to  affect  16  private  buildings.  A  summary  land  acquisition  and  compensation  is  in \nTable A12.2.
