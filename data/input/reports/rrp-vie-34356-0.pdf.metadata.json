A  summary  initial \nenvironmental  examination  was  prepared  and  circulated  to  the  ADB \nBoard of Directors on 1 June 2005. \n \nThe  proposed  Central  Region  Transport  Networks  Improvement \nSector  Project  (the  Project)  will  address  the  removal  of  transport \nconstraints on economic and social development in rural areas of the \ncentral  region  of  Viet  Nam.  Outputs  from  the  Project  will  include \napproximately  1,200  km  of  sealed  all-weather  roads  connecting \nselected  rural  areas  and  district  and  provincial  centers  in  the  19 \nprovinces  of  the  central  region,  road  safety  programs,  and  road  and \nbridge  asset  management  systems  for  provincial  road  networks. \nUpgrading  of  project  roads  will  be  undertaken  in  three  phases.  A \ndesign and monitoring framework for the Project is in Appendix 1.  \n \nThe  Project  will  address  economic  growth  in  the  19  provinces  of  the \ncentral  region  of  Viet  Nam  by  improving  connections  to  rural  areas \nwith poor, or seasonal, access and increasing the efficiency by which \npeople  can  move  and  goods  can  be  traded.  Nearly  all  of  the  central \nregion provinces have strikingly high rural poverty and two provinces \nare  among  the  poorest  in  the  country.  Their  remoteness  and  poor \nlinks  to  the  rest  of  the  economy,  including  lack  of  transport \nconnections through all-weather roads, are key factors in the region\u2019s \npoverty.  Improvements  to  provincial  and  district  roads  will  connect \nrural areas with provincial and national growth centers. \n \nIn  Viet  Nam\u2019s  comprehensive  poverty  reduction  and  growth  strategy \n(CPRGS), approved in May 2002, the development and rehabilitation \nof the transport system was a priority. The Asian Development Bank\u2019s \n(ADB)  country  strategy  and  program  update  (CSPU),  approved  in \nAugust  2005,  emphasizes  (i) generating  economic  growth  and  (ii)  a \nfocus on the central region. The Project is consistent with the CPRGS \nand the CSP. \n \nWhen access to communities in remote areas is improved, they may \nimmunodeficiency  virus/acquired \nbecome  vulnerable \ninfectious \nimmunodeficiency  syndrome \ndiseases  and \ntrafficking  unless \nadequate  measures  are  taken.  To  address  this  risk,  the  Project \nincludes a component for a gender, HIV and anti-trafficking prevention \nprogram. \n\n(HIV/AIDS)  and  other \nthrough  human \n\nto  exploitation \n\nto  human \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nCost Estimates \n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nLoan Amount and \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n\n \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  felt  in  improved  access  to  markets, \nemployment  opportunities,  and  social  services  by \nremoving \nconstraints on economic and social development in rural areas of the \ncentral  region  of  Viet  Nam.  The  outcome  of  the  Project  will  be  more \nefficient  and  cost-effective  movements  of  passengers  and  goods  in \nthese rural areas. \n \nThe cost of the Project is estimated at $138 million. \n \nThe ADB loan will finance about 89.8% of the foreign exchange costs, \nestimated  at  $76.3  million,  and  about  34.3%  of  the  local  currency \ncosts, estimated at $18.2 million. An ADB grant of $0.5 million will be \nprovided  to  finance  a  gender,  HIV  and  anti-trafficking  prevention \nprogram.  The  Government  will  finance  $32.0  million  equivalent  of \nlocal  currency  costs  and  the  Nordic  Development  Fund  (NDF)  will \nprovide  $11  million  equivalent  to  cofinance  part  of  the  cost  of  the \nconsulting  services  under  the  Project.  NDF  will  finance  9.9%  of  the \nforeign  exchange  costs  and  4.9%  of  the  local  currency  costs.  NDF \nfinancing will be made available as parallel financing. \n \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  $94.5  million  equivalent, \ndenominated  in  Special  Drawing  Rights  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources. The loan will have a term of 32 years with a grace period \nof 8 years. There will be an interest charge of 1% per annum during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter.  \n \n4.5 years \n \n30 June 2010 \n\n \nthe  Ministry  of  Transport  and \nThe  Executing  Agency  will  be \nresponsibility  for  planning  and  coordination  will  be  delegated  to \nProject Management Unit No. 1 (PMU-1).  \n \nPMU-1 will be responsible for recruiting consultants and awarding civil \nworks contracts. The provincial departments of transport (PDOTs) will \nbe  the  implementing  agencies  in  their  respective  provinces.  The \nPDOTs  have  established  provincial  project  management  units \n(PPMUs) that will be responsible for day-to-day administration of civil \nworks  contacts.  This  is  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  policy  to \ndecentralize project responsibilities to the provinces. \n \nCivil works will be implemented through a number of contracts valued \nat between $0.5 million and $2 million. Each province will have up to \nfour  contracts,  for  a  total  of  about  68  contracts.  Contracts  will  be \nprocured using local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures acceptable \nto ADB and will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nAbout  275  person-months  of  international  consultants  and  about \n2,965 person-months of domestic consultants will be required to work \nwith  the  Government  to  implement  the  Project.  There  will  be  four \nconsulting  services  packages  responsible  for  assistance  in  the \nselection  and  evaluation  of  subprojects,  preparation  of  civil  works \nimplementation  documents,  supervision  of  civil  works,  design  and \nimplementation  of  a  program  of  capacity  building  and  road  safety \nprograms  in  selected  central  region  provinces,  and  design  and \nimplementation  of  a  gender,  HIV  and  anti-trafficking  prevention \nprogram. \n \nThe  Project  will  relieve  the  isolation  of  poor  rural  areas  by  reducing \ntravel cost and time, and eliminating traffic disruptions during the wet \nseason. The direct benefits of the Project include (i) savings in vehicle \noperating costs and (ii) savings in passenger time costs. The indirect \nbenefits  will  stem  from  (i)  induced  lower  input  and  consumer  prices \nand (ii) generated economic activity in the project area.  \n \nOne of the main risks associated with the Project is its sustainability. \nThis  risk  has  been  mitigated  by  providing  assistance  to  provincial \nauthorities  to  develop  road  maintenance  management  systems  and \nan  assurance  that  the  project  provinces  will  increase  maintenance \nfunding by 100%.  \n \nWith regard to risks that may arise during implementation, the Project \nincludes  measures  to  mitigate  risks  arising  from  (i)  delays  (by \nretroactively  financing  consulting  services  and  taking  advanced \nactions for recruitment of consultants and procurement of civil works); \n(ii) poor  contractor  performance  (by  adopting  procedures  developed \nduring  ongoing  projects  to  ensure  that  contractors  have  the  capacity \nto  implement  contracts  awarded);  (iii)  failure  to  implement  project \nsafeguards  (through  training  courses  and  provision  of  assistance \nunder  consulting  services);  and  (iv)  an  increase  in  road  traffic \naccidents  (by  incorporating  pilot  road  safety  programs  in  three \nprovinces,  developed  from  the  Government\u2019s  national  road  safety \nprogram).  \n \nThere is also a concern that the Project may increase the potential for \nthe  spread  of  HIV/AIDS  and  other  sexually  transmitted  infections \nbecause  of  the  influx  of  construction  workers  and  the  increased \ncontact  that  formerly  remote  areas  will  have  with  the  rest  of  the \ncountry.  Road  connections  may  also  lead  to  human  trafficking  of \nteenage  children  and  women.  These  risks  will  be  minimized  and \nmitigated  through  a  gender,  HIV  and  anti-trafficking  prevention \nprogram,  designed  to  raise  awareness  and  provide  preventive \nmeasures  for  local  communities  (with  a  special  focus  on  ethnic \nwomen), construction workers, and the mobile populations. \n \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n \n\n\fo\n103  00\u2019E\n\no\n108  00\u2019E\n\nHa Giang\n\nCao Bang\n\nPEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC\nOF  CHINA\n\nLao Cai\n\nBac Kan\n\nLai Chau\n\nTuyen Quang\n\nLang Son\n\nYen Bai\n\nThai Nguyen\n\nSon La\n\nViet Tri\n\nVinh Yen\n\nDien Bien\n\nBac Giang\n\nHANOI\n\nHoa Binh\n\nHai\nDuong\n\nHai Phong\n\nHa Long\n\nThai Binh\n\nNinh Binh\n\nGulf   of   Tonkin\n\n20  00\u2019No\n\nLAO  PEOPLE'S\nDEMOCRATIC  REPUBLIC\n\n1\n\nThanh Hoa\n\n20  00\u2019No\n\nCENTRAL REGION PROVINCES\n\nV I E T  N A M\nCENTRAL REGION TRANSPORT\nNETWORKS IMPROVEMENT\nSECTOR PROJECT\n\n2\n\nVinh\n\nHa Tinh\n\n3\n\nDong Hoi\n\n4\n\n1.

The  central \nregion  of  Viet  Nam  has  strikingly  high  rural  poverty,  which  is  sustained  by  the  remoteness  of \nmany communities and their poor links to the rest of the economy. In the central region, the lack \nof  all-weather  provincial  and  district  roads  has  isolated  poor  rural  communities  from  provincial \nand national markets and, ultimately, the benefits of economic growth. A design and monitoring \nframework for the Project is in Appendix 1.  \n \n3. \nThe  central  region  of  Viet  Nam  consists  of  19  provinces  distributed  among  three \nsubregions:  north  central  coast,  south  central  coast,  and  central  highlands.  The  population  of \nthe  central  region  is  approximately  23.1  million  people  consisting  of  11  indigenous  groups \nbelonging  to  three  linguistic  families,  the  Kinh,  Malayo-Polynesian,  and  Mon-Khmer.  The \ntopography in the project area includes a flat, flood-prone coastal plain along the eastern side, \ngently rolling hills near the border with the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic in the north, and \nlow  mountains  in  the  southern  provinces.  The  predominant  economic  activity  in  rural  areas  is \nagriculture;  rice  predominates  on  the  coastal  plain,  while  coffee,  tea,  and  sugar  cane  are \nabundant  in  hilly  and  low  mountain  areas.  About  78%  of  the  population  of  this  region  lives  in \nrural  areas.  The  overall  poverty  incidence  is  29%,  but  in  rural  areas  it  is  46%  compared  with \n14% in urban areas.  \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n4. \nThe  principal  mode  for  the  movement  of  goods  and  people  in  the  central  region  is  by \nroad. The network of national roads enabling movement between regions and provinces is well \ndeveloped.  However,  the  networks  of  provincial  and  district  roads  within  each  province  are \nsparse  and  the  quality  is  poor.  Rural  areas  need  better  connections  to  the  provincial  and \nnational road networks.2 Provincial and district roads are important because they link commune \nand district roads with district and provincial centers and with the national highway network. The \nprovincial road networks in the central region have significant needs and will require a series of \ninvestments over a period of time.  \n \nThe poor condition of provincial and district roads has a major impact on the livelihoods \n5. \nof people living in rural areas. Bus and truck operators are reluctant to provide services on poor \nroads and even when they do these services stop when roads are closed because of flooding.  \nAccess  to  job  opportunities,  markets,  schools,  and  health  facilities  is  restricted.    As  a \nconsequence, the provision of sealed all-weather roads will have a major impact on the quality \nof life of people in rural areas. \n                                                 \n1   Project  preparatory  TA  was  financed  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan  (ADB. \n2002.

Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n6. \nThe  Ministry  of  Transport  (MOT)  is  responsible  for  the  overall  management  and \ndevelopment  of  the  transport  sector.  At  the  provincial  and  district  levels,  responsibility  for \nplanning  and  programming  for  transport  sector  investments  and  operations  is  vested  in  the \nprovincial departments of transport (PDOTs), which are responsible to their respective provincial \npeople\u2019s  committees  (PPCs).  The  PDOTs  are  not  directly  responsible  to  MOT,  but  they  have \nlinks to MOT to carry out certain works. An analysis of the provincial road subsector is given in \nAppendix 2. \n \n7. \nInformation  from  the  central  region  PDOTs  reveals  that  61%  of  provincial  and  district \nroads under the PDOTs are sealed and 39% are gravel or  earth.  About half of the total road \nlength is in bad or poor condition.  Detailed field surveys that were carried out on 28 provincial \nand  district  roads  (544  km)  in  nine  representative  provinces  as  part  of  project  preparation \nrevealed many deficiencies: road foundations and pavement cross-sections did not meet basic \nstandards,  poor  alignments  and  narrow  bridges  or  culverts  created  numerous  road  safety \nhazards,  cross-drainage  was  inadequate,  many  bridges  needed  to  be  repaired  or  replaced, \nmany  sections  of  road  were  passable  only  by  motorcycle  or  four-wheel-drive  vehicle,  many \nroads  were  closed  for  long  periods  during  the  wet  season,  and  the  surface  condition  of  most \nroads was very rough. The net result of these deficiencies is that travel speeds are very low. \n \n8. \nThe  central  region  PDOTs  have  produced  road  master  plans  and  identified  project \nrequirements  but,  in  many  instances,  accepted  transport  planning  procedures  have  not  been \nused to prepare the proposed projects or to establish priorities. This has led to a misallocation of \nresources.  Most  PDOTs  lack  the  systems,  technical  equipment,  and  training  needed  for \neffective road asset planning and training. The Government recognizes the problems faced by \nthe  PDOTs  and  has  begun  various  programs  help  them.  The  Viet  Nam  Road  Administration \n(VRA) and several donor-funded projects are trying to introduce road maintenance management \nprocesses  into  the  PDOTs  and  road  maintenance  companies.  However,  so  far  the  main \nemphasis  has  been  on  national  highways  and  little  work  has  been  done  to  apply  these \nprocesses to provincial roads.  \n \n9. \nAdditional budget allocations are urgently needed for provincial road maintenance. The \nPDOTs do not receive sufficient budget allocations from the PPCs to enable them to carry out \nenough routine and periodic maintenance to keep the provincial road network in an acceptable \ncondition. The result is neglect and the deterioration of many roads (which then require costly \nrehabilitation works). The problem is compounded by a lack of road maintenance management \nprocesses  to  enable  the  PDOT  to  monitor  road  conditions,  quantify  work  requirements  and \ncosts,  and  substantiate  requests  for  increased  maintenance  budgets.  Road  failures  are \ncommon, because of a combination of inadequate design standards for the traffic loads, weak \nquality  management  during  construction,  inadequate  routine  maintenance,  and  failure  to \nregulate  truck  axle  loads.  A  study  under  the  World-Bank-funded  Road  Network  Improvement \nProject will help MOT to develop a heavy traffic management strategy. \n \n10. \nPoor road safety is a serious and growing problem throughout Viet Nam: 16 provinces in \nthe  central  region  reported  a  total  of  3,065  road  deaths  in  2003,  equivalent  to  17  deaths  per \nannum per 100,000 population, or 24 deaths per annum per 10,000 vehicles. The comparable \nfigure in the United Kingdom is 1.5 deaths per annum per 10,000 vehicles and in Thailand 5.5. \nThe road safety problem is most serious on the national highway network, but road deaths and \ninjuries will rise on provincial roads as they are improved, and as operating speeds and traffic \n\n\f3 \n\nincrease.  There  is  a  need  to  increase  awareness  of  road  safety  on  provincial  roads,  in  the \ncontext of the Government\u2019s national road safety program, with the PDOTs, road users and the \npublic all having a role to play.  Programs need to be introduced that are directed specifically at \nprovincial roads. \n \n\n1. \n\nGovernment\u2019s Strategy \n\n11. \nViet Nam\u2019s comprehensive poverty reduction and growth strategy (CPRGS), approved in \nMay  2002,  included  the  development  and  rehabilitation  of  the  transport  system  as  a  key \nelement. The CPRGS noted that improvements are needed at all levels of the transport network \nbut  specifically  identified  the  need  to  connect  to  poor  rural  areas  with  all-weather  roads.  The \nmain  issues  in  the  road  subsector  and  the  government\u2019s  strategy  to  address  them  are  as \nfollows.  First,  further  strategic  road  sector  investments  are  needed.  The  Government  has  a \nprogram  of  high-priority  investments  valued  at  approximately  $12  billion  to  be  implemented \nbetween 2001 and 2010. Second, maintenance needs to be improved and there needs to be a \nstable  source  of  maintenance  funding.  The  Government  is  working  to  improve  maintenance \nplanning systems and identify mechanisms to ensure secure funding. Third, road accidents and \nfatalities  need  to  be  reduced.  The  Government  has  developed  a  national  road  safety  strategy \nwhich will be implemented soon. Fourth, fragmentation needs to be reduced and public sector \ncapacity  increased.  The  Government  is  addressing  the  lack  of  coordination,  particularly  at  the \nVRA, the agency with maintenance and asset use responsibilities, but further work is required to \nestablish  a  systematic  and  modern  approach  to  road  asset  management  and  maintenance. \nFifth,  the  role  of  the  private  sector  needs  to  be  increased.  Current  government  efforts  have \nlargely focused on overcoming constraints on smaller private firms entering the market for road \nconstruction and smaller civil works. The entry of larger companies and private participation in \nlarger  public\u2013private  partnership  schemes,  such  a  build-operate-transfer  toll  roads,  has  been \nvery limited. \n \n\n2. \n\nADB\u2019s Strategy \n\n12. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  country  strategy  and  program  update  (CSPU), \napproved  in  August  2005,  emphasizes  (i) generating  economic  growth  and  (ii)  a  focus  on  the \ncentral region. The long-term objective of ADB\u2019s strategy for the road subsector in Viet Nam is \nan  economically  viable  road  network  that  meets  demands  for  access  and  efficiency.  The \nstrategy  requires  a  mix  of  investment  and  policy  interventions  to  build  both  the  physical \ninfrastructure of the road network and the legal and regulatory framework within which the road \nnetwork will be administered. The investment objective of the strategy is to help the Government \nto  improve  and  extend  the  road  network  to  meet  the  demands  created  by  rapid  economic \ngrowth  and  to  extend  the  benefits  of  this  growth  to  remote  rural  communities.  The  policy \nobjective  of  the  strategy  is  to  develop  the  capacity  of  road  administration  authorities  to \nadminister  the  road  sector  through  a  comprehensive  set  of  systems  that  address  planning, \nfunding,  implementation,  and  management  of  the  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance  of \nthe road network. \n \nThe  initial  focus  of  ADB  investments  was  the  rehabilitation  of  Route  1,  the  main  road \n13. \nconnecting  major  urban  and  economic  centers  along  Viet  Nam\u2019s  north\u2013south  axis.  Initial \nimprovement works on Route 1 have been completed, so ADB is now funding improvements to \nthe  provincial  road  networks.  These  networks  can  help  to  stimulate  economic  growth  and  the \nprovision  of  social  services  by  connecting  rural  areas  to  district,  provincial,  regional,  and \nnational centers. Initial policy work with the national administration now needs to be extended to \nprovincial road authorities.  \n\n\f4 \n\n \n14. \nSeparate action plans have been prepared to reflect the VRA\u2019s responsibility for national \nroad  networks  and  provincial  governments\u2019  responsibility  for  the  provincial  road  networks. \nThese action plans address (i) the legal framework for administration and responsibilities under \nthat  framework,  (ii)  the  development  of  the  road  network  to  promote  economic  growth  and \nimprove access to rural communities, (iii) the allocation of funds to maintain the road network, \n(iv)  the  allocation  of  funds  for  long-term  routine  and  periodic  maintenance,  (v)  institutional \ncapacity  for  road  maintenance  management,  (vi)  the  efficiency  of  road  maintenance  delivery, \nand  (vii)  road  safety  issues.  Policy  interventions  are  being  coordinated  with  other  donors, \nprincipally the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom (DFID), Japan \nBank for International Cooperation (JBIC), and the World Bank. The status of actions taken and \nfuture  actions  proposed  under  both  national  and  provincial  road  subsector  action  plans  are \nsummarized in Appendix 3. Actions required under the national road subsector action plan are \nbeing addressed under ongoing projects, including ADB\u2019s Third Road Improvement Project3 and \nProvincial  Roads  Improvement  Project,4    and  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Road  Network  Improvement \nProject. The provincial road subsector action plan was developed under the PPTA (footnote 1) \nand will be implemented under this Project. \n \n\n3. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\nSince the lifting of the embargo on external financing in 1993, there have been several  \n15. \nprojects  aimed  at  the  road  subsector  in  Viet  Nam.  Initially,  these  projects  focused  on \nrehabilitating National Highway 1, which runs along the eastern coast of Viet Nam and acts as \nthe central spine for the road network. With the work on National Highway 1 drawing to a close, \nprojects  are  increasingly  focusing  on  other  parts  of  the  road  network.  ADB\u2019s  Provincial  Roads \nImprovement  Project  (PRIP)  (footnote  4)  is  upgrading  provincial  roads  in  17  provinces  in  the \nnorthern  uplands  and  Red  River  Delta  regions.  The  upgrading  of  rural  roads  in  18  provinces \nwas  addressed  under  ADB\u2019s  Rural  Infrastructure  Sector  Project5  and  rural  roads  are  being \nimproved in 40 provinces across the country with funding from the World Bank and DFID under \nthe  Rural  Transport  1  (RT1)  and  Rural  Transport  2  (RT2)  projects.  External  assistance  to  the \nroad  subsector  is  summarized  in  Appendix  4.  Interventions  supported  by  international  donors \nhave  provided  (i)  funding  to  supplement  domestic  sources  for  priority  projects  with  high \neconomic returns, (ii) assistance in preparing and using contract documentation to international \nstandards,  (iii)  assistance  in  carrying  out  project  planning  and  implementation  to  international \nstandards,  and  (iv)  assistance  in  identifying  and  addressing  capacity  constraints  in  the \nadministration and management of the road subsector.  \n \n\n4. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n16. \nViet  Nam  country  portfolio  review  missions  have  noted  that  there  have  been \nimplementation delays in previous road projects, in particular during the project start-up phase. \nProject designs have required that project supervision consultants prepare detailed designs and \nbidding documents for civil works. Delays in recruiting such consultants, or in preparing detailed \ndesigns,  have  led  directly  to  delays  in  award  of  civil  works.  To  expedite  the  awarding  of  civil \nworks contacts for this Project, the preparation of detailed designs and bidding documents, and \n\n                                                 \n3   ADB.  1998.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Third Road Improvement Project. Manila (Loan 1653-VIE). \n\n4   ADB.  2001.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Provincial Roads Improvement Project. Manila (Loan 1888-VIE). \n\n5   ADB.  1997.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Rural Infrastructure Sector Project. Manila (Loan 1564-VIE).  \n\n\f5 \n\nprocurement  of  civil  works  for  the  roads  in  the  first  phase  will  be  undertaken  during  loan \nprocessing.  By  loan  effectiveness,  the  civil  works  contracts  for  the  roads  in  the  first  phase \nshould  be  ready  to  be  awarded,  allowing  funds  for  civil  works  to  be  disbursed  up  to  2  years \nearlier than for previous projects.  \n \n17. \nRecent reviews of ADB\u2019s portfolio in Viet Nam  have identified difficulties with contracts \nprocured  by  provincial  authorities.  However,  reviews  of  procurement  under  the  ongoing  PRIP \n(footnote 4) have concluded that the procurement arrangements and procedures adopted have \ngenerally been effective. This appears to be because provincial road sector agencies have had \ngreater  exposure  to  international  agencies  and  now  have  a  better  understanding  of  their \nprocurement  procedures  and  requirements.  Therefore,  the  procurement  arrangements  under \nthe PRIP have been adopted for this Project with minor adjustments to reflect lessons learned. \nThese  adjustments  principally  concern  ensuring  that  during  prequalification  the  previous \nexperience, bid capacity, and quality of work under previous contracts are correctly reflected in \nevaluations. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  felt  in  improved  access  to  markets,  employment \n18. \nopportunities, and social services by removing constraints on economic and social development \nin  rural  areas  of  the  central  region  of  Viet  Nam.  The  outcome  of  the  Project  will  be  to  induce \nmore efficient and cost-effective movement of passengers and goods in these rural areas.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n19. \nOutputs  from  the  Project  will  include  rehabilitation  of  and  improvements  to  about \n1,200 km  of  roads  connecting  selected  rural  areas  and  district  and  provincial  centers.  Road \nsafety  programs  will  be  implemented,  and  sustainable  road  and  bridge  asset  management \nsystems established. \n \n\n1. \n\nNetwork Improvements \n\n20. \nUnder this component about 1,200 km of roads will be improved to Viet Nam single-lane \n(Class V) or two-lane (Class IV) standard in 19 provinces in the central region. All roads will be \nrehabilitated with a sealed surface. The civil works will include repair or replacement of bridges \nand  culverts  either  as  part  of  improvements  or  as  separate  subprojects.  A  description  of  the \nproposed road improvements is given in Appendix 5. Under the PPTA (footnote 1) 4,200 km of \nroads  were  screened  to  create  a  long  list  covering  2,360  km  of  provincial  and  district  roads. \nFrom  this  list  subprojects  were  chosen  for  the  Project.  The  roads  in  this  subproject  list  were \nranked  and  for  each  province  priority  roads  were  identified  in  terms  of  their  importance  to \nprovincial and district road networks. Selection of subprojects took account of the need for each \nlink within the network as a whole. The civil works will be implemented in three phases. Phase 1 \nwill  cover  networks  in  four  provinces6  for  which  resettlement  plans  have  been  appraised. \nPreparation work has been completed to a point where detailed design work can begin. Phase 2 \nwill cover five provinces7 for which subprojects have been identified but implementation has not \n\n                                                 \n6   Binh Thuan, Lam Dong, Nghe An, and Thuan Thie Hue provinces. \n7   Dak Lak, Dak Nong, Ha Tinh, Ninh Thuan, and Quang Tri provinces. \n \n\n\f6 \n\nbeen  fully  prepared.  Road  links  within  each  network  have  been  selected  and  technical  and \neconomic  viability  confirmed.  Phase  3  will  cover  10  provinces  for  which  subprojects  will  be \nselected during project implementation on the basis of prioritized long lists.  \n \nSubproject Selection. Under the PPTA (footnote 1) each province in the central region \n21. \nwas  asked  to  provide  a  long  list  of  provincial  and  district  roads  requiring  upgrading  or \nrehabilitation.  These  lists  were  screened  and  ranked  using  simple  social  and  economic \nindicators.  The  resulting  prioritized  list  of  roads  was  compiled  into  a  provincial  road  sector \ndevelopment plan (PRSDP) for each of the 19 provinces in the central region (Supplementary \nAppendix A). For nine provinces, subproject networks were identified, containing priority roads \nfrom  the  PRSDP.  The  principles  used  in  drawing  up  these  subproject  networks  included \n(i) extending  networks  to  connect  rural  areas,  and  (ii)  maintaining  links  across  networks. \nEvaluations  of  these  nine  networks  showed  them  to  be  technically  feasible  and  economically \njustified.  From  these  nine  provincial  subproject  networks,  four  were  selected  and  resettlement \nplans prepared. These four resettlement plans were regarded as representative of the range of \nresettlement  impacts  that  could  be  expected  under  the  Project.  Sample  initial  environmental \nexaminations  (IEEs)  were  prepared  for  road  networks  in  three  provinces,  selected  as  being \nrepresentative of the range of environmental impacts that could be expected under the Project. \nThe  results  of  these  sample  IEEs  were  used  to  prepare  the  project  IEE;  a  summary  of  the \nproject IEE is in Supplementary Appendix B. A survey of the nine selected provinces indicated \nthat, although ethnic minorities lived within the zones of influence of some road links, they were \ngenerally  well  assimilated  and  the  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  was  not  triggered. \nHowever, where appropriate, special actions for ethnic minorities were included in resettlement \nplans.  \n \n22. \nTo  be  eligible  for  financing  under  the  Project,  subprojects  have  to  be  (i)  technically \njustified8 and economically viable,9 (ii) environmentally and socially responsible, (iii) part of the \nprovincial  road  sector  development  plan  (PRSDP),  and  (iv)  in  compliance  with  all  applicable \nADB policies. Roads that provide a connection to an international border, or where rehabilitation \nwork  will  cause  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts,  cannot  be  included  in  the  Project. \nThe  process  by  which  subprojects  will  be  selected,  evaluated,  and  prepared  is  set  out  in \nAppendix  6.  For  each  subproject,  the  Ministry  of  Transport\u2019s  PMU-1  submits  a  request  for \napproval to ADB that includes (i) a technical design and economic evaluation report, (iii) an IEE \nor  environmental  impact  assessment,  (iv)  the  Government\u2019s  environment  approval,  and  (v)  a \nresettlement plan. If surveys show that ethnic minorities lie within the zone of influence of any \nsubproject,  and  that  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  is  triggered,  then  an  ethnic  minority \ndevelopment plan (EMDP) must also be submitted in a format acceptable to ADB.  \n \n23. \nResettlement.  A  resettlement  policy  framework  (RPF)  and  four  resettlement  plans  for \nBinh  Thuan,  Lam  Dong,  Nghe  An,  and  Thuan  Thie  Hue  Phase  1  road  networks  have  been \nprepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. Consultations with and \nparticipation of affected communities and local government agencies were carried out during the \npreparation  of  the  RPF  and  resettlement  plans.    The  RPF  and  resettlement  plans  require  that \neveryone  affected  by  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  adequately  compensated  for  lost \nassets and that sufficient measures are taken to ensure that they are able to restore pre-project \nliving standards. Special assistance will be provided to the poorest and vulnerable people.   \n \n\n                                                 \n8   The technical justification must include connections to the provincial road network. \n9   The economic internal rate of return will exceed 12% for eligible subprojects. \n\n\f7 \n\nBased on the preliminary results of the census and inventory of losses for four provinces \n24. \ncarried out during the PPTA (footnote 1), about 400 affected households (about 2,073 people) \nhave  been  identified.  The  road  improvement  will  entail  the  acquisition  of  6  hectares  (ha)  of \nagricultural land, 5 ha of residential land, 990 square meters (m2) of salt making land, and 630 \nm2  of  fishpond.    It  will  also  partially  affect  three  house/shops  and  permanently  affect  27 \nstructures  (fences  and  toilets)  and  67  graves.    An  estimated  5,300  trees,  1,800  m  of  plant \nfences, and 53 ha of crops will also be affected by the Project in these four provinces.    \n \nDuring loan implementation, the four resettlement plans will be updated for Phase 1 and \n25. \nresettlement  plans  for  Phases  2  and  3  will  be  prepared  following  detailed  designs.    Updating \nand  preparation  of  resettlement  plans  will  involve  consultations  and  community  participation, \ndetailed  measurement  surveys  (DMSs),  establishment  of  compensation  unit  rates  for  all \ncategories  of  losses  and  allowances,  and  formulation  of  rehabilitation  measures  for  severely \naffected,  very  poor,  and  other  vulnerable  groups.    Disclosure  of  resettlement  plans  will  be \nthrough  the  distribution  of  project  information  brochures  (in  Vietnamese  and,  as  required, \nminority languages) to the affected communities. Copies of resettlement plans will be placed in \nprovincial, district, and commune offices.  All resettlement plans submitted to ADB for review will \nbe posted on the ADB website immediately upon ADB approval. A summary of the resettlement \npolicy  framework  is  in  Appendix  7  and  a  summary  of  the  resettlement  plans  for  the  Phase  1 \nroads is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n26. \nEthnic  Minorities.    An  initial  social  assessment  was  carried  out  during  the  PPTA  for \nPhases 1 and 2.  About 55,000 people from ethnic minorities live along roads on five of the nine \nnetworks, representing about 6.2% of the total population living along the roads in Phases 1 and \n2. Although the roads where these ethnic minorities live are in a poor condition, and often allow \nonly  seasonal  access,  these  communities  have  access  to  some  degree,  are  living  among  the \nmajority Kinh people, and are assimilated to varying degrees. Therefore, the impacts on ethnic \nminorities are expected to be limited.   \n \n27. \nAn  ethnic  minority  development  framework  (EMDF)  has  been  prepared  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1999), and policies and programs of the Government \nof Viet Nam.  The EMDF will serve as guide in the preparation of ethnic minority specific actions \n(EMSA) if the impacts are found to be limited and ethnic minority development plans (EMDPs) if \nthe  impacts  are  significant.  The  EMDF  includes  other  measures  to  address  ethnic  minorities, \nsuch  as  incorporation  of  road  safety  measures  in  road  designs,  an  HIV/AIDS10  and  sexually \ntransmitted  infections  (STI)  awareness  and  prevention  program,  and  sustainable  agricultural \nproduction.  A summary ethnic minority development framework is presented in Appendix 8. \n \n\n2. \n\nInstitutional Development Component \n\nThis  component  will  address  the  need  to  improve  management  of  provincial  road \n28. \nnetworks  as  set  out  in  the  provincial  roads  policy  action  plan  in  Appendix  3.  Activities  will \ncomprise  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  help  the  PDOTs  to  carry  out  core  road  management \nactivities.  Consultants  will  work  with  the  PDOTs  to  (i)  prepare  provincial  road  network  plans; \n(ii) implement  provincial  road  maintenance  management  processes;  (iii)  increase  efficiency  of \nimplementation of periodic maintenance plans by introducing competitive bidding; (iv) establish \na  resettlement,  social,  and  environmental  capacity;  and  (v)  establish  a  pilot  provincial  road \nsafety program in three provinces. This technical assistance has been designed to be consistent \nwith  the  proposed  DFID-funded  assistance  to  32  PDOTs  under  the  Rural  Transport  3  Project \n\n                                                 \n10 Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome \n\n\f8 \n\n(RT3).  Under  this  component,  assistance  will  be  given  to  10  central  region  provinces; \nassistance  to  the  remainder  will  be  given  under  the  DFID-funded  program.  Training  of  PDOT \nstaff and basic equipment will be provided to support the technical assistance. \n \nC. \n\nADF IX Grant Component \n\n29.  When access to communities in remote areas is improved, they may become vulnerable \nto HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases and to exploitation through human trafficking unless \nmeasures  are  taken.  The  Project  will  therefore  design,  implement,  and  monitor  a  gender,  HIV \nand  anti-trafficking  prevention  program  that  will  target  project  communities,  construction \nworkers,  civil  servants,  and  the  mobile  population.    This  will  include:  (i)  a  baseline  survey  on \nHIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and village populations, which will include \ncollecting epidemiological information and a knowledge, attitude, behavior, and practice survey; \n(ii) formation of village monitoring groups; (iii) preventive education and awareness through peer \neducation and training of trainers; (iv) behavior, communication, and change (BCC) awareness, \nincluding preparation of information, education, and communication (IEC) materials; and (v) STI \nservices  and  counseling  and  voluntary  testing,  condom  promotion,  and  distribution.  This \nprogram  will  be  implemented  through  awareness  programs  under  consulting  services  (i)  in \nconstruction  camps,  and  (ii)  for  the  general  population,  including  civil  servants  and  mobile \npopulations.  Because  of  women's  greater  exposure  to  the  risks  and  impact  of  HIV/AIDS,  the \nProject will ensure that women, and especially women from ethnic minorities, are involved in the \ndesign and implementation of HIV and human trafficking prevention, and that they participate in \nany community-based structures to be established under the Project to monitor HIV/AIDS and \nprevent human trafficking. \n \nD. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n30. \nThe selection of subprojects was based on an assessment of gaps in the road networks \nin each of the provinces within the project area. A gap may be (i) a missing link; (ii) a link that \nrequires  upgrading  when  capacity  is  insufficient  to  meet  demand;  or  (iii)  a  link  that  requires \nrehabilitation  when  the  existing  road  is  in  poor  condition  or  allows  only  seasonal  access.  This \nnetwork  approach  means  that  each  road  link  selected  as  a  subproject  not  only  connects \ncommunities  along  each  link  but  also  connects  these  communities  to  the  wider  economy \nthrough the wider road network. \n \n31. \nDuring  project  preparation,  discussions  were  held  with  other  development  partners  to \nmaximize the impact of the Project. Selection of roads for inclusion in the Project will take into \naccount  the  location  of  bridges  to  be  improved,  or  replaced,  under  the  JBIC-funded  Weak \nBridge Replacement Project, which is part of the $90.4 million transport sector loan for national \nroad improvement. The  institutional development component has been designed to link with a \nDFID-funded  $12  million  program,  so  that  the  combined  interventions  cover  all  provincial \ngovernments. \n \nE. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n32. \nThe  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $138  million  equivalent,  including  physical  and \nprice  contingencies,  taxes  and  duties,  and  interest  charges  during  construction.  The  foreign \nexchange component is $84.99 million (61.6% of the total project cost) and the local currency \ncomponent is $53.02 million equivalent (38.4%). These costs are based on estimates for typical \nroads in the terrain encountered in the project provinces based on the feasibility study prepared \n\n\f9 \n\nunder the PPTA (footnote 1). Table 1 shows a breakdown of costs. Detailed cost estimates and \na financing plan for the Project are given in Appendix 9.  \n \nF. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n33. \nThe Project\u2019s financing plan is summarized in Table 2 and details are given in Appendix \n9.  It  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  $94.5  million  equivalent,  denominated  in  special \ndrawing rights from its Special Funds resources. The ADF loan will have a term of 32 years with \na grace period of 8 years. There will be an interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace \nperiod  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  The  Borrower  for  the  Project  will  be  the  Socialist \nRepublic of Viet Nam. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be responsible for repayment of the \nloan. The MOF will provide counterpart funds to the Ministry of Transport (MOT) through priority \nbudgetary  allocations.  ADB  has  provided  $1  million  for  the  PPTA,  funded  from  the  Japan \nSpecial Fund (footnote 1). \n \n34. \nIt  is  also  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  grant  of  $0.5  million  from  its  Special  Funds \nresources.  This  grant  will  finance  the  gender,  HIV  and  anti-trafficking  prevention  program  and \nwill fund consulting services, training, and incremental expenditures required to implement the \nprogram.  \n \n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\n  \n  \n \n\nItem \n\n  \n  \n \nA.

Such  cofinancing  would  benefit  from  ADB  credit \nenhancement,  including  ADB  guarantee  instruments,  and  would  be  presented  separately  for \nBoard consideration.  \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan12\n($ million) \n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \nSource \n\n \n \nADF Loan \nADB \nADF Grant \nADB \nNDF \nConcessional Loan \nGovernment  Counterpart Funds \n\nTotal \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nTotal \nCost \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n18.2 \n0.2 \n2.6 \n32.0 \n53.0 \n\n94.5\n0.5\n11.0\n32.0\n138.0\n\n76.3\n0.3\n8.4\n0.0\n85.0\n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund, NDF = Nordic Development Fund. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \nThe amount of local currency funding reflects the fact that the Government has difficulty \n37. \nmobilizing  sufficient  funds  from  its  own  resources  to  meet  all  development  commitments, \nincluding  rehabilitating  and  upgrading  critical  physical  and  social  infrastructure.  Although  the \nneed to generate domestic resources to finance investments for sustaining economic growth is \nwell  recognized,  the  country\u2019s  resources  cannot  finance  the  investments  needed  without \nexternal  assistance.  Under  the  current  circumstances,  a  large  saving-investment  gap  will \ncontinue exerting pressure on development programs; thus external support is needed to meet \nsome of the local costs of the projects.  In line with ADB\u2019s policy to help provide local currency \ncost  financing,  particularly  for  projects  that  address  poverty  in  economically  less-developed \nregions, about 19% of the loan will be for that purpose.  \n \nG. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n38. \nThe  Executing  Agency  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and  responsibility  for  planning \nand  coordination  will  be  delegated  to  Project  Management  Unit  No  1  (PMU-1),  which  has \nconsiderable experience of implementing ADB-financed projects.  PMU-1 will be responsible for \nprocurement  and  awarding  consultant  and  civil  works  contracts.  The  PDOTs  will  be  the \nImplementing Agencies in their respective provinces. They will require support and assistance \nfrom  PMU-1  and  the  project  consultants  to  manage  and  implement  the  civil  works  and \nresettlement plans effectively, as well as to prepare subprojects. Project coordination will be the \n\n                                                 \n11  At appraisal, March 2005. \n12  The  allocation  of  loan  proceeds  in  the  Loan  Agreement  is  presented  in  the  SDR  (Special  Drawing  Rights) \nequivalent of $94.5 million, with reference only to total expenditure, in accordance with the policy on Cost Sharing \nand Eligibility of Expenditures for Asian Development Bank Financing: A New Approach. Similarly, the allocation of \ngrant proceeds in the Grant Agreement is presented as US$0.5 million, with reference only to total expenditure. \n\n\f11 \n\nthe  MOT  vice-minister  assigned \n\nthe  Project.  A  preparation  and \nresponsibility  of \nimplementation manual written during project preparation will be used by PMU-1 during project \nimplementation.  The  Project\u2019s  organization  and  implementation  arrangements  are  shown  in \nAppendix 10. \n \n\nto \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n39. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  in  three  phases  over  4  years.  Field  investigations, \ndetailed design, cost estimates, resettlement and procurement for the Phase 1 contracts started \nin September 2005 and have proceeded in parallel with loan processing.  Construction of Phase \n1 civil works is planned to start in July 2006. Preparation of documentation and commencement \nof civil works for Phases 2 and 3 will follow sequentially as individual tasks are completed under \nPhase 1. Construction of Phase 2 civil works is planned to start in January 2007 and for Phase \n3  in  July  2007.  The  Phase  3  construction  is  scheduled  to  be  completed  in  June  2009.  The \nProject will be complete when the contractors\u2019 liability for the repair of defects and maintenance \nends in June 2010. A summary implementation schedule is in Appendix 11. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n40. \nAll  procurement  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Civil \nworks  will  be  implemented  through  a  number  of  contracts  valued  at  between  $500,000  and \n$2 million.  Each  province  will  have  up  to  four  contracts,  for  a  total  of  about  68  contracts. \nContracts  valued  at  up  to  $2  million  will  be  procured  using  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB) \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. Details of proposed contracts for Phases 1 and 2 are given in \nAppendix  12.  In  essence,  these  procedures  will  generally  follow  those  of  the  provincial  road \ncomponents of the ongoing PRIP (footnote 4) and World Bank-financed rural transport projects.  \nHarmonized bidding documents for use on all donor-funded LCB contracts are being prepared. \nOnce  they  are  approved  for  use  on  ADB  projects,  these  documents  will  be  adopted;  pending \nthis, the documents used for earlier projects, which have been approved by ADB, will be used. \nA  civil  works  contract  for  the  construction  of,  and  the  provision  of  office  equipment  for,  an \noperations  office  for  PMU-1  in  Da  Nang  will  be  procured  using  LCB  procedures.  Approval  for \nadvance procurement action has been granted, and the Government has been advised that this \napproval does not commit ADB to finance the ensuing Project. \n \n41. \nADB and the World Bank have been engaged in the reform of state-owned enterprises \n(SOE) as part of an enterprise reform and corporate governance program. The purpose of the \nreforms  is  to  promote  competitive  practices,  maximize  private  sector  involvement  for  ADB-\nfinanced projects, and support SOE corporatization or privatization. Under this program, it has \nbeen agreed that, to be eligible to bid on ADB funded projects from 1 January 2005, enterprises \npreviously owned by the state must be legally and financially independent from MOT and must \noperate under the Government\u2019s commercial laws.  \n \n42. \nThere  are  about  400  construction  companies  operating  in  the  19  central  region \nprovinces, of which about 130 have annual turnovers of greater than $1 million. However, most \nof the larger companies are SOEs that may be ineligible to bid under ADB\u2019s conflict-of-interest \nguidelines, or joint stock companies that may also be ineligible under the guidelines set out in \nparagraph 41. A further 160 construction companies are small private companies with an annual \nturnover  of  less  than  $500,000.  These  small  private  companies  do  not  have  the  financial  or \ntechnical  capacity  to  undertake  the  type  of  work  required  under  the  Project  as  individual \ncompanies. The remaining 110 construction companies are private contractors with an annual \nturnover  greater  than  $500,000.  To  ensure  that  enough  qualified  private  contractors,  together \n\n\f12 \n\nwith those larger contractors that are eligible, are available to bid for the Project\u2019s contracts, the \nnumber and size of contracts have been specified to be within the capacity of these contractors. \n \n43. \nDetailed  procurement  procedures  and  sample  procurement  documentation  have  been \ndeveloped  in  consultation  with  PMU-1.  They  incorporate  the  experience  of  similar  ADB  and \nWorld  Bank-financed  projects,  particularly  the  PRIP  (footnote  4).  After  MOT  review  and \napproval, the procedures and documentation will be submitted to ADB for approval before the \nfirst  bids  are  invited.  Ideally,  all  the  contracts  for  a  particular  province  should  be  procured \nsimultaneously.  A  contractor\u2019s  performance  in  an  earlier  phase  will  determine  whether  the \ncompany  can  participate  in  bidding  for  the  subsequent  phases.  The  number  of  contracts  a \ncontractor  can  be  awarded  will  be  determined  by  the  company\u2019s  capacity  to  execute  multiple \ncontracts. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n44. \nAbout 275 person-months of international consultants and about 2,965 person-months of \ndomestic  consultants  will  be  required  to  assist  in  (i)  selection  of  subprojects,  preparation  of \nimplementation  documentation,  and  assistance  in  bidding;  (ii)  construction  supervision, \nincluding  preparation  and \nimplementation  of  resettlement  plans,  EMDPs  (if  required), \nHIV/AIDS/STI  awareness  and  prevention  programs,  and  IEEs  with  environment  management \nplans;  (ii)  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation;  (iii)  institutional  strengthening  and \ncapacity building for provincial agencies in the administration and management of the provincial \nroad networks; and (iv) preparing and implementing a provincial road safety program.  A list of \ncontract  packages  and  modes  of  recruitment  are  given  in  Appendix  12.  The  consultants  are \nexpected to be recruited as an association of international and domestic firms, as appropriate, \nengaged  by  the  Government.  The  overall  period  of  the  services  will  be  about  42  months. \nFurnished office facilities and utilities, vehicles, and equipment required by the consultants will \nbe  provided  under  the  Project.  Field  offices  and  material  testing  laboratories  with  utilities  and \nmotorcycles  required  by  construction  inspectors  will  be  supplied  through  civil  works  contracts. \nEquipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n45. \nConsulting services to be funded from ADB and NDF loan funds have been divided into \nfour  packages  as  set  out  below.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  each  consulting  services \npackage are in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n\n(i) \n\nCivil  works  preparation  consulting  services.    To  avoid  the  startup  delays \nencountered  in  previous  projects,  consultants  will  assist  in  the  preparation  of \ndetailed  designs  and  civil  works  bidding  for  Phase  1  and  2  roads.  Recruitment \nwill be based on direct selection procedures under the Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  by  ADB  and  Its  Borrowers.  Recruitment  will  be  based  on  quality-\nbased  selection  documents  with  a  full  proposal.  It  is  proposed  that  the  PPTA \nconsultant  be  engaged  for  these  services,  as  this  consultant  has  successfully \ncompleted  the  services  under  the  PPTA  and  has  extensive  knowledge  of  the \nproject. A request will not, therefore, be made to require the PPTA consultant to \nabstain  from  future  work  on  the  Project.  The  Government  has  requested  that \nfunds  from  the  loan  be  applied  retroactively  to  these  services  up  to  a  limit  of \n$2.5 million  equivalent  (approximately  3.5%  of  the  loan  amount)  and  that  the \nperiod of eligibility be from 21 March 2005.13 This date will be within a period of \n12  months  prior  to  loan  effectiveness.  The  amount  requested  and  the  period  of \n\n                                                 \n13  The first day of the loan appraisal mission. \n\n\f13 \n\neligibility are within the normal limits for sector loans. The use of direct selection \nand  retroactive  financing  is  justified  as  the  proposed  services  are  to  complete \npreparatory  work  for  the  award  of  civil  works  contracts  and  are  targeted  at \nreducing delays in the physical commencement of civil works. \nProject implementation services. These services will include the preparation of \nimplementation  documents  for  Phase  3  and  construction  supervision  for  all \nPhases. These services will be funded by NDF and recruitment will be based on \nNDF guidelines. \nInstitutional development services. These services will prepare and implement \ninstitutional  strengthening,  capacity  building,  and  road  safety  programs  for  the \nprovincial  agencies  responsible  for  administering  and  managing    the  provincial \nroad  networks.  These  services  will  be  funded  by  NDF  and  recruitment  will  be \nbased on NDF guidelines. \nGender, HIV and anti-trafficking prevention program. These services include \nthe design and implementation of a program that will target project communities \nfor Phases 1, 2, and 3. Quality- and cost-based selection procedures will apply, \nwith biodata proposals.  \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n46. \nIn addition to the above four packages, the Government will recruit and fund consulting \nservices for (i) external monitoring of resettlement implementation, and (ii) unexploded ordnance \nclearance. Recruitment for these services will be based on normal government procedures for \nthe recruitment of consultants.  \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n47. \nTo  expedite  funds  flows,  PMU-1  will  use  ADB\u2019s  imprest  account  procedure  for  eligible \nproject expenditures, except those under a consulting services contract which may use ADB\u2019s \ndirect payment procedure. Payments from PMU-1 for civil works contractors will be made from \nan  imprest  account  held  at  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  the  Government  and  ADB. \nSelected  provinces  in  Phases  2  and  3  will  make  payments  to  civil  works  contractors  from \nsecond generation imprest accounts (SGIA). Selection criteria for these provinces will be based \non their capacity to manage an SGIA and maintain adequate records. The initial deposit to the \nimprest  account  will  be  based  on  estimated  expenditures  for  the  first  6  months  of  the  project \nimplementation or $5,000,000, whichever is lower. The amount to be deposited into each of the \nSGIAs  shall  not  exceed  the  equivalent  of  the  PDOT\u2019s  6-month  estimated  expenditure  or \n$100,000,  whichever  is  lower.  The  imprest  account  and  SGIAs  will  be  established,  managed, \nreplenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook of January \n2001,  as  amended  from  time  to  time,  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  between  the \nBorrower  and  ADB.  The  statement  of  expenditure  (SOE)  will  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible \nexpenditures  and  liquidate  advances  to  the  imprest  account  to  ensure  speedy  project \nimplementation. The ceiling for the SOE is $100,000 per payment. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nPMU-1 will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify the goods and \n48. \nservices  financed  from  the  proceeds  of  the  loan,  the  financing  resources  received,  the \nexpenditures incurred for the Project, an audit of resettlement expenditures, and the use of local \nfunds. Within 6 months of the close of the each year, PMU-1 will submit audited annual project \naccounts to ADB, which provide a detailed description of the source of funds and expenditures \nmade.  Annual  project  accounts  will  be  audited  by  an  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  the \n\n\f14 \n\nauditor\u2019s terms of reference will be approved by ADB before commencement of work. The audit \nresults will be submitted to ADB on an annual basis. \n \n49. \nRegular  progress  reports  on  the  Project  will  be  prepared  by  PMU-1  and  submitted  to \nADB  every  quarter.  They  will  include  a  description  of  the  physical  progress,  status  of \nimplementation of resettlement plans, procurement and contractual status, and highlights of any \nimplementation  issues.  The  progress  reports  should  also  contain  a  summary  of  project \naccounts,  including  details  of  the  latest  project  expenditures  and  contract  amounts.  These \nreports  will  include  an  evaluation  of  progress  in  implementing  the  Project.  Within  3  months  of \nphysical  completion  of  the  project,  PMU-1  will  furnish  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report \ncovering details of the project implementation, costs, and an evaluation of the Project\u2019s success \nin meeting performance targets. \n \n50. \nADB's  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Government  and \nPMU-1.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability  and  transparency, \nADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt, \nfraudulent,  collusive  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB's Anticorruption Policy are included in the Loan Regulations and the \nbidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with \nthe Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records \nand  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants  and  other \nservice providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n51. \nPMU-1,  assisted  by  the  consultants,  will  establish  systematic  project  performance \nmonitoring  and  analysis  throughout  the  life  of  the  Project  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Project \nPerformance  Management  System  Handbook,  integrating  it  with  the  existing  management \ninformation system. Initially, the monitoring system will develop and conduct sample surveys to \nestablish  baseline  data  for  subsequent  performance  monitoring  and  will  establish  pre-project \nsocial and economic living conditions for the direct project beneficiaries. A second survey will be \ncarried out on project completion and a third survey after a period of not less than 2 years after \nproject completion. The baseline and impact surveys will include appropriate control areas and \nwill  assess  all  interventions  under  the  project,  including  resettlement  and  other  safeguard \ninterventions  that  affect  the  livelihood  of  project  beneficiaries.  In  addition,  a  set  of  indicators \nreflecting transport costs, tariffs and mobility will be developed to assess the effects of improved \naccess to the area. District indicators will include agricultural productivity, economic activity, and \nhealth  and  education  indicators.  The  impacts  of  development  on  the  poor  resulting  from \nimproved road access will receive particular attention. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n52. \nIn addition to regular reviews by ADB, a midterm review of project implementation will be \ncarried  out.    Representatives  of  ADB,  the  Government,  and  NDF  will  take  part  in  the  review.  \nThe review will allow for any necessary midcourse corrections.  \n \n\n\f15 \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nProject Benefits \n\nThe project will promote economic growth and social development in inaccessible rural \n53. \nareas  with  a  high  incidence  of  poverty.  The  project  will  relieve  the  isolation  of  these  areas  by \nreducing travel cost and travel time, and eliminating traffic disruption during the wet season. It \nwill  enable  continuous  trade  and  economic  exchange,  and  uninterrupted  access  to  schools, \nmedical  facilities,  and  other  social  and  civil  services.  The  direct  benefits  will  be  (i) savings  in \nvehicle  operating  costs  and  (ii) savings  in  passenger  time  costs.  The  indirect  benefits  will  be \n(i) induced  lower  input  and  consumer  prices  and  (ii) greater  economic  activity  in  the  project \narea.  However,  the  indirect  benefits  cannot  be  estimated  with  precision  and,  therefore,  they \nhave not been taken into account in the quantitative assessment of net benefits. \n \n54. \nBased on the assessment of the direct net benefits only, the project\u2019s economic internal \nrate of return (EIRR) has been estimated at 22.3%. A cost-benefit analysis shows that the nine \nroad networks that were examined have EIRRs ranging from 12.5% to 43.6%. Sensitivity testing \nindicates that the economic viability of the project is robust against perceived project risks. The \nswitching values14 for the overall project are estimated as a 98% increase in capital cost, or a \n52% decrease in vehicle operating cost savings, or a decrease in traffic growth by 7%. Neither \nreducing  passenger  time  savings  nor  delaying  project  benefits  will  reduce  net  benefits  to  the \npoint that the Project is no longer economically feasible. \n \n55. \nThe incidence of poverty in the project provinces ranges from 16% to 53% depending on \nthe  province,  against  a  national  average  of  29%.  Poverty  is  highest  in  the  central  highlands \n(52%)  and  the  northern  coastal  area  (44%),  and  lowest  in  the  southern  coastal  area  (25%). \nRural  poverty  is  substantially  higher than  urban  poverty,  ranging  from  34%  to  65%  depending \non the province, which is significantly above the national average (urban poverty in the project \nprovinces  ranges  from  11%  to  24%).  The  project  will  increase  accessibility  in  rural  areas  by \nimproving  the  links  from  economic  and  social  centers  to  inaccessible  communities,  which \ncurrently  suffer  slow,  expensive  and  often  interrupted  access  to  services  and  facilities.  The \nproject roads have been selected on a network basis to ensure that the rural areas they serve \nare securely connected to centers of economic exchange and social service delivery. This will \n(i) encourage agricultural production beyond subsistence farming;15 (ii) reduce the cost of food \nfor the landless because of both increased local production and a greater inflow of food items at \nlower cost, which is important since food poverty remains high in the project area;16 (iii) improve \naccess  to  nonfarm  employment  opportunities,  which  will  help  reduce  dependency  on \nsubsistence  agriculture  and  seasonal  labor;  (iv)  improve  access  to  health  facilities  and \nmedication, which will reduce the risk and severity of health hazards; and (v) improve access to \neducation,  which  increases  the  chances  that  the  young  can  increase  their  future  earnings \npotential. The ability of the public sector to provide these services efficiently will be enhanced by \n\n                                                 \n14  A  switching  value  identifies  the  percentage  change  in  a  variable  for  the  economic  net  present  value  to  become \n\nzero, the EIRR to fall to the cut-off rate, and the project decision to change. \n\n15  The  validity  of  this  mechanism  in  Viet  Nam  has  been  demonstrated  in  several  studies,  including  an  ADB  RETA \n(ADB.  2000.  Technical  Assistance  for  Assessing  the  Impact  of  Transport  and  Energy  Infrastructure  on  Poverty \nReduction.  Manila  [RETA-5947])  and  the  Viet  Nam  Living  Standards  Survey  (VLSS),  which  is  a  periodic, \ncomprehensive  household  survey  carried  out  in  1993,  1998,  and  most  recently  in  2002),  which\u2015in  1993\u2015found \nthat agricultural production and productivity drops rapidly when the distance from the farm to a trafficable road is \nmore than 3 km. \n\n16 Food poverty refers to the very poor, people who cannot afford a diet of 2,100 calories per day. The incidence of \nfood  poverty  is  9.0%  in  the  southern  coastal  area,  17.5%  in  the  northern  coastal  area,  and  29.5%  in  the  central \nhighlands. \n\n\f16 \n\nbetter road access. The Project\u2019s impact on poverty has been quantified by examining the share \nof total project net benefits that will accrue to the poor. The distributional analysis indicates that \nthe  project  yields  a  poverty  impact  ratio  of  0.46.  The  high  poverty  impact  ratio  reflects  a  high \nincidence  of  poverty  among  direct  beneficiaries17  and  a  substantial  net  transfer  of  resources \nfrom the economy at large to the project area.  \n \nB. \n\nProject Impacts \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement.  The Project will require the acquisition of mostly \n56. \nagricultural land, typically in narrow strips along one or both sides of the existing road alignment.  \nThere  will  be  no  physical  displacement  of  houses.    However,  secondary  structures  (fences, \ntoilets, kitchens), graves, crops, and trees will be affected by the road improvement as set out in \nparagraph  24.  Adverse  impacts  will  be  mitigated  by  satisfactory  resettlement  planning  and \nimplementation  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  and  the \nresettlement policy framework adopted for this Project.  The objective is to improve or at least \nrestore  living  standards,  income-earning  capacity,  and  production  levels  of  affected  people.  \nSpecial  assistance  will  be  provided  to  the  poorest  and  most  vulnerable  people  to  help  them \nimprove their socioeconomic status. \n \n57. \nEthnic Minorities.  The impacts on ethnic minorities in Phases 1 and 2 will be limited.  \nMany  of  the  roads  are  in  poor  condition  and  pass  through sparsely  populated  rural  areas,  but \nthe  roads  have  been  in  existence  for  some  time,  providing  access  for  the  ethnic  minority \ncommunities,  although some  are  closed  for  periods  of  days  during  the  rainy  season.    Overall, \nmost  ethnic  minorities  along  the  project  roads  live  among  majority  Kinh  people  and  are \nassimilated to varying degrees. In Lam Dong province, where the ethnic minority population is \nsignificant,  an  ethnic  minority  specific  action  (EMSA)  has  been  incorporated  into  the  draft \nresettlement  plan  to  provide  for  consultations  in  ethnic  languages.  An  ethnic  minority \ndevelopment  framework  has  also  been  prepared  to  guide  the  preparation  of  the  EMSA  and \nEMDPs in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples. \n \n58. \nEnvironment.  The environmental impacts of the subprojects will be limited, as the civil \nworks  will  generally  be  restricted  to  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  existing  roads.  Upgrading \nworks will generally be along the same alignment as the existing roads but short sections of new \nroad will be constructed to improve alignments and to address safety concerns. In addition, the \nProject includes some subprojects that may affect nature reserves or other protected areas and \nrelated ecological resources.  IEEs for sample subprojects have been conducted and mitigation \nthe  site-specific  environmental \nmeasures  and  monitoring  programs  were  proposed \nmanagement plans (EMPs) as part of the IEEs to address those potential impacts. With careful \nimplementation of the proposed EMPs and good engineering practices (such as spoil disposal, \nerosion  control,  quarry  and  borrow  sites  selection,  and  management  and  rehabilitation), \nenvironmental  impacts  will  be  reduced  to  acceptable  level.    Further  risks  are  minimized  by \nhaving  the  environmental  selection  criteria  in  place  for  future  subprojects  and  by  conducting \nIEEs  for  the  selected  subprojects,  as  specified  under  ADB's  sector  loan  environmental \nassessment  requirements.  IEEs  will  be  prepared  for  all  subprojects  based  on  agreed \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  procedures.  Within  the  central  region,  there  are  areas \nwith significant unexploded ordnance and surveys will be undertaken to determine the extent of \ncontamination. All unexploded ordnance will be cleared. \n \n\nin \n\n                                                 \n17 The project road user survey found that 47.3% of road users were poor. Of these, 31% live just below the poverty \n\nline while 16.3% were very poor. \n\n\f17 \n\nC. \n\nProject Risks \n\n59. \nSustainability.  With  a  cost  of  $138  million,  the  Project  represents  about  5%  of  MOT's \nplanned  annual  program.  Over  the  period  1999\u20132002,  the  national  budget  has  funded  about \n65%  of  total  commitments  in  the  transport  sector  through  the  annual  budgeting  process. \nGovernment  support  to  the  transport  sector  will  continue  and  the  Government  has  confirmed \nthat  counterpart  funds  for  donor-assisted  projects  will  be  allocated  on  a  priority  basis. \nMaintenance  of  the  project  roads  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  provincial  authorities.  By \ninternational  standards,  funding  for  road  maintenance  is  low  but  systems  are  required  to \ndetermine  the  actual  needs.  As  an  interim  measure,  the  provincial  roads  sector  policy  action \nplan requires that by project completion the provinces will have increased the amount allocated \nto provincial road networks by 100% from that allocated in 2004. On average this would equate \nto  a  10%  increase  in  the  annual  provincial  budget  allocated  to  roads.  These  funds  will  be \nallocated from each provincial government\u2019s annual budget allocation from the national budget. \nFor  the  longer  term,  the  institutional  development  services  under  the  Project  include  a \ncomponent  to  establish  planning  and  maintenance  systems  within  the  provincial  road \nauthorities.  \n \n60. \nAvailable  funds  currently  cover  about  50%  of  road  maintenance  requirements  in  Viet \nNam. As Viet Nam maintains ADB-financed roads in accordance with the loan covenants, this \nwould  imply  that  other  parts  of  the  road  network  are  neglected.  The  problem  is  that \ninfrastructure  development  is  needed  to  enable  economic  growth  but  initial  utilization  of  the \ninfrastructure is light, which curtails the scope for financing from user charges. Funding from the \nGovernment\u2019s  general  tax  revenue  is  equally  constrained.  The  funding  problem  will  be \ntemporary and will last until economic growth increases general tax revenues and the number of \ntransport users. Based on current trends, Viet Nam is likely to reach breakeven with respect to \nroad maintenance funding in about 10 years. Thus, adequate funds should be available by the \ntime major maintenance is required for the project roads. The World Bank is undertaking a road \nmaintenance financing study to review the scope for reducing the timeframe until breakeven and \nthe  possibilities  for  supplementary  funding  until  it  is  attained.  Based  on  this  assessment,  the \nProject is considered to be sustainable. \n \nProject Implementation. To mitigate the risk of delays in starting the Project, advance \n61. \nactions for the recruitment of consultants and procurement of civil works have been approved. \nFurther, in order to allow preparations for the award of civil works contracts to be expedited, the \nGovernment  of  Viet  Nam  has  asked  for  retroactive  financing  be  applied  to  the  civil  works \npreparation  consulting  services.  To  ensure  that  sufficient  numbers  of  qualified  contractors  are \navailable  a  survey  was  undertaken  during  project  preparation  to  confirm  that  suitable \ncontractors  existed.  Procedures  developed  under  ongoing  projects  have  been  adopted  to \nensure that bidders for civil works contracts have the capacity to implement the contract. Based \non  the  experience  of  previous  projects,  appropriate  consulting  services  resources  have  been \nprovided to assist the executing and implementing agencies to implement the Project in a timely \nmanner and to ensure that quality and cost control measures are effective. Consulting services \nresources  include  specialists  to  help  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  to  manage \nresettlement,  environmental,  ethnic  minority  development  and  social  action  plans.  These \nresources  will  also  assist  in  ensuring  that  the  safeguard  policies  are  complied  with.  Other \nconcerns  are  that  the  Project  will  increase  the  potential  for  the  spread  of  HIV/AIDS  and  other \nSTIs  because  of  the  influx  of  construction  workers  and  greater  contact  with  the  rest  of  the \ncountry as a result of the road improvements. This potential risk will be mitigated or minimized \nthrough  a  program  to  increase  awareness  and  provide  preventive  measures  for  local \ncommunities, mobile populations, and construction workers. On previous projects, the provision \n\n\f18 \n\nof  counterpart  funds  and  staff  has  been  adequate  and  timely  and  provision  of  such  funds  is \nconsidered a minor risk in the Project. \n \n62. \nProject Operation. After construction, there is a risk that PPCs will not incorporate road \nmaintenance management systems into their business practices and will not provide sufficient \nadditional  funds  to  enable  regular  maintenance  of  the  roads.  To  mitigate  this  risk,  the  Project \nincludes  a  component  to  help  the  PDOTs  to  carry  out  core  road  management  activities.  The \ntechnical  assistance  will  address  the  preparation  of  provincial  road  network  plans,  and  the \nimplementation  of  provincial  road  maintenance  management  processes,  The  Government  has \ngiven  assurances  that,  by  project  completion,  (i)  the  PDOTs  will  use  the  road  maintenance \nmanagement  system  developed  as  part  of  the  institutional  development  services,  and  (ii)  that \nthe  PPCs  will  increase  road  maintenance  budget  allocations  for  provincial  road  networks  by \n100%  from  that  allocated  in  2004.  As  noted  above,  initial  maintenance  requirements  for  the \nproject  roads  will  be  modest  and  major  maintenance  should  not  be  necessary  until  about  10 \nyears after construction work has been completed. \n \n63.  With the completion of the project roads, there is a risk of an increase in the number and \nseverity of road accidents. To mitigate this, the institutional development services include pilot \nroad safety programs for three provinces to extend the national road safety strategy down to the \nprovincial level.  \n \n64. \nOther  risks  include  lower-than-expected  traffic  and  inadequate  transfer  of  savings  in \nvehicle operation costs to users of transport services. As part of the economic analysis for the \nProject,  sensitivity  analyses  were  performed  that  included  reducing  traffic  growth  forecasts  by \n2%.  These  analyses  showed  that  even  though  this  level  of  reduction  reduced  the  EIRR  for \nindividual roads below 12%, the overall Project remained robustly viable. Inadequate transfer of \nsavings  to  users  of  transport  services  is  considered  to  be  a  minor  risk  given  the  assessment \nduring  project  preparation  that  transport  services  in  the  project  area  were  competitive.  Lesser \nrisks  are  failure  of  transport  provision  and  failure  of  agricultural  development  because  of \nunrelated  constraints.  Neither  risk  is  considered  likely  to  materialize,  given  the  findings  of  the \npreparatory TA and previous project experience.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \n\n65. \nassurances included in ADB loan agreements:  \n \nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n1. \n\nSubproject Selection \n\n66. \nA  road  section  subproject  will  be  eligible  for  financing  under  the  loan  if  it:  (i)  is \neconomically,  technically,  and  environmentally  feasible  and  has  an  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn  greater  than  12%;  (ii)  has  received  all  applicable  governmental  clearances;  and  (iii) \ncomplies  with  ADB\u2019s  and  the  procedural  requirements  of  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam,  and \nADB\u2019s resettlement, ethnic minorities and environment policies.  A proposed road subproject will \nbe excluded from the Project if the road (i) connects to an international border, or (ii) will cause \nsignificant adverse environmental impacts.   \n \n\n\f19 \n\n2. \n\nRoad Sector \n\n67.  MOT  will  implement  the  provincial  road  sector  policy  action  plan  prepared  and  agreed \nupon with ADB.  A copy of the provincial policy action plan is in Appendix 3. In particular, MOT \nwill  ensure  that:  (i)  for  all  project  provinces,  the  PPCs  increase  road  maintenance  budget \nallocations for provincial road networks by 100% by project completion, using 2004 as the base \nyear for determining compliance; (ii) PDOTs in ten Provinces (i.e., Binh Thuan, Da Nang, Dak \nLak,  Dak  Nong,  Gia  Lai,  Khanh  Hoa,  Kon  Tum,  Lam  Dong,  Ninh  Thuan,  and  Quang  Nam \nProvinces)  will  utilize,  by  project  completion,  the  road  maintenance  management  system \ndeveloped  as  part  of  the  institutional  development  services;  (iii)  PDOTs  and  MOT  incorporate \nroad  safety  audit  recommendations  developed  under  the  Project  into  the  road  network \nimprovements  resulting  from  the  Project;  and  (iv)  PDOTs  adopt  an  open  competitive  bidding \nprocess  for at  least  50%  of  the  periodic  maintenance  program  in  the  Project  provinces  by  the \nend of the Project. \n \n\n3. \n\nResettlement  \n\n68.  MOT  will  be  responsible  for  the  timely  acquisition  of  the  land  required  for  each \nsubproject and for compensation and, if required, relocation, resettlement, and rehabilitation of \npeople affected by any  subproject.  MOT  will be responsible for preparing a new resettlement \nplan  for  any  subproject  requiring  one  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement  framework  agreed \nbetween ADB and the Government and will submit such resettlement plans to ADB for approval \nprior  to  implementation.  The  preparation  and  implementation  of  resettlement  plans  will  be  in \naccordance  with  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement.  MOT  will \nprovide ADB with quarterly monitoring reports on the land acquisition and resettlement process \nand will provide a report immediately following completion of Resettlement Plan implementation. \n \n69. \nADB will not approve award of any civil works contracts for any road to be financed from \nthe  loan  proceeds  unless  (i)  the  MOT  has  satisfactorily  completed  for  each  road  a  DMS  and \nvalidated compensation unit rates for all categories of losses and allowances; (ii) the MOT has \nprovided to ADB a final database of affected persons, summary of the updated DMS data, and \nreplacement  cost  tables  for  each  subproject;  and  (iii)  an  updated  resettlement  plan, \nincorporating subparagraphs (i) and (ii), has been submitted to and approved by ADB. \n \n70.  MOT will ensure that civil works contractors are not issued a notice of possession of site \nfor  construction  work  for  any  specific  section  of  a  road  unless  for  that  section  MOT  has  (a) \nsatisfactorily  completed,  in  accordance  with  the  approved  RP,  compensation  payment  and \nrelocation  to  new  sites; and  (b)  ensured  that  rehabilitation assistance is  in  place  and  the  area \nrequired for civil works is free of encumbrances. \n \n\n4. \n\nSocial Safeguards \n\n71. \nIf MOT determines that a subproject will affect any minority group or ethnic minority, then \nMOT  will  ensure  that  Ethnic  Minority  Specific  Actions  (EMSA)  are  prepared  if  the  negative \nimpacts on ethnic minorities are found to be limited.  The Government will ensure that EMDPs \nare prepared and implemented if the impacts on ethnic minorities are significant.  Preparation of \nEMSAs  and  EMDPs  will  be  in  accordance  with  the  approved  Ethnic  Minority  Development \nFramework,  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples,  and  in  coordination  with  the  Government\u2019s \nethnic minorities programs and will be subject to ADB\u2019s approval. \n \n\n\f20 \n\n5. \n\nEnvironmental Management \n\n72. \nFor  each  subproject  for  which  an  IEE  has  not  been  prepared,  the  relevant  PDOT  will \nprepare an IEE, which includes an EMP specific to that subproject.  MOT will ensure that IEEs: \n(i) are based on the sample IEEs prepared during project preparation, (ii) include details of local \nconsultation  carried  out  before  and  during  IEE  preparation,  and  (iii)  are  prepared  prior  to  civil \nworks contracts being awarded for the subproject.   \n \nThe  MOT  will  ensure  that  the  contract  documents  for  all  civil  works  under  the  Project \n73. \ninclude  specific  measures  as  indicated  in  the  SIEE  and  IEE  and  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nEnvironment Policy to mitigate negative environmental impacts caused by the construction and \nto  give  due  consideration  to  prevention  of  damage  to  the  natural  environment  in  the  design, \nconstruction, operation, and maintenance of project facilities. The Government will ensure that \nfor contaminated areas MOT conduct an unexploded ordnance survey and clearance and certify \nthat this work has been completed before commencement of civil works. \n \n\n6. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n\n74.  MOT will establish a systematic project performance monitoring and analysis system for \nuse throughout the project period.  A Road Management Information System will be established \nat each PDOT to collect the required data. \n \nB. \n\nCondition for Loan Effectiveness \n\nThe NDF Loan Agreement for approximately $11 million has been agreed, signed, and \n\n75. \nmade effective (other than a condition requiring effectiveness of the ADB Loan Agreement). \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  and  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \n\n76. \nAgreement of ADB and recommend that the Board approve:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent

Four  administrations  within  MOT\u2014Viet  Nam  Road \nAdministration (VRA), Viet Nam Railways, Viet Nam Inland Waterway Administration, and Viet \nNam  National  Maritime  Bureau\u2014are  responsible  for  roads,  railways,  inland  waterways,  and \nports, respectively. The Planning and Investment Department of MOT undertakes overall policy \ncoordination, programming, and budgeting; and sets investment priorities in the transport sector \nwith  support  from  its  Center  for  Statistics  and  a  number  of other  institutions.  At  provincial  and \ndistrict  levels,  planning  and  programming  for  transport  sector  investments  and  operations  are \nvested  with  the  provincial  departments  of  transport  (PDOT),  which  are  responsible  to  their \nrespective provincial people\u2019s committees (PPCs).  The PDOTs have no direct responsibility to \nMOT, but they have links to MOT to carry out certain works. \n \nB. \n\nProvincial Road Inventory and Condition \n\n2. \nIn  the  central  region,  the  road  network  comprises  approximately  84,500  km  with \n6,900 km  of  national  highway,  6,900  km  of  provincial  roads,  16,900  km  of  district  roads,  and \n53,800 km of commune roads. Of this network, the 19 PDOTs1 are responsible for 9,018 km of \nprovincial and district roads with 448 long bridges greater than 20 m in length and 3,736 km of \nnational highway with 351 long bridges. As a rule, the district administrations are responsible for \ndistrict  roads  but  in  a  few  provinces  the  PDOTs  are  responsible  for  some  district  roads.    The \nVRA  has  delegated  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  main  national  highway  to  its \nsubsidiary road maintenance and management units (RRMUs) and the less important national \nhighways to the PDOT.  \n \nFrom information gathered from the central region PDOT,2 61% of provincial and district \n3. \nroads under the PDOT are sealed and 39% are gravel or earth.  Pavement condition ratings for \nthese  same  roads  are:  16.9%,  good;  33.9%,  fair;  34.7%,  poor;  and  14.5%,  very  poor.  \nApproximately  one  half  of  the  total  road  length  is  therefore  in  poor  or  very  poor  condition. \nTypical  deficiencies  include:  road  foundations  and  pavement  cross-sections  do  not  meet  the \nbasic  single-lane  Class  V  standard;  poor  alignments  and  narrow  bridges  and  culverts  create \nnumerous  road  safety  hazards;  cross-drainage  is  inadequate;  and  many  bridges  need  to  be \nrepaired  or  replaced;  many  sections  of  road  are  passable  only  by  motorcycle  and  four-wheel \ndrive  vehicle;  many  roads  are  closed  for  long  periods  during  the  wet  season;  international \nroughness  index  (IRI)  on  most  roads  exceeds  10;  and  the  net  result  is  that  travel  speeds  are \nvery  low.    Many  roads  do  not  have  bus  transport  services  because  operators  are  deterred  by \nrough  road  surfaces  and  freight  transport  is  often  limited  to  cong  nongs3  or  motorcycles.  The \nPDOTs  have  identified  about  4,200  km  of  provincial  and  district  roads  which  need  to  be \nupgraded  to  a  minimum  single-  or  two-lane  standard,  providing  bituminous  surfaces  and \nrepairing or replacing damaged or missing short bridges and culverts.   \n \n\n                                                 \n1 Da Nang\u2019s road network contains extensive lengths of streets in Da Nang City which are not representative of the \n\nprovincial roads in the central region. \n\n2  Information presented in this Appendix was obtained from questionnaires sent to 19 PDOTs.  All PDOTs responded \n\nbut did not necessarily provide information for every question. \n\n3  A small domestically manufactured simple truck which is used in rural areas. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n25 \n\nC. \n\nRoad Traffic \n\n4. \nThe  provincial  roads  generally  carry  lower  levels  of  traffic  than  national  highways, \nalthough  there  are  some  heavily  used  sections  near  provincial  and  district  centers.    Traffic \ncounts on a sample of 28 roads show average daily traffic levels in the order of: less than 300 \nmotor  vehicles  (mostly  trucks  and  cong  nongs  with  a  few  buses  and  cars);  500\u20131,500 \nmotorcycles;  and  500\u20132,000  bicycles.  Motorcycles  and  bicycles  are  a  major  means  of \ntransporting goods in rural areas. \n \nD. \n\nVehicle Registrations \n\nThere  were  approximately  1,292,600  vehicle  registrations  in  17  provinces4  in  2003 \n5. \n(Table  A1.1).    The  number  of  vehicles,  especially  motorcycles,  increased  sharply  in  2002  and \nagain in 2003, albeit at a lower rate. There is every indication that the number of vehicles will \ncontinue to increase as people change from bicycles to motorcycles and more cars, buses and \ntrucks are introduced.  \n \n\nTable A1.1:  Vehicle Registrations in 17 Provinces (2003) \n\nVehicle Class \n\nMotorcycle \n\nCar, jeep, 4WD \nBus \nTruck \nCong nong, tractor \n\nTotal \n\nRegistrations \n2003 \n\n1,228,000 \n\n18,300 \n10,200 \n28,300 \n7,800 \n\n1,292,600 \n\nGrowth Rate \n2001\u20132002 \n(%) \n\nGrowth Rate \n2002\u20132003 \n(%) \n\n31 \n\n \n15 \n \n\n30 \n\n13 \n\n \n11 \n \n\n13 \n\n4WD = four-wheel drive. \nSource: Viet Nam Road Administration, Ministry of Transport, and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE. \n\nRoad Safety \n\nPoor road safety is a serious and growing problem throughout Viet Nam: 16 provinces in \n6. \nthe central region reported 3,065 road deaths in 2003, which is equivalent to a rate of 17 deaths \nper annum per 100,000 population or 24 deaths per annum per 10,000 vehicles. In Table A1.2 \nthe data for road deaths is shown by location and mode of transport. These rates are very high, \neven  in  comparison  with  many  neighboring  countries  in  Southeast  Asia,  and  new  initiatives  in \nroad  policy  and  management  are  urgently  required.  Most  road  deaths  (60%)  occurred  on \nnational  highways  but  the  number  of  accidents  and  deaths  on  provincial  roads  is  expected  to \nincrease  as  well.  Road  safety  audits  on  a  sample  of  provincial  roads  revealed  that  there  are \nmany road hazards which should be eliminated as a part of the road improvements made by the \nProject.  The number of reported deaths increased by 19% in 2001\u20132002 and declined by 6% in \n2002\u20132003. \n \nF. \n\nProvincial Road Sector Organization \n\n7. \nThe management of roads in each province is the responsibility of a board of directors or \nmanagement  board  appointed  by  the  PPC.  The  organizational  structure  of  a  typical  provincial \nroad sector organization comprises: \n\n                                                 \n4 Data for Quang Binh and Thua Thien Hue Provinces are not available. \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\nPDOT - administration division, planning division, transport management division, \ntraffic inspection division, technical audit unit, vehicle and driver registration unit, \nand provincial project management unit (PPMU); \nroad and bridge maintenance management companies for maintenance works; \nroad and bridge construction companies for construction works; \nroad consulting companies for surveys and design; \npassenger transport companies; and \nfreight transport companies. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n \n\nTable A1.2:  Distribution of Road Accidents \n \n\nLocation                     Percent \nNational highway \nProvincial road \nDistrict road \nCommune road \n\n60 \n22 \n13 \n5 \n\nType of Transport      Percent \nPedestrian \nBicycle, motorcycle \nMotor vehicle \n\n4 \n63 \n33 \n\n  Source: Viet Nam Road Administration, Ministry of Transport, and Asian Development   \n  Bank estimates. \n\n \nG. \n\nRoad Budgets \n\n8. \nThe  PDOTs  receive  budget  allocations  from  the  PPCs  for  the  development  and \nmaintenance  of  provincial  and  district  roads  under  their  jurisdiction  and  from  the  MOT  for  the \nnational highways they operate and maintain on behalf of the VRA. Budget allocations for 2004 \nfor 16 provinces are summarized in the table below. \n \n\nTable A1.3: 2004 Provincial Budget Allocations for Roads \n\n \nCategory \nAdministration, routine and \nperiodic maintenance \nRehabilitation and \nimprovement \n\nProvincial Roads           Percent \n$5.9 million \n$700/km \n$23.2 million \n$4,343/km \n\n11 \n\n44 \n\n45 \n\nNational Highways under PDOT    Percent \n\n$5.7 million \n$1,970/km \n$13.0 million \n$6,273/km \n\n$60.6 million \n\n7 \n\n16 \n\n77 \n\nNew construction \n\n$23.5 million \n\n \n\n \n\n$82.3 million \n2,880 km \n\n$52.6 million \n8,390 km \n\nTotal budget \nTotal road length \nkm = kilometer, PDOT = Provincial Departments of Transport. \nSource: Viet Nam Road Administration, Ministry of Transport, and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n9. \nThe  information  received  from  the  PDOTs  shows  the  amount  allocated  for  routine  and \nperiodic  maintenance  of  provincial  roads  is  $700/km.  Other  PDOT  sources  reported  that  the \nactual  expenditure  per  km  is  approximately  50\u201360%  of  this  amount,  and  is  only  50%  of  the \namount  required.  By  international  standards  this  level  of  expenditure  is  too  low  to  maintain \nroads  at  a  reasonable  standard,  which  is  borne  out  by  the  findings  of  the  road  and  bridge \ninspections carried out under the PPTA.5 \n   \n10. \nThe total allocation of $52.6 million to provincial roads is a  significant proportion of the \ntotal  allocation  to  the  PDOTs.

(TA4034-VIE) \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\n \n\n \n\nover 4 years is almost double the current annual PDOT budgets for provincial road rehabilitation \nand improvements.  The increasing expenditure on road improvements, in combination with the \nunderfunding of road maintenance, underlines the need to introduce an effective provincial road \nand  bridge  asset  management  capacity  at  the  PDOT  level  complementing  the  efforts  being \nexpended on national highways.   \n \nH. \n\nRoad Construction Industry \n\n11.  Most road and bridge maintenance companies are fully state-owned enterprises (SOEs) \nwhich  are  contracted  for  maintenance  planning  and  execution  by  the  PDOT.  The  capacity  of \nthese  SOEs  varies.  Some  are  limited  to  small-scale  works  while  others  are  capable  of \nundertaking large complex projects. The PPCs  are now converting many of their construction, \nconsulting, and transport SOEs into joint stock companies (JSCs) with different degrees of state \nshareholdings.  The  construction  industry  possesses  the  plant,  engineering,  and  materials \nresources  needed  to  meet  the  road  construction  and  maintenance  requirements  in  the  central \nregion. There are approximately 400 construction companies operating in the 19 central region \nprovinces.  About  40%  are  small  private  companies  with  an  annual  turnover  of  less  than \n$500,000. Although small, these private companies can grow if they have access to a pipeline \nof  work,  as  has  been  demonstrated  in  other  provincial  road  projects  in  Viet  Nam.  The  table \nbelow  shows  the  breakdown  by  type  of  ownership  and  the  reported  annual  value  of  work \ncompleted.   \n \n\nTable A1.4: Distribution of Annual Value of Work by Ownership. \n\n \nOwnership \n\n \n\n \n\nState-Owned Enterprise \nJoint Stock Company \nPrivate Company \nSubtotal \n\n \n<$500 \n15 \n5 \n164 \n184 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nI. \n\n   Annual Value of Work Completed in Past One Year ($'000)  \n\n \n$500-1,000 \n9 \n18 \n59 \n86 \n\n \n$1,000-6,000 \n42 \n32 \n37 \n111 \n\n \n>$6,000 \n13 \n3 \n1 \n17 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nTotal \n79 \n58 \n261 \n398 \n\nInstitutional Capacity and Strengthening Requirements \n\n12. \nA  review  of  existing  donor-funded  road  projects  show  there  is  a  large  amount  of \ntechnical  assistance  being  provided  to  strengthen  road  sector  agencies  at  national,  provincial, \ndistrict, and commune levels. The donor community has realized that there are overlaps and a \nneed  for  close  coordination  among  the  project  executing  agencies  to  avoid  conflicts  and \nduplication.  Nevertheless,  it  appears  that  none  of  the  current  institutional  strengthening \nprograms  is  focusing  on  the  PDOT\u2019s  management  of  provincial  roads.  Workshops  and \ninvestigations carried out during the PPTA (footnote 5) showed there is a need within the PDOT \nto ensure that \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\neffective  road  network  planning  processes  are  in  place  covering  national, \nprovincial, district, and commune roads in each province; \neffective  maintenance  management  systems  and  processes  covering  provincial \nroads are in place; \nstaff are trained and capable of operating and sustaining these systems; \nroad safety programs are introduced at the provincial level; and \nsufficient budget support is given by the PPCs to maintain the provincial roads. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nPolicy Objective \n1. Ensure that responsibility \nfor every road is assigned to \na road authority, and that \nroad authorities at the \nnational, provincial, district, \nand commune levels have \nthe required resources to \noperate and maintain the \nroads under their \njurisdiction. \n2.  Develop the road network \nto promote economic growth \nand reduce poverty by \nimproving road access in \nrural areas. \n\n3.  Increase the allocation of \nfunds to meet the \nmaintenance requirements \nof the road network. \n\n4.  Assure a flow of funds for \nlong-term routine and \nperiodic maintenance of the \nroad network. \n\nROAD SUBSECTOR AND PROVINCIAL ROADS POLICY ACTION PLANS \n\nTable A3.1: National Road Sector Policy Matrix \n \n\nKey Issues and Actions Taken \n\nThe Road Traffic Act, passed in June 2001, and Decree 167/1999/ND-\nCP  on Road Management Organization define (1) the general \nresponsibilities of the MOT, VRA, and Peoples\u2019 Committees at all \nlevels, (2) the road classification system, and (3) the road authority for \neach class of road. This Decree has been fully implemented. \nVRA has delegated management of \u2018secondary\u2019 national highways to \nthe provincial departments of transport (PDOT) and provides budget \nallocations for their maintenance and improvement. \n\nFuture Actions \n\nWith the improvements to the road network and the \nrapid increase in road traffic, there is a need to review \nand update the administrative classification and \nresponsibility for roads assigned to the VRA, PDOTs \nand districts. Reclassification will entail changes in \nbudget allocations and resources for road operations \nand maintenance by the different road authorities.   \n\nRapid growth in the number of motor vehicles and traffic volumes has \naccompanied economic development. Despite extensive investment in \nthe past 10 years, the capacity and condition of much of the road \nnetwork is inadequate.   \n\nADB, DFID (Department for International Development), JBIC (Japan \nBank for International Cooperation), and World Bank have provided \nfunding for road investment projects at all levels in the road network \nincluding new bridges.   \nThe Government is funding several major links in the road network both \nwith its own funds and private sector participation. \nRoad maintenance programs and funding have not kept pace with \ninvestment in road network improvements resulting in a backlog of \nmaintenance requirements and the deterioration of road assets.  \nStudies show maintenance budget allocations need to be increased by \nat least 60% (to at least 25% of the road budget). \nAt present, road tolls, fuel taxes, and other road-related charges are \nallocated to repay loan obligations or to go into general revenues. The \nGovernment has not supported the establishment of a road fund. \n\nFurther investment in the road network at all levels is \nrequired either to rehabilitate and increase the capacity \nof existing roads or to add new links in the network, \nincluding expressways and bypasses. \nMajor donors are funding new projects for rehabilitation \nand improvement of roads work not covered in earlier \nprojects. Major new projects include the ADB Provincial \nRoad Improvement Projecta in the northern region, \nJBIC\u2019s Weak Bridges Program, and  World Bank\u2019s Road \nNetwork Improvement Project (RNIP) \n\nVRA has prepared a 10-Year strategic maintenance \nplan which MOF has agreed to fund when approved by \nthe Government. World Bank RNIP will fund repairs on \n1,100 km of national highways as part of the VRA 10-\nyear Plan. \nMOF has agreed to fund the VRA 10-year maintenance \nplan subject to government approval. World Bank\u2019s \nRNIP will assist VRA to improve road maintenance \nfunding and management, and cost recovery. \n\n2\n8\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n3\n\ni\n\n \n\n\f \n\nPolicy Objective \n5.  Build institutional \ncapacity for road \nmaintenance management. \n\nKey Issues and Actions Taken \n\nFuture Actions \n\nVRA has received technical assistance under several donor projects. It \nhas adopted computerized systems for road and bridge maintenance \nmanagement but has not yet implemented them in all parts of the \nnational road network. \nVRA has also developed simplified computerized systems for \nmaintenance of rural roads (district and commune roads) and \ndistributed them to the PDOT. \n\n \n\nThe Implementation of Sector Development Policy \n(ISDP) component of ADB\u2019s Third Road Improvement \nProjectb will help the VRA to implement road \nmaintenance management procedure based on HDM-4, \nROSY, and BridgeMan computer systems. A uniform \nroad information management system (RIMS) will be \ncreated covering all national highways. 40 PDOTs \nwhich operate and maintain national highways for MOT \nand VRA will be included in ISDP. A consultant has \nbeen appointed and work will begin in June 2004 \nThe road sector management and institutional building \ncomponent of World Bank\u2019s RNIP will provide  technical \nassistance to VRA for further strengthening of road \nplanning, maintenance and financing. \n\nUnder Decree 63/2003/QD-TTG of 21 May 2003, the \nGovernment has set guidelines and specific targets for \nMOT to convert its SOEs to joint stock companies. \n\nWorld Bank will fund a Road Safety Project to support \nthe NTSC and develop a multisector program involving: \ndemonstration programs in three \u2018high risk\u2019 national \nhighway corridors, accident monitoring and analysis, \nroad safety audits, accident blackspots, improved driver \ntraining, licensing and vehicle testing, education of the \npublic and in schools, emergency services. \n\n6.  Improve the efficiency of \nroad maintenance delivery. \n\n7.  Increase road safety on \nall classes of road \n\nVRA and MOT have a large number of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) \nwhich are employed by VRA for road design, construction, and \nmaintenance. The Government intends most SOEs to be converted to \njoint stock companies (JSCs) with substantial or majority private sector \nownership. \n\nThe capacity of existing private companies is limited and the private \nsector is generally restricted to small construction projects. \n\nRoad accidents, serious injuries and fatalities have increased \nsignificantly and now have a major impact on economic and social \ndevelopment. The situation will worsen as more roads are improved, \nallowing higher speeds, and traffic volumes increase on all classes of \nroads.  \n\nThe Government has established a National Traffic Safety Committee \n(NTSC) and developed a road safety action plan which will be \nimplemented in stages and will involve many agencies.  \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, DFID = Department for International Development, JBIC = Japan Bank for International Cooperation, JSC = joint stock company, \nISDP = Implementation of Sector Development Plan, MOF = Ministry of Finance, MOT = Ministry of Transport, NTSC = National Traffic Safety Committee, PDOT = \nProvincial Department of Transport, PPC = Provincial Peoples\u2019 Committee, RMIS = Road Management Information Systems, RNIP = Road Network Improvement \nProject, RRMU = road maintenance management units, SOE = state owned enterprise, VRA = Viet Nam Road Administration. \na   ADB. 2001.

Develop the provincial \nroad networks in the central \nregion to promote economic \ngrowth and reduce poverty \nby improving road access in \nrural areas.  \n\n2.  Increase the allocation of \nfunds to meet the \nmaintenance requirements \nof the provincial road \nnetworks.  \n\n \n\nTable A3.2: Provincial Road Sector Policy Action Plan \n \n\nRoad transport costs in rural areas in the \ncentral region are high because of the \nbad condition of the roads, many of which \nare impassable in the wet season. \nAccess to employment, health, and \neducation centers is limited, especially for \npoor households. \n\nRoad and bridge improvement projects \nfunded by the Government, ADB,  DFID \n(Department for International \nDevelopment), JBIC (Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation), and World \nBank have improved many provincial and \nrural roads and bridges but it is estimated \nthat a further $260 million is required for \nimprovement of provincial road networks \nand bridges in the central region.    \n\nThe Central Region Transport Networks \nImprovement Sector Project (CRTNP) will \nimprove about 1,200 km of provincial \nroad networks, thereby reducing transport \ncosts and improving connectivity between \ncommune, district, and provincial centers. \n\nIn parallel with CRTNP, World Bank, and \nDFID Second and Third Rural Transport \nProjects (RT2/3) will improve district and \ncommune roads in most central region \nprovinces.  \n\nProvincial Departments of Transport \n(PDOTs) will prepare/update their road \nnetwork master plans to show existing \nprogrammed road improvements and  \nprioritized lists of additional road \nimprovement requirements. \n\nPDOTs receive funding from Ministry of \nTransport (MOT) for maintenance of \nnational highways delegated to them by \nVRA and from the PPCs for maintenance \nand improvement of provincial roads, and \ndistrict roads assigned to them.  The \nbudget allocations for routine and \nperiodic maintenance of provincial roads \nare grossly inadequate, resulting in a \ndeterioration of road and bridge assets.  \n\nCRTNP will assist the PDOTs to \nimplement road and bridge maintenance \nmanagement systems to identify \nrequirements and prepare multiyear \nroutine and periodic maintenance \nprograms. Analysis of current operations \nindicates that routine and periodic \nmaintenance budget allocations for \nprovincial roads need to be increased by \n100% from 2004 levels. \n\nRoad network subprojects included in \nCRTNP will be selected from the \nprioritized lists identified by the road \nnetwork master plans.    \n\n3\n0\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n3\n\ni\n\nPPCs will increase maintenance budget \nallocations for provincial road networks by \n100% by project completion.

Ensure an adequate flow \nof funds for long-term \nroutine and periodic \nmaintenance of the \nprovincial road networks.  \n\nRoad tolls, fuel taxes, and other road-\nrelated charges are allocated to repay \nloan obligations or go into general \nrevenues. Government has not supported \nthe establishment of a road fund. \n\n4.  Build institutional \ncapacity for road \nmaintenance management \nin the PDOTs. \n\nPDOT procedures for inventory, condition \nmeasurement, planning, prioritizing, and \nprogramming and implementing routine \nand periodic maintenance are weak.  \n\n5.  Improve the efficiency of \nroad maintenance delivery \nby the PDOT. \n\nVRA has provided limited assistance in \nthe form of computer systems but in most \ncases these have not been incorporated \ninto the PDOTs\u2019 normal business \npractices.  \n\nPDOTs and the road maintenance \ncompanies have large organizations and \nstaffing levels relative to the length of \nroads they manage. Major increases in \nproductivity are likely to result from (1) \nconverting state-owned enterprises \n(SOEs) into joint stock companies (JSCs) \nor private companies and (2) contracting \nfor maintenance works through open \ncompetitive bidding. \n\nMOT and PPCs will prepare annual \nreports showing maintenance budget \nallocations and expenditures. \n\nWorld Bank and DFID RT2/3 Projects will \ndevelop and introduce the Provincial \nRoad Maintenance Handbook.   \n\nPDOT in all provinces included in CRTNP \nwill formally agree to incorporate the \nhandbook procedures in their provincial \nroad maintenance planning and \nmanagement business processes.  \n\nPDOTs in 10 provinces will incorporate \nthe road maintenance management \nsystem in their business processes by \nproject completion.  \n\nPDOT will adopt open competitive bidding \nfor 50% of periodic maintenance program \nby project completion. \n\nMOT and MOF have agreed to increase \nbudget allocations to PPCs to provide for \nan increase of 20% per year in road \nmaintenance expenditures during the \nproject.  PPCs have agreed to apply the \nincreased budget allocation to provincial \nroad maintenance only. \n\nWorld Bank and DFID RT2/3 Projects are \nproviding technical assistance to \ncommunes, districts and PDOT in rural \nroad planning and maintenance. A \nprovincial road maintenance handbook is \nbeing developed. RT3 will provide \ntechnical assistance in nine Central \nRegion provinces. CRTNP will provide \ntechnical assistance to implement the \nplanning and maintenance systems \ndeveloped by RT2/3 for provincial roads \nin the 10 remaining central region \nprovinces. \n\nThe Government has adopted a policy of \nconverting and divesting itself of SOEs. \nDecree 63/2003/QD-TTG sets guidelines \nand targets for MOT.  PPCs have also \nbegun coverting their SOEs into JSCs. \n\nOther donor projects will help VRA to \ncontract out maintenance works.

The situation will \nworsen as provincial roads are improved, \nallowing higher speeds, and traffic \nvolumes increase.  \n\nThe Government has established a \nNational Traffic Safety Committee \n(NTSC) and developed a road safety \naction plan which will be implemented in \nstages and involve many agencies. As \npart of the action plan most PPCs have \nalready established provincial traffic \nsafety committees (PTSCs). \n\n \n\nNTSC and PTSCs will adopt the program \ndeveloped by the Road Safety Project. \n\nPPCs in central region will agree to \nprovide budget allocations for \ncomponents requiring PDOTs and other \nprovincial department inputs. \n\nComprehensive road safety programs will \nbe established and implemented in three \npilot provinces following the models \ndeveloped by the Road Safety Project. \n\nPDOT and MOT agree to incorporate \nroad safety audit recommendations in the \nscope of the road network improvements \nfunded by the Project. \n\nWorld Bank will fund a Road Safety \nProject to support the NTSC and develop \na multisector program involving: \ndemonstration programs in three \u2018high \nrisk\u2019 national highway corridors, accident \nmonitoring and analysis, road safety \naudits, accident blackspots, improved \ndriver training, licensing and vehicle \ntesting, public and school education, and \nimproved emergency services. \n\nCRTNP will provide technical assistance \nin three pilot provinces to transfer and \nimplement programs developed by the \nRoad Safety Project to the provincial road \nnetwork as a first step in implementing \nthe Road Safety Action Plan in all central \nregion provinces. \n\n \n\nCRTNP will carry out safety audits on all \nroads included in the Project and \nincorporate safety improvements in the \ndetailed engineering designs. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, CRTNP  = Central Region Transport Networks Improvement Sector Project, DFID = Department for International Development \n(UK),  JBIC  =  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation,  JSC  =  joint  stock  company,  MOT  =  Ministry  of  Transport,  NTSC  =  National  Traffic  Safety  Committee, \nPDOT = Provincial Department of Transport, PPC = Provincial Peoples\u2019 Committee, PTSC = provincial traffic safety committee, RT2 = Second Rural Transport \nProjects (RT2/3), RT3 = Third Rural Transport Project, SOE = state owned enterprise, VRA = Viet Nam Road Administration. \nSource: Viet Nam Road Administration, Ministry of Transport, and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n\f \n\nProject \n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n33 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ROAD SUBSECTOR \n\nImplementation \nSchedule \n\nProject Cost \n($ million) \n\nExternal Funding \nSource(s) \n\nA.

Work will take place in three phases.  Phases 1 and 2 will \nbe  improvements  to  544  km  of  provincial  and  district  roads  in  nine  provinces.  Networks  for \nPhase 3 will be identified in due course. Generally, the project roads are narrow and have bad \nor poor unpaved surfaces. Some roads are impassable for three to four months during the wet \nseason. Most of the roads are low-volume carrying no more than 100\u2013200 motor vehicles per \nday, although in others the levels of motorcycle and bicycle traffic can be high.  The proposed \nimprovements will take the form of widening and/or raising the road foundation and providing a \nsealed single-lane or two-lane carriageway.  Most improvements will be constructed along the \nexisting road alignment and within the right-of-way. A road safety audit conducted on selected \nroads  revealed  that  some  road  sections  are  unsafe  and  need  to  be  realigned.  Therefore,  the \nproposed improvements include short diversions to eliminate dangerous alignments, some short \nbypasses  around  densely  developed  villages  and  improvements  at  intersections  with  major \nroads. \n \nB. \n\nDesign Standards for Project Roads \n\n2. \nThe  highway  design  criteria  adopted  are  in  accordance  with  the  Viet  Nam  publication \nTCVN  4054:  1998  Highway  Specifications  for  Design.1  These  standards  are  consistent  with \nstandard  international  practices  adopted  by  the  American  Association  of  State  Highway  and \nTransportation  Officials  (AASHTO)  design  standards.  The  road  design  will  be  based  on \nVietnamese  methods  and  checked  against  the  design  methods  given  in  AASHTO  Guide  for \nDesign of Pavement Structures2 and Transport Research Laboratory Overseas Road Note 31.3  \n \nThe choice of surfacing takes into account such factors as traffic, soil type, and rainfall. It \n3. \nis  envisaged  that  double  bituminous  surface  treatment  (DBST)  will  be  adequate  for  all  the \ndistrict  roads  and  the  low-volume  provincial  roads  included  in  Phases  1  and  2.  Some  higher-\nvolume roads will require asphaltic concrete (AC) pavement. For the low-volume roads, DBST \nwill  be  the  most  economical  solution,  since  the  bitumen  content  and  cost  is  low  and  the  thin, \nflexible surface will resist damage from any overweight vehicles.  For medium-volume roads and \nintersections  with  major  roads,  full-depth  bituminous  surfacing  is  likely  to  be  the  most \neconomical solution. Cement concrete roads are unlikely to be economical except in locations \nwhere  occasional  flooding  may  occur.  In  these  locations,  it  is  recommended  that  light \nreinforcement is used in the concrete to distribute loads and to eliminate cracking.   \n \n4. \n  There is insufficient detailed traffic and geotechnical information available at the PPTA \n(footnote  1  in  the  main  text)  stage  to  choose  the  most  economic  pavement  option  for  each \nsubproject road. The most practical course of action is to evaluate pavement design options at \nthe  detailed  design  stage  using  reliable  data  on  traffic,  axle  loads,  pavement  strength, \nconstruction materials, and updated unit costs.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1   Ministry of Transport. 1998.

Transport Research Laboratory.  \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n35 \n\n \n\nC. \n \n5. \n \n\nGeneral Design Considerations \n\nThe major improvements to the project roads are as follows. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n(vii) \n\nRaise the embankment a minimum of 0.5 m above natural ground level or 0.6 m \nabove highest flood level to meet hydraulic requirements. \nClass V Roads: widen the existing roadway to 3.5 m with 1.5 m shoulders. The \nshoulders would normally be gravel in rural areas and paved in urban areas and \noutside  schools  and  hospitals  etc.    A  capping  layer  would  be  provided  where \nrequired with a granular base and subbase, overlaid with bitumen.  \nClass IV Roads: widen the existing roadway to 5.5 m with 1.5 m shoulders. The \nshoulders would normally be gravel in rural areas and paved in urban areas and \noutside  schools  and  hospitals,  etc.    A  capping  layer  would  be  provided  where \nrequired with a granular base and subbase, overlaid with bitumen.  \nClass  V  Roads:  improve  horizontal  and  vertical  alignment  to  allow  a  minimum \ndesign speed of 40 km/h on level terrain and 20 km/h in mountainous terrain. \nClass  IV  Roads:  improve  horizontal  and  vertical  alignment  to  allow  a  minimum \ndesign speed of 60 km/h on level terrain and 40 km/h in mountainous terrain. \nProvide guard barriers at bridge approaches and on high embankments.  \nProvide road furniture including signs, delineator posts, kilometer posts, etc. and \nadditional signs where there is high pedestrian activity.  \n\n(viii)  Provide pedestrian crossings and speed controls at key locations outside schools \n\nand hospitals and in other areas where there are high pedestrian movements. \n\n \nD. \n\nBridges and Culverts \n\n6. \nMost bridges on project roads under Phases 1 and 2 are in good condition or need only \nminor repairs. In several cases, bridges will be replaced because their width is substandard for \nthe level of road improvement proposed. There are three bridges longer than 20 m in Phases 1 \nand 2. Two of these will be repaired and one bridge (32 m) will be replaced. \n \n7. \nProper  cross-drainage  structures  will  be  provided  where  necessary,  to  ensure  all-\nweather  connectivity  and  to  prevent  environmental  erosion,  flooding,  or  other  damage.  Box, \nslab, or circular culverts will be provided at suitable intervals and at suitable sizes determined by \nhydrological and hydraulic calculations. \n \nF. \n\nUnexploded Ordnance Clearance \n\n8. \nA study of unexploded ordnance clearance requirements for Phases 1 and 2 subproject \nroads  was  conducted  by  domestic  specialists  associated  with  the  Headquarters  of  Army \nEngineering and licensed by the Ministry of Defense. The study found subproject roads fell into \nfour zone classifications (KV1 to KV4) with all roads in Quang Tri province classified as KV4, the \nhighest risk classification. The study recommended that all Phases 1 and 2 subproject roads will \nrequire surveying and clearance at an estimated cost of $950,000.  \n  \nG. \n\nEnvironmental Management Plan \n\n9. \nThe  project  initial  environmental  examination  has  recommended  a  series  of  mitigation \nmeasures  that  take  the  form  of  good  engineering  practices.  These  will  be  included  in  the \ncontract  technical  specification.  Otherwise,  there  are  no  special  environmental  mitigation \nmeasures that need to be incorporated into the designs of the subproject roads. \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nSUBPROJECT SELECTION AND PROCESSING ARRANGEMENTS \n\n \nProvincial Road Network Master Plans \n\nA. \n\nThe definition and selection of subproject road networks for inclusion in the Project will \n1. \nbe  based  on  the  long  lists  of  proposed  subprojects  (road  sections)  prepared  by  the  provincial \ndepartments of transport (PDOTs). The provinces have already prepared long lists of proposed \nroad  and  bridge  subprojects  during  the  PPTA  (footnote  1  of  main  text).  A  workshop  was  held \nwith representatives of the PDOTs to review each province\u2019s requirements and agree upon the \nlong  lists.  The  provinces\u2019  needs  are  expected  to  change  over  the  duration  of  the  Project. \nTherefore, the PDOT will be requested to update their provincial road network master plans and \nroad  improvement  programs  to  ensure  their  long  lists  are  consistent  with  provincial  economic \nand social development plans.  \n \n2. \nThe total long list of road improvements and new or replacement bridges required in the \nprovincial  road  networks  in  the  central  region  is estimated  to  be  $260  million  ($200 million  for \nroads and $60 million for bridges), of which the Project will select approximately 45%.  \n \nB. \n\nSelection of Subproject Networks from Provincial Long Lists \n\nThe  long  lists  will  be  scrutinized  by  MOT  with  the  assistance  of  the  project \n3. \nimplementation consultant for completeness and consistency, and to identify suitable networks. \nIn  each  province  the  updated  long  list  of  networks  will  be  prioritized  using  a  multicriteria \nmethodology to assess the individual network\u2019s potential for generating economic benefits, and \nfor  achieving  the  social  objectives  of  the  project  following  the  methodology  set  out  in  the \nsubproject selection and preparation manual prepared under the PPTA (footnote 1 in the main \ntext).  The  criteria  adopted  to  form  the  basis  for  selection  of  subproject  networks  were \n(i) population  served,  (ii) the  incidence  of  poverty  in  the  area  of  influence,  (iii) traffic  intensity, \n(iv) the  general  surface  condition  of  the  existing  roads,  and  (v)  the  number  of  days  of  road \nclosure per year. No network will include any road links that connect to an international border. \n \n4. \nThe  networks  selected  for  inclusion  in  the  Project  will  be  checked  in  the  field  by  MOT \nand  the  project  implementation  consultant  to  confirm  the  results  of  the  selection  methodology \nand the overall suitability of the subproject.  \n \n5. \nIn  addition, the  selection  process  will  consider other  road  sector  projects  in  the  central \nregion,  including  the  Government\u2019s  development  plans  for  national  highways,  to  maximize  the \nbenefits of the Project. In addition, the JBIC Weak Bridge Project, which includes replacement \nlong bridges in the provincial road networks, will be reviewed during the selection process. \n \nC. \n\nEconomic Analysis of Improvement Options \n\n6. \nField surveys will be conducted to collect road and bridge inventory and condition data, \ntraffic counts, preliminary environmental screening data, and social surveys. These data will be \nused  to  identify  improvement  options  and  the  proposed  subproject  network  will  then  be \nsubjected to a detailed economic evaluation. The evaluation will be based on the results of field \nsurveys and classified traffic counts that produced an inventory for each project road and traffic \ndata  for  analysis  by  the  HDM-4  model.1  This  analysis  will  make  use  of  calibration  factors  for \n\n                                                 \n1  The  Highway  Development  and  Management  tool  version  4  (HDM-4)  is  the  acknowledged  reference  model  for \n\neconomic assessment of road projects. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n37 \n\nHDM-4 derived to reflect local conditions, in particular vehicle speeds and the effects of the very \nhigh proportions of motorcycles in total traffic flow. \n \n7. \nThe economic evaluation will be made by comparing the \u201cwith\u201d and the \u201cwithout\u201d project \ncases. The cost-benefit analysis will be performed on a network basis (rather than on the basis \nof individual road sections) to ensure that the Project produces coherent networks that connect \nto  major  roads,  thus  ensuring  that  the  project  area  receives  effective  all-year  connectivity  to \nmarkets and services. \n \n8. \nThe evaluation of the project networks will allow for a 2-year construction period starting \nin 2006, or later for subsequent phases, followed by a benefit period of 20 years. The results of \nthe  selection  process  and  economic  analysis  will  be  submitted  to  MOT  and  ADB  for  approval \nbefore the start of detailed design and preparation of bid documents. \n \nD. \n\nDetailed Design and Contract Packages \n\nFollowing approval by  MOT and ADB, the engineering investigations will be conducted \n9. \nand detailed designs (drawings and specifications), bid documents, and cost estimates will be \nprepared and submitted to the PDOTs (who will be responsible for the day-to-day supervision of \ncivil  works  and  will  be  the  road  authority  upon  completion  of  the  civil  works)  and  MOT  for \napproval.  The works will be grouped into practical contract packages not exceeding $2 million \nfor  local  competitive  bidding.  All  necessary  documents  will  be  then  submitted  to  ADB  for \napproval. \n \nE. \n\nInitial Environmental Examination (IEE) \n\n10. \nBefore any  candidate subproject is selected and an IEE conducted, it will be screened \nusing a list of environmental selection criteria. These criteria have been prepared in the sample \nsubproject  IEE  prepared  by  the  PPTA  and  have  been  agreed  upon  by  both  ADB  and  Project \nManagement Unit No 1 (PMU-1). Subprojects categorized as Category A will be screened out. \nThe  selected  candidate  subprojects  will  be  assessed  and  reviewed  by  MOT  and,  for  each \nselected  subproject,  an  IEE  (including  site-specific  EMP)  will  be  carried  out  and  submitted  to \nADB  for  approval.  At  the  same  time,  the  approval  procedure  of  the  Ministry  of  Natural \nResources  and  the  Environment  (MONRE)  and  related  safeguard  requirements  of  the \nGovernment will be followed. \n \nF. \n\nResettlement \n\n11. \nResettlement  plans  will  be  prepared  following  detailed  designs  where  the  subproject \nrequires  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  Designs  will  take  account  of  productive  land  uses \nand the location of houses. Where relevant they will realign and adjust the pavement width and \nalignment and associated works, and incorporate the drainage into the road shoulder to reduce \nthe  need  for  major  land  acquisition,  physical  displacement  of  houses,  structures,  and  other \nimprovements. \n \nPreparation  of  resettlement  plans  will  be  based  on  (i)  resettlement  screening; \n12. \n(ii) consultation  and  participation  programs,  (iii)  census, \nlosses,  detailed \nmeasurement,  and  socioeconomic  surveys;  (iv) replacement  cost  study  and  establishment  of \ncompensation rates; (v) formulation of appropriate rehabilitation measures for severely affected, \nimplementation \nvery  poor  and  other  vulnerable  groups;  (vi)  preparation  of  budget, \n\ninventory  of \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\narrangements,  monitoring,  and  implementation  schedule  in  coordination  with  the  civil  works \nschedule.  \n \n13. \nResettlement plans will be prepared in accordance with the ADB's Policy on Involuntary \nResettlement  (1995)  and  the  approved  resettlement  policy  framework.  To  ensure  that \nresettlement  planning  is  completed  in  a  timely  manner,  it  will  be  a  condition  for  the  award  of \ncontract  that  for  each  road  the  Government  has  (i)  satisfactorily  completed  a  detailed \nmeasurement  survey  and  validated  compensation  unit  rates  for  all  categories  of  losses  and \nallowances; (ii) provided to ADB a final database of affected persons, summary of the updated \ndetailed  measurement  survey  data,  and  replacement  cost  tables  for  each  road;  and  (iii) \nsubmitted  an  updated  resettlement  plan,  incorporating  the  above,  and  that  this  has  been \napproved  by  ADB.  To  ensure  that  implementation  of  each  resettlement  plan  is  effected  in  a \ntimely manner, it will be a condition that the Government will not issue notices of possession of \nsite  for  any  section  of  a  road  to  begin  construction  work  until  the  Government  has  (i) \nsatisfactorily  completed,  in  accordance  with  the  approved  resettlement  plan,  compensation \npayment  and  relocation  to  new  sites;  and  (ii) ensured  that  rehabilitation  assistance  is  in  place \nand the area required for civil works is free of encumbrances. \n \nG. \n\nEthnic Minorities \n\nSpecific actions for ethnic minorities will be prepared if the impacts on ethnic minorities \n14. \nare  identified  but  are  not  considered  to  be  significant.  Ethnic  minority  development  plans \n(EMDPs)  will  be  prepared  if  the  benefits  and  impacts  on  ethnic  minorities  are  found  to  be \nsignificant.  The objectives of the specific actions and the EMDP are to ensure negative effects \non them are mitigated and benefits are enhanced. \n \n15. \nSpecific activities will include: (i) screening of basic characteristics and issues of ethnic \nminorities  in  each  commune  within  the  zone  of  influence  of  the  project  roads;  (ii)  social  and \ncultural assessment of each commune within the zone of influence; and (iii) full participation of \nthe local communities, committee for ethnic minorities and mountainous areas (CEMMA), local \norganizations  and  bilateral  and  NGOs  in  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  development \nprograms.   \n \n16. \nSpecific  Actions  on  ethnic  minorities  and  EMDPs  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with \nADB's Policy on Indigenous Peoples and the approved ethnic minority development framework \n(EMDF).   \n \nH. \n\nUnexploded Ordnance Clearance \n\n17. \nA study by specialists during the PPTA showed that many subproject road sections are \nin  areas  where  there  is  a  high  risk  from  unexploded  ordnance.    In  these  areas  surveys  and \nclearance  will  be  needed  before  the  construction  site  can  be  handed  over  to  the  contractors.  \nTherefore, MOT has agreed to contract with one or more specialist companies to conduct these \nsurveys  when  the  road  design  details  are  known  and  to  complete  them  before  the  contractor \ntakes possession of the construction site.    \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n39 \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT POLICY FRAMEWORK \n\n \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nThe  resettlement  policy  framework  (RPF)  establishes  the  policies  and  procedures  for \n1. \ncompensation, rehabilitation and resettlement of people affected by the Project. The provisions \nof the RPF will be applicable in all cases where land acquisition and/or resettlement is required \nas part of the implementation of a subproject. \n \nB. \n\nLegal Framework \n\n2. \nThe RPF builds on the laws of the Government of Viet Nam, particularly the Land Law \nNo. 13/2003/QH11 and regulations to implement the Law; and, the Asian Development Bank\u2019s \n(ADB\u2019s)  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995).  The  Government  legislation  covers  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  approaches  but  is  not  fully  consistent  with  the  ADB  policy.  The \nprovisions  of  the  RPF  take  precedence  over  relevant  decrees  currently  in  force  in  Viet  Nam \nwherever  a  gap  exists  between  the  ADB  policy  and  Vietnamese  law,  as  per  Decree \n17/2001/ND-CP. \n \nC. \n\nProject Affected People \n\n3. \nIn  accordance  with  ADB  policy,  affected  people  (APs)  include  any  person,  household, \nfirm,  or  private  institution  who,  on  account  of  changes  resulting  from  the  Project,  or  any  of  its \nphases  or  subprojects,  will  have  its  (i)  standards  of  living  adversely  affected;  (ii)  right,  title,  or \ninterest  in  any  house,  land  (including  residential,  agricultural,  nonagricultural,  forest,  salt-\nmaking, and/or grazing land), water resources or any other moveable or fixed assets acquired, \npossessed,  restricted,  or  otherwise  adversely  affected,  in  full  or  in  part,  permanently  or \ntemporarily;  and/or  (iii)  business,  occupation,  place  of  work,  residence,  or  habitat  adversely \naffected, with or without displacement. \n \nD. \n\nResettlement Objective and Principles \n\nThe overall objective of the Project with respect to land acquisition and resettlement is to \n4. \nensure  that  all  people  affected  by  the  Project  and  its  subprojects  are  able  to  maintain  and, \npreferably,  improve  their  pre-project  living  standards  and  income-earning  capacity  through \ncompensation for the loss of physical and nonphysical assets and, as required, other assistance \nand  rehabilitation  measures.    The  following  principles  have  been  adopted  for  the  Project  to \nguide the compensation and entitlement policy. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nAcquisition of land and other assets and the relocation of affected people will be \nminimized as much as possible by exploring all viable options. \nAll  APs  are  entitled  to  compensation  at  replacement  cost  for  their  lost  assets, \nincomes, and businesses, including temporary losses or impacts.  \nRehabilitation  assistance  will  be  provided  to  severely  affected  people  and  other \nvulnerable  groups  to  assist  them  to  improve  or  at  least  restore  their  pre-project \nliving standards, incomes, and productive capacity. \nParticular  attention  must  be  paid  to  the  needs  of  the  poorest  people  and \nvulnerable groups that may be at high risk of impoverishment. This may include \nthose without legal title to land or other assets, landless households, households \nheaded  by  females,  the  elderly,  or  disabled  and  other  vulnerable  groups, \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nparticularly  ethnic  minorities.  Appropriate  assistance  must  be  provided  to  help \nthem improve their socioeconomic status. \nAffected people that lose only part of their physical assets will not be left with a \nportion  that  will  be  inadequate  to  sustain  their  current  standard  of  living.  The \nminimum  size  of  remaining  land  and  structures  will  be  agreed  during  the \nresettlement planning process.  \nLack  of  legal  title  to  affected  assets  will  not  bar  APs  from  entitlement  to \ncompensation  and  assistance \nthis \nto  achieve \nResettlement Policy Framework. \nAs a priority, loss of agricultural land will be compensated with alternative land of \nequal size and productive capacity. If suitable replacement land is not available \nand/or  at  the  \u201cinformed  request\u201d  of  APs,  compensation  will  be  paid  in  cash  at \nreplacement value base on current market prices for agricultural land of the same \ncategory (or productive capacity) as the affected land. \n\nthe  stated  objectives  of \n\n(x) \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  Replacement  land  for  agriculture,  residential  purposes,  and  businesses  will  be \nprovided  with  secure  tenure  status;  all  fees,  sales  taxes,  or  other  surcharges \nassociated with transfer of land title will be waived.  \nCompensation  for  houses  and  other  structures  will  be  determined  according  to \nreplacement value for materials and labor to rebuild similar structures, at current \nmarket  prices  in  the  locality.  In  determining  replacement  costs,  depreciation  of \nassets and salvage value of materials will not be taken into account. \nIn the case of the relocation of APs, replacement houses and/or agricultural land \nwill be located as close as possible to the assets that were lost, and at locations \nacceptable  to  APs.  Relocated  APs  will  receive  relocation  and  transition \nsubsistence allowances.  \nEfforts shall be made to maintain, to the extent possible, the existing social and \ncultural institutions of the resettled people and host communities. \nAPs  will  be  fully  consulted  and  will  participate  in  the  preparation  and \nimplementation of resettlement plans (RPs) for each subproject. The comments \nand  suggestions  of  affected  people  and  communities  will  be  taken  into  account \nduring the design and implementation phases of resettlement activities. \n\n(xii) \n\n(xi) \n\n(xiii)  Adequate  resources  will  be  identified  and  committed  during  resettlement \nplanning  for  each  subproject  and  the  overall  Project.  This  includes  adequate \nbudgetary  support  fully  committed  for  each  subproject  and  made  available  to \ncover \nresettlement,  and \nrehabilitation  within  the  agreed  implementation  period  for  the  subproject;  and, \nadequate  human  resources  for  supervision,  liaison,  and  monitoring  of  land \nacquisition, resettlement, and rehabilitation activities. \n\nland  acquisition,  compensation, \n\nthe  costs  of \n\n(xiv)  Appropriate  reporting,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  mechanisms  will  be  identified \nand set in place as part of the resettlement management system. Monitoring and \nevaluation of the land acquisition, resettlement, and rehabilitation processes and \nthe final outcomes will be conducted by an independent monitoring agency. \n(xv)  Detailed  RPs  will  be  translated  into  Vietnamese  or,  where  necessary,  the  local \nlanguage and placed in the commune offices for the reference of APs as well as \nother interested groups. \n\n(xvi)  ADB  shall  not  approve  the  hand  over  for  commencement  of  civil  works  of  any \nspecific  part  of  a  subproject  to  be  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds  unless  the \nGovernment  has  satisfactorily  completed  payment  of  compensation  for  affected \nassets and any relocation to new sites, in accordance with the approved RP for \nthe subproject. Rehabilitation measures must also be in place but not necessarily \ncompleted, as these may be ongoing activities. \n\n\f \n\nE. \n\nEligibility \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n41 \n\n5. \nFor  each  subproject  that  requires  land  acquisition,  the  cut-off  date  for  eligibility  for \nentitlements  to  compensation  for  lost  assets  is  defined  as  the  completion  of  the  detailed \nmeasurement  survey  (DMS).  People  who  move  into  the  subproject  area  and/or  who  construct \nassets  after  the  subproject  cut-off  date  are  not  entitled  to  compensation  or  any  other  form  of \nresettlement  assistance.  They  will  be  requested  to  vacate  premises  and  dismantle  affected \nstructures  prior  to  project  implementation.  Their  dismantled  structures  will  not  be  confiscated, \nand they will not have to pay any fine or sanction. \n \nF. \n\nCompensation and Entitlement Policy \n\nThe project compensation and entitlement policy is designed to cover compensation for \n7. \nlost assets and assistance to restore or enhance livelihoods of all APs. Affected people will not \nonly receive replacement land or cash for land and other assets at replacement value based on \nmarket prices at the time of compensation, but various rehabilitation measures will be available \nto severely affected, very poor and otherwise vulnerable APs. Table A7.1 summarizes the main \ntypes of losses and the support proposed for each type of loss. \n \nG. \n\nInstitutional Arrangements \n\n8. \nThe  Ministry  of  Transport  (MOT)  is  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project,  with \nresponsibility  for  planning  and  implementation  delegated  to  Project  Management  Unit  No  1 \n(PMU-1) and the provincial department of transports (PDOTs). PMU-1 will ensure that Provincial \nResettlement Committees (PRC) are established for each subproject under the direction of the \nProvincial  Peoples\u2019  Committee  (PPC),  as  well  as  resettlement  committees  at  the  district  and \ncommune levels. The PRC and RCs at lower levels will be responsible to the PDOTs and PMU-\n1 for preparation and implementation of approved RPs. Representatives of the Women\u2019s Union \nand/or  the  Farmers\u2019  Association  will  participate  actively  in  RCs  at  all  levels.  The  PDOT  will \nmaintain computerized databases of affected people and assets. \n \n9. \nThe PPC and PRC will establish compensation rates for the subproject. These rates will \nbe  based  on  annual  PPC  rates  adjusted,  as  necessary,  by  the  findings  of  a  replacement  cost \nsurvey  to  be  conducted  by  the  independent  monitoring  agency.  Compensation  rates  will  be \ncontinuously updated to ensure that APs receive compensation based on full replacement value \nat the time of compensation payments. \n \nH. \n\nPublic Consultation and Disclosure \n\n10. \nAccording to ADB policy, APs must be fully consulted and provided with opportunities to \nparticipate in the planning and implementation of land acquisition and resettlement. In addition, \nthey  must  be  informed  in  an  appropriate  and  timely  manner  of  the  outcomes  of  the  planning \nprocess,  as  well  as  schedules  and  procedures  for  implementation  of  the  RP.  PMU-1  and  the \nPDOTs  will  oversee  the  activities  of  the  PRC  and  RCs  at  lower  levels  to  carry  out  public \ninformation and consultation programs during all stages of the land acquisition and resettlement \nprocess, including public information meetings, participation of APs in the DMS, full disclosure \nof the RP and informing APs about procedures for payment of compensation and, as required, \nrelocation. \n \n11. \nPrior to the Management Review Meeting (MRM) for the Project, the RPF was translated \ninto Vietnamese and copies, in both English and Vietnamese languages, were distributed to the \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nproject  provinces  for  review  and  endorsement.    The  RPF  will  be  uploaded  on  the  ADB \nresettlement website immediately upon Board approval.   \n \n12. \nFor the four RPs that have been prepared for Phase 1, the following requirements were \nmet  prior  to  MRM:    (i)  distribution  of  a  public  information  brochure  in  Vietnamese  and,  as \nrequired, ethnic minority language(s) to the affected communities; (ii) placement of copies of the \nRP in Vietnamese and English in provincial, district, and commune offices; and (iii) uploading of \nthe  RPs  on  the  ADB  resettlement  website.    During  loan  implementation,  the  (i)  RPs  will  be \nupdated for Phase 1 and (ii) RPs will be prepared for Phases 2 and 3 following detailed design.  \nAll RPs, prior to submission to ADB for review and approval, will include: (i) the distribution of a \npublic information brochure in Vietnamese and, as required, ethnic minority language(s) to the \naffected  communities;  and  (ii)  placement  of  copies  of  the  RPs  in  Vietnamese  and  English  in \nprovincial, district, and commune offices. All RPs submitted to ADB for review will be disclosed \non the ADB resettlement website before ADB approval.   \n \nI. \n\nComplaints and Grievances \n\n13. \nThe Project will ensure that APs have clear and accessible mechanisms and procedures \nto address complaints and grievances about any aspect of land acquisition, compensation, and \nresettlement.  A  four-step  process  will  permit  APs  to  submit  grievances  to  the  Commune \nPeople\u2019s  Committee  (CPC)  and,  if  not  satisfied  with  the  decision,  appeal  successively  to  the \nPeople\u2019s Committees at district and provincial levels and, finally, to the District People\u2019s Count.  \n \nJ. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\nThe  Project  will  ensure \n\ninternal  and  external  monitoring  of \n\n14. \nland  acquisition, \ncompensation and resettlement activities. PMU-1 is responsible for internal monitoring, in close \ncollaboration  with  PRC  and  RCs  at  lower  levels.  An  independent  monitoring  agency  will  be \nretained  to  conduct  external  monitoring  and  evaluation,  focusing  on  the  social  impacts  of  the \nProject  and  whether  APs  are  able  to  improve  or  at  least  restore  their  pre-project  living \nstandards,  incomes,  and  productive  capacity.  Sample  surveys  of  APs  will  be  carried  out \nbiannually  during  implementation  of  the  RP,  as  well  6\u201312  months  after  completion  of  all \nresettlement activities. \n \nK. \n\nBudget \n\nThe budget for the RPs covers the cost of land acquisition, compensation payments, and \n15. \nallowances  to  APs,  operational/administration  expenses,  internal  and  external  monitoring,  and \ncontingencies.   \n \nPMU-1 will be responsible for channeling funds for the compensation for land acquisition \n16. \nand  resettlement  to  the  respective  PPC.  The  PPC  will  be  responsible  for  payment  directly  to \nAPs with respect to affected land, structures, crops and trees.  PMU-1 will also be responsible \nfor  contracting  an  NGO  or  other  independent  institution  to  conduct  external  monitoring  of \nimplementation of the RP. \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n43 \n\nTable A7.1 Entitlement Matrix \n\nEntitlement \n\n(cid:131) \n\n(cid:131) \n\n(cid:131) \n\n(cid:131) \n\n(cid:131) \n\n(cid:131) \n\n(cid:131) \n\n(cid:131) \n\n(cid:131) \n\n(cid:131) \n\n(cid:131) \n\n(cid:131) \n\n(cid:131) \n\n(cid:131) \n(cid:131) \n\n(cid:131) \n\n(cid:131) \n\n(cid:131) \n\nLegal/legalizable APs and eligible organizations are entitled to replacement land of equal \narea and productive capacity up to a maximum of the land quota in the province, or cash \nat full replacement value of the affected land. \nIf affected land exceeds the land quota area, APs are entitled to cash at replacement \nvalue for the excess affected land. \nAPs with temporary/lease rights are entitled to cash for loss of net income for the \nremaining lease period, or 30% of replacement value for the affected land, whichever is \nhigher. \n\n(cid:131)  Non-titled APs are not entitled to compensation for land, but will receive an economic \n\nrehabilitation package and, if left landless, local authorities will allocate replacement land \nif available. \nSeverely affected APs who lose more than 10% of their land and very poor APs are \nentitled to an economic rehabilitation package. \nLegal/legalizable APs and eligible organizations are entitled to replacement land of equal \narea up to a maximum of the land quota in the province, or cash equal to full \nreplacement value of the affected land. \nIf affected land exceeds the land quota area, APs are entitled to cash at replacement \nvalue for the excess affected land. \nAPs with temporary/lease rights are entitled to cash equivalent to 30% of the \nreplacement value for affected land. \n\n(cid:131)  Non-titled APs are not entitled to compensation for land, but if left landless or otherwise \n\nvulnerable, local authorities will allocate alternate land or housing.  \nAll APs regardless of land use rights are entitled to cash compensation at current market \nprices. \n\nAll APs regardless of land use rights are entitled to cash compensation at full \nreplacement value for affected structures, with no deduction for depreciation or \nsalvageable materials. \nAPs with partially affected structures who do not relocate are entitled to an allowance to \nrepair damages due to dismantling. \nIf remaining structures are not viable and APs relocate, they are entitled to relocation \nand transition subsistence allowances. \n\n(cid:131)  Compensation for removal of graves will be paid directly to APs, including costs of new \n\ngraves, exhumation and transport of remains, reburial and all other reasonable costs. \nAPs with unregistered businesses are entitled to cash allowance based on the provincial \nminimum wage for the period that business income is disrupted up to six months. \nAPs with registered businesses are entitled to an allowance equal to monthly after-tax \nrevenues, for six months. \nIf businesses relocate, owners are entitled to a relocation allowance. \nEmployees and hired labor that temporarily lose work are entitled to an allowance equal \nto current salary/wages for the period they can not work; if they lose jobs permanently, \nthey are entitled to six months\u2019 wages/salary or value of the remaining contract. \nIf land temporarily acquired during construction is returned to APs, they are entitled to \nrent during the period of temporary use and the Project will pay to restore land to its \nprevious condition. \nIf temporary acquisition exceeds one year, APs can opt to continue the rental \narrangement or sell the land to the Project. \nEligible APs will receive an economic rehabilitation package consisting of a transition \nsubsistence allowance and in-kind assistance to assist them to restore living standards. \n\nType of Impact \n\n1.

The overall \nobjectives  of  the  EMDF  are  to  ensure  (i)  that  the  project  does  not  cause  adverse  social  and \ncultural  impacts;  and  (ii)  that  it  provides  the  opportunity  for  ethnic  minorities  to  reap  project \nbenefits  that  are  equal  to,  or  greater  than,  the  dominant  cultural  group  by  ensuring  ethnic \nminorities participate fully in project planning and implementation.   \n \nB. \n \n\nPreparation of Ethnic Minority Specific Actions  \nand Ethnic Minority Development Plans \n\nScreening  to  establish  basic  characteristics  and  issues  of  ethnic  minorities  in  each \n2. \ncommune  within  the  zone  of  influence  of  the  project  roads  is  the  first  step  in  categorizing  the \nimpacts  and  identifying  approaches  to  address  ethnic  minority  issues.  An  ethnic  minority \nspecific action (EMSA) is prepared if impacts on affected ethnic minorities are limited and when \nthere  is  a  risk  that  the  Project  may  not  bring  the  intended  benefits  to  the  affected  ethnic \nminorities.  The  EMSA  may  take  the  form  of  (i)  incorporating  ethnic  minorities  (who  might  be \nexcluded from the Project) into the project beneficiary group; (ii) incorporating ethnic minorities\u2019 \nspecific  needs  (that  may  not  be  addressed  by  the  Project)  into  the  project  plan;  and  (iii)  a \ncommon  community  action  plan  where  ethnic  minorities  live  with  the  non-ethnic  minorities \npeoples  in  the  same  project  location.  The  Project  will  avoid  any  unnecessary  distinctions  or \ninequalities between ethnic minorities and other poor and marginal groups who live in the same \nlocality.  \n \n3. \nAn  ethnic  minority  development  plan  (EMDP)  is  prepared  when  the  impacts  on  ethnic \nminorities are found to be significant and they positively or negatively (i) affect their customary \nrights of use and access to land and natural resources; (ii) change their socioeconomic status; \n(iii) affect their cultural and communal integrity; (iv) affect their health, education, and livelihood, \nand  social  security  status;  or  (v)  alter  or  undermine  the  recognition  of  indigenous  knowledge.  \nThe  EMDP  is  an  integral  part  of  the  project  design  which  includes  provisions  for  project \nimplementation, monitoring, and evaluation. The EMDP is time-bound, with an adequate budget \nfor its implementation. The EMDP is needed to ensure that ethnic minorities are included in the \ndevelopment  process.  The  EMDP  will  also  need  to  provide  specific  mechanisms  for  the \nconcerns  of  ethnic  minority  women  to  be  identified  and  addressed  through  the  subproject \nprocess.   Activities include: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nimpacts  on \n\nConduct  of  social  and  cultural  analysis,  to  consist  of:  (a)  identification  of \nsignificant  negative  and  positive \nthe  ethnic  minorities; \n(b) identification of the measures required to mitigate the negative impacts; and \n(c) identification of the types and levels of vulnerability that might limit the ethnic \nminorities\u2019 ability to benefit from the project recommend measures, on a priority \nbasis, to enhance benefits. \nPreparation  of  stand-alone  EMDPs  identifying  the  analysis  and  include  specific \nstrategies and activities as a result of participatory community consultations and \nplanning.   \nCoordination  with  CEMMA,  local  organizations  and  bilateral  agencies  or \ninternational  NGOs  working  on  poverty  reduction  programs  (e.g.,  agricultural \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n45 \n\n \n\n \nC. \n\nextension  services)  in  the  project  area  to  allow  possible  integration  of  project \nactivities with existing social interventions.   \nDisclosure  of  EMDPs  to  affected  communities  and  general  public  prior  to \nsubmission to ADB for review and approval. \nSubmission to ADB for review and approval prior to implementation. \nDisclosure  of  EMDPs  on  ADB  indigenous  peoples  website  immediately  upon \nADB approval. \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n\nEthnic Minorities in Phase 1 and 2 Road Networks \n\n4. \nAn  initial  social  assessment  was  carried  out  during  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance (PPTA) for Phase 1 and 2 road networks.  Five of the nine networks that make up \nthe  Phase  1  and  2  area  have  ethnic  minority  groups  living  on  the  subproject  roads.  In  total, \nthere  are  approximately  54,816  people  from  ethnic  minorities  living  in  27  communes  within \nthese five networks along eight subproject roads.  These eight roads are in Ninh Thuan (roads \n1303, 1307, and 1310), Binh Thuan (road 1403), Dak Nong (road 1701), Dak Lak (roads 1702 \nand 1703) and Lam Dong (road 1801). Overall, people from ethnic minorities account for 6.2% \nof the population along network roads in Phases 1 and 2 but on roads on five of these networks, \npeople  from  ethnic  minorities  account  for  11.4%  of  the  population.  However,  some  of  the \ncommunes  in  these  networks  have  very  high  percentages  of  ethnic  minorities,  most  notably \nBinh Thuan, Dak Lak, and Lam Dong, where in four communes over 85% of the population is \nfrom ethnic minorities.  \n \n5. \nThe roads providing access for the ethnic minority communities have been in existence \nfor  some  time,  although  they  are  generally  in  poor  condition,  with  some  closed  for  periods  of \ndays during the rainy season.  Consequently, none of the project communities or ethnic minority \ncommunities,  fall  within  the  definition  of  \u201cisolated\u201d  within  the  Vietnamese  context,  where  this \nterm  is  used  to  describe  very  remote  mountain  communities  without  road  access.  This  is  an \nimportant point in terms of the potential impacts on culture and traditions of the ethnic minority \ncommunities  living  in  on  eight  of  the  subproject  roads.  Overall,  ethnic  minority  communities \nalong  the  roads  mostly  live  among  Kinh  people  and  are  assimilated  to  varying  degrees.  The \nProject will have a range of social benefits mostly associated with improvements in standards of \nliving  and  enhancement  of  general well-being  of  households  and  communes.    However,  there \nmay  be  some  ethnic  minority  communities  that  are  vulnerable  and  may  face  difficulties  in \nabsorbing project benefits compared with the mainstream population due to poverty, language, \ncultural  differences,  low  skill  levels  and,  in  some  cases,  limited  contact  with  the  mainstream \npopulation. The impacts on ethnic minorities are found to be limited.  The issue with the most \npotential for negative impacts is that of land acquisition and resettlement.  The general impacts \nand benefits on ethnic minorities are found in Table A8.1.  \n \nD. \n\nMitigation and Development Strategy \n\nThe following mitigation measures and development interventions arose from the results \n\n6. \nof community consultations.   \n \n\n(i) \n\nResettlement  plans  have  been  and  will  continue  to  be  prepared  to  address  the \nland acquisition and resettlement impacts.  Sociocultural conditions of the ethnic \nminorities have been and will be taken into account to ensure that they are aware \nof  project  impacts  and  benefits,  their  rights  and  entitlements  as  affected  ethnic \nminorities,  in  a  form  and  language  and  approach  that  they  can  understand.  In \nPhase  1,  the  resettlement  plan  that  has  been  prepared  for  Lam  Dong  province \nincludes specific actions on ethnic minorities. \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n \n\nImpact \nPositive Impacts \nDecrease in \nTransportation \nCost.    \n\nImproved \naccess to \nMarkets and \nAgricultural \nExtension \n\nImpact on \nService Delivery \nand Access \n\nEmployment \nDuring \nConstruction \n\nNegative Impacts \nRelocation and \nResettlement \n\nIncreased Road \nAccidents \n\nIncreased \nExposure to \nCommunicable \nDiseases \n\nIncreased in \nMigration  \n\nTable A8.1  General Impacts and Benefits \n\nEffect \n\nThe poverty impact analysis finds that the primary mechanism through which benefits will accrue \nto the poor is savings in vehicle operating costs that will be passed on to the poor through lower \nfreight rates, lower passenger fares, and time savings.  However, ethnic minorities may benefit to \na lower degree than other project beneficiaries because they use passenger transport or shipping \nservices less.  Many ethnic minority households do not produce enough agriculture produce to be \nable to sell meaningful quantities and those that do usually sell locally.  Ethnic minority households \nin more remote areas may benefit from an increase in the availability of goods and a decrease in \nprices because of a fall in transport costs. \nThe  ability  to  get  goods  to  market  will  encourage  farmers  to  produce  more  and  higher  value \nproducts  and  move  out  of  subsistence  farming.    Although  some  ethnic  minority  farmers  produce \ncash  crops  and  livestock  products,  many  may  need  assistance  to  move  beyond  subsistence \nfarming.    It  may  be  more  difficult  for  ethnic  minorities  to  make  investments  in  production  and \nmarketing (eliminating middlemen and be able to take greater advantage of market fluctuations) of \nhigher-valued and perishable products.  Improved access to agricultural extension services such \nas sustainable production techniques could assist ethnic minorities \nAccess  to  existing  services  at  commune  and  district  level  will  improve  and  ethnic  minorities  will \nbenefit from easier and less costly access to these services.  As the project surveys found, local \npeople,  including  ethnic  minority  people,  are  heavy  road  users.  It  is  anticipated  that  all  groups, \nethnic  minority  and  mainstream  populations  will  benefit  from  easier  travel  and  improved  year \nround access. \n \nImproved  roads  will  also  have  a  positive  impact  on  the  attendance  of  ethnic  minority  children  in \nschools.  Social services in villages may also improve benefiting ethnic minority communities.  For \nexample, teachers and other social service providers may be more willing to work in the area after \ntransportation problems have been reduced and/or make more regular trips to the villages.  This \nimpact will be strongest on roads that were previously not opened all year round. \nThere  is  an  expectation  among  ethnic  minorities  of  employment  during  the  construction  stage.  \nHowever, this may not arise  without explicit project intervention.  Often road building contractors \nhire  mainly  through  labor  contractors,  who  may  or  may  not  hire  from  surrounding  villages.    This \ncan  result  in  only  a  few  local  people  being  hired  and  then  only  for  short  periods.    It  is  important \nthat ethnic minorities from local communities benefit as much as possible from increased earnings \nresulting  from  construction  employment  and  that  all  civil  works  contractors  comply  with  all \napplicable labor laws.  Provisions for these issues will be built into the monitoring program for the \nProject. \n\nThe  issue  with  the  most  significant  potential  for  negative  impact  is  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement.    In  Phase  1,  about  30  people  from  ethnic  minorities  in  Lam  Dong  Province  will  be \naffected by acquisition of agricultural land.  Five  will be severely affected.  Specific actions have \nbeen included in the resettlement plan prepared for Lam Dong.  \nLocal  residents  are  concerned  about  an  increase  in  road  accidents  because  of  faster  vehicle \nspeeds.  Concern was expressed by members of ethnic minorities, both women and men, about \nthe risk to their children traveling to school along the roads.  Roadside improvements will need to \ninclude proper signage for speed limits and passing areas. \nIt is not anticipated that truck traffic  will increase in the short term.  The network layouts provide \nlittle scope for the diversion or generation of traffic to the subproject roads.  The subproject roads \nmainly  serve  low-density  rural  communities  and  do  not  provide  thoroughfares  between  major \nhighways  or  cross  border  connections.    Therefore,  the  risk  of  increasing  transmission  of \nHIV/AIDSa because of increased truck traffic appears to be low. \nGiven the current condition of the roads, it is not anticipated that road improvements will lead to \nsignificant in-migration. However, although the impact of in-migration from distant provinces may \nbe small, the improved roads will probably draw people from the local area.  The amount of good \nland in the project area is finite and people moving closer to the road could put pressure on ethnic \ncommunities, as they may have less experience at dealing with outsiders and other ethnic minority \ngroups.  \n\na Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome \nSource(s): Asian Development Bank Staff \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n47 \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\ntransmitted \n\nRoad safety designs will be covered within the institutional capacity building and \ntraining needs component of the Project. \nThe  HIV/AIDS  and  sexually \ninfections  (STI)  awareness  and \nprevention program will be implemented under the Project and will target ethnic \nminorities.  \nThe  sustainable  agricultural  production  program  has  been  identified  during  the \ninitial social assessment and community consultations as an intervention that can \nincrease the agricultural production of ethnic minorities.  The farmer field schools \nand  farmer  life  schools  activities  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  national  integrated  pest \nmanagement  (IPM)  program  offers  a  good  example  of  a  community-driven, \nsustainable  livelihood  approach  to  increasing  community  empowerment  while \nincreasing  agricultural  production.  The  national  IPM  Program  is  already  well-\nestablished, offers a nationwide body of trainers, and has a proven track record.   \n\n \nE. \n\nInstitutional Arrangements \n\nThe  Ministry  of  Transport  (MOT)  is  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project,  with \n7. \nresponsibility  for  planning  and  implementation  delegated  to  Project  Management  Unit  No  1 \n(PMU-1)  and  the  provincial  departments  of  transport  (PDOTs).  A  social  development/ethnic \nminority development program coordinator will assist PMU-1 in the design and implementation \nof  the  EMSAs  and  EMDPs.    PMU-1  will  ensure  that  a suitable  NGO  is  engaged  to  implement \nEMDPs  in  accordance  with  ADB  indigenous  peoples  policies,  procedures  and  implementation \nrequirements. \n \nF. \n\nBudget \n\n8. \nA budget of $500,000 has been allocated from the overall project cost to provide funds \nfor the preparation and implementation of EMSAs and EMDP if these are required.  The design \nand implementation of EMSA and EMDP will be covered in the terms of reference for the civil \nworks and implementation services.  \n \nG. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n9. \nDetailed  design,  resettlement  planning  and implementation  started in September  2005.  \nIt is anticipated that construction contracts will start being awarded in July 2006.  It is essential \nthat the EMSAs and EMDPs be prepared before the civil works begin so that potential negative \nimpacts can be identified and appropriate specific actions and mitigating measures put in place.  \n \nH. \n\nMonitoring and Supervision \n\nThe design and implementation of EMSAs and EMDPs will be monitored regularly. A set \n10. \nof  monitoring  indicators  will  be  determined  during  project  implementation.    Monitoring  will \ninvolve  staff  from  PMU-1,  provincial  project  management  units  (PPMUs)  and  representatives \nfrom  ethnic  minorities,  communities,  and  organizations  to  ensure  participatory  monitoring \narrangements. PMU-1 will submit regular reports to ADB.  An external monitoring team will also \nbe engaged, if required.   \n \n\n \n\n\fD.

These  lists \nwere  subsequently  scrutinized  by  the  consultant  to  ascertain  their  completeness  and \nconsistency, and to identify coherent networks that connect to major roads, thus ensuring that \nthe project area receives effective all-year connections to markets and services. The proposed \nnetworks were discussed in detail with representatives from the concerned provinces during a \nworkshop in Hanoi, on 27 November 2003, to arrive at an agreed-upon long list of networks. \n \nThe  networks  were  then  prioritized  to  assess  the  potential  of  individual  networks  to \n2. \ngenerate  economic  benefits  and  achieve  the  social  objectives  of  the  project.  The  criteria \nadopted were: (i) population served, (ii)  incidence of poverty in the zone of influence, (iii) traffic \nintensity, (iv) the general surface condition of the existing roads, and (v) the number of days of \nroad  closure  per  year. The  networks  with  the highest score  in  each  province  were  included  in \nPhase 1 and subjected to detailed cost--benefit analysis based on road inventory and classified \ntraffic counts for each project road. This produced the data needed for economic analysis by the \nHDM-4 model.1 Calibration of HDM-4 was applied to reflect local conditions, in particular vehicle \nspeeds and the effects of very high proportions of motorcycles in total traffic flow. \n \n3. \nThe  economic  evaluation  compared  the  \u201cwith\u201d  and  the  \u201cwithout\u201d  project  cases.  The \nproject  networks  were  evaluated  for  a  period  up  to  and  including  2027,  allowing  for  a  2-year \nconstruction period starting in 2006, followed by a benefit period of 20 years. The analysis was \nperformed using the world price numeraire. Current wage rates in the project area were found to \nreflect  the  marginal  value  of  skilled  labor  whereas  the  marginal  value  of  unskilled  labor  was \nabout 55% of the current minimum wage rate.2 A medium-term forecast for crude oil of $30 per \nbarrel  was  adopted  in  lieu  of  current  crude  prices,  to  avoid  the  impact  of  spurious  price \nvariations.  The  estimate  is  derived  from  data  and  analysis  published  in  by  the  International \nEnergy Agency on its website in 2004. Except for oil products, all base prices are current as of \n2004. \n \n4. \nBenefits  are  identified  by  assessing  (i) the  incremental  direct  user  benefits  due  to \nreduced vehicle operating costs (VOC) and passenger time savings, and (ii) the direct savings \nin  road  maintenance  cost  due  to  upgrading  of  road  surfaces  from  earth  or  gravel  to  sealed \nstandards.  Future  maintenance  costs  in  the  \u201cwith\u201d  and  \u201cwithout\u201d  cases  were  determined  using \nHDM-4 to identify optimal maintenance. The capital cost associated with the project includes the \ncost  of  construction,  design,  supervision,  environmental  mitigation,  land  acquisition,  and \nresettlement. The residual value of the roads at the end of the evaluation period, estimated at \n25% of the cost of construction, was included. The assumed residual value of 25% reflects the \nfact  that  it  is  unusual  for  a  road  to  be  abandoned.  More  typically,  the  existing  road  will  be \nincorporated  into  rehabilitation  or  upgrading  work.  The  residual  value  assumed  reflects  the \nsavings  in  the  cost  of  constructing  the  \u201crehabilitated\u201d  or  \u201cupgraded\u201d  road  by  incorporating  the \nremains of the existing road. \n \n\n                                                 \n1 The highway design and maintenance model version 4 (HDM-4) is the acknowledged reference tool for economic \n\nassessment of road projects. \n\n2  These  results  were  obtained  from  the  initial  social  analysis  and  concur  with  the  findings  of  similar  studies  in  Viet \n\nNam performed recently by the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n53 \n\nB. \n\nForecast Traffic and Traffic Benefits \n\n5. \nNormal traffic growth is forecasted by applying income-elasticities that link future traffic \ngrowth to forecast future economic growth. The forecast assumes that the Vietnamese economy \nwill continue to expand at approximately the same rate as in the previous 10 years, about 7.5% \nper  annum  on  average.  The  elasticity  adopted  is  based  on  those  estimated  in  the  Rural \nTransport  Study,3  with  some  modifications  reflecting  trends  in  traffic  growth  rates  in  Viet  Nam \nover the 10 years to 2003. The adopted growth rates are summarized in Table A13.1. \n \n\nForecast Year \n\n2000\u20132005 \n\n2006\u20132010 \n\nTable A13.1: Forecast Annual Normal Traffic Growth Rates \nCar \n\nMotorcycle \n\nBus \n\n13.5% \n\n10.5% \n\n9.8% \n\n8.4% \n\n9.0% \n\n7.8% \n\nTruck \n\n8.6% \n\n8.1% \n\n8.5% \n\n7.5% \n\n7.2% \n\n2011\u20132027 \n\n7.5% \nSource: ADB. 2002.

(TA4034-VIE) \n \n6. \nGenerated  traffic  was  included  in  the  case  of  earth  roads,  where  conditions  during  the \nrainy  season  significantly  affect  the  flow  of  traffic.  The  potential  for  diverted  traffic  was  not \nidentified in any of the networks and diverted traffic has therefore not been included. Based on \nthe  traffic  forecast  and  the  improvements  in  road  conditions,  vehicle  operating  cost  (VOC) \nsavings relative to the \u201cwithout\u201d case were calculated using the HDM-4 model. The savings in \nVOC  costs  in  the  \u201cwith\u201d  case  result  from  smoother  road  surfaces  and  higher  speeds.  The \nassociated  passenger  time  savings  were  based  on  estimated  economic  values  of  time, \nobserved  average  vehicle  occupancy  rates,  and  the  calculated  time  savings  resulting  from \nhigher vehicle speeds. \n \nC. \n\nProject Costs \n\n7. \nThe capital costs are estimated assuming upgrading or rehabilitation of the project roads \nto Class V or Class IV standard as indicated by predicted traffic and in all cases with a double \nbituminous surface treatment (DBST) pavement. Bridge repair costs have been included in the \ntotal  capital  cost  of  the  road  under  consideration.  Wherever  an  existing  bridge  has  been \nevaluated as unsafe, replacement costs have been applied. The total costs include allowances \nfor  miscellaneous  cost  items,  environmental  mitigation  measures,  resettlement,  design,  and \nconstruction supervision. It was assumed that Phase I construction will take place during 2006\u2013\n2007. \n \n8. \nThe  cost  of  road  maintenance,  encompassing  routine  and  periodic  maintenance,  was \nincluded  using  HDM-4  estimation  based  on  the  adopted  construction  standards  and  forecast \ntraffic.  In  the  case  of  upgrading  of  an  unsealed  road  to  sealed  standard,  future  maintenance \ncosts  are  lower  than  in  the  \u201cwithout\u201d  case.  The  reduction  is  considered  a  benefit  in  the \nevaluation. Another benefit is the residual value of the roads at the end of the analytical horizon, \nestimated at 25% of construction cost. \n \nD. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nThe  economic  evaluation  discounts  the  stream  of  benefits  and  costs  over  a  22-year \n9. \nevaluation period from start of construction in 2006 until 20 years after completion of the road \n\n                                                 \n3 DFID. 2000.

The  EIRRs  for  the  road  networks  considered  for Phase  1  implementation \nare  in  the  range  of  12.5%\u201343.6%.    Apart  from  these  two  extremes,  three  networks  generate \nEIRRs  of  14.4%\u201314.8%  and  four  networks  20.0%\u201322.4%.  The  EIRR  for  Phase  1  in  total  is \n22.3%. Table A13.2 provides a summary of the net benefit streams. \n \n10. \nThe poor current condition of many of the roads means that high levels of benefits are \ngenerated  when  traffic  levels  are  significant,  or  there  are  high  levels  of  motorcycle  traffic.    In \nsome  cases  the  benefits  would  be  expected  to  be  higher  than  those  shown,  as  there  will  be \nadditional benefits to those included in the evaluation.  This applies particularly to the Ha Tinh \nand Lam Dong networks.  In the case of Ha Tinh, a large number of bridgeworks are included in \nthe  improvements,  for  which  there  will  be  benefits  in  the  form  of  preventing  future  closure  of \nroads  or  restrictions  on  vehicle  weights.    The  particularly  high  rate  of  return  for  the  Nghe  An \nnetwork  largely  reflects  the  benefits  to  a  particular  high  level  of  truck  traffic  recorded  in  that \nprovince. \n \n\nTable A13.2: Summary of Net Benefits and Calculated NPV and EIRR \n \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n7 \n\n9 \n\n \n\nYear  Nghe \nAn \n\nHa \nTinh \n\nQuang \nTri \n\nNinh \nThuan \n\nBinh \nThuan \n\nDak \nNong \n\nLam \nDong \n\nTotal \nProject \n\n4 \nThua \nThien \nHue \n\n(2,066)\n(2,067)\n680\n733\n788\n836\n888\n942\n1,000\n835\n1,120\n1,183\n1,246\n1,313\n1,395\n1,489\n1,540\n1,440\n1,915\n2,050\n2,135\n3,259\n\n8 \n\nDak \nLak \n\n(1,115) \n(1,115) \n417 \n449 \n486 \n517 \n551 \n586 \n623 \n358 \n707 \n750 \n794 \n837 \n884 \n933 \n982 \n727 \n1,216 \n1,282 \n1,339 \n1,967 \n\n($\u2019000) \n\n(2,905)\n(2,844)\n689\n916\n823\n952\n1,101\n1,375\n664\n297\n906\n805\n1,141\n862\n1,072\n1,635\n1,071\n375\n1,464\n1,736\n2,650\n5,499\n\n(2,494)\n(2,494)\n901\n978\n1,060\n1,134\n1,214\n1,300\n1,393\n1,100\n1,611\n1,730\n1,858\n1,990\n2,122\n2,248\n2,400\n2,211\n2,830\n3,044\n3,301\n4,781\n\n(3,925.8)\n(3,925.4)\n872.5\n935.9\n1,006.0\n1,069.3\n1,136.3\n1,207.0\n1,283.5\n821.1\n1,460.1\n1,551.5\n1,647.9\n1,749.5\n1,856.5\n1,968.9\n2,086.6\n1,712.3\n2,598.2\n2,766.3\n2,936.5\n5,129.2\n\n \n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n2026 \n2027 \nNPVa\n\n(3,693) \n(3,693) \n3,416 \n3,631 \n3,871 \n4,084 \n4,269 \n4,493 \n4,748 \n4,438 \n5,405 \n5,613 \n5,909 \n6,203 \n6,566 \n6,864 \n7,120 \n6,836 \n8,874 \n8,617 \n8,814 \n11,081 \n\n(3,009) \n(2,989) \n801 \n998 \n742 \n764 \n818 \n876 \n939 \n608 \n1,086 \n1,178 \n1,325 \n1,355 \n1,608 \n1,386 \n1,298 \n1,036 \n1,834 \n1,844 \n1,984 \n3,648 \n\n(1,833) \n(1,824) \n768 \n685 \n741 \n791 \n846 \n904 \n967 \n789 \n1,108 \n1,195 \n1,309 \n1,452 \n1,301 \n1,382 \n1,464 \n1,351 \n1,805 \n1,934 \n2,143 \n3,381 \n\n(1,853) \n(1,853) \n367 \n394 \n423 \n449 \n477 \n507 \n539 \n67 \n610 \n649 \n690 \n734 \n780 \n829 \n881 \n432 \n1,079 \n1,152 \n1,229 \n2,275 \n\n144 \n\n12.5 \n\n(22,895)\n(22,804)\n8,913\n9,719\n9,940\n10,598\n11,300\n12,191\n12,157\n9,313\n14,014\n14,653\n15,920\n16,495\n17,584\n18,735\n18,842\n16,122\n23,617\n24,424\n26,533\n41,020\n\n39,369\n\n22.3\n\n23,169 \n\n1,131 \n\n3,025 \n\n2,730\n\n1,171\n\n4,6312\n\n1,447\n\n1,920 \n\nEIRR (%) \n\n43.6 \n\n14.6 \n\n21.8 \n\n20.0\n\n14.8\n\n22.4\n\n14.4\n\n22.1 \n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value.  \na NPV is based on discounting at 12% to the present value in 2006. \nSource: ADB. 2002.

The IRR of each proposed project network was analyzed \nwith respect to changes in the benefit and cost streams. The tests applied were; (i) construction \ncosts  increased  and  decreased  by  20%,  (ii) road  user  benefits  increased  and  decreased  by \n20%,  (iii) traffic  growth  rates  decreased  by  2%,  (iv) the  value  of  time  benefits  decreased  by \n100%,  and  (v) completion  delayed  by  1  year.    The  results  are  shown  in  Table  A13.3.    In  the \ncase of the Lam Dong network the IRR falls below 12% with any change that increases costs or \nreduces benefits. The other three networks with a base case IRR below 15% remain viable in all \nsensitivity  tests,  although  whenever  a  test  reduces  the  IRR  it  reduces  it  to  close  to  12%  .  For \nthese networks, reducing traffic growth by 2% has the greatest impact of all the sensitivity tests. \nThe networks with IRRs of 20% or more in the base case, and the overall Project, remain clearly \nviable  in  all  cases,  even  with  significant  increases  in  costs  or  reductions  in  benefits.  The \nswitching  values  for  the  overall  project,  which  are  the  values  that  render  the  project \neconomically  infeasible,  are  estimated  at  a  98%  increase  in  capital  cost,  a  52%  decrease  in \nvehicle  operating  cost  savings,  or  a  decrease  in  traffic  growth  by  7%.  Neither  reducing \npassenger time savings nor increasing delays in project benefits can reduce net benefits to the \npoint of infeasibility. \n \n\nNetwork \n\n \nNghe An \nHa Tinh \nQuang Tri \nThua Thien-Hue \nNinh Thuan \nBinh Thuan \nDak Nong \nDak Lak \nLam Dong \nTotal  \nSwitching value \nfor Total Project \n\nTable A13.3: Sensitivity Analysis Results \n\nBase \nCase \n\nCapital Costs \n\nVOC Savings \n\n20% \n\n(20%) \n\n20% \n\n(20%) \n\nTraffic \nGrowth \n (2%) \n\nExclude \nPass. \nTime \n\nDelay \nBenefits \n1 Year \n\n37.7 \n12.2 \n18.7 \n17.1 \n12.4 \n19.3 \n12.2 \n19.0 \n10.4 \n20.4 \n\n52.0 \n17.9 \n26.2 \n24.0 \n18.2 \n26.7 \n17.5 \n26.5 \n15.4 \n28.5 \n\n43.6 \n14.6 \n21.8 \n20.0 \n14.8 \n22.4 \n14.4 \n22.1 \n12.5 \n23.7 \n\n\u2014 \n\n(IRR %) \n\n48.6 \n16.5 \n24.3 \n22.1 \n17.1 \n24.7 \n16.4 \n24.7 \n14.2 \n24.9 \n\n38.3 \n12.5 \n19.2 \n17.7 \n12.3 \n19.9 \n12.3 \n19.3 \n10.8 \n19.5 \n\n40.1 \n12.1 \n19.0 \n17.2 \n12.6 \n19.7 \n12.0 \n19.4 \n10.3 \n21.1 \n\n40.9 \n13.3 \n19.7 \n16.6 \n14.0 \n18.6 \n13.0 \n19.8 \n10.5 \n17.2 \n\n36.0 \n13.3 \n19.6 \n18.2 \n13.6 \n20.5 \n13.5 \n20.1 \n11.8 \n17.7 \n\n\u2014 \n\n(98%) \n\n(52%) \n\n(7%) \n\n\u2014 \n\nIRR = economic internal rate of return, VOC = vehicle operating cost, \u2014 = not applicable. \nSource: ADB. 2002.

The \nanalysis  indicates  that  the  poor  receive  about  46%  of  all  project  benefits.  The  relatively  high \nimpact  on  poverty  is  primarily  due  to  two  factors:  (i) implementation  of  the  project  implies  a  \ntransfer of substantial resources from the rest of the economy to the project area, which has a \npoverty  incidence  that  is  significantly  higher  than  the  national  average;  and  (ii)  the  road  user \nsurvey  carried  out  during  project  preparation  showed  that  a  high  proportion  of  road  transport \nusers are poor. \n \n\nTable A13.4: Net Benefits Accruing to Project Stakeholders Defined as Poor \n \n\nSources \n\nEconomic \nNPV \n\n \n\nReceived by Stakeholders in the Project Area \n\n \n\nEnd Users \nof Public \nPassenger \nTransport \n\nEnd \nUsers of \nPublic \nFreight \nTransport\n\nUsers of \nNon-\nmechaniz\ned Trans-\nport \n\nTransport \nProviders \nand Users \nof Own \nMotor \nVehicles \n\nGov-\nernment \nand Rest \nof the \nEconomy \n\nTotal \nReceived \nby Stake-\nholders \n\nUn-\nskilled \nlabor \n\n \n\n0\n0\n8,943\n3,179\n0\n\n(40,351) \n3,947 \n60,211 \n8,881 \n6,681 \n\n(Net present value in $\u2019000) \n0\n0\n27,239\n0\n0\n\nCapital \nMaintenance \nVOC savings \nPass time savings \nNMT savings \nTotal Net Present \nValue \nShare of net benefits to the poor (%) \nNet Benefits to the Poor \nPoverty Impact Ratio (PIR) \n \nNPV = net present value, NMT = non-mechanized traffic, PIR = poverty impact ratio, VOC = vehicle operating cost. \nSource: ADB. 2002.

The Project is located in the central region and will \naddress economic growth by improving connectivity to rural areas with poor or seasonal access and increase the \nefficiency by which people can move and goods can be traded. Thus, this Project is consistent with the CSP.  \n \nProvincial  roads  form  an  important  link  between  \"lower  level\"  infrastructure  and  \"upper  level\"  national  networks. \nConnectivity is a key factor for enabling the poor to respond to market incentives and participate in economic growth. \nImproved transport infrastructure will contribute to a regionally balanced and equitable economic growth by stimulating \nagricultural production and access to employment opportunities and facilitating access to social services. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                        Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe Project will improve approximately 945 kilometers (km) of roads in the central region. Roads to be upgraded will \nbe a combination of provincial and district roads selected using a network approach for each province.  The project \narea comprises the 19 provinces of the central region of Viet Nam. The project area includes the entire length of the \nflat, flood-prone coastal plain, gently rolling hills near the border with the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic in the \nnorth, and low mountains in the central highland provinces. The predominant economic activity in rural areas is \nagricultural production. Rice predominates in coastal plains, while coffee, tea, and sugar cane are abundant in hilly \nand low mountain areas. The principal mode for the movement of goods and people is by road transport. \nApproximately 50% of provincial roads in the central region are earth or gravel or penetration macadam roads rated in \nbad or poor condition, with many roads closed in the rainy season.  \n \nThe goal of the Project is to remove constraints on economic and social development in rural areas of the central \nregion of Viet Nam caused by inadequate transport infrastructure. The purpose of the Project is to induce more \nefficient, and cost-effective, movement of passengers and goods in rural areas of the central region. Outputs from the \nProject will include all-weather roads connecting selected rural areas and district and provincial centers built, road \nsafety programs implemented, and sustainable road and bridge asset management systems for provincial road \nnetworks established. \n \nThe incidence of poverty in the project provinces ranges from 16% to 53%, against a national average of 29%. The \npopulation served by the Phase 1 networks is approximately 908,000. The project road user survey found that overall \n47.3% of road users in the project area were poor (expenditures between D100,000 and D150,000/per person/month) \nand 16.3% were very poor (expenditures less than D100,000/per person/month) and that both poor and nonpoor were \nheavy road users. The large majority of people living in the project area depend on agriculture for their livelihood. Off-\nfarm employment opportunities are very limited. Local residents, mostly farmers, use the roads for transporting goods \nto market. Over 78% of local road users produced goods for sale, with 77% selling agricultural goods. Approximately \n46% of households selling goods cited high transport costs and unsatisfactory prices offered by middle marketers as \nthe reason for selling goods locally or at nearby markets.  \n \nThe Project's impact on poverty has been quantified by examining the share of total project net benefits that would \naccrue to the poor and to the very poor. The distributional analysis indicates that the project yields a poverty impact \nratio (PIR) of 0.46 and a poverty impact for the very poor of 0.15. The high poverty impact ratio reflects a high \nincidence of poverty among direct beneficiaries and a substantial net transfer of resources from the economy at large \nto the project area. Total net benefits accruing to the poor amount to approximately $18.1 million, of which the very \npoor receive approximately $6.0 million. With a Phase 1 network population of 908,000 and with 47.3% of road users \nbeing poor and 16.3% very poor, the project benefits will accrue to approximately 429,000 poor beneficiaries, of whom \nabout 148,000 are very poor. \n \nAlthough the project will greatly benefit the poor in the project area and is located in a geographical area that was \nidentified in the CSP as focus area for ADB intervention, it cannot be claimed to be specifically targeted since non-\npoor and poor alike have access to the road and will reap identical benefits. The Project is therefore classified as a \ngeneral intervention. \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\n \n\n   No \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\n   Yes               \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nProject field surveys and participatory community consultation as well as a number of key informant interviews and \ninternational studies were used to inform the analysis. In total, 668 local residents, 46 passengers, and 158 vehicle \noperators living in the project area were surveyed.  \n \nThe communities along the project roads, including people from ethnic minorities, welcomed the opportunity to \nexpress their views and stated that they were willing to participate in project preparation and implementation. \nHowever, general knowledge and awareness of government programs and the Project is low. People had heard about \nroad improvement plans and had been promised an improved road for years, so were now discouraged. Overall, \npeople expressed the view that information needs to be widely publicized in a way that most people, particularly those \nfrom ethnic minorities people, would be able to access.  \n \nCommunes in the project area, including those containing people from ethnic minorities, showed unanimous support \nfor improving the roads. According to commune residents, the greatest benefits will be easier movement, increased \nincome sources, and new job opportunities. People also stated it would increase trips to hospitals, schools, and other \nsocial institutions.  Generally, people did expect a decline in transport costs that would benefit them directly through \nlower fares and freight rates.  The overarching benefit anticipated by the communities along the road was expressed \nas an improvement in their quality of life.  \n \nA participation strategy has been prepared for the resettlement plan, ethnic minority development framework, and the \nHIV/AIDS1 awareness and prevention program to ensure that the plans are culturally appropriate and implementable. \nD.  Gender Development \n\nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nWomen accounted for 44.6% of total project survey respondents. Although the overall poverty rate for the project area \nwas 47.3%, 49.5% of women are poor. Similarly, although 16.3% of the population is very poor, 17.4% of women are \nvery poor. Hence, women as a separate group are poorer on average than the overall population in the project area. \nAbout 49% of women identified themselves as farmers and 28% as wage workers but almost all of this work is in \nagriculture. Approximately 33% of women had not completed primary school but this percentage is higher for women \nfrom ethnic minorities. Women mainly contribute to farming activities, frequently market small surplus production, and \nare usually responsible for fetching water and fuel-wood. Reduced travel costs, more available transport, and better \nroads will help improve the lives of women and children. Improved transport will result in increased access to basic \nsocial services (schools, health care facilities, and markets) and increased employment opportunities. It is anticipated \nthat greater road connectivity may have a direct and positive impact on the mostly illiterate girls and women from \nethnic minorities, by promoting their access to adult literacy and training opportunities.  In the project survey, women \nidentified easier movement as the primary benefit to arise from the improvements, followed by new job opportunities \nand increased source of incomes.  \n \nOther concerns are that the Project will increase the potential for the spread of HIV/AIDS and other sexually-\ntransmitted infections (STIs) due to the influx of construction workers and increased communication as a result of the \nroad improvements. An additional risk related to increased roadway connectivity lies in the human trafficking of \nteenage girls and women. These risks will be minimized and mitigated through a gender, HIV and anti-trafficking \nprevention program, to raise awareness and provide preventive measures for local communities (with a special focus \non women from ethnic minorities), construction workers, and the mobile populations. \n \nWomen will benefit from the Project and a specific gender strategy has not been prepared.  Gender equity issues have \nbeen mainstreamed into the resettlement plan, ethnic minority development framework and the HIV/AIDS awareness \nand prevention program. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1   Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome \n\n\fE.

The  road \nimprovement  will  entail  the  acquisition  of  6  hectares  (ha) \nof  land.  It  will  also  partially  affect  three  house/shops  and \npermanently  affect  27  structures  (fences  and  toilets).  An \nestimated  5,300  trees,  1,800  meters  (m)  of  plant  fences, \n53  ha  of  crops,  and  630  m2  of  fishpond  will  also  be \naffected by the Project. \nThe  Project  will  reduce  transport  costs  for  the  poor \nthrough savings in vehicle operating costs (VOCs). These \nwill be passed on to the poor through lower freight rates, \nlower  passenger \ntime  savings,  making \ntransportation  more  affordable.  Both  the  passenger  and \nis  highly \nin \nfreight  shipping  market \ncompetitive,  meaning  that  competition  should  force  lower \nrates when the roads are improved and vehicle operating \ncosts decline. \nThere are no significant labor issues but one of the \nobjectives is to maximize benefit generation for people \nfrom local communities, especially the poor, women and \npeople from ethnic minorities by ensuring that all \napplicable labor laws and regulations are adhered to by all \nroad contractors and that local employment is promoted to \nthe fullest. This does not require a specific plan but the \nfollowing provisions will be built into relevant documents \nand will be monitored under the project\u2019s general \nmonitoring program. \n \nContracts will specifically refer to maximizing the use of \nlocal labor, require that legal wages be paid to workers, \nprohibit use of child labor for construction and \nmaintenance, and ensure there is differential between the \nwages paid to men and women for work of equal value. A \nspecific clause will be placed in bidding documents to \nnote that that compliance will be strictly monitored during \nproject implementation. \n\nthe  networks \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n60 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n \n \nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \nOther Risks \nand/or \nVulnerabilities \n \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n \n\n \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\nFive of the nine networks that make up the Phase 1 and 2 \nareas have ethnic minority groups living in the communes \nalong the roads.  In total, there are 55,000 people from \nethnic minorities living in 27 communes within these five \nnetworks.  Eight distinct ethnic minority groups have been \nidentified along these project roads (Cham, Co ho, Dao, \nEde, Rag Lai, Tay, Thuong, and Hoa).  \n \nThe overall initial social assessment concluded that \nimpacts on ethnic minorities for Phase 1 and 2 road \nnetworks are limited and that the issue with the most \nsignificant potential for negative impacts is land \nacquisition and resettlement. The potential for exploitation \nof people from ethnic minorities is not high but may still \nincrease with more contact with mainstream populations \nbrought about due to road improvement. \n \nAn  ethnic  minority  development  framework  (EMDF)  has \nbeen  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Policy  on \nIndigenous  Peoples  (1999)  and  Operations  Manual \nSection  F3/BP,  May  2004,  and  policies  and  programs  of \nthe  Government  of  Viet  Nam  and  will  guide \nthe \npreparation  of  ethnic  minority  specific  actions  (EMSAs) \nand ethnic minorities development plans (EMDP). Hence, \nEMSAs have been incorporated in the RP specifically for \nLam  province.  For  Phase  3 \nthe \npreparation  of  EMSA  or  stand-alone  EMDPs  will  only  be \nknown  during  loan  implementation.  The  budget  for  the \ndevelopment of EMDPs has been estimated at $500,000. \nIncreased Exposure to Communicable Diseases \nThere is a risk of increasing the infection rate of HIV/AIDS \nduring the construction stage. It is not anticipated that \nsignificant increases in truck traffic flows will occur in the \nshort term. However, there is a risk that their lack of \nawareness of HIV/AIDS may make people from ethnic \nminorities exceptionally vulnerable. Hence, project \nimplementation will include an HIV/AIDS awareness \nprogram and special measures will be taken to ensure \ninformation is delivered in a way that is accessible to \nethnic minorities. The cost of the HIV/AIDS awareness \ncampaign is estimated to be $500,000.  \n \nRoad Safety \nLocal residents were concerned about an increase in road \naccidents because of increased vehicle speeds.  Concern \nwas expressed by both women and men about the risk to \ntheir  children \nthe  roads. \nRoadside improvements  will  need to incorporate  wayside \nto  road \namenities. \nshoulders \nfor  pedestrians  and \nnonmotorized  traffic.  To  incorporate  other  improvements \nto  road  safety  the  design  will  include  signs  and  speed \nbreaks  near  schools,  hospitals  and  areas  with  many \npedestrians such as towns and markets. \n\nImprovements  will  be  needed \n\nto  school  along \n\nroad  networks, \n\nimprove  safety \n\ntraveling \n\n \nto \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 30 September 2005) \n", "Currency Unit\n", "\u2013 \n", "dong (D) \n", "D1.00\n$1.00\n", "= \n$0.0001  \n=  D15,895 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "AASHTO \n", "ADB \nAP \nBCC \nCEMMA \nCPC \nCPRGS \nCRTNP \n", "CSP \nDBST \nDFID \n", "DMS \nDONRE \nEIRR \nEMDP \nEMP \nEMSA \nGOV \nHCMC \nHIV/AIDS \n", "IDC \nIEC \nIEE \nJBIC \nLCB \nMOT \nMRM \nNGO \nNH \nNTSC \nOECF \nPDOT \nPIR \nPMU-1 \nPPC \nPPMU \nPPTA \nPRC \n", "\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "American Association of State Highway and \nTransportation Officials \nAsian Development Bank \naffected people \nbehavior, communication, and change \nCommittee for Ethnic Minorities and Mountainous Areas \nCommune People\u2019s Committee \ncomprehensive poverty reduction and growth strategy \nCentral Region Transport Networks Improvement Sector \nProject \nCountry Strategy and Program \ndouble bituminous surface treatment \nDepartment for International Development of the United \nKingdom \ndetailed measurement survey \nDepartment of Natural Resources and Environment \neconomic internal rate of return \nethnic minority development plan \nenvironmental management plan \nethnic minority specific actions \nGovernment of Viet Nam \nHo Chi Minh City \nhuman immunodeficiency virus/acquired \nimmunodeficiency syndrome \ninterest during construction \ninformation, education and communication \ninitial environmental examination \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation \nlocal competitive bidding \nMinistry of Transport \nManagement Review Meeting \nnongovernment organization \nnational highway \nNational Traffic Safety Committee \nOverseas Economic Cooperation Fund \nprovincial department of transport \npoverty impact ratio \nProject Management Unit No 1 \nProvincial People\u2019s Committees \nprovincial project management units \nproject preparatory technical assistance \nProvincial Resettlement Committees \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "PRIP \nPRSDP \nPTSC \nRMIS \nRNIP \nRPF \nRRMU \nRT1 \nRT2 \nRT3 \nSGIA \nSOE \nSTI \nVBARD \nVLSS \nVRA \nZOI \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Provincial Road Improvement Project \nprovincial road sector development plan \nProvincial Traffic Safety Committee \nRoad Management Information Systems \nRoad Network Improvement Project \nresettlement policy framework \nroad maintenance and management unit \nRural Transport 1 Project \nRural Transport 2 Project  \nRural Transport 3 Project \nSecond Generation Imprest Accounts \nstate-owned enterprise \nsexually transmitted infections \nViet Nam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development \nViet Nam Living Standards Survey \nViet Nam Road Administration \nzone of influence \n", "NOTE \n", "In this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars. \n", "This report was prepared by a team consisting of P.
