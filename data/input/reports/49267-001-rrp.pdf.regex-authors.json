I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed equity \ninvestment of up to $20,000,000 in the VI (Vietnam Investments) Fund III, L.P. \n \nII.  THE FUND \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n2.  Description. VI (Vietnam Investments) Fund III, L.P., a limited partnership registered in \nthe Cayman Islands, is a closed-end private equity fund with a target capitalization of $250 \nmillion. The general partner will be VI (Vietnam Investments) Management, LLC, a company also \nregistered in the Cayman Islands.  \n \n3.  The general partner will enter into an agreement with VI Advisory Company Limited to \nprovide investment and portfolio management services. The general partner will establish an \nadvisory committee comprising representatives of the limited partners selected by the general \npartner. The advisory committee will provide advice and counsel as requested by the general \npartner in connection with approving waivers on certain investment guideline limits, potential \nconflicts of interest, and other fund matters. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) expects to \nhave the right to appoint a member to the advisory committee. \n \n4.  Investment  identification.  Capital  markets  in  Cambodia,  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic \nRepublic (Lao PDR), Myanmar, and Viet Nam are considered small and underdeveloped in \ncomparison to their peers. The lack of available and affordable capital is limiting the growth of \nmiddle-market companies and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Viet Nam\u2019s stock \nmarket is the largest of these four countries, but is still considered highly illiquid; it has a market \ncapitalization of only 26.8% of gross domestic product, compared with the global average of \n98.7%.1 This is significantly below the ratio in India (73%), People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \n(75%), and the Philippines (82%). Private equity investors began to show interest in Cambodia, \nLao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam in the early 2000s. However, typical transactions are small \nand often accompanied by higher risks (commercial, foreign exchange, political, and regulatory) \ncompared with some of the larger, more mainstream markets in Asia. For these reasons, most \nprivate equity investors remain hesitant to invest in these four countries. \n \n5.  To alleviate the shortage of capital and encourage private sector foreign investment, ADB \nconducted extensive market mapping of private equity funds in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, \nand Viet Nam. Vietnam Investments Group (VIG) is one of the few experienced private equity \nfund  managers  with  a  large  dedicated  local  team  focused  on  investing  in  middle-market \ncompanies and SMEs in Viet Nam.2 VIG was founded in 2006 and has invested in more than 30 \nmiddle-market  companies  and  SMEs  across  multiple  industries.  Most  of  these  portfolio \ncompanies  have  performed  well  with  positive  revenue  growth  and  job  creation  since  VIG \ninvested. By participating in the fund, ADB would seek to achieve two goals. First, backing one of \nthe most promising private equity firms in the region would aim to demonstrate that larger scale \nprivate  equity  investment  in  these  four  Southeast  Asian  countries  is  viable.  Increased \ninvolvement in these countries by larger investors would help to increase commercial capital in \n                                                \n1  World Bank.

", "2 \nthe  region,  and  possibly  improve  corporate  governance  and  perceptions  of  the  investment \nenvironment and business stability. Second, the fund aims to provide financing to middle-market \ncompanies  and  SMEs, which  is  associated  with  a range  of  development  benefits  including \naccess and integration into local, national, and global markets; increased economic growth; and \nemployment.3 These economies are relatively small and underdeveloped, and ADB\u2019s support \nremains essential in helping them to reach parity in terms of economic development with its \nAsian peers.  \n \n6.  In addition to producing attractive development impacts, Vietnam Investments Group is \nlikely  to  benefit  ADB  by  generating  co-investment  opportunities  in  underserved  markets.  In \nFebruary 2015, ADB initiated a dialogue with VIG and confirmed its alignment with ADB\u2019s core \nsectors and development strategy. ADB has since performed detailed due diligence on the \ngeneral partner and its previous two funds. \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n7.  The fund aims to make equity and equity-linked investments in middle-market companies \nand SMEs primarily in Viet Nam; it also envisages such investments in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and \nMyanmar. \n \n The  fund  will  concentrate  on  several  key  segments:  (i)  health  care,  (ii)  education,  (iii) \nmanufacturing and distribution of fast-moving consumer goods, (iv) retail, and (v) transportation \nand logistics.4 The fund aims to provide primarily growth capital and technical expertise to fast \ngrowing middle-market companies and SMEs with the potential to gain or consolidate significant \nmarket share in their respective industries.5 This is expected to result in accelerated job creation; \nincreased  regional  trade;  and  improved  standards  of  environmental,  social,  and  corporate \ngovernance. Investee companies will also benefit from the strategic and operational guidance of \nthe fund manager, who benefits from its partners\u2019 compelling mix of local and international \nbusiness development experience and access to a wide network of business contacts. \n \n8.  The fund manager proposes to target 10\u201312 equity investments over a 5-year investment \nperiod with an average deal size of about $25 million.6 The fund aims to acquire either large \nminority or controlling stakes in investee companies whenever possible to leverage the fund \nmanagement team\u2019s experience in adding value to such companies.7 \n \n9.  VIG is one of Viet Nam\u2019s top performing private equity fund managers. Its team of local \ninvestment professionals and support staff originate transactions, perform due diligence, and \nstructure  transactions.  VIG  has  gained  experience  working  with  private  and  state-owned \nbusinesses, developing a strong business network in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet \nNam that enable it to source transactions through referrals rather than through competitive \nbidding processes.  \n \n                                                \n3  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. 2004.

", "3 \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n10.  Ownership. The Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax \nPurposes has categorized the Cayman Islands as largely compliant with internationally agreed \ntax standards.8 ADB\u2019s due diligence indicates the fund has not been established and is not being \nused  for  cross-border  tax  evasion,  money  laundering,  or  terrorism  financing  in  relevant \njurisdictions.9 \n \n11.  Management. The fund will be managed by the general partner. VIG was founded in \n2006, raised its first fund in 2008, and a second in 2012.  The investment committee makes final \ndecisions regarding the investment process.  \n \n12.  The  fund\u2019s  management  team  also  includes  one  operating  partner  (for  legal  and \ngovernment  relations),  and  three  senior  investment  officers.  The  broader  investment  team \ncomprises  more  than  15  investment  professionals  and  more  than  10  support  positions \n(information technology, finance, human resources, and legal). The team members help portfolio \ncompanies develop and implement strategies to improve growth and profitability. \n \n13.  General partner contribution. The general partner\u2019s contribution was financed by VIG\u2019s \ntwo founders, which provides a strong alignment of interests between the general partners and \nthe limited partners. \n \n14.  Investment process. The general partner typically conducts a three-stage investment \nprocess: (i) investment screening of each potential portfolio company\u2019s operations, products, \nmarket opportunities, and valuation against the fund\u2019s mandate and strategy; (ii) deal structuring \nand due diligence; and (iii) preparation of investment proposals for presentation to the fund\u2019s \ninvestment committee. The general partner will enter into an investment portfolio management \nservices agreement with VI Advisory Company Limited, a Vietnamese company, to provide \nadministrative support in connection with the fund, subject to monitoring by the general partner. \n \n15.  Selected  investment  professionals  of  the  general  partner  are  responsible  for  deal \norigination through financial intermediaries, industry networks, or market scanning. Once a deal \nis identified as an opportunity, a team of at least three investment professionals is formed to \nconduct a preliminary assessment of the market and the target company, and to prepare a draft \ninvestment  memorandum  for  the  directors  of  the  fund.  While  assessing  the  investment \nopportunity, the deal team regularly updates the broader investment group informally and during \nthe bimonthly staff meetings, which enables the deal team to draw on the collective experience \nand knowledge of VIG\u2019s investment professionals.  \n \n16.  Once approved by the directors, the general partner prepares an initial term sheet and \ncompletes full due diligence and detailed valuation of the opportunity. The final investment \nmemorandum is then presented to the investment committee. Once approved by the investment \ncommittee, a definitive agreement is executed by the general partner and the target company, \nwhich is followed by the completion of other formalities and the funding process. \n \n \n                                                \n8  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n17.  ADB will provide an equity investment of up to $20,000,000 (but not more than 10% of \nthe total committed capital and provided that ADB shall not be the single largest investor) in VI \n(Vietnam Investments) Fund III, L.P. \n \nB.  Financial Analysis of Expected Returns and Assumptions \n18.  The general partner has indicated that it aims to achieve a target gross IRR for the fund \nof at least 8%. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  Exit strategy. The fund has a 10-year term from initial closing, extendable by two 1-year \nterms. The fund\u2019s exit strategies for the underlying portfolio companies include (i) sale to a \nstrategic buyer, (ii) sale to a financial buyer, and (iii) initial public offerings. A sale to a strategic \nbuyer will involve finding global strategic investors keen to expand their presence in high-growth \nemerging economies. Potential financial buyers may include existing shareholders. Initial public \nofferings are also envisioned to provide liquidity for the fund\u2019s minority investment positions \nwhere  the  sponsors  plan  to  remain  invested  for  the  long  term.  Additionally,  VIG  seeks  to \nstructure downside protection in investments where they own a minority interest.  \n \n20.  Reporting arrangements. The general partner will be required to provide ADB with (i) \nquarterly unaudited reports; and (ii) audited annual reports with financial statements, a fund \noverview,  an  annual  development  effectiveness  monitoring  report,  and  an  overview  of  the \nportfolio with summary information on each portfolio company\u2019s performance and valuation. ADB \nwill  review  this  information  and  follow  up  with  the  general  partner  if  more  information  or \nclarification is needed. If the information received from the general partner raises issues that \ncould impair the value of ADB\u2019s investment in the fund, ADB could decide to put the fund on a \nwatch list for more frequent and detailed review. \n \n21.  The general partner will be required to adopt an environmental and social management \nsystem (ESMS) acceptable to ADB before the first disbursement, and to report annually on \nenvironmental and social safeguard issues. ADB will monitor the timing and quality of the ESMS \nreports  and  offer  guidance  if  the  general  partner  requires  clarification  of  ADB\u2019s  safeguard \nrequirements. \n \nD.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n22.  Catalyze  private  sector  investment.  Private  equity  funds  in  Cambodia,  Lao  PDR, \nMyanmar, and Viet Nam typically struggle to raise capital, particularly from foreign investors, \nbecause  of  high  perceived  risks  (commercial,  foreign  exchange,  political,  and  regulatory). \nAccording to Preqin, 2,215 private equity funds globally are currently raising $761 billion. Of \nthese, 367 are Asia-focused funds looking to raise $102 billion. However, only four are focused \non Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam, seeking to raise $575 million (0.08% of global \nfundraising and 0.6% of Asia fundraising).10 Three of the four funds are Viet Nam-focused funds \n                                                \n10 Preqin.

With only a handful of private equity funds operating in these four Southeast Asian \ncountries, their private equity landscape is behind their peers. ADB\u2019s participation in the fund is \nexpected to send a positive market signal and highlight the capital needs of privately owned \nmiddle-market companies and SMEs in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam. It is also \nexpected to improve governance, transparency, and accountability in the private equity asset \nclass and to encourage participation from institutional investors. \n \n23.  Raise  standards.  In  addition  to  increasing  market  liquidity,  ADB  is  expected  to \nencourage the general partner to ensure that its investee companies comply with the highest \nenvironment and social safeguards, and to report on development indicators. ADB\u2019s role, along \nwith other members of the fund\u2019s advisory committee, will be to assist in providing oversight on \ngovernance matters such as those relating to conflicts of interest, valuation and other important \nfund matters. \n \nE.

DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n29.  Impact.  The  investment  is  expected  to  sustain  the  development  of  capital  markets \nthrough private equity investments. It will improve liquidity and demonstrate that private equity \ninvestment is viable for larger and institutional investors. In addition, the investment will enhance \njob creation in middle-market companies and SMEs because of a viable capital market.  \n \n30.  Outcome. The outcome of the investment is the fund contributing to the financing of \nmiddle-market companies and SMEs in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam.  \n \n31.  Outputs. The output will be the establishment of VI (Vietnam Investments) Fund III, L.P., \nand its capital invested. ADB\u2019s participation in the fund will support one of the region\u2019s leading \nprivate equity platforms and assist the fund in reaching its target size of $250 million. The fund\u2019s \ncommitted capital will likely be invested in 10\u201312 portfolio companies.  \n \n ", "6 \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n32.  Consistency with ADB strategy. The proposed investment is consistent with ADB\u2019s \nMidterm Review of Strategy 2020, which seeks to promote inclusive growth and sustainability.11 \nBuilding capacity, improving investor confidence, and deepening local capital markets are critical \nmacro-level improvements that can stimulate broad-based economic development, particularly \nfor emerging economies affected by instability.  \n \n33.   Consistency with country strategy. The proposed investment aims to make equity and \nequity-linked investments, primarily in middle-market companies and SMEs in Viet Nam (para 7). \nIn line with ADB\u2019s Interim Country Partnership Strategy, 2016, this investment contributes to two \nof  the  three  development  objectives  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  10-year  Socio-Economic  Development \nStrategy, 2011\u20132020. First, the investment will help develop high-quality human resources. The \nfund\u2019s pool of investment professionals\u2014with a mixture of overseas and local experience\u2014and \nthe standards of governance to be imposed on investee companies will help to achieve this \nobjective.  Second,  the  investment  will  help  construct  comprehensive  infrastructure  systems. \nWhile the fund is not involved in traditional large infrastructure projects, its objectives are aligned \nwith  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam's  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan,  2016\u20132020,  and \ncontributes to three of its four objectives: (i) strengthening the market economy; (ii) creating a \nconducive  environment  for  private  sector  development  and  better  service  delivery;  and  (iii) \nadopting a balanced, sustainable, and inclusive growth model. By promoting inclusive economic \ngrowth, supporting social development, and mobilizing private sector capital, the investment is \nalso consistent with the country partnership strategies of Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar.12 \n \n34.  Consistency with sector strategy. The proposed investment is consistent with ADB's \nrevised private equity fund investment guidelines.13 The fund\u2019s investment goals align with ADB\u2019s \nstrategies for improving capital markets, encouraging development of private sector middle-\nmarket companies and SMEs, removing barriers to financing for middle-market companies and \nSMEs, and promoting social and inclusive growth.14  \n \nV.
