The \nsummary EIA was circulated to the Board on 7 July 2004. \n   \nProject Description  The Project, a key urban infrastructure initiative of the Fuzhou \nmunicipal government (FMG), aims to improve the environmental \nquality  and  living  conditions  by  reducing  water  pollution  and \nprotecting water resources. The Project has three infrastructure \ncomponents: (i) expansion of the Yangli sewer networks serving \nthe eastern part of Fuzhou, (ii) construction of the Lianban sewer \nnetworks on Nantai Island on the southern part of Fuzhou, and (iii) \nrehabilitation of 13 inland creeks for pollution control and flood \nprotection on Nantai Island. A capacity building component will \nprovide  training  on  project  management,  institutional  and \nwastewater  management,  and  private  sector  participation  in \nmunicipal services. \n   \nRationale  Fuzhou,  the  capital  of  Fujian  Province,  is  a  major  cultural, \ncommercial, and industrial center in the Min River delta. The Min \nRiver, an important waterway that passes through the urban heart \nof Fuzhou, is a water source for drinking, irrigation, and industrial \nprocessing. Pollution in local streams and in the Min River due to \nrapid economic growth and urbanization is a serious problem, and \nthe cumulative effect of the numerous point and non-point sources \nof discharge. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has helped \nFuzhou address the severe water pollution problems by financing \na  successful  wastewater  treatment  project.  However,  the \nwastewater  treatment  facilities  are  insufficient  to  meet  the \nincreasing wastewater generation associated with rapid economic \ngrowth. \n \n  In addition, unchecked pollution of the Nantai Island waterways \nhas hindered the planned urban development envisaged in the \nFuzhou Urban Master Plan (1995\u20132010). The Project will continue \nto support FMG\u2019s effort to control water pollution, and to improve \nthe environment and living conditions of the expanding Fuzhou \nmunicipality. It also will assist the Government\u2019s efforts to promote \npublic private partnerships in the development of public utilities. ", "iv   \nObjective  The Project will improve the urban environment of Fuzhou by \nconstructing and rehabilitating sewer networks, rehabilitating the \nsystem of inland creeks, and strengthening governance in water \nresource management. Specifically, the Project will (i) construct \nabout 264 kilometers (km) of sewers and rehabilitate 35 km of \nexisting  sewers;  and  (ii)  improve  the  water  quality  to  achieve \ntargeted standards in the inland creeks and the Min River, in a \nmanner that supports integrated water resources management. \n   \nCost Estimates  The Project cost is $185.50 million equivalent, including a foreign \nexchange  cost  of  $73.38  million  and  local  currency  cost  of \n$112.12 million. \n   \nFinancing Plan    Foreign  Local  Total   \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost  % \nADB Loan  55.80     55.80  30.0 \n            \nCommercial Cofinancing        0.00       27.19     27.19    15.0   \nCounterpart Funds      17.58       84.93     102.51    55.0 \n           \n  Total  73.38   112.12  185.50  100.0 \n \n \n  ADB = Asian Development Bank. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $55.80 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will \nbe provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The loan will be for 25 years, including a \ngrace  period  of  5  years,  with  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per year, and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The proceeds of ADB\u2019s loan to the PRC will be made available to \nTerms  the  Fujian  provincial  government  (FPG),  which  will  make  it \navailable to FMG on the same terms as those of the ADB loan. \nFMG  will  onlend  the  loan  proceeds,  on  the  same  terms  and \nconditions  as  the  ADB  loan,  to  the  implementing  agencies: \nFuzhou  Water  Environment  Construction  and  Development \nCompany (FWECDC), formerly known as the Yangli Wastewater \nTreatment Plant Construction Company; and to the Fuzhou Urban \nVisual  Construction  and  Development  Company  (FUVCDC). \nFWECDC and FUVCDC will assume the foreign exchange and \ninterest rate variation risks for the ADB loan, and reimburse FPG \nand FMG for any transaction costs. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2010 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2009 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  FMG ", "  v\nImplementation  FMG has formed a project leading group (PLG), chaired by a \nArrangements  deputy mayor. The PLG will meet periodically to provide policy \nguidance,  facilitate  interagency  coordination,  and  resolve  any \ninstitutional problems affecting project implementation. The project \nmanagement office (PMO) that FMG set up to manage the first \nADB project will continue to serve as the secretariat of the PLG. \nFWECDC will be responsible for the implementation of the sewer \nnetworks components, while FUVCDC will be responsible for the \ninland  creek  rehabilitation  component.  In  consultation  with  the \nPMO,  FWECDC  and  FUVCDC  will  implement  their  respective \nportions of the capacity building component. \n   \nProcurement  ADB-financed goods and services will be procured in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Major  contracts  for \nequipment and materials will be tendered through international \ncompetitive bidding or international shopping, depending on the \nvalue of the contract. \n   \nConsulting Services  About 30 person-months of international consulting services and \n120 person-months of domestic consulting services will be funded \nby  the  loan  to  support  the  PMO,  FWECDC,  and  FUVCDC  in \nproject implementation and capacity building. The consultants will \nbe recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants, and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement of domestic consultants. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will support environmentally sustainable development \nBeneficiaries  in Fuzhou and benefit 1.85 million residents. New and expanded \nwastewater collection and treatment facilities, rehabilitated creeks \nand improved water quality and flood control management will \nimprove living conditions and public health standards. Indirectly, \nmuch of the population of Fuzhou will benefit from improved water \nquality and environmental conditions, increased access to safe \ndrinking water, and reduced incidence of water-borne diseases. \nThis environmental improvement will encourage the creation of \ncivic  amenities,  stimulate  economic  activity,  and  enhance  the \nimage of Fuzhou as a cultural, commercial, and industrial hub. \nThe Project also will help the Government achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goal (MDG) of environmental sustainability (MDG \n7). \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Potential  risks  related  to  the  Project  include  (i)  a  delay  in \nconstruction of the two wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) for \nthe sewer networks; and (ii) a failure to implement, in parallel with \nthe  Project,  pumping  stations  to  augment  flow  to  the  inland \ncreeks. These risks has been addressed through synchronization \nmeasures.  Experienced  consultants  will  prepare  designs  and \nmonitor implementation, mitigating any specific construction risks. \n \n ", "", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Fuzhou Environmental Improvement Project \n(the Project). \n \n2.  The  Government  asked  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  help  improve  the \nenvironmental quality of its cities, which continue to expand as the economy grows rapidly. The \nProject is in Fuzhou, the capital of Fujian Province, one of the PRC\u2019s high-growth provinces and \nmost active proponents of environment protection. The Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Water \nPolicy, and will help the PRC achieve the Millennium Development Goals of environmental \nsustainability and increased access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. This report is \nbased on the findings of the loan Appraisal Mission and discussions with the central and local \ngovernments, relevant agencies, and community organizations. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.   \n \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n3.  Since the PRC initiated economic reforms in 1978, rapid urbanization has accompanied \nsignificant economic progress. The urban population has grown from about 190 million in 1980 \nto more than 524 million in 2003, and now accounts for about 40% of the total population. The \nGovernment\u2019s Agenda for Economic Reform and Social Development in the New Century aims \nto accelerate urbanization and the development of large, medium, and small cities as well as \nsmall towns. The urban population is expected to reach 700 million, half of the total population, \nin 2030.1 Increasing urban population, industrialization, and economic development are putting \npressure on an overloaded urban infrastructure, and contributing to widespread pollution and \nenvironmental threats in the PRC\u2019s cities. The rising demand for basic municipal services is \noutstripping  the  financial  and  physical  capacity  of  most  urban  centers.  The  environmental \nthreats facing the PRC\u2019s urban areas include the pollution of creeks, lakes, and underground \naquifers from untreated water. \n \n4.  In 2003, municipal sources generated 65% of the country\u2019s estimated 46 billion cubic \nmeters  (m3)  of  wastewater,  while  industrial  sources  generated  35%  of  the  total.2  As  the \ndevelopment of municipal wastewater treatment is still in the early stages, only 40% is treated. \nThe  rest  is  discharged  untreated  into  rivers  and  lakes.  Although  about  90%  of  industrial \nwastewater is treated, much of it is only pretreated to a low effluent standard before discharge \ninto a municipal sewer. In the absence of a centralized municipal wastewater treatment plant \n(WWTP), a mixture of raw municipal wastewater and partially treated industrial wastewater is \ndischarged from the municipal sewer to the nearest body of water.  \n \n5.  Municipal wastewater is a major contributor to pollution of the PRC\u2019s rivers and lakes, \nwith the water-deficient northern region of the country the most severely impacted. In regional \nand administratively higher-level cities, only 30% of the rivers meet their designated water \n                                                 \n1  The Government\u2019s long-term vision for development was set out during the 16th Party Congress in November 2002, \nand reiterated during the 10th National People\u2019s Congress in March 2003. \n2   Municipal wastewater includes residential, commercial, and institutional.  ", "2 \nquality standards3\u2014half the Government objective of 60% in the Tenth Five-Year Plan (2001\u2013\n2005). In seven major river basins,4 52% of river courses do not meet the Class III standard. \nEutrophication is occurring in three priority freshwater lakes.5  Surface-water sources serving \nmunicipal water supply systems are polluted to levels unacceptable by water quality standards. \n \n6.  Recognizing that adequate environmental protection and pollution controls are essential \nfor sustainable economic growth, the Government has incorporated environmental protection as \nnational priority into its development strategy. The Government has enacted environmental \nprotection laws and implementing regulations that emphasize preventive measures, the polluter \npays principle, and decentralized environmental management. In addition, the Government has \nundertaken numerous programs, including those for wastewater management.6 Industries were \nordered to treat wastewater to acceptable standards by the end of 2000. Under successive 5-\nyear  plans,  municipalities  were  required  to  address  wastewater  collection,  treatment,  and \ndisposal. Pollution control plans also were developed and partially implemented for the key \nwater basins. The Tenth Five-Year Plan stipulates that regional and administratively higher-level \ncities have to treat 45% of municipal wastewater, while cities discharging more than 500,000 \nm3/day have to treat 60%. National guidelines further require that major cities, such as provincial \ncapitals, achieve a wastewater treatment rate of 70% by 2010.7 The treatment level required \ndepends on the water quality class of the receiving water. To achieve water quality Class I, II, or \nIII, secondary wastewater treatment normally would be required. \n \n7.  However, the Government is concerned that the water pollution control targets of the \nTenth Five-Year Plan might not be achieved due to (i) inadequate investment, (ii) the failure to \nphase  out  outdated  technology  and  polluting  companies,  and  (iii)  weak  monitoring  and \nenforcement  in  some  localities.  To  address  this  concern,  the  Government  has  made  the \nprevention  of  urban  environmental  degradation  a  high  priority,  and  has  been  seeking  the \ncooperation of provincial and local governments to speed up the implementation of wastewater \ntreatment projects. Financing the huge infrastructure needs requires appropriate instruments \nand  incentives  for  channeling  a  larger  share  of  domestic  savings  into  the  sector,  and  for \nattracting private sector capital. To this end, the Government is (i) developing domestic capital \nmarkets, (ii) promoting the use of foreign capital, (iii) introducing price reforms and user fees, \n(iv) creating a legal and policy framework to attract private sector participation (PSP), and (v) \nstrengthening the ability of local governments to raise funds for infrastructure development. \nFujian, a fast-developing province in the eastern region, has responded to this challenge. It has \nbecome one of the most active proponents of urban environment improvement in the country. \n \n8.  Fuzhou, the provincial capital of Fujian, is a major commercial, industrial, and financial \ncenter and one of PRC\u2019s high-growth cities. Economic growth in Fuzhou has averaged about \n                                                 \n3   The PRC Environmental Quality Standards have five classes for surface water quality based on their use. Class I is \nfor water resources and nationally protected bodies of water. Class II is for high-value fish production areas, class \nA protection areas, and spawning habitats for fish. Class III is for potable water resources, class B protection areas, \ngeneral fish protection areas, and swimming areas. Class IV is for general industrial water sources and non-contact \nrecreation areas. Class I water sources are the best in quality and Class V are the worst. \n4  Changjiang, Haihe, Huaihe, Liaohe (Yangtze River), Huanghe, Songhuajiang and Zhujiang (Yellow River). \n5   Dianchi, Chaohu and Taihu. \n6  The Law of the PRC on Prevention and Control of Water Pollution was adopted in 1984 and amended in 1996. The \nlaw aimed to prevent and control water pollution, protect and improve the environment, safeguard human health, \nand ensure effective use of water resources. The law also establishes the standards for water environment quality \nand for discharge of  water pollutants; and  enumerates the  planning, supervision, and management of the \nprevention and control of water pollution. \n7  Ministry of Construction. 2000. Publication of Urban Wastewater Treatment and Control Technology Advice. \nBeijing, PRC. ", "3 \n16% annually over the past decade. The urban population has increased from 1.06 million in \n1980  to  1.858  million  in  2003.  This  has  created  serious  shortfalls  in the  service  of  urban \ninfrastructure, especially in wastewater treatment. In 2001, wastewater discharge was about \n632,700 m3/day, of which 25% was from industrial sources. The water quality in urban creeks \nand  rivers  deteriorated  significantly  due  to  the  large  quantity  of  untreated  wastewater \ndischarged into receiving water bodies. Most of the creeks have been polluted by organic, \nnitrogen,  and  phosphorus  wastes.  Inadequate  wastewater  management  and  protection  of \ndrinking water resources result in poor public health, unclean urban living environments, risk to \ndrinking water supplies, and slower economic development.  \n \n9.  The Fuzhou Urban Master Plan (FUMP: 1995\u20132010) is the blueprint for the physical, \neconomic, and social development of Fuzhou. To meet the environmental objectives, the FUMP \nhas underscored the need to construct municipal wastewater facilities to control wastewater \ndischarges. Fuzhou is served by two WWTPs: the Xiangban WWTP, with a capacity of 50,000 \nm3/day; and the ADB-funded Yangli WWTP Phase 1, with a capacity of 200,000 m3/day.9 As \nthese two WWTPs can treat only about half of the wastewater generated, additional treatment \ncapacity and expanded sewer networks are needed to meet the growing demand. Under the \nproposed Project, the Yangli Phase 2 Sewer Networks will expand the service coverage for the \nYangli Phase 1 from 60% to 90% of the population, resulting in a more comprehensive sewer \nsystem under the FUMP. The Yangli WWTP Phase 2, which will increase capacity by 100,000 \nm3/day,  will  be  constructed  using  municipal  funds.  To  rectify  a  similar  deficiency  in  the \nwastewater system on Nantai Island, a main focus of future urban development, the Fuzhou \nmunicipal government (FMG) will construct the Lianban Sewer Network to connect with the \nproposed Lianban WWTP, which is to be constructed with PSP. With an initial capacity of \n150,000 m3/day, the proposed Lianban WWTP will complement the Jinshan WWTP, which was \nconstructed recently using the build-operate-transfer (BOT) modality. FMG seeks to treat 65% \nof wastewater and provide 80% sewer service coverage by 2009. By 2010, a 70% treatment \nrate is envisaged. The plan\u2019s water quality target is Class III for Min River and at least Class V \nfor the other inland creeks. Under Fujian provincial government (FPG) and FMG policy, sources \nof financing for the construction of all new WWTPs are to be diversified. \n \n10.  The FUMP also seeks to clean up and rehabilitate the inland creek system on Nantai \nIsland, which will become a high-tech park, business center, residential area, and tourism spot. \nThe Lianban Sewer Network will provide central Nantai Island with the required wastewater \nservice system, and ensure that the rehabilitated creeks achieve their environmental protection \ntarget and water quality standards. The natural inland waterways on Nantai Island were formed \nwhen storm runoff scoured fluvial deposits, resulting in a maze of small drainage channels. This \nfragmented drainage system is ineffective. Storm water runoff causes widespread flooding, and \nthe water in the creeks is polluted with untreated wastewater. The Lianban Sewer Network will \nbe  constructed  in  coordination  with  the  rehabilitation  of  the  creeks  to  ensure  that  the \nenvironment of Nantai Island is improved. Interceptors will be constructed parallel to the creeks \nto convey wastewater to the WWTPs, and to ensure water quality will be maintained when the \nrehabilitation is completed.  \n \n \n                                                 \n8   Including a floating population of about 300,000. \n9  ADB. 1998.Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for the Fuzhou Water Supply and Wastewater Treatment Project.

Wastewater management in the PRC provides numerous opportunities to reduce water \npollution, protect water resources, promote sustainable economic development, promote public-\nprivate partnerships in urban infrastructure, and improve the living conditions and public health \nof  urban  residents,  including  the  poor.  The  Government  needs  assistance  to  achieve  the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) for environmental sustainability (MDG 7), and to half \nthe proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation \nby 2015 (MDG 10 and 11).10 \n \n12.  In the PRC\u2019s centrally planned economy, the Government was the sole provider of urban \nservices. Wastewater management was based on septic tanks and designated open drainage \nditches with no treatment. Tax revenue funded services, while consumers paid minimal or no \ncharges. Over the past decade, the Government has shifted fundamentally towards a market-\nbased approach, enterprise provision in the delivery of infrastructure services, and a more \nintegrated  approach  to  urban  management.  The  PRC  policies  incorporate  the  need  for \ncomplementary reforms to support investment, particularly from the private sector, in urban \ninfrastructure. Improvements in service delivery through investment in wastewater systems are \nincreasingly being matched by financial, governance, and enterprise reform; public education; \nawareness; and social responsibility. Although much progress has been made, the Government \nbelieves the pace of change needs to be accelerated.11 Investment in wastewater management \nsystems  still  is  urgently  needed.  Moreover,  socioeconomic  surveys  demonstrate  that  the \ngeneral public is becoming increasingly concerned about the impact of wastewater pollution, \nand  are  willing  to  pay  for  wastewater  treatment  and  environmental  improvement.  While \nwastewater companies have been established in many cities, few are financially or managerially \nautonomous. Tariffs generally have not been increased enough to achieve full cost recovery. \nCorporate governance system needs to be improved, key personnel require training, and the \ncommercial  orientation  of  wastewater  management  companies  must  be  strengthened. \nAdditional information on wastewater management in the PRC and in Fuzhou is in Appendix 2. \n \n13.  Policy Dialogue.  ADB has promoted actively policy reforms in water supply, sanitation, \nand waste management, which has emerged as one of the major sectors of ADB\u2019s operations in \nthe PRC. The reform agenda for wastewater management particularly has shown significant \nprogress in introducing tariff and enterprise reforms, strengthening the legal and regulatory \nframework, and promoting PSP. ADB's landmark water tariff studies, funded through technical \nassistance  (TA)  grants,12  contributed  significantly  to  water  tariff  reforms  and  resource \nconservation in the PRC. This was followed by ADB\u2019s wastewater tariff study TA,13 which \ndeveloped national guidelines for wastewater tariffs. These guidelines include tariff calculation \nmethodologies that will allow full cost recovery, taking into consideration affordability and social \nconstraints.  The  TA  also  recommended  options  for  encouraging  multi-channel  investment, \nincluding PSP in urban wastewater management. \n \n                                                 \n10 The proportion of the population in the PRC with access to clean water increased from 71% in 1990 to 75% in \n2000.

ADB also is supporting the Government through a TA to strengthen policy reform on the \nuse of market-based instruments to enhance private sector partnership in public utilities, mainly \nfor water supply and wastewater and solid waste management.14 This TA will analyze the issues \nin the context of international best practices, and determine how these could be adopted in the \nPRC. The TAs will complement ADB\u2019s pioneering role in promoting PSP through the Chengdu \nWater Supply Project, the first urban water supply BOT project awarded under an open bidding \nsystem.15 \n \n15.  As  part  of  its  policy  to  strengthen  the  legal  framework  for  sound  environmental \nmanagement, ADB supported training staff of the Environment Protection Commission of the \nNational People's Congress, and drafting and revising some of the environmental laws. In May \n1996, the 1984 Water Pollution Law was amended to address many of its weaknesses. The \namendments also reflected the revisions to the Water Pollution Prevention and Control Law \nrecommended under another ADB TA (Legislative Planning and Procedures for the Protection \nof the Environment). In addition, ADB helped upgrade the knowledge and skills of provincial \nlegislative drafters in the review, amendment, and formulation of local legislation on protection \nand  conservation  of  the  environment  and  natural  resources.  ADB  helped  improve  the \ninstitutional  capacity  of  the  State  Environmental  Protection  Administration  (SEPA)  and  its \nprovincial bureaus to strengthen environmental standards and to enforce environmental laws \nand policies. A pilot public disclosure program that rates the environmental quality of enterprises \nin Anhui, which complements the work of SEPA in other provinces and cities, also has shown \nprogress. \n \n16.  Through  the  proposed  Project,  ADB  will  continue  to  support  these  and  additional \nreforms,  including  tariff  increases  and  PSP  in  urban  services.  FMG  is  conducting  public \nconsultation, education, and awareness programs on environmental protection and wastewater \nmanagement. The Project includes support for these programs to help harness popular support \nfor environmental improvements, and to improve the public\u2019s willingness to pay for wastewater \ntariffs. The continued implementation of the necessary institutional and financial reforms enjoys \nhigh-level support within FMG and FPG. \n \n17.  Lessons  Learned.  ADB  has  approved  around  $1.7  billion  in  loans  for  urban \nenvironment  improvement  in  the  PRC,  including  wastewater  and  water  supply  projects \n(Appendix 3).  Loan projects generally have been implemented well. One of the projects was the \nFuzhou Water Supply and Wastewater Treatment Project (footnote 9). Completed in December \n2003, the project\u2014which included the Yangli WWTP Phase 1 and associated sewer networks\u2014\nwas  rated as  highly  successful.16  The  facilities  are  fully operational,  and  receive  sufficient \nfunding for operation and maintenance (O&M) from wastewater tariff revenues. Lessons learned \nfrom  the  first  Fuzhou  project  and  other  wastewater  projects  include  the  importance  of  (i) \nreviewing thoroughly technical designs; (ii) having strategic master plans in urban development \nand environmental management; (iii) considering local conditions and constraints; (iv) having \nmeasures  to  support  financial  reform,  particularly  in  establishing  autonomous  wastewater \nentities and tariff increases; (v) institutional strengthening, particularly in establishing managerial \nautonomy; (vi) addressing regulatory and enforcement issues; (vii) promoting public education \non environmental improvement; (viii) providing training to utility personnel; (ix) achieving better \npublic  consultation  and  community  participation;  (x)  paying  early  attention  to  resettlement \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2003.

A commitment fee of 0.75% of the unreleased portion of the ADB loan \nwas included. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n                                                 \n19 The grant is funded under ADB\u2019s RETA-6123 (ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance for Promoting Effective Water \nManagement Policies and Practices \u2013 Phase 3. Manila). Approved by the Board on 3 October 2003. \n ", "8 \nE.  Financing Plan \n25.  The Government requested a loan of $55.80 million, about 30% of the project cost, to \nfinance about 76% of the foreign exchange cost of the Project. The loan, from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources, will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years. The interest rate \nwill be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility, plus a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The Government has provided \nADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on \nthe basis of these terms and conditions; and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own \nindependent decision, and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n26.  As the Borrower, the PRC will relend the funds to FPG, which will make them available \nto FMG on the same terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. FMG will onlend the \nproceeds, on the same terms and conditions as the ADB loan, to the implementing agencies: \nFuzhou  Urban  Visual  Construction  Development  Company  (FUVCDC)  and  Fuzhou  Water \nEnvironment  Construction  and  Development  Company  (FWECDC),  the  former  Yangli \nWastewater  Treatment  Plant  Construction  Company,  which  implemented  the  ADB-funded \nYangli WWTP Phase 1. FWECDC and FUVCDC will assume the foreign exchange and interest \nrate variation risks for ADB\u2019s loan, and reimburse FPG and FMG for any intermediation and \ntransaction costs. An equity infusion by FMG and a loan from a domestic bank will provide \nadditional funding for the Project. The Borrower, FPG, and FMG have assured that counterpart \nfunding will be provided to meet the funding requirements of the Project, including the foreign \nexchange contingencies and interest during construction on the ADB loan.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n27.  FMG will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the Project. As the EA, FMG has formed a \nproject  leading  group  (PLG),  chaired  by  a  deputy  mayor  of  FMG.  The  PLG  will  include \nrepresentatives  of  the  Fuzhou  Municipal  Development  and  Planning  Commission,  Fuzhou \nMunicipal  Financial  Bureau,  Fuzhou  Municipal  Environmental  Protection  Bureau  (FMEPB), \nFuzhou Municipal Construction Bureau, and Fuzhou Urban Management Regulatory Bureau \nand other related agencies. The PLG will meet periodically to provide policy guidance, facilitate ", "9 \ninteragency  coordination,  and  resolve  any  institutional  problems  affecting  project \nimplementation. \n \n28.  The project management office (PMO) that FMG set up to manage the first ADB project \nwill serve as the secretariat of the PLG. With its extensive experience in implementing the first \nADB project, the PMO will continue to (i) ensure adequate interdepartmental cooperation and \ninteragency coordination, (ii) monitor the progress of project implementation, and (iii) coordinate \ncommunication with ADB and concerned agencies.  \n \n29.  FWECDC will be responsible for the implementation of the sewer network components. \nFUVCDC will be responsible for the inland creek rehabilitation component. In addition to the \nsupport of experienced domestic and international consultants, FWECDC and FUVCDC will \nretain  the  services  of  design  institutes,  specialist  procurement  agencies,  and  construction \nsupervision companies to assist with implementation. In consultation with the PMO, FWECDC \nand FUVCDC will implement their respective portions of the capacity building component. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n30.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years (Appendix 6). The implementation period \nis  estimated  based  on  the  project  scope  and  construction  technology  requirements.  This \nschedule is considered realistic and achievable based on ADB\u2019s successful experience with \nsimilar projects in the PRC, and FMG\u2019s in-depth knowledge and experience in wastewater \npollution control and wastewater collection projects using international financing. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n31.  Equipment, materials and goods, and services financed by the loan will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Procurement and follow ADB procedures for international \ncompetitive bidding (ICB) for packages each with a value greater than $1.0 million. Packages \nvalued at $1.0 million or less will be procured following international shopping procedures. Civil \nworks contracts costing more than $10 million will be procured using ICB. Civil works packages \nvalued  at  $10.0  million  or  less  will  be  tendered  under  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB) \nprocedures acceptable to ADB, and in accordance with the PRC\u2019s Tendering and Bidding Law \nand procurement regulations.20 Local contractors have the expertise and capacity to undertake \nthe LCB packages. In accordance with ADB requirements, foreign contractors may participate in \nthe bidding for LCB contracts. Indicative procurement packages are provided in Appendix 7. \nThe internationally tendered equipment packages will include the technical support necessary \nfor ensuring proper installation, testing, commissioning, and training of operational staff as part \nof the related contracts. By utilizing the manufacturers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 technical experts, who are \nmost knowledgeable about the equipment, quality control in equipment installation and operator \ntraining is assured. \n \n4.  Advance Procurement Action and Retroactive Financing \n32.  ADB approved FMG\u2019s request for advance procurement to allow preparatory works to \nstart  early, so  that  mandated  treatment  rate  goals  can be  achieved  as  soon as  possible. \nAdvance actions will include (i) prequalification of contractors, tendering, and bid evaluation for \n                                                 \n20 ADB assisted in establishing national procurement regulations for the public sector under TA 2845-PRC (ADB. \n1997. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Establishment of National Procurement \nRegulation for the Public Sector. Manila [$565,000, approved on 20 August 1997]), including the drafting of six \nregulations and three sample bidding documents. \n ", "10 \ncivil works contract packages; and (ii) preparation of tender documents for the procurement of \nequipment and materials. ADB also approved the request for retroactive financing of about $4.8 \nmillion to meet part of the costs of rehabilitating three inland creeks on Nantai Island. The \nretroactive financing and advance actions will be used from the end of the Appraisal Mission \nuntil  loan  effectiveness.  The  issuance  of  invitations  to  bid  or  to  prequalify  under  advance \nprocurement still will be subject to ADB approval.21 Advance procurement will follow ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  Procurement.  The  Government,  FPG,  FMG,  FWECDC,  and  FUVCDC  were \nadvised that approval of retroactive financing or advance action does not commit ADB to \nfinance the Project. \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n \n33.  The loan will finance about 30 person-months of international consulting services and \n120 person-months of domestic consulting services to support the PMO, as well as FWECDC \nand FUVCDC, in project implementation and capacity building. Consulting services will cover (i) \ntechnical  and  engineering  management,  (ii)  institutional  and  managerial  development,  (iii) \noperations  management,  (iv)  financial  management,  (v)  project  performance  management \nsystem (PPMS) framework and resettlement monitoring, and (vi) environmental monitoring and \nreporting. The consultants will assist the PMO on ADB procedures and reporting, procurement, \nquality control, startup testing, commissioning, O&M, and implementation of the PPMS. FMG \nwill  initiate  advance  action  for  the  recruitment  of  consultants,  including  the  shortlisting  of \nqualified consultants. \n \n34.  The Consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants. International consulting firms will be selected in accordance with the quality-and-\ncost-based selection method. They will be required to submit a full technical proposal. The \noutline terms of references for consulting services is in Appendix 8. In addition, FWECDC and \nFUVCDC will use loan funds to finance broader training activities.  \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n35.  FPG will set up an imprest account after loan effectiveness in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook. Disbursements from the imprest account will be supported by an \nappropriate  withdrawal  application  and  related  documentation.  Such  documentation  will \ndemonstrate, among other things, that the goods and/or services are produced in and procured \nfrom ADB's members, and eligible for ADB financing. The initial amount to be deposited into the \nimprest  account  will  not  exceed  6  months  of  estimated  expenditures,  or  10%  of  the  loan \namount,  whichever  is  lower.  The  statement  of  expenditures  procedure  may  be  used  for \nreimbursement of eligible expenditures. Individual payments to be reimbursed or liquidated \nunder the procedure will not exceed $200,000.22  \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n36.  The accounting, auditing, and reporting systems and procedures for the Project will be \nestablished in accordance with accounting principles and practices satisfactory to ADB. FPG, \nFMG, FWECDC, and FUVCDC will maintain separate accounts for the Project. Independent \n                                                 \n21 Advance action and retroactive financing was approved on 27 July 2004. \n22 Limits for the imprest account and statement of expenditures are in accordance with a recent review of ADB\u2019s PRC \nportfolio and to facilitate improved efficiency in loan disbursement.  ", "11 \nauditors acceptable to ADB will audit the project accounts of FPG, FMG, FWEDC and FUVCDC \nannually. Certified copies of such audited accounts in English will be submitted to ADB not later \nthan 6 months after the end of the financial year to which they relate. As the ADB loan will be \nmade available to FPG and FMG, and onlent to FWECDC and FUVCDC, an externally audited \nfinancial statement for both implementing agencies also will be submitted to ADB annually. This \nreport should be submitted no later than 6 months after the end of the relevant financial year.23 \nThe annual audit report will include a separate audit opinion on the use of the imprest account \nand  statement  of  expenditures  procedures.  FMG,  PMO,  FWECDC,  and  FUVCDC  were \ninformed about ADB's policy on submission of audited project accounts and financial statements \nand  possible  penalties  for  delays  in  submission.  Audited  project  accounts  and  financial \nstatements  with  adverse  opinions  or  disclaimers  of  opinion  from  auditors  are  considered \nunacceptable and cannot be submitted for this purpose. Independent review and scrutiny of \nproject implementation will be undertaken for (i) environmental monitoring and adherence to \nprovisions  in  the  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  (EIA),  including  the  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP); (ii) compliance with the resettlement plans (RPs); and (iii) audit of \nproject accounts and compliance with loan covenants. \n \n37.  The PMO will submit to ADB reports and information on the use of the loan proceeds, \nproject implementation, and the performance of FWECDC and FUVCDC. These reports will \ninclude semiannual progress reports on project implementation and a project completion report \nno later than 3 months after completion of the Project. The semiannual progress reports cover \npolicy dialogue, including (i) tariffs and financial management, (ii) environmental monitoring, (iii) \nresettlement, and (iv) capacity building. \n \n8.  Anticorruption \n38.  During project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to Government \nofficials. In particular, the section on fraud and corruption that was added to ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants is an efficient mechanism for preventing unethical behavior. ADB\u2019s \ncountry program for the PRC included assistance for improving governance to reduce the \nincidence of fraud.24 The Government has made significant efforts to combat corruption. To \nprevent corruption on the proposed Project, FMG will (i) involve full-time officials from Fuzhou \nMunicipal  Discipline  Investigation  Bureau  in  supervising  the  bidding  and  construction;  (ii) \nintroduce a dual-signing system, which requires the civil works contract winner to sign an \nanticorruption contract with the employer; and (iii) inspect periodically the contractor\u2019s fund \nwithdrawals and settlements. \n \n9.  Project Performance Management System  \n \n39.  The PPMS indicators for the Project include (i) service levels, treated wastewater quality, \nand other measures of operational performance; (ii) percentages of wastewater collected and \ntreated; (iii) inland creeks rehabilitated; (iv) user satisfaction with the urban environment; and (v) \nrelevant economic and social data\u2014such as income, health, and gender\u2014to monitor project \nimpacts. The PPMS will be designed to permit adequate flexibility to adopt remedial action for \nproject design, schedules, activities, and development impacts. At the beginning of the Project, \nPMO, FWECDC, FUVCDC, and the consultants will develop PPMS procedures to generate \ndata systematically on inputs and outputs of the project components, as well as the agreed \n                                                 \n23 FWECDC has three tiers of audit: (i) internal audit, (ii) FMG audit, and (iii) external audit. \n24 ADB. 1998.

Manila. \n ", "12 \nsocioeconomic and environmental indicators to be used to measure project impacts. PMO, \nFWECDC, and FUVCDC will refine the PPMS framework, confirm achievable goals, firm up \nmonitoring and recording arrangements, and establish systems and procedures no later than 12 \nmonths after loan effectiveness. FWECDC and FUVCDC will report the baseline and progress \ndata at the requisite time intervals, and will be responsible for analyzing and consolidating the \ndata. \n \n10.  Project Review \n40.  In addition to the regular ADB review missions, a midterm review also will be undertaken \nwith the Government 2 years after the start of project implementation. This review will include a \ndetailed evaluation of (i) the scope, (ii) implementation arrangements, (iii) wastewater tariffs, (iv) \nresettlement, (v) achievement of scheduled targets, and (vi) progress on the agenda for policy \nreforms and capacity building measures. Feedback from the PPMS activities will be analyzed. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \n41.  The Project will help FMG achieve national wastewater treatment target through the \nconstruction of additional wastewater treatment capacity and the construction of associated \nsewer networks and pumping stations. For effluent to reach national standards, these project \ncomponents  will  collect  and  transport  wastewater  in  their  drainage  areas  for  treatment  at \nsecondary WWTPs. The Project will allow Fuzhou to treat about 70% of its wastewater by 2010. \nMunicipal wastewater treatment is a key to controlling point-source water pollution, the first step \ntoward meeting water quality standards and reducing public health hazards. Overall, residents \nof Fuzhou will benefit from an improved living environment, a reduced risk of unsafe drinking \nwater supplies, and better prospects for economic development and growth. \n \n42.  Wastewater interception, treatment, and disposal provide the best long-term prospect for \nreducing waterborne pollution and improving water quality conditions in the inland creeks and \nMin River. Historically, the creeks have been the point of discharge for all untreated wastewater. \nRehabilitation of the polluted creeks will reduce the occurrence of flooding of houses and shops \nalong the riverbanks. The quality of water of the inland creeks and the urban living environment \nwill improve when wastewater is collected into underground sewer networks for treatment at the \ncentralized  WWTPs.  The  WWTPs,  which  will  employ  the  same  treatment  processes \nsuccessfully used in other treatment plants, will be cost effective and reliable, and will have \nsufficient land to accommodate plant expansion until 2020. Sewer capacities to be installed will \naccommodate  growth  in  wastewater  flows  until  2020,  thus  guarding  against  the  risk  of \nwastewater overflows within the urban service area. This also will allow unanticipated flows that \nexceed the initially installed biological treatment capacity to receive preliminary treatment in the \nhead works of the WWTP. The technical features of the WWTPs will address the risk from \nunderestimated flows in the early years of operation.  \n \nA.  Institutional Strengthening \n \n43.  A financial management assessment of FWECDC and FUVCDC was conducted during \nthe  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA),  using  ADB\u2019s  financial  management \nquestionnaire. This involved interviews with officials of FWECDC and FUVCDC to determine the \nlevel of management\u2019s competency to implement and operate the companies. Deficiencies were \nnoted,  and  a  corporate  development  plan  is  proposed  to  be  undertaken  during  project \nimplementation,  particularly  by  revenue-generating  FWECDC.  FPG  has  required  that \nwastewater  companies,  including  FWECDC,  become  more  financially  independent.  The ", "13 \nproposed  corporate  development  plan  will  equip  FWECDC  with  modern  management \ntechniques to prepare for its eventual operation as an autonomous company. The plan will \nenable FWECDC to (i) become more financially independent; (ii) improve corporate governance \nthrough the adoption of efficiency measures and internal controls; (iii) become fully responsible \nfor the O&M of relevant project facilities, including the repayment of all loans; and (iv) assume \nownership of all permanent works constructed under the Project. The financial management \nassessment of FWECDC and its proposed corporate development plan are summarized in \nAppendix 9.25 The Project also will help strengthen the capacity of FUVCDC, which will remain a \ngovernment  agency,  to  (i)  efficiently  manage  project  implementation  and  management,  (ii) \noperate and maintain the project facilities effectively, and (iii) assume ownership of project \nfacilities. \n \nB.  Social Dimensions \n \n1.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n44.  The Project will acquire permanently 74.81 hectares (ha) of land, of which 31% is \nfarmland, primarily for the rehabilitation of the inland creeks on Nantai Island. The Project also \nwill require the temporary acquisition of 8.17 ha. Further, 1,148 households (or 5,045 people) \nwill be relocated, and about 197,230 m2 of houses will be demolished. The Project also will \naffect 75 enterprises and 13 shops, with a total 2,795 employees. Some 231,501 m2 of industrial \nand commercial space, houses, and buildings will be dismantled. The Project will relocate \n10,020 m2 of public houses and/or buildings, such as a market building, clinic, school, and \nbuildings for village administration and public use. The Project will not adversely affect any \nindigenous people or ethnic minorities. The preliminary cost estimate for the land acquisition \nand  resettlement  (LAR)  program  is  $46.36  million,  with  the  Nantai  Island  Inland  Creek \ncomponent accounting for about 96% of the cost. The Fuzhou Municipal Land Development \nCenter (FMLDC) will assist FUVCDC in carrying out the LAR for two inland creeks on Nantai \nIsland. Resettlement impacts have been identified, and resettlement plans (RPs) prepared in \naccordance with PRC Land Administration Law and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. \nThe RPs provide a socioeconomic profile of affected persons (APs) and the scope of impacts, \nand addresses entitlements of APs to compensation, legal framework, public consultations, \ngrievance procedures, environmental protection, rehabilitation, and budget and implementation \nmilestones. The RPs, which have been disclosed to the public, are summarized in Appendix 10. \n \n45.  FMG will establish a project resettlement office to continue public information activities \nand respond to any questions or grievances. FMG will ensure that all APs are compensated and \nresettled in a timely and adequate manner in accordance with the RP. FMG will keep ADB \ninformed of the progress of RP implementation through quarterly progress reports until the \nresettlement is completed. FMG also will prepare a resettlement completion report. FMG (as the \nExecuting Agency) and FWECDC and FUVCDC (as the implementing agencies) will engage an \nindependent agency for semiannual monitoring and annual evaluation of LAR until 2 years after \nprogram implementation. \n \n2.  Poverty Reduction \n \n46.  The Project will improve the health and well being of 1.85 million urban residents of \nFuzhou by (i) enhancing the quality of household water supply; (ii) reducing the risk of floods; \nand (iii) reducing waterborne diseases through improvements in the collection and disposal of \n                                                 \n25 Other details of the corporate development plan are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n ", "14 \nwastewater,  and  in  sanitary  conditions.  The health  benefits  are  significant  for women  and \nchildren, who bear a disproportionate share of household chores and have frequent contact with \nwater and wastewater. Savings in medical costs are greatest among children, the elderly, \nwomen, and the poor\u2014groups that are most vulnerable to such diseases. The Project will help \nthe Government achieve the MDG for environmental sustainability (Goal 7), and to half the \nproportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by \n2015 (MDG Targets 10 and 11). \n \n47.  Improved  environmental  and  water  quality  will  ensure  the  steady  and  sustainable \ndevelopment of Fuzhou, especially its tourism and service-oriented industries, and create more \njobs. The Project will create about 6,648 person-years of employment during construction. The \npoor will fill about 40%, or 2,600 person-years, of the jobs for unskilled and semi-skilled works. \nProject-related services, such as procurement of construction materials and equipment, will \nprovide  an  additional  3,420  person-years  of  employment.  A  poverty  reduction  and  social \nstrategy for the Project is summarized in Appendix 11. \n \nC.  Financial Aspects \n \n48.  The  Project  will  support  institutional  reforms  to  improve  the  financial  autonomy  of \nFWECDC.  The  long-term  viability  of  the  FWECDC  will  depend  on  its  ability  to  charge \nwastewater tariffs that cover O&M costs, loan repayments, and depreciation of capital assets. \nTariffs will need to be increased from CNY0.45/m3 to cover the full cost of O&M, interest \npayments, depreciation, and a profit margin. To cushion the impact on the public, the citywide \ntariff will be increased in stages, as the first ADB wastewater project successfully did. Financial \nanalysis indicates that wastewater tariffs must be increased to CNY1.25/m3 by the time the \nprojects are completed in 2009 to achieve full cost recovery. FWECDC also will explore the \npossibility of reducing O&M costs, which would allow a lower tariff increase. FWECDC has \nagreed to review wastewater tariffs annually, and to recommend tariff adjustments to FMG and \nFPG  based  on  this  review.  These  adjustments  would  mitigate  the  risk  of  poor  financial \nperformance or unexpected changes in operating income. FMG also will support proposals for \ntariff increases provided that they satisfy PRC procedures for utility price increase. FMG and \nFWECDC  will  review  the  impact  of  increased  wastewater  tariffs  on  the  poor,  and  adopt \nappropriate measures to protect the basic living standards of the poor. Fuzhou Municipal Civil \nAffairs Bureau operates a social support program for the poorest households, which includes \nassistance in paying water, wastewater, and other utility charges.  \n \n49.  The financial evaluation of the Project was undertaken in real terms using constant 2004 \nprices. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for the Project, computed on an after-tax \nbasis, is 5.2% (Appendix 12). This exceeds the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), also \ncomputed  on  an  after-tax  basis,  of  2.6%.  The  Project  is  considered  financially viable  and \nsustainable. Sensitivity and risk analysis indicates that the FIRR for the Project is robust under \nmost conditions. FWECDC has agreed to prescribed levels of financial performance and these \nhave been included as covenants covering capital structure (debt to equity), debt service cover \nand liquidity. The financial projections for FWECDC indicate that it will achieve these prescribed \nlevels of financial performance (Appendix 12).  \n \nD.  Economic Aspects \n \n50.  The economic analysis considers the Project as an integrated part of ongoing city, \nmunicipal, and basin-wide environmental programs, rather than as a stand-alone investment. \nThis methodology recommends an approach to economic analysis that is more appropriate than ", "15 \nstandard benefit-cost analysis.26 The basic concept is that if standards and targets for ambient \nwater quality appear well founded, reasonable, and partly driven by social choice, as long as \nmechanisms for monitoring and enforcement are in place, then the economic approach to \nmeeting those targets is one of least cost. 27 \n \n51.  PRC  environmental  policy  takes  a  cost-effective  approach  to  pollution  control  and \nwastewater management through specific treatment rate targets and required water quality \nstandards for water bodies. After initially targeting large point-source polluters, the policy is now \nfocused on major population centers. Major cities, including Fuzhou, should have a wastewater \ntreatment rate of 70% by 2010. The Min River Basin Plan28 sets the water quality requirement \nfor the Fuzhou stretch of the Min River as Class III. As part of a national program to expedite \nwastewater management plans, a target city treatment rate of 70% seems reasonable. The \nClass III requirement for the Min River, the source of the city\u2019s water supply, is in line with the \nrequirements for potable water sources established and enforced by SEPA. \n \n52.  For Fuzhou, FMG has adapted its planning process to meet the enormous challenges of \nrapid  economic  growth  and  urbanization.  The  FUMP29  is  a  comprehensive  document  that \nprovides a strategic vision of sustainable economic development in Fuzhou. The FUMP has \nidentified a series of short-term actions to halt the deterioration of water quality, and long-term \nactions to address the environmental problems and to protect water resources, including the \nMin  River.  For  wastewater  and  water  resources  protection,  the  FUMP  designates  water \nresources protection zones for more stringent environmental controls, and targets point-source \npolluters first as the most cost-effective approach to improving ambient water quality. Evidence \nsuggests that many of the priority actions have been taken. Plans for sewer networks and \nWWTPs are detailed and updated in the Fuzhou Wastewater Master Plan.30 The investment \nprogram prioritized drainage areas, making use of existing sewer networks first. The program is \nintegrated well, and coordinated with, improvements in existing and developing urban areas. \nWithout  the  project  systems,  two  new  WWTPs  (funded  by  third  parties)  cannot  become \noperational and the goal of treating 70% of wastewater will not be met. The proposed inland \ncreek rehabilitation component is coordinated well. The 13 creeks identified are part of drainage \nareas that already have collection and treatment systems, or will have new systems provided \nunder the Project. \n \n53.  The sewer networks systems and the inland creek rehabilitation program were designed \nbased on capital, technical, and implementation considerations that can provide the most cost-\neffective  solution.  The  design  of  the  systems  (i)  limits  resettlement,  where  possible;  (ii) \nminimizes pumping to reduce operations costs; and (iii) optimizes sewer layouts to achieve \nminimum disruption and least cost in laying sewers, while allowing maximum flexibility for \nexpansion. Estimates of the unit cost of sewer networks and treatment illustrate economies of \nscale. Although unit rates for individual systems vary according to procurement method, size, \nand technical considerations, the average economic cost of the system will decline gradually as \nthe wastewater treatment rate in the city increases (Appendix 13). \n \n                                                 \n26 ADB. 2003.

The \nplan is based on GNP growth of 15% per year in 2001\u20132010. \n30 Special Wastewater Plan of Fuzhou City to 2020, December 2002. The State Council approved the plan, but only \nto 2010. \n ", "16 \n54.  The public health and environmental benefits of wastewater collection and treatment, \nand  the  inland  creek  cleanup,  are  well  established.  The  1.85  million  urban  residents, \nbusinesses, and visitors to the city will benefit directly. The Project will (i) protect the city\u2019s \nsource for drinking water, and help to ensure that the Min River reaches Class III water quality \nor above; (ii) provide the necessary sewer networks for the planned WWTPs; (iii) improve the \nliving environment through greening, and creating access to inland creeks; and (iv) remove an \nidentified constraint to growth, facilitate expansion, and attract private sector investment. A \ndetailed economic analysis in Appendix 13 demonstrates that the Project is a critical component \nof the FUMP, and represents a cost-effective approach to achieving incremental improvements \nin environmental quality.  \n \nE.  Environmental Aspects \n \n55.  The Project will improve the urban environment, aquatic environment of inland creeks, \nand public health and safety of Fuzhou, as well as promote its sustainable urban development. \nThe  Project  will  target  substantial  improvements  in  (i)  Fuzhou\u2019s  wastewater  management, \nincluding collection and treatment; (ii) water quality of inland creeks of Nantai Island; and (iii) the \nprotection of water quality in the Min River, the source of drinking water for Fuzhou. The \nsummary EIA was circulated to the ADB Board on 7 July 2004. Highlights of the summary EIA \nare in Appendix 14. The Project will have an overwhelmingly positive environmental impact, and \nany environmental risks during construction will be mitigated. \n \n56.  The  Project  will  provide  wastewater  collection  systems  for  the  Yangli  and  Lianban \nservice areas. The two sewer network components of the Project will elevate the level of \nservices  by  improving  management  of  the  networks  through  the  strengthening  of  an \nautonomous wastewater collection company. The collected wastewater will be transported to \nthe Yangli and Lianban WWTPs, which will be constructed and operated in accordance with the \nenvironmental requirements stipulated in the summary EIA. The Nantai Island Inland Creek \nRehabilitation component will enhance the conditions for urban development on the island by \nsignificantly improving the environment of Nantai Island and flood control. About 10.5 million \ntons of wastewater will be treated annually. Some key annual wastewater load reductions \ninclude 16,060 tons of biochemical oxygen demand, 24,090 tons of chemical oxygen demand, \nand 22,995 tons of suspended solids. The environmental management plan (EMP), prepared as \npart of the summary EIA, will guide environmental mitigation and monitoring under the Project. \nThe EMP includes an institutional enhancement program and public participation activities, \nwhich FWECDC, FUVCDC, FMEPB, and PMO will implement. \n \nF.  Private Sector Development \n \n57.  The proposed Project will support the FPG initiative to promote PSP in the development \nof urban infrastructure. In 2001, FPG adopted a regulation requiring all new WWTP construction \nto explore and use multiple channels of funding, including private sector funding. Consequently, \nthe  Jinshan  WWTP  in  Fuzhou,  with  a  capacity  of  50,000  m3/day,  was  the  first  WWTP \nconstructed  on  a  BOT  basis.  Eight  bidders  submitted  tenders,  and  after  a  competitive \nevaluation, the project was awarded with a 20-year concession agreement. Since then, about \n10 other WWTPs have used the BOT modality for their project investment in Fujian Province. \nMore WWTPs, with capacities ranging from 20,000 to 50,000 m3/day, will be implemented for \nthe county-level cities in the future. For these BOT projects, the local governments will be \nresponsible for the construction of the associated sewer networks and pumping stations. Using \nthe experience of the Jinshan WWTP, FMG is pursuing other WWTP projects. Lessons learned \nfrom the first BOT project have been used in planning the Lianban WWTP BOT, which will be ", "17 \nconnected to the Lianban sewer networks to be financed under the proposed Project. Several \ngroups of investors have expressed interest in the Lianban WWTP BOT project. \n \n58.  ADB policy has highlighted the importance of wastewater tariff reforms in creating a \nmore  conducive  environment  for  private  sector  participation  in  the  development  of  urban \ninfrastructure, such as WWTPs. FMG, which demonstrated its commitment to wastewater tariff \nreforms under the first ADB-funded Yangli WWTP, has agreed to consider further tariff reforms \nunder the proposed Project to achieve full cost recovery. FMG\u2019s recognition of the essential role \nof tariff reforms will stimulate the interest of private investors in the Lianban WWTP. To achieve \nits project objectives in improving the urban environment through the collection and treatment of \nwastewater, the Lianban WWTP BOT implementation schedules will be aligned closely with the \nconstruction  schedule of  the sewer  networks.  Further,  the  bidding and  construction  of  the \nWWTP  BOT  has  been  planned  to  match  the  schedules  of  the  ADB  loan  processing  and \nimplementation to ensure that the wastewater collected will not be discharged back into the \nrivers downstream. The capacity building component of the Project will assist the Government in \ndeveloping its PSP framework. \n \nG.  Risks  \n \n59.  Potential risks of the Project include (i) delays in construction of the two WWTPs for the \nsewer networks; and (ii) the failure to implement, in parallel with the Project, pumping stations to \naugment the flow in the inland creeks. These risks are being addressed by synchronizing the \nproject design and implementation schedule, as well as other appropriate project assurances. \nThe use of experienced consultants to prepare designs and monitor implementation will mitigate \nany specific construction risks. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n60.  Specific Assurances. In addition to the standard assurances, the following assurances \nwere discussed with the Government, FPG, and FMG. \n \n(i)  The Government, through FPG and FMG, will ensure that (a) all counterpart \nfunding will be provided for the Project in a timely manner, and (b) additional \ncounterpart funding will be provided for any funding shortfall in cost overruns.  \n \n(ii)  FWECDC will implement the corporate development plan as agreed with ADB. \n \n(iii)  FPG and FMG will ensure that (a) review of wastewater tariffs is undertaken \nannually;  (b)  wastewater  tariffs  are  determined  to  cover  the  costs  of  all \nwastewater  operations  in  Fuzhou;  (c)  wastewater  tariffs  are  determined  in \naccordance with project financing needs to strengthen the financial viability of \nFWECDC (full cost recovery of O&M, interest payments, depreciation or debt \nrepayment, and a profit margin) for all operations by 2009, subject to compliance \nwith  laws  and  regulations  of  the  Government;  (d)  no  entity,  whether  any \nGovernment agency, institution or enterprise, regardless of ownership, will be \ngranted an exemption from the wastewater tariff, or granted a preferential rate, or \nexcused for delays in payments without penalties; (e) the impact of increased \nwastewater  tariffs  on  the  poor  is  reviewed  and  appropriate  measures  are \nintroduced  to  protect  the  basic  living  standards  of  the  urban  poor;  and  (f) \nsummaries of these reviews are submitted to ADB within 3 months of completion. \n \n ", "18 \n(iv)  FMG will ensure that FWECDC, from the start of full commercial operation of the \nproject facilities, will maintain a minimum debt service ratio of 1.2:1; a maximum \ndebt-equity ratio of 70:30; and a minimum current ratio of 2:1 or a quick ratio of \n1:1. \n \n(v)  FMG, FUVCDC, and FWECDC will ensure that (a) the Project and Yangli and \nLianban WWTPs are constructed and operated in accordance with laws and \nregulation,  environmental  procedures  and  guidelines  of  the  Government \n(including local regulations) and ADB\u2019s Environmental Policy; (b) any adverse \nenvironmental impacts arising from the Project and Yangli and Lianban WWTPs \nare minimized by implementing the mitigation measures prescribed in the EMP; \n(c) civil works contracts entered into with contractors will include obligations of \ncontractors  relating  to  environment,  including  mitigation  and  monitoring \nmeasures as specified in the EMP; (d) PMO will submit semiannual reports on \nEMP implementation to ADB; and (e) implementation of the EMP will follow the \nscope and budget as presented in the EMP. \n \n(vi)  FMG, through FWECDC and FUVCDC, will ensure that (a) all land and rights-of-\nway required by the Project are made available in a timely manner; (b) the RPs \nwill be implemented in accordance with all applicable PRC laws and regulations, \nand ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement; (c) all APs legally or illegally \nusing affected plots and structures are compensated adequately; (d) all APs are \nat least as well off as they would in the absence of the Project; (e) all APs are \ngiven  adequate  opportunity  to  participate  in  resettlement  planning  and \nimplementation; (f) timely provision of counterpart funds will be paid for land \nacquisition and resettlement activities; and (g) any obligations in excess of the \nRP budget estimate are met.

The National Policy and Regulatory Framework \n \n1.  Before the 1990s, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) was the \nsole provider of urban services. Wastewater management practice was based on septic tanks, \ndesignated  open  drainage  ditches,  and  no  treatment.  Services  were  funded  through  tax \nrevenue, with consumers paying minimal or no charges. In view of the rapid economic growth \nand  urban  expansion,  the  Government  recognized  the  need  to  implement  environmental \nprotection measures alongside economic growth policies to meet its vision of clean, modern, \nand environmentally sustainable cities that are competitive in the global market. As a result, the \nGovernment shifted fundamentally towards a market-based approach, enterprise provision in \nthe delivery of infrastructure services, and an integrated approach to urban management. \n \n2.   The  Water  Pollution  and  Prevention  Law  (1996)  authorizes  setting  standards  for \nambient  surface  water  quality,1  and  uses  these  standards  to  set  targets  for  individual \nwatercourses. The State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) defines the technical \nstandards at a national level, including standards that apply to sections of creeks or other \nwatercourses  of  strategic  significance.  For  other  creeks  and  watercourses,  the  relevant \nenvironmental protection department at the municipal or provincial level sets the targeted water \nquality class. \n \n3.  The PRC\u2019s successive 5-year plans have set targets and requirements for achieving the \ndesignated water quality classes. Provincial and municipal governments are called upon to draft \nspecific plans to address wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal. Industries are provided \nwith regulations on effluent standards before discharge to a municipal sewer. Industries are \nrequired to provide adequate wastewater treatment to  meet regulatory pollution limits. For \nmunicipal wastewater, the level of treatment is determined by the water quality class of the \nreceiving water and specific target treatment rates. The targets in the Tenth Five-Year Plan \n(TFYP) were a wastewater treatment rate of 45% for regional and higher level cities, and 60% \nfor cities discharging more than 500,000 m3/day by 2005. The Ministry of Construction (MCon) \nset a more stringent target of a 70% treatment rate for larger cities (e.g., major cities and \nprovincial capitals) by 2010.2 \n \n4.  Several other policies, regulations, and plans support the framework for water quality \nmanagement. Building regulations from the MCon (dating to the 1980s) require the construction \nof septic tanks for all new residential and other non-industrial developments. New developments \nare excused from this requirement if the discharge is to a municipal sewer connected to a \nwastewater  treatment  plant  (WWTP).  The  TFYP  also  requires  substantial  progress  in \n                                                 \n1  The Environmental Quality Standards have five classes for surface water quality based on their use. Class I is for \nwater resources and nationally protected bodies of water. Class II is for high-value fish production areas, Class A \nprotection areas, and spawning habitats for fish. Class III is for potable water resources, Class B protection areas, \ngeneral fish protection areas, and swimming areas. Class IV is for industrial water sources and noncontact \nrecreation areas. Class I water sources are the best in quality and Class V are the worst. ADB supported the \ndrafting of the 1996 amendments to the Water Pollution and Prevention Law under TA 2090-PRC (ADB. 2004. \nTechnical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Legislative Reform for Protecting the Environment and \nNatural Resources.

State Circular 1192, issued in September 1999, sets out clear policy directions on cost \nrecovery and institutional reform. Wastewater management is to be undertaken by enterprise \ncompanies. Wastewater tariffs should allow full cost recovery, although local governments can \nimplement tariff increases at a rate appropriate to local circumstances. Technical Assistance \n(TA) 3749-PRC: National Guidelines for Urban Wastewater Tariffs and Management Study, \nfunded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), assisted in drafting national guidelines for \nwastewater  tariffs.  Once  approved,  the  implementation  of  these  guidelines  will  (i)  improve \nwastewater cost recovery and efficiency, (ii) progressively reduce service provider reliance on \ngovernment subsidies, (iii) protect consumer rights, (iv) encourage multi-channel and private \nsector investment, and (v) promote water reuse and conservation. \n \nB.  Wastewater Management in the PRC \n \n6.  Progress in environmental management was made during the Ninth Five-Year Plan \n(1995\u20132000). By 1999, the discharge volume of major pollutants, including chemical oxygen \ndemand and petroleum-related products, had declined by 15\u201325% from 1995 levels. Much of \nthe progress was made in industrial pollution in line with Government policy to target major \npoint-source polluters first. Many polluting industries were closed down, while others invested in \non-site wastewater treatment. ADB supported some of those initiatives. By 2002, the PRC had \nan estimated 537 municipal WWTPs. \n \n7.   In 2003, 46 billion m3 of wastewater was generated. Growth in domestic3 wastewater \ngeneration (about 65% of the total) is outpacing the reductions in industrial wastewater (about \n35% of the total). Since about 40% of the domestic wastewater generated is treated, an annual \nvolume of around 18 billion m3 of wastewater is left untreated. In the absence of a municipal \nWWTP, a mixture of raw domestic wastewater and partially treated industrial wastewater is \ndischarged  from  the  municipal  sewer  into  the  nearest  body  of  water.  Designated  open \nwastewater ditches are still common in many cities. Municipal wastewater is a major contributor \nto the pollution of rivers and lakes, with the most severe pollution impacts in the water-short \nnorthern region of the country. \n \n8.  In regional and higher level cities, only 30% of rivers meet their designated water quality \nstandards\u2014half the objective of 60% in the TFYP. In seven major river basins,4 52% of rivers do \nnot meet the Class III standard required for sources of potable water. More than half the rivers \nin urban areas are the lowest quality standard (Class V) or below\u201416% are Class V standard, \nwhile 36% are worse than that. Eutrophication is occurring in three quarters of major fresh water \nlakes.  Surface  water  sources  serving  municipal  water  supply  systems  are  polluted  to \nunacceptable water quality standards. The water quality in groundwater aquifers is deteriorating. \nMuch more investment in collection systems and municipal WWTPs is needed. WWTPs are the \nkey  to  water  pollution  control,  since  the  industrial  treatment  plants  typically  only  pretreat \nwastewater to a low effluent standard before discharge into a municipal sewer. Social surveys \nsuggest that the urban population is becoming increasingly concerned about the impact of \nwastewater pollution. Although wastewater companies have been established in many cities, \nfew are financially or managerially autonomous, and tariff increases have been slow. \n \n                                                 \n3  Including residential, commercial, administration, and others. \n4   Changjiang, Haihe, Huaihe, Liaohe (Yangtze River), Huanghe, Songhuajiang, and Zhujiang (Yellow River). ", "  Appendix 2  25 \nC.  Urban Development and Wastewater Management in Fuzhou \n \n9.  The Fuzhou Urban Master Plan (FUMP: 1995\u20132010) is the blueprint for the physical, \neconomic, and social development of Fuzhou in the medium to long term. In approving the \nFUMP, the State Council supported the planned expansion of Fuzhou to cover Nantai Island, \nand  emphasized  that  municipal  wastewater  facilities  need  to  be  constructed  to  control \nwastewater discharges. To address the shortfall in wastewater facilities in the developed areas \nof Fuzhou, and to properly prepare for the development of Nantai Island, the FUMP includes \nfive WWTPs and associated sewer networks in Fuzhou, and a comprehensive inland creek \nrehabilitation program to improve the environment of Nantai Island. In addition, the Fuzhou \nmunicipal government (FMG) adopted a target of Class III for the Fuzhou stretch of the Min \nRiver in the Fuzhou Urban Master Plan. To meet the water quality target for the Min River and \ncomply with Government regulations to treat 70% of municipal wastewater by 2010, FMG is \nimplementing the Fuzhou Wastewater Master Plan. That plan divides the city into five drainage \nareas, and targets the dense urban areas for priority investment in a cost-effective approach. \nThe plan\u2019s water quality target is Class III for Min River and Class V or better for inland creeks. \n \n10.  Wastewater collected in the sewer networks will be treated in the relevant WWTPs, and \nthen discharged to the adjacent creeks. The Min River is the ultimate receiving water body of all \nthe inland creeks. With its large runoff flow and substantial dilution and self-purifying capacity, \nMin River\u2019s water quality in its trunk is better than Class III. However, a significant pollution belt \nhas  developed  near  shore  in  Min  River\u2019s  Fuzhou  urban  section  due  to  large  untreated \nwastewater discharges. This poses a threat to water quality and the ecological system of the \nMin River. One of the objectives for WWTP construction and creek rehabilitation is to eliminate \nthe pollution belt near shore, and to minimize its adverse impacts. To achieve the objectives of \nthe Project, FMG will ensure that the construction of the Lianban WWTP and Yangli WWTP \nPhase 2 are coordinated with project implementation. Though the Lianban WWTP and Yangli \nWWTP Phase 2 are not part of the ADB loan, they are closely related to the Project. Thus, the \nproject preparation for the two WWTPs has been closely coordinate with preparation for the \nProject. \n \n11.  The Yangli Phase 2 Sewer Networks will expand the service coverage for the Yangli \nPhase 1. The current coverage area is insufficient, limiting improvement in water quality and \nenvironmental protection. With the additional coverage from the Phase 2 sewer system, 90% of \nthe  urban  area  of  Fuzhou  will  be  served.  The  more  comprehensive  sewer  system  will \naccommodate the existing wastewater generation as well as the wastewater generated by \nfuture urban development.  \n \n12.   The  Nantai  Island  Creek  Rehabilitation  Project,  a  priority  component  of  the  urban \nmaster development strategy, is a prerequisite for developing Nantai Island. Fuzhou plans to \ndevelop Nantai Island as a high-tech park, business center, and high-class housing and tourism \nareas.  As  a  clean  environment  is  needed  for  such  development,  specific  environmental \nobjectives have been established. Inland creek rehabilitation is a prerequisite for implementing \nthese construction plans and achieving these environmental objectives. The Lianban Sewer \nNetwork will provide central Nantai Island with a better wastewater service system, and ensure \nthat  rehabilitated  creeks  could  achieve  environmental  protection  targets  and  water  quality \nstandards. These two project components will be coordinated closely to achieve the objectives \nof water quality improvement and flood control capability. \n \n13.  Table A2 shows the progress of the five WWTPs for the drainage areas that make up \nthe Fuzhou Urban Master Plan. Although the plan is well underway, additional investment is \n ", "26  Appendix 2 \nneeded. The Project will help in funding two wastewater collection systems, and implementing \nfurther tariff and enterprise reform. Under the Project, 20% of wastewater will be collected and \ntreated,  bringing  the  overall  treatment  rate  to  65%  by  2009.  The  Project  will  support  the \nimplementation  of  other  investments  by  reforming  tariffs  and  assisting  Fuzhou  Water \nEnvironment Construction and Development Company and Fuzhou Urban Visual Construction \nDevelopment  Company  in  achieving  financial  and  corporate  autonomy.  Tariff  reform  is  an \nessential  element  of  building  an  enabling  environment  for  private  sector  investment  in \nwastewater treatment. \n \nTable A2: Fuzhou Wastewater Master Plan, Wastewater Treatment Plant Implementation  \n \nPlant  Drainage  WWTP Capacity WWTP    Completion  \nNo.  Area  (m3/day)  Status  Funding   Date \n1  Xiangban  50,000  In operation  FMG  1996 \n2  Yangli Phase 1  200,000  In operation  ADB  2003 \n3  Jinshan    50,000  In operation  BOT  2004 \n4  Yangli Phase 2  100,000  Under preparation   FMG  2008/9 \n5  Lianban  150,000  Under preparation  BOT  2008/9 \n           \nADB = Asian Development Bank, BOT = build-operate-transfer, FMG = Fuzhou municipal government, m3 = cubic \nmeters, No. = number, WWTP = wastewater treatment plant.   \nSource: FMG project management office, February 2005. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 3  27 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE FUNDED BY THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK \n \nNo.  Name  Date of  Loan Amount \nApproval  ($ million) \nA.

Background and Rationale \n  \n1.  Lack  of  facilities  and  poor  hygiene  contribute  to  the  health  problems  of  the  poor. \nImproved sanitation and knowledge of hygiene contribute to better livelihoods, especially for the \npoor and vulnerable groups. Despite these clear benefits, hygiene promotion and education is \naccorded a low priority compared with other livelihood needs. The key objective of the Fuzhou \nEnvironmental Improvement Project (the Project) is to improve living conditions and the public \nhealth of 1.85 million people, of which 7% are categorized as urban poor in Fuzhou City. One of \nthe project components is the rehabilitation of the Nantai Island inland creek system. The \nsystem\u2019s 40 or more inland creeks play major roles as drainage systems for sewerage and \nrainstorms. All of them discharge into the Min River. As Nantai Island lacks a centralized \nwastewater treatment facility, all domestic and industrial wastewater is discharged directly into \nthe nearest creek. Most households along the creeks dump their solid waste into creeks, which \ncreates more pollution. This pollution has caused the deterioration of the water quality in the Min \nRiver. Water quality in these creeks is worse than the lowest national standard (Class V). \nRehabilitating the system of creeks and upgrading the environment are prerequisites for the \nenvironmentally  sustainable  development  of  the  island.  To  maximize  the  project  benefits, \nparticularly to the urban poor, a hygiene educational program is needed. This pilot program will \ncover 50 villages on Nantai Island, benefiting 2,000 households.   \n \nB.  Objectives \n \n2.  The objectives of the program are to (i) improve public awareness among the urban \nhouseholds, particularly the poor, of the benefits of improved household-level hygiene and \nsanitation practices; and (ii) facilitate the participation of all stakeholders, particularly urban poor \nand women, in managing and maintaining clean river programs. \n \nC.  Scope of Work and Description of Activities \n \n3.  The scope of work includes (i) assessing and consulting with the urban poor on their \nneeds, constraints, and awareness of hygiene and sanitation practices; (ii) developing public \nawareness programs, including printed materials, for encouraging household-level sanitation \npractices; (iii) training-of-trainers for community leaders to conduct awareness campaigns at the \nhouseholds level, and become involved actively in the Project\u2019s planning, implementation, and \nfollow-up; (iv) developing monitoring programs to assess the impact of the program on the \nriver\u2019s  quality,  household\u2019s  hygiene  and  sanitation  quality,  and  community  participation  in \nimproving the quality of  water and sanitation; and (v) documenting the results of the pilot \nprogram. \n \nD.  Implementation Schedule and Institutional Management Arrangements \n \n4.  The pilot program will be conducted intermittently for 6 months following approval of the \nloan  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  the  Fuzhou  Environmental  Improvement \nProject.  The  Fuzhou  municipal  government  is  the  Executing  Agency.  The  Fuzhou  Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s Project Management Office and Nantai Island Inland Creek Management \nCompany will be implementing agencies, supported by the Fuzhou Environmental Protection \n ", "30  Appendix 4 \nBureau. These agencies will work closely with village committees, village women\u2019s committees, \nand other community-based organizations in the project area. \n \nE.  Expected Results (Outputs, Outcomes, and Impacts) \n \n5.  The key anticipated outputs are a model hygiene awareness program and a community-\nbased household solid waste collection service that is self-sustaining. Anticipated outcomes \ninclude (i) improved awareness among urban households of managing clean water sources, \nhygiene, and sanitation; and (ii) a partnership between the local government and communities \nto maintain river quality. \n \n6.  Measurable  Performance  Indicators.  Qualitative  and  quantitative  indicators  will \ndetermine the performance and effectiveness of the program. The qualitative monitoring and \nevaluation, which will be done through interviews and focus group discussions, will address (i) \nthe effectiveness in achieving the objectives of the program; (ii) the program\u2019s success in \nincreasing the capacity of targeted communities to mobilize action to sustain rivers and improve \nwater quality; (iii) the heightened awareness of environmental problems affecting the creeks and \nthe water environment due to social and cultural causes; and (iv) the dialogue among key \nstakeholders\u2014particularly local governments, communities, and the private sector\u2014concerning \nsustainable development and the use of creeks and water. Quantitative results will include (i) 5\u2013\n10 creeks on Nantai Island that are cleaner with better water quality; (ii) 80 community leaders \n(half men and half women) becoming hygiene promoters; and (iii) 2,000 households attending \nthe hygiene education program and community-based solid waste disposal service program. \n \n7.  Stakeholder Participation. Municipal level government  officials, village committees, \ncommunity members (particularly urban poor and women), and community-based organizations \nwill play key roles in designing and implementing the pilot activities through a participatory \nprocess. The pilot model will demonstrate that community or user participation makes services, \nand service providers, more responsive and accountable to beneficiaries.    \n \n8.  Scope for Replication. An independent consultant will assess the applicability of this \nmodel to other regions in the People\u2019s Republic of China through the monitoring and evaluation \nphases. Flyers, booklets, and a video will be produced for educational campaign in schools and \ncommunities around Fuzhou.  \n \n9.  Cost Estimates. The pilot demonstration is estimated to cost $50,000. The Government \nand community will provide in-kind contributions, such as office space, community halls, full-\ntime staff, technical expertise, and local transportation. \n ", "  Appendix 5  31 \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n ($ million) \n \n Foreign Exchange Cost   Local Currency Cost  \nItem    ADB  FMG  FMG  Loan  Total \nA.

Financial Management Assessment \n \n1.  The Yangli Wastewater Treatment Plant Construction Company was established in 1997 \nas a state-owned company under the Company Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \nIn  June  2004,  its  name  was  changed  to  Fuzhou  Water  Environment  Construction  and \nDevelopment Company (FWECDC). As a wholly owned social benefit company of the Fuzhou \nmunicipal government (FMG), FWECDC operates like a nonprofit organization. Services were \nfunded  through  tax  revenue,  with  users  paying  minimal  or  no  charges.  However,  the \nGovernment has made a fundamental shift over the past decade towards a market-based \napproach in the delivery of infrastructure services and a more integrated approach to urban \nmanagement. Although, wastewater companies have been established in many cities, few are \nfinancially or managerially autonomous, and tariff increases have been slow. Accordingly, state-\nowned companies, such as FWECDC, need to evaluate their capability and identify deficiencies \nin their management to meet the needs of a company that is being redirected from a social \nbenefit company to a commercially operated and viable enterprise.  \n \n2.  An  assessment  of  FWECDC  was  conducted  using  individual  interviews  and \nquestionnaires with management to determine the capability to meet the future operational \ndemands. Deficiencies with FWECDC were noted during the assessment. As with other state-\nowned  companies  in  the  PRC,  management  was  appointed  from  within  the  Government \nbureaucracy. As such, management is oriented like a Government department. Despite earning \nrevenue, FWECDC will receive budgetary appropriations for its operations and maintenance \nexpenses, including debt service. FWECDC does not directly receive wastewater tariffs, which \nare channeled through the Fuzhou Municipal Finance Bureau. FWECDC\u2019s management setup \nis not conducive to operating the company as a commercially viable enterprise. Assistance is \nneeded to improve internal processes and procedures, both operational and administrative. Key \npersonnel  also  need  to  be  trained  in  operational  efficiency  and  converting  construction \ncompanies, such as FWECDC, into a fully operating commercial company. Thus, a corporate \ndevelopment plan was formulated for inclusion during project implementation to help FWECDC \ndevelop into a more financially and managerially independent enterprise. 1 \n \nB.  Summary Corporate Development Plan \n \n1.  Corporate Objectives \n \n3.   FWECDC\u2019s objectives are to (i) become a commercially owned and efficiently managed \nenterprise;  (ii)  set  financial  targets  that  will  make  FWECDC  a  viable  and  self-sustaining \nenterprise; and (iii) provide a high level of service to customers in Fuzhou. \n \n2.  Organizational Structure \n \n4.  FWECDC will adopt the proposed organizational structure shown in Figure A9 after its \nincorporation as a limited liability company, in accordance with the Company Law of the PRC. \nKey highlights of the organizational changes are as follows: \n \n                                                 \n1  The corporate development plan is Supplementary Appendix A and is available on request.  ", "  Appendix 9  37 \n5.   A board of directors will be constituted to provide guidance in setting the policies that will \ngovern the operations of the company. The board will elect a chairman from among its members \nbased upon knowledge and experience of the industry and a proven senior management track \nrecord. A three-member supervisory board will supervise the actions of the board of directors \nand manager to ensure that these conform to the laws, administrative rules and regulations, and \narticles of association of the company. The board will appoint the general manager, who will \npossess a high level of management experience in a large customer-oriented utilities business. \n \n6.  To comply with international corporate governance rules, FWECDC will constitute an \naudit committee whose members will have qualifications and experience acceptable to ADB \nbefore  the  last  disbursement  of  the  loan.  All  members  of  the  audit  committee  will  be \nindependent of FWECDC\u2019s management, and free from any business or any other relationship \nwith FWECDC that could interfere with their independent judgment. The audit committee will \nensure that an internal audit, control and inspection unit is created and staffed by certified public \naccountants with experience in large utility companies, such as water supply companies. \n \n3.  Training for Senior Management \n \n7.  The general manager, who will have the necessary technical expertise, will be required \nto attend specialized training at a university in the PRC or abroad to gain knowledge on general \nmanagement, marketing, finance, and financial reporting. A capacity building program focusing \non cross-functional areas of management also will be designed for division and department \nheads. The training program will cover (i) corporate governance, (ii) financial knowledge, (iii) \nbusiness knowledge, and (iv) strategy knowledge. ADB and the consultants will discuss the \ndetails of the training program. Once the design of the program is completed, it will be submitted \nto ADB for its approval. \n \n4.  Management Reports and Accounts \n \n8.  The board will implement a management information system that will provide all levels of \nmanagement with the information needed to undertake their duties effectively and efficiently. \nThe board also will introduce corporate reporting procedures that will comply with international \npractice and satisfy ADB requirements. Monthly, quarterly, and annual reports will be prepared \nto support the management of the day-to-day operations and to identify problems. The general \nmanager will hold monthly management committee meetings. Financial statements that provide \nthe basic cumulative information on the key business and performance indicators throughout the \nyear will be prepared for the company\u2019s annual report to shareholders. \n \n9.  Budget and control procedures, including the quarterly reporting on variations, also will \nbe designed. Annual budgets will be prepared by department and by category of expenditure \nand/or. Budget review statements will be prepared and submitted to the budget control review \nmeetings. Guidelines for the procurement of materials, supplies, and equipment and services \nwill  be  developed  to  ensure  that  all  procurement  and  purchasing  comply  with  accepted \ninternational practice, and are supported by a documented decision and approval trail that is \nacceptable for audit purposes. This will safeguard the company against possible overpricing, \ntheft through ghost deliveries, and corruption that will affect corporate performance.   \n     \n ", "38  Appendix 9 \nFigure A9: Proposed Organization Chart \n \n \n \n   \n  Board of Directors  Supervisory \n  Board \n  \n \n \n \nAudit \n    Committee \n  General Manager \n \n   \nInternal Control \n \nand Inspection \n \n \n \n \nMana gement  Administration  Finance  Engineering and  Legal \nInfor mation  Department  Department  Operations  Department \nSys tem  Department \n \n \n \nHuman  Public  Engineering and  Operations \nResource  Relations  Maintenance  Division \nDivision\nFinance  Accounting  Mechanical and  Plant \nDivision  Division  Electrical  Operations \nSection\nCredit and \nCollection \nSection \nCivil \nEngineering and \nMaintenance \nSection ", "  Appendix 10  39 \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n \n1.  The  Fuzhou  Environmental  Improvement  Project  (the  Project)  has  three  physical \ninfrastructure components: Yangli Sewer Network, Lianban Sewer Network, and Nantai Island \nInland Creeks Rehabilitation. Their construction will require land acquisition and displacement of \nhousing.  A  resettlement  plan  (RP)  has  been  prepared  for  each  component.  In  addition,  two \nassociated wastewater treatment projects (WWTPs) are planned. Due diligence has been carried \nout for the Yangli WWTP Phase II, because the land for the site was acquired as part of Phase I, \nwhich the Asian Development Bank (ADB) partly financed. A resettlement framework has been \nprepared for the planned Lianban WWTP, which will be constructed as a build-operate-transfer \n(BOT) project. The RPs are designed to ensure that the affected persons (APs) will be better off, or \nat least not worse-off, as a result of the Project. \n \n2.  The impacts of the Project are summarized in Table A10.1. The APs include urban and \nrural residents, legal and non-legal owners of plots and structures, renters and tenants, poor \npeople, and permanent and temporary employees. No indigenous people or ethnic minorities will \nbe adversely affected by the Project. \n \nTable A10.1:  Summary of the Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts by the Project \n  Permanent Land    Affected Household and Population   \nAcquisition   Temporary  by House Demolishment  Area of \n(ha)  Land  Affected \n      Acquisition      Agricultural  Houses \nComponents  Total  Farmland   (ha)  Households  Population Population  (m2) \nYangli Sewers    0.00  0.00  6.06  25  109    3,583 \nLianban Sewers  1.02   0.34  2.11  19  78  29  2,566 \nNantai Island   73.79  22.55  0.00  1,104  4,858  3,636   191,081 \nInland Creeks \n  Total  74.81  22.89  8.17  1,148  5,045  3,665  197,230 \nha =  hectare, m2 = square meters, WWTP = wastewater treatment plant. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n3.  The  Fuzhou  Water  Environment  Construction  and  Development  Company  (FWECDC), \nwhich is responsible for the construction and operation of the Yangli and Lianban sewer networks, \nwill manage land acquisition and resettlement (LAR). The Fuzhou Urban Visual Construction and \nDevelopment Company (FUVCDC) is responsible for the rehabilitation of the Nantai inland creeks. \nLAR activities for some sections will be carried out by the Fuzhou Municipal Land Development \nCenter (FMLDC), which is redeveloping new urban zones. For the Lianban WWTP, a RP will be \nprepared in accordance with the resettlement framework, and submitted to the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) for approval before land acquisition. The Fuzhou Key Projects Office, under the \nFuzhou municipal government (FMG), will implement the RP. For all project components, efforts \nwere made to avoid or minimize resettlement impacts by consulting with local officials and village \ncommittees and/or street committees. FMG will make available the funding for the LAR to be \nimplemented by these agencies. \n \n4.  Based  on  the  consultations  with  local  governments  and  APs,  and  general  practice  in \nFuzhou, a set of fair standards for land and housing compensation was adopted. The APs have \nbeen notified about the key elements of the resettlement plans during meetings, interviews, focus \ngroup discussions, and public consultation workshops. Moreover, the APs have participated in the \nplanning and design of the RP. Resettlement information booklets have been distributed to the \nAPs. The complete RPs have been made available at village offices and resident committees, as \n ", "40  Appendix 10 \nwell as posted on the ADB  website.1 The project management office will establish a project \nresettlement office (PRO) to continue public information activities and respond to any questions or \ngrievances. \n \n5.  Compensation for land acquisition, residential housing relocation, and enterprise impacts \nwill be paid to all users with or without legal papers. People losing housing will receive direct \ncompensation based on replacement value of their lost structures or new houses. Most of the rural \nhouseholds will be resettled within their own villages, provided with a new housing site free of \ncharge, and connected with essential infrastructure. Relocated urban households will be given \ncash compensation that is sufficient to purchase a replacement house or apartment in the project \narea. People losing residential housing should find alternative accommodation before they are \ndisplaced. Relocated enterprises and shops will be provided with cash compensation covering lost \nstructures, lost wages, lost profit, and an alternative site for reconstruction. For most affected \nenterprises,  employment  will  not  be  impacted.  For  the  relocated  enterprises,  the  affected \nemployees can be reemployed by the same enterprise and shops. Local government will ensure \nthat lost wages are paid to affected workers, and that all have been reemployed. Some economic \nrehabilitation  measures  are  planned:  (i)  jobs will  be  provided  during  project  construction  and \noperational phases, (ii) FWECDC and FUVCDC will arrange for some APs to be employed in local \nenterprises  and  businesses,  and  (iii)  village  committees  will  provide  land  redistribution  and \nagricultural extension  services  to  APs.  FMG,  FWECDC,  FUVCDC,  and  local  government  will \nprovide  necessary  assistance  for  house  construction  and  relocation  during  resettlement \nimplementation. Moreover, the government economy rental houses will be provided to them, as \nwell as the provision of a loan for purchasing a house from the municipal housing sponsor agency. \n \n6.  The PROs within FWECDC and FUVCDC have the lead responsibility for coordinating the \nplanning, implementation, financing, and monitoring of the LAR. Working closely with relevant \ntownship and village officials, the PROs will be responsible for delivering entitlements, selecting \nnew  housing  sites,  and  monitoring  development  of  replacement  land  and  other  economic \nmeasures  among  affected  and  host  villages.  To  ensure  that  the  PROs  and  township  and \nvillage/street committees can properly and smoothly handle the LAR, a training program will be \norganized for the PRO officers. The grievance address procedures are well established, and \nexplanations are included in the resettlement information booklets provided to all APs, enterprises \nand villages.  \n \n7.  The preliminary cost estimate for the LAR program is about $46.36 million, equivalent to \nCNY384.8 million in 2004 prices, including contingencies. The resettlement cost for the Nantai \nIsland Inland Creek Rehabilitation Project is $44.42 million, accounting for about 96% of the land \nacquisition and resettlement cost of the Project. Resettlement implementation will be scheduled in \nstages to coincide with the project construction schedule between 2005 and 2009. However, \nconstruction will not take place before the APs are moved and land is acquired. Each village, \nneighborhood, and enterprise will be measured in detail. After that, the compensation contracts will \nbe negotiated and signed. \n \n8.  The implementation of the RPs will be monitored internally and externally, according to \nmethodologies specified in the RP. The PROs will handle internal supervision and monitoring to \nensure compliance with the provisions of the RPs. FMG has agreed to a set of supervision \nmilestones  with  ADB  to  ensure  timely  and  effective  implementation  of  resettlement  activities. \nQualified independent agencies under contract to FWECDC and FUVCDC will handle external \nmonitoring. \n                                                 \n1 Available as Supplementary Appendix B.

Links to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a National Priority in    Sector identified as a National Priority in   \nCountry Poverty Analysis?     Yes  Country Poverty Partnership Agreement?     Yes \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC):  \n \nProvision of clean water and improvement in sanitation will reduce pollution in open urban waterways, improve living \nconditions, and decrease the incidence of waterborne diseases. Flood protection, through improvements to the inland \ncreeks and associated pumping facilities, will create a better living environment for the residents, particularly the poor \nliving along the waterways in Fuzhou. Increasing employment by encouraging the development of new high-\ntechnology enterprises is at the core of the strategy for developing infrastructure on Nantai Island and promoting \nsustainable development in Fuzhou. The Project supports poverty reduction directly and indirectly through job \ncreation and promotion of sustainable economic development in areas where the poor are particularly likely to gain, \nsuch as tourism development. Due to their higher vulnerability to pollution, the poor will benefit from improvement in \nliving conditions and environmental quality. The Project will support the achievement of the Millennium Development \nGoal (MDG) for environmental sustainability (MDG Goal 7), and to half the proportion of people without sustainable \naccess to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015 (MDG targets 10 and 11). \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                         Proposed Classification: General intervention \n \nThe Project will benefit an urban population of 1.85 million through the provision clean water and improved sanitation. \nWithin the beneficiary population, about 109,700 persons (or 7.7%) are classified as poor, according to the weighted \naverage local urban poverty line of CNY2,640 per year. The Project will provide 6,648 person-years of employment \nopportunities during construction, of which the poor will fill an estimated 2,600 person-years. The Project has \nprioritized 40% of these jobs for the poor. Project operations will create 40 full-time permanent jobs for the poor. \nProject-related services, such as procurement of construction materials and equipment, will provide an additional \n3,420  person-years  of  employment.  Those  temporarily  employed  in  construction  operations  will  benefit  from \nadditional training and experience that will provide them with opportunities in planned infrastructure construction. The \nProject will improve sewage services and sanitary conditions, contribute to a reduction in morbidity and mortality rates \nof waterborne diseases, and savings in associated medical costs and loss of working days. The common waterborne \ndiseases in Fuzhou include hepatitis and dysentery. Research by the Central South Hospital of Wuhan University \nconcluded that each case of hepatitis or dysentery results in CNY480 of direct medical costs, and 30 days of lost \nworking time. The loss of agricultural production can be reduced through the improved quality of irrigation water. \nImproving water quality from Class V to Class III will support the development of the water-based tourism industry, \nproviding another source of employment in the local communities. The Project will support an increase in visitors by \n260,000 per year and a revenue increase of CNY350 million per year from tourism. Women and the poor will benefit \nfrom the tourism, as they make up a large proportion of tourism operators and vendors. Less pollution and improved \nwater quality of the receiving water bodies will lower the cost of treatment for Fuzhou\u2019s existing and future water \nsupply plants, which will be passed on to the consumers. Socioeconomic losses from severe water logging and \nflooding can be prevented. Flooding causes about CNY146.22 million of industrial and/or commercial, agricultural, \nand private property losses once every 5 years. The Project will help avoid these losses. The poor, women, children, \nand elderly are vulnerable to flooding and water logging. The improved environment will contribute to a better \natmosphere for investment. However, increases in the fees for water and wastewater treatment might harm the poor. \nHowever, this impact is expected to be minimal, given that each household pays a small percentage (1.4% of their \ntotal income) for water supply and wastewater treatment services. To protect the poor, the Fuzhou Municipal Civil \nAffairs Bureau operates a social support program for the lowest income bracket households,  which includes \nassistance in paying water, wastewater, and other utility charges.  \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nStakeholder Analysis: Project planning and design involved qualitative and quantitative analyses directly involving \nproject beneficiaries. These analyses used participatory methods to identify the local poor population and the \nprovisions that might meet their needs better. Public consultation and/or participation was an element of the project \ndesign  and  planning.  Participatory  rapid  appraisal  involved  beneficiaries  and  affected  people.  A  community \nparticipation and awareness program will be formulated and implemented to serve as an ongoing consultation \nmechanism with the involvement of all stakeholders. \n \nParticipation  Strategy:  Consultation  with  people  affected  by  the  Project  will  continue  throughout  project \nimplementation. Consultations will be carried out regularly to ensure that the Fuzhou Project Management Office, \nFuzhou Water Environment Construction and Development Company, and Fuzhou Urban Visual Construction and \n ", "42  Appendix 11 \nDevelopment Company understand and address the evolving needs and expectations of the users. Consultations \nalso will help increase public awareness of the Project and increase the social acceptance of user fees and charges. \nPublic awareness and health education campaigns will be carried out. The consultations can take the form of annual \nquestionnaire  surveys  by  consumer  category,  combined  with  ad  hoc  community  forums.  Public  information \nmechanisms will include information programs on local television, radio, newsletters, websites, and community \nmeetings. Because  women\u2019s organizations and schools have extensive networks, they  will used to distribute \ninformation and survey questionnaires. The Fuzhou municipal government will undertake the public information \ncampaign\u2014the Clean River Program for Urban Poor in Nantai Island\u2014by using participatory approaches to maximize \nthe project benefits, particularly for the urban poor. \n \nD.   Gender Development \n \nStrategy to Maximize Impacts on Women: \n \nTo maximize the project benefits, women will be given priority for jobs generated by the Project. Women\u2019s needs and \ninterests also will be represented in the project implementation. About 40% of the jobs will be filled by women and the \npoor. Women will be mobilized to play a role in the public awareness and education program of the Project. The \npublic awareness and education program of the Project and the Clean River Program for Urban Poor in Nantai Island \nwill promote the participation of women in managing and maintaining proposed clean river programs on Nantai Island. \nParticular attention will be paid to women during resettlement. A special social development fund will be provided to \nhouseholds headed by women and affected by the Project. \n \nE.

General  \n \n1.  The financial analysis of the Fuzhou Environmental Improvement Project (the Project) \nwas carried out in real terms. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for the Project was \ncalculated on an after-tax basis, covering the 4 years of construction for Yangli Phase 1, the \nproposed 5 years of construction for Yangli Phase 2 and Lianban, followed by 20 years of \noperation. A residual value of 15% of capital investment was taken into account. The Nantai \nIsland Inland Creek Rehabilitation Project was not analyzed, because it is not a revenue-\ngenerating project, and will continue to be maintained by the Fuzhou municipal government \n(FMG) from budgetary appropriations. \n \nB.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n2.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $185.50 million, including $55.80 million in \nforeign exchange costs (30%) to be funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Other \nfunding requirements will be met by FMG contribution (55%) and domestic borrowing (15%). \n \nC.  Tariffs and Cost Recovery \n \n3.  The Fuzhou Municipal Water Supply Company collects wastewater tariffs, which are \ncharged on top of the water tariffs based on actual water consumed. All households connected \nto the water supply system are charged wastewater tariffs whether they are connected to the \nsewerage systems or not. The wastewater tariffs currently being charged to users are assumed \nto cover the cost of collection and treatment. The Fuzhou Municipal Finance Bureau collects \nand manages wastewater revenues, and provides a budgetary allocation to Fuzhou Water \nEnvironment Construction and Development Company (FWECDC) to finance operational costs \nand service the debt. \n \nD.  Financial Evaluation \n4.  The real weighted average cost of capital (WACC) was calculated to be 2.6% for the \ncombined Yangli Phase 2 and Lianban Sewer projects (Table A13.1).1 The nominal costs of \nfunds were assumed to be 5.3% (as of February 2005) for the ADB loan, based on the 10-year \nfixed  swap  rate  London  interbank  offered  rate  plus  the  ADB  spread  0.60%.  For  equity \ncontributions by FMG, it was assumed at 8%. Nominal costs were adjusted for tax and inflation. \n \nTable A13.1:  Weighted Average Cost of Capital \nNominal  After  Real   Weighted  \nAmount   Amount   Inflation \nSource   Percent Interest  Tax  Cost  Component \n(CNY million)  ($ million)  (%) \nRate (%) (%)  (%)  of WACC (%)\n  ADB Loan               305.9               37.0  42.3  5.3  3.5  2.4  1.1  0.5 \n    Fuzhou Municipal    \n    Government              277.8               33.6  38.5  8.0  8.0  3.0  5.0  1.9 \n    Domestic Loan             138.7               16.8  19.2  6.1  4.1  3.0  1.1  0.2 \n Total          722.4               87.4  100.0           \n Real WACC                      2.6 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, WACC = weighted average cost of capital. \nSource:  ADB estimates. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB.

Summary  \n \n1.  The  economic  analysis  was  undertaken  using  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nguidelines.1  The  analysis  draws  from  an  ADB  paper, Economic  Issues  in  the  Design  and \nAnalysis of a Wastewater Treatment Project  which looks at the specific characteristics of \nwastewater projects, and sets out the importance of considering any proposed wastewater \nproject as \u201cone small part in a greater system to manage ambient water quality.\u201d It recommends \nan approach to economic analysis that is more appropriate for most wastewater management \nprojects than standard benefit-cost analysis.2 The basic concept is that if standards and targets \nfor ambient quality water appear well founded, reasonable, and partly driven by social choice, \nas long as the mechanisms for monitoring and enforcement are in place, then the economic \napproach to meeting those targets is one of least cost. \n \n2.  This analysis considers the proposed Fuzhou Environmental Improvement Project (the \nProject) as an integrated part of an ongoing city, municipal, and basin-wide environmental \nprogram, rather than as a stand-alone investment. As such, environmental goals are achieved \njointly  with  other  policies  and  investments.  The  economic  analysis  provides  an  in-depth \neconomic rationale based on policy, sector, and local area analysis. Further, it examines the \nleast  cost  approach  to  achieving  environmental  objectives.  This  analysis  purports  that  the \nestablished  plans  are  a  reasonable  approach  to  managing  environmental  protection  and \nambient water quality, and to planning for sustainable urban development. The analysis shows \nthat the Project is a critical component of those established plans, and represents a least cost \napproach to achieving incremental improvements in environmental quality. Although limited in \nscope, the Project showed reasonable support through public participation in the planning \nprocess, and through consultations under the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA). \n \nB.  Policies, Targets, Urban and Environmental Planning \n \n3.  The environmental policy of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) takes a cost-effective \napproach  to  pollution  control  and  wastewater  management  through  specific  treatment  rate \ntargets and required water quality standards for water bodies. Major point-source polluters were \ntargeted first followed by major centers of population, which is the current focus. Guidelines \nfrom the Ministry of Construction set more stringent targets than the Tenth Five-Year Plan \n(TFYP), requiring major cities, including Fuzhou, to treat 70% of wastewater by 2010. The Min \nRiver Basin Plan establishes the water quality requirement for the Fuzhou stretch of the Min \nRiver as Class III. As part of a national program to expedite wastewater management plans, a \ntarget city treatment rate of 70% seems reasonable. The Class III requirement for the Min River, \nthe source of the city\u2019s water supply, is in line with PRC requirements for potable water sources. \n \n4.  At the city level, the Fuzhou municipal government has adapted the planning process to \nthe enormous challenges presented by rapid urbanization and economic growth. Over the past \ndecade, population has doubled and gross domestic product has increased sevenfold. Urban \nplanning and economic development in the city is based on the TFYP (2000\u20132005), while the \n                                                 \n1  These include Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects, Guidebook for the Economic Analysis of Water \nSupply Projects, and Economic Analysis Guidelines for Urban Development Projects. \n2  The analysis, therefore, does not include valuation of benefits or the calculation of an economic internal rate of \nreturn (EIRR). \n ", "46  Appendix 13 \nFuzhou Urban Master Plan (FUMP: 1995-2010)3 provides strategic direction and detailed plans \nshort term to 2000 and long term to 2010. The FUMP is a comprehensive document covering all \naspects of urban planning. In line with state policy, the master planning process has a built-in \nreview, assess, and revise procedure, which includes academics and representatives of the \npublic as well as Government officials. The Municipal People\u2019s Council and State Council \napproved the FUMP in 1999.4 The guiding principles of the FUMP seem reasonable, forward \nthinking, and in line with the concept of sustainable economic development.5   \n \n5.  The FUMP identifies the environmental problems associated with such rapid growth and \nunderscores the need to protect water resources. Addressing the water pollution in the Min \nRiver  is  a  high  priority.  The  FUMP  identifies  a  series  of  short-term  actions  to  halt  the \ndeterioration of water quality, and long-term actions to improve it. For wastewater and water \nresources protection, the plan rightly designates water resources protection zones for more \nstringent  environmental  controls  and  targets  point-source  polluters  first  as  the  most  cost-\neffective  approach  to  improving  ambient  water  quality.  Discussions  with  Fuzhou  Municipal \nEnvironmental  Protection  Bureau  (FMEPB)  indicate  that  monitoring  and  enforcement  is \neffective, and much has been achieved to date. Evidence demonstrates that many of the priority \nactions have already been taken. \n \nC.  Inland River Pollution, Wastewater Planning, and the Proposed Project \n \n6.  Plans for reticulation systems and wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) described in the \nFUMP  were  recently  updated  in  a  special  planning  document.6  The  investment  program \nprioritizes drainage areas, making best use of existing sewer networks first. The program is \nintegrated well, and coordinated with, improvements in existing and developing urban areas. \nThe proposed subprojects are key components of these plans. Components A and B of the \nProject provide the collection systems required to convey wastewater to the proposed additional \nWWTP. Without the project systems, two new WWTPs (funded by third parties) cannot become \noperational and the goal of treating 70% of wastewater will not be met. \n \n7.  Plans for inland rehabilitation in the FUMP are clear regarding the overall objectives for \nenvironmental and water quality improvements, though less precise in terms of priorities. In \npractice,  the  priorities  are  clear  and  well  coordinated  with  urban  development  and  the \ninvestment plans for wastewater. Of the 31 inland creeks on Nantai Island, eight have been \nrehabilitated. They were part of the Jinshan drainage area, which recently completed networks \nand WWTP. The 13 creeks to be rehabilitated under the Project are part of drainage areas that \nalready have collection and treatment systems, or will have new systems provided under the \nProject. The remaining 10 rivers have been given a lower priority, because they are in different \ndrainage areas or targeted for urban development at a later date. \n \nD.  Least Cost Approach to Project Design and Average Economic Cost Analysis \n \n8.  In addition to effective and appropriate prioritization, the Project design of the sewer \nnetworks and the inland creek rehabilitation program considered capital and operational cost, as \nwell as technical and implementation issues, to provide the most cost-effective solution. The \n                                                 \n3  Fuzhou Municipal Government. 1998. Fuzhou Urban Master Plan, Explanation 1995\u20132010. Fuzhou, PRC. The plan \nis based on GNP growth of 15% per annum 2001\u20132010. \n4  PRC Urban Planning Law, 26 December 1989. \n5  This reference refers to the balancing of social, environmental and economic objectives - one of the cornerstones \nof sustainability. The concept of sustainability also implies a degree of public participation in the planning and \ndecision making process, which is addressed through the review and approval procedure. \n6  Special Wastewater Plan of Fuzhou City to 2020, December 2002, approved by the State Council but only to 2010. ", "  Appendix 13  47 \ndesign of the systems (i) limits resettlement, where possible; (ii) minimizes pumping to reduce \noperations costs; and (iii) optimizes sewer layouts to achieve minimum disruption and least cost \nin laying sewers, while maintaining maximum flexibility for expansion. \n \n9.  The  estimated  average  economic  cost  of  each  of  the  four  drainage  areas  (five \ninvestment  projects)  was  analyzed.  The  analysis  used  a  simplified  approach  based  on \nannualized  capital;  operation,  maintenance,  and  management  costs;  and  an  economic \nopportunity cost of capital of 12%. Table A14 summarizes the results by investment project, \nwhile Figure A14 shows average economic cost (AEC) per unit of wastewater treated.   \n \nTable A14: Summary Results of Average Economic Cost by Investment Project  \n(CNY/m3) \nInvestment Project  AEC Treatment  AEC Network  AEC \nXiangban  1.7  1.7  3.4 \nYangli Phase 1  0.8  1.7  2.5 \nJinshan  1.0  1.7  2.7 \nYangli Phase 2  1.4  1.4  2.8 \nLianban  1.1  0.9  2.0 \nAEC/m3 Treated  1.1  1.4  2.6 \nAEC/m3 Total Flow  1.0  0.8  1.8 \nAEC = average economic cost, CNY = yuan, m3 = cubic meters.  \nSources:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nFigure A14: Average Economic Cost of Wastewater Treated in Fuzhou City \n4.00\n3.50\n3\n3 m 3.00\nmB/\nY/M\nNR\nCost CCost   2.50\nc c \nmimi 2.00\noo\nnn\noo Total\ncc\nEE 1.50 (Treatment and\nge ge  Reticulation)\naa\nAverAver 1.00 L(Tinreeaatrm (Teontta alnd\nReticulation))\n0.50\n-\n- 100,000 200,000 300,000 400,000 500,000 600,000\nFuzhou City - Volume of Wastewater Treated (m3/day)\n \n  m3 = cubic meter \n  Source:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n ", "48  Appendix 13 \n10.  Estimates of the unit cost of reticulation and treatment illustrate economies of scale.  \nAlthough unit rates for individual systems vary according to procurement method, size, and \ntechnical considerations, the system AEC gradually declines as the treatment rate in the city \nincreases from CNY3.4 per cubic meter (m3) treated for the first 50,000 m3/day to CNY2.6/m3 at \n550,000m3/day. For the Project, the AEC of reticulation was ranged CNY0.9/m3 to CNY1.4/m3, \ncompared to about CNY1.7/m3 for the other systems. \n \nE.  Public Consultation and Social Preference \n \n11.  Numerous surveys and public consultations demonstrate that people are concerned \nabout environmental issues and the quality of their living environment, including wastewater \nmanagement. Two public consultations and a household survey were undertaken as part of the \nPPTA. The consultations demonstrated general support for the Project, though people raised \nconcerns about the mitigation measures, particularly during the construction phase. The surveys \nshowed that 90% of households were in favor of the Project, and 60% were willing to pay a \nregular service charge. This demonstrates reasonable support. While people generally want \nenvironmental improvements, the issue of direct charges is always controversial. Under PRC \nregulations developed with ADB support, the tariff review procedure is required to undergo \nconsultation with consumer representatives, academics, sector specialists and Government \nofficials. Recent experience with tariff increase for water supply in Fuzhou showed that the \nreview exercise was positive, with a majority of participants in favor. \n \nF.  Project Benefits \n \n12.  The  overall  public  health  and  environmental  benefits  of  wastewater  collection  and \ntreatment are well established. Fuzhou\u2019s 1.85 million residents, businesses, and visitors to the \ncity will benefit directly. The Project will (i) protect the drinking water source of the city by \nensuring that the Min River is Class III water quality or above; (ii) provide the necessary \nreticulation systems for planned WWTP; (iii) improve the living environment through greening \nand  creating  access  to  inland  creeks;  and  (iv)  remove  an  identified  constraint  to  growth, \nfacilitate further expansion, and attract private sector investment. \n \nG.  Conclusion \n \n13.  The analysis concludes that the standard targets and plans are well founded, target least \ncost actions first, and have a reasonable degree of public support. Evidence from FMEPB, \namong others, demonstrates that monitoring and enforcement of environmental programs is \neffective. The Project is a fundamental component of the overall plans for urban development, \nenvironmental protection, and improvements to ambient water quality in the Min River and \ncreeks on Nantai Island. Without the Project, the planned investments in two WWTP will not \ndeliver the envisaged environmental benefits, and the planned urban development areas on \nNantai Island will be put at risk. Within the parameters of network and river rehabilitation design, \nthe Project targets least capital and operation cost. The AEC of wastewater management will \nfall as the city invests more in wastewater assets and the overall treatment rate rises. ", "  Appendix 14  49 \nENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Environmental Needs \n \n1.  The  wastewater  service  coverage  for  the  population  of  the  project  area  must  be \nincreased by constructing new sewers, rehabilitating those in need of repair, and increasing \ntreatment capacity to meet the growing demands, particularly in the Yangli and Lianbian service \nareas. The other environmental need is to improve the water quality of Nantai Island creeks, \nwhich are classified as worse than the lowest water quality standard (Class V), and improve \ntheir currently poor flood handling and drainage capacity. \n \nB.  Alternatives \n   \n2.  Without the Fuzhou Environmental Improvement Project (the Project), large volumes of \nwastewater would be discharged untreated into the Fuzhou creeks and Min River, resulting in \nsevere pollution. Flooding and water logging would continue during the storm season. As a \nconsequence, public health would be adversely impacted. Technical alternatives for sewer \nalignment, sludge disposal, inland river rehabilitation, water diversion for the creeks on Nantai \nIsland, and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) site selection and effluent outfall location were \nevaluated, taking into account technical and environmental requirements.   \n \nC.  Potential Negative Impacts and Associated Mitigation Measures \n \n3.  To prevent potential environmental damage from discharging untreated or inadequately \ntreated sewage, the WWTPs will be designed to meet the specified national effluent standards. \nThe Fuzhou municipal government (FMG) and Fuzhou Water Environment Construction and \nDevelopment  Company  (FWECDC)  will  ensure  that  Yangli  and  Lianban  WWTPs  are \nconstructed and operated in accordance with sound environmental protection procedures and \nthe guidelines of the Government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). FMG and FWECDC \nwill ensure that civil work contracts require contractors to include environmental mitigation and \nmonitoring measures as specified in the Environmental Management Plan (EMP).1 Further, \nFMG and FWECDC will ensure that any adverse environmental impacts from the Project or the \nYangli and Lianban WWTPs are minimized by implementing the mitigation measures prescribed \nin the EMP. With that measure in place, the potential adverse impacts on the ecological and \nphysical environment from the construction and operation of the WWTPs associated with the \nProject will be mitigated. FMG will also ensure (i) the timely completion and operation of the \nproposed WWTPs, pumping stations, and flood gates at inland river estuaries; and (ii) the \nsynchronized final design of the two interrelated project components in Nantai Island. \n \n4.  Construction and operation of sewer networks, and the island creek rehabilitation project \ncomponents,  will  have  few  potential  negative  impacts.  Appropriate  engineering  and \nmanagement measures have reduced those risks to acceptable levels. Institutional risks will be \nmitigated. While FWECDC is an experienced agency, FMG will safeguard the environmental \nsustainability of its operations by ensuring that the FWECDC will have financial and managerial \nautonomy to operate the project facilities. Fuzhou Urban Visual Construction and Development \nCompany  (FUVCDC)  will  receive  appropriate  training  during  construction  and  operation. \nRelatively small amounts of irreplaceable resources will be used. Modeling studies conducted \nduring  the  preparation  of  the  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  for  this  component \nindicated that water diversion flow would be less than 3% of the Min River\u2019s normal flow, with \n                                                 \n1  As included in the Summary Environmental Impact Assessment of the Project, circulated to the Board of Directors \non 7 July 2004. \n ", "50  Appendix 14 \nwater returning back to the Min River. The Project will help in making the Min River water quality \nachieving stable Class III\u2014suitable as a source for drinking water. Through the implementation \nof the supervision and management system specified in the environmental management plan \n(EMP),  the  Project  will  mitigate  potential  negative  impacts.  The  effectiveness  of  mitigation \nmeasures and monitoring plans will be evaluated through the feedback reporting system carried \nout in two tiers, as specified in the EMP.  \n \n5.  Public involvement with the Project design and EMP was an ongoing element during \nproject preparation. An expert workshop on the Project was attended by representatives from \nGovernment offices dealing with environmental protection, landscaping, municipal and industrial \nsectors, colleges, and hospitals. Two public consultation workshops on environmental impacts \nwere  held  during  the  project  preparation.  Plans  for  public  involvement  during  the  design, \nconstruction, and operational stages have been developed, and will be incorporated into the \nProject construction and operation management plans. \n \nD.  Benefits \n \n6.  The Project will significantly improve the urban environment and public health and safety \nof Fuzhou, while promoting its sustainable urban development. The Project aims to improve \nsubstantially Fuzhou\u2019s wastewater management, including wastewater collection and treatment, \nto diminish the risks of flooding and improve the water quality of the inland creeks of Nantai \nIsland. The Project will enhance the protection of water quality in the Min River, the source of \ndrinking  water  for  Fuzhou.  Environmental  improvements  from  the  Project  will  provide \nopportunities  for  (i)  Fuzhou\u2019s  sustainable  economic  and  social  development,  (ii)  the \ndevelopment of the local tourism industry, and (iii) the overall enhancement in the living and \npublic health conditions of Fuzhou\u2019s residents.  \n \n7.  The  Project  will  provide  wastewater  collection  systems  for  the  Yangli  and  Lianban \ncollection areas. It will upgrade wastewater services in the project areas and Fuzhou-wide by \nstrengthening  an  autonomous  wastewater  collection  company,  which  will  improve  the \nmanagement of the networks. The collected wastewater will be transported to the Yangli and \nLianban WWTPs, and treated to specified national standards. The construction and operation of \nthe WWTPs will adhere to the environmental requirements stipulated in the summary EIA and \nthe EMP. Without these project components, the incomplete sewer networks cannot effectively \ncollect the wastewater generated.  \n \n8.  The  Nantai  Island  Inland  Creek  Rehabilitation  project  component  will  improve  the \nenvironment  of  Nantai  Island,  and  enhance  its  flood  control  capacity.  The  successful \nimplementation of the Lianbian Sewer Network and Nantai Island Inland Creek Rehabilitation \nproject  components  is  expected  to  improve  the  water  quality  of  the  inland  creeks.  The \nenvironmental sustainability of this project component will be supported by a pilot demonstration \nactivity (PDA) that will promote the Clean River Program for the Urban Poor on Nantai Island. \nThe PDA will increase public awareness and ensure stakeholder participation and ownership of \nthe  project  component.  Similarly,  the  environmental  sustainability  of  the  Project  will  be \nsupported by the establishment and operation of a training facility, which will train the staff of \nFWECDC and FUVCDC in operation and maintenance as well as environmental management \nand monitoring. The training facility also will serve as a public awareness and education center. \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20050812123234+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20050708074211+08'00'", "Title": "Fuzhou Environmental Improvement Project", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)"}, "author_page": "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 June 2005) \n \nCurrency Unit \u2013  yuan (CNY) \nCNY1.00 =  $0.121     \n$1.00 =  CNY8.27     \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  AP  \u2013  affected person \n  BOT  \u2013  build-operate-transfer \n  EIA  \u2013  environmental impact assessment \n  EIRR  \u2013  economic internal rate of return \n  EMP  \u2013  environmental management plan \n  FIRR  \u2013  financial internal rate of return \n  FMEPB  \u2013  Fuzhou Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau \n  FMG  \u2013  Fuzhou municipal government \n  FMLDC  \u2013  Fuzhou Municipal Land Development Center \n  FPG  \u2013  Fujian provincial government \n  FUMP  \u2013  Fuzhou Urban Master Plan \n  FUVCDC  \u2013  Fuzhou Urban Visual Construction and Development Company \n  FWECDC  \u2013  Fuzhou Water Environment Construction and Development Company \n  ICB  \u2013  international competitive bidding \n  LAR  \u2013  land acquisition and resettlement \n  LCB  \u2013  local competitive bidding \n  LIBOR  \u2013  London interbank offered rate \n  MDG  \u2013  Millennium Development Goals  \n  O&M  \u2013  operation and maintenance \n  PLG  \u2013  project leading group \n  PMO  \u2013  project management office \n  PPMS  \u2013  project performance monitoring system \n  PPTA  \u2013  project preparatory technical assistance \n  PRC  \u2013  People\u2019s Republic of China \n  PSP  \u2013  private sector participation \n  RP  \u2013  resettlement plan \n  SEPA  \u2013  State Environmental Protection Administration \n  TA  \u2013  technical assistance \n  WWTP  \u2013  wastewater treatment plant \n \nWEIGHTS AND MEASURES \nha  \u2013  hectare \nlpcd   \u2013  liters per capita per day \nm2  \u2013  square meters \nm3/day  \u2013  cubic meters per day \nm3/year  \u2013  cubic meters per year \nkm   \u2013  kilometer \nkm2  \u2013  square kilometer \n \nNOTES \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December. \n(ii)  In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars.  \n \n \nThis report was prepared by a team consisting of E.A.
