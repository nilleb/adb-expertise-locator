THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan \nof up to B4,950,000,000 (or its equivalent in US dollars) to the Northern Bangkok Monorail \nCompany Limited (NBM), and (ii) a proposed loan of up to B4,950,000,000 (or its equivalent in \nUS dollars) to the Eastern Bangkok Monorail Company Limited (EBM) for the Bangkok Mass \nRapid Transit Project (Pink and Yellow Lines) in Thailand. \n \n2.  The project entails the construction and operation of the mass rapid transit (MRT) Pink \nLine and Yellow Line in Bangkok. The Pink Line will operate between Min Buri district in Bangkok \nand Khae Rai in Nonthaburi province with the total length of about 34.5 kilometers (km). The \nYellow Line will operate between Lat Phrao in Bangkok and Samrong in Sumut Prakarn province \nwith  the  total  length  of  about  30  km.  [CONFIDENTIAL  INFORMATION  DELETED].  ADB\u2019s \nparticipation  in  the  project  will  enable  sustainable  development  with  affordable  public \ntransportation, contribute to climate change mitigation, and catalyze commercial financing to the \nMRT sector through mitigating the ridership risk.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n3.  Project identification. Cities generate over 80% of gross domestic product (GDP) in \nmany countries in Asia and the Pacific and are engines of economic growth that have lifted \nmillions from poverty.1 As urban populations in Asian cities are estimated to increase by 44 million \nevery year, the quality and efficiency of the cities will determine the region\u2019s long-term productivity \nand overall stability.2 However, as urbanization accelerates with increased population, higher \npopulation  density,  and  income  growth,  there  are  increasing  pressures  on  its  benefits. \nMotorization and resulting traffic congestion is one of the most serious challenges, and is a major \nobstacle to productivity because of wasted time and resources.3 It is also a threat to sustainable \ngrowth because of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The number of private cars in \nSoutheast Asia has more than doubled since 2000, and 30 million more passenger cars are \nexpected to be added by 2040. The transport sector accounts for around 60% of the oil consumed \nand is also the largest source of nitrogen oxide emissions.4 Further, traffic congestion hinders \ninclusive growth since the urban poor are often disproportionally affected by environmental issues \nand are also the worst victims of long commuting hours with poor public transportation. \n \n4.  Bangkok is one of the largest cities in Southeast Asia with a population of approximately \n6 million for its own metropolis area, and about 14 million including the greater Bangkok areas. It \nis also famous for its heavy traffic congestion, and some studies name Bangkok as one of the \nmost congested cities in the world.5 The key policy of the Government of Thailand to tackle the \nnotorious Bangkok traffic is to develop a network of MRT systems.6 MRT delivers a faster and \ncheaper option for commuters that contributes to the city\u2019s productivity, mitigates air pollution, and \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2013. Urban Operational Plan 2012\u20132020. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2008. Managing Asian Cities. Manila. \n3  ADB estimates road congestion costs 2%\u20135% of gross domestic product every year because of lost time and higher \ntransport costs. \n4  International Energy Agency. 2017. Southeast Asia Energy Outlook 2017. Paris. \n5  For  instance,  TomTom  Traffic  Index  ranks  Bangkok  as  the  second  most  congested  city  in  the  world \n(https://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/trafficindex/list?citySize=LARGE&continent=ALL&country=ALL). \n6  Mass rapid transit systems are a form of mass transit system, including urban rail, light trams, monorail, and other \ntrain systems, which use rolling stock to move large numbers of passengers along fixed routes. The Pink Line and \nYellow Line in Bangkok are monorail systems. ", "2 \nreduces greenhouse gas emissions by removing private vehicles from the roads through modal \nshifts. An affordable public urban transport system is also indispensable for inclusive growth. The \nfirst MRT line, the Green Line, commenced operation in 1999 and has been followed by several \nphases of extensions. There are now five MRT lines in Bangkok and the government is following \nthe Urban Rail Mass Transit Master Plan, a comprehensive MRT development plan which \nproposes to deliver 14 new urban rail MRT lines and/or extensions in Bangkok. \n \n5.  [CONFIDENTIAL  INFORMATION  DELETED].  The  overall  development  of  the  MRT \nsystem still lags far behind other major cities in the region. The total length of the MRT lines in \nBangkok is just over 100 km compared with Singapore, which has 200 km, and Shanghai and \nTokyo, both with over 500 km. As a result, the proportion of mass transit in the travel of the overall \nBangkok metropolitan area is a mere 4% compared with 41% in Tokyo and 29% in Hong Kong, \nChina. Over 50% of travel is by car, which is far higher than in Tokyo (29%) and Hong Kong, \nChina (11%).7 There is a clear need to develop more MRT lines, in particular feeder lines outside \nthe central business district, to facilitate further modal shifts to public transport. \n \n6.  Project design. The government selected a public\u2013private partnership (PPP) net cost \nscheme8 for the implementation of the MRT Pink Line and Yellow Line, in which the Mass Rapid \nTransit Authority of Thailand (MRTA) is responsible for the provision of land and right of way, \nwhile the private sector invests in civil works, mechanical and equipment systems, and rolling \nstock, as well as operation and maintenance services. The two lines are feeder monorail lines to \nfeed passengers to other MRT lines which connect to the central business district. They will \nprovide convenient and affordable public transport and mitigate traffic congestion and associated \nenvironmental issues through modal shifts. While the government does not provide any guarantee \nof the ridership, it will extend fixed subsidies during the first 10 years of operation to mitigate the \nrisk and improve the project\u2019s financial sustainability. This structure will leverage the private \nsector\u2019s efficiency while reducing the government\u2019s fiscal burden, and can be the model for future \nMRT lines in Bangkok and in other cities in the region. While the tender process was undertaken \nindependently for the two lines, BSR Joint Venture (BSR) won the concession for both the Pink \nLine and Yellow Line. \n \n7.  Competitive long-term financing is one of the main success factors of concession-based \nMRT  projects.  However,  exposure  to  ridership  risk  is  the  key  challenge.  The  number  of \npassengers during the early years of operation is often difficult to predict, while the ridership \nnormally reaches the projected level in the long run. Although there will be fixed subsidies from \nthe government during the initial years of the project and Thai commercial banks are committed \nto finance, significant exposure to the ridership remains a major concern for the banks and BSR. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) has been \nengaged in discussions with BSR and Thai banks to mitigate this risk. ADB has proposed loans \nwith longer tenor and back-ended repayment profile (ridership ramp-up tranches), which enable \nthe borrower to reduce the repayment obligations following the subsidy period when the exposure \nto the ridership is most significant. Since the ridership will become more certain over the long term \nin the later years when the ADB loans become payable, this structure also mitigates ADB\u2019s own \nrisk, thus delivering a mutually beneficial solution to all stakeholders. \n                                                \n7  Krungsri Research. 2017.

Bangkok. \n8  Under the PPP net cost scheme, the concessionaire of the project is responsible for the costs of civil works, \nmechanical electrical works, and operation and maintenance, while it will be entitled to receive the fare revenue from \nthe project. If the fare and other revenues are not sufficient to cover the costs, the government will fill the gap by way \nof subsidies. In the case of the MRT Pink Line and Yellow Line, the key parameter of the tender was the amount of \nsuch subsidies from the government that each bidder needs (i.e., minimum subsidy).

Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n17.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, which includes a focus on private sector development \nand operations, as well as infrastructure development.12 ADB\u2019s support for the project is also in \nline with its country partnership strategy for Thailand, 2013\u20132016,13 and its country operations \nbusiness plan, 2018\u20132020 (footnote 9), both of which promote the support for private sector \ndevelopment  and  uphold  two  key  core  strategic  areas  for  ADB\u2019s  focus:  infrastructure \ndevelopment, and environmentally sustainable development. \n \n18.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project is in line \nwith ADB\u2019s Sustainable Transport Initiative, which promotes a transport system that is efficient, \nsafe,  environmentally  friendly,  and  has  urban transport  as  one  of  the  key  pillars for  ADB \noperations in the sector.14 Since motorized transport emissions are a significant contributor of \ngreenhouse gas emissions, the Sustainable Transport Initiative calls for transport solutions that \nencourage the use of more energy efficient and environmentally friendly modes of transport such \nas rail. \n \nD.

Projected Financial and Economic Performance \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]. \n   ", "6 \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n22.  ADB\u2019s proposed assistance includes (i) a local currency loan not exceeding B4,950 million  \nto NBM, and (ii) a local currency loan not exceeding B4,950 million  to EBM. \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n23.  Catalytic impact. ADB\u2019s participation in a private sector MRT project signals confidence \nto other financiers and investors. Traffic congestion and lack of affordable public transport \ninfrastructure have been identified as key constraints on sustainable development of major cities \nin developing member countries, including Bangkok. To keep up with the investments needed, \nprivate sector investors need to raise competitive, long-term financing. Interest from local banks \nare often sponsor or project specific, and the financing from the local banks will not be sufficient \nto  fund  the  entire  rollout  of  the  MRT  projects.  Thus  the  demonstration  effect  from  ADB\u2019s \nparticipation helps catalyze both domestic and international financiers to the MRT sector. ADB's \nparticipation in the MRT project will contribute to climate change mitigation and reduce premature \ndeaths from pollution, currently estimated to be 50,000 deaths per year in Thailand.16 ADB\u2019s \nextensive environmental and social due diligence will also give a comfort to international banks. \n \n24.  Mitigation of ridership risk. The ramp-up of the ridership is a key risk in financing MRT \nprojects. The ADB loans will help mitigate this risk. The long tenor and back-ended repayment \nprofile of the ridership ramp-up tranche enables to reduce the scheduled repayment during the \nfirst few years after the expiry of government subsidies when the ridership and the resulting cash \nflows remain uncertain. Therefore, ADB\u2019s participation improves the project\u2019s cash flow during the \nriskiest period and thereby enhances the overall bankability of the project. \n \n25.  Promotion of PPP. ADB\u2019s PSOD can support concession-based projects like the Pink \nLine and Yellow Line, while its Southeast Asia Department can support other lines through public \nsector funding, such as the South Purple Line. Through this \u201cOne ADB\u201d approach, ADB\u2019s \nparticipation in the project contributes to the promotion of the PPP schemes in the Thai MRT \nsector, and gives assurances to the government that ADB has the capacity to support regardless \nof the PPP scheme applied to individual lines, thus providing flexibility with its sector planning. \n \nC.  Risks \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]. \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n26.  The project is classified category A for environment and involuntary resettlement, and \ncategory C for indigenous peoples. Environmental and social impact assessments (ESIAs) for the \nPink Line and Yellow Line were prepared in accordance with domestic procedures and were \napproved by the government in March 2015 for the Pink Line and February 2016 for the Yellow \nLine. Additional analyses on noise; biodiversity; climate change risks; cumulative and induced \n                                                \n16 Bangkok Post. 2017. The Air We Breathe. 16 January. ", "7 \nimpacts; and the public information, participation, and complaints management system were \nconducted to ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The potential \nimpacts from the project have been identified and effective measures to avoid and mitigate the \nadverse impacts are in the ESIA addendums, environmental and social management plans \n(ESMPs), social safeguards compliance audit report, and supplemental social assessment. \n \n27.  Environment. The Pink Line and Yellow Line will be constructed over existing road \nnetworks and pass through commercial and mixed commercial and residential areas. The project \ndesign has been optimized to minimize land expropriation, and reduce traffic congestion and \ndisturbance to the public. Noise reduction technology has been included in the design resulting \nin insignificant noise and vibration impacts. Noise modeling shows that the increase in noise levels \nduring operation will be within the range of 3\u20135 A-weighted decibels (dB(A)) above the base line, \nhowever operating speeds will be much lower that those modelled and therefore operational noise \nimpacts will be lower. The environment, health and safety guidelines for noise in commercial \nareas and the Thai national standards are both 70 dB(A) and the noise impacts will be within \nthese  standards.  Potential  environmental  impacts  during  construction  are  short  term  and \nlocalized, and can be effectively mitigated through the implementation of the ESMPs. The \nimplementation arrangements and monitoring and reporting requirements for construction and \noperation are detailed in the ESMPs. Both the MRTA and the concessionaires have extensive \nexperience in constructing and operating MRT systems. They have established environmental \nmanagement systems which are implemented by experienced technical staff. Public consultations \nwere held and are reported in the ESIAs. The ESIAs and ESMPs also detail the complaints \nmanagement structure and activities on information disclosure, consultation, and participation. \n \n28.  Social safeguards. The project will affect private assets, mainly land and structures, \nwhich are being acquired by the MRTA following Thai laws. Land acquisition and resettlement \nactivities commenced when the royal decree was issued in 2014 and 2015, and the compensation \nstarted in May\u2013June 2017 prior to ADB\u2019s involvement in August 2017. Based on this time line, it \nis established that land acquisition and resettlement activities are not in anticipation of ADB \nfinancing and, therefore, do not fall within the ambit of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \nSafeguard Requirements 2 para. 4. An audit of the land acquisition process was undertaken to \ndetermine if there are risks associated with MRTA-led land acquisition and resettlement. An audit \nreport was prepared following the scope and outline of a resettlement plan. The audit found the \nMRTA practices based on the MOT compensation manual and other applicable national legal \nframeworks are in line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements. The MRTA (i) \nconducted a census and full asset inventory, disclosed information, and consulted meaningfully \nwith affected people; and (ii) offered compensation payments for land, structure, and lost income \ndue to business disruption at replacement cost. The MRTA is implementing a robust grievance \nmechanism where requests for changes in design are being implemented to minimize impacts. \nContinuous monitoring of land acquisition and compensation activities until completion and \nsemiannual external monitoring will be undertaken by a social and resettlement expert reporting \ndirectly to ADB. The project will not affect indigenous peoples communities. \n \n29.  Other social dimensions. The project is classified as having some gender elements. The \nborrowers will commit to implementing additional measures to promote gender equality in their \nbusiness activities as set out in the design and monitoring framework. NBM and EBM will comply \nwith national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy (2001), will take \nmeasures to comply with internationally recognized core labor standards. The borrowers will \nreport regularly to ADB on (i) their compliance and that of their contractors with such laws, and ", "8 \n(ii) the measures taken. Information disclosure and consultation with affected people are in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s requirements.17 \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n30.  NBM and EBM were advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice \nrelating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will \nensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, \nmoney  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism;  and  remedies  for  ADB  in  the  event  of \nnoncompliance. \n \nC.

Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),18 \nADB  will proceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that  the Government of \nThailand has no objection to the proposed assistance to NBM and EBM. ADB will enter into \nsuitable finance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of \nthe proposed assistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \nV.
