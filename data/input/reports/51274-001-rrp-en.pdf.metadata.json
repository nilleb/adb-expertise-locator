The Pink Line will operate between Min Buri district in Bangkok \nand  Khae  Rai  in  Nonthaburi  province  with  the  total  length  of  about  34.5  kilometers  (km).  The \nYellow Line will operate between Lat Phrao in Bangkok and Samrong in Sumut Prakarn province \nwith  the  total  length  of  about  30  km.  [CONFIDENTIAL  INFORMATION  DELETED].  ADB\u2019s \nparticipation  in  the  project  will  enable  sustainable  development  with  affordable  public \ntransportation, contribute to climate change mitigation, and catalyze commercial financing to the \nMRT sector through mitigating the ridership risk.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \nProject  identification.  Cities  generate  over  80%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in \n3. \nmany  countries  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  and  are  engines  of  economic  growth  that  have  lifted \nmillions from poverty.1 As urban populations in Asian cities are estimated to increase by 44 million \nevery year, the quality and efficiency of the cities will determine the region\u2019s long-term productivity \nand  overall  stability.2 However,  as  urbanization  accelerates  with  increased  population,  higher \npopulation  density,  and  income  growth,  there  are  increasing  pressures  on  its  benefits. \nMotorization and resulting traffic congestion is one of the most serious challenges, and is a major \nobstacle to productivity because of wasted time and resources.3 It is also a threat to sustainable \ngrowth  because  of air  pollution and greenhouse gas  emissions. The  number  of private  cars  in \nSoutheast  Asia  has  more  than  doubled  since  2000,  and  30  million  more  passenger  cars  are \nexpected to be added by 2040. The transport sector accounts for around 60% of the oil consumed \nand  is  also  the  largest  source  of  nitrogen  oxide  emissions.4 Further,  traffic  congestion  hinders \ninclusive growth since the urban poor are often disproportionally affected by environmental issues \nand are also the worst victims of long commuting hours with poor public transportation. \n \nBangkok is one of the largest cities in Southeast Asia with a population of approximately \n4. \n6 million for its own metropolis area, and about 14 million including the greater Bangkok areas. It \nis also famous for its heavy traffic congestion, and some studies name Bangkok as one of the \nmost congested cities in the world.5 The key policy of the Government of Thailand to tackle the \nnotorious Bangkok traffic is to develop  a network of MRT systems.6 MRT delivers a faster and \ncheaper option for commuters that contributes to the city\u2019s productivity, mitigates air pollution, and \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2013. Urban Operational Plan 2012\u20132020. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2008. Managing Asian Cities. Manila. \n3  ADB estimates road congestion costs 2%\u20135% of gross domestic product every year because of lost time and higher \n\ntransport costs. \n\n4  International Energy Agency. 2017. Southeast Asia Energy Outlook 2017. Paris. \n5  For  instance,  TomTom  Traffic  Index  ranks  Bangkok  as  the  second  most  congested  city  in  the  world \n\n(https://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/trafficindex/list?citySize=LARGE&continent=ALL&country=ALL). \n\n6  Mass rapid transit systems are a form of mass transit system, including urban rail, light trams, monorail, and other \ntrain systems, which use rolling stock to move large numbers of passengers along fixed routes. The Pink Line and \nYellow Line in Bangkok are monorail systems. \n\n\f2 \n\nreduces greenhouse gas emissions by removing private vehicles from the roads through modal \nshifts. An affordable public urban transport system is also indispensable for inclusive growth. The \nfirst MRT line, the Green Line, commenced operation in 1999 and has been followed by several \nphases of extensions. There are now five MRT lines in Bangkok and the government is following \nthe  Urban  Rail  Mass  Transit  Master  Plan,  a  comprehensive  MRT  development  plan  which \nproposes to deliver 14 new urban rail MRT lines and/or extensions in Bangkok. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL  INFORMATION  DELETED].  The  overall  development  of  the  MRT \n5. \nsystem still lags far behind other major cities in the region. The total length of the MRT lines in \nBangkok is just over 100 km compared with Singapore, which has 200 km, and Shanghai and \nTokyo, both with over 500 km. As a result, the proportion of mass transit in the travel of the overall \nBangkok metropolitan area is a mere 4% compared with 41% in Tokyo and 29% in Hong Kong, \nChina.  Over  50%  of  travel  is  by  car,  which is far  higher than  in Tokyo  (29%)  and Hong Kong, \nChina (11%).7 There is a clear need to develop more MRT lines, in particular feeder lines outside \nthe central business district, to facilitate further modal shifts to public transport. \n \nProject  design.  The  government  selected  a  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP)  net  cost \n6. \nscheme8 for the implementation of the MRT Pink Line and Yellow Line, in which the Mass Rapid \nTransit  Authority  of  Thailand  (MRTA)  is  responsible for  the  provision  of  land  and  right  of  way, \nwhile  the  private  sector  invests  in  civil  works,  mechanical  and  equipment  systems,  and  rolling \nstock, as well as operation and maintenance services. The two lines are feeder monorail lines to \nfeed  passengers  to  other  MRT  lines  which  connect  to  the  central  business  district.  They  will \nprovide convenient and affordable public transport and mitigate traffic congestion and associated \nenvironmental issues through modal shifts. While the government does not provide any guarantee \nof the ridership, it will extend fixed subsidies during the first 10 years of operation to mitigate the \nrisk  and  improve  the  project\u2019s  financial  sustainability.  This  structure  will  leverage  the  private \nsector\u2019s efficiency while reducing the government\u2019s fiscal burden, and can be the model for future \nMRT lines in Bangkok and in other cities in the region. While the tender process was undertaken \nindependently for the two lines, BSR Joint Venture (BSR) won the concession for both the Pink \nLine and Yellow Line. \n \n7. \nCompetitive long-term financing is one of the main success factors of concession-based \nMRT  projects.  However,  exposure  to  ridership  risk  is  the  key  challenge.  The  number  of \npassengers  during  the  early  years  of  operation  is  often  difficult  to  predict,  while  the  ridership \nnormally reaches the projected level in the long run. Although there will be fixed subsidies from \nthe government during the initial years of the project and Thai commercial banks are committed \nto finance, significant exposure to the ridership remains a major concern for the banks and BSR. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) has been \nengaged in discussions with BSR and Thai banks to mitigate this risk. ADB has proposed loans \nwith longer tenor and back-ended repayment profile (ridership ramp-up tranches), which enable \nthe borrower to reduce the repayment obligations following the subsidy period when the exposure \nto the ridership is most significant. Since the ridership will become more certain over the long term \nin the later years when the ADB loans become payable, this structure also mitigates ADB\u2019s own \nrisk, thus delivering a mutually beneficial solution to all stakeholders. \n\n                                                \n7  Krungsri Research. 2017.

Bangkok. \n8  Under  the  PPP  net  cost  scheme,  the  concessionaire  of  the  project  is  responsible  for  the  costs  of  civil  works, \nmechanical electrical works, and operation and maintenance, while it will be entitled to receive the fare revenue from \nthe project. If the fare and other revenues are not sufficient to cover the costs, the government will fill the gap by way \nof subsidies. In the case of the MRT Pink Line and Yellow Line, the key parameter of the tender was the amount of \nsuch subsidies from the government that each bidder needs (i.e., minimum subsidy).

Its Thai sovereign rating is Baa1 by Moody\u2019s, BBB+ \nby Standard & Poor\u2019s, and BBB+ by Fitch.  \nThe borrowers will report on key performance indicators, including the outcome and \noutputs indicators identified in the design and monitoring framework. \n\nBSR = BSR Joint Venture; BTS Group = BTS Group Holdings Public Company Limited; BTSC = Bangkok Mass Transit \nSystem  Public  Company  Limited;  EBM  =  Eastern  Bangkok  Monorail  Company  Limited;  EPC  =  engineering, \nprocurement, and construction; MRTA = Mass Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand; NBM = Northern Bangkok Monorail \nCompany Limited; Q = quarter; RATCH = Ratchaburi Electricity Generating Holding Public Company Limited; STECON \n= Sino-Thai Engineering and Construction Public Company Limited.  \nSources: Northern Bangkok Monorail Company Limited and Eastern Bangkok Monorail Company Limited. \n \nF. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]. \n \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nADB\u2019s proposed assistance includes (i) a local currency loan not exceeding B4,950 million  \n\n \nA. \n \n22. \nto NBM, and (ii) a local currency loan not exceeding B4,950 million  to EBM. \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]. \n \nB. \n \n23. \nCatalytic impact. ADB\u2019s participation in a private sector MRT project signals confidence \nto  other  financiers  and  investors.  Traffic  congestion  and  lack  of  affordable  public  transport \ninfrastructure have been identified as key constraints on sustainable development of major cities \nin developing member countries, including Bangkok. To keep up with the investments needed, \nprivate sector investors need to raise competitive, long-term financing. Interest from local banks \nare often sponsor or project specific, and the financing from the local banks will not be sufficient \nto  fund  the  entire  rollout  of  the  MRT  projects.  Thus  the  demonstration  effect  from  ADB\u2019s \nparticipation helps catalyze both domestic and international financiers to the MRT sector. ADB's \nparticipation in the MRT project will contribute to climate change mitigation and reduce premature \ndeaths  from  pollution,  currently  estimated  to  be  50,000  deaths  per  year  in  Thailand.16 ADB\u2019s \nextensive environmental and social due diligence will also give a comfort to international banks. \n \n24.  Mitigation of ridership risk. The ramp-up of the ridership is a key risk in financing MRT \nprojects. The ADB loans will help mitigate this risk. The long tenor and back-ended repayment \nprofile of the ridership ramp-up tranche enables to reduce the scheduled repayment during the \nfirst few years after the expiry of government subsidies when the ridership and the resulting cash \nflows remain uncertain. Therefore, ADB\u2019s participation improves the project\u2019s cash flow during the \nriskiest period and thereby enhances the overall bankability of the project. \n \n25. \nPromotion  of  PPP.  ADB\u2019s  PSOD  can  support  concession-based  projects  like the  Pink \nLine and Yellow Line, while its Southeast Asia Department can support other lines through public \nsector  funding,  such  as  the  South  Purple  Line.  Through  this  \u201cOne  ADB\u201d  approach,  ADB\u2019s \nparticipation  in  the  project  contributes  to  the  promotion  of  the  PPP  schemes  in  the  Thai  MRT \nsector, and gives assurances to the government that ADB has the capacity to support regardless \nof the PPP scheme applied to individual lines, thus providing flexibility with its sector planning. \n \nC. \n\nRisks \n \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  project  is  classified  category  A  for  environment  and  involuntary  resettlement,  and \n26. \ncategory C for indigenous peoples. Environmental and social impact assessments (ESIAs) for the \nPink  Line  and  Yellow  Line  were  prepared  in  accordance  with  domestic  procedures  and  were \napproved by the government in March 2015 for the Pink Line and February 2016 for the Yellow \nLine.  Additional  analyses  on  noise;  biodiversity;  climate  change  risks;  cumulative  and  induced \n\n                                                \n16 Bangkok Post. 2017. The Air We Breathe. 16 January. \n\n\f7 \n\nimpacts;  and  the  public  information,  participation,  and  complaints  management  system  were \nconducted to ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The potential \nimpacts from the project have been identified and effective measures to avoid and mitigate the \nadverse  impacts  are  in  the  ESIA  addendums,  environmental  and  social  management  plans \n(ESMPs), social safeguards compliance audit report, and supplemental social assessment. \n \n27. \nEnvironment.  The  Pink  Line  and  Yellow  Line  will  be  constructed  over  existing  road \nnetworks and pass through commercial and mixed commercial and residential areas. The project \ndesign  has  been  optimized  to  minimize  land  expropriation,  and  reduce  traffic  congestion  and \ndisturbance to the public. Noise reduction technology has been included in the design resulting \nin insignificant noise and vibration impacts. Noise modeling shows that the increase in noise levels \nduring operation will be within the range of 3\u20135 A-weighted decibels (dB(A)) above the base line, \nhowever operating speeds will be much lower that those modelled and therefore operational noise \nimpacts  will  be  lower.  The  environment,  health  and  safety  guidelines  for  noise  in  commercial \nareas  and the  Thai  national  standards  are  both  70  dB(A)  and  the  noise  impacts  will  be  within \nthese  standards.  Potential  environmental  impacts  during  construction  are  short  term  and \nlocalized,  and  can  be  effectively  mitigated  through  the  implementation  of  the  ESMPs.  The \nimplementation  arrangements  and  monitoring  and  reporting  requirements  for  construction  and \noperation are detailed in the ESMPs. Both the MRTA and the concessionaires have extensive \nexperience in constructing  and operating  MRT  systems. They  have established environmental \nmanagement systems which are implemented by experienced technical staff. Public consultations \nwere  held  and  are  reported  in  the  ESIAs.  The  ESIAs  and  ESMPs  also  detail  the  complaints \nmanagement structure and activities on information disclosure, consultation, and participation. \n \nSocial  safeguards.  The  project  will  affect  private  assets,  mainly  land  and  structures, \n28. \nwhich are being acquired by  the MRTA following Thai laws. Land acquisition and resettlement \nactivities commenced when the royal decree was issued in 2014 and 2015, and the compensation \nstarted in May\u2013June 2017 prior to ADB\u2019s involvement in August 2017. Based on this time line, it \nis  established  that  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities  are  not  in  anticipation  of  ADB \nfinancing  and,  therefore,  do  not  fall  within  the  ambit  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \nSafeguard Requirements 2 para. 4. An audit of the land acquisition process was undertaken to \ndetermine if there are risks associated with MRTA-led land acquisition and resettlement. An audit \nreport was prepared following the scope and outline of a resettlement plan. The audit found the \nMRTA  practices  based  on  the  MOT  compensation  manual  and  other  applicable  national  legal \nframeworks  are  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  requirements.  The  MRTA  (i) \nconducted a census and full asset inventory, disclosed information, and consulted meaningfully \nwith affected people; and (ii) offered compensation payments for land, structure, and lost income \ndue to business disruption at replacement cost. The MRTA is implementing a robust grievance \nmechanism where requests for changes in design are being implemented to minimize impacts. \nContinuous  monitoring  of  land  acquisition  and  compensation  activities  until  completion  and \nsemiannual external monitoring will be undertaken by a social and resettlement expert reporting \ndirectly to ADB. The project will not affect indigenous peoples communities. \n \n29. \nOther social dimensions. The project is classified as having some gender elements. The \nborrowers will commit to implementing additional measures to promote gender equality in their \nbusiness activities as set out in the design and monitoring framework. NBM and EBM will comply \nwith  national  labor  laws  and,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy  (2001),  will  take \nmeasures  to  comply  with  internationally  recognized  core  labor  standards.  The  borrowers  will \nreport regularly to ADB on (i) their compliance and that of their contractors with such laws, and \n\n\f8 \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n(ii)  the  measures  taken.  Information  disclosure  and  consultation  with  affected  people  are  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s requirements.17 \n \nB. \n \n30. \nNBM and EBM were advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice \nrelating  to  combating  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.  ADB  will \nensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, \nmoney  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism;  and  remedies  for  ADB  in  the  event  of \nnoncompliance. \n \nC. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]. \n \nD. \n \nConsistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),18 \n31. \nADB  will  proceed  with  the  proposed  assistance  upon  establishing  that  the  Government  of \nThailand  has  no  objection  to  the  proposed  assistance  to  NBM  and  EBM.
