Environmental implications of the proposed policy \nAssessment  and  institutional  reforms  were  reviewed,  and  environmental \ninterventions have been incorporated as required.  \n   \nProgram Description  The Financial Markets Program for Private Sector Development \n(the  Program)  (formerly  Private  Sector  Development  Program \n[PSDP] subprogram II) is the second subprogram of the cluster \nloan  approved  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  in \nDecember 2000. The cluster program supports the creation of an \nenabling  environment  for  private  sector  development.  The \nproposed Program and actions are intended to complement the \nresults achieved by the PSDP subprogram I, particularly in the \nareas of (i) developing financial markets and the private sector's \naccess to finance, and (ii) supporting the Government's public \nenterprise reform program in the banking industry through the \nnewly created Strategic Enterprise Management Agency (SEMA). \nThe Program will be implemented from 2005 to 2007. \n \nThe Program consists of two loans: (i) a policy (program) loan, \namounting to $60 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \n(OCR); and (ii) a technical assistance (TA) loan, amounting to $5 \nmillion equivalent, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. \n   \nProgram Loan   \n   \nRationale  If Sri Lanka is to meet its long-term objectives of reducing chronic \nunemployment, raising standards of living, maintaining high levels \nof human development, and reducing poverty, the economy must \ngrow at a faster rate on a sustained basis. To achieve these \nobjectives, the country needs to enhance productivity, reduce the \nfinancial  burden  of  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  on  the \neconomy, and mobilize larger amounts of investment capital to \nrebuild  the  country's  infrastructure  after  20  years  of  civil  war. \nPublic resources can only finance a part of these needs. The \nGovernment recognizes that to meet its resource requirements, it \nneeds  to  rely  on  the  private  sector,  while  developing  the \nappropriate market environment for faster economic growth.  ", "ii  \nObjective  The Program seeks to facilitate participation of the private sector \nincluding small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the Sri \nLankan economy by supporting government reforms to eliminate \nimpediments to and develop opportunities for their involvement. \nAlthough the country is experiencing economic growth, most of it \nis  being  generated  from  larger  enterprises  and/or  SMEs  in \nindustrial areas. The Program aims to create a private sector that \nwould  take  a  lead  role  in  generating  employment,  boosting \neconomic growth, and raising income levels for a larger segment \nof the population, including rural areas. \n \nIn  this  context,  the  Program  will  support  the  development  of \nfinancial markets, a key constraint for economic growth for the \nprivate sector and SMEs. People's Bank (PBank), the second \nlargest bank in the country, with an extensive nationwide branch \nnetwork  particularly  in  rural  areas,  will  play  a  pivotal  role  in \nservicing the commercial, SMEs, and retail sectors. \n \nThe principal objective of the Program is to facilitate private sector \ndevelopment by strengthening the financial markets, including the \nrestructuring and phased recapitalization of PBank. The Program \nwill have the following elements: (i) developing financial markets; \nand (ii) strengthening the banking system. This includes further \nrestructuring of PBank, based on an agreed time schedule to \nmeet  certain  performance  targets  to  improve  efficiency  and \nprofitability. PBank will be recapitalized in phases in accordance \nwith the recapitalization plan. The focus areas of the proposed \nProgram build on the results of PSDP subprogram I. \n   \nAdjustment Cost  The adjustment costs associated with reforms under the Program \nare estimated to total $90 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan and Loan  The program loan will support focused policy reforms. A loan in \nAmount and Terms  the amount of $60,000,000 will be provided to the Government of \nSri Lanka (Government) as Borrower at standard OCR terms with \na 15-year amortization period, including a grace period of 3 years; \nan  interest  rate  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, and \na commitment charge for the undisbursed balance of 0.75% per \nannum and such other terms and conditions set forth in the loan \nagreement for the Program. (A front-end fee of 1% will be waived \nfor loans approved before 30 June 2005). \n   \nEstimated Program  December 2007 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency and  The  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Planning  (MOFP)  will  be  the \nImplementation  Executing  Agency.  The  MOFP  will  establish  an  interagency \nArrangements  program implementation and steering committee chaired by the \nSecretary of the Treasury and comprising representatives from \nthe Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), the Insurance Board of Sri ", "    iii \nLanka (IBSL), PBank, the Land Commissioner\u2019s Department, the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and SEMA. The \nsteering  committee  may  also  call  upon  other  stakeholders  for \nconsultations on important issues that will have a bearing on the \nProgram,  such  as,  the  Colombo  Stock  Exchange  (CSE), \nnongovernment organizations, and academics. \n   \nProgram Period and  The loan is expected to be utilized within 36 months from the date \nTranching  of loan effectiveness. It will be released in three equal tranches of \n  $20 million each. The first tranche will be made available upon \nloan effectiveness. The second and third tranches will be released \nupon compliance with specified conditions in the policy matrix. \n   \nCounterpart Funds  The counterpart funds to be generated out of the loan proceeds \nwill be used to meet program expenditures and related costs of \nreforms for financial markets and private sector development.  \n   \nTechnical Assistance  The  technical  assistance  (TA)  loan  will:  (i)  provide  capacity \n(TA) Loan  building  and  skills  development  for  PBank;  (ii)  strengthen  the \n  insurance industry through capacity building of IBSL; (iii) create a \nnational  computerized  registry  system  for  securing  movable \nproperty;  (iv)  provide  banking  expertise  to  work  for  SEMA  to \nimprove its ability to manage four banks in its portfolio; and (v) \nprovide legal and governance expertise for corporate securities, \nfinancial markets, and commercial and banking, law and policy \nreforms.  \n   \nCost Estimate  The total cost of the TA loan is estimated at $6 million equivalent. \n  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  finance  $5  million \nequivalent. The Government will contribute $1 million equivalent. \n   \nFinancing Plan  ADB will provide a TA loan of SDR3,318,000 from its Special \nFunds resources for a term of 32 years, including a grace period \nof 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod, and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The TA loan closing date \nis expected to be 31 December 2007. \n   \nExecuting and  The MOFP will be the Executing Agency of the TA. IBSL, the \nImplementing Agencies  Land Commissioner\u2019s Department, MOFP, PBank, and SEMA will \nbe  implementing  agencies  for  their  respective  TA  loan \ncomponents. \n   \nProcurement and  The  program  loan  will  follow  ADB  standard  procedures  for \nDisbursement  procurement  and  disbursement.  Proceeds  of  the  loans  will  be \n  utilized to finance the full foreign exchange costs, excluding local \nduties and taxes, of eligible imports produced in and procured \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  member  countries.  All  procurement  under  the \nProgram will be undertaken through normal commercial practices \nfor  the  private  sector  or  the  Government\u2019s  prescribed \nprocurement  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB,  with  due \nconsideration to economy and efficiency. Procurement under the ", "iv   \nTA loan will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \nDisbursements under the Program loan will be made in line with \nADB\u2018s  simplified  disbursement  procedures  and  audit \nrequirements. To withdraw the loan proceeds, the Government \nwill certify that the value of eligible imports exceeds the amount of \nADB\u2019s projected disbursements under the loans in a given period. \nADB will have the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to \nverify  the  accuracy  of  the  Government's  certification. \nDisbursement under the TA loan will be made in line with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook. \n \nConsulting Services  Consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to \nADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. \n   \nProgram Benefits and  The population as a whole will benefit from (i) the development of \nBeneficiaries  financial markets; and (ii) a stronger banking system through the \nrestructuring and phased-in recapitalization of PBank. A dynamic \nprivate sector will enable creation of employment and thereby \nassist in reducing poverty. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Political Risk. A cease-fire is in effect after a 20-year civil war. \nAlthough the Government has a clear intent to seek a peaceful \nresolution to the conflict, no permanent solution has yet been \nreached. Delays in the peace process could (i) weaken private \nsector  development;  (ii)  hinder  the  development  of  financial \nmarkets,  including  attracting  the  needed  investment  capital  to \nrebuild and/or modernize the infrastructure of the country; and (iii) \nundermine the will to introduce and implement necessary policy \nreforms. There is strong government commitment toward policy \nreforms although the progress in the peace process is largely \nbeyond the control of the Program. \n \nImplementation Risk. Delays may occur in the implementation of \nreforms due to lack of capacity and/or skills. The Government has \nrequested capacity building through the TA loan as an integral \npart of the Program.  \n \nThe  loan  and  policy  reform  components  under  the  Program \ninvolve various bills and/or amendment to existing acts pertaining \nto  financial  and  commercial  reforms  to  be  approved  by  the \nCabinet  and/or  introduced  into  Parliament.  This  includes  the \nSEMA Act which is a key component of the Program. However, \nthere are political risks that such bills and/or amendment to acts \nmay  not  be  enacted  by  Parliament  despite  the  Government\u2019s \nstrong commitment, and if enacted, may not be implemented. \n \nThe risk in the restructuring and phased recapitalization of PBank \nis the board of directors\u2019 and management's success in meeting \nor exceeding the performance targets. PBank must also generate ", "    v \nsufficient income to meet its future capital adequacy requirements \nin line with the projected growth in assets. A memorandum of \nunderstanding (MOU) will be entered into between (i) SEMA and \nthe Government on one side; and (ii) the board of directors and \nmanagement of PBank on the other hand, to ensure cooperation \nin  restructuring  and  meeting  performance  targets  on  a  timely \nbasis. The purpose of the MOU is to give management and the \nboard the freedom to operate PBank without political interference. \nMoreover, the Government agrees to a phased-in recapitalization \nof PBank to meet minimum core-capital requirements up to a \nmaximum of SLRs8.5 billion subject to PBank meeting a timetable \nof pre-established financial performance targets.  \n \nRestructuring of PBank has substantial labor and human relations \nissues. Labor unions in Sri Lanka are active and their acceptance \nof the restructuring plan will be key to effective implementation \nunder the Program. PBank is required to enter into an agreement \nwith  the  union  representing  85%  of  the  employees  by  30 \nSeptember 2005. There is a risk that this may not occur. \n \nMacroeconomic  Risk.  Despite  generally  sound  economic \ndevelopments,  the  fiscal  deficit  has  begun  to  widen  in  2004 \nreflecting  inter  alia  some  weakening  in  revenue  performance, \nincreased  government  spending,  a  prolonged  drought  and \npetroleum price subsidies, which have been exacerbated due to \noil prices remaining at an all-time high. The new Government has \nyet to start negotiation on a new Poverty Reduction and Growth \nFacility  (PRGF)  as  some  performance  criteria  and  structural \nconditions  under  the  now  suspended  PRGF  were  not  met. \nHowever,  following  political  developments,  including  the \ndissolution  of  Parliament  in  February  2004  and  the  general \nelection of April 2004, the new Government is firming up key \nmacroeconomic  policies  and  is  in  discussions  with  the \nInternational Monetary Fund on the resumption of PRGF. Looking \nforward, the PRGF is not likely to be renewed before early 2005 \nfollowing the finalization of actual results from the 2004 budget \nand supporting economic policy framework action plans. ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka (Sri Lanka) for the Financial Markets Program \nfor Private Sector Development (the Program). \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT  \n2.  The most important political challenge facing the Government of Sri Lanka (Government) \nis finding a lasting solution to the civil conflict. Following two decades of civil unrest, a formal \nagreement to cease hostilities and restore normalcy to the country was signed in February \n2002. Since then, the continuation of the ceasefire and the advancement of measures toward a \npermanent solution for peace have served to support strengthened sociopolitical and economic \nstability. While the Government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Ealam continue to honor the \nceasefire  agreement,  the  peace  process  remains  on  hold  until  an  agreed  framework  and \napproach for negotiations can be developed.1 \n \n3.  Despite the long period of civil unrest, Sri Lanka\u2019s economy has proved to be resilient. \nGrowth rates averaged 4.2% per year during the 1980s\u2014supported by the commencement of \nthe Government\u2019s liberalization measures and significant large-scale public sector infrastructure \ninvestments,  and  5.2%  in  the  1990s\u2014fueled  by  the  implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s \neconomic policy reform program focused on supporting private sector-led growth.  \n \n4.  The  economy  of  Sri  Lanka  has  performed  well  over  the  past  few  years  since  the \nceasefire agreement. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth was 5.9% in 2003 and based on \nfirst half year GDP growth rate of 5.7%, latest estimates suggest GDP growth of around 5.2% in \n2004, notwithstanding the impact on the economy of the oil price shock and a severe drought. \nEconomic  growth  has  been  broad  based  driven  primarily  by  growth  in  the  service  sector \nreflecting the impact of improved security conditions on business activity. Although the official \nunemployment rate declined from 9.1% in 2002 to 8.4% in 2003, unemployment continues to be \na problem for the country. \n \n5.  Stabilization of inflation has been a key component of the Government\u2019s macroeconomic \nprogram. The Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) inflation declined to 6.3% in 2003 from \n9.6% in 2002. Although the declining inflation trend continued into 2004, higher oil prices during \nthe second half of the year, and drought-related increase in food prices are exerting upward \npressure on inflation, which is likely to average around 7.2% by year end. In early November, \nthe Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) raised key benchmark rates by 50 basis points in order to \ncontain  inflationary  pressure  brought  on  by  the  combination  of  increasing  demand  on  the \neconomy and the impact of higher oil prices on core inflation. The tightening of monetary policy \nis expected to signal the start of a tightening cycle in order to stabilize inflationary pressure. \n \n6.  On the fiscal side, recent developments are a cause for concern. Following favorable \nfiscal consolidation in 2003\u2014which resulted in a decline of the overall fiscal deficit from 8.9% in \n2002 to an estimated 7.5% in 2003\u2014the fiscal stance has weakened in 2004. The slippage on \nthe fiscal side is mainly attributed to some weakening in revenue performance, increased public \nspending, as well as the effect of petroleum price subsidies reflecting the surge in oil prices \nduring  the  year.  The  new  Government  has  yet  to  start  negotiations  with  the  International \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program Update (2005\u20132006): Sri Lanka. Manila; and ADB. 2004. Economic \nUpdate: Sri Lanka. Manila. ", "2   \nMonetary  Fund  (IMF)  on  a  new  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Facility  (PRGF).  Some \nperformance criteria and structural conditions under the now suspended PRGF were not met. \nThe Government released its 2005 Budget on 18 November 2004 reflecting renewed efforts at \nstrengthening revenues and curtailing expenditures. In line with the Government\u2019s commitment \nto further fiscal consolidation, a reduction in the fiscal deficit is projected from a provisional level \nof 8.6% of GDP in 2004 to a level of 7.6% of GDP in 2005. \n \n7.  High global oil prices are projected to increase the oil import bill from $800 million to $1.6 \nbillion in 2004. The drain on foreign currency reserves is exacerbated by the fact that some \n$300 million of anticipated budget support from development partners for 2004 will not be \ndisbursed. The growing current account deficit which is now projected at around 4% of GDP, up \nfrom 0.6% the previous year, raised volatility of the exchange rate. The Rupee started to \ndepreciate against all major currencies, in contrast to last year when the Rupee remained \nalmost unchanged against the dollar. The Central Bank has spent some $550 million to support \nthe currency, only in part being able to replenish its reserves which are now projected at about \n3.1 months of import cover. The Rupee depreciated by 8% in nominal terms against the dollar in \nthe first 8 months of this year.  \n \n8.  Despite the challenges to macroeconomic management, particularly resulting from the \nexternal shocks during 2004, the economic outlook in Sri Lanka is generally favorable, if the \ndomestic imbalances, notably the fiscal deficit, are adequately addressed. The Government is \nfurther evolving its macroeconomic program, including the medium term fiscal program, and it \nhas  committed  to  curtailing  fiscal  imbalances  by  introducing  measures  including  those  to \nimprove weak revenue performance. If revenue augmentation and expenditure rationalization \nmeasures are effectively adopted, the medium-term outlook should augur well for sustained \nGDP growth at 5-6% per annum. Otherwise, mounting fiscal deficits would likely exert further \nupward  pressure  on  interest  rates,  weakening  the  local  currency  and  possibly  leading  to \nincreasing inflation and lower growth. In the meantime, conventional leading indicators such as \nthe stock market index continues on a bullish path with the Colombo Stock Exchange\u2019s (CSE) \nAll Share Price Index up by 44.8% in the first 10 months of 2004 and up by 88% since January \n2003. \n \n9.  The Government\u2019s medium-term development strategy, the Economic Policy Framework \npublished in July 2004, and further supported by the 2005 Budget, focuses on key areas \nincluding financial and capital markets reform, improvement of private sector access to finance, \nenhancement of small- and medium- sized enterprise (SME) growth, and the reduction of \nregional inequalities. Foreign investments beneficial to private sector development activities and \ntechnological advancement, as well as public-private partnerships in domestic resource based \nindustries, and the development of infrastructure services such as rural telecommunications, \nelectricity, and water supply schemes, are also being encouraged.  \n \n10.  To complement the Economic Policy Framework, the Government has established three \nmajor agencies in May 2004, reporting directly to the President of Sri Lanka. These are the \nNational  Council  for  Economic  Development  (NCED)  to  oversee  and  steer  economic \ndevelopment policy; the Strategic Enterprise Management Agency (SEMA)2 to restructure and \neventually eliminate budgetary support of 12 strategic state-owned enterprises (SOEs) (the 12 \n                                                 \n2 SEMA has been established under a directive of the President by the powers vested in the President under Section \n33 of the Constitution. A SEMA Bill is being drafted and will be submitted to Parliament under the Program, which \nwill ensure the independence of the strategic SOEs SEMA manages. ", "    3 \nstrategic SOEs, collectively, Strategic Enterprises),3 and a National Procurement Agency to \nimprove efficiency and encourage private sector participation in the procurement processes of \nthe Strategic Enterprises. The remaining nonstrategic SOEs will be overseen by the existing \nPublic Enterprise Reform Commission (PERC). \n \nIII.  THE SECTOR \n \nSector Description and Performance  \n1.  The Private Sector and Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises \na.  Private Sector \n11.  The private sector in Sri Lanka is a principal source of investment and economic growth. \nIn 2003, it accounted for an estimated 76% of aggregate investment, and consisted of 38,962 \nregistered private companies and 2,236 registered public companies, of which approximately \n75% were small- and medium-sized enterprises. The private sector had a dominant foothold in \nmajor industries such as food, beverages, textiles, wood, basic metal, nonmetallic products, \nfabricated metal products, machinery and transport equipment, and manufactured products. The \nprivate sector employed about 44% of the workforce, up from 35% in 1990. If the self-employed \nand  unpaid  family  workers  were  included,  the  figure  would  rise  to  84%,  which  compared \nfavorably with 77% in 1990. \n \n12.  There is a sharp split in the profile of urban and rural enterprises. Urban enterprises are \nolder and much larger than their rural counterparts. Large-scale manufacturing is primarily \nexport oriented and concentrated in the Colombo area, although geographical distribution differs \nmarkedly across sectors. Rural enterprises are likely to be sole proprietorships headed by a \nmale and based outside the home, established using household savings. The informal economy \nis quite large, estimated at about 45% of gross national income, compared with 35% average for \nthe  rest  of  the  region,  and  16.8%  in  the  Organization  of  Economic  Co-operation  and \nDevelopment (OECD) countries. \n \n13.  Through  the  Private  Sector  Development  Program  (PSDP)  subprogram  I,4  the \nGovernment introduced a number of measures to stimulate private sector development. These \ninclude (i) the creation of the Consumer Affairs Authority, an autonomous agency to formulate \nand  enforce  consumer  protection  and  competition  policies;  (ii)  the  establishment  of  the \nInsurance Board of Sri Lanka (IBSL) as an independent regulator of insurance companies; (iii) \nthe enhancement of the capital market through increasing the jurisdiction given to the Securities \nand  Exchange  Commission  (SEC)  by  broadening  its  regulatory  scope  in  securities-related \nindustries (i.e., underwriters, margin providers, credit rating agencies, investment managers, \nand clearing houses); (iv) the establishment of a nationwide job counseling network, Jobsnet, \ndedicated to job placement and retraining of displaced workers; and (v) the implementation of a \nrestructuring program for the state-owned savings bank, National Savings Bank.5  \n                                                 \n3  People's Bank, Bank of Ceylon, National Savings Bank, State Mortgage and Investment Bank, Ceylon Electricity \nBoard, Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, Sri Lanka Ports Authority, Airports and Aviation Authority, Sri Lanka \nRailways, Sri Lanka Central Transport Board (i.e., responsibilities include the state-owned bus company), National \nWater Supply and Drainage Board, and State Pharmaceutical Corporation. \n4  ADB. 2000.

", "4   \n14.  The Government has recognized that the creation of a competitive and sound business \nenvironment requires an autonomous agency for formulation and enforcement of consumer \nprotection  and  competition  policies.  To  this  end,  the  Consumer  Protection  Authority  Bill\u2014\nsubsequently  renamed  the  CAA  Act\u2014was  approved  by  Parliament  in  June  2003,  with \nresponsibility  for  consumer  affairs  assigned  to  the  CAA  and  anti-trust  activities  under  the \npurview of the Ministry of Justice. Since establishment, the CAA has been reviewing anti-\ncompetition activities in certain industries and has been announcing stiff measures to eliminate \ncartel-like behavior in pricing certain consumer necessities. \n \n15.  With the gradual end of state monopolies and increase in private sector competition, a \nportion of Sri Lanka\u2019s regulatory framework has been modernized. A multisector regulatory bill \nwas enacted in September 2002 covering utilities, petroleum, power, and water, and a second \nbill for the communications industry is presently being drafted. To enhance competition in the \ntelecommunications industry, the Sri Lanka Telecommunications Ltd.\u2019s (SLTL) monopoly on \ntelephony  services  was  eliminated  by  issuing  external  gateway  licenses  to  independent \ntelephone operators. The Government also divested a majority of its shares in SLTL in 2003. As \na result, Sri Lanka has one of Asia\u2019s most liberalized telecommunications market. \n \n16.  Sri Lanka's labor policies and processes are relatively rigid by international standards \nand are perceived to have been creating obstacles to the expansion of private labor markets. \nRigidities  have  included  the  legislation  on  involuntary  termination  for  nondisciplinary  staff \nreduction  and  lengthy  procedures  for  dispute  resolution.  The  Parliament  has  approved \namendments  to  the  Termination  of  Employment  of  Workmen  Act  (TEWA)  for  involuntary \ntermination of employment. The TEWA makes it mandatory for labor tribunal cases to be settled \nin 4 months, arbitration cases in 2 months, and termination cases in 1 month. Under the \namended TEWA, an employee will be entitled to a maximum of 1.5 months severance pay for \n36 months of employment. The amended TEWA eliminates the arbitrariness and uncertainty in \nlabor retrenchment, and facilitates settlement of labor disputes. The Government is aware that \nfull implementation will require availability of some type of unemployment insurance scheme for \nretrenched workers, which could prove difficult at the present time due to the Government\u2019s \nfiscal constraints. As part of social safety, more than 20 Jobsnet centers have been established \nproviding  such  services  as  registration  of  job  seekers,  information  on  job  opportunities, \nmatching of demand and supply for job opportunities, and career guidance. A summary of \naccomplishments under PSDP subprogram I is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \nb.  Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises \n17.  Most of Sri Lanka's SMEs are involved in production (41%) or trading (38%), with a \nsmaller  proportion  in  service-related  activities  (21%).  Besides  manufacturing  processed \nagricultural goods, non-agricultural manufactured goods include garments, nonmetallic mineral \nproducts, furniture, and wood products. In the trading sector, the majority of enterprises are \nengaged in selling processed (65%) and unprocessed agricultural products (57%). \n18.  SMEs6 have a pivotal role in the private sector as well as in the overall economy. SMEs \nconstitute almost 95% of all industrial establishments. According to the most recent statistics \navailable, industrial SMEs are still only responsible for 35% of all industrial jobs and 15% of \nindustry\u2019s value added to the economy. SMEs are primarily located in three major districts\u2014 \nColombo, Gampaha, and Kalutara\u2014with more than 40% of SMEs in Colombo alone. SMEs in \nthese three districts account for 72% of total employment and 88% of total SME output. The \n                                                 \n6  Defined as enterprises with less than 100 employees. ", "    5 \nresults of a recent survey7 show that 65% of SMEs are small enterprises while the remaining \n35% are of medium size.8 Of the small enterprises, 76% had assets in the range of $10,000\u2013\n50,000 indicating that there are many very small enterprises throughout the country, most of \nthem sole proprietorships and/or partnerships. \n19.  Sri Lanka\u2019s SME development is not dynamic in terms of new entrants or growth of \nestablished enterprises, and is generally constrained by weak development policies that favor \nlarge-scale industries, high transaction costs due to a complex tax regime, a weak skills base, \nand limited access to affordable financing. A well-functioning SME sector, however, would take \nthe lead in generating jobs for economic growth and in raising income levels for a large segment \nof  the  low-income  population.  To  improve  the  policy  environment  for  SMEs  and  focus  on \naddressing the major constraints to SME development, the Government has established an \nSME cluster committee within the NCED to coordinate activities that affect SMEs.  \n \n20.  Through  the  SME  Sector  Development  Program,9  several  policy  changes  were \nintroduced to reduce the cost of operating and financing SMEs, primarily related to tax reform: \nrationalization and harmonization of tax incentives. These reforms included the reduction of \ncorporate income tax for SMEs, abolition of turnover tax on banking and financing activities, \nharmonization of certain tax incentives, and the abolition of stamp duty on letters of credit. \nCommercial legal reforms such as the Bankruptcy Act are underway, to provide for court-\nsupervised restructuring of enterprises in the event of financial default.  \n \n21.  The  Ministry  of  SME  Development  (MSMED)  has  the  responsibility  for  providing \nmechanisms for ongoing SME monitoring, developing long-term SME policy, and implementing \nregulatory reforms. It has established five centers throughout the country to assist SMEs in \nobtaining  business  development  services  (BDS).10  BDS  include  outsourcing  activities  (e.g. \npayroll and accounting); information technology services; technical services (e.g. design and \nengineering); and finance brokering. A BDS registry has been developed to better match supply \nand demand in the local market for business support services. Entrepreneurs are able to identify \nand select relevant development services with the help of the registry. The registry includes all \nregistered BDS organizations in Sri Lanka and is available through a Government web site, \ndeveloped under ADB assistance.  \n \n2.  Public Enterprises \n22.  History. From independence in 1948 until 1977, Sri Lanka adopted a socialist approach \nto economic development. Starting from an economy that was primarily based on agriculture,11 \nstate-run enterprises were set up in a number of key sectors. State engagement in commercial \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to Sri Lanka for Enabling Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprise Growth. Manila. \nSurvey data was collected from a sample size of 527 SMEs, comprised of 340 small enterprises and 187 medium \nenterprises, operating in 11 sub-sectors of the economy in 6 provinces, including the Northwest, Western, Central, \nSouthern and Sabaragamuwa provinces. \n8  Small- and medium-sized enterprises are businesses with assets (excluding land and building) of between SLRs21 \nmillion to SLRs50 million (i.e., approximately $210,000 to $500,000), respectively. \n9  ADB. 2001.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to Sri \nLanka for the Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprise Sector Development Program, Business Services Support \nFacility ($6 million). Manila. \n11 In 1948, following independence, 90% of Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign exchange was earned from plantation crops\u2014such as \ntea, rubber, and coconut. ", "6   \nactivities supported the substitution of imports, particularly consumer goods, whose entry was \nregulated through tariff controls. By 1977, with the establishment of substantive state holdings in \na diverse range of commercial activities across agriculture, industry, finance, and physical \ninfrastructure sectors, the state had been an imposing player in every sector of the economy. In \n1977, policy was shifted. State planning was abandoned and economic liberalization policies \nwere  explored  to  improve  international  competitiveness  and  encourage  private  sector \ninvolvement. In 1991, the privatization program was initiated and by 1996 the liberalization \nprocess  was  accelerated  with  banking  reforms,  tax  reforms,  tariff  reforms,  and  incentives \ntargeted to encourage foreign investment.  \n \n23.  As part of this process, Sri Lanka has made significant inroads in the sale of SOEs. Of \nSri  Lanka\u2019s  200  estimated  SOEs,  approximately  50%  have  been  privatized,  primarily \nplantations, and the manufacturing and services sectors. Since the beginning of 2001 (i.e. start \nof implementation of PSDP subprogram I), proceeds from the sale of SOEs have been in \nexcess of $100 million. Proceeds from privatizations enabled the Government to retire a portion \nof its public debt.  \n \n24.  However,  there  has  been  a  negative  social  impact  of  privatization  on  workers, \nconsumers, and the public in general. Labor issues became significant during the process \nbecause most SOEs were overstaffed as employment had been given under political patronage \nand, as a last resort, by the Government. There has been poor worker productivity as profit has \nnot been the main goal in managing SOEs. At the time of privatization, the Government faced \ncritical questions as to how to handle the issue of surplus labor. Although redundancies in some \nSOEs could be as high as 50%, voluntary retirement schemes (VRS) have run into difficulties \nincluding assessing who is redundant, and how much they should be compensated to retire \nvoluntarily. Also, a lack of a clear Government direction on VRS led to ad hoc packages whose \nvalue rest mainly on the bargaining power of the unions. In some instances, the VRS were so \nattractive that more than the anticipated number of employees left the SOEs.  \n \n25.  Apart  from  the  employment  issues,  social  effects  of  privatization  were  also  felt  by \nconsumers via price increases, poorer quality products, and reduction or elimination of essential \nservices such as bus transportation in unprofitable rural areas. \n \n26.  Strategic Enterprises. Some of the larger Strategic Enterprises depend on Government \nfinancial support thereby creating a burden on the budget. By the end of 2003, five12 of the 12 \nStrategic Enterprises had received capital injections from the Government in an amount equal to \nSLRs16.6 billion ($158 million). In 2004, the estimated capital injections total SLRs11.3 billion \n($108 million). To compound the situation, state-owned banks have been financing unprofitable \nSOEs, resulting in a weakened banking system. Unlike former governments, the strategy of the \npresent Government is to be responsible for restructuring Strategic Enterprises and improving \ntheir profitability and corporate governance rather than privatizing them.  \n \n27.  SEMA13  was  created  to  manage  Strategic  Enterprises  as  independent  commercial \nenterprises,  free  from  political  interference.  The  Strategic  Enterprises  have  combined  total \nassets of over $10.5 billion and approximately 125,000 employees. The Strategic Enterprises \ninclude four banks (People\u2019s Bank [PBank], Bank of Ceylon [BOC], National Savings Bank, and \n                                                 \n12 The Ceylon Electricity Board, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board, Sri Lanka Railways, the Airports and \nAviation Authority, and the Sri Lanka Central Transport Board. \n13 The former government  was planning to form a holding company to manage the five largest state-owned \ncompanies in Sri Lanka, as discussed in ADB. 2003. Progress Report on the Private Sector Development Program \nin the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. Manila. ", "    7 \nState Mortgage and Investment Bank), two energy suppliers (Ceylon Electricity Board and \nCeylon Petroleum Corporation), four transportation providers (Sri Lanka Ports Authority, Airports \nand Aviation Authority, Sri Lanka Railways and the Sri Lanka Central Transport Board); the \nNational Water Supply and Drainage Board; and the State Pharmaceutical Corporation. Since \nSEMA\u2019s establishment, the Government has been committed to ensuring that the line ministries \nhave roles in formulating policy, but that line ministries do not give operational directions to the \nStrategic Enterprises.  \n \n28.  To improve profitability, each of the Strategic Enterprises has or will submit to SEMA \nrestructuring plans approved by the respective board. The restructuring plans have been or are \nbeing submitted for consideration for the Cabinet\u2019s approval. Each of the restructuring plans \nshall contain strict budget ceilings to reduce the Strategic Enterprises' impact on public finances \nand to prevent state-owned banks from financing their losses. \n \n29.  SEMA's objectives14 for each of the Strategic Enterprises include (i) improving efficiency, \neffectiveness, and financial viability through appropriate supervision; (ii) ensuring commercial \nand political independence of board members; (iii) ensuring effective management through the \nboards of directors, a majority of the members representing the private sector; (iv) establishing \nindustrial benchmarks and regional standards to be achieved over the next 3\u20135 years; (v) \nobtaining an initial credit rating from a credit rating institute, and improving that rating over time; \n(vi) motivating management to effectively compete in the relevant market while being mindful of \nthe expectations of the general public and social welfare; and (vii) ensuring that approved \nrestructuring plans will be implemented according to schedule.  \n \n30.  Strategic Enterprises will be encouraged by SEMA to focus on their core businesses. As \na result, the restructuring plans envisage them to (i) rationalize their assets by either disposing \nof idle (non-core) assets as well as entering into public-private partnership arrangements for \nfinancing new projects and/or related services; and (ii) outsource certain services which could \nbe provided less expensively and/or with greater quality than internally  (e.g. treasury, fund \nmanagement, human resources development, and marketing). \n \n31.  A general recruitment ban that had been placed on SOEs over the past few years has \nbeen lifted for Strategic Enterprises. They will be able to recruit qualified managers as outlined \nin  their  approved  restructuring  plans.  The  Cabinet  will  also  approve  a  VRS  to  retrench \nnonessential employees for a Strategic Enterprises if (i) the VRS meets the objectives of the \napproved restructuring plan, and (ii) there are sufficient funds to implement the VRS based upon \nthe restructuring plan approved by the board of directors of the Strategic Enterprises. \n \n3.  Financial Markets \n32.   In Sri Lanka, the financial markets primarily consist of banks, insurance companies, and \nprovident funds. The financial sector is dominated by state-owned institutions, that control more \nthan 60% of the total assets held by all financial institutions in the country. The contractual \nsavings institutions especially the state-owned Employees Provident Fund, the Employees Trust \nFund, and private provident funds are also significant in terms of assets under management, \nand accounted for about 20% of total assets. An overview of the financial markets is contained \nin Supplementary Appendix C. \n                                                 \n14 The rights and responsibilities of Strategic Enterprise Management Agency (SEMA) will be formalized in the SEMA \nAct. The introduction of the SEMA Bill to Parliament is a second-tranche release condition of the Program. ", "8   \n33.  Banks.  The  institutional  structure  of  the  banking  market  defies  easy  description.  It \nreflects a long history of the Government establishing special-purpose institutions to provide \nspecific legal powers to meet identified needs. Competition in the banking sector is based on \nproducts and geographic location, not the type of institution. There are 22 commercial banks, 42 \ndepository institutions (a national savings bank, 24 finance companies, and 17 regional rural \ndevelopment  banks),  three  state-sponsored  long-term  financial  institutions,  11  insurance \ncompanies, and two public pension funds. The licensed commercial banks and the licensed \nspecialized banks accounted for 79% of the assets of financial sector assets in 2003.  \n \n34.  The Banking Act No. 30 of 1988 and its subsequent amendments are the main pieces of \nlegislation that govern the conduct of the banking institutions in Sri Lanka. The Monetary Law \nAct establishes the CBSL. The CBSL regulates, supervises, and monitors the banking industry, \nand the leasing and finance companies. \n \n35.  Insurance Companies. There were 13 insurance companies at the end 2003, of which \ntwo are engaged in life insurance. The others were engaged in both life and general insurance. \nAfter the Government divested its 90% stake in the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd. in \n2003, almost the entire insurance industry became privately held. The total asset base of the \nindustry grew by 10% and was SLRs61 billion ($582 million) at end-2003. The average life \ninsurance penetration (premium as a percentage of GDP) is 0.6%, which is low by international \nstandards (i.e. 2.2\u20133.6% for emerging countries and 5.4\u20138.4% for industrialized countries), \nindicating a potential for expansion in the industry. \n \n36.  Stock Market. The stock indexes have recorded significant gains since 2001. The All \nShare Price Index increased by more than 70% during the 2-year period ended 31 December \n2003. The Sri Lankan equity market has remained fairly small, despite a relatively long period of \nexistence.  Some  241  companies  are  listed  on  the  Colombo  Stock  Exchange  (CSE), \nrepresenting 20 business sectors. Market capitalization remains comparatively low at SLRs263 \nbillion ($2.5 billion) or about 16% of GDP as of December 2003. As a result of the ceasefire, \nforeign investors were net buyers at the CSE for almost three consecutive years.  \n \n37.  Government  and  Corporate  Debt  Securities  Market.  Government  debt  securities \ndominate Sri Lanka\u2019s debt market, representing 98% of the total value of issued debentures. \nUntil recently, there has been no market based yield curve because primary government issues \nwere sold at below market rates to state-owned institutions. The market is therefore large but \nilliquid. The maximum maturity of most sovereign bonds is 5\u20137 years. Since 1997, certain \ncorporate bonds have also been listed on the CSE, but such instruments are almost illiquid. The \nmarket capitalization of listed corporate debt is small, totaling SLRs9.7 billion (approximately \n$93 million) in December 2003. \n \n38.  A number of legislative enactments relating to the financial sector are being drafted (e.g. \nthe  Bankruptcy  Act,  amendments  to  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  [SEC]  Act, \nBanking Act, and Amendments to the Companies Act) in order to improve regulatory oversight \nand facilitate greater competition in the financial markets while keeping abreast of market \ndevelopments. However, reforms should be made to further strengthen the resiliency of the \nfinancial system and improve the depth and scope of the financial markets.  \n \n \n \n ", "    9 \nIssues and Opportunities \n1.  Development of Financial Markets \n \n39.  Debt Market. For the private sector to participate actively in economic activities, it \nshould have adequate access to finance at appropriate rates and terms. The ongoing study on \nthe  Sri  Lanka  Investment  Climate15  highlights  finance,  together  with  the  poor  quality  of \ninfrastructure, as the major obstacle for urban and rural enterprises. The private sector faces \ndifficulties accessing finance in Sri Lanka because the Government uses more than 50% of the \ncountry's  financial  resources  to  fund  the  fiscal  deficit.  As  of  year-end  2003,  Government \nborrowings were approximately $10.2 billion, representing 106% of GDP and accounting for \napproximately 98% of the total debt market value. CBSL, through the Monetary Board, is solely \nresponsible for issuing public debt and the principal investors in government securities are \nstate-owned institutions. Until recently, government bonds were not issued through the price \ndiscovery method,16 and as a result, the bonds were sold at below market rates, primarily to \nstate-owned institutions. To prevent losses, almost all investors hold bonds to maturity. As a \nconsequence, although the Government security market is large, there is no active trading, and \nuntil recently, there was no true market yield curve. Additionally, the maximum maturity for \nbonds is 5-7 years. Longer term financing should be available to rebuild the infrastructure after \n20 years of civil conflict. Moreover, due to the absence of a long-term government bond yield \ncurve and accompanied by certain tax issues, the corporate bond market remains small. Also, \ncertain technical and legal issues prevent alternative financial instruments to be introduced in \nthe debt market.  \n \n40.  Equity Investment. The CSE has existed since 1896, but remains small and illiquid. \nInvestment interest in the equity market must increase to provide the necessary risk capital to \nthe country (only 3.2% of private sector investment capital was raised through initial public \nofferings in the CSE in 2003). International best practice standards should be implemented to \nattract  more  investment  capital  to  the  CSE.  Appropriate  modern  information  technology  is \nneeded to ensure that the clearing of equity securities is enhanced to reduce settlement risk to \nsellers and buyers of publicly traded shares.  \n \n41.  Institutional Investors. Assets of institutional investors amount to approximately one \nthird of total bank assets. Despite this large amount of assets, their impact on financial market \ndevelopment and innovation through new products have been negligible, mainly because they \nhave been used as a captive source for funding primarily government debt. Private companies \nfunding needs are largely met internally, or for larger enterprises, from commercial banks. \n \n42.  Capital Market. If necessary reforms were made in both the debt and equity markets, \nincluding  the  introduction  of  new financial  products  and  services  to  manage  risk,  a  better \nfunctioning capital market would develop, which should attract more investors and issuers, \nthereby increasing competition in the banking industry, which should have a positive effect of \nreducing  financial  intermediation  costs17  (average  interest  rate  spreads  for  commercially \nlicensed banks were over 4% in 2003). \n \n                                                 \n15 ADB and World Bank. October 2004. Sri Lanka: Improving the Rural and Urban Investment Climate Draft Report. \n16 An international best practice method to determine the price of newly issued securities (e.g. shares and bonds). \n17 Between 1 February 2001 through 31 December 2003, the average weighted prime lending rate and average \nweighted deposit rate declined by 13 percentage points and 14 percentage points respectively, but the average \nweighted lending rate declined by only 3.2 percentage points during the same period. ", "10   \n43.  Banking  Industry.  The  commercial  banking  industry  has  not  been  able  to \naccommodate the financing needs of a large portion of the private sector and serves mostly the \nlarger enterprises and/or enterprises located in the major industrialized areas. Historically, poor \nlending  practices  and  inefficiencies  of  the  two  state-owned  banks\u2014BOC  and  PBank\u2014that \ndominate the banking sector kept interest rate spreads high as a result of high cost/income \nratios from poor asset quality and operating inefficiencies. Although private commercial banks\u2019 \nmarket share has been growing in recent years (as a percentage of total commercial bank \nadvances), BOC and PBank account for more than 40% of the total market, a decline from 55% \nin 1998. Although SOEs loans or loans to enterprises with government guarantees represent \nonly 30% of BOC's and 37% of PBank's loan portfolio, such loans account for the bulk of their \nnonperforming loans.  \n \n44.  Most other banks, including private ones, also suffer from high levels of nonperforming \nloans, inadequate provisioning, heavy reliance on collateral security, and high cost/income \nratios. Banks\u2019 interest rate spreads remain high although there has been an overall reduction of \ninterest rates. Because there is little competition, private banks take advantage of state banks\u2019 \nhigh operating costs to charge similarly high rates of interest to their borrowers. Until weak \nbanks (state-owned and private) are restructured or exit the market, competition will be limited \nand margins will remain high. \n \n45.  Legal System Foreclosure. The legal system has also been ineffective in protecting \ncreditors\u2019 interests. Although certain laws have been introduced to strengthen creditors\u2019 rights18 \nto recover loans and advances, borrowers have been successful in obtaining injunctions against  \nrecovery efforts from banks, resulting in a burden of non-performing loans on banks\u2019 balance \nsheets. \n \na.  Required Improvement in Financial Products and Services Available \nto the Capital Market \n \n46.  Mortgage Financing. At the end of 2003, the mortgage market was worth $220 million. \nWithin a relatively short time, as a result of the ceasefire, the demand for home mortgage \nfinancing had grown rapidly. New housing loans in 2003 grew by $80 million. Traditionally, the \nGovernment has supplied 20\u201325% of all home mortgage financing. The system is not viable in \nthe longer term because the Government is reluctant to foreclose on defaulted borrowers and \nhas  a  limited  budget  to  finance  the  increased  demand  in  mortgage  financing.  Mortgage \nfinancing provided by commercial banks, and to a limited extent, mortgage banks is offered in \ntenors of 15 to 20 years. However, interest rates are high (approximately 13%) because of \nfinancial risks resulting from a mismatch of funding long-term fixed rate mortgage loans with \nshort-term variable rate deposits.  \n \n47.  Like most developing countries, Sri Lanka suffers from a significant housing shortage. \nThe  country  currently  lacks  400,000  housing  units,  and  that  number  is set  to  increase  to \napproximately 650,000 units by 2010. A large proportion of the existing housing is substandard \nand lack essential amenities. Because mortgage financing is unattractive, there are few new \nhousing  starts.  Private  sector  housing  construction  could  be  an  increasingly  important \ncontribution to economic growth. Improved mortgage financing is necessary to improve housing \nstandards  and  provide  jobs.  An  alternative  financing  method,  such  as  the  issuance  of \nsecuritized bonds secured by mortgage receivables, could substantially improve the amount of \n                                                 \n18 Parate rights are granted by law to commercial banks and other specialized banks. In the case of default, parate \nrights give these institutions a right to quickly repossess collateralized property. ", "    11 \nfunds available for financing home mortgages, as well as improve interest rates offered for \nmortgage financing. \n \n48.  Financing  Movable  Property.  Sri  Lankan  banks  are  providing  financing  primarily \nagainst collateral in the form of fixed assets and/or personal guarantees. However, banks do not \nreadily finance movable assets such as computers and industrial equipment because they risk \nnot finding the collateral in the event of default. Registries for movable property exist in Sri \nLanka but are many and disbursed throughout the country: each district has its own registry, \nmaking it difficult for banks to keep track of pledged collateral nationwide. The private sector \nand  SMEs,  in  particular,  need  financing  for  movable  property.  If  a  national  registry  were \nestablished, banks would be more receptive to providing financing secured by movable assets. \nA  national  movable  property  registry  needs  to  be  developed  to  replace  the  present \ndecentralized ad hoc system.  \n \n49.  Equity  Market.  Since  the  ceasefire  took  effect,  the  CSE  has  increased  its  market \ncapitalization and trading volume. Still, the products and services offered are limited, especially \nin the area of risk management. Most shares listed on the CSE are not actively traded. To \nattract more domestic and foreign investors who could provide capital to the country, investor \nconfidence should be strengthened by improving corporate governance through establishing \ninternational best practice standards of corporate governance.  \n \n50.  Equity Trading Settlement Cycle. The main responsibility of the Central Depository \nSystem  is  to  support  settlement  of  traded  securities  and  to  minimize  the  settlement  risk. \nStandard international equity settlement requirements require (i) final settlement cycle to occur \nno later than the trade date plus 3 days (T+3); and (ii) payment for securities to occur only on \ndelivery of securities to the buyer (i.e. delivery versus payment [DVP]). The Sri Lankan equity \nsettlement system has a cycle equal to the trade date plus 6 days (T+6) and there is no DVP \nsystem, resulting in buyers and sellers of Sri Lankan equities taking more financial and market \nexposure risks when compared with other international markets. \n \n51.  Mutual  Funds.  By  the  end  of  2003,  total  assets  under  management  of  the  12 \nestablished mutual funds amounted to approximately $36 million. Although mutual funds are in \na position to provide investors with the benefits of diversification, the industry has not been able \nto grow quickly enough. Factors limiting the growth of the mutual funds industry include high \nvolatility in the equity market, a narrow range of instruments to manage financial risks, and \nunfavorable tax treatment (i.e. double taxation resulting from taxes paid on interest and/or \ndividend income by the mutual fund, and capital gains tax paid on the mutual fund by the \ninvestor). Improving the tax treatment for mutual funds should attract smaller investors to invest \nin mutual funds, particularly, money market mutual funds, which will have on overall positive \neffect on the bond market. \n \nb.  Enhanced Corporate Governance in the Financial Markets \n \n52.  Issuance  and  Sale  of  Public  Debt.  CBSL  is  responsible  for  developing  and \nimplementing  monetary  policy.  However,  the  Monetary  Board,  which  reports  to  CBSL,  is \nresponsible for issuing and selling all public debt. This results in a conflict of interest with CBSL \nwhen the Monetary Board is ascertaining the amount, timing, and maturity of issued securities. \nThe  responsibility  for  developing  and  implementing  monetary  policy  should  be  completely \nindependent from the issuance and sale of public debt. In so doing, the pricing of government \ndebt will be more transparent and a true market yield curve will develop.  \n ", "12   \n53.  Increased Supervision of the Financial Regulators. The SEC regulates the securities \nmarket, as well as licensing the CSE and its broker members while the CBSL fundamentally \nregulates  banks.  However,  there  are  a  number  of  smaller  nonregulated  financial  entities \nfraudulently issuing or selling securities or other interests to the general public and that are \noutside the realm of the financial regulators (SEC, CBSL, CSE, and Insurance Board of Sri \nLanka [IBSL]). In effect, this allows such entities to issue securities and interests and employ \nother means of raising finance without the oversight of the regulators, posing a risk to the \nstability of the financial system. Regulating agencies need to be given the legal power and \nauthority to take action against fraudulent financial schemes. \n \n54.  Independence of SEC. The SEC Act provides that the majority of SEC commissioners \n(7 of 10) including the chairman, be appointed by the Ministry of Finance and Planning (MOFP). \nHowever,  from  the  point  of  view  of  international  best  practice,  the  regulator  should  be \noperationally independent from external political or commercial interference and be held fully \naccountable in the exercise of its powers and functions. \n \n55.  Corporate Governance Code. To improve corporate governance of listed securities on \nthe  CSE,  the  SEC  should  issue  a  regulation  or  directive  making  it  mandatory  for  listed \ncompanies to use a code of best practice for corporate governance19 following international best \npractice standards. Mandatory corporate governance provisions should be adopted to improve \ninvestor confidence in the financial markets.  \n \n56.  Prevention of Money Laundering. IMF has been providing technical assistance (TA) to \nSri Lanka to avoid Sri Lanka\u2019s financial system being used for money laundering activities. The \nAnti-Money Laundering Bill needs to be introduced to Parliament. \n \nc.  Improved Regulations of the Insurance Industry \n57.  Since 2001, the regulation of the insurance industry has been brought under the IBSL.20 \nWhile IBSL is an independent entity, it currently operates within the SEC, with most of its staff \nbeing utilized on a shared basis. Given its short history, under-staffing and lack of a board of \ndirectors, IBSL does not function properly as a regulator. The insurance industry manages \nroughly one third of the total assets in the financial market. Many of the insurance companies \nlack financial strength and some may be in danger of meeting required financial coverage and \nreserve ratios. The first step in making the IBSL operational is to appoint a board of directors. \nAlso,  IBSL\u2019s  capacity  must  be  improved  in  order  to  monitor  and  supervise  the  insurance \nindustry,  have  insurance  companies  comply  with  prudential  requirements,  and  meet \ninternational best practice standards.  \n \n58.  Because there are few long-term financial products in the debt market, life insurance \ncompanies face significant portfolio risks since they are unable to match the maturities of their \ninvestment with the liabilities in their portfolios (e.g. investments, on average, have maturities \nwith 3\u20135 years while liability of life insurance companies have maturities with 20 to 30 years). \nAlthough life insurance companies have long-term liabilities, they have not become a significant \ninstitutional investor group providing the much-needed capital for infrastructure investments and \nsustainable growth. Insurance companies should be permitted to invest in securitized bonds.  \n                                                 \n19 ADB. 2000.

Operational Improvement of State-Owned Commercial Banks \n59.  BOC and PBank were established through Acts of Parliament.21 Under these Acts, the \nGovernment has the power to appoint boards of directors, to issue instructions, and to give \ngeneral or special directions which is the duty that the boards must comply with. Management is \nformally constrained from making independent commercial decisions on credit, terms of loans, \ninterest rates, recruitment, salaries, and employee incentives. During the past 4 years, the \nbanks have been managed independently, but the BOC and PBank Acts need to be formally \namended to ensure the commercial and political independence of the boards and management.  \n \n60.  People\u2019s Bank. PBank, one of the 12 Strategic Enterprises managed by SEMA, was \nestablished in 1961 to develop the cooperative movement of Sri Lanka and enhance rural \nbanking. Presently, the Government owns 92% of PBank and the Sri Lankan Cooperative \nSocieties own the remaining 8%. Based upon assets of SLRs206 billion (approximately $2 \nbillion) as of end-2003, PBank has a market share of over 22%, and is Sri Lanka\u2019s second \nlargest bank. Through its 325 branches, the largest banking network in the country, PBank \nprovides such services as corporate banking, SME financing, trade finance, and retail and \nconsumer finance. Approximately 50% of PBank\u2019s branches serve rural areas. PBank employs \nmore than 10,000 people.  \n \n61.  SME financing and corporate/commercial banking account for approximately 16% and \n40% of the loan portfolio, respectively. Of the total corporate/commercial lending, 24% are total \nadvances net of provisioning to SOEs or to borrowers guaranteed by the Government. As a \nresult of the bank\u2019s relatively large exposure to pawn brokerage (25% of the loan portfolio) and \nits  significant  branch  network,  PBank  has  a  large  deposit  base  that  provides  PBank  with \ninexpensive funding. However, its exposure to consumer lending is low, representing only 10% \nof the loan portfolio. PBank needs to avail itself of low-cost funding by increasing consumer \nlending and thereby improve its profitability. PBank also provides lease financing through its \nsubsidiaries. Although leasing represents only 0.3% of PBank\u2019s total loan portfolio, it is one of \nthe bank\u2019s more profitable business areas (approximately 13% of consolidated income). Real \nestate development and corporate finance are other small business areas. \n \n62.  Poor management over a period of time, characterized by high operating costs and \npolitically influenced lending practices, resulted in poor asset quality and poor credit culture \nseverely impacting PBank's financial profile. In 1993 and 1996, the Government recapitalized \nPBank (SLRs10.5 billion in 1993 and SLRs10.0 billion in 1996). These capital injections were \nnot accompanied by any restructuring of PBank so the financial deterioration did not stop.  \n \n63.  Past Performance. Substantive changes were made in 1999 to depoliticize PBank. New \nboard members were appointed from the private sector. Top management, also from the private \nsector and with significant international banking experience, was hired in 2001, significantly \nreducing  political  influence  on  bank  management  and  operations.  The  new  management \ndecided to restructure PBank and introduce substantial operational improvements by preparing \nand  implementing  a  strategic  plan  (2001\u20132003)  (Strategic  Plan).  Such  measures  included \nreducing the cost structure, introducing risk management techniques, and ensuring sharper \ncustomer focus. \n \n                                                 \n21 Bank of Ceylon Ordinance No. 53 of 1938 and the People\u2019s Bank Act.

The table below provides a comparison of the Strategic Plan and actual financial results \nfor 31 December 2001\u20132003.22  \n \nTable 1: Comparison of Strategic Plan with Actual Results 2001\u20132003 \n(SLRs million except where indicated) \n \n  Year ended 31 Dec 2001  Year ended 31 Dec 2002  Year ended 31 Dec 2003 \nItem  Strategic  Actual  Strategic  Actual  Strategic  Actual \nPlan  Plan  Plan \nNet Profit After Tax  71  308  339  1,006  737  1,555 \nTotal Deposit  135,112  127,544  154,659  141,836  172,842  157,310 \nTotal Loans and  114,460  121,642  114,792  116,324  119,321  118,042 \nAdvances \nCost/Income Ratio  84%  89%  84%  80%  84%  70% \nProfit per Employee    0.03    0.09    0.15 \nReturn on Assets  0.03%  0.18%  0.16%  0.58%  0.32%  0.81% \nSource: People\u2019s Bank. \n \n65.  The most notable improvement was in net profit after tax, which substantially surpassed \nthe forecasts and improved more than 500% within the 3-year period, lowering the cost/income \nratio from 89% to 70%. The return on assets also improved significantly to 0.81%, which is over \n2.5 times the forecasted result outlined in the Strategic Plan. Also, during the 3\u2013year period, the \nnegative net worth of the bank has been reduced from SLRs6.9 billion to SLRs4 billion, the \nreturn on assets has improved from 0.18% to 0.81%, loan-loss provision cover has increased \nfrom 61% to 78%, and there has been a reduction in the net nonperforming assets to net loans \nratio from 9.3% to 4.6%. The management also focused on reducing the bank\u2019s total exposure \n(i.e. performing and non-performing loans) to the Government and SOEs to 37% as of fiscal \nyear-end 2003 down from 43% 2 years earlier. \n \n66.  The  highlights  of  the  Strategic  Plan  of  2001\u20132003  included  (i)  debt  recovery  and \nstringent credit evaluation procedures; (ii) deposit mobilization, resulting in increased customer \nbase to 9 million people and improved deposit base by 23% to $1.6 billion; (iii) increased focus \non and improved commercial lending, resulting in loans and advances improving by over $100 \nmillion  to  $958  million  during  the  period  (i.e.  PBank\u2019s  smaller  branches  have  not  been \nsuccessful at increasing commercial lending, and their business focus and size needs to be \nreadjusted); (iv) increased focus on human resources, including an improvement in customer \nservice; (v) entering into an agreement with an information technology service provider to \nautomate the branch network with headquarters; (vi) upgrading the pawning branches; (vii) \nimproving treasury operations; and (viii) becoming a primary dealer for government securities. \n \n67.  For the 9 months ended 30 September 2004, profit was SLRs2.1 billion, representing an \nincrease of 16% from the prior year. Cost/income ratio was 70%. Total deposits increased to \nSLRs175.6 billion, an increase of 14.3% from the previous year, while total loans and advances \nincreased to SLRs112.4 billion, an impressive increase of almost 20% from the prior year. The \nmajor accomplishments in 2004 to date include (i) identification of 45 branches that will focus on \nimproving commercial lending; (ii) increased home mortgage loans to SLRs1 billion (up more \nthan 100% compared to 2003); (iii) increased pawning advances to over SLRs3 billion; and (iv) \noutsourced over 200 jobs, thereby reducing staff costs.  \n \n68.  Rationale  of  Restructuring  PBank.  Management  is  continuing  to  implement  the \nrestructuring plan. However, PBank had a negative net worth of $40 million at year-end 2003. \n                                                 \n22 People's Bank historical income statements and balance sheets are contained in Supplementary Appendix D. ", "    15 \nThe core issue confronting PBank impinges on its sustained viability and its capital deficit. As a \nresult of not meeting the prudential regulations of a minimum capital adequacy ratio (CAR) \nrequired to operate as a bank, the bank is operating under a Letter of Comfort from the \nGovernment. There are macroeconomic and macro-political issues that require the Government \nto restructure PBank and to make it viable: (i) PBank has the widest branch distribution network \nservicing the rural sector across the entire country while other licensed commercial banks have \nlimited or no representation in the rural area; and (ii) by not strictly enforcing the minimum \nrequired  CAR  requirements,  the  Government  and  CBSL  are  sending  a  message  to  other \ncommercial  banks  that  it  will  tolerate  non-compliance  with  prudential  regulations.  Fiscal \ndiscipline and sound banking practices are necessary signals that must be given from the \nGovernment and CBSL to the banking sector. \n \n3.  Lessons Learned \n69.  Cluster Modality. PSDP was approved as a cluster program. Because of the uncertain \nsecurity situation resulting from the civil war and the large public debt at the time of the design \nof PSDP design, caution was exercised to avoid adding pressure to the public budget or placing \nadditional demands that could disrupt economic stability and growth. As a result, the PSDP was \nstructured as a cluster with two subprograms.  \n \n70.  PSDP subprogram I covered a broad range of political, social, economic, and financial \nissues and reforms affecting the public and private sectors; investment in various infrastructure \nprojects,  financial  markets  (i.e.  banks,  pensions,  insurance,  and  the  capital  markets), \nregulations (e.g. labor, competition, and financial market governance); and skills efficiency. \nSuch an ambitious program covering a broad spectrum of reforms proved quite difficult to \nimplement especially since it covered politically sensitive issues (i.e. labor issues and pension \nreform). The proposed Program will focus on a narrower area of private sector development that \nis prioritized by the Government.  \n \n71.  Care should also be taken when designing a program as a cluster. Although PSDP \nsubprogram  I  was  scheduled  for  completion  within  2  years,  it  took  more  than  3  years  to \nimplement. Within that time, two elections were held and significant changes occurred in the \nGovernment, parties, approaches, and economic strategies. Moreover, policy reforms originally \nenvisaged in the PSDP for support under a subprogram II were increasingly addressed by other \ndonors. The World Bank, notably, has increasingly focused on supporting policy reforms such \nas reforms for private pension and provident funds, and the unemployment insurance schemes \nthat were envisaged under subprogram II. The IMF has continued to provide assistance to the \nbanking industry. The Development Coordination Matrix is included in Appendix 2. Moreover, \nincreasingly, the focus of ADB assistance by other departments in various sectors, such as \npower and transport, have been on policy, legal, and regulatory framework as well as on \nfacilitating private sector participation in infrastructure. As a result, the indicative scope of the \nPSDP (subprogram II) as originally envisaged deviates quite noticeably from the refocused \nscope under the proposed Program. This issue is explained more fully and included in Appendix \n1. \n \n72.  Recapitalization of People\u2019s Bank. People\u2019s Bank has been recapitalized in 1993 and \n1996.  The  recapitalizations  were  provided  by  the  Government  without  a  requirement  to \nimplement  a  restructuring  plan  to  improve  the  financial  viability  of  PBank.  However,  the \nproposed  Program  is  designed  to  provide  a  phased-in  recapitalization  of  PBank,  when \nperformance targets are met on an agreed time schedule contained in the restructuring plan. ", "16   \nAdditionally, the amount of the recapitalization to be provided will only be sufficient to meet \nminimum CAR requirements. \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n73.  The PSDP loan to the Government, approved by ADB in December 2000, adopted the \nprogram cluster approach with two subprograms: subprogram I and subprogram II. Subprogram \nI was in an amount equivalent to $100 million, for disbursement in three tranches. The third and \nfinal tranche of subprogram I was released in November 2003. \n \n74.  Subprogram II was to be based on the implementation progress of subprogram I, with \npolicy actions subject to revision depending on ADB\u2019s reassessment of the macroeconomic \nenvironment, lessons learned during subprogram I, and status of implementation and readiness \nof the Government to undertake proposed policy reform actions.23 Accordingly, the scope of \nsubprogram II has been refocused (para. 71). In particular, financial sector development has \nbeen broadened to further facilitate access to finance by the private sector, including SMEs. The \nrestructuring of a state-owned bank has also been focused on through the enhancement of the \nefficiency and financial soundness of PBank. The Government\u2019s development policy letter, key \nreform areas, and the specific time-bound actions are defined in the policy matrix (Appendix 3) \nand the program framework (Appendix 4). A description of the policy reform program of the \nProgram follows. \n \nObjective and Scope \n75.  As  indicated  in  the  Economic  Policy  Framework  announced  in  July  2004,  the \nGovernment\u2019s reforms will focus on restructuring Strategic Enterprises to become more efficient \nand profitable, creating a balance between private and public interests, and improving the \ninstitutional and regulatory framework for the private sector, particularly SMEs. As highlighted in \nADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program Update (2005\u20132006), ADB will continue to assist the \nGovernment  in  providing  support  to  financial  markets  and  private  sector  development,  its \nstronger, renewed focus on SMEs, and promoting growth in the rural areas through policy and \ninstitutional reforms.  \n \n76.  The proposed Program seeks to facilitate participation by private businesses, including \nSMEs, in the Sri Lankan economy. The Program aims to do so by supporting government \nreforms  to  eliminate  impediments  to  and  develop  opportunities  for  greater  private  sector \ninvolvement in the economy. Although the country is experiencing economic growth, most of it is \nbeing generated from larger enterprises located in industrial areas. The Program aims to create \na private sector that takes a lead in generating employment, boosting the economic growth and \nraising incomes for a larger segment of the population, including those in rural areas. \n \n77.  The principal objective of the Program is to facilitate private sector development by \nstrengthening the financial markets, including the restructuring and phased recapitalization of \nPBank. The Program comprises a policy loan and a TA loan. The scope of the policy loan \nincludes (i) development of financial markets through (a) increasing the availability of financial \nproducts  and  services  to  the  financial  market;  (b)  enhancing  corporate  governance  in  the \nfinancial market; (c) improving insurance industry regulation; and (ii) strengthening the banking \nsystem through (a) improving corporate governance of state-owned commercial banks, and (b) \n                                                 \n23 See Loan and Program Summary section, p. iii, in the Report and Recommendation of the President on the Private \nSector Development Program in Sri Lanka (Loans 1800 and 1801). November 2000. ", "    17 \nrestructuring  the  state-owned  PBank.  The  Program,  in  the  longer  term,  will  enhance  the \navailability of financial alternatives, reduce overall financing costs, and make it easier to obtain \nfinancing. PBank will play a pivotal role in serving commercial, SMEs, and the retail sectors. As \nthe primary nationwide bank with a significant presence in rural areas, PBank will be able to \nreach out to business enterprises and individuals in all areas of the country. To achieve these \nobjectives, the Program will address the constraints and issues identified in Section III B on \nIssues and Opportunities. \n \n78.  The  TA  loan  will  have  the  following  components:  (i)  capacity  building  and  skills \ndevelopment for PBank; (ii) strengthening the insurance industry through capacity building of \nIBSL; (iii) support to create a national computerized movable property registry through capacity \nbuilding and provision of computer equipment; (iv) provision of banking expertise to SEMA to \nimprove its ability to manage the banks in its portfolio; and (v) provision of legal and governance \nexpertise for corporate securities, financial markets, commercial and banking law, and policy \nreforms. \n \nPolicy Framework and Actions \n \n79.  The Program entails five policy outcomes in two focus areas: \n \n1.  Components and Outputs \n \nFocus Area 1: Development of Financial Markets  \nPolicy outcome 1.a: Increased Financial Products and Services Available to the Capital Market \nPolicy outcome 1.b: Enhanced Corporate Governance in the Financial Market \nPolicy outcome 1.c: Improved Regulations of the Insurance Industry \n \nFocus Area 2: Operational Improvement of State-Owned Commercial Banks \nPolicy outcome 2.a: Improved Corporate Governance of State-owned Commercial Banks \nPolicy outcome 2.b: Restructuring and Recapitalization of People's Bank \n \nFocus Area 1: Development of Financial Markets \n80.  The  fundamental  objectives  of  developing  the  financial  markets  are  (i)  increased \nfinancial  products  and  services  available  to  the  capital  market,  (ii)  enhanced  corporate \ngovernance in the financial markets, and (iii) improved regulations of the insurance industry. \n \nPolicy Outcome 1.a: Increased Financial Products and Services Available to the Capital \nMarket \n \n81.  Financing Through Secured Transactions. The Program will support the legal and \npolicy  reforms  to  modernize  Sri  Lanka's  secured24  transactions  system,  including  the \nestablishment of a computerized national system of registration for securing movable property \nincluding  machinery  and/or  equipment,  which  will  make  it  easier  for  businesses  to  obtain \nfinancing by providing movable assets as collateral for loans. It will also support establishment \nor appointment of an agency responsible for movable property registration. Introduction of a \n                                                 \n24 ADB 2001. Technical Assistance to Sri Lanka for Enabling SME Growth (TA 3822-SRI) for $1.2 million included \nassistance for preparation of a Secured Transactions Bill. Because Parliament was dissolved in February 2004, the \nBill was never brought to the Cabinet. It is presently being reviewed by the Government. ", "18   \nSecured Transaction Bill and amendments to the Finance Companies Act into Parliament will be \nsupported by the Program. \n \n82.  Publicly Traded Securitized Bonds. The Program will focus on introducing publicly \ntraded  securitized  bonds  in  the  capital  market.  A  Securitization  Bill  will  be  introduced  to \nParliament, whereby special purpose vehicles (SPVs) may be established as separate legal \nentities to pool real or intangible assets against which public securities may be issued. The SEC \nwill administer and provide regulatory supervision of SPVs. Securitized bonds should improve \nthe financial sources available for the home mortgage market and other markets and industries. \nPublicly traded securitized bonds should reduce interest rates for borrowers, lower the credit \nrisk for lenders and investors, increase liquidity in the bond market, and lengthen the yield curve \nfor bonds. The long-term effects will be to reduce interest rates and strengthen the financial \nsystem. \n \n83.  Improved Asset Risk Management. The Program will also encourage the development \nof new products and services to improve the performance and reduce the risks associated with \nasset management through encouraging (i) the CBSL to introduce directives for interest rate \nswaps; and (ii) the Government to permit public trading of derivatives and futures. The Program \nwill also support the development of an equity clearing system cycle to improve the clearing of \nequity securities from T+6 to T+3. The SEC will initially require the CSE to submit a plan for \nimplementing the new clearing system, and the SEC will ensure the operationalization of the \nsystem within 3 years. \n \n84.  Sovereign Bonds. The Program supports the creation of the Public Debt Department \nwithin CBSL and the eventual creation of a Public Debt Office, which, through its establishment \nas a separate authority and election of its board members, will become independent from \npolitical or economic influence from the CBSL and MOFP. The Public Debt Office will be \nresponsible for the management, issuance, and modalities of all public debt and guarantees. An \nindependent Public Debt Office issuing sovereign bonds through the price discovery method will \nimprove the method of debt issuance and lead to development of a market yield curve. Such \nreforms would (i) encourage corporate issuers to raise capital through the public bond market; \n(ii) improve debt market liquidity; and (iii) improve investor confidence, thereby attracting foreign \ninvestors. \n \n85.  Harmonizing Taxes. The Program will encourage the tax laws to be harmonized so that \nthe double taxation on money market mutual funds (withholding tax and tax on dividends) will be \neliminated. Harmonizing the taxation rules on money market mutual funds through amendments \nto the Revenue Act and the Companies Act (if needed) would improve the market liquidity of \ndebt instruments. \n \nPolicy Outcome 1.b: Enhanced Corporate Governance in the Financial Markets \n86.  Enhanced authority to SEC and CBSL as regulators. The Program supports the \ndrafting of the Sri Lankan Corporate Governance Code. The SEC will become a more effective \nregulator by improving the reporting, regulations, and functional framework of the capital market \nby  issuing  a  directive  making  it  mandatory  for  listed  companies  to  follow  the  Sri  Lankan \nCorporate Governance Code. Additionally, CBSL shall be given the power to take action against \nfraudulent financial schemes (e.g. pyramid schemes) in the market it regulates. To reduce \npolitical interference in capital market regulation, the SEC commissioners will be appointed to \nreflect diverse public and private interests and facilitate an independent SEC. Moreover, an \nAnti-Money Laundering Bill will be drafted and submitted to Parliament for approval. ", "    19 \nPolicy Outcome 1.c: Improved Regulations of the Insurance Industry \n \n87.  IBSL and the Insurance Act. The IBSL will be made operational by appointing a board \nof directors, a majority of whose members are from the private sector. Additional staff need to \nbe hired to effectively implement, monitor, and supervise insurance companies. Also, to support \nincreasing the availability of long-term capital and the number of institutional investors in the \nbond market, amendments will be made to the Regulation of Insurance Industry Act that will \npermit insurance companies to invest in securitized bonds. \n \nFocus Area 2: Operational Improvement of State-Owned Commercial Banks \nPolicy Outcome 2.a: Improved Corporate Governance of State-Owned Commercial Banks \n88.  A bill will be introduced into Parliament, the SEMA Bill, to permit, among others things, \nBOC and PBank to make all business decisions without political interference or consideration, \nespecially pertaining to the recruitment, transfer, and promotion of employees. The amended \nBOC Act and PBank Acts will provide commercial and political independence to the boards and \nmanagement and prevent the Government from intervening in the day-to-day affairs of these \ntwo banks, including their credit decisions and the interest rates they set on loans to SOEs. \n \nPolicy Outcome 2.b: Restructuring and Recapitalization of People's Bank \n89.  During  the  past  3  years,  PBank\u2019s  management  has  significantly  improved  financial \nprofitability. With the bank in a much stronger financial position, the Government has decided to \nrecapitalize PBank (subject to certain prerequisites described below) for a maximum of SLRs8.5 \nbillion (approximately $82 million) in order to (i) improve PBank's financial viability and meet the \nCBSL\u2019s  minimum  regulatory  CAR  requirements  to  operate  as  a  bank;  (ii)  strengthen  the \ncountry's financial system by having PBank become a strong, competitive, and profitable bank \nthat will contribute to the national budget and become a source of capital formation; and (iii) \npermit  PBank  to  continue  its  existing  business,  particularly  private  sector  and  SME  credit \nincluding  in  the  rural  areas  and  thereby  supporting  the  Government\u2019s  development  and \neconomic growth strategy. \n \n90.  Prerequisites  for  the  Government  to  recapitalize  PBank  include  a  memorandum  of \nunderstanding (MOU) to be entered into between (i) the Government and SEMA, and (ii) the \nboard of directors and management of PBank. In the MOU, management and the board of \ndirectors would agree to the restructuring plan according to the agreed schedule and meeting \nthe outlined performance targets. After appropriate consultation with PBank trade unions and \nthe existing staff management briefing and feedback system, by 30 September 2005, PBank \nmust enter into a collective agreement (Collective Agreement) with the trade union representing \nmore than 85% of the permanent employees of PBank. In the Collective Agreement, the parties \nagree to implement the restructuring plan and meet the performance targets. All appropriate \nlabor rules and regulations will be adhered to. If the MOU and Collective Agreement are entered \ninto and if the performance targets are met, the Government agrees to recapitalize PBank to \nmeet  its  minimum  core  capital  ratio  requirements  in  accordance  with  the  phased-in \nrecapitalization plan for a maximum amount of SLRs8.5 billion.  \n \n91.  An oversight committee appointed by the Government will closely assess the progress in \nresolving some of PBank's major weaknesses, particularly human resource management, and \nwill have the authority to make corrections to the restructuring plan as needed. As part of the \nassessment, an independent review of PBank operations will be performed at least every 6 ", "20   \nmonths. Before the Government injects additional capital into PBank, an independent review of \noperations, satisfactory to ADB, will be conducted. The review will include the loan books, \ncollateral  security,  pension  funds,  the  value  of  investments  in  subsidiaries  and  associate \ncompanies, and information technology to ascertain sustainability as a result of the phased-in \nrecapitalization. \n \n92.  Due to PBank's size, customer profile, and strength of its labor unions, successful \nimplementation of restructuring to resolve PBank's problems would entail close monitoring and \noversight, and would need an estimated time frame of three to five years. A discussion of the \nplans is presented below.  \n \n93.  Injection of Capital Based on Performance. The Government agrees to provide a \nmaximum  equity  investment  in  PBank  of  SLRs8.5  billion  (approximately  $82  million).  As \npresented in Table 2, PBank as of 31 December 2004 is forecasted to need approximately \nSLRs8.5 billion to meet the minimum 10% core capital requirement. The Government agrees to \na phased equity investment in PBank to meet the minimum risk-weighted capital requirement of \n10%. Based upon the forecast presented in Table 2, PBank will meet its CAR by 2007. The \nGovernment's Letter of Comfort will be in place until the actual CAR is met and PBank no longer \nhas a capital deficit. \n \nTable 2: Forecasted People's Bank Risk Weighted Assets and Capital Funds Movement, 2004-2008 \n(SLRs million) \n \nItem  20041  20051  20061  20071 \nRisk Weighted Assets (RWAs)  91,000  93,000  95,000  98,000 \nCapital Required @ 10% of RWA  9,100  9,300  9,500  9,800 \nTotal Capital in Hand of which:  593  4,033  8,617  12,659 \n  Tier 1  155  3,595  6,179  10,221 \n  Tier 2  438  438  2,438  2,438 \nCapital Deficit/(Excess)  8,507  5,267  883  (2,859) \nCapital Funding         \nRetained Profit2  1,838  1,440  1,583  2,041 \nGeneral Reserves  (2,935)  (1,097)  344  1,928 \nRevaluation Reserves3  438  438  2,438  2,438 \nEquity Capital injections4  -  2,000  3,000  5,000 \nOther\u2014Paid-Up Ordinary Share and         \n  Capital Pending Allotment  1,202  1,202  1,202  1,202 \nOther  488  488  2,488  2,488 \nTotal Capital in Hand  593  4,033  8,617  12,659 \nNote: The actual amount and time period of the invested phased-in recapitalization can vary from \nthe forecasted amounts indicated in the table. \n1 All numbers are estimates. \n2 Assumes dividend is paid. \n3 According to CSBL principals, a bank can revaluate its fixed assets every 7 years, but only if it meets tier \n1 capital requirements. \n4 Phased-in recapitalization will only be made to meet PBank\u2019s minimum core capital requirements. The \nforecasted phased-in recapitalization is based upon the forecasted risk weighted assets requirement of \n10% as follows: SLRs2,000 million in 2005; SLRs1,000 million in 2006; and SLRs2,000 million in 2007. \nSource: People's Bank. \n \n94.  As outlined in Table 3, certain financial performance targets must be met on a yearly \nbasis in order for the Government to invest the phased-in recapitalization to meet the minimum \ncore capital requirements. The performance milestones included in the restructuring plan are \noutlined below:  \n \n ", "    21 \nTable 3: People's Bank Restructuring Plan \nKey Performance Objectives for Capital Injection \nDeliverables  31 Dec 2004  31 Dec 2005  31 Dec 2006  31 Dec 2007  31 Dec 2008 \nNet Profit After Tax (SLRs Million)    1,838    2,057   2,262    2,920    3,481 \n30% Dividend1  -  617 679  879  1,044 \nRetained Profit  1,838  1,440 1,583  2,041  2,437 \nCost/Income Ratio  73.5%  72.8% 71.9%  69.0%  66.0% \nReturn on Assets  0.79%  0.84% 0.89%  1.06%  1.17% \nNumber of Employees  10,060  9,700 9,400  9,100  8,800 \nProfit per Employee (SLRs Million)  0.18  0.21 0.24  0.32  0.40 \nNPL to Total Lending Portfolio  17.0%  15.2% 13.0%  11.2%  9.7% \nCapital Adequacy (tier 1 & 2)%  0.7%  4.3% 9.1%  12.9%  16.4% \n1 Mandatory dividend payment for all Strategic Enterprises. \nNPL = nonperforming loan, SLRs = Sri Lankan rupees.  \nSource: People's Bank. \n \n95.  Restructuring Plan. Because employees are promoted based on tenure rather than \nskills or merit, and because of strict labor rules regarding involuntary retrenchment, PBank \nsuffers from overstaffing, ageing employees with low skill levels, and a poor working culture. \nPBank also has an unviable branch distribution network with some branches not generating \nsufficient loan volume to make a profit. PBank has an unacceptably high operational cost \nstructure with the cost/income ratio in excess of 70%. The increase in investment in technology \ncould further increase the cost ratio in 2004. More than one-third of the staff is engaged in \nadministrative, back-office, and non-core functions. The age profile of the staff is unfavorable, \nwith more than 60% above 45 years. More than 2,400 employees will be leaving the bank \nthrough retirement and/or natural attrition during the next several years. Under the restructuring \nplan, there is no VRS to retrench nonessential employees. In order to adjust for overall staffing, \nas well as being able to grow and have the proper skills for the bank on a longer-term basis, \nPBank has been and will continue to recruit one young graduate for every two retirees. Because \nyoung graduates require lower salaries and because the total number of jobs at PBank will have \nbeen reduced by 2008, net saving in payroll costs are estimated to be $15 million per year. \n \n96.  The restructuring plan includes reorganizing the bank into three divisions: commercial, \nsavings, and microfinance/pawning. Unprofitable branches will be converted to savings and \npawning centers if the costs of having a full operational bank cannot be justified. If there were \nno banking facilities available in a town or village, instead of closing down unviable branches, \nsuch branches would offer limited banking services. \n \n97.  The  commercial  bank  loan  division  will  be  comprised  of  loans  to  industrial  clients, \nprimarily SMEs, exporters, and middle-income retail clients. Approximately 50 branches will \noffer a full range of services and will be responsible for increasing the lending portfolio, which as \na result of its cheap funding deposit base should enhance future profitability. Simple low-risk \nretail loan products such as residential mortgage loans, vehicle loans, and educational loans will \nbe offered, and appropriate risk grading and collection will be introduced. PBank plans to reduce \nits high-risk loan exposure to SOEs, from the present level of 24% of total advances net of \nprovisions as at 30 September 200425 to 20% of the total loan portfolio by 2006. To improve \nefficiency and profitability, PBank will focus on middle-market corporate accounts (enterprises \nthat could absorb a loan size of at least $50,000). The bank is also adopting aggressive exit \nstrategies for identified weak customer loans.  \n                                                 \n25 People\u2019s Bank\u2019s exposure to SOEs was 26% of total advances net of provisions as at 31 December 2003. The \nexposure increased to 27% in the first quarter of 2004 but subsequently declined, and in the third quarter of 2004, \nits present exposure is 24% of total advances, net of provisions. ", "22   \n98.  The savings bank division, which will have branches in urban as well as rural areas, will \nfocus on savings mobilization. A $10 million information technology upgrade is anticipated to be \ncompleted by the end of 2004 or early 2005, after which, PBank will offer straight-through \nremittance capabilities (i.e. deposits and/or withdrawals for Sri Lankans living abroad) and other \nservices will be introduced to attract the middle-market expatriate customer, thereby improving \nthe bank's foreign currency deposit base. \n \n99.  PBank is a market leader in the pawn broking business, and the portfolio has grown \nconsistently every year with an exposure of SLRs23 billion as at year end December 2003. \nPBank  will  extend  microlending  to  all  viable  branches  nationwide.  To  make \nmicrofinance/pawning more profitable, the bank will use outsourcing wherever possible. \n \n100.  To improve performance of the recapitalized bank, a new management structure will be \nintroduced, consisting of a five-person team that is directly accountable for the implementation \nof  the  restructuring  plan.  A  board-level  risk  management  committee  has  recently  been \nappointed to oversee measures to further reduce business risks. \n \nC.  Important Features \n101.  Restructuring and Recapitalization of People\u2019s Bank. The Program supports the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts to strengthen the banking system by further restructuring PBank, based on \nan agreed time schedule to meet certain performance and profitability targets. PBank will be \nrecapitalized in phases according to the recapitalization plan to meet the minimum core capital \nratios to maintain its banking license. \n \n102.  Development of Financial Markets. The Program supports the development of the \nfinancial markets, one of the key constraints to economic growth, including SME development. \nThe  Program  improves  the  efficiency  of  the  financial  markets,  increases  availability  of \nalternative  financial  sources  of  funding  to  the  private  sector,  and  improves  corporate \ngovernance. \n \nD.  Financing Plan  \n103.  The program loan will finance the cost of adjustment arising from the proposed reforms, \nwhose total is estimated to be $90 million. The expected costs of the proposed reforms are: \n \n(i)  recapitalizing PBank ($82 million); \n(ii)  drafting, gazetting, and introducing Acts to Parliament under the policy reform \nprogram and the administrative costs for SEMA to manage PBank ($3 million); \nand \n(iii)  establishing and operationalizing the Public Debt Office ($5 million). \n \n104.  The proposed Program comprises (i) a policy loan, and (ii) a TA loan, totaling $65 \nmillion. \n \n105.  The  Policy  Loan.  The  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $60,000,000  will  be \nprovided to Sri Lanka from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the Program. The \nloan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate to be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending ", "    23 \nfacility, and a commitment charge for the undisbursed balance of 0.75% per annum. (A front-\nend fee of 1% will be waived for loans approved before 30 June 2005). The loan will support a \nprogram of reforms and will be released in three equal tranches of $20 million each and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreements. The Government has provided \nADB with (i) reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the \nbasis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n106.  The Technical Assistance Loan. The TA loan of SDR3,318,000, will be provided to Sri \nLanka and financed from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. This loan will have a term of 32 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Program Period \n \n107.  Implementation is expected to last 3 years and is scheduled for completion in December \n2007. The program implementation schedule is included in Appendix 5. \n \n2.  Procurement and Disbursement  \n \n108.  The Policy Loan. In accordance with provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement \nProcedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans, the proceeds of the policy loan will \nbe disbursed to the Government as the Borrower. The proceeds of the policy loan will be utilized \nto finance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding local duties and taxes) of imports produced \nin and procured from ADB\u2019s member countries, other than those specified in the list of ineligible \nitems  (Appendix  6)  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  All \nprocurement will be through normal commercial practices in the case of procurement by the \nprivate sector, or prescribed procedures acceptable to ADB in the case of procurement by the \npublic sector, having due regard to the principles of economy and efficiency. The Government \nwill certify that (i) the value of the country\u2019s eligible imports is equal to or exceeds the amounts \nof ADB\u2019s projected disbursements under the policy loan in a given period; and (ii) the policy loan \nproceeds will be accurately utilized in a manner satisfactory to ADB. The policy loan proceeds \nwill be disbursed on the basis of the certification provided by the Government, which confirms \nthat the above requirements for the policy loan have been met. ADB will have the right to audit \nthe use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. All \nprocurement under the loan will be undertaken through normal commercial practices for the \nprivate sector or the Government\u2019s prescribed procurement procedures acceptable to ADB, with \ndue consideration to economy and efficiency. The list of ineligible items is in Appendix 6. \n \n109.  The TA loan. Procurement of goods and services will be subject to the provisions of \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Office equipment and computers will be procured through \ninternational competitive bidding for packages exceeding $500,000 equivalent, and through \ninternational shopping procedures for packages between $100,000 and $500,000 equivalent. \nFor packages below $100,000 equivalent, direct purchase may be used. \n \n110.  Consultants under the TA loan will be recruited as individuals in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement of domestic consultants.  \n ", "24   \n3.  Counterpart Funds \n111.  Counterpart funds will be used to meet program expenditures and associated costs of \nreform. \n \n4.  Monitoring and Tranching  \n112.  The proceeds of the policy loan will be available for withdrawal in three tranches upon \nsatisfactory compliance with agreed policy actions as outlined in the Policy Matrix in Appendix 3. \nFirst tranche will be released upon loan effectiveness; the subsequent two tranches will be \nreleased during the Program period of 3 years, tentatively envisaged 18 and 36 months after \nloan  effectiveness,  respectively.  ADB  and  the  Government  would  review  the  progress  of \nimplementation of specified policy actions set out in the policy matrix through periodic review \nmissions. A comprehensive mid-term review will be undertaken before the scheduled release of \nthe second tranche.  \n \n5.  Program Management \n113.  MOFP will be the Executing Agency for the Program and the CBSL, IBSL, PBank, the \nLand Commissioner\u2019s Department, and SEMA will be the Implementing Agencies. A steering \ncommittee will be formed chaired by the Secretary, MOFP, to coordinate policy decisions that \nmay need to be taken to pursue reforms under the Program. The committee, which will meet \nregularly and as needed, is made up of key officials from concerned ministries and agencies. \nThe steering committee may also call upon affected sectors for consultations on important \nissues  that  will  have  a  bearing  on  the  Program,  such  as  the  labor  unions,  employers\u2019 \nfederations, nongovernment organizations, academics, PBank, and the CSE.  \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting  \n114.  An  audit  of  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds  of  the  policy  loan  will  be  undertaken  if \nrequested by ADB. ADB retains the right to audit any account and verify the validity of the \ncertification issued by the Government for each withdrawal application. Prior to withdrawal, the \nGovernment  will  open  a  deposit  account  at  CBSL  to  receive  loan  proceeds.  Accounting, \nauditing, and reporting procedures for the TA loan are contained in Appendix 7. \n \n7.  Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n115.  MOFP will establish a program performance management system (PPMS) as agreed on \nwith ADB, and cause it to be operated throughout Program implementation. Under the PPMS, \nMOFP  will  periodically  review  the  Program  for  evaluation  of  the  scope,  implementation \narrangements, benefit monitoring, progress, and achievements. Quarterly PPMS reports in line \nwith ADB's PPMS Guidelines will be submitted to the coordination committee of the Program, \nmade available to ADB and published. Not later than 3 months after program completion, MOFP \nwill provide ADB with a report, including an assessment of overall program performance. \n \n \n  8.  Program Review \n \n116.   MOFP and ADB will undertake a comprehensive midterm review of the Program in the \nsecond quarter of 2006. The midterm review will (i) review the Program scope, design, and \nimplementation  arrangements;  (ii)  assess  implementation  performance  against  Program ", "    25 \nperformance  indicators  and  objectives;  (iii)  review  and  establish  compliance  with  legal \ncovenants; and (iv) identify problems and constraints. If the midterm review determines that \nchanges are required in program implementation, MOFP and ADB will agree on measures, \nincluding changes in implementation arrangements, to ensure that program obligations are met. \nMOFP and ADB will carry out a final review at the conclusion of the Program.  \n \nV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \n117.  The $5 million equivalent TA loan will provide (i) capacity building and skills development \nfor  PBank,  (ii)  strengthening  the  insurance  industry  through  capacity  building  of  IBSL,  (iii) \ncreating  a  national  computerized  movable  property  registry  and  provision  of  computer \nequipment, (iv) banking expertise to SEMA to improve its ability to manage the four banks in its \nportfolio and funds to perform an independent review of operations of PBank on a semi-annual \nbasis, and (v) provide the necessary domestic and/or international skills to draft appropriate \nregulations and legislation for the Program. Further details of the TA loan are contained in \nAppendix 7. \n \nA.  Capacity Building and Skills Development for PBank \n \n118.

The total cost of the TA loan is estimated to be \n$6,000,000  equivalent,  comprising  $4,527,240  in  foreign  exchange  costs  and  $1,472,760 \nequivalent in local currency costs. ADB will finance $5,000,000 equivalent, comprising the entire \nforeign  exchange  cost  and  $472,760  equivalent  in  local  currency.  The  Government  will \ncontribute  $1,000,000  equivalent  to  fund  counterpart  staff,  office  facilities,  administrative \nservices and any taxes and duties on computer equipment. The terms of reference of the TA \nare in Appendix 7. \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n124.  MOFP will be the executing agency of the TA. The MOFP will establish a coordination \ncommittee headed by the Secretary of Treasury and consisting of representatives from the \nimplementing  agencies:  IBSL,  the  Land  Commissioner\u2019s  Department,  MOFP,  PBank,  and \nSEMA. The committee will initially meet within 3 months of loan effectiveness, and as needed, \nbut at least once every 6 months and will be responsible for the overall guidance, coordination, \nand direction of the TA, will review and approve the recruitment of consulting services and \nprocurement of equipment under the TA, and will prepare, review, and approve the TA reports. \nThe day-to-day decisions will be the responsibility of the respective implementing agency. \n \nVI.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Program Benefits  \n125.  There  is  broad  consensus  that  the  future  development  of  Sri  Lanka  hinges  on  a \npermanent peaceful resolution of the civil conflict, and maintaining high economic growth. Only \nthrough higher and sustained growth can the country create jobs, raise standards of living, \nmaintain high levels of human development, and reduce poverty. \n \n126.  The Program, which supports private sector development, will assist the Government in \nmeeting its development objectives. It will help facilitate access by the private sector, including \nSMEs, to domestic sources of financing and capital. It will also support the development of a \nsound,  more  competitive,  banking  system  through  the  restructuring  and  recapitalization  of \nPBank. Mortgage financing will become more readily available which will improve the quality \nand cost of housing throughout the country. \n \n127.  PBank will provide better financial products and services that specifically address the \nSME market, especially in rural areas. An expanding SME sector will stimulate demand for labor \nand lead to the shifting of workers from agriculture and non-wage employment to jobs of higher \nproductivity and higher wages in industry and services. This growth in overall employment and \nthe intersectoral shifting of workers will reduce poverty. Income and employment generation will ", "    27 \nincrease. New jobs will reduce disguised unemployment and underemployment among the less \neducated  low-income  people,  thus  helping  reduce  the  extent  of  poverty.  Since  women \ntraditionally account for nearly half of workers in the SME sector, the Program should have a \nfavorable impact on the employment and income of women. \n  \nEnvironmental and Social Impacts  \n128.  The  Program  is  classified  under  category  C  of  ADB\u2019s  environmental  classification \nsystem. There is no investment project included in the Program and no direct environmental \nimpact is expected. The Program is not expected to generate adverse social impacts requiring \ncorresponding  mitigating  measures.  The  matrix  of  potential  environment  impact  on  policy \nactions is in Appendix 8. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 9. \n \nRisks \n129.   Political Risk. The present cease-fire is in effect after a 20-year civil war, and although \nthe Government has a clear intent to seek a peaceful resolution of the conflict, no permanent \nsolution has yet been reached. Delay of the progress in the peace process could potentially (i) \nweaken private sector development and SME growth; (ii) hinder the development of financial \nmarkets, including attracting the needed investment capital to rebuild and/or modernize the \ninfrastructure of the country; and (iii) undermine the political will to introduce and implement the \nnecessary policy reforms.  \n \n130.  Implementation Risk. Implementation of reform may be delayed because of a lack of \ncapacity and/or skills. The Government has established theme cluster groups, focusing on the \npolicies and their implementation, and capacity building through the TA loan is an integral part \nof the Program. \n \n131.  The law and policy reform components of the Program involve various bills, and/or \namendments to existing acts pertaining to financial and commercial reforms to be approved by \nthe  Cabinet  and  introduced  in  Parliament.  This  includes  the  SEMA  Act  which  is  a  key \ncomponent of the Program. However, there are political risks that such bills and/or amendments \nmay  not  be  enacted  by  Parliament  despite  the  Government\u2019s  strong  commitment,  and  if \nenacted, may not be implemented. \n \n132.  The risk in recapitalizing PBank is whether management will be successful in meeting or \nexceeding the performance targets in the restructuring plan, including the repayment of the \ncapital injected by the Government. The bank must also generate sufficient income to meet \ncapital adequacy requirements in line with the projected growth in assets.  \n \n133.  Restructuring of PBank has substantial labor and human relations issues. Labor unions \nin Sri Lanka are active and their acceptance of the restructuring plan will be key to effective \nimplementation under the Program. PBank is required to enter into an agreement with the union \nrepresenting 85% of the employees by 30 September 2005. There is a risk that this may not \noccur. \n \n134.  Macroeconomic  Risk.  Despite  generally  sound  economic  developments,  the  fiscal \ndeficit has begun to widen in 2004 reflecting inter alia some weakening in revenue performance, \nincreased government spending, a prolonged drought and petroleum price subsidies, which \nhave been exacerbated due to oil prices remaining at an all-time high. The new Government \nhas yet to start negotiation on a new Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) as some ", "28   \nperformance criteria and structural conditions under the now suspended PRGF were not met. \nHowever, following political developments, including the dissolution of Parliament in February \n2004  and  the  general  election  of  April  2004,  the  new  Government  is  firming  up  key \nmacroeconomic policies and is in discussions with IMF on the resumption of PRGF.

The Private Sector Development Program (PSDP) cluster was approved in December \n2000, with two subprograms: subprogram I and subprogram II.

As discussed in the section on \nlessons learned in the main text, the Financial Markets Program for Private Sector Development \n(formerly PSDP subprogram II) focuses on two areas supported by PSDP: (i) increasing private \nsector  access  to  finance  by  developing  the  financial  markets,  and  (ii)  supporting  the \nGovernment\u2019s public enterprise reform program through the restructuring and recapitalization of \nPeople\u2019s Bank.

Background and Rationale  \n \n1.  The Financial Markets Program for Private Sector Development (the Program) formerly \nPrivate Sector Development Program (PSDP) subprogram II is the second subprogram of the \ncluster  loan  approved  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  in  December  2000  and  is \ndesigned to support the creation of an enabling environment for private sector development. \nThe Program and actions are intended to complement  the results achieved by the PSDP \nsubprogram I, particularly in the areas of (i) developing financial markets and the private sector's \naccess to finance, and (ii) strengthening the banking system so it becomes more competitive \nand continue providing banking services to the rural areas by: (a) restructuring the second \nlargest bank in the country, the state-owned bank, People\u2019s Bank (PBank); (b) simultaneously \nimplementing performance targets according to the agreed schedule to improve its efficiency \nand profitability; and (c) recapitalizing the bank in accordance with the phased-in recapitalization \nplan. The Program will be implemented from 2005 to 2007. It consists of two loans: (a) a policy \nloan, amounting to $60 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR) and (b) a technical \nassistance (TA) loan, amounting to $5 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. \n \nB.   Objectives and Scope  \n \n2.  The TA Loan\u2019s objective is to provide technical assistance to support the Program. The \nprincipal objective of the Program is to facilitate private sector development by strengthening the \nfinancial  markets,  including  the  restructuring  and  phased  recapitalization  of  People\u2019s  Bank \n(PBank). The scope includes (i) development of financial markets through (a) increasing the \navailability of financial products and services to the financial market; (b) enhancing corporate \ngovernance  in  the  financial  market;  (c)  improving  insurance  industry  regulation;  and  (ii) \nstrengthening the banking system through (a) improving corporate governance of state-owned \ncommercial banks, and (b) restructuring the state-owned PBank. \n \n3.  In this context, the Program will support the development of financial markets, one of the \nkey constraints of economic growth for the private sector and SMEs. PBank will play a pivotal \nrole in servicing SMEs. As a nationwide bank, it will be able to reach out to businesses as well \nas to the retail population in all areas of the country.  \n \n4.  The TA loan will: (i) provide capacity building and skills development for PBank; (ii) \nstrengthen the insurance industry through capacity building at the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka \n(IBSL); (iii) support creation of a national computerized registry for codifying, operating and \nmaintaining movable property to be used for secured transaction financing; (iv) strengthen \nbanking  expertise  at  the  Strategic  Enterprise  Management  Agency  (SEMA)  to  improve  its \nmanagement of the four banks in its portfolio; and (v) develop the necessary domestic and/or \ninternational skills to draft appropriate regulations and legislation for the Program. \n \n1.  TA Support \n \n5.  Five areas of TA support will be provided to develop the financial markets and private \nsector. \n ", "  Appendix 7  57 \n6.  Capacity Building/Skills Development for PBank. TA in the form of capacity building \nand skills development will be provided to PBank for (i) improving and strengthening the bank's \ncredit and financial risk management system, (ii) assisting PBank\u2019s further development and \nimplementation of the SME portion of its business strategy, (iii) improving customer service and \nsupervision,  (iv)  improving  human  resources  management,  and  (v)  providing  management \ntraining for upper and middle management. \n \n7.  Strengthening  the  Insurance  Industry.  A  component  of  the  TA  loan  will  provide \nsupport to strengthen the IBSL regulation, supervision and monitoring of the insurance industry \nthrough the engagement of an international actuary for 24 months. The rules and financial \nregulatory  requirements  of  the  IBSL  will  be  changed,  as  necessary,  in  order  to  meet \ninternational  best  practice  regulatory  standards,  thereby  creating  a  more  financially  viable \ninsurance industry. \n \n8.  National  Electronic  Movable  Property  Registry.  To  increase  the  availability  of \nsecured financing alternatives, a component of the TA loan will support the development and \noperationalization  of  a  national  electronic  movable  property  registry  by  the  Land \nCommissioner\u2019s Department that will codify and register all movable equipment. The TA loan \nwill also fund the equipment to operate the system.  \n \n9.  International Banking Expertise for SEMA. The TA loan will provide an international \nbanking expert to work for SEMA and interact with various governmental officials to manage the \nfour  banks  (Bank  of  Ceylon,  National  Savings  Bank,  PBank,  and  State  Mortgage  and \nInvestment Bank) in the SEMA portfolio The TA will also fund an independent review of PBank \non a semi-annual basis. The banking expert will be responsible for organizing the independent \nreview of PBank. \n \n10.  Legal and Governance Expertise. Since there are significant policy reforms to be \nimplemented, a portion of the TA loan will be used for legal and governance expertise, as \nneeded, for financial markets, commercial and banking law, and policy reform. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n11.  The total cost of the TA Loan is estimated to be $6,000,000 equivalent, comprising \n$4,527,240 in foreign exchange costs and $1,472,760 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB \nwill finance $5,000,000 equivalent, comprising the entire foreign exchange cost and $472,760 \nequivalent in local currency. The Government will finance $1,000,000 of the local currency \ncosts,  primarily  in  kind.  Counterpart  support  will  include  the  provision  of  facilities  for  the \nconsulting team, as well as any taxes and duties on equipment. Table A7.1 contains the \ndetailed cost estimates and the financing plan. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n  1.   The Executing Agency \n \n12.  The Executing Agency (EA) of the TA will be the Ministry of Finance and Planning \n(MOFP). The MOFP will establish a co-ordination committee headed by the Secretary of the \nTreasury  composed  of  representatives  from  the  implementing  agencies:  IBSL,  the  Land \nCommissioner\u2019s Department, MOFP, PBank, and SEMA. The committee will have the authority \nto make decisions that are essential to ensure the progress of the TA. The committee will meet \nas needed, but at least once every six months and will be responsible for the overall guidance \n ", " 58 Appendix 7 \nand direction of the TA, coordinate the TA, review and approve the recruitment of consulting \nservices and procurement of equipment under the TA, and will prepare, review and approve the \nTA reports. The TA is planned to commence when the Program loan comes into effect, and will \nbe completed over a period of three years with a completion date of December 2007.  \n \n  2.  Procurement and Disbursement \n \n13.  Under the TA Loan, procurement will be undertaken by the five implementing agencies: \nIBSL,  Land  Commissioner\u2019s  Department,  MOFP,  PBank,  and  SEMA.  Each  implementing \nagency may commission studies and procure equipment as programmed under the loan in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Since disbursements under the TA will be \nmainly for international consulting services and equipment supply, ADB\u2019s commitment letter and \ndirect  payment  procedures  will  be  used  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Handbook  for  Loan \nDisbursement. \n \n14.  Consulting Services. The TA loan will require about 112 person-months of international \nconsulting services and 32 person-months of domestic consulting services. Consultants will be \nindividually recruited under the TA loan. All consultants will be financed from the TA loan, and \nwill be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The \noutline terms of reference for the consultants are below.  \n \n15.  IT  Hardware  and  Software.  Computer  hardware  and  software  to  support  the \ndevelopment and maintenance of the database for the national electronic movable property \nregistry will be procured for approximately $130,000, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement.  If  any  packages  above  $500,000  equivalent  arise,  international  competitive \nbidding  must  be  followed.  For  packages  between  $100,000  and  $500,000  equivalent \ninternational  shopping  procedures  may  be  followed,  and  for  packages  below  $100,000 \nequivalent, direct purchase procedures may be used.  \n \n  3.   Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n16.  Separate accounts need to be maintained by each Implementing Agency for the project, \nand these must be audited on an annual basis. The audit report will be due within 6 months of \nclose of the fiscal year to which the accounts refer.  \n \n  4.  Reporting \n \n17.  Project  reports  will  be  provided  semiannually  by  the  co-ordination  committee.  The \nreports will contain narrative descriptions of progress made during the period, changes to the \nimplementation schedule, if any, problems or difficulties encountered and the remedial actions \ntaken, the performance of the TA consultants where applicable, and the work to be carried out \nin  the  next  period.  The  reports  will  also  include  a  summary  financial  account  for  the  TA, \nconsisting of expenditures to date. The final report will be prepared following ADB\u2019s format for \nproject completion reports. \n \n  5.   Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n18.  During  the  inception  phases,  the  implementing  agencies  will  revalidate  the  policy \nobjectives, and assess key issues and priorities, capacity-building, and operational development \nneeds. At the end of this phase, resource inputs may be adjusted as appropriate within the ", "  Appendix 7  59 \noverall budgetary framework and the TA scope, to better align the terms of reference, activities, \nand time-bound outputs with the needs of the Program.  \n \n19.  In addition to regular interaction between the MOFP and ADB, annual reviews will be \nundertaken by ADB that will include an evaluation of the scope of the TA, implementation \narrangements, and progress to date. A comprehensive midterm review will also be undertaken \napproximately  18  months  after  commencement  of  the  TA,  and  based  on  this  review, \nmodifications will be considered as needed. \n \nTableA7.1: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \nForeign    Local  Total\nExchange  Currency \nItem    \n       \nA.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?      No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Sri Lanka: \nThe Financial Markets Program for Private Sector Development is designed to reinforce the achievement of the PSDP \nsubprogram I by providing further support to (i) increase private sector access to finance through development of the \nfinancial markets; and (ii) restructure and recapitalize People\u2019s Bank, a national bank with a strong presence in rural \nand poor areas of the country. It is expected that the outcomes of effective financial services and products and \nprudent corporate governance in the capital market, and market-friendly investment environment will reduce the cost \nof financing, provide additional financial alternatives to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), increase private \nsector investment, employment generation, and provide knowledge and expertise in all sectors. Furthermore, by \nrestructuring People\u2019s Bank and reducing its economic burden on the national budget, positive implications on \neconomic productivity, employment generation, fiscal management, and GDP growth will result in the long run.   \nAs the Program focuses on developing financial markets and strengthening the banking and insurance industries, the \nprivate sector-led pro-poor economic growth would provide better access to credit, savings and insurance products, \nthereby, reducing the vulnerability of the poor.     \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                          Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nThe Program is indirectly pro-poor in supporting the three components of ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy: pro-poor \nsustainable economic growth, good governance, and social development.  Pro-poor sustainable economic growth is to \nbe achieved through the Program\u2019s focus on measures to improve the financial soundness of the banking system and \ncapital market, strengthen investor confidence and increase private sector investment. This, in turn, will attract more \ninvestment capital for much needed infrastructure in the rural area, provide employment, and raise income for the \npoor. To support good governance, the Program focuses on strengthening the regulating authorities and regulations in \nthe  capital  markets  and  banking  system.  It  will  therefore  improve  transparency  through  required  information \ndisclosure, effectiveness of regulation and enforcement, and, ultimately, sustainable economic development. The \nProgram also supports reforms for business regulation, strengthening property rights, and removing obstacles for \ndoing business. Through such reforms, establishment of new businesses will be encouraged, jobs will be created, \nbusinesses will be encouraged to move into the formal economy, and more investment capital will be available to \nstimulate economic growth. In addition, the Program supports better fiscal management and eventual reduction in the \ndebt burden of the country by restructuring and recapitalizing People\u2019s Bank. To support the poverty reduction \nstrategy\u2019s third pillar of social development, the Program supports reforms in social protection programs such as \nreductions in the number of employees through natural attrition or retirement, which will provide long-term additional \noptional protection to the vulnerable poor. Additionally, through the development of new financial products, it will be \neasier to obtain less expensive mortgage financing, which will result in more people being able to afford proper \nhousing and will have a sustainable effect on overall poverty reduction. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nPeriodic stakeholder consultation has been conducted throughout the Program formulation, but did not require specific \nstakeholder analysis, as direct impacts on specific stakeholder groups are limited. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nDuring preparation of the Program, the Mission consulted with all relevant stakeholders to structure representative and \nbroad strategy for participation by the general population for the private sector, including SMEs, and financial market \ndevelopment. In addition, People's Bank, with a strong presence in rural areas, will be recapitalized and restructured \nto better serve the rural poor. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "68 Appendix 9 \nD.
