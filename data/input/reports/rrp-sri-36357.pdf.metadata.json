Environmental  implications  of  the  proposed  policy \nand  institutional  reforms  were  reviewed,  and  environmental \ninterventions have been incorporated as required.  \n \nThe  Financial  Markets  Program  for  Private  Sector  Development \n(the  Program)  (formerly  Private  Sector  Development  Program \n[PSDP]  subprogram  II)  is  the  second  subprogram  of  the  cluster \nloan  approved  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  in \nDecember 2000. The cluster program supports the creation of an \nenabling  environment \nfor  private  sector  development.  The \nproposed  Program  and  actions  are  intended  to  complement  the \nresults  achieved  by  the  PSDP  subprogram  I,  particularly  in  the \nareas  of  (i)  developing  financial  markets  and  the  private  sector's \naccess  to  finance,  and  (ii)  supporting  the  Government's  public \nenterprise  reform  program  in  the  banking  industry  through  the \nnewly created Strategic Enterprise Management Agency (SEMA). \nThe Program will be implemented from 2005 to 2007. \n \nThe  Program  consists  of  two  loans:  (i)  a  policy  (program)  loan, \namounting  to  $60  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources \n(OCR); and (ii) a technical assistance (TA) loan, amounting to $5 \nmillion equivalent, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. \n \n \n \nIf Sri Lanka is to meet its long-term objectives of reducing chronic \nunemployment, raising standards of living, maintaining high levels \nof human development, and reducing poverty, the economy must \ngrow  at  a  faster  rate  on  a  sustained  basis.  To  achieve  these \nobjectives, the country needs to enhance productivity, reduce the \nfinancial  burden  of  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  on  the \neconomy,  and  mobilize  larger  amounts  of  investment  capital  to \nrebuild  the  country's  infrastructure  after  20  years  of  civil  war. \nPublic  resources  can  only  finance  a  part  of  these  needs.  The \nGovernment recognizes that to meet its resource requirements, it \nneeds  to  rely  on  the  private  sector,  while  developing  the \nappropriate market environment for faster economic growth.  \n\n\fii\n\n \n\nObjective \n\n \nAdjustment Cost \n\n \nFinancing  Plan  and  Loan \nAmount and Terms \n\n \nEstimated Program \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency and \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nThe Program seeks to facilitate participation of the private sector \nincluding  small-  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  in  the  Sri \nLankan  economy  by  supporting  government  reforms  to  eliminate \nimpediments  to  and  develop  opportunities  for  their  involvement. \nAlthough the country is experiencing economic growth, most of it \nis  being  generated  from  larger  enterprises  and/or  SMEs  in \nindustrial areas. The Program aims to create a private sector that \nwould  take  a  lead  role  in  generating  employment,  boosting \neconomic growth, and raising income levels for a larger segment \nof the population, including rural areas. \n \nIn  this  context,  the  Program  will  support  the  development  of \nfinancial  markets,  a  key  constraint  for  economic  growth  for  the \nprivate  sector  and  SMEs.  People's  Bank  (PBank),  the  second \nlargest  bank  in  the  country,  with  an  extensive  nationwide  branch \nnetwork  particularly  in  rural  areas,  will  play  a  pivotal  role  in \nservicing the commercial, SMEs, and retail sectors. \n \nThe principal objective of the Program is to facilitate private sector \ndevelopment by strengthening the financial markets, including the \nrestructuring and phased recapitalization of PBank. The Program \nwill have the following elements: (i) developing financial markets; \nand  (ii)  strengthening  the  banking  system.  This  includes  further \nrestructuring  of  PBank,  based  on  an  agreed  time  schedule  to \nmeet  certain  performance  targets  to  improve  efficiency  and \nprofitability.  PBank  will  be  recapitalized  in  phases  in  accordance \nwith  the  recapitalization  plan.  The  focus  areas  of  the  proposed \nProgram build on the results of PSDP subprogram I. \n \nThe adjustment costs associated with reforms under the Program \nare estimated to total $90 million.  \n \nThe  program  loan  will  support  focused  policy  reforms.  A  loan  in \nthe amount of $60,000,000 will be provided to the Government of \nSri Lanka (Government) as Borrower at standard OCR terms with \na 15-year amortization period, including a grace period of 3 years; \nan  interest  rate  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, and \na  commitment  charge  for  the  undisbursed  balance  of  0.75%  per \nannum and such other terms and conditions set forth in the loan \nagreement for the Program. (A front-end fee of 1% will be waived \nfor loans approved before 30 June 2005). \n \nDecember 2007 \n\n \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Planning  (MOFP)  will  be  the \nExecuting  Agency.  The  MOFP  will  establish  an  interagency \nprogram  implementation  and  steering  committee  chaired  by  the \nSecretary  of  the  Treasury  and  comprising  representatives  from \nthe Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), the Insurance Board of Sri \n\n\f \n\n \n\n iii\n\n \nProgram Period and \nTranching \n \n\n \nCounterpart Funds \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n(TA) Loan \n \n\n \nCost Estimate \n \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nExecuting and \nImplementing Agencies \n\n \nProcurement and \nDisbursement \n \n\nLanka (IBSL), PBank, the Land Commissioner\u2019s Department, the \nSecurities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC),  and  SEMA.  The \nsteering  committee  may  also  call  upon  other  stakeholders  for \nconsultations on important issues that will have a bearing on the \nthe  Colombo  Stock  Exchange  (CSE), \nProgram,  such  as, \nnongovernment organizations, and academics. \n \nThe loan is expected to be utilized within 36 months from the date \nof loan effectiveness. It will be released in three equal tranches of \n$20  million  each.  The  first  tranche  will  be  made  available  upon \nloan effectiveness. The second and third tranches will be released \nupon compliance with specified conditions in the policy matrix. \n \nThe  counterpart  funds  to  be  generated  out  of  the  loan  proceeds \nwill  be  used  to  meet  program  expenditures  and  related  costs  of \nreforms for financial markets and private sector development.  \n \nThe  technical  assistance  (TA)  loan  will:  (i)  provide  capacity \nbuilding  and  skills  development  for  PBank;  (ii)  strengthen  the \ninsurance industry through capacity building of IBSL; (iii) create a \nnational  computerized  registry  system  for  securing  movable \nproperty;  (iv)  provide  banking  expertise  to  work  for  SEMA  to \nimprove  its  ability  to  manage  four  banks  in  its  portfolio;  and  (v) \nprovide  legal  and  governance  expertise  for  corporate  securities, \nfinancial  markets,  and  commercial  and  banking,  law  and  policy \nreforms.  \n \nThe total cost of the TA loan is estimated at $6 million equivalent. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  finance  $5  million \nequivalent. The Government will contribute $1 million equivalent. \n \nADB  will  provide  a  TA  loan  of  SDR3,318,000  from  its  Special \nFunds resources for a term of 32 years, including a grace period \nof  8  years,  an  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace \nperiod, and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The TA loan closing date \nis expected to be 31 December 2007. \n \nThe  MOFP  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  of  the  TA.  IBSL,  the \nLand Commissioner\u2019s Department, MOFP, PBank, and SEMA will \nbe \nloan \nfor \ncomponents. \n \nThe  program  loan  will  follow  ADB  standard  procedures  for \nprocurement  and  disbursement.  Proceeds  of  the  loans  will  be \nutilized to finance the full foreign exchange costs, excluding local \nduties  and  taxes,  of  eligible  imports  produced  in  and  procured \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  member  countries.  All  procurement  under \nthe \nProgram will be undertaken through normal commercial practices \nthe  Government\u2019s  prescribed \nfor \nprocurement  procedures  acceptable \nto  ADB,  with  due \nconsideration  to  economy  and  efficiency.

To  withdraw  the  loan  proceeds,  the  Government \nwill certify that the value of eligible imports exceeds the amount of \nADB\u2019s projected disbursements under the loans in a given period. \nADB  will  have  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  loan  proceeds  and  to \ncertification. \nverify \nDisbursement under the TA loan will be made in line with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook. \n \nConsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to \nADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. \n \nThe population as a whole will benefit from (i) the development of \nfinancial markets; and (ii) a stronger banking system through the \nrestructuring and phased-in recapitalization of PBank. A dynamic \nprivate  sector  will  enable  creation  of  employment  and  thereby \nassist in reducing poverty. \n \nPolitical  Risk.  A  cease-fire  is  in  effect  after  a  20-year  civil  war. \nAlthough  the  Government  has  a  clear  intent  to  seek  a  peaceful \nresolution  to  the  conflict,  no  permanent  solution  has  yet  been \nreached.  Delays  in  the  peace  process  could  (i)  weaken  private \nsector  development;  (ii)  hinder  the  development  of  financial \nmarkets,  including  attracting  the  needed  investment  capital  to \nrebuild and/or modernize the infrastructure of the country; and (iii) \nundermine  the  will  to  introduce  and  implement  necessary  policy \nreforms.  There  is  strong  government  commitment  toward  policy \nreforms  although  the  progress  in  the  peace  process  is  largely \nbeyond the control of the Program. \n \nImplementation Risk. Delays may occur in the implementation of \nreforms due to lack of capacity and/or skills. The Government has \nrequested  capacity  building  through  the  TA  loan  as  an  integral \npart of the Program.  \n \nThe  loan  and  policy  reform  components  under  the  Program \ninvolve various bills and/or amendment to existing acts pertaining \nto  financial  and  commercial  reforms  to  be  approved  by  the \nCabinet  and/or  introduced  into  Parliament.  This  includes  the \nSEMA  Act  which  is  a  key  component  of  the  Program.  However, \nthere  are  political  risks  that  such  bills  and/or  amendment  to  acts \nmay  not  be  enacted  by  Parliament  despite  the  Government\u2019s \nstrong commitment, and if enacted, may not be implemented. \n \nThe risk in the restructuring and phased recapitalization of PBank \nis  the  board  of  directors\u2019  and  management's  success  in  meeting \nor exceeding the performance targets. PBank must also generate \n\n\f \n\n \n\n v\n\nsufficient income to meet its future capital adequacy requirements \nin  line  with  the  projected  growth  in  assets.  A  memorandum  of \nunderstanding (MOU) will be entered into between (i) SEMA and \nthe  Government  on  one  side;  and  (ii)  the  board  of  directors  and \nmanagement of PBank on the other hand, to ensure cooperation \nin  restructuring  and  meeting  performance  targets  on  a  timely \nbasis.  The  purpose  of  the  MOU  is  to  give  management  and  the \nboard the freedom to operate PBank without political interference. \nMoreover, the Government agrees to a phased-in recapitalization \nof  PBank  to  meet  minimum  core-capital  requirements  up  to  a \nmaximum of SLRs8.5 billion subject to PBank meeting a timetable \nof pre-established financial performance targets.  \n \nRestructuring of PBank has substantial labor and human relations \nissues. Labor unions in Sri Lanka are active and their acceptance \nof  the  restructuring  plan  will  be  key  to  effective  implementation \nunder the Program. PBank is required to enter into an agreement \nwith  the  union  representing  85%  of  the  employees  by  30 \nSeptember 2005. There is a risk that this may not occur. \n \nMacroeconomic  Risk.  Despite  generally  sound  economic \ndevelopments,  the  fiscal  deficit  has  begun  to  widen  in  2004 \nreflecting  inter  alia  some  weakening  in  revenue  performance, \nincreased  government  spending,  a  prolonged  drought  and \npetroleum  price  subsidies,  which  have  been  exacerbated  due  to \noil prices remaining at an all-time high. The new Government has \nyet  to  start  negotiation  on  a  new  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth \nFacility  (PRGF)  as  some  performance  criteria  and  structural \nconditions  under  the  now  suspended  PRGF  were  not  met. \nHowever, \nthe \ndissolution  of  Parliament  in  February  2004  and  the  general \nelection  of  April  2004,  the  new  Government  is  firming  up  key \nthe \nmacroeconomic  policies  and \nInternational Monetary Fund on the resumption of PRGF. Looking \nforward, the PRGF is not likely to be renewed  before early 2005 \nfollowing  the  finalization  of  actual  results  from  the  2004  budget \nand supporting economic policy framework action plans. \n\nfollowing  political  developments, \n\nin  discussions  with \n\nincluding \n\nis \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka (Sri Lanka) for the Financial Markets Program \nfor Private Sector Development (the Program). \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT  \n\nThe most important political challenge facing the Government of Sri Lanka (Government) \n2. \nis  finding  a  lasting  solution  to  the  civil  conflict.  Following  two  decades  of  civil  unrest,  a  formal \nagreement  to  cease  hostilities  and  restore  normalcy  to  the  country  was  signed  in  February \n2002. Since then, the continuation of the ceasefire and the advancement of measures toward a \npermanent solution for peace have served to support strengthened sociopolitical and economic \nstability. While the Government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Ealam continue to honor the \nceasefire  agreement,  the  peace  process  remains  on  hold  until  an  agreed  framework  and \napproach for negotiations can be developed.1 \n \n3. \nDespite the long period of civil unrest, Sri Lanka\u2019s economy has proved to be resilient. \nGrowth rates averaged 4.2% per year during the 1980s\u2014supported by the commencement of \nthe Government\u2019s liberalization measures and significant large-scale public sector infrastructure \ninvestments,  and  5.2%  in  the  1990s\u2014fueled  by  the  implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s \neconomic policy reform program focused on supporting private sector-led growth.  \n \n4. \nThe  economy  of  Sri  Lanka  has  performed  well  over  the  past  few  years  since  the \nceasefire  agreement.  Gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  was  5.9%  in  2003  and  based  on \nfirst half year GDP growth rate of 5.7%, latest estimates suggest GDP growth of around 5.2% in \n2004, notwithstanding the impact on the economy of the oil price shock and a severe drought. \nEconomic  growth  has  been  broad  based  driven  primarily  by  growth  in  the  service  sector \nreflecting  the  impact  of  improved  security  conditions  on  business  activity.  Although  the  official \nunemployment rate declined from 9.1% in 2002 to 8.4% in 2003, unemployment continues to be \na problem for the country. \n \nStabilization of inflation has been a key component of the Government\u2019s macroeconomic \n5. \nprogram.  The  Colombo  Consumer  Price  Index  (CCPI)  inflation  declined  to  6.3%  in  2003  from \n9.6% in 2002. Although the declining inflation trend continued into 2004, higher oil prices during \nthe  second  half  of  the  year,  and  drought-related  increase  in  food  prices  are  exerting  upward \npressure on inflation, which is likely to average around 7.2% by year end. In early November, \nthe Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) raised key benchmark rates by 50 basis points in order to \ncontain  inflationary  pressure  brought  on  by  the  combination  of  increasing  demand  on  the \neconomy and the impact of higher oil prices on core inflation. The tightening of monetary policy \nis expected to signal the start of a tightening cycle in order to stabilize inflationary pressure. \n \n6. \nOn  the  fiscal  side,  recent  developments  are  a  cause  for  concern.  Following  favorable \nfiscal consolidation in 2003\u2014which resulted in a decline of the overall fiscal deficit from 8.9% in \n2002 to an estimated 7.5% in 2003\u2014the fiscal stance has weakened in 2004. The slippage on \nthe fiscal side is mainly attributed to some weakening in revenue performance, increased public \nspending,  as  well  as  the  effect  of  petroleum  price  subsidies  reflecting  the  surge  in  oil  prices \nduring  the  year.  The  new  Government  has  yet  to  start  negotiations  with  the  International \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2004.  Country  Strategy  and  Program  Update  (2005\u20132006):  Sri  Lanka.  Manila;  and  ADB.  2004.  Economic \n\nUpdate: Sri Lanka. Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nMonetary  Fund  (IMF)  on  a  new  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Facility  (PRGF).  Some \nperformance  criteria  and  structural  conditions  under  the  now  suspended  PRGF  were  not  met. \nThe Government released its 2005 Budget on 18 November 2004 reflecting renewed efforts at \nstrengthening revenues and curtailing expenditures. In line with the Government\u2019s commitment \nto further fiscal consolidation, a reduction in the fiscal deficit is projected from a provisional level \nof 8.6% of GDP in 2004 to a level of 7.6% of GDP in 2005. \n \n7. \nHigh global oil prices are projected to increase the oil import bill from $800 million to $1.6 \nbillion  in  2004.  The  drain  on  foreign  currency  reserves  is  exacerbated  by  the  fact  that  some \n$300  million  of  anticipated  budget  support  from  development  partners  for  2004  will  not  be \ndisbursed. The growing current account deficit which is now projected at around 4% of GDP, up \nfrom  0.6%  the  previous  year,  raised  volatility  of  the  exchange  rate.  The  Rupee  started  to \ndepreciate  against  all  major  currencies,  in  contrast  to  last  year  when  the  Rupee  remained \nalmost unchanged against the dollar. The Central Bank has spent some $550 million to support \nthe currency, only in part being able to replenish its reserves which are now projected at about \n3.1 months of import cover. The Rupee depreciated by 8% in nominal terms against the dollar in \nthe first 8 months of this year.  \n \n8. \nDespite  the  challenges  to  macroeconomic  management,  particularly  resulting  from  the \nexternal  shocks  during  2004,  the  economic  outlook  in  Sri  Lanka  is  generally  favorable,  if  the \ndomestic  imbalances,  notably  the  fiscal  deficit, are  adequately  addressed.  The  Government  is \nfurther  evolving  its  macroeconomic  program,  including  the medium  term  fiscal  program,  and  it \nhas  committed  to  curtailing  fiscal  imbalances  by  introducing  measures  including  those  to \nimprove  weak  revenue  performance.  If  revenue  augmentation  and  expenditure  rationalization \nmeasures  are  effectively  adopted,  the  medium-term  outlook  should  augur  well  for  sustained \nGDP  growth  at  5-6%  per  annum.  Otherwise,  mounting  fiscal  deficits  would  likely  exert  further \nupward  pressure  on  interest  rates,  weakening  the  local  currency  and  possibly  leading  to \nincreasing inflation and lower growth. In the meantime, conventional leading indicators such as \nthe stock market index continues on a bullish path with the Colombo Stock Exchange\u2019s (CSE) \nAll Share Price Index up by 44.8% in the first 10 months of 2004 and up by 88% since January \n2003. \n \nThe Government\u2019s medium-term development strategy, the Economic Policy Framework \n9. \npublished  in  July  2004,  and  further  supported  by  the  2005  Budget,  focuses  on  key  areas \nincluding financial and capital markets reform, improvement of private sector access to finance, \nenhancement  of  small-  and  medium-  sized  enterprise  (SME)  growth,  and  the  reduction  of \nregional inequalities. Foreign investments beneficial to private sector development activities and \ntechnological advancement, as well as public-private partnerships in domestic resource based \nindustries,  and  the  development  of  infrastructure  services  such  as  rural  telecommunications, \nelectricity, and water supply schemes, are also being encouraged.  \n \n10. \nTo complement the Economic Policy Framework, the Government has established three \nmajor  agencies  in  May  2004,  reporting  directly  to  the  President  of  Sri  Lanka.  These  are  the \nNational  Council  for  Economic  Development  (NCED)  to  oversee  and  steer  economic \ndevelopment policy; the Strategic Enterprise Management  Agency (SEMA)2 to restructure and \neventually eliminate budgetary support of 12 strategic state-owned enterprises (SOEs) (the 12 \n\n                                                 \n2  SEMA has been established under a directive of the President by the powers vested in the President under Section \n33 of the Constitution. A SEMA Bill is being drafted and will be submitted to Parliament under the Program, which \nwill ensure the independence of the strategic SOEs SEMA manages. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3 \n\nstrategic  SOEs,  collectively,  Strategic  Enterprises),3  and  a  National  Procurement  Agency  to \nimprove efficiency and encourage private sector participation in the procurement processes of \nthe  Strategic  Enterprises.  The  remaining  nonstrategic  SOEs  will  be  overseen  by  the  existing \nPublic Enterprise Reform Commission (PERC). \n \n\n \nSector Description and Performance  \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR \n\n1. \n\nThe Private Sector and Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises \n\na. \n\nPrivate Sector \n\n11. \nThe private sector in Sri Lanka is a principal source of investment and economic growth. \nIn 2003, it accounted for an estimated 76% of aggregate investment, and consisted of 38,962 \nregistered  private  companies  and  2,236  registered  public  companies,  of  which  approximately \n75% were small- and medium-sized enterprises. The private sector had a dominant foothold in \nmajor  industries  such  as  food,  beverages,  textiles,  wood,  basic  metal,  nonmetallic  products, \nfabricated metal products, machinery and transport equipment, and manufactured products. The \nprivate sector employed about 44% of the workforce, up from 35% in 1990. If the self-employed \nand  unpaid  family  workers  were  included,  the  figure  would  rise  to  84%,  which  compared \nfavorably with 77% in 1990. \n \n12. \nThere is a sharp split in the profile of urban and rural enterprises. Urban enterprises are \nolder  and  much  larger  than  their  rural  counterparts.  Large-scale  manufacturing  is  primarily \nexport oriented and concentrated in the Colombo area, although geographical distribution differs \nmarkedly  across  sectors.  Rural  enterprises  are  likely  to  be  sole  proprietorships  headed  by  a \nmale and based outside the home, established using household savings. The informal economy \nis quite large, estimated at about 45% of gross national income, compared with 35% average for \nthe  rest  of  the  region,  and  16.8%  in  the  Organization  of  Economic  Co-operation  and \nDevelopment (OECD) countries. \n \nThrough  the  Private  Sector  Development  Program  (PSDP)  subprogram  I,4  the \n13. \nGovernment introduced a number of measures to stimulate private sector development. These \ninclude (i) the creation of the Consumer Affairs Authority, an autonomous agency to formulate \nand  enforce  consumer  protection  and  competition  policies;  (ii)  the  establishment  of  the \nInsurance Board of Sri Lanka (IBSL) as an independent regulator of insurance companies; (iii) \nthe enhancement of the capital market through increasing the jurisdiction given to the Securities \nand  Exchange  Commission  (SEC)  by  broadening  its  regulatory  scope  in  securities-related \nindustries  (i.e.,  underwriters,  margin  providers,  credit  rating  agencies,  investment  managers, \nand  clearing  houses);  (iv)  the  establishment  of  a  nationwide  job  counseling  network,  Jobsnet, \ndedicated to job placement and retraining of displaced workers; and (v) the implementation of a \nrestructuring program for the state-owned savings bank, National Savings Bank.5  \n\n                                                 \n3  People's Bank, Bank  of Ceylon, National Savings Bank, State Mortgage  and Investment Bank, Ceylon Electricity \nBoard,  Ceylon  Petroleum  Corporation,  Sri  Lanka  Ports  Authority,  Airports  and  Aviation  Authority,  Sri  Lanka \nRailways, Sri Lanka Central Transport Board (i.e., responsibilities include the state-owned bus company), National \nWater Supply and Drainage Board, and State Pharmaceutical Corporation. \n\n4  ADB.  2000.

Manila.  \n\n5  For further details see ADB. 2003. Progress Report on the Private Sector Development Program (Loans 1800 and \n\n1801) in the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. Manila.  \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nThe Government has recognized that the creation of a competitive and sound business \n14. \nenvironment  requires  an  autonomous  agency  for  formulation  and  enforcement  of  consumer \nprotection  and  competition  policies.  To  this  end,  the  Consumer  Protection  Authority  Bill\u2014\nsubsequently  renamed  the  CAA  Act\u2014was  approved  by  Parliament  in  June  2003,  with \nresponsibility  for  consumer  affairs  assigned  to  the  CAA  and  anti-trust  activities  under  the \npurview  of  the  Ministry  of  Justice.  Since  establishment,  the  CAA  has  been  reviewing  anti-\ncompetition activities in certain industries and has been announcing stiff measures to eliminate \ncartel-like behavior in pricing certain consumer necessities. \n \n15.  With the gradual end of state monopolies and increase in private sector competition, a \nportion of Sri Lanka\u2019s regulatory framework has been modernized. A multisector regulatory bill \nwas enacted in September 2002 covering utilities, petroleum, power, and water, and a second \nbill  for  the  communications  industry  is  presently  being  drafted.  To  enhance  competition  in  the \ntelecommunications  industry,  the  Sri  Lanka  Telecommunications  Ltd.\u2019s  (SLTL)  monopoly  on \ntelephony  services  was  eliminated  by  issuing  external  gateway  licenses  to  independent \ntelephone operators. The Government also divested a majority of its shares in SLTL in 2003. As \na result, Sri Lanka has one of Asia\u2019s most liberalized telecommunications market. \n \n16. \nSri  Lanka's  labor  policies  and  processes  are  relatively  rigid  by  international  standards \nand  are  perceived  to  have  been  creating  obstacles  to  the  expansion  of  private  labor  markets. \nRigidities  have  included  the  legislation  on  involuntary  termination  for  nondisciplinary  staff \nreduction  and  lengthy  procedures  for  dispute  resolution.  The  Parliament  has  approved \namendments  to  the  Termination  of  Employment  of  Workmen  Act  (TEWA)  for  involuntary \ntermination of employment. The TEWA makes it mandatory for labor tribunal cases to be settled \nin  4  months,  arbitration  cases  in  2  months,  and  termination  cases  in  1  month.  Under  the \namended TEWA, an employee will be entitled to a maximum of 1.5 months severance pay for \n36 months of employment. The amended TEWA eliminates the arbitrariness and uncertainty in \nlabor retrenchment, and facilitates settlement of labor disputes. The Government is aware that \nfull implementation will require availability of some type of unemployment insurance scheme for \nretrenched  workers,  which  could  prove  difficult  at  the  present  time  due  to  the  Government\u2019s \nfiscal constraints. As part of social safety, more than 20 Jobsnet centers have been established \nproviding  such  services  as  registration  of  job  seekers,  information  on  job  opportunities, \nmatching  of  demand  and  supply  for  job  opportunities,  and  career  guidance.  A  summary  of \naccomplishments under PSDP subprogram I is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n\nb. \n\nSmall- and Medium-Sized Enterprises \n\n17.  Most  of  Sri  Lanka's  SMEs  are  involved  in  production  (41%)  or  trading  (38%),  with  a \nsmaller  proportion  in  service-related  activities  (21%).  Besides  manufacturing  processed \nagricultural goods, non-agricultural manufactured goods include garments, nonmetallic mineral \nproducts,  furniture,  and  wood  products.  In  the  trading  sector,  the  majority  of  enterprises  are \nengaged in selling processed (65%) and unprocessed agricultural products (57%). \n\nSMEs6 have a pivotal role in the private sector as well as in the overall economy. SMEs \n18. \nconstitute  almost  95%  of  all  industrial  establishments.  According  to  the  most  recent  statistics \navailable,  industrial  SMEs  are  still  only  responsible  for  35%  of  all  industrial  jobs  and  15%  of \nindustry\u2019s  value  added  to  the  economy.  SMEs  are  primarily  located  in  three  major  districts\u2014 \nColombo, Gampaha, and Kalutara\u2014with more than 40% of SMEs in Colombo alone. SMEs in \nthese  three  districts  account  for  72%  of  total  employment  and  88%  of  total  SME  output.  The \n\n                                                 \n6  Defined as enterprises with less than 100 employees. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5 \n\nresults  of  a  recent  survey7  show  that  65%  of  SMEs  are  small  enterprises  while  the  remaining \n35% are of medium size.8 Of the small enterprises, 76% had assets in the range of $10,000\u2013\n50,000  indicating  that  there  are  many  very  small  enterprises  throughout  the  country,  most  of \nthem sole proprietorships and/or partnerships. \n\n19. \nSri  Lanka\u2019s  SME  development  is  not  dynamic  in  terms  of  new  entrants  or  growth  of \nestablished  enterprises,  and  is  generally  constrained  by  weak  development  policies  that  favor \nlarge-scale industries, high transaction costs due to a complex tax regime, a weak skills base, \nand limited access to affordable financing. A well-functioning SME sector, however, would take \nthe lead in generating jobs for economic growth and in raising income levels for a large segment \nof  the  low-income  population.  To  improve  the  policy  environment  for  SMEs  and  focus  on \naddressing  the  major  constraints  to  SME  development,  the  Government  has  established  an \nSME cluster committee within the NCED to coordinate activities that affect SMEs.  \n \nThrough  the  SME  Sector  Development  Program,9  several  policy  changes  were \n20. \nintroduced to reduce the cost of operating and financing SMEs, primarily related to tax reform: \nrationalization  and  harmonization  of  tax  incentives.  These  reforms  included  the  reduction  of \ncorporate  income  tax  for  SMEs,  abolition  of  turnover  tax  on  banking  and  financing  activities, \nharmonization  of  certain  tax  incentives,  and  the  abolition  of  stamp  duty  on  letters  of  credit. \nCommercial  legal  reforms  such  as  the  Bankruptcy  Act  are  underway,  to  provide  for  court-\nsupervised restructuring of enterprises in the event of financial default.  \n \n21. \nThe  Ministry  of  SME  Development  (MSMED)  has  the  responsibility  for  providing \nmechanisms for ongoing SME monitoring, developing long-term SME policy, and implementing \nregulatory  reforms.  It  has  established  five  centers  throughout  the  country  to  assist  SMEs  in \nobtaining  business  development  services  (BDS).10  BDS  include  outsourcing  activities  (e.g. \npayroll  and  accounting);  information  technology  services;  technical  services  (e.g.  design  and \nengineering); and finance brokering. A BDS registry has been developed to better match supply \nand demand in the local market for business support services. Entrepreneurs are able to identify \nand select relevant development services with the help of the registry. The registry includes all \nregistered  BDS  organizations  in  Sri  Lanka  and  is  available  through  a  Government  web  site, \ndeveloped under ADB assistance.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPublic Enterprises \n\n22. \nHistory. From independence in 1948 until 1977, Sri Lanka adopted a socialist approach \nto economic development. Starting from an economy that was primarily based on agriculture,11 \nstate-run enterprises were set up in a number of key sectors.

Manila. \nSurvey data was collected from a sample size of 527 SMEs, comprised of 340 small enterprises and 187 medium \nenterprises, operating in 11 sub-sectors of the economy in 6 provinces, including the Northwest, Western, Central, \nSouthern and Sabaragamuwa provinces. \n\n8  Small- and medium-sized enterprises are businesses with assets (excluding land and building) of between SLRs21 \n\nmillion to SLRs50 million (i.e., approximately $210,000 to $500,000), respectively. \n\n9  ADB.  2001.

Manila. \n\n11 In 1948, following independence, 90% of Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign exchange was earned from plantation crops\u2014such as \n\ntea, rubber, and coconut. \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nactivities  supported  the  substitution  of  imports,  particularly  consumer  goods,  whose  entry  was \nregulated through tariff controls. By 1977, with the establishment of substantive state holdings in \na  diverse  range  of  commercial  activities  across  agriculture,  industry,  finance,  and  physical \ninfrastructure sectors, the state had been an imposing player in every sector of the economy. In \n1977,  policy  was  shifted.  State  planning  was  abandoned  and  economic  liberalization  policies \nwere  explored  to  improve  international  competitiveness  and  encourage  private  sector \ninvolvement.  In  1991,  the  privatization  program  was  initiated  and  by  1996  the  liberalization \nprocess  was  accelerated  with  banking  reforms,  tax  reforms,  tariff  reforms,  and  incentives \ntargeted to encourage foreign investment.  \n \n23. \nAs part of this process, Sri Lanka has made significant inroads in the sale of SOEs. Of \nSri  Lanka\u2019s  200  estimated  SOEs,  approximately  50%  have  been  privatized,  primarily \nplantations, and the manufacturing and services sectors. Since the beginning of 2001 (i.e. start \nof  implementation  of  PSDP  subprogram  I),  proceeds  from  the  sale  of  SOEs  have  been  in \nexcess of $100 million. Proceeds from privatizations enabled the Government to retire a portion \nof its public debt.  \n \n24. \nHowever,  there  has  been  a  negative  social  impact  of  privatization  on  workers, \nconsumers,  and  the  public  in  general.  Labor  issues  became  significant  during  the  process \nbecause most SOEs were overstaffed as employment had been given under political patronage \nand, as a last resort, by the Government. There has been poor worker productivity as profit has \nnot been the main goal in managing SOEs. At the time of privatization, the Government faced \ncritical questions as to how to handle the issue of surplus labor. Although redundancies in some \nSOEs could be as high as 50%, voluntary retirement schemes (VRS) have run into difficulties \nincluding  assessing  who  is  redundant,  and  how  much  they  should  be  compensated  to  retire \nvoluntarily. Also, a lack of a clear Government direction on VRS led to ad hoc packages whose \nvalue rest mainly on the bargaining power of the unions. In some instances, the VRS were so \nattractive that more than the anticipated number of employees left the SOEs.  \n \n25. \nApart  from  the  employment  issues,  social  effects  of  privatization  were  also  felt  by \nconsumers via price increases, poorer quality products, and reduction or elimination of essential \nservices such as bus transportation in unprofitable rural areas. \n \n26. \nStrategic Enterprises. Some of the larger Strategic Enterprises depend on Government \nfinancial support thereby creating a burden on the budget. By the end of 2003, five12 of the 12 \nStrategic Enterprises had received capital injections from the Government in an amount equal to \nSLRs16.6  billion  ($158  million).  In  2004,  the  estimated  capital  injections  total  SLRs11.3  billion \n($108 million). To compound the situation, state-owned banks have been financing unprofitable \nSOEs, resulting in a weakened banking system. Unlike former governments, the strategy of the \npresent  Government  is  to  be  responsible  for  restructuring  Strategic  Enterprises  and improving \ntheir profitability and corporate governance rather than privatizing them.  \n \nSEMA13  was  created  to  manage  Strategic  Enterprises  as  independent  commercial \n27. \nenterprises,  free  from  political  interference.  The  Strategic  Enterprises  have  combined  total \nassets  of  over  $10.5  billion  and  approximately  125,000  employees.  The  Strategic  Enterprises \ninclude four banks (People\u2019s Bank [PBank], Bank of Ceylon [BOC], National Savings Bank, and \n                                                 \n12 The Ceylon Electricity Board, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board, Sri Lanka Railways, the Airports and \n\nAviation Authority, and the Sri Lanka Central Transport Board. \n\n13 The  former  government  was  planning  to  form  a  holding  company  to  manage  the  five  largest  state-owned \ncompanies in Sri Lanka, as discussed in ADB. 2003. Progress Report on the Private Sector Development Program \nin the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. Manila. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7 \n\nState  Mortgage  and  Investment  Bank),  two  energy  suppliers  (Ceylon  Electricity  Board  and \nCeylon Petroleum Corporation), four transportation providers (Sri Lanka Ports Authority, Airports \nand  Aviation  Authority,  Sri  Lanka  Railways  and  the  Sri  Lanka  Central  Transport  Board);  the \nNational  Water  Supply  and  Drainage  Board;  and  the  State  Pharmaceutical  Corporation.  Since \nSEMA\u2019s establishment, the Government has been committed to ensuring that the line ministries \nhave roles in formulating policy, but that line ministries do not give operational directions to the \nStrategic Enterprises.  \n \nTo  improve  profitability,  each  of  the  Strategic  Enterprises  has  or  will  submit  to  SEMA \n28. \nrestructuring plans approved by the respective board. The restructuring plans have been or are \nbeing  submitted  for  consideration  for  the  Cabinet\u2019s  approval.  Each  of  the  restructuring  plans \nshall contain strict budget ceilings to reduce the Strategic Enterprises' impact on public finances \nand to prevent state-owned banks from financing their losses. \n \nSEMA's objectives14 for each of the Strategic Enterprises include (i) improving efficiency, \n29. \neffectiveness,  and  financial  viability  through  appropriate  supervision;  (ii)  ensuring  commercial \nand political independence of board members; (iii) ensuring effective management through the \nboards of directors, a majority of the members representing the private sector; (iv) establishing \nindustrial  benchmarks  and  regional  standards  to  be  achieved  over  the  next  3\u20135  years;  (v) \nobtaining an initial credit rating from a credit rating institute, and improving that rating over time; \n(vi) motivating management to effectively compete in the relevant market while being mindful of \nthe  expectations  of  the  general  public  and  social  welfare;  and  (vii)  ensuring  that  approved \nrestructuring plans will be implemented according to schedule.  \n \nStrategic Enterprises will be encouraged by SEMA to focus on their core businesses. As \n30. \na result, the restructuring plans envisage them to (i) rationalize their assets by either disposing \nof  idle  (non-core)  assets  as  well  as  entering  into  public-private  partnership  arrangements  for \nfinancing  new  projects  and/or  related  services;  and  (ii)  outsource  certain  services which  could \nbe  provided  less  expensively  and/or  with  greater  quality  than  internally    (e.g.  treasury,  fund \nmanagement, human resources development, and marketing). \n \n31. \nA general recruitment ban that had been placed on SOEs over the past few years has \nbeen lifted for Strategic Enterprises. They will be able to recruit qualified managers as outlined \nin  their  approved  restructuring  plans.  The  Cabinet  will  also  approve  a  VRS  to  retrench \nnonessential  employees  for  a  Strategic  Enterprises  if  (i)  the  VRS  meets  the  objectives  of  the \napproved restructuring plan, and (ii) there are sufficient funds to implement the VRS based upon \nthe restructuring plan approved by the board of directors of the Strategic Enterprises. \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Markets \n\n In Sri Lanka, the financial markets primarily consist of banks, insurance companies, and \n32. \nprovident funds. The financial sector is dominated by state-owned institutions, that control more \nthan  60%  of  the  total  assets  held  by  all  financial  institutions  in  the  country.  The  contractual \nsavings institutions especially the state-owned Employees Provident Fund, the Employees Trust \nFund,  and  private  provident  funds  are  also  significant  in  terms  of  assets  under  management, \nand accounted for about 20% of total assets. An overview of the financial markets is contained \nin Supplementary Appendix C. \n\n                                                 \n14 The rights and responsibilities of Strategic Enterprise Management Agency (SEMA) will be formalized in the SEMA \n\nAct. The introduction of the SEMA Bill to Parliament is a second-tranche release condition of the Program. \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nBanks.  The  institutional  structure  of  the  banking  market  defies  easy  description.  It \n33. \nreflects  a  long  history  of  the  Government  establishing  special-purpose  institutions  to  provide \nspecific  legal  powers  to  meet  identified  needs.  Competition  in  the  banking  sector  is  based  on \nproducts and geographic location, not the type of institution. There are 22 commercial banks, 42 \ndepository  institutions  (a  national  savings  bank,  24  finance  companies,  and  17  regional  rural \ndevelopment  banks),  three  state-sponsored  long-term  financial  institutions,  11  insurance \ncompanies,  and  two  public  pension  funds.  The  licensed  commercial  banks  and  the  licensed \nspecialized banks accounted for 79% of the assets of financial sector assets in 2003.  \n \n34. \nThe Banking Act No. 30 of 1988 and its subsequent amendments are the main pieces of \nlegislation that govern the conduct of the banking institutions in Sri Lanka. The Monetary Law \nAct establishes the CBSL. The CBSL regulates, supervises, and monitors the banking industry, \nand the leasing and finance companies. \n \n35. \nInsurance Companies. There were 13 insurance companies at the end 2003, of which \ntwo are engaged in life insurance. The others were engaged in both life and general insurance. \nAfter  the  Government  divested  its  90%  stake  in  the  Sri  Lanka  Insurance  Corporation  Ltd.  in \n2003,  almost  the  entire  insurance  industry  became  privately  held.  The  total  asset  base  of  the \nindustry  grew  by  10%  and  was  SLRs61  billion  ($582  million)  at  end-2003.  The  average  life \ninsurance penetration (premium as a percentage of GDP) is 0.6%, which is low by international \nstandards  (i.e.  2.2\u20133.6%  for  emerging  countries  and  5.4\u20138.4%  for  industrialized  countries), \nindicating a potential for expansion in the industry. \n \n36. \nStock  Market.  The  stock  indexes  have  recorded  significant  gains  since  2001.  The  All \nShare Price Index increased by more than  70% during the 2-year period ended 31 December \n2003. The Sri Lankan equity market has remained fairly small, despite a relatively long period of \nexistence.  Some  241  companies  are  listed  on  the  Colombo  Stock  Exchange  (CSE), \nrepresenting 20 business sectors. Market capitalization remains comparatively low at SLRs263 \nbillion  ($2.5  billion)  or  about  16%  of  GDP  as  of  December  2003.  As  a  result  of  the  ceasefire, \nforeign investors were net buyers at the CSE for almost three consecutive years.  \n \n37. \nGovernment  and  Corporate  Debt  Securities  Market.  Government  debt  securities \ndominate  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  debt  market,  representing  98%  of  the  total  value  of  issued  debentures. \nUntil recently, there has been no market based yield curve because primary government issues \nwere  sold  at  below  market  rates  to  state-owned  institutions.  The  market  is  therefore  large  but \nilliquid.  The  maximum  maturity  of  most  sovereign  bonds  is  5\u20137  years.  Since  1997,  certain \ncorporate bonds have also been listed on the CSE, but such instruments are almost illiquid. The \nmarket  capitalization  of  listed  corporate  debt  is  small,  totaling  SLRs9.7  billion  (approximately \n$93 million) in December 2003. \n \nA number of legislative enactments relating to the financial sector are being drafted (e.g. \n38. \nthe  Bankruptcy  Act,  amendments  to  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  [SEC]  Act, \nBanking Act, and Amendments to the Companies Act) in order to improve regulatory oversight \nand  facilitate  greater  competition  in  the  financial  markets  while  keeping  abreast  of  market \ndevelopments.  However,  reforms  should  be  made  to  further  strengthen  the  resiliency  of  the \nfinancial system and improve the depth and scope of the financial markets.  \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9 \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nDevelopment of Financial Markets \n\n \nDebt  Market.  For  the  private  sector  to  participate  actively  in  economic  activities,  it \n39. \nshould have adequate access to finance at appropriate rates and terms. The ongoing study on \nthe  Sri  Lanka  Investment  Climate15  highlights  finance,  together  with  the  poor  quality  of \ninfrastructure,  as  the  major  obstacle  for  urban  and  rural  enterprises.  The  private  sector  faces \ndifficulties accessing finance in Sri Lanka because the Government uses more than 50% of the \ncountry's  financial  resources  to  fund  the  fiscal  deficit.  As  of  year-end  2003,  Government \nborrowings  were  approximately  $10.2  billion,  representing  106%  of  GDP  and  accounting  for \napproximately 98% of the total debt market value. CBSL, through the Monetary Board, is solely \nresponsible  for  issuing  public  debt  and  the  principal  investors  in  government  securities  are \nstate-owned  institutions.  Until  recently,  government  bonds  were  not  issued  through  the  price \ndiscovery  method,16  and  as  a  result,  the  bonds  were  sold  at  below  market  rates,  primarily  to \nstate-owned  institutions.  To  prevent  losses,  almost  all  investors  hold  bonds  to  maturity.  As  a \nconsequence, although the Government security market is large, there is no active trading, and \nuntil  recently,  there  was  no  true  market  yield  curve.  Additionally,  the  maximum  maturity  for \nbonds is 5-7 years. Longer term financing should be available to rebuild the infrastructure after \n20  years  of  civil  conflict.  Moreover,  due  to  the  absence  of a  long-term  government  bond  yield \ncurve and accompanied by certain tax issues, the corporate bond market remains small. Also, \ncertain  technical  and  legal  issues  prevent  alternative  financial  instruments  to  be  introduced  in \nthe debt market.  \n \nEquity  Investment.  The  CSE  has  existed  since  1896,  but  remains  small  and  illiquid. \n40. \nInvestment interest in the equity market must increase to provide the necessary risk capital to \nthe  country  (only  3.2%  of  private  sector  investment  capital  was  raised  through  initial  public \nofferings  in the  CSE  in  2003).  International  best  practice  standards  should  be  implemented  to \nattract  more  investment  capital  to  the  CSE.  Appropriate  modern  information  technology  is \nneeded to ensure that the clearing of equity securities is enhanced to reduce settlement risk to \nsellers and buyers of publicly traded shares.  \n \nInstitutional  Investors.  Assets  of  institutional  investors  amount  to  approximately  one \n41. \nthird of total bank assets. Despite this large amount of assets, their impact on financial market \ndevelopment and innovation through new products have been negligible, mainly because they \nhave been used as a captive source for funding primarily government debt. Private companies \nfunding needs are largely met internally, or for larger enterprises, from commercial banks. \n \n42. \nCapital  Market.  If  necessary  reforms  were  made  in  both  the  debt  and  equity  markets, \nincluding  the  introduction  of  new  financial  products  and  services  to  manage  risk,  a  better \nfunctioning  capital  market  would  develop,  which  should  attract  more  investors  and  issuers, \nthereby  increasing  competition  in  the  banking  industry,  which  should  have  a  positive  effect  of \nreducing  financial  intermediation  costs17  (average  interest  rate  spreads  for  commercially \nlicensed banks were over 4% in 2003). \n \n\n                                                 \n15 ADB and World Bank. October 2004. Sri Lanka: Improving the Rural and Urban Investment Climate Draft Report. \n16 An international best practice method to determine the price of newly issued securities (e.g. shares and bonds). \n17  Between  1  February  2001  through  31  December  2003,  the  average  weighted  prime  lending  rate  and  average \nweighted  deposit  rate  declined  by  13  percentage  points  and  14  percentage  points  respectively,  but  the  average \nweighted lending rate declined by only 3.2 percentage points during the same period. \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nBanking \n\nindustry  has  not  been  able \n\nIndustry.  The  commercial  banking \n\nto \n43. \naccommodate the financing needs of a large portion of the private sector and serves mostly the \nlarger enterprises and/or enterprises located in the major industrialized areas. Historically, poor \nlending  practices  and  inefficiencies  of  the  two  state-owned  banks\u2014BOC  and  PBank\u2014that \ndominate  the  banking  sector  kept  interest  rate  spreads  high  as  a  result  of  high  cost/income \nratios from poor asset quality and operating inefficiencies. Although private commercial banks\u2019 \nmarket  share  has  been  growing  in  recent  years  (as  a  percentage  of  total  commercial  bank \nadvances), BOC and PBank account for more than 40% of the total market, a decline from 55% \nin  1998.  Although  SOEs  loans  or  loans  to  enterprises  with  government  guarantees  represent \nonly 30% of BOC's and 37% of PBank's loan portfolio, such loans account for the bulk of their \nnonperforming loans.  \n \n44.  Most other banks, including private ones, also suffer from high levels of nonperforming \nloans,  inadequate  provisioning,  heavy  reliance  on  collateral  security,  and  high  cost/income \nratios. Banks\u2019 interest rate spreads remain high although there has been an overall reduction of \ninterest rates. Because there is little competition, private banks take advantage of state banks\u2019 \nhigh  operating  costs  to  charge  similarly  high  rates  of  interest  to  their  borrowers.  Until  weak \nbanks (state-owned and private) are restructured or exit the market, competition will be limited \nand margins will remain high. \n \nLegal  System  Foreclosure.  The  legal  system  has  also  been  ineffective  in  protecting \n45. \ncreditors\u2019 interests. Although certain laws have been introduced to strengthen creditors\u2019 rights18 \nto recover loans and advances, borrowers have been successful in obtaining injunctions against  \nrecovery  efforts  from  banks,  resulting  in  a  burden  of  non-performing  loans  on  banks\u2019  balance \nsheets. \n \n\na. \n\nRequired Improvement in Financial Products and Services Available \nto the Capital Market \n\n \n46.  Mortgage Financing. At the end of 2003, the mortgage market was worth $220 million. \nWithin  a  relatively  short  time,  as  a  result  of  the  ceasefire,  the  demand  for  home  mortgage \nfinancing had grown rapidly. New housing loans in 2003 grew by $80 million. Traditionally, the \nGovernment has supplied 20\u201325% of all home mortgage financing. The system is not viable in \nthe longer term because the Government is reluctant to foreclose on defaulted borrowers and \nhas  a  limited  budget  to  finance  the  increased  demand  in  mortgage  financing.  Mortgage \nfinancing provided by commercial banks, and to a limited extent, mortgage banks is offered in \ntenors  of  15  to  20  years.  However,  interest  rates  are  high  (approximately  13%)  because  of \nfinancial  risks  resulting  from  a  mismatch  of  funding  long-term  fixed  rate  mortgage  loans  with \nshort-term variable rate deposits.  \n \nLike  most  developing  countries,  Sri  Lanka  suffers  from  a  significant  housing  shortage. \n47. \nThe  country  currently  lacks  400,000  housing  units,  and  that  number  is  set  to  increase  to \napproximately 650,000 units by 2010. A large proportion of the existing housing is substandard \nand  lack  essential  amenities.  Because  mortgage  financing  is  unattractive,  there  are  few  new \nhousing  starts.  Private  sector  housing  construction  could  be  an  increasingly  important \ncontribution to economic growth. Improved mortgage financing is necessary to improve housing \nstandards  and  provide  jobs.  An  alternative  financing  method,  such  as  the  issuance  of \nsecuritized bonds secured by mortgage receivables, could substantially improve the amount of \n\n                                                 \n18 Parate rights are granted by law to commercial banks and other specialized banks. In the case of default, parate \n\nrights give these institutions a right to quickly repossess collateralized property. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11 \n\nfunds  available  for  financing  home  mortgages,  as  well  as  improve  interest  rates  offered  for \nmortgage financing. \n \n48. \nFinancing  Movable  Property.  Sri  Lankan  banks  are  providing  financing  primarily \nagainst collateral in the form of fixed assets and/or personal guarantees. However, banks do not \nreadily finance movable assets such as computers and industrial equipment because they risk \nnot  finding  the  collateral  in  the  event  of  default.  Registries  for  movable  property  exist  in  Sri \nLanka  but  are  many  and  disbursed  throughout  the  country:  each  district  has  its  own  registry, \nmaking  it  difficult  for  banks  to  keep  track  of  pledged  collateral  nationwide.  The  private  sector \nand  SMEs,  in  particular,  need  financing  for  movable  property.  If  a  national  registry  were \nestablished, banks would be more receptive to providing financing secured by movable assets. \nA  national  movable  property  registry  needs  to  be  developed  to  replace  the  present \ndecentralized ad hoc system.  \n \n49. \nEquity  Market.  Since  the  ceasefire  took  effect,  the  CSE  has  increased  its  market \ncapitalization and trading volume. Still, the products and services offered are limited, especially \nin  the  area  of  risk  management.  Most  shares  listed  on  the  CSE  are  not  actively  traded.  To \nattract  more  domestic  and  foreign  investors  who  could  provide  capital  to  the  country,  investor \nconfidence  should  be  strengthened  by  improving  corporate  governance  through  establishing \ninternational best practice standards of corporate governance.  \n \n50. \nEquity  Trading  Settlement  Cycle.  The  main  responsibility  of  the  Central  Depository \nSystem  is  to  support  settlement  of  traded  securities  and  to  minimize  the  settlement  risk. \nStandard international equity settlement requirements require (i) final settlement cycle to occur \nno later than the trade date plus 3 days (T+3); and (ii) payment for securities to occur only on \ndelivery of securities to the buyer (i.e. delivery versus payment [DVP]).  The Sri Lankan equity \nsettlement system has a cycle equal to the trade date plus 6 days (T+6) and there is no DVP \nsystem, resulting in buyers and sellers of Sri Lankan equities taking more financial and market \nexposure risks when compared with other international markets. \n \n51.  Mutual  Funds.  By  the  end  of  2003,  total  assets  under  management  of  the  12 \nestablished mutual funds amounted to approximately $36 million. Although mutual funds are in \na position to provide investors with the benefits of diversification, the industry has not been able \nto  grow  quickly  enough.  Factors  limiting  the  growth  of  the  mutual  funds  industry  include  high \nvolatility  in  the  equity  market,  a  narrow  range  of  instruments  to  manage  financial  risks,  and \nunfavorable  tax  treatment  (i.e.  double  taxation  resulting  from  taxes  paid  on  interest  and/or \ndividend  income  by  the  mutual  fund,  and  capital  gains  tax  paid  on  the  mutual  fund  by  the \ninvestor). Improving the tax treatment for mutual funds should attract smaller investors to invest \nin  mutual  funds,  particularly,  money  market  mutual  funds,  which  will  have  on  overall  positive \neffect on the bond market. \n \n\nb. \n\nEnhanced Corporate Governance in the Financial Markets \n\n \n52. \nIssuance  and  Sale  of  Public  Debt.  CBSL  is  responsible  for  developing  and \nimplementing  monetary  policy.  However,  the  Monetary  Board,  which  reports  to  CBSL,  is \nresponsible for issuing and selling all public debt. This results in a conflict of interest with CBSL \nwhen the Monetary Board is ascertaining the amount, timing, and maturity of issued securities. \nThe  responsibility  for  developing  and  implementing  monetary  policy  should  be  completely \nindependent from the issuance and sale of public debt. In so doing, the pricing of government \ndebt will be more transparent and a true market yield curve will develop.  \n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nIncreased Supervision of the Financial Regulators. The SEC regulates the securities \n53. \nmarket,  as  well  as  licensing  the  CSE  and  its  broker  members  while  the  CBSL  fundamentally \nregulates  banks.  However,  there  are  a  number  of  smaller  nonregulated  financial  entities \nfraudulently  issuing  or  selling  securities  or  other  interests  to  the  general  public  and  that  are \noutside  the  realm  of  the  financial  regulators  (SEC,  CBSL,  CSE,  and  Insurance  Board  of  Sri \nLanka  [IBSL]).  In  effect,  this  allows  such  entities  to  issue  securities  and  interests  and  employ \nother  means  of  raising  finance  without  the  oversight  of  the  regulators,  posing  a  risk  to  the \nstability  of  the  financial  system.  Regulating  agencies  need  to  be  given  the  legal  power  and \nauthority to take action against fraudulent financial schemes. \n \n54. \nIndependence of SEC. The SEC Act provides that the majority of SEC commissioners \n(7 of 10) including the chairman, be appointed by the Ministry of Finance and Planning (MOFP). \nHowever,  from  the  point  of  view  of  international  best  practice,  the  regulator  should  be \noperationally  independent  from  external  political  or  commercial  interference  and  be  held  fully \naccountable in the exercise of its powers and functions. \n \nCorporate Governance Code. To improve corporate governance of listed securities on \n55. \nthe  CSE,  the  SEC  should  issue  a  regulation  or  directive  making  it  mandatory  for  listed \ncompanies to use a code of best practice for corporate governance19 following international best \npractice standards. Mandatory corporate governance provisions should be adopted to improve \ninvestor confidence in the financial markets.  \n \n56. \nPrevention of Money Laundering. IMF has been providing technical assistance (TA) to \nSri Lanka to avoid Sri Lanka\u2019s financial system being used for money laundering activities. The \nAnti-Money Laundering Bill needs to be introduced to Parliament. \n \n\nc. \n\nImproved Regulations of the Insurance Industry \n\nSince 2001, the regulation of the insurance industry has been brought under the IBSL.20 \n57. \nWhile IBSL is an independent entity, it currently operates within the SEC, with most of its staff \nbeing  utilized  on  a  shared  basis.  Given  its  short  history,  under-staffing  and  lack  of  a  board  of \ndirectors,  IBSL  does  not  function  properly  as  a  regulator.  The  insurance  industry  manages \nroughly one third of the total assets in the financial market. Many of the insurance companies \nlack financial strength and some may be in danger of meeting required financial coverage and \nreserve ratios. The first step in making the IBSL operational is to appoint a board of directors. \nAlso,  IBSL\u2019s  capacity  must  be  improved  in  order  to  monitor  and  supervise  the  insurance \ninsurance  companies  comply  with  prudential  requirements,  and  meet \nindustry,  have \ninternational best practice standards.  \n \n58. \nBecause  there  are  few  long-term  financial  products  in  the  debt  market,  life  insurance \ncompanies face significant portfolio risks since they are unable to match the maturities of their \ninvestment  with  the  liabilities  in  their  portfolios  (e.g.  investments,  on  average,  have  maturities \nwith  3\u20135  years  while liability  of  life insurance companies  have  maturities  with  20  to  30  years). \nAlthough life insurance companies have long-term liabilities, they have not become a significant \ninstitutional investor group providing the much-needed capital for infrastructure investments and \nsustainable growth. Insurance companies should be permitted to invest in securitized bonds.  \n                                                 \n19 ADB.  2000.

Management is \nformally constrained from making independent commercial decisions on credit, terms of loans, \ninterest  rates,  recruitment,  salaries,  and  employee  incentives.  During  the  past  4  years,  the \nbanks  have  been  managed  independently,  but  the  BOC  and  PBank  Acts  need  to  be  formally \namended to ensure the commercial and political independence of the boards and management.  \n \n60. \nPeople\u2019s  Bank.  PBank,  one  of  the  12  Strategic  Enterprises  managed  by  SEMA,  was \nestablished  in  1961  to  develop  the  cooperative  movement  of  Sri  Lanka  and  enhance  rural \nbanking.  Presently,  the  Government  owns  92%  of  PBank  and  the  Sri  Lankan  Cooperative \nSocieties  own  the  remaining  8%.  Based  upon  assets  of  SLRs206  billion  (approximately  $2 \nbillion)  as  of  end-2003,  PBank  has  a  market  share  of  over  22%,  and  is  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  second \nlargest  bank.  Through  its  325  branches,  the  largest  banking  network  in  the  country,  PBank \nprovides  such  services  as  corporate  banking,  SME  financing,  trade  finance,  and  retail  and \nconsumer finance. Approximately 50% of PBank\u2019s branches serve rural areas. PBank employs \nmore than 10,000 people.  \n \nSME  financing  and  corporate/commercial  banking  account  for  approximately  16%  and \n61. \n40% of the loan portfolio, respectively. Of the total corporate/commercial lending, 24% are total \nadvances  net  of  provisioning  to  SOEs  or  to  borrowers  guaranteed  by  the  Government.  As  a \nresult of the bank\u2019s relatively large exposure to pawn brokerage (25% of the loan portfolio) and \nits  significant  branch  network,  PBank  has  a  large  deposit  base  that  provides  PBank  with \ninexpensive funding. However, its exposure to consumer lending is low, representing only 10% \nof  the  loan  portfolio.  PBank  needs  to  avail  itself  of  low-cost  funding  by  increasing  consumer \nlending  and  thereby  improve  its  profitability.  PBank  also  provides  lease  financing  through  its \nsubsidiaries. Although leasing represents only 0.3% of PBank\u2019s total loan portfolio, it is one of \nthe  bank\u2019s  more  profitable  business  areas  (approximately  13%  of  consolidated  income).  Real \nestate development and corporate finance are other small business areas. \n \nPoor  management  over  a  period  of  time,  characterized  by  high  operating  costs  and \n62. \npolitically  influenced  lending  practices,  resulted  in  poor  asset  quality  and  poor  credit  culture \nseverely  impacting  PBank's  financial  profile.  In  1993  and  1996,  the  Government  recapitalized \nPBank  (SLRs10.5  billion  in  1993  and  SLRs10.0  billion  in  1996).  These  capital  injections  were \nnot accompanied by any restructuring of PBank so the financial deterioration did not stop.  \n \n63. \nPast Performance. Substantive changes were made in 1999 to depoliticize PBank. New \nboard members were appointed from the private sector. Top management, also from the private \nsector  and  with  significant  international  banking  experience,  was  hired  in  2001,  significantly \nreducing  political  influence  on  bank  management  and  operations.  The  new  management \ndecided to restructure PBank and introduce substantial operational improvements by preparing \nand  implementing  a  strategic  plan  (2001\u20132003)  (Strategic  Plan).  Such  measures  included \nreducing  the  cost  structure,  introducing  risk  management  techniques,  and  ensuring  sharper \ncustomer focus. \n \n\n                                                 \n21 Bank of Ceylon Ordinance No. 53 of 1938 and the People\u2019s Bank Act.

The return on assets also improved significantly to 0.81%, which is over \n2.5 times the forecasted result outlined in the Strategic Plan. Also, during the 3\u2013year period, the \nnegative  net  worth  of  the  bank  has  been  reduced  from  SLRs6.9  billion  to  SLRs4  billion,  the \nreturn  on  assets  has  improved  from  0.18%  to  0.81%,  loan-loss  provision  cover  has  increased \nfrom 61% to 78%, and there has been a reduction in the net nonperforming assets to net loans \nratio from 9.3% to 4.6%. The management also focused on reducing the bank\u2019s total exposure \n(i.e.  performing  and  non-performing  loans)  to  the  Government  and  SOEs  to  37%  as  of  fiscal \nyear-end 2003 down from 43% 2 years earlier. \n \n66. \nThe  highlights  of  the  Strategic  Plan  of  2001\u20132003  included  (i)  debt  recovery  and \nstringent credit evaluation procedures; (ii) deposit mobilization, resulting in increased customer \nbase to 9 million people and improved deposit base by 23% to $1.6 billion; (iii) increased focus \non and improved commercial lending, resulting in loans and advances improving by over $100 \nmillion  to  $958  million  during  the  period  (i.e.  PBank\u2019s  smaller  branches  have  not  been \nsuccessful  at  increasing  commercial  lending,  and  their  business  focus  and  size  needs  to  be \nreadjusted);  (iv)  increased  focus  on  human  resources,  including  an  improvement  in  customer \nservice;  (v)  entering  into  an  agreement  with  an  information  technology  service  provider  to \nautomate  the  branch  network  with  headquarters;  (vi)  upgrading  the  pawning  branches;  (vii) \nimproving treasury operations; and (viii) becoming a primary dealer for government securities. \n \n67. \nFor the 9 months ended 30 September 2004, profit was SLRs2.1 billion, representing an \nincrease  of  16%  from  the  prior  year.  Cost/income  ratio  was  70%.  Total  deposits  increased  to \nSLRs175.6 billion, an increase of 14.3% from the previous year, while total loans and advances \nincreased to SLRs112.4 billion, an impressive increase of almost 20% from the prior year. The \nmajor accomplishments in 2004 to date include (i) identification of 45 branches that will focus on \nimproving  commercial  lending;  (ii)  increased  home  mortgage  loans  to  SLRs1  billion  (up  more \nthan 100% compared to 2003); (iii) increased pawning advances to over SLRs3 billion; and (iv) \noutsourced over 200 jobs, thereby reducing staff costs.  \n \n68. \nRationale  of  Restructuring  PBank.  Management  is  continuing  to  implement  the \nrestructuring plan. However, PBank had a negative net worth of $40 million at year-end 2003. \n\n                                                 \n22 People's Bank historical income statements and balance sheets are contained in Supplementary Appendix D. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15 \n\nThe core issue confronting PBank impinges on its sustained viability and its capital deficit. As a \nresult  of  not  meeting  the  prudential  regulations  of  a  minimum  capital  adequacy  ratio  (CAR) \nrequired  to  operate  as  a  bank,  the  bank  is  operating  under  a  Letter  of  Comfort  from  the \nGovernment. There are macroeconomic and macro-political issues that require the Government \nto restructure PBank and to make it viable: (i) PBank has the widest branch distribution network \nservicing the rural sector across the entire country while other licensed commercial banks have \nlimited  or  no  representation  in  the  rural  area;  and  (ii)  by  not  strictly  enforcing  the  minimum \nrequired  CAR  requirements,  the  Government  and  CBSL  are  sending  a  message  to  other \ncommercial  banks  that  it  will  tolerate  non-compliance  with  prudential  regulations.  Fiscal \ndiscipline  and  sound  banking  practices  are  necessary  signals  that  must  be  given  from  the \nGovernment and CBSL to the banking sector. \n \n\n3. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n69. \nCluster Modality. PSDP was approved as a cluster program. Because of the uncertain \nsecurity situation resulting from the civil war and the large public debt at the time of the design \nof PSDP design, caution was exercised to avoid adding pressure to the public budget or placing \nadditional demands that could disrupt economic stability and growth. As a result, the PSDP was \nstructured as a cluster with two subprograms.  \n \nPSDP subprogram I covered a broad range of political, social, economic, and financial \n70. \nissues and reforms affecting the public and private sectors; investment in various infrastructure \nprojects,  financial  markets  (i.e.  banks,  pensions,  insurance,  and  the  capital  markets), \nregulations  (e.g.  labor,  competition,  and  financial  market  governance);  and  skills  efficiency. \nSuch  an  ambitious  program  covering  a  broad  spectrum  of  reforms  proved  quite  difficult  to \nimplement especially since it covered politically sensitive issues (i.e. labor issues and pension \nreform). The proposed Program will focus on a narrower area of private sector development that \nis prioritized by the Government.  \n \n71. \nCare  should  also  be  taken  when  designing  a  program  as  a  cluster.  Although  PSDP \nsubprogram  I  was  scheduled  for  completion  within  2  years,  it  took  more  than  3  years  to \nimplement.  Within  that  time,  two  elections  were  held  and  significant  changes  occurred  in  the \nGovernment, parties, approaches, and economic strategies. Moreover, policy reforms originally \nenvisaged in the PSDP for support under a subprogram II were increasingly addressed by other \ndonors.  The  World  Bank,  notably,  has  increasingly  focused  on  supporting  policy  reforms  such \nas reforms for private pension and provident funds, and the unemployment insurance schemes \nthat were envisaged under subprogram II. The IMF has continued to provide assistance to the \nbanking  industry.  The  Development  Coordination  Matrix  is  included  in  Appendix  2.  Moreover, \nincreasingly,  the  focus  of  ADB  assistance  by  other  departments  in  various  sectors,  such  as \npower  and  transport,  have  been  on  policy,  legal,  and  regulatory  framework  as  well  as  on \nfacilitating  private  sector  participation  in  infrastructure.  As  a  result,  the  indicative  scope  of  the \nPSDP  (subprogram  II)  as  originally  envisaged  deviates  quite  noticeably  from  the  refocused \nscope under the proposed Program. This issue is explained more fully and included in Appendix \n1. \n \n72. \nRecapitalization of People\u2019s Bank. People\u2019s Bank has been recapitalized in 1993 and \n1996.  The  recapitalizations  were  provided  by  the  Government  without  a  requirement  to \nimplement  a  restructuring  plan  to  improve  the  financial  viability  of  PBank.  However,  the \nproposed  Program  is  designed  to  provide  a  phased-in  recapitalization  of  PBank,  when \nperformance  targets  are  met  on  an  agreed  time  schedule  contained  in  the  restructuring  plan. \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nAdditionally,  the  amount  of  the  recapitalization  to  be  provided  will  only  be  sufficient  to  meet \nminimum CAR requirements. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\n73. \nThe PSDP loan to the Government, approved by ADB in December 2000, adopted the \nprogram cluster approach with two subprograms: subprogram I and subprogram II. Subprogram \nI was in an amount equivalent to $100 million, for disbursement in three tranches. The third and \nfinal tranche of subprogram I was released in November 2003. \n \n74. \nSubprogram  II  was  to  be  based  on  the  implementation  progress  of  subprogram  I,  with \npolicy  actions  subject  to  revision  depending  on  ADB\u2019s  reassessment  of  the  macroeconomic \nenvironment, lessons learned during subprogram I, and status of implementation and readiness \nof  the  Government  to  undertake  proposed  policy  reform  actions.23  Accordingly,  the  scope  of \nsubprogram  II  has  been  refocused  (para.  71).  In  particular,  financial  sector  development  has \nbeen broadened to further facilitate access to finance by the private sector, including SMEs. The \nrestructuring of a state-owned bank has also been focused on through the enhancement of the \nefficiency and financial soundness of PBank. The Government\u2019s development policy letter, key \nreform areas, and the specific time-bound actions are defined in the policy matrix (Appendix 3) \nand  the  program  framework  (Appendix  4).  A  description  of  the  policy  reform  program  of  the \nProgram follows. \n \nObjective and Scope \n\nAs  indicated  in  the  Economic  Policy  Framework  announced  in  July  2004,  the \n75. \nGovernment\u2019s reforms will focus on restructuring Strategic Enterprises to become more efficient \nand  profitable,  creating  a  balance  between  private  and  public  interests,  and  improving  the \ninstitutional and regulatory framework for the private sector, particularly SMEs. As highlighted in \nADB\u2019s  Country  Strategy  and  Program  Update  (2005\u20132006),  ADB  will  continue  to  assist  the \nGovernment  in  providing  support  to  financial  markets  and  private  sector  development,  its \nstronger, renewed focus on SMEs, and promoting growth in the rural areas through policy and \ninstitutional reforms.  \n \n76. \nThe proposed Program seeks to facilitate participation by private businesses, including \nSMEs,  in  the  Sri  Lankan  economy.  The  Program  aims  to  do  so  by  supporting  government \nreforms  to  eliminate  impediments  to  and  develop  opportunities  for  greater  private  sector \ninvolvement in the economy. Although the country is experiencing economic growth, most of it is \nbeing generated from larger enterprises located in industrial areas. The Program aims to create \na private sector that takes a lead in generating employment, boosting the economic growth and \nraising incomes for a larger segment of the population, including those in rural areas. \n \n77. \nThe  principal  objective  of  the  Program  is  to  facilitate  private  sector  development  by \nstrengthening  the  financial  markets,  including  the  restructuring  and  phased  recapitalization  of \nPBank.  The  Program  comprises  a  policy  loan  and  a  TA  loan.  The  scope  of  the  policy  loan \nincludes (i) development of financial markets through (a) increasing the availability of financial \nproducts  and  services  to  the  financial  market;  (b)  enhancing  corporate  governance  in  the \nfinancial market; (c) improving insurance industry regulation; and (ii) strengthening the banking \nsystem through (a) improving corporate governance of state-owned commercial banks, and (b) \n\n                                                 \n23 See Loan and Program Summary section, p. iii, in the Report and Recommendation of the President on the Private \n\nSector Development Program in Sri Lanka (Loans 1800 and 1801). November 2000. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17 \n\nrestructuring  the  state-owned  PBank.  The  Program,  in  the  longer  term,  will  enhance  the \navailability of financial alternatives, reduce overall financing costs, and make it easier to obtain \nfinancing. PBank will play a pivotal role in serving commercial, SMEs, and the retail sectors. As \nthe  primary  nationwide  bank  with  a  significant  presence  in  rural  areas,  PBank  will  be  able  to \nreach out to business enterprises and individuals in all areas of the country. To achieve these \nobjectives,  the  Program  will  address  the  constraints  and  issues  identified  in  Section  III  B  on \nIssues and Opportunities. \n \nThe  TA  loan  will  have  the  following  components:  (i)  capacity  building  and  skills \n78. \ndevelopment  for  PBank;  (ii)  strengthening  the  insurance  industry  through  capacity  building  of \nIBSL; (iii) support to create a national computerized movable property registry through capacity \nbuilding  and  provision  of  computer  equipment;  (iv)  provision  of  banking  expertise  to  SEMA  to \nimprove its ability to manage the banks in its portfolio; and (v) provision of legal and governance \nexpertise  for  corporate  securities,  financial  markets,  commercial  and  banking  law,  and  policy \nreforms. \n \nPolicy Framework and Actions \n \n79. \n \n\nThe Program entails five policy outcomes in two focus areas: \n\n1.  Components and Outputs \n\n \nFocus Area 1: Development of Financial Markets  \nPolicy outcome 1.a: Increased Financial Products and Services Available to the Capital Market \nPolicy outcome 1.b: Enhanced Corporate Governance in the Financial Market \nPolicy outcome 1.c: Improved Regulations of the Insurance Industry \n \nFocus Area 2: Operational Improvement of State-Owned Commercial Banks \nPolicy outcome 2.a: Improved Corporate Governance of State-owned Commercial Banks \nPolicy outcome 2.b: Restructuring and Recapitalization of People's Bank \n \nFocus Area 1: Development of Financial Markets \n\n80. \nThe  fundamental  objectives  of  developing  the  financial  markets  are  (i)  increased \nfinancial  products  and  services  available  to  the  capital  market,  (ii)  enhanced  corporate \ngovernance in the financial markets, and (iii) improved regulations of the insurance industry. \n \nPolicy  Outcome 1.a: Increased Financial Products and Services Available to the Capital \n\nMarket \n\n \nFinancing  Through  Secured  Transactions.  The  Program  will  support  the  legal  and \n81. \npolicy  reforms  to  modernize  Sri  Lanka's  secured24  transactions  system,  including  the \nestablishment of a computerized national system of registration for securing movable property \nincluding  machinery  and/or  equipment,  which  will  make  it  easier  for  businesses  to  obtain \nfinancing by providing movable assets as collateral for loans. It will also support establishment \nor  appointment  of  an  agency  responsible  for  movable  property  registration.  Introduction  of  a \n\n                                                 \n24 ADB  2001.  Technical  Assistance  to  Sri  Lanka  for  Enabling  SME  Growth  (TA  3822-SRI)  for  $1.2  million  included \nassistance for preparation of a Secured Transactions Bill. Because Parliament was dissolved in February 2004, the \nBill was never brought to the Cabinet. It is presently being reviewed by the Government. \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nSecured Transaction Bill and amendments to the Finance Companies Act into Parliament will be \nsupported by the Program. \n \n82. \nPublicly  Traded  Securitized  Bonds.  The  Program  will  focus  on  introducing  publicly \ntraded  securitized  bonds  in  the  capital  market.  A  Securitization  Bill  will  be  introduced  to \nParliament,  whereby  special  purpose  vehicles  (SPVs)  may  be  established  as  separate  legal \nentities to pool real or intangible assets against which public securities may be issued. The SEC \nwill  administer  and  provide  regulatory  supervision  of  SPVs.  Securitized  bonds  should  improve \nthe financial sources available for the home mortgage market and other markets and industries. \nPublicly  traded  securitized  bonds  should  reduce  interest  rates  for  borrowers,  lower  the  credit \nrisk for lenders and investors, increase liquidity in the bond market, and lengthen the yield curve \nfor  bonds.  The  long-term  effects  will  be  to  reduce  interest  rates  and  strengthen  the  financial \nsystem. \n \n83. \nImproved Asset Risk Management. The Program will also encourage the development \nof new products and services to improve the performance and reduce the risks associated with \nasset  management  through  encouraging  (i)  the  CBSL  to  introduce  directives  for  interest  rate \nswaps; and (ii) the Government to permit public trading of derivatives and futures. The Program \nwill also support the development of an equity clearing system cycle to improve the clearing of \nequity  securities  from  T+6  to  T+3.  The  SEC  will  initially  require  the  CSE  to  submit  a  plan  for \nimplementing  the  new  clearing  system,  and  the  SEC  will  ensure  the  operationalization  of  the \nsystem within 3 years. \n \n84. \nSovereign  Bonds.  The  Program  supports  the  creation  of  the  Public  Debt  Department \nwithin CBSL and the eventual creation of a Public Debt Office, which, through its establishment \nas  a  separate  authority  and  election  of  its  board  members,  will  become  independent  from \npolitical  or  economic  influence  from  the  CBSL  and  MOFP.  The  Public  Debt  Office  will  be \nresponsible for the management, issuance, and modalities of all public debt and guarantees. An \nindependent Public Debt Office issuing sovereign bonds through the price discovery method will \nimprove  the  method  of  debt  issuance  and  lead  to  development  of  a  market  yield  curve.  Such \nreforms would (i) encourage corporate issuers to raise capital through the public bond market; \n(ii) improve debt market liquidity; and (iii) improve investor confidence, thereby attracting foreign \ninvestors. \n \n85. \nHarmonizing Taxes. The Program will encourage the tax laws to be harmonized so that \nthe double taxation on money market mutual funds (withholding tax and tax on dividends) will be \neliminated. Harmonizing the taxation rules on money market mutual funds through amendments \nto  the  Revenue  Act  and  the  Companies  Act  (if  needed)  would  improve  the  market  liquidity  of \ndebt instruments. \n \nPolicy Outcome 1.b: Enhanced Corporate Governance in the Financial Markets \n\n86. \nEnhanced  authority  to  SEC  and  CBSL  as  regulators.  The  Program  supports  the \ndrafting of the Sri Lankan Corporate Governance Code. The SEC will become a more effective \nregulator by improving the reporting, regulations, and functional framework of the capital market \nby  issuing  a  directive  making  it  mandatory  for  listed  companies  to  follow  the  Sri  Lankan \nCorporate Governance Code. Additionally, CBSL shall be given the power to take action against \nfraudulent  financial  schemes  (e.g.  pyramid  schemes)  in  the  market  it  regulates.  To  reduce \npolitical  interference  in  capital  market  regulation,  the  SEC  commissioners  will  be  appointed  to \nreflect  diverse  public  and  private  interests  and  facilitate  an  independent  SEC.  Moreover,  an \nAnti-Money Laundering Bill will be drafted and submitted to Parliament for approval. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19 \n\nPolicy Outcome 1.c: Improved Regulations of the Insurance Industry \n \n87. \nIBSL and the Insurance Act. The IBSL will be made operational by appointing a board \nof directors, a majority of whose members are from the private sector. Additional staff need to \nbe hired to effectively implement, monitor, and supervise insurance companies. Also, to support \nincreasing  the  availability  of  long-term  capital  and  the  number  of  institutional  investors  in  the \nbond  market,  amendments  will  be  made  to  the  Regulation  of  Insurance  Industry  Act  that  will \npermit insurance companies to invest in securitized bonds. \n \nFocus Area 2: Operational Improvement of State-Owned Commercial Banks \n\nPolicy Outcome 2.a: Improved Corporate Governance of State-Owned Commercial Banks \n\n88. \nA bill will be introduced into Parliament, the SEMA Bill, to permit, among others things, \nBOC and PBank to make all business decisions without political interference or consideration, \nespecially  pertaining  to  the  recruitment,  transfer,  and  promotion  of  employees.  The  amended \nBOC Act and PBank Acts will provide commercial and political independence to the boards and \nmanagement  and  prevent  the  Government  from  intervening  in  the  day-to-day  affairs  of  these \ntwo banks, including their credit decisions and the interest rates they set on loans to SOEs. \n \nPolicy Outcome 2.b: Restructuring and Recapitalization of People's Bank \n\n89. \nDuring  the  past  3  years,  PBank\u2019s  management  has  significantly  improved  financial \nprofitability. With the bank in a much stronger financial position, the Government has decided to \nrecapitalize PBank (subject to certain prerequisites described below) for a maximum of SLRs8.5 \nbillion (approximately $82 million) in order to (i) improve PBank's financial viability and meet the \nCBSL\u2019s  minimum  regulatory  CAR  requirements  to  operate  as  a  bank;  (ii)  strengthen  the \ncountry's financial system by having PBank become a strong, competitive, and profitable bank \nthat  will  contribute  to  the  national  budget  and  become  a  source  of  capital  formation;  and  (iii) \npermit  PBank  to  continue  its  existing  business,  particularly  private  sector  and  SME  credit \nincluding  in  the  rural  areas  and  thereby  supporting  the  Government\u2019s  development  and \neconomic growth strategy. \n \n90. \nPrerequisites  for  the  Government  to  recapitalize  PBank  include  a  memorandum  of \nunderstanding  (MOU)  to  be  entered  into  between  (i)  the  Government  and  SEMA,  and  (ii)  the \nboard  of  directors  and  management  of  PBank.  In  the  MOU,  management  and  the  board  of \ndirectors  would  agree  to  the  restructuring  plan  according  to the  agreed  schedule  and  meeting \nthe  outlined  performance  targets.  After  appropriate  consultation  with  PBank  trade  unions  and \nthe  existing  staff  management  briefing  and  feedback  system,  by  30  September  2005,  PBank \nmust enter into a collective agreement (Collective Agreement) with the trade union representing \nmore than 85% of the permanent employees of PBank. In the Collective Agreement, the parties \nagree  to  implement  the  restructuring  plan  and  meet  the  performance  targets.  All  appropriate \nlabor rules and regulations will be adhered to. If the MOU and Collective Agreement are entered \ninto  and  if  the  performance  targets  are  met,  the  Government  agrees  to  recapitalize  PBank  to \nmeet  its  minimum  core  capital  ratio  requirements  in  accordance  with  the  phased-in \nrecapitalization plan for a maximum amount of SLRs8.5 billion.  \n \n91. \nAn oversight committee appointed by the Government will closely assess the progress in \nresolving some of PBank's major weaknesses, particularly human resource management, and \nwill  have  the  authority  to  make  corrections  to  the  restructuring  plan  as  needed.  As  part  of  the \nassessment,  an  independent  review  of  PBank  operations  will  be  performed  at  least  every  6 \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nmonths. Before the Government injects additional capital into PBank, an independent review of \noperations,  satisfactory  to  ADB,  will  be  conducted.  The  review  will  include  the  loan  books, \ncollateral  security,  pension  funds,  the  value  of  investments  in  subsidiaries  and  associate \ncompanies,  and  information  technology  to  ascertain  sustainability  as  a  result  of  the  phased-in \nrecapitalization. \n \n92. \nDue  to  PBank's  size,  customer  profile,  and  strength  of  its  labor  unions,  successful \nimplementation of restructuring to resolve PBank's problems would entail close monitoring and \noversight, and would need an estimated time  frame of three to five years. A discussion of the \nplans is presented below.  \n \n93. \nInjection  of  Capital  Based  on  Performance.  The  Government  agrees  to  provide  a \nmaximum  equity  investment  in  PBank  of  SLRs8.5  billion  (approximately  $82  million).  As \npresented  in  Table  2,  PBank  as  of  31  December  2004  is  forecasted  to  need  approximately \nSLRs8.5 billion to meet the minimum 10% core capital requirement. The Government agrees to \na phased equity investment in PBank to meet the minimum risk-weighted capital requirement of \n10%.  Based  upon  the  forecast  presented  in  Table  2,  PBank  will  meet  its  CAR  by  2007.  The \nGovernment's Letter of Comfort will be in place until the actual CAR is met and PBank no longer \nhas a capital deficit. \n \nTable 2: Forecasted People's Bank Risk Weighted Assets and Capital Funds Movement, 2004-2008 \n(SLRs million) \n \n\nItem \nRisk Weighted Assets (RWAs) \nCapital Required @ 10% of RWA \nTotal Capital in Hand of which: \n  Tier 1 \n  Tier 2 \nCapital Deficit/(Excess) \nCapital Funding \nRetained Profit2 \nGeneral Reserves \nRevaluation Reserves3 \nEquity Capital injections4 \nOther\u2014Paid-Up Ordinary Share and \n  Capital Pending Allotment \nOther \nTotal Capital in Hand \n\n20041 \n91,000 \n9,100 \n593 \n155 \n438 \n8,507 \n \n1,838 \n(2,935) \n438 \n- \n \n1,202 \n488 \n593 \n\n20051 \n93,000 \n9,300 \n4,033 \n3,595 \n438 \n5,267 \n \n1,440 \n(1,097) \n438 \n2,000 \n \n1,202 \n488 \n4,033 \n\n20061 \n95,000 \n9,500 \n8,617 \n6,179 \n2,438 \n883 \n \n1,583 \n344 \n2,438 \n3,000 \n \n1,202 \n2,488 \n8,617 \n\n20071 \n98,000 \n9,800 \n12,659 \n10,221 \n2,438 \n(2,859) \n \n2,041 \n1,928 \n2,438 \n5,000 \n \n1,202 \n2,488 \n12,659 \n\nNote: The actual amount and time period of the invested phased-in recapitalization can vary from \nthe forecasted amounts indicated in the table. \n1 All numbers are estimates. \n2 Assumes dividend is paid. \n3 According to CSBL principals, a bank can revaluate its fixed assets every 7 years, but only if it meets tier \n1 capital requirements. \n4 Phased-in recapitalization  will only be made to meet PBank\u2019s minimum core capital  requirements. The \nforecasted phased-in recapitalization is based upon the forecasted risk  weighted assets requirement of \n10% as follows: SLRs2,000 million in 2005; SLRs1,000 million in 2006; and SLRs2,000 million in 2007. \n\nSource: People's Bank. \n\n \n94. \nAs  outlined  in  Table  3,  certain  financial  performance  targets  must  be  met  on  a  yearly \nbasis in order for the Government to invest the phased-in recapitalization to meet the minimum \ncore  capital  requirements.

Because  employees  are  promoted  based  on  tenure  rather  than \nskills  or  merit,  and  because  of  strict  labor  rules  regarding  involuntary  retrenchment,  PBank \nsuffers  from  overstaffing,  ageing  employees  with  low  skill  levels,  and  a  poor  working  culture. \nPBank  also  has  an  unviable  branch  distribution  network  with  some  branches  not  generating \nsufficient  loan  volume  to  make  a  profit.  PBank  has  an  unacceptably  high  operational  cost \nstructure with the cost/income ratio in excess of 70%. The increase in investment in technology \ncould  further  increase  the  cost  ratio  in  2004.  More  than  one-third  of  the  staff  is  engaged  in \nadministrative,  back-office,  and  non-core  functions.  The  age  profile  of  the  staff  is  unfavorable, \nwith  more  than  60%  above  45  years.  More  than  2,400  employees  will  be  leaving  the  bank \nthrough retirement and/or natural attrition during the next several years. Under the restructuring \nplan, there is no VRS to retrench nonessential employees. In order to adjust for overall staffing, \nas  well  as  being  able  to  grow  and  have  the  proper  skills  for  the  bank  on  a  longer-term  basis, \nPBank has been and will continue to recruit one young graduate for every two retirees. Because \nyoung graduates require lower salaries and because the total number of jobs at PBank will have \nbeen reduced by 2008, net saving in payroll costs are estimated to be $15 million per year. \n \n96. \nThe  restructuring  plan  includes  reorganizing  the  bank  into  three  divisions:  commercial, \nsavings,  and  microfinance/pawning.  Unprofitable  branches  will  be  converted  to  savings  and \npawning centers if the costs of having a full operational bank cannot be justified. If there were \nno banking facilities available in a town or  village, instead of closing down unviable branches, \nsuch branches would offer limited banking services. \n \n97. \nThe  commercial  bank  loan  division  will  be  comprised  of  loans  to  industrial  clients, \nprimarily  SMEs,  exporters,  and  middle-income  retail  clients.  Approximately  50  branches  will \noffer a full range of services and will be responsible for increasing the lending portfolio, which as \na  result  of  its  cheap  funding  deposit  base  should  enhance  future  profitability.  Simple  low-risk \nretail loan products such as residential mortgage loans, vehicle loans, and educational loans will \nbe offered, and appropriate risk grading and collection will be introduced. PBank plans to reduce \nits  high-risk  loan  exposure  to  SOEs,  from  the  present  level  of  24%  of  total  advances  net  of \nprovisions  as  at  30  September  200425  to  20%  of  the  total  loan  portfolio  by  2006.  To  improve \nefficiency  and  profitability,  PBank  will  focus  on  middle-market  corporate  accounts  (enterprises \nthat  could  absorb  a  loan  size  of  at  least  $50,000).  The  bank  is  also  adopting  aggressive  exit \nstrategies for identified weak customer loans.  \n\n                                                 \n25  People\u2019s  Bank\u2019s  exposure  to  SOEs  was  26%  of  total  advances  net  of  provisions  as  at  31  December  2003.  The \nexposure increased to 27% in the first quarter of 2004 but subsequently declined, and in the third quarter of 2004, \nits present exposure is 24% of total advances, net of provisions. \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\nThe savings bank division, which will have branches in urban as well as rural areas, will \n98. \nfocus on savings mobilization. A $10 million information technology upgrade is anticipated to be \ncompleted  by  the  end  of  2004  or  early  2005,  after  which,  PBank  will  offer  straight-through \nremittance capabilities (i.e. deposits and/or withdrawals for Sri Lankans living abroad) and other \nservices will be introduced to attract the middle-market expatriate customer, thereby improving \nthe bank's foreign currency deposit base. \n \n99. \nPBank  is  a  market  leader  in  the  pawn  broking  business,  and  the  portfolio  has  grown \nconsistently  every  year  with  an  exposure  of  SLRs23  billion  as  at  year  end  December  2003. \nPBank  will  extend  microlending \nto  all  viable  branches  nationwide.  To  make \nmicrofinance/pawning more profitable, the bank will use outsourcing wherever possible. \n\n \n\n100.  To improve performance of the recapitalized bank, a new management structure will be \nintroduced, consisting of a five-person team that is directly accountable for the implementation \nof  the  restructuring  plan.  A  board-level  risk  management  committee  has  recently  been \nappointed to oversee measures to further reduce business risks. \n \nC. \n\nImportant Features \n\n101.  Restructuring  and  Recapitalization  of  People\u2019s  Bank.  The  Program  supports  the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts to strengthen the banking system by further restructuring PBank, based on \nan  agreed  time  schedule  to  meet  certain  performance  and  profitability  targets.  PBank  will  be \nrecapitalized in phases according to the recapitalization plan to meet the minimum core capital \nratios to maintain its banking license. \n \n102.  Development  of  Financial  Markets.  The  Program  supports  the  development  of  the \nfinancial markets, one of the key constraints to economic growth, including SME development. \nThe  Program  improves  the  efficiency  of  the  financial  markets,  increases  availability  of \nalternative  financial  sources  of  funding  to  the  private  sector,  and  improves  corporate \ngovernance. \n \nD. \n\nFinancing Plan  \n\n103.  The program loan will finance the cost of adjustment arising from the proposed reforms, \nwhose total is estimated to be $90 million. The expected costs of the proposed reforms are: \n \n\nrecapitalizing PBank ($82 million); \n\ndrafting,  gazetting,  and  introducing  Acts  to  Parliament  under  the  policy  reform \nprogram  and  the  administrative  costs  for  SEMA  to  manage  PBank  ($3  million); \nand \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nestablishing and operationalizing the Public Debt Office ($5 million). \n\n \n104.  The  proposed  Program  comprises  (i)  a  policy  loan,  and  (ii)  a  TA  loan,  totaling  $65 \nmillion. \n \n105.  The  Policy  Loan.  The  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $60,000,000  will  be \nprovided to Sri Lanka from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the Program. The \nloan  will  have  a  15-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  an  interest  rate  to  be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \n\n\f \n\n \n\n23 \n\nfacility,  and  a  commitment  charge  for  the  undisbursed  balance  of  0.75%  per  annum.  (A  front-\nend fee of 1% will be waived for loans approved before 30 June 2005). The loan will support a \nprogram of reforms and will be released in three equal tranches of $20 million each and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreements. The Government has provided \nADB with (i) reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the \nbasis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n106.  The Technical Assistance Loan. The TA loan of SDR3,318,000, will be provided to Sri \nLanka  and  financed  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources.  This  loan  will  have  a  term  of  32 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nProgram Period \n\n1. \n \nImplementation is expected to last 3 years and is scheduled for completion in December \n\n107. \n2007. The program implementation schedule is included in Appendix 5. \n \n\n2. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement  \n\n \n108.  The Policy Loan. In accordance with provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement \nProcedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans, the proceeds of the policy loan will \nbe disbursed to the Government as the Borrower. The proceeds of the policy loan will be utilized \nto finance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding local duties and taxes) of imports produced \nin and procured from ADB\u2019s member countries, other than those specified in the list of ineligible \nitems  (Appendix  6)  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  All \nprocurement  will  be  through  normal  commercial  practices  in  the  case  of  procurement  by  the \nprivate sector, or prescribed procedures acceptable to ADB in the case of procurement by the \npublic sector, having due regard to the principles of economy and efficiency. The Government \nwill certify that (i) the value of the country\u2019s eligible imports is equal to or exceeds the amounts \nof ADB\u2019s projected disbursements under the policy loan in a given period; and (ii) the policy loan \nproceeds will be accurately utilized in a manner satisfactory to ADB. The policy loan proceeds \nwill be disbursed on the basis of the certification provided by the Government, which confirms \nthat the above requirements for the policy loan have been met. ADB will have the right to audit \nthe  use  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  Government\u2019s  certification.  All \nprocurement  under  the  loan  will  be  undertaken  through  normal  commercial  practices  for  the \nprivate sector or the Government\u2019s prescribed procurement procedures acceptable to ADB, with \ndue consideration to economy and efficiency. The list of ineligible items is in Appendix 6. \n \n109.  The  TA  loan.  Procurement  of  goods  and  services  will  be  subject  to  the  provisions  of \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Office  equipment  and  computers  will  be  procured  through \ninternational  competitive  bidding  for  packages  exceeding  $500,000  equivalent,  and  through \ninternational  shopping  procedures  for  packages  between  $100,000  and  $500,000  equivalent. \nFor packages below $100,000 equivalent, direct purchase may be used. \n \n110.  Consultants under the TA loan will be recruited as individuals in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the \nengagement of domestic consultants.  \n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\n3. \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n111.  Counterpart  funds  will  be  used  to  meet  program  expenditures  and  associated  costs  of \nreform. \n \n\n4. \n\nMonitoring and Tranching  \n\n112.  The  proceeds  of the  policy  loan  will  be  available  for  withdrawal in three tranches upon \nsatisfactory compliance with agreed policy actions as outlined in the Policy Matrix in Appendix 3. \nFirst  tranche  will  be  released  upon  loan  effectiveness;  the  subsequent  two  tranches  will  be \nreleased  during  the  Program  period  of  3  years,  tentatively  envisaged  18  and  36  months  after \nloan  effectiveness,  respectively.  ADB  and  the  Government  would  review  the  progress  of \nimplementation  of  specified  policy  actions  set  out  in  the  policy  matrix  through  periodic  review \nmissions. A comprehensive mid-term review will be undertaken before the scheduled release of \nthe second tranche.  \n \n\n5. \n\nProgram Management \n\n113.  MOFP  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Program  and  the  CBSL,  IBSL,  PBank,  the \nLand  Commissioner\u2019s  Department,  and  SEMA  will  be  the  Implementing  Agencies.  A  steering \ncommittee  will  be  formed  chaired by  the  Secretary,  MOFP,  to  coordinate  policy  decisions  that \nmay  need  to  be  taken  to  pursue  reforms  under  the  Program.  The  committee,  which  will  meet \nregularly  and  as  needed,  is  made  up  of  key  officials  from  concerned  ministries  and  agencies. \nThe  steering  committee  may  also  call  upon  affected  sectors  for  consultations  on  important \nissues  that  will  have  a  bearing  on  the  Program,  such  as  the  labor  unions,  employers\u2019 \nfederations, nongovernment organizations, academics, PBank, and the CSE.  \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting  \n\n114.  An  audit  of  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds  of  the  policy  loan  will  be  undertaken  if \nrequested  by  ADB.  ADB  retains  the  right  to  audit  any  account  and  verify  the  validity  of  the \ncertification issued by the Government for each withdrawal application. Prior to withdrawal, the \nGovernment  will  open  a  deposit  account  at  CBSL  to  receive  loan  proceeds.  Accounting, \nauditing, and reporting procedures for the TA loan are contained in Appendix 7. \n \n\n7. \n\nProgram Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n\n115.  MOFP will establish a program performance management system (PPMS) as agreed on \nwith ADB, and cause it to be operated throughout Program implementation. Under the PPMS, \nMOFP  will  periodically  review  the  Program  for  evaluation  of  the  scope,  implementation \narrangements, benefit monitoring, progress, and achievements. Quarterly PPMS reports in line \nwith  ADB's  PPMS  Guidelines  will  be  submitted  to  the  coordination  committee  of  the  Program, \nmade available to ADB and published. Not later than 3 months after program completion, MOFP \nwill provide ADB with a report, including an assessment of overall program performance. \n \n \n \n \n MOFP and ADB will undertake a comprehensive midterm review of the Program in the \n116. \nsecond  quarter  of  2006.  The  midterm  review  will  (i)  review  the  Program  scope,  design,  and \nimplementation  arrangements;  (ii)  assess  implementation  performance  against  Program \n\nProgram Review \n\n8. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n25 \n\nperformance  indicators  and  objectives;  (iii)  review  and  establish  compliance  with  legal \ncovenants;  and  (iv)  identify  problems  and  constraints.  If  the  midterm  review  determines  that \nchanges  are  required  in  program  implementation,  MOFP  and  ADB  will  agree  on  measures, \nincluding changes in implementation arrangements, to ensure that program obligations are met. \nMOFP and ADB will carry out a final review at the conclusion of the Program.  \n \n\nV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \n\n117.  The $5 million equivalent TA loan will provide (i) capacity building and skills development \nfor  PBank,  (ii)  strengthening  the  insurance  industry  through  capacity  building  of  IBSL,  (iii) \ncreating  a  national  computerized  movable  property  registry  and  provision  of  computer \nequipment, (iv) banking expertise to SEMA to improve its ability to manage the four banks in its \nportfolio and funds to perform an independent review of operations of PBank on a semi-annual \nbasis,  and  (v)  provide  the  necessary  domestic  and/or  international  skills  to  draft  appropriate \nregulations  and  legislation  for  the  Program.  Further  details  of  the  TA  loan  are  contained  in \nAppendix 7. \n \nA. \n \n118.  TA in the form of capacity building and skills development will be provided to PBank for \n(i)  improving  and  strengthening  the  bank's  credit  and  financial  risk  management  system,  (ii) \nassisting in its further development and implementation of PBank's SME business strategy, (iii) \nimproving customer service and supervision, (iv) improving human resources management, and \n(v) training for middle and upper management. \n \nB. \n\nCapacity Building for Strengthening the Insurance Industry  \n\nCapacity Building and Skills Development for PBank \n\n119.  A  component  of  the  TA  loan  will  provide  support  to  strengthen  IBSL\u2019s  regulation, \nsupervision,  and  monitoring  of  the  insurance  industry  through  the  engagement  of  an \ninternational  actuary  for  24  months.  The  actuary  will  also  be  responsible  for  developing  and \nimplementing  capacity  building/skills  development  within  IBSL,  and  for  suggesting  changes  to \nIBSL\u2019s rules and regulations in order to meet international insurance regulatory standards, and \ncreate a more financially viable industry. \n \nC. \n\nCreating a National Electronic Movable Property Registry \n\n120.  To increase the availability of secured financing alternatives, a component of the TA loan \nwill  support  the  development  and  operationalization  of  a  national  electronic  movable  property \nregistry  that  will  codify  and  register  all  movable  equipment.  The  TA  loan  will  also  fund  the \nnecessary equipment and software to operate the system. \n \nD. \n\nBanking Expertise to SEMA  \n\n121.  The  TA  loan  will  provide  an  international  banking  expert  to  work  for  SEMA  to  manage \nthe restructuring plans of the four banks in the SEMA portfolio. The international banking expert \nwill also be responsible for making suggestions to SEMA on the strategy of its banking portfolio \nto improve profitability and increase asset value on a long-term basis. Additionally, the banking \nexpert  will  be  responsible  for  obtaining  the  independent  review  of  PBank\u2019s  operations  on  a \nsemi-annual basis. \n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\nE. \n\nLegal and Governance Expertise \n\nCost and Financing \n\n122.  The  TA  loan  will  provide  legal  and governance  expertise  consultants, as  necessary,  to \nassist  the  Government  or  any  Implementing  Agency,  as  appropriate,  for  financial  markets, \ncommercial and banking law, and policy reform. \n \nF. \n \n123.  Financing  Plan.  ADB  will  provide  a  TA  loan  of  SDR3,318,000  from  its  Special  Funds \nresources  for  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  an  interest  rate  of \n1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The TA loan closing \ndate  is  expected  to  be  31  December  2007.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  loan  is  estimated  to  be \n$6,000,000  equivalent,  comprising  $4,527,240  in  foreign  exchange  costs  and  $1,472,760 \nequivalent in local currency costs. ADB will finance $5,000,000 equivalent, comprising the entire \nforeign  exchange  cost  and  $472,760  equivalent  in  local  currency.  The  Government  will \ncontribute  $1,000,000  equivalent  to  fund  counterpart  staff,  office  facilities,  administrative \nservices  and  any  taxes  and  duties  on  computer  equipment.  The  terms  of  reference  of  the  TA \nare in Appendix 7. \n \nG. \n \n124.  MOFP will be the executing agency of the TA. The MOFP will establish a coordination \ncommittee  headed  by  the  Secretary  of  Treasury  and  consisting  of  representatives  from  the \nimplementing  agencies:  IBSL,  the  Land  Commissioner\u2019s  Department,  MOFP,  PBank,  and \nSEMA. The committee will initially meet within 3 months of loan effectiveness, and as needed, \nbut at least once every 6 months and will be responsible for the overall guidance, coordination, \nand  direction  of  the  TA,  will  review  and  approve  the  recruitment  of  consulting  services  and \nprocurement of equipment under the TA, and will prepare, review, and approve the TA reports. \nThe day-to-day decisions will be the responsibility of the respective implementing agency. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nVI. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n \nA. \n\nProgram Benefits  \n\n125.  There  is  broad  consensus  that  the  future  development  of  Sri  Lanka  hinges  on  a \npermanent peaceful resolution of the civil conflict, and maintaining high economic growth. Only \nthrough  higher  and  sustained  growth  can  the  country  create  jobs,  raise  standards  of  living, \nmaintain high levels of human development, and reduce poverty. \n \n126.  The Program, which supports private sector development, will assist the Government in \nmeeting its development objectives. It will help facilitate access by the private sector, including \nSMEs,  to  domestic  sources  of  financing  and  capital.  It  will  also  support  the  development  of  a \nsound,  more  competitive,  banking  system  through  the  restructuring  and  recapitalization  of \nPBank.  Mortgage  financing  will  become  more  readily  available  which  will  improve  the  quality \nand cost of housing throughout the country. \n \n127.  PBank  will  provide  better  financial  products  and  services  that  specifically  address  the \nSME market, especially in rural areas. An expanding SME sector will stimulate demand for labor \nand lead to the shifting of workers from agriculture and non-wage employment to jobs of higher \nproductivity and higher wages in industry and services. This growth in overall employment and \nthe intersectoral shifting of workers will reduce poverty. Income and employment generation will \n\n\f \n\n \n\n27 \n\nincrease. New jobs will reduce disguised unemployment and underemployment among the less \neducated  low-income  people,  thus  helping  reduce  the  extent  of  poverty.  Since  women \ntraditionally  account  for  nearly  half  of  workers  in  the  SME  sector,  the  Program  should  have  a \nfavorable impact on the employment and income of women. \n  \nEnvironmental and Social Impacts  \n\n128.  The  Program  is  classified  under  category  C  of  ADB\u2019s  environmental  classification \nsystem.  There  is  no  investment  project  included  in  the  Program  and  no  direct  environmental \nimpact is expected. The Program is not expected to generate adverse social impacts requiring \ncorresponding  mitigating  measures.  The  matrix  of  potential  environment  impact  on  policy \nactions is in Appendix 8. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 9. \n \nRisks \n\n129. \n Political Risk. The present cease-fire is in effect after a 20-year civil war, and although \nthe  Government  has  a  clear  intent to  seek  a  peaceful  resolution  of  the  conflict,  no  permanent \nsolution has yet been reached. Delay of the progress in the peace process could potentially (i) \nweaken  private  sector  development  and  SME  growth;  (ii)  hinder  the  development  of  financial \nmarkets,  including  attracting  the  needed  investment  capital  to  rebuild  and/or  modernize  the \ninfrastructure of the country; and (iii) undermine the political will to introduce and implement the \nnecessary policy reforms.  \n \n130. \nImplementation  Risk.  Implementation  of  reform  may  be  delayed  because  of  a  lack  of \ncapacity and/or skills. The Government has established theme cluster groups, focusing on the \npolicies and their implementation, and capacity building through the TA loan is an integral part \nof the Program. \n \n131.  The  law  and  policy  reform  components  of  the  Program  involve  various  bills,  and/or \namendments to existing acts pertaining to financial and commercial reforms to be approved by \nthe  Cabinet  and  introduced  in  Parliament.  This  includes  the  SEMA  Act  which  is  a  key \ncomponent of the Program. However, there are political risks that such bills and/or amendments \nmay  not  be  enacted  by  Parliament  despite  the  Government\u2019s  strong  commitment,  and  if \nenacted, may not be implemented. \n \n132.  The risk in recapitalizing PBank is whether management will be successful in meeting or \nexceeding  the  performance  targets  in  the  restructuring  plan,  including  the  repayment  of  the \ncapital  injected  by  the  Government.  The  bank  must  also  generate  sufficient  income  to  meet \ncapital adequacy requirements in line with the projected growth in assets.  \n \n133.  Restructuring of PBank has substantial labor and human relations issues. Labor unions \nin  Sri  Lanka  are  active  and  their  acceptance  of  the  restructuring  plan  will  be  key  to  effective \nimplementation under the Program. PBank is required to enter into an agreement with the union \nrepresenting  85%  of  the  employees  by  30  September  2005.  There  is  a  risk  that  this  may  not \noccur. \n \n134.  Macroeconomic  Risk.  Despite  generally  sound  economic  developments,  the  fiscal \ndeficit has begun to widen in 2004 reflecting inter alia some weakening in revenue performance, \nincreased  government  spending,  a  prolonged  drought  and  petroleum  price  subsidies,  which \nhave  been  exacerbated  due  to  oil  prices  remaining  at  an  all-time  high.  The  new  Government \nhas yet to start negotiation on a new Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) as some \n\n\f28 \n\n \n\nperformance  criteria  and  structural  conditions  under  the  now  suspended  PRGF  were  not  met. \nHowever,  following  political  developments,  including  the  dissolution  of  Parliament  in  February \n2004  and  the  general  election  of  April  2004,  the  new  Government  is  firming  up  key \nmacroeconomic  policies  and  is  in  discussions  with  IMF  on  the  resumption  of  PRGF.  Looking \nforward,  the  PRGF  is  not  likely  to  be  renewed  before  early  2005  following  the  finalization  of \nactual results from the 2004 budget and supporting economic policy framework action plans. \n \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n135.

The PSDP contained indicative \nareas  for  further  support  under  subprogram  II  of  PSDP,  subject  to  revision  following  a \nreassessment  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  of  the  macroeconomic  environment, \nlessons  learned  in  subprogram  I,  and  the  status  of  implementation  and  readiness  of  the \nGovernment  to  undertake  the  proposed  policy  reform  actions.  As  discussed  in  the  section  on \nlessons learned in the main text, the Financial Markets Program for Private Sector Development \n(formerly PSDP subprogram II) focuses on two areas supported by PSDP: (i) increasing private \nsector  access  to  finance  by  developing  the  financial  markets,  and  (ii)  supporting  the \nGovernment\u2019s public enterprise reform program through the restructuring and recapitalization of \nPeople\u2019s Bank. A comparison of the indicative areas in PSDP subprogram II, and classifications \nof the focus of the proposed Program are presented below. \n\n \nTable A1: Comparison Between Indicative Areas in PSDP Subprogram II (2000)  \nand the Focus of the Proposed Program \n\n \n\nIndicative Areas for Subprogram II in PSDP (2000) \n(i)  PERC submits to ADB plans for voluntary retirement \n\nof workers for each public enterprise to be divested \nby the Government based on the ongoing PERC \nprogram. \n\n(ii)  Legislation is placed before Parliament to establish \nregulatory authorities for water supply, power, and \nport sectors. \n\nfor \n\nfunding \n\nits  voluntary \n\nFocus of Proposed Program \nVoluntary  retirement  schemes  of  the  12  Strategic \nEnterprises  managed  by  SEMA  will  be  approved  by \nthe  Cabinet.

TA being funded by the World Bank is \nreviewing ongoing unemployment issues, including \npossible unemployment insurance and social security \nbenefits. \n\nBOC has met all of the necessary capital adequacy \nrequirements and, as a result, did not have to be \nrecapitalized. As of June 2004, the capital adequacy \nratio was 12% while regulations require a minimum \ncapital adequacy ratio of 10%. \n \nUnder the Program, new BOC and PBank Ordinance \nActs will be introduced, whereby the Government will \nnot be permitted to intervene in the day-to-day \nmanagement of these two banks, including making \ncredit decisions on state-owned enterprises. In order \nto maintain a sound banking system, PBank is being \nfurther restructured under an agreed upon \nrestructuring plan. Achievement of performance \ntargets will be met under an agreed schedule. \nRecapitalization will be followed in accordance with \nthe phased-in recapitalization plan. \n \nThe Government's policy is not to privatize Strategic \nEnterprises. BOC and PBank are classified as \nStrategic Enterprises. However, BOC and PBank \ncould sell non-core businesses. \n \n\nTA to develop an insurance scheme to protect small \ndepositors is being provided by the International \nMonetary Fund. \n \nSince the insurance scheme to protect small \ndepositors will not be implemented until the release of \nthe third and final tranche of the proposed Program, it \nis not prudent to remove Government guarantees on \ndeposits before such insurance is in place. \n \n \n\nContinued on next page \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n33\n\nFocus of Proposed Program \n\nThe private pension and provident funds are being \nreviewed by the World Bank.

(b) simultaneously \nimplementing  performance  targets  according  to  the  agreed  schedule  to  improve  its  efficiency \nand profitability; and (c) recapitalizing the bank in accordance with the phased-in recapitalization \nplan. The Program will be implemented from 2005 to 2007. It consists of two loans: (a) a policy \nloan, amounting to $60 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR) and (b) a technical \nassistance (TA) loan, amounting to $5 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. \n \nB.  \n \n2. \nThe TA Loan\u2019s objective is to provide technical assistance to support the Program. The \nprincipal objective of the Program is to facilitate private sector development by strengthening the \nfinancial  markets,  including  the  restructuring  and  phased  recapitalization  of  People\u2019s  Bank \n(PBank).  The  scope  includes  (i)  development  of  financial  markets  through  (a)  increasing  the \navailability  of  financial  products  and  services  to  the  financial  market;  (b)  enhancing  corporate \ngovernance  in  the  financial  market;  (c)  improving  insurance  industry  regulation;  and  (ii) \nstrengthening the banking system through (a) improving corporate governance of state-owned \ncommercial banks, and (b) restructuring the state-owned PBank. \n \n3. \nIn this context, the Program will support the development of financial markets, one of the \nkey constraints of economic growth for the private sector and SMEs. PBank will play a pivotal \nrole in servicing SMEs. As a nationwide bank, it will be able to reach out to businesses as well \nas to the retail population in all areas of the country.  \n \nThe  TA  loan  will:  (i)  provide  capacity  building  and  skills  development  for  PBank;  (ii) \n4. \nstrengthen the insurance industry through capacity building at the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka \n(IBSL);  (iii)  support  creation  of  a  national  computerized  registry  for  codifying,  operating  and \nmaintaining  movable  property  to  be  used  for  secured  transaction  financing;  (iv)  strengthen \nbanking  expertise  at  the  Strategic  Enterprise  Management  Agency  (SEMA)  to  improve  its \nmanagement  of  the  four  banks  in  its  portfolio; and  (v)  develop  the  necessary  domestic  and/or \ninternational skills to draft appropriate regulations and legislation for the Program. \n \n\n1. \n\nTA Support \n\nFive  areas  of  TA  support  will  be  provided  to  develop  the  financial  markets  and  private \n\n \n5. \nsector. \n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n57 \n\nCapacity Building/Skills Development for PBank.

A  component  of  the  TA  loan  will  provide \nsupport to strengthen the IBSL regulation, supervision and monitoring of the insurance industry \nthrough  the  engagement  of  an  international  actuary  for  24  months.  The  rules  and  financial \nregulatory  requirements  of  the  IBSL  will  be  changed,  as  necessary,  in  order  to  meet \ninternational  best  practice  regulatory  standards,  thereby  creating  a  more  financially  viable \ninsurance industry. \n \n8. \nNational  Electronic  Movable  Property  Registry.  To  increase  the  availability  of \nsecured  financing  alternatives,  a  component  of  the  TA  loan  will  support  the  development  and \nthe  Land \noperationalization  of  a  national  electronic  movable  property \nCommissioner\u2019s  Department  that  will  codify  and  register  all  movable  equipment.  The  TA  loan \nwill also fund the equipment to operate the system.  \n\nregistry  by \n\n \n\nCost and Financing  \n\nInternational  Banking  Expertise  for  SEMA.  The  TA  loan  will  provide  an  international \n9. \nbanking expert to work for SEMA and interact with various governmental officials to manage the \nfour  banks  (Bank  of  Ceylon,  National  Savings  Bank,  PBank,  and  State  Mortgage  and \nInvestment Bank) in the SEMA portfolio The TA will also fund an independent review of PBank \non a semi-annual basis. The banking expert will be responsible for organizing the independent \nreview of PBank. \n \n10. \nLegal  and  Governance  Expertise.  Since  there  are  significant  policy  reforms  to  be \nimplemented,  a  portion  of  the  TA  loan  will  be  used  for  legal  and  governance  expertise,  as \nneeded, for financial markets, commercial and banking law, and policy reform. \n \nC. \n \n11. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  TA  Loan  is  estimated  to  be  $6,000,000  equivalent,  comprising \n$4,527,240 in foreign exchange costs and $1,472,760 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB \nwill  finance  $5,000,000  equivalent,  comprising  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $472,760 \nequivalent  in  local  currency.  The  Government  will  finance  $1,000,000  of  the  local  currency \ncosts,  primarily  in  kind.  Counterpart  support  will  include  the  provision  of  facilities  for  the \nconsulting  team,  as  well  as  any  taxes  and  duties  on  equipment.  Table  A7.1  contains  the \ndetailed cost estimates and the financing plan. \n \nD. \n \n \n \n12. \nThe  Executing  Agency  (EA)  of  the  TA  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Planning \n(MOFP).  The  MOFP  will  establish  a  co-ordination  committee  headed  by  the  Secretary  of  the \nTreasury  composed  of  representatives  from  the  implementing  agencies:  IBSL,  the  Land \nCommissioner\u2019s Department, MOFP, PBank, and SEMA. The committee will have the authority \nto make decisions that are essential to ensure the progress of the TA. The committee will meet \nas needed, but at least once every six months and will be responsible for the overall guidance \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nThe Executing Agency \n\n1.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n58\n\nAppendix 7 \n\n2. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\nand  direction  of  the  TA,  coordinate  the  TA,  review  and  approve  the  recruitment  of  consulting \nservices and procurement of equipment under the TA, and will prepare, review and approve the \nTA reports.

Consultants will be \nindividually recruited under the TA loan. All consultants will be financed from the TA loan, and \nwill be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The \noutline terms of reference for the consultants are below.  \n \n15. \nIT  Hardware  and  Software.  Computer  hardware  and  software  to  support  the \ndevelopment  and  maintenance  of  the  database  for  the  national  electronic  movable  property \nregistry  will  be  procured  for  approximately  $130,000,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement.  If  any  packages  above  $500,000  equivalent  arise,  international  competitive \nbidding  must  be  followed.  For  packages  between  $100,000  and  $500,000  equivalent \ninternational  shopping  procedures  may  be  followed,  and  for  packages  below  $100,000 \nequivalent, direct purchase procedures may be used.  \n \n \n \nSeparate accounts need to be maintained by each Implementing Agency for the project, \n16. \nand these must be audited on an annual basis. The audit report will be due within 6 months of \nclose of the fiscal year to which the accounts refer.  \n \n \n \n17. \nProject  reports  will  be  provided  semiannually  by  the  co-ordination  committee.

REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\n \nA. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Sri Lanka: \nThe Financial Markets Program for Private Sector Development is designed to reinforce the achievement of the PSDP \nsubprogram I by providing further support to (i) increase private sector access to finance through development of the \nfinancial markets; and (ii) restructure and recapitalize People\u2019s Bank, a national bank with a strong presence in rural \nand  poor  areas  of  the  country.  It  is  expected  that  the  outcomes  of  effective  financial  services  and  products  and \nprudent corporate governance in the capital market, and market-friendly investment environment will reduce the cost \nof financing, provide additional financial alternatives to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), increase private \nsector  investment,  employment  generation,  and  provide  knowledge  and  expertise  in  all  sectors.  Furthermore,  by \nrestructuring  People\u2019s  Bank  and  reducing  its  economic  burden  on  the  national  budget,  positive  implications  on \neconomic productivity, employment generation, fiscal management, and GDP growth will result in the long run.   \nAs the Program focuses on developing financial markets and strengthening the banking and insurance industries, the \nprivate  sector-led  pro-poor  economic  growth  would  provide  better  access  to  credit,  savings  and  insurance  products, \nthereby, reducing the vulnerability of the poor.     \n\n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                          Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n \n\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nThe Program is indirectly pro-poor in supporting the three components of ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy: pro-poor \nsustainable economic growth, good governance, and social development.  Pro-poor sustainable economic growth is to \nbe achieved through the Program\u2019s focus on measures to improve the financial soundness of the banking system and \ncapital market, strengthen investor confidence and increase private sector investment. This, in turn, will attract more \ninvestment  capital  for  much  needed  infrastructure  in  the  rural  area,  provide  employment,  and  raise  income  for  the \npoor. To support good governance, the Program focuses on strengthening the regulating authorities and regulations in \nthe  capital  markets  and  banking  system.  It  will  therefore  improve  transparency  through  required  information \ndisclosure,  effectiveness  of  regulation  and  enforcement,  and,  ultimately,  sustainable  economic  development.  The \nProgram  also  supports  reforms  for  business  regulation,  strengthening  property  rights,  and  removing  obstacles  for \ndoing  business.  Through  such  reforms,  establishment  of  new  businesses  will  be  encouraged,  jobs  will  be  created, \nbusinesses  will  be  encouraged  to  move  into  the  formal  economy,  and  more  investment  capital  will  be  available  to \nstimulate economic growth. In addition, the Program supports better fiscal management and eventual reduction in the \ndebt  burden  of  the  country  by  restructuring  and  recapitalizing  People\u2019s  Bank.  To  support  the  poverty  reduction \nstrategy\u2019s  third  pillar  of  social  development,  the  Program  supports  reforms  in  social  protection  programs  such  as \nreductions in the number of employees through natural attrition or retirement, which will provide long-term additional \noptional  protection  to  the  vulnerable  poor.  Additionally,  through  the  development  of  new  financial  products,  it  will  be \neasier  to  obtain  less  expensive  mortgage  financing,  which  will  result  in  more  people  being  able  to  afford  proper \nhousing and will have a sustainable effect on overall poverty reduction. \n\n \nC.  Participation Process \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nPeriodic stakeholder consultation has been conducted throughout the Program formulation, but did not require specific \nstakeholder analysis, as direct impacts on specific stakeholder groups are limited. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \nDuring preparation of the Program, the Mission consulted with all relevant stakeholders to structure representative and \nbroad strategy for participation by the general population for the private sector, including SMEs, and financial market \ndevelopment. In addition, People's Bank, with a strong presence in rural areas, will be recapitalized and restructured \nto better serve the rural poor. \n \n \n \n \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nBy increasing the availability of SME financing (i.e., through strengthening of People\u2019s Bank), particularly in the rural \narea,  women,  who primarily  work for no  wages as household help,  would be given the opportunity to establish their \nown business. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\nE.
