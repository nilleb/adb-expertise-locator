and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup  to  $93,750,000  to  Olam  International  Limited  (OIL)  and  to  Olam  Treasury  Private  Limited \n(OTPL) in United States dollars for the Olam COVID-19 Smallholder Farmer Livelihood Support \nProject in Viet Nam, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea (PNG).1 \n \n2. \nThe project will support smallholder farmers from whom OIL and its subsidiaries (Olam) \ndirectly  source  raw  materials  in  the  project  countries.  Disruptions  to  agricultural  supply  chains \ncaused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic have impacted smallholder farmers as \nlocal  markets  close  down  and  smaller  traders  cease  buying.  The  impact  of  COVID-19  on \nlivelihoods of female farmers is disproportionately harsh, given their limited access to land, credit, \nand inputs. Olam\u2019s role as a sustainable buyer of agricultural products at scale will provide timely \nsupport to smallholder farmers\u2019 livelihoods, particularly for female farmers. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \nA. \n \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n1. \n\nProject Identification \n\n \n3. \nCOVID-19 impact on smallholder farmers. Smallholder farmers in Asia and the Pacific \nare facing a disproportionate impact on their livelihoods because of the COVID-19 pandemic and \nthe  ensuing  economic  slowdown. 2  Smallholder  farmers  are  experiencing  a  decline  in  their \npurchasing  power,  increasing  amounts  of  food  loss,  falling  prices,  and  other  disturbances \ncaused mainly by the disruption of agricultural supply chains. With low average incomes even \nbefore  the  pandemic,  smallholder  farmers  are  now  enduring  worsening  conditions.  Local \nagricultural supply chain disruptions coupled with economic contraction stemming from COVID-\n19 have drastically reduced farmers\u2019 sales volumes and prices because of market closures and \nthe  shrinking  number  of  and  demand  from  traders.  Prolonged  lockdowns  could  worsen  the \nfinancial burden of farmers as loan payment due dates approach, payments are missed, or loans \ngrow. The impact will be most severe on smallholder farmers with little savings from harvests and \nreturns from earlier sales.3 \n \n4. \nAgriculture  key  to  fight  poverty  during  the  pandemic.  Extreme  poverty  remains  a \nlargely  rural  phenomenon,  with  two-thirds  of  the  global  extremely  poor  living  in  rural  areas.4 \nCOVID-19 could push 34 million more people into extreme poverty by the end of 2020 and an \nadditional 130 million by 2030.5 More than half of the extremely poor are in Asia and the Pacific, \nwhere  agriculture  is  characterized  by  unorganized,  small-scale  farming. 6  Most  smallholder \nfarmers are not included in formal value chains and face challenges that include lack of access \nto finance and quality inputs, low yields, lack of storage and market infrastructure, limited local \n\n \n\n1  In descending order of proportion of total project size. \n2  Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). 2020.

Rome. \n5  United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. 2020.  World Economic Situation and Prospects as of \n\nMid-2020. New York. \n\n6  Agriculture is the largest sector in Asia and the Pacific, accounting for 37% of total employment. \n\n \n\n\fvalue addition, and dependence on brokers (footnote 2). As most of the rural poor are smallholder \nfarmers,7 supporting agriculture is critical to avoid increased poverty levels. \n \n5. \nViet Nam. Agriculture has made significant progress, but smallholder farmers have been \nleft behind. Agriculture contributes about 14% of gross domestic product (GDP) and employs 37% \nof the labor force. Yet, in the Central Highlands, one of the main agricultural regions, where 71% \nof  the  population  are  smallholder  farmers,  the  poverty  rate  is  22%\u2014more  than  twice  the \nnationwide  rate.8 The  difficulties  that  smallholder  farmers  in  the  Central  Highlands  are  facing \nbecause  of  droughts  since  early  2020  (e.g.,  extremely  low  water  levels  in  rivers)  have  been \nexacerbated  by  supply  chain  disruptions  stemming  from  the  pandemic.  Gender  inequalities  in \nagriculture, food, and nutrition security are visible in women\u2019s disproportionate levels of unpaid \nlabor and their lack of access to resources (e.g., land, finance, technology, training, and markets) \nand agricultural extension services.9 \n \n6. \nIndonesia.  Most  food  crop  producers  are  landless  or  cultivate  small  landholdings.  The \nfarmers earn low incomes and fall into and out of poverty, contributing to the rural poverty rate of \n14%, which is significantly higher than the 8% urban poverty rate. In the second quarter of 2020, \nGDP contracted by 5.3% year-on-year and the poverty rate is projected to increase from 9.5% in \n2019  to  10.7%\u201311.6%  in  2020. 10  Diminishing  demand  from  coffee  retail  outlets  in  Java, \ncompounded by supply chain disruptions because of the pandemic, has eroded the income of \ncocoa and coffee farmers, leaving them vulnerable to food insecurity.11 Women are involved in all \nagricultural activities. However, despite serving as the backbone of one of the most economically \nimportant sectors, women in agriculture are marginalized and often have little access to financial \nresources, knowledge, and technology to improve their crop yields and livelihoods (footnote 11). \n \n7. \nPapua New Guinea. Most smallholder farmers are poor. Most farming households can \nbe  characterized  as  low-input,  low-output  producers.  Of  people  living  in  rural  areas,  91%  are \npoor.12 Agriculture accounts for one-third of GDP, with 75% of the population relying on agriculture \nfor their main livelihood. Half the population rely on coffee and cocoa as the main cash crops. The \npandemic  has  compounded  the  stress  in  food  systems  from  African  swine  fever  and  fall \narmyworm,  which  might  undermine  food  security  and  nutrition,  particularly  for  the  rural \npopulation.13 Persistent institutional and governance challenges in conjunction with discriminatory \ncultural  norms  mean  gender  disparities  persist,  with  women  lacking  equitable  access  to  key \nagricultural and rural resources and services, knowledge, and markets, despite their prominent \nrole in subsistence food production, agricultural value chains, and rural livelihoods.14 \n \nGender inequality. While aggregate data show that women comprise about 43% of the \n8. \nagricultural labor force in developing countries, the proportion of women directly engaged in the \ncommercial supply of farmed produce is estimated to be significantly lower because of their lack \nof secure control over land, labor, or other inputs required to guarantee the delivery of sufficient \nquantity  and  quality. 15  Despite  their  significant  involvement  in  farming,  because  of  cultural \nattitudes,  discrimination,  and  lack  of  recognition  of  their  role,  women  have  limited  access  to \n\n \n\n7  FAO. 2014.

On  average,  female  farmers  receive  only  5%  of  all  agricultural  extension  services.16 \nCOVID-19 threatens to expose and exacerbate gender differences. Expected to care for out-of-\nschool  children  or  sick relatives,  female farmers  are more  likely to  bear the  brunt  of  additional \ndomestic  responsibilities.  With  less  savings  because  of  reduced  remittances,  women  will  be \nunable to weather income losses from the effects of COVID-19 and will likely struggle to buy the \nseeds and fertilizers needed for the following planting season. Women who are widowed because \nof COVID-19 risk disinheritance, as women\u2019s property rights are often conditional on marriage.17 \n \nWhen women farmers have better access to technical training and the necessary inputs, \n9. \nthey are more likely to adopt good agricultural practices and improve their productivity. If women \nfarmers  simply  had  the  same  access  as  men  to  productive  resources,  their  agricultural  yields \nwould  increase  by  20%\u201330%  (footnote  18).  Another  major  barrier  to  increasing  female  farmer \nproductivity is lack of female extension agents, with women unfortunately representing just 15% \nof the world\u2019s agents (footnote 18). Female farmers trained by female extension officers receive \nmore extension services, learn more, and apply more best practices than those trained by male \nextension officers.18 \n \n10. \nProject  selection.  Olam  is  a  global  agribusiness  that  has  a  unique  business  model  of \nsourcing directly from smallholder farmers. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has an existing \nrelationship  with  Olam,  with  loans  in  2018  to  OIL  and  Caf\u00e9  Outspan  Vietnam  Limited,19 OIL\u2019s \ninstant  coffee  plant  in  Viet  Nam.  ADB  is  providing  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  Olam  to  train \n20,000 smallholder coffee farmers across Indonesia, PNG, Timor-Leste, and Viet Nam.20 Olam \nseeks to continue to support over 100,000 smallholder farmers from whom it directly procures raw \nmaterials and requested ADB to assist its business in the project countries that need more working \ncapital because of the COVID-19 crisis. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n \nThe project will help sustain the livelihoods of smallholder farmers impacted by COVID-19 \n11. \nin  Viet  Nam,  Indonesia,  and  PNG  by  providing  working  capital  financing  to  OIL  and  OTPL  to \nincrease raw material procurement from farmers. \n \nPreserving smallholder farmer livelihoods in the COVID-19 context. The project will \n12. \nprovide  working  capital  financing  to  OIL  and  OTPL  for  smallholder  farmer  supply  in  Viet  Nam \n(coffee,  cashews,  and  pepper);  Indonesia  (coffee  and  cocoa);  and  PNG  (coffee  and  cocoa). \nWorking  capital  needs  include  higher  inventory  because  of  increased  procurement  of  crops  to \nbuild buffer inventory to cope with supply chain disruptions.21 The increase in advances to farmers \nand receivables from farmers and small traders will be financed, as well. The project will augment \nthe direct benefits to smallholder farmers by leveraging existing Olam sustainability programs that \n\n \n\n16 FAO. 2011. The State of Food and Agriculture 2010\u201311.

Despite COVID-19\u2013related disruptions, Olam, to \n13. \nsustain its business, will increase its procurement of crops from farmers, provide more advances \nto  farmers,  and  increase  its  receivables  from  farmers  and  small  traders.  These  activities  will \nsupport smallholder farmers by providing stable offtake for their production. [Redacted] While the \ncash conversion cycle (number of working capital days) is expected to return to pre\u2013COVID-19 \nlevels by 2022, the expected growth will create additional working capital needs, which justifies \nthe medium-term financing solution. \n \n[Redacted] While banks will continue to provide working capital, commercial banks have \n14. \nbeen reducing their exposure to commodities globally, including in Asia, because of the COVID-\n19 pandemic, leaving a \u201cfunding hole\u201d for crucial parts of the global food supply chain.25 This gap \nwill be bridged by the project. Uninterrupted funding to the food system must be ensured through \nintegrated agribusiness companies such as Olam that source directly from smallholder farmers. \nOlam\u2019s continued operations in the project countries will help keep food supply chains secure and \nfunctioning and mitigate the pandemic\u2019s impact on vulnerable groups, particularly for more than \n100,000 smallholder farmers from whom OIam directly sources raw materials. \n \n15. \nGender mainstreaming. The project aims to help bridge persistent gender gaps through \na  gender  action  plan,  which  includes  increasing  the  proportion  of  female  farmers  that  Olam \nsources from, making Olam\u2019s farmer training programs more gender inclusive, and exploring more \ngender equality in farmer payment mechanisms. A strong gender element for the project will help \nmitigate the disproportionate impact that the pandemic has on female farmers. \n \n\n3. \n\nBorrowers \n\n \n16. \nThe borrowers are OIL, a public limited company incorporated in Singapore, and OTPL, \nOIL\u2019s dedicated treasury company. OIL is a leading agribusiness company with presence in 70 \ncountries. It differentiates itself by focusing on niche commodities and businesses, buying from \ngrowers  and  village-level  agents  at  the  farm  gate,  and  providing  value-added  solutions  and \nservices  to  customers  (e.g.,  traceability  guarantees). 26 Temasek  Holdings,  the  Singapore \nsovereign wealth fund, became the majority shareholder of OIL in 2014, owning 53.4%. Mitsubishi \nCorporation  took  a  20.0%  equity  stake  in  OIL  in  2015.  OIL\u2019s  management  team  has  a  6.5% \nownership in the company. The 13-member board includes two executive directors, one Temasek \nnominee, two Mitsubishi nominees, and eight independent directors. \n \n\n \n\n22 Olam assists smallholder farmers through the Olam Livelihood Charter, which assures customers that their product \n\nis sustainable and traceable and helps rural communities. \n\n23 As part of the TA, 6,000 smallholder coffee farmers will be trained in Indonesia, 4,000 in PNG, and 3,500 in Viet Nam.  \n24 ADB. 2017.

Tax integrity due diligence was required only because of material \nrelated  party  transactions  in  the  investment. 28  The  independent  auditors  of  OIL  and  OTPL \nconfirmed that these  transactions  were  conducted  at  arm\u2019s  length,  and details  about them  are \nreported  in  OIL\u2019s  annual  financial  statements,  which  are  reviewed  by  the  Singapore  Stock \nExchange. ADB\u2019s review of OIL and OTPL does not give ADB cause to believe that they are being \nused for money laundering, terrorism financing, tax secrecy, tax evasion, or tax fraud. \n \nB. \n \nImpact.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  adverse  social  and  economic \n18. \nimpact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  reduced,  especially  for  farmers.  Aligned  with  ADB\u2019s \nComprehensive Response to COVID-19,29 the project will help preserve the income of farmers by \nallowing Olam to continuously procure raw materials from them even during the pandemic. The \nproject is aligned with the target of the Sustainable Development Goals of ensuring sustainable \nfood  production  systems,  and  implementing  resilient  agricultural  practices  that  increase \nproductivity  and  production  and  strengthen  capacity  for  adaptation  to  other  disasters  such  as \nthose caused by the pandemic (Target 2.4).30 \n \n19. \noperations improved and farmers\u2019 livelihoods sustained. \n \nOutputs.

The loan \nwill be guaranteed by OIL. The use of loan proceeds will be earmarked for working capital in Viet \nNam, Indonesia, and PNG. The facility will have a maturity of 3 years. \n \nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n26. \n\nADB assistance will add value in three areas: \n(i) \n\nFilling  a  market  gap  for  commodity  traders.  Because  of  the  COVID-19 \npandemic,  a  few  second-tier  commodity  traders  have  defaulted, 41  or  have \nstruggled  to  refinance  their  debt  obligations  as  markets  have  become  more \nvolatile.42 While commercial banks are comfortable renewing existing lines to large \ncommodity  traders,  increasing  exposure  has  proven  to  be  a  challenge.  ADB\u2019s \nworking  capital  loan  will  (a)  deliver  immediate  support  for  incremental  working \ncapital  needs  of  Olam  for  smallholder  farmer  supply,  receivables,  and  farmer \nadvances; and (b) step in to fill insufficient liquidity from commercial banks. \nGender mainstreaming. The strong gender element for the project in the COVID-\n19  context  will  help  address  the  disproportionate  impact  that  the  pandemic  is \nhaving on female farmers and women living in rural poverty.  \n[Redacted] \n\n(ii) \n\nRisks \n\n \nC. \n \n[Redacted] \n \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\n27. \nADB  has  categorized  the  loan  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n(2009) as follows: environment category C, involuntary resettlement category C, and indigenous \npeoples  category  C.  ADB  has  undertaken  due  diligence  and  reviewed  the  project\u2019s  potential \nenvironmental and social impacts and the measures in the safeguard reports and plans to avoid, \nminimize, mitigate, and compensate for adverse impacts. The environmental and social measures \nand  the  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  of  Olam  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and \nenvironmental impacts are deemed adequate. \n \n28. \nThe loan will be used to finance working capital for OIam\u2019s raw material procurement in \nthe project countries. The loan is a follow-on to the existing loan approved by the ADB Board of \nDirectors in 2017 and aims to support response to or reduce adverse socioeconomic impacts of \nCOVID-19 on smallholder farmers. ADB proceeds will not be utilized to finance any construction \n\n \n40 ADB. 2017. Standard Explanatory Data Indicator Definitions.

No land \nacquisition or impact on indigenous peoples is envisaged on account of ADB\u2019s use of proceeds. \n \n29. \nOlam  has  corporate  environmental  and  social  management  systems,  composed  of \npolicies, standards, and codes of practices that were assessed during the due diligence process \nof the existing loan and found to be compliant with regulatory requirements and international good \nindustry  practices.  The  systems  were  strengthened  through  the  adoption  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  requirements  in  the  expansion  of  Olam\u2019s  four  existing  facilities  supported  by \nADB. Olam confirmed through the annual environmental and social monitoring reports submitted \nto ADB that no environmental and social noncompliance and grievances were recorded regarding \nany of the facilities and activities supported by ADB. The environmental and social performance \nof the existing loan and the institutional capacity of Olam to manage environmental and social \nissues linked to their operations are deemed satisfactory.  \n \n30. \nOlam  implements  the  following  sustainability  policies  for  its  supply  chain:  Living \nLandscape  Policy,  Olam  Supplier  Code,  Olam  Livelihood  Charter,  and  Olam  Plantation \nConcessions  and  Farm  Code.  Their  guiding  principles  set  out  all  conditions  of  the  agreement \nbetween Olam and suppliers and farmers, including those to eliminate unsustainable practices in \nland management and to ensure compliance with applicable International Labour Organization \nstandards, national labor requirements, and industry standards.  \n \n31. \nOlam will continue to report regularly to ADB on its compliance with its Environmental and \nSocial  Monitoring  System  and  abide  by  national  laws  and  regulations.  Olam  will  comply  with \nnational labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy (2001), take measures to \ncomply with internationally recognized core labor standards.43 \n \n39. \nEffective  gender mainstreaming. [Redacted] Olam  has  a human  resource  policy  that \nincludes provisions on prohibiting sexual harassment in the workplace; ensuring gender equality \nin recruitment, wages, and benefits; and providing child support for female employees. Olam has \ncommitted to implement measures to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment in \nits business activities following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998). Key  aims of \nthe gender action plan are to (i) increase the number of female farmers in Viet Nam, Indonesia, \nand PNG from whom Olam directly procures raw materials; (ii) increase the proportion of female \nfarmers  participating  in the  farmer  training  program;  (iii) increase  the  proportion  of  female  field \ncoordinators delivering the farmer training program; (iv) train all field coordinators, who deliver the \nfarmer  training  program,  in  gender-inclusive  facilitation  methods;  and  (v)  undertake  a  pilot  to \ndetermine  the  feasibility  of  a  more  gender-equitable  crop  payment  scheme.  Olam  will  submit \nperiodic reports on the implementation of gender measures. \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n40. \nOIL and OTPL were advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice \nrelating  to  combating  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.  ADB  will \nensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\n43 ADB. 2003.
