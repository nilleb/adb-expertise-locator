An initial environment examination for the project loan \n(core  and  supplementary  appendixes)  and  an  environment \nloan \nfor \nassessment  of \n(supplementary appendix) were undertaken. \n \nThe  overall  expected  impact  of  the  DWSSDP  is  to  contribute  to \nsustained economic growth and improved public health conditions \nin  the  urban  centers  of  Bangladesh,  particularly  in  the  Dhaka \nMetropolitan  Area,  by  improving  the  water  supply  services.  The \nDWSSDP is the first phase of a long-term support program for the \nurban  water  supply  sector  based  on  the  Partnership  Framework \nthat  the  external  development  partners  and  the  Government \nagreed upon. The successful implementation of the DWSSDP will \nhelp reduce child mortality and improve health generally, increase \nthe productivity of women by shortening the time required to fetch \nand  store  water,  and  conserve  precious  natural  resources\u2014\nsurface  and  groundwater.  The  program  and  project  loans  under \nthe  DWSSDP  are  designed  to  complement  each  other  in \nachieving progress towards these key goals. \n \n \n \nThe  program  loan  will  support  the  reforms  in  the  urban  water \nsupply  sector  laid  out  in  Sector  Development  Programme\u2013Water \nand  Sanitation  Sector  in  Bangladesh  (SDP-WSSB)  2006  by \nassisting  the  Government  in  improving  the  management  and \nincluding \noperation  of  urban  water  supply \npourashavas (peri-urban towns) and Water Supply and Sewerage \nAuthorities  (WASAs).  The  reforms  under  the  program  loan  will \nhelp achieve sustainable and improved operation of water supply \nservices  in  the  urban  areas.  The  reforms  include  (i)  improving \nlocal  governance  and  strengthening  local  institutional  framework; \n(ii)  preparing  sector  strategy  and  plan;  (iii)  improving  financial \nsustainability;  and  (iv)  strengthening  Dhaka  Water  Supply  and \nSewerage  Authority  (DWASA)  governance  and  organizational \nstructure  and \nfinancial  management  capacity.  Appendix  4 \npresents  a  development  policy  letter  and  policy  matrix  of  the \n\ninstitutions, \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nProgram  along  with  strategic  goals,  key  targets,  and  process  for \neach output.  \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of SDR31,843,000 ($50 million equivalent) will be provided \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  with  a  term  of  24  years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, and an annual interest charge \nof 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter;  \n \n31 December 2013 \n\n \nEstimated Program \nCompletion Date \n \nTranches \n\n \nExecuting Agencies and \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nCounterpart Funds \n\n \n\n \nThe loan will be released in two tranches of SDR15,922,000 (first \ntranche)  and  SDR15,921,000  (second  tranche)  ($25  million \nequivalent)  when  the  Government  and  DWASA  comply  with  the \nconditions for their release.   \n \nThe Executing Agencies (EAs) will be the Finance Division of the \nMinistry  of  Finance  (MOF),  and  the  Local  Government  Division \n(LGD)  of  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government,  Rural  Development \nand  Cooperatives.  DWASA  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency  for \ncertain activities, as specified in the policy matrix. \n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  foreign  exchange \ncosts  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and \nprocured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible items and \nimports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  In \naccordance  with \nthe  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirement for Program \nLoans, the reimbursement procedure will be used to disburse the \nloan  proceeds  based  on  certification  by \nthe  Government. \nSupporting  import  documentation  will  not  be  required  if,  during \neach  year  that  loan  proceeds  are  expected  to  be  disbursed,  the \ntotal  value  of  the  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember \ncountries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports  financed  under  other \nofficial  development  assistance  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  the \namount of the loan expected to be disbursed during that year. For \nthe first tranche, the import certification may cover goods procured \n180 days before loan effectiveness. With each withdrawal request, \nthe  Government  will  certify  its  compliance  with  this  formula. \nOtherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing  procedures  will \nbe  required.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  the  loan \nproceeds. \n \nThe  Government  will  use  the  local  currency  counterpart  funds \ngenerated  by  the  loan  proceeds  to  meet  program  expenditures \nand associated costs of reform, as well as to help maintain current \nlevels of social expenditures. The counterpart funds generated by \nthe proceeds will be transferred from the MOF to LGD to meet the \ncosts  and  counterpart  funding  requirements  of  implementing  the \nsector reform. \n \n\n\fThe Project Loan \n \nOutcomes \n\n \nOutputs \n\n \nProject Investment Plan \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\niii\n\n \n \nThe Project will contribute to sustainable provision and operation \nof  urban  water  supply  services  in  Dhaka,  by  rehabilitating  and \nstrengthening  the  water  supply  system  based  on  the  long-term \npolicy  and  investment  roadmap.  The  physical  investment  under \nthe Project will be complemented by capacity building of DWASA \nto  enable  the  authority  to  competently  manage  the  water  supply \nsystems  for  about  12.3  million  people  in  Dhaka.  The  Project  has \nthree components: \n \nComponent A: Distribution System and Quality Improvement. \nThis will involve rehabilitation and optimization of DWASA\u2019s water \ndistribution  network  to  minimize  losses  and  to  enable  24-hour \npressurized  water  supply;  and  provision  of  water  quality \nassurance and control measures.  \n\nand \n\nrecord \n\nsystems; \n\ncustomer \n\ncollection,  and \n\n(iii) contract  structuring, \n\nInstitutional \nComponent  B:  Capacity  Building \nStrengthening. This will involve the following subcomponents: (i) \ninstitutionalization of sound financial management, efficient billing, \nrevenue \n(ii) \ncomprehensive training of all levels of staff to optimize operational \nperformance and upgrading of training facilities; and (iii) extensive \ndemand control and awareness campaign for consumers.  \n \nComponent  C:  Project  Management  and  Implementation \nSupport. This component will support (i) project management and \nmonitoring;  (ii)  detailed  planning  and  design  activities  under  the \nProject; \ntendering,  execution,  and \nmanagement;  and  (iv)  construction  supervision.  In  addition,  the \ncomponent will assist DWASA in conducting a feasibility study for \nan  optimal  location  for  the  future  surface  Water  Treatment  Plant \n(WTP)  with  a  capacity  of  500  million  liters  per  day.  The \nconsultants  engaged  also  will  prepare  an  outline  design  and \nprepare tender documents for the WTP. \n \nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  $212.7  million \n(including  the  contribution  of  the  Government),  including  taxes, \nduties, interest charges on the ADB loan, and physical and price \ncontingencies. \n \nADB will provide SDR95,530,000 ($150 million equivalent), which \nis  70.5%  of  the  total  cost.  The  Government  will  finance  the \nequivalent  of  $62.7  million,  or  29.5%  of  the  total  project  cost, \nincluding  taxes  and  duties,  resettlement  cost,  land  acquisition, \nremuneration  of  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  part  of \nthe civil works, and other miscellaneous costs. \n\n \n\n\f \nCost Estimates \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  ADB  will  provide  a \n\niv \n\n \n\n \n\n \nRelending Terms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nSource \n\nCost \n\nPercent \n\n($ million) \n\nAsian Development Bank (ADF) \nGovernment of Bangladesh \n\nTotal \n\n150.0 \n62.7 \n212.7 \n\n70.5 \n29.5 \n100.0 \n\nADF = Asian Development Fund. \nSources:  Government  of  Bangladesh  and  Asian  Development  Bank \nestimates. \n\n \nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $212.7  million,  including  taxes \nand duties of $16.1 million. \n \n\nloan  of  SDR95,530,000  ($150  million \nequivalent)  from  its  Special  Funds  resources  to  help  finance  the \nProject. The loan will a term of 32 years, grace period of 8 years, \nand    interest  charge  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period \nand 1.5% per annum thereafter.   \n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  relend  to  DWASA  pursuant  to  a \nsubsidiary  loan  agreement  with  terms  and  conditions  acceptable \nto  ADB.  Relending  terms  will  include  a  repayment  period  of  20 \nyears, including a 5-year grace period, and annual interest rate of \n5%.  The  Government  of  Bangladesh  will  assume  the  foreign \nexchange risk. \n \nUntil 30 June 2014 \n \n31 December 2013 \n\n \nDWASA \n \nDWASA will be responsible for overall management, supervision, \nand  execution  of  the  Project.  A  Project  Management  Unit  (PMU) \nwill be established, consisting of one full-time project director with \nthe rank of Deputy Managing Director (DMD) or chief engineer or \nadditional chief engineer. In addition, there will be three dedicated \ndeputy project directors. The deputy project director (finance) will \nbe recruited from outside of DWASA through competitive selection \nprocess.  The  two  other  deputy  project  directors,  who  will  head \ntechnical  eastern  zone  and  technical  western  zone,  will  be  the \nrank  of  the  superintending  engineers  or  above.  The  project \ndirector  and  the  three  deputy  project  directors  will  be  appointed \nexclusively to the Project. Four executive engineers will assist the \ndeputy  project  directors  in  managing  the  works  under  them.  The \nPMU  will  be  responsible  for  all  day-to-day  management  of  the \nproject, including but not limited to (i) preparing an overall project \nimplementation  plan  and  detailed  work  program;  (ii)  providing \noverall  monitoring  and  guidance  on  implementation  of  project \nworks;  (iii)  carrying  out  all  tendering  and  execution  of  contracts; \n(iv) monitoring and supervising all project management activities; \n\n\f \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProgram and Project \nBenefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\nv\n\nfull  compliance  with \n\n(v)  preparing  necessary  project  progress  and  project  completion \nthe  ADB\u2019s \nreport;  and  (vi)  ensuring \nresettlement, environmental, and other safeguard policies.  \n \nProcurement  of  all  goods  and  services  to  be  financed  under  the \nProject will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  All  civil  works \ncontracts  estimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  $1  million  or  more \nwill  be  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB). \nCivil works contracts estimated to cost less than $1 million will be \nprocured using national competitive bidding (NCB). To the extent \npracticable,  goods  will  be  grouped  into  procurement  packages \nlarger  than  $500,000  to  be  suitable  for  ICB  procedures.  Goods \nthat cannot be grouped into larger contracts and are estimated to \ncost  less  than  $500,000  per  contract  will  be  procured  through \nnational  competitive  bidding.  The \nfeasibility  of  community \ncontracting  will  be  examined  on  a  case-by-case  basis  for  slum \nand/or  bulk  water  supply  and  other  community-level  works  not \nexceeding  $10,000  in  value,  and  will  need  pre-fact  approval  by \nADB.  NCB  procedures  applicable  to  the  Project  are  specified  in \nthe  Government\u2019s  Public  Procurement  Act  2003.  Miscellaneous \nminor  goods  expected  to  cost  less  than  the  equivalent  of \n$100,000  will  be  purchased  using  shopping  procedures.  NCB \npackages  valued  at  more  than  $100,000  each  will  be  subject  to \nprior review by ADB. \n \nConsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  under  the  Project  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  All  consultants  under  the \nProject  will  be  engaged  as  firms  and  will  be  engaged  following \nADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) procedures.  \n \nThe  investment  under  DWSSDP  will  cover  four  out  of  six  water \nsupply zones in the Dhaka city for immediate system rehabilitation \nand  optimization.  Detailed  studies  will  be  also  prepared  for  the \nnext phase to rehabilitate the remaining two zones and to develop \nnew  water  source.  While  the  program  is  the  first  phase  of  the \nlong-term  support  to  the  Dhaka  city,  once  completed,  the \nrehabilitated system supported by new water source development \nwill ensure stable and sustained water supply to entire population \nin Dhaka Metropolitan Area (DMA). The poor will benefit from the \noverall  improvement  of  the  water  supply  system  while  other \ndevelopment  partners  will  provide  targeted  services  to  the  poor \nunder  the  Partnership  Framework.  The  user  survey  conducted \nduring  the  project  preparatory  Technical  Assistance  showed  that \nthe  poor  women  will  benefit  most  from  the  improved  services  in \nterms of time saving and improved health conditions. \n \nRehabilitation of the existing pipeline, the major component of the \nProject, carries risks. Although DWASA maintains digital maps of \nits pipelines and has general ideas of where prevalent illegal and \npoor  connections  might  be,  the  real  extent  only  emerges  at  the \n\n \n\n\f \nTechnical Assistance \n\nvi \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\ntime  of  excavation.  Though  the  Project  is  based  on  conservative \nassumptions,  the  required  works  and  costs  to  rehabilitate  and \noptimize the system might exceed the original estimate. This risk \nwill  be  mitigated  by  careful  preparatory  works  based  on  lessons \nlearned  from  the  pilot  scheme,  and  substantial  engineering \nconsulting support to DWASA during project implementation. \n \nDespite  firm  commitment  of  the  Government,  resistance  to  the \nreforms program might arise from outside and within (for example, \nfrom unions). Tariff adjustment may face opposition, undermining \npolitical support to the reform. The reform program is underpinned \nby  the  Partnership  Framework  between  the  Government  and \nmajor  development  partners  to  support  the  Government  initiative \nin a coherent manner. To minimize the social impact and sustain \nbroad  public  support,  the  tariff  adjustment  will  be  carried  out \ngradually  based  on  the  affordability  study  and  with  the  help  of \ncommunication  programs  which \ninvolves  Community-Based \nOrganizations (CBOs) and NGOs.  \n \nIn  conjunction  with  the  Project,  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  be \nprovided  for  advisory  assistance  to  the  Government  in  improving \nand strengthening the management and operation of urban water \nsupply and sanitation services. This will include assistance to LGD \nand  DWASA  in  preparing  and  implementing  key  policy  reforms. \nThe  TA  also  will  assist  DWASA  in  conducting  the  necessary \ntechnical preparation for introducing optimization measures in the \nexisting water supply sources; and in supporting the smooth start-\nup of project implementation.  \n \nThe total cost of the TA is estimated at $3,125,000, of which ADB \nwill  finance  $2,500,000  on  a  grant  basis  from  its  TA  funding \nprogram. The TA consultants will be recruited in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.

The  design  and \nmonitoring framework for the Program is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\n \nA. \n \nBangladesh  has  the  seventh  largest  population  in  the  world.  However,  its  land  area  is \n2. \nlimited, making Bangladesh one of the most densely populated countries in the world.1 Almost a \nquarter  of  its  140  million  people  (35  million)  live  in  urban  areas,  and  the  urban  population  is \nincreasing  2.5%  a  year\u2014nearly  twice  the  national  rate.2 Almost  one  third  of  the  total  urban \npopulation lives in Dhaka Metropolitan Area (DMA, the capital of Bangladesh), that is growing \ntwice  as  fast  as  other  urban  areas.  DWASA 3  serves  70%  of  the  DMA.  When  the  DMA \npopulation  reaches  17  million  in  2025,  less  than  45%  of  the  people  would  be  covered  by  the \nDWASA water supply system. 4 Most of the remaining uncovered population may abstract water \nfrom  their  private  wells,  using  the  same  aquifer.  The  Government  of  Bangladesh  (the \nGovernment) and DWASA face an enormous challenge in supplying safe, reliable water to the \ncapital city\u2019s growing population. \n \nBangladesh\u2019s economy has generally grown more than 5% annually during 2000-2006.5 \n3. \nHowever,  most  of  the  development  is  taking  place  in  the  cities,  Dhaka  in  particular.  Despite \nconsiderable progress, basic services in all urban centers are deficient. Of the 309 urban towns, \nonly  102  have  a  piped  water  supply  system.  In  most  towns,  the  water  supply  is  sourced  from \ndeep tube wells. Due to the high cost of electricity, water pumps run for only 10\u201312 hours per \nday, resulting in an intermittent water supply of 2\u20134 hours at most per day. Urban water supply \nconditions  typically  are  characterized  by  (i)  unaccounted-for-water  by  sub-zone  is  usually  as \nhigh as 50-60% of production,6 (ii) tariffs below average production costs, and (iii) low billing and \ncollection rates. On average, less than 20% of houses have their own connections, while about \n60% rely on shallow private tube wells. The remaining 20% of the population fetches water from \nstand  posts  or  from  public  tube  wells,  if  the  town  has  a  piped  water  supply  system.  Water \nshortages have become increasingly apparent because of the falling water tables resulting from \nunregulated extractions  of  groundwater.  Inadequate  basic urban  services,  including  sanitation, \nare  a  severe  hindrance  to  the  continued  development  of  urban  areas,  as  well  as  efforts  to \nreduce poverty. Rehabilitation and expansion of the existing systems, in parallel with investment \nin new systems in most towns and cities, is urgently needed. \n \n                                                 \n1   Unit  for  Policy  Implementation,  Local  Government  Division.  2005.

P. 179 (except 2002, which was 4.4%).  \n6   For overall Dhaka city\u2019s unaccounted-for-water, it is estimated in the range of 33-42%. These figures are based on \n\nbilled amount, rather than actual reliable meter reading. In Manikdi pilot area, actual readings gave 60%.     \n\n\f2 \n \n\n \n\nMore  than  26%  of  urban  households  lack  latrines  or  access  to  hygienic  sanitation. \n4. \nExcept for a limited waterborne sewerage system in Dhaka, which covers only 30% of the city \narea, no other urban centers have any form of sewerage system. Only 20% of the households in \nurban areas have access to a solid waste collection system. Most of Bangladesh has low-lying, \nflood-prone  areas,  and  groundwater  is  contaminated  by  naturally  occurring  arsenic.  Frequent \ncyclones  and  floods  during  the  rainy  season,  combined  with  inadequate  drainage  and  solid \nwaste  management,  increase  the  exposure  of  the  urban  population  to  the  effects  of  polluted \nwater. Waterborne diseases are prevalent, and infant mortality is high (Appendix 2, sector road \nmap  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A).    Hence,  sustainable  access  to  a  safe,  potable  water \nsupply and sound sanitation facilities is a high priority. \n \n5. \nThe  Local  Government  Division  (LGD)  under  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government,  Rural \nDevelopment and Cooperatives is overseeing the water supply and sanitation (WSS) sector and \npolicy.  Urban  WSS  services  are  provided  by  water  supply  and  sewerage  authorities  (WASA), \ncity  corporations,  and  pourashava  (peri-urban  town)  water  supply  sections  (PWSS).  The \nDepartment  of  Public  Health  Engineering  (DPHE)  implements  new  water  supply  systems  and \ncarries  out  major  rehabilitation  programs,  except  in  the  areas  managed  by  the  WASA.7 After \ncompletion of the works, DPHE hands over the WSS systems to local government institutions \n(LGI) for operation and maintenance (O&M). The shortcomings in this delivery situation are (i) \nabsence of demand management; (ii) inadequate cost recovery; (iii) inefficient service provision; \n(iv)  lack  of  financing  and  autonomy,  especially  in  setting  tariffs  and  staffing;  and  (v)  lack  of \ninvolvement  of  users  in  water  utility  planning  and  operation.  DPHE  undertakes  much  of  the \ndevelopment projects because of the weak capacities of the LGIs. Planning and public service \ndelivery  are  generally  supply-driven,  and  do  not  respond  adequately  to  users\u2019  needs.  Water \nconsumption does not depend on economic pricing, but on the availability of supply. The lack of \nautonomy  of  the  responsible  government  agencies  also  undermines  the  effective  service \ndelivery and quality standards. \n \nIn Dhaka and Chittagong, a semiautonomous WASA is responsible for WSS. This large \n6. \nwater utility operates and manages the system, as well as collects fees. Water is sourced from \ngroundwater  and  surface  water.  The  DWASA  has  numerous  institutional  and  financial \nconstraints,  similar  to  those  faced  by  urban  towns,  in  achieving  the  recovery  of  user  charges, \ncontrolling losses, and effectively managing the institution. A lack of commercial orientation and \nlow  tariffs  have  led  to  inefficient  practices  and  poor  financial  performance.  Planning  and \nimplementation  are  largely  a  supply-driven,  top-down,  and  target-oriented  processes,  which \nsuffer  from  unclear  priorities  and  uncoordinated  development.  All  agencies  involved  in  WSS \ntypically  prefer  to  meet  physical  targets  rather  than  establish  and  monitor  processes  for \nreaching goals related to facility operation, management, utilization, and maintenance. Despite \ngradual  reductions  in  water-related  mortality  and  morbidity  rates,  and  increased  physical \ncoverage, further development is needed across the sector. \n \n7. \nIn recognition of these needs, the Government included WSS improvement as part of its \nseven-point  agenda  for  reducing  poverty  in  its  2005  national  poverty  reduction  strategy \n(NPRS).8 By 2015, the NPRS aims to reduce poverty by 30%, and child mortality from 53 to 31 \nper  1,000  live  births.  The  Government  likewise  has  committed  to  achieving  the  Millennium \nDevelopment  Goals,  including  halving  the  proportion  of  people  without  access  to  sustainable \nsafe WSS by 2015. In addition, the Government goals and priorities highlight safe drinking water \nthe  new  Sector  Development \nand  appropriate  sanitation.  These  are  consolidated \n\nin \n\n                                                 \n7   Dhaka and Chittagong only. \n8   Government of Bangladesh. 2005. Poverty Reduction Strategy. Dhaka. \n\n\fIssues and Opportunities \n\nProgramme\u2013Water and Sanitation Sector in Bangladesh (SDP-WSSB) 2006, which includes (i) \nNational Policy for Safe Water Supply and Sanitation 1998, (ii) Sector Development Framework \n(SDF) 2004, (iii) Pro-Poor Strategy 2005, and (iv) National Policy for Arsenic Mitigation 2004. In \nparticular, the SDF 2004 sets an optimistic target and timescale, aiming for 100% coverage of \nbasic WSS by 2015.  \n \n8.  \nThe SDP-WSSB 2006 emphasizes (i) ensuring basic minimum needs related to WSS for \nall  citizens, especially  the  poor;  (ii)  decentralizing  the  service  delivery  and  capacity  building  of \nLGIs to sustain investments and good governance; (iii) recommending optimal service delivery \noptions and institutional framework; (iv) drawing a blueprint to realize sector reform and capacity \nbuilding  to  achieve  desired  coverage  and  performance  levels;  and  (v)  outlining  a  sector \ninvestment  plan  for  the  next  10  years  to  fulfill  sector  targets,  sector  reforms,  and  capacity \nbuilding  needs  within  the  available  resources.  Recognizing  the  overly  ambitious  target,  the \nGovernment  critically  reexamined  and  acknowledged  that,  while  the  policy  addresses  the  key \nissues,  it  lacks  operational  strategies  and  tools,  such  as  financial  allocations,  time  frame, \ninstitutional arrangements, legal instruments, and policy directives. \n \nB. \n \n9. \nAlthough the size of urban areas differs, issues and challenges that DWASA faces are \ncommon to the urban WSS sector in general. As such, they should be addressed as part of the \nsector-wide  reform  program  to  meet  the  challenges.  DWASA  is  currently  facing  six  major \nchallenges. \n \nInadequate  Supply  of  Clean  Water  to  Meet  Rapidly  Growing  Demand.  More  than \n10. \n80% of Dhaka\u2019s water supply comes from groundwater, and the upper aquifer of Dhaka already \nhas exceeded its withdrawal limit. As a result, almost half of the deep tube wells supplying water \nto  Dhaka  will  dry  up  by  2013.  The  lower  aquifer  can  accommodate  only  about  50  new  tube \nwells.  The  groundwater  supply  inevitably  and  urgently  will  have  to  be  augmented  with  treated \nsurface  water.  However,  treating  surface  water  is  much  more  technically  complex  and \nexpensive than using groundwater. \n \nPoor Quality of Water Distribution Network. The pilot program in Manikdi area (para. \n11. \n59)  found that all household connections are substandard and leaking, and that physical water \nlosses  are  up  to  50%.  This  is  under  very  low  pressure  conditions.  In  its  current  condition,  the \nnetwork cannot sustain the higher pressure required for transmitting treated water. In addition to \nlosses  due  to  leaks,  only  59%9 of  household  connections  have  water  meters  to  account  for \nconsumption\u2014and  the  installed  meters  are  often  inaccurate  or  inaccessible\u2014making  effective \nmanagement of demand virtually impossible. \n \nPoor  Quality  and  Reliability  of  Water.  Generally,  the  quality  of  groundwater  being \n12. \npumped into the water supply network of Dhaka is believed to be good. The quality deteriorates, \nhowever, as it moves through the piped network. The problems stem from a number of sources. \nLeaks  affect  the  hygienic  conditions  of  the  pipes  and  connections.  To  a  greater  degree,  the \nsystem's low and sometimes negative pressure\u2014caused by consumers using suction pumps or \nservice  connections \ntanks\u2014causes  extensive \ncontamination of the water within the network. In addition, the current treatment plants are not \n\nthe  bottom  of  underground \n\ninstalled  at \n\n                                                 \n9   ADB.  2005.  Technical  Assistance  to  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  Preparing  the  Dhaka  Water  Supply \nProject. Manila. TA 4651, approved on 22 September 2005, for $1 million. (PPTA final report). Page 11. para 45. \n\u201cDWASA indicated (April 2006) that there are 135,500 metered (59%) and 95,900 unmetered connections.\u201d  \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n\f4 \n \n\n \n\nworking  optimally  and  require  pre-treatment  facilities.  Water  quality  aside,  the  reliability  of \nsupply  is  severely  hampered  by  intermittent  power  supply  to  the  pumps,  which  do  not  have \nbackup generators. \n \nLimited  Coverage  of  Slum  Dwellers.  About  1.3  million  people  (or  15%  of  the \n13. \npopulation) in the DWASA service area are living in slums. DWASA serves the majority of the \nslum dwellers, many of whom have unauthorized connections. However, a significant number of \nthe more vulnerable slum dwellers still do not have access to services. This number is projected \nto increase to more than 4 million by 2025. \n \n14. \nFinancially  Unsustainable  Utility.  For  a  number  of  reasons,  including  extensive \nleakage in the system (unaccounted-for water), unsustainable tariffs, and poor accounting and \nmanagement  systems,  DWASA  is  unable  to  meet  Dhaka\u2019s  fast-growing  demand  for  water.  Of \nthe water that is accounted for (about 50%), only 62% of revenues are collected. In total, only \none  third  of  the  water  that  enters  the  network  is  ever  paid  for.  DWASA  accounting  and \nmanagement systems are outdated, inefficient, and often not transparent. \n \n15. \nInefficient or Ineffective Management Systems. DWASA and its operations are highly \npoliticized. As a result, in recent years, managing director (MD) position was vacant long time, \nand turnover of senior executives (including MD) is high. Workers unions exert strong pressure \non  management,  often  preventing  them  from  recruiting  key  staff  or  taking  disciplinary  action. \nThe  capacity  and  motivation  levels  of  staff  are  generally  low.  Customer  interface  is  extremely \nlimited.  DWASA\u2019s  management  systems  and  structure  barely  allow  for  effective  planning, \nallocation,  and  monitoring  of  resources.  Consequently,  DWASA  has  difficulty  serving  its \ncustomers effectively. \n \n16. \nImportant  Features.  Despite  the  huge  challenges,  Bangladesh\u2019s  water  sector  also \npresents a significant opportunity. The Government is strongly emphasizing development of the \nsector  in  its  NPRS,  which  has  broad  funding  agency  support  (Appendix  3).  The  SDP-WSSB, \ndeveloped  through  extensive  consultation,  outlines  a  clear  and  comprehensive  vision  for  the \nsector.  The  Government  and  its  external  development  partners  are  taking  a  broad-based  and \ndeliberate  approach  to  sector  reform  and  institutional  change.  Momentum  in  the  sector  is \nsignificant,  and  the  current  environment  is  conducive  to  change.  Other  development  partners \nwere  consulted  extensively  during  project  preparation.  As  a  result,  the  timing  is  well \nsynchronized  with  the  sector  reform  initiatives  of  other  development  partners  aimed  at \nstrengthening  WASAs  and  water  supply  bodies  within  pourashavas,  and  giving  them  greater \nresponsibility and autonomy.  \n \n17.  \nLessons  Learned.  The past and ongoing ADB projects in the sector include (i) District \nTowns Water Supply Project10 ($14.4 million), (ii) Second Water Supply and Sanitation Project11 \n($31  million),  and  (iii)  Secondary  Towns  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project 12 ($41 \nmillion).

In  other  post-project  evaluation  assessments,  ADB  found  DWASA  to  be  a  well-\nestablished  institution  with  adequate  technical  and  institutional  capacities. 15  However,  the \nassessment  recommended  the  preparation  of  an  adequate  investment  program  for  the  future, \nwith corresponding O&M, to properly maintain the water supply, sanitation, and drainage system \nfor Dhaka. Based on other key lessons learned, successful projects should (i) add enforceable \nmilestones in the form of a phased performance-based funding approach; (ii) place high priority \non  financial  performance  and  autonomy  of  the  local  water  supplying  bodies,  adopting  double-\nentry accounting systems, separating water supply accounts, training staff, and embracing the \nmove  to  public  limited  company  operating  models;  (iii)  reduce  the  number  of  contracts  and \nprocurements to minimize processing and implementation delays; and (iv) actively engage local \ncommunity  stakeholders  through  extensive  consultations  to  ensure  stronger  commitment  and \nsmoother implementation.  \n \n18.   ADB  is  taking  the  lead  in  supporting  water  supply  improvements  in  Dhaka,  while  the \nWorld  Bank  is  focusing  on  sewerage  and  drainage  improvements,  as  well  as  scaling  up \nsuccessful  WSS  service  provision  models  in  low-income  communities  and  slums  of  Dhaka, \njointly  with  Department  for  International  Development  (DFID).  The  Government  of  Japan  is \nfocusing  on  WSS  services  in  Chittagong.  Danish  International  Development  Assistance \n(Danida) is providing assistance for a new surface water treatment plant (Saidabad, phase II) to \naugment the water supply sources in Dhaka.    \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \n19. \nThe  overall  expected  impact  of  the  DWSSDP  is  to  contribute  to  sustained  economic \ngrowth and improved public health conditions in the urban centers of Bangladesh, particularly in \nthe  DMA,  by  improving  water  supply  services.  The  DWSSDP  is  the  first  phase  of  a  long-term \nsupport program for the urban water supply sector based on the Partnership Framework that the \nexternal development partners and the Government agreed upon (paragraphs 57\u201358 for details). \nThe  successful  implementation  of  the  DWSSDP  will  help  reduce  child  mortality  and  improve \ngeneral health, increase the productivity of women by shortening the time required to fetch and \nstore  water,  and  conserve  precious  natural  resources\u2014the  surface  and  groundwater.  The \nprogram  and  project  loans  under  the  DWSSDP  are  designed  to  complement  each  other  in \nachieving progress towards these key goals. \n \nB.  \n \n\nThe Program Loan  \n\n1. \n\nOutcomes \n\n \n20. \nThe  program  loan  will  support  the  reforms  in  the  urban  water  supply  sector  laid  out  in \nSDP-WSSB 2006 by assisting the Government in improving the governance and management \nof  urban  water  supply  institutions,  including  pourashavas  and  WASAs.  The  reforms  under  the \nprogram loan will help achieve the sustainable provision and operation of improved water supply \n\n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2004.

Appendix 4 presents \na  development  policy  letter  and  policy  matrix  of  the  Program  along  with  strategic  goals,  key \ntargets, and process for each output. \n \n\nfinancial  sustainability;  and \n\n2. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions    \n\n \n\na. \n\nImproving  Local  Governance,  and  Strengthening  Local  Institutional \nFramework \n\n \nDecentralize  and  Improve  the  Financial  Autonomy  of  Pourashavas  and  WASAs. \n21. \nThe  urban  sector  in  Bangladesh  comprises  six  city  corporations  (Barisal,  Chittagong,  Dhaka, \nKhulna,  Rajshahi,  and  Sylhet)  and  309  pourashavas.16 WSS  services  in  urban  areas  are  the \nresponsibility of WASAs (in Dhaka and Chittagong), and the WSS sections established by the \nauthorities  in  the  other  city  corporations  and  pourashavas.  The  DPHE  under  LGD  implements \nwater  supply  system  network  expansion  and  major  rehabilitation  programs  in  pourashavas. \nAfter  completing  the  programs,  DPHE  hands  over  the  systems  to  the  PWSSs  for  O&M.  The \nactivities  of  the  PWSSs  are  restricted  mostly  to  operation  of  the  electrical  pumps  for  the \nproduction  wells  and  reactive  maintenance  of  the  existing  systems  (e.g.,  repair  of  leaks). \nWASAs  and  PWSSs  still  lack  autonomy  in  many  areas.  For  example,  pourashavas  need  to \nobtain permission from the Government to create posts or to appoint staff in their setup. They \nalso have to seek approval from the Government on tariff changes. In the past, this practice has \nrestricted  the  pourashavas  and  WASAs  to  managing  the  O&M  of  water  supply  in  their \nrespective  areas.  Pourashavas  and  WASAs  need  to  be  decentralized  and  given  broader \nadministrative  and  financial  autonomy  to  (i)  manage  the  water  supply  system,  including  the \ninstallation  and  O&M  of  the  facilities  in  their  respective  areas;  (ii)  manage  billing;  and  (iii) \ndetermine the appropriate tariff increase.  \n \n22. \nEstablish  an  Independent  Water  Supply  Sector  Regulatory  Commission.  In \nBangladesh, regulatory bodies for telecommunications and power were approved in 2002. In the \nsame  year,  the  establishment  of  a  regulator  for  the  water  sector  was  proposed,  but  little \nprogress  has  been  made  since  then.  Regulators  are  often  perceived  as  protectors  of  the \ninterests  of  the  general  public  (the  customers  of  a  public  services  utility)  against  commercial \ninterests  of  private  operators.  Regulators  should  ensure  a  fair,  stable,  and  clear  enabling \nenvironment for service providers and consumers. The Program will support LGD to prepare a \nstudy  on  the  most  appropriate  form  for  regulatory  body  for  the  Bangladesh  WSS  sector,  and \nmake  recommendations  to  the  appropriate  authority  (the  Cabinet).  The  study  will  clarify  the \nfunctions,  roles,  and  responsibilities  of  the  regulator.  Once  LGD  makes  the  recommendation, \nthe Government is expected to establish an independent water supply regulatory commission, \nas envisaged in SDP-WSSB. \n \n23. \nEnhance Capacity of Pourashavas and WASAs in Managing and Delivering Water \nSupply Services. To improve the performance of the water supply utilities, and to cope with the \nincreasing  demand  for  high-quality  services  and  investments,  the  capacity  of  the  staff  and \nworkforce  should  be  enhanced  constantly.  LGD,  DWASA,  and  DPHE  need  to  prepare  and \npublish  a  5-year  capacity  building  program  for  PWSS  and  WASA  staff,  including  (i)  meter \n\n                                                 \n16   The  pourashavas  are  classified  into  class  A,  B,  and  C,  depending  on  their  revenue.  The  primary  targets  of  the  \n\n  Program are large pourashavas, rated class A, with established PWSS.  \n\n\fconnection,  (ii)  water  conservation,  (iii)  O&M,  (iv)  billing  and  accounting,  (v)  financial \nmanagement,  and  (vi)  public  health.  Starting  in  2010,  LGD,  pourashavas,  and  WASAs  will \nimplement the program, and the PWSS and WASA staff will receive training under the program. \nEach  year,  LGD  will  allocate  sufficient  budget  to  the  pourashavas  and  the  WASAs  for  the \ntraining of the water section staff.  \n\n \n\nb. \n\nPreparing Sector Strategy and Plan (Demand-side Management) \n\n \n24.   Promote  Effective  Water  Management  and  Conservation.  As  consumers  are  not \naccustomed to conserving water, they will use and waste water whenever water is in the pipe. \nWater consumption depends on the availability of water in the pipe network, and is not based on \nthe  actual  demand.  Incentives  to  conserve  water  and  penalties  for  wasteful  use  are  absent. \nLikewise, no incentives or penalties are in place for hygienic sanitation. The Government should \naddress  the  physical  problem  to  realize  stable  and  regular  water  flow  in  the  network.  It  also \nmust educate the public through awareness campaigns that explain in simple terms that water \ndistribution incurs costs, and that each user is responsible for keeping the entire system clean, \nefficient,  and  sustainable.  The  Program  should  target  all  age  groups,  including  primary  school \nchildren.  To  further  promote  water  conservation,  LGD  together  with  pourashavas  and  WASAs \nshould  suspend  the  practice  wherein  each  household  installs  its  own  water  connections  and \nmeters. To ensure that meters installed in households meet the desired standard of quality, the \npourashavas and WASAs should install them.  \n \n\nc. \n\nImproving Financial Sustainability \n\nDecentralize  and  Improve  the  Financial  Autonomy  of  Pourashavas  and  WASAs. \n25. \nThe SDP-WSSB points out that water tariffs in Bangladesh generally are too low. In most towns, \ntariffs  are  insufficient  to  cover  even  the  O&M  costs,  meaning  the  capital  investment  costs  are \nnot  recovered.  Poor  collection  efficiency  exacerbates  the  situation.  LGD  and  DPHE  will  allow \npourashavas to keep their revenues from water billings. LGD will instruct each of pourashava to \nset  up  a  separate  account  for  water  revenues,  establish  double-entry  bookkeeping  for  the \nPWSS, and maintain a sound inventory of the pourashava\u2019s water supply assets. Further, LGD \nwill allow the pourashavas and the WASAs to set and increase the water tariff in their respective \nareas annually, maintaining a level that would enable them to recover at least O&M costs after \nadjusting for inflation. \n \n\nd. \n\nStrengthening  DWASA  Governance,  Organizational  Structure,  and \nFinancial Management Capacity \n\nIntroduce  and  Apply  Good  Governance.  To  achieve  good  governance, \n\n \n26. \nthe \norganizational structure and management of DWASA should be improved, and compliance with \nthe WASA Act of 199617 should be ensured. Three main issues related to the implementation of \nthe 1996 act are pending for DWASA: (i) appointment of the managing director,18 (ii) approval of \nthe DWASA organization chart, 19 and (iii) implementation of the rules and regulations of the act. \nThe  DWASA  Act  grants  the  managing  director  a  tenure  of  3  years.  However,  managing \ndirectors  have  been  replaced  frequently  in  the  past  3  years.  The  previous  four  managing \n\n                                                 \n17 Government of Bangladesh. 1996. Water Supply and Sewerage Authority Act,1996. Dhaka. \n18 During  the  ADB  Appraisal  Mission  in  August  2007,  a  new  DWASA  managing  director  was  selected  through  a \ncompetitive process, appointed, and assumed office on 17 August. The new managing director is given an initial \ntenure of 3 years.   \n\n19 Organization  chart  is  commonly  referred  to  as  \u201cOrganogram\u201d  in  Bangladesh,  showing  the  overall  structure  of  an \n\norganization with departments, divisions, levels and number of posts.   \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\n\f8 \n \n\n \n\ndirectors  were  officials  seconded  from  the  Government.  With  frequent  changes  in  top \nmanagement,  it  is  difficult  for  DWASA  to  improve  performance  in  a  well-planned  and \ncoordinated  manner.  Each  managing  director  usually  brings  a  different  approach,  leading  to \nfrequent changes in the way DWASA operates. The second issue is that DWASA does not have \nan organization chart. A draft organization chart was prepared and has been awaiting approval \nfor 10 years. Without an approved organization chart, DWASA has been unable to make major \nchanges  in  staff  positions  from  the  organizational  structure  prescribed  by  the  outdated  1963 \nact.20 As  a  result,  some  departments  might  have  too  many  staff  for  the  required  tasks,  while \nothers might not have enough. The third issue is the implementing rules and regulations of the \n1996 act. Draft rules and regulations have been prepared, but not approved. While the 1996 act \ngoverns the overall operation, the rules and regulations are still based on the 1963 ordinance, \nmuch  of  which  is  outdated  and  obsolete.  The  main  constraints  on  the  institutional  setting  of \nDWASA  are  political.  Reforms  to  overcome  these  limitations  must  promote  DWASA\u2019s \nownership.  An  immediate  amendment  of  the  1996  act  is  not  considered  essential,  but  the  act \nmust be implemented properly to strengthen the operation of DWASA.  \n \n27.   Delineate  Responsibilities  Between  the  Board  and  the  Managing  Director.  The \ninstitutional strengthening of DWASA will aim to modify the rules and regulations to ensure an \nautonomous  operational  environment,  including  restructuring  of  the  board  and  management, \nand  the  establishment  of  effective  management  systems.  The  1996  act  is  not  clear  on  how \nmuch  authority  the  managing  director  has  to  make  decisions  on  day-to-day  business  affairs. \nSome provisions contradict others. In many of the provisions, the day-to-day business decisions \nby  the  managing  director  must  be  endorsed  by  the  board  and  approved  by  the  Government. \nThis  means  that  the  Government  might  delay  decisions  on  small  matters  that  need  to  be \naddressed quickly. As a result, DWASA is not an efficient, responsible, and customer-oriented \ninstitution. To be efficient, the roles and responsibilities of the board and the managing director \nmust  be  defined  clearly.  In  addition,  certain  day-to-day  activities  of  DWASA  still  require  board \napproval.  DWASA  management  should  initiate  immediately  a  dialogue  with  the  board  to \ndetermine how much power it will delegate.  \n \n28.   Under  the  1996  act,  WASA  should  be  able  to  manage  its  facilities  and  operate  with  a \nhigh degree of autonomy. DWASA should have a board that consists of key professionals from \ncivil society, and should be headed by a chairman appointed by the Government. However, its \nautonomy is constrained by a provision in the 1996 act that requires the board to seek approval \nfrom the Government on all matters in which the Government finances or acts as a warranty for \nfinance. 21 The  financial  dependency  of  WASAs  on  the  Government  further  constrains  their \nperformance.  This  situation  results  in  decisions  on  crucial  operational  and  organizational \naspects, including human resource development and employment, setting of tariffs and salaries, \nnot being made without the prior approval of the Government. This often can affect decisions on \nday-to-day operations. \n \n29.  \nImprove  DWASA  Operation  and  Business  Performance  Through  a  Medium-Term \nBusiness  Plan. The 1996 act established a framework for the responsibilities and mandate of \nWASAs.  However,  as  an  agency  responsible  for  the  water  supply,  sewerage,  and  drainage  in \nDhaka, DWASA should have an organizational vision of its own. DWASA should have at least a \n5-year business plan that explains its current strengths and weaknesses. In addition, a practical \noperations  manual  should  be  devised  and  put  into  effect,  laying  out  concrete  day-to-day \n\n                                                 \n20 Government of Bangladesh. 1963. Water Supply and Sewerage Authority Ordinance. Dhaka. \n21 The  Government  of  Bangladesh.  1996.  DWASA  Act.  Dhaka  (Clause  17.[4],  Chapter  IV.  Powers  and  Duties  of \n\nAuthority).  \n\n\fbusiness procedures. The performance of WASAs should encompass key elements such as (i) \nnetwork  monitoring;  (ii)  water  quality  control;  (iii)  metering,  billing,  and  collection;  and  (iv) \nconsumer grievance redress.   \n \n30.   Explore  Private  Sector  Participation  and  Elimination  of  Conflicts  of  Interest.  The \nactive  presence  of  various  labor  unions  and  employers\u2019  cooperative  societies  constrains  the \nmanagement  of  DWASA.  Billing  and  revenue  collection  in  three  of  six  water  supply  zones  of \nDhaka, covering approximately half the population and service connections, has been handled \nby  DWASA  Employees  Consumer  Supplies  Co-operative  Society  through  the  Program  for \nPerformance Improvement (PPI) agreement. 22 The PPI agreements are based on performance. \nThe billing efficiency of the PPI zones are generally higher than in the DWASA zones. However, \nthe division of responsibilities between DWASA staff and PPI staff is unclear and impractical in \nsome  areas.  For  example,  controlling  unaccounted-for  water  is  DWASA\u2019s  responsibility,  while \nPPI handles identification and disconnection of illegal connections. Further, meter maintenance \nis  under  DWASA,  while  meter  reading  is  under  PPI.  This  PPI  arrangement  has  various \nproblems,  as  it  creates  new  vested  interests  within  DWASA  and  has  conflict  of  interests  that \nshould  be  eliminated.  The  metering,  billing,  and  collecting  must  be  outsourced  to  a  separate \nentity; and PPI should be abolished or revamped to create a more appropriate system. Two of \nthe  unions  are  affiliated  with  the  two  major  political  parties,  while  the  third  is  independent. \nPolitical interventions interfere with and jeopardize the management\u2019s ability to recruit, promote, \nand  post  the  right  persons  at  the  right  positions.  A  committee  must  be  established  to  explore \nprivate sector participation to bring good corporate governance into WASAs. The committee will \nprepare a study and make recommendations with a time-bound action plan. The committee also \nwill review the existing PPI and recommend ways to eliminate conflicts of interest.  \n \n31.   Develop Financial Plan and Model for Future Investment. DWASA needs to assess \nfuture  investment  needs  at  least  up  to  2025, 23  and  recommend  a  financial  modeling  and \nmanagement structure to manage those needs. In this exercise, DWASA needs to analyze the \ntariff  structure,  determine  the  required  tariff  increases  to  address  future  financing  needs,  and \nassess financing conditions and capital investment needs. As semiautonomous utilities, WASAs \nneed  a  financial  model  of  their  operations  that  is  based  on  audited  WASA  financial  data,  and \nseveral scenarios for key performance enhancement. The key performance areas will include (i) \nreduction of nonrevenue water, (ii) improvement in the collection ratio and reduction in accounts \nreceivables,  (iii)  improvement  in  staffing  ratio,  and  (iv)  adjustment  of  energy  and  chemical \nconsumption.    \n \nIncrease  Transparency  in  DWASA  Operation  and  Address  Corruption  Issues. \n32.  \nDWASA is not immune to allegations of illegal practices ranging from unrecorded connections, \nmeter  tampering,  overbilling,  and  non-transparent  collections.  DWASA  will  establish  an \nanticorruption ethics committee and appoint members to the committee. The committee, which \nreports  to  the  managing  director,  is  assigned  to  investigate  corruption  allegations  within \nDWASA.  DWASA  also  will  establish  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  to  address  concerns  of \ncustomers and stakeholders.   \n \nImprove  DWASA  Financial  Management  and  Performance.  With  the  support  of \n33.  \nadvisory technical assistance from the World Bank\u2019s Performance Improvement Program (PIP) \n\n                                                 \n22 On 10 June 2007, the High Court ruled that allowing private operators to carry out the PPI initiative is against the \n\nprovision of WASA Act 1996, and revoked DWASA\u2019s move to outsource the billing and tariff collection.  \n\n23 DWASA.  2007.  Past,  Present  and  Future  of  Dhaka  WASA.  Managing  director  presentation  material;  includes \n\nneeds until 2025.  \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\n\f10 \n \n\n \n\nto DWASA, and Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC)\u2019s support to Chittagong Water \nSupply  and  Sewerage  Authority  (CWASA),  both  WASAs  have  gone  through  a  diagnostic \nanalysis.  The  analyses  focused  on  the  WASAs\u2019  overall  performance  against  the  provisions  of \nthe  1996  Act  and  1963  Ordinance  respectively  to  identify  main  constraints  of  WASA \nmanagement. The financial regulations (1969) still govern the financial transactions of DWASA. \nThe regulations need to be updated for the organization to transform itself into a commercially \nsustainable  entity. 24  Roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  staff  who  are  involved  in  financial \nmanagement  and  transactions  must  be  clearly  defined  with  proper  delegation  of  financial \npowers. During the early to mid-1990s, with the assistance of a World Bank project25, DWASA \nintroduced a computer-based, double-entry accounting system. However, when implementation \nof the World Bank project was terminated, DWASA reverted to the old single-entry, handwriting-\nbased  system.  For  sound  corporate  financial  accounting,  all  assets  should  be  evaluated \nproperly, and an internationally accepted double-entry accounting system must be reintroduced. \nFor the past several years, audit reports produced by DWASA have been unable to attach an \naudit  opinion.  Audits  have  not  followed  internationally  acceptable  accounting  guidelines,  and \ninconsistencies  have  been  observed.  This  needs \nthe \nrecommendations of the World Bank diagnostic analysis. The same applies for CWASA on its \naudit. Based on the improvement in auditing, as well as the introduction and implementation of \nthe  PIP,  DWASA  will  issue  audited  annual  reports  that  will  be  made  publicly  available  in \npreparation for becoming a public limited company in future.   \n \n34. \nReduce  Illegal  Connections  and  Assign  DWASA  Full  Responsibility  in  Water \nConnection  and  Metering  System.  DWASA  will  establish  a  baseline  survey  on  illegal \nconnections by the end of 2009.  Based on the survey, DWASA will issue a time-bound action \nplan  to  address  the  problem  of  illegal  connections.  In  line  with  the  action  plan,  DWASA  will \nreduce illegal connections by at least 25% by the end of 2010 in the four zones of Dhaka city \nthat will be covered by the ADB-supported Project. \n \n\nimproved, \n\nreflecting \n\nto  be \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n3. \n \n35.  \nThe Government has requested a loan of SDR31,843,000 ($50 million equivalent) from \nADB\u2019s  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  to  help  finance  the  Program.  The  loan  will  have  an \namortization  period  of  24  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  with  an  annual  interest \ncharge of 1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. The loan proceeds will be available \nfor  withdrawal  in  two  tranches  of  SDR15,922,000  (first  tranche)  and  SDR15,921,000  (second \ntranche),  ($25  million  equivalent)  upon  compliance  with  the  agreed  upon  conditions.  The  first \ntranche  will  be  released  upon  meeting  all  first  tranche  release  conditions  and  upon  loan \neffectiveness;  the  second  tranche  will  be  released  upon  meeting  the  second  tranche  release \nconditions, as provided in the policy matrix in Appendix 4. \n \nIn determining the amount of the program loan, the following factors were considered: (i) \n36.  \nthe relative importance of urban infrastructure sector in terms of public spending, (ii) the scope \nand  strength  of  the  reform  package  in  the  WSS  sector,  and  (iii)  the  short-  and  medium-term \ncosts  of  the  reforms  and  the  associated  financing  gap.  The  loan  amount  covers  part  of  the \nadjustment costs for the measures included in the policy matrix from FY2007 to FY2013 for the \nprogram loan and its update. \n\n                                                 \n24 CWASA also has been assisted by JBIC on capacity building to improve its financial performance. \n25 World Bank. 1996.

For  the  program  loan,  the  executing \nagencies  (EAs)  will  be  the  Finance  Division  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  and  LGD  of  the \nMinistry  of  Local  Government,  Rural  Development  and  Cooperatives.  DWASA  will  be  the \nImplementing Agency (IA) for certain activities, as specified in the policy matrix. The EAs will be \nresponsible  for  coordination  of  the  program  loan  during  implementation,  including  complying \nwith all policy actions, program administration, and maintenance of all program records.  \n \n38.  \nImplementation Period. The program implementation period is from December 2007 to \nDecember    2013.26 The  Government  will  have  to  complete  all  conditions  for  the  first  tranche \nbefore its release, which is expected by December 2007. The main triggers for the first tranche \nare  (i)  DWASA  organization  chart,  (ii)  Rules  and  Regulation  of  WASA  Act  1996,  and  (iii) \nappointment  of  DWASA  managing  director.  The  remaining  policy  actions  during  the  program \nimplementation  period,  as  well  as  certain  policy  actions,  must  be  fulfilled  before  the  second \ntranche  may  be  released.  Some  of  the  main  triggers  for  the  second  tranche  are  (i)  broader \nadministrative and financial autonomy to WASAs, (ii) separation of water accounts, (iii) DWASA \n5-year  business  plan,  and  (iv)  anticorruption  ethics  committee  within  DWASA.  The  second \ntranche release is expected before 15 December 2010. Details are in Appendix 4. \n \n39.   Procurement and Disbursement. The loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign \nexchange  cost  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB \nmember  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  (Appendix  5)  and  imports  financed  by  other \nbilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of \nDisbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirement  for  Program  Loans,27 the  reimbursement \nprocedure will be used to disburse the loan proceeds based on certification by the Government. \nSupporting import documentation will not be required if, during each year that loan proceeds are \nexpected  to  be  disbursed,  the  total  value  of  the  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember \ncountries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development assistance is \nequal to or greater than the amount of the loan expected to be disbursed during that year. For \nthe  first  tranche,  the  import  certification  may  cover  goods  procured  180  days  before  loan \neffectiveness. With each withdrawal request, the Government will certify its compliance with this \nformula.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing  procedures  will  be  required.  ADB \nreserves the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds.   \n \n40.   Counterpart  Funds. The Government will use the counterpart funds generated by the \nprogram loan, under arrangements satisfactory to ADB, to support sector reform and meet the \nadjustment  costs  associated  with  the  loan.  Further,  the  counterpart  funds  will  be  transferred \nfrom MOF to LGD to meet the costs and counterpart funding requirements for implementing the \nsector reform. \n \n41.   Program  Performance  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  LGD  will  monitor  continually  the \nimplementation of the Program and its impact, in line with the program framework and outcome \nindicators  ADB  and  the  Government  agreed  upon.  Further,  LGD  will  submit  to  ADB  quarterly \nreports  until  the  Program  is  completed.  Data  from  the  PIP,  annual  report,  audit  reports,  and \nauditor\u2019s opinion will be used to monitor the progress of the Program. \n \n\n                                                 \n26 The second tranche disbursement is projected at the end of 2010, but the program loan duration is until the end of \n\n2013 to monitor the reforms progress. \n\n27 ADB. 1998.

The  physical  investment  under  the \nProject  will  be  complemented  by  capacity  building  of  DWASA  to  enable  the  authority  to \ncompetently manage the water supply systems for approximately 12.3 million people in Dhaka \ncity. The Project has three main components: \n \n\n \n\na. \n\nComponent A: Distribution System and Quality Improvement  \n\n \n43.  \nThis  component  of  the  Project  will  involve  physical  rehabilitation  and  optimization  of \nDWASA\u2019s water distribution network to minimize losses and enable 24-hour pressurized water \nsupply, and provision of water quality assurance and control measures. Four zones (zones 3, 4, \n5, and 6) have been selected for priority improvement by the Project for the following reasons: 28 \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nDWASA  has  progressively  rehabilitated  and  replaced  most  of  the  old  pipes \ndating  to  the  19th  century  in  zones  1  and  2  under  various  Government-funded \nprojects.  Further,  despite  their  dense  populations,  zones  1  and  2  have  low  to \nmoderate  pressure  in  the  supply  lines,  resulting  in  less  leakage  than  in  the \nremaining zones. \nDWASA is planning to bring additional water from the proposed Saidabad II and \nKhilkhet water treatment plants (WTP) to meet the growing future demands of the \ncity  (Supplementary  Appendix  A).  The  distribution  network  in  the  project  zones \nwill receive most of the additional water. If the project zones are not rehabilitated, \nthis  water  supply  will  cause  more  leakage  from  the  system  and  minimize  the \nimpacts from the proposed supply augmentation. \nZone  4  has  the  most  \u201cspaghetti  connections\u201d29 with  resulting  leakage.  Similarly, \nzones 3, 5, and 6 reportedly account for more physical losses than zones 1 and \n2.  \nPopulation  growth  in  zones  1  and  2  seems  to  have  reached  saturation  level, \nwhile the population in the remaining four zones continues to increase rapidly.  \nDFID  is  assisting  DWASA  with  improvements  in  many  slum  and  low-income \nareas  of  zones  1  and  2  and  improvement  in  the  project  zones  is  expected  to \nbenefit the largest number of poor and slum dwellers.  \n\n \n\n \n\nThe component consists of the following: \n\n \n44.  \n \n \n \n45.  \nThis  subcomponent  involves  the  following  physical  works  in  the  project  zones:  (i) \nrehabilitation of primary and secondary distribution networks, including lining or replacement of \npipes,  as  required;  (ii)  removal  of  spaghetti  connections,  and  provision  of  tertiary  distribution \nnetwork  (optimization)  and  house  connections;  (iii)  provision  of  additional  supply  lines  to \n\nDistribution Network Rehabilitation and Strengthening  \n\ni.  \n\n                                                 \n28 DWASA  is  responsible  for  seven  zones,  however,  the  seventh  zone  Narayanganj  is  geographically  isolated  from \nother  six,  and  is  outside  the  traditional  Dhaka  City  boundary.  In  early  1990,  Narayanganj  Town  merged  with \nDWASA; however Narayanganj is not part of the Project\u2019s first phase.  \n\n29 Spaghetti  connection  refers  to  illegally  tapped  water  (not  formally  arranged  by  DWASA),  usually  connected  via \n\nrubber lines that look like boiled spaghetti.    \n\n\fidentified fringe and slum areas;30 (iv) rehabilitation of 24 overhead reservoirs, and provision of \n14 new overhead reservoirs; and (v) installation of valves, and bulk and household water meters \nto  isolate  hydraulic  zones  and  allow  measurement  of  supply  and  consumption  at  all  ends.  In \nconducting  the  outlined  activities,  this  subcomponent  also  aims  to  remove  and  regularize  all \nillegal  or  unregistered  connections  within  the  project  zones.  Based  on  market  pricing  and \nviability,  a  significant  portion  of  the  distribution  network  rehabilitation  works  is  expect  to  be \ncarried out using trench-less technologies.  \n \n\nii. \n\nWater Quality and Monitoring System Improvement  \n\n \n\n \n46.  \nThis  subcomponent  involves  provision  and  rehabilitation  of  disinfection  or  chlorination \nfacilities at all supply points in DWASA\u2019s service area in Dhaka city. It also entails establishment \nof a two-tier water quality monitoring system, including provision of water quality monitoring in \nthe inadequate existing laboratory facility.31 \n \n \n \n47.   Component  B  consists  of  the  following  subcomponents:  (i)  institutionalization  of  sound \nfinancial  management,  efficient  billing,  revenue  collection,  and  customer  record  systems;  (ii) \nprovision  of  comprehensive  training  for  all  levels  of  DWASA  staff  to  optimize  operational \nperformance  and  upgrading  of  training  facilities;  and  (iii)  an  extensive  demand  control  and \nawareness campaign for consumers. \n \n\nComponent B: Capacity Building and Institutional Strengthening  \n\nb. \n\n \n\ni. \n\nFinancial Management Improvement \n\n \n48.  \nThe subcomponent will assist DWASA in substantially reforming and improving financial \nmanagement  for  (i)  strategic  business  planning  using  financial  simulation  models,  (ii)  results-\noriented budget mechanisms, (iii) sustainable debt management, (iv) tariff reforms, (v) efficient \nand accurate double-entry accounting system and auditing procedures, (vi) accurate billing and \npayment  collection  through  staff  training  and  establishment  of  customer  database,  and  (vii) \ntransparency  through  compulsory  publication  of  annual  reports.  The  financial  and  capacity \nbuilding (FCB) consultants will assist DWASA in designing the most appropriate and financially \nsustainable  tariff  structure  to  recover  all  costs.  The  tariff  structure  will  be  designed  with  due \nconsideration on affordability of low-income households. \n \n49.   After  the  completion  of  the  pipeline  rehabilitation,  a  management  contract  will  be \nawarded  on  a  pilot  basis  to  a  private  contractor  for  one  of  the  four  project  zones  to  assist \nDWASA  in  operating  the  rehabilitated  assets  during  the  contract  period.  In  addition,  twinning \narrangements  are  considered  with  other  water  utilities  in  south  and  south-east  Asia  operating \nefficiently at a high quality standard, to learn and gain hands-on knowledge transfer from them. \nA technical assistance (TA) project32 has supported the establishment of twinning arrangements \n                                                 \n30 The NGO and CBO sector in Bangladesh is very well developed, and the Project aims to leverage their capacity by \ninvolving them in efforts to increase awareness among the population in Dhaka. At least 15% of the improved water \nsupply flowing through the Project is expected to target low-income communities using standpipes and communal \ntaps.  \n\n31 Currently, the laboratory does not have an analytical environment. The laboratory facilities are lacking basic things, \nsuch as reagents, glassware, working table, distilled water, and proper electrical balance; as well as a computer for \nproper  documentation  and  air  conditioning.  A  superintending  engineer  should  be  appointed  and  designated  as \nlaboratory coordinator.   \n\n32 This  will  be  financed  through  ADB.  2007.  Technical  Assistance  for  Supporting  Water  Operator\u2019s  Partnership  in \nAsia. Manila. TA 6396, approved on 16 April 2007, for $2 million.

The design and management \n(D&M) consultants will support the project management unit (PMU) by identifying key indicators \nand  business  procedures  for  monitoring  DWASA\u2019s  operational  performance,  increasing  water \nsupply  coverage,  establishing  appropriate  service  and  consumption  levels,  and  ensuring \nefficiency  in  operations  and  financial  management,  and  consumer  satisfaction.  Monitoring \nperformance  indicators  will  include  time-bound  target  and  achievement  reporting  (monthly, \nquarterly,  and  annually)  for  the  individual  major  items  of  works  (e.g.,  construction  and \nrehabilitation of pipelines, new connections, repair responsiveness, and bill collection). \n \n\n \n\nii. \n\nTraining and Capacity Building  \n\n \n51.  \nThis  subcomponent  will  involve  developing  training  modules  and  providing  training  to \nDWASA staff for optimized operational performance, as well as to staff of the zone offices (each \nserving about 1.5 million people) to provide all services to the customers as a one-stop service \ncenter. It also will entail capacity building of plumbers, pump operators, and technicians through \nthe  provision  of  training  guidelines,  and  continuation  or  provision  of  plumbers  and  technician \ntraining.33 \n\n \n\nUnder  this  subcomponent,  the  DWASA  training  center  established  under  the  World \n52. \nBank-financed  project34 at  Lalmatia35 will  be  strengthened,  the  physical  facilities  of  the  training \ncenter will be rehabilitated, and training tools will be provided. \n  \n\n \n\n \n\niii. \n\nDemand Control and Public Awareness \n\n \n53. \nA  comprehensive  and  phased  public  awareness  campaign  will  be  designed  with  the \nobjectives of (i) informing the public on the purpose and outline of the proposed tariff reforms; \n(ii) creating awareness that water is a scarce and valuable commodity; (iii) informing the public \nof  possible  service  disruptions  and  measures  undertaken  during  project  implementation;  (iv) \nimproving  public  relations  and  the  image  of  DWASA;  (v)  educating  the  public  on  negative \nconsequences  of  using  suction  pumps,  and  minimizing  wasted  water  at  household  level;  (vi) \noffering incentives to the public on meter installation and meter reading to allow consumers to \nreport  artificial  bill  inflation  from  the  meter  readers;  and  (vii)  informing  the  public  about  the \ncustomer grievance redress mechanism introduced under the Project. \n \nThe  subcomponent  will  address  these  objectives  through  (i)  a  mass  media  campaign, \n54. \nsuch  as  through  television,  radio,  and  cinema,  to  disseminate  and  educate  the  population;  (ii) \nengagement  of  nongovernment  organizations  (NGO)  to  develop  educational  materials,  and  to \nengage  and  coordinate  field-workers  in  conducting  community  meetings  and  household  visits; \nand  (iii)  development  of  information  materials,  such  as  brochures  and  display  boards  before, \nduring, and after rehabilitation work in the supply zones. \n\n                                                 \n33 More than 600 plumbers working for DWASA are being trained as part of the pilot Manikdi study.  \n34 World Bank. 1996.

Consulting services also will include engagement of NGOs to \nmanage parts of the demand control and community awareness program. \n \n56. \nIn addition, consultants will assist DWASA in conducting a feasibility study for an optimal \nlocation  for  a  future  surface  WTP  with  a  capacity  of  500  million  liters  per  day  (mld).  The \nconsultants also will prepare an outline design and prepare tender documents for the WTP. (A \ndetailed project description is in Supplementary Appendix B). \n \n\n2. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n \n57. \nThe  proposed  Program  is  part  of  a  coordinated  partnership  between  external \ndevelopment partners and the Government to reform the urban WSS sector in Bangladesh, with \na focus on Dhaka city, through a medium-term reform and investment program. The proposed \nreforms under the Program are based on the Government\u2019s SDP-WSSB 2006, and have been \nformulated in consultation with the main development partners in the sector, including Danida, \nDFID, JBIC, and World Bank. Each development partner\u2019s activities have been coordinated both \nin  terms  of  reform  actions  and  support  for  investment  loans.  Figure  1  shows  how  the \ndevelopment  partners\u2019  programs  fit  together  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  reforms  and \ninvestment programs for the urban WSS sector. For example, Danida is providing about $130 \nmillion for the construction of Saidabad II WTP and an adjoining small-scale pre-treatment plant. \nDFID is planning to provide sector budget support to LGD. JBIC  has committed  around  \u00a512.2 \nbillion to CWASA for the Karnaphuli WTP and capacity development of CWASA; Government of \nJapan  (JBIC)  plans  to  further  assist  CWASA  in  future  capital  investments  jointly  with  Korea \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency(KOICA),  Government  of  Italy,  and  World  Bank. Government \nof  Korea  will  extend  assistance  to  the  preparation  of  a  master  plan  for  water  supply  and \nwastewater  management  in  Chittagong.  World  Bank  is  planning  to  assist  DWASA  with  its \nsewerage and drainage services improvements with $100 million.   \n \n58.   Unified  Policy  Framework  and  Investment  Road  Map.  In  November  2007,  the \nexternal development partners and the Government signed a partnership framework (Appendix \n3)  outlining  the  partnership  arrangements  and  agree  on  the  urban  WSS  sector  reforms  to  be \ncarried out by the Government, particularly by the LGD, DWASA, and CWASA. The framework \nwill  include  (i)  core  understandings  that  specify  and  outline  the  reforms  to  be  implemented \nurgently;  (ii)  a  unified  policy  framework  for  DWASA  and  CWASA,  which  list  all  reforms  to  be \ncarried out by the Government and two WASAs in 2007\u20132010; and (iii) a brief sector investment \nroad map, which outlines the TA and investment projects planned for Bangladesh in the urban \nWSS sector (Figure 1).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n15\n\n \n\n\f16 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n-DWASA- \nSaidabad II \nWater \nTreatment \nPlant (Phase \nII) \n($130 million) \nApproved \n<2007\u20132012> \n\nFY2007 \n \n \n \nFY2010 \n \n \n \n_______ \n \nFY2011 \nonward \n\nFigure 1: Partnership Framework for the Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Sector \n\nUnified Policy Matrix and Investment Roadmap \n\n \nLGD, DWASA, \nand CWASA \n\n \n\n        \n \n\n \n\n \n\nMOF and Planning \nCommission \n\nTimeline \n\nDANIDA \n\nADB  \n\nJapan  \n\nWorld Bank \n\nGovernment \n\nRepublic of \nKorea  \n-CWASA- \nPreparation of \nMaster Plan \nfor Water \nSupply and \nWastewater \nManagement \nof the \nDetailed \nPlanned Area \nof Chittagong \n($1.5 million \nGrant) \n<2007\u20132008> \n\n-DWASA- \nDhaka \nSewerage \nand Drainage \nProject  \n($100 million) \n \n\n \n\nAllocations to \nsupport Sector \nDevelopment \nProgramme-\nWater and \nSanitation Sector \nin Bangladesh \n \nImplementation \nof reform actions \nunder the Unified \nPolicy Matrix  \n\n \n\n-DWASA- \nDhaka Water \nSupply Sector \nDevelopment\nProgram \n(DWSSDP) \n($200 million) \n \nAdvisory TA \nfor Capacity \nBuilding  \n($2.5 million) \n \nNew \naugmentation \nscheme  \n(to be \nprepared \nunder \nDWSSDP) \n \n\n-DWASA- \nImprovement \nof Storm \nWater \nDrainage \nSystem \n(\u00a5600 million) \n<2007\u20132008> \n \n-CWASA- \nKarnaphuli \nWater Supply \nProject (\u00a512 \nbillion JBIC) \n<2005\u20132011> \n \nTA for \nCapacity \nBuilding and \nReduction of \nNonrevenue \nWater (\u00a5 300 \nmillion JICA) \n \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  CWASA  =  Chittagong  Water  Supply  and  Sewerage  Authority,  DANIDA  =  Danish \nInternational Development Assistance, DWASA = Dhaka Water and Sewerage Authority, DWSSDP = Dhaka Water \nSupply Sector Development Program, JBIC = Japan Bank for International Cooperation, JICA = Japan International \nCooperation Agency, LGD = Local Government Division, SDP-WSSB = Sector Development Programme\u2014Water and \nSanitation Sector in Bangladesh (2006), TA = technical assistance. \nSources:  Government  of  Bangladesh  and  all  participating  donors\u2019  estimates.

Manikdi Pilot Study. To address the serious water supply problems in Dhaka, ascertain \nthe  cause  of  irregular  water  supply,  and  showcase  some  concrete  steps  in  remedying  the \nsituation, ADB conducted a pilot study in Manikdi area (within zone 4 of DWASA\u2019S service area) \nin Dhaka. The main purposes were to change the mindset of DWASA by demonstrating that 24-\nhour  pressurized  supply  is  possible,  and  that  unaccounted-for  water  can  be  reduced  to  an \nacceptable level by addressing the following key issues: (i) accuracy of records; (ii) quality and \ntype  of  materials  (pipes  and  joints)  used;  (iii)  workmanship  traditions;  (iv)  magnitude  of \nunregistered  connections;  (v)  O&M  quality;  (vi)  water  demand  analysis  and  expectations;  and \n(vii) quantification of produced water into four categories: physical losses, where water escapes \nfrom the network through leaks before it reaches customers; administrative losses, where water \nreaches  the  consumer  but  is  not  billed;  water  wasted  by  consumers;  and  water  serving  the \n\n\fdemand of the beneficiary. The pilot study (from March 2006 to December 2007) covered 440 \nservice connections in Manikdi. It confirmed that the high technical losses were due to (i) bad \nservice  connections  and  clamps,  (ii)  poor  quality  pipe  joints,  (iii)  spaghetti  connections  using \npoor quality coil pipes, (iv) invisible leaks in most of pipes and fittings, (v) several connections \nunder  one  registered  connection,  and  (vi)  bypass  line  consumption.  Through  appropriate \ninterventions to address these issues, the Manikdi pilot project reduced the physical losses from \n53%  in  March  2006  to  14%  in  January  2007,  along  with  increasing  water  pressure  and \nimproving meters and meter reading in the pilot area. Similarly, the length of distribution network \npipes increased from 2.5 kilometers (km) to 4.6 km, spaghetti connections reduced from 418 to \nzero,  and  average  hours  of  supply  increased  from  4.8  hours  to  24  hours  in  the  pilot  area.36 \nThrough  the  Manikdi  pilot  study,  some  essential  data  have  been  collected  and  adopted  in  the \ndesign  of  the  Project,  including  (i)  actual  water  demand  at  the  household  level,  (ii)  tariff \ncollection challenges and improvement, (iii) technical improvement options for water leaks, and \n(iv) social mobilization methodology. \n \n60. \nPlumbers\u2019  Training.  During  the  rectification  activities  in  Manikdi,  it  became  clear  that \nmajority  of  the  mistries  (plumbers)  in  Dhaka  have  little  understanding  of  the  required \nmethodologies  and  tools  for  proper  pipe  installation  and  maintenance,  and  that  training  the \nplumbers  in  this  area  is  greatly  needed.  The  Manikdi  pilot  project  trained  more  than  600 \nplumbers working in the DWASA service area to equip them with required skills in installing and \nmaintaining the transmission and distribution networks. Since the Project will need a significant \nnumber of quality plumbers to carry  out the proposed rehabilitation and optimization of supply \npipelines,  as  well  as  to  maintain  the  network  in  future,  having  skilled  plumbers  would  help  to \nensure the successful implementation of the Project.  \n \n61. \nCommunity  Involvement  and  Awareness  Campaign.  Community  sensitization  was \ncarried  out  with  local  social  workers  and  technical  workers  through  public  meetings,  street \nmeetings, and dialogue in individual houses as part of the project preparatory TA. During these \nmeetings the purpose of the Project, need for repairs, benefits of 24-hour supply, and the need \nfor  the  households  to  improve  their  plumbing  system  to  reduce  losses  were  stressed.  All \nhouseholds in the pilot area were trained in reading the water meter, calibrating the meter, and \nunderstanding  the  water  bills.  Such  extensive  community  involvement  through  this  awareness \ncampaign was found to be instrumental in the success of the Manikdi pilot project. As such, this \nhas been included as a core component of the proposed Project. \n \n\n3. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n62. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $212.7  million,  including  taxes  and  duties  of  $16.1 \nmillion (Table 1). The cost estimates are presented in more detail in Appendix 6 (detailed cost \nestimates is in Supplementary Appendix C).  \n\n \n\n                                                 \n36 Details on the Manikdi pilot project are in Supplementary Appendix K. \n\n \n\n17\n\n \n\n\f18 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n \n \nB. \nC. \n\n  \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n\n($ million) \n\n \nBase Costa \nPart A: Distribution System and Quality Improvement \nPart B: Capacity Building and Institutional Strengthening \nPart C: Project Management and Implementation Support \n\nContingenciesb \nFinancing Charges During Implementationc \n\nSubtotal (A) \n\nTotal \n\nAmounts \n\n  \n\n160.4 \n8.3 \n17.1 \n185.8 \n23.2 \n3.7 \n212.7 \n\na  In mid-2007 prices.

The Government will \nfinance  the  balance  of  the  cost,  $62.7  million.  ADB  will  finance  the  costs  of  civil  works, \nmaterials,  equipment,  survey,  safeguard  compliance  support,  training,  consulting  services, \nproject O&M, and financial charges during implementation. The Government counterpart funds \nwill be used for financing taxes and duties, resettlement costs, land acquisition, and part of the \ncivil works. \n \n64. \nThe loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years and an interest \ncharge  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  The \nBorrower  will  be  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh,  and  the  proceeds  will  be  relend  to \nDWASA  through  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement  with  terms  and  conditions  acceptable  to  ADB. \nRelending  terms  will  include  a  repayment  period  of  20  years,  including  a  5-year  grace  period, \nand  interest  of  5%  per  year.  The  Government  will  assume  the  foreign  exchange  risk.

As  the  EA,  DWASA  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall  management,  supervision,  and \nexecution  of  the  Project.  A  PMU  will  be  established  and  will  consist  of  one  full-time  project \ndirector  in  the  rank  of  Deputy  Managing  Director  (DMD)  or  chief  engineer  or  additional  chief \nengineer. In addition, there will be three dedicated deputy project directors. The deputy project \n\n\fdirector  (finance)  will  be  recruited  from  outside  of  DWASA  through  competitive  selection \nprocess. The other two deputy project directors, who will head the technical eastern zone and \nthe  technical  western  zone,  will  be  the  rank  of  the  superintending  engineers  or  above.  The \nproject  director  and  the  three  deputy  project  directors  will  be  appointed  exclusively  to  the \nProject. Four executive engineers will assist the deputy project directors in managing the works \nunder  them.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  all  day-to-day  management  of  the  Project, \nincluding  but  not  limited  to  (i)  preparing  the  overall  project  implementation  plan  and  detailed \nwork program; (ii) providing overall monitoring and guidance on implementation of works under \nthe Project; (iii) tendering and executing all contracts; (iv) monitoring and supervising all project \nmanagement activities; (v) preparing necessary project progress and project completion reports; \nand  (vi)  ensuring  full  compliance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  resettlement,  environmental,  and  other \nsafeguards issues and policies.  \n \n66. \nProject  coordination  units  (PCU)  will  be  established  in  the  four  project  zones,  each \nheaded  by  the  responsible  executive  engineer.  The  PCUs  will  be  responsible  for  liaising  and \ncoordinating  with  the  contractors,  the  D&M  consultants,  NGOs,  and  other  stakeholders  on  all \nday-to-day  implementation  of  project  activities  under  the  concerned  zones.  The  project \nimplementation arrangements are in Appendix 7. To strengthen the PCUs in conducting these \nactivities and addressing their day-to-day O&M  issues, DWASA will assign additional staff, for \nthe project period. \n \nAn inter-ministerial project steering committee (PSC), chaired by the secretary of LGD, \n67. \nwill  be  established \nto  provide  policy  guidance  and  overall  coordination  of  project \nimplementation. Its membership will include the managing director, DWASA; project director of \nPMU;  representatives  from  Dhaka  City  Corporation,  Economic  Relations  Division  and  the \nFinance Division of MOF, Planning Commission; the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation \nDivision,  RAJUK  (the  capital  development  authority);  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Forestry, \nMinistry  of  Housing  and  Works,  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs.  The  PSC  will  hold  its  first  meeting \nwithin  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  and  will  meet  at  least  twice  annually  thereafter,  to \ncoordinate  and  resolve  any  issues  in  project  implementation.  Minutes  of  its  meetings  will  be \nforwarded to ADB for information.  \n \n\n6. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  6  years,  from  January  2008  to  December  2013. \n\n68. \nThe implementation schedule of the Project is in Appendix 8. \n \n\n7. \n\nProcurement  \n\n69. \nProcurement  of  all  goods  and services  to be  financed  under  the  Project  will be  carried \nout in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \nAll civil works contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of $1 million or more will be procured \nthrough international competitive bidding (ICB). Civil works contracts estimated to cost less than \n$1 million will be procured using national competitive bidding (NCB). To the extent practicable, \ngoods will be grouped into procurement packages larger than $500,000 to be suitable for ICB \nprocedures. Goods that cannot be grouped into larger contracts and are estimated to cost less \nthan $500,000 per contract will be procured through national competitive bidding. A third-party, \npre-shipment  inspection  provision  will  be  adopted  to  ensure  quality  of  goods  and  equipment. \nThe  feasibility  of  community  contracting  will  be  examined  on  a  case-by-case  basis  for  slum \nand/or bulk water supply and other community-level works not exceeding $10,000 in value, and \nwill need pre-fact approval by ADB. NCB procedures applicable to the Project are specified in \n\n \n\n19\n\n \n\n\f20 \n \n\n \n\nthe  Government\u2019s  Public  Procurement  Act  2003,  the  Procurement  Plan  (Appendix  9)  and  the \nLoan  Agreement.  Miscellaneous  minor  goods  expected  to  cost  less  than  the  equivalent  of \n$100,000  will  be  purchased  using  shopping  procedures. 37  Any  necessary  modifications  or \nclarifications  to  Government\u2019s  procedures  will  be  recorded  in  the  legal  document.  NCB \npackages valued at more than $100,000 each will be subject to prior review by ADB. The PMU \nwill ensure that procurement complies with the applicable procedures. Specifically, the PMU will \n(i)  determine  bid  packages  and  propose  procurement  methods,  as  approved  by  ADB;  (ii) \nprepare detailed material lists and specifications; and (iii) evaluate bids and award contracts.  \n \n70.  \nThe  PMU  will  update  annually  the  procurement  plan  (Appendix  9),  which  details \nindicative  packages  to  be  funded  under  the  Project,  and  submit  it  to  ADB  for  approval.  The \ncontract  packages,  especially  for  component  A,  have  been  designed  according  to  the  water \nsupply zones, incorporating lessons learned from Manikdi pilot works, as well as past projects \nimplemented by ADB and other external partners in Bangladesh.  \n \n\n8. \n\nConsulting Services  \n\n71.   Consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  under  the  Project  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  An  international \nconsulting  firm  will  be  engaged  as  the  design  and  managing  consultants  (D&M)  (183  person-\nmonths of international and 664 person-months of national experts) following ADB\u2019s quality- and \ncost-based  selection  (QCBS)  procedures.  The  D&M  consultants,  who  will  be  based  in  Dhaka, \nwill  assist  the  PMU  in  managing  the  Project,  preparing  the  detailed  design,  supervising  the \nworks, and ensuring the technical quality of design and construction. The D&M consultants also \nwill  conduct  the  feasibility  study  for  future  water  source  development,  and  will  prepare \npreliminary design and tender documents.38 \n \n72. \nSimilarly,  one  international  consulting  firm  will  be  engaged  as  financial  and  capacity \nbuilding  consultants  (FCB)  (80  person-months  of  international  and  390  person-months  of \nnational  experts) \nfollowing  ADB\u2019s  QCBS  procedures.  For  better  coordination  and \nimplementation,  the  FCB  consultants  will  conduct  and  be  responsible  for  implementing  all \nactivities  outlined  in  component  B  of  the  Project,  in  particular:  (i)  preparing  and  providing \noperational  and  technical  training  to  DWASA  staff;  (ii)  providing  corporate  financial  planning, \nfinancial reforms, and management advisory assistance to DWASA; and (iii) conducting public \nawareness  and  demand  control,  as  well  as  resettlement  implementation  activities.  The  FCB \nconsultants will engage NGOs to manage parts of the demand control, community awareness \nprogram,  and  resettlement  implementation  works  (with  prior  approval  of  ADB).  They  also  may \nengage  professional  media  firms  to  conduct  the  public  outreach  programs  and  media \ncampaigns. ADB will review and approve the terms of such engagements before they begin. An \ninternational consulting firm (6 person-months of international and 36 person-months of national \nexperts)  also  will  be  engaged  under  ADB\u2019s  QCBS  procedures  as  the  project  performance \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  (PPME)  consultants  to  conduct  project  performance  monitoring \n(Appendix 10).  \n \n\n                                                 \n37 Shopping  is  a  procurement  method  based  on  comparing  price  quotations  obtained  from  a  minimum  of  three \nsuppliers  (in  the  case  of  goods)  or  contractors  (in  the  case  of  civil  works)  to  ensure  competitive  prices.  It  is  an \nappropriate  method  for  procuring  readily  available  off-the-shelf  goods  or  standard  specification  commodities  of \nsmall value, or simple civil works of small value.  \n\n38  To  expedite  implementation,  the  Government  requested  advance  action  for  the  recruitment  of  consultants. \nEngagement  of  consultants  is  expected  to  advance  up  to  the  stage  of  technical  proposal  evaluation.  The \nGovernment was informed that approval of advance contracting does not commit ADB to finance the Project.      \n\n\fIn  addition,  a  performance-based  management  contract  (PBMC)  will  be  awarded  to \n73. \nhandle  outsourced  O&M  operations  (under  component  B-1  after  the  rehabilitation  work  is \ncompleted) on a pilot basis for one of the four zones. For the recruitment of the PBMC, ADB\u2019s \nQCBS  procedures  will  be  followed,  possibly  with  fewer  short-listed  bidders  than  the  six \nmandated under ADB\u2019s applicable guidelines, based on experience. Details on the PBMC are in \nAppendix 11.39  \n \n\n9. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements  \n\nDisbursements  of  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \n74. \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  An  imprest  account  will  be \nopened  at  the  Bangladesh  Bank  in  the  name  of  DWASA.  The  account  will  be  established, \nmanaged, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The imprest \naccount ceiling will be 10% of the loan or the forecast expenditure for the next 6 months, which \never is lower. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedures will be used to reimburse, replenish \nand  liquidate  the  imprest  account  for  eligible  expenditures  not  exceeding  $100,000  per \npayment.  \n\n \n10. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n75. \nThe  Government  and  DWASA  will  maintain  records  and  accounts  to  identify  all  goods \nand  services  financed  by  the  loan  proceeds.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  maintaining  the \nrecords,  and  will  submit  annual  accounts  and  financial  statements  to  MOF  and  ADB.  The \nGovernment  will  ensure  that  accounts  and  financial  statements  are  audited  annually,  in \naccordance  with  sound  accounting  principles,  by  independent  external  auditors  acceptable  to \nADB.  DWASA  will  provide  ADB,  not  later  than  6  months  after  the  close  of  each  fiscal  year, \ncertified  copies  of  audited  accounts  and  financial  statements,  as  well  as  the  report  of  the \nauditor. The imprest account and statement of expenditure records will be audited annually and \na separate audit opinion will be provided.  \n \n76.  \nThe  PMU  will  prepare  quarterly  progress  reports  and  submit  them  to  ADB  and  LGD \nwithin  20  days  of  the  end  of  the  applicable  period.  The  reports  will  be  prepared  in  a  format \nacceptable to ADB and will include (i) project progress in each zones and components, (ii) the \nstatus of institutional development activities, (iii) delays and problems encountered and actions \ntaken  to  resolve  them,  (iv)  compliance  with  loan  covenants,  and  (v)  expected  progress  during \nthe next 6 months. Within 6 months of the Project\u2019s physical completion, DWASA  will prepare \nand  submit  to  ADB  through  the  Government  a  project  completion  report,  including  costs  and \ncompliance with loan covenants. \n \n\n11. \n\nAnticorruption Policy and Governance Measures  \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n77. \nwith  the  Government  and  the  EAs.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \n\n                                                 \n39 A  two-stage  procedure  is  proposed.  The  first  stage  will  be  for  the  preparation  of  a  short  list  of  well-qualified \npotential bidders among those who submitted expressions of interest in response to an advertisement. The short-\nlisted  companies  or  consortia  will  then  be  invited  to  submit  second-stage  proposals  containing  detailed  technical \nplans for the improvements to and operation of the water supply and sewerage systems with financial proposals in \nline with the request for proposals documents. More details of the proposed procedures are in Appendix 11. With \nADB  assistance,  the  attached  TA  consultants  will  develop  the  respective  set  of  requests  for  proposals  and  draft \ncontract  documents  for  the  PBM  modes  based  on  lessons  from  global  experiences  with  similar  contracting \napproaches.  \n\n \n\n21\n\n \n\n\f22 \n \n\n \n\nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Program. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Program. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Program shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EAs  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Program.  \n \n78.  \nThe  Project  incorporates  several  other  measures,  in  addition  to  the  standard  ADB \nrequirements, to deter corruption and increase transparency. The Project will (i) build the EA\u2019s \ncapacity  to  comply  with  ADB  and  Government  procedures,  to  be  outlined  in  the  Project \nAdministration  Manual  during  the  early  stage  of  the  implementation;  (ii)  establish  a  project \nwebsite  to  disclose  information  about  project  implementation;  and  (iii)  establish  a  grievance \nredress mechanism to ensure greater accountability. The project website will provide updated, \ndetailed  information  on  project  implementation.  For  example,  the  website  will  include \nprocurement-related  information,  such  as  the  list  of  participating  bidders,  name  of  the  winning \nbidder, basic details on bidding procedures adopted, amount of contract awarded, and the list of \ngoods and/or services procured. The grievance redress mechanism will be set up to receive and \nresolve  complaints,  as  well  as  to  act  upon  stakeholders\u2019  reports  of  irregularities  on  project-\nrelated matters, including grievances concerning resettlement. The EA will widely publicize the \nexistence of this mechanism to ensure that stakeholders are aware that a venue is available to \naddress  concerns  or  grievances  relating  to  fraud,  corruption,  abuse,  and  any  other  aspects  of \nproject implementation. In addition, consultants acceptable to the ADB will undertake an annual \nperformance  audit  on  physical  and  financial  performance  through  the  attached  TA  (Appendix \n12). \n \n\n12. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n79.  \nThe  PMU  will  ensure  that  a  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  (PPME) \nacceptable to ADB is carried out to (i) examine the Project\u2019s technical performance, (ii) evaluate \nthe delivery of planned facilities, (iii) assess the achievement of the project objectives, and (iv) \nmeasure  the  Project\u2019s  social  and  economic  benefits.  The  PMU  and  D&M  consultants,  in \nconsultation with stakeholders and ADB, will develop a set of PPME indicators at the start of the \nProject.  Indicators  might  include  the  number  of  household  water  connections,  the  number  of \nparticipants  in  awareness  campaigns,  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases,  volume  of  water \nproduced, volume of unaccounted-for water, and billing and collection efficiency. \n  \nThe  PMU  will  conduct  baseline  physical  and  socioeconomic  surveys.  It  will  submit  a \n80. \ndetailed  implementation  plan  for  monitoring  performance  and  for  preparing  benchmark \ninformation for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence within 9 months of loan effectiveness. The PMU \nwill  prepare  annual  PPME  reports,  which  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  throughout  project \nimplementation. Monitoring of implementation performance will integrate physical and financial \naspects. During and after project implementation, the PPME consultants will assist the PMU in \nmeasuring the beneficial impacts, and in assessing whether the project facilities are managed \nefficiently and the benefits reach the targeted groups.   \n\n \n13. \n \n\nProject Review \n\n81.   ADB, with the Government and DWASA, will jointly review project progress at least twice \na year. In addition to regular reviews, ADB will undertake a midterm review within 36 months of \nloan  effectiveness.  These  reviews  will  include  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  project  scope, \nimplementation arrangements, and achievement of scheduled targets. Further, they will assess \n\n\fprogress  on  project  implementation  activities,  institutional  development,  and  performance  of \nconsultants and DWASA.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n82.   A TA grant will be provided for advisory assistance to the Government in improving and \nstrengthening  the  management  and  operation  of  urban  water  supply  and  sanitation  services. \nThis  will  include  assistance  to  LGD  and  DWASA  in  preparing  and  implementing  key  policy \nreforms. The TA also will assist DWASA in conducting the necessary technical preparation for, \nintroducing  optimization  measures  in  the  existing  water  supply  sources;  and  in  supporting  the \nsmooth  start-up  of  project  implementation  (Appendix  12  and  details  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix M).   \n \n83. \nFinancing  Plan.  The  total  amount  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $3,125,000.  ADB  will \nfinance  $2,500,000  on  a  grant  basis  from  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  funding  program.  The \nGovernment  will  provide  the  remaining  financing,  equivalent  to  $625,000,  in  terms  of \ncounterpart staff and other support facilities. \n \n84.   Objectives  and  Purpose.  The  objective  of  the  TA  is  to  assist  the  Government  (LGD) \nand  DWASA  in  meeting  the  policy  reforms  being  proposed  under  the  Program,  optimizing  the \nexisting  water  supply  sources,  and  ensuring  smooth  start  of  project  implementation.  The  TA \noutcomes will include (i) increased autonomy of, and strengthened governance of DWASA, (ii) \ndevelopment of a strategic plan for effective demand-side management, (iii) improved financial \nmanagement  capacity  of  DWASA,  (iv)  detailed  analyses  of  and  recommendations  on \norganizational and tariff reforms required by the Program, (v) pilot program to assess the merits \nof trench-less technology in rehabilitation works versus open-trench technology, (vi) preparation \nof  the  performance-based  management  contract  and  the  request  for  proposals  for  one  of  the \nproject  zones  as  outlined  under  subcomponent  B1  of  the  Project,  (vii)  introduction  of \noptimization  measures  in  the  existing  water  supply  sources,  (viii)  studies  to  establish  the \nindependent regulatory entity for the urban water sector, and (ix) a feasibility study of the long-\nterm water supply source augmentation option for Dhaka city from surrounding river(s).  \n \nImplementation  Arrangements.  For  the  TA,  the  EA  will  be  LGD  and  the  IA  will  be \n85.  \nDWASA,  but  the  team  will  be  based  at  the  DWASA  office.  DWASA  will  provide  an  executive \nengineer  or  above  as  the  TA  coordinator  and  three  counterpart  staff  to  work  with  the \nconsultants. ADB will engage a qualified consulting firm and individual consultants (for a total of \n131 person-months) to implement the TA. Additional individual consultants may be recruited as \nnecessary  to  strengthen  the  process.  The  TA  will  be  undertaken  intermittently  over  3  years, \nfrom January 2008 to January 2011. Some of the outputs (including studies, recommendations, \ndraft rules and regulations, draft business plans, and draft operations manual) are expected to \nsupport  LGD,  DWASA,  and  other  key  stakeholders  in  fulfilling  the  policy  actions  under  the \nprogram  and  project  loans.  To  facilitate  implementation,  the  TA  will  use  an  advance  payment \nfacility  for  equipment;  training,  seminars,  and  workshops;  surveys;  and  miscellaneous \nadministration and support costs.  \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nPoverty Reduction and Social Development \n\n86. \nThe project loan is expected to improve the management and operation of DWASA and \nincrease its capacity to serve the population of Dhaka. The socioeconomic survey undertaken \n\n \n\n23\n\n \n\n\f24 \n \n\n \n\nduring project preparation shows that slum households generally are not supplied directly with \nDWASA water. According to the survey, in slum areas (similar to other un-served areas), water \nis supplied through hand tube wells (HTW) (30%), small-scale operators (20%), long-coil pipes \n(20%), and vendors (13%). More than 55% of households in the slum areas reported spending \nTk306, or 6% of their monthly income, on average to treat diarrhea. The Project will bring water \nto  several  poor  neighborhoods  at  the  connection  point.  Beyond  the  connection  point,  other \ndevelopment  partners  (including  DFID)  and  local  NGOs  will  implement  their  programs  to \nconnect  the  poor  to  the  water  supply.  Through  these,  poor households in  DWASA\u2019s  coverage \narea  will  be  provided  with  a  constant  and  pressurized  supply  of  higher-water  quality.  Poverty \nimpact analysis shows that the Project will significantly reduce water costs, water collection time \nfor  women,  and  morbidity  and  associated  health  care  costs.  It  also  will  improve  public  health \nwhere  the  poor  live.  This  will  increase  time  in  productive  and  income-generating  activities. \nProject construction and operation will generate employment opportunities for local people. The \nProject  will  ensure  that  (i)  children  are  not  employed,  (ii)  appropriate  facilities  for  workers  and \ntheir  families  are  provided  at  construction  campsites,  and  (iii)  men  and  women  are  paid  the \nsame amount for work of equal value. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in \nAppendix  13.  The  Project  is  also  expected  to  benefit  women  through,  for  example,  reduced \nburden in water collection, better health, and jobs.40  \n \nB. \n\nSocial and Environment Safeguards \n\n87. \nSocial  Safeguards.  The  Project  is  designed  to  minimize  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  by  (i)  continuing  the  practice  in  Dhaka  of  burying  new  water  pipes  in  roads  and \navoid the need to acquire land, (ii) using trench-less technology where possible in relining pipes \nand installing new pipes to limit the excavation of trenches and reduce disturbance of residents \nand  business,  and  (iii)  locating  new  facilities  (overhead  reservoirs  and  chlorination  units)  on \nvacant government land wherever possible. Anticipated impacts are limited to (i) loss of income \nby  shops  and  other  businesses  if  trenches  and  excavated  soil  make  access  difficult  for \ncustomers, (ii) loss of income by hawkers if they have to move from their normal location, and \n(iii)  loss  of  land  if  some  private  land  has  to  be  acquired  for  some  new  overhead  reservoirs. \nLosses of income are expected in minor roads, because work is allowed on major roads only at \nnight when most businesses are closed to reduce traffic congestion. The overall impacts are to \nbe  minimized  further  through  careful  selection  of  sites  and  alignment  during  detailed  design \nimplementation.  To  ensure  compliance  with  the  policy  and  requirements  on  involuntary \nresettlement of the Government, EA, and ADB, a resettlement framework was prepared based \non \nImmovable  Property \nthe  EA\u2019s \nInvoluntary \nOrdinance(ARIPO),1992 \nResettlement Policy (1995). A summary of the resettlement framework is in Appendix 14 and a \nfull version is in Supplementary Appendix D. Resettlement plans will be prepared for subzones \nbased on the framework. Resettlement plans will ensure that socioeconomic conditions, needs, \nand  priorities  of  vulnerable  groups  are  identified;  and  that  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \ndoes not disadvantage vulnerable groups. A short resettlement plan was prepared for a sample \nsubzone (Supplementary Appendix E).  \n \nDuring  program  development  and  design,  no  impact  on  indigenous  peoples  were \n88. \nidentified.  The  Program  will  result  in  environmental  and  public  health  benefits  to  the  whole \nprogram population. The likelihood the Program affecting indigenous peoples is small. Any likely \n\nof \nframework,  and  ADB\u2019s \n\nnational  Acquisition \n\nresettlement  policy \n\nand  Requisition \n\nthe \n\n                                                 \n40  The  gender  action  plan,  which  ensures  that  gender  issues  are  addressed,  women  benefit  equally  from  the \n\nDWSSDP, and interventions avoid gender bias, is in Supplementary Appendix J.  \n\n\fimpacts  are  addressed  by  resettlement  plans.  Further,  no  permanent  land  acquisition  is \nenvisaged.  \n \n89. \nEnvironmental  Safeguards. The Program is designed to maximize environmental and \npublic health benefits. The Initial Environmental Examination (IEE: summarized in Appendix 15 \nwith the full IEE in Supplementary Appendix F) and the environmental assessment of the policy \nmatrix  (Supplementary  Appendix  G)  conducted  for  the  Program  show  that  net  environmental \nbenefits are positive and large. The main beneficiaries of the improved network are Dhaka City \nresidents, who will be provided with a constant and pressurized supply of higher-quality water, \nwhich serves a large proportion of the population. This will improve the quality of life and raise \nstandards  of  individual  and  public  health  as  improvements  in  hygiene  reduce  diseases  from \npoor sanitation. It also will result in social benefits from reduced time spent on water collection, \nincreased  time  for  productive  and  income-generating  activities,  and  reduce  expenditures  on \nhealth care due to waterborne diseases. \n \n90. \nDuring  program  development,  measures  were  included  in  program  design  to  mitigate \npotential negative environmental impacts. These included (i) adopting trench-less technology to \nthe  extent  possible  to  reduce  excavation  and  disturbances  to  residents  and  businesses,  (ii) \ncontinuing  the  practice  of  burying  water  distribution  pipelines  within  roads  and  locating  new \nfacilities on vacant government-owned land to avoid land acquisition, and (iii) prohibiting the use \nof asbestos cement pipes to avoid potential health risks from inhalation of asbestos fibers. The \nremaining  negative  impacts  relate  to  construction  and  O&M,  whose  potential  impacts  on  the \nphysical  environment  and  people  will  be  mitigated  by  a  range  of  identified  measures.  These \ninclude  (i)  reducing  waste  disposal  by  finding  beneficial  uses  for  waste  soil  and  stone,  (ii) \nreducing  dust  by  covering  soil  and  sand  when  stored  on  site  or  carried  on  trucks,  and  (iii) \nplanning  work  to  minimize  disruption  on  traffic  and  communities.  The  IEE  identified \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  procedures  to  ensure  that  the  implementation  of  the \nsubcomponents  comply  with  the  Government  and  ADB  environmental  guidelines  and \nrequirements in the design and implementation of the Program. \n \nC. \n \n\nEconomic and Financial Analysis \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Analysis  \n\n \n91. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated for the project loan and some \ncost  implications  of  the  policy  actions.  The  overall  EIRR  is  16.7%,  which  exceeds  the \nopportunity  cost  of  capital  of  12%  per  year.  The  EIRR  also  were  subjected  to  a  sensitivity \nanalysis of key variables. The key variables tested were (i) a 20% increase in capital costs, (ii) \n20%  underachievement  in  water  quality  improvement,  (iii)  20%  underachievement  in  water \npressure  increase.  Sensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  the  EIRR  for  the  project  loan  is  robust \nunder most conditions. The detailed economic evaluation and sensitivity analysis are available \n(Supplementary Appendix H). \n \n \n \n92.   Using  financial  management  assessment  questionnaires,  interviews  and  financial \nmanagement assessments were undertaken during the project preparatory TA to evaluate the \nEA\u2019s ability to undertake and fulfill ADB\u2019s fiduciary requirements for the project components. The \nEA\u2019s financial management needs to be strengthened, and will be acceptable with support from \ncorporate  financial  planning  and  management  consultants.  Project  implementation  delays  will \n\nFinancial Management \n\n2. \n\n \n\n25\n\n \n\n\f26 \n \n\n \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Sustainability  \n\nbe minimized through extensive support from project management and design and supervision \nconsultants, who will be familiar with ADB procedures and requirements. \n \n \n \n93.  \nFinancial  projections  were  prepared  for  DWASA  based  on  the  financial  action \nimprovement  plan.  Financial  projections  also  assume  better  cash  flow  management,  including \nimproved user charge collection efficiency to be achieved under the Project and the Program. \nFrom FY2018, DWASA is expected to fully recover its costs. \n \n94.  \nFinancial variability of the project loan was assessed in real terms using constant 2006 \nprices. The project cost estimates and financial projections in nominal terms were converted to \nreal terms by adjusting for the projected effects of foreign and domestic inflation and currency \nfluctuations. Incremental costs and benefits were derived by evaluating the financial position of \nthe EAs under with- and without-project scenarios. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR), \ncomputed on an after-tax basis, was 3.99%. This compares favorably with the weighted average \ncost of capital, also computed on an after-tax basis, of 2.33% on an aggregate basis. All parts of \nthe  project  loan  are  considered  financially  viable  and  sustainable.  Sensitivity  and  risk  analysis \nindicates  that  the  FIRR  is  sensitive  to  delays  in  each  item  of  the  implementation  of  financial \nimprovement action plan. Detailed financial analysis is available (Supplementary Appendix I).  \n \nD.  \n \n95. \nRehabilitation of the existing pipeline, the major component of the Project, carries risks. \nAlthough  DWASA  maintains  digital  maps  of  its  pipelines  and  has  general  ideas  of  where \nprevalent  illegal  and  poor  connections  might  be,  the  real  extent  only  emerges  at  the  time  of \nexcavation. Though the Project is based on conservative assumptions, the required works and \ncosts to rehabilitate and optimize the system might exceed the original estimate.  This risk will \nbe mitigated by careful preparatory works based on lessons learned from the pilot scheme, and \nsubstantial engineering consulting support to DWASA during project implementation. \n \n96. \nDespite  firm  commitment  of  the  Government,  resistance  to  the  reforms  program  might \narise from outside and within (for example, from unions). Tariff adjustment may face opposition, \nundermining  political  support  to  the  reform.  The  reforms  program  is  underpinned  by  the \nPartnership  Framework  between  the  Government  and  major  development  partners  to  support \nthe  Government  initiative  in  a  coherent  manner.  To  minimize  the  social  impact  and  sustain \nbroad public support) frequent dialogue with other ministries addressing wastewater and water \nresources  management,  the  tariff  adjustment  will  be  carried  out  gradually  with  careful \naffordability  study  and  communication  programs  with  involvement  of  community-based \norganizations (CBOs) and NGOs. \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS  \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n97. \nthe following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government, LGD, and DWASA have given \n\n\f98. \n \n\n99. \n \n\nFor the program and investment Loan: \n\nThe Government will promptly adopt the policies and take the actions as specified in the \npolicy letter and the policy matrix, and ensure that such policies and actions continue in \neffect during and after the DWSSDP period. \n \nFor the investment loan: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  Government  will  provide  counterpart  funds  for  project  implementation  on \ntime.

The \nGovernment will ensure that any adverse environmental impacts arising from the \nconstruction, operation, and implementation of project facilities will be minimized \nby  implementing  the  environmental  mitigation  and  management  measures,  and \nother  recommendations  specified \nIEE.  The  Government  will  ensure \nenvironmental  requirements  will  be  incorporated  in  bidding  documents  and  civil \nworks contracts. \n\nin \n\n(x) \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  Although  the  Project  does  not  envisage  any  adverse  impact  on  indigenous \npeoples,  the  Government  and  DWASA  will  ensure  the  Project  will  be  prepared \nand  implemented  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples \n(1998). \nTo  ensure  that  women  benefit  equally  from  the  Project  and  interventions  avoid \ngender  bias,  the  Government  and  DWASA  will  ensure  that  the  Project  will  be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998) \nand  the  gender  action  plan  that  has  been  prepared  and  agreed  upon  by  the \nGovernment and ADB. \nThe Government and DWASA will ensure that the civil works contractors comply \nwith all applicable labor, health,  and safety laws and regulations of Bangladesh \nand, in particular, (a) do not employ child labor for construction and maintenance \nactivities,  and  (b)  provide  appropriate  facilities  (latrines,  etc.)  for  workers  at \nconstruction  sites.  The  Government  will  require  contractors  not  to  differentiate \nwages  between  men  and  women  for  work  of  equal  value.  The  Government  will \nensure  that  specific  clauses  will  be  included  in  bidding  documents  to  ensure \nadherence  to  these  provisions,  and  that  compliance  will  be  strictly  monitored \nduring project implementation. \nThe Government and DWASA will ensure that financial management capacity of \nDWASA  is  maintained,  strengthened  with  qualified  staff  with  proper  education \nand job experience, and allow those staff to actively attend training and enhance \ntheir capacity. \n\n(xi) \n\n(xii)  Within 9 months from the effective date, the DWASA will conduct initial baseline \nphysical and socioeconomic surveys and submit a detailed implementation plan \nfor monitoring performance and for preparing  benchmark information, which will \nbe  submitted \nfor  review  and  concurrence.  Throughout  project \nimplementation  period,  DWASA  will  prepare  annual  PPME  reports  and  submit \nthem to ADB.  \n\nto  ADB, \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\n \nB.  \n \n100.

The urban population is \ngrowing  about  2.5%  annually,  nearly  double  the  national  growth  rate  of  1.3%.  More  than  half  of \nurban population is concentrated in Dhaka and three other metropolitan areas\u2014Chittagong, Khulna, \nand  Rajshahi.  Urban  services  in  the  towns  and  cities  are  generally  deficient  and  the  quality  of \nservice  is  poor.  Inadequate  urban  services,  including  water  supply  and  sanitation,  is  a  severe \nhindrance  to  the  continued  development  of  urban  areas,  as  well  as  to  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to \nreduce poverty and improve economic growth in the country.  \n \n2. \nIn most towns, groundwater is the source of the municipal piped water supply as well as the \nprivate  water  supply.  About  5%  of  the  country\u2019s  population  receives  water  from  stand  posts,  15% \nfrom  public  tube  wells,  60%  from  shallow  tube  wells,  and  less  than  20%  from  their  own  house \nconnection  for  municipal  piped  water  supply.  Of  the  309  pourashavas  (peri-urban  town),  only  102 \nhave  municipal  piped  water  supply.  Water  supply  operation  in  the  pourashavas  generally  is \ncharacterized  by  (i)  limited  service  hours,  (ii)  average  unaccounted-for  water  of  33\u201340%,  (iii)  low \nbilling and collection rates, and (iv) inadequate tariffs. Further, because of the intermittent supply of \nelectricity, pumps generally run for only 10\u201312 hours per day, and piped water supply is available to \nconsumers  usually  for  2\u20134  hours  per  day.  Urban  water  quality  is  extremely  poor.  Arsenic  and \nbacteriological  contamination  from  water  sources  in  various  regions  of  the  country  is  posing  a \nserious  public  health  risk.  Rehabilitation  of  the  existing  systems  in  parallel  with  investment  in \nprovision  of  supply  infrastructure,  such  as  water  treatment  plants  and  development  of  surface \nsources,  is  urgently  needed  in  most  towns  and  cities.  In  most  areas,  depletion  of  groundwater \nresources is also a grave concern, as often observed by the rapid fall of water levels during the dry \nseason below what can be reached with hand pumps. \n \n3. \nUrban  sanitation  is  a  major  challenge  since  26%  of  urban  households  still  do  not  have \naccess to latrines or another form of hygienic sanitation. Sewerage systems are absent in all urban \nareas  except  Dhaka,  where  20%  of  the  population  is  served  by  an  expensive  sewer  network. \nInadequate  drainage  in  most  of  the  urban  centers  aggravates  this  situation  by  adding  to  potential \ncontamination/pollution of drinking water supply. Similarly, only 20% of the households in the urban \nareas have access to a solid waste collection system.  \n \n4. \nUrban  water  supply  and  sanitation  (WSS)  services  are  carried  out  by  water  supply  and \nsewerage  authorities  (WASAs)  in  Dhaka  and  Chittagong,  city  corporations,  and  pourashava  water \nsupply  sections  (PWSSs).  The  Department  of  Public  Health  Engineering  (DPHE)  implements  new \nwater supply systems and carries out major rehabilitation programs except in the areas managed by \nthe WASAs. After completion of the works, DPHE hands over the WSS systems to local government \ninstitutions  (LGIs)  to  handle  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M).  In  reality,  the  local  DPHE  offices \nalso assist the PWSSs with O&M if necessary and possible.  \n \n5. \nThe  semiautonomous  Dhaka  Water  Supply  and  Sewerage  Authority  (DWASA)  and \nChittagong Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (CWASA) were created under the East Pakistan \nOrdinance  of  1963.  DWASA  is  responsible  for  the  provision,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  water \nsupply, sanitation, and storm water disposal services to the population of Dhaka city, as stipulated in \nthe Water Supply and Sewerage Authority Act, 1996. In 2005, the population of Dhaka city within the \nDhaka Metropolitan Area (DMA) was estimated at 11 million, including 8.6 million within the DWASA \nservice area. DWASA provides an estimated 7.7 million people with water, which is nearly 90% of \nthe people living in the DWASA service area. The remaining 10% are served mostly by private wells \nabstracting water from the same aquifer under the city. Though the number of employees in DWASA \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                         Appendix 2        35 \n\nis high (17 per 1,000 connections), each connection serves approximately 4\u20135 households, or more \nthan 30 people on average.  \n \n6. \nPopulation  of  Dhaka  city  is  growing  extremely  rapidly.  Based  on  a  detailed  analysis  of \navailable census data and current land use patterns, the population living within the DWASA service \narea is projected to increase to 21.63 million1 by 2025, while an additional 4.4 million will be living \noutside  the  DWASA  service  area  but  within  the  DMA.  A  sizeable  percentage  of  people  in  the \nDWASA service area live in slums (estimates vary from 15% to 60%). A survey carried out during \nthe  program  preparation  showed  that  the  majority  of  the  people  living  in  slums  are  indirectly \nreceiving  water  from  DWASA.  However,  most  of  vulnerable  slum  dwellers  still  do  not  benefit  from \nDWASA  services  due  to  statutory  restrictions.  However,  the  Government  recently  approved  a \nguideline for Dhaka Water Supply (April 2006)2 that states DWASA is allowed to extend basic WSS \nservices  to  slums  within  its  service  areas,  providing  legal  connection  and  introducing  formal  billing \nand collections. \n \n7. \nGroundwater accounts for 82% of water supplied by DWASA. The water is obtained mainly \nfrom production tube wells drilled to a depth less than 200 meters below ground. The remaining 18% \nof DWASA\u2019s water is supplied from surface sources after being treated at Saidabad water treatment \nplant  (WTP),  which  is  producing  225  mld  (million  liter  per  day)  of  water.3  Extensive  investigations \nhave  found  that,  although  arsenic  contamination  of  groundwater  is  widespread  in  the  country, \narsenic  levels  in  the  groundwater  of  Dhaka  are  low  and  within  permissible  limits.  Groundwater \navailability is influenced by seasonal variations resulting from recharge in the upstream catchments. \nEffectively, all wells in Dhaka have shown a steady decline in the water table, with some at 65\u201370 \nmeters below surface level. The lower groundwater tables already are causing well failures. \n \nWhile the projected future demand of areas covered by DWASA varies between 2,450 mld \n8. \nand  3,100  mld4  in  2025,  DWASA\u2019s  current  production  level  is  1,570  mld.  DWASA  has  carried  out \nvarious  studies  and  detailed  modeling  over  the  years,  which  clearly  indicate  that  little  further \nabstraction from the groundwater resources is sustainable.5 Therefore, Dhaka is expected to face a \nsevere supply shortage by 2015 unless it implements a sustainable supply augmentation plan. \n \n9. \nThe distribution system, consisting of approximately 2500 kilometer (km) of primary \nand  secondary  pipes,  has  been  developed  on  a  piecemeal  basis  over  the  past  two  decades. \nCurrently, distribution system losses are estimated at about 40% based on the project preparatory \nTA  consultants  report.6  To  save  the  highly  valued  resources,  supply  higher-quality  water,  and \nprepare  for  any  future  injection  of  additional  water,  the  system  needs  rehabilitation  to  minimize \nlosses.  \n \nB. \n \n10. \nInadequate Decentralization and Local Governance. In practice, local governments have \nnot  been  strengthened  adequately  for  them  to  respond  sufficiently  to  local  urban  services  needs. \nThis  is  largely  the  result  of  the  concentration  of  urban  administrative  authority  in  the  office  of  the \npourashava  chairperson.  Further  delegation  of  power  from  the  pourashava  chairpersons  to  the \n\nInstitutional, Governance, and Financial Constraints for the Sector \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for Preparing the Dhaka Water Supply Project. TA \n\n4651 PPTA Final Report. Manila. \n\n2  DWASA. 2006, Guidelines for Water Supply in Dhaka City. Dhaka (official circular, 18 April). \n3  The WTP was constructed under the World Bank-funded Fourth Dhaka Water Supply Project.  \n4  See Supplementary Appendix A: Sector Road Map for details. \n5  Based on the steady decline in water table at most wells, more than 40% of the production tube wells are expected to be \n\nout of service within the next decade.  \n\n6  The actual losses from the system is a subject of is much debate. The pilot project in Manikdi found more than 60% of \n\nthe water supplied is lost for a variety of reasons. \n\n \n\n\f \n36 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nelected  commissioners  and  the  citizen  groups  will  be  required  to  foster  greater  accountability  of \nelected  officials  to  local  residents.  Most  of  the  government  institutions  involved  in  urban \ndevelopment  and  service  provision  at  the  national  and  local  levels  desperately  need  adequate \nresources,  facilities,  and  operational  capacities  to  undertake  satisfactory  planning,  coordination, \nimplementation,  enforcement,  regulation,  and  monitoring  tasks  and  responsibilities.  Capacity \nbuilding  and  training  of  staff,  as  well  as  increasing  the  manpower,  in  pourashavas  is  required  to \ncomplement  capital  investments  in  urban  development  to  ensure  sustainability  and  maximize \neconomic  benefits,  especially  in  the  implementation  of  urban  development  programs  for  urban \ncenters.  \n \n11. \nInstitutional  and  Financing  Weaknesses.  The  pourashavas  suffer  from  a  range  of  staff, \ntraining,  equipment,  and  organizational  constraints,  as  well  as  weak  capacity  of  elected \ncommissioners,  local  public  officials,  and  community  groups.  These  factors  undermine  the \nmanagement  of  municipal  affairs.  Improvements  are  required  to  enhance  the  awareness  and \nparticipation of local stakeholders in urban planning and management (e.g., citizen awareness and \nparticipation,  women\u2019s  participation,  and  integration  of  the  urban  poor),  and  then  to  improve \naccountability  and  transparency  (financial  accountability  and  sustainability,  and  administrative \ntransparency)  in  the  management  of  local  governments.  Insufficient  finance  is  a  key  reason  for \ninadequate  infrastructure  and  services.  As  long  as  municipalities  remain  heavily  dependent  on  the  \nGovernment for much of their revenues, they will not have an adequate incentive to assume greater \nfinancial  responsibility.  In  addition  to  augmenting  local  government  authority  to  mobilize  revenues, \nimproving the financial management practices at the pourashava and city corporation levels must be \nprioritized. Property tax is the most important source of local revenue, but the collection efficiency is \nvery  low.  Government  agencies  also  add  to  the  collection  problem  by  defaulting  on  their  tax \npayments. On the expenditure side, there is a chronic shortage of funds for O&M of existing assets, \nas  well  as  long-term  financing  to  meet  capital  expenditure  responsibilities.  Financial  management \nalso  warrants  improvement  at  the  pourashava  and  city  corporation  level.  A  relatively  low  level  of \nbudgeting and accounting skills at all levels is a major obstacle to improving employee productivity \nand expenditure effectiveness.  \n \n12. \nLack  of  Regulatory  Framework.  To  ensure  better  service  standards,  governance,  and \ninstitutional  environment,  a  regulatory  entity  is  urgently  needed.  Policy  making,  regulation,  and \nservice  delivery  functions  must  be  clearly  separated  with  each  assigned  to  a  different  entity.  For \ninstance,  while  the  central  Government  departments  are  responsible  for  policy  development,  WSS \nutilities  should  be  given  full  responsibility  and  autonomy  to  provide  water  and  sanitation  services, \nand  the  municipalities  should  own  the  assets. Meanwhile,  the  water  supply  regulatory  commission \nshould  be  responsible  for  regulating,  fixing  applicable  service  standards,  setting  tariffs,  monitoring \nutility  performance,  and  enforcing  compliance.  Such  a  regulatory  body  is  also  necessary  to  set \nstandards  and  foster  private  sector  involvement,  the  lack  of  which  has  contributed  to  institutional \nweaknesses at the national and at pourashava level.  \n \nInstitutional,  Governance,  and  Financial  Management  Issues  in  DWASA.  DWASA \n13. \noperates within the provisions of the Water Supply and Sewerage Authority Act 1996. According to \nthe act, DWASA should be able to manage its facilities and operate with a high degree of autonomy. \nHowever, an essential provision of the act is that when Government financing is being provided to \nDWASA,  or  when  Government  is  providing  guarantee  for  finance,  all  information  relating  to  the \nconcerned scheme will have to be submitted to the Government for approval. Thus, the autonomy of \nDWASA  in  practice  is  constrained  by  its  financial  dependence  on  the  Government.  Consequently, \ndecisions on almost all day-to-day management issues, such as human resource development, staff \nhiring and firing, setting of tariffs, staff salaries, have to be sent to the Government for approval. In \naddition, there are many pending issues with the Government, such as the approval of the rules and \nregulations  and  the  organogram  (organization  chart),  under  the  1996  Act,  which  hinder  DWASA\u2019s \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                         Appendix 2        37 \n\ninstitutional,  operational,  and  managerial  efficiency  and  autonomy.  Furthermore,  the  roles  and \nresponsibilities of the management and the board are not clearly delineated. \n \n14. \nThe  organizational  performance  of  the  administrative  and  financial  departments,  including \nrecording  of  consumption  and  billing  is  weak  and  lacks  computerized  systems  for  transparent  and \naccurate  data  processing.  Moreover,  the  current  O&M  practices,  particularly  allowing  unskilled \npersons  (private  household  owners  and  their  plumbers)  to  access  the  network,  cause  serious \ndamage to the system and increase system losses. \n \nHuman  resource  management  within  DWASA  suffers  from  (i)  lack  of  an  effective \n15. \nperformance-based human resource development plan whereby active steps are taken to enhance \nthe  overall  performance  of  the  authority;  (ii)  lack  of  continuity  in  management  positions  due  to \nfrequent changes and absences of the managing director and deputy managing directors; (iii) a lack \nof incentive schemes to attract more qualified staff to key positions; (iv) recruitment that is not based \non functional requirements; (v) political and bureaucratic interference in the recruitment process; (vi) \nvacancies in key positions; and (vii) top-down management structure, stifling initiative and personal \ndevelopment.   \n \n16.  Management  of  DWASA  is  also  constrained  by  the  unusual  roles  of  labor  unions  and \nemployees\u2019  cooperative  societies.  Billing  and  revenue  collection  functions  in  three  of  the  six  water \nsupply  zones  of  Dhaka,  comprising  approximately  half  the  population  and  service  connections  of \nDWASA  service  area,  have  been  outsourced  to  DWASA  Employees  Consumer  Supplies  Co-\noperative  Society  through  a  program  for  performance  improvement  (PPI)  agreement.  The  PPI \nagreements  are  performance  based,  and  the  employers  working  under  the  PPI  agreements  also \nbenefit from bonus arrangements. The billing efficiency of the PPI zones are generally higher than \nthe DWASA zones. However, splitting responsibilities between DWASA staff and PPI staff is unclear \nand unpractical in many areas. For instance, DWASA is responsible for controlling of unaccounted-\nfor-water UFW, while the PPI identifies and disconnects illegal connections. DWASA handles meter \nmaintenance,  while  the  PPI  does  the  meter  reading.  Frequently,  functioning  meters  are  lacking  at \nthe  service  connection, and  inadequate  records  and  mapping  leave  the  revenue  inspectors  as  the \nonly  people  who  can  identify  the  right  bill  to  the  right  connection.  As  a  result,  billing  is  up  to  the \nrevenue  inspector,  or  what  agreements  the  revenue  inspector  makes  with  the  beneficiaries.  Such \nexperiences have shown that the PPI arrangement is creating vested interests within DWASA and  \nconflict  of  interests  that  should  be  changed.  Further,  no  efficient  mechanisms  are  in  use  to  make \ndefaulters pay their bills. According to an ADB PPTA study (footnote 1), 60% of the water produced \nis  billed,  but  only  62%  of  the  bills  are  paid.  Thus,  only  37%  of  the  water  produced  is  paid  for. \nHowever, according to DWASA\u2019s monitoring and information system (MIS) report of June 2007, the \ncumulative  collection  rate  for  the  six  zones  is  97.28%.  However,  this  figure  is  based  against  the \n\u201cbilling\u201d  target,  not  necessarily  counting  all  households  tapping  water  from  DWASA.  The  DWASA \nMIS figure needs further examination, as some zones are achieving higher than 100% collection.  \n \nDWASA\u2019s  organizational  structure  was  modified  during  the  World  Bank-supported  Fourth \n17. \nDhaka Water Supply Project. 7 While DWASA\u2019s board comprised members from the civil society, the \ntop  management  was  redesigned  to  comprise  an  independently  recruited  managing  director  and \nthree  deputy  managing  directors.  However,  the  organization  is  still  top  heavy,  where  little  is  done \nwithout approval of the top management, the managing director, and even to the board and ministry. \nThere  are  no  incentives  for  the  staff  to  take  full  responsibility  of  their  work  and  perform  better. \nAlthough  the  number  of  employees  is  high  in  DWASA  (about  3,500  staff,  or  17  per  1,000 \nconnections),  each  connection  serves  approximately  4\u20135  households,  or  more  than  30  people  on \naverage.  Apart  from  the  head  office,  where  the  entire  management,  chief  engineer,  and  all \nsuperintending  engineers  are  located,  six  zone  offices  have  been  established  for  operational \n\n                                                 \n7 World Bank. 1996.

Each  zone  office\u2014or  management,  operation,  and  development  system  (MODS)\u2014is \njointly headed by an executive engineer on the technical side and a revenue officer on the financial \nside. The joint and unclear management, and the three management levels between the executive \nengineer and the managing director, makes the MODS weak and inefficient. \n \nC. \n \n18. \nEight  national  policies  and  strategies  govern  the  WSS  sector.  The  National  Policy  for  Safe \nWater  Supply  &  Sanitation  (1998)  is  the  most  significant  policy  for  the  sector.  It  emphasizes  user \nparticipation,  decentralization  to  the  LGIs  and  community-based  organizations  (CBOs),  and \ninvolvement  of  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and  the  private  sector  in  WSS  service \ndelivery.  Subsequently,  the  Sector  Development  Framework  (2004),  National  Sanitation  Strategy \n(2005),  and  Pro-Poor  Strategy  (2005)  were  formulated  to  further  define  and  complement  the  1998 \nWSS policy. The National Policy of Arsenic Mitigation (2004) was formulated specifically to address \nthe widespread arsenic contamination of groundwater. On the other hand, the National Water Policy \n(1998)  and  the  National  Water  Management  Plan  (2004)  give  broad  direction  for  water  resources \nmanagement.  \n \n19. \nRecently,  the  Government  has  included  improvement  of  WSS  as  part  of  its  seven-point \nstrategic  agenda  for  reducing  poverty  in  its  poverty  reduction  strategy  2005.8  The  strategy \nrecognizes  the  importance  of  water  and  sanitation  as  a  means  of  achieving  accelerated  poverty \nreduction in the country. Poverty and rapid population growth, combined with having to rely on open \nponds  for  drinking  water  and  poor  sanitary  habits,  contributed  to  a  high  level  of  water-related \nmorbidity  and  mortality  in  the  1960s  and  1970s  in  Bangladesh.  Introduction  of  safe  drinking  water \nthrough  tube  wells,  higher  sanitation  coverage,  and  improved  primary  health  care  contributed  to \nhalving of the mortality rate\u2014caused by diarrheal diseases\u2014from 300,000 deaths per year in 1980 \nto 150,000 in 1997. The 2005 strategy aims to reduce poverty by 30%, extreme poverty by 5%, and \nchild mortality to 31 per 1,000 live births by 2015. Water-related diseases continue to account for the \nmajority of deaths of infants and children under 5 years old in the country. Further, the Government \nhas  committed  to  achieving  the  Millennium  Development  Goals,  including  reducing  by  half  the \nproportion of people without sustainable access to safe water supply and sanitation, by 2015. \n \n20. \nThe Government\u2019s goals, and the priority accorded the provision of safe drinking water and \nappropriate  sanitation,  are  consolidated  in  its  new  Sector  Development  Program\u2014Water  and \nSanitation Sector in Bangladesh (SDP-WSSB), which was approved in January 2006.9 The SDP for \nthe WSS sector assembled all the relevant national and international policies, strategies, and targets \nand drew up a 10-year framework for development and cooperation in the sector. The preparation of \nthe SDP-WSSB is a result of a sequential development of WSS policies and strategies over a long \nperiod. The most important ones are (i) National Policy for Safe Water Supply & Sanitation 1998; (ii) \nsector  development  framework,  2004;  (iii)  Pro-Poor  Strategy,  2005;  and  (iv)  National  Policy  for \nArsenic Mitigation, 2004.  \n  \n21. \nThe  sector  development  framework  has  suggested  optimistic  targets  and  time  scale  for \nimplementation of the WSS sector improvements. It aims for 100% coverage of basic water supply \nand sanitation services in towns and rural areas during 2005\u20132015. The coverage target for piped \nwater  supply  in  the  urban  areas  is  70%  by  2010  and  90%  by  2015.  While  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals set the target of halving the percentage of people without safe water and basic \nsanitation  by  2015,  the  Government  has  set  a  more  ambitious  target,  in  the  case  of  sanitation,  of \n100% coverage by 2010.  \n\n                                                 \n8 Government of Bangladesh. 2005.

The \nmanagement  contractor  will  be  a  company  or  consortium  of  companies  that  will  be  responsible  for \nproviding advisory services in managing the operations of one of the project zones. The management \ncontractor will have to bear much more risk than a  typical consultant, because the contractor\u2019s total \nremuneration  will  depend  on  its  success  in  improving  the  delivery  of  services  provided  by  DWASA. \nBecause of the limited number of private contractors with the required expertise and possible limited \ninterest  due  to  the  high  costs  of  preparing  a  competitive  proposal,  the  short  list  may  not  meet  the \nrequirements of six firms as mandated by ADB\u2019s guidelines. \n\n2. \nTo  come  up  with  a  short  list  of  qualified  companies  and/or  consortia,  the  criteria  for  short-\nlisting will include (i) a set of criteria to identify companies and/or consortia that have the necessary \npractical operating experience to be able to execute the contract successfully; and (ii) a summary of \nthe experience and skills of the companies and/or consortia, with brief responses to a list of questions \nthat  focus  on  how  they  have  addressed  or  would  address  problems  similar  to  those  the  DWASA \nwould face in improving service provision. An evaluation committee would consider private contractors \nmeeting these criteria for short-listing based on expressions of interest received. \n  \nB. \n\nOutline Terms of Reference \n\n3. \nThe  management  contract  will  have  two  key  features.  First,  it  will  have  a  3-year  tenure \n(typically),  with  remuneration  consisting  of  a  fixed  fee  and  performance-based  incentive  payments. \nSecond,  the  contract  will  have  a  limited  number  of  easily  measurable  key  performance  indicators, \nwhose  baseline  levels  will  be  determined  during  the  first  year  of  operations,  and  to  which \nperformance-based  payments  will  be  linked.  ADB  anticipates  that  the  management  contractor  will \nbring in a limited number of expatriate staff, and that its management team will likely include several \nBangladesh nationals. \n\n4. \nThe  management  contractor  will  be  responsible  for  managing  the  operation,  as  well  as  the \nsystems and services, for the concerned project zone. The tasks of the management contractor will \ninclude: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nimproving  the  midterm  performance  and  efficiency  of  services,  and  expanding  their \ncoverage in the DWASA\u2019s service area; \nenhancing  the  delivery  of  services  to  the  poor  through  a  targeted  program  of \nconnections and service improvements in low-income communities; \nupgrading  the  operation  and  management  of  water  and  wastewater  systems  through \nvarious  means,  such  as  more  efficient  revenue  collection, \nimplementation  of \ncomputerized billing and accounting, introduction of management information systems, \nimproved  customer  service,  improved  occupational  safety  practices,  and  reduced \nleaks; \nassisting  and  advising  DWASA  in  relation  to  strategic  planning,  budget  preparation, \nand other operational and system optimization issues; \nimproving  the  effectiveness  of  the DWASA\u2019s  human  resources  through  a  coordinated \ncapacity building program; and \nresolving customer complaints and measuring customer satisfaction. \n\n\f       Appendix 12      63       \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nMANAGEMENT SUPPORT FOR DHAKA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE AUTHORITY \n \n\nImpact and Output \n\n1. \nA technical assistance (TA) grant will be attached to provide advice to the Government \nof  Bangladesh1  on  improving  and  strengthening  organizational,  regulatory,  and  financial \nsustainability of its urban water and sanitation service utilities.

Based on the 2001 census, the population in the Dhaka megacity was 10.7 million, and \ncurrent estimates place the population at 13 million. Based on the World Food Program\u2019s poverty estimates, more than \n1  million  in  Dhaka  are  poor  (8%).  The  urban  poor  live  mainly  in  slum  areas.  Various  agencies  estimate  the  slum \npopulation differently\u2014the Bureau of Statistics places the 2005 slum population at 1.2 million and the Dhaka Transport \nCoordination  Board  Survey  estimates  population  density  in  the  slums  at  250,000  per  square  kilometer,  or  six  times \nmore  dense  than  the  rest  of  Dhaka.  The  socioeconomic  survey  conducted  during  preparation  of  the  Dhaka  Water \nSupply  Sector  Development  Program  (DWSSDP)  shows  that  70%  of  the  slum  population  is  poor.  The  survey  also \nindicates that the poor live in fringe areas and pockets within Dhaka4 as well as in slum areas. Of Dhaka\u2019s population, \nabout 10 million are within the Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (DWASA) service area.  \n \nInadequate  urban  services,  including  water  and  sanitation,  are  a  severe  hindrance  to  the  continued  development  of \nurban areas, as well as efforts to reduce severe poverty. In most urban areas of Bangladesh, piped water depends on \ndeep tube wells. Due to high electricity costs, pumps run only for 10\u201312 hours per day, and piped water is available to \nconsumers for only 2\u20134 hours daily. Those not covered by piped water often depend on unreliable, unsafe, and more \nexpensive alternative sources. Waterborne diseases continue to account for the majority of deaths among infants and \nchildren under 5 years old. The Government of Bangladesh, as identified in its 2005 poverty reduction strategy paper, \nemphasizes supplying safe water and providing sanitation services to reduce health costs, decrease malnutrition, and \nincrease labor productivity. Based on the Government\u2019s 2006 Guideline for Dhaka Water Supply, DWASA is allowed to \nextend  basic  water  supply  and  sanitation  services  to  slums  within  its  service  areas,  providing  legal  connection  and \nintroducing formal billing and collection. The DWSSDP is expected to improve the management and  operation of the \nmunicipal water supply service of Dhaka, and increase its capacity to serve the future population. DWSSDP will bring \npoor households under DWASA water supply coverage by providing additional supply lines to identified fringe and slum \nareas.  It  will  provide  a  constant  and  pressurized  supply  of  higher-water  quality,  of  which  15%  is  estimated  to  benefit \nlow-income  communities  using  standpipes  and  communal  taps.  Poverty  impact  analysis  shows  that  the  Program  will \nsignificantly reduce water costs, water collection time for women, and morbidity and associated health care costs; and \nimprove public health where the poor live. This will increase time in productive and income-generating activities.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n\nPoverty Classification: General intervention \n\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n\n \n\n \nA socioeconomic survey was conducted during DWSSDP preparation covering 3,017 households from the slum areas, \n945 households from pocket areas, and 1,057 households from fringe areas to supplement previous surveys, namely: \nthe Asian Development Bank\u2019s Dhaka Water Services Survey (October 2005) and Pilot Testing of Zonal Approach in \nManikdi Area of Dhaka City (November 2005). The survey was undertaken in six zones of DWASA. A poverty profile, \ngenerated from these surveys and secondary data, shows that the main causes of poverty are (i) differences in human \nresources,  including  literacy,  knowledge,  and  skills;  (ii)  uneven  distribution  of  physical  assets,  including  housing \nstructures, equipment, and implements; (iii) increased vulnerability due to certain demographic characteristics, such as \nhouseholds that headed by females; and (iv) frequent movement and changes in shelter due to natural disasters, such \nas floods and man-made hazards including eviction.  \n \n\n                                                 \n3  2004.

Dhaka. \n\n \n\n\f68      Appendix 13 \n\nSlum  households  generally  are  not  supplied  directly  with  DWASA  water.  According  to  the  socioeconomic  survey,  in \nslum areas (and unserved areas), water is supplied through hand tube wells, small-scale operators, long-coil pipes, and \nvendors.  The  survey  noted  that  90%  of  slum  dwellers  reported  that  they  have  used  DWASA-owned  water  through \nillegal  channels.  Due  to  difficulties  in  obtaining  water  and  inadequate  sanitation,  morbidity  rates  are  high.  The \nprevalence  of  diarrhea  is  widespread  among  children  under  5  years  old  in  poor  communities  compared  with  the \nnonpoor  ones.  In  the  slum  areas,  more  than  55%  of  households  reported  spending  Tk306,  or  6%  of  their  monthly \nincome on average, to treat diarrhea. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nConsultations were undertaken with stakeholders, including consumers and Dhaka residents, policy makers (ministers), \nlocal  government  departments,  DWASA  board  members,  DWASA  management,  DWASA  staff,  zone  water  supply \noffices, union members, DWASA enlisted contractors, academicians, media, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), \nand  the  private  sector.  Different  stakeholders  were  consulted  to  ensure  their  involvement  in  DWSSDP  development \nand  design.  Stakeholder  workshops  were  conducted  to  share  the  findings  of  stakeholder  interviews  and  solicit  views \nfrom  workshop  participants.  At  the  field  level,  focus  group  discussions  were  held  with  women  and  men  to  provide \ngender perspectives. Various water-related issues were identified by stakeholders through key informant interviews to \nobtain views, issues, and priorities on water supply, and to seek suggestions provided by stakeholders.  \n\nIs there a participation strategy? \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No \n\n \nDWSSDP development and design were conducted in a highly participatory fashion involving several stakeholders. The \nstrategy for community consultation and participation was successfully demonstrated through the Manikdi pilot project \n(Supplementary  Appendix  K),  and  will  continue  to  be  applied  in  the  Project.  Formation  of  community  groups  will  be \nfacilitated  by  NGOs  and  where  appropriate  CBOs  to  mobilize  communities  for  participation  in  the  Project.  Extensive \nworkshops,  door-to-door  information  and  awareness  campaigns  through  various  media  mechanisms,  and  community \nmeetings  will  be  organized  to  raise  the  awareness  and  educate  the  communities  on  issues,  such  as  tariff  reforms, \nminimizing  wasted  water,  meter  reading  and  billing  systems,  and  the  establishment  of  a  consumer  satisfaction  and \ngrievance  mechanism.  Where  appropriate,  operations  and  maintenance  responsibilities,  including  tariff  collection,  will \nbe delegated to community-based organizations.   \n \nD.  Gender Development \n\nStrategy to maximize beneficial impacts on women: \n \nTo maximize DWSSDP impacts on women, a gender action plan was developed focusing on the different experiences \nof men and women regarding water. The gender differences (especially in unserved and poor areas of Dhaka) related \nto carrying and using water has been identified through quantitative and qualitative studies. The lack of access to piped \nwater  supply  affects  women  more  than  men.  In  the  pilot  area,  women  are  water  managers  who  take  major \nresponsibility  in  supplying  water  to  their  families.  The  pilot  intervention  showed  women  to  be  aware  and  keen  to \ncontribute  to  DWSSDP  (e.g.,  in  operations  and  maintenance).  When  forming  community  groups,  the  inclusion  of \nwomen  will  be  ensured.  Involving  women  in  mobilizing  communities  is  also  part  of  DWSSDP  design.  Women  will  be \ninvolved in assisting the community group in identifying the vulnerable, particularly single-earner households headed by \nwomen.  Mobilization  and  organization  of  women  at  the  formulation  and  implementation  stages  will  help  sustain  their \ninvolvement. Women also will be involved in locating the sites for construction of community and domestic water points, \nreading water meters, and other water-related issues. Monitoring and evaluation systems will support the generation of \ngender-disaggregated information to enable the tracking of DWSSDP\u2019s gender impacts. \n\nHas an output been prepared? \n \nA  gender  action  plan  that  ensures  that  gender  issues  are  addressed,  women  benefit  equally  from  the  Program,  and \ninterventions  avoid  gender  bias  has  been  developed.  NGOs  will  be  involved  in  identifying  vulnerable  households, \nparticularly single-earner households headed by women. Special attention will be given to capacity building of DWASA \nstaff  on  gender  sensitization,  particularly  when  working  with  women  in  community  groups,  and  involving  them  in \ncommunity water point management and monitoring activities.  \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fE.

Infrastructure  improvements  will  be \nconducted  within  four  zones  and  20  hydraulic  subzones,  and  will  be  designed  in  2008  and \nconstructed  in  2009\u20132013.  Work  will  include  repairing  the  existing  network  and  extending  the \nsupply into new areas, and rehabilitating network facilities. DWSSDP also will build the capacity \nof the Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (DWASA) and raise public awareness. \n \nDWSSDP  development  includes  design  actions  to  minimize  land  acquisition  and \n2. \nresettlement  by  (i)  continuing  the  practice  in  Dhaka  of  burying  new  water  pipes  in  roads  and \nroad  rights-of-way  to  avoid  acquiring  land,  (ii)  using  trench-less  technology  where  possible  in \nrelining  pipes  and  installing  new  pipes  to  limit  the  excavation  of  trenches  and  reduce \ndisturbance of residents and business, and (iii) locating new facilities (overhead reservoirs and \nchlorination units) on vacant government land where possible.  \n \n3. \nAnticipated  impacts  are  limited  to  (i)  loss  of  income  by  shops  and  other  businesses  if \ntrenches and excavated soil make access difficult for customers, (ii) loss of income by hawkers \nif they have to move from there normal locations, and (iii) loss of land if some private land has to \nbe acquired for some new overhead reservoirs. Losses of income are expected only on minor \nroads, because work is allowed only on major roads at night when most businesses are closed \nto  reduce  traffic  congestion.5 The  overall  impacts  are  to  be  minimized  further  through  careful \nselection of sites and alignment during detailed design. A short resettlement plan was prepared \nfor a sample subzone (Supplementary Appendix e). \n \nB. \n\nResettlement Framework and Policy \n\n4. \nThis  summary  provides  highlights  of  the  resettlement  framework  in  Supplementary \nAppendix  D.  The  framework  outlines  the  objectives,  policy  principles,  and  procedures  through \nwhich DWASA will provide affected persons with compensation and other assistance to mitigate \nimpacts.  The  framework  is  based  on  the  national  law  The  Acquisition  and  Requisition  of \nImmovable  Property  Ordinance,  1992;  the  resettlement  policy  framework  of  the  Executing \nAgency  (EA);  and  the  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB). The framework compares these documents and addresses gaps. \n \n5. \nDWSSDP will be based on the following general involuntary resettlement principles: (i) \naction  will  be  taken  during  development  and  design  to  avoid  land  acquisition,  relocation,  and \nother resettlement effects where possible; (ii) where these effects cannot be avoided, sufficient \ncompensation will be provided to affected persons to restore their quality of life and livelihoods \nto at least pre-project levels; (iii) the law of Bangladesh applies where relevant, but where no \napplicable  law  is  available  or  there  is  a  gap  between  ADB  policy,  the  resettlement framework \nwill  be  followed;  (iv)  compensation  amounts  will  be  based  on  current  replacement  value  of \nassets or the amount of income lost, as appropriate; (v) additional assistance will be provided to \n\n                                                 \n5  The extent of these impacts was estimated by transect walks along 18 kilometers of minor roads, which represent \n6.7% of the roads likely to be affected. Results indicate that, although impacts are relatively minor, DWSSDP can \naffect many people and premises because of the size of Dhaka. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n     Appendix 14      71      \n\n(MODS)  zones, \n\nProcedure for Resettlement Plan Preparation and Institutional Arrangements \n\nvulnerable6 affected persons to help improve their economic and social status; (vi) the absence \nof formal title to land is not a bar to obtaining resettlement assistance; (vii) compensation and \nother assistance will be provided before the loss is incurred; (viii) damage to common property \nresources, such as mosques, schools, and hospitals, will be avoided, and temporary structures \nwill be provided to maintain access; (ix) important cultural and religious sites, and landmarks of \nhistorical  or  environmental  value  (such  as  buildings  and  large  trees)  will  be  left  intact,  and \nconserved and protected; and (x) the cutoff date for compensation entitlement is the date of the \ndetailed  measurement  survey  (DMS)  to  identify  entitled  persons  and  record  their  losses\u2014\ncompensation will not be paid for any development made on affected land after this date. The \nresettlement  framework  further  details  principles  for  (i)  permanent  impacts,  (ii)  temporary \nimpacts, and (iii) institutional arrangements. The entitlement matrix for DWSSDP, based on the \nthese principles, is in Table A14.1. \n \nC. \n \n6. \nThe infrastructure work will be tendered in construction packages relating to 20 hydraulic \nsubzones, and contractors may be awarded work in one or more subzones. DWASA will set up \nto  manage  DWSSDP  centrally.  The  six  DWASA \na  project  management  unit  (PMU) \nadministrative \nlocal \nimplementation  and  engage  civil  society.  Resettlement  issues  will  be  coordinated  by  a \nresettlement  specialist  appointed  to  the  PMU,  who  will  prepare  resettlement  plans  for  each \nhydraulic  subzone,  following  the  procedures  established  by  the  resettlement  framework.  The \nspecialists will also coordinate allocations of compensation and other entitlements, which will be \ndistributed by personnel from a local nongovernment organization (NGO) appointed to assist the \nMODS. Most resettlement activities will be conducted by the resettlement specialists or by the \nNGO  working  with  the  MODS.  Supervision  and  approval  will  be  by  the  PMU  project  director \ncentrally  and  zone-level  coordination  committees,  set  up  as  independent  local  monitoring \nagencies.  Further  details  on  roles  and  responsibilities  for  resettlement  plan  activities  are  in \nTable A14.2.  \n \n7. \nThe PMU will appoint design and management consultants to design the infrastructure, \nmanage  tendering  of  contractors,  and  supervise  the  construction  process.  The  resettlement \nframework principles will be followed in preparing designs and construction contracts, meaning \naction will be taken to avoid resettlement impacts where possible. The resettlement plans also \nwill  follow  these  policies,  and  resettlement  impacts  that  do  occur  will  addressed  as  in  the \nentitlement  matrix.  This  should  ensure  that  the  DWSSDP  does  not  disadvantage  anyone, \nespecially  the  vulnerable,  and  that  the  quality  of  life  of  affected  persons  is  improved  where \npossible. \n \nD. \n\nthrough  project  coordination  units,  will  manage \n\nConsultation, Disclosure, and Grievance Redress \n\n8. \nStakeholders  were  involved  in  preparing  the  resettlement  framework  and  sample \nresettlement plan through face-to-face interviews on site (448 participants), five workshops (131 \nparticipants)  to  discuss  the  draft  DWSSDP  (including  draft  framework),  and  a  pilot  public \nmeeting (30 participants) in one of the hydraulic areas. Disclosure was achieved by presenting \nmaterial at the meetings and distributing a summary documents in Bangla at meetings and with \nnewspapers.  DWASA  will  employ  an  experienced  NGO  to  expand  this  process  during  the \nimplementation  stage  via  media  campaigns,  public  meetings,  stakeholder  workshops,  and \n\n                                                 \n6  Vulnerable  groups  are  those  without  legal  title  to  land  or  other  assets,  households  headed  by  single-earner \n\nfemales, the elderly or disabled, indigenous peoples, and households with incomes below the poverty line. \n\n \n\n\f72        Appendix 14 \n\ndiscussions  with  affected  persons  on  resettlement  impacts  and  entitlements.  Draft  and  final \nresettlement  plans  will  be  disclosed  on  DWASA  and  ADB  websites,  and  hard  copies  will  be \nmade available at zone offices.  \n \n\nTable A14.1: Entitlement Matrix

\npossible, conducting negotiations and \nsigning agreements openly in public. \n\u2022  Negotiations would be monitored by a \ncommittee set up by the project to \nrepresent affected persons (zone-level \ncoordination committee). \n\n\u2022  If a parcel of land cannot be obtained by \nthis method, an alternative site will be \nsought. \n\n\u2022  If no suitable alternative exists, land will \n\nbe acquired by the established \nprocedures of the Acquisition and \nRequisition of Immovable Property \nOrdinance, 1982. \n\n\u2022  DWASA will commission an independent \nsurvey to establish the market value of \nthe land. \n\n\u2022  If the sale price negotiated by DWASA or \nestablished by the DC is less than the \nreplacement value, according to the \nsurvey, the project will pay a top-up \namount equivalent to the shortfall. \n\u2022  The normal income of businesses and \n\nhawkers will be determined by a detailed \nmeasurement survey (DMS) \ncommissioned by DWASA. \n\n\u2022  The period of disruption will be assumed \nto be 5 days, based on experience from \nthe 4th Dhaka Water Supply Project \n(World Bank, 1999\u20132002), where this \nwas the average period of construction at \nnetwork sites. \n\n\u2022  Construction contracts will require \n\ncontractors to provide planks and metal \nsheets where necessary to allow access \nacross trenches by

This \ninvolves resolution of complaints, if possible by discussion between the PMU, affected person, \nzone-level  coordination committee  plus  construction  contractor,  if  necessary.  If  a  case  cannot \nbe  resolved,  it  is  presented  to  a  grievance  resolution  committee,  chaired  by  the  PMU  project \ndirector, with two other members, one a respected local figure and the other from a local NGO \nor  community-based  organization  (CBO).  The  grievance  resolution  committee  meets  as  often \nas necessary and has 14 days to reach a decision, after which an affected person may present \nhis case again once on appeal.  \n \nE. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n\n10. \nThe  DWASA  environment  cell  will conduct  internal  monitoring  of  resettlement  following \nnormal  practice  established  in  the  DWASA  resettlement  plan  framework  (RPF).  The  Program \nwill provide the environment cell with training and the support of the PMU resettlement specialist \nto  enable  them  to  fulfill  this  role.  Aspects  monitored  will  include:  management,  budget  and \nprogram; delivery of affected person entitlements; consultation and grievance; and benefits and \nimpacts. Consultant or an NGO also will be engaged as an independent monitoring agency to \nreport  to  the  EA  and  ADB  throughout  the  DWSSDP  on  provision  of  entitlements  and  their \neffects,  as  well  as  the  adequacy  of  resettlement  policies,  staff,  structures,  and  the  overall \nprocess. This will include compliance monitoring and social impact evaluations. \n \nF. \n \n11. \nThe  PMU  will  prepare  detailed  budget  estimates  for  involuntary  resettlement  for  each \nresettlement  plan.

Infrastructure  improvements  will  be \nconducted  within  four  zone  and  20  hydraulic  subzones,  and  will  be  designed  in  2008  and \nconstructed  in  2009\u20132013.  Work  will  include  repair  of  the  existing  network  and  extending  the \nsupply  into  new  areas,  and  rehabilitation  of  network  facilities.  DWSSDP  also  will  build  the \ncapacity  of  the  Dhaka  Water  Supply  and  Sewerage  Authority  (DWASA)  and  raise  public \nawareness. An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  prepared  to  assess the  impacts  of \nproject loan activities (Supplementary Appendix F). The impacts of program loan activities were \nreviewed  through  an  assessment  of  the  policy  matrix  (Supplementary  Appendix  G).  The  IEE \nwas  based  on  field  surveys,  secondary  information,  and  discussions  with  stakeholders.  The \nsalient points from the IEEs are summarized in the following. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nDWSSDP  is  designed  to  maximize  environmental  and  public  health  benefits.  The  IEE \nconducted for DWSSDP shows that net environmental benefits are positive and large. The main \nbeneficiaries  of  the  improved  network  are  Dhaka  city  residents,  who  will  be  provided  with  a \nconstant and pressurized supply of higher-water quality, which serves a large proportion of the \npopulation. This will improve quality of life and raise standards of individual and public health, as \nimprovements  in  hygiene  reduce  diseases  from  poor  sanitation.  It  also  will  result  in  social \nbenefits from reduced time spent on water collection, increased time for productive and income-\ngenerating activities, and reduced expenditures on health care due to waterborne diseases.  \n \n3. \nDuring  program  development,  measures  were  included  in  program  design  to  mitigate \npotential negative environmental impacts. These included (i) adopting trench-less technology to \nthe  extent  possible  to  reduce  excavation  and  disturbance  of  residents  and  businesses;  (ii) \ncontinuing  the  practice  of  burying  water  distribution  pipelines  within  roads  and  locating  new \nfacilities on vacant government-owned land to avoid land acquisition; and (iii) prohibiting the use \nof asbestos cement pipes to avoid potential health risks from inhalation of asbestos fibers. The \nremaining  negative  impacts  relate  to  construction,  and  operations  and  maintenance  whose \npotential  impacts  on  the  physical  environment  and  people  will  be  mitigated  by  a  range  of \nidentified  measures.  These  include  (i)  reducing  waste  disposal  by  finding  beneficial  uses  for \nwaste soil and stone, (ii) reducing dust by covering soil and sand when stored on site or carried \non  trucks,  and  (iii)  planning  work  to  minimize  disruption  on  traffic  and  communities.  Potential \nnegative impacts and mitigation measures are summarized in Table A15. \n \n\nTable A15: Potential Adverse Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\nPotential Negative Impact \n\nMitigation Activities and Method \n\n \n\nConstruction: Network Improvements \nExcavation of pipeline trenches will produce \nlarge amounts of waste soil and stone \n\nWaste  soil  (and  sand  for  trench  infilling) \ncould create dust \n\nRoadside \nremoved \n\ntrees  may  be  damaged  or \n\n \nFind beneficial uses for waste soil in construction, land raising and \ninfilling of excavated areas \nDeliver suitable material to sites agreed by DWASA/DCC  \nRemove waste soil for disposal as soon as it is excavated \nPlan work to only bring sand to site when needed \nCover or spray soil to reduce dust in windy weather \nCover soil and sand with tarpaulins when carried on trucks \nOnly remove trees if it cannot be avoided \nPlant and maintain two trees for every one removed \n\n \n\nShops  and  other  businesses  may  lose  Leave spaces for access between mounds of soil \n\n\f76 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nPotential Negative Impact \nincome  if  customers\u2019  access  is  impeded  by \ntrenches, soil, etc. \n\ncould \n\ndamage \n\nExcavation \ninfrastructure \nTraffic  will  be  disrupted  by  trenches,  soil, \nvehicles  and  machinery,  and  some  roads \nmay need to be closed \n\nexisting \n\nTraffic,  people  and  activities  could  be \ndisrupted  by  trucks  carrying  waste  soil  or \ndelivering sand or other materials \nResidents  may  experience  noise,  dust, \nimpeded  access;  and  sleep  may  be \ndisturbed by work conducted at night \n\nSocially  and  culturally  important  buildings \nand  their  users  may  be  disturbed  by  noise, \ndust and impeded access \n\nPeople  will  be  inconvenienced  and  their \nhealth may be at risk if water supply system \nis shut down for long periods \n\nWorkers  and  the  public  are  at  risk  from \naccidents on site \n\nThere are approximately 20 km of AC pipes \nin \nthe  existing  water  supply  system; \nasbestos  can  be  carcinogenic  if  inhaled  as \ndust particles \n\nif \n\nlocal  people  are \n\nEconomic  benefits \nemployed in Contractor\u2019s workforce  \nConstruction: Facilities and Structures \nIt  may  be  necessary  to  acquire  some \nprivate land for some of the new Ors \n\n \n\nMitigation Activities and Method \nProvide  walkways  and  metal  sheets  to  maintain  access  across \ntrenches for people and vehicles where required \nIncrease workforce in these areas to finish work quickly \nConsult businesspeople: inform them of work in advance \nCompensate businesses for lost incomea \nCheck location of infrastructure and avoid these sites \n\nPlan work with DCC and Dhaka Police to avoid disruption \nIf work requires road closure, conduct when traffic is light \nEnsure police provide road diversions when needed \nEnsure warning signs are used and traffic is policed if any work is \nconducted in roads when used by traffic \nPlan routes to avoid narrow streets and congested roads \nPlan waste transportation to avoid peak traffic periods \n\nAs  above:  remove  waste  quickly,  cover/spray  stockpiles,  import \nsand only when needed, cover soil/sand on trucks \nAs above: increase workforce to finish work quickly \nAs above: use bridges to allow access (people/vehicles)  \nUse modern vehicles/machinery and maintain as specified \nUse directional, shaded, down-facing lighting at night \nAs  above:  remove  waste  quickly,  cover/spray  stockpiles,  import \nsand only when needed, cover soil/sand on trucks \nAs above: increase workforce to finish work quickly \nAs above: use bridges to allow access (people/vehicles)  \nAs above: use and maintain modern vehicles/machinery \nConsult  relevant  authorities,  custodians  of  buildings,  local  people \nto address issues and avoid work at sensitive times \nPlan work carefully to keep shutdown to minimum \nProvide alternative potable water to affected residents \nInform communities of any shutdown well in advance \nPrepare and implement a site Health and Safety Plan that includes \nmeasures to: \n- Exclude the public from all construction sites \n- Ensure that workers use personal protective equipment \n- Provide Health and Safety Training for all personnel \n- Follow documented procedures for all site activities  \n- Keep accident reports and records \nEnsure that designs involve no removal or disturbance of AC pipes \nDevelop  and  apply  protocol  to  protect  workers  and  public  if  AC \npipes are encountered.

Initial Environmental Examination. Dhaka. \n Full Initial Environmental Examination (Supplementary Appendix F) \nC. \n \nAs  the  Executing  Agency  (EA),  DWASA  is  responsible  for  the  management  and \n4. \ntechnical supervision of DWSSDP, and will carry out mitigation assigned to them as part of their \nmanagement  function.  DWASA  is  also  the  Implementing  Agency  (IA)  responsible  for \nsupervising infrastructure construction and conducting the non-infrastructure elements, and will \nestablish  a  project  management  unit  (PMU)  for  this  purpose.  The  PMU  will  be  supported  by \ndesign  and  management  consultants,  who  will  design  the  infrastructure,  manage  tendering  of \ncontractors,  and  supervise  construction.  Their  contract  will  require  the  consultants  to  include \nmitigation  measures  in  designs  where  appropriate,  and  to  specify  other  measures  in \nconstruction contracts.  \n \n5. \nThe four DWASA administrative (MODS) zones, through project coordination units, will \ncoordinate activities at the local level and engage civil society. The EA will appoint construction \ncontractors  to  build  the  infrastructure  in  one  or  more  of  the  20  hydraulic  areas.  Each \nconstruction contractors will be supervised by the Design and Managing Consultants. When the \ninfrastructure  is  completed,  operation  will  remain  the  responsibility  of  DWASA,  which  will \nemploy  local  operations  and  maintenance  contractors  to  conduct  maintenance  and  repairs  as \nrequired. \n \n6. \nAn  interministerial  project  steering  committee  will  provide  DWASA  with  central  policy \nguidance and coordination. Zone-level coordination committees will monitor implementation at \nthe local level and will report to the project steering committee. \n \n7. \nEnvironmental issues will be coordinated by an environment specialist in the PMU, who \nwill prepare environmental assessment documents (Initial environmental examination [IEEs] or \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  [EIAs])  consistent  with  the  environmental  assessment  and \n\n \n\n\f78 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nimplement \n\nPublic Consultation and Disclosure \n\nlaw.  An  environmental  monitoring  specialist  will \n\nreview  framework  for  work  in  each  hydraulic  zone,  as  required  by  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) policy, and will assist DWASA in obtaining environmental clearance for the program, as \nrequired  by  national \nthe \nenvironmental  monitoring  plan.  This  will  involve  observations  and  surveys  throughout \nconstruction to ensure that mitigation measures are provided, and to protect the environment as \nintended.  The  PMU  also  will  appoint  consultants  to  monitor  the  long-term  impacts  of  the \ninfrastructure,  which  involves  data  collection  during  construction  (to  show  existing  conditions) \nand in each of the first 5 years of operation.  \n \nD. \n \nStakeholders1 were involved in developing the IEE through (i) face-to-face interviews on \n8. \nsite  (448  participants)  in  July\u2013August  2006,  (ii)  five  workshops  (131  participants)  on  the  draft \nfinal  report  in  October  2006,  and  (iii)  a  pilot  public  meeting  (30  participants)  in  one  of  the \nhydraulic areas in April 2007. Information also was disclosed to the wider public by circulating a \nBangla language pamphlet with newspapers. Views expressed were incorporated into the IEE, \nas well as the planning and development DWSSDP. The IEE will be made available at public \nlocations  in  Dhaka  and  will  be  disclosed  to  a  wider  audience  through  the  ADB  and  DWASA \nwebsites. Consultation will be continued and expanded during DWSSDP implementation, when \nDWASA  will  appoint  a  nationally  recognized  nongovernment  organization  to  handle  this  key \nelement to ensure that stakeholders participate fully in DWSSDP execution. \n \nE. \n\nFindings, Recommendations, and Conclusion \n\n9. \nThe  IEE  recommends  the  implementation  of  (i)  all  mitigation,  compensation,  and \nenhancements  proposed  in  the  IEE  and  resettlement  planning  documents;  and  (ii)  the \nenvironmental monitoring plan described in the IEE and the monitoring proposed in resettlement \nplanning  documents.  The  IEE  shows  that  if  recommendations  outlined  in  the  appendix  are \nimplemented  in  full,  the  location,  design,  construction,  and  operation  of  DWSSDP  will  not \nproduce any significant negative environmental impacts.  \n \n10. \nDuring  the  detailed  design  stage,  IEEs  will  be  required  to  identify  and  mitigate  the \nimpacts  of  work  in  each  hydraulic  subzone,  and  an  environmental  impact  assessment  will  be \nrequired to comply with national law. The environment specialist in the PMU will prepare these, \nand  the  cost  has  been  included  in  budgets  for  environmental  management  measures.  The \nanalysis  described  in  the  IEE  does  not  contain  any  uncertainties,  and  no  additional  work  is \nrequired at this stage of DWSSDP development.  \n\n                                                 \n1  Primary  stakeholders  include:  residents,  shopkeepers,  and  businesspeople  who  live  and  work  near  the \nconstruction sites; custodians and users of socially and culturally important buildings in these areas; and owners of \nany  land  that  might  be  acquired  to  provide  sites  for  new  overhead  reservoirs.  Secondary  stakeholders  are: \nDWASA;  other  relevant  government  institutions;  NGOs  and  community-based  organizations  working  in  affected \ncommunities;  other  community  representatives  (prominent  citizens,  religious  leaders,  women\u2019s  groups);  the \nbeneficiary community in general; and ADB. \n\n \n \n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 6 November 2007) \n", "Currency Unit\n", "   \u2013 \n", "taka (Tk) \n", "Tk1.00\n$1.00\n", "= \n= \n", "$0.01438 \nTk69.53 \n", "ADB \nCBO \nCSO \nCWASA \nD&M \nDANIDA \nDFID \nDMA \nDMD \nDPHE \nDTW \nDWASA \nDWSSDP \nEA \nEARP \nEIRR \nFCB \nFIRR \nHTW \nIA \nICB \nIEE \nJBIC \nJSP \nKOICA \nLcd \nLGD \nLGI \nMC \nMld \nMODS \nMOF \nNCB \nNGO \nNPRS \nNRW \nO&M \nPBMC \nPCR \nPCU \nPIP \nPMU \nPPI \n", "financial and capacity building \nfinancial internal rate of return \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n \n\u2013  Asian Development Bank \n\u2013  community-based organization \n\u2013  civil society organization \n\u2013  Chittagong Water Supply and Sewerage Authority \n\u2013  design and managing consultants \n\u2013  Danish International Development Assistance \n\u2013  Department for International Development \n\u2013  Dhaka Metropolitan Area \n\u2013  Deputy Managing Director \n\u2013  Department of Public Health Engineering \n\u2013  deep tube well \n\u2013  Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority \n\u2013  Dhaka Water Supply Sector Development Program \n\u2013  executing agency \n\u2013  environmental assessment and review procedures \n\u2013  economic internal rate of return \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  hand tube well \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Japan Bank for International Cooperation \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Korea International Cooperation Agency \n\u2013 \nliter per capita per day \n\u2013  Local Government Division \n\u2013 \nlocal government institution \n\u2013  management consultants \n\u2013  million liters per day \n\u2013  management, operations, distribution, and services \n\u2013  Ministry of Finance \n\u2013  national competitive bidding \n\u2013  nongovernment organization \n\u2013  national poverty reduction strategy \n\u2013  non-revenue water \n\u2013  operation and maintenance \n\u2013  performance-based management contract \n\u2013  project completion report \n\u2013  project coordination unit \n\u2013  performance improvement program \n\u2013  project management unit \n\u2013  program for performance improvement \n", "implementing agency \ninternational competitive bidding \ninitial environmental examination \n", "joint strategy partners \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "PPME \nPRS \nPSC \nPTW \nPWSS \nQCBS \nSDP-WSSB \n", "\u2013  project performance monitoring and evaluation \n\u2013  poverty reduction strategy  \n\u2013  project steering committee \n\u2013  production tube well \n\u2013  pourashava water supply section \n  quality and cost-based selection \n\u2013  Sector Development Programme\u2014Water and Sanitation  \n", "TA \nWACC \nWASA \nWSS \nWTP \n", "Sector in Bangladesh (2006) \ntechnical assistance \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013  weighted average cost of capital  \n\u2013  water supply and sewerage authority \n\u2013  water supply and sanitation \n\u2013  water treatment plant \n", "mistries \npourashava \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "plumbers \nperi-urban town \n", " \nGLOSSARY \n \n", " \nNOTES \n", "(i) \n", "(ii) \n", "The fiscal year of the Government and its agencies ends on 30 June.
