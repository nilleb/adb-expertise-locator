PRASAC  has  prioritized the  development of  its  MSME financing \nbusiness line, emphasizing MSMEs led by women. In addition, the loan is expected to contribute \nto enterprise development and broader economic growth in Cambodia by creating jobs. Given the \nundeveloped  nature  of  the  capital  markets  and  the  lack  of  an  interbank  lending  market  in \nCambodia,  the  financial  sector  needs  access  to  longer-tenor  funding  to  support  growth  and \nreduce certain risks. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n\nInvestment Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nMicrofinance sector. Cambodia\u2019s microfinance sector plays a central role in promoting \nfinancial  inclusion  and  improving  livelihoods  by  providing  small  credit  to  individuals  in  lower-\nincome segments and microenterprises.2 Emerging from nonprofit microcredit projects initiated \nby international development partners in the early 1990s, Cambodia\u2019s microfinance sector has \nbecome one of the most active in the world. Growing appreciably during the last decade (2006-\n2016),  the  sector  increased  more  than  36  times,  with  a  43%  compound  annual  growth  rate \n(CAGR)  for  loans.  Through  an  extensive  distribution  network,  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs) \nhave become the foremost provider of financial products and services to Cambodia\u2019s rural areas, \nwhere more than three-fourths of the country\u2019s 16.3 million people live. This coverage has enabled \nsome  MFIs  to  service  not  only  the  lower-income  segment,  but  increasingly  also  the  emerging \nlower  middle-income  segment  and growing MSMEs.3  The rapid pace  of growth  in  Cambodia\u2019s \nmicrofinance  sector  has  raised  certain  concerns,  including  sector  saturation,  borrower  over-\nindebtedness, and customer buyouts. In 2016, the Microfinance Index of Market Outreach and \nSaturation  reported  that  Cambodia  may  have  reached  a  critical  stage  of  saturation  in  certain \ncustomer  segments  because  of  the  rapid  expansion  of  the  country\u2019s  microfinance  sector.4 \nHowever,  the  report  also  suggested  that  higher  average  loan  sizes  may  indicate  that  some \nCambodian  MFIs  service  clients  in  the  upper  lower-income  and  emerging  middle-income \nsegments in addition to the lowest income quintile, which would contribute to larger loan sizes. In \nconsideration of market developments, the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) issued a regulation \nin 2017 capping interest rates for microfinance loans at 18% to lower credit growth. \n \nMicro, small, and medium-sized enterprises overview. According to a 2014 census, \n4. \nMSMEs in Cambodia totaled 512,870, accounting for 99.8% of all enterprises in the country, and \nemployed 71.8% of the national labor force. 5 The Cambodian economy is highly informal, with \n\n \n\n1  Micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) are broadly defined as sole proprietorships, partnerships, or \n\nlimited liability companies with up to 100 employees and/or total assets of less than $500,000. \n\n2  Microfinance institutions (MFIs) have networks and branches in rural villages and communities. MFIs have better \n\nmeans and capability to reach the unbanked and the underbanked compared with commercial banks. \n\n3  S.  Sinha.  2014.  Microfinance  in  Cambodia:  Investors\u2019  Playground  or  Force  for  Financial  Inclusion?  European \n\nMicrofinance Platform. 10 January. \n\n4  Microfinance Index of Market Outreach and Saturation. 2016. Cambodia: Multiple Borrowing and Loan Sizes. Paris. \n5  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2015. Asia SME Finance Monitor 2014. Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fonly  3.4%  of  all  enterprises  registered  at  the  Ministry  of  Commerce.  Unlike  in  other  emerging \nmarkets,  the  informal  sector  in  Cambodia  comprises  microenterprises  (with  fewer  than  five \nworkers as well as a surprisingly large percentage of small (with 5-19 workers) and medium-sized \nenterprises  (SMEs)  (with  20-99  workers).  Close  to  70.0%  of  small  enterprises  and  44.2%  of \nmedium-sized enterprises have no registration from the Ministry of Commerce or a provincial or \nmunicipal commerce division.6 This has affected the availability of financing for enterprise growth \nand  development.  Cambodian  MSMEs  have  limited  access  to  finance,  with  only  17.7%  of \nunregistered enterprises acquiring a loan or a line of credit from a financial institution as of 2014 \n(footnote 6). Despite the high liquidity of the banking system, banks have difficulty in lending to \nMSMEs given the challenges in evaluating their creditworthiness on a cost-effective basis. As a \nresult, banks typically ration credit to MSMEs or apply high-risk premiums (footnote 5). While this \nsituation has contributed to certain MFIs providing loans to larger SMEs, 97.7% of working capital \nand 94.8% of investment capital for MSMEs come from internal funds and informal sources. The \nlack  of  adequate  funding  to  support  the  working  capital  and  investment  needs  of  MSMEs  has \nconsiderable implications not only for these enterprises\u2019 incremental growth and job creation, but \nalso for broader economic growth. Further, the lack of needed funding limits MSMEs\u2019 ability to \nincrease  their  competitiveness  and  tie  into  the  value  chain  by  connecting  to  domestic  and \ninternational production networks. \n \n5. \nInvestment rationale. To address the issues related to MSMEs\u2019 access to finance and \ncredit  in  Cambodia,  the  nonsovereign  operations  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has \nsought  to  partner  with  financial  institutions  that  have  developed  inclusive  business  models \ntargeting such underbanked segments. This has led ADB to provide financing to ACLEDA Bank \nPlc  in  20137  and  agree  to  invest  in  BRED  Bank  Cambodia  in  2018.8  ADB  has  also  selected \nPRASAC as one of its partners to reach the underserved market in Cambodia. Based in Phnom \nPenh, PRASAC is Cambodia\u2019s largest MFI, accounting for 35% of the MFI credit market and 30% \nof the MFI deposit market. With total assets exceeding $1.8 billion as of year-end 2017, PRASAC \noffers  a  range  of  credit  and  savings  products  to  390,500  retail  and  MSME  clients  through  its \nnetwork of 176 branches, 128 ATMs, and 490 point-of-sale sites that cover all 25 provinces and \noperate in more than 13,000 villages.9 Of its total borrowers, 89% are in rural areas and 11% are \nin  semi-urban  areas.  Women  borrowers  account  for  81%  of  PRASAC\u2019s  total  loan  portfolio. \nPRASAC has applied to become a commercial bank to better serve the market. \n \nB. \n \n6. \nOverview. Established in 1995 as a development project funded by the European Union, \nPRASAC  was  originally  founded  to  rehabilitate  and  support  agricultural  development  in  six \nprovinces in Cambodia. The company\u2019s mission evolved over the years, transitioning to a credit \noperator  registered  with  NBC  as  the  PRASAC  Credit  Association  in  2002  before  becoming  a \nlicensed MFI in 2004. In 2010, PRASAC obtained its microfinance deposit-taking institution (MDI) \nlicense enabling it to receive deposits. \n \n7. \nBusiness  strategy.  Following  PRASAC\u2019s  transformation  into  an  MFI,  the  company\u2019s \nstrategic focus was to provide credit to rural communities and microenterprises throughout the \ncountry. Under the guidance of its then shareholders, PRASAC broadened its product range to \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\n \n\n6  World Bank and ADB. 2015.

Over  time,  the  company \nredefined its strategic focus and expanded its customer base to capture retail and MSMEs in both \nrural  and  semi-urban  communities.  In  2013,  PRASAC  sought  NBC  approval  for  a  license  to \noperate  as  a  commercial  bank  in  order  to  better  service  the  financial  needs  of  its  expanding \nclientele.  As  part  of  this  process,  PRASAC  hired  the  Frankfurt  School  of  Finance  and \nManagement as a consultant to assist the company with the preparations for conversion to a bank \nby developing  a revised  risk management  policy,  lending  policy,  and  staff  training  program  on \nSME loan analysis. While acknowledging the potential benefits of bank conversion for PRASAC, \nNBC  required  the  company  to  bring  in  a  strategic  shareholder  with  banking  experience  as  a \nprecondition  for  approval.  In  2017,  Bank  of  East  Asia  (BEA),  a  leading  commercial  bank  from \nHong Kong, China, became a strategic shareholder in PRASAC. Pursuant to PRASAC\u2019s business \nstrategy  for  2018\u20132022,  the  company  aims  to  become  one  of  the  country\u2019s  leading  retail  and \nMSME  banks  in  the  medium-term.  While  still  servicing  the  needs  of  its  existing  microfinance \nclientele,  PRASAC  will  aim  to  widen  its  customer  base  by  offering  innovative  products  and \nservices  to  underserved  lower-income  and  emerging  middle-income  households  and  MSMEs \nthrough  its  traditional  distribution  network  and  increasingly  through  digital  networks  deploying \nfinancial technology (\u201cfintech\u201d) solutions. The fourth-largest financial institution in Cambodia as of \nyear-end 2017, PRASAC has 13% of total financial sector assets. Key to PRASAC\u2019s strategy is \nproviding  an  array  of  tailored  products,  customized  for  each  targeted  client  segment  \u2013  retail, \nMSME, and corporate (special groups and nongovernmental organizations) -- at competitive rates \nwith superior customer service. To support these efforts, PRASAC increased its staff size from \n2,765 in 2013 to more than 7,058 in 2017, 50% of whom are credit officers. \n \nC. \n \n8. \nOwnership. Following its conversion from a development project to a credit operator in \n2002, PRASAC had a trust funds-ownership structure, under which it had two initial shareholders: \nthe Cambodia Rural Development Foundation (CRDF), a government trust fund, and PRASAC \nStaff Company (PSC). In 2007, the Cambodian Rural Development Foundation sold its interest \nto five shareholders: the Belgian Investment Company for Developing Countries (BIO), Dragon \nCapital Group (DCG), Lanka Orix Leasing Company PLC (LOLC), Nederlandse Financierings-\nMaatschappij voor Ontwikkelingslanden NV (FMO), and Oikocredit.10 In 2012, Oikocredit sold its \nstake to the existing investors. Following Oikocredit\u2019s exit, BIO, DCG, FMO, and LOLC each had \na  22.25%  equity  interest,  and  PSC  owned  the  remaining  11%.  This  shareholder  structure \nremained until 2017 when BEA acquired a 21% stake in PRASAC as a strategic shareholder. The \nremaining interest is held by existing shareholder LOLC, which bought out the shares of the other \nshareholders to bring its total interest in PRASAC to 70%, and PSC, which holds 9%. LOLC is a \nleading  financial  service  conglomerate  from  Sri  Lanka  with  diversified  interests  in  agriculture, \nplantations,  leisure,  construction,  renewable  energy,  trading,  and  manufacturing.  BEA  is  the \nlargest independent, local commercial bank in Hong Kong, China, offering a comprehensive range \nof  retail  banking,  corporate  banking,  wealth management,  and investment  services through  its \n220 outlets in Hong Kong, China, the rest of greater People\u2019s Republic of China, Southeast Asia, \nthe United Kingdom, and the United States. \n \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\n \n\n10 BIO is a member of the Association of European Development Finance Institutions, a cofinancing facility established \nto facilitate the financing of private sector projects in emerging markets in collaboration with the European Investment \nBank. DCG is an integrated investment group centered around the emerging financial markets of frontier Asia. LOLC \nis  a  leading  Sri  Lankan  conglomerate  operating  in  several  sectors,  including  financial  services,  agriculture, \nplantations,  leisure,  construction,  renewable  energy,  trading  and  manufacturing.  FMO  is  the  Dutch  development \nbank. Oikocredit is a worldwide cooperative and social investor in the MSME sector. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fIntegrity  and  enhanced  tax  integrity  due  diligence  were  conducted  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s \n\n9. \nguidelines.11 \n \n10. \nCorporate governance. PRASAC\u2019s board of directors has seven members, five of whom \nare shareholder nominees (LOLC and BEA each have two representatives; PSC has one) and \ntwo are independent directors. The board has a mix of professionals with substantial experience \nin MSME lending, legal, financial services, and banking operations. Tze Ching Chan, a former \nCitibank executive and currently senior advisor to BEA, chairs the board. He has more than 30 \nyears  of  experience  in  commercial  and  corporate  banking.  The  board  is  assisted  by  the  risk \nmanagement,  remunerations,  and  audit  committees.  An  independent  director  chairs  the  audit \ncommittee. \n \n11.  Management. Sim Senacheert, PRASAC\u2019s president and chief executive officer who has \nmore  than  22  years  of  experience,  has  been the  head  of  PRASAC\u2019s  management  team  since \n2003.  Senior  management  consists  of  an  experienced  team  with  academic  backgrounds  in \nfinance, business, and agronomy, as well several decades of involvement in microfinance. The \nteam is supported by nine executive committees, including the asset and liability management \ncommittee and the credit committee. \n \n12. \nRisk  management.  PRASAC  has  a  comprehensive  risk  management  system  that \nfocuses on four risk categories: credit risk, operational risk, financial risk, and compliance risk. \nThe  board  of  director\u2019s  risk  management  committee  provides  oversight  on  risks,  including \nsystemic risks to the organization and portfolio and/or balance sheet arising from credit quality, \nliquidity,  and  interest  rate  movements.  At  the  management  level,  an  independent  risk \nmanagement department focuses on operational risks and associated financial and reputational \nconsequences. Operational risk management is carried out through a comprehensive system of \ninternal  controls,  separation  of  duties  between  key  functions,  and  detailed  standard  operating \nprocedures.  Market  risk  management  is  carried  out  by  the  asset  and  liability  management \ncommittee,  which  assesses  market  risks  such  as  interest  and  foreign  exchange  rates  and \nmanages the company\u2019s liquidity position. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nADB will provide a senior unsecured loan of up to $40 million to PRASAC. \n\n \nA. \n \n13. \n \nB. \n \n14. \nto MSMEs in Cambodia. \n \n15.

The  first  report  will  be  submitted  no  later  than  12  months  after  the  first \ndisbursement. \n \nC. \n \n17. \nSupport  the  growth  of  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  and  the \ndevelopment of the missing middle. ADB funding will support the growth of PRASAC\u2019s MSME \nfinancing portfolio, providing needed financial products and services to this underserved segment. \nIn addition to providing MSMEs\u2014many of which are owned by women\u2014with access to finance to \nsupport  working  capital  and  investment  needs,  the  transaction  will  promote  entrepreneurship, \nespecially female entrepreneurship, as well as contribute to enterprise development and broader \neconomic growth through job creation. \n \n18. \nProvide access to longer-tenor debt. PRASAC relies on deposits with an average tenor \nof less than 1 year for most of its funding. PRASAC must raise additional longer-tenor financing \nto diversify its funding sources, fund its longer-tenor MSME portfolio, which is expected to grow \n30%  year-on-year  in  the  medium-term;  and  help  address  its  asset\u2013liability  mismatch.  The \ntransaction, which would represent approximately 10% of PRASAC\u2019s total debt funding required \nfor the next 3 years, would contribute to this effort. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n \nA. \n \nImpact.

PRASAC will not use ADB \nfunding to finance projects classified category A for environmental impacts or category A or B for \ninvoluntary resettlement or indigenous peoples. PRASAC will apply ADB's prohibited investment \nactivities  list,  ensure  that  investments  using  ADB  funds  abide  by  applicable  national  laws  and \nregulations, and comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement.

Following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998), \n24. \nPRASAC has incorporated measures to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment \nin its business activities. Key features of the gender action plan are as follows: (i) promote female \nentrepreneurship  and  increase  female  entrepreneurs\u2019  access  to  finance;  (ii)  develop  lending \nproducts and provide services that support MSMEs owned or led by women; and (iii) strengthen \nthe collection, analysis, and reporting of sex-disaggregated data that will improve gender analysis \nof lending operations. Such support will contribute to the building of channels for MSMEs led by \nwomen in Cambodia to access formal financial services. PRASAC will submit periodic reports on \nimplementation of gender measures to ADB. \n \n\n \n\n13 ADB. 2014.
