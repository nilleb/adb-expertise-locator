THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed senior \nunsecured loan of up to $40,000,000 to PRASAC Microfinance Institution Limited (PRASAC) for \nthe Expanding Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprise Lending Project in Cambodia.1 \n \n2.  The proposed loan will support the growth of PRASAC\u2019s financing portfolio for micro, \nsmall, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), providing needed financial products and services \nto this underserved segment. PRASAC has prioritized the development of its MSME financing \nbusiness line, emphasizing MSMEs led by women. In addition, the loan is expected to contribute \nto enterprise development and broader economic growth in Cambodia by creating jobs. Given the \nundeveloped nature of the capital markets and the lack of an interbank lending market in \nCambodia, the financial sector needs access to longer-tenor funding to support growth and \nreduce certain risks. \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n3.  Microfinance sector. Cambodia\u2019s microfinance sector plays a central role in promoting \nfinancial inclusion and improving livelihoods by providing small credit to individuals in lower-\nincome segments and microenterprises.2 Emerging from nonprofit microcredit projects initiated \nby international development partners in the early 1990s, Cambodia\u2019s microfinance sector has \nbecome one of the most active in the world. Growing appreciably during the last decade (2006-\n2016), the sector increased more than 36 times, with a 43% compound annual growth rate \n(CAGR) for loans. Through an extensive distribution network, microfinance institutions (MFIs) \nhave become the foremost provider of financial products and services to Cambodia\u2019s rural areas, \nwhere more than three-fourths of the country\u2019s 16.3 million people live. This coverage has enabled \nsome MFIs to service not only the lower-income segment, but increasingly also the emerging \nlower middle-income segment and growing MSMEs.3 The rapid pace of growth in Cambodia\u2019s \nmicrofinance sector has raised certain concerns, including sector saturation, borrower over-\nindebtedness, and customer buyouts. In 2016, the Microfinance Index of Market Outreach and \nSaturation reported that Cambodia may have reached a critical stage of saturation in certain \ncustomer  segments  because  of  the  rapid  expansion  of  the country\u2019s microfinance  sector.4 \nHowever, the report also suggested that higher average loan sizes may indicate that some \nCambodian  MFIs  service  clients  in  the  upper  lower-income  and  emerging  middle-income \nsegments in addition to the lowest income quintile, which would contribute to larger loan sizes. In \nconsideration of market developments, the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) issued a regulation \nin 2017 capping interest rates for microfinance loans at 18% to lower credit growth. \n \n4.  Micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises overview. According to a 2014 census, \nMSMEs in Cambodia totaled 512,870, accounting for 99.8% of all enterprises in the country, and \nemployed 71.8% of the national labor force. 5 The Cambodian economy is highly informal, with \n \n1  Micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) are broadly defined as sole proprietorships, partnerships, or \nlimited liability companies with up to 100 employees and/or total assets of less than $500,000. \n2  Microfinance institutions (MFIs) have networks and branches in rural villages and communities. MFIs have better \nmeans and capability to reach the unbanked and the underbanked compared with commercial banks. \n3  S. Sinha. 2014. Microfinance in Cambodia: Investors\u2019 Playground or Force for Financial Inclusion? European \nMicrofinance Platform. 10 January. \n4 Microfinance Index of Market Outreach and Saturation. 2016. Cambodia: Multiple Borrowing and Loan Sizes. Paris. \n5  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2015. Asia SME Finance Monitor 2014. Manila. \n ", "2 \nonly 3.4% of all enterprises registered at the Ministry of Commerce. Unlike in other emerging \nmarkets, the informal sector in Cambodia comprises microenterprises (with fewer than five \nworkers as well as a surprisingly large percentage of small (with 5-19 workers) and medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs) (with 20-99 workers). Close to 70.0% of small enterprises and 44.2% of \nmedium-sized enterprises have no registration from the Ministry of Commerce or a provincial or \nmunicipal commerce division.6 This has affected the availability of financing for enterprise growth \nand development. Cambodian MSMEs have limited access to finance, with only 17.7% of \nunregistered enterprises acquiring a loan or a line of credit from a financial institution as of 2014 \n(footnote 6). Despite the high liquidity of the banking system, banks have difficulty in lending to \nMSMEs given the challenges in evaluating their creditworthiness on a cost-effective basis. As a \nresult, banks typically ration credit to MSMEs or apply high-risk premiums (footnote 5). While this \nsituation has contributed to certain MFIs providing loans to larger SMEs, 97.7% of working capital \nand 94.8% of investment capital for MSMEs come from internal funds and informal sources. The \nlack of adequate funding to support the working capital and investment needs of MSMEs has \nconsiderable implications not only for these enterprises\u2019 incremental growth and job creation, but \nalso for broader economic growth. Further, the lack of needed funding limits MSMEs\u2019 ability to \nincrease their competitiveness and tie into the value chain by connecting to domestic and \ninternational production networks. \n \n5.  Investment rationale. To address the issues related to MSMEs\u2019 access to finance and \ncredit in Cambodia, the nonsovereign operations of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has \nsought to partner with financial institutions that have developed inclusive business models \ntargeting such underbanked segments. This has led ADB to provide financing to ACLEDA Bank \nPlc in 20137 and agree to invest in BRED Bank Cambodia in 2018.8 ADB has also selected \nPRASAC as one of its partners to reach the underserved market in Cambodia. Based in Phnom \nPenh, PRASAC is Cambodia\u2019s largest MFI, accounting for 35% of the MFI credit market and 30% \nof the MFI deposit market. With total assets exceeding $1.8 billion as of year-end 2017, PRASAC \noffers a range of credit and savings products to 390,500 retail and MSME clients through its \nnetwork of 176 branches, 128 ATMs, and 490 point-of-sale sites that cover all 25 provinces and \noperate in more than 13,000 villages.9 Of its total borrowers, 89% are in rural areas and 11% are \nin semi-urban areas. Women borrowers account for 81% of PRASAC\u2019s total loan portfolio. \nPRASAC has applied to become a commercial bank to better serve the market. \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n6.  Overview. Established in 1995 as a development project funded by the European Union, \nPRASAC was originally founded to rehabilitate and support agricultural development in six \nprovinces in Cambodia. The company\u2019s mission evolved over the years, transitioning to a credit \noperator registered with NBC as the PRASAC Credit Association in 2002 before becoming a \nlicensed MFI in 2004. In 2010, PRASAC obtained its microfinance deposit-taking institution (MDI) \nlicense enabling it to receive deposits. \n \n7.  Business strategy. Following PRASAC\u2019s transformation into an MFI, the company\u2019s \nstrategic focus was to provide credit to rural communities and microenterprises throughout the \ncountry. Under the guidance of its then shareholders, PRASAC broadened its product range to \n \n6  World Bank and ADB. 2015. Cambodia Investment Climate Assessment: 2014. Phnom Penh. \n7  ADB. 2013.

Manila. \n9  PRASAC operates the second-largest branch network in Cambodia of any financial institution after ACLEDA Bank. \n ", "3 \ninclude credit and savings offerings after attaining its MDI license. Over time, the company \nredefined its strategic focus and expanded its customer base to capture retail and MSMEs in both \nrural and semi-urban communities. In 2013, PRASAC sought NBC approval for a license to \noperate as a commercial bank in order to better service the financial needs of its expanding \nclientele.  As  part  of  this  process,  PRASAC  hired  the  Frankfurt  School  of  Finance  and \nManagement as a consultant to assist the company with the preparations for conversion to a bank \nby developing a revised risk management policy, lending policy, and staff training program on \nSME loan analysis. While acknowledging the potential benefits of bank conversion for PRASAC, \nNBC required the company to bring in a strategic shareholder with banking experience as a \nprecondition for approval. In 2017, Bank of East Asia (BEA), a leading commercial bank from \nHong Kong, China, became a strategic shareholder in PRASAC. Pursuant to PRASAC\u2019s business \nstrategy for 2018\u20132022, the company aims to become one of the country\u2019s leading retail and \nMSME banks in the medium-term. While still servicing the needs of its existing microfinance \nclientele, PRASAC will aim to widen its customer base by offering innovative products and \nservices to underserved lower-income and emerging middle-income households and MSMEs \nthrough its traditional distribution network and increasingly through digital networks deploying \nfinancial technology (\u201cfintech\u201d) solutions. The fourth-largest financial institution in Cambodia as of \nyear-end 2017, PRASAC has 13% of total financial sector assets. Key to PRASAC\u2019s strategy is \nproviding an array of tailored products, customized for each targeted client segment \u2013 retail, \nMSME, and corporate (special groups and nongovernmental organizations) -- at competitive rates \nwith superior customer service. To support these efforts, PRASAC increased its staff size from \n2,765 in 2013 to more than 7,058 in 2017, 50% of whom are credit officers. \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n8.  Ownership. Following its conversion from a development project to a credit operator in \n2002, PRASAC had a trust funds-ownership structure, under which it had two initial shareholders: \nthe Cambodia Rural Development Foundation (CRDF), a government trust fund, and PRASAC \nStaff Company (PSC). In 2007, the Cambodian Rural Development Foundation sold its interest \nto five shareholders: the Belgian Investment Company for Developing Countries (BIO), Dragon \nCapital Group (DCG), Lanka Orix Leasing Company PLC (LOLC), Nederlandse Financierings-\nMaatschappij voor Ontwikkelingslanden NV (FMO), and Oikocredit.10 In 2012, Oikocredit sold its \nstake to the existing investors. Following Oikocredit\u2019s exit, BIO, DCG, FMO, and LOLC each had \na  22.25%  equity  interest,  and  PSC  owned  the  remaining  11%.  This  shareholder  structure \nremained until 2017 when BEA acquired a 21% stake in PRASAC as a strategic shareholder. The \nremaining interest is held by existing shareholder LOLC, which bought out the shares of the other \nshareholders to bring its total interest in PRASAC to 70%, and PSC, which holds 9%. LOLC is a \nleading financial service conglomerate from Sri Lanka with diversified interests in agriculture, \nplantations, leisure, construction, renewable energy, trading, and manufacturing. BEA is the \nlargest independent, local commercial bank in Hong Kong, China, offering a comprehensive range \nof retail banking, corporate banking, wealth management, and investment services through its \n220 outlets in Hong Kong, China, the rest of greater People\u2019s Republic of China, Southeast Asia, \nthe United Kingdom, and the United States. \n \n \n10 BIO is a member of the Association of European Development Finance Institutions, a cofinancing facility established \nto facilitate the financing of private sector projects in emerging markets in collaboration with the European Investment \nBank. DCG is an integrated investment group centered around the emerging financial markets of frontier Asia. LOLC \nis a leading Sri Lankan conglomerate operating in  several sectors, including financial services, agriculture, \nplantations, leisure, construction, renewable energy, trading and manufacturing. FMO is the Dutch development \nbank. Oikocredit is a worldwide cooperative and social investor in the MSME sector. \n ", "4 \n9.  Integrity and enhanced tax integrity due diligence were conducted pursuant to ADB\u2019s \nguidelines.11 \n \n10.  Corporate governance. PRASAC\u2019s board of directors has seven members, five of whom \nare shareholder nominees (LOLC and BEA each have two representatives; PSC has one) and \ntwo are independent directors. The board has a mix of professionals with substantial experience \nin MSME lending, legal, financial services, and banking operations. Tze Ching Chan, a former \nCitibank executive and currently senior advisor to BEA, chairs the board. He has more than 30 \nyears of experience in commercial and corporate banking. The board is assisted by the risk \nmanagement, remunerations, and audit committees. An independent director chairs the audit \ncommittee. \n \n11.  Management. Sim Senacheert, PRASAC\u2019s president and chief executive officer who has \nmore than 22 years of experience, has been the head of PRASAC\u2019s management team since \n2003. Senior management consists of an experienced team with academic backgrounds in \nfinance, business, and agronomy, as well several decades of involvement in microfinance. The \nteam is supported by nine executive committees, including the asset and liability management \ncommittee and the credit committee. \n \n12.  Risk  management.  PRASAC  has  a  comprehensive  risk  management  system  that \nfocuses on four risk categories: credit risk, operational risk, financial risk, and compliance risk. \nThe  board  of  director\u2019s  risk  management  committee  provides  oversight  on  risks,  including \nsystemic risks to the organization and portfolio and/or balance sheet arising from credit quality, \nliquidity,  and  interest  rate  movements.  At  the  management  level,  an  independent  risk \nmanagement department focuses on operational risks and associated financial and reputational \nconsequences. Operational risk management is carried out through a comprehensive system of \ninternal controls, separation of duties between key functions, and detailed standard operating \nprocedures. Market risk management is carried out by the  asset and liability management \ncommittee, which assesses market risks  such as interest and foreign exchange rates and \nmanages the company\u2019s liquidity position. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n13.  ADB will provide a senior unsecured loan of up to $40 million to PRASAC. \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  Use of proceeds. PRASAC will use the proceeds of ADB\u2019s loan to finance business loans \nto MSMEs in Cambodia. \n \n15.  Monitoring and reporting. ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department will monitor the \nproject. PRASAC will, at predetermined regular intervals and as requested, provide ADB with \n \n11 ADB. 2003.

Evaluation. Monitoring reports will be prepared and submitted to ADB regularly, and at \nleast  annually.  The  first  report  will  be  submitted  no  later  than  12  months  after  the  first \ndisbursement. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n17.  Support  the  growth  of  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  and  the \ndevelopment of the missing middle. ADB funding will support the growth of PRASAC\u2019s MSME \nfinancing portfolio, providing needed financial products and services to this underserved segment. \nIn addition to providing MSMEs\u2014many of which are owned by women\u2014with access to finance to \nsupport working capital and investment needs, the transaction will promote entrepreneurship, \nespecially female entrepreneurship, as well as contribute to enterprise development and broader \neconomic growth through job creation. \n \n18.  Provide access to longer-tenor debt. PRASAC relies on deposits with an average tenor \nof less than 1 year for most of its funding. PRASAC must raise additional longer-tenor financing \nto diversify its funding sources, fund its longer-tenor MSME portfolio, which is expected to grow \n30%  year-on-year  in  the  medium-term;  and  help  address  its  asset\u2013liability  mismatch.  The \ntransaction, which would represent approximately 10% of PRASAC\u2019s total debt funding required \nfor the next 3 years, would contribute to this effort. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n19.  Impact. The project is aligned with the following impact: enhanced access to finance for \nthe underserved, contributing to financial sector development in alignment with the government\u2019s \nsocioeconomic policy agenda, the Rectangular Strategy Phase III (Rectangle III: Private Sector \nDevelopment and Employment) and its implementation plan, the National Strategic Development \nPlan 2014\u20132018, which lay out a vision for socially equitable economic development.12 \n \n20.  Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: sustainable financial services \nprovided to MSMEs as PRASAC sustainably expands its business. \n \n21.  Outputs. The outputs will be: (i) PRASAC\u2019s capacity for MSME lending increased and (ii) \nPRASAC\u2019s capacity for lending to MSMEs led by women increased. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n22.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy.

Phnom Penh. \n ", "6 \ninfrastructure, institutions, and products and services.13 The transaction will contribute to financial \nsector development by supporting the growth of a financial institution, an important component of \nCambodia\u2019s financial sector. ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 also seeks to promote \ninclusive growth. Without access to formal financial services, underserved segments of the \npopulation will be excluded from the growth process and its benefits. The transaction will advance \nthe work that ADB has undertaken in the Financial Sector Development Strategy, 2011-2020, as \nwell as complement ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 and country operations \nbusiness  plan,  2018\u20132020  for  Cambodia  as  ADB\u2019s  nonsovereign  operations  supports  an \ninvestment that promotes private sector investment, gender equity, and more inclusive economic \ngrowth by fostering MSMEs through enhanced access to long-term finance.14 \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n23.  This transaction is classified as category FI for impacts on the environment, involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples. The transaction's potential environmental and social \nimpacts, its risks associated with the financial intermediary's existing and/or likely future portfolio, \nand its commitment to and capacity for environmental and social management have been \nassessed. PRASAC has an existing environmental and social management system under which \nan  exclusion  list  and  procedures  based  on  the  loan  size  are  applied  to  address  projects\u2019 \nenvironmental and social risks. Before the disbursement of ADB financing, the company will \nenhance its environmental and safeguards management system to comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  requirements  by  updating  its  exclusion  list  and  adopting  ADB\u2019s  rapid \nassessment checklists for loans exceeding $20,000. PRASAC will use the proposed loan to \nsupport MSME finance, targeting customers involved in sectors such as trade and commerce, \nagriculture, services, transportation, manufacturing, and construction. PRASAC will not use ADB \nfunding to finance projects classified category A for environmental impacts or category A or B for \ninvoluntary resettlement or indigenous peoples. PRASAC will apply ADB's prohibited investment \nactivities list, ensure that investments using ADB funds abide by applicable national laws and \nregulations, and comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. It will also comply with national \nlabor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy, will take measures to comply with \ninternationally recognized core labor standards.15 PRASAC will report regularly to ADB on its \ncompliance with such laws and any measures taken. PRASAC will disclose information and \nconsult with affected peoples following ADB\u2019s requirements. \n \n24.  Gender equity as a theme. Following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998), \nPRASAC has incorporated measures to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment \nin its business activities. Key features of the gender action plan are as follows: (i) promote female \nentrepreneurship and increase female entrepreneurs\u2019 access to finance; (ii) develop lending \nproducts and provide services that support MSMEs owned or led by women; and (iii) strengthen \nthe collection, analysis, and reporting of sex-disaggregated data that will improve gender analysis \nof lending operations. Such support will contribute to the building of channels for MSMEs led by \nwomen in Cambodia to access formal financial services. PRASAC will submit periodic reports on \nimplementation of gender measures to ADB. \n \n \n13 ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific.

PRASAC was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice related \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. PRASAC\u2019s know-your-\ncustomer and anti-money laundering policy mitigates the risks of money laundering and terrorist \nfinancing. ADB will ensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate provisions \nprohibiting corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in \nthe event of noncompliance. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nC.  Assurances \n \n26.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),16 \nADB will proceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that the Government  of \nCambodia has no objection to the proposed assistance to PRASAC. ADB will enter into suitable \nfinance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the \nproposed assistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \nVI.
