An initial environmental examination was undertaken.  \nAssessment \n   \nProgram  The proposed emergency assistance loan (EAL) for the Earthquake-\nDescription  Displaced People Livelihood Restoration Program (the Program) will be \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  second  loan  to  support  the \nGovernment  of  Pakistan\u2019s  (the  Government)  ongoing  earthquake \nreconstruction  and  rehabilitation  (R&R)  program.  The  first  loan  for \nEarthquake  Emergency  Assistance  Project  (EEAP),  approved  in \nDecember  2005  following  the  devastating  earthquake  on  8  October \n2005,  targeted  the  reconstruction  in  several  infrastructure  sectors, \nincluding power, roads, health, and education. The proposed EAL, which \nwill be provided to the Ministry of Finance (MOF) on a quick-disbursing \nbasis, will be used to finance the reconstruction of seismically compliant \nhouses.  \n  \nIn addition, through an attached technical assistance (TA), the Program \nwill  help  build  the  capacities  of  the  Earthquake  Reconstruction  and \nRehabilitation Authority (ERRA) and other related institutions in seismic \ntraining, financial and strategic management, and environmental and \nsocial protection to support the R&R program. \n   \nRationale  The October 2005 earthquake was devastating. Almost 18 months after \nthe disaster, about 30,000 people are still living in tents and 3.5 million \nmore are living in temporary or semi-permanent shelters. The past two \nwinters have been extremely harsh and difficult. The risk of another \nearthquake  is  also  real.  In  light  of  these  risks,  the  Government  is \ndetermined to complete housing reconstruction by May 2008, making \nthe winter of 2007 the last one for most displaced people before moving \nthem into newly built seismically compliant houses. \n ", "ii     \n  The Program is proposed as an EAL to help the Government maintain \nits overall national development program while it continues to respond to \nthe  urgent  requirements  of  earthquake  reconstruction.  The  proposed \nsupport is an integral part of the overall commitment made by ADB to \nthe Government in the aftermath of the earthquake to mobilize up to $1 \nbillion. Lessons learned from past ADB interventions in Pakistan and \nelsewhere, as well as those of other development partners, clearly justify \nEAL support on a programmatic basis. Specifically, two characteristics of \nthe housing reconstruction program are worth noting: first, the timeframe \nis tight, as the entire housing reconstruction program is expected to be \ncompleted  by  May  2008;  second,  an  owner-driven  implementation \napproach will be followed, where money will be provided to a large \nnumber of individual households which will procure needed materials \nand build their own houses based on the seismically compliant housing \ndesigns provided by ERRA. ADB\u2019s project financing or sector financing \nwill  not  be  able  to  meet  this  need  effectively.  Hence,  some  useful \nfeatures of the programmatic financing approach, namely, loan release \nin tranches with built-in performance indicators (all related to progress in \nhousing  reconstruction)  as  conditions  for  loan  release,  have  been \nincorporated in the loan design. The focus on housing is also in line with \nthe  thrust  of  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy  on \nmitigating losses of priority assets and livelihood.     \n   \nImpact and  The main expected impact of the proposed Program is restoration and \nOutcome  improvement of the livelihood for the earthquake-affected people in Azad \nJammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP). \nThe main expected outcome will be that most affected people will live in \nseismically  compliant  houses,  ensuring  greater  future  safety  and \nsecurity. \n   \nFinancing Plan  Total housing reconstruction needs amount to $1.375 billion, while total \nexternal financing, approved and in the pipeline, without ADB is $816 \nmillion. Moving forward, the Government faces significant requirements \ngiven the large number of houses damaged. The estimated funding gap \nin the housing sector without ADB currently stands at $559 million. \n  As of 31 March 2007, the cumulative expenditure by the Government for \nhousing reconstruction amounted to $621.5 million, (including $247.2 \nmillion before the establishment of ERRA and $374.3 million after). A \nkey point to note is that the Government has already diverted significant \nresources  from  its  general  development  priorities  to  meet  the \nreconstruction requirements. In light of the adverse fiscal performance, \nthe Government has requested ADB to provide a concessional loan \nequivalent to SDR263,875,000 (equivalent to $400 million) to finance the \nhousing reconstruction program. In addition, the World Bank and the \nIslamic Development Bank have tentatively proposed $130 million and \n$127  million,  respectively,  additional  financing  for  housing \nreconstruction. If all these sources of external finding materialize, the \nGovernment will be able to recoup a portion of the expenditures already \nincurred. This would imply a net expenditure of $159 million by the \nGovernment for housing reconstruction.  ", "  iii\n  The ADB loan will carry an interest of 1% per year and a maturity of 40 \nyears, including a grace period of 10 years, with repayment of principal \nat 2% per year during the first 10 years after the grace period and 4% \nper year thereafter. The Government will bear the foreign exchange risk.  \n \nAllocation and  The loan proceeds will flow to the Government\u2019s central budget, and the \nTerms  Government  will  contribute  the  funds  to  ERRA  through  the  budget \nallocation process in a timely manner. \n   \nPeriod of  1 July 2007\u201330 June 2008  \nUtilization \n   \nEstimated Program  30 June 2008 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  ERRA will pay housing subsidies to the targeted affected people through \nArrangements  its  two  provincial  or  state  branches:  (i)  the  Provincial  Earthquake \nReconstruction  and  Rehabilitation  Agency  (PERRA)  for  North-West \nFrontier Province (NWFP), and (ii) State Earthquake Reconstruction and \nRehabilitation Agency (SERRA) for Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). All \ntransactions  are  conducted  through  bank  accounts,  with  no  cash \nchanging hands. PERRA and SERRA provide important checking and \nverification to ensure that the list of affected people is up-to-date and \ncorrect. Feedback indicates that this approach minimizes potential leaks \nduring transactions, and has been effective in getting the funds to the \ntargeted affected people. \n \n  Individual households will carry out housing reconstruction based on the \nstandards and designs specified by ERRA. The subsidy schemes are \ndeveloped based on the market replacement value of a typical house \n(39 square meters), irrespective of the size of the original houses. For a \ncompletely destroyed house, the payments to the households are made \nin four installments based on benchmarks of construction progress, i.e., \nPRs25,000,  PRs75,000,  PRs25,000,  and  PRs50,000,  for  a  total  of \nPRs175,000  (about  $3,000).  For  a  partially  damaged  house,  the \npayments are made in two installments, i.e., PRs25,000 and PRs50,000, \nfor a total of PRs75,000. For houses with minor damage, the owners will \nreceive one payment of PRs25,000. The payments are made based on \nprogress  reports  by  field  inspectors  provided  by  the  Army  and \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs). \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Finance \n   \nProcurement and  The loan will be released in two tranches. The first tranche of $200 \nDisbursement  million equivalent, to be released upon loan effectiveness, will provide \nfinancing  support  on  a  retroactive  basis  for  the  significant  housing \nexpenditures already incurred by the Government.  The second tranche \nof the loan (i.e., remaining amount in the loan account) is expected to be \nreleased within six months of the release of the first tranche, subject to  \n \n ", "iv     \n  compliance  with  a  set  of  performance  targets.  These  performance \ntargets or benchmarks as conditions for releasing the second tranche \nhave been agreed upon between the Government and ADB as follows: \n \n  (i)  ERRA  has  paid  the  third  installment  of  the  housing \nsubsidy to 85% of the eligible households who received \nthe second installment and provided Financial Monitoring \nReports (FMRs) and other documents as evidence of the \npayment;1 \n \n(ii)  unqualified audit opinion on ERRA\u2019s financial statements \nfor FY2007 has been submitted to ADB; \n \n(iii)  training facilities have been provided by the Government \nto enable the commencement of the training program for \nhouseholds under the attached technical assistance (TA); \n \n(iv)  all consultant contract awards for the Legal Assistance, \nGovernance, and Institutional Building component under \nthe EEAP have been made. \n \n  For each tranche, the Government will submit a withdrawal application \nsupported by necessary documents. For the first tranche, such withdrawal \napplication will be accompanied by (i) a Financial Monitoring Report (FMR) \nfor the quarter ended 31 March 2007 indicating that the amount of eligible \nexpenditures paid for by the Government during the period from 8 October \n2005  to  31  March  2007  is  greater  than  the  amount  of  the  requested \nwithdrawal, and (ii) a certificate of the Government confirming that the FMR \nis correct.  For the second tranche, such withdrawal application will be \naccompanied by (i)  the most recent FMR indicating the amount of eligible \nexpenditures paid for by the Government during the period from 1 April \n2007 to  the end of the quarter to which the FMR relates, (ii) a certificate of \nthe Government confirming that the amount indicated in the FMR plus the \nprojected eligible expenditures for the remaining Program Period exceed the \namount of the requested withdrawal; and (iii) documents evidencing that the \nconditions for the aforementioned second tranche release have been met. \nThe Government Account No.1 at the State Bank of Pakistan (used for \nthe quick disbursing component of the previous EEAP loan) will serve as \nthe deposit account for which all withdrawals from the loan account will \nbe deposited. The deposit account   will   be managed in accordance \nwith terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB.  The Government will \ntransfer  an  amount  equal  to  the  eligible  expenditures  projected  for  the \nremaining  Program  period  to  ERRA\u2019s  account  at  the  National  Bank  of \nPakistan within 60 days of the release of the second tranche.  ADB will \nreserve the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and verify the \naccuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \n                                                 \n1  The installments will be as defined under the Implementation Arrangements. ", "  v\n  The loan proceeds will be used for financing the housing reconstruction \nprogram. This will be implemented through providing compensation or \ndirect  payments  to  individual  households  who  will  procure  needed \nmaterials and reconstruct their own houses. \n   \nProgram Benefits  The  beneficiaries  of  the  Program  are  the  3.5  million  earthquake-\nand Beneficiaries  displaced people. The main socioeconomic impact will be the restoration \nand improvement of the livelihood of the people. This includes provision \nof seismically compliant housing for the earthquake-displaced people \nand students. Most of them still live either in tents or temporary shelters. \nRestoration of the physical infrastructure will lead to economic recovery \nof NWFP and AJK, characterized by faster economic growth and more \nopportunities for the poor and socially vulnerable. The reconstruction of \ninfrastructure  also  will  create  many  jobs  for  skilled  workers  in  the \nconstruction industry. Due to the increased demand, the region is facing \na shortage of such skilled workers. Similarly, reconstruction is having \npositive effects on the local construction materials industry, moderately \nincreasing the prices of the key construction materials such as cement.  \n \n  The earthquake has shifted gender roles of women and men in the \nearthquake-affected areas. Due to the loss of male partners, some of the \nwomen\u2019s responsibilities have increased as they assume the additional \nburden of caring for orphaned children and persons with disabilities, \nwhile also emerging as heads of households. In NWFP, women head \nmore than 23% of households compared with 31% in AJK. This new \nreality  requires  rethinking  social  conditioning,  as  well  as  the  type  of \ncontributions that members of the household and the community can \nmake. In particular, stakeholders report that women-headed households, \nwidows, and orphaned children (mostly girls) have had little access to \nsupplies and services due to their limited mobility or absence of proper \nidentity documents to support these claims. A Gender and Vulnerability \nAction Plan has been prepared and will be implemented. It aims to \nensure that essential needs, constraints, and priorities voiced by women, \nand extremely vulnerable individuals and families, are reflected in the \ndesign of the Program and monitored during loan implementation. \n   \nRisks and  The main risks facing the Program include (i) natural risks, such as \nAssumptions  another earthquake before completion of the reconstruction program; (ii) \nfiduciary  risks,  e.g.,  corruption;  and  (iii)  market  risks,  e.g.,  a  major \nescalation  in  the  costs  of  construction  materials  due  to  increased \ndemand. The real possibility of another earthquake in the near future \nincreases the urgency to complete the seismically compliant housing \nprogram  promptly.  The  Program  will  provide  expedited  and  flexible \nfinancing to help achieve this. Fiduciary risk has been a main concern \nfor the Government and its development partners, which jointly have put \nin place strong financial management and reporting mechanisms, as \nwell as monitoring and evaluation support. ERRA has monitored closely \nthe risk of price escalation, and the increases have been acceptable so \nfar. However, further delays in reconstruction could expose the Program \nto larger price escalations. \n \n ", "vi     \n  The key assumptions underlying the success of the Program and, to an \nextent, the entire R&R program include: \n \n(i)  the Government and development agencies will allocate \nadequate resources for reconstruction in all sectors;  \n \n(ii)  enough capacities, including skilled labors, are available \nfor housing construction; \n  \n(iii)  seismic standards are strictly enforced;  \n \n(iv)  alternative sites can be found for houses whose original \nsites have been destroyed by landslides; and  \n \n(v)  most  affected  households  will  use  the  compensation \nmoney  for  housing  reconstruction,  and  they  will  have \nenough  savings  to  finance  expansion  beyond  the \nminimum  living  area  supported  by  the  Government \ncompensation. \n   \nTechnical  Building on the ongoing TA on Capacity Building for the Office of the \nAssistance  Auditor General2 attached to EEAP, a TA entitled Capacity Building for \nInstitutions Related to Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation will \nbe attached to the Program. The TA is estimated to cost the equivalent \nof  $2,500,000.  ADB  will  provide  $2,000,000,  from  the  Pakistan \nEarthquake Fund (PEF) on a grant basis. ERRA will be the Executing \nAgency. However, the TA project will provide additional support for all \nthe institutions related to the earthquake R&R program in key areas as \ndeemed  necessary.  This  support  will  include  (i)  community-based \ntraining on seismic standards and construction monitoring techniques; \n(ii)  financial  and  strategic  management;  and  (iii)  environmental  and \nsocial protection (emphasizing gender and vulnerability aspects of social \nprotection).  Special  attention  will  be  paid  to  capacity  building  at  the \nprovincial or state and district levels. \n \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2005.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Earthquake-Displaced People Livelihood Restoration \nProgram (the Program). The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) from the \nPakistan Earthquake Fund (PEF) for the Capacity Building of Institutions Related to Earthquake \nReconstruction and Rehabilitation, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting on the \nauthority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  will  approve  the  TA.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n \nII.  RATIONALE: ANALYSIS, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  The Government\u2019s Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Program \n2.  The 8 October 2005 earthquake that hit the northern Pakistan, principally North-West \nFrontier Province (NWFP) and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), was the most devastating in \nthe nation\u2019s history. Approximately 615,000 houses (about 585,000 rural houses and 30,000 \nurban houses), 6,472 schools, 570 medical facilities, and 1,500 government buildings were \ndestroyed or damaged. In addition, landslides damaged power supplies and roads. About 3.5 \nmillion people lost their homes, and official figures put the death toll at more than 80,000. In a \njoint preliminary assessment, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and World Bank estimated \nthe total reconstruction cost at more than $3.5 billion, although the actual figure could be much \nhigher. \n \n3.  Adopting  a  \u201cBuilding  Back  Better\u201d  strategy,  the  Government  of  Pakistan  (the \nGovernment)  initiated  the  earthquake  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  (R&R)  program. \nAppendix 2 provides a detailed account of the scope and progress of the R&R program. The \naim of the strategy and the program is to rebuild infrastructure to post-earthquake standards, \nand to develop improved policy and institutional frameworks. The Earthquake Reconstruction \nand Rehabilitation Authority (ERRA) was established to oversee and monitor the R&R program. \nIt  is  supported  by  two  regional  affiliates:  (i)  the  Provincial  Earthquake  Reconstruction  and \nRehabilitation Agency (PERRA) for NWFP, and (ii) the State Earthquake Reconstruction and \nRehabilitation Agency (SERRA) for AJK. These, in turn, are supported by district reconstruction \nunits (DRU) at the district level. A separate agency was created to coordinate earthquake \nreconstruction, because the capacities of the existing government agencies were considered \ntoo  weak  to  handle  the  enormous  R&R  tasks.  Other  measures  designed  to  improve  the \neffectiveness and efficiency of the R&R program include (i) strengthening the decision making \nand implementation capacities in the two affected provinces and/or states, using simplified \napproval and implementation procedures; (ii) ensuring the R&R program meets appropriate \nsafety, quality, technological, and environmental standards; and (iii) establishing transparent \nprocedures and allowing third-party monitoring.  \n \n4.  The  international  community  and  development  partners,  including  ADB,  pledged \nsignificant financial assistance for the Government\u2019s R&R program. At the Islamabad Donor \nConference in November 2005, ADB President Kuroda announced a pledge of $1 billion. On 14 \nNovember 2005, ADB approved its first package of assistance, totaling $185 million. This \nincluded (i) reallocation of $105 million from loan savings under various ongoing loans, of which \n$85 million was disbursed as budgetary support; and (ii) the establishment of PEF, supported by \nan initial grant of $80 million from ADB. On 13 December 2005, ADB approved the follow-up ", "2     \nEarthquake Emergency Assistance Project (EEAP),1 amounting to $300 million, consisting of a \nPEF grant of $80 million and a loan of $220 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds Resources. \nThese operations raised ADB\u2019s contribution for the reconstruction effort to $405 million.  \n \n5.  Subsequently, ADB allocated a grant of $5 million from the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction, followed by a further reallocation of loan savings equivalent to $62.5 million from \nseveral other ADB-financed projects for the earthquake R&R program. In addition, the Office of \nCofinancing and the Pakistan Resident Mission worked together to mobilize approximately $97 \nmillion in grant funding as contributions to PEF and EEAP. \n \n6.  The development agencies have coordinated the planning and implementation of their \nassistance programs to support each other\u2019s efforts, minimize transaction costs, and maximize \nsynergy. The World Bank\u2019s financial assistance has targeted primarily housing reconstruction, \nwhile ADB has supported infrastructure rehabilitation and reconstruction through its EEAP. \nFunding agencies also made strong efforts to harmonize financial management and reporting \nprocedures. Major multilateral and bilateral development agencies, including World Bank, ADB, \nand  United  Kingdom\u2019s  Department  for  International  Development  (DFID),  conducted  joint \nassessment and reviews of the financial management and fiduciary oversight capacities, and \nmade recommendations to improve the capacities.  \n \n7.  The pace of the R&R program has been uneven. Housing reconstruction, which has \nbeen  financed  principally  by  the  Government,  World  Bank,  and  some  other  development \npartners,  has  shown  the  most  progress.2  A  major  portion  of  the  funds  committed  by \ndevelopment agencies for housing reconstruction has been disbursed. The Government has \nallocated the equivalent of $630 million for the reconstruction of 585,000 rural houses. More \nthan 96% of households have received second installments of finance. The most important \nreason for the fast progress in housing reconstruction is the high level of political commitment to \nmeeting the affected people\u2019s basic need for shelter. A second reason is the owner-driven and \nin situ approach. Finally, the housing reconstruction is being financed mostly under quick-\ndisbursing  financing  facilities,  principally  provided  by  the  World  Bank  and  some  bilateral \ndevelopment agencies. This has minimized transaction costs and reduced delays, which often \nhave been the major hurdles for the prompt implementation of emergency assistance projects.  \n \n8.  In contrast, progress has been slower in repairing and rehabilitating damage in other \nsectors  under  ADB\u2019s  EEAP,  i.e.,  transport  (roads  and  bridges),  power  (power  generation \nstations and transmission lines), and social sectors (education and health facilities). While this is \ndue partly to the higher priority given to housing, implementation capacity constraints and \nbureaucracy on the ground also are to blame. ADB\u2019s normal development project financing \nprocedures,  which  have  been  applied  to  the  sector  components  of  EEAP,  are  also  more \ncomplex. Only about 18% of funds have been disbursed and about 21% of contracts have been \nawarded.  However,  with  the  long  initial  gestation  period  over,  the  establishment  of  the \norganizational structure, policies, and guidelines of ERRA is almost complete. Thus, these \npercentages have started to increase rapidly with the awards of several major contracts in all \nsectors in recent months, i.e., April and May 2007. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to \nPakistan for the Earthquake Emergency Assistance Project. Manila (Loan 2213-PAK[SF], approved in December \n2005, for $300 million). \n2  ADB\u2019s EEAP did not cover housing reconstruction. ", "  3\n9.  Despite the progress made in housing sector, many affected people continue to suffer \nfrom lack of shelter and other basic services. Approximately 30,000 people, or about 1% of the \ndisplaced people, have lost their land suitable for housing reconstruction due to earthquake-\ninduced landslides, and are still living in the temporary camps. A large number of people are still \nmostly living in individually built temporary shelters as permanent houses are being constructed. \nFor the people living in tents and other temporary shelters, life particularly during winter seasons \nremain extremely difficult and death toll could increase further if the winter temperature drops to \ncertain levels.   \n \nB.  Lessons Identified \n10.  ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy paper (2004)3(Emergency Policy)  \nprovides a comprehensive summary of the main lessons identified through (i) self-evaluation by \nthe operational departments, i.e., project or program completion reports; and (ii) independent \nevaluation conducted by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED). The relevant lessons \nare summarized as follows. \n  \n(i)  Emergency projects should focus on the immediate restoration of functions to \nprovide  relief  to  affected  communities,  and  should  avoid  components  with \ncomplicated issues that require long-term preparation. \n(ii)  The  implementation  of  emergency  projects  requires  flexible  approaches  and \nprocedures during preparation and implementation. \n(iii)  Imprest account disbursement procedures do not work satisfactorily in some \ncountries, because they fail to facilitate quick disbursement. \n(iv)  A participatory and gender-responsive approach is essential for reconstruction \nactivities; consultation and involvement with affected communities are required. \n(v)  Greater efforts to strengthen local capacity and involvement of experienced local \nand international nongovernment organizations (NGO) should be considered to \nassist overburdened government agencies.  \n(vi)  The initial implementation stage is typically slow due to inadequate staff, support \nservices, and monitoring mechanisms. \n(vii)  A monitoring system should be established at the field level. \n(viii)  ADB should consider earlier delegation of projects to its resident missions.  \n \n11.  Most recently, OED completed evaluations of two emergency loans on flood emergency \nrehabilitation in Tajikistan and Kyrgyz Republic.4 The evaluations identified several relevant \nlessons, some of which echoed the lessons from earlier evaluations (para.10). These include (i) \nguarding against the tendency to use emergency loans for regular development projects or for \nproject maintenance; (ii) ensuring adequate on-site supervision; (iii) striking a balance between \nthe emergency nature of the project and the long-term sustainability of the facilities built; (iv) \nenabling  emergency  assistance  to  focus  on  immediate  needs  of  the  population;  and  (v) \nconsidering, at country strategy and program level, a special strategy and program to address \nthe recurrent natural disaster preparation and management in the country, including delegation \nto resident missions as necessary.  \n \n                                                 \n3   ADB. 2004.

Manila (PPE, KGZ 32415, December); ADB. 2006. Performance Evaluation Report. Flood \nEmergency Rehabilitation Project (Loan 1714-TAJ[SF]) in the Republic of Tajikistan. Manila (PPE, TAJ 33483, \nDecember). \n ", "4     \n12.  In addition to lessons from ADB\u2019s experience in disaster relief and management, the \nformulation and design of the Program also benefits from the worldwide experience in this area, \nas well as from ADB\u2019s EEAP and World Bank\u2019s assistance in the housing sector.  \n \n13.  A review of relevant documents and literature provides some useful insight into Japan\u2019s \nexperience  with  the  Kobe  earthquake  reconstruction.  Evidence  suggests  that  housing \nreconstruction was not a top priority in the city\u2019s earthquake construction program. Greater \nparticipation  by  the  affected  people  in  the  planning  and  implementation  of  housing \nreconstruction also could have improved its effectiveness and reduced their prolonged suffering. \nThe experience from Indonesia\u2019s tsunami reconstruction program suggests that, while better \nholistic  planning  of  its  collective  housing  reconstruction  program  has  minimized  potential \ndamage from future earthquakes, progress has been painstakingly slow due to the bureaucratic \nand other impediments inherent in such an approach. In contrast, the owner-driven and in situ \napproach  followed  in  the  reconstruction  of  rural  houses  in  the  Pakistan  earthquake \nreconstruction  program  minimizes  such  delays.  Seismic  zoning  and  strict  enforcement  of \nseismic  building  standards  can  mitigate  the  risks  of  being  prone  to  damage  by  future \nearthquakes. \n \n14.  Lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  EEAP  show  that  earthquake  situations  are  dynamic,  requiring \nadjustments, flexibility, and adaptive decision making. To respond effectively to such emergency \nchallenges, ADB has to move from \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d to a \u201cflexible and efficient response\u201d \nmode that focuses on procedural and technical guidance and advice (as with EEAP), as well as \noffers special flexible procedures, delegation, dedicated legal and procurement support from \nADB, and an efficient system of processing and response. Furthermore, in an emergency \nenvironment with multiple funding agencies providing support on a wide range of needs, \u201cring \nfencing\u201d the portfolios of individual funding agencies with special procedures and requirements \nis  extremely  difficult.  The  focus  should  be  on  strengthening  the  overall  system,  including \nfinancial, environmental, and social safeguards and operational procedures, to manage for \noverall results, rather than the individual portfolios.  \n \n15.  A related point is that that ADB\u2019s regular project procurement procedures based on \nstatements of expenditures might not be well suited for housing reconstruction, which involves \npayments in tranches to a large number of homeowners within a short period of time. With its \nEarthquake Emergency Recovery Credit, the World Bank adopted a quick-disbursing approach \nfor its financing of housing reconstruction based on Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) and \nsemiannual future fund requirement forecasts. World Bank recently modified its procedures for \nrapid emergency responses to make them more flexible in all phases of emergency response \nprojects, including processing, approval, and procurement.   \n \nC.  Need for Additional Support on a Quick-Disbursing Basis and Choice of Modality \n16.  The proposed Program is an integral part of ADB\u2019s overall commitment of up to $1 \nbillion, made in the aftermath of the earthquake, to meet the massive reconstruction needs. In \nJanuary 2006, the Government made its first request to ADB for providing a second loan to \nsupport its ongoing earthquake R&R program. In August 2006, due to financing constraints, the \nGovernment  reiterated  its  request  which  further  stressed  the  need  to  materialize  ADB\u2019s \ncommitment. During the Fact-Finding Mission, the Government expressed its wish that the \nsecond  loan  should  have  the  same  financial  terms  as  the  first  EEAP  (i.e.,  the  terms  for \nEmergency Assistance Loan [EAL] including 1% interest rate, 40 years maturity and 10-year \ngrace period).    \n ", "  5\n17.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  has  cumulatively  allocated  Rs.88.05  billion \n(approximately $1.45 billion) for earthquake R&R. Apart from the concessional loans and grants \nfrom  various  development  agencies,  most  of  the  funds  come  from  Government\u2019s  regular \nsources  of  revenue  and  market  borrowings.  This  has  caused  a  substantial  strain  on  the \nGovernment\u2019s budget which has adverse implications for the country\u2019s regular development \nprograms. Pakistan achieved a significant measure of fiscal discipline during 2000-2004, when \nthe fiscal deficit declined to 3.9% of GDP from levels above 6% earlier. However, as a result of \nthe unanticipated reconstruction needs, the fiscal deficit widened to 4.2% of GDP Fiscal Year \n2006. It is expected to rise further to 4.5% of GDP for Fiscal Year 2007. \n \n18.  Appendix 2 provides detailed estimates of the funding requirements and gaps in the \nhousing and education sectors. Of the overall needs, housing reconstruction is the most urgent \nin terms of minimizing the prolonged suffering of affected people and it is also an essential \nprerequisite for full economic recovery. There is an estimated funding gap in the range of $630 \nmillion to $820 million in the housing sector without any additional financing from external \nfunding agencies. The education sector also has a large funding gap currently estimated at \n$646 million. In comparison, the health sector is well funded and supported by ADB, various \ndevelopment agencies, and NGOs. The power sector is also well funded with ADB\u2019s EEAP. \nRoad reconstruction is supported by ADB (with EEAP), the World Bank, and several bilateral \nagencies.  \n \n19.  ADB  has  opted  to  work  with  existing  institutions,  rather  than  working  outside  the \n\u201csystem\u201d. Although this approach might appear to be slow at times, the long-term impact of \nbuilding institutional capacities will be significant. One area that might need additional capacity \nbuilding support is training on seismically compliant building standards and techniques. The \nadoption of the owner-driven, in situ approach requires many inspectors and trainers on the \nground. About 25,000 master trainers have received training, and they have trained more than \n200,000 affected house owners. The Army and NGOs have provided the bulk of the personnel \non  the  ground.  However,  this  task  has  distracted  the  Army  from  its  regular  duties.  Civil \norganizations should gradually take over the role that the Army is playing in inspection and \ntraining. The funding for the NGOs is also nearly depleted.  \n \n20.  ADB\u2019s different lending modalities were compared carefully to determine the best way to \nmeet the urgent needs of housing reconstruction amidst strong competition for resources. The \nEAL was selected as the most appropriate modality to help the Government maintain its overall \nnational development program, while it continues to respond to the urgent requirements of \nearthquake reconstruction. . This choice was based also on two characteristics of the housing \nreconstruction program: (i) the tight time frame (i.e., the program is expected to be completed by \nMay 2008); and (ii) the owner-driven implementation approach, which requires providing money \nto many individual households that will procure needed materials and build their own houses \nbased on the seismically compliant housing designs provided by ERRA. ADB\u2019s project financing \nor sector financing would not be able to meet this need in a timely and effective manner. Hence, \nthe  Program  combines  the  EAL  modality  with  some  useful  features  of  the  programmatic \nfinancing approach, particularly the use of tranches with built-in performance indicators (mostly \nrelated to progress in housing reconstruction) as conditions for loan release. As the utilization \nand disbursements of the proposed loan are closely tied to the earthquake R&R expenditures \nincurred by the Government, the programmatic approach is fully justified.    \n \n21.  The use of EAL to support housing reconstruction is consistent with the Emergency \nPolicy. The Emergency Policy stresses that EALs are designed to mitigate immediate losses to \npriority  assets,  capacity,  or  productivity  rather  than  to  provide  relief  or  comprehensive \n ", "6     \nreconstruction; and that EALs will be restricted to the transition phase and used exclusively for \npriority rehabilitation. The proposed loan will concentrate on mitigating the losses of dwellings \nfor victims who are still in temporary shelters after losing their land and material possessions. \nDwellings  are  priority  assets  that  are  essential  for  the  regeneration  of  livelihoods  and \nproductivity. For the 30,000 people who have been living in tents for almost 2 years, as well as \n3.5 million more still living in temporary or semi-permanent shelters, the past two winters have \nbeen extremely harsh and difficult. Another earthquake is possible. In light of these risks, the \nGovernment is determined to complete housing reconstruction by May 2008. Thus, the winter of \n2007 will be the last one for most displaced people before they move into new seismically \ncompliant houses. Experience elsewhere in the world suggests that housing in particular is a \nprerequisite  for  livelihood  regeneration  and  subsequently  economic  recovery.  Without \naddressing the shelter issue first, reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts would be ineffective.  \n \n22.  The proposed Program is processed within two years of the earthquake. It supports the \nGovernment\u2019s housing reconstruction program which is scheduled to be completed in May \n2008, less than three years after the earthquake. Considering the extreme destruction and \ndislocation caused by the earthquake, these time frames are considered appropriate.  \n \n23.  Special Circumstances: The Emergency Policy requires that (i) an EAL be processed \nin an expeditious manner (within 12 weeks), (ii) up to 30% of the loan be provided in the form of \nretroactive financing, and (iii) the quick-disbursing components finance a list of imports. The \nproposed Program has been processed under somewhat special circumstances in relation to \nthe standard requirements of the policy: \n \n(i)  Processing Timetable: Counting strictly from the time the Government officially \nrequested  ADB  to  provide  additional  assistance  (para.16),  the  12-week  time \nframe  set  out  in  the  policy  has  clearly  been  exceeded  under  the  proposed \nProgram. However, the Program is an integral part of ADB\u2019s overall commitment \nto provide up to $1 billion of assistance made in the aftermath of the earthquake. \nIn the interim, during the course of 2005-2006, ADB has provided assistance \nthrough investment and TA operations (paras.4 & 5). In particular, ADB\u2019s efforts \nover this period and early 2007 have focused primarily on implementing the \nEEAP  and  exploring  concessional  funding  sources  to  meet  the  overall \ncommitment to, and the requirements of, the Government. Further, ADB has also \nworked closely with other development partners in strengthening the fiduciary \nmanagement  capacity  of  ERRA,  to  ensure  that  the  large  external  support \nreaches the intended beneficiaries. As a result, the FMR has become a reliable \ninstrument to assess past reconstruction progress as well as determine ERRA\u2019s \nforward-looking  needs  with  certainty.  Thus,  ADB\u2019s  continuous  engagement \nthroughout  this  period  provides  adequate  justification  for  processing  the \nproposed Program beyond the timeframe stipulated in the policy. \n \n(ii)  Retroactive  Financing:  Given  the  significant  reconstruction  needs,  the \nGovernment  has  been  proactive  in  allocating  scarce  budgetary  resources  to \nERRA since October 2005. As of 31 March 2007, the Government has already \nspent $621.5 million of its own resources (para.35). As noted in para.17, the \nreconstruction needs have strained the fiscal position of the Government. For \nthese reasons, it is considered appropriate that more than 30% of the loan \nproceeds be applied toward retroactive financing of the housing expenditures. \n ", "  7\n(iii)  Financing  Imports:  The  Emergency  Policy  allows  for  quick-disbursing \nassistance to finance imports necessary for effective recovery. The proposed \nProgram will provide quick disbursing assistance for housing reconstruction. As \nmost of the basic construction materials and services (cement, bricks, and labor, \namong  others)  will  be  sourced  locally,  and  not  through  imports,  the  EAL \nrequirement that imports be financed is not applicable in the current context.     \n \n   \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n24.  The main expected impact of the proposed EAL is restoration and improvement of the \nlivelihood for the earthquake-affected people. The main expected outcome will be that most \nearthquake-displaced people will live in seismically compliant houses at the end of the Program.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n25.  In the housing sector, the construction of rural houses must follow the designs and \nspecifications provided by ERRA. The owners of the houses will receive subsidies from ERRA, \nin a maximum of four installments, based on physical progress benchmarks. The main outputs \nof the Program will be the completed rural houses that comply with ERRA seismic standards. \nThe earthquake destroyed or damaged 585,000 rural houses, which need to be repaired or \nrebuilt. ADB loan funds will be used mostly for financing up to four installments of payments to \nthe household in the housing reconstruction program undertaken by ERRA.  \n \n26.  A second category of program outputs covers the capacities built at ERRA to support the \nearthquake R&R program. These capacities include seismic training, financial and strategic \nmanagement, and environmental and social protection (particularly protection of women and \nvulnerable people). ERRA has trained more than 200,000 households in seismic training, and \nthe Program will aim to train at least 50,000 additional households on seismic building designs \nand techniques (Section IV).  \n \nC.  Special Features \n1.  EAL on a Programmatic Basis  \n27.  The  Emergency  Policy  expressly  contemplates  the  inclusion  of  quick-disbursing \ncomponents in EALs to finance imports considered necessary for effective recovery, but also \nemphasizes  that  such  quick-disbursing  components  are  not  program  loans.  These  quick-\ndisbursing components are critical if the key features of the housing reconstruction program\u2014\ntight time frame and owner-driven implementation approach\u2014are to be delivered in a timely and \neffective  manner.  Also,  the  conditions  for  the  release  of  funds from  such  quick-disbursing \ncomponents are closely tied to progress in housing reconstruction, not policy reforms as would \nbe the case for program loans. The factors outlined in paras.20-21 provide adequate justification \nfor channeling the entire assistance on a programmatic and quick-disbursing basis.   \n \n ", "8     \n2.  Harmonization  with  the  Government\u2019s  Reconstruction  Program  and \nSupport from Other Development Partners \n28.  As the Program is to finance the Government\u2019s ongoing earthquake R&R program, the \nprogrammatic financing approach is particularly useful (Appendix 2). On the one hand, due to \nthe dynamic situation on the ground, the information on the costs of housing reconstruction is \ncrude  and  constantly  being  revised.  On  the  other  hand,  with  the  strong  support  from  the \ndevelopment partners and after a long gestation period, the institutional and policy framework \nfor executing the Government\u2019s R&R program has been established and is functional. The \nprogrammatic financing approach, with built-in performance indicators, will provide the flexibility \nand monitoring mechanisms needed for executing such a major and complex undertaking. \n \n29.  The performance indicators as conditions for releasing the second tranche have been \njointly determined with the Government after extensive  consultations. These indicators are \nrelated mostly to progress in housing reconstruction, as well as in the area of legal assistance to \nthe affected people and the auditing results of the use of the previous loan funds (Procurement \nand Disbursement, Section F). \n \n3.  Strong Oversight Mechanisms to Manage Fiduciary Risks \n30.  Emergency  assistance  must  be  supported  by  sound  financial  management  and \noperational procedures, as well as monitoring and evaluation (M&E) mechanisms. As part of \nEEAP, ADB has worked closely with the Government and other development partners, including \nWorld Bank and DFID, in designing such mechanisms. Appendix 3 provides a detailed account \nof  the  financial  management  mechanisms,  including  accounting,  auditing,  and  reporting \narrangements, for the earthquake R&R program.  \n \n31.  ERRA has a proven record in administering the earthquake R&R program, particularly in \nhousing reconstruction. ADB\u2019s EEAP is providing assistance to strengthen the capacities of the \nAuditor General of Pakistan (AGP) and the Controller General of Accounts (CGA). In addition, \nthe ADB, DFID, World Bank, and other development agencies have harmonized their required \naccounting and auditing procedures. As requested by World Bank, ERRA has recruited a strong \nteam of accountants and internal auditors. ADB has helped finance the engagement of two \nchartered accountants based in Islamabad and Peshawar, and is recruiting a third one to be \nbased in AJK. AGP has conducted an audit of ERRA\u2019s account for FY2006. The auditing \nresults, which the development partners have accepted as valid third-party monitoring, are \ngenerally satisfactory. Most of the measures recommended by the audit report for continuous \nimprovements have been implemented to the satisfaction of the development partners.  \n \n32.  Under EEAP, ADB also has played an important role in providing and coordinating the \nassistance by development partners in M&E, including using third-party validations (Appendix \n2). ADB\u2019s assistance will be strengthened as housing reconstruction nears completion or is \ncompleted. More resources will be allocated through the attached TA project for additional \nsupport in some specific areas (Section IV). \n \n4.  Strong Environmental and Social Safeguards \n33.  R&R work could produce adverse environmental and social impacts. For example, the \nreconstruction of houses might lead to timber logging and deforestation. As landslides have \ndestroyed the sites for some of the houses, new sites would have to be found. ERRA has put \ntogether  a  strong  environmental  and  social  safeguards  team,  and  has  developed  its ", "  9\nenvironmental  and  social  strategies  and  actions  plans.  Supported  by  a  safeguards  expert \nfunded by the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), ADB is conducting a \ntraining program under EEAP for the safeguards specialists on national and ADB environmental \nand social safeguards policies and procedures. Under the Program, the attached TA project will \nprovide  additional  assistance  in  social  safeguards,  as  well  as  in  integrating  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental,  resettlement,  and  indigenous  people\u2019s  policies  and  procedures  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s regulations and procedures. These will supplement assistance from the United \nNations Development Programme (UNDP), which has allowed PERRA, SERRA, and DRUs to \nengage a team 20 safeguards specialists. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n34.  Table 1 provides the total housing sector needs and sources of funds. Total housing \nreconstruction  needs  amount  to  $1.375  billion,  while  total  external  financing  without  ADB, \napproved  and  planned,  is  $816  million.  Moving  forward,  the  Government  faces  significant \nrequirements given the large number of houses damaged. The estimated funding gap in the \nhousing sector currently stands at $559 million without ADB financing. \n \nTable 1: Housing Sector Expenditure Needs and Sources of Funds \n($ million) \n \nSource  Approved   Amounts in  Total \nAmount  Pipeline \nA.

According  to  the  FMRs  provided  by  ERRA,  as  of  31  March  2007,  the  cumulative \nexpenditure  by  the  Government  for  housing  reconstruction  amounted  to  $621.5  million, \n(including $247.2 million before the establishment of ERRA and $374.3 million after). A key \npoint to note is that the Government has already diverted significant resources from its general \ndevelopment priorities to meet the reconstruction requirements. In light of the adverse fiscal \nperformance as noted in para.17 above, the Government has requested ADB to provide a \n ", "10    \nconcessional loan from ADB\u2019s Special Fund  resources in the equivalent of $400 million to \nfinance the ongoing housing reconstruction program. At the same time, the Government is in \ncontact with a number of other development agencies for possible financing. So far the World \nBank and the Islamic Development Bank have tentatively proposed $130 million and $127 \nmillion additional financing for housing reconstruction (Table 1). If all these sources of external \nfunding materialize, the Government will be able to recoup a portion of the expenditures already \nincurred. This would imply a net expenditure of $159 million by the Government for housing \nreconstruction. \n  \n36.  The ADB loan will carry an interest of 1% per year and a maturity of 40 years, including \na grace period of 10 years, with repayment of principal at 2% per year during the first 10 years \nafter  the  grace  period  and  4%  per  year  thereafter.  The  Government  will  bear  the  foreign \nexchange risk.   \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Program Management and Coordination \n37.  MOF will be the Executing Agency. The loan will flow to the budget of the Government, \nwhich will contribute funds to ERRA\u2019s account through the budget allocation process. Figure 1 \nprovides a schematic illustration on the flow of housing reconstruction funds. The solid arrows \nindicate  funds  flow,  while  the  dashed  arrows  indicate  information  exchange  or  policy  and \nprocedural  guidance.  ERRA  receives  funding  from  two  sources:  the  Government  budget \nallocation, and direct project financing from development agencies (e.g., ADB\u2019s EEAP). ERRA, \nin turn, provides payments through PERRA and SERRA to the targeted affected people. This \narrangement has two important characteristics. First, all transactions are conducted through \nbank accounts, with no cash changing hands. Second, PERRA and SERRA provide important \nchecking and verification to ensure that the list of affected people is up-to-date and correct. \nFeedback suggests that this approach minimizes potential leaks during transaction, and has \nbeen effective in getting the funds to the targeted affected people.

Individual households carry out housing reconstruction based on the standards and \ndesigns  specified  by  ERRA.  The  subsidy  schemes  are  developed  based  on  the  market \nreplacement value of a typical house size (39 square meters), irrespective of the actual size of \nthe original house. For a completely destroyed house, the payments to the households are \nmade in four installments based on benchmarks of construction progress, i.e., PRs25,000, \nPRs75,000,  PRs25,000,  and  PRs50,000,  for  a  total  of  PRs175,000  (about  $3,000).  For  a \npartially damaged house, the payments are made in two installments, i.e., PRs25,000 and \nPRs50,000, for a total of PRs75,000. For houses with minor damage, the owners will receive \none  payment  of  PRs25,000.  The  payments  are  made  based  on  progress  reports  by  field \ninspectors provided by the Army and NGOs.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n39.  The forward looking implementation period for the Program is 12 months upon loan \neffectiveness.  Housing  reconstruction  will  be  completed  by  30  June  2008.  The  retroactive \nfinancing support proposed will cover part of the past housing reconstruction expenses incurred \nby the Government. \n \n ", "12    \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement \n40.  The loan will be released in two tranches on a quick-disbursing basis. It is proposed that \na  first  tranche  of  $200  million  equivalent  be  provided  for  retroactive  financing  of  housing \nreconstruction expenditures incurred and paid for by the Government after the earthquake (8 \nOctober 2005). In disbursement terms, the Government\u2019s own spending thus far accounts for \n64% of the $584.2 million disbursed through end-March 2007 by ERRA. The proceeds from the \nfirst tranche would enable the Government to provide the cash for the payment of the third \nhousing installment or reimbursement of Government\u2019s payments of housing subsidies under \nthe R&R program. The second tranche of the loan (i.e., the remaining proceeds in the loan \naccount) is expected to be released within six months of the release of the first tranche, subject \nto compliance with a set of performance targets. These performance targets or benchmarks as \nconditions for releasing the second tranche, as established and agreed upon between the \nGovernment and ADB after extensive consultations, are as follows: \n \n(i)  ERRA has paid the third installment of the housing subsidy to 85% of the eligible \nhouseholds5 and provided the related FMRs and other documents as evidence of \nthe payment; \n(ii)  an unqualified audit opinion on ERRA\u2019s financial statements for FY2007 has \nbeen submitted to ADB; \n(iii)  the Government has provided training facilities to enable the start of the training \nprogram for households under the attached TA project; and \n(iv)  consultants  have  been  awarded  the  contract  for  the  legal  assistance, \ngovernance, and institutional building component under the EEAP. \n \n41.  For each tranche, the Government will submit a withdrawal application supported by \nnecessary documents. For the first tranche, such withdrawal application will be accompanied by (i) a \nFinancial Monitoring Report (FMR) for the quarter ended 31 March 2007 indicating that the amount \nof eligible expenditures paid for by the Government during the period from 8 October 2005 to 31 \nMarch 2007 is greater than the amount of the requested withdrawal, and (ii) a certificate of the \nGovernment  confirming  that  the  FMR  is  correct.    For  the  second  tranche,  such  withdrawal \napplication will be accompanied by (i)  the most recent FMR indicating the amount of eligible \nexpenditures paid for by the Government during the period from 1 April 2007 to  the end of the \nquarter to which the FMR relates, (ii) a certificate of the Government confirming that the amount \nreferred to in the FMR plus the projected eligible expenditures for the remaining period exceed the \namount of the requested withdrawal; and (iii) documents evidencing that the conditions for the \naforementioned second tranche release have been met. The Government Account No.1 at the \nState Bank of Pakistan (used for the quick disbursing component of the previous EEAP loan) \nwill  serve  as  the  deposit  account  for  which  all  withdrawals  from  the  loan  account  will  be \ndeposited. The deposit account   will   be managed in accordance with terms and conditions \nsatisfactory to ADB.  The Government will transfer an amount equal to the eligible expenditures \nprojected for the remaining Program period and received as part of the second tranche to ERRA\u2019s \naccount at the National Bank of Pakistan within 60 days of the release of the second tranche.  ADB \nwill reserve the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s certification.  \n \n42.  If ADB determines at any time that any portion of the second tranche remains unutilized by \nthe end of the Program, or any payment out of the loan proceeds was made for any ineligible \nexpenditure, or was not justified by the evidence furnished to ADB, the Government will, promptly \n                                                 \n5 Households whose houses were completely destroyed by the earthquake and who have received the second \ninstallment and are entitled to the third and fourth installments. ", "  13\nupon notice from ADB, provide such additional evidence as ADB may request, or refund to ADB the \nunutilized amount of the Loan proceeds and the amounts of such ineligible payments. The unutilized \namounts will be credited to the Loan Account for cancellation. \n \n43.  The loan proceeds will be used for financing the housing reconstruction program. This \nwill be implemented through providing subsidy or direct payments to individual households who \nwill procure needed materials and reconstruct their own houses.  \n \n4.  Anticorruption Policy \n44.  ADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Program. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB's Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  Program.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection with the Program shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service provides as they relate to the Program. ERRA will publicly \ndisclose on its Web site the program-related information, including information on the release of \nfunds to the intended beneficiaries, applicable procedures, financial statements, procurement \ncontract awards, subproject selection criteria, funding commitment by development partners, \nbasic details on bidding procedures adopted, amount of contract awarded, land acquisition, \nrelocation, and compensation program under the resettlement plans, the list of goods and/or \nservices purchased, and their intended and actual utilization.,. \n \n45.  As  described  in  para.46,  the  strong  financial  management  system,  accounting  and \nauditing procedures, and M&E mechanisms put in place under the earthquake R&R program \nwill be maintained. Under the financial management system, all transactions for the Program \nare made through bank accounts (Figure 1), with no cash changing hands. Feedback suggests \nthat, while this system might not root out corruption completely, it has minimized potential leaks \nin the system and proved effective in getting the payments to the targeted households.  \n \n5.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n46.  With the support provided by development partners, strong accounting, auditing, and \nreporting procedures have been established for the earthquake R&R program (Appendix 3). \nQuarterly FMRs are being prepared on the use of funds by source, i.e., Government budget \nrelease, World Bank, ADB, and other development agencies. The FMRs, which have been well \nreceived by the development partners, form a primary basis for the World Bank to release its \nfunds for housing reconstruction. In addition, AGP conducts annual audits for the earthquake \nR&R program with ADB support through EEAP. The development partners have accepted these \nas valid third-party audits. The first audit report for FY2006 shows that the results are generally \nsatisfactory. It also made some recommendations for continued improvement, which have been \nimplemented to the satisfaction of the development partners.  \n \n6.  Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n47.  With  significant  support  from  the  development  partners,  ERRA  has  established  a \ncomprehensive program performance monitoring system, namely, the Earthquake Monitoring \nand Evaluation Framework (EMEF), which comprises 27 full-time staff stationed at federal, \n ", "14    \nprovince/state,  and  district  level.  The  Program  performance  will  be  monitored  through  the \nEMEF.  ERRA will regularly examine and update EMEF in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines for \npreparing  a  design  and  monitoring  framework,6 ERRA  will,  within  6  months  of  the  loan   \neffectiveness,  recruit  an  independent  firm  to  carry  out  monitoring  and  data  collection  and \nanother independent firm to conduct annual evaluation of the Program   \n \n48.  ERRA will provide progress reports to ADB on a quarterly basis, i.e., on or before 30 \nSeptember,  31  December,  31  March,  and  30  June  throughout  the  Program  period.  The \nprogress report will include, among others, number of eligible households who have received \nthe third and fourth payments, number of houses completed are compliant with ERRA seismic \ndesigns  and  standards,  number  of  landless  eligible  households  who  have  received  the \nsubsidies for land acquisition, implementation of Gender and Vulnerability Action Plan (GVAP), \nand problems encountered during implementation and actions taken to address the problems.   \n \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n49.  Building on the ongoing TA7 attached to EEAP, a TA entitled Capacity Building for \nInstitutions Related to Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation will be attached to the \nProgram. The TA project is estimated to cost the equivalent of $2,500,000. ADB will provide \n$2,000,000, from PEF on a grant basis. ERRA will be the Executing Agency. However, the TA \nwill provide additional support for all the institutions related to the earthquake R&R program in \nkey areas as deemed necessary. The support will include (i) community-based training on \nseismic  standards  and  construction  monitoring  techniques;  (ii)  financial  and  strategic \nmanagement;  and  (iii)  environmental  and  social  protection  (emphasizing  gender  and \nvulnerability aspects of social protection). Special attention will be paid to capacity building at \nthe provincial or state and district levels. \n \n50.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  are  in  Appendix  4,  and  a  separate \nprocurement plan has been prepared as a supplementary appendix (available upon request). \nThe proposed TA is to be implemented over 36 months from July 2007 to July 2010. Consulting \nservices will include 6 person-months international consultants8 and 325 person-months of \nnational consultants. Consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended from time-to-time). All equipment will be procured \nfollowing the ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time-to-time). The TA will \nbe used mostly to support the ongoing training and the environmental and social protection \nprogram, which has been conducted by a number of civil organizations, including National Rural \nSupport Programme and Sarhad Rural Support Programme. As such, single-source selection of \nthe consultants is proposed to ensure the continuity of the training, as well as the environmental \nand social protection programs; and to take advantage of their experience in these activities. \nSingle-source selection also will be conducive for the timely execution of the TA project to \nsupport the housing reconstruction program, which is expected to be completed by May 2008. \nAdministration of the TA will be delegated to Pakistan Resident Mission. \n \n                                                 \n6 ADB.  2006.

", "  15\nV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Socioeconomic Impacts and Protection of Vulnerable Groups \n51.  The main socioeconomic impact will be the restoration and improvement of the livelihood \nof the people. This includes provision of seismically compliant housing for the earthquake-\ndisplaced people and students. Most of them still live either in tents or temporary shelters. \nRestoration of the physical infrastructure will lead to economic recovery of NWFP and AJK, \ncharacterized by faster economic growth and more opportunities for the poor and socially \nvulnerable. The reconstruction of infrastructure also will create many jobs for skilled workers in \nthe construction industry. Due to the increased demand, the region is facing a shortage of such \nskilled workers. Similarly, reconstruction is having positive effects on the local construction \nmaterials industry, moderately increasing the prices of the key construction materials such as \ncement. \n \n52.  The earthquake has shifted gender roles of women and men in the earthquake-affected \nareas. Due to the loss of male partners, some of the women\u2019s responsibilities have increased as \nthey assume the additional burden of caring for orphaned children and persons with disabilities, \nwhile  also emerging  as  heads  of  households.  In  NWFP,  women  head  more  than  23%  of \nhouseholds compared with 31% in AJK. This new reality requires rethinking social conditioning, \nas well as the type of contributions that members of the household and the community can \nmake. In particular, stakeholders report that women-headed households, widows, and orphaned \nchildren (mostly girls) have had little access to supplies and services due to their limited mobility \nor absence of proper identity documents to support these claims. A GVAP has been prepared \nand will be implemented. It aims to ensure that essential needs, constraints, and priorities \nvoiced by women, and extremely vulnerable individuals and families, are reflected in the design \nof the Program and monitored during loan implementation. \n \n53.  ERRA and the reconstruction agencies at the provincial and district levels, supported by \nthe ADB, UNDP, and United Nations Human Resettlements Programme have tried to provide \nspecial assistance to vulnerable groups, including cash assistance and a livelihood restoration \nprogram. A comprehensive Social Protection Strategy has been developed with assistance from \ndevelopment agencies and NGOs. The strategy aims to ensure vulnerable groups are provided \nwith basic social services, livelihood assistance, and support for rehabilitation, primarily within \ntheir own families and communities. It also strives to establish links with the mainstream social \nwelfare structures and services. ADB\u2019s earthquake team will continue to work with ERRA, \nparticularly its social and environmental safeguards team, and other development partners in \nidentifying and  addressing  the  needs  of  vulnerable  groups.  ERRA  is  discussing  with  ADB \nfinancing for the activities of identifying and addressing the needs of the vulnerable groups from \nresources available from EEAP. Additional resources will be available from the attached TA \nproject for meeting the needs of vulnerable groups (Section IV and Appendix 4).  \n \n ", "16    \nB.  Safeguards Issues \n1.  Environment \n54.  The  Program  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B9 in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002). An environmental assessment and review framework (EARF) was \nprovided under EEAP for the infrastructure sectors covered by the Program, including the \neducation sector. As the Program will target primarily rural housing reconstruction, Appendix 7 \nprovides an initial environmental examination (IEE) for housing reconstruction.  \n \n55.  The environmental damage caused by the earthquake, particularly on natural resources \nsuch as forests, water bodies, and natural habitats, was severe. The environmental impacts of \nreconstruction activities, particularly the housing reconstruction supported by the Program, are \nexpected  to  be  moderate.  In  housing  reconstruction,  the  environmental  impacts  will  be \nassociated primarily with improper site selection (in landslide-prone areas); excessive use of \ntimber for house reconstruction; and improper design of drainage and hygienic systems of \nhouses, causing waste discharge into water bodies. As described in the IEE, ERRA is enforcing \na strict zoning code for housing reconstruction. Construction of houses in the \u201cred\u201d zone is \nprohibited. Furthermore, environmental monitoring conducted by ERRA indicates that most \nhouse owners recycled timber materials from their damaged houses, and tree cutting for house \nbuilding was minimal. Continuous environmental monitoring and implementation of necessary \nmitigation measures by ERRA, as outlined in the Environmental Monitoring and Management \nPlan in the IEE, will be essential to minimizing the potential adverse impact. \n \n56.  Environmental  monitoring  and  management  requires  a  comprehensive  strategy  and \ninstitutional capacities. With coordinated assistance from its development partners, ERRA has \ndeveloped such a comprehensive environmental strategy. The main objective of the strategy is \nto address the damage to the environment caused by the earthquake, and to mainstream \nenvironmental concerns in all sectors of R&R activity. In addition, as assisted by ADB and other \ndevelopment partners (in conjunction with AusAID and UNDP), a strong team of environment \nspecialists has been recruited and trained on national and ADB environmental management \npolicies, procedures, and environmental assessment and monitoring techniques. The attached \nTA project will provide additional support, if needed, for conducting environmental safeguards \nreview and reporting (Section IV and Appendix 4). \n \n2.  Land Acquisition \n57.  In the housing sector, approximately 1% of damaged rural houses (i.e., about 6,000 \nhouses) require new sites for reconstruction, as landslides have destroyed the original sites. \nHowever,  these  6,000  households,  or  30,000  people,  are  considered  \u201cinternally  displaced \npeople\u201d whose displacement was caused by the natural disaster rather than ADB\u2019s operations. \nIn this case, the Program will aim to build seismically compliant and (in many cases) better \nhouses for these people. The Government will provide PRs75,000 for each displaced household \nto purchase land for the new houses at the market, although the Government will not be directly \ninvolved in the transactions (i.e., no involuntary land acquisition). ADB\u2019s policy on Involuntary \nResettlement (1995) will not apply in this case. However, as ADB\u2019s funding may be used for \nland purchases, it is necessary to ensure that such land purchases comply with ADB and the \n                                                 \n9 There are four environmental categories, i.e., A, B, C, and FI, in accordance with the level of adverse environmental \nimpact. A project will be categorized as B if it is likely to have adverse environmental impact, but of lesser degree \nthan those for category A projects.   ", "  17\nGovernment environmental, social, and governance guidelines and the Guidelines for Land \nAcquisition by Private Households as agreed by ADB and the Government (Appendix 8). ADB \nwill continue to provide special assistance, including temporary shelters for these people.10 \n \n3.  Indigenous Peoples \n58.  In NWFP, a few earthquake-affected communities are tribal. The Program is likely to \nbenefit the tribal communities through the construction of seismically compliant houses.  \n \nC.  Risks, Mitigation Measures, and Assumptions \n59.  The main risks facing the Program include (i) natural risks, such as another earthquake \nbefore completion of the reconstruction program; (ii) fiduciary risks, e.g., corruption; and (iii) \nmarket risks, e.g., a major escalation in the costs of construction materials due to increased \ndemand. The real possibility of another earthquake in the near future increases the urgency to \ncomplete  the  seismically  compliant  housing  building  program  promptly.  The  Program  will \nprovide expedited and flexible financing to help achieve this. Fiduciary risk has been a main \nconcern for the Government and its development partners, which jointly have put in place strong \nfinancial  management  and  reporting  mechanisms,  as  well  as  M&E  capacities.  ERRA  has \nmonitored closely the risk of price escalation, and the increases have been acceptable so far. \nHowever, further delays in reconstruction could expose the Program to larger price escalations.  \n \n60.  The key assumptions underlying the success of the Program and, to an extent, the entire \nR&R program include (i) the Government and development agencies will allocate adequate \nresources  for  reconstruction  in  all  sectors;  (ii)  seismic  standards  are  strictly  enforced,  (iii) \nalternative  sites  can  be  found  for  houses  whose  original  sites  have  been  destroyed  by \nlandslides; and (iv) most affected households will use the compensation money for housing \nreconstruction, and they will have enough savings to finance expansion beyond the minimum \nliving area supported by the Government compensation.  \n \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n61.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Counterpart Obligations. The Government will ensure that all necessary funds, \nfacilities, services, and other resources in addition to the ADB loan are allocated are \nreleased in a timely manner to ERRA, and the line departments in AJK and NWFP \nthroughout the entire Program.  \n \n(ii)  Housing  Reconstruction.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  environmental \nmonitoring and management plan set out in the IEE is fully implemented to meet the \nseismic  designs  and  safety  standards  in  rural  housing  reconstruction,  and  the \n                                                 \n10 A Resettlement Framework was prepared under ADB\u2019s earlier EEAP for the infrastructure sectors included. \nHowever, due to the slow progress in implementation, no resettlement plan has been prepared. To prepare for the \nexpected acceleration of implementation, ADB is currently conducting training for the implementing agencies on \nADB\u2019s environment and social protection policies and procedures. \n \n ", "18    \nGuidelines for Land Acquisition by Private Households are fully implemented during \nthe Program. \n \n(iii)  Gender and Vulnerable People. The Government will ensure that ERRA adopts \nthe GVAP developed for the Program and implements it in a timely manner over \nthe entire Program period. The Government will ensure that adequate resources \nare  allocated  for  this  purpose,  the  implementation  of  the  plan  is  closely \nmonitored, and the progress is reported in the quarterly reports to ADB. \n \n(iv)  Good Governance and Transparency. The Government will ensure that ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) is followed throughout Program \nimplementation and acknowledges that ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly \nor through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive or coercive practices \nrelating to the Program.  The Government will allow ADB representatives to carry out \nspot  or  random  checks  on  the  flow  of  funds.  The  Government  shall  allow \nindependent auditors, acceptable to ADB, to undertake performance audits on a \nrandom basis to review the Program implementation. \n \nERRA will publicly disclose on the website the on the website the Program related \ninformation, including among other things, information on the release of funds to the \nintended  beneficiaries,  applicable  procedures,  financial  statements,  and  loan \nutilization. Likewise, national and provincial or state  newspapers in the English, \nPushtoo, and Urdu languages shall carry such details on a regular basis, at least \nonce a month. Similarly, television and radio broadcasts shall be made in these \nlanguages broadcasts at national and provincial or state levels giving these same \ndetails. \n \n(v)  Accounting, Audit and Financial Management. The Government will maintain \nexisting accounting and audit procedures, and the financial management system \nestablished  under  the  EEAP  to  ensure  efficient  and  economic  use  of  the  ADB \nfinancing proceeds. Accounts and financial statements in relation to the Program will \nbe prepared and certified by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. \n \nB.  Condition for Loan Effectiveness \n62.  In addition to standard conditions (execution of the loan agreement and submission of a \nlegal opinion, satisfactory to ADB), the Government will grant appropriate approvals for the Loan \nand the TA, and submit a duly signed TA Letter of Agreement to ADB. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n63.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank and recommend that the Board approve: \n \n(i)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 263,875,000  \nto  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Earthquake-Displaced  People \nLivelihood Restoration Program, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an \ninterest charge at the rate of 1% per annum, and repayment of principal at 2% \nper annum for the first 10 years after the grace period and 4% per annum \nthereafter; a term of 40 years, including a grace period of 10 years; and such \nother terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth \nin the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board;  ", "  19\n(ii)  waiver of the requirements for a 12 week processing period, that quick-disbursing \ncomponents finance a list of imports, and that no more than 30% of the loan \nproceeds be used for retroactive financing of expenditures, all under the Disaster \nand  Emergency  Assistance  Policy  (2004)  and  as  discussed  more  fully  in \nparagraph 23 of this Report. \n \n \n \n \n     \n   \n   \n  Haruhiko Kuroda  \n  President \n \n \n6 June 2007 \n ", "20   Appendix 1   \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance Indicators  Data Source  Assumptions and Risks \nand Targets  and/or \nMonitoring \nMechanisms \nImpact  By the end of 2013: a     \n      Assumptions \nRestoration and  GDP for NWFP will increase  Statistical books and  \u2022 Government and \nimprovement of the  from 5.6% in 2005 to 6.5% in  other official and  development agencies \nlivelihood for the  2013  international sources  allocate adequate \nearthquake-displaced      resources for reconstruction \npeople in NWFP and AJK  % of houses with burnt bricks or  ERRA\u2019s monitoring  in other sectors  \nblocks for walls in NWFP  and evaluation  \u2022 Macroeconomic and \nincreased from 49% in 2004 to  reports  security conditions \n70% in 2013    favorable for economic \n  Validation by third- development \n  party monitors   \nengaged by ERRA  Risks \n\u2022 Another earthquake may \noccur before 2013 \nOutcome  By the end of 2010:     \n      Risks \nMost earthquake- At least 85% of the 3.5 million   ERRA\u2019s monitoring  \u2022 Another earthquake may \ndisplaced people will live  affected people will move into  and evaluation  occur before 2010 \nin seismically compliant  seismically compliant houses  reports   \nhouses      \n  Of the people who have moved  Validation by third-\n  into the seismically compliant  party monitors \nhouses, more than 23% in  engaged by ERRA \nNWFP and 31% in AJK of the   \nhouseholds will be headed by   \nwomen   \nOutputs       \n      Assumption \n1.Seismically compliant  By June 2010, 85% of the  ERRA\u2019s monitoring  \u2022 Government will fulfill its \nhouses completed  585,000 rural houses will be  and evaluation  assistance that it will \nwithout major delays  rebuilt and are seismically  reports  allocate enough funds from \n  compliant     its budget for housing \n2.

The 8 October 2005 earthquake that hit northern Pakistan was the most devastating in \nthe nation\u2019s history, with the official death toll at more than 80,000. Immediately after the \nearthquake, at the request of the Government of Pakistan (the Government), a mission led by \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and World Bank conducted a preliminary damage needs \nassessment  (PDNA).  This  mission  was  supported  by  other  development  partners  and \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  including  United  Nations  Development  Programme \n(UNDP), European Union  (EU), United States Agency for International Development (USAID), \nDepartment  for  International  Development  DFID,  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation/Japan International Cooperation Agency (JBIC/JICA), Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr \nTechnische Zusammenarbeit (German Agency for Technical Cooperation, GTZ), Kreditanstalt \nf\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  (KFW),  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  and  Food  and  Agriculture \nOrganization  (FAO)  conducted  a  preliminary  damage  needs  assessment  (PDNA).  \nRepresentatives of the Government and the Governments of North-West Frontier Province \n(NWFP)  and  Azad  Jammu  and  Kashmir  (AJK)  participated  on  the  sector  teams.  The \nassessment estimated the damage and reconstruction costs of the earthquake that struck areas \nof NWFP and AJK, and the related economic implications of the event. An assessment also was \nmade of the emerging needs of the affected communities that would be reflected in the medium- \nto  longer-term  reconstruction  and  recovery  phases  following  the  initial  relief  efforts.  This \nincluded (i) guiding principles for reconstruction in each sector, and (ii) reconstruction strategies \nunderpinned by those guiding principles. A significant issue was the lack of good baseline data. \n \n2.  The data presented in the PDNA are based on government sources, team research, and \na field assessment conducted by consultants to ensure adequate coverage and verification of \naffected areas. The PDNA estimated the total reconstruction cost at more than $3.5 billion. This \nestimate has been revised and refined as access to remote damaged areas has improved; as \ndetailed  sector  strategies  were  developed;  and  as  development  partners,  including  ADB, \nconfirmed their portfolios. \n \n3.  In summary, the PDNA identified the reconstruction costs for the sectors in which ADB is \nengaged (or might be engaged): (i) housing, $1,552 million; (ii) education, $472 million; (iii)  \ntransport, $416 million; (iv) health, $303 million; and (v) power, $30 million. Some crosscutting \nthemes, including social aspects, were identified but not costed. Some sectors subsequently \nwere identified, including the social sector in which ADB has a small engagement. \n \nB.  Responses by the Government and International Communities \n4.  With strong support from the international community, the Government has adopted a \n\u201cBuilding  Back  Better\u201d  strategy,  which  aims  to  rebuild  infrastructure  to  post-earthquake \nstandards,  and  develop  improved  policy  and  institutional  frameworks.  The  Earthquake \nReconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority (ERRA) was established to oversee and monitor the \noverall  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  (R&R)  program.  It  is  supported  by  two  regional \nbranches:  Provincial  Earthquake  Reconstruction  and  Rehabilitation  Agency  (PERRA)  for \nNWFP, and State Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Agency (SERRA) for AJK. \nThese, in turn, are supported by district reconstruction units (DRU) at the district level. A \nseparate agency was created to coordinate earthquake reconstruction, because the capacities \nof the existing government agencies were considered too weak to handle the enormous R&R ", "      Appendix 2  23\ntasks.  Other  measures  designed  to  improve  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  the  R&R \nprogram include (i) strengthening the decision making and implementation capacities in the two \naffected  provinces/states,  using  simplified  approval  and  implementation  procedures;  (ii) \nensuring the R&R program meets appropriate safety, quality, technological, and environmental \nstandards; and (iii) establishing transparent procedures and allowing third-party monitoring..  \n \n5.  During the donor conference of 19 November 2005, aid agencies pledged more than \n$6.6 million in loans and grants. As part of these efforts, ADB committed $1 billion in the form of \nconcessional loans and grants to support the reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts of the \nGovernment. An estimated $4.4 billion of the total pledges of $6.6 billion have been turned into \nformal commitments, including $2.2 billion as grants. Bilateral grants totaled about $1.8 billion of \nthe committed amount. \n \n6.  On 14 November 2005, ADB approved its first package of assistance, totaling $185 \nmillion. This included (i) reallocation of $105 million from loan savings under various ongoing \nloans, of which $85 million was disbursed as budgetary support; and (ii) the establishment of \nPakistan Earthquake Fund (PEF), supported by an initial grant of $80 million from ADB. On 13 \nDecember  2005,  ADB  approved  the  follow-up  Earthquake  Emergency  Assistance  Project \n(EEAP) for $300 million, consisting of a PEF grant of $80 million and a loan of $220 million from \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  Resources.  These  operations  raised  ADB\u2019s  contribution  for  the \nreconstruction effort to $405 million. This amount does not include $5 million in grant project \nfinancing from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, and reallocated funds equivalent to $62.5 \nmillion from several other ADB-financed projects. In addition, the Office of Cofinancing and the \nPakistan  Resident  Mission  worked  together  to  mobilize  approximately  $97  million  in  grant \nfunding as contributions to PEF (by Norway and Belgium) and EEAP. \n  \nC.  Update  on  Damage  Assessment  and  the  Earthquake  Reconstruction  and \nRehabilitation Program  \n7.  Due to the time constraint and inaccessibility of some remote earthquake-affected areas, \nthe preliminary damage assessment inevitably contained inaccuracies. It has been revised and \nupdated with the progress of the R&R program and improved access to the remote areas. This \nsection provides an update of the damage assessment and progress made in the R&R program \non a sector-by-sector basis.  \n \n1.  Power \n8.  The PDNA for reconstruction of the power infrastructure was estimated at $30.81 million, \nwhich included reconstruction and rehabilitation of nine hydropower stations, 10 grid stations, \ntransmission and distribution lines, meters, and service cables. It also covered the provision of \nelectricity to relief tent villages and field hospitals. ERRA\u2018s Reconstruction and Rehabilitation \nStrategy for the Power Sector (undated) estimated the reconstruction cost at $40.11 million, \ncompared with the initial PDNA estimate of $30.81 million. ADB is fully funding the power \nsector, which has no funding gap. While the overall performance in the power sector has been \npartly satisfactory, all transmission and distribution lines have been restored and more than 50 \ncontracts have been awarded. \n \n2.  Transport \n9.  The PDNA estimated the costs for reconstruction of transport infrastructure, including \nroads and bridges, at $416 million. This included reconstruction and rehabilitation of 4,623 \n ", "24   Appendix 2 \nkilometers of national highways and other roads. Subsequently, Earthquake\u2019s Reconstruction \nand  Rehabilitation  Agency\u2019s  (ERRA\u2018s)  Reconstruction  and  Rehabilitation  Strategy  for  the \nTransport Sector (undated) increased the length of damaged roads and bridges to 6,403 km. \nThe total cost of reconstruction of all the affected roads and bridges was increased to $458 \nmillion (including $69 million for national highways). The PDNA underestimated the degree of \ndamage and the cost of repair for many of the road segments. Furthermore, the damage has \nworsened over time due to effects of extreme weather, and further deterioration due to lack of \nmaintenance and timely reconstruction.  \n \n10.  In March 2007, ERRA decreased the length of damaged roads to 6,305 km, and the cost \nof reconstruction and rehabilitation of all the affected roads and bridges was revised downward \nto $436 million (including $100 million for national highways). As only $257 million is currently \navailable, the funding gap is $179 million. The government of AJK is reassessing the extent of \nthe damage. The current engineer\u2019s estimates are based on on-the-ground realities, and exceed \nthe estimates by 300%\u2013500% in some instances. The current fund probably will not cover the \nreconstruction and repair activities originally envisaged. Equally apparent, the reconstruction \ncosts in AJK are twice the unit costs in NWFP.  \n \n11.  ADB is the major funding agency for the reconstruction of provincial and state roads. \nJICA is providing government counterpart funding for the ADB loan. The other partners in \nreconstruction of roads are the DFID, Government of Germany, and World Bank. \n \n12.  The overall performance in the transport sector was initially unsatisfactory. The road \nplanning, procurement, and contract procedures often can take 6 months. These procedures \nhave been streamlined, and the contract awards have increased substantially. As of March \n2007, contracts have been awarded for 166 km of roads (of 1,377 kilometers) in NWFP and 68 \nkilometers of roads (of 755 kilometers) in AJK in ADB\u2019s road portfolio. \n \n3.  Health \n13.  The PDNA estimated the costs for reconstruction of the health sector at $303 million for \nAJK and NWFP. In all, 574 health facilities in nine districts of AJK and NWFP were reported fully \nor partially damaged. The PDNA also identified another 110 health facilities in the earthquake-\naffected districts that needed to be assessed for safety against possible future seismic activity in \nthe area, although these were not damaged during the earthquake. \n \n14.  Subsequently, ERRA\u2018s Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Strategy for the Health Sector \n(undated) reported that 388 health facilities were destroyed, 197 needed retrofitting, and 211 \nneeded to be assessed. The strategy identified 237 health facilities for reconstruction, 105 \npartially  damaged  facilities  for  retrofitting,  and  110  undamaged  facilities  for  structural \nassessment. The total cost of reconstruction and rehabilitation was estimated at $305 million, \nbroadly consistent with the PDNA estimate. \n \n15.  In late March 2007, ERRA identified 305 health facilities for reconstruction (excluding 37 \ncivil dispensaries to be reconstructed in the third year). The cost of reconstruction is now \nestimated at $240 million (excluding civil dispensaries). The number of health facilities funded \nfor  reconstruction  is  266  (253  confirmed  and  13  tentative  pledges),  leaving  a  gap  of  39. \nCurrently, $226 million is available, leaving a funding gap of $13.5 million.  \n \n16.  ADB is among a number of development partners providing assistance in the sector, \nincluding JICA, United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and USAID. While implementation ", "      Appendix 2  25\nprogress has been relatively slow, all health facilities are operational through the use of interim \nstructures.  In  2006\u20132007,  a  total  of  165  health  facilities  are  planned  for  reconstruction. \nAdditional 28 facilities are being planned, including those scheduled for reconstruction in 2008; \n142 are being procured; eight are under construction; and four have been completed and \nhanded over for operation. \n \n4.  Education \n17.  The PDNA estimated that 6,232 education buildings in nine districts of AJK and NWFP \nwere  reported  fully  or  partially  damaged,  including  private  institutions.  The  cost  for \nreconstruction of the education sector was estimated at $472 million. Subsequently, ERRA\u2018s \nReconstruction and Rehabilitation Strategy for the Education Sector (February 2006) reported a \ndecreased number of damaged institutions i.e., 5,344. As ADB\u2019s EEAP team confirmed its \nportfolio in conjunction with ERRA and the governments of AJK and NWFP, the number of \ndamaged  government  education  institutions  increased  to  6,472  from  5,344  in  ERRA\u2018s \nReconstruction and Rehabilitation Strategy. The cost of reconstruction is estimated at $1,158 \nmillion. The number of schools with committed funding for reconstruction is 2,599 at a cost of \n$512 million, leaving 3,873 schools in need of financing or a funding gap of $646 million.  \n \n18.  ADB is among a number of development partners, including JICA, UNICEF, and USAID, \nproviding funding for the reconstruction of the education sector. Implementation progress has \nbeen slow. In 2006\u20132007, 1,574 educational facilities are planned for reconstruction, of which \n956 have been allocated to development partners and NGOs, and 752 to the Government. \nContracts for reconstruction of more than 100 schools have been awarded, more than 30 \nschools have been completed, and another 200 schools are in different stages of contract \nawards. However, this pace will not be fast enough to reconstruct the 6,472 schools and related \ninstitutions in a reasonable time frame. The main reasons for the delay is (i) the long planning \nand approval process; (ii) the major gap in the capacity of the Government institutions to \nimplement  this  large  portfolio;  and,  most  importantly,  (iii)  the  lack  of  free  capacity  in  the \ncontracting industry to construct this large and disbursed portfolio of education institutions.  \n \n5.  Livelihood Support and Housing Reconstruction \n19.  Progress has been most significant in housing reconstruction. The PDNA estimated total \nfinancing needs for housing reconstruction will be $1.55 billion. As of 31 March 2007, about \n$890 million had been disbursed for reconstruction of damaged and destroyed houses as \nhousing grants through four installments ($416, $1,250, $416, and $834, respectively). The \nfunds have been disbursed to about 585,000 rural households in 290 union councils in NWFP \nand AJK. This includes a portfolio of 463,000 households managed by ERRA (expected cost \n$1.111  billion  at  100%  completion),  and  122,000  households  being  managed  by  Pakistan \nPoverty  Alleviation  Fund  (expected  cost  of  $281  million  at  100%  completion).  All  affected \nhouseholds have received the first installment, 97% have received the second installment, and \n21%  have  received  the  third  installment.  The  fourth  installment  has  not  been  disbursed, \nsignifying that a majority of houses has not been completed and most people still are living in \ntemporary shelters. \n \n20.  The World Bank has been a major financier for livelihood support ($80 million cash \ngrants for food and other basic needs) and housing reconstruction in addition to Government\u2019s \nfinancing through budget contribution. Some development partners, including DFID and the \nIslamic Development Bank, also have contributed to the financing of housing reconstruction by \nproviding support to the Government\u2019s central budget or providing program financing to ERRA.  \n ", "26   Appendix 2 \n \n21.  The relatively fast progress in housing reconstruction has benefited from a number of \nadvantages in the sector. One key advantage was the lack of existing systems or institutions in \nplace, which offered the opportunity to design and implement processes and systems from \nscratch. The second advantage was the immediate mobilization of thousands of trained and \nmobile Army personnel, supported by international NGOs, in more than 600 teams for housing \ninspections, certification of payments, quality control, monitoring, and training of households in \nseismically compliant construction. The third key advantage was the design of the program, \nwhich was owner-driven, based on subsidies and direct fund transfers to beneficiaries using in \nsitu construction. In situ and owner-driven construction has been an efficient way of addressing \nthe immediate housing issue. However, this approach has weakened quality control, and has \nincreased the burden on the other sector services that will follow housing construction (due to \nhighly dispersed house locations). Much more extensive and costly infrastructure might have to \nbe built to provide social and utility services.  \n \n6.  Legal Assistance Targeting Vulnerable Groups \n22.  The PDNA did not provide a cost estimate for a social protection program. In April 2006, \nADB  fielded  an  inception  mission  to  identify  interventions  related  to  legal  assistance  to \nearthquake-affected people. This mission developed an \u201cintervention matrix\u201d, comprising a wide \nrange of activities to be financed with an outlay of $3.6 million for social protection of the \nearthquake-affected population. Those activities include (i) securing legal identity; (ii) securing \npublic  records;  (iii)  dedicating  courts  for  family  and  property  matters;  (iv)  supporting  land \nentitlements;  and  (v)  raising  legal  awareness,  and  providing  legal  assistance  and  public \ngrievance  redress,  transparency  and  earthquake  data  collection,  capacity  building  for  civil \nsociety organizations, and capacity development for gender and vulnerability mainstreaming for \nERRA at all levels. The matrix was revised in April 2007 after consultation with the main \nstakeholders. New estimates show that the activities for social protection might cost about $5 \nmillion.  \n \n23.  ADB is one of a number of development partners providing funding for social protection. \nInitial progress in social protection has focused on (i) placing social protection coordinators at \nPERRA,  SERRA,  and  DRUs;  (ii)  implementing  projects  targeting  the  rehabilitation  of \ndisabled/paraplegics;  (iii)  commissioning  a  targeted  survey  of  vulnerable  groups,  including \nwidows,  orphans,  the  elderly,  the  landless,  and  the  disabled;  and  (iv)  promoting  the \ndevelopment and approval of a comprehensive strategy to support the landless. \n \n7.  Institutional and Governance Structure \n24.  ERRA was established in 2005 through a presidential notification in response to the 8 \nOctober  2005  earthquake.  After  a  long  gestation  period,  ERRA  is  now  well  established. \nStrategies for all sectors, including housing, livelihood, health, education, sponsorship schemes, \ntransport, power, and government buildings, have been developed and approved, with active \nsupport and participation of ADB and other partners. Most of the staff of the newly established \ninstitutions is in place, and operational procedures in key sectors are functional. \n \n25.  ERRA has developed accounting procedures and financial management guidelines. The \nMinistry of Finance and the Auditor General of Pakistan have reviewed these guidelines, which \nhave been approved. The first external audit of ERRA was conducted for FY2006, and the \nresults were satisfactory. The progress on implementing the recommendations of the auditors, ", "      Appendix 2  27\nwhich  World  Bank,  ADB,  and  other  development  partners  are  jointly  monitoring,  is  also \nsatisfactory.  \n \n8.  Reporting, Monitoring, and Evaluation \n26.  Technical assistance (TA) teams financed by the seven major development partners (G-\n7), including DFID, World Bank, and ADB, have been mobilized. These teams have developed \nthe basic framework and requirements for a harmonized monitoring and evaluation system for \nERRA, and the Emergency Monitoring and Evaluation Framework (EMEF), which is being \nimplemented. EMEF will provide detailed information on progress made in each sector, and will \nidentify problems and bottlenecks hindering progress.  \n \n27.  ERRA  has  established  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  wing  to  spearhead  the \ndevelopment  and  implementation  of  the  EMEF.  The  cell  is  responsible  for  the  external \nmonitoring  of  activities  undertaken  by  the  NGOs,  bilateral  and  multilateral  agencies,  and \ngovernment departments. ERRA\u2019s M&E wing has a presence at the districts through their field \nunits,  which  are  responsible  for  sample  monitoring  and  ensuring  compliance  with  agreed \nbenchmarks and standards. The M&E wing is only collecting data on the performance of the \nhousing and livelihood (cash grant) sectors. DFID also is mobilizing a TA team to strengthen the \nM&E wing of ERRA and augment its technical capacity. \n \n28.  ADB, as a member of the G-7 donors, has been involved extensively in planning and \ndeveloping the EMEF. It has provided technical and financial support to ERRA and the M&E \nwing through grant funding for a number of positions within the M&E wing, along with technical \nadvice on the institutional setup to facilitate the timely implementation of the EMEF and R&R \nactivities. This support comes in form of incremental staff, long-term sector specialists financed \nthrough the TA on Capacity Building for the Office of the Auditor General of Pakistan,1 and \nestablishment of project implementation units.  \n \n29.  The M&E wing is outsourcing monitoring and data collection (MDC) and third-party \nvalidation (TPV) as part of its strategy to implement the EMEF. The MDC component is to \ncollect data and provide information on construction and non-construction (socioeconomic) R&R \nactivities. The data collection, monitoring, and evaluation of R&R activities will be assessed \nagainst  preset  performance  indicators  developed  by  the  M&E  wing  and  reviewed  by \ndevelopment partner agencies. The information generated will feed into a central database for \nanalysis, information dissemination, and the annual TPV. The hiring of the potential firm for \nMDC has been finalized, and will be considered in the next Monitoring & Evaluation Advisory \nCommittee (MEAC) meeting. MEAC oversees the strategic and operational issues of EMEF, \nand has representation from key development partners, including ADB.  \n \n30.  The TPV is to occur annually. This component will use data collected by the MDC to \nevaluate R&R activities. It also will review (i) the performance of the Government earthquake \ninstitutions and implementing agencies (IAs) in managing projects; (ii) the appropriateness of \nprogram design to meet the needs of target groups; (iii) the transition from relief to rehabilitation; \n(iv) the sustainability of the projects; (v) capacity building of Government institutions to manage \nsimilar future eventualities; (vi) the broader impact of the R&R activities on the livelihoods of the \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

Although  bids  were  received  from  a  number  of  firms,  the \nprocurement committee was unable to select a suitable firm for the component in its first round \nof  selection.  While  re-advertisement  processes  for  the  TPV  component  have  started,  the \ninternational hiring process is not expected to be completed before August 2007. In the interim, \nespecially in the period before the second anniversary of the earthquake, G-7 donors have \nagreed to conduct an in-depth review starting June 2007, which will (i) revisit and update the \ndamage needs assessment, (ii) evaluate the performance of the agencies involved in R&R \nactivities, (iii) review the sector strategies and their implementation, and (iv) confirm gaps in \nprogress and funding for each sector. \n  \n31.  ERRA\u2019s health and housing sectors have started collecting and collating project data, \nand are processing monthly progress reports from the field through their IAs. ADB also has \ntaken the lead in assisting ERRA\u2019s planning wing in developing a standardized project reporting \nsystem for the remaining sectors. This system will generate the essential data for progress \nmonitoring, and will establish a baseline for external monitoring and evaluation. With reporting \nformats agreed upon, reporting in most sectors will start by the end of May 2007. \n \nD.  Progress Update on ADB\u2019s EEAP \n32.  ADB\u2019s EEAP grant and loan, important components of the earthquake R&R program, \nwere declared effective on 14 February 2006. The EEAP funding support (now $377.5 million) is \nexpected to help mitigate the effects of the devastating earthquake, revive economic activity, \nand enable people to resume their livelihoods and return to normal life. This will be achieved by \nrehabilitating and reconstructing high-priority infrastructure in the education, health, power, and \nroad sectors. In addition, the EEAP provides TA to these sectors, including support for financial \nmanagement and governance. Of the $377.5 million, $112.5 million was disbursed (quick-\ndisbursing assistance) to finance the unusually high or unexpected expenditures required for \nrehabilitation and reconstruction in the aftermath of the earthquake. \n \n33.  The  overall  performance  of  EEAP  is  generally  satisfactory.  As  of  31  March  2007, \nphysical progress achieved, particularly in immediately repairing the damage to power facilities \nand roads, is 15%. Total contract awards reached 21% and 46%, and disbursements reached \n18% and 46% for the loan and grant, respectively. Progress has been generally satisfactory in \nroads and power components, where many contracts have been awarded. The progress on the \nhealth and education components has been slow, mainly because of the poor response of the \nnational contractors. The progress is expected to improve after hiring of consultants, which is in \nfinal stages. The time lost in procurement would be recouped by packaging works under these \ntwo components into large contracts for international competitive bidding (ICB).  \n \n34.  To support and fill the capacity gaps at the implementation level, as well as for due \ndiligence and safeguards monitoring, ADB has completed the hiring of staff and consultants. \nADB recently started construction of an extended mission building in Muzafarabad. The long-\nterm professional positions were hired using TA 47302 funds and a grant from the Australian \nAgency  for  International  Development  (AusAID)  to  fast  track  the  implementation  of  the \nearthquake portfolio, and to help the IAs develop and process the portfolio in the short term \nusing ADB guidelines and safeguards.  \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Capacity Building for the Office of the \nAuditor General. Manila (TA 4730-PAK, for $2,000,000, approved in December). \n ", "      Appendix 2  29\n \n35.  Most development partners including some bilateral agencies are implementing their \nportfolios directly. ADB is one of the few development partners utilizing \u201cindirect contracting\u201d \nthrough the Government institutions to deliver its earthquake project portfolio. This is a high-risk \nmethodology, especially because some of the Government institutions established in response \nto the earthquake (ERRA, PERRA, and SERRA) are immature, and lack institutional knowledge \nand experience. As the volume of work in most cases is at least double annual portfolios of the \nIAs, it is beyond their existing capacities. All the sectors chosen by ADB have line agencies on \nthe ground, which cannot be bypassed in the interest of ownership and sustainability of the \ninvestment.  Additionally,  all  ADB-financed  sectors  need  extensive  coordination,  planning, \ndesign,  disbursement,  accounting,  and  procurement  procedures  to  be  put  in  place  before \nimplementation can begin.  \n \nE.  Future Prospects and Needs in Housing and Education Sectors \n36.  Despite the progress, many affected people continue to suffer from a lack of basic \nshelter, as well as access to education and health services. Life in the remote earthquake-\naffected areas, particularly during winter, remains extremely difficult. Implementation capacities \nand financial resources show significant gaps. In terms of the overall funding requirement and \nmajor gaps in funding, housing and education sectors are the most significant, followed by \ntransport. \n \n37.  The gaps in the housing sector are more significant due to a large absorption capacity. A \nlack of available funds, if the pipeline commitments are not processed in time, could further \ncurtail progress. Table A2.1 shows that the fund requirement in the rural housing sector ranges \nfrom $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion between low case (85% completion with 73% destroyed houses) \nand high case scenario (98% completion with 80% destroyed houses). Currently, the funding \ngap is estimated between $630 million and $820 million, compared with the proposed pipeline \nfunding of $827 million, including $400 million from ADB. In other words, if all the pipeline \ncommitments materialize, a fund surplus is a possibility. Under such a scenario, the surplus \nfunds could be transferred to other sectors, especially education where the funding gap is $646 \nmillion. However, the limited implementation capacities dictate that at least 2 years will be \nneeded to construct all the schools, if the response to the turnkey pre-engineered approach is \ngood and some capacities are freed up from the housing sector over the next year to provide \nadditional construction capacities.  \n \n38.  In addition to funding needs, some of the key concerns in the housing sector are the lack \nof trained manpower, expected demobilization of some NGOs, funding constraints of some \nbilateral agencies, and withdrawal of the Army\u2014all of which are performing key roles in housing \ninspections, certification of payments based on agreed benchmarks and criteria, quality control, \nmonitoring, and training of households in seismically compliant construction. This gap needs to \nfill with urgency to continue to provide trained manpower, ensure compliance, and fast-track the \nprocessing of housing grants. In addition, provision of credit services is another area requiring \nurgent attention, as the funding being provided (as housing grants) is not always sufficient to \nbuild a house that complies with ERRA standards. In many cases, people cannot complete their \nhouses due to a lack of additional funds required to meet these standards. \n \n39.  Education is another sector with a large financing gap. As shown in Table A2.2, the \nfunding  requirement  in  the  education  sector  is  about  $1.16  billion.  Development  partners, \nincluding ADB, have committed $513 million to construct 2,600 schools.  \n \n ", "30   Appendix 2 \n40.  Based on the review of the situation, ADB and ERRA have concluded that the large \nvolume  of  ongoing  work  in  the  housing  sector  has  fully  utilized  the  capacity  of  domestic \ncontractors. National contractors are not showing interest in the affected areas due to risks \ninvolved in conventional construction (harsh weather conditions, scattered school locations, and \nlimited access due to bad road conditions), and the availability of work under better conditions \nelsewhere in Pakistan. To respond to this situation, ERRA (with ADB support) intends to attract \nadditional capacities internationally through larger packages of middle schools funded by ADB, \nand will undertake ICB on a turnkey basis using a specification for light steel frame pre-\nengineered structures for the reconstruction of middle schools. Consulting services have been \nhired  for  this  activity  and  procurement  documents  have  been  prepared,  which  are  being \nreviewed, using ADB guidelines. This ICB procurement will set the standards and specifications \nfor  future  procurement  in  the  education  sector  for  construction  of  Government  education \ninstitutions, irrespective of funding sources. Although this process has delayed, and to some \nextent has increased the time required for procurement, the construction period is expected to \ndecline and lost time is expected to be regained by following this approach and using multiple \npackages (i.e., using capacities of many international contactors simultaneously).  \n \nF.  Lessons Identified \n41.  Earthquake situations are very dynamic and require adjustments, flexibility, and adaptive \ndecision making. To respond effectively to an emergency portfolio, ADB has to move from \n\u201cbusiness as usual\u201d to a \u201cflexible and efficient response\u201d mode that focuses on procedural and \ntechnical guidance and advice (as with EEAP), as well as offers special flexible procedures, \ndelegation, dedicated legal and procurement support from ADB, and an efficient system of \nprocessing and response.  \n \n42.  In  an  overloaded  emergency  environment,  ring  fencing  an  individual  portfolio  with \nspecial procedures and requirements is extremely challenging, as this increases the overload. \nThe focus should be on strengthening the overall system, including financial, environmental, \nand social safeguards and operational procedures, to manage for overall results, rather than the \nindividual portfolios of funding agencies. This could include designing a more flexible overall \nsystem focused financial products that can respond effectively to emergency needs. \n \n43.  Establishing new institutions to handle the earthquake portfolio has been a very time-\nconsuming and difficult process, and has created a lot of confusion regarding the roles and \nresponsibilities of the existing IAs. With the roles of these new institutions now consolidated, \nattention is refocused on IAs, which need urgent support, resources, and clarity of role.  \n \n44.  Building and acquiring additional capacities has been by far the biggest challenge in the \nimplementation of the earthquake portfolio. To address this issue, the policy to tap resources \nfrom outside the affected areas at market rates and to attract international resources where \nrequired, must be revised. \n \n45.  The  volumes  of  the  earthquake  portfolio  are  overwhelming  (4\u201310  times  the  annual \nbudgets) compared with the profiles of the IAs that are expected to implement these portfolios. \nAdditional portfolio has been given to IAs without the additional resources and staff required to \nimplement  this  expanded  load.  ERRA  has  prioritized  certain  sectors  without  planning \nadequately for the capacity required to handle even the priority sectors (except housing, which \nhas been a priority from the start). Capacity deployment has to be part of the planning and \nprioritization process for the new institutions and the line agencies. Sufficient resources have to ", "      Appendix 2  31\nbe allocated for this purpose internally, rather than depending excessively on outside agencies, \nwhich is typically the case in the current scenario. \n \n \nTable A2.1: Financing Plan of Rural Housing  \n($ million) \n \nFunding  Funding \nInstitution  Secured   Pipeline  Total   \nWorld Bank  Credit  210  130  340 \nWorld Bank Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund  198    198 \nGermany  13    13 \nInternational Fund for Agriculture Development  17    17 \nFrance  45    45 \nIslamic Development Bank  76  127  203 \nAsian Development Bank    400  400 \n       \n      \nSecured and Potential Fund Supply  559  657  1,216  \nLow-Case Scenario (85% completion at 73% destroyed)       \n      \nEstimated Total Required Funding (low case)      1,189  \n      \nFunding to be Secured (excluding pipeline)      630  \n       \nHigh-Case Scenario (98% completion at 73% destroyed)        \n      \nEstimated Total Required Funding (high case)       1,375  \n      \nFunding to be Secured (excluding pipeline)        816  \nNote: The above figures only reflect the housing grant and not the software support.     \nSources: Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n \n ", " \n3\n2\n \nTable A2.2: Cost Estimates and Funding Gaps in Education Sector \n($ million)  A\np\n  p\ne\nn\nAzad Jammu and Kashmir              d\nix\nNumber of   2\n \nTotal Number of  Number of  Institutions  Fund \nCategory  Unit Cost Estimate  Total Cost  Available Funds \nInstitutions  Institutions  with   No  Gapa \nFunded  Funding \n                       \nPrimary  0.13  2,126  282.76  739  98.29  1,387  184.47 \nMiddleb  0.27  590  156.94  499  132.73  91  24.21 \nHigh   0.37  327  119.68  126  46.12  201  73.57 \nHigh and \nSecondary  0.45  27  12.15  13  5.85  14  6.30 \nCollege  1.25  43  53.75  14  17.50  29  36.25 \nUniversity  5.00  1  5.00  1  5.00  0  0 \n      3,114  630.28  1,392  305.49  1,722  324.79 \n               \nNorth-West Frontier Province                \nPrimary  0.13  2,778  369.47  982  130.61  1,796  238.87 \nMiddle  0.13  329  43.76  98  13.03  231  30.72 \nHigh   0.37  197  72.10  100  36.60  97  35.50 \nHigh and \nSecondary  0.45  35  15.75  13  5.85  22  9.9 \nCollege  1.25  18  22.5  13  16.25  5  6.25 \nUniversity  5.00  1  5.00  1  5.00  0  0 \n    3,358  528.58  1,207  207.34  2,151  321.24 \n                       \nTotal     6,472  1,158.86  2,599  512.83  3,873  646.04 \na Numbers may not sum precisely because of rounding. \nb Middle schools in Azad Jammu and Kashmir include both middle and primary classes.       \nSources: Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "  Appendix 3  33 \n \nFINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND FIDUCIARY ASSESSEMENT \nA.  Implementation Arrangements and the Role of ERRA \n \n1.  In  the  immediate  aftermath  of  the  8  October  2005  earthquake,  the  Government  of \nPakistan  (the  Government)  established  the  Earthquake  Reconstruction  and  Rehabilitation \nAuthority (ERRA) as an umbrella statutory authority to manage the overall implementation and \nmonitoring of the recovery exercise. ERRA has been mandated to define operational policies \nand guidelines, direct the uniform implementation of the disaster management programs, and \nmanage the grievance process. It has been responsible for the management of the funds \nprovided by multilateral and bilateral development partners, private targeted donations, and \nbudgetary contributions of the Government towards the reconstruction and rehabilitation (R&R) \nprogram.1 \n \n2.  On behalf of the Government, ERRA prepared an operations manual for the recovery \nprogram.  This  provides  the  policies  and  guidelines  for  the  strategic  and  operational \nmanagement  of  the  program.  Ensuring  transparency  and  accountability  in  utilizing  R&R \nresources  has  been  a  major  principle  underlying  the  policies  and  guidelines.  Financial \nmanagement  and  auditing  procedures,  including  funds  flow  control  arrangements  and \nprocedures, designed by the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) and/or Controller General of \nAccounts (CGA)/and the Ministry of Finance (MOF), formed part of this manual. \n \n3.  The recovery program has been implemented through the North-West Frontier Province \n(NWFP) Provincial Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Agency (PERRA), the Azad \nJammu  and  Kashmir  (AJK)  State  Earthquake  Reconstruction  and  Rehabilitation  Agency \n(SERRA), district reconstruction units (DRU), National Highway Authority (NHA), Water and \nPower  Development  Authority  (WAPDA),  FWO,  people  with  disabilities  (PWD),  Pakistan \nPoverty  Alleviation  Fund  (PPAF),  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  or  such  other \nmechanisms that ERRA has authorized. ERRA finances the remunerations/fees of qualified \ntechnical  and  financial  management  personnel  in  each  PERRA/SERRA  and  DRUs,  and \nevaluates and monitors processes during implementation.      \n \nB.  Accounting Policies and Procedures, the Information System, and Staffing \n4.  ERRA has been required to comply with the International Public Sector Accounting \nStandards (IPSAS) cash basis of financial reporting for its year-end financial statements, and to \nprovide by way of notes to the accounts material financial commitments at the end of each year. \nThe notes include a summary of expenditures pertaining to each of the 8\u20139 affected districts on \na  segmental  basis,  and  according  to  the  core  components  of  the  recovery  program.  The \noperative procedures have been clearly spelled out in the financial management procedures \nprepared by the AGP, CGA and MOF, which form part of the operations manual of ERRA.  \n \n5.  To enable effective financial management, ERRA is in the process of implementing a \ncomputerized financial management system. This system will serve as a consolidation bench for \nthe integrated Management Information system (MIS) of the ERRA program, and will be used \nfor preparing financial management reports and financial statements.  \n \n6.  ERRA has been adequately staffed by a qualified financial management team comprised \nof market-based professional accountants. PERRA and SERRA have established a Financial \n                                                 \n1 ERRA was established through Government notification no. F.1(4)/2005-Admin. on 24 October 2005. \n ", "34  Appendix 3     \n \nManagement Unit. Others entities that implement self-accounting, such as NHA and WAPDA, \nhave adequate financial management arrangements to enable compliance reporting to ERRA. \nAGP provided auditors to PERRA and/or SERRA to continuously post-audit transactions and \nthe financial and physical progress reports before final submission to ERRA. AJP also has \nprovided one auditor at each DRU to carry out the post-audit of transactions and reports at that \nlevel before submitting them to PERRA and/or SERRA.  \n \nC.  Flow of Funds and Disbursements  \n7.  Development partner-contributed funds form part of ERRA fund account as sub-receipt \naccounts held with the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). Under the proposed ADB assistance, \nfunds from ADB will enter the federal Government\u2019s consolidated account for external financing. \nAll external financing is required to enter the specified federal Government budget line item to \nensure financial control at the entry point. Releases from the federal Government budget will be \ntransferred from the federal consolidated fund to the ERRA fund account as a sub-account to be \nused in accordance with the Government of Pakistan\u2019s transparent and accountable financial \nrules for emergency situations.  \n \n8.  ERRA funds have been credited to the \u2018ERRA Trust\u2019 account, which the Government \ncreated within its chart of accounts under the new accounting model. Budgeting and accounting \ncodes have been introduced to capture and track receipts into the account and payments from \nthe account. To tackle the issue of fund fungibility, the Program will require that the Government \nensures the financing of the entire earthquake R&R program.  \n \n9.  The accounting mechanism for the purpose of receiving and reporting the loan proceeds \nwill be carried out as per the requirements of the Government\u2019s MOF Circular of November 25, \n2002, as revised on 15 April 2005, relating to the maintenance and operation of \u201crevolving fund\u201d \naccounts of ADB and World Bank credits and loans. The usage of the loan proceeds will follow \nexisting practices.

Accounting, Internal Control, Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs), and External \nAuditing \n10.  To ensure uniformity and ease of implementation, the Government\u2019s budgeting and \naccounting system has been as much as possible at all levels. To expedite the implementation \nprocess and harmonize the reporting and assurance processes, ERRA has prescribed the \nreporting requirements of PERRA or SERRA based on its own formats of reporting. PERRA or \nSERRA then prescribe the reporting requirements of the DRUs. ERRA, however, is empowered \nto vary the channels of control of implementation activities where capacity constraints exist. \n ", "36  Appendix 3     \n \nOther implementation agencies, such as NHA, WAPDA, PPAF, and NGOs, have acceptable \nfinancial management arrangements.  \n \n11.  Based on existing practice, DRUs in the NWFP and the office of the District Construction \nOffice (DCO), through the financial management staff [as well as through District Auditing \nOffices (DAOs), where necessary] recruited by ERRA from the market and paid for from ERRA \nfunds, have been responsible for the accounting and reporting of the expenditures of approved \ndistrict programs and schemes to the NWFP PERRA. In AJK, the Office of the Commissioner, \nthrough recruited financial management staff (as well as through DAOs, where necessary), has \nprovided the accounting and reporting services. The Financial Management Unit of the PERRA \nor SERRA is responsible for the accounting, internal control, and financial reporting of all funds \nreleased to them by ERRA. The arrangement also includes PERRA or SERRA\u2019s consolidation \nof the DRUs\u2019 financial reports (using a simplified imprest accounting and reporting format) \nprepared and delivered to them monthly. For other implementing or participating entities that are \nautonomous,  self-accounting,  and  have  acceptable  financial  management  and  reporting \narrangements, financial reporting entails the provision of summaries of financial returns on \nexpenditures,  as  well  as  implementation  progress  made  for  the  approved  programs  and \nschemes they are implementing. These consolidate the data in the overall financial statements \nof  ERRA.  Continuous  internal  control  and  internal  auditing  have  been  instituted  in  ERRA, \nPERRA/SERRA, and each of the 8\u20139 DRUs. The CGA has delegated internal auditors through \ndeputation, or recruited them from the market at cost to the Program.   \n \n12.  ERRA  has  provided  quarterly  consolidated  financial  and  implementation  progress \nreports, Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs), to the Government of Pakistan and the donor \ncommunity in a form of \u2018Sources of Funds\u2019 (according to contributor categories), and \u2018Uses of \nFunds\u2019 (according to districts, sectors, programs, activities, and schemes) statements, as well \nas physical progress monitoring reports. FMRs have become a primary tool by all development \npartners,  particularly  the  World  Bank,  to  monitor  the  use  of  their  funds  for  the  housing \nreconstruction  which  has  been  used  as  a  basis  for  releasing  future  payments.  ADB  has \nprovided important assistance in financial accounting, reporting, and auditing, including the \nproduction and auditing of the FMRs. In an effort to harmonize with other funding agencies and \nminimize additional burdens, it is proposed that the proposed Program will also use FMRs as a \nprimary tool for monitoring the use of the loan funds for housing reconstruction and for tranche \nreleases.  \n \n13.  ERRA is responsible for providing overall assurance to the Government, the citizens, \nand the aid agency community that the program is being implemented transparently, and that \nthe funds expended from the ERRA fund account have been used for the intended purposes \nand with economy and efficiency. The AGP has been appointed as the external auditor of \nERRA. The AGP has conducted its first annual audit of ERRA, and certified the consolidated \nfinancial statements for the entire program. This activity was in addition to the continuous post-\naudits that the assigned AGP staff have performed at PERRA or SERRA and DRUs. The \nexternal audit comprehensively covers the cash grant audit, procurement audit, certification \naudit, civil works audit, environment audit, and performance audit. The existing accounting, \ninternal control, financial reporting, and external auditing practices will be extended to the \nproposed ADB assistance.  \n \nE.  Complementary Programs \n \n14.  The implementation of the R&R programs benefited from other aid agency programs that \nhave been implemented over the past few years. The earthquake R&R programs have been ", "  Appendix 3  37 \n \nprincipally implemented in the two affected provinces or territories of Pakistan (NWFP and AJK). \nWhile the Provincial Public Financial Accountability Assessment for the NWFP by the World \nBank in January 2004 highlighted some specific deficiencies, it also pointed out that NWFP is \nthe  most  successful  province  in  implementing  the  provincial  financial  management  reform \nprogram. The province has adopted the new accounting model using the new chart of accounts, \nwhich is International Monetary Fund (IMF) Government Finance Statistics (GFS) compliant, \nand is one of only two provinces that has achieved a state of readiness to roll out the use of a \nuniform chart of accounts for all its 24 district governments. \n \n15.  The financial management arrangements at AJK are conducted on the same underlying \nprinciples as applicable at the federal level. The accounting, internal control, reporting, and \nauditing systems are based on the federal model, while recognizing that AJK is not a traditional \nprovince  in  the  federation.  Following  the  World  Bank\u2019s  country  Financial  Accountability \nAssessment (2003), AJK has achieved a high accounts reconciliation rate. Reconciliation levels \nfor receipts, expenditures, intergovernmental accounts, and suspense accounts have been held \nat 100% over the past 3 years. This has resulted in greater reliability and accuracy of the \nfinancial and fiscal data supplied from the AJK, despite the numerous financial transactions \ncarried out through manual accounting processes. \n \n16.  With  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  provided  by  the  World  Bank  through  its  PIFRA \nproject, AGP has strengthened significantly its capacity to support the effective and efficient \ndelivery  of  the  financial  management  and  fiduciary  requirements  of  the  emergency  relief \nprograms. Supported by PIFRA, financial reporting using the SAP/R3 application software has \nbecome widespread in the Pakistan public sector. ADB assistance2 has also helped to improve \nthe financial management and fiduciary capacity of the Government. ADB also has provided TA \nto support the Office of Auditor General\u2019s (OAG\u2019s) capacity for undertaking external audit for \nERRA program.  \n \nF.  Implementation Experience: Achievements and Challenges \n \n17.  Despite  the  huge  challenges  faced  by  the  earthquake  relief  programs,  the \nimplementation under ERRA generally has been positive. In the financial and fiduciary areas, \nthe commitment of the Government to transparent and accountable processes for the R&R \nprogram has ensured relatively smooth implementation. The OAG, in collaboration with the \nCGA and MOF, has prepared the funds flow, accounting, internal control, financial reporting, \nand  external  auditing  mechanisms  for  the  ERRA  program,  and  this  facilitates  the \nimplementation. The first external auditor\u2019s report by the OAG reflects this assessment.  \n \n18.  The outcome has been especially positive in the housing sector, where an owner-driven \nscheme has been established. The disbursement has been carried out in a maximum four \ninstallments,  based  on  evaluation  of  progress  on  houses  with  clearly  specified  technical \nstandards. Owners have built their own houses, and this process has achieved relatively fast \nprogress. The payments have been disbursed directly to owners\u2019 bank accounts. The military \nhas contributed to the much-needed support for monitoring and evaluation of the housing \nprogram.  \n \n19.  Challenges,  however,  remain.  A  key  challenge  has  been  the  recruitment  of  highly \nqualified financial and accounting professionals. Due to the harsh conditions and remoteness of \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 1999. Regional Technical Assistance for Strengthening Financial Management and Governance in Selected \nDevelopment Member Countries. Manila (TA 5877-REG, for $400,000, approved in December). \n ", "38  Appendix 3     \n \nthe affected areas, the supply of expertise to these areas has been limited. This has resulted in \ndifficulties, especially at the beginning of the ERRA program. The problems generally have been \ntackled by adjusting the requirement of professionals (for example, relaxing the requirement for \nchartered accountants) and intensifying the search efforts. Future programs need to account for \nthis  constraint  when  preparing  budgets,  and  must  tap  the  international  market  whenever \nnecessary. The consulting service rules and procedures need to be simplified accordingly, and \nthe period required shortened reflecting more closely the needs in an emergency situation.  \n \n20.  Another challenge is expanding the achievements from the housing sector to other \nsectors. The housing sector\u2019s relatively expedient implementation has been supported by the \nsound principle of utilizing owner\u2019s personal initiatives. However, the nature of the housing \nsector\u2014houses are private goods\u2014also benefited implementation. Moving into sectors that are \nmore public goods, such as education, will pose challenges. Close monitoring and evaluation, \nand sound financial and fiduciary management, will be particularly important. The mitigating \nfactor is that, through its 1.5 year\u2019s of operation, ERRA has accumulated much experience in \nrelief programs. This, coupled with the Government\u2019s commitments, can reduce the risks. \n ", "    Appendix 4  39 \n \nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTING SERVICES FOR PROVIDING \nCAPACITY BUILDING FOR INSTITUTIONS RELATED TO EARTHQUAKE \nRECONSTRUCTION AND REHABILITATION, PAKISTAN \n \nA.  Background \n \n1.  The 8 October 2005 earthquake that hit northern Pakistan was the most devastating in \nthe nation\u2019s history. The earthquake destroyed more than 600,000 houses, together with many \nschools and other infrastructure facilities.  \n \n2.  The Government of Pakistan (the Government) has taken an owner-driven and in situ \napproach for housing reconstruction, and has made significant progress. Households build their \nown  houses,  based  on  the  seismic  standards  and  designs  provided  by  the  Earthquake \nReconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority (ERRA). Households use the subsidies provided by \nthe Government through ERRA, which are made in four installments based on the physical \nprogress of construction. A major portion of the funds committed by multilateral and bilateral \ndevelopment  agencies  for  housing  reconstruction  has  been  disbursed.  More  than  96%  of \nhouseholds have received the second installment.  \n \n3.  The  owner-driven  approach  for  building  seismically  safe  houses  requires  many \ninspectors and trainers on the ground. About 25,000 master trainers have received training, and \nthey have trained more than 200,000 affected house owners on seismic building standards and \ntechniques. The Army, together with nongovernment organizations (NGOs), has provided the \nbulk of the personnel on the ground. However, this has distracted the Army from its regular \nduties. Civil organizations gradually should replace the Army in conducting inspection and \ntraining. The funding for many NGOs also is nearly depleted. A replenishment of the resources \nneeded to continue providing training and inspection, which are essential for the continued \nsuccess of the housing reconstruction program, is urgently needed.  \n \n4.  Various  development  agencies,  including  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  the \nAustralian Agency for International Development (AusAID), United Kingdom Department for \nInternational Development (DFID), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United \nNations Human Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT), and the World Bank are providing \nassistance to ERRA in a number of areas. These include financial management, monitoring and \nevaluation (M&E), environmental and social safeguards, and social protection of vulnerable \ngroups. Under a TA1 attached to the earlier Earthquake Emergency Assistance Project (EEAP),2 \nADB has engaged a team of consultants to provide TA in most of these areas. However, \ncontinuing support is needed in (i) community-based training on seismic standards and building \ntechniques;  (ii)  financial  and  strategic  management;  and  (iii)  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards. \n \n5.  To meet these needs, an advisory TA project is proposed to be attached to the Program.  \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to \nPakistan for the Earthquake Emergency Assistance Project. Manila (Loan 2213-PAK[SF], approved in December \n2005, for $300 million). \n ", "40  Appendix 4     \n \nB.  Scope of Services \n \n6.  The TA project has three components. \n \n1.  Component  1:  Community-Based  Training  on  Seismic  Standards  and \nBuilding Techniques \n \n7.  This component will finance the recruitment of national consultants to be engaged in  \nconducting (i) inspections of housing reconstruction implemented by individual households, \nwhich is the basis for ERRA to release its payments; and (ii) training of the households and \ncommunity-based organizations on seismic standards and designs, and building techniques. \nThus far, 200,000 households have been trained, and the funding to be provided under the TA \nproject will help train at least 50,000 additional households, bringing the total training coverage \nto about 43% of the damaged or destroyed rural houses.  \n \n8.  The  significant  level  of  noncompliance  with  the  seismic  standards  and  designs \nprescribed by ERRA highlights the need for such inspection and training. In many cases, the \nnoncompliance is caused by a lack of knowledge about the standards and techniques. In such \ncases, increased training and inspections will help to improve the compliance ratio. \n \n  2.  Component  2:  Financial  Management,  Internal  Control,  and  Strategic\n  Management \n \n9.  This component will build on the assistance under Capacity Building for the Office of the \nAuditor  General  of  Pakistan  to  provide  further  support  in  strengthening  ERRA\u2019s  financial \nmanagement, internal control, and strategic management capacities. Under the above TA, two \nchartered accountants have been engaged for ERRA, and the engagement of a third is in \nprocess. The three accountants, who will be engaged for a year under above TA, will be \nstationed  at  ERRA  headquarters  in  Islamabad  and  its  two  provincial  or  state  branches\u2014\nProvincial  Earthquake  Reconstruction  and  Rehabilitation  Agency  (PERRA)  for  North-West \nFrontier Province and State Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Agency (SERRA) for \nAzad Jammu and Kashmir. This component will provide additional financing support for the \nengagement. Other areas of financial and strategic management that might need additional \nsupport will be determined through joint assessments of needs to be conducted by ADB and \nERRA during the implementation of the Program and the proposed TA project. \n \n  3.  Component 3: Environmental and Social Protection \n \n10.  Under  Capacity  Building  for  the  Office  of  the  Auditor  General  of  Pakistan,  ADB, \nsupported by AusAID, is training the safeguards specialists of ERRA, PERRA, SERRA, and \ndistrict reconstruction units (DRU) on the national and ADB safeguards regulations, policies, \nand procedures, as well as on environmental assessment techniques. UNDP finances many of \nthe safeguards specialists. An area that might need further support is social protection and \nADB\u2019s policies and procedures on involuntary resettlement, indigenous peoples, gender, and \nprotection of vulnerable peoples. This component will finance engagement of a lead social \nsafeguards specialist  and  other  sector  specialists,  including  gender  and  vulnerable  groups \nspecialists, particularly female counselors. The main tasks of this team of specialists include (i) \nproviding assistance to ADB environmental and social protection specialists to conduct training \nthe ERRA safeguards specialists on ADB policies and procedures on involuntary resettlement, \nindigenous peoples, gender, and vulnerable groups, and on preparation of resettlement plans \nand indigenous peoples development plans, if needed; (ii) supervising the preparation by ERRA ", "    Appendix 4  41 \n \nof resettlement plans and indigenous peoples development plans that will meet the concerned \nnational laws and regulations, as well as ADB\u2019s policies; (iii) conducting periodic reviews of \nsafeguard  compliance;  (iv)  supporting  the  implementation  of  the  gender  action  plans;  (v) \nsupporting ERRA in identifying the location and needs of vulnerable people, and designing and \nimplementing the special assistance program for the vulnerable people; and (vi) preparing \nupdated reports on the status and issues related to environmental and social protection. \n \nC.  Staffing \n11.  For the TA project, 325 person-months of national consultants and 6 person-months of \ninternational consultants3 are proposed. In addition, field and technical support staff equivalent \nto 200 person-months will be recruited. The suggested division of the international and national \nperson-months is tentative and subject to changes in accordance with needs confirmed during \nimplementation.  However,  any  deviations  will  be  budget  neutral.  The  breakdown  of  the \nconsulting services by the three components will be confirmed during implementation. However, \ncomponent  1  on  inspection  and  training  on  seismic  standards  and  building  techniques  is \nexpected to account for more than half the budget. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  ERRA will be the Executing Agency for the TA project. However, the TA will include \ncapacity  building  for  all  institutions  related  to  earthquake  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation. \nSpecial attention will be given to building capacities at the provincial or state and district levels, \nincluding PERRA and SERRA, the provincial or state line departments (as the implementing \nagencies for many earthquake reconstruction subprojects), and the DRUs. The proposed TA \nproject  is  scheduled  to  be  implemented  over  36  months,  from  July  2007  to  July  2010. \nAdministration of the proposed TA project will be delegated to the earthquake team of the \nPakistan Resident Mission. The establishment of an advisory committee with representatives of \ndifferent departments of ERRA, chaired by ADB, is proposed. This committee would (i) provide \nthe Government concurrence on consultants, (ii) approve progress and annual reports, and (ii) \nprovide guidance to the team of consultants. The earthquake team of the resident mission will \nprovide secretariat services to the advisory committee. All consultants will be engaged by ADB \nin accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time-to-\ntime). Procurement of equipment will be conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time-to-time) and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB \nfor procurement.  \n \n13.  A  separate  procurement  plan  has  been  prepared  as  a  supplementary  appendix \n(available upon request). The TA will be used mostly to support the ongoing training and the \nenvironmental and social protection program, which has been conducted by a number of civil \norganizations,  including  National  Rural  Support  Programme  and  Sarhad  Rural  Support \nProgramme. As such, single-source selection of the consultants is proposed to ensure the \ncontinuity of the training, as well as the environmental and social protection programs; and to \ntake  advantage  of  their  experience  in  these  activities.  Single-source selection  also  will  be \nconducive for the timely execution of the TA project to support the housing reconstruction \nprogram, which is expected to be completed by May 2008.  \n \n                                                 \n3  ERRA and ADB may decide to convert the international consulting services into domestic consulting services \nbased on actual needs but such conversion should be budget-neutral. \n \n ", "42  Appendix 4     \n \nE.  Reporting and Documentation Requirements \n14.  The advisory committee will endorse the biannual reports prepared by the secretariat \nbefore submission to the Government and ADB. \n \nF.  Cost Estimates \n15.   The total cost of the TA is estimated at $2,500,000. ADB will provide $2,000,000 from \nPEF on a grant basis.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Pakistan: \n \nThe 2003 Pakistan Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) outlines the three pillars of the Government\u2019s \npoverty reduction strategy: (i) accelerating economic growth, (ii) improving governance, and (iii) investing in human \ncapital. The Program will contribute to the strengthening of all three pillars by providing finance for rural houses \nreconstruction, and providing support for improving financial management and fiduciary oversight. The PRSP, in \nparticular, recognizes housing as productive activity, because it contributes through a high multiplier effect with a \nhost of beneficial forward and backward links in the economy. The reconstruction of rural houses damaged or \ndestroyed by the earthquake will have additional impact on people\u2019s welfare by providing seismically compliant \nhousing. Of the 3.5 million displaced people in North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) and Azad Jammu and \nKashmir (AJK), about 1% (or 35,000 people) are still living in tents in camps and the remaining 99% are living in \nself-built temporary shelters. Worldwide experience suggests that provision of housing shelter is a prerequisite for \nfull economic recovery in disaster relief and reconstruction.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: Target Intervention  \n \nThe area most heavily damaged by earthquake is home to a scattered population of 5.7 million people, with an \nestimated seven family members per household. About 88% of the people live in the mountains, many of them on \nsteep hills, in settlements ranging from two households to more than 300. A high proportion of the population lacks \nbasic services, clean drinking water, and safe waste disposal. Agriculture and livestock rearing are the primary \nsource of employment in rural areas, with most rural residents engaged in subsistence agriculture. Before the \nearthquake, relatively smaller portions of the populations of NWFP and AJK were living on less than $1 per day \n(i.e., 9.9% in NWFP and 2.5% in AJK, against a national average of 13.9%). However, the earthquake created \nadditional poverty by destroying many assets, such as houses, as well as killing more than 80,000 people and \ninjuring many others (i.e., about 100,000, many of whom are permanently disabled and lost their productive \ncapacities). The earthquake affected a vast area of northern Pakistan, with scattered population settlements and \npoor road access. This has posed great difficulties for the reconstruction and rehabilitation (R&R) efforts.  \n \nThe Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority (ERRA) have begun to establish a comprehensive \ndatabase for the earthquake-affected people. ERRA also has developed a comprehensive Social Protection \nStrategy. With the assistance of development agencies, including the United Nations Human Settlements Program \n(UN HABITAT) and ADB, ERRA has conducted a vulnerability survey of the EQAA (2007) to identify the locations \nand needs of the affected people. The long-term goal is to ensure vulnerable groups are provided with basic social \nservices, livelihood assistance, and support for rehabilitation, primarily within their own families and communities. It \nalso aims to establish links with the mainstream social welfare structures and services at the district level. \nHowever, the magnitude of the needs has caused, and will continue to cause, a huge burden for the government, \nespecially at the provincial/state and district level. Continued support from the international communities will be \nneeded for years to come. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nAs part of loan processing, a wide range of stakeholders were consulted during loan design. ADB\u2019s earthquake \nteam has been conducting routine consultations with relevant Institutional partners, government agencies, and civil \nsociety organizations (CSO) during implementation of EEAP. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?    Yes           No \n \nERRA\u2019s Social Protection Strategy explicitly focuses on the inclusion and participation by women and extremely \nvulnerable individuals and families in the design, implementation, and monitoring of reconstruction assistance \nprograms. The nature of the housing reconstruction program, i.e., owner-driven with Government\u2019s financial \nsubsidy  and  guided  by  ERRA\u2019s  technical  support  through  training  and  monitoring,  also  determines  that \nparticipation is an integrated and crucial element for the success of the housing program. \n \n ", "44  Appendix 5 \nD.  Gender Development \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nWomen have particularly been challenged after the disaster since their roles have changed drastically\u2014from \ncaregivers and contributors to the family income in a conservative society to household heads and main bread \nearners for families where the earning male head of household has died or suffered from permanent physical \ndisabilities. Following the earthquake, many women are coping with psychosocial distress and hopelessness. \nWomen have limited access to information and few  opportunities to participate in rehabilitation plans and \nprograms. Weakened public health services hinder access to reproductive health care. Customary practices often \ndeny women their right to inheritance and limit their access to property, income, and livelihood options. Given \nthese dynamics, widows and female-headed households in particular need specific outside support in terms of \nestablishing appropriate living arrangements and sources of livelihood within the community that enable them to \nenjoy protection and to rebuild their family safety net on a new ground. \n \nThe Program primarily will provide finance for rural housing reconstruction. It will aim to ensure that women will \nreceive the same assistance and compensation as men. The Program will adopt a number of strategies. Technical \nassistance (TA) will be provided for training on seismic building techniques and designs. More than 200,000 \nhouseholds have been trained. The TA project specifically will ensure that the training will include women, \nparticularly for those households headed by widows. The TA project also will support the survey of vulnerable \ngroups, including widows, to identify their needs and provide special assistance to the vulnerable groups.  \n \nHas an output been prepared?    Yes    No \n \nThe Gender and Vulnerability Action Plan (GVAP) in Appendix 7 builds on the Gender and Vulnerable People \nAction Plans prepared under EEAP, which is in its initial stage of implementation. It aims to ensure that critical \nneeds, constraints, and priorities voiced by women and extremely vulnerable individuals and families\u2014reflected in \nthe design of the Program\u2014are monitored during loan implementation. The GVAP outlines the following relevant \nactivities, targets/indicators to assess: (i) women\u2019s and other vulnerable groups\u2019 equal access to the benefits, \nopportunities, and services provided under the rural housing reconstruction (component 1) activities to be funded \nunder the loan; and (ii) ERRA\u2019s ability to mainstream gender and vulnerability issues and concerns at all levels\u2014\norganizationally, in policies, strategies, program planning, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) \nsystems to measure/assess gender equality results (component 3). The GVAP will be implemented through \nERRA\u2019s  network  of  institutional  and  partner  organizations  at  the  provincial/state  and  district  levels.  Sex-\ndisaggregated baseline data will be provided by the M&E unit at ERRA at program onset, outlining current status \nand gender gaps in women\u2019s and other vulnerable groups\u2019 access to the benefits, opportunities, and services \nprovided under ERRA\u2019s housing reconstruction initiatives. Progress in the implementation of the program-specific \nGVAP will be monitored closely, and progress will be reported quarterly to ADB. \n \nE.

Introduction \n1.  The 8 October 2005 earthquake that hit northern Pakistan destroyed about 600,000 \nhouses (including 585,000 rural houses and 30,000 urban houses), 6,472 schools, 570 medical \nfacilities, and 1,500 government buildings. The Government has taken an owner-driven, in situ \napproach  to  rural  house  reconstruction.  The  Government,  through  the  Earthquake \nReconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority (ERRA), provides subsidies in four installments to \nthe individual households that are building their own houses based on standards and designs \nprovided by the Government. In 99% cases, the reconstructed houses will be at the original \nsites.  For  approximately  1%,  or  6,000  houses,  the  original  sites  have  been  destroyed  by \nlandslides  or  deemed  seismically  unsafe.  New  sites  need  to  be  found  for  these  6,000 \nhouseholds, or about 35,000 people. Progress in rural housing reconstruction is significant. \nMore than 96% of households have received second installments of finance, and the rural \nhousing reconstruction program is expected to be completed by May 2008.  \n \n2.  In  December  2005,  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  its  first  project,  the \nEarthquake Emergency Assistance Project (EEAP),1 to support the Government of Pakistan \n(the Government) in its earthquake reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts. The project targeted \nreconstruction and rehabilitation of several infrastructure sectors including transport, energy, \neducation, and health. An initial environmental examination (IEE) was prepared for EEAP, which \nhighlights potential environmental impacts and mitigation measures in the four sectors to be \nexplored further during subproject formulation.  \n \nB.  Description of the Program \n3.  The  proposed  Earthquake-Displaced  People  Livelihood  Restoration  Program  (the \nProgram) will primarily finance the repairing and reconstruction of rural houses damaged by the \nearthquake. This IEE will provide scoping and assessment of potential environmental impacts of \nhousing reconstruction, which was not included in the IEE for EEAP.  \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n4.  The environmental conditions of the earthquake-affected areas in North-West Frontier \nProvince (NWFP) and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) are described in paras. 5 and 6. \n \n5.  Physical  and  Ecological  Environment.  The  earthquake-affected  areas  are  in  the \nHimalaya Mountains. Summers are temperate and winters intensely cold. Rain generally falls in \ntwo distinct crop-growing seasons\u2014from December to March and from June to September. The \nthree main rivers in the areas are the Jhehar, Kunhar, and Neelum. The areas are known for \ntheir high-altitude coniferous and broad-leaved forests and great biodiversity. The landscape is \ncharacterized by forests; game reserves; and cold rivers, lakes, and wetlands. About 4% of the \nland in AJK has been declared protected forest. The Machiara National Park is in the heart of \nthe earthquake-affected area. In NWFP, about 6% of the land is designated as protected with \nAyubia National Park located at the periphery of the earthquake-affected zone. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to \nPakistan for the Earthquake Emergency Assistance Project. Manila (Loan 2213-PAK[SF], approved in December \n2005, for $300 million). \n ", "    Appendix 7     49     \n6.  Social, Cultural, and Economic Development. The area most heavily damaged by \nearthquake is home to a scattered population of 5.7 million people, with an average of seven \nfamily members per household. About 88% of the people live in the mountains, many of them \non steep hills, in settlements ranging from two households to more than 300. A high proportion \nof the population lacks basic services, clean drinking water, and safe waste disposal. Agriculture \nand livestock rearing are the primary sources of employment in rural areas, with most rural \nresidents engaged in subsistence agriculture.  \n \nD.  Anticipated  Environmental  Impacts  for  Housing  Reconstruction  and  Mitigation \nMeasures \n7.  The earthquake has caused significant damage to the environmental and ecological \nresources  including  fish  hatcheries,  forests, and  rivers,  through  landslides  and  siltation.  In \ngeneral,  however,  no  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  expected  from  the \nreconstruction and rehabilitation efforts provided that certain preventive measures are taken. \nTwo environmental issues that are crosscutting to all sectors of reconstruction are related to \nremoval and disposal of debris and rubble, and ways to minimize risks of landslides. Strong \nefforts should be made to avoid dumping debris and rubble in rivers, along the roads, in open \nfields, drainage ditches, and forested areas, and to take the landslides risks into consideration \nwhen planning for reconstruction.  \n \n8.  For housing reconstruction, the main potential environmental issues are as follows. \n \n(i)  Reconstruction of rural houses may require a large quantity of timber. This may \nlead to a round of deforestation which will have adverse impacts on wildlife and \nbiodiversity conservation. \n(ii)  Pollution and discharge of domestic wastes caused by improper drainage and \ninadequate sanitary facilities need to be minimized. \n(iii)  The houses are located in seismic \u201cred\u201d zone, e.g., landslides pronged areas. \n \n9.  Environmental monitoring conducted by ERRA so far suggests that tree cutting has been \nkept at very minimal as many households are able to reuse the timbers from the damaged \nhouses.  ERRA  has  also  implemented  a  ban  on  timber  logging.  The  pollution  caused  by \ndischarge of residential wastes can be minimized through identifying proper location and design \nof drainage to ensure that the wastes will not be discharged to rivers and other ecologically \nsensitive environmental ambience. ERRA is strictly enforcing its seismic zoning regulations to \nprevent building houses in the \u201cred\u201d zones through inspection and withholding of payments.  \n \nE.  Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan for Housing Reconstruction \n10.  Compared with the reconstruction of infrastructure sectors such as roads power plants, \nhousing reconstruction is unique in that it is implemented by individual owners. There was no \nseparate environmental assessment conducted either for housing reconstruction as whole or for \nindividual housing projects. However, ERRA has promulgated a series of design standards and \nregulations which are designed to ensure the housing construction will meet seismic standards \nand will not incur serious environmental pollution or damages. Table A7 provides a combined \nenvironmental monitoring and management plan. With the support from various development \nagencies including ADB, this plan is currently being implemented. ERRA\u2019s housing inspectors \nand its environmental safeguards specialists engaged at various levels have been playing a \ncritical  role  in  the  plan  implementation  and  monitoring  through  conducting  training  of  the \n ", "50  Appendix 7 \nhouseholds and inspection of the houses for compliance of the standards. The results of the \ninspection are the primary basis for releasing payments for housing reconstruction. \n \nF.  Public Consultation and Disclosure \n11.  No  specific  public  consultation  was  carried  out  during  the  preparation  of  the  IEE. \nHowever, the public is well informed of the environmental issues and related regulations. There \nhave been ongoing consultations with the affected households through the training programs \nconducted  by  ERRA  on  seismic  compliant  building  techniques  and  regulations,  and \nenvironmental regulations. So far more than 200,000 affected rural households have been \ntrained. ERRA has been implementing the identified mitigating measures from the beginning of \nthe housing reconstruction program. The finalized IEE has been published on both ADB and \nERRA\u2019s  websites.  Information  disclosure  should  be  done  in  accordance  with  the  relevant \nprovisions of the ADB\u2019s public communications policy.1 \n \nG.  Findings and Recommendations \n12.  The program will primarily finance the repairing and reconstruction of the rural houses \ndamaged by the earthquake. No significant adverse environmental impacts are expected from \nhousing reconstruction provided that the recommended mitigation measures are implemented \nand the results are monitored on a regular basis. The monitoring results so far indicate that the \nadverse environmental impacts have been less severe than initially expected particularly in \nterms of deforestation. ADB particularly the earthquake team of the Pakistan Resident Mission \nshould  continue  to  support  ERRA  in  its  monitoring  of  the  environmental  impacts  of  the \nreconstruction program in general and housing reconstruction in particular to ensure both the \nGovernment\u2019s and ADB\u2019s environmental regulations and policies are met and the mitigation \nmeasures  contained  in  the  Environmental  Monitoring  and  Management  Plan  are  being \nimplemented. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

Introduction \n1.  The  proposed  Earthquake-Displaced  People  Livelihood  Restoration  Program  (the \nProgram) will involve land acquisition for both rural house reconstruction. About 1% or 6,000 \nhouseholds have \u201clost\u201d their land for their houses due to earthquake-induced landslides. While \nthe original land still remains with the ownership of the displaced households, they are no long \nsuitable for reconstructing houses. The Government is providing subsidies for the households to \npurchase new sites in adjacent areas, at a fixed price of Rs.75,000. The purchase will be \nconducted freely at market price with no Government intervention. However, to ensure such \nland  purchases  and  the  subsequent  house  building  will  not  incur  excessive  and  adverse \nenvironmental and social impacts, guidelines are needed for the Earthquake Reconstruction \nand Rehabilitation Authority (ERRA) in providing the subsidies to the displaced households. \n \nB.  Policy Framework for Guiding Private Land Purchases for Housing  \n2.  The land purchases by landless for housing reconstruction are guided by two sets of \npolicies. One is the Financial Assistance Policy and Procedures for Landless (2007) developed \nby ERRA with the support of United Nation\u2019s Human settlement Program (UN-HABITAT).  The \nother is the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) innovation and efficiency initiative1 related to \nfinancing land acquisition and right-of-way.  \n \n3.  ERRA\u2019s  policy  paper  includes  the  following:  (i)  defining  the  beneficiaries  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  landless  policy,  (ii)  describing  the  policy\u2019s  entitlements,  (iii)  describing  the \nprocess and institutional arrangements for accessing the benefits, (iv) describing the process \nand institutional arrangements for addressing grievances related to the implementation of the \npolicy, (v) describing the process of disseminating the policy to the public, (vi) describing the \nprocess of training those stakeholders that are involved in implementing the policy, and (vii) \ndescribing the process for monitoring the implementation of the policy. \n \n4.  For  ADB\u2019s  loan  to  finance  land  acquisition  and  rights-of-way,  ADB  requires  the \nassessments  focusing  on,  among  others,  (i)  confirmation  of  the  productive  nature  of  the \nacquisition; (ii) suitability of land market conditions, including the definition of strategies to deal \nwith any unforeseen distortions; (iii) adequacy of the administrative arrangements, to ensure the\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2005. Innovation and Efficiency Initiative: Cost Sharing and Eligibility of Expenditures for Asian Development \nBank Financing: A New Approach. Manila. ", "    Appendix 8     53     \n channeling of funding is done transparently and efficiently; (iv) definition of the risk profile of the \ntransaction,  and  the  type  of  risk  mitigation  measures  required;  and  (v)  soundness  of  the \nmonitoring and evaluation arrangements for the purchase and payments for rights-of-way. \n \nC.  Checklist for Guiding Land Purchases by Displaced Households \n5.  A detailed review of ERRA\u2019s Financial Assistance Policy and Procedures for Landless \nindicates that the procedures satisfy ADB\u2019s requirements (para. 6). In particular, the procedures \nclearly defined the targeted rural landless as \u201ca person who owned land on 8 October 2005 and \nis so recorded in the land records or a registered sale deed, and has, as a result of the \nearthquake, lost whole or part of the land, provided that the land not destroyed is less than 5 \nmarlas.\u201d1 The procedures provide strict restrictions on the location of land to be purchased by \nlandless persons. The choice of land a landless person can purchase for resettlement generally \nis limited to within union council where he/she owned land before the earthquake, and the union \ncouncils adjoining the union council where he/she owned land before the earthquake, provided \nsome other conditions are met. The location constraint is important to limit certain undesirable \nor adverse impacts of resettlement, including adverse environmental and social impacts. The \nprocedures also prohibit a landless person from selling the newly purchased land within 5 years \nto limit land speculation and to ensure the land is used for housing reconstruction.  \n  \n6.  While  the  ERRA  procedures  are  strong  in  ensuring  good  governance  (i.e.,  money \nreaches  the  targeted  beneficiary  and  will  be  used  for  land  purchases  for  housing \nreconstruction), they could be strengthened by including more explicit environmental and social \ncriteria or conditions. The broad-based checklist provided in this paragraph is centered on \nenvironmental, social, and governance-related issues and norms. Some of the items have been \nembedded in ERRA\u2019s policy and procedures. Others should be incorporated more explicitly in \nthe procedures. These may be revised further during implementation as more information is \navailable. The checklist will ensure  \n \n(i)  the subsidy will be used for land purchases, and the amount of PRs75,000 is \nequal or more than what is needed to buy the minimum 5 marla2 of land needed \nto construct a house. \n(ii)  no coercion in land acquisition, and that the transactions will be conducted freely \nat market prices. \n(iii)  the sites to be purchased are not in the \u201cred\u201d zone in seismic zoning, which is \ndeemed unsuitable for housing reconstruction. \n(iv)  the sites to be purchased will not be located in ecologically sensitive areas, \nincluding riverbanks, certain conservation areas, etc. \n(v)  the sites to be purchased will not infringe upon certain cultural and religious relics \nand sites. \n \nD.  Implementation \n7.  The  checklist  will  be  implemented  in  conjunction  with  ERRA\u2019s  Financial  Assistance \nPolicy and Procedures for Landless through ERRA\u2019s existing housing inspection and training \nteam. Under the Program, ADB will provide additional support to the team through the attached \n                                                 \n1 Cost Sharing and Eligibility of Expenditure for ADB Financing (2005) under the Innovation and Efficiency Initiative.  \n2 marla = 230 square feet. A survey conducted in February 2007 indicates that the land prices in the earthquake-\naffected areas vary from PRs1,000 per marla to PRs15,000 per marla. \n ", "54  Appendix 8 \ntechnical assistance. Payments will be made only if a land purchase by a landless person meets \nall of these criteria. \n \nE.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n8.  With assistance from development partners, particularly the United Kingdom Department \nfor  International  Development  and  ADB,  ERRA  has  established  a  strong  monitoring  and \nevaluation (M&E) wing. The monitoring of the housing reconstruction program, which will be \ncompleted by May 2008, is its top priority. ADB will continue assist the M&E wing to enable it to \nensure these criteria will be met. \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20070629140712+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20070606114542+08'00'", "Title": "Earthquake-Displaced People Livelihood Restoration Program", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "", "Keywords": "housing earthquake pakistan, emergency assistance rehabilitation, power roads health education, reconstruction, azad jammu kashmir, north west frontier province 40563", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0.5 (Windows)"}, "author_page": " \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The proposed Program will be carried out in Azad Jammu Kashmir, an area over \nwhich Pakistan and India have been in dispute since 1947.
