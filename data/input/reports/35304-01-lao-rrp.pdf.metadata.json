Subprogram  2  is  to  be \nprovided  as  a  single  tranche,  based  on  completed  prior  actions \ndemonstrating satisfactory progress.  \n \nTargeting Classification: General intervention \nSector (subsector): Public sector management (economic and public \naffairs management \nThemes (subthemes): Private sector development (policy reforms), \ngovernance (economic and financial governance), economic growth \n(promoting macroeconomic stability) \nLocation impact: National (low impact) \n\n \n\nCategory C       \n\n \nThe core objective of the Government\u2019s Sixth National Socio-Economic \nDevelopment  Plan  (SEDP6)  2006\u20132010  is  sustaining  high  rates  of \neconomic  growth  (about  7%\u20138%  per  annum)  with  poverty  reduction. \nThe SEDP6 targets a poverty incidence rate of 23% by 2015 as well as \nthe  creation  of  652,000  productive  jobs  from  2006  to  2010.  Private \nsector  expansion  is  considered  a  key  mechanism  for  achieving  these \nobjectives. Poverty rates have declined in the Lao PDR in the past two \ndecades  from  46%  in  1992  to  33%  in  2003,  and  estimated  at  28%  in \n2008.  This  reduction  has  been  remarkable,  considering  the  rapid \npopulation  growth  during  this  period\u2014with  as  much  as  50%  of  the \npopulation  now  under  the  age  of  20  years.  It  has  been  driven  by \neconomic expansion, opening up the economy to trade and investment, \nan increase in rice production, greater urbanization, and an increase in \nremittances from Laotian workers abroad. It is common to see a sharp \nreduction  in  poverty  once  a  country  passes  a  per  capita  income \nthreshold,  as  Lao  PDR  has  done.  Achieving  a  further  reduction  in  the \npoverty  rate,  of  a  similar  magnitude  as  the  SEDP6  target,  will  depend \non  sustaining  economic  growth  at  the  current  rate  of  7%  per  annum \nover  the  medium  term  and  mobilizing  additional  fiscal  resources  to \nsupport  long-term  development  and  social  spending  objectives.  The \nLao  PDR  has  the  potential  to  accomplish  these  goals  and  the  private \nsector will be increasingly relied on to accomplish them.  \n\nThe ADB country strategy and program (CSP) for 2007\u20132011 identifies \nprivate  sector  development  as  a  key  priority.  It  has  set  expansion  of \nformal private sector firms by 15% per annum as an outcome indicator \nfor  private  sector  development.  Small  and  medium-sized  enterprises \n(SMEs)  are  the  overwhelmingly  dominant  business  form  in  the \n\n \nRecipient \n \nThe Proposal \n\n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nThe Program \nRationale \n\n \n\n\f \n\nii \n \n\n \n\nLao PDR,  and  sound  policy  suggests  that  SMEs  should  be  treated  as \nthe  private  sector  norm  and  not  the  exception.  This  suggests  that  the \nreform  agenda  should  be  broad-based,  focusing  on  reducing  the \ntransaction  costs  of  doing  business  and  improving  predictability  in  the \ninvestment  climate.  Reforms  supporting  institutional  development  in \nSME  policy \nthe \ninvestment  climate,  and  completing  the  unfinished  trade  policy  regime \nare crucially important for reducing transaction costs and expanding the \nprivate  sector,  putting  economic  growth  on  a  more  sustainable  path, \nand contributing to poverty reduction. \n\nfinance,  strengthening \n\nformulation,  access \n\nto \n\nThese  measures  are  taking  place  in  the  context  of  a  collapse  in \ncommodity prices and severe recession in major export markets. While \nmuch  of  the  Government\u2019s  current  focus  is  on  addressing  exigencies \narising from the crisis and related fiscal situation, it sees the crisis as an \nopportunity  to  build  consensus  among  stakeholders  on  difficult  policy \nreform  issues  and  to  advance  its  medium-term  objectives  related  to \nprivate  sector/SME  development\u2014recognizing  that  these  reforms  are \nfundamental  to  supporting  higher  economic  growth  rates,  lessening \nreliance  on  the  resource  sector  for  income  creation,  and  reducing \nunemployment and poverty reduction. \n\nterm.  Subprogram  2  builds  on  reforms \n\nUnder  subprogram  1,  the  Government  implemented  a  series  of  reform \nmeasures to the investment climate aimed at reducing the cost of doing \nbusiness in the Lao PDR. These included the enactment of the Law on \nEnterprises  of  2006,  and  commencing  its  implementation,  as  well  as \nmeasures aimed at chipping away at its import and export management \nsystem. The Government is also committed to preparing for World Trade \nOrganization (WTO) accession talks; this process is influencing the way \nthe  Lao  PDR  views its  business  climate  and  trade  policy  over  the \nmedium \ninitiated  under \nsubprogram 1, with the core focus on implementing the enterprise law, \nincluding  the  establishment  of  the  enterprise  registry  offices,  starting  a \nprocess  for  regulatory  reform,  advancing  trade  policy  reforms, and \nenhancing capacity and staff training on trade policy formulation. These \nreforms  are  designed \ninstitutional \nto  accomplish: \ncoordination  in  SME  policy  formulation  and  better  access  to  finance,\n(ii) strengthen  investment  climate,  and  (iii)  improve  trade  policy  and \ncapacity development.  \n \nIn  response  to  the  global  economic  crisis,  a  post-program  monitoring \nframework is added at the subprogram 2 phase. The Government and \nADB  have  agreed  to  a  post-PSME  framework  in  the  next  12  months, \ncreating  the  basis  for  continuous  policy  dialogue  and  engagement \nduring  the  critical  period  of  2009\u20132010.  The  monitoring  framework \nfocuses on the Government\u2019s short-term plan advancing its reforms in \nbusiness climate, trade policy, and trade facilitation (a new component) \nsupported  by  ADB  and  other  development  partners\u2019  technical  and \nprogram  assistance.  It  may  provide  the  basis  for  a  second-generation \nPSME in the future. \n \n\nimprove \n\n(i) \n\n\fImpact and \nOutcome \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nPeriod and \nTranching \n\n \nCounterpart Funds \n\n \n\n \n\niii\n\nThe reform program was prepared by a joint team of representatives of \nthe Government and ADB. \n \nThe  impact  of  subprogram  2  of  the  PSME  is  to  achieve  sustainable \neconomic  growth  in  the  non-resource  sector,  supported  by  increased \ncontribution  of \nthe  private  sector  and  SMEs.  The  outcome  of \nsubprogram 2 is an improved business environment where the private \nsector and SMEs operate efficiently and effectively.  \n \nThe  PSME  includes  a  series  of  policy  reforms  that  underpin  the  key \npriorities  of  the  Lao  PDR\u2019s  Sixth  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan \nand its sector strategies. These reforms are designed to accomplish the \nfollowing results.  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nto \n\nfinance \n\nthrough \n\nimprovements \n\nImprove  institutional  coordination  for  SME  policy  and \naccess  to  finance  by  (a)  strengthening  the  institutional \nframework  for  SME  policy  formulation;  and  (b)  improving \nSME  access \nin \naccounting  rules  and  guidelines  and  development  of \nnonbank financial instruments.  \nStrengthen  investment  climate  by  (a)  implementing  the \nenterprise  law,  and  (b)  other  policy  reforms  aimed  at \nreducing  transaction  costs  of  doing  business  in  the \nLao PDR;  and  (c)  more  transparency  in  the  regulatory \nenvironment affecting SMEs. \nImprove  trade  policy  and  capacity  development  by  (a) \nreforming the import\u2013export management system including \nmaking measures more transparent and over the medium \nterm,  reforming  the  controlled  list  of  imports;  and  (b) \nstrengthening indigenous capacity to carry out trade policy \nanalysis.  \n\n \nA  grant  of  $15,000,000  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  will  be \nprovided for subprogram 2 of the PSME with terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft Grant Agreement. \n \nThe  subprogram  2  period  is  from  October  2007  to  September  2009, \nwith  a  single  tranche  grant  of  $15  million  to  be  disbursed  when  the \nGovernment has met the conditions for grant effectiveness.  \n \nfunds \nThe  Government  will  use \ngenerated  by  the  grant  proceeds  to  meet  program  expenditures  and \nassociated costs of reform and to help maintain current levels of social \nexpenditure. \n \n\nlocal  currency  counterpart \n\nthe \n\n \nExecuting Agency   Ministry  of  Industry  and  Commerce  (MOIC).

MOIC  will  establish  a  PSME  steering  committee, \nchaired  by  the  minister  of  industry  and  commerce  and  comprising \nsenior  officials  from  BOL,  MOF,  and  MPI.  The  committee  will  meet \ntwice  a  year  to  monitor  progress  and  oversee  implementation  of  the \nPSME, and to provide guidance and direction to the Executing Agency \n(EA) and IAs.  \n \nThe  grant  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange \ncosts  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and \nprocured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and \nimports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. \n \nThe program cluster will provide the following benefits. \n \n\ntransaction  costs \n\ninvestor  confidence \n\nthrough  completion  of \nImproved \nimplementation  of  the  new  enterprise  law  and  a  new \ninvestment law that provides for national treatment. \nLower \nfor  business  because  of \nstreamlined  business  start-up  procedures,  a  reduction  in \nred tape, and reform of remaining non-tariff barriers, which \nwill  open  new  opportunities,  increase  investment  and \nproductivity,  boost  the  economy,  and  increase  incomes \nand create jobs, and sustainable reduction in poverty.  \nStrengthened  institutional  development  through  raising \ncapabilities \ntrade, \ninvestment,  and  SME  policy  analysis  with  the  aim  of \nimproving  the  quality  of  policy,  institutional  processes  for \npolicy making.

The assumptions \nunderlying the Program include the following:   \n \n\nMacroeconomic stability is maintained. \nThe  Government  will  stay  on  course  with  key  business \nregulatory reform measures. \nThe  Government  stays  on  track  with  its  preparations  for \nWTO accession. \n\n \nHowever, there are risks to the Program: \n \n\nIn  transitional  economies,  maintaining  macroeconomic \nstability\u2013\u2013reflected  in  low  inflation  and  a  stable  exchange \nrate\u2013\u2013is  critical  for  investor  confidence  and  private  sector \nto \ngrowth.

The  Government \nrecognizes  these  risks  and  is  undertaking  measures  to \nrevenue  and  strengthen  public  expenditure \nraise \nmanagement, with the assistance of development partners \nincluding ADB.  \nThe  capacity  of  agencies  to  implement  reforms  may  be \nconstrained  by  resources  and  other  emerging  priorities. \nThe  PSME  reduces  this  risk  by  limiting  the  policy  triggers \nto  a  small  number  of  high-priority,  high-impact  policy \nreforms  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  EA  and  a  limited \nnumber  of  IAs  (BOL,  MPI,  and  MOF),  and  by  attaching \ntechnical assistance (TA) to each policy trigger.  \nThere  will  be  resistance  to  some  of  the  reforms  from \nvested  interests,  including  the  dominance  of  the  state \nenterprise sector in some sectors. Reforms to the import\u2013\ninstitutionalizing \nexport  management \nsystem \neconomic  governance  reforms\u2013\u2013i.e.,  red \ntape  review \nprocess\u2013\u2013are  likely  to  be  a  lengthy  process.  Resistance \nmay  also  come  from  entrenched  cultural  and  political \neconomy  factors  that  may  slow  market  economy  reforms \nand  market  competition.  However, \nrisks  are \nmitigated  by  the  following  factors:  (a)  the  PSME  strategic \nthe \napproach \nGovernment\u2019s  initiatives,  and  (b) reforms  will  focus  on \nareas  where  there  is  political  will  and  some  measure  of \ncapacity.  This  has  been  demonstrated  by  the  successful \nimplementation of the enterprise law and establishment of \nthe  enterprise  registry,  which  has  resulted  in  substantial \ncuts  in  business  compliance  costs  and  5,000  enterprises \nregistering for the first time ever.    \n\nfocus  efforts  on  supporting \n\nthese \n\nand \n\nto \n\nis \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for subprogram 2 of the Private Sector and \nSmall and Medium-Sized Enterprises Development Program (PSME). The program design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\nA. \n\nThe Global Financial Crisis \n\n2. \nThe  proposed  second  subprogram  of  the  PSME  comes  at  a  critical  moment  for  the \nLao PDR. It is designed to maintain the momentum of key development efforts at a challenging \ntime of lower commodity prices and a recession last seen in 1998. The impact on the Lao PDR \neconomy of the first round effects of the global financial crisis has been negligible because of \nthe  low  level  of  development  of  the  Lao  PDR  financial  sector  and  limited  exposure  to \ninternational  credit  markets.  The  major  impact  arises  from  the  second  round  effects  of  the \ncollapse in commodity prices and recession in major export markets on the real sector and the \nGovernment\u2019s fiscal situation. Copper prices, for instance, have fallen by more than half in the \nlast  12  months,  significantly  affecting  revenue  flows  to  the  national  budget.  The  Government \nexpects further stress on the fiscal situation in 2010 as tax revenue from the commodity sector \nis  expected  to  drop  substantially  as  corporate  losses  are  carried  over.  In  the  real  sector,  the \nLao PDR  economy  is  also  closely  linked  with  the  Thai  economy,  so  it  is  vulnerable  to  shocks \ntransmitted from Thailand through channels such as extensive border trade, investment, tourism, \nand remittances from overseas workers. Thailand began to experience recessionary conditions \nin the fourth quarter of 2008 and this has clearly had an impact (albeit lagged) on the Lao PDR \nreal sector through a subsequent drop in tourist arrivals and border trade.  \n \nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects an economic slowdown in the Lao PDR \n3. \nfrom a 7.5% economic growth rate in 2008 to 4.5% in 2009. Also the international consensus is \nthat the global economy may only experience a gradual recovery in 2010 and this will affect Lao \nPDR's economic growth prospects next year. Given constraints on raising budget financing, the \nGovernment  has  opted  not  to  provide  a  fiscal  stimulus\u2014instead,  it  will  protect  and  maintain \npublic spending and therefore its poverty reduction goals. With declining resource revenues, the \nGovernment is projecting a budget deficit of about 5% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2009, \nincluding  a  budget  financing  shortfall  of  about  $50  million\u2013$60  million.  While  much  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s current focus is necessarily on addressing exigencies arising from the crisis and \nrelated  fiscal  situation,  it  also  views  the  crisis  as  an  opportunity  (i)  to  build  consensus  among \nstakeholders  on  difficult  policy  reform  issues,  and  (ii)  to  advance  its  medium-term  objectives \nrelated  to  private  sector  and  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  development.  It \nrecognizes  that  these  reforms  are  fundamental  to  supporting  higher  economic  growth  rates, \nlessening reliance on the resource sector for income creation, and reducing unemployment and \npoverty.  \n \nB. \n\nThe Government\u2019s Development Strategy \n\n4. \nIn  2006,  the  Government  announced  its  Sixth  Five-Year  National  Socio-Economic \nDevelopment  Plan  (SEDP6), 1  2006\u20132010,  setting  out  the  country\u2019s  development  priorities, \n\n                                                 \n1 Committee for Planning and Investment, Government of the Lao PDR. 2006. National Socio-Economic \n\nDevelopment Plan, 2006\u20132010. Vientiane. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n  \n\n \n\n \n\npolicy  agenda,  programs,  and  projects  for  the  current  period.  A  key  pillar  of  the  SEDP6  is  to \nachieve  higher  and  more  sustainable  economic  growth  and  create  jobs  through  private  sector \ndevelopment\u2014with  emphasis  on  commercial  agriculture,  rural  development,  infrastructure \ndevelopment,  and  fostering  SMEs.  To  help  implement  the  SEDP6  priority  for  private  sector \ngrowth, the Government adopted a range of sector-specific strategies, most with a time-bound \nimplementation  plan  and  clearly  defined  ministerial  responsibilities,  some  of  which  are \nsupported by Asian Development Bank (ADB) sector programs and technical assistance (Figure \n1). The SME strategy outlines a road map for longer term development of the sector, including \nregulatory  reform  and  improved  access  to  finance.  The  Law  on  Enterprises  of  2006  reflects \nreform priorities under the SME strategy and its implementation, and is the responsibility of the \nMinistry  of  Industry  and  Commerce  (MOIC).  MOIC\u2019s  trade  policy  priorities  are  anchored  in  its \nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) accession efforts, and include reforming its import and export \nmanagement  system  and  trade  facilitation  (such  as  enhancing  its  sanitary  and  phytosanitary \nregulatory  system).  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  has  a  public  financial  management  reform \nprogram with supporting technical assistance (TA) from ADB and other development partners, \nand  includes  the  development  of  a  medium-term  expenditure  framework,  internal  control \nsystems,  and  accounting  reforms.  The  Government  has  also  drafted  a  financial  sector \ndevelopment  strategy  (up  to  2020),  which  has  been  submitted  to  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Office \n(PMO) for approval. The strategy covers development of the banking sector, nonbank financial \ninstitutions, microfinance, the capital market, and financial sector infrastructure.  \n \nC. \n\nThe Government and its Development Partners \n\n5. \nADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP)  2007\u20132011  for  the  Lao  PDR  identified \nprivate  sector  development  as  a  key  thematic  initiative.2 The  CSP  emphasizes  that  ADB  will \nassist the Government to improve the climate for private sector development through support for \npolicy,  institutional,  and  regulatory  reform  in  sectors  in  which  ADB  operates\u2014transforming  the \nagriculture  sector  from  subsistence  farming  to  a  commercial  orientation,  improving  basic \ntransport  and  power  infrastructure,  strengthening  the  regulatory  regime  governing  financial \ninstitutions,  restructuring  state-owned  commercial  banks,  improving  investment  regulations, \nfostering  SME  growth,  mobilizing  resources  and  broadening  access  to  financing  for  private \nsector development, and enhancing the soundness and sustainability of public finance.  \n \n6. \nThe PSME program operationalizes the CSP  by providing support for business climate \nand  trade  reforms  and  related  capacity  building  at  the  relevant  agencies.  The  program  is \nstructured as a cluster and aims to help the Government achieve its medium- to long-term goals \nof  sustained  economic  growth  of  7%\u20138%  per  annum,  expansion  of  the  private  sector,  and \npoverty  reduction.  The  PSME  focuses  on  three  core  areas  directly  affecting  private  sector \ndevelopment and growth: (i) institutional coordination in SME policy formulation and access to \nfinance,  (ii)  investment  climate,  and  (iii)  trade  policy  and  capacity  development.  Besides \nadvancing  the  policy  reform  agenda,  a  core  objective  of  the  PSME  program  is  capacity \ndevelopment  at  the  relevant  agencies,  and  staff  training  to  undertake  analytical  work  and \nstrengthen  policy  formulation.  The  PSME  builds  on  and  continues  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  with \nthe  Government  in  this  area,  which  has  been  ongoing  since  2004.  This  engagement  has \ncontributed to a number of significant developments in recent years, including formulation of a \nnew enterprise law, its implementing decrees such as the negative list, as well as development \nof the SME strategy.  \n\n                                                 \n2   ADB. 2006.

Manila.  \n\nMedium-term  programmatic  approach.  Key \n\n \ninclude  \n7. \n(i) two single tranche operations, with a well-defined, medium-term framework specified at the \noutset and including completion of high-impact reforms prior to consideration by ADB\u2019s Board of \nDirectors; (ii) triggers for the subsequent subprogram to support continuity of dialogue with the \nGovernment, development partners, and other stakeholders; and (iii) a limited number of well-\ntargeted policy actions aimed at achieving high-impact outcomes regarding improvement of the \nenabling  environment  for  private  sector  development.  In  this  way,  the  Program  provides  a \n\nfeatures  of \n\nthe  PSME \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n  \n\n \n\n \n\ncoherent  medium-term  reform  strategy  with  two  discrete  but  linked  subprograms  and  a  strong \nemphasis on performance, as the decision on whether to proceed with the next subprogram is \ncontingent  on  overall  satisfactory  performance  of  the  triggers.  It  recognizes  the  necessity  for \nflexibility  in  the  reform  measures,  with  provisions  for  incorporating  lessons  and  responding  to \nchanges in the external environment in the design of subprogram 2. \n \n8. \n \n\nThe Program has the following three phases:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nSubprogram 1. Financed by ADB ($5 million) in 2007, subprogram 1 focused on \nkey legislative reforms to the enterprise registration regime; it began the process \nfor  SME  policy  and  institutional  strengthening,  and  trade  policy  reforms;  and \ncreated  the  basis  for  continuous  policy  dialogue  and  engagement  over  2007\u2013\n2009 (subprogram 2).3  \nSubprogram 2. The current phase, to be financed by ADB ($15 million), focuses \non  implementing  business  climate  reforms  and  SME  institutional  development. \nSubprogram 2 supports the Government\u2019s efforts to improve trade policy capacity, \nespecially as the Lao PDR increases its efforts preparing for WTO accession.  \nPost-program  monitoring  framework.  In  response  to  the  global  economic \ncrisis,  a  post-program  monitoring  framework  is  a  new  instrument  added  to \nsubprogram 2. The Government and ADB have agreed to a post-PSME  program \nframework  in  the  next  12  months,  creating  the  basis  for  continuous  policy \ndialogue  and  engagement  during  the  critical  period  of  2009\u20132010.  The \nmonitoring  framework  focuses  on  the  Government\u2019s  short-term  plan  advancing \nits  reforms  in  business  climate,  trade  policy,  and  trade  facilitation  (a  new \ncomponent)  supported  by  ADB  and  other  development  partners'  technical  and \nprogram  assistance.  It  may  provide  the  basis  for  a  second-generation  PSME \nprogram in the future. \n\n \nGovernment  and  development  partner  coordination.  The  PSME  program  works \n9. \nclosely with other development partners\u2014the Australian Agency for International Development \n(AusAID), the European Commission (EC), German development cooperation through GTZ, the \nInternational  Finance  Corporation  (IFC),  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA),  and \nthe World Bank\u2014and stakeholders to provide support to private sector development in the Lao \nPDR  (Appendix  4).  In  particular,  the  EC  is  providing  parallel  financing  for  TA  (\u20ac3 million) \ndesigned to support implementation of the PSME program cluster and to work closely with ADB \nto broaden the private sector and SME reform agenda, and support the Government\u2019s efforts to \nstrengthen  institutional  capacity  for  policy  formulation.  The  ADB  and  EC  teams  are  joint \nmembers of the Government\u2019s SME steering committee, chaired by the minister of industry and \ncommerce, established under the PSME program. Program progress is reported to the steering \ncommittee  every  semester.  ADB  also  participates  in  the  Lao  Business  Forum  and  works  with \nthe  Mekong  Private  Sector  Facility  of  the  IFC.  The  forum,  established  in  2005,  comprises \nrepresentatives from the Lao PDR private sector, senior government officials, stakeholders, and \ndevelopment  partners.  The  primary  purpose  of  the  forum  is  as  a  vehicle  to  promote  ongoing \ndialogue between the private sector, the Government, and other stakeholders on private sector \ndevelopment issues.  \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB.  2007.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR \n\nA. \n\nRecent Economic Developments and the Impacts of the Global Financial Crisis \n\n10. \nSustained  economic  growth.  In  2008,  the  Lao  PDR  economy  continued  the  strong \nexpansion that began in 2005. The economy is estimated to have grown by 7.2% in 2008, which \nis similar to rates achieved in 2006 and 2007 and well above the average growth rate of 6% per \nannum from 1990 to 2004. Table 1 presents data on key indicators over 2004\u20132008 to show the \nimproved  macroeconomic  performance  in  recent  years.  Robust  growth  in  2008  has  occurred \nacross  all  the  major  economic  sectors\u2014the  mining  and  power  sectors,  and  to  a  lesser  extent \nmanufacturing, were the main engines of growth, followed by services and agriculture. In 2007, \nexports of goods and services increased by 17% to reach $1.3 billion and they are estimated to \nhave  grown  about  24%  in  2008.  Tourism  also  performed  well.  More  than  1.6 million  tourists \nvisited  the  Lao  PDR  in  2007,  generating  over  $200  million.  About  1.8 million  visitors  are \nestimated  to  have  visited  the  Lao  PDR  in  2008,  providing  impetus  for  continuation  of  a \nconstruction boom in Vientiane and Luang Prabang, two major tourist destinations. Indicators of \ninvestment goods (such as domestic cement sales, other construction materials, and imports of \ncapital goods) suggest investment growth was strong in 2007 and 2008. Foreign investment in \nthe  non-mining  sector  increased,  with  investments  in  sectors  where  the  Lao  PDR  has  a \ncomparative advantage (tourism and commercial agriculture). \n \n11.  Macroeconomic conditions. The current account in the balance of payments remained \nin  deficit  at  16%  of  GDP  in  2008,  driven  by  investments  in  the  resource  sectors.  Grants  and \nforeign investment flows lifted gross international reserves in 2007 and the first half of 2008, but \ninternational reserves declined in the second half of 2008 as investment inflows slowed with the \nonset of the global financial crisis. Overall, the import coverage of gross international reserves \nwas 3.4 months at the end of December 2008. Inflation was a problem in the first half of 2008, \nas  the  surge  in  international  food  prices  transmitted  into  domestic  inflation\u2014reaching  11%  in \nAugust  2008  on  a  year-on-year  basis\u2014but  it  has  since  fallen  to  \u20131.5%  in  July  2009.  Other \nmacroeconomic indicators (such as the public debt\u2013GDP ratio) continue to improve. Estimates \nof  the  budget  outturn  for  the  fiscal  year  (FY)  2008  indicated  revenues  slightly  surpassing  the \nbudget program target and expenditures in line with the budget program, resulting in an overall \nnational government budget deficit of 2.1% of GDP, down from 2.8% (Appendix 5).4  \n \n12. \nRemarkable  progress  in  reducing  poverty.  Using  the  national  poverty  line,  the \nincidence  of  poverty  in  the  Lao  PDR  has  declined  from  46%  in  1992  to  an  estimated  28%  in \n2008. The reduction in the poverty rate took place as the economy began to recover from the \nAsian  financial  crisis  in  the  late  1990s,  and  much  of  it  took  place  in  the  poorest  parts  of  the \ncountry. Factors contributing to this remarkable reduction in poverty incidence include sustained \nper  capita  income  expansion,  greater  labor  mobility  between  rural  and  urban  areas  and \nurbanization,  higher  rice  production,  private  sector  expansion,  and  improvements  in  market \naccess  both  domestically  and  in  neighboring  countries.  The  Lao  PDR  is  on  track  in  terms  of \nmeeting the income poverty Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015.  \n \nImpact of global financial crisis on the Lao PDR. The direct and indirect effects of the \n13. \nglobal  financial  crisis  on  the  Lao  PDR  banking  system  have  been  limited,  as  financial  sector \nassets account for less than 15% of GDP, its exposure to international credit markets is limited, \nand  the  Government  does  not  access  international  commercial  credit  markets  to  finance  its \nbudget.  The  major  impact  on  the  Lao  PDR  economy  comes  from  the  second  round  effects  of \n\n                                                 \n4  Based on the IMF definition of the overall budget balance. The IMF definition differs slightly from the Government\u2019s \n\ndefinition in that the IMF excludes amortization of debt from the calculation of the budget balance. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n  \n\n \n\n \n\nglobal  demand  destruction,  the  collapse  in  international  commodity  prices,  and  their  feedback \ninto  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal  situation.  In  particular,  the  Lao  PDR  economy  is  linked  to \nThailand\u2019s  economy.  ADB  staff  estimates  indicate  that  a  1%  decline  in  Thai  economic  growth \nwill  result  in  a  1%\u20132%  decline  in  Lao  PDR  economic  growth  in  the  non-resource  sector. \nThailand  began  to  experience  recessionary  conditions  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2008  and  the \neconomy contracted by 6% in the first quarter of 2009 on a year-on-year basis. The impact on \nthe Lao PDR real sector has not been immediate; instead, a transmission lag is being observed \nthrough a subsequent drop in tourist arrivals of about 10% in the last 6 months, with spillovers to \ntourism-related  sectors  and  sluggish  border  trade.  Garment  exports\u2014mainly  to  the  European \nmarkets\u2014fell  in  2008  and  are  expected  to  drop  significantly  from  the  second  quarter  of  2009 \nonward. \n\n14.  With  this  background,  the  Government  has  revised  its  macroeconomic  framework  and \nprojects  growth  of  5.5%  in  2009.  The  IMF  projects  lower  economic  growth  of  4.5%  based  on \nfaltering  garment  exports,  a  fall  in  resource  revenues,  and  a  slowdown  in  foreign  investment. \nThis  translates  to  a  negative  output  gap  of  2.5%  of  GDP  (i.e.,  actual  economic  growth  is \n2.5 percentage  points  below  the  potential  economic  growth  rate,  Figure  2e).  It  is  the  potential \nfeedback from a slowing real sector to the banking sector that has increased vulnerabilities of \nthe domestic banking sector. While the banking sector is in a better financial situation in 2009 \nthan 3 years ago, the capital asset ratios of the state-owned commercial banks are still low and \nthey remain vulnerable to relatively modest shocks. Banks will be tested through the impact of \nthe crisis on their borrowers, with the number of nonperforming loans expected to rise if the poor \neconomic conditions persist (Appendix 5). \n\nFeedback  to  fiscal  policy.  The  global  financial  crisis  has  affected  fiscal  policy  in  two \n15. \nways. First, the collapse in commodity prices, especially copper (the main mineral export), from \nthe third quarter of 2008 has reduced resource revenue flows to the national budget by about \n1%  of  GDP  below  budget  target.  Fiscal  stress  is  expected  to  increase  in  2010  as  profit  taxes \nfrom  the  resource  sector  shrink  further  on  the  carryover  of  losses  from  FY2009.  Second, \nbecause  of  constraints  in  budget  financing,  the  Government  is  unable  to  provide  for  a  fiscal \nstimulus;  instead,  its  priority  is  to  maintain  public  spending.  As  a  result  of  the  shortfalls  in \nresource revenues, the Government projects that its budget deficit will rise from the initial target \nof 3.4% of GDP to about 5% in 2009, creating a budget shortfall of $50 million\u2013$60 million. The \ndeficit  could  be  higher  if  non-resource  tax  collection  falls  short  of  its  budget  target  in  2009. \nBased on the IMF definition of the overall budget balance, the deficit could be as high as 7.9% \n(Appendix  5).  The  fiscal  constraint  is  putting  at  risk  the  recent  gains  in  social  spending, \nespecially in education. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\n \n2008 \n\n7.2 \n2.0 \n10.0 \n9.7 \n \n1,639.0 \n2,816.0 \n1,767.0 \n \n \n7.6 \n3.2 \n18.4 \n53.1 \n \n10.3 \n(16.5) \n636 \n \n \n \n(3.4) \n(2.1) \n\nTable 1: Key Macroeconomic Indicators in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic  \n(percentage of GDP, unless otherwise indicated) \n\nIndicator  \nReal Sector \nReal GDP growth (%) \n\nAgriculture \nIndustry \nServices \n\nExports \nImports \n\nMerchandise trade ($ million)a \n\n2006 \n\n2007 \n\n8.1 \n3.5 \n21.5 \n5.3 \n \n1,133.0 \n1,589.0 \n1,215.0 \n \n \n6.8 \n4.7 \n17.2 \n63.0 \n\n \n\n7.9 \n6.2 \n6.5 \n12.1 \n \n1,321.0 \n2,156.0 \n1,623.0 \n \n \n4.5 \n5.6 \n38.7 \n59.1 \n\n \n2005 \n\n7.1 \n2.5 \n15.9 \n6.7 \n \n   697.0 \n1,270.0 \n1,095.0 \n \n \n7.2 \n      8.8 \n8.1 \n  81.0 \n \n7.7 \n    (17.8) \n238.0 \n \n \n \n(3.0) \n(3.3) \n\n12.5 \n(15.8) \n528.0 \n \n \n\n5.7 \n(10.3) \n336.0 \n \n \n\nInternational visitor arrivals (\u2019000) \n \nMonetary Sector \nAnnual inflation (%, average of period) \nAnnual inflation (%, end of year) \nBroad money (% annual growth) \nExternal public debt (end period) \nExternal public debt service ratio  \n  (% of exports) \nCurrent account balance \nGross official reserves ($ million) \n \nPublic Finances \nNational government overall budget \nbalance (authorities definition) \nNational government overall budget   \n  balance (IMF definition)b \nRevenues and grants \n  Tax and nontax revenues  \n         Of which resources \n  Grants \nExpenditures \n  Current expenditures \n  Capital and onlending \n( ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product, IMF = International Monetary Fund, Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s  \nDemocratic Republic. \na  Estimate only. \nb The IMF definition of overall budget balance differs slightly from the Government\u2019s definition in the treatment \nof  amortization  of  debt  and  other  terms.

The most recent data on firm numbers and size is from the 2006 \nindustrial  census  carried  out  by  the  National  Statistics  Office  (Table  2).5 The  census  reports \n126,913 enterprises operating in the Lao PDR in 2006, of which 23% are located in Vientiane. \nOnly  2.4%  of  enterprises  have  10 or  more  employees,  of which  less  than  0.2%  (or  198)  have \nmore  than  100  employees.  The  bulk  of  establishments  (123,800)  are  micro-  and  small-scale \nenterprises with less than 10 workers. Almost two-thirds of enterprises operate in the domestic \ntrade  services  sector,  followed  by  19%  in  the  manufacturing  sector.  This  pattern  of  size \ndistribution in the economy is typical for small, low-income developing economies. In the initial \nstages of development, the private sector is dominated by small-scale enterprises, and as the \neconomy  expands,  competitive  SMEs  may  grow  and  add  to  the  pool  of  larger  firms.  Findings \nfrom  a  recent  survey  of  490  registered  establishments  in  2007  by  GTZ  indicate  that  these \ngrowth  dynamics  are  occurring  in  the  economy.6 The  survey  found  small  but  still  significant \nincreases in the share of large enterprises in terms of the total number of enterprises as well as \nemployment  from  levels  in  2005.  The  majority  of  SMEs  operate  informally,  with  only  an \nestimated 40% holding an enterprise certificate. \n\n17. \nPrivate  sector  growth  and  development.  Measures  of  productivity  and  trade \nfacilitation  costs,  as  well  as  large  recent  investments  in  infrastructure,  suggest  that  conditions \nfor  growth  of  the  Lao  PDR  economy  are  improving.  This  improvement  in  efficiency  of  the \neconomy, located beside the two fastest growing economies in the world (the People\u2019s Republic \nof  China  and  Viet  Nam),  and  middle-income  Thailand,  as  well  as  expected  higher  budget \nrevenues  from  the  resource  sector  in  the  longer  term,  provide  the  Lao  PDR  with  tremendous \npotential for private sector growth and development over the longer term. However, attainment \nof this potential is held back by a range of issues that slow economic integration with neighbors, \ndeter  investment,  and  dampen  productivity  growth.  These  include  (i)  a  weak  institutional \nframework  for  SME  policy  coordination  and  access  to  finance,  (ii)  high  transaction  costs  and \nunpredictability in the investment regime, and (iii) relatively high costs involved in importing and \nexporting goods (Appendix 6).   \n \n\n                                                 \n5 Lao  PDR,  The  Steering  Committee  on  Economic  Census.  2007.

For \nmany developing economies, the problem of coordination failure between the public and private \nsector  is  a  constraint  on  private  sector  and  SME  development.  In  the  Lao  PDR,  with  a  large \nnumber  of  government  agencies  involved  in  the  formulation  of  policies  and  regulations  that \naffect the private sector, lack of a systematic, consultative process for formulation of policy and \nregulation  has  provided  scope  for  policy  unpredictability  and  increased  the  likelihood  of \nregulations that unduly hinder private sector development. Decentralization adds a further layer \nof  complexity  to  the  business  environment  for  firms,  with  local  governments  responsible  for  a \nrange of regulations that have cost and operational implications. Recent reforms, however, have \nhelped establish the framework for a more coherent approach to private sector development. A \nkey  step  in  this  regard  was  the  establishment  of  the  SME  Promotion  and  Development  Office \n(SMEPDO)  in  2004,  providing  a  focal  point  for  championing  reforms  aimed  at  improving  the \nenabling  environment  for  SMEs  in  particular  and  the  private  sector  more  generally.  Under \nsubprogram  1  of  the  PSME,  SMEPDO  formulated  the  national  strategy  for  SME  development \n(2007\u20142012) in 2007 and is charged with overseeing its effective implementation.7 The strategy \nprovides a comprehensive action plan for assisting SMEs in addressing constraints to growth, \nincluding  creating  an  enabling  environment  for  businesses  to  operate.  The  strategy  was \napproved by the PMO in early 2008 after extensive dialogue and consultation with stakeholders \nin the private sector through the Lao Business Forum, the Lao National Chamber of Commerce \nand  Industry,  other  groups,  and  development  partners.  In  2008,  SMEPDO  established  the \nmonitoring unit in response to demand from both internal (SMEPDO) and external stakeholders \nof  SMEPDO  for  transparent  information,  good  management,  and  delivery  of  results  under  the \nstrategy.  The  first  monitoring  report  was  produced  in  the  first  quarter  of  2009  and  notes  that, \nwhile implementation was slow at first, it has accelerated in recent months (para 51). \n \n19. \nStrengthening  public\u2013private  dialogue.  While  an  institutional  mechanism  exists \n(i.e., Lao  Business  Forum)  to  support  dialogue  between  the  business  community  and  relevant \nauthorities  at  the  central  government  level,  similar  arrangements  have  been  missing  at  the \nprovincial  level  although  local  governments  are  responsible  for  the  issuance,  implementation, \nand/or enforcement of many regulations that impact the private sector. To provide an effective \nchannel  for  feedback  from  the  private  sector  on  issues  facing  firms  at  the  provincial  level,  the \nGovernment (with support from GTZ) has initiated provincial public\u2013private dialogues (P3Ds) in \n                                                 \n7 SMEPDO. 2008. The Lao Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Strategy. Vientiane. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\na  number  of  pilot  provinces.8 These  are  intended  to  provide  a  regular  forum  to  bring  issues \nfacing firms to the attention of relevant local authorities for resolution at the local level. While the \npiloted P3Ds are in their infancy, they have highlighted common issues facing firms such as skill \nshortages in the workforce, the need for consistent application of taxes, and overly bureaucratic \nprocesses involved in compliance with regulations. While not all issues can be quickly or readily \nresolved,  the  ability  to  bring  them  to  the  attention  of  relevant  authorities  on  a  regular  basis \nthrough  a  public  forum  is  a  significant  new  development  that  has  the  potential  to  spur  more \nresponsive and transparent public administration at the local level. In recognition of their value, \nthe  Government  is  institutionalizing  the  P3Ds  process  in  the  four  pilot  provinces  and  plans  to \nreplicate  it  in  other  provinces  going  forward.  P3Ds,  once  effectively  institutionalized,  can  also \nserve as a natural mechanism for the conduct of stakeholder consultations under key initiatives \nsupported by the Program such as pilot testing regulatory impact assessments. \n \n20. \nAccess  to  finance.  The  finance  sector  of  the  Lao  PDR  is  shallow,  with  the  banking \nsystem constituting the main form of formal financial intermediation. Microfinance institutions are \nexpanding  to  serve  the  needs  of  microenterprises  but  coverage  remains  low.  Consequently, \nSMEs  have  had  limited  access  to  formal  sources  of  financing,  and  generally  rely  on  retained \nearnings  and  informal  sources.  The  2008  GTZ  enterprise  survey  of  2007  found  that  50%  of \nentrepreneurs  surveyed  reported  access  to  capital  as  a  major  constraint  to  their  growth \n(footnote  6).  The  Government,  with  assistance  from  ADB  through  the  Banking  Sector  Reform \nProgram  (BSRP)  completed  in  March  2009 9  and  the  Rural  Financial  Sector  Development \nProgram (RFSDP)10 on track to be completed in 2011, have helped to restore the health of the \nbanking  sector  gradually,  improving  the  competitive  environment  and  developing  microfinance \ninstitutions.  The  Lao  Development  Bank,  a  state-owned  commercial  bank,  has  refocused  its \nmarket segment to serving SMEs. \n \n21. \nHowever,  SMEs  face  legal  and  capacity  constraints  in  accessing  finance,  and  these \nneed to be  addressed if SMEs are  going to benefit from recent banking sector developments. \nConstraints include weak protection of creditors\u2019 rights, which means that banks largely rely on \nthe  use  of  fixed  assets  (e.g.,  land  and  buildings)  as  collateral  to  secure  loans,  placing  SMEs \ngenerally  at  a  disadvantage  in  accessing  credit.  The  Government  is  addressing  this  through \nreforms  such  as  preparation  of  a  draft  decree  on  secured  transactions  that  would  provide  a \nframework for using a wider range of assets (including movable assets) as collateral for loans. \nAnother critical constraint is limited credit information on customers that allows banks to assess \ncredit  risk.  Currently,  requests  by  banks  for  such  information  are  processed  by  the  central \nbank\u2019s  Credit  Information  Bureau  (CIB)  using  an  inefficient  manual  paper-based  system\u2014that \ncan  often  take  up  to  a  week  to  generate  responses.  Upgrading  to  a  system  based  on  a \ncentralized  database  that  allows  commercial  banks  to  search  for  and  update  customer  credit \ninformation  in  real  time  could  significantly  reduce  the  time  and  costs  involved  in  credit \nassessment.  Another  constraint  is  the  limited  range  of  alternative  financial  products  to  bank \nloans  available  to  SMEs.  Under  the  BSRP,  the  Government  drafted  and  submitted  a  lease \nfinancing  decree  to  the  PMO  in  February  2008  establishing  a  regulatory  framework  for  the \nleasing industry, with the aim of developing the sector. The decree was approved in July 2009. \nA  final  constraint  is  the  poor  accounting  and  financial  reporting  capacity  of  SMEs,  which  also \nlimits access to finance. According to the GTZ enterprise survey, 75% of microenterprises, 54% \n\n                                                 \n8 Champasak, Louangphrabang, Louang-Nam Tha, and Savannakhet. \n9 ADB.  2009.

Under subprogram 1, the Government enacted a new \naccounting  and  auditing  law  and  is  currently  disseminating  information  and  accounting \nstandards to the business community, with assistance from the EC under its SME project.  \n \n\n2. \n\nInvestment Climate   \n\n \n22. \nThe Lao PDR has enjoyed sustained investment expansion since 2000. Reforms to the \nbusiness environment since the early 1990s\u2014with the enactment of the Business Law of 1994, \nforeign  and  domestic  investment  laws  in  2004,  the  enterprise  law  of  2006  (replacing  the \nbusiness law), and other commercial legislation\u2014contributed to this expansion. FDI is critical to \ndevelopment  of  the  Lao  PDR  at  its  current  level  of  development  and  with  its  undeveloped \nfinancial sector. Evidence shows that FDI brings important externalities to local firms, suppliers, \nand workers through technology and skill transfers. Successful entry of FDI breeds success and \nthis attracts additional FDI in other sectors. It is also associated with improved employment and \npoverty  reduction.  Figure  3  shows  a  big  jump  in  annual  FDI  approvals  since  2000  across  all \nmajor sectors. The composition of this growth has also changed with the increase in the share \nof  projects  going  to  agriculture,  mining,  and  hotels\u2014indicative  of  the  Lao  PDR\u2019s  comparative \nadvantage  in  tourism  and  natural  resources.  While  current  data  are  not  available,  anecdotal \nevidence suggests that this investment has slowed in 2009 because of the global financial crisis \nand collapse in commodity prices.  \n \n\nFigure 3: Foreign Direct Investment Approvals \n(number of projects) \n \n\n \n\nHotel\n\nWood\n\nMining\n\nIndustry \n\nHydropower\n\nAgriculture \n\n2007 \n2000 \n\n               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n              Source: Ministry of Planning and Investment. \n \n23. \nUpdate  on  constraints  on  investment.  The  2008  GTZ  enterprise  survey  of  2007 \nreiterated the key constraints to investment attractiveness in the Lao PDR such as infrastructure \n(mainly roads, water, and electricity supply reliability); excessive red tape; labor skills; taxation; \nand  access  to  finance.  The  ADB-World  Bank  investment  climate  survey  carried  out  in  2005 \nfound  that  ranking  of  constraints  differed  across  major  sectors.11 Manufacturing  firms  ranked \ninfrastructure, regulations, and taxation as their top three constraints, while operators in tourism \n\nOther\n\n10 \n\n50 \n\n20\n\n40\n\n30\n\n0 \n\n                                                 \n11  ADB  and  World  Bank.  2007.

According  to  the  GTZ  survey,  more  investors  feel  that  excessive  red  tape  and \nfinding skilled labor are bigger problems in 2007 than in 2005, while competitive pressures are \nless  of  a  problem  in  2007,  and  no  change  has  been  observed  in  infrastructure  (Appendix  6). \nSome caution should be taken when comparing changes in perception over time as these are \nshaped  from  a  combination  of  first-hand  experiences  as  well  as  exposure  to  new  knowledge \nabout best international or regional practices (which may be particularly significant in transition \neconomies like the Lao PDR). On a global comparison, the Lao PDR ranks relatively low. The \nDoing Business report 2009 ranks the Lao PDR 165th out of 181 countries, slipping three places \nover its ranking in 2008 (Appendix 6).12  \n \nProgress  on  business  registration.  Until  recently,  several  steps  were  required  to \n24. \nregister an enterprise\u2014involving several agencies, depending on the sector, and an excessive \namount  of  documentation.  Firms  were  required  to  produce  18  documents  and  obtain  pre-\napproval from relevant line ministries and other authorities to qualify for registration. Under this \nsystem, it took firms 60 days on average to obtain a basic registration certificate, along with the \nexpenditure of significant staff and other resources. Reregistration was required each year, so \nsuch costs were incurred on an annual basis. These costs provided a significant disincentive for \nfirms to register, weakening the Government\u2019s ability to increase the tax base or monitor private \nsector development effectively. Significant costs were also imposed on the Government, arising \nfrom the resources required to administer such a system (well over 300 staff were employed in \nthis  regard).  A  2009  ADB  study  (red  tape  study)  estimated  that  the  enterprise  registration \nsystem  cost  the  business  community  more  than  $6  million  annually  to  comply  with  the \nregistration process.13 \n \n25. \nThe  Government  has  made  significant  progress  in  modernizing  the  business  licensing \nprocess.  Notably,  under  the  new  enterprise  law,  registration  procedures  have  been  markedly \nstreamlined,  and  the  period  allowed  for  registration  of  enterprises  not  on  the  negative  list  has \nbeen  limited  to  10  days  (compared  with  60  days  on  average  in  practice  under  the  previous \nregime).14 To help meet these targets, the Government is modernizing its enterprise registration \nsystem. MOIC, with ADB technical assistance has simplified enterprise registration procedures \nand  developed  a  computerized  system  that  allows  for  more  efficient  implementation  of  the \nregistration  process  as  well  as  monitoring  of  firms,  through  use  of  a  centralized  database  in \nVientiane linked via internet to client systems in provincial enterprise registry offices. 15 The new \nsystem  began  operation  in  August  2008  with  four  pilot  provinces  and  is  being  rolled  out \nnationwide in a phased manner\u2014with coverage of all 17 provinces expected to be complete by \nlate 2010 (para. 57). \n \n26. \nInvestment  law.  The Foreign Investment Law and the Domestic Investment Law were \namended in 2004 and were important milestones in the Lao PDR\u2019s transition to an open market \neconomy, as they set out a broad framework to promote investment. However, they have major \nweaknesses.  As  foreign  and  domestic  investors  are  covered  under  different  investment  laws \nand  approval  conditions,  national  or  equal  treatment  is  compromised.  There  is  an  element  of \n\n                                                 \n12 World Bank. 2009. Doing Business 2009. Washington, DC. \n13 ADB. 2009.

Manila.  \n\n \n\n\f14 \n  \n\n \n\n \n\nunpredictability  in  the  administration  of  investment  incentives,  as  the  duration  of  some \nincentives appears to be open-ended. The list of sectors closed to foreign investment, or open \nunder certain conditions, is not consistent with the negative list under the enterprise law of 2006. \nMost countries have shifted away from using a positive list for foreign investment to a negative \nlist, as it increases transparency and predictability for investors. Ideally, the list of conditional or \nclosed sectors under the investment law should be synchronized with those on the negative list \nunder  the  enterprise  law;  i.e.,  the  list  of  sectors  on  both  lists  should  be  consistent.  Given  the \nimportance of FDI to Lao PDR development, these issues in the investment regime need to be \naddressed. \n \n27. \nExcessive  red  tape.  While  the  enterprise  law  addresses  problems  with  registration,  it \ndoes  not  deal  with  other  operating  business  licenses  issued  by  line  agencies.  There  is \nexcessive red tape affecting business operations. Under current practice, regulations are often \nformulated  in  an  ad  hoc  manner  by  technical  staff  in  line  ministries  subject  to  tight  deadlines, \nwhich leaves little room for stakeholder consultation or assessment of costs to individual firms or \nthe  economy  as  a  whole.  This  has  helped  contribute  to  an  existing  stock  of  business-related \nregulations that are unduly burdensome and costly for the private sector, serving to undermine \nthe competitiveness of Lao PDR firms and weakening the country\u2019s attractiveness to investment. \n \n28. \nThe  ADB  red  tape  study  estimates  that  firms  incur  annual  average  expenses  of \nKN4.1 million  to  comply  with  the  three  most  common  types  of  licenses  (referred  to  as \npermissions  in  Lao  PDR)\u2014enterprise  registration  certificate,  sector  operation  license,  and  tax \ncertificate (footnote 13). This cost the business community an estimated KN266 billion annually \nin 2008, or 0.7% of GDP (Figure 4a). Firms typically have to comply with dozens of regulations, \ndepending  on  their  line  of  business,  which  adds  to  business  compliance  costs.  A  realistic \nestimate  of  total  compliance  costs  would  be  1.5%\u20133.0%  of  GDP.  The  major  component  of \nbusiness  compliance  costs  is  the  enterprise\u2019s  staff  time  and  own  financial  resources  used  to \nprepare documentation and apply for the license. The burden of business regulatory costs falls \ndisproportionately on small enterprises.  On an employee basis, business compliance costs are \nmuch  higher  in  small  enterprises  (KN258,442)  than  in  medium-sized  enterprises  (KN120,000) \nand  large  firms  (KN27,000).  This  illustrates  how  the  regulatory  burden  falls  most  heavily  on \nsmall enterprises in the formal sector, and becomes a barrier to the formalization and growth of \nsmall enterprises.  \n \n29. \nNeed  to  improve  quality  of  regulations  and  reduce  compliance  costs.  The \nGovernment lacks a system whereby laws and regulations affecting licensing and inspection are \nreviewed to determine the impact on the private sector. As a result, the regulatory compliance \ncosts  imposed  on  the  private  sector  are  not  appreciated.  To  help  improve  the  quality  of \nregulations and minimize compliance costs for the private sector, a more systematic approach \nneeds  to  be  taken  in  their  formulation  and/or  review.  Ideally,  and  following  international  best \npractice on regulatory impact assessment, this would involve use of a  systematic approach to \nassess  and make  transparent  the  costs  of  particular  regulations  for  individual  firms  as  well  as \nthe  economy  as  a  whole  (Appendix  6).  This  is  a  long-term  effort.  As  a  starting  point,  the \nGovernment  should  start  with  raising  public  awareness  on  the  need  for  a  regulatory  reform \nprogram,  and  achieve  broad  agreement  on  the  appropriate  plan  and  institutional  set-up  for \naddressing red tape over the longer term. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f  (a) Compliance costs by common licenses      \n\n      (b) Composition of compliance costs  \n\nFigure 4: Business Compliance Costs \n\n \n\n15\n\nFacilitation fees\n7%\n\nOfficial fees\n32%\n\nEnterprises' staff \nTime Costs\n61%\n\n (c) Compliance costs by firm sizea \n\n \n\n      (d) Compliance cost by sector \n\n  \n\n500\n\n800\n\n1,100 1,400 1,700 2,000\n\nAmount per firm (KN'000)\n\n \n\nProfessional certificate of pharmacy\n\nEnterprise registration\n\nImport certificate\n\nEntertainment license\n\nTax certificate\n\nOperational license\n\nDrug registration\n\n'\n\n0\n0\n0\nN\nK\n \ne\ne\ny\no\n\nl\n\np\nm\ne\n \nr\ne\np\n \nt\nn\nu\no\nm\nA\n\n300\n\n250\n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\ncertificate. \n\n0\n0\n0\n\n'\n\nN\nK\n\n \nt\nn\nu\no\nm\nA\n\n7.0\n\n6.0\n\n5.0\n\n4.0\n\n3.0\n\n2.0\n\nMicro-\nennterprises\n\nSmall\nenterprises\n\nMedium\nenterprises\n\nLarge\nenterprises\n\nManufacturing\n\nTrading\n\nPharmaceuticals\n\nTourism\n\n \na  Compliance  costs  per  employee  of  the  three  main  licenses\u2014enterprise  registration,  operational  license,  and  tax \n\n  \n\n \n\nSource: ADB. 2009.

The Government considers WTO accession a key foreign trade policy \npriority  and  this  is  accelerating  the  momentum  for  finishing  the  trade  reform  agenda.  The \nGovernment\u2019s preparations for WTO accession have had an influence on the way it views trade \npolicy and the business climate. In this regard, MOIC is considering ways to accelerate reforms \nto  the  import  and  export  management  system.  It  intends  to  continue  to  reduce  the  number  of \nsectors on the import control list, and streamline and simplify import and export procedures and \nregulations.  The  WTO  accession  efforts  follow  on  from  the  Lao  PDR\u2019s  commitments  to  the \nCommon  Effective  Preferential  Tariff  (CEPT)  schedule  under  the  Association  of  Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN) Free Trade Agreement (AFTA). The Government has made progress in \nimplementing the CEPT schedule for items in the inclusive list (0%\u20135%), which covers 98% of \nall tariff lines. As a consequence of a process of market-oriented reforms that began in the late \n1980s,  the  average  customs  duty  has  fallen  to  about  10%,  which  is  among  the  lowest  in  the \nregion.  Going  forward,  it  is  opportune  to  advance  the  reform  momentum  toward  reducing  the \nremaining  non-tariff  barriers  and  investment  distortions\u2014including  technical  barriers  to  trade \n(TBTs); reform of trade facilitation (logistics, sanitary and phyto-sanitary standards systems, or \n\n \n\n\f16 \n  \n\n \n\n \n\nsanitary  and  phyto-sanitary  standards,  and  customs);  consolidation  of  other  incentives  that \nnegatively  affect  investment  and  trade  decisions;  and  support  for  implementation  of  the \nLao PDR\u2019s  WTO  commitments  once  it  accedes  to  the  WTO  (tentatively  planned  for  2012). \nSubprogram  2  deals  with  a  subset  of  these  reform  areas.  Other  areas  (especially  trade \nfacilitation and post-WTO implementation) are a long-term agenda requiring strong coordination \namong development partners. \n \n31. \nEffective  rates  of  protection.  The  degree  of  protection  afforded  to  domestic  industry \nthrough imposition of custom duties, non-tariff barriers, and domestic taxes on products can be \nmeasured by estimates of the effective rate of protection (ERP). A positive estimate of the ERP \nindicates  the  height  of  protection  afforded  to  domestic  industry  while  a  negative  estimate \nindicates  the  height  of  negative  protection  (or  disincentive  to  produce)  afforded  to  domestic \nindustry. Variations in estimates of ERPs for different sectors of the economy reveal the extent \nof resource misallocation (or distortions) within the economy caused by the trade and tax policy \nregime,  and  provide  a  useful  tool  for  assessing  a  country\u2019s  trade  policy  and  promoting \ntransparency.  ADB  and  MOIC  staff  estimates  of  ERPs  show  that  pockets  of  significant \nprotection  to  industry  remain,  such  as  in  food,  beverages,  and  tobacco  (Table  3).  The  trade \npolicy  and  incentives  regime  appears  to  be  biased  against  sectors  that  have  potential  to  be \nexport-oriented,  as  reflected  in  sizeable  negative  protection  in  some  of  these  sectors \n(agriculture and textile and garments). Once the AFTA CEPT schedule is completed, protection \nin  some  of  these  sectors  (auto  and  motorcycle  assembly,  and  some  processed  foods)  will \ndisappear.  Sector-specific  reforms  may  be  needed  in  some  of  the  others  (e.g.,  cement)  to \nenhance  economic  efficiency  (Appendix  6).  The  estimates  do  not  include  fiscal  investment \nincentives,  which  are  considered  generous  and  vary  across  sectors  and  across  firms  within \nsectors.  If  these  are  included,  the  variation  in  ERPs  could  be  larger.  A  comprehensive \nassessment of investment incentives is necessary.  \n \n32. \nImport licensing and administrative procedures. These are the major remaining non-\ntariff  barriers,  but  are  being  phased  out  by  the  Government  to  be  consistent  with  WTO  rules. \nThe Lao PDR operates an import\u2013export management and control system, identical to the one \noperated  in  Viet  Nam  until  recently.  There  are  two  key  features  of  the  import  and  export \nmanagement system. The first feature is the import licensing regulation and its identification of \nitems  subject  to  restrictive  import  licensing.  It  categorizes  imports  into  three  categories:  (i) \nprohibited goods,16 (ii) controlled goods, and (iii) general goods that are easily imported. Goods \nmay be prohibited based on public safety, environmental, or moral concerns, but not to protect \ndomestic producers. The controlled category deals with licenses for imports that are not banned \nbut managed by MOIC. Until October 2006, these included about 25 broadly defined items such \nas prepared foods and all raw and semi-manufactured products used in manufacturing. MOIC is \nreforming the import and export management system and has made substantial reforms since \n2006  to  reduce  trade  facilitation  costs.  The  list  of  items  on  the  controlled  list  was  revised  in \nOctober  2006.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  Government  has  revised  the  import  regulation  to  be \nconsistent with WTO requirements, including the use of non-automatic and automatic licenses. \nThe  number  of  import  items  subject  to  non-automatic  licenses  on  the  controlled  list  has  also \nbeen further reduced (para 61). \n\n                                                 \n16 The list of prohibited goods and controlled goods set out in MOIC notice No. 1376 of October 2006. Previous MOIC \n    notices of prohibited goods and controlled goods were set out in notices No. 284 and 285 of March 2004. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nTable 3: Industry Protection\u2014Effective Rates of Protection (%) \n\nSector \nCrops \nLivestock and poultry \nForestry and logging \nMining and quarrying \nFood, beverages, and tobacco \nTextiles, garments, and leather products \nWood and paper products, printing, and publication \nChemical products \nNon-metallic mineral products \nMetal products, machinery \nOther manufactured products \n\nExport or \nImport Sector \n\nE \nE \nE \nE \nI \nE \nE \nI \n   I \n   I \n   I \n\nERP \n\n(5.0) \n(8.0) \n(11.8) \n(11.0) \n104.8 \n(6.8) \n(0.4) \n2.0 \n(4.3) \n9.5 \n6.1 \n\n( ) = negative, E = export-oriented sector, ERP = effective rate of protection, I = import-oriented sector.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank and Ministry of Industry and Commerce staff estimates.  \n \n\n33. \nThe  second  feature  of  the  import\u2013export  management  system  in  need  of  reform  has \nbeen the import administrative procedures as defined under prime minister's decree 205 and its \ncirculars.  Over  the  last  3  years,  however,  these  have  been  significantly  rationalized  with  the \nremoval of MOIC officials at customs posts as well as the requirement for producers to provide \nimport  plans.  The  Government  is  preparing  revisions  to  the  regulation  to  ensure  consistency \nwith WTO rules, especially in relation to trading rights and administration of quotas. \n \n34. \nTechnical  barriers  to  trade.  In  preparation  for  WTO  accession,  the  Government  is \nreviewing  technical  barriers  to  trade,  such  as  those  related  to  sanitary  and  phyto-sanitary \nstandards  (SPS),  with  a  view  to  making  them  consistent  with  WTO  rules.  This  will  involve \nestablishing  procedures  for  notifying  SPSs  and  other  TBTs  to  the  WTO,  and  designating  an \ninquiry  point  within  government  for  such  notifications.  Early  progress  has  been  made  in \nstrengthening the SPS regulatory environment to ensure consistency with the WTO, as a series \nof decrees was issued related to food safety management\u2014including principles for application \nof SPSs and technical measures for food safety management, plant protection, and quarantine \nlaw.  As  the  Government  considers  completion  of  WTO  commitments  important  for  its  world \ntrade integration efforts, it must strengthen the capacity to implement the required policy reforms \nand to establish compliance notification procedures across relevant agencies.  \n \n35. \nCapacity  building  in  trade  policy.  The  institutional  arrangements  and  processes  for \nmaking trade policy are just as important as reforms to the trade policy regime. The Department \nof Foreign Trade Policy at MOIC sets the broad trade policy framework and agenda. It is taking \nthe  lead  in  WTO  preparations  and  has  responsibility  for  AFTA.  With  only  30  staff,  it  is \noverstretched and under-resourced to conduct adequate trade policy analysis\u2014an area that will \nbe critical to support further trade reform and effective participation in the WTO. \n \n36.  While the Department of Foreign Trade Policy has a key role in determining trade policy, \na number of other agencies also play significant parts, including the Department of Export and \nImport Management that sets import and export procedures, and compiles the controlled import \nlist.  The  ministries  of  agriculture,  health,  communication, transport,  post,  and  construction\u2014as \nwell as MOIC\u2014control import licensing in their respective sectors and produce TBTs, including \nSPSs. Ensuring consistency of trade policy across the whole Government will be a challenge, \nas in most countries. It is also important for the Lao PDR to continue to build its own capacity to \ncarry  out  policy  analysis  on  its  merits  for  the  Lao  PDR.  Under  ADB  technical  assistance \n(footnote  15)  training  on  trade  policy  tools  has  been  provided  to  staff  at  MOIC  and  other \nministries,  and  staff  from  the  Department  of  Foreign  Trade  Policy  worked  with  ADB  staff  to \n\n \n\n\f18 \n  \n\n \n\n \n\ndevelop  capacity  to  estimate  ERPs.  Other  activities  included  writing  and  presentation  skills, \nmedia  communication  for  senior  officials,  and  training  on  trade  policy  tools.  ADB  staff  also \nprovided  training  on  free  trade  agreements.  It  will  be  important  to  continue  this  longer  term \ncapacity development to support the reform momentum. \n \n37. \nTrade  facilitation.  The  performance  of  trade  logistic  services  is  critical  to  determine  if \nthe  Lao  PDR  can  trade  goods  and  services  on  time  and  at  low  costs.  A  cross-country  study \nconducted  by  the  World  Bank17 suggests  that  high  logistics  costs  and,  more  importantly,  low \nlevel  of  services  are  barriers  to  trade  and  hence,  growth.  Available  indicators  suggest  that \nLao PDR businesses bear a higher cost of logistics than other countries in the region (Figure 5). \nThe  logistics  performance  index  ranks  the  Lao  PDR  above  most  countries  in  the  region, \nmeaning  it  is  less  efficient  (costly  and  time-consuming).  This  index  is  developed  based  on  a \ncomprehensive  survey  of  supply  chain  performance,  including  customs  procedures,  logistic \ncosts, infrastructure quality, and the competence of the domestic logistics industry. \n \n38. \nSPS are crucial to microeconomic infrastructure to improve the private sector\u2019s access to \nthe international market for agro-based products. Lao PDR exports of such products are in their \ninfancy,  and  inadequate  SPS  management  systems  are  an  obstacle  to  development  of  such \nexports. The Lao PDR coffee industry has an estimated export value of $60 million only. When it \naccedes  to  the  WTO,  the  Lao  PDR  will  have  agreed  to  SPS  compliance  within  a  transitional \nperiod,  usually  5  years.  Based  on  the  experience  of  Cambodia,  it  is  unlikely  to  achieve  this \ncommitment on time. It will require a comprehensive assessment of the regulatory regime and \nsupporting  institutions.  There  are  no  internationally  accredited  assessors  in  the  Lao  PDR  and \nthe technical capacity of laboratories to undertake SPS-related testing is very limited. Therefore, \nmuch  needs  to  be  done  to  strengthen  the  regulatory  environment,  including  promoting \ncompetition in the sector, developing private sector providers, upgrading equipment, and testing \nprocedures and staff training in the laboratories. The Government recognizes that much needs \nto be done to strengthen SPS management systems and capacity, and that this is a longer term \neffort. It had developed an action plan for SPS under the integrated framework diagnostic study \nundertaken in 2006. The action plan will need to be reviewed in light of WTO accession efforts \nand  developments  in  the  region,  and  its  implementation  started.  ADB\u2019s  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion (GMS) trade facilitation activities are considering ways to harmonize trade facilitation, \nincluding SPS systems, across the GMS.  \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n17 World Bank. 2007.

Connecting to Compete: Trade Logistics in the Global Economy. Washington, DC. \n \nC. \n\nLessons \n\n39.  While  assessing  the  implementation  progress  of  triggers  (Appendix  10),  a  number  of \nlessons were identified and have informed the formulation of subprogram 2. These include the \nfollowing: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe  program  cluster,  with  a  subsequent  subprogram  linked  by  triggers  within  a \nmedium-term framework, has encouraged government ownership of the Program \nand continuous dialogue on policy. \nSubstantial progress on the policy triggers had been made through support from \nTA.  \nThe  approach  of  using  a  program  cluster  with  triggers  contains  adequate \nflexibility  to  respond  to  lessons  identified  during  implementation  and  to \nincorporate  new  developments  in  policy  and  government  priorities,  such  as \nupgrading of the CIB.  \nIn the context of the current global financial crisis and its transmission to the Lao \nPDR, and since subprogram 2 is the final subprogram under this program cluster, \nit is paramount to continue policy dialogue and engagement with the Government \nto  maintain  the  reform  momentum.  The  program  cluster  provides  adequate \nflexibility  though  its  medium-term  framework  to  incorporate  a  post-program \nmonitoring  framework  based  on  the  Government\u2019s  short-term  action  plan \n(Appendix 3 policy matrix). \nSome  of  the  reforms  under  subprogram  2  and  the  post-program  monitoring \nframework are similar to reforms in other ADB programs in the GMS, and lessons \nfrom  these  programs  are  applied  to  subprogram  2  of  the  PSME.  In  particular, \npromoting  reforms \nface \nsignificant  coordination  difficulties  in  an  environment  where  ministries  often \noperate  within  \u201cpolicy  silos\u201d  (i.e.,  in  isolation).  Implementing  reforms  is  made \nharder when the interagency taskforce is mandated with several responsibilities \n\ntaskforces  or  committees \n\ninterministerial \n\nthrough \n\n \n\n\f20 \n  \n\n \n\n \n\nfunctions.  To  overcome \n\nthe  PSME  establishes  a  stand-alone \nand \ninteragency  taskforce  on  regulatory  impact  assessments,  chaired  by  Vice-\nMinister for Industry and Commerce. \n\nthis, \n\n \nAs  a  result,  subprogram  2  incorporates  several  new  important  policy  accomplishments \n40. \nthat  have  enhanced  the  Government\u2019s  agenda  in  the  three  core  areas,  of  which  some  are \ndesigned to further the reform agenda. \n \nDistinct  features  of  the PSME  program  cluster  include  the consultative  approach  taken \n41. \nthroughout its formulation. Under subprogram 1, a series of workshops had been organized for \neach component with a view to achieving the commitment of the Government and stakeholders. \nThe  design  of  TA  was  shaped  in  support  of  implementing  the  five  policy  triggers  under \nsubprogram 2, as well as broadening the reform agenda for subprogram 2 by providing detailed \nanalytical  work  and  active  consultations  with  stakeholders  to  ensure  adequate  \u201cbuy-in\u201d  and \ngovernment ownership of the Program. Examples include high-level policy discussion with the \nGovernment on the level of protection in the economy and the results of the red tape study. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n42. \nThe  impact  of  subprogram  2  is  to  achieve  sustainable  economic  growth  in  the  non-\nresource  sector,  supported  by  increased  contribution  of  the  private  sector  and  SMEs.  The \noutcome  of  subprogram  2  is  an  improved  business  environment  where  the  private  sector  and \nSMEs  operate  efficiently  and  effectively.  An  expanding  private  sector  will  generate  more  and \nbetter jobs, and contribute toward sustainable poverty reduction. \n \n43. \nThe  PSME  program  cluster  includes  a  series  of  policy  reforms  that  underpin  the  key \npriorities of the Lao PDR sixth Social and Economic Development Plan and its sector strategies. \nThese reforms are designed to accomplish the following results.  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nImprove institutional coordination for SME policy and access to finance by \n(a)  strengthening  the  institutional  framework  for  SME  policy  formulation  and  (b) \nimproving SME access to finance through improvements in accounting rules and \nguidelines, and development of nonbank financial instruments. \nStrengthen  the  investment  climate  by  (a)  implementing  the  enterprise  law, \n(b) other  policy  reforms  aimed  at  reducing  the  transaction  costs  of  doing \nbusiness  in  the  Lao  PDR,  and  (c)  more  transparency  in  the  regulatory \nenvironment affecting SMEs. \nImprove trade policy and capacity development by (a) reforming the import\u2013\nexport  management  system,  including  making  measures  more  transparent,  and \nover  the  medium  term  reforming  the  controlled  list  of  imports,  and  (b) \nstrengthening indigenous capacity to carry out trade policy analysis.  \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\nAll 14 policy measures required for subprogram 2 had been carried out by  mid-August \n\n44. \n2009. \n \n45. \nThe  report  and  recommendation  of  the  President  for  subprogram  1  of  the  PSME \nidentified  five  policy  triggers  for  subprogram  2  (footnote  3).  While  assessing  implementation \n\n \nB. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21\n\nprogress, the Government proposed one new policy trigger to recognize recent developments in \nimproving access to finance\u2014the upgrading of the CIB from a manual, paper-based system to a \ncomputerized,  web-based  system.  This  will,  among  other  things,  ease  access  to  finance  by \nallowing  borrowers  to  establish  credit  histories  more  readily  and  by  allowing  banks  to  access \nand  make  use  of  such  information  readily.  This  supplements  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to \ndisseminate  information  on  new  accounting  practices  to  SMEs  (Appendix  10  provides  an \nassessment of subprogram 2 triggers). \n \nIn total, the Government and ADB are focusing on six policy triggers, of which most are \n46. \nsupported by eight measures that support capacity development in the Implementing Agencies \n(IAs) (Appendix 3, policy matrix). The Government has made substantial progress in completing \nthese measures. It has fully or substantially accomplished the six policy triggers. All of the eight \nother supporting (non-triggers) measures have been completed. \n  \n47. \nProgress  in  achieving  the  PSME  performance  indicators  and  targets  set  out  in  the \ndesign and monitoring framework for subprogram 1 and updated for subprogram 2 (Appendix 1) \nhas  been  substantial.  Of  the  12  performance  indicators,  two  are  assessed  as  exceeding \nmedium-term program targets (increase in non-resource exports and number of days to launch \na  business),  six  are  assessed  as  being  on  track  to  achieve  medium-term  targets,  two  have \nslowed  (implementation  of  SME  strategy  and  days  it  takes  to  prepare  import  and  export \ndocumentation), and updated data not yet available for the remaining two indicators. \n \n48. \nIn the spirit of the PSME cluster, which aims to support the Government\u2019s policy reform \nagenda  on  a  continuous  basis  rather  than  through  predetermined  rigid  conditions,  the \nGovernment  asked  that  the  substantial  progress  be  recognized.  Furthermore,  as  individual \ngrants  under  the  PSME  cluster  are  sequenced  to  provide  continuous  support  in  a  predictable \nmanner,  and  subprogram  2  is  the  final  one  of  this  cluster,  it  requested  ADB  and  the \ndevelopment  partners  to  (i)  remain  fully  engaged  as  part  of  the  ongoing  dialogue,  (ii)  support \nand  continuously  monitor  implementation  and  completion  of  the  remaining  policy  triggers, \n(iii) provide longer term capacity development support for a better investment environment, and \n(iv)  support  implementation  of  the  post-PSME  program  monitoring  framework.  ADB\u2019s  program \ncluster approach provides for such flexibility in reform programs that are implemented over time, \nby taking emerging circumstances into account. \n \n\n1. \n\nAccomplishments under Subprogram 2 \n\nSubprogram 2 focuses on three core areas of private sector development\u2014institutional \n49. \ndevelopment  for  SME  policy  and  access  to  finance;  investment  climate;  and  trade  policy, \ncapacity development, and trade facilitation.  \n \n\na. \n\n Improve institutional Coordination for SME Policy and Access to \nFinance \n\n50. \nSubprogram  2  supports  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  (i)  strengthen  the  institutional \nframework  for  promoting  SME  policy  formulation  through  a  consultative  process  with \nstakeholders; and (ii) improve SME access to finance through improvements in accounting rules \nand  guidelines,  and  development  of  nonbank  financial  instruments.  The  following  measures \ntoward achieving these objectives were completed prior to Board consideration of subprogram 2. \n \nSME strategy implementation. The SME strategy for 2007\u20132012 was formulated under \n51. \nsubprogram  1  and  approved  by  the  PMO  in  early  2008.  Under  subprogram  2,  eight  defined \nactivities of the strategy have been completed. Overall, 18.6% of planned activities have been \n\n \n\n\f22 \n  \n\n \n\n \n\nUpgrading  and  modernization  of  Credit \n\naccomplished or are ongoing, and 11.4% are planned to commence in 2009.18 The monitoring \nunit  established  at  SMEPDO  to  monitor  implementation  published  its  first  quarterly  report  in \n2009.  The  report  produced  performance  indicators  for  many  of  the  activities  for  the  first  time, \nand made recommendations based on these indicators for steps to accelerate implementation \nof delayed activities.  \n \n52. \nPublic\u2013private dialogue. To provide an effective channel for feedback from the private \nsector  on  issues  facing  firms  at  the  provincial  level,  the  Government  (with  support  from  GTZ) \nhas initiated P3Ds in a number of pilot provinces (footnote 8). These are intended to provide a \nregular  forum  to  bring  issues  facing  firms  to  the  attention  of  relevant  local  authorities  for \nresolution  at  the  local  level.  Issues  that  cannot  be  appropriately  addressed  may  be  forwarded \nfor  the  attention  of  relevant  authorities  in  the  central  Government.  Feedback  obtained  through \nthe P3Ds can also provide valuable inputs for future policy direction and reforms. In recognition \nof their value, the Government is institutionalizing the P3Ds process in the four pilot provinces \nand  plans  to  replicate  it  in  other  provinces  going  forward.  Once  they  are  institutionalized \neffectively, it is anticipated that P3Ds will serve as a natural forum for the conduct of stakeholder \nconsultations  under  key  initiatives  supported  by  the  Program,  such  as  pilot  testing  regulatory \nimpact assessments. \n \n53. \nInformation  Bureau  and  system. \nRecognizing the importance of establishing a system that provides banks with access to timely \nand  accurate  customer  credit  and  collateral  information,  the  central  bank  is  modernizing  the \nsystem  used  by  the  CIB.  This  system  had  increasingly  become  a  bottleneck  on  the  credit \nassessment  and  approval  process,  in  the  face  of  rapid  growth  in  the  number  of  banks  and \ndemand  for  lending  from  the  private  sector.  The  CIB  is  moving  from  a  paper-based,  manual \nsystem based on relayed fax requests and replies to a system that makes use of a centralized \ndatabase and web-based technology that will allow banks to access as well as update customer \ncredit  and  collateral  information  in  real  time  (compared  to  current  response  times  of  up  to \n1 week).  With  assistance  from  ADB  and  the  EC,  a  prototype  system  has  been  developed  in \nclose  collaboration  with  CIB  staff  and  has  been  pilot  tested  with  involvement  from  all \n20 commercial banks. Capacity building is also being provided to both the CIB and commercial \nbanks  in  implementation  of  the  new  system,  while  the  system  is  being  refined  to  reflect \nfeedback  from  the  pilot-testing  phase.  Following  this,  it  will  be  populated  with  data  from  the \ncommercial banks and rolled out on an operational basis by the end of 2009.  \n \n54. \nSME accounting practices. The Government and development partners recognize that \npoor accounting and financial reporting capacity of  SMEs limits their access to finance. Under \nsubprogram 1, the Government enacted a new accounting and auditing law. Under subprogram \n2, MOF produced training materials on basic accounting and bookkeeping practices under the \nnew law and disseminated these at training courses to enterprises with technical assistance and \nsupport provided under the EC SME project.  \n \n\nb. \n\nStrengthen the Investment Climate \n\n \nSubprogram  2  supports  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  implement  the  enterprise  law  and \n55. \nsynchronize  the  investment  lists  with  the  negative  list  under  the  enterprise  law.  The  main \nobjective  is  to  expand  the  number  of  private  enterprises  (and  therefore  investment).  Reform \nareas  of  critical  significance  targeted  under  subprogram  2  include  (i)  implementing  the  new \nenterprise  law,  such  as  the  negative  list,  simplifying  registration  procedures,  and  establishing \n\n                                                 \n18 SMEPDO. 2009. Monitoring Report, 1st Quarter 2009. Vientiane: SMEPDO Monitoring Unit. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n23\n\nImplementation  of  enterprise \n\nlaw.  Several  measures  were  accomplished \n\nenterprise  registry  offices;  and  (ii)  other  policy  reforms  aimed  at  reducing  transaction  costs  in \ndoing  business.  The  following  measures  toward  achieving  these  objectives  were  completed \nprior to Board consideration of subprogram 2. \n \nin \n56. \nimplementing the enterprise law, and in particular to achieve the 10-day registration deadline for \ninvestments  not  on  the  negative  list  (the  list  was  approved  under  subprogram  1).  First,  after \ncompleting  necessary  preparations  for  the  enterprise  registry,  the  Government  made  the  new \nregistration system effective in August 2008 and started the reregistration of all firms under the \nnew registry system and in accordance with the negative list. Its purpose is to bring enterprises \nunder  the  new  law  and  clean  the  enterprise  registry  database  of  firms  that  are  no  longer  in \nbusiness.  By  the  end  of  May  2009,  about  41,000 firms  had  registered,  of  which  over  7,000 \nrepresented  new  registrants  (firms  that  had  registered  for  the  first  time).  Second,  the \nGovernment (MOIC) simplified enterprise registration procedures aimed at reducing compliance \ncosts to businesses by: (i) reducing the number of documents required for registration from 18 \nto  2\u20136,  depending  on  the  type  of  applicant\u2014documentary  requirements  not  pertinent  to  the \nregistration  function  and  the  enterprise  law  have  been  eliminated  (e.g.,  the  requirement  for \ncurriculum  vitae,  declaration  of  sentencing,  and  asset  declaration);  (ii)  delegating  approval \nauthority  from  the  MOIC  to  the  registrar  of  the  Enterprise  Registry  Office  (ERO)  under \nministerial  instruction  No  225;  (iii)    issued  ministerial  instruction  No.  0995  on  enterprise \nregistration,  which  standardizes  enterprise  registration  procedures  for  all  provincial  offices \n(called a single window); and (iv) improved transparency in the registration process by posting \non  MOIC\u2019s  website  all  registration  documents,  and  other  legal  documents,  instructions,  and \nnotices; as well as posting the steps for registration in the public area of registry offices.  \n \n57. \nEnterprise  Registry  Office.  A  modernized  ERO  with  a  centralized  database  with \ninternet-based  access  is  crucial  to  allow  for  efficient  and  effective  implementation  of  the  new \nenterprise  law  and  enterprise  registration  system.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  central  ERO  was \nestablished.  Subprogram  2  focused  on  modernizing  the  ERO  at  the  central  level  (MOIC \nVientiane)  and  completed  the  upgrading  of  7  provincial  pilot  EROs,19 which  (i) established  a \ncentralized  web-based  database  linked  to  the  provincial  pilot  EROs,  and  provides  timely \nupdates  on  registrations  nationally;  (ii) MOIC  produced  and \nimplemented  a  capacity \ndevelopment  program  with  provincial  EROs,  including  upgrading  software  and  hardware,  and \ntraining on implementing the new registration procedures; and (iii) ERO printed new, simplified \nregistration  certificates.  It  will  be  important  to  complete  the  national  rollout  of  the  enterprise \nregistry system and offices although the remote offices will not be internet-based. \n \n58. \nNew  investment  law. MPI, in consultation with MOIC and stakeholders, drafted a new \nlaw  on  investment  promotion  and  submitted  it  to  the  National  Assembly  in  June  2009.  The \nNational  Assembly  approved  the  draft  law  in  July  2009  pending  refinements  to  it  (primarily \nrefinements to the language). This new law is a major achievement under subprogram 2. The \nnew  law  merges  the  separate  foreign  and  domestic  investment  laws,  provides  for  national \ntreatment  between  domestic  and  foreign  investors,  and  streamlines  the  investment  approval \nprocess.  \n  \n59. \nRegulatory  review  program.  Reforming red tape will be a long-term effort, as in most \ncountries.  Subprogram  2  supports  the  Government\u2019s  effort  to  streamline  red  tape  by  assisting \nwith  the  establishment  of  a  regulatory  review  process  in  the  medium  term.  SMEPDO  and  the \n\n                                                 \n19  These  ERO  provinces  include:  Bolikhamxai,  Champasak,  Khammouan,  Louang  Phrabang,  Savannakhet,  \n\nVientiane, Xiangkhouang. \n\n \n\n\f24 \n  \n\n \n\n \n\nLao National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, with ADB technical assistance (footnote 15) \nundertook a review of the business costs incurred by enterprises in complying with licenses and \npermits. The review consisted of a survey of 156 enterprises in Vientiane, Luang Prabang, and \nSavannakhet.  The  findings  and  recommendations  of  the  review  were  presented  to  senior \ngovernment  officials  in  May  2009  and  again  in  July  2009,  as  a  first  step  toward  raising \nawareness  of  the  need  for  a  systematic  regulatory  review  program.  As  a  consequence  of  this \ndialogue, MOIC established an interministerial taskforce, chaired by the vice-minister of industry \nand  commerce  and  comprising  of  representatives  from  the  relevant  line  agencies  to  build  a \ndegree of consensus on an action plan for implementing a regulatory impact assessment across \nnational  agencies.  SMEPDO  completed  the  upgrade  of  its  website  and  started  posting  major \nlaws,  business  licenses,  and  explanatory  information  on  steps  and  processes  to  adhere  to \ngovernment  regulations  on  registration  and \nimproving  regulatory \ntransparency. \n \n\nlicensing  as  part  of \n\nc. \n\nImprove Trade Policy and Capacity Development \n\n60. \nSubprogram  2  supports  the  Government\u2019s  goals  of  continuing  trade  policy  reforms  to \nlower the costs of doing business for the private sector and facilitate integration of the economy \nwithin  the  GMS,  AFTA,  and  the  global  economy\u2014including  participation  in  the  WTO.  The \nfollowing actions toward achieving these objectives were completed before Board consideration \nof subprogram 2. \n \n61. \nReforms  to  the  import\u2013export  management  system.  MOIC  has  taken  a  sequential \napproach  to  reforming  the  import\u2013export  management  system,  based  on  the  experience  of \nneighboring countries such as Viet Nam. The approach is to improve transparency, reduce the \ndiscretion  of  trade  officials,  lower  administrative  costs,  and  later  reduce  the  number  of  items \nrestricted  and  replace  some  of  them  with  more  transparent  forms  of  protection.  Measures \nundertaken toward this goal include the following. First, the PMO approved the revised decree \non  import  licensing  procedures  consistent  with  WTO  rules.  The  decree  distinguishes  between \nautomatic  and  non-automatic  licenses  consistent  with  WTO  rules.  Second,  based  on  the  new \nPMO decree on import licensing procedures, MOIC prepared the draft notification of the import \nprohibited  and  controlled  lists,  which  has  fewer  items  than  the  2006  notification.  Prohibited \nimports are confined to guns and ammunition (except explosives used for industrial purposes) \nand  illegal  drugs.  Items  subject  to  non-automatic  licenses  (i.e.,  that  need  approval  from  the \nsector agency) on the controlled list are primarily for public health and safety, the environment, \nand  national  security  rather  than  protecting  industry.  These  industries  include  fertilizers, \npesticides, and other chemicals; animal medicines; explosives; and guns for industry use. The \nnew  list  also  includes  information  on  the  sector  regulation  requiring  an  import  license  for  that \nitem  and  its  rationale.  Three  sectors  (cement,  steel,  and  rice)  have  had  import  restrictions  for \nsome  time,  but  are  included  on  the  2009  draft  list  for  the  first  time,  as  part  of  Government's \nefforts  to  improve  transparency  in  the  trade  regime.  Third,  MOIC  prepared  a  decree  on  the \napplication of rules of origin and submitted it to the PMO for approval. \n \n62. \nTechnical  barriers  to  trade.  MOIC,  in  collaboration  with  relevant  line  ministries, \ncommenced review and reform processes for TBT notification to the WTO. The focus has been \non strengthening the legal framework for sanitary and phytosanitary standards and other TBTs, \nconsistent  with  WTO  rules.  These  accomplishments  include  the  following:  (i)  updated  action \nplans on sanitary and phytosanitary standards for the 5th working party at the WTO, that took \nplace in July 2009; (ii) MOIC and relevant ministries issued a series of decrees related to food \nsafety  management;  principles  for  application  of  SPS;  and  technical  measures  for  food  safety \nmanagement, plant protection, and quarantine law; and (iii) the Department of Health converted \nthe  ad  valorem  fee  for  issuing  import  permits  for  food  products  to  a  specific  rate,  which  is  a \n\n \n\n\f \n\n25\n\nsignificant  accomplishment  toward  cutting  the costs  of  red  tape  and  reducing  the  discretion of \ntrade officials issuing permits. \n \n63. \nCapacity development at MOIC. Building capacity and staff training at MOIC is a core \nobjective of the PSME program. Under subprogram 2, with ADB technical assistance (footnote \n16) trade policy tools were developed for computing effective rates of protection (ERPs). MOIC \nestimated ERPs afforded to domestic industry\u2014the first time ERPs had been estimated for the \nLao  PDR.  Estimated  ERPs  are  a  useful  transparency  tool,  as  they  highlight  areas  where  high \nprotection  may  exist  and  its  causes.  The  results  of  MOIC-ADB  work  show  that  ERPs  are \nrelatively low across most sectors, although pockets of high protection still exist. They also show \nthat some key potential export sectors have negative protection, meaning that protection given \nelsewhere in the economy has lowered its competitiveness.  \n \n\nd. \n\nImpact and Outcomes and of the PSME Program \n\n64. \nThe  reforms  to  the  enterprise  registration  system  will  potentially  have  a  substantial \nimpact on business compliance costs. The ADB-SMEPDO red tape review estimates that these \nchanges  will  reduce  the  business  compliance  cost  of  registering  enterprises  by  over  35% \nthrough  savings  in  staff  time  and  costs  in  preparing  documentation  and  applying  for  the \ncertificate,  and  follow-up.  Even  more  substantial,  businesses  are  not  required  to  renew \nregistration  each  year.  Based  on  the  review,  this  will  save  businesses  at  least  $6  million \nannually  (in  2008  prices).  The  immediate  benefits  are  evident,  with  over  5,000  enterprises \nregistering for the first time\u2014as of May 2009, 41,000 enterprises have registered under the new \nlaw. The new investment law will enhance predictability in the investment framework and attract \nadditional  foreign  investment.  The  reforms  to  the  import\u2013export  management  system  have \nopened  up  new  trade  opportunities,  will  increase  integration  with  neighboring  economies,  and \nwill  lower  domestic  prices.  Consequently,  the  Program  will  have  indirectly  contributed  to  an \nincrease in imports and exports of non-resource goods since 2006.   \n \n\n2. \n\nPost-Program Monitoring Framework \n\n65. \nThe  development  policy  letter  sets  out  the  Government\u2019s  reform  agenda  for  the  next  \n1\u20132  years,  building  on  the  reform  momentum  of  subprograms  1  and  2.  The  Government  and \nADB  have  agreed  to  a  post-PSME  program  monitoring  framework  for  12  months,  focusing  on \n12 policy  measures  and  capacity  development  efforts  of  the  Government\u2019s  short-term  plan \nadvancing  its  reforms  in  SME  policy  development,  investment  climate,  and  trade  policy  and \nfacilitation  (Table  4  and  Appendix  3).

The grant size was increased from $5 million, as \ninitially planned when the program cluster was approved by the Board in October 2007, to $15 \nmillion. At the time of designing the program cluster in 2007, it was felt that the $5 million grant \nfor  subprogram  2  was  relatively  small  when  measured  against  the  expected  prior  actions  of \nsubprogram 2. However, at that time limited Asian Development Fund funds to the Lao PDR did \nnot  permit  more  realistic  funding  of  the  Program.  The  increase  grant  from  $5  million  to  $15 \nmillion  is  also  justified  on  the  basis  that  policy  accomplishments  under  subprogram  2  have \nsurpassed program expectations, its positive development impact on private sector growth and \nits  links  to  job  creation  and  sustainable  poverty  reduction  (Appendixes  7  and  9).  Direct \nadjustment  costs  include  (i) foregone  budget  revenues  from  reform  of  the  import\u2013export \nmanagement  mechanism;  and  (ii) the  costs  of  carrying  out  improvements  to  the  business \nregistration  system  and  establishment  of  business  registry  information  systems  and  offices  in \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n27\n\nthe  provinces,  as  well  as  establishing  systems  for  posting  regulations,  licenses,  and  permits \nrequired to start and operate a business on the SMEPDO website. Therefore the total program \ncluster financing has increased from $10 million to $20 million. \n \nThe  program  grant  also  reflects  the  development  financing  needs  of  the  Government. \n68. \nThe  collapse  in  copper  and  other  commodity  prices  has  resulted  in  a  reduction  in  program \nbudget revenues by up to 1% of GDP. As a result, the budget shortfall is $50 million\u2013$60 million \nfor  FY2009.  To  address  the  shortfall,  the  Government  will  raise  excise  taxes  on  alcohol  and \npetroleum  and  the  Government  has  requested  additional  grant  support  from  development \npartners.  The  proposed  grant  amount  of  $15  million  for  subprogram  2  will  help  close  the \nfinancing gap for FY2009 (Table 5).  \n \n\nTable 5:  Projected Financing Sources for 2009 \n($ million) \nProgrammed external borrowings and grants in 2009 \n\nProposed Amounts in 2009  \n \n\n88.7  \n \n  5.0  \n15.0  \n \n\n              73.5 a \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, BSRP = Banking Sector Reform Program, PSME = Private Sector and \nSME Development Program. \n\n              Note: An exchange rate of KN8,500 = $1 was used for calculations. \n\nADB\u2019s planned disbursementsa \n\n        of which: \n\nBSRP third tranche \nPSME subprogram 2 \n \n\nOther donor \n\n \n\n \nD. \n\na  Planned disbursements for 2009.  \nSource: Ministry of Finance and ADB.  \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\n \n69. \nThe  implementation  arrangements  established  under  subprogram  1  will  remain  under \nsubprogram  2.  MOIC  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA).  It  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall \nincluding  carrying  out  all  policy  actions,  program \nimplementation  of  subprogram  2, \nadministration, and maintenance of all program records. The PSME steering committee, chaired \nby the minister of industry and commerce and comprising senior officials from BOL, MOF, and \nMPI,  is  responsible  for  coordinating  the  implementation  and  sustaining  of  the  PSME  policy \nactions with MOIC and relevant line agencies involved in supporting the PSME Program (BOL, \nMOF  and  MPI)  and  the  post-program  monitoring  framework.  The  committee  will  meet  twice  a \nyear  to  monitor  progress  and  oversee  implementation  of  the  PSME  Program  and  the  post-\nprogram monitoring framework. ADB will participate in the meetings. English translations of the \nminutes of these meetings will be forwarded to ADB within 2 weeks of each meeting. MOIC will \nbe  responsible \nimplementation  activities,  and  will  report  on \nimplementation progress. The BOL and MPI will be acting as implementing agencies.

All \n\n \n70. \nactions included in the policy matrix for subprogram 2 were implemented by mid-August 2009.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement Arrangements  \n\n \n71. \nThe program grant of $15 million will be released in a single tranche upon effectiveness.  \nThe  grant  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs  (excluding  local \nduties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries  and  incurred  no \nmore than 180 days before the effectiveness date of the grant, excluding the items specified in \nthe  negative  list  of  ineligible  items  (Appendix  8)  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral sources. In accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement \nProcedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans,20 the proceeds of the program grant \nwill be disbursed to the Lao PDR as the recipient. No supporting import documentation will be \nrequired, if during each year that grant proceeds are expected to be disbursed the value of Lao \nPDR  total  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports \nfinanced under other official development assistance is equal to or greater than the amount of \nthe grant expected to be disbursed during such year. The Government will certify its compliance \nwith  this  formula  prior  to  the  withdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under \nexisting  procedures  will  be  required.  Disbursements  will  be  made  under  the  simplified \nprocedures for program loans. In accordance with the simplified disbursement procedures and \nrelated  requirements  for  program  grants,  all  goods  and  services  produced  and  originating  in \nADB member countries will be procured, with due consideration to economy and efficiency, in \naccordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  standard  public  procedures  and  normal  private  sector \ncommercial  practices  acceptable  to  ADB.  Goods  commonly  traded  on  the  international \ncommodity market will be procured in accordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and \nacceptable to ADB. \n \n72. \ncounterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the PSME grant.   \n \n\nThe  reform  needs  supported  under  the  PSME  will  be  met  through  local  currency \n\n4. \n\nAnticorruption and Fiduciary Assessment \n\n \n73. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Program.  To  support  these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Program.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Program  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and \nother service providers as they relate to the Program. \n \nAn assessment of the country\u2019s financial management systems has been carried out to \n74. \nunderstand  fiduciary  risks  better  and  determine  appropriate  fiduciary  arrangements  for  the \npurpose  of  this  Program.  This  assessment  was  based  on  the  Lao  PDR  Public  Expenditure \nReview  and  Integrated  Fiduciary  Assessment  Report  (PER)  led  by  the  World  Bank  and \n\n                                                 \n20  ADB. 1998.

Based  on  this \nassessment,  the  PER  determined  that  the  fiduciary  risk  in  the  use  and  management  of  public \nfunds is high. The Government is aware of the need to increase the amount of public resources \nallocated  to  planning  and  management  to  overcome  significant  weaknesses  in  the  basic \nsystems and processes for budget preparation, execution and control, reporting, and oversight. \nThe  PER  acknowledges  that  since  2002,  the  Government  has  taken  significant  actions  to \naddress these weaknesses through its Public Expenditure Management Strengthening Program \n(PEMSP),  and  implement  the  last  PER  recommendations  including  strengthening  the  public \naccounting  framework  by  issuing  implementation  regulations  and  by  implementing  a  unified \nbudget  nomenclature  and  chart  of  accounts  throughout  the  Government;  progressively \nimplementing  a  computerized  government  financial  information  system  that  has  introduced  an \nautomated system for accounting, budget execution control, and reporting that will improve the \ncapture  and  timely  reporting  of  data  and  increase  budget  control;  and  issuing  a  new \nprocurement  decree  and  supporting  implementation  regulations  and  creating  a  Procurement \nMonitoring  Office.  ADB,  the  World  Bank,  and  other  development  partners  are  working  closely \nwith the Government to implement improved public sector financial management systems.

Before  withdrawal,  the  Government \nwill  open  a  deposit  account  at  the  Bank  of  the  Lao  PDR  to  receive  all  grant  proceeds.  The \naccount will be managed, operated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB. \nMOIC  will  be  required  to  submit  quarterly  progress  reports  as  well  as  a  final  report  on  the \nprogress of subprogram 2 implementation.  \n \n\n6. \n\nPerformance Monitoring, Evaluation and Program Review \n\n \nIn cooperation with the PSME committee (para. 69), ADB will carry out periodic reviews \n76. \nof  program  implementation,  and  assess  the  impact  of  the  PSME  and  the  post-program \nmonitoring  framework.  The  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  the  outcome  of  policy \ndiscussions  with  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies  that  have  implications  for  PSME \nimplementation,  and  provide  ADB  with  the  opportunity  to  comment  on  any  resulting  policy \nproposals.  ADB,  in  collaboration  with  the  committee,  will  undertake  a  review  of  program \nperformance  8 months  after  grant  effectiveness  to  review  the  outcome  of  subprogram  2.  In \naddition  to  the  review  report,  the  committee  will  submit  to  ADB  within  8  months  of  grant \neffectiveness of subprogram 2, a review report that assesses compliance with, and the impact \nof,  agreed  actions  under  subprogram  2.  In  addition,  participants  in  the  Lao  Business  Forum \n(partner  agencies,  business  groups,  and  other  stakeholders)  will  be  encouraged  to  support \nprivate sector monitoring of the reforms under the PSME. \n \n\n                                                 \n21 World  Bank,  IMF,  ADB,  and  European  Commission.  2007.

Lao PDR - Public Expenditure Planning for the National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy, TA 4627. \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n\fThe Government and ADB have agreed on a range of outcome and output indicators to \n77. \nmonitor the PSME implementation and evaluate its impact, within the overall PSME framework \n(Appendix 1).  \n \n\nV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nExpected Impacts \n\nThe key benefits expected from the PSME program cluster are as follows: \n\nImproved  investor  confidence  through  completion  of  implementation  of  the  new \nenterprise  law  and  a  new  investment  law  that  provides  for  national  treatment \nbetween foreign and domestic investors. \nLower  transaction  costs  for  business  because  of  streamlined  business  start-up \nprocedures,  a  reduction  in  red  tape,  and  reform  of  remaining  non-tariff  barriers \nwhich  will  open  new  opportunities,  increase  investment  and  productivity,  boost \nthe economy, and increase incomes and create jobs.  \nStrengthened institutional development through raising capabilities in the EA and \nIAs  to  carry  out  trade,  investment,  and  SME  policy  analysis  with  the  aim  of \nimproving the quality of policy, institutional processes for policy making. Posting \nregulations  on  the  SMEPDO  website  will  also  contribute  to  institutional \ndevelopment through better regulatory transparency. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe PSME program cluster is subject to the following risks:  \n\nIn transitional economies, maintaining macroeconomic stability\u2013\u2013reflected in low \ninflation  and  a  stable  exchange  rate\u2013\u2013is  critical  for  investor  confidence  and \nprivate sector growth. The Lao PDR is particularly vulnerable to macroeconomic \ninstability  because  of  weak  institutions.  It  also  faces  emerging  fiscal  stress  and \nmacroeconomic  challenges  in  the  context  of  the  fall  in  resource  revenues  that \nthreaten to undermine recent gains in social spending and poverty reduction. The \nGovernment  recognizes  these  risks  and,  with  development  partner  assistance \nincluding ADB, is undertaking measures to raise revenue and strengthen public \nexpenditure management.  \nThe capacity of agencies to implement reforms may be constrained by resources \nand  other  emerging  priorities.  The  PSME  program  cluster  reduces  this  risk  by \nlimiting  the  policy  triggers  to  a  small  number  of  high-priority,  high-impact  policy \nreforms  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  EA  and  a  limited  number  of  IAs  (MPI  and \nMOF), and by attaching TA to each policy trigger.  \nThere  will  be  resistance  to  some  reforms  from  vested  interests.  Reforms  to  the \nimport\u2013export  management  system  and  institutionalizing  economic  governance \nreforms\u2013\u2013i.e.,  red  tape  review  process\u2013\u2013are  likely  to  be  a  lengthy  process. \nResistance  may  also  come  from  entrenched  cultural  and  political  economy \nfactors that may slow market economy reforms and market competition, including \nthe  dominance  of \n(cement,  steel, \npharmaceuticals, food processing and beverages, and utilities). However, several \nfactors  mitigate  these  risks:  (a)  the  PSME  strategic  approach  is  to  focus  efforts \non  supporting  the  Government\u2019s  initiatives,  and  (b)  reforms  have  focused  on \nareas where there is political will and some measure of capacity. This has been \nlaw  and \ndemonstrated  by  successful \n\nimplementation  of \n\nin  some  sectors \n\nthe  state  sector \n\nthe  enterprise \n\n30 \n  \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nA. \n \n78. \n \n\n \nB. \n \n79. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n31\n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nestablishment of the enterprise registry, which has resulted in substantial cuts in \nbusiness compliance costs and 7,000 enterprises registering for the first time in \n2008 and 2009.  \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n80. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents.  \n \n\nThe Counterpart Funds will be used to finance the local currency costs relating to \nthe  implementation  of  subprogram  2  and  other  activities  consistent  with  the \nobjectives  of  subprogram  2  and  shall  provide \nthe  necessary  budget \nappropriations  to  finance  the  structural  adjustment  costs  relating  to  the \nimplementation of reforms under subprogram 2. \nThe policies and actions taken prior to the date of the PSME grant agreement, as \ndescribed  in  the  development  policy  letter  (including  the  policy  matrix),  will \ncontinue  to  be  in  effect  for  the  duration  of  the  PSME  program  cluster  and \nsubsequently. \n\n \n\nVII.

It also \n\n \n1. \npresents a summary assessment of debt sustainability.  \n \nA.  \n \nThis  section  assesses  macroeconomic  performance  to  date  and  summarizes  the \n2. \ndiscussion of the key medium-term macroeconomic policy issues. While much has been done to \nput fiscal policy on a sound path, the collapse in commodity prices heightens four critical issues \nfor the Government in ensuring fiscal sustainability over the medium term: (i) increasing efforts \nto  mobilize  domestic  revenues,  (ii)  better  management  of  natural  resource  revenues, \n(iii) improving  efficiency \nimproving  debt \nsustainability. We conclude that, with the collapse in commodity prices, sustainable adjustment \nwill require more efforts to raise domestic revenues resources over the medium term.  \n \n\nin  public  expenditure  management,  and  (iv) \n\n1.  \n\nFiscal Policy \n\n \n3. \nFiscal  crisis:  1998\u20132001.  After  improving  in  the  first  half  of  the  1990s,  the \nmacroeconomic fortunes of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) quickly reversed \nfollowing the Asian crisis. In the mid-1990s, budget revenues were improving and inflation was \non  a  downward  trend.  Then  came  the  fall  in  demand  for  Lao  PDR  products  arising  from  the \nAsian financial crisis and, exacerbated by expansion in domestic money supply to finance public \ninvestments in irrigation, led to a severe economic crisis. The kip exchange rate against the US \ndollar depreciated, leading to hyperinflation during 1998 and 1999, tax revenues plunged, and \nthe  national  government  deficit  increased  sharply  and  public  debt  began  to  climb.  The  overall \nbudget deficit reached 5.6% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2003. \n \n4. \nA major factor contributing to deterioration of the fiscal balance was that revenues were \nundermined because (i) tax collection was deconcentrated with decentralization, and provincial \ngovernments  had  little  incentive  to  collect  and  pass  on  additional  taxes  to  the  central \nGovernment;  (ii)  several  sectors  were  outside  the  tax  base;  and  (iii)  tax  administration \nweaknesses persisted and were not addressed. \n \n5. \nEmerging  from  crisis.  In  2001,  the  Lao  PDR  emerged  from  the  economic  and  fiscal \ncrisis.  The  Government  has  restored  macroeconomic  stability  and  has  maintained  it  through \nfiscal  discipline  and  better  management  of  monetary  policy.  This  has  been  at  the  expense  of \nsuppressed expenditure in the social sectors (education and health) and a substantial decline in \npublic sector real wages. In the FY 2008 budget revenues exceeded the budget plan\u2014primarily \nas  a  result  of  increased  collections  from  the  booming  mining  sector,  with  resource  revenues \namounting to 3.2% of GDP, up from 2.6% in 2007 and 1.9% in 2006. Overall, budget revenue \ncollections  rose  by  1.9  percentage  points  of  GDP  in  2008  over  2006  levels.  As  a  result,  the \noverall  budget  deficit  as  a  share  of  GDP  fell  from  4.5%  in  2005  to  2.9%  in  2007  and  2.0%  in \n2008, surpassing fiscal targets (Table A5.1). \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n45\n\nTable A5.1: Fiscal Policy Indicators, 2001\u20132008 \n(%, unless otherwise stated) \n\n \n\nItem \nRevenues and grants \nRevenues \n  Tax \n     Resources   \n     Non-resource \n  Non-tax \nGrants \n \nExpenditures \nCurrent  \nCapital expenditure \nOther \nOverall balance \nForeign Financing (net) \n\n2003 \n13.0 \n10.9 \n8.9 \n1.3 \n7.6 \n1.9 \n2.1 \n \n18.6 \n7.1 \n11.0 \n0.5 \n(5.7) \n5.1 \n\n2004 \n12.1 \n11.0 \n9.1 \n1.1 \n8.0 \n1.9 \n1.1 \n \n15.5 \n7.4 \n7.3 \n0.8 \n(3.4) \n3.6 \n\n \n2005 \n12.7 \n11.4 \n9.4 \n1.3 \n8.1 \n2.0 \n1.2 \n \n16.0 \n8.0 \n6.0 \n2.0 \n(3.3) \n3.0 \n\n2006  \n14.6 \n12.7 \n10.8 \n1.7 \n9.2 \n1.9 \n1.9 \n \n17.7 \n9.0 \n7.3 \n1.0 \n(3.1) \n4.6 \n\n \n2007 \n15.8 \n14.0 \n12.1 \n2.2 \n10.0 \n1.9 \n1.7 \n \n18.6 \n8.9 \n8.1 \n1.6 \n(2.8) \n2.9 \n\n2008a  \n15.6 \n14.3 \n12.5 \n2.7 \n9.8 \n1.8 \n1.3 \n \n17.7 \n10.3 \n7.0 \n0.4 \n(2.1) \n2.0 \n\n( ) = negative, Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \na Estimated. \nSource: Ministry of Finance, Lao PDR; International Monetary Fund. 2008.

Booming \ncommodity  prices  from  2006  to  2008  raised  central  government  budget  revenues  by \n1.9 percentage  points  over  2005  levels  and  expectations  were  that  the  elevated  commodity \nprices  would  continue  for  some  years  to  come.  This  perception  influenced  the  Government\u2019s \nmanagement of resource revenues and spending priorities. The 2009 budget formulated in early \n2008 assumed commodity prices would remain at elevated levels and resource revenues would \ncontribute to 30% of the increase in budget revenues in 2009. Overall, budget revenues were \nprojected  to  rise  by  14%  over  the  2008  budget  outturn.  Paralleling  revenues,  planned  current \nexpenditures  were  projected  to  rise  by  24%  and  a  projected  overall  budget  deficit  of  3.4%  of \nGDP, which was considered manageable given that the Government had consistently exceeded \nrevenues  projections  in  the  previous  two  budgets.  However,  the  underlying  weakness  of  the \noverall  budget  can  be  ascertained  by  stripping  away  resource  revenues  from  the  central \ngovernment budget. The non-resource budget balance is much higher, at 5.3% of GDP in 2008, \nsuggesting  the  budget  is  vulnerable  to  deterioration  in  Lao  PDR  terms  of  trade  (Figure  A5.1). \nThe  collapse  in  copper  prices  and  other  key  minerals,  except  for  gold,  has  feedback  into  a \nprojected decline in resource revenues by 21% below the 2009 budget plan and as a share of \nGDP. As a result, the overall budget deficit is expected to rise to 4%\u20135% of GDP in 2009 and \ncreate  a  budget  financing  shortfall  of  $50  million\u2013$60  million  in  FY2009.  The  Government  is \naddressing  this  through  increased  excise  taxes  on  alcohol  and  retail  gasoline  sales,  and \nincreased  grants  from  development  partners.  The  stress  in  the  fiscal  situation  may  persist  in \n2010 as corporate profit tax from the resource sector declines as losses are carried over.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nP\nD\nG\n\n \nf\no\n \n\n%\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure A5.1: Resource Revenues and the National Government Budget \n \n\n (a) Overall Budget and Non-Resource Budget \n      Deficits (% of GDP)   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n(b) Impact of Commodity Prices on  \n                   Resource Revenues to the NG Budget \n\nP\nD\nG\n\n \n\n%\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n350\n\n300\n\n250\n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\nx\ne\nd\nn\n\ni\n \ne\nc\n\ni\nr\n\nP\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\nResource revenues to the budget\n\nOverall budget balance Non-resource budget balance\n\nCommodity price index\n\n    \n GDP = gross domestic product, NG = non government. \n Note: The commodity price index refers to the composite price index of metals and minerals (copper, gold, nickel,  \n silver, etc.). \n Sources: Budget data from the Ministry of Finance, Vientiane; Commodity price data from the Development  \n Economics Prospects Group, World Bank; and International Monetary Fund projection for 2009.   \n\n \n\n2.  \n\nBanking Sector \n\n \n7. \nImpact  of  global  financial  crisis.  Direct  impacts  of  the  global  financial  crisis  on  the \ndomestic  financial  system  so  far  have  remained  negligible.  The  banking  system  has  not  been \naffected  by  the  direct  effect  of  the  global  crisis  because  of  its  low  level  of  financial  sector \ndevelopment  (banking  assets  account  for  15%  of  GDP)  and  almost  nonexistent  exposure  to \ntroubled  US  assets.  There  is  no  corporate  bond  market,  government  treasury  bills  are  not \ntraded  on  the  market,  and  the  Government  does  not  access  international  credit  markets. \nHowever, the banking system is vulnerable to the potential feedback loop from the global crisis \ntransmitting  to  the  real  sector,  and  the  slowdown  in  the  real  sector  transmitting  to  increased \nnonperforming loans (NPLs) and erosion of banking sector capital. The increased vulnerability \narises for two reasons. First, the three state-owned commercial banks (which account for about \n60%  of  banking  sector  assets)  have  a  combined  capital  to  asset  ratio  of  1.77%,  indicating \nessentially  no  capital  to  buffer  a  modest  deterioration  in  asset  quality,  such  as  a  doubling  of \nNPLs from the current 4% level. Lao Development Bank (LDB) and Agriculture Promotion Bank \n(APB)  have  negative  capital  and  Banque  pour  le  Commerce  Exterieur  Lao  (BCEL)  capital \nturned  positive  in  2007  although  it  is  still  below  the  Bank  of  the  Lao  PDR  (BOL)  required  8% \ncapital\u2013asset ratio (CAR). Private banks reportedly have a CAR of 16%. Second, bank lending \nhad accelerated to unprecedented levels in 2008, rising by more than 50% in BCEL and LDB. \nThe  loan  to  deposit  ratios  are  relatively  low  (around  50%)  and  gross  NPLs  are  low  at  4%  (on \nBOL\u2019s definition).

However, the global financial crisis has put increased pressure on the \nbalance  of  payments.  Exports  year-on-year  started  to  decline  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2008 \nbecause of falling commodity prices and the slowdown in demand for garments from developed \ncountries. Imports also started to decline in the first quarter of 2009. It is projected that exports \n(mainly  commodities)  will  decline  by  about  21%  and  imports  by  14%  in  2009.  As  a  result,  the \ncurrent  account  is  expected  to  remain  in  deficit  in  the  range  of  14%  of  GDP.  On  the  capital \naccount  side,  foreign  direct  investment  flows  are  expected  to  slow,  although  partially \ncompensated by increased inflows of official assistance.  \n\n3.  \n\nMedium-Term Macroeconomic Issues \n\n \n9. \nConsiderable  fiscal  gains  have  been  achieved  since  2001,  and  fiscal  space  has  been \nprovided  by  taxes  from  commodities,  but  the  global  financial  crisis  and  collapse  in  commodity \nprices highlight the importance of locking in these gains and building on them.   \n \n10. \nIssue  1:  Fiscal  consolidation.  Over the medium term, sustainable fiscal consolidation \nwill  require  further  non-resource  revenue  effort.  The  Lao  PDR  has  one  of  the  lowest  non-\nresource tax revenue to GDP ratios (about 10%) among low-income countries, partly because \nof  the  dominance  of  the  subsistence  agriculture  sector.  Substantial  gains  in  non-resource  tax \ncollection were made in 2006 and 2007, with revenues rising by two percentage points of GDP \nbecause  of  improvements  in  tax  administration.  However,  these  gains  appear  to  have  leveled \nout in 2008. Most of the recent gains in revenues come from royalties and profit taxes from the \nnatural  resource  sector.  Revenue  management  is  challenged  by  (i)  the  erosion  of  the  income \ntax base caused by the proliferation of tax incentives in growth sectors of the economy\u2013\u2013about \n1,600   and  large  firms  have  significant  fiscal  incentives  under  the  investment  laws;  and \n(ii) persistently  weak  tax  administration.  The  Government  is  addressing  these  issues  in  a \nsystematic and sustainable way, and this will be a longer term effort. Importantly, the National \nAssembly  enacted  the  budget  law  in  2006,  which  re-concentrates  tax  collection.  The  law, \nmodeled  on  Viet  Nam\u2019s  budget  law,  defines  revenues  belonging  to  the  central  Government, \nprovincial  governments,  and  those  revenues  to  be  shared  between  central  and  provincial \ngovernments. The budget law also places the Treasury and Customs Department under central \ngovernment  authority,  ensuring  that  revenues  are  passed  to  the  central  Government.  The \nGovernment  has  designed  a  value-added  tax  and  intended  to  implement  it  in  January  2009. \nThis  has  been  delayed  because  much  work  still  needs  to  be  done  to  clean  up  the  taxpayer \nregistration, expand it, and develop a refund mechanism, and undertake taxpayer education.  \n \n11. \nFiscal outlook for 2009 and 2010. An outlook for fiscal policy over the next 2 years is \npresented  in  Table  A5.2,  which  presents  a  baseline  scenario  based  on  assumptions  of  low \ncommodity prices and economic growth in the range of 4%\u20135% in 2009 with recovery in 2010. \nThe  low-case  scenario  of  a  continued  expenditure  program  with  lower  revenues  would  be  a \nfiscal deficit projected up to 7.5% of GDP while a high case scenario of additional measures to \nraise revenue and lower expenditure would be a projected deficit of 3.5% of GDP. While the low \nand high scenarios are indicative, they demonstrate the need for continuing increasing revenue \neffort and expenditure management.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n49\n\nTable A5.2: Lao PDR Medium-Term Outlook, 2009\u20132010 \n(% of GDP, unless otherwise stated) \n\nIndicator \nRevenues and grants \n Revenues \n   Tax \n      Resourcesa \n      Non-resource \n   Non-tax \nGrants \n \nExpenditures \n  Domestic expenditure \n    Wagesb \n    Interest  \n    Otherc \n  Development partner financed \nexpenditure \nOverall balance (excluding additional   \nmeasures) d \nOverall balance (including additional \nmeasures) \nForeign financing (net) \n \nMemorandum items: \nExternal public sector debt \n\n2008 \n15.6 \n14.3 \n12.5 \n2.7 \n9.8 \n1.8 \n1.3 \n \n17.7 \n12.8 \n4.6 \n0.8 \n7.4 \n4.8 \n\n(2.1) \n\n \n\n2009 \n14.9 \n12.9 \n11.4 \n2.3 \n9.1 \n1.5 \n2.1 \n \n22.8 \n18.3 \n5.8 \n0.8 \n11.2 \n4.5 \n\n(7.9) \n\n(3.5) \n\n2010 \n15.3 \n13.2 \n11.6 \n1.7 \n9.9 \n1.6 \n2.1 \n \n21.1 \n16.2 \n5.6 \n0.9 \n9.7 \n\n4.9 \n(5.8) \n\n(3.5) \n\n2.6 \n \n \n66.7 \n\n3.0 \n \n \n71.5 \n \n      44,993.0 \n\n2.4 \n \n \n69.1 \n \n    48,391.0 \n\nNominal GDP (fiscal year, KN billion) \n( ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product, Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \na  Includes taxes and royalties from timber, hydro, and mining sectors.  \nb  Includes salaries and benefits, compensation, and extra work allowances. \nc  Includes onlending, debt repayment, and contingencies. \nd   Additional measures refer to tax increases and reduced expenditures to bring the overall budget deficit to \n3.5% of GDP.

Medium-term  fiscal  sustainability  requires \nimproving  efficiency  in  the  public  expenditure  management  by  ensuring  a  balanced  public \nexpenditure program between capital spending and recurrent expenditures, as well as between \ndiscretionary  and  nondiscretionary  spending  items  (interest  payments  and  wages).1 This  will \nrequire  reorienting  spending  toward  priority  sectors  identified  in  the  Government\u2019s  poverty \nreduction strategy. In recent years, there have been large increases in public servant wages to \ncompensate for hyperinflation in 1998 and 1999. While this is understandable, the expansion in \nthe  wage  bill  and  other  nondiscretionary  items  should  be  more  prudent  going  forward. \nImplementing  improved  systems  for  public  expenditure  management\u2014including  the  medium-\nterm expenditure framework, which aligns the budget planning process with strategic objectives \nand priorities\u2014is integral to improving efficiency in public expenditure management. Progress is \nbeen  made.  The  Government  has  developed  a  public  expenditure  framework  and  is \nimplementing  improved  budget  processes.  It  has  shifted  to  a  public  financial  management \nframework  that  includes  the  revenue  side  of  the  budget.  The  2007  public  expenditure  review \n\n                                                 \n1   The share of discretionary spending in the national government budget has declined in the last 4 years from 62% \nin the FY2004 budget to 58% in the FY2006 budget and 56% in the FY2008 budget. In contrast, nondiscretionary \nspending  on  wages  and  salaries  and  transfers  has  increased  from  32%  in  the  FY2005  budget  to  39%  in  the \nFY2008 budget.  \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\ncarried  out  by  the  World  Bank,  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  ADB,  and  the  European \nCommission  noted  that  public  expenditure  in  education  and  roads  is  reasonably  efficient  and \nequitable, but less so in other sectors such as agriculture and health.2   \n \nIssue  3:  Managing  resource  revenues.  The  collapse  in  commodity  prices  and \n13. \nfeedback to the fiscal situation reminds authorities and development partners of the realities of a \nresource sector that is characterized by a volatile commodity price cycle. The resource sector \nprovides  the  Lao  PDR with  a  unique  opportunity  to  fund  its  development  goals  and  reduce its \naid dependence over the longer term. At the same time, it provides the Lao PDR with important \nchallenges  as  to  how  these  revenues  should  be  managed  since  such  resource  revenues  are \nvolatile and unpredictable. There are good lessons from other similar small countries that have \nexperienced  similar  resource  booms.  Perhaps  the  most  successful  example  is  Botswana, \nanother  small,  resource-rich  landlocked  economy.  Through  cautious  macroeconomic  policy, \npublic  investments,  and  economic  reforms,  Botswana  has  been  among  the  fastest  growing \neconomies  in  the  last  three  decades  and  has  a  per  capita  income  of  $3,600  in  2003.  It  was \nranked  among  the  25  poorest  countries  in  the  world  in  the  mid-1960s.  Key  features  of \nBotswana\u2019s  macroeconomic  policy  included  (i)  smoothing  out  spending  resource  revenues \nrather  than  spending  all  as  it  comes;  (ii)  aligning  expenditures  with  conservative,  long-term \nforecasts  of  resource  revenues;  (iii)  saving  some  portion  of  revenues  for  leaner  years  by \nestablishing  a  stabilization  fund  and  a  public  debt  service  fund  to  ensure  it  can  meet  debt \nobligations  in  case  the  resource  boom  busts;  (iv)  a  balanced  expenditure  program  between \nrecurrent  and  capital  expenditures;  and  (v)  investing  in  infrastructure,  especially  in  rural  areas \nwhere the majority of the population lives. Given the current global environment, it has become \npertinent for the Government to develop a resource revenue management strategy.  \n \n14. \nIssue  4:  Maintaining  debt  sustainability.  Public  debt  as  a  share  of  GDP  has  been \ndeclining  but  remains  high.  At  the  end  of  2007,  the  stock  of  external  public  and  publicly \nguaranteed  debt  was  estimated  at  60%  of  GDP.  Concessional  borrowing  from  ADB  and  the \nWorld  Bank  accounts  for  the  bulk  of  the  increase  in  public  debt  since  2001.  The  stock  of \ndomestic  public  debt  is  small  at  1.5%  of  GDP.  Recent  IMF\u2013World  Bank  debt  sustainability \nanalysis  continues  to  show  the  debt  stock  well  above  policy-based  indicative  thresholds, \nsuggesting  a  high  risk  of  debt  distress.3 Debt  sustainability  depends  on  sustained  economic \ngrowth, as well as improved external competitiveness and largely concessional borrowing and \ngrants. Strong control over quasi-fiscal risks arising from the state sector will also be necessary, \nincluding guarantees for resource sector projects.  \n \n15. \npolicy over the next few years with technical assistance supported by development partners:   \n\nThe  Government  has  outlined  a  strategy  to  support  a  sustainable  adjustment  in  fiscal \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nContinue  to  implement  reforms  to  enhance  the  revenue  system  by  broadening \nthe tax base through the introduction of value-added tax, replacing the turnover \ntax.  In  2005,  the  Government  passed  a  new  tax  law  that  widened  the  tax  base \nand increased receipts from large projects and tourism.  \nAddressing  problems  associated  with  fragmented  tax  administration.  The \nGovernment  has  made  progress  in  returning  tax  collection  functions  (Treasury \nand Customs) under the jurisdiction of the central Government and clarifying the \ntax revenue sharing between the central and provincial governments.

From  2003  to  2008,  economic  growth  has  averaged  around \n7.1%,  and  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  per  capita  increased  by  over  40%  to  $669  in  2007. \nBased on the national poverty line, poverty incidence declined to an estimated 28% during the \nsame period, and poverty reduction accelerated after 2004 when per capita income surpassed \n$400  in  2004.  The  economic  growth  has  been  supported  mainly  by  the  industrial  sector,  with \ninvestments in hydropower and the mining sector driving industrial expansion in recent years\u2014\nmaking  the  Lao  PDR  vulnerable  to  volatile  and  unpredictable  commodity  price  cycles \n(Figure A6.1).  The  manufacturing  sector  has  enjoyed  robust  growth  rates,  although  the \ngarments sector\u2014the major manufacturing export sector\u2014has experienced a decline in exports \nin  recent  years.  The  service  sector  has  also  enjoyed  growth.  Within  services,  tourism  and \nrelated  services  have  enjoyed  rapid  expansion  in  recent  years\u2014international  visitors  to  the \nLao PDR  continue  to  increase,  with  over  1.6  million  people  traveling  in  2007,  generating  over \n$200  million  in  revenues.  Most  of  the  recorded  tourist  arrivals  are  for  short-term  stays  (1\u20133 \ndays)  from  neighboring  economies.  More  recently,  there  has  been  an  increased  number  of \nforeign investments in the agriculture sector, especially large-scale commercial plantations.  \n \n3. \nThe Lao PDR economy has undergone significant structural transformation since 1990, \nbut the export sector remains narrowly based\u2014with the resource sector (copper, gold, electricity, \nand  timber)  accounting  for  70%  of  the  total  exports  recorded  through  customs  (Figure  A6.1). \nThe economic transformation is reflected in the expansion of the industrial sector relative to the \nagriculture and services sectors. Industry as a share of GDP has increased from about 16% of \nGDP in 1990 to 23% in 2000 and 33% in 2008, with investments in hydropower and the mining \nsector  the  engine  of  growth.  Agriculture\u2019s  share  of  GDP  is  declining,  while  services  have \nremained relatively stable at about 26% of GDP. This pattern of structural change is expected \nas  an  economy  grows  and  develops;  resources  move  from  low  productivity  activities  in \nsubsistence  agriculture  and  traditional  services  to  higher  productivity  activities  in  industry  and \nmodern services. This process, and the associated rural\u2013urban migration that occurs with this \ntransformation, has contributed to the reduction in poverty in the Lao PDR.   \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1  The sector analysis benefited from several reports on the private sector in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \n(Lao PDR).

Another 2,835 firms employ 10\u201399 workers and 198 firms employ \n100  or  more  workers.  Sixty-four  percent  are  operating  in  services,  19%  in  manufacturing  and \n3.4%  in  agriculture.  More  than  half  the  enterprises  are  concentrated  around  the  capital \nVientiane  and  the  north,  with  32%  enterprises  residing  in  central  Lao  PDR;  15%  reside  in  the \nsouth.  About  40%  of  firms  have  a  registration  certificate  and  70%  reported  having  a  tax \ncertificate.  The  majority  of  SMEs  are  unregistered,  primarily  because  of  the  high  cost, \ncumbersome procedures, and lack of transparency in the registration process. An ADB red tape \nstudy  reported  that  it  costs  about  $112  per  firm  to  comply  with  registration  procedures  alone, \nand firms had to reregister every year. Business compliance costs more than quadruple when \nthe operation license from the sector ministry and the tax certificate from the Ministry of Finance \nare  added.  These  licenses  are  more  burdensome  on  SMEs  than  larger  firms  when \nbenchmarked against compliance costs per worker.  \n \n\nTable A6.1: Lao PDR Economic Census 2006:  \nEnterprise Size and Location of Primary Economic Units \n\nEnterprise Size \n \n\nEconomic Units \n\nLocation \n% Provinces \n\nLess than 5 employees \n\n118,592\n\n93.4 Vientiane Capital City \n\nNo.\n\n5,268\n\n2,835\n\n198\n\n4.2 North  \n\n2.2 Central  \n\n0.2 South  \n\n5\u20139 employees \n\n10\u201399 employees \n\n100+ employees \n\nEconomic Units \n%\n\nNo. \n\n28,784 \n\n38,017 \n\n40,551 \n\n19,561 \n\n22.7\n\n30.0\n\n32.0\n\n15.4\n\nTotal \n\n126,913\n\n100.0 Total \n\n126,913 \n\n100.0\n\nLao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \nNote: Items may not add up to total as no detailed data were recorded for a few enterprises.  \nSource: Lao PDR, The Steering Committee on Economic Census 2007, Report of Economic Census, 2006 Volume 1, \nNational Statistics Centre, Vientiane Capital. \n \n5. \nIn the short term, the Lao PDR economy is affected by the collapse in commodity prices \nand the global recession. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects that economic growth \nwill  slow  from  7.2%  in  2008  to  4.5%  in  2009  because  of  faltering  garment  exports,  a  fall  in \nresource  revenues,  and  a  slowdown  in  foreign  investments.  In  the  longer  term,  the  Lao  PDR \neconomy  will  be  challenged  by  the  impact  of  the  resource  sector  on  the  competitiveness  and \ngrowth of the non-resource sector. Notwithstanding the current slump in commodity prices, the \nGovernment anticipates significant future revenues to the budget from hydropower investments \nand  mining  in  the  form  of  taxes,  royalties,  and  dividends  over  the  next  decade.  The  revenue \nflows provide the Lao PDR with a significant opportunity to finance its development goals, raise \nper  capita  incomes,  and  reduce  poverty  (as  the  diamond  boom  did  in  Botswana,  another \nlandlocked  economy).  At  the  same  time,  there  are  important  lessons  from  international \nexperience  for  the  Lao  PDR  in  supporting  private  sector  growth  when  there  is  a  large \ncommodity resource sector. A resource boom\u2014like the one experienced from 2006 to 2008\u2014\ncan  affect  the  growth  conditions  of  the  non-resource  sector  if  it  leads  to  an  \u201cexcessive\u201d \nappreciation  of  the  real  exchange  rate.  An  excessive  appreciation  of  the  exchange  rate  may \nslow  growth  of  the  non-resource  tradable  goods  sector  (manufacturing  and  agriculture).  The \nmanufacturing  sector  (especially  garments)  is  particularly  vulnerable  to  an  excessive  real \nappreciation. Unit labor costs in the Lao PDR garment sector are on a par with Cambodia and \nother  neighbors.2 However,  the  sector  operates  on  relatively  lower  profit  margins,  and  since \nwages are paid in kip, an excessively appreciated exchange rate would raise unit labor costs in \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2007.

Updated  estimates  of  the  real  kip  exchange  rate \nindicate that it has appreciated faster than its neighbors from 2006 to 2009, although there is no \ndefinitive evidence that this has hurt the competitiveness of the non-resource sector to date.  \n \nThe  experiences  of  Indonesia  and  Botswana  show  that  modest  appreciation  can  be \n6. \nsuccessfully managed and can be consistent with growth of the non-resource sector. The critical \nlessons  from  these  two  countries  include  the  following:  (i)  fiscal  discipline  (guarding  against \ninflationary pressures from excessive spending of resource revenues in the domestic economy), \n(ii) promoting  a  balanced  public  expenditure  program,  (iii)  maintaining  a  conservative  debt \nstrategy,  and  (iv)  promoting  business  climate  reforms  and  investments  to  raise  productivity  in \nthe  tradable  sector.  The  Government  of  the  Lao  PDR  has  followed  some  of  these  good \npractices\u2014it  invested  in  irrigation  projects  in  1998  and  1999,  which  has  boosted  agriculture \nproductivity,  and  it  reduced  transaction  costs  in  doing  business.  ADB  and  other  donors  are \nproviding  assistance  to  raise  productivity  in  the  agriculture  sector.  However,  the  Government \ndoes not have a strategy for managing resource revenues and much more needs to be done to \nenhance  efficiency  in  trade  facilitation.  Recent  external  developments  also  highlight  that \nsustainable high growth will require diversification of the sources of growth beyond the resource \nsector,  garments,  and  tourism.  This  will  also  reduce  the  Lao  PDR\u2019s  vulnerability  to  external \neconomic shocks. \n \nInvestment surveys and several recent value-chain studies have identified impediments \n7. \nto  the  Lao  PDR  realizing  its  medium-term  growth  potential  and  economic  diversification. \nSurveys  on  business  climate  perceptions  suggest  that  the  following,  among  other  factors,  are \nmajor obstacles to private sector growth and development: regulatory uncertainty and excessive \nred  tape,  remaining  distortions  in  the  trade  regime,  and  inadequate  skills  of  the  labor  force. \nValue-chain  studies  identify  poor  product  quality,  an  inadequate  sanitary  and  phyto-sanitary \nstandards (SPS) policy framework, underdeveloped links between the rural and modern sectors \nof the economy, and relatively costly logistics as constraints to export diversification. A common \nthread in many of these investment and value-chain studies is the Lao PDR\u2019s weak competition \npolicy  framework\u2014broadly  defined  to  include  remaining  distortions  at  the  border  (non-tariff \nbarriers)  and  behind  the  border  (technical  barriers  to  trade  and  industry  regulation,  and \ninvestment incentives). State-owned enterprises (SOEs) remain dominant in several key sectors \nof  the  economy,  and  this  tends  to  undermine  competition  and  economic  efficiency.  The \nGovernment\u2019s approach to SOE reform was first to privatize enterprises in the 1980s and early \n1990s. It is considering a new round of privatizations through partial listings of state enterprises \non the stock market once it is established after 2010.  \n \nB.  \n \n8. \nThis section summarizes the key business climate impediments to private sector growth \nand  economic  diversification.  While  much  progress  has  been  made  in  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment  for  the  private  sector  to  grow  in  the  Lao  PDR,  much  more  needs  to  be  done  to \nlower  transaction  costs  by  addressing  excessive  red  tape,  improving  the  investment  climate, \ncompleting  the  unfinished  trade  policy  agenda,  improving  trade  facilitation,  and  strengthening \nthe institutional framework for SME policy making.  \n \n9. \nTransaction costs for doing business in the Lao PDR are high, but much lower than they \nwere  in  the  1990s.  The  Lao  PDR  continues  to  rank  low  in  several  international  surveys  of \ncompetitiveness  because  of  high  transaction  costs  in  the  regulatory  environment,  trade \nfacilitation, and an undeveloped logistics sector. The 2007 World Bank report on trade logistics \nshows  that  trade  facilitation  costs  in  the  Lao  PDR  are  high  on  a  regional  and  international \n\nMedium-Term Growth Issues \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\ncomparison. The ADB-World Bank Investment Climate Survey of enterprises carried out in 2005 \nreported  several  major  constraints  in  the  Lao  PDR:  infrastructure,  regulation,  taxation, \nmacroeconomic stability, and access to finance. The German Agency for Technical Cooperation \n(GTZ) enterprise survey of 2007 (footnote 1), which is a follow-on to its 2005 benchmark survey, \nprovides  information  about  changes  in  perceptions  or  wareness  about  business  constraints.

The 2009 ADB red tape study estimates that firms on average incur \n$483  annually  to  comply  with  the  three  most  common  licenses\u2014the  enterprise  registration \ncertificate,  sector  operational  license,  and  the  tax  certificate.  Overall,  it  costs  the  business \ncommunity  $36  million  to  comply  with  the  three  licenses.  Depending  on  the  sector,  firms  will \nrequire additional licenses and a realistic estimate of the business compliance costs was 1.5%\u2013\n3.0% of GDP in 2008. The report also showed that red tape costs vary across sectors, with the \npharmaceutical (production and retail) and tourism sectors having relatively high cost regulatory \nsystems.  Foreign  and  domestic  investors  requesting  fiscal  incentives  must  also  obtain  an \ninvestment  license  from  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment  (MPI)  under  the  investment \nlaws. The process is unpredictable, as sector ministries are able to attach additional conditions \nbefore  the  investment  license  is  approved.  The  cost  of  red  tape  has  deterred  entrepreneurs \nfrom  formalizing  their  businesses,  with  only  40%  of  total  enterprises  reportedly  having  an \nenterprise  registration  certificate.  To  address  the  red  tape,  international  practice  takes  a  two-\nstep  approach:  (i)  review  the  existing  stock  of  regulations,  estimate  its  compliance  costs  to \nbusinesses  and  the  economy,  and  produce  a  reform  strategy;  and  (ii)  later  institutionalize  a \nregulatory impact assessment (or review) mechanism designed to screen and monitor future red \ntape issuances. Posting regulations and impact assessments on the relevant ministry's website \nhelps  improve  transparency  in  the  regulatory  regime.  In  August  2008,  the  Government \nimplemented the new registration system, which reduced compliance costs by 35% and saved \nthe  business  community  at  least  $6  million  in  compliance  costs  from  not  having  to  renew  the \nregistration certificate every year.  \n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n57\n\nCompetition policy. The ADB red tape study focused on the business compliance costs \n11. \nof  obtaining  licenses  and  permits.  Other  important  costs  of  the  regulatory  regime  are  the \nadjustment  costs  firms  have  to  undertake  to  comply  with  regulations  and  the  economy-wide \nimpact  of  regulations.  A  common  thread  of  many  of  the  investment  climate  and  value  chain \nstudies is the Lao PDR\u2019s weak competition policy framework (para. 7). Three factors affect the \nnature and level of competition in several sectors. First, the presence of SOEs in the economy \nis widespread, and they are dominant in several sectors in manufacturing and utilities. Many of \nthese  SOEs  have  loosely  defined  public  service  obligations  that  can  affect  their  commercial \noperations and efficiency levels in the sector. Second, the investment incentives regime is very \ngenerous  on  an  international  comparison,  and  lacks  transparency.  Incentives  vary  across \nsectors, regions, and in some instances even among firms in the same sector as the incentives \npackage  appears  to  be  custom-made  for  some  investors.  This  incentives  regime  has  created \nprice  distortions  and  provides  an  un-level  playing  field  for  firms.  Third,  while  most  industry \nregulations restricting competition have been eliminated, pockets of industry are provided with \nprotection or supported by anticompetitive regulations (such as in cement).   \n \nTrade  policy. Compared to other countries, the Lao PDR\u2019s most favored nation import \n12. \nduty rate is relatively low\u2014at a simple average of 10%\u2014although dispersion is relatively high, \nwith duties ranging from 0% to 40%. The effective tariff rate is lower if various duty exemptions \nare included, and when implementation of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \nFree  Trade  Area  (AFTA)  tariff  schedule  commitments  is  achieved.  The  import\u2013export \nmanagement system and import controlled list imposes time-consuming administrative costs on \nimporters  and  producers,  as  well  as  providing  some  protection  to  domestic  industries.  The \nestimates  of  effective  rates  of  protection  (ERPs)\u2014which  measure  the  extent  to  which  trade \npolicy  has  raised  prices  above  international  ones\u2014are  relatively  low  although  pockets  of \nsignificant  protection  to  industry  still  exist  in  food  and  beverages,  metal  products,  and  some \nchemicals.  The  ERP  estimates  also  indicate  that  the  trade  policy  regime  is  biased  against \nsectors  with  potential  for  export  of  goods  (agriculture,  textiles,  and  garments)  as  reflected  in \nsubstantial negative protection to these sectors. The Government is making significant progress \nin  improving  trade  policy,  such  as  the  recent  revisions  to  the  import  licensing  decree  (and \ndistinguishing between automatic and non-automatic licensing), the reduced controlled list, and \nongoing revisions to the import\u2013export management decree. \n \n13. \nTrade facilitation. Trade facilitation is still relatively costly, but it is improving. With large \ninvestments in road networks and infrastructure, and the cross-border transit agreement (CBTA) \nwith Thailand, the cost of trucking goods in terms of delivery time and cost per unit has falling in \nthe  last  several  years. According  to  a  recent TNT  report,3 it  now  takes  4  hours  to truck  goods \nfrom  the  Viet  Nam  border  to  the  Thai  border  via  the  East\u2013West  Economic  Corridor.  However, \nproblems  remain  with  transportation  and  trade  facilitation.  The  local  truck  industry  does  not \nappear to be competitive, and is characterized by poor vehicle standards and breakdowns. The \nhigh cost of the local truck industry is partly offset by the Lao PDR authorities permitting trucks \nfrom neighboring countries to enter the Lao PDR, also cutting costs. There is lack of access of \nLao PDR vehicles of good quality to neighboring countries. The time involved in trade facilitation, \nespecially  through  customs,  remains  costly.  Pre-clearance  is  required  at  Savannaket,  and \noriginal  copies  must  be  sent  to  customs  at  the  border  at  Dansawan,  involving  a  2-day \nprocessing  time.  According  to  the  TNT  report,  the  new  bridge  has  only  saved  45  minutes \nbecause  of  hassle  with  customs.  Another  problem  identified  by  the  study  is  the  lack  of \ndistribution  consolidation  points  along  the  border,  which  would  be  particularly  helpful  for  SME \nexporters  to  store  their  products  while  in  transit.  Problems  of  trade  facilitation  particularly  hurt \n\n                                                 \n3 ACMECS. 2007. Cross Border Transport and Trucking, ACMECS. \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nSMEs as they export small quantities of products, so the fixed costs of trade facilitation account \nfor  a  higher  proportion  of  FOB  export  prices  than  for  larger  firms.  Governments  of  member \nstates  in  the  GMS  are  addressing  some  of  these  trade  facilitation  problems4 by  implementing \nthe CBTA, as well as reforming customs.  \n  \n14. \nTrade  logistics.  The  performance  of  trade  logistic  services  is  critical  to  determine \nwhether the Lao PDR can trade goods and services on time and at low costs. A cross-country \nstudy conducted by the World Bank5 suggests that high logistics costs and, more importantly, a \nlow level of services are barriers to trade and hence, growth. Available indicators suggest that \nLao  PDR  businesses  bear  a  higher  cost  of  logistics  than  other  countries  in  the  region.  The \nlogistics performance index ranks the Lao PDR 117 out of 150 countries in the survey, meaning \nit  is  less  efficient.  This  index  is  developed  based  on  a  comprehensive  survey  of  supply  chain \nperformance,  including  customs  procedures,  logistic  costs,  infrastructure  quality,  timeliness  of \nreaching destination, and the competence of the domestic logistics industry. The Lao PDR was \nranked 146 in domestic logistic costs, 139 in tracking and tracing, 121 in customs efficiency, and \n121 in infrastructure cost. In comparison, Thailand is ranked 31, Indonesia 43, Viet Nam 53, the \nPhilippines 65, and Cambodia 81.   \n \n15.  Sanitary and phyto-sanitary standards. SPSs are key to microeconomic infrastructure, \nimproving the private sector\u2019s access to the international market for agro-based products. The \nLao PDR SPS management system is in its infancy. Lack of resources and technical expertise \nmean  that  development  of  minimum  standards  for  food  and  beverages  is  weak,  especially \namong SMEs. The Government has a broad SPS action plan, although it needs to be reviewed \nin  light  of  the  Government\u2019s  progress  in  preparing  for  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO) \naccession. The Government recognizes that much needs to be done to improve SPSs, including \n(i)  strengthening  the  SPS  framework  for  effective  SPS  management;  (ii)  improving  SPS \nregulations  related  to  food,  water,  and  agro-processed  products;  (iii)  establishing  coordination \nprocesses  and  procedures  for  notifying  WTO  on  SPS  regulations  and  other  TBTs,  and \nestablishing inquiry points within the Government; (iv) ensuring competition within the domestic \nmarket  SPS  providers,  auditors,  and  assessors;  and  (v)  capacity  development  for  effective \nmanagement  systems,  such  as  upgrading  of  laboratories,  assisting  with  the  laboratories\u2019 \nInternational  Organization  for  Standardization  accreditation  so  that  tests  are  internationally \nrecognized,  procuring  equipment  and  rapid  diagnostic  tools,  and  training  staff.  An  ADB  GMS \ntrade  facilitation  project  is  considering  ways  to  assist  GMS  member  states  with  SPS  capacity \nbuilding to enable cross-border trade while adequately protecting the health of crops, livestock, \nand consumers. It is intended to develop an action plan with investment projects based around \nfour areas: (i) developing a risk-based system of border handling; (ii) strengthening regional and \nnational capacities for diagnostic and testing facilities; (iii) promoting private sector capacities for \nfood safety compliance; and (iv) promoting academic training needed for managing SPSs.  \n \nContract enforcement and judicial capacity. Weaknesses in the legal and regulatory \n16. \nframework as well as judicial capacity clearly have an impact on private sector development, as \nreflected  in  the  country\u2019s  rankings  on  key  investment  climate  indicators  in  the  World  Bank\u2019s \n2009  Doing  Business  survey\u2014the  Lao  PDR  is  ranked  181  out  of  181  for  ease  of  closing \nbusiness, 180 out of 181 for investor protection, and 111 out of 181 for enforcing contracts. \n\n                                                 \n4 Also  see  technical  reports  on  customs  and  logistics  development  presented  at  the  5th  Meeting  of  the  Trade \n\nFacilitation Working Group, 16\u201317 May 2007, Bangkok. \n\n5 World Bank. 2007. Connecting to Compete: Trade Logistics in the Global Economy. Washington, DC. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n59\n\nThe  rankings  reflect  a  range  of  factors,  including  outdated  laws  and  regulations \n17. \n(e.g., bankruptcy law), weak capacity and independence of the courts, frequent staff rotations, \nand lack of case precedence, as well as cultural and institutional factors inhibiting recourse to \nlegal means to enforce contracts in a closely knit, consensus-based society (reflected by the low \nnumber of foreclosure cases filed in relation to nonperforming loans, and the time and tedious \nprocesses involved in resolving such cases). \n \n18. \nADB has provided support for capacity building in the judiciary and the development of \nalternative dispute resolution mechanisms (e.g., the Banking Sector Reform Program). However, \nthe impact of these measures has been limited, partly because of the ad hoc and stand-alone \napproach  adopted.  Based  on  experience  and  lessons  learned  from  these  as  well  as  ADB \ninterventions in other countries, legal and judicial reform often require deep-seated institutional \nchanges, including public financial management reforms and increased resources to the judicial \nsector,  if  they  are  to  lead  to  meaningful  and  lasting  results.  This  means  that  systematic  and \nsustained engagement as well as political will are required over the longer term. \n \n19. \nsupported by the PSME program cluster and the post-program monitoring framework:  \n\nThe Government has outlined a strategy to reduce transaction costs in doing business, \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nimplementing \n\nits  SME  strategy, \n\nUnder  Subprogram  1  of  the  PSME,  the  Government  enacted  the  Law  on \nEnterprises  of  2006  which  promised  to  streamline  registration  procedures  and \nintroduce  a  negative  list  of  sectors  restricted  to  enterprise  registration.  Under \nsubprogram  2,  the  Government  implemented  the  enterprise  law\u2014including \nmaking  effective  the  new,  simplified  enterprise  registration  process  with  a \nnegative  list;  and  establishment  of  enterprise  registration  offices  with  internet \nlinks between the central office and pilot provinces. The Government intends to \ncomplete the rollout of the enterprise registry offices by the end of 2009.  \nThe  Government  has  drafted  a  new  law  on  investment  that  provides  national \ntreatment  for  foreign  and  domestic  investors,  and  synchronizes  the  investment \nlists with the negative list under the enterprise law.  \nUnder subprogram 1, the Government\u2014with ADB assistance\u2014drafted the SME \nstrategy and it was approved in early 2008. The Government is making progress \nincluding  regulatory  reform  and \ntoward \ntransparency, capacity development of the SME sector, etc.    \nThe Government is chipping away at the import\u2013export management system. In \n2006, to improve transparency, it reclassified goods on the import controlled list \naccording to harmonized codes. In 2007, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce \n(MOIC)  issued  a  notice  removing  trade  officials  from  the  customs  border  posts, \nand  abolished  the  requirement  that  producers/importers  must  have  an  import \nplan  for  the  year.  Most  recently,  it  revised  the  import  licensing  decree  and \ndistinguishes  between  automatic  and  non-automatic  licenses  consistent  with \nWTO  rules,  reduced  the  number  of  items  on  the  controlled  list,  and  is  drafting \nrevisions  to  the  import\u2013export  management  decree,  including  trading  rights, \nconsistent with WTO rules. \nThe  Government  (MOIC)  has  started  a  regulatory  reform  process,  including \nestablishing  an  interagency  taskforce  to  advocate  the  introduction  of  regulatory \nimpact assessments and pilot test a regulatory impact assessment at MOIC. To \nimprove  transparency  in  regulations  and  procedures,  the  SME  Promotion  and \nDevelopment  Office  (SMEPDO)  upgraded  its  website  and  started  posting \nbusiness  regulations  on  its  website,  as  well  as  elaborating  on  registration \nprocedures.  \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nGoing \n\nforward,  a  second  generation  of  reforms  should \n\nfocus  on  completing \n20. \nimplementation of the SME strategy; implementing a regulatory review  process within national \nGovernment  that  promotes  better  quality  regulations  and  promotes  competition;  enhancing \ntrade facilitation measures in customs, logistics and SPS; and preparing for implementing WTO \ncommitments once Lao PDR accedes to the WTO, planned for 2012.  \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nPOVERTY IMPACT ASSESSMENT \n \nThe PSME will contribute to sustainable reduction in poverty in the short and medium term through (i) an increase in investment and the number of enterprises; (ii) the \nlabor market, with increased hiring activity across most sectors; and (iii) lower prices of tradable goods through increased integration within the region and rest of the \nworld through trade policy reforms.  \n \nChannel of Effect \nGeneral \nInvestment  Foreign and \n\nEffects on the Poor \nIndirect Short Term \n\nSpecific \n\n \n\ndomestic \ninvestment \n(non-\nresource \nsector) \n\nDirect Short Term \nIncrease in investment \nwill support economic \ngrowth  \n \nIncrease in the number of \nenterprises, including \nSMEs, will create \nadditional employment   \n\nForeign investment will \ncreate linkages with local \nsuppliers and further \nemployment opportunities  \n\nMedium Term \nForeign investment will \ncreate technology \nspillovers through labor \nturnover and \ndemonstration effect \n\nMitigation or Enhancement Measures \nImplementation of the enterprise law reduces the costs of \nenterprise registration and opens up new opportunities for \nentrepreneurs. This is reflected in the increased number of \nenterprises registering for the first time\u2014since August \n2008, at least 15% of enterprise registrations under the \nnew law are new enterprises. \n  \nNew investment law promotes national treatment, between \nforeign and domestic investors and streamlines the \ninvestment approval process.  \n \nStart regulatory reform program to reduce further the cost \nof doing business and therefore support sustained \nenterprise growth \n \n\nLabor \nmarket  \n\nFormal and \ninformal \nsector \n\nLower \nprices \n\nTrade policy \nreforms and \nWTO \naccession \n\n \n\n \n\nThe increase in the \nnumber of enterprises has \ncreated new formal \nemployment \n \n \n \nContinued reduction in \nnon-tariff barriers through \nreform of the import \nmanagement system will \nlower prices of goods to \nhouseholds, thereby \nenhancing household \nwelfare \n\nSustained economic \ngrowth through private \nsector development \nrate will expand formal \nemployment and \nreduce unemployment \n\nIncreased integration \nwith regional \neconomies and the rest \nof the world will \nincrease opportunities \nfor trade and \ninvestment and lead to \nincreased incomes \ngenerated from the \nnon-resource sector   \n\nStrengthen trade facilitation measures (such as in \ncustoms, transport, and SPSs) \n\nIntroduce capacity development in trade facilitation, \nespecially in SPS management systems  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n7\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n6\n1\n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fSpecific \n\nMedium Term \n\nDirect Short Term \n\nMitigation or Enhancement Measures \n\nEffects on the Poor \nIndirect Short Term \n\nChannel of Effect \nGeneral \nNet Impact  \n \nChannels  of  effect.  The  PSME  program  aims  to  reduce  the  transaction  costs  in  doing  business  through  regulatory  and  trade  policy  reforms  and  by  strengthening \nrelevant  institutions/agencies  such  as  the  enterprise  registry  offices.  This  will  increase  the  number  of  formal  enterprises  and  jobs.  Foreign  investment  will  promote \ntechnology diffusion. Trade reforms will lower prices of goods.  \n \nTime  dimensions.  The  immediate  impact  of  investment  and  the  increase  in  the  number  of  enterprises  will  be  economic  growth  and  jobs.  Trade  reforms  will  lower \nprices. Over the medium term, foreign investment will promote technology spillovers and lift longer term economic growth rates.   \n \nCrucial Assumptions \nAdjustment costs of trade reforms are not high, as the Lao PDR does not have a large and inefficient industrial base built around high protection.   \n \nLao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, SMEs = small and medium-sized enterprises, WTO = World Trade Organization.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n \n\n6\n2\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\ni\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n7\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n63\n\nLIST OF INELIGIBLE ITEMS \n\n1. \nLoan  proceeds  will  finance  the  foreign  currency  expenditures  for the  reasonable cost  of \nimported  goods  required  during  subprogram  2  of  the  Private  Sector  and  Small  and  Medium-\nSized Enterprises Development Program. \n \n2. \n \n\nNo withdrawals will be made for the following: \n\nexpenditures  for  goods  included  in  the  following  groups  or  subgroups  of  the \nUnited  Nations  Standard  International  Trade  Classification,  Revision  3  (SITC, \nRev. 3) or any successor groups or subgroups under future revisions to the SITC, \nas designated by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) by notice to the Borrower: \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n112 \n121 \n122 \n\n525 \n667 \n718 \n\n728 \n897 \n\n971 \n\nChapter  Heading \n\nDescription of Items \n\nTable A8: Ineligible Items \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n718.7 \n\n728.43 \n897.3 \n\nAlcoholic beverages \nTobacco, unmanufactured; tobacco refuse \nTobacco, manufactured (whether or not containing tobacco \nsubstitute) \nRadioactive and associated materials \nPearls, precious and semiprecious stones, unworked or worked \nNuclear reactors, and parts thereof, fuel elements (cartridges), \nnonirradiated for nuclear reactors \nTobacco processing machinery \nJewelry of gold, silver, or platinum-group metals (except watches \nand watch cases) and goldsmiths\u2019 or silversmiths\u2019 wares \n(including set gems) \nGold, nonmonetary (excluding gold ore and concentrates) \n\nSource: United Nations. \n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nexpenditures  in  the  currency  of  the  Borrower  or  of  goods  supplied  from  the \nterritory of the Borrower; \nexpenditures  for  goods  supplied  under  a  contract  that  any  national  or \ninternational  financing  institution  or  agency  will  have  financed  or  has  agreed  to \nfinance, including any contract financed under any loan or grant from ADB; \nexpenditures  for  goods  intended  for  a  military  or  paramilitary  purpose  or  for \nluxury consumption; \nexpenditures for narcotics; and \nexpenditures  for  environmentally  hazardous  goods,  the  manufacture,  use,  or \nimport  of  which  is  prohibited  under  the  laws  of  the  Borrower  or  international \nagreements to which the Borrower is a party; and \nexpenditures  on  account  of  any  payment  prohibited  by  the  Borrower  in \ncompliance  with  a  decision  of  the  United  Nations  Security  Council  taken  under \nChapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\nA. \n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR): \nThe Private Sector and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Development Program Cluster (PSME) focuses on three \npolicy areas: (i) institutional development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) policy and access to finance, \n(ii) a strengthened investment climate, and (iii) trade policy and capacity building. The PSME policy areas correspond \nwith  those  of  the  Government  as  spelled  out  in  the  Sixth  Five-Year  National  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan, \n2006\u20132010, which focuses on five core areas: (i) economic growth, including fostering SMEs; (ii) providing basic social \nservices; (iii) stronger human security; (iv) enhanced participation by the poor; and (v) developing the poorest regions. \nThe SEDP6 has several crosscutting issues relevant to the PSME, including (i) private sector development through a \nstable  macro-economy,  creating  an  enabling  environment  for  businesses,  and  promoting  foreign  direct  investment; \nand  (ii)  regional  integration,  including  reducing  trade  barriers,  promoting  cross-border  investments  and  economic \ncorridors,  membership  of  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS),  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN), \nand the World Trade Organization (WTO). The SEDP6 mission is to reduce the poverty rate from 33% in 2003 to 23% \nby 2015.  \n \nPrivate sector development and growth is crucial for sustained poverty reduction, as it will be the major generator of \njobs and incomes in the future. This is vital as almost 50% of the population is under the age of 20 years, and over \n80%  of  employment  is  in  informal  activities  (mainly  subsistence  agriculture).  Removing  regulatory  constraints  to  the \nprivate  sector  to  invest  and  create  new  businesses  is  crucially  important.  The  regulatory  transaction  costs  are  more \nburdensome on SMEs, and they constrained dynamic growth of SMEs by keeping most of them informal. Indicative of \nthe  burden  on  SMEs,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  red  tape  study  shows  that  the  annual  average  cost  of \ncompliance with licenses and permits amounts to about $25 per employee in micro and small enterprises compared \nwith  $3  per  employee  in  large  firms  (100  or  more  employees).  The  Government  has  modernized  the  business  law \nthrough the enactment of the enterprise law in 2006, which makes it easier to register a business and open sectors up \nfor new enterprises to invest in by issuing the negative list (people can invest in any sector except for those included \non the negative list). Other reforms include drafting a new  investment law that provides for national treatment for all \ninvestors,  and  reducing  the  nontransparent  forms  of  non-tariff  measures  to  improve  productivity  and  allow  SMEs  to \naccess inputs at lower prices.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nThe poverty incidence dropped from 46% in 1992 to 33% in 2003, as the economy expanded 6%\u20138% per annum for \nmost of this period, and it is estimated at 28% in 2008. Improved rice production and rising overseas remittances have \nalso  helped  reduce  poverty.  The  Government  targets  a  poverty  rate  of  23%  by  2015,  assuming  economic  growth \ncontinues in the current range of 7%. An assessment of poverty implications of the PSME indicates that on balance, \nthe PSME program will contribute to a reduction in the incidence of poverty by lowering the transaction costs of doing \nbusiness. A reduction in red tape and other regulatory compliance costs would induce additional SME start-ups and \ntherefore additional investment and employment. The recent reforms to enterprise registration show that 5,000 small \nfirms have registered for the first time. Obtaining the registration certificate formalizes them and helps open access to \nformal sector funding. Reform of the non-tariff measures will lower the prices of several industrial commodities, which \nin turn will support industrial expansion and jobs. Lower prices will ultimately be passed to households/consumers.  \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nHowever, as part of the PSME process, consultations were held with a wide range of stakeholders, including the \nprivate sector, civil society groups, and development partners. \n \n \n \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No  \n\n  Yes \n\n   No \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n65\n\n \nD.  Gender Development  \n  \nStrategy  to  maximize  impacts  on  women:    The  PSME  has  had  indirect  gender  impacts  through  its  emphasis  on \nreducing the transaction costs of doing business. The improved investment climate will steadily increase the number \nof SMEs. According to the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) enterprise survey of 2005 and 2007, the \nshare of female entrepreneurs has increased from 36.2% in 2005 to 43.3% in 2007. Female entrepreneurs account for \n51.1% of entrepreneurs in microenterprises, 47.5% in small enterprises, and 21% in medium and large enterprises.   \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \n \nE.

The PSME does not envisage any changes to \nlabor market policies. \n\nThe PSME will not have any impact on indigenous people. \n\nThe  livelihood  of  the  poor  and  vulnerable  is  expected  to \nbe positively affected. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Full \n\n Short \n\n None \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n \n\n\fPERFORMANCE OF PRIVATE SECTOR AND  \nSME DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM SUBPROGRAM 2 TRIGGERS \n\nPerformance \n \n\n66 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nOriginal Triggers as Specified \nin Subprogram 1 Document, \nTable A2.2 of Appendix 2 \n1.

MOIC and MPI to synchronize \nthe positive investment list under \nthe Foreign Investment Law with \nthe negative list under the \nEnterprise Law of 2006 \n \n5. MOIC to (i) reduce the number \nof items on the controlled import \nlist, and (ii) produce a strategy for \nreforming the import\u2013export \nmanagement system consistent \nwith WTO rules \n\n \n\n1. Substantially accomplished. MOF, with assistance from the \nEC SME TA project, produced training materials for dissemination \nof accounting practices to SMEs at workshops in 15 of the \n17 provinces in 2008. At the same time, MOF is revising and \nupdating the basic accounting software for SMEs that the EC \nhelped produce in 2005 under EU Banking Training. The purpose \nof the workshops is to assist SMEs to improve accounting \npractices for better access to finance.  \n \n2. Accomplished: MOIC simplified enterprise registration process \nby (i) reducing the number of documents required from 18 to 2\u20136, \ndepending on the type of applicant (e.g., eliminated the \nrequirement for curriculum vitae, declaration of sentencing, and \nasset declaration); (ii) delegating the approval authority to the \nenterprise registry office under MOIC decree 225; (iii) the ERO \ncentral office issuing a ministerial instruction on enterprise \nregistration (instruction no. 0995) that standardized enterprise \nregistration procedures for all provincial offices (called single \nwindow); and (iv) improving transparency in registration process \nby posting on its website all registration documents, forms, \nsamples, and other legal documents, instructions, and notices; as \nwell as posting the registration requirements and procedures in the \npublic area of the registry offices. \n3. Accomplished. MOIC modernized the enterprise registry \noffices at the central level (Vientiane) and completed \nmodernization of seven pilot provinces, which (i) established a \ncentralized web-based database linked to pilot provinces, which \nprovides timely updates on registrations nationally; and (ii) MOIC \nproduced and implemented a capacity development program with \nprovincial the enterprise registry offices, including upgrading \nsoftware and hardware, and training on implementing the new \nregistration procedures and operationalization of the new system. \n4. Accomplished MPI drafted a new Law on Promotion of \nInvestment, which was approved by the National Assembly in \nJuly 2009. This merged the foreign and domestic investment laws, \nprovided for national treatment between domestic and foreign \ninvestors, and streamlined the investment approval process.  \n\n5. Substantially accomplished (reform program ongoing). \nMOIC continued to reform the import control and management \nsystem by the following: (i) the PMO approved the new import \nlicensing procedures decree in July 2009, which distinguished \nbetween automatic and non-automatic import licensing consistent \nwith WTO rules; (ii) as a follow-on to the approved import licensing \nprocedures decree, MOIC has prepared the draft MOIC ministerial \nnotification of items on the prohibited and controlled import and \nexport list\u2014the draft notification has reduced the number of items \non the controlled import list based on the new import licensing \ndecree (expected to be issued in 2009); and (iii) MOIC prepared a \ndraft decree on the application of rules of origin to be submitted it \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n67\n\nNew Policy Trigger \n6.

Accomplished. As part of the Government\u2019s efforts to improve \nSME access to finance, BOL, with ADB TA, has undertaken \nupgrading of the CIB from a manual to a secure computerized \nsystem for commercial banks and BOL. Pilot testing of the CIB \nwas completed in January 2009, with the participation of all \ncommercial banks. Refinements to the CIB are under way and the \nCIB is expected to be operationalized by the end of 2009.
