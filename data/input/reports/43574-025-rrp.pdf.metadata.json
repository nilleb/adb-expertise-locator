It  will  involve  upgrading  of  MDRs  depending  on  traffic  requirements;  reconstruction, \nwidening,  and  strengthening  of  culverts  and  bridges;  and  maintenance  of  the  improved  road \nassets  for  5  years  after  construction.2 The  project  will  also  conduct  a  road  safety  audit  of  the \nMDRs  on  the  core  road  network  (CRN)  and  initiate  remedial  measures  at  identified  critical \nlocations. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nDespite  accounting  for  just  7%  of  India\u2019s  geographic  area,  Uttar  Pradesh  is  home  to \nabout 200 million, or 16% of the national population, making it the country\u2019s most populous state. \nIt  is  also  amongst  the  poorer  states  in  the  country.  Although  Uttar  Pradesh  contributes  about \n8.5% to the country\u2019s gross domestic product, its per capita income is less than half the national \naverage.  Uttar  Pradesh also has  the  largest rural  population in the  country.  Almost  80%  of  its \npopulation lives in rural areas, where agriculture is the main economic activity and contributes \n46%  to  the  state\u2019s  income.  Given  the  dispersed  nature  of  industrial  development,  the  road \nnetwork  is  a  critical  economic  infrastructure.  Uttar  Pradesh\u2019s  total  road  network  is  about \n300,000 km, and the road density per 100,000 people is 104 km against a national average of \n142 km. About 40% of its road network is rated poor to very poor, and only 13% is rated good. \nAbout 58% of this network has road width of less than 5.5 meters and barely 5% is wider than \ntwo  lanes.  If  appropriate  road  capacity  metrics  are  used,  only  35%  of  national  highways  and \n60%  of  state  highways  have  comfortable  capacity  utilization,  while  the  rest  need  capacity \naugmentation such as widening.3 \n \nTo address the problems of road connectivity and capacity in the state, the Public Works \n4. \nDepartment  of  the  Government  of  Uttar  Pradesh  (UPPWD)  engaged  reputable  national \nconsulting firms to provide inputs for a study on the Strategic Core Road Network Master Plan. \nIn addition to preparing a vision  statement  and master  plan,  the  study  aimed to (i)  identify the \nCRN and the requirements to upgrade it; (ii) establish the requirements to augment and improve \nstate highways, MDRs, and other district roads; (iii) plan the connectivity to all habitations by all-\nweather  roads;  and  (iv)  prepare  an  implementation  and  financing  plan  to  achieve  the  above \ntargets,  including  an  assessment  of  potential  private  sector  participation.  The  CRN  study  of \nUPPWD estimates a total investment of $16 billion spread over four phases from 2014 to 2031 \n(the horizon year for the plan). This investment rate of $1 billion per year is proposed to be met \nmainly  through  a  combination  of  government  budget  (about  60%),  public\u2013private  partnership \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  Preparing  the  Uttar \n\nPradesh Major District Roads Investment Program (TA 8427) for $700,000. \n\n3  Government of India. 2011.

A  sector  assessment  summary  is  in \nAppendix 2. \n \n5. \nThe Government of Uttar Pradesh (GOUP) has requested ADB\u2019s financial assistance for \naddressing improvements to MDRs. This will be ADB\u2019s first road sector assistance to the state.4 \nMDRs  form  the  key  linkage  between  rural  roads  and  state  highways,  connect  peri-urban  and \nurban  areas,  and  have  to  be  developed  to  complete  state  road  connectivity.  Developing  this \nnetwork will foster inclusiveness by enabling larger segments of the state\u2019s population to better \naccess markets and basic services. This is aligned with the objective of ADB\u2019s transport sector \ninterventions  in  India\u2014to  increase  the  movement  of  people  and  goods  in  a  safer  and  more \nefficient and sustainable manner. The project involves (i) rehabilitating and upgrading about 430 \nkm  of  MDRs;  (ii)  improving  road  maintenance  and  asset  management;  and  (iii) conducting  a \nroad  safety  audit  of  MDRs  in  the  CRN,  and  implementing  remedial  measures.  UPPWD \nconsultants have prepared detailed project reports (DPRs) for eight road subprojects, and ADB \nhas provided project preparatory technical assistance to review and supplement the DPRs. \n \nSustainable  maintenance.  To  ensure  better  construction  quality  and  improved \n6. \nmaintenance of the road assets after construction, the project will include a 5-year performance-\nbased  maintenance  period  included  in  the  construction  contract.  This  will  transfer  part  of  the \nconstruction  quality  risk  and  maintenance  risk  to  the  private  sector,  and  yield  better  value  for \nmoney to the users. \n \n7. \nRoad safety. According to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways report of 2013, \nthe country\u2019s road safety record is not very good, although it has shown signs of improvement \nsince 2010.5 Uttar Pradesh has one of the poorest road accident records among the states, and \nhas  the  country\u2019s  seventh-highest  number  of  accidents  of  registered  vehicles.  It  also  has  the \nhighest proportion of fatal accidents in the country, with over 11% in 2013. In this context, Uttar \nPradesh became one of the first states in the country to establish a road safety policy in 2014. \nEstablished in partnership with the World Bank and the Government of New Zealand, the policy \ncovers  (i)  building  awareness  of  road  safety,  (ii)  strengthening  institutional  arrangements,  (iii) \nestablishing a road safety database, (iv) ensuring safer road infrastructure, (v) promoting safer \nvehicles, (vi) training drivers for safety, (vii) enforcing traffic laws, and (viii) providing emergency \nmedical  assistance  to  accident  victims.  Projects  under  consideration  by  the  World  Bank  and \nADB will facilitate UPPWD\u2019s actions to improve road safety. The road safety policy of the state \nis in Supplementary Appendix C.6 \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome  \n\n \n\n8. \nThe impact will be improved mobility and accessibility, aligned with the Twelfth Five-Year \nPlan  of  the  Government  of  India.7 The  outcome  will  be  improved  efficiency  and  safety  of  the \ncore road network in Uttar Pradesh. \n \n\n                                                \n4 In parallel, the World Bank is appraising a $400 million loan to the Government of Uttar Pradesh for the Core Road \n\nNetwork Development Project, which aims to improve state highways. \n\n5 Government of India, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. 2013.

About  430  km  of \nMDRs  will  be  reconstructed  and rehabilitated  to two-lane  width  of  7 meters. The  roads will  be \ndesigned  for  all-weather  use  and  with  road  safety  features.  The  construction  contracts  will \ninclude  5-year  performance-based  maintenance  obligations  to  ensure  better  asset  quality  and \nimproved  maintenance.  A  road  safety  audit  will  be  carried  out  for  all  MDRs  in  the  CRN,  and \nappropriate and cost-efficient measures will be implemented to address accident-prone spots. \n \nD. \n \n10. \nexpenditure category and financier are in the project administration manual (PAM).8 \n\nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $428,000,000  (Table  1).

One  executive \nengineer  will  be  assigned  as  project  manager  for  two  or  three  contract  packages.  The  project \nmanagers  will  be  delegated  adequate  technical  and  administrative  authority  for  expeditious \nproject  implementation.  The  PIU  will  engage  construction  supervision  consultants  as  the \nengineers for the construction contracts. All procurement of goods and works will be undertaken \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).

UPPWD  has \ncompleted  the  preparation  of  DPRs  for  all  project  roads,  including  safeguard  assessment. \nUPPWD  has  prepared  the  master  bidding  documents  and  commenced  bidding  for  civil  works. \nBased on this, the national and state governments requested retroactive financing for all project \ncomponents. Up to 20% of the loan proceeds will be eligible for retroactive financing, provided \nthat  expenditures  are  incurred  on  works  and  consulting  services for  the  project  in  accordance \nwith agreed procedures and before loan effectiveness, but not more than 12 months before the \nsigning  of  the  loan  agreement.  The  national  and  state  governments  and  UPPWD  have  been \ninformed  that  approval  of  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  does  not  in  any  way \ncommit ADB to finance the project. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n16. \nThe project was prepared by UPPWD, which has experience with a previous World Bank \nloan  and  technical  assistance.9 UPPWD  engaged  consultants  with  its  own  funds  to  prepare \nDPRs for the roads proposed for ADB financing, incorporating ADB requirements of economic, \nsocial,  and  environmental  studies  into  the  consultants\u2019  terms  of  reference.  ADB  engaged  a \nconsulting  firm  under  a  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  to  conduct  due  diligence  and \nsupplement  the  DPRs  to  ensure  the  due  diligence  complies  with  ADB  requirements.  The \nengineering design was prepared to avoid land acquisition as well as social and environmental \nimpacts, and to take road safety into account. In addition, advance actions have been taken to \nensure  the  construction  can  commence  early.  All  these  measures  have  improved  project \nreadiness and will mitigate the risk of delay. \n \n\n                                                \n9  World Bank. India: Uttar Pradesh State Roads Project.  http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P067606/uttar-pradesh-\n\nstate-roads-project?lang=en&tab=overview. This project provided for technical assistance. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n17. \nEconomic  assessment.  Economic  evaluation  of  the  project  followed  the  standard \npractice of comparing life cycle road and user costs with and without the project, using the net \npresent value with a 12% discount rate and economic internal rate of return (EIRR) as decision \ncriteria.  The  highway  development  and  management  system  was  used  in  the  analysis,  which \nfocused on transport cost savings. \n \nThe  EIRRs for the  project roads  are  assessed  as  16.9%\u201321.2%  in the  base  case,  and \n18. \nremain above 13.8% in sensitivity scenarios. Overall, the economic returns for roads are robust, \nsatisfying the economic efficiency criteria. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to investigate the \nrobustness of the economic viability of the project to cost overruns and benefit reductions. The \nfollowing  cases  were  analyzed:  (i)  base  cost  and  base  benefits,  (ii)  capital  cost  increased  by \n10% and base benefits, (iii) benefits reduced by 10% and capital cost, (iv) capital cost increased \nby 10% and benefits reduced by 10%, and (v) a 1-year delay in construction. The results of the \nsensitivity analysis are in Table 11. In all cases, all project roads have EIRRs above 12%. The \nanalysis result of adverse scenarios shows the project is economically viable. \n \n19. \nFinancial  sustainability.  Annual  average  incremental  recurrent  costs  associated  with \nthe project are estimated to be 0.1% of UPPWD\u2019s current maintenance budget and a marginal \nproportion  of  UPPWD\u2019s  overall  maintenance  budget  on  an  annual  basis.  Funds  allocated  for \nroad maintenance have been rising by about 19% per year from FY2004 to FY2015. The 5-year \nmaintenance obligation will be part of the project, so it is included in the legal agreements and \nwill be part of the contracts. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that funds will be available to meet \nthe maintenance costs. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nInstitutional  capacity.  UPPWD,  the  executing  agency,  is  a  department  of  the \n20. \nGovernment  of Uttar  Pradesh.  Established  in the 1850s,  UPPWD has  also managed  railways, \nirrigation,  and  local  government  infrastructure  projects.  It  currently  manages  roads  and \ngovernment  buildings  in  Uttar  Pradesh.  UPPWD  has  over  50,000  employees,  about  14%  of \nwhom  are  technical  staff.  It  is  headed  by  an  engineer-in-chief  and  head  of  department,  two \nengineers-in-chief, and 25 chief engineers. While UPPWD has extensive experience (technical, \ncontracting,  and  implementation)  in  public  works,  its  experience  working  with  multilateral \nagencies  is  limited  to  one  World  Bank  loan  (footnote  9).  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  are  each \nappraising a road sector loan for UPPWD at present. \n \n21. \nFinancial management. An assessment of UPPWD\u2019s accounting systems and financial \nreporting  and  audit  procedures  concluded  that  the  department  conducts  its  accounts  in \naccordance  with  standard  single-entry,  cash-based  government  systems  and  by  its  budget \nallocation. UPPWD has experience in project financial accounting and disbursement procedures \nbased on its prior experience with a World Bank-funded project. The assessment has concluded \nthat the overall risk is moderate. Key risk and mitigation measures have been identified as part \nof the assessment. UPPWD will retain an accounting firm under this project to assist in project \naccounts  and  train  the  concerned  staff.  UPPWD  will  maintain  separate  project  accounts  and \nrecords by funding source for all expenditures incurred on the  project. Project accounts will be \ncomputerized  and  follow  accounting  principles  and  practices  prescribed  by  the  government\u2019s \naccounting  laws  and  regulations.  Internal  audit  is  carried  out  by  the  Audit  and  Accounts \nDepartment of GOUP, and is subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India in \naccordance with the Accounts and Audit Standards issued by the Government of India. With the \n\n \n\n\fabove  proposed  actions,  the  overall  financial  management  arrangements  are  considered \nsatisfactory for the project. \n \n22. \nProcurement. All consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants using quality- and cost-based selection. All civil works will be procured \nthrough national competitive bidding. E-procurement is essential for all works contracts in Uttar \nPradesh,  and  will  be  used  in  this  project.  Goods  and  works  will  be  procured  following  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines.  UPPWD  has  extensive  experience  in  procurement  and  consultant \nrecruitment for public sector projects, although experience with multilateral agency procurement \nis  limited  to  one  World  Bank  project.  Project  preparatory  technical  assistance  consultants \nsupported  UPPWD  in  preparing  procurement  documents  for  all  project  roads.  Recruitment  of \nconstruction supervision consultants is already under way. The procurement plan for the project \nis appended in the PAM. \n \n23. \nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  UPPWD.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n  \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nUttar  Pradesh  is  one  of  the  poorer  and  less  developed  states  in  India,  with  per  capita \n24. \nincome  less  than  half  the  national  average  and  about  30%  of  population  below  the  poverty \nline.10 Agriculture  is  the  main  source  of  livelihood  for  80%  of  the  state\u2019s  population;  trade  and \nnonagricultural labor are its other sources of income (footnote 3). This also applies to the project \narea of influence, which covers 12 districts with a total population of 34.8 million. 11 Infrastructure \nservices  along  the  road  corridor  are  basic,  with  drinking  water  mostly  accessed  through \ngovernment-provided hand pumps. While rural areas are not connected to the grid, most urban \nsettlements have electricity. \n \n25. \nProject  beneficiaries  will  be  roadside  residents,  road users,  shop owners,  and farmers. \nAccording to the survey data, roadside residents\u2019 most frequent motorized journey patterns are \nfrom  their  residence  to  bigger  market  towns,  district  hospitals,  and  administrative  services,  as \nwell  as  secondary  schools  and  colleges.  Few  (3%\u201310%)  residents  own  private  vehicles,  and \nmost  of  them  use  collective  transport  to  move  around.  Consultations,  which  involved \n1,665 participants, indicated that poor road conditions were preventing safe and reliable travel, \nespecially  at  night  and  during  the  rainy  season.  The  project  will  provide  improved  access  to \nsocial services and facilitate stronger links between rural regions and urban hubs. \n \n26. \nGender. Uttar Pradesh has very poor gender  indicators and has one of the lowest sex \nratios in the country at 912 females per 1,000 males (footnote 3). Local customs in many of the \nproject  roads  have  limited  women\u2019s  participation  in  consultation  activities.  ADB  consultants \norganized  23  women-specific  focus  group  discussions  with  312  female  participants  to  ensure \ntheir  views  were  integrated  into  the  project  design.  According  to  the  focus  group  discussions \nand baseline survey, walking is women\u2019s predominant means of transportation, and the use of \nbicycles  by  schoolgirls  is  common  only  in  a  minority  of  project  roads.  The  majority  of  women \nwere reported to use collective transport, although many perceived it to be unsafe. The following \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n10 Government of India, Planning Commission. 2011. Press Note on Poverty estimates.

Uttar Pradesh has 0.10% HIV prevalence, lower than the \nnational average of 0.27%.12 Given that the project involves improving existing corridors, it is not \nexpected  to  increase  HIV  incidence.  Nevertheless,  contractors  will  carry  out  HIV  and  AIDS \nawareness programs for their laborers at work sites. As for human trafficking, the prevalence in \nthe  project  area  is  low. 13 As  part  of  the  project,  community  awareness  campaigns  for  road \nresidents on HIV and AIDS, human trafficking, and personal and road safety will be conducted \nby  the  nongovernment  organization  implementing  the  resettlement  plan  in  coordination  with \nexisting  local  initiatives.  Moreover,  UPPWD  will  ensure  that  all  contracts  include  provisions  to \nsafeguard labor standards. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n(IEE) \n\nreport  has  been  prepared  containing \n\n28. \nEnvironmental impact. The scope of works under the project involves the improvement \nand maintenance of existing MDRs. Adequate right-of-way is available for all project roads, and \nno significant, long-term, or irreversible environmental impacts are expected. None of the roads \nfall inside environmentally sensitive areas. Therefore, the project has been classified category B \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  A  single  initial  environmental \nexamination \nroad-specific  environmental \nmanagement  plans  (EMPs),  in  accordance  with  the  safeguard  policy,  and  is  disclosed  on  the \nADB  website.  Anticipated  environmental  impacts  under  the  project  entail  typical  road \nconstruction-related issues, such as generation of dust, noise, exhaust, waste from construction \nand worker camps, water contamination, occupational health and safety, erosion, and siltation.  \n \n29. \nEnvironmental  Measures.  The  EMPs  include  mitigation  measures  to  address  these \nimpacts,  such  as  dust  suppression  along  active  construction  fronts  and  camp  sites;  use  of \nmobile  noise  barriers;  and  strict  implementation  of  road  safety-related  Indian  Road  Congress \nand  contract-specific  safety,  health,  and  environment  guidelines.  The  mandatory  1:2 \ncompensatory  plantation  for  the  loss  of  avenue  trees  along  UPPWD  roads  will  be  done.  In \naddition, UPPWD will obtain consent from land owners and jurisdictional district forest offices to \ninstall  additional  plantation  and  permanent  noise  barriers  near  the  locations  of  sensitive \nreceptors\u2014such as schools, hospitals, and other areas identified in the IEE\u2014to minimize noise \nand dust levels during project operation. The costs of these measures are included in the civil \nworks  contract.  The  road-specific  EMPs  will  form  part  of  the  bidding  documents.  Meaningful \nconsultations  have  been  conducted  during  project  preparation,  and  all  the  concerns  of  the \naffected  persons  and  stakeholders  have  been  incorporated  in  the  IEE  and  EMPs.  These \nconsultations included representatives from key environmental agencies, roadside communities, \nand  nongovernment  organizations.  An  integrated  social  and  environmental  grievance  redress \nmechanism  has  been  formed  to  continue  receiving  feedback  and  complaints,  if  any,  from \naffected parties, and addressing them during the construction stage and operation stage. \n  \n                                                \n12 Government  of  India,  Department  of  Health  and  Family Welfare.

The  project  is  classified  category  A  according  to  ADB\u2019s \n30. \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement.  It  is  expected  to  affect  976  non-titled  households  totaling \n7,103 people. UPPWD\u2019s right-of-way ownership of all road corridors has been verified with the \nlocal  Land  Revenue  Records  Department,  and  the  project  does  not  require  private  land \nacquisition.  Road  designs  have  been  modified  to  avoid  resettlement  impacts  to  the  extent \npossible.  Overall,  impacts  will  be  limited  to  external  sections  of  residential  and  commercial \nstructures  (i.e.,  verandas,  stairs,  and  balconies)  without  affecting  their  viability. 14  Only \n27 households will be fully displaced, most of them losing their commercial structures.  Impacts \nhave been adequately addressed through the seven resettlement plans and one due diligence \nreport  prepared  for  the  project.15 These  documents  are  disclosed  on  the  ADB  and  executing \nagency  websites. 16 Affected  persons  will  be  compensated  at  replacement  cost  and  provided \nwith relocation, reconstruction, and income restoration assistance. Special measures have been \nintegrated  for  vulnerable  households.  Grievance  redress  committees  have  been  set  up  in  the \nfield  offices  and  headquarters.  The  executing  agency  will  implement  and  finance  the \nresettlement plans. All mitigation measures follow the guidelines of the resettlement framework \napproved by ADB and UPPWD.17 \n \n31. \nIndigenous  people.  The  project  is  classified  category  C  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. Uttar Pradesh has a low tribal population, representing only 1.1% \nof  its  total  population (footnote  3). The  census  survey  confirmed that the  project  will  not  affect \nscheduled tribe households. \n \n32. \nfamiliar  with \nmultilateral  development  bank  safeguards requirements,  having recently  implemented  a World \nBank project, it did not originally have staff dedicated to safeguard implementation. This project \nwill  build  on  UPPWD\u2019s  experience  and  strengthen  its  implementation  capacity  by  including \ndedicated safeguards staff.  At the central level, UPPWD\u2019s capacity will be increased by adding \none social and one environmental safeguard officer fully dedicated to safeguards. They will be \nsupported by two outsourced environmental and social consultants. At the field level, each PIU \nwill appoint a focal person dedicated to the management of environment and social safeguards \nas well as grievances (safeguards focal officer). The field-level PIU safeguards focal officer will \nbe supported by the environmental and resettlement specialists of the construction supervision \nconsultants, who will guide and monitor the implementation of EMPs and resettlement plans, as \nwell as the awareness campaign, labor standard, and gender activities. \n \nF. \n\nimplementation  arrangements.

Consultant recruitment for construction \nsupervision has been initiated, and procurement documents have been prepared. \nProcurement actions have been initiated in January 2016. Project designs have been \nprepared to avoid land acquisition. However, given UPPWD\u2019s limited experience with \nmultilateral agency projects, the risk after mitigation is retained as medium. \nEngineers and construction supervision consultants will be engaged for quality checks \nin accordance with contracts. ADB will undertake frequent review missions to ensure \ntimely undertaking and quality of contracts. Four project implementation field units are \nbeing envisaged, distributed around the state in proximity to work sites. These units \nwill be supported by firms of construction supervision consultants. The introduction of \n5-year, performance-based maintenance in works contracts will substantially increase \ncontractor accountability for construction quality. Despite these steps, quality control \nwill remain as a task that is best addressed by field staff. The roads are dispersed \ngeographically throughout this large state. Therefore, the level of risk after mitigation is \nbeing retained as medium. \nFive-year performance-based contracts will be adopted and included in the works \ncontracts.
