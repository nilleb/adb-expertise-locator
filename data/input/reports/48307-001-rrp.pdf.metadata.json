I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof $30 million to Engro Elengy Terminal Private Limited (EETPL) for the Engro Fast-Track \nLiquefied Natural Gas Regasification Project in Pakistan.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  Pakistan\u2019s  energy  sector  is  in  crisis.  Since  2008,  power  generation  shortages\u2014\npredominantly on account of fuel (both gas and fuel oil) unavailability\u2014have exceeded over \n5,000 megawatts (MW) on average, resulting in frequent and unscheduled industry shutdowns, \nmassive layoffs, urban blackouts, and frequent public unrest. 2 Almost one-third of the country\u2019s \npower capacity is reliant on gas, hydropower, and fuel oil each. The majority of the fuel-fired \nthermal plants can also operate on gas, provided it is available. Besides power generation, gas \nresources are needed for domestic, fertilizer, industry, and transport usage, and in FY 2013 \ncollectively accounted for half of the country\u2019s energy needs (64.6 million tons of oil equivalent). \nIn FY2013, demand for natural gas was estimated to be 5,938 million cubic feet per day \n(MMCFD) against supply of 3,748 MMCFD\u2014a deficit of 2,190 MMCFD. Compounding this \nproblem is the fast-depleting nature of the country\u2019s domestic gas supply reserves.3 Based on \nthe Pakistan Economic Survey of 2013\u20132014, Pakistan\u2019s gas extraction (of 1.5 trillion cubic feet) \nis declining at an average rate of 2.3% per annum, whereas demand for gas is projected to \nincrease from 5,938 MMCFD in FY2013 to 8,212 MMCFD by FY2028.4   \n \n3.  With few near-term solutions to address the compounding energy deficit, the Ministry of \nPetroleum and Natural Resources (MPNR) identified the proposed project as one of the fast-\ntrack investments for Pakistan to improve its energy security measures. The MPNR sought to \nutilize  existing  energy  handling  infrastructure  in  the  country  by  using  floating  storage  and \nregasification units (FSRUs) to bring regasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) to the country\u2019s \nenergy mix by 31 March 2015.5 Following a tender process, Engro Corporation Limited (ECL) \nspecial purpose vehicle EETPL was selected to develop the project. The first LNG cargo is \nexpected to arrive on 31 March 2015, the required commercial operations date of the project \naccording to the Liquefied Natural Gas Operations and Services Agreement (LSA).6 \n \n2.  Project Design \n4.  This  project  will  be  Pakistan\u2019s  first  LNG  regasification  terminal.  It  involves  the \nconstruction and operation of a 3 mtpa (or ~400 MMCFD) fast-track LNG regasification facility \nlocated at Port Qasim, Karachi, including a jetty, trestle, mooring dolphins, and associated \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  National Electric Power Regulatory Authority. 2014.

", "2 \n \nfacilities, as well as the lease of an FSRU.7 The LNG will be delivered to the new jetty and \ntransferred to the parked FSRU. EETPL will take delivery of the LNG cargo at the terminal from \nan  MPNR-appointed  entity,  re-gasify  the  LNG,  and  release  the  RLNG  to  the  off-taker, \nSui Southern  Gas  Company  Limited  (SSGC)\u2014a  state-owned  enterprise  in  which  the \nGovernment of Pakistan holds 83% shares\u2014in accordance with the nominated quantities under \nthe 15-year take-or-pay LSA.8  \n \n3.  The Sponsor and/or Borrower \n5.  ECL, formerly Engro Chemical Pakistan Limited (from which it separated in 2010), is a \nPakistan-based  holding  company.  ECL\u2019s  principal  activity  is  to  manage  investments  in \nsubsidiary  companies  and  joint  ventures  engaged  in  fertilizers,  polyvinyl  chloride  resin \nmanufacturing and marketing, food, energy, and chemical terminal and storage businesses. The \ncompany operates through five segments: (i) fertilizers, which it manufactures, purchases, and \nmarkets; (ii) polymers\u2014established with Mitsubishi Corporation\u2014which manufactures, markets, \nand sells polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl chloride compounds, caustic soda, and related chemicals; \n(iii) food, including the manufacturing, processing, and sale of dairy and other food products; (iv) \nenergy and power, which includes an LPG import terminal and a gas-fired combined cycle \npower project; and (v) other operations, including engineering and automation businesses. ECL \nis rated AA\u2013 by the Pakistan Credit Rating Agency Limited. \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Output  \n1.  Impact \n \n6.  The project\u2019s impact is to enhance Pakistan\u2019s energy security through diversification of \nthe  energy  base  by  building  a  handling  infrastructure  for  regasifying  LNG.  Since  the  gas \nshortage of 2,190 MMCFD in FY2013 is expected to worsen given the fast-depleting domestic \ngas reserves, lack of new investments, and no new major discoveries, the project will thus \ncontribute to national energy security priorities and help strengthen the country\u2019s natural gas \ninfrastructure. Given that the proposed project of 400 MMCFD will only be able to handle a fifth \nof  the  present  gas  supply  deficit,  its  successful  implementation  will  help  catalyze  further \ninvestment in similar LNG handling facilities in an environmentally sustainable manner. \n \n2.  Outcome \n \n7.  The outcome will be provision of commercially viable, regasified LNG supply to the \npower sector in Pakistan. Once fully operational in 2015, the project will provide the country with \nits first LNG regasification facility. The gas will be fed into the SSGC network and is expected to \nbe used by the energy sector as a replacement for the expensive imported and polluting high-\nspeed  diesel  fuel  on  which  it  currently  relies.  Once  fully  operational,  this  will  help  the \nGovernment of Pakistan save at least an estimated $1 billion9 in foreign exchange on its fuel \n                                                \n7  The use of FSRUs is playing an important role in opening up new markets for LNG, as this has enabled countries \nto import LNG quickly by incurring lower up-front capital costs. Since 2009, 13 countries have become LNG \nimporters, seven of which have used FSRUs. \n8  The levelized tolling charge under the LSA is about $0.66 per million British thermal units (MMBtu). \n9  The underlying assumptions for calculating the potential annual savings of substituting high-speed diesel with \n400 MMCFD RLNG are (i) diesel price of $0.7 per liter, and (ii) LNG price of $12 per MMBtu. In the first year of \noperations, the potential annual savings would be one-half of 400 MMCFD (of RLNG) as the contracted volume is \nonly 200 MMCFD (of RLNG). ", "  3 \nimport bill of about $14.8 billion.10 By providing a cleaner and more efficient fuel for electricity \ngeneration, the project will result in avoidance of greenhouse gas emissions of about 2 million \ntons per annum. Through the safe operation of the terminal, the project is expected to promote \nbest industry standards and improve the skills and operational expertise of local staff required to \noperate and manage the country\u2019s first LNG terminal. \n \n3.  Output \n   \n8.  The project output is the completion of Pakistan\u2019s first LNG regasification facility and \nassociated gas infrastructure, with a gas handling capacity of 3 mtpa by 2015. This would \nenhance Pakistan\u2019s energy security through diversification of its energy base. In addition, the \nproject will help stimulate regional and national economic growth through a combination of \nprivate sector investment, employment skills enhancement, and taxes. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n1.  Consistency with ADB Strategy and Country Strategy \n9.  The  project  is  consistent  with  the  midterm  review  of  Strategy  2020  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  with  its  focus  on  inclusive  economic  growth,  environmentally \nsustainable  growth,  private  sector  development  and  operations,  environment  and  climate \nchange, and infrastructure development.11 ADB\u2019s support for the project is in line with ADB\u2019s \ncountry  partnership  strategy  for  Pakistan,  2009\u20132013,  which  emphasizes  energy  sector \ndevelopment, private sector participation in infrastructure development, and expansion of ADB\u2019s \nprivate sector operations in the energy sector.12 Energy infrastructure has featured prominently \nin ADB\u2019s private sector operations in Pakistan. \n \n2.  Consistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n10.  The project is in line with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, which stresses the importance of energy \nsecurity,  maximizing  access  to  energy  for  all,  transition  to  a  low-carbon  economy,  and \navoidance  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions. 13  The  project  is  a  logical  outcome  of  ADB\u2019s \ndevelopment and reform efforts in Pakistan\u2019s energy sector, which have been designed to \npromote a well-regulated, market-oriented power industry, particularly when the country faces \nchallenges in attracting commercial investment. The supply of RLNG to power producers at cost \nwill make it easier for the government to move toward market-based gas pricing for other \nconsumer segments such as industry and domestic consumers; this, in turn, will provide much-\nneeded stimulus to private investment in domestic gas exploration and production activities.  \n \n3.  Lessons from Previous Operations  \n11.  ADB has taken the lead in supporting the government\u2019s initiatives to attract private \ncapital into the energy sector and has been instrumental in pioneering many transactions, \nkeeping in view local banks\u2019 long-term lending constraints. ADB financed the first two private \nhydropower projects in Pakistan\u2014the 84 MW New Bong Escape and the 147 MW Patrind \n                                                \n10 State Bank of Pakistan.

This catalytic effect is also witnessed \nin other markets in general and for LNG projects in particular. For example, ADB played a \ncentral role in financing the first LNG terminal in India and subsequent financings thereafter; in \neach case, the client recognized that ADB\u2019s presence helped raise additional financing and \npromote  sector  reforms  by  introducing  market-based  prices. 17   The  project  also  fully \ncompliments ADB\u2019s sovereign operation\u2019s support for energy sector reforms that target fuel mix \ndiversification in the power sector.18 \n \nD.  Project Cost and Financing Plan \n12.  The project is estimated to cost between $130 to 150 million, including contingencies \nand will be financed through a combination of equity and debt.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  Table 3 summarizes the implementation arrangements.19 \n \nAspects  Arrangements \nManagement  EETPL management is composed of staff having sufficient experience in \nconstruction and operation of the terminal operations.  \nImplementation period  May 2014\u2013March 2015 (11 months). The estimated commercial operations date is \n31 March 2015. \nOperations arrangements   \nRevenue structure  Based on a 15-year tolling arrangement with SSGC, EETPL will deliver about 400  \nmillion cubic feet per day of regasified LNG to SSGC in exchange for a fixed \ncapacity charge as well as a usage-based utilization charge. \nPerformance monitoring  Key performance indicators, including output and outcome indicators, will be \nreported by EETPL and monitored by the Asian Development Bank. \nECL = Engro Corporation Limited, EETPL = Engro Elengy Terminal Private Limited, LNG = liquefied natural gas, LSA \n= Liquefied Natural Gas Operations and Services Agreement, SSGC = Sui Southern Gas Company Limited. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Engro Elengy Terminal Private Limited \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n14.  ADB will provide a project finance loan of up to $30 million.  \n                                                \n14 ADB. 2005.

ADB  funding  is  needed  for  this  critical  energy  security  asset  as  long-term  limited \nrecourse financing is not readily available in Pakistan\u2019s market. This project is the first of its kind \nin Pakistan, and hence ADB\u2019s support will help set appropriate structural, legal, documentary \nand financial benchmarks which can be used for follow-on projects (the government has already \nindicated that it intends to set up two to three LNG regasification terminals in the next five years \ngiven severe gas shortage of over 2,000 MMCFD). ADB\u2019s has a strong presence through its \npublic  and  private  sector  operations  in  the  country;  International  Monetary  Fund  regularly \nconsults with ADB on country\u2019s energy related reforms. The project involves multiple layers of \ngovernment entities and does not benefit from a government guarantee of offtaker\u2019s obligations. \nThe sponsors value that ADB\u2019s central role in financing energy sector projects will ensure that \nthe government and government entities will continue to honor their obligations for this project \nfor the duration of ADB financing.    \n \n16.  ADB  engagement  with  the  project  sponsors  has  allowed  the  project  to  ensure \ncompliance with the highest environment and social safeguard standards. This engagement will \nalso help improve the environmental management and protection of the project area. \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n17.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified \ncategory A for environment, and category C for both involuntary resettlement and indigenous \npeoples. The potential environmental and social impacts of the project have been identified and \neffective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse impacts are \nincorporated in the safeguard reports and plans. The institutional capacity and commitment of \nEETPL to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed adequate. During \nproject  implementation,  EETPL  will  submit  to  ADB  semiannual  environmental  and  social \nmonitoring reports verified by an experienced external expert; during operations, externally \nverified reporting will continue on an annual basis. \n \n18.  The FSRU and other facilities are located about 5 km from the nearest community in \nPort Qasim, a secure industrial seaport in Karachi. An environmental impact assessment has \nbeen  prepared  to  comply  with  local  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009) \nrequirements. The draft environmental impact assessment was disclosed for public disclosure \non the ADB website on 14 July 2014. A quantitative risk assessment has been prepared for the \nregasification  facility  taking  into  consideration  marine  failure  and  regasification  system  or \noperating failure. The quantitative risk assessment found that none of the scenarios assessed \ngave rise to a high risk to members of the public and that the permanent exclusion zone \nremains within the facility\u2019s berthing pocket. Construction of the project has required marine \ndredging with associated spoil management impacts, including the removal of a significant \nnumber of mangrove trees in a reclamation area of about 41 hectares. EETPL has committed to \na mangrove replacement program, which will be carried out in consultation with an independent \nmonitoring consultant and the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Air emissions and \neffluents from the facility will meet applicable national environmental quality standards and the \nWorld Bank Group\u2019s environmental, health, and safety guidelines. The thermal discharge is \nprojected to be within 3\u00b0C of the seawater\u2019s ambient temperature at the edge of the mixing \nzone. EETPL will apply a grievance redress mechanism; adopt the existing environment, health, \n ", "6 \n \nand  safety  management  system  of  Engro  Vopak  Terminal  Limited;  and  allocate  sufficient \npersonnel to implement and monitor the environmental and social management plan of the \nproject. \n \n19.  Most of the project facilities will be constructed onshore and inside the premises of Port \nQasim, except for a portion of the 23 km natural gas transmission pipeline that will be installed \noutside the port boundary. There are no outstanding compensation issues related to land that \nwill be used by the project within the fenced boundaries of the port. The lease agreement of \nEETPL with Port Qasim Authority covers the area for facilities and pipeline right-of-way. No \nprivate  land  acquisition  is  required  for  any  of  the  project  facilities  and  there  are  no \nencroachments  and/or  use  of  land  along  the  pipeline  right-of-way  which  is  owned  by  the \ngovernment. No villages or residential colonies are located within 5 km of the proposed site. The \nnearest  human  settlements,  about  7\u20139 km from the  proposed  site,  are  Lath  Basti  village, \nPort Qasim residential colony, Goth Lal Mohammad, Goth Mohammad Keserani, and Pipri \nColony. These communities are not considered indigenous peoples according to the criteria in \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) hence no impacts are expected. \n \n20.  EETPL will comply with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy and report regularly to ADB on \nits compliance (including contractors) with national labor laws and adherence to internationally \nrecognized core labor standards.20 \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n21.  EETPL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n22.  The proposed loan is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and single-\nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n23.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the \nCharter),21 the Government of Pakistan will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to \nthe proposed assistance to EETPL. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form \nand substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the Board \nof Directors. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n24.
