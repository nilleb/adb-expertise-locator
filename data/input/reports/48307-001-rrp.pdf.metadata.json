Since  2008,  power  generation  shortages\u2014\npredominantly  on  account  of  fuel  (both  gas  and  fuel  oil)  unavailability\u2014have  exceeded  over \n5,000 megawatts (MW) on average, resulting in frequent and unscheduled industry shutdowns, \nmassive layoffs, urban blackouts, and frequent public unrest. 2 Almost one-third of the country\u2019s \npower  capacity  is  reliant  on  gas,  hydropower,  and  fuel  oil  each.  The  majority  of  the  fuel-fired \nthermal plants can also operate on gas, provided it is available. Besides power generation, gas \nresources  are  needed  for  domestic,  fertilizer,  industry,  and  transport  usage,  and  in  FY  2013 \ncollectively accounted for half of the country\u2019s energy needs (64.6 million tons of oil equivalent). \nIn  FY2013,  demand  for  natural  gas  was  estimated  to  be  5,938  million  cubic  feet  per  day \n(MMCFD)  against  supply  of  3,748  MMCFD\u2014a  deficit  of  2,190  MMCFD.  Compounding  this \nproblem is the fast-depleting nature of the country\u2019s domestic gas supply reserves.3 Based on \nthe Pakistan Economic Survey of 2013\u20132014, Pakistan\u2019s gas extraction (of 1.5 trillion cubic feet) \nis  declining  at  an  average  rate  of  2.3%  per  annum,  whereas  demand  for  gas  is  projected  to \nincrease from 5,938 MMCFD in FY2013 to 8,212 MMCFD by FY2028.4   \n \nWith few near-term solutions to address the compounding energy deficit, the Ministry of \n3. \nPetroleum  and  Natural  Resources  (MPNR)  identified  the  proposed  project  as  one  of  the  fast-\ntrack  investments  for  Pakistan  to  improve  its  energy  security  measures.  The  MPNR  sought  to \nutilize  existing  energy  handling  infrastructure  in  the  country  by  using  floating  storage  and \nregasification  units  (FSRUs)  to  bring  regasified  liquefied  natural  gas  (RLNG)  to  the  country\u2019s \nenergy  mix  by  31  March  2015.5  Following  a  tender  process,  Engro  Corporation  Limited  (ECL) \nspecial  purpose  vehicle  EETPL  was  selected  to  develop  the  project.  The  first  LNG  cargo  is \nexpected  to  arrive  on  31 March  2015,  the  required  commercial  operations  date  of  the  project \naccording to the Liquefied Natural Gas Operations and Services Agreement (LSA).6 \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\nThis  project  will  be  Pakistan\u2019s  first  LNG  regasification  terminal.  It  involves  the \n4. \nconstruction and operation of a 3 mtpa (or ~400 MMCFD) fast-track LNG regasification facility \nlocated  at  Port  Qasim,  Karachi,  including  a  jetty,  trestle,  mooring  dolphins,  and  associated \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2\n  National Electric Power Regulatory Authority. 2014.

EETPL will take delivery of the LNG cargo at the terminal from \nan  MPNR-appointed  entity,  re-gasify  the  LNG,  and  release  the  RLNG  to  the  off-taker, \nSui Southern  Gas  Company  Limited  (SSGC)\u2014a  state-owned  enterprise \nthe \nGovernment of Pakistan holds 83% shares\u2014in accordance with the nominated quantities under \nthe 15-year take-or-pay LSA.8  \n \n\nin  which \n\n3. \n\nThe Sponsor and/or Borrower \n\n5. \nECL, formerly Engro Chemical Pakistan Limited (from which it separated in 2010), is a \nPakistan-based  holding  company.  ECL\u2019s  principal  activity  is  to  manage  investments  in \nsubsidiary  companies  and  joint  ventures  engaged  in  fertilizers,  polyvinyl  chloride  resin \nmanufacturing and marketing, food, energy, and chemical terminal and storage businesses. The \ncompany operates through five segments: (i) fertilizers, which it manufactures, purchases, and \nmarkets; (ii) polymers\u2014established with Mitsubishi Corporation\u2014which manufactures, markets, \nand sells polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl chloride compounds, caustic soda, and related chemicals; \n(iii) food, including the manufacturing, processing, and sale of dairy and other food products; (iv) \nenergy  and  power,  which  includes  an  LPG  import  terminal  and  a  gas-fired  combined  cycle \npower project; and (v) other operations, including engineering and automation businesses. ECL \nis rated AA\u2013 by the Pakistan Credit Rating Agency Limited. \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Output  \n\n1. \n\nImpact \n\n \n6. \nThe  project\u2019s  impact  is to  enhance  Pakistan\u2019s  energy  security  through  diversification of \nthe  energy  base  by  building  a  handling  infrastructure  for  regasifying  LNG.  Since  the  gas \nshortage of 2,190 MMCFD in FY2013 is expected to worsen given the fast-depleting domestic \ngas  reserves,  lack  of  new  investments,  and  no  new  major  discoveries,  the  project  will  thus \ncontribute  to  national  energy  security  priorities  and  help  strengthen  the  country\u2019s  natural  gas \ninfrastructure. Given that the proposed project of 400 MMCFD will only be able to handle a fifth \nof  the  present  gas  supply  deficit,  its  successful  implementation  will  help  catalyze  further \ninvestment in similar LNG handling facilities in an environmentally sustainable manner. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n \nThe  outcome  will  be  provision  of  commercially  viable,  regasified  LNG  supply  to  the \n7. \npower sector in Pakistan. Once fully operational in 2015, the project will provide the country with \nits first LNG regasification facility. The gas will be fed into the SSGC network and is expected to \nbe used by the energy sector as a replacement for the expensive imported and polluting high-\nspeed  diesel  fuel  on  which  it  currently  relies.  Once  fully  operational,  this  will  help  the \nGovernment  of  Pakistan  save  at  least  an  estimated  $1  billion9  in  foreign  exchange  on  its  fuel \n\n                                                \n7  The use of FSRUs is playing an important role in opening up new markets for LNG, as this has enabled countries \nto  import  LNG  quickly  by  incurring  lower  up-front  capital  costs.  Since  2009,  13  countries  have  become  LNG \nimporters, seven of which have used FSRUs. \n\n8  The levelized tolling charge under the LSA is about $0.66 per million British thermal units (MMBtu). \n9  The  underlying  assumptions  for  calculating  the  potential  annual  savings  of  substituting  high-speed  diesel  with \n400 MMCFD RLNG are (i) diesel price of $0.7 per liter, and (ii) LNG price of $12 per MMBtu. In the first year of \noperations, the potential annual savings would be one-half of 400 MMCFD (of RLNG) as the contracted volume is \nonly 200 MMCFD (of RLNG). \n\n\f  3 \n\nimport  bill of  about  $14.8  billion.10  By  providing  a  cleaner  and  more  efficient fuel for  electricity \ngeneration, the project will result in avoidance of greenhouse gas emissions of about 2 million \ntons per annum. Through the safe operation of the terminal, the project is expected to promote \nbest industry standards and improve the skills and operational expertise of local staff required to \noperate and manage the country\u2019s first LNG terminal. \n \n\n3. \n\nOutput \n\n   \nThe  project  output  is  the  completion  of  Pakistan\u2019s  first  LNG  regasification  facility  and \n8. \nassociated  gas  infrastructure,  with  a  gas  handling  capacity  of  3  mtpa  by  2015.  This  would \nenhance  Pakistan\u2019s  energy  security  through  diversification  of  its  energy  base.  In  addition,  the \nproject  will  help  stimulate  regional  and  national  economic  growth  through  a  combination  of \nprivate sector investment, employment skills enhancement, and taxes. \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with ADB Strategy and Country Strategy \n\n9. \nThe  project  is  consistent  with  the  midterm  review  of  Strategy  2020  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  with  its  focus  on  inclusive  economic  growth,  environmentally \nsustainable  growth,  private  sector  development  and  operations,  environment  and  climate \nchange,  and  infrastructure  development.11  ADB\u2019s  support  for  the  project  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \ncountry  partnership  strategy  for  Pakistan,  2009\u20132013,  which  emphasizes  energy  sector \ndevelopment, private sector participation in infrastructure development, and expansion of ADB\u2019s \nprivate sector operations in the energy sector.12 Energy infrastructure has featured prominently \nin ADB\u2019s private sector operations in Pakistan. \n \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n\n10. \nThe project is in line with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, which stresses the importance of energy \nsecurity,  maximizing  access  to  energy  for  all,  transition  to  a  low-carbon  economy,  and \navoidance  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions. 13   The  project  is  a  logical  outcome  of  ADB\u2019s \ndevelopment  and  reform  efforts  in  Pakistan\u2019s  energy  sector,  which  have  been  designed  to \npromote  a  well-regulated,  market-oriented  power  industry,  particularly  when  the  country  faces \nchallenges in attracting commercial investment. The supply of RLNG to power producers at cost \nwill  make  it  easier  for  the  government  to  move  toward  market-based  gas  pricing  for  other \nconsumer segments such as industry and domestic consumers; this, in turn, will provide much-\nneeded stimulus to private investment in domestic gas exploration and production activities.  \n \n\n3. \n\nLessons from Previous Operations  \n\n11. \nADB  has  taken  the  lead  in  supporting  the  government\u2019s  initiatives  to  attract  private \ncapital  into  the  energy  sector  and  has  been  instrumental  in  pioneering  many  transactions, \nkeeping  in  view  local  banks\u2019  long-term  lending  constraints.  ADB  financed  the  first  two  private \nhydropower  projects  in  Pakistan\u2014the  84  MW  New  Bong  Escape  and  the  147  MW  Patrind \n\n                                                \n10 State Bank of Pakistan.

This catalytic effect is also witnessed \nin  other  markets  in  general  and  for  LNG  projects  in  particular.  For  example,  ADB  played  a \ncentral role in financing the first LNG terminal in India and subsequent financings thereafter; in \neach  case,  the  client  recognized  that  ADB\u2019s  presence  helped  raise  additional  financing  and \npromote  sector  reforms  by  introducing  market-based  prices. 17   The  project  also  fully \ncompliments ADB\u2019s sovereign operation\u2019s support for energy sector reforms that target fuel mix \ndiversification in the power sector.18 \n \nD. \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  between  $130  to  150  million,  including  contingencies \n\n12. \nand will be financed through a combination of equity and debt.  \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTable 3 summarizes the implementation arrangements.19 \n\n13. \n \nAspects \nManagement \n\nImplementation period \n\nOperations arrangements \nRevenue structure \n\nPerformance monitoring \n\nArrangements \nEETPL management is composed of staff having sufficient experience in \nconstruction and operation of the terminal operations.  \nMay 2014\u2013March 2015 (11 months).

This project is the first of its kind \nin  Pakistan,  and  hence  ADB\u2019s  support  will  help  set  appropriate  structural,  legal,  documentary \nand financial benchmarks which can be used for follow-on projects (the government has already \nindicated that it intends to set up two to three LNG regasification terminals in the next five years \ngiven  severe  gas  shortage  of  over  2,000  MMCFD).  ADB\u2019s  has  a  strong  presence  through  its \npublic  and  private  sector  operations  in  the  country;  International  Monetary  Fund  regularly \nconsults  with  ADB  on  country\u2019s  energy related  reforms. The  project  involves  multiple  layers of \ngovernment entities and does not benefit from a government guarantee of offtaker\u2019s obligations. \nThe sponsors value that ADB\u2019s central role in financing energy sector projects will ensure that \nthe government and government entities will continue to honor their obligations for this project \nfor the duration of ADB financing.    \n \nADB  engagement  with  the  project  sponsors  has  allowed  the  project  to  ensure \n16. \ncompliance with the highest environment and social safeguard standards. This engagement will \nalso help improve the environmental management and protection of the project area. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project  is  classified \n17. \ncategory  A  for  environment,  and  category  C  for  both  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous \npeoples. The potential environmental and social impacts of the project have been identified and \neffective  measures  to  avoid,  minimize,  mitigate,  and  compensate  for  the  adverse  impacts  are \nincorporated  in  the  safeguard  reports  and  plans.  The  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  of \nEETPL to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed adequate. During \nproject  implementation,  EETPL  will  submit  to  ADB  semiannual  environmental  and  social \nmonitoring  reports  verified  by  an  experienced  external  expert;  during  operations,  externally \nverified reporting will continue on an annual basis. \n \n18. \nThe  FSRU  and  other  facilities  are  located  about  5  km  from  the  nearest  community  in \nPort  Qasim,  a  secure  industrial  seaport  in  Karachi.  An  environmental  impact  assessment  has \nlocal  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009) \nbeen  prepared \nrequirements.  The  draft  environmental  impact  assessment  was  disclosed  for  public  disclosure \non the ADB website on 14 July 2014. A quantitative risk assessment has been prepared for the \nregasification  facility  taking  into  consideration  marine  failure  and  regasification  system  or \noperating failure. The quantitative  risk  assessment found that  none  of the  scenarios  assessed \ngave  rise  to  a  high  risk  to  members  of  the  public  and  that  the  permanent  exclusion  zone \nremains  within  the  facility\u2019s  berthing  pocket.  Construction  of  the  project  has  required  marine \ndredging  with  associated  spoil  management  impacts,  including  the  removal  of  a  significant \nnumber of mangrove trees in a reclamation area of about 41 hectares. EETPL has committed to \na mangrove replacement program, which will be carried out in consultation with an independent \nmonitoring consultant and the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Air emissions and \neffluents from the facility will meet applicable national environmental quality standards and the \nWorld  Bank  Group\u2019s  environmental,  health,  and  safety  guidelines.  The  thermal  discharge  is \nprojected  to  be  within  3\u00b0C  of  the  seawater\u2019s  ambient  temperature  at  the  edge  of  the  mixing \nzone. EETPL will apply a grievance redress mechanism; adopt the existing environment, health, \n\nto  comply  with \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nand  safety  management  system  of  Engro  Vopak  Terminal  Limited;  and  allocate  sufficient \npersonnel  to  implement  and  monitor  the  environmental  and  social  management  plan  of  the \nproject. \n \n19.  Most of the project facilities will be constructed onshore and inside the premises of Port \nQasim, except for a portion of the 23 km natural gas transmission pipeline that will be installed \noutside  the  port  boundary.  There  are  no  outstanding  compensation  issues  related  to  land  that \nwill  be  used  by  the  project  within  the  fenced  boundaries  of  the  port.  The  lease  agreement  of \nEETPL  with  Port  Qasim  Authority  covers  the  area  for  facilities  and  pipeline  right-of-way.  No \nprivate  land  acquisition  is  required  for  any  of  the  project  facilities  and  there  are  no \nencroachments  and/or  use  of  land  along  the  pipeline  right-of-way  which  is  owned  by  the \ngovernment. No villages or residential colonies are located within 5 km of the proposed site. The \nnearest  human  settlements,  about  7\u20139  km  from  the  proposed  site,  are  Lath  Basti  village, \nPort Qasim  residential  colony,  Goth  Lal  Mohammad,  Goth  Mohammad  Keserani,  and  Pipri \nColony. These communities are not considered indigenous peoples according to the criteria in \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) hence no impacts are expected. \n \n20. \nEETPL will comply with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy and report regularly to ADB on \nits compliance (including contractors) with national labor laws and adherence to internationally \nrecognized core labor standards.20 \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n21. \nEETPL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nThe  proposed  loan  is  within  the  medium-term,  country,  industry,  group,  and  single-\n\n22. \nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD. \n\nAssurances \n\n23. \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the \nCharter),21 the Government of Pakistan  will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to \nthe proposed assistance to EETPL. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form \nand substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the Board \nof Directors. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n24. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$30,000,000  to  Engro  Elengy  Terminal  Private  Limited  for  the  Engro  Fast-Track  Liquefied \nNatural Gas Regasification Project in Pakistan from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with such \n\n                                                \n20 ADB. 2003.
