THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nNepal for the additional financing of the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) \nPower System Expansion Project.1 \n \n2.  The additional financing will cover a shortfall resulting from a change in the financing \namount provided by one of the current project\u2019s cofinanciers. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The project will assist Nepal\u2019s energy sector development by facilitating (i) expansion of \ndomestic power transmission capacity, (ii) power exchange with India, (iii) augmentation and \nexpansion of the distribution networks, and (iv) mini grid-based renewable energy access in rural \nareas.  The  project  is  prioritized  as  part  of  the  SASEC  Program\u2019s  Power  Generation  and \nTransmission Master Plan and Regional Cooperation Business Plan, 2014\u20132016.2  \n \n4.  The original project (footnote 1) was approved by the Board of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) on 4 July 2014, signed on 11 July 2014, and became effective on 15 January 2015. At the \ntime of approval, total financing for the project was $371.2 million, consisting of (i) $180.0 million \nfrom ADB\u2019s concessional ordinary capital resources (Loan 3139), (ii) $60.0 million equivalent from \nthe Government of Norway (Grant 0397), (iii) $11.2 million from ADB\u2019s Strategic Climate Fund (SCF) \n(Grant 0398), and (iv) a loan of $120.0 million from the European Investment Bank. Loan 3139, Grant \n0397, and Grant 0398 are closing on 30 June 2022. The first additional financing\u2014$20.0 million \n(Grant 0520) from ADB\u2019s SCF\u2014was approved on 29 November 2016, signed on 18 January \n2017, and became effective on 19 May 2017. Grant 0520 is also closing on 30 June 2022. The \nNepal Electricity Authority (NEA) is the executing agency for outputs 1, 2 and 5 and Alternative \nEnergy Promotion Centre (AEPC) is the executing agency for output 3 and both are the executing \nagencies for output 4 of the project. \n \n5.  The project has been performing well and is rated on track since its approval. Of the net \ncurrent  loan  and  grants,  cumulative  contract  awards  total  $173.56  million  (80%)  and \ndisbursements $73.79 million (34%).  Under the loan and ADB-administered grant components \nimplemented by NEA, 12 of 13 contract packages have been awarded and the procurement \nrelating to the remaining one contract package (approximately $6.5 million) is ongoing, and is \nexpected  to  be  awarded  within  2018.  The  components  implemented  by  AEPC  are  also \nprogressing  well  and  will  be  completed  within  the  original  implementation  period.  The \nimplementation under all the ongoing contracts are generally satisfactory. The current project is \ncomplying with safeguard policy requirements and overall safeguard implementation is rated \nsatisfactory. \n \n6.  In 2016, Norway decided to reduce its grant contribution from $60.0 million equivalent to \n$22.0 million equivalent following the more critical 2016 refugee crisis in Europe.  As a result of \nthis decision, the project now faces a funding gap in the components financed by Norway and \nimplemented by NEA. Based on works undertaken, contracts awarded, revised estimates of \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB).

Regional Cooperation Operations Business Plan: South Asia, 2014\u20132016. Manila. ", "2 \ncontracts still to be awarded, and available allocation from contingencies, NEA estimates the \noverall funding gap to be approximately $20 million. The proposed second additional financing \nwill support the transmission of clean energy from hydropower and distribution subprojects that \nwere originally earmarked for cofinancing by Norway, and a prudent contingency allocation to \ncover possible cost overruns on other subprojects and has been considered as climate change \nmitigation. \n \n7.  The project is accorded high priority by the government, and is consistent with the current \ncountry partnership strategy.3 The government has requested investment support from ADB to \ncover the shortfall resulting from the change in the financing arrangement with the Government \nof Norway.4 The project remains technically feasible, economically viable, and financially sound. \n \n8.  The executing and the main implementing agency of the project, NEA has recently \nundergone significant positive changes in the financial and operational performance which are \nnow evident. A recent (FY2017) tariff increase combined with NEA\u2019s efforts to target commercial \nelectricity losses, significantly reduced load-shedding in its distribution area, and a government-\nbacked financial restructuring plan led to the posting of NEA\u2019s first net profit in more than 10 \nyears. Another positive development is the enactment of the Electricity Regulatory Commission \nBill in 2018, which will lead to the formation of the Electricity Regulatory Commission (ERC), \nhelping to undertake important reform actions such as designing and approval of cost-reflective \nend-use electricity tariffs. \n \nB.  Impacts and Outcome \n9.  The impacts and outcomes of the overall project will remain unchanged. The impact \nwill be increased electricity access in Nepal and improved power exchange across the border. \nThe project will have the following outcomes: increased capacity of the national power grid \nand enhanced renewable energy development.5 \nC.  Outputs \n10.  The outputs of the overall project will remain the same as the current project: (i) power \ntransmission capacity increased, (ii) power distribution network improved, (iii) mini grid-based \nrenewable energy systems in off-grid areas increased, (iv) capacity development for NEA and \nAEPC provided, and (v) a utility-scale solar photovoltaic project developed.6  \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n11.  The project is estimated to cost $466.5 million (Table 1). \n \n   \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2013.

The government further sent the request for $20 million additional financing on \n22 June 2018. ADB\u2019s South Asia Department confirmed that such financial assistance can be accommodated in the \n2018 resource envelope by reallocating savings from the Vice-President (Operations 1) pool. \n5  The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n6  Output (v) was not in the original project, but was added in conjunction with the first additional financing (from ADB\u2019s \nSCF). \n ", "3 \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nCurrent  Additional \nItem     Amounta   Financingb  Total \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  NEA will serve as the executing agency and the existing project management unit for the \ncurrent project under the project management directorate (PMD) of NEA will implement all \nactivities under this additional financing. The current project managers assigned by NEA project \nmanagement directorate will continue for this additional financing. The additional financing will be \nimplemented over 4 years from approval with an estimated completion date of 31 December 2021 \nand closing date of 30 June 2022.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n16.  Technical due diligence undertaken during the processing of the current project remains \nvalid and confirms that the project is still technically feasible. The proposed technologies and \ndesign concepts are similar to NEA\u2019s existing technologies and practices for transmission system \ndesign, construction, and operation, except that NEA had no experience with high-temperature, \nlow-sag conductors. The potential impacts of climate change on electricity transmission and \ndistribution  will  also  be  considered.  Project  supervision  consultants  are  assisting  NEA  in \nimplementation of the current project. \n \n                                                \n7  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n17.  The financial analysis of the project was updated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Financial \nManagement and Analysis of Projects.8 To reflect the most recently available cost information, all \nfinancial costs and benefits were expressed in constant 2018 prices. NEA\u2019s weighted average \ncost of capital was estimated at 1.5% (in pretax real terms). It is anticipated that the ERC (para. 8) \nwill determine the first cost-reflective electricity tariffs for FY 2020 (commencing July 2019.) For \nthe purposes of financial analysis, it was assumed that tariffs would remain at current levels until \nthen and subsequently increase at 2% per year in nominal terms. On this basis, the aggregate \nproject financial internal rate of return is estimated at 1.7%, which is comparable with the overall \nweighted average cost of capital of 1.5%. The financial internal rate of return is estimated \nconservatively, in that the ERC is likely to determine tariffs that are higher than used for this \nanalysis. In particular, it is unlikely that the average tariff will decline in real terms over the analysis \nperiod. However, the tariff-setting philosophy and methodology that the ERC will adopt are \nunknown at present. \n \n18.  NEA posted a net profit of NRs1.5 billion in FY2016\u2014its first profit in more than 10 years \n(para. 8). This improved outlook is tempered by the fact that the NEA\u2019s balance sheet still contains \nlong-term debt that is unlikely to ever be repaid, financing overvalued fixed assets against which \na commercial return is unlikely to ever be earned. Further balance sheet restructuring and \nreconciliation will be required to ensure that the new sector regulator allows costs to be passed \nto consumers through electricity tariffs. \n \n19.  The project has been analyzed for economic viability using a with- and without-project \napproach in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.9 The \neconomic analysis conducted for the current project has been retained for this additional financing \nmainly because the original scope remains unchanged, with the additional financing being used \nto fill financing gaps resulting from a change in the cofinancing arrangement. The economic \ninternal rate of return of the project is 22%. Sensitivity analysis shows that the project returns are \nrobust against changes to critical variables with a minimum economic internal rate of return of \n16%. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n20.  The procurement capacity assessments of NEA conducted as part of due diligence for the \noriginal project remain valid. NEA has sufficient experience in local and foreign procurement, \nincluding ADB standard bidding procedures under domestic projects and external assistance from \ninternational development partners. \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the NEA. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 7). \n \n22.  The pre-mitigation financial management risk is rated substantial considering the capacity \nof the NEA, including funds-flow arrangements, staffing, accounting and financial reporting \nsystems, financial information systems, and internal and external auditing arrangements. These \nfinancial management shortcomings are being addressed. The NEA has prepared new manuals \nfor internal audit and accounting and updated its internal control policies (all of which are due for \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n9  ADB. 2017. Guidelines for Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "6 \napproval  by  the  NEA\u2019s  board  by  July  2018).  The  accounting  manual  now  largely  reflects \nInternational Financial Reporting Standards accounting requirements, and the NEA plans to start \nreporting  using  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  requirements  from  FY2020.  In \nanticipation of the introduction of a company-wide enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution \nbeing supported through World Bank, the NEA is about to complete converting accounting \ndatabases that were formerly maintained in Excel to Oracle databases. \n \n23.  The financial management assessment of the NEA conducted in September 2016 for the \nNepal Power Transmission and Distribution Efficiency Enhancement Project was updated in \n2018.10 The assessment found the key financial management weaknesses or risks to be (i) the \ncurrent spreadsheet-based accounting system is inflexible, prone to errors, and inadequate for \nan entity of the NEA\u2019s size and complexity; (ii) inflated assets and liabilities should be written \ndown;  (iii)  resolution  of  audit  issues  is  inadequate;  (iv)  implementation  of  the  ERP-based \nintegrated financial management information system has been delayed; and (v) internal controls \nare weak. A further concern arises from the government\u2019s preference that all future loans will \ninvolve direct foreign currency borrowing by the NEA from development partners, with a sovereign \nguarantee. The NEA also had difficulty in complying with financial covenants under previous \nloans, in particular the debt service coverage ratio.  However, the recent improvements in the \nNEA\u2019s financial results are encouraging. The possible delay in operationalization of the recently \nestablished ERC is also a potential risk. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n24.  The assessment of the current project\u2019s poverty and social dimensions remains valid. The \nadditional financing project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming, and the current \nproject\u2019s Gender Equality and Social Inclusion Action Plan will continue to be implemented. \nEnhanced electricity access, end-user awareness-raising activities, strengthening of mini-grid \nrenewable energy systems, and promotion of productive energy use will all contribute to reducing \nwomen\u2019s time poverty. The executing agencies and contractors will ensure that priority and \npreference  are  given  to  local  workers,  including  women  and  marginalized  ethnic  groups. \nEmployment practices will adhere to national core labor standards.11 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n25.  Environment (Category C). The additional financing will be used to cover a funding gap \nwithin  the  existing  scale  and  scope.  In  this  regard,  the  additional  financing  is  classified  as \nenvironment category C in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The current \nproject is category B and all environmental safeguards requirements\u2014such as preparation of initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE)  and  environmental  management  plans  (EMPs)  for  all \ntransmission line packages under the project\u2014have been complied with, approved by both ADB \nand the government, and disclosed on the ADB website. No additional scope of work has been \nadded under the additional financing, and therefore the IEE and EMP requirements will continue \n                                                \n10 ADB.  Nepal:  Power  Transmission  and  Distribution  Efficiency  Enhancement  Project. \nhttps://www.adb.org/projects/50059-001/main. \n11 The cost for implementation of the Gender Equality and Social Inclusion Action Plan is estimated at $1.5 million; \nactivities under the plan led by NEA will be financed under ADB. 2014.

The tree clearance plan for the transmission line packages has been approved \nby the government, and will also be applicable for the additional financing. \n \n26.  The IEE and EMPs for all components include mitigation measures, monitoring, and \nbudgetary provisions that are adequate to address the environmental impacts of both the current \nproject and the additional financing. The EMP requirements have been incorporated in the bidding \ndocuments. The current project requires implementing the EMP, regularly monitoring safeguard \ncompliance, and timely submission of periodic environmental compliance monitoring reports. \nThese compliance requirements will continue under the additional financing. The NEA and AEPC \nare supervising EMP implementation, including preparation of semiannual monitoring reports with \nthe  support  of  environment  consultant.  Public  consultation  and  information  disclosure \nrequirements have been met, including consultation with the local stakeholders and the district \nforest offices. Hence, the current project\u2019s safeguards implementation, monitoring, and reporting \nmechanism will continue, along with the inputs of the environmental safeguard consultant in \nproject  management  consultancy.  The  services  of  NEA\u2019s  environment  and  social  studies \ndepartment will also support the project in EMP and occupational health and safety assurance. \n \n27.  Social safeguards (category C for both involuntary resettlement and indigenous \npeoples). The social safeguard requirements for the current project are unchanged,  as the \nadditional financing involves no additional scope or civil works activity other than planned under the \noriginal scope of work. The additional financing will cover the shortfall in the loan amount resulting \nfrom a change in the agreed cofinancing arrangement to complete the components in the current \nproject. All activities under the additional financing will be implemented using land already acquired \nunder the ongoing loan. No land acquisition or impacts on indigenous people are envisaged for the \nadditional financing. A combined resettlement and indigenous peoples plan (RIPP) was prepared \nfor the current project covering all project components, and has been approved by ADB and the \ngovernment. The RIPP is being implemented. The involuntary resettlement category for the current \nproject will remain category A, and the indigenous people category will remain category B while this \nadditional financing project is category C for both involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. \n \n28.  Social safeguards measures will be achieved in line with the provisions stated in the \nPAM.12 Social safeguards plan implementation, monitoring, and reporting; the grievance redress \nmechanism; and the compliance review procedure established for the current project will remain \nunchanged and will also be applicable to the additional financing. PMD submits social safeguard \nmonitoring reports to ADB and these are reviewed and disclosed in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. PMD is satisfactorily implementing all safeguards requirements, and \nsocial safeguard implementation issues arising during implementation  are being addressed \neffectively. The inputs of the safeguard and social development support consultant in project \nmanagement consultancy will continue to (i) build capacity of the PMD and relevant stakeholders; \n(ii) support the PMD in the finalization of the updated RIPP following completion of the remaining \ntransmission line surveys; and (iii) ensure that the RIPP is implemented in accordance with social \nand environmental safeguard requirements, and monitor safeguard compliance. \n   \n                                                \n12 Sections VII (safeguards) and VIII (gender and social) of the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nF.
