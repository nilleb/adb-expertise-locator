Building  on  the \nachievements  of  the  Basic  Education  (Girls)  Project  and  the \nEducation Quality Improvement Project 2, the BESDP is consistent \nwith \nthe  Government\u2019s  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan, \nStrategic  Vision  2020,  National  Growth  and  Poverty  Eradication \nStrategy,  and  National  Plan  of  Action  for  Education  for  All  2003\u2013\n2015.  It  is  in  line  with  the  Education  Sector  Development  Plan \n2006\u20132010,  which  highlights  education  development,  particularly \neducation \nreduction  and \nsocioeconomic  development.  The  BESDP  supports  Millennium \nDevelopment  Goals  2  and  3  for  universal  primary  education  and \ngender parity at all levels of school education. \n\nfor  all,  as  central \n\nto  poverty \n\nThe  BESDP  will  have  substantial  positive  social  impact  through \nexpansion  of  basic  education.  The  BESDP  policy  reform  agenda \ntargets  the  poor  through   (i)  improved  resource  mobilization  and \nallocations  to  the  education  sector;  (ii)  increased  access  to \neducation,  especially  for  underserved  areas  and  disadvantaged \ngroups;  (iii)  improved  standards,  quality,  and  internal  efficiency, \nand  consequent  sustainability  in  the  education  sector;  and  (iv) \neffective \neducation \nmanagement. The BESDP will provide scholarships to poor ethnic \nchildren,  particularly  girls.  It  also  provides  for  expansion  and \nimprovement of LSE facilities in underserved, poor, remote areas. \n\ndecentralized \n\ncapacity \n\nbuilding \n\nfor \n\nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide $21.56 equivalent \nto  support  BESDP.  This  constitutes:  (i)  a  program  loan  of  $8.9 \nmillion; and (ii) a project grant of $12.66 million.  \n\nThe  program  loan  will  support  policy  actions  that  contribute  to  (i) \nensuring  increased  resource  mobilization  to  the  education  sector \nincluding  rationalizing  budgetary  allocations  for  education;  (ii) \n\nImportant Features \n\nProgram Financing \n\nThe Program Loan \n\n \n\n   Impact and Outcome \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n    \n\n   Financing Plan \n\n   Program Period and \n   Tranching \n\n   Executing Agency and \n   Implementation \n   Arrangements \n\n   Procurement and \n   Disbursement \n    \n\n \n\ndesigning  and  implementing  an  outcome-oriented  budgeting  and \nfinancial management system that will also lead to preparation of a \nmedium-term expenditure framework for education; (iii) providing a \nmore  relevant  and  integrated  curriculum  for  school  education;  (iv) \nstrengthening  teacher  management  through  preparation  of  a \nrecruitment  and  deployment  plan  and  development  of  a  teacher \nmanagement  information  system;  and  (v)  strengthening  capacity \nfor  decentralized  planning  These  policy  actions  support  expanded \naccess,  equity,  and  quality  of  education;  and  will  strengthen  the \ncapacity of the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the provincial and \ndistrict  bodies  responsible  for  education  administration  to  provide \nmore  effective  decentralized  planning,  management,  financial \nreporting, and budgeting for school education.  \n\nThe  BESDP  provides  the  policy  and  strategic  framework  for \naddressing  capacity-building  concerns  in  a  number  of  areas, \nincluding  (i)  decentralized  education  management,  (ii)  basic \neducation  policy  analysis  and  strategic  planning,  and  (iii)  teacher \nrecruitment and deployment. The overall capacity-building strategy \nof  MOE,  with  ADB  support,  will  be  coordinated  with  other \ndevelopment agencies.  \n\nA  loan  of  $8.9  million  equivalent  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources.  The  term  of  the  loan  will  be  24  years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1% \nper annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter.\n\nThe loan will be utilized over 3 years, from the first quarter of 2007 \nto  April  2010  and  will  be  disbursed  in  three  tranches.  The  first \ntranche of $3.0 million will be released upon program effectiveness \nsubject  to  the  Government\u2019s  fulfillment  of  agreed  conditions.  The \nsecond tranche of $3.0 million will be released 24 months after the \nfirst  tranche  release,  upon  satisfactory  compliance  with  specific \nconditions indicated in the Policy Matrix. The third tranche of $2.9 \nmillion will be released 12 months after the release of the second \ntranche upon satisfactory compliance with conditions stipulated for \nits release. \n\nMOE, the Executing Agency, will be responsible for implementation \nof  the  policy  measures.  A  steering  committee,  established  for  the \nprogram  loan  and  project  grant,  will  be  chaired  by  the  minister  of \neducation,  and  comprise  representatives  from  MOE,  Ministry  of \nFinance,  Committee  for  Planning  and  Investment,  Ministry  of \nForeign  Affairs  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Office  and \nline  agencies \nconcerned  with  MOE.  Other  stakeholder  representatives  may  be \ninvited to attend, as appropriate.  \n\nProgram  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  foreign \nexchange  cost  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member \ncountries, excluding ineligible items and imports financed by other \nbilateral and multilateral sources.  \n\n   Counterpart Funds \n\nThe counterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the program \nloan  will  supplement  the  Government\u2019s  pro-poor  budget,  targeted \n\n\fThe Project Grant \n   Impact and Outcome \n\n \n\niii\n\nat protecting service provision to the poor; and as agreed between \nthe  Government  and  ADB;  protect  allocation  to  the  education \nsector;  and,  in  particular,  alleviate  resource  constraints,  enabling \nthe Government to improve allocations for recurrent expenditures. \n\nThe  Basic  Education  Sector  Development  Project  will  supplement \nthe policy initiatives being supported under the BESDP to enhance \nequitable  access  to  and  quality  of  LSE  by  (i)  expanding  LSE \nopportunities  to  improve  access  and  equity;  (ii)  integrating  the \nbasic  education  curriculum  to  account  for  lower  secondary  school \nexpansion from 3 to 4 grades, and improved quality and relevance \nof LSE; and (iii) building central, provincial, and district capacity in \ncritical  areas \ninformation  system, \nbudgeting and financial management, and planning). Interventions \naimed at expanding physical access will be targeted at sites within \n20 districts identified in 6 provinces (Attapeu, Bokeo, Champasack, \nKhammuane,  Luang  Namtha,  and  Savannakhet).  Measures  to \nimprove  and  support  quality  will  have  larger  subsector  coverage \nand  impact.  The  education  sector  as  a  whole  will  benefit  from \nsome of the key capacity-building inputs. \n\n(education  management \n\n   Financing Plan \n\nA  grant  of  $12.66  million  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds resources.  \n\n   Executing Agencies \n   and Implementation \n   Arrangements \n\nMOE  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  all  the  components  of  the \nProject and be responsible for coordinating overall implementation. \nThe steering committee will be the same as for the program loan. \n\n   Procurement and \n   Disbursement \n    \n\nAll  ADB-financed  goods  and  services  for  the  Project  will  be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April \n2006,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).

A  significant  number  of  the  direct \nbeneficiaries  will  be  the  poor  as  10  of  the  20  program  districts \nwhere  additional  schools  and  classrooms  will  be  provided  are \nclassified poor, of these, 7 are classified as the poorest. Since five \nof  the  six  provinces  to  be  supported  have  a  high  percentage  of \nethnic minority population, a corresponding high percentage of the \ntotal beneficiaries is expected to be from ethnic minorities.  \n\nThe  ultimate  benefit  will  accrue  to  society  through  a  better \neducated  youth  who  will  contribute  to  economic  and  social \ndevelopment  of \nthe  country.  Higher  education  attainment, \nparticularly  among  girls,  provides  significant  benefits  to  society, \nincluding  lower  fertility,  improved  health  and  nutrition  status  of \nfamilies,  reduction  of  gender  disparities  through  a  more  equitable \nintrahousehold  allocation  of \nresources,  and  overall  higher \neducation  attainment  leading  to  intergenerational  economic  and \nsocial benefits for society and the individual.  \n\nLimited leadership and ownership of the policy reform process and \nlack  of  consistency  in  policy  and  strategic  decision-making  pose \npotential  risks.  These  will  be  mitigated  by  (i)  the  extensive \nEducation  Sector  Development  Plan  2006\u20132010  policy  dialogue \nprocess; (ii) the ongoing review and assessment process by senior \nMOE  officials  and  the  Education  Donor  Working  Group,  including \nnongovernment  organizations  to  secure  broad  support  of  the \nreform  agenda;  (iii)  the  annual  BESDP  review  process,  which  will \nfacilitate  a  phased  and  sequenced  approach \nto  policy \nimplementation;  and  (iv)  advisory  support  from  ADB  and  other \ndevelopment  agencies  for  ongoing  policy  studies  and  related \nlegislative and regulatory reforms. \n\nLimitations  in  tax  recovery,  uncertainties  in  future  aid  agency \nfunding  and  unforeseen  developments  pose  potential  risks  that \nthe  predictability  of  Government  resources \nmay  undermine \navailable  for  education, especially  the  significant  transitional  costs \nassociated with the policy reforms, including salary increases. This \npotential  risk  will  be  mitigated  through  (i)  extensive  dialogue \nbetween  MOE  and  funding  agencies  within  the  Education  Donors \nWorking  Group  on  the  availability  of  medium-term  resources  for \neducation, (ii) using the medium-term expenditure forecast process \nas a basis for identifying potential budget shortfalls and mobilizing \nincreased  sector  budget  support,  (iii)  extensive  sector  efficiency \nmeasures  to  contain  expenditure  growth,  and  (iv)  strong  policy \nfinancial \nlinkage  with \n\nthe  Government\u2019s  broader  public \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nmanagement reforms. \n\nMOE\u2019s  limited  capacity  to  manage  and  implement  the  revised \npolicies and strategies is a potential risk. While technical personnel \nwill  implement  the  Project  based  on  the  provincial  and  district \ndecentralization  policy,  these  risks  will  be  mitigated  through  (i) \nprovision of extensive advisory support for subsector and program \nplanning and management, and (ii) technical assistance to ensure \nthat an appropriate legislative and regulatory framework is in place. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f102  00'Eo\n\n106  00'Eo\n\nPEOPLE'S\n REPUBLIC  OF\nCHINA\n\nGnot-Ou\n\nLAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC\nBASIC EDUCATION SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM\n\nBoun Nua\n\nPhongsali\n\nPHONGSALI\n\nSamphan\n\nMai\n\nSing\n\nBoun Tai\n\nLouang-Namtha\n\nLong\n\nLOUANGNAMTHA\n\nNamo\n\nKhoa\n\nLa\n\nViangphoukha\n\nXai\n\nNambak\n\nNgoy\n\nNale\n\nOUDOMXAI\n\nViangkham\n\nM Y A N M A R\nM ekong River\n\nMeung\nBOKEO\n\nTonpheung\n\nXiangkho\n\nSopbao\n\nXam-Nua\n\nHouayxay\n\nBeng\n\nPha-Oudom\n\nLOUANGPHRABANG\n\nNga\n\nHouamuang\n\n20  00'No\n\nHoun\n\nChomphet\n\nPak-Ou\n\nPakxeng\n\nPhonxai\n\nEt\n\nViangxai\n\nHOUAPHAN\n\nXam-Tai\n\nPaktha\n\nPakbeng\n\nXianghon\n\nKhop\n\nNgeun\n\nHongsa\n\nPhoukhoun\n\nXaignabouri\n\nNan\n\nPhiang\n\nKasi\n\nXAIGNABOURI\n\nMet\n\nFuang\n\nVangviang\n\nKeo-Oudom\nHinheup\n\nThongmixai\n\nPhonhong\n\nLouangphrabang\n\nXiang-Ngeun\n\nKham\n\nPhoukout\n\nPhaxai\n\nVIENTIANE\n\nXaisomboun\n\nPek\n\nNonghet\n\nKhoun\nMok-Mai \nXIANGKHOUANG\n\nThathom\n\nVIET  NAM\n\nLongxan\n\nBorikhan\n\nThaphabat\n\nThourakhom\n\nPakxan\n\nBORIKHAMXAI\nViangthong\n\nPakkading\n\nKhamkeut\n\nPaklai\n\nSangthong\n\nNaxaythong\nXaithani\n\nSikhottabong\n\nVIENTIANE\nMUNICIPAL\n\nVIENTIANE\n\nPak-Ngum\n\nChanthabouri\nHatxaifong\n\nSisattanak\n\nXanakham\n\nBoten\n\nKenthao\n\nTHAILAND\n\n20  00'No\n\nGulf   of   Tonkin\n\nHinboun\n\nNakay\nKHAMMOUAN\n\nGnommalat\n\nM\n\ne\n\nk\n\no\n\nn\n\ng Riv\n\ne\n\nr\n\nThakhek\n\nNongbok\n\nMahaxai\n\nBoualapha\n\nXebangfai\n\nXaibouathong\n\nAtsaphon\n\nVilabouri\n\nXaibouri\n\nOuthoumphon\n\nAtsaphangthong\n\nXepon\n\nPhalanxai\n\nKhanthabouri\n\nChamphon\n\nXonbouri\n\nSAVANNAKHET\n\nPhin\n\nNong\n\nThapangthong\n\nTa-Oy\nToumlan\n\n16  00'No\n\nLakhonpheng\n\nVapi\n\nSaravan\n\nKhongxedon\n\nSARAVAN\n\nKarum\n\nXEKONG\n\nThateng\n\nXanasomboun\n\nLaongam\n\nLaman\n\nDakchung\n\nBachiangchareunsouk\n\nPhonthong\n\nChampasak\n\nSoukhouma\n\nPakxe\n\nPakxong\n\nPathoumphon\n\nSanxai\n\nXaisettha\nSamakkhixai\n\nCHAMPASAK\n\nSanamxai\n\nATTAPU\nPhouvong\n\nCAMBODIA\n\n106  00'Eo\n\n06-2049 HR\n\nN\n\nKilometers\n\nProject Province\n\nNational Capital\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nNational Road\n\nPaved Provincial Road\n\nRiver\n\nDistrict Boundary\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\n102  00'Eo\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\nMounlapamok\n\nKhong\n\n16  00'No\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\nXaiphouthong\n\nSongkhon\n\nSamouay\n\n\f \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nprogram loan, and (ii) a proposed project grant, both to the Lao People's Democratic Republic \n(Lao  PDR)  for  the  Basic  Education  Sector  Development  Program  (BESDP).  The  program \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n\nII. \n\nTHE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\n2. \nThe Government of the Lao PDR accords high priority to education and recognizes that \neducation and literacy are prerequisites for sustained economic growth and poverty reduction. \nThis  is  emphasized  in  all  major  planning  documents  that  provide  a  vision  for  national \ndevelopment.  The  Government  adopted  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  in  2000  and  has \narticulated,  in  some  detail,  its  vision,  aspirations,  and  goals  for  education  development  in  a \nseries of subsequent documents, which include (i) the Sixth Socio-Economic Development Plan, \n(ii) Education Sector Development Plan 2006\u20132010, (iii) Education Strategic Vision to 2020, and \n(iv) National Plan of Action for Education for All (EFA Plan).  \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  key  goals  and  aspirations  for  education  include  (i)  universal  quality \n3. \nprimary  education  and  continued  lower  secondary  expansion;  (ii)  eradication  of  illiteracy;  (iii) \nexpansion of vocational, technical, and higher education to meet the demands of the new labor \nmarket and improve human capital rates of return; (iv) capacity development of skilled workers, \ntechnicians,  professionals,  and  intellectuals  to  use  modern  science  and  technology  to  serve \ndevelopment needs; (v) gradual improvement of the quality of national education to international \nstandards; and (vi) establishment of education as a right and responsibility of all citizens. \n\nThe Government\u2019s strategy for strengthening education includes improving (i) access to \n4. \neducation, particularly in remote areas; (ii) school participation and completion rates; and (iii) the \nquality  of  teaching  and  learning.  The  Government\u2019s  priority  has  been  directed  to  ensuring \nequitable access to quality basic education (primary and lower secondary education [LSE]), to \nproduce  quality  and  trainable  students  for  further  education  and  training.  The  EFA  Plan  is  the \nkey document guiding the Government\u2019s education development strategy and helping it fulfill its \ncommitment to achieving universal primary education. \n \nThe current education system comprises primary (grades 1\u20135), lower secondary (grades \n5. \n6\u20138), and upper secondary (grades 9-11); and beyond, fall within the ambit of tertiary education. \nTo improve the efficiency of the education sector, the Government proposes to restructure the \nsector to (i) introduce a year of kindergarten, (ii) extend LSE by including grade 9 (grades 6\u20139); \nand (iii) extend upper secondary education to include grade 12 (grades 10\u201312). The introduction \nof  kindergarten  will  rationalize  enrolments  in  grade  1,  and  restructuring  lower  and  upper \nsecondary education will bring it in line with prevailing international norms of a 12-year school \ncycle.  \n \n6. \nSince  1990,  the  Government  has  made  considerable  progress  in  improving  access  to \neducation, particularly in primary education. Between 1990 and 2005, the net enrollment ratio1 \n(NER) for primary education increased by more than 16% from 63% to approximately 79%. The \n\n                                                 \n1   NER refers to pupils enrolled from the eligible age group. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ngross  enrollment  ratio2 increased  from  30%  in  1990  to  51%  in  2005  for  lower  secondary,  and \nfrom  26.3%  in  2003  to  31%  in  2005  for  upper  secondary.  With  more  than  an  8%  increase \nannually, the number of secondary students has been growing at four times the rate of primary \nschool students.  \n\n7. \nGirls\u2019  enrollment  has  also  shown  rapid  progress.  Gender  differentials  in  primary \nenrollment  have  dropped  by  7.4%  since  1996  (from  21.6%  to  14.2%).  Girls\u2019  secondary \nenrollment increased by more than 4% between 2003 and 2005 compared with a 1.9% increase \nfor  boys.  During  the  same  period,  girls\u2019  upper  secondary  enrollment  increased  by  4.4% \ncompared with a 5.1% increase for boys. Even so, significant gender differentials remain: girls\u2019 \nprimary enrollment lags boys\u2019 by approximately 14% and girls\u2019 secondary enrollment lags boys\u2019 \nby more than 12%.  \n\n8. \nExtensive  funding  agency  support,  almost  all  concentrating  on  the  primary  education, \nhas fueled the primary expansion. Expanding primary enrollments have led to growing demand \nfor  secondary  education.  During  1990\u20132005,  LSE  expanded  by  more  than  20%.  Upper \nsecondary  enrollments  increased  more  than  4.5%  between  2003  and  2005.  Though  overall \nlower  and  upper  secondary  enrollments  are  low,  both  are  registering  high  rates  of  growth.  If \nprimary education absorbs all external funding, subsequent levels of education will continue to \nbe  neglected.  This  will create  an  imbalance  in  the  education  sector  with  serious  ramifications. \nFirst, the gains from increased primary enrollments will be lost if the lower secondary and upper \nsecondary subsectors are not ready to absorb the primary school graduates who may want to \npursue further schooling. Second, quality and access issues become much more of a challenge \nwith increasing numbers of students. Expansion in enrollment has not been complemented by \ncorresponding improvements in quality, and the internal efficiency of education remains weak. \n\n9. \nIn  keeping  with  educational  trends  in  developing  economies,  demand  for  education \nwithin all education subsectors will continue to grow rapidly. The Education Sector Development \nPlan identifies targets for each education subsector that are linked to expansion of enrollment \nas well as improved efficiencies within the system. The main challenges in the education sector \nare to (i) meet the growing demand for education; (ii) address issues of access and equity, and \n(iii)  improve  the  internal  efficiency  of  the  system.  However,  resource  constraints  and  weak \ncapacity  limit  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to  provide  the  inputs  necessary  for  achieving  its \nquantitative and qualitative goals for education development.   \n \nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n10. \nAn analysis of the performance of the education system and identification of key issues \nhighlights, among others, (i) unequal participation in schooling because of social, economic, and \ngeographic  disparities;  and  (ii)  low  internal  efficiency  reflected  by  high  dropout  and  repetition \nrates, and low learning outcomes.  \n\n1. \n\nAccess and Equity \n\nDespite  rapid  enrollment  growth,  universal  access  at  primary  schools  remains  a  major \n11. \nchallenge. Approximately 23% of primary school-age children are not enrolled in school. Among \nthose who do enroll, over 8% drop out. National enrollment statistics hide disparities that exist in \naccess by geographic region, socioeconomic status, gender, and ethnicity at all levels of school \neducation.  Access  to  schooling  in  remote  rural  regions  continues  to  be  limited  compared  with \naccess in urban, better-developed areas. For example, Luang Namtha Province has the lowest \n                                                 \n2   The gross enrollment ratio refers to total pupils enrolled. \n\n \n\n\fprimary NER for girls at 43% and boys at 48.6%. By comparison, Vientiane City has the highest \nNER  of  95%  for  girls  and  92%  for  boys.  Although  enrollments  among  the  disadvantaged  and \npoorer groups are growing at a faster rate than enrollments among the more advantaged groups, \nthe  percentage  of  poorer  children  who  continue  to  be  out  of  school  is  still  greater  than  the \npercentage of children from economically better-off groups. \n\n12. \nPhysical access remains a major barrier. Approximately 15% of villages are still without \na primary school within commutable distance.3 Approximately 70% of the schools in the poorest \ndistricts are incomplete schools, only offering classes up to grade 2 or 3. Fifty-seven percent of \nall primary schools and an estimated 70%\u201380% of schools in the poorest districts do not offer \nthe  full  five  grades  of  primary  education.  Low  population  density  and  remoteness  make \nprovision  of  cost-effective  and  sustainable  education  services  difficult  in  remote  rural  areas. \nThus,  children  in  the  poorest  areas,  particularly  girls  and  ethnic  groups,  are  distinctly \ndisadvantaged in terms of limited access to education.  \n\n13. \nEnrollment  statistics  reflect  the  impact  of  gender-differentiated  access.  The  NER  in \nprimary schools for girls is 49% in rural areas without access to roads, 72.2% in rural areas with \naccess  to  roads,  and  90.5%  in  urban  areas.  Corresponding  statistics  for  boys  are  56%,  75%, \nand 88%. Substantial gender disparities persist in rural areas, where girls\u2019 enrollment is growing \nat a much slower rate than that of boys. Primary completion rates are also lower for girls at 48% \ncompared  with  52%  for  boys.  This  gap  persists  in  enrollments  into  entry  grades  at  lower  and \nupper secondary. Predictably, transition rates are higher in urban, nonpoor areas as compared \nwith the poorer areas, though the gap is narrowing rapidly.  \n\nIn  the  case  of  lower  and  upper  secondary  education,  rapid  expansion  has  not  been \n14. \nmatched by increased availability of schools with adequate facilities or qualified teachers. The \ndemand for additional secondary space has been met by overcrowding in the classrooms or by \nuse  of  derelict,  abandoned  school  buildings  that  were  replaced  by  new  buildings  provided \nthrough  externally  funded  projects  or  by  poaching  space  of  nearby  primary  schools.  This  has \nresulted  in  a  shortage  of  primary  teachers  and  overcrowded,  poorly  equipped  primary \nclassrooms.  The  result  for  secondary  schools  is  inadequately  qualified  teachers,  increasing \nclass sizes, and shortage of classrooms. This has multiple negative impacts on quality. \n\n2. \n\nQuality \n\n15. \nQuality is a function of internal systemic efficiencies. The Lao National Literacy Survey \nfound that primary education does not ensure the acquisition of basic literacy. Just over 50% of \nprimary  graduates  (grade  5  completers)  attain  basic  literacy.  Similarly,  only  38%  of  nonformal \neducation  level  III  completers  (equivalent  to  primary  graduates)  attain  basic  literacy.  Internal \nefficiency of the education system has been improving since 1995/96, with a significant decline \nin repetition rates for all grades, especially grade 5. However, repetition and dropout rates are \nstill high in grades 1 and 2. About 33% of students in primary school repeat grade 1 and another \n19% repeat grade 2.4 Completion rates for primary education are estimated at 48% for females \nand  52%  for  males.  Repetition  rates  vary  across  poverty  levels.  High  repetition  and  dropout \nrates,  particularly  for  the  lower  grades,  and  an  average  of  8  years  to  complete  primary \neducation  are  indicators  of  low  internal  efficiency  and  poor  quality  of  education.  Internal \nefficiency improves after grade 4 with repetition and dropout rates declining, and improves again \n\n                                                 \n3   The internationally recommended norm for \u201ccommutable distance\u201d for primary school is 1 kilometer from the place \n\nof habitation; no corresponding norms are available for lower and upper secondary schools.  \n\n4   This is partly a consequence of over enrollment in the lower grades where older children tend to bring their younger \nsiblings to school. The Government proposes to address this problem by adding a preparatory kindergarten year.  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nfor  secondary  education  with  low  dropout  and  repetition  rates.  However,  rapid  expansion \nwithout  adequate  emphasis  on  strengthening  quality  will  cause  efficiency  declines.  Factors \ncontributing to poor quality of education are (i) lack of adequate supply of qualified teachers; (ii) \nshortage of textbooks and other learning materials; (iii) curriculum deficiencies; (iv) low recurrent \nexpenditures;  and  (v)  weak  institutional  capacity  for  planning,  management,  and  delivery  of \neducation. \n\n16. \nRapid  expansion  of  postprimary  education  under  severe  financial  constraints  has  also \nhad a negative impact on its quality. Average class sizes have grown, especially in grades 9\u201311, \nwhere  the  national  average  reached  81  pupils  per  class  in  2004/05.  Large  class  size  is  a \nconsequence of (i) shortage of teachers; and (ii) inadequate physical facilities to accommodate \nthe  larger  number,  leading  to  overcrowding  in  limited  classroom  space.  The  demand  for \nadditional  secondary  teachers  has  been  partly  met  by  transference  of  primary  teachers  to \nsecondary  schools.  This  has  led  to  underqualified  teachers  at  secondary  schools  and  larger \nprimary  class  sizes.  Teacher  training  is  being  addressed  through  funding  agency  support  and \nthe Government has prepared a teacher education strategy and action plan.5 However, a policy \nframework for teacher recruitment and deployment to ensure the supply of qualified teachers is \nstill lacking.  \n\n17. \nLack  of  adequate  provision  of  textbooks  and  learning  materials  is  also  a  major \ncontributor  to  weak  quality.  Most  schools  have  insufficient  textbooks  and  few,  if  any,  learning \nmaterials or teacher guides. In fact, limited availability of books in primary and lower secondary \nschools is the most commonly cited problem for Lao schools. An education sector analysis is in \nAppendix  2.  A  problem  analysis  of  the  lower  secondary  education  subsector  is  provided  in \nAppendix 3. \n\n3. \n\nFinances \n\nResource allocations for education declined sharply in 1997 from 15% of the budget to a \n18. \nlow of 8%. The Government has agreed to raise the allocation to 16% by 2010 taking education \nexpenditures to over 3% of gross domestic product (GDP), from its current 2.5%. This would be \nin line with expenditures of other developing countries. Funding agencies contribute, on average, \napproximately 75% of capital investments in education. These investments create a demand for \nrecurrent  expenditures  that  the  Government  has  not  been  able  to  meet,  thus  creating  an \nimbalance in the ratio of capital and recurrent expenditures. While most countries in the region \nassign about 70% of their education budget to recurrent expenditures, the recurrent share in the \nLao  PDR  is  little  more  than  40%.  The  average  salary  of  a  primary  teacher  amounts  to  0.65% \nGDP/capita  compared  with  a  regional  average  of  2.0\u20132.5  GDP/capita.  Continued  capital \ninvestments  without  matching  provision  for  recurrent  costs  are  likely  to  result  in  expanding \naccess through increased supply of schools but with chronic shortage of recurrent resources for \nteachers\u2019  salaries  and  provision  of  textbooks,  teaching-learning  materials,  and  other  school \nsupplies. This imbalance between the recurrent and capital expenditures needs to be corrected \nand a more sustainable ratio obtained (70:30).  \n\nAlthough \n\nthe  Government  specifies  budget  guidelines,  recent  developments \n\nin \n19. \ndecentralization mean that final decisions now rest with provincial governors, who may allocate \ntheir budget according to their perceived needs and priorities. Over the last 3 years, the share of \nprovincial  budgets  allocated  to  education  has  varied  from  a  low  of  5%  to  a  high  of  25%. \nVariations  in  this  share  are  mostly  determined  by  the  share  of  provincial  investments  for \n                                                 \n5   Prepared with assistance from Swedish International Development Agency  and under submission for approval by \n\nPrime Minister's Office/National Assembly. \n\n \n\n\feducation,  which  is  limited.  Conversely,  the  share  of  the  provincial  recurrent  budget  going  to \neducation averages 25%\u201330%, due to the high number of staff employed in education. Central \nagencies lack appropriate information systems to monitor and control provincial budgeting and \ndisbursement  and  the  Ministry  of  Education  (MOE)  cannot  track  provincial  expenditures  to \ndetermine actual expenditures on education. Moreover, decentralization makes limited provision \nfor  the  redistribution  of  resources,  and  this  disadvantages  poor  provinces  that  have  resource \nconstraints and are unable to provide adequate funding for education. Decentralization should \nbe  reassessed  and  undertaken  at  a  pace  compatible  with  stable  resource  availability,  local \nimplementation capacities, and MOE\u2019s monitoring capacity. \n\n4. \n\nGovernment Objectives and Strategic Priorities \n\nThe  Government  bases  its  current  strategies  for  education  development  on  the  three \n20. \nbroad  principles  of  increased  equitable  access,  improved  quality  and  relevance,  and \nstrengthened decentralized management The EFA Plan, adopted in December 2004, provides \nthe  framework  for  education  development  and  considers  six  dimensions  for  intervention:  (i) \nexpansion  of  early  childhood  care  and  development  activities,  including  family  and  community \ninterventions; (ii) universal access to and completion of primary education; (iii) improvement in \nlearning  achievement;  (iv)  reduction  of  adult  illiteracy;  (v)  expansion  of  basic  education  and \ntraining  in  essential  skills  required  by  youths  and  adults;  and  (vi)  increased  acquisition  by \nindividuals and families of the knowledge, skills, and values required for better living and sound \nand sustainable development.  \n\n21.  Within  the  Education  for  All  framework,  the  Government  hopes  to  improve  the  quality \nand  relevance  of  basic  education  by  (i)  improving  management  of  the  delivery  of  teacher \neducation;  (ii)  developing  a  comprehensive  but  flexible  teacher  training  curriculum;  (iii) \nenhancing  competencies  of  all  teacher  trainers  through  a  training  of  trainers  program;  (iv) \nincreasing the recruitment and rate of retention of teachers, and improving their status through \nincentives;  (v)  improving  the  quality  of  preservice  teacher  training;  (vi)  providing  learning \nmaterials  and  adapting  them  to  local  conditions;  and  (vii)  improving  student  assessment \nsystems. While these bear testimony to the Government\u2019s commitment to basic education, the \nGovernment\u2019s  ability  to  achieve  the  goals  is  likely  to  be  severely  constrained  by  lack  of \nadequate  resources.  Dependence  on  external  assistance  is  likely  to  remain  high.  The \nGovernment  is  also  increasingly  aware  of  the  need  to  ensure  that  the  focus  on  primary \neducation does not lead to unmanageable neglect of secondary education.  \n\nSince  2002,  MOE  has  been  working  with  funding  agencies,  particularly  the  Swedish \n22. \nInternational  Development  Agency,  to  develop  a  sector-wide  approach  (SWAp). 6  However, \nMOE  has  expressed  reservations  about  its  readiness  to  move  to  a  SWAp  partly  because  it  is \nconstrained  by  weak  capacity  for  planning,  budgeting,  and  management  of  education.  The \nBESDP will provide support to develop capacity in key areas to address some of the constraints. \nHowever, a more thorough assessment of institutional and management capacity will still need \nto be undertaken before a SWAp can be adopted. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will help \nthe  Government,  through  an  advisory  technical  assistance,  to  prepare  a  sector  development \nframework for the education sector. For sector planning to be a viable strategy, predictability of \nresources  is  necessary.  Thus,  assured  budgetary  allocations,  adequate  provision  of  recurrent \n\n                                                 \n6   The  sector-wide  approach  defines  a  method  of  working  between  government  and  development  partners,  a \nmechanism  for  coordinating  support  to  public  expenditure  programs  and  for  improving  the  efficiency  and \neffectiveness  with  which resources  are  used in the sector.

Manila. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nexpenditures,  and  longer  term  financial  commitment  to  education  by  MOE\u2019s  development \npartners are essential to education sector development.  \n \n\n5. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n23. \nThe education sector receives substantial external support, a high proportion directed to \nsupport  for  primary  education.  This  reflects  the  emphasis  on  Education  for  All  and  Millennium \nDevelopment Goal 2 of achieving universal primary education.  \n\n24. \nADB\u2019s  support  for  the  education  sector  in  the  LAO  PDR  began  in  1991  with  the  first \nEducation  Quality  Improvement  Project.7 In  1995,  ADB  provided  a  loan  to  revive  the  higher \neducation  system,  through  establishment  of  the  National  University  of  Laos. 8 ADB\u2019s  project \ncompletion reviews concluded that these projects were highly or generally successful. In 2000, \nADB  approved  the  Basic  Education  (Girls)  Project  to  improve  access  for  girls  to  primary \neducation. 9 Based  on  a  comprehensive  sector  study  that  provided  a  policy  and  investment \nframework  for  2001\u20132005, 10  ADB  provided  a  loan  for  the  Second  Education  Quality \nImprovement  Project  in  2001, 11  which  focused  on  expanding  access  to  and  improving  the \nquality of primary education. Both these projects are ongoing.  \n\n25. \nSeveral international and bilateral agencies and nongovernment organizations have also \nsupported various aspects of primary education. The World Bank provided support through two \neducation  development  projects  in  1993  and  2004.  The  Government  of  Sweden  financed  the \nTeacher  Training  Enhancement  and  Status  of  Teachers  Project,  which  produced  the  National \nTeacher  Education  Action  Plan.  The  Government  of  Japan  has  provided  grant  assistance  for \nteacher  training  and  primary  school  construction.  The  Government  of  Australia  has  provided \ngrants  for  in-service  and  preservice  training  for  ethnic  teachers,  and  development  of \nsupplementary  learning  materials.  The  United  Nations  Children\u2019s\u2019  Fund  helped  develop  a \nframework  for  upgrading  teacher  competencies  and  the  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific \nand  Cultural  Organization  has  assisted  MOE  in  producing  the  EFA  Plan,12 which  provides  a \ncommon  framework  for  future  assistance  to  basic  education.  Countries  such  as  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China,  France,  Germany,  Japan,  and  Republic  of  Korea  have  provided  significant \nresources  to  support  technical  and  vocational  education  and  training,  and  tertiary  education. \nHowever,  the  lower  and  upper  secondary  subsectors  have  not  received  any  external  support. \nWhen external assistance is concentrated in specific subsectors, scarce national financial and \npersonnel  resources  also  get  directed  to  those  subsectors  to  meet  the  additional  demands \narising  from  expansion  of  enrollment  and  related  activities,  exacerbating  imbalances  in \nallocation of resources. Thus, lower and upper secondary subsectors have been neglected due \nto  the  concentration  of  resources  in  primary  education.  Details  of  external  assistance  and \nfunding  agency  coordination  are  provided  in  Appendix  4.  Details  of  funding  agency  support \nbased on a survey conducted during BESDP preparation is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n\n                                                 \n7   ADB.  2000.

Vientiane. \n\n \n\n\fConcentration  of  external  assistance  in  primary  education  has  resulted  in  expanded \n26. \nprimary  enrollment.  This,  in  turn,  has  led  to  a  growing  demand  for  LSE  and  upper  secondary \neducation. The BESDP extends support to LSE to meet this growing demand and related issues. \nWhile selection of the geographic area for coverage is based on criteria specific to the needs of \nLSE,  it  builds  on  the  systemic  interventions  provided  under  the  Second  Education  Quality \nImprovement  Project  II  and  Basic  Education  (Girls)  Project.  These  include  strengthening  (i) \nteacher training institutions; (ii) capacity for more comprehensive data collection, management, \nand  analysis;  and  (iii)  decentralization  of  education  planning,  management,  and  delivery.  The \nBESDP  is  also  designed  within  the  agreed  EFA  Plan  framework  and  will  support  the \nGovernment\u2019s  aim  to  move  to  a  SWAp  process  by  supporting  policy  reforms  and  systemic \ninterventions that will strengthen the school sector as a whole, while at the same time focusing \nmost of the interventions on improving equitable access to and quality of LSE.  \n\n6. \n\nLessons  \n\n27. \nExtensive funding agency support has provided useful experience and important lessons \nthat should guide resource allocation to the sector. The design of the BESDP takes into account \nthe  experience  gained  and  lessons  emerging  from  previous  interventions.  Some  of  the  key \nlessons are (i) concentration of external assistance to primary education has led to high demand \nfor  secondary  education  that  has  not  been  matched  by  resource  allocation;  (ii)  targeted \ninterventions  have  placed  a  disproportionate  implementation  burden  on  some  provinces;  (iii) \nheavy externally funded capital expenditures have not been matched by adequate provision of \nrecurrent  expenditures  to  support  teacher  development  and  administration,  provision  of \ntextbooks,  education  management,  etc;  (iv)  MOE  capacity  for  implementation  is  strained,  and \nimplementation  structures  for  various  projects  need  to  be  integrated  and  harmonized;  (v) \ninadequate  MOE  data  systems  have  hindered  planning;  (vi)  targeted  interventions  are \nnecessary  to  increase  participation  by  the  poorest  students,  particularly  girls;  (vii)  civil  works \nneed  adequate  supervision;  and  (viii)  adequate  technical  assistance  must  be  provided  to \ncompensate  for  and  strengthen  MOE\u2019s  limited  capacity  to  undertake  project-related  activities. \nSupplementary  Appendix  B  details  the  lessons  identified  from  past  experience  and  their \nincorporation in the BESDP design. \n\nto  avoid  piecemeal  efforts, \n\nADB\u2019s  country  assistance  program  evaluation 13  found  past  ADB  assistance  to  the \n28. \neducation  sector  to  be  relevant  and  efficient,  and  institutional  development  and  other  impacts \nwere  considered  significant.  However,  it  recommends  greater  coherence  in  funding  agency \ncoordination \nfor  recurrent \nexpenditure, and a shift to a SWAp. It also recommends (i) provision of textbooks as a priority, \n(ii) consolidation of achievements under ongoing projects to improve quality of basic education \nand access for girls and ethnic children; (iii) active involvement of the executing agency during \nthe  design  phase  to  build  ownership;  and  (iv)  integration  of  project  implementation  units  in \nregular MOE operations to build capacity.

ADB\u2019s  education  policy,  while  emphasizing  support  for  basic \neducation,  provides  for  support  for  the  education  sector  based  on  country-specific  needs. \nHowever,  as  mandated  by  the  Government  poverty  reduction  strategy  and  educational  goals, \nADB,  like  other  external  agencies,  has  been  allocating  most  of  its  resources  to  primary \neducation through project loans. Although fully cognizant of the urgent need to strengthen the \nprimary  education  system,  the  Government  is  also  concerned  with  the  need  for  a  minimum \nbalance in sector development and gradual expansion of access to higher education to meet the \ndemand for greater educational attainment. The BESDP will support the Government to make a \ngradual shift to expanding access to and development of LSE. As education expands, a more \ncomprehensive  approach  for  developing  the  school  sector  will  need  to  be  considered.  The \nBESDP  is  also  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  draft  country  strategy  and  program  (2007\u20132011)  for  the \nLao  PDR,  which  supports  the  Government\u2019s  Education  Sector  Development  Plan  2006\u20132010 \nand  prioritizes  agriculture,  education,  health,  and  infrastructure  as  key  sectors  for  expanding \neconomic opportunities and social development.  \n\n30. \nThe BESDP is designed as a sector development program. In addition to supporting the \ninvestment needs in the education sector, it will facilitate policy reforms in key areas to support \nmore efficient planning, management, and delivery of education. Major benefits will include (i) a \nframework  for  planning  and  budgeting,  including  a  medium-term  expenditure  framework  for \neducation;  and  (ii)  a  policy  framework  for  recruitment  and  deployment  of  teachers.  It  will  also \nprotect allocations for education and promote rationalization of recurrent costs vis-\u00e0-vis capital \nexpenditures in the sector. Through its policy reform interventions, the BESDP supports MOE\u2019s \ninitiative to establish a broad-based education sector development framework.  \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  overall  objective  of  the  BESDP  is  to  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  through \n31. \nimproved  access,  equity,  and  quality  of  education  resulting  in  higher  educational  attainment \nleading to enhanced productivity, competitiveness, and economic development. The BESDP will \nsupport  the  long-term  goal  of  education  reform,  and  in  the  immediate  term,  access  to  and \ndevelopment of basic education. It is designed to support the Government to achieve its goal of \nimproving  access,  equity,  and  efficiency  in  basic  education,  particularly  LSE.  This  will  be \nachieved  through  (i)  increased  access  to  and  participation  in  basic  education  in  underserved, \npoor areas as well as through targeted support to disadvantaged groups, and in areas of high \ndemand;  (ii)  improved  quality,  internal  efficiency,  and  relevance  of  basic  education  to  support \nsustainability  of  reforms  in  the  education  sector;  and  (iii)  effective  capacity  building  for \nstrengthened  decentralized  education  planning  and  management.  The  program  and  project \ngrants complement each other to enable progress to achieving these key sector objectives. \n\n32. \nOver  the  past  5  years,  the  Government  has  realized  some  significant  achievements  in \neducation sector reform and long-term sector development strategy, based on extensive policy \nand  strategic  dialogue  with  multilateral 15  and  bilateral 16  development  partners,  and  other \nstakeholders.  MOE  aims  to  move  to  an  education  sector  development  framework  to  ensure  a \nbalanced approach to education sector development. However, this transition to broader sector \ndevelopment  requires  secure  budgetary  allocations  for  education;  policy  and  institutional \n\n                                                 \n15  Asian  Development  Bank,  European  Commission,  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  United  Nations \nEducational,  Scientific  and  Cultural  Organization,  United  Nations  Children's  Fund,  World  Bank,  and  World  Food \nProgram. \n\n16  Australia, France, Germany, Japan, and Sweden. \n\n \n\n\freforms;  and  strengthened  capacity  for  more  effective  decentralized  planning,  management, \nfinancial reporting, and budgeting for the school sector. \n\nB. \n\nImportant Features \n\n33. \nThe  BESDP  is  the  first  intervention  in  the  Lao  PDR  aimed  at  LSE.  It  is  also  the  first \nprogram to provide much needed support to the Government in policy areas crucial to moving \nthe  education  sector  forward  to  more  holistic  development.  The  BESDP\u2019s  policy  areas  and \ninvestment project components are mutually complementary and cover a range of educational \npolicies, actions, and system improvements that reinforce one another, and are in line with the \nGovernment\u2019s  long-  and  medium-term  action  plans,  which  are  being  supported  by  various \nmultilateral  and  bilateral  development  partners  (para.  25),  particularly  in  areas  of  curriculum \nrationalization, planning and management, and teacher development. The BESDP interventions \nwill  be  closely  coordinated  with  complementary  interventions  being  provided  by  other \ndevelopment  partners.  For  example,  recognizing  that  MOE  has  developed  a  plan  for  teacher \ntraining with Swedish International Development Agency support, the BESDP will complement \nthis with an action plan for teacher recruitment and deployment. Similarly, World Bank support \nfor  developing  the  education  management  information  system  (EMIS)  will  be  complemented \nwith support for a teacher management information system (TMIS) and a finance management \ninformation system (FMIS).  \n\n34. \nThe BESDP prioritizes rural, underserved areas with 10 of the 20 target districts being \nclassified poor (of these 7 are considered among the poorest). Five of the six targeted provinces \nhave  a  high  percentage  of  ethnic  population,  ranging  from  41%  to  98%;  three  provinces  have \nmore  than  60%.  The  remaining  10  districts  are  in  areas  of  rapid  economic  growth  with  high \ndemand for education. But even in these districts, the BESDP focuses on disadvantaged areas. \nThe  BESDP  also  provides  targeted  support  through  provision  of  scholarships  to  increase \nenrollment  of  girls  and  ethnic  groups  to  promote  greater  equity  in  education.  It  also  targets \nneedy schools and provides education development grants to meet pressing local needs. The \nsummary  of  poverty  reduction  and social  strategy  is  in  Appendix  5  and  the  gender  and  ethnic \ngroups development plan is in Appendix 6. \n \nC. \n\nThe Program Loan \n \n1. \n\nObjectives \n\n \nThe  objective  of  the  program  loan  is  to  support  policy  actions  that  contribute  to  (i) \n35. \nensuring  increased  resource  mobilization  to  the  education  sector  including  rationalizing \nbudgetary allocations for education; (ii) developing a FMIS, and designing and implementing an \noutcome-oriented budgeting and financial management system that will also lead to preparation \nof a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) for education; (iii) providing a more relevant \nand integrated curriculum for school education; (iv) strengthening teacher management through \npreparation of a recruitment and deployment plan and through development of a TMIS; and (v) \nstrengthening  capacity  for  decentralized  planning.  These  policy  actions  support  expanded \naccess, equity, and quality of education; and will strengthen capacity of MOE and the provincial \nand  district  bodies  responsible  for  education  administration  for  more  effective  decentralized \nplanning, management, financial reporting, and budgeting for the school sector.  \n \nThese policy actions directly complement activities supported under the components of \n36. \nthe  project  grant.  The  policy  actions  also  support  broader  sector  goals,  as  agreed  with  the \nGovernment and other development partners. However, only policy areas directly relevant to the \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nBESDP  activities  are  identified  as  conditions  for  tranche  release.  A  matrix  that  details  the \nlinkages between overall program objectives, policy reform to be supported by the program loan, \nthe components of the investment grant, and the proposed technical assistance is provided in \nSupplementary Appendix C. \n \n\n2. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nThe  policy  actions  supported  by  the  BESDP\u2019s  program  loan  serve  the  broader  goal  of \n\n37. \nsector strengthening and support the sustainability of activities under the investment grant.  \n  \n38. \n \n\nExpand Equitable Access to Basic Education. Activities to be supported include:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nGradual  increase  in  education  budgetary  allocations  and  rationalization  of \nrecurrent  and  capital  expenditures.  This  policy  action  (a)  strengthens  national \ncommitment to education by ensuring that budgetary allocations to the education \nsector are stable, predictable, and gradually increasing; and (b) makes provision \nfor recurrent expenditures to ensure sustainability of investments in expansion.  \n\nAdoption of design and process for preparing an education MTEF. An MTEF for \neducation  will  greatly  enhance  the  coherence  of  MOE\u2019s  budgetary  projections \nand provide sound rationale for budgetary allocations for education. \n\nApproval  of  regulations  to  delegate  decision  making  regarding  appropriate \nlocation of new schools and expanding, rehabilitating, or closing existing schools \nto  provincial  and  district  education  authorities.  This  is  necessary  to  enable \nrational  geographic  distribution  of  schools  to  ensure  that  availability  of  physical \nfacilities is needs based and determined by enrollment trends.  \n\nPreparation  of  a  teacher  recruitment  and  deployment  framework  and  action \nplan.17 This  will  (a)  ensure  teacher  supply  complements  expansion  of  facilities, \n(b) improve management of teachers, and (c) contribute to efficiencies in use of \nrecurrent funds.  \n\nDevelopment  of  a  strategy  to  facilitate  private  sector  participation  in  education \nprovision.  This  will  alleviate  pressure  on  the  public  education  system  and  bring \nprivate investment into education.  \n\nAuthorization  of  schools  to  manage  school  development  grants.  This  will  build \nlocal capacity for school management and allow needs-based use of funds.  \n\n(vii)  Guidelines  for  scholarship  selection  criteria  and  procedures  for  students  from \nethnic  groups,  particularly  girls.  This  will  promote  transparency  and  fairness  in \nselecting scholarship beneficiaries to ensure deserving candidates are targeted. \n\n \nImprove the Quality and Relevance of Formal Basic Education. The following policy \n\n39. \nreforms for improving quality and relevance of formal basic education will be supported:  \n \n\n(i) \n\nDevelopment  of  a  rationalized  curriculum  framework  for  grades  1\u201312.  With  the \nextension of the formal school system to 12 years and addition of grade 9 to LSE, \nthe school curriculum will need to be rationalized to meet the norms of a 12-year \nschool cycle.  \n\n                                                 \n17  This  will  complement  the  School  Teacher  Training  Plan  prepared  with  assistance  from  the  Swedish  International \n\nDevelopment Agency.  \n\n \n\n\f(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nRevision  and  approval  of  new  curriculum  for  grades  6\u20139.  The  new  curriculum \nframework  will  necessitate  curriculum  revisions.  Since  BESDP  investment \ninterventions  are  targeted  to  LSE,  revision  and  approval  of  LSE  curriculum  will \nenhance the relevance of LSE. \n\nApproval of new textbooks and teacher guides based on the revised curriculum \nfor grades 6\u20139. This will ensure availability of updated textbooks, teacher guides, \nand learning materials based on the revised curriculum.  \n\n \nStrengthen Education Management. To ensure sustainability of the investments made \n40. \nto  support  expansion  of  access  and  improvements  in  quality,  and  to  enable  the  transition  to \nsector planning, strengthened capacity for planning, management, and delivery of education at \nall levels of government is required. The program loan will support the following:  \n\nGuidelines for data collection, processing, and analysis to support the EMIS. This \nwill  ensure  appropriateness  and  accuracy  of  the  data,  and  its  proper  use  for \neducation planning.  \n\nIntroduction  of  a  national  planning  and  financial  management  system.  This  will \nensure effective and rational planning and budgeting for education.  \n\nPreparation  of  provincial  education  plans  based  on  school  mapping  by  the \nprovincial  education  service  (PES).  This  will  strengthen  decentralized  planning \nand ensure that actual enrollments match school size. \n\nAdoption  of  an  asset  management  system  for  the  education  sector.  This  will \nensure more efficient utilization of MOE assets.  \n\n41. \nThe  policy  framework  of  the  BESDP  is  described  in  the  development  policy  letter \nprovided by the Government (Appendix 7). The critical policy actions related to the three major \nareas  of  reform  in  the  education  sector  are  in  the  core  policy  matrix  (Appendix  8),  which \nspecifies (i) the policy areas and expected outcomes; (ii) time frame for specific actions; and (iii) \nassociated  legislative,  regulatory,  and  governance  measures.  Proposed  policy  actions  are \nphased and sequenced to reflect the progressive and graduated nature of policy development, \napproval, and implementation. Recognizing potential constraints and risks, the investment grant \nprovides  for  technical  assistance  to  assist  the  Government  in  achieving  the  benchmarks \nnecessary for policy formulation and approval. The policy actions will be guided by consultations \nwith  all  stakeholders  and  the  financial  implications  will  be  addressed  through  the  financing \nframework for the education sector.  \n\n \n\n3. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n42. \nADB  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  education  policy  reform  program  by  providing  a \nprogram loan of $8.9 million equivalent from its Special Funds resources. The term of the loan \nwill be 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n\n4. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nProgram  Management.  MOE  will  be \n\n43. \nfor \nimplementation  of  the  policy  measures.  A  steering  committee  will  be  established  for  the \nProgram.  The  steering  committee  will  be  chaired  by  the  minister  of  education,  and  comprise \nrepresentatives from MOE, Ministry of Finance (MOF), Committee for Planning and Investment, \nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, Prime Minister\u2019s Office, and line agencies and departments of MOE. \n\nthe  Executing  Agency \n\nresponsible \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nOther  stakeholder  representatives  may  be  invited  to  attend  as  appropriate.  Specific  working \ngroups, to be established as needed, will monitor the progress on policy development as set out \nin  the  policy  matrix.  MOF  will  maintain  projected  allocations  to  MOE,  as  agreed  in  the  policy \nmatrix, to support education reforms.  \n\n44. \nPeriod of Implementation. The program loan will be implemented over 3 years from the \nfirst quarter of 2007 to the first quarter of 2010. Completion is anticipated in March 2010 and the \nloan closing date is 30 September 2010  \n\n45. \nProcurement and Disbursement. The program loan may be used to finance the foreign \nexchange  cost  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  items \nincluded  in  a  list  of  ineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral \nsources. In accordance with provisions of ADB's Simplification of Disbursement Procedure and \nrelated Requirements for Program Loans, the proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed to \nthe Government as the recipient. The Government will certify that the volume of eligible imports \nexceeds  the  amount  of  ADB\u2019s  projected  disbursements  under  the  program  loan  in  a  given \nperiod. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy \nof the Government\u2018s certification. \n\n46. \nCounterpart  Funds.  The  funds  generated  from  the  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  will \nsupplement  the  Government\u2019s  pro-poor  budget,  targeted  at  protecting  service  provision  to  the \npoor  and  as  agreed  between  the  Government  and  ADB,  protect  allocation  to  the  education \nsector;  and  alleviate  resource  constraints,  enabling  the  Government  to  improve  allocations  for \nrecurrent expenditures.  \n\n47.  Monitoring  and  Tranching.  The  Government,  through  the  steering  committee,  will \nmonitor  the  implementation  of  policy,  legal,  and  institutional  reforms  envisaged  under  the \nBESDP,  and  every  year  the  Government,  ADB,  other  development  partners  active  in  the \neducation sector will review implementation and assess the impact of all reforms in the sector \nas part of joint education sector performance reviews conducted through the Education Donor \nWorking Group (EDWG).  \n\nThe program loan will be released in three tranches. The first tranche of $3.0 million will \n48. \nbe released upon the Government\u2019s fulfillment of agreed conditions and will coincide with grant \neffectiveness. The second $3.0 million will be released 24 months after the release of the first \ntranche  upon  compliance  with  actions  agreed  in  the  policy  matrix.  The  third  tranche  of  $2.9 \nmillion will be released 12 months after the release of the second tranche, or earlier, subject to \nthe Government\u2019s fulfillment of the agreed conditions.  \n\nD.  \n\nThe Project Grant \n\n1. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n49. \nThe Basic Education Sector Development Project will supplement policy initiatives being \nsupported  under  the  BESDP  and  enhance  equitable  access  to  and  quality  of  LSE  through  (i) \ntargeted expansion of LSE opportunities to improve access and equity; (ii) integration of basic \neducation  curriculum  to  account  for  lower  secondary  expansion  from  3  to  4  grades,  and \nimproved quality and relevance of LSE; and (iii) central, provincial, and district capacity building \nin  critical  areas  (EMIS,  budgeting  and  financial  management,  and  planning).  Interventions \naimed  at  expanding  access  and  improving  equity  will  be  targeted  at  sites  within  the  project \ndistricts. Measures to support quality will have larger subsector impact. The education sector as \na whole will benefit from some of the key capacity-building inputs.  \n\n \n\n\f2. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n50. \n\nThe project outputs and supporting activities are as follows: \n\na. \n\nExpand Access for Formal Lower Secondary Education \n\n51.  MOE\u2019s  national  target  is  to  increase  the  transition  rate  from  primary  education  to  LSE \n(grade 5 to grade 6) from 78.0% in 2004/05 (75.5% for females and 80.1% for males) to 82.0% \nin 2009/10 (with the same transition rate for females and males). During 2006\u20132010, based on \nthe projected number of primary graduates, new entrants into grade 6 are likely to increase by \napproximately 11,000 for males and 12,700 for females. During the corresponding period, total \nenrollments in LSE are expected to increase by 31,000 for males and 35,400 for females. In the \nmajority  of  remote  and  poorest  villages,  the  distance  to  and  lack  of  accessibility  to  a  lower \nsecondary school prevents girls and the poorest ethnic pupils from being admitted into LSE. In \naddition,  high  demand  for  LSE  in  urban  areas  has  created  strong  pressure  on  urban  lower \nsecondary  schools.  A  balance  must  therefore  be  found  between  increasing  opportunities  for \ngirls and the poorest ethnic pupils, while responding to sustained demand from nonpoor pupils. \nThe  objective  of  this  component  is  to  (i)  promote  equitable  access  to basic  education  for  girls \nand  ethnic  groups  in  underserved  rural  areas;  and  (ii)  alleviate  pressure  on  existing  school \nfacilities  in  high  growth  provinces  experiencing  rapid  demand  for  LSE  resulting  in  inadequate \nand/or overcrowded classroom space.  \n\n52. \nPromote  Equitable  Access  in  Poor,  Remote,  Underserved  Rural  Areas  for  Girls \nand  Ethnic  Groups.  The  Project  will  provide  (i)  nine  new  school  buildings  consisting  of  27 \nclassrooms, and (ii) approximately 80 additional classrooms in existing lower secondary schools \nto relieve pressure on existing schools. These facilities will be provided in 10 poor underserved \ndistricts that have been carefully selected based on specific criteria. Selection criteria used for \ntargeting  provinces  and  districts  is  provided  in  the  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social \nstrategy. Selection criteria for sites for new schools and additional classrooms are  provided in \nSupplementary Appendix D. \n\n53. \nAlleviate  Pressure  on  Existing  School  Facilities  in  High-Demand,  Rapid-Growth \nAreas.  The Project will provide (i) 19 new school buildings comprising 65 classrooms, and (ii) \napproximately  64  additional  classrooms  in  schools  where  the  average  class  size  exceeds  60 \nstudents. Site selection for these facilities targets poorer villages within 10 high growth, nonpoor \ndistricts. \n\n54. \nProvide  Targeted  Support  to  Poor  Students  and  Needy  Schools.  The  Project  will \nprovide  targeted  support  in  the  form  of  scholarships  to  poor  students,  particularly  girls,  from \nethnic  groups  in  poor  provinces.  Education  development  grants  will  be  provided  to  needy \nschools in 13 provinces, selected in accordance with guidelines prepared during the Appraisal \nMission.  A  committee  with  community  representation,  including  one  female  and  male  student \nrepresentative,  will  be  responsible  for  management  and  use  of  these  grants.  To  the  extent \nfeasible, 40% of committee members will be women. An indicative list of activities and purposes \nfor  which  the  funds  may  be  used,  as  well  as  indicative  guidelines  for  membership  of  the \nmanaging  committees  to  be  established  for  administering  the  grants,  were  prepared  in \nconsultation  with  MOE.  The  targeted  measures  are  expected  to  create  demand  for  LSE \neducation through improved and expanded facilities and the demonstration effect of increased \nenrollments.  Targeted  scholarships  will  alleviate  poverty-related  constraints  for  poor,  ethnic \nstudents,  particularly  girls,  to  pursue  LSE.  The  Project  will  also  support  a  baseline  study  to \nidentify (i) factors inhibiting participation and retention in LSE, (ii) modes of subsidy and nature \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nof  incentives  to  encourage  enrollment,  and  (iii)  issues  specific  to  gender  and  ethnic  groups. \nThus  far,  such  studies  in  the  Lao  PDR  have  focused  on  constraints  to  primary  school \nparticipation. While some of these constraints could generically be applied at lower secondary, \ndifferences would likely be based on geographic distance, poverty, age group of children, value \nplaced  on  higher  levels  of  education,  etc.  Such  information  can  help  in  refining  targeted \nmeasures and expanding equitable access to LSE.  \n\n55. \nThe consolidated output from this component will be (i) 28 new lower secondary schools \nin the 20 targeted districts of the six BESDP provinces; (ii) 144 additional classrooms in existing \nlower  secondary  schools  where  the  average  class  size  is  higher  than  60;  (iii)  scholarships  to \n1,638 students from ethnic groups, of which 50% will be girls; (iv) education development grants \nto 96 needy schools; and (v) 96 established school management committees.  \n\nb. \n\nImprove Quality of Formal Basic Education \n\n56. \nThis  component  will  improve  the  quality  of  formal  education,  especially  LSE,  through \nimprovements to the curriculum, development and provision of textbooks, teacher development, \nand provision of equipment and materials to schools.  \n\n57. \nDevelop  Curriculum. With the expansion of school education to include grade 12 and \nexpansion of LSE from 3 to 4 years, revisions to the curriculum are necessary. The Project will \nsupport (i) a curriculum framework for grades 1\u201312 with curriculum development for LSE grades \n6\u20139;  and  (ii)  upon  the  Government  approval  of  the  addition  of  a  fourth  year  to  LSE,  the \ndevelopment  of  curriculum  guides,  student  learning  outcomes,  and  an  assessment  framework \nfor a 4-year LSE program. Support for a new LSE curriculum will include regional study visits for \nselected  members  of  the  curriculum  development  teams  in  the  areas  of  mathematics  and \nscience; and national workshops with all stakeholders.  \n\nProvide Textbooks and Learning Materials. The Project will support (i) distribution of \n58. \nselected existing lower secondary textbooks and teacher guides to all lower secondary schools \nin 139 districts of the 17 provinces in the country early in the Project to provide an emergency \nsupply  of  current  materials  during  the  years  in  which  new  curriculum  materials  are  being \ndeveloped,  and  (ii)  development  of  new  LSE  textbooks  and  teacher  guides,  and  their \nprocurement and distribution to all lower secondary schools in the 50 districts of the 6 targeted \nBESDP  provinces.18 Development  of  the  main  materials  will  be  supported  by  workshops  to \ndevelop specifications and sample content for selected textbooks and teacher guides. \n\n59. \nTrain  Teachers.  The  Project  will  support  development  of  a  program  for  in-service \nteacher training in the use of the existing textbooks and teacher guides in all 17 provinces and \nin  the  use  of  new  LSE  materials,  including  development  of  in-service  modules  in  all  subject \nareas, training of trainers, and delivery of the in-service training program in all LSE schools of all \ndistricts in the  BESDP targeted provinces.19  \n\n60. \nProvide  Equipment  and  Materials.  The  Project  will  provide  (i)  teacher  education \ninstitutions  with  equipment  for  science  and  computer  laboratories,  and  materials  to  support \nclassroom  teaching  and  learning,  including  sets  of  the  new  lower  secondary  textbooks  and \nteacher  guides,  and  copies  of  the  in-service  modules  developed  for  the  new  lower  secondary \ncurriculum;  (ii)  a  set  of  teaching  aids  for  new  schools  constructed  under  the  BESDP;  and  (iii) \n\n                                                 \n18 Targeted provinces are provinces targeted for provision of additional physical facilities. \n19 Targeted for provision of additional physical facilities \n\n \n\n\fsubject-specific teaching and learning materials and other teaching aids to 137 lower secondary \nschools. \n\n61. \nThe outputs from this component will be (i) revised and integrated primary curriculum; (ii) \nrevised  lower  secondary  curriculum  and  learning  outcomes;  (iii)  draft  upper  secondary \ncurriculum;  (iv)  18  existing  textbooks  and  16  existing  teacher  guides  for  3  current  lower \nsecondary grades distributed to all lower secondary schools in all LSE schools  in the country; \n(v)  31  new  lower  secondary  textbooks  and  28  new  teacher  guides  for  4  grades  for  the \nreorganized LSE printed and distributed to all lower secondary schools in 50 BESDP districts; \n(vi)  in-service  training  modules  for  all  new  and  revised  lower  secondary  textbooks;  (vii)  10 \nmaster trainers, 40 trainers, and 5,373 lower secondary teachers each receive 9 days training; \n(viii)  all  10  teacher  training  colleges20 receive  a  package  of  equipment  and  learning  materials; \n(ix) 28 new schools receive a package of teaching equipment and teaching-learning materials; \nand (x)  137 other lower secondary schools receive learning materials.  \n\nc. \n\nStrengthen Capacity for Education Management \n\nThis component is to strengthen MOE capacity for improved planning, management, and \n\n62. \ndelivery of education.  \n\nStrengthen the EMIS, TMIS and FMIS. The Project will provide complementary support \n63. \nfor  strengthening  the  EMIS  by  creating  a  subset  for  TMIS  and  FMIS  at  national,  provincial, \ndistrict  and  schools,  with  intensive  capacity  building. 21 Activities  to  support  TMIS  and  FMIS \ncreation  include  (i)  printing  questionnaires  and  other  instruments  to  collect  information  from \nschools,  pupils,  education  staff,  PESs,  and  district  education  bureaus  (DEBs);  (ii)  organizing \nworkshops  to  assess  and  validate  data  collection  procedures;  and  (iii)  organizing  training \nprograms  for  MOE,  PESs,  DEBs,  and  school  staff  in  charge  of  filling  in  data  collection \ninstruments,  data  processing,  and  data  analysis  in  the  BESDP  provinces.  Where  applicable, \nsteps to improve the disaggregation of data by gender and ethnicity will be taken.  \n\nStrengthen  Planning  and  Budget  Preparation.  The  Project  will  support \n\n64. \nthe \ndevelopment of an outcome-oriented budget format and process aligned with the preparation of \nan education MTEF. The format will be piloted in at least 3 provinces22 leading to regional and \nnational application, with intensive capacity-building inputs for the design and implementation of \nfinancial  management  techniques  (accounting,  reporting,  and  monitoring)  in  line  with  the  new \nnational,  provincial,  district,  and  school  budget \nthe \ncomplementary  development  of  provincial  planning  aligned  with  budgeting  and  in  line  with \nnational  policies.  This  planning  process  will  be  piloted  in  the  same  three  provinces,  and  will \ninclude  support  for  capacity  building.  To  accomplish  this,  the  Project  will  provide  for  (i) \nworkshops  to  assess  and  validate  improved  budget  and  actual  expenditure  format,  modern \nfinancial  management  techniques,  and  associated  data  collection  instruments;  (ii)  training \nprograms  for  PES,  DEB,  and  school  staff  in  charge  of  budgeting,  accounting,  reporting,  and \nmonitoring  expenditure;  (iii)  two  workshops  to  validate  the  methodology  used  to  design  the \neducation  MTEF;  (iv)  training  workshops  for  the  MOE  unit  in  charge  of  the  MTEF;  and  (v) \ntraining programs for PES and DEB staff in charge of planning.  \n\nformat.  The  Project  will  support \n\n65. \nStrengthen  the  Central  Inventory  System.  The  Project  will  support  the  design  of  a \ncentral  system  for  registering  and  monitoring  the  Government\u2019s  physical  assets/properties \n\n                                                 \n20  Responsible for training primary and lower secondary teachers. \n21  To be undertaken in close coordination with complementary inputs being provided by the World Bank. \n22  Attapeu, Luang Namtha, and Savanakhet. \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n(including  land)  and  the  upgrading  of  the  central  warehouse  through  expansion  and \nrehabilitation.  \n\n66. \nThis  component  will  have  the  following  outputs  (i)  an  improved  EMIS,  including  TMIS \nand  FMIS;  (ii)  training  in  data  collection,  processing,  and  analysis  for  all  statisticians  in  all \nprovincial and district education offices; (iii) training for all school heads nationwide in filling out \nthe revised questionnaires; (iv) formats for different levels for data submission to feed planning \nand  budget  preparation;  (v)  development  of  an  education  MTEF  linked  to  the  national  MTEF; \n(vi) an aligned planning and budgeting process based on a school mapping approach, teacher \nallocation  and  deployment,  and  planned  external  interventions;  and  (vii)  development  of  a  full \ninventory system for MOE physical assets and improved storage in an upgraded warehouse.  \n\n3. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n67. \nIn the past, all external assistance to school education in the Lao PDR was directed to \nthe primary education subsector. The BESDP is the first intervention to take cognizance of and \nprovide support for, the rapid expansion of LSE. The BESDP will address demand in areas of \nrapid economic growth where expansion is occurring most rapidly.  \n\n68. \nIt will also support equity and access in poor remote and rural areas. Even in provinces \nof  rapid  economic  growth,  support  will  be  provided  to  the  poorest  areas.  Recognizing  that  the \nmost  disadvantaged  children,  in  terms  of  educational  enrollments,  are  from  ethnic  groups  and \namong  these  girls  are  more  disadvantaged  than  boys,  the  BESDP  will  provide  targeted \nscholarships  to  children,  particularly  girls,  from  ethnic  groups.  The  BESDP  will  also  provide \neducation development grants to needy schools and allow for flexibility to use the grants on a \nneed basis. Community members, as part of the school management committees, will manage \nthe grants. \n\nThe  BESDP  will  make  substantial  contributions  to  long-term  sustainability  of  education \n69. \nreforms  by  improving  efficiency  as  well  as  quality  of  education  through  significant  policy  and \ninstitutional  interventions,  mainly  (i)  an  improved  EMIS,  and  TMIS  and  FMIS  subsets;  (ii)  a \nframework for recruitment and deployment of teachers; and (iii) assistance to establish systems \nfor effective planning and budget preparation.  \n\n4. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n70. \nThe project investment cost is estimated at $15.83 million, including physical and price \ncontingencies, duties, and taxes (Table 1, and Appendix 9). The foreign exchange cost is $4.74 \nmillion,  or  29.9%  of  the  total.  The  local  currency  cost,  including  duties  and  taxes,  is  $11.10 \nmillion, or 70.1% of the total cost. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fTable 1: Cost Estimates Summary by Component  \n($ million) \n\n \nComponent \nA.

MOE  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  and  will  have  overall \nresponsibility for project coordination and implementation. An interministerial steering committee \nto be set up to oversee the BESDP (para. 43) will provide overall guidance to the Project and \nmonitor its activities and outputs.  \n\nThe Director General of the Department of General Education will be the project director, \n73. \nand  departments  and  institutions  of  MOE  at  the  national,  provincial  and  district  levels  will  be \nresponsible for  activities  that  fall  within  their  area  of  responsibility.  A  project  management  unit \nwill be established to help MOE coordinate and supervise project implementation. Supplemental \nsupport,  i.e.,  two  additional  staff  at  MOE  headquarters  will  assist  with  administrative  functions \nand accounting. Funds are allocated for project management and implementation at all levels, \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nand  for  the  project  management  unit  to  hire  national  staff  for  short  durations  to  assist  with \nprocurement.  \n\n74. \nImplementation  Period. The Project will be implemented over 5 years from April 2007 \nto March 2012. The Government has assured that adequate budgetary provision for the Project \nwill  be  included  in  the  fiscal  year  2007/2008  budget.  The  implementation  schedule  is  in \nAppendix 11. \n\nProcurement.  All  ADB-financed  goods  and  services  procured  for  the  Project  will  be  in \n75. \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April 2006, as amended from time to time). A \nprocurement plan, with indicative procurement packages, is in Appendix 12.  \n\nSupply contracts for goods such as vehicles and computers of less than $0.5 million but \n76. \nmore  than  $100,000  will  follow  national  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Minor  items  costing \nless than $100,000 equivalent may be procured by shopping. Details of procurement packages \nand  technical  specifications  will  be  submitted  for  ADB  approval  before  procurement. \nProcurement  of  vehicles  will  be  undertaken  by  the  Interagency  Procurement  Service  Office. \nADB  Management  approved  advance  procurement  action  on  19  July 2006  to  expedite  project \nimplementation. ADB\u2019s concurrence to advance action does not commit ADB to finance related \nexpenditures  under  the  Project  or  to  finance  the  Project.  Project  civil  works  will  comprise \nconstruction of (i) 28 new school buildings and (ii) 144 additional classrooms. All civil works will \nbe carried out using national competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB. \n\n77. \nBefore  the  commencement  of  any  procurement  activity  under  national  competitive \nbidding,  ADB  and  the  Government  will  review  the  Government\u2019s  public  procurement  law  to \nensure  consistency  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  Any  necessary  modifications  or \nclarifications will be reflected in the procurement plan. \n\nConsulting  Services.  The  Project  will  be  supported  by  187.5  person-months  of \n78. \nconsulting  services  (83.5  person-months  international  and  104  person-months  national).  The \nselection and engagement of consulting services for 184.5 person-months (80.5 person-months \nof  international  and  all  national  consultants)  will  be  done  in  a  single  package,  using  the \nsimplified technical proposal and quality- and cost-based selection method, in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (April  2006,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  An \ninternational expert for examination reform (3 person-months) will be recruited on an individual \nbasis  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  for  recruitment  of  individual  consultants.  The \nconsulting  services  are  designed  to  provide  technical  support  to  the  Project  as  well  as  build \nlonger term capacity for planning, management, and delivery of basic education. The consulting \nservices cover broad areas of expertise that include (i) policy reform, (ii) social and community \ndevelopment,  (iii)  curriculum  and  materials  development,  (iv)  data  collection  and  analysis,  (v) \nEMIS development, and (vi) facilities and equipment improvement. Indicative terms of reference \nfor consultants are provided in Appendix 13. \n\n79. \nInvoluntary  Resettlement.  Expansion  of  existing  schools  under  the  Project  will  not \nrequire any new land. Construction of new schools will be carried out only on vacant land owned \nby the Government that is free from all encumbrances, habitation, dispute, or controversy. Only \nsubprojects categorized as C in accordance with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement and \nmeeting  the  eligibility  criteria  for  the  selection  of  sites  for  civil  works,  as  agreed  between  the \nGovernment and ADB, will be selected.  \n \n80. \nEnvironment.  The  Project\u2019s  environmental  impacts  were  reviewed  and  no  significant \nadverse impacts were identified. Small-scale civil works covering water and electricity supply, as \n\n \n\n\fwell  as  toilet  facilities  will  be  constructed  in  accordance  with  Lao  PDR  regulations.  Activities \nresulting from the Project will not cause pollution, health hazards, or soil erosion. The Project is \ncategorized  as  category  C.  The  site  selection,  design,  construction,  replacement  work,  and \noperation of school facilities will be implemented in accordance with the relevant regulations and \nstandards of the ADB\u2019s Environment Policy.23  \n \nAnticorruption  Policy.  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy24 was  explained  to  and  discussed \n81. \nwith  the  Government  and  MOE.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy are included in the \ngrant regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of MOE and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project.  \n \nIn  addition  to  the  standard  ADB  requirements  to  deter  corruption  and  increase \n82. \ntransparency, the Government will be required to disclose information about various matters on \nthe  Project,  including  procurement  related  to  the  Project,  on  MOE\u2019s  website.  With  regard  to \nprocurement,  the  website  will  include,  among  others,  list  of  participating  bidders,  name  of  the \nwinning bidder, basic details on bidding procedures adopted, amount of contract awarded, and \nlist of goods/services procured. Information regarding the criteria and procedures for selection of \ncandidates for scholarships will also be posted on the website. \n \nDisbursement  Arrangements.  MOE  will  establish  an  imprest  account  for  the  Project. \n83. \nThe advance to the imprest account will be no more than a 6-month projected disbursement or \n10%  of  the  grant  amount,  whichever  is  lower.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established, \nmanaged,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2001). \nStatement  of  expenditure  procedures  may  be  used  to  reimburse  contracts  not  exceeding \n$50,000 per payment and to liquidate advances made into the imprest account in accordance \nwith the grants\u2019 financial covenants. MOE and MOF will coordinate the timely release of funds. \nThis  is  essential  because  project  activities  will  take  place  at  different  locations  and  simple \nmechanisms are required to disburse small funds quickly through decentralized decision-making \nwhile maintaining acceptable financial control.  \n \n84. \nAccounting,  Auditing,  and  Reporting.  MOE,  on  behalf  of  the  Government,  will \nmaintain separate records and accounts for the Project to identify goods and services financed \nfrom  the  grant  proceeds.  Project  accounts,  including  financial  statements,  statements  of \nexpenditure,  and  imprest  account  records,  will  be  audited  annually  by  independent  auditors \nacceptable  to  ADB  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  grant  agreement.  The  auditor\u2019s \nreport  and  copies  of  the  certified  accounts  and  related  financial  statements,  including  the \nauditor\u2019s opinion on the use of grant proceeds, compliance with grant covenants, and use of the \nimprest account under ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedure, will be submitted to ADB no \nlater than 6 months after the close of each fiscal year.  \n \n85.  MOE will prepare quarterly reports on program implementation and submit them to ADB \nwithin 30 days of each quarter. The reports will be submitted in a format acceptable to ADB and \ninclude progress made against established targets, problems encountered during the previous \n\n                                                 \n23  ADB. 2002.

Within  3  months  after  physical  completion  of \nthe  Project,  MOE  will  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report  providing  details  of  project \nimplementation and accomplishments. \n \n86. \nProject  Performance  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  MOE  will  monitor  BESDP \nachievements  to  evaluate  implementation  and  development  impacts  at  various  stages  of  the \nproject  cycle.  BESDP  performance  monitoring  will  focus  on  implementation  plans  and  targets, \nand  their  fulfillment.  Performance  evaluations  will  examine  the  impact  of  interventions, \nproblems,  and  constraints;  the  reason  for  them;  and  their  solutions.  To  facilitate  evaluation  of \ntargeted  interventions  under  component  1,  MOE\u2019s  Gender  and  Ethnic  Groups  Education  Unit \nwill conduct an impact assessment study in the third year of BESDP implementation. Based on \nthe  findings  of  the  study,  refinements  and/or  modifications  may  be  made  to  streamline \nimplementation of the targeted interventions for impact enhancement.  \n \n87. \nProject  Review.  The  Government,  ADB,  and  other  development  partners  will  review \nimplementation  and  impact  of  all  reforms  in  the  education  sector  through  the  coordination \nmechanism already in place. In addition, the Government and ADB will conduct regular periodic \nreviews of the BESDP. In the third year of implementation, the Government and ADB will jointly \nundertake a midterm review of the Project. The review will assess implementation performance \nagainst  project  performance  indicators,  review  and  establish  compliance  with  loan  covenants, \nidentify problems and constraints, and propose changes to the Project, if necessary.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits \n\n88. \nA well-educated population and work force is necessary for sustained economic growth. \nIn an increasingly competitive environment, educational attainment beyond primary is important \nfor  most  of  the  population.  LSE  lays  the  foundations  for  acquisition  of  basic  cognitive  skills, \nwhich  are  essential  for  productivity  as  well  as  for  enhancing  basic  welfare;  and  increases  the \ntransition  rates  to  secondary  and  other  higher  levels  of  education.  For  the  Lao  PDR,  where \nparticipation  rates  and  quality  of  educational  achievements  are  still  low,  investments  in \nimproving  access  to  and  quality  of  education  can  have  significant  positive  gains,  both \neconomically and socially.  \n \nEconomic  Benefits.  The  economic  benefits  from  the  BESDP  will  be  two  fold.  First, \n89. \nsubstantial economic benefits are expected to accrue from efficiency gains. Improved quality of \neducation  will  lead  to  reductions  in  dropout  and  repetition  rates.  These  reductions  will  reduce \nwaste and result in lower per capita expenditures in education. Interventions aimed at systemic \nimprovements  to  strengthen  planning  and  management,  particularly  to  effect  more  rational \nrecruitment and deployment of teachers will enhance economic efficiency through more efficient \nuse of scarce resources. Similarly, a more equitable distribution of physical facilities based on \nenrollments  will  lead  to  more  efficient  use  of  resources.  Overall  increased  access  will  expand \ncoverage of education, with increased enrollments, increasing the number of beneficiaries and \nleading to more students graduating to higher levels of education.  \n \n90. \nSecond,  students  who  do  not  drop  out  in  any  given  year  increase  their  wage-earning \npotential.  Studies  indicate  that  each  extra  year  of  schooling  increases  labor  productivity  and \nearning  potential.  Thus,  students  are  able  to  get  a  higher  return  from  their  investment  in \neducation. Improved quality of LSE will encourage more primary school completers to continue \n\n \n\n\ftheir  studies,  resulting  in  higher  educational  attainment  thereby  increasing  their  earning \npotential. The scholarships provided under the program to girls and ethnic students will attract \nchildren  from  these  groups  to  continue  their  education  in  LSE.  This  will  enhance  their \nproductivity and earning capability resulting in a positive impact on their families, helping them \nto break out of the cycle of poverty.  \n \n91. \nSocial  Benefits.  Society  derives  substantial  gains  from  increases  in  education \nattainment,  particularly  basic  education.  Improvements  in  human  development  indicators  are \ndirectly linked to level of education attainment. Social benefits are highest from investments in \ngirls\u2019  education  and  have  particular  significance  because  they  are  intergenerational.  Educated \nwomen have fewer children; provide better nutrition for their children leading to improved family \nhealth;  and  provide  for  fairer  and  more  equitable  intrahousehold  allocation  of  resources, \nreducing  future  gender  disparities.  Studies  indicate  that  educated  mothers  tend  to  use  health \nservices more frequently, thereby increasing efficiencies of health care investments. Substantial \nbenefits  will  also  accrue  from  reduced  risk  of  vulnerability  to  HIV/AIDS,  child  labor  and \ntrafficking, especially in cross-border areas. Social gains from lower rates of population growth, \nhealthier  households,  and  a  better  educated  population  also  imply  significant  economic  gains \nsince the state has to invest less in expansion of basic services (health and education) and can \ninstead focus on improvements in quality.  \n \nThe  BESDP  will  expand  access  for  children  in  ethnic  areas  and  improve  facilities  in \n92. \nneedy  schools  through  the  provision  of  block  grants.  Enhanced  opportunities  for  improved \nquality  of  education  for  ethnic  children  will,  in  the  long  term,  contribute  to  reduced  economic \ndisparities resulting in greater integration and social harmony. Populations also benefit from the \ndemonstration  effect  of  increased  education  attainment,  resulting  in  greater  demand  for \neducation as well as adoption of more progressive social habits and dispersal of knowledge on \nkey social issues.  \n \nInstitutional Benefits. Direct systemic benefits to the education sector will accrue from \n93. \nthe policy reforms supported by the BESDP. The policy areas and supporting capacity building, \nwhich  will  lead  to  substantial  long-term  efficiencies,  include  (i)  a  rational  and  standardized \nprocess for planning and budget preparation; and (ii) development of an MTEF for the education \nsector  that  will  feed  into  the  national  MTEF.  Resource  efficiencies  will  also  accrue  from \ndevelopment  of  a  policy  framework  for  the  recruitment  and  deployment  of  teachers  that  will \npromote efficient use of available teaching personnel. An improved EMIS, including a TMIS and \na FMIS, will enable more precise planning and management resulting in efficiencies in allocation \nas well as utilization of scarce resources. These policy measures will help sustain interventions \nthat support expansion and quality of education.  \n \n94. \nThe BESDP will have national, provincial, and district institutional benefits. It will support \ndecentralized planning and management capability through the design and piloting of systems \nfor  budget  preparation,  financial  reporting,  and  implementation  at  all  levels  of  education \nmanagement. It will support clear delineation and strengthening of the roles and responsibilities \nof provincial and district education bodies. The Project will enhance capacity for data collection, \nmanagement,  and  analysis.  MOE\u2019s  inventory  system  will  be  strengthened  to  allow  for  better \nasset  management.  These  inputs  will  also  lead  to  economic  benefits  derived  from  efficiencies \ngained through improved planning and management capacity.  \n \n \n \n \n\n21 \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\nB. \n\nRisks \n\n95. \nThe  BESDP  was  designed  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  goals  for  expansion  and \nstrengthening  of  the  education  sector.  The  Government  has  shown  strong  commitment  to \neducation  and  accords  it  high  priority  as  a  key  sector  for  economic  development  and  poverty \nreduction.  Even  so,  limited  leadership  and  ownership  of  the  policy  reform  process  and  lack  of \nconsistency in policy and strategic decision-making pose potential risks. These will be mitigated \nthrough  (i)  the  ongoing  review  and  assessment  process  by  MOE  officials  and  the  EDWG, \nincluding nongovernment organizations to secure broad support for the reform agenda; (ii) the \nannual BESDP review process, which will facilitate a phased and sequenced approach to policy \nimplementation;  and  (iii)  technical  support  under  the  BESDP  as  well  as  advisory  support  by \nADB25 and  other  development  partners  for  ongoing  policy  studies  and  related  legislative  and \nregulatory reforms.  \n \n96.  MOE\u2019s limited capacity to manage and implement the revised policies and strategies is \nanother  potential  risk.  This  will  be  mitigated  by  (i)  helping  MOE  to  strengthen  systems  for \ndecentralized  planning  and  management,  and  (ii)  providing  extensive  advisory  support  for \nsubsector  and  program  planning  and  management.  Consulting  services  supported  by  the \nBESDP  will  also  help  the  Government  ensure  that  an  appropriate  legislative  and  regulatory \nframework is in place, as agreed in the policy matrix.  \n \n97. \nLimitations  in  tax  recovery,  uncertainties  in  future  aid  agency  funding,  and  unforeseen \ndevelopments  pose  potential  risks  that  may  undermine  the  predictability  of  Government \nresources  available  for  education,  especially  the  significant  transitional  costs  associated  with \npolicy  reforms.  This  potential  risk  will  be  mitigated  through  (i)  extensive  dialogue  on  medium-\nterm resource availability for education between MOE and funding agencies within the EDWG; \n(ii) using the MTEF process as a basis for identifying potential budget shortfalls and mobilizing \nincreased sector budget support; (iii) extensive sector efficiency measures to improve efficiency \nof  resource  use;  and  (iv)  strong  policy  linkage  with  the  Government\u2019s  broader  public  financial \nmanagement  reforms.  Resource  constraints  may  also  limit  the  ability  of  the  Government  to \nredress  the  imbalance  in  favor  of  capital  expenditures.  However,  Government  revenues  are \nexpected  to  increase  in  the  future.  The  Government  has  committed  to  providing  revenues \ngenerated  by  the  Nam  Theun  2  Project  to  spending  on  the  social  sectors. 26  Increased \navailability of resources for social sectors will allow for a more balanced allocation of resources. \nAn economic and financial analysis is provided in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n \nC. \n\nSustainability \n\n98. \nBESDP-related  expenditures  will  increase  continuously  and  reach  $1.39  million  during \nthe  last  year  of  the  Project  in  relation  to  the  increasing  number  of  teachers  and  nonteaching \nstaff required for additional LSE classes and operation and maintenance expenses. A number of \ncommitments, however, such as cost of land, and taxes and charges, will terminate at the end \nof  the  Project,  and  hence  will  not  be  an  ongoing  burden.  Given  the  size  of  the  projected \neducation  sector  budget,  the  continuing  additional  incremental  costs  of  $1.39  million  annually \nafter  the  project  period  will  add  0.35%  to  the  total  in  2009\u20132010.  This  is  feasible  and \nsustainable,  given  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  educational  expansion  and  development. \nMoreover, some project gains, particularly efficiency gains and those that strengthen capacity, \n\n                                                 \n25  An advisory technical assistance for $500,000 is scheduled for 2006.  \n26  The Nam Theun 2 Project is expected to be operational and revenue generating by November 2009, and to yield \n\nsubstantial additional resources for the Government through export of power generated. \n\n \n\n\fimprove  the  curriculum  and  classroom  assessment,  and  improve  teacher  competencies  will \nhave long-term beneficial impacts and are not susceptible to short-term resource constraints. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \n\n99. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n100.

Considerable  progress  has  been  made  in  improving  access  to  education  in \nthe  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  in  recent  years,  particularly  in  primary \neducation. Net enrollment ratios1 (NERs) for primary education increased from 63% in 1990 to \napproximately  79%  in  2005.  Similarly,  gross  enrollment  ratios2 for  lower  secondary  increased \nfrom 30% in 1990 to 51% in 2005; and, for upper secondary from 26.3% in 2003 to 31% in 2005. \nWith a more than 8 % annual increase, the number of secondary students has been growing at \nfour times the rate of primary school students.  \n\n2. \nGirls\u2019  enrollment  has  also  shown  rapid  progress.  Gender  differentials  in  primary \nenrollments have dropped by 7.4%  since 1996 (from 21.6% to 14.2%).  Girls\u2019 lower secondary \nenrollments increased by more than 4% between 2003 and 2005 compared with 1.9% for boys. \nDuring  the  same  period,  girls\u2019  upper  secondary  enrollment  increased  by  4.4%  compared  with \n5.1%  for  boys.  Even  so,  significant  gender  differentials  remain:  primary  school  enrollment  for \ngirls lags boys by approximately 14%; secondary school enrollment for girls lags boys by more \nthan 12%. \n\n3. \nDespite the rapid expansion of school education, the education sector is weak and faces \nconsiderable  challenges  in  addressing  sector  needs.  In  keeping  with  educational  trends  in \ndeveloping economies, demand for education within all subsectors will continue to grow rapidly. \nThe  Government,  in  its  draft  Sixth  National  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan  (2006\u20132010), \nprovides  targets  for  each  educational  subsector  linked  to  expansion  of  enrollment  as  well  as \nimproved  efficiencies  within  the  system.  The  main  challenges  will  be  to  meet  the  growing \ndemand for education, address equity issues, and improve internal efficiency of the system. \n\n4. \nAccess  and  Equity.  Despite  rapid  enrollment  growth,  universal  access  to  primary \neducation remains a major challenge: approximately 23% of primary school-age children are not \nenrolled  in  school.  Among  those  who  enroll,  more  than  8%  drop  out.  National  enrollment \nstatistics  hide  the  disparities  that  exist  in  access  by  geographic  region,  socioeconomic  status, \nand ethnicity. The NER for girls is primary schools is 49% in rural areas without access to roads, \n72.2% in rural areas with access to roads, and 90.5% in urban areas. Luangnamtha Province \nhas the lowest primary NER for girls at 43% and boys at 48.6%. By comparison, Vientiane City \nhas the highest NER of 95% for girls and 92% for boys. Similar disparities exist at the lower and \nupper secondary levels.  \n\nWhen enrollments reach high levels, growth rates tend to decline. This is true in the Lao \n5. \nPDR where enrollment trends, particularly for primary education, indicate overall declining rates \nof  increase.  Enrollment  growth  is  declining  in  high-income  areas  and  increasing  rapidly  in  the \npoor and poorest areas. In the high-income areas, enrollments are already relatively high and \nbirthrates are declining, whereas in the poorer areas the potential for growth is greater because \nof the initial low threshold, birthrates continue to be high, and also possibly because externally \nfunded  projects  have  targeted  poorer  areas  for  expanded  access  to  primary  education.  Low \nenrollment  is  also  responsible  for  high  rates  of  expansion  for  lower  and  upper  secondary \neducation.  \n\n6. \nPhysical access continues to be a barrier for primary education\u2014approximately 15% of \nvillages  are  still  without  a  primary  school  within  commutable  distance.  Further,  approximately \n70%  of  schools  in  the  poorest  districts  are  incomplete  schools,  only  offering  classes  up  to \n                                                 \n1   The NER refers to pupils enrolled from the eligible age group. \n2   The gross enrollment ratio refers to total pupils enrolled. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n31\n\ngrades 2 or 3. Thus, children in the poorest areas, particularly girls and ethnic minority groups, \nare  distinctly  disadvantaged  in  terms  of  limited  access  to  education.  In  the  case  of  lower  and \nupper secondary education, rapid expansion has not been matched by increased availability of \nschools with adequate facilities or qualified teachers. The demand for additional space has been \nmet  by  overcrowding  in  the  classrooms  or  by  use  of  abandoned  primary  schools  where \nexternally  funded  projects  have  provided  new  buildings.  In  addition,  primary  teachers  have \ncrossed  over  to  the  lower  secondary  system,  resulting  in  a  shortage  of  primary  teachers  and \novercrowding of primary classrooms. The inadequately qualified secondary teachers, increasing \nclass sizes, and shortage of classrooms have multiple negative impacts on quality. \n\n7. \nQuality.  Quality  aspects  of  school  education  remain  a  serious  concern.  Quality  is  a \nfunction  of  internal  systemic  efficiencies.  The  Lao  National  Literacy  Survey  found  that  primary \neducation does not ensure the acquisition of basic literacy. Just over 50% of primary graduates \n(grade  5  completers)  attain  basic  literacy.  Similarly,  only  38%  of  nonformal  education  level  III \ncompleters  (equivalent  to  primary  graduates)  attain  basic  literacy.  Internal  efficiency  of  the \neducation  system  has  been  improving  since  1995/96,  with  a  significant  decline  in  repetition \nrates  for  all  grades,  especially  grade  5.  However,  repetition  and  dropout  rates  are  still  high  in \ngrades  1  and  2.  About  33%  of  students  in  primary  school  repeat  grade  1  and  another  19% \nrepeat grade 2. Completion rates for primary education are estimated at 48% for females and \n52%  for  males.  Repetition  rates  vary  across  poverty  levels.  High  repetition  and  dropout  rates, \nparticularly at the lower grades, and an average of 8 years to complete primary education are \nindications  of  low  internal  efficiency  and  poor  quality  education.  Internal  efficiency  improves \nafter  grade  4  with  repetition  and  dropout  rates  declining.  Internal  efficiency  is  higher  for \nsecondary education with lower dropout and repetition rates. However, rapid expansion without \nadequate emphasis on strengthening quality will cause efficiency declines. Factors contributing \nto poor quality of education are (i) lack of adequate supply of qualified teachers; (ii) shortage of \ntextbooks  and  other  learning  materials;  (iii)  curriculum  deficiencies;  (iv)  low  recurrent \nexpenditures;  and  (v)  weak  institutional  capacity  for  planning,  management,  and  delivery  of \neducation. \n\n8. \nEducation service delivery is still uneven and the quality of education has not caught up \nwith the rapid expansion of the system, creating an imbalance, particularly among poor people \nliving in rural ethnic villages. Rapid expansion of postprimary education under severe financial \nconstraints has had a negative impact on quality. Average class sizes have grown, especially in \ngrades  9  to  11,  where  the  national  average  reached  81  pupils  per  class  in  2004/05.  The \ndemand for additional secondary teachers has been partly met by transferring primary teachers \nto secondary schools. This has led to underqualified teachers at secondary schools and larger \nclass  sizes  at  primary  schools  (see  also  para.  6).  The  transfer  of  teachers  from  primary  to \nsecondary could have a negative impact on achievement of Education for All goals. However, \nlarge  class  sizes  are  not  entirely  a  result  of  lack  of  teachers  but  also  of  inadequate  physical \nfacilities  to  accommodate  the  larger  numbers,  leading  to  overcrowding  in  limited  classroom \nspace.  \n\n9. \nLack  of  adequate  textbooks  and  learning  materials  is  also  a  major  contributor  to  weak \nquality. In fact, limited availability of books in primary and lower secondary schools is the most \ncommonly  cited  problem  for  Lao  schools.  Most  schools  have  insufficient  textbooks  and  few,  if \nany, learning materials. Overall teacher qualifications are low. Nationally, 22% of teachers have \ncompleted only primary education; more than 20% have had no training, and a high proportion \nof  these  untrained  teachers  are  in  remote  areas.  Teacher  training,  another  key  element  for \nquality  of  education,  is  being  addressed  through  funding  agency  support  and  a  formal  school \nteacher  training  plan  is  in  the  final  stages  of  preparation.  However,  a  policy  framework  for \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nteacher  recruitment  and  deployment  to  ensure  the  supply  of  qualified  teachers  is  still  lacking, \nand teacher guides are in short supply. \n\n10. \nFinance. Resource allocations declined sharply in 1997 from a 15% share of the budget \nto  a  low  of  8%.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  raise  the  allocations  to  16%  by  2010  taking \neducation  expenditures  to  more  than  3%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP),  from  the  current \n2.5%. This would be in line with expenditures of other developing countries. Funding agencies \ncontribute,  on  average,  approximately  75%  of  capital  investments  in  education.  These \ninvestments create a demand for recurrent expenditures that the Government has not been able \nto  meet,  thus  creating  an  imbalance  in  the  ratio  of  capital  and  recurrent  expenditures.  While \nmost  countries  in  the  region  assign  about  70%  of  their  education  budget  to  recurrent \nexpenditures, the recurrent share for the Lao PDR is little more than 40%. The average salary of \na  primary  teacher  amounts  to  0.65%  GDP/capita  compared  with  a  regional  average  of  2.0%\u2013\n2.5%  GDP/capita.  Continued  capital  investments  are  likely  to  result  in  increasing  physical \ncoverage of schools, but with chronic shortage of recurrent resources for teachers\u2019 salaries and \nprovision  of  textbooks  and  supplies.  This  imbalance  between  the  recurrent  and  capital \nexpenditures needs to be corrected and a more sustainable ratio obtained (i.e., 70:30).  \n\nAlthough \n\nthe  Government  specifies  budget  guidelines,  recent  developments \n\n11. \nin \ndecentralization mean that final decisions now rest with provincial governors, who may allocate \ntheir  budget  for  what  they  perceive  to  be  the  most  urgent  needs.  Over  the  last  3  years,  the \nshare  of  provincial  budgets  allocated  to  education  varied  from  a  low  of  5%  to  a  high  of  25%. \nVariations  in  this  share  are  mostly  determined  by  the  share  of  provincial  investments  for \neducation,  which  is  limited.  Conversely,  the  share  of  the  provincial  recurrent  budget  going  to \neducation  averages  25%\u201330%,  since  the  number  of  quota  staff  in  education  is  rather  high. \nCentral  agencies  lack  appropriate  information  systems  to  monitor  and  control  provincial \nbudgeting and disbursement and the Ministry of Education (MOE) can no longer track provincial \nexpenditures to determine actual expenditures on education. Moreover, decentralization makes \nlimited provision for the redistribution of resources; this disadvantages poor provinces that have \nresource constraints and are unable to provide adequate funding for education. Decentralization \nshould  be  reassessed  and  only  undertaken  at  a  pace  compatible  with  local  implementation \ncapacities and MOE\u2019s monitoring capacity. \n \n12. \nGovernment Objectives and Strategic Priorities. Since 2000, the Government of the \nLao  PDR  has  demonstrated  continued  commitment  to  pro-poor  development,  with  the \nelaboration  of  the  National  Poverty  Eradication  Program,  supported  by  a  broad  external \nassistance program and followed by the design of the National Growth and Poverty Eradication \nStrategy (June 2004). The Government\u2019s goals for education and training include the following:3 \n(i)  universalizing  quality  primary  education  and  continuing  expansion  of  lower  secondary \neducation; (ii) eradicating illiteracy; (iii) expanding vocational, technical, and higher education to \nmeet  the  demands  of  the  new  labor  market,  and  improving  human  capital  rates  of  return;  (iv) \nbuilding  the  capacity  of  skilled  workers,  technicians,  professionals,  and  intellectuals  to  use \nmodern science and technology to serve development needs; (v) gradually improving the quality \nof  national  education  to  international  standards;  and  (vi)  establishing  education  as  a  right  and \nresponsibility of all people in society. The Government\u2019s priority is to ensure equitable access to \nquality  basic  education  (primary  and  lower  secondary),  and  produce  quality  and  trainable \nstudents for further education and training. \n \n                                                 \n3   The  priorities  are  stated  in  more  detail  in  Ministry  of  Education.  2002.

Vientiane.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n33\n\nThe Government recognizes that education and literacy are prerequisites for sustained \n13. \neconomic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  The  people  of  the  Lao  PDR  must  be  literate  and \npossess  knowledge  about  modern  agricultural  methods  and  other  skills  to  be  able  to  meet \ninternational  competition  and  standards.  The  2006\u20132010  Education  Sector  Development  Plan \nstates \u201cThe provision and effective use of basic social services is an important means to break \nthe  poverty  cycle\u2026  Education  and  literacy  are  prerequisites  for  the  introduction  of  modern \nproductivity-enhancing  technologies  and  for  competing  in  domestic  and  world  markets\u2026 \nEvidence from various countries in the region, including the Lao PDR, shows that the education \nof  girls  and  women  has  multiple  benefits,  affecting  their  welfare  and  that  of  their  children  and \nfamilies.\u201d  The  2001  participatory  poverty  assessment  indicated  that  education  is  a  low  priority \nfor  the  poor. 4  Many  poor  villagers  view  education  as  unavailable,  unaffordable,  and/or \nsecondary  to  securing  their  livelihood.  The  Government\u2019s  Sixth  Socio-Economic  Development \nPlan (2006\u20132010) and the National Plan of Action for Education for All (EFA Plan) recognizes \neducation as the key plank of the education strategy. The strategy includes improving access to \neducation, particularly in remote areas; and stresses the need to improve school participation, \ncompletion  rates,  and  the  quality  of  teaching  and  learning.  The  EFA  Plan  is  also  seen  as  a \nmeans to promote lower secondary, nonformal, and adult education.  \n\n \n14. \nResource  constraints  are  likely  to  severely  handicap  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to \noperationalize its strategies and policies for the education sector. Several external development \nagencies provide support to the sector; almost all to primary education. The Asian Development \nBank  (ADB),  recognizing  the  rapidly  expanding  demand  for  education  beyond  primary,  is \nextending  support  to  lower  secondary  education.  However,  demand  at  all  subsectors  far \nexceeds  the  available  resources.  The  Government  should  facilitate  private  investment  in \neducation to meet the demand for quality education, particularly at levels at which returns from \neducation  are  high  enough  to  warrant  cost  recovery.  This  would  free  scarce  government \nresources to meet the current financing gaps for recurrent expenditures as well as direct funds \nto expansion and quality of education at all levels. \n \nSector-Wide  Approach.5 Since  2002,  MOE  has  been  attempting  to  develop  a  sector-\n15. \nwide approach (SWAp) with assistance of the Swedish International Development Agency, and \nhas  been  preparing  to  realign  investment  projects  based  on  the  SWAp.  In  this  context,  MOE \nadopted  the  EFA  Plan  as  an  official  sector  development  plan  that  provides  a  common \nframework  for  future  assistance.  However  the  EFA  Plan\u2019s  focus  is  limited  to  basic  education \n(grades 1\u20139). MOE is constrained in moving forward with the SWAp process because of weak \ncapacity  for  planning,  budgeting,  and  management  of  education.  The  Basic  Education  Sector \nDevelopment  Program  will  provide  support  to  develop  capacity  in  key  areas  that  will  address \nsome  of  these  constraints.  However,  a  careful  assessment  of  institutional  and  management \ncapacity  will  still  need  to  be  undertaken  before  a  SWAp  can  be  adopted.  ADB  will  assist  the \nGovernment,  through  an  advisory  technical  assistance,  to  prepare  a  sector  development \nframework for the school subsector. For sector planning to be a viable strategy, predictability of \nresources  is  necessary.  Thus,  assured  budgetary  allocations,  adequate  provision  of  recurrent \nexpenditures,  and  longer  term  financial  commitment  to  education  by  MOE\u2019s  development \npartners are essential to education sector development in the Lao PDR.  \n \n\n                                                 \n4   ADB. 2001.

Within the Ministry of \nEducation (MOE), the Department of Planning and Cooperation is responsible for coordinating \nfunding  agency  support  in  the  education  sector.  Since  taking  on  this  role,  the  department  has \nfacilitated  the  sharing  of  information  among  various  projects.  However,  it  does  not  have  the \nhuman and institutional resources necessary for comprehensive aid management and delivery.  \n \n2. \nTo  support  the  Government  in  effectively  fulfilling  its  responsibility  for  aid  coordination \nand aid management, funding agencies accepted the need to ensure appropriate coordination. \nIn  March  2004,  funding  agency  dialogue  resulted  in  the  establishment  of  eight  sectoral  and \nthematic funding agency groups, including the Education Donor Working Group (EDWG). \n \nThe  EDWG  includes  representatives  of  the  bilateral  and  multilateral  agencies  active  in \n3. \nthe  education  sector.  These  include  Australia,  Belgium,  France,  Germany,  Japan,  Sweden, \nAsian Development Bank (ADB), European Commission, United Nations Educational, Scientific \nand  Cultural  Organization,  United  Nations  Children's  Fund,  World  Bank,  and  World  Food \nProgram. One or more representatives of nongovernment organizations active in the sector are \nalso  invited  to  attend  meetings.  The  EDWG  usually  meets  on  a  quarterly  basis,  with  the \nGovernment of Australia (Australian Agency for International Development) and United Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund acting as cochairs. Included among the aims of the EDWG is to have ongoing \ndialogue  with  MOE  and  other  government  agencies  concerned  on  a  broad  range  of \ndevelopment  issues,  for  example,  monitoring  and  reviewing  Government  progress  in  meeting \neducation and gender targets and presenting the consensus of funding agencies on key issues. \nThe  main  forum  for  such  dialogue  has  been  the  partner  coordination  meetings  organized  by \nMOE. \n \n4. \nThe 2006 work plan for the EDWG includes the finalization of a common policy matrix for \nthe education sector reflecting shared funding agency and Government priorities, and ongoing \nprogress  and  preparation  toward  a  sector  approach  to  education  development.  The  project \npreparatory  technical  assistance  for  the  Basic  Education  Sector  Development  Program \n(BESDP)  prepared  a  draft  common  policy  matrix,  but  due  to  resource  constraints,  the \nGovernment, ADB, and other funding agencies agreed that the matrix would be finalized during \nthe advisory technical assistance that is in ADB\u2019s pipeline for 2006. The common policy matrix \nneeds more thorough consultations on policy areas and on a more specific action plan for policy \nformulation and implementation.  \n \nIn  late  2005  the  Government  established  its  own  formal  funding  agency  coordination \n5. \nwork  group:  the  Education  and  Gender  Working  Group,  chaired  by  the  director-general  of \nMOE\u2019s Department of Planning and Cooperation, with membership from the Cabinet Office, Lao \nWomen\u2019s  Union,  and  Lao  National  Commission  for  the  Advancement  of  Women.  How  to  best \ncoordinate the work of the two coordinating groups was considered in early 2006. \n \nB. \n\nProjected Trends and Patterns of External Assistance \n\nThe  Government\u2019s  priority  has  been  directed  to  ensuring  equitable  access  to  quality \n6. \nbasic  education  (primary  and  lower  secondary  education),  and  producing  quality  students  for \nfurther education and training. The efforts to ensure equitable access have resulted in the net \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nenrollment  rate  of  primary  schools  increasing  from  63%  in  1989/90  to  approximately  73%  in \n2004/05,6 with little if any progress over the past 3 years.7 Total enrollment in primary education \nis  still  increasing,  but  at  a  rapidly  reducing  rate.  Universal  primary  education  is  very  near  to \nbeing achieved in urban areas, but is far from a reality in poor rural areas, especially for minority \nchildren and girls. Nationally, gender disparity is relatively limited with a 10% gap at admission, \nwhich stays more or less unchanged throughout the primary education cycle.  \n \n7. \nLower secondary enrollment rates, on the other hand, have increased dramatically; the \ngross  enrollment  rate  in  lower  secondary  schools  increased  from  30%  in  1989/90  to  51%  in \n2004/05. Lower secondary education and, even more so, upper secondary education are now \nthe  fastest  growing  segments.  The  number  of  secondary  students  has  been  growing  at  four \ntimes  the  rate  of  primary  school  students.  Education  service  delivery  is  still  uneven  and  the \nquality  of  education  has  not  caught  up  with  the  rapid  expansion  of  the  system,  posing  an \nimbalance particularly among poor people living in rural ethnic villages. \n \nADB  assistance  started  in  1991  with  the  first  Education  Quality  Improvement  Project,8 \n8. \nfollowed  by  the  Basic  Education  (Girls)  Project  in  2000.9 Based  on  a  comprehensive  sector \nstudy in 1998 that provided a policy and investment framework for 2001\u20132005,10 ADB provided \na  loan  for  the  Second  Education  Quality  Improvement  Project  in  2001, 11 which  focused  on \nexpanding  access  to  primary  education.  It  also  provided  a  loan  in  1995  to  revive  the  higher \neducation  system  to  produce  skilled  people  to  lead  national  development  in  various  sectors, \nincluding education, through the establishment of the National University of Laos.12  \n\n9. \nOther  international  and  bilateral  agencies  and  nongovernment  organizations  have \nsupported  the  expansion  of  primary  education,  including  the  World  Bank  through  its  first  and \nsecond  education  development  projects  in  1993  and  2004,  the  Government  of  Japan  through \ngrant  assistance  for  teacher  training  and  primary  school  construction  since  1998,  the \nGovernment of Australia by cofunding a component of the ADB Basic Education (Girls) Project \nas  the  Lao-Australia  Basic  Education  Project,  and  the  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  with  a \nteacher  upgrading  program  since  1992.  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural \nOrganization  assisted  MOE  in  producing  the  National  Plan  of  Action  for  Education  for  All,13 \n\n                                                 \n6   The net enrollment rate estimates based on the MOE education management information system and population \nestimates differ from those resulting from the Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey 2002/03 (LECS3) survey, \nwhich are 5 points lower. Although LECS3 estimates are based on a sample, they  are more accurate than MOE \nexhaustive  estimates  for  two  major  reasons:  (i)  in  LECS3,  the  number  of  children  and  their  participation  in \nschooling are measured in the same unit (household) during the same period, which makes household data more \nreliable; and (ii) MOE assessment of enrollments, admissions, etc. are sometimes overestimated for the provincial \neducation service for various reasons, including the fact that assessment of enrollments occurs at the start of the \nschool  year  but  significant  dropouts  take  place  during  the  year,  and  the  provincial  education  service  sometimes \noverestimates in order to get additional quota teachers. Such overestimates of gross and net enrollment rates by \nMOEs have been observed in a number of countries.  \n\n7   As assessed from MOE database and population estimates based on LECS3 and headcount undertaken prior to \n\nthe 2005 population census.  \n\n8   ADB.  2000.

Of  the  total  estimate  for  these  7 \nyears, 41.7% is expected to come from ADB and the World Bank.

The Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) identifies education as one of the four \nstrategic sectors in its draft Sixth Socio-Economic Development Plan (2006\u20132010) that feeds into its poverty reduction \nstrategy outlined in the National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy. To attain these objectives, the Government \nemphasizes  human  resource  development  enhancement  through  education  as  one  of  its  strategic  priorities.  In \nparticular, it prioritizes basic education, including formal and informal sector and vocational training. Better education \nand  training  helps  to  broaden  access  to  wage  opportunities,  enable  economic  diversification,  initiate  microbusiness \ndevelopment, and contribute to future reduction of gender disparities within households.  \n \nThe  Basic  Education  Sector  Development  Program  (BESDP)  contributes  to  poverty  reduction  and  economic \nintegration  within  the  region.  It  is  aligned  with  the  country  strategy  and  program  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB),  and  supports  the  education  sector  strategy  (Strategic  Vision  2001\u20132020)  and  implementation  of  the  second \nphase of the 20-year Strategic Vision (Education Sector Development Plan, 2006\u20132010). The BESDP also supports \nimplementation  of  the  National  Plan  of  Action  for  Education  For  All  (EFA  Plan,  2003\u20132015),  which  contains  the \nGovernment\u2019s  policy  and  strategic  action  framework  for  basic  education,  and  includes  national  development  targets \nand programs for four priority subsectors: (i) early childhood care and development, (ii) primary education, (iii) lower \nsecondary  education  (LSE),  and  (iv)  nonformal  education  and  skills  training.  The  EFA  Plan  highlights  for  LSE  (i) \nincreasing  access  to  basic  education  for  all  people,  especially  the  disadvantaged;  (ii)  strengthening  formal  and \nnonformal education; (iii) providing vocational and skills training; (iv) improving teachers\u2019 status and qualifications; (v) \nimproving the relevance and quality of school curriculum; and (vi) improving management of the education sector.  \n \nThe  BESDP  combines  two  lending  modalities  for  policy  support  and  direct  investment.  It  provides  policy  support  by \nemploying  a  program-based  approach  through  a  common  policy  matrix.  Through  its  policy  reform  interventions,  the \nBESDP  supports  Ministry  of  Education  (MOE)  initiatives  to  establish  a  sector  development  framework  that  will  help \nadopt  a  sector-wide  approach  to  education  sector  development.  The  investment  provides  direction  assistance  for  (i) \nimproving and expanding access to LSE opportunities; (ii) improving the quality of formal LSE; and (iii) strengthening \ndecentralized  education  planning,  management,  and  delivery.  The  BESDP  supports  education  reform  and \ndevelopment in the Lao PDR, and contributes to achievement of the Millennium Development Goals 2 and 3, and in \nthe long term, to goal 1 on poverty reduction. The BESDP will also help achieve the country\u2019s goal of exiting the status \nof least developed countries by 2020.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                               Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention-MDG \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe Lao PDR has undergone rapid economic development and growth over the last decade. Gross domestic product \n(GDP)  has  improved  with  an  average  GDP  per  capita  of  $207  (1990)  to  $428  (2004)  (National  Statistics  Center \nStatistics,  1975\u20132005).  In  2005,  the  country\u2019s  total  population  was  about  5.6  million,  of  which,  50.1%  were  female \n(Population and Housing Census, 2005). While the annual population growth rate declined from 2.5% (1985\u20131995) to \n2.0%  (1995\u20132005),  the  absolute  increase  of  population  was  1.04  million  (1995\u20132005)\u2014an  average  increase  of \n100,000  per  year.  Over  the  past  two  decades,  the  urban  population  increased  (from  17%\u201327%),  while  the  rural \ndecreased (from 83% to 73%).  \n \nWhile most socioeconomic indicators have consistently improved over the past few years, inequalities exist in social \nand economic development throughout the Lao PDR. The gap of inequality in income per capita seems to be widening \nbetween  urban  and  rural  areas.  Income  disparities  have  been  widening  between  provinces,  districts,  and  ethnic \ngroups,  with  the  most  vulnerable  groups  including  ethnic  groups  found  in  remote  rural  areas.  The  total  population \nunder the age of 15 decreased from 44% in 1995 to about 39%. About 57% of individuals (aged 15\u201364) are working\u2014\nan  increase  from  52%  in  1995.  Agricultural  workers  account  for  about  76%\u2014a  decrease  from  about  85%  in  1995 \n(Population and Housing Census, 2005). \n \nPoverty incidence (i.e., percentage of the population  with  consumption below the poverty line) dropped from 45% to \n38.6%  when  GDP  growth  averaged  7%  (Lao  Expenditure  and  Consumption  Survey  1992/93  and  1997/98).  At  the \nsame time, inequality increased with a Gini index increase from 29% to 36%. In 2002/03, poverty incidence dropped to \n32%. This reduction was associated with strong economic growth, achievement of rice self-sufficiency and increased \ncross-border trade. However, the Lao PDR remains a least developed country, as it ranks 131 out of 177 countries in \nthe  2005  Human  Development  Report  of  the  United  Nations  Development  Program.  Studies  suggest  that  education \nand literacy are key factors in achieving sustained economic growth, poverty reduction, and gender equality. An extra \nyear  of  schooling  is  seen  to  increase  labor  productivity  and  earning  potential.  Thus,  better  education  and  training \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n39 \n\n \n\nopportunities  are  vehicles  to  help  broaden  access  to  wage  opportunities,  enable  economic  diversification,  initiate \nmicrobusiness development, and contribute to reduction of poverty and gender disparities within households.  \n \nAccording  to  the  National  Growth  and  Poverty  Eradication  Strategy  (2004),  47  of  142  districts  are  categorized  as \n\u201cpoorest\u201d  districts.  Most  of  these  include  poor  ethnic  groups  located  in  rural  and  mountainous  areas.  Under  the \nBESDP,  20  districts  (of  50)  are  identified  for  investment  support  in  six  provinces\u2014Attapeu,  Bokeo,  Champasak, \nKhammuane, Luang Namtha and Savannakhet, Of the 20 districts, 10 are classified as poor, of which 7 are identified \nas the poorest. Selection of these districts is based on the Government\u2019s development priorities that give preference to \ndevelopment  along  the  economic  corridors  (East-West  Economic  Corridor  or  Route  R9\u2013Savannakhet,  and  Northern \nEconomic  Corridor  or  Route  R3\u2013Bokeo  and  Luang  Namtha);  around  Nam  Theun-II  (Khammuane),  and  in  the \nquadrangle corridor area that neighbors Cambodia, Thailand, and Viet Nam, (Attapeu and Champasak). The BESDP \nsupports all 159 lower and complete secondary schools in the 20 districts. \n \nWhile economic growth generates significant employment opportunities, poor households need sufficient resources to \nbe able to invest in human capital to be able to take advantage of these opportunities. The positive effect of economic \ngrowth on poverty reduction is also largely offset by regional and ethnic inequalities. Topography and low population \ndensity limit access to opportunities for the poor to escape from poverty. Disadvantaged ethnic groups are often found \nin  rural  and  remote  areas,  and  poverty  among  these  groups  is  associated  with  low  and  limited  access  to  education \nand  training  opportunities.  For  instance,  Attapeu    Bokeo,  and  Luang  Namtha  have  high  percentages  of  ethnic \npopulations  (and  poverty  incidence)  at  about  98%  (58%),  87%  (37%),  and  63%  (45%)  (Population  and  Housing \nCensus, 2005). The BESDP supports policy interventions and provides project support for increasing access to quality \neducation. For instance, the  BESDP  will help increase access  for students from poor families  with limited resources \nthrough the education development grant (EDG) program and lower secondary student grant (LSSG) scholarships for \nstudents in the catchment area of 96 lower/complete secondary schools in rural areas.  \n \nThe quality of education is a national concern. It is especially a concern for ethnic groups in rural areas due to (i) lack \nof infrastructure, (ii) inaccessibility, (iii) language and cultural barriers, (iv) lack or limited quality of teachers, (v) lack of \ntextbooks and teaching/learning materials, (vi) curricula that are not relevant to local situations, (vii) perceptions that \nreturns from education are low, and (viii) low household affordability (EFA Plan, 2005). Distance to the nearest school \nis  a  direct  deterrent  that  limits  access  to  LSE  for  poor  ethnic  students.  The  BESDP  will  address  these  issues  by \nincreasing supply (i.e., additional classrooms) and improving the quality of teachers (e.g., in-service teacher training). \nC.  Participation Process \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nThe National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy calls for increased participation by local residents in program \nplanning and implementation. Prime ministerial instructions 001 (March 2000) and 010 (June 2001) are relevant to the \nGovernment\u2019s  approach  to  poverty  reduction.  Provinces  are  seen  as  strategic  planning  units,  districts  are  project \nplanning and budgetary units, and villages are the implementation units responsible for collecting revenue based  on \nproduction  and  data  collection.  The  Government\u2019s  policy  documenta  on  governance  issues  also  supports  the \nimportance  of  people\u2019s  participation.  To  strengthen  MOE\u2019s  ability  to  decentralize  and  achieve  quality  education,  the \nfollowing  actions  are  necessary:  (i)  increase  resource  allocations;  (ii)  improve  data  collection  and  management;  (iii) \nprovide  institutional  strengthening  of  MOE,  provincial  education  services  (PESs),  and  district  education  bureaus \n(DEBs); and (iv) develop guidelines for education planning and management. b \n\n \nThe  DEBs  were  previously  responsible  for  education  activities  at  all  levels,  and  are  now  responsible  for  (i) \nkindergarten  and  primary  education,  including  nonformal  education  and  other  types  of  primary  education;  (ii) \nmanagement of education institutions above primary concerning nonacademic work; and (iii) planning, budgeting, and \nimplementation. The  PESs  are  responsible  for  (i)  lower  and  upper  secondary  education,  and  vocational  schools;  (ii) \nsupervision  of  the  DEBs;  (iii)  preparation  of  education  development  plans  with  the  DEBs;  (iv)  direction  of  plan \nimplementation; and (v) personnel, school, and student management within the province. The Department of Planning \nand  Cooperation  of  MOE  is  responsible  for  (i)  supervising  establishment  of  the  education  management  information \nsystem (EMIS), data collection, education mapping, and data analysis; and (ii) integrating the education strategic plan, \neducational development plan, and investment plan, including monitoring and evaluation of implemented plans.  \n \nA stakeholder analysis was conducted to determine key stakeholders within MOE, their responsibilities, and the roles \nthey play in the sector for overseeing issues of access, quality, and management in basic education (e.g., scholarship \nmanagement,  curriculum  development,  teacher  training,  gender  and  ethnic  mainstreaming,  and  maintenance  of  the \nEMIS). A task force within MOE was established at the onset of project preparation to ensure key stakeholders were \nconsulted  and  informed  on  preparation  progress.  National  workshops  included  stakeholders  from  different \nadministrative levels with MOE, line ministries, and development partners to discuss the policy matrix and investment \nproject. Consultations with lower/complete secondary schools staff was held within the BESDP\u2019s 20 targeted districts. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nA participation  strategy  is incorporated in the BESDP. The nature  of BESDP supports ongoing consultations  among \ndepartments within MOE, between MOE and other line ministries, between the central and administrative groups, and \nthe lower secondary schools. Participatory approaches and consultations will be used and are especially important for \nimplementing the EDG program and LSSG scholarships. Student-parent associations will be established/strengthened \nat each of the 96 lower or complete secondary schools that will receive an EDG.  \n\nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nWith  guidance  from  the  Lao  National  Commission  for  the  Advancement  of  Women,  all  ministries  plan  to  develop \nstrategies  and  action  plans  to  promote  national,  provincial,  district,  and  village  gender  equality  (Socio-Economic \nDevelopment  Plan:  vii).  Increasing  access  of  girls  and  women  to  quality  primary,  secondary,  and  territory  education \nand  adult  literacy  classes  is  cited  as  part  of  improving  access  to  basic  services.  MOE\u2019s  Gender  and  Ethnic  Groups \nEducation  Unit  has  prepared  a  gender  and  education  policy  and  submitted  it  to  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Office  for \napproval. \n \nIn 2005, educational attainment of employed females in the labor force was (i) 6.1% for lower secondary; (ii) 1.3% for \nupper  secondary;  and  (iii)  7.7%  for  technical/vocational  qualification,  college  diploma,  and  university  degree. \nEducational attainment  was comparatively higher for employed males: 8.6%, 2.2%, and 14.1%. A gender imbalance \nexists in accessing primary education and LSE. Girl\u2019s enrollment in primary school lags that of boys\u2019 by approximately \n14%, and in LSE by more than 12%. The net enrollment ratio for girls is also influenced by access in rural and urban \nareas: for primary education it is estimated at 49% for girls in rural areas without road access. (56% for boys), 72% in \nrural areas with road access (75% for boys), and 91% in urban areas (88% for boys). This leads to lower completion \nrates in primary education for girls (47%) compared with boys (52%). These differentials continue for lower and upper \nsecondary education.  \n \nThe  low  rate  of  female  enrolment  in  lower  secondary  school  leads  to  a  significantly  lower  number  of  female \nenrolments  in  teacher  training  colleges,  and  subsequently,  low  representation  in  the  field  of  teaching,  particularly  in \nlower  and  upper  secondary  schools.  Gender  equality  issues  need  to  be  better  integrated  and  addressed,  especially \nhuman  resource  development  issues  for  ethnic  groups,  in  official  education  and  training  policies,  teacher  training \nprogram development, and project activities.  \n \nThe BESDP will contribute to meeting these needs through a range of targeted activities and improvements to central \npolicies  and  practices  in  the  education  sector,  which  are  presented  in  the  common  policy  matrix.  The  investment \nProject includes specific activities that integrate gender issues and equity concerns into the BESDP. LSE curriculum \nreview  will  specifically  ensure  that  gender  issues  are  fully  captured  in  the  curriculum  and  teaching  methodology.  To \neffectively  address  gender  and  ethnic  education  concerns,  the  BESDP  will  address  gender  and  ethnic  issues  in \ndecentralized  education planning and budgeting. LSSG scholarships for ethnic girls in the poor and poorest districts \nwill  help  increase  access.  The  EDG  program  will  work  to  build  the  capacity  of  the  student-parent  association  at  the \nschool to improve the condition and strengthen the management of lower secondary schools. Civil works will cater to \nbuilding school-safe and gender-sensitive school facilities (i.e., separate toilets). Targets will be set to increase female \nrepresentation  in  management  positions  within  the  education  sector.  In  addition,  activities  to  improve  management \nand planning in the education sector will be included (i.e., sex- and ethnic-disaggregated data).  \n\nHas an output been prepared? \n    Yes \nE.

The GEGDP aims at achieving \nequity, reducing gender and sociocultural disparities, overcoming barriers and obstacles for girls \nand ethnic groups, and ensuring equal access to better and high quality LSE and skills training. \nIt is based on (i) a gender analysis, (ii) an analysis of ethnic groups, (iii) primary and secondary \ndata collection, (iv) consultations with girls and boys in lower secondary schools from different \nethnic  groups,  and  (v)  discussions  with  government  officials  and  mass  organizations.  It  builds \nupon ongoing initiatives carried out in previous Asian Development Bank (ADB)-funded projects, \nfollowing \nto \ngeographically targeted remote ethnic group areas, especially where gender disparities tend to \nbe  larger;  (ii)  promote  participation  of  ethnic  groups  and  females  in  project  activities;  (iii) \npromote  gender-  and  ethnic-sensitive  curriculum,  materials,  and  policy  and  strategy \ndevelopment; (iv) address needs and constraints of ethnic students, female students, teachers, \ngovernment  officials,  and  project  staff;  and  (v)  strengthen  capacity  of  relevant  institutions  that \naddress ethnic and gender concerns and equality in education. The GEGDP follows regulations \nof  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR),  and  ADB\u2019s  policies  on  gender  and \ndevelopment (2003) and indigenous peoples (1998). \n\nthese  basic  principles:  (i)  where  possible,  prioritize  resource  allocation \n\nA. \n\nOverview of Gender and Ethnic Groups \n\n2. \nThe  Lao  PDR  is  a  diverse  and  multiethnic  state;  49  distinct  ethnic  groups  are  grouped \ninto  four  main  ethnolinguistic  groups:  (i)  Tai-Kadai  comprises  8  ethnic  groups  (66.2%);  (ii) \nAustro-Asiatic,  32  ethnic  groups  (23%),  (iii)  Hmong-Yu  Mien,  2  ethnic  groups  (7.4%),  and  (iv) \nSino-Tibetan,  7  ethnic  groups  (2.7%).2 The  distribution  of  ethnic  population  in  the  six  BESDP \nprovinces is in Table A6.1. \n\nTable A6.1: Percentage of Ethnic Groups by BESDP Province \n\nProvince \n\nPopulation \n\n% \n\n% \n\nThird Group \n\n% \n\nAttapeu \nBokeo \nChampasak \nKhammuane \nLuang Namtha \nSavannakhet \n    Total \n\n87,229 \n113,612 \n501,387 \n272,463 \n114,741 \n671,758 \n1,761,190 \nBESDP = Basic Education Sector Development Program. \nSource: Lao Front for National Construction, Department of Ethnic Affairs, 1999. \n\n36.9 \n23.8 \n84.8 \n59.4 \n24.7 \n57.5 \n \n\n17.4 \n20.6 \n4.9 \n21.7 \n23.9 \n18.9 \n \n\n  Oey \n  Lao \n  Xuay \n  Makong \n  Leu \n  Katang \n\n \n\nLargest \nGroup \nLao \nKhmu \nLao \nLao \nKhmu \nLao \n \n\nSecond \nGroup \nLavae \nLue \nLaven \nPhutai \nKor \nPhutai \n \n\n% Total \nEthnic  \n63.1 \n86.6 \n15.2 \n40.6 \n97.7 \n42.5 \n \n\n16.4 \n13.4 \n2.4 \n13.4 \n15.8 \n8.7 \n \n\n3. \nOf 142 districts in 18 provinces, 47 districts are categorized as the poorest districts. Most \nhave ethnic groups located in rural and mountainous areas. Geographic, economic, and cultural \nconstraints often result in limited education and health services for ethnic groups. According to \nthe census, ethnic groups often have poorer housing and sanitary conditions, lesser access to \nroads and markets, and poorer health and education. Ethnic communities may not value social \nservices,  and  social  service  providers  may  have  limited  understanding  of  ethnic  needs  and \nvalues. Poverty among ethnic groups is closely associated with limited access to education and \n\n                                                 \n1   During  preparation  of  the  BESDP,  ethnic  groups  from  three  ethnolinguistic  groups  of  Austro-Asiatic,  Hmong-Yu \nMien,  and  Sino-Tibetan  were  identified  as  the  relevant  ethnic  groups  for  this  action  plan,  as  required  by  ADB\u2019s \nindigenous peoples policy.

More  than  85%  of  Lao \nwomen live and work in farming households, and perform the bulk of household work. Children, \nespecially  girls,  help  in  agricultural  and  domestic  duties  (i.e.,  water  collection,  child  care). \nChildren  residing  at  greater  distances  from  schools,  especially  in  the  poor  and  poorest \nprovinces, have more limited access to education than those in urban areas. Issues of access, \ncost of education (e.g., school fees), safety, and teaching quality are some factors that influence \nparents\u2019 decisions on sending their children to school. Thus the opportunity cost of sending girls \nto lower secondary schools is more significant. \n\nB. \n\nLegal Framework and Regulations \n\nThe Constitution of the Lao PDR, ratified in 1991, uses the term \u201ccitizens of all ethnicity\u201d \n5. \nthroughout  the  document.
