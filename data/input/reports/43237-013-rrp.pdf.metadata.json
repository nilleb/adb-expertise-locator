THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Urban Climate \nChange Resilience Trust Fund1 under the Urban Financing Partnership Facility, both to the \nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Urban Environment and Climate Change Adaptation \nProject.2 \n \n2.  The project will improve urban environmental conditions in Dong Hoi and Hoi An cities \nthrough capacity development, and the construction and upgrading of infrastructure facilities. \nThe project will adopt climate-proof infrastructure designs, and a combination of structural and \nnonstructural measures that promote adaptation to climate change.3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Urban environmental issues. The main challenges facing cities in Viet Nam arise from \nthe lack of infrastructure investment and the limited ability of local governments to provide reliable \nand affordable urban services. There are no clear linkages between the local socioeconomic \ndevelopment plan, spatial plan, and urban subsector master plans, while the inability to recover \nthe cost of providing municipal services causes poor operation and maintenance (O&M) of urban \ninfrastructure. This results in missing links in the road network, obsolete water supply systems and \nhigh water losses, floods and clogged drains, and uncontrolled disposal of untreated waste, with \nthe result that cities are less competitive and livable. Lack of infrastructure and limited capacity to \nmanage urban services discourage external investments, which are critical to socioeconomic \ndevelopment and growth. \n \n4.  Climate change issues. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, \nsince  the  mid-1960s,  the  average  sea  level  has  risen  20  centimeters  and  the  average \ntemperature  has  increased  0.5\u20130.7  degrees  in  Viet  Nam.  Sea  level  rise  intensifies  flood \ndamage; during 2001\u20132010, natural disasters have resulted in damage equal to about 1.5% of \nannual gross domestic product (GDP). Sea level rise and potential changes in storm intensity \nare likely to increase the unpredictability of (and most likely exacerbate) natural disasters. As a \nresult of climate change, Viet Nam\u2019s yearly mean temperature is expected to rise 2\u20133 degrees \nCelsius, with sea level 75\u2013100 centimeters higher than 1980\u20131999 levels, at the end of this \ncentury. It is estimated that 10%\u201312% of Viet Nam\u2019s population will be directly affected and the \ncountry will lose around 10% of GDP. \n \n5.  Importance of secondary cities development. Metropolitan areas that receive large \ninflows of migrants are becoming more congested and experiencing increasingly serious social \nand environmental problems. At the same time, secondary cities are stagnating. According to the \ngovernment\u2019s General Statistics Office, the urban population in five municipalities accounts for \nover 40% of the country\u2019s total urban population of nearly 30 million, while over 70% of secondary \ncities have a population under 300,000.4 If the trend continues, the resulting spatial and economic \n                                                \n1  Financing partners: the Rockefeller Foundation and the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  The  Asian  Development  Bank  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  Preparing  the  Urban \nEnvironment and Climate Change Adaptation Project (TA8171-VIE). \n4  The five centrally-controlled cities which stand on the same administrative level as provinces are Can Tho, Da \nNang, Ha Noi, Hai Phong, and Ho Chi Minh City. \n ", "2            \ndisparities  will  further  constrain  urban  development,  social  stability,  and  national  economic \ndevelopment. In line with the government\u2019s decentralization policy, infrastructure investments in \nsecondary  cities  will  help  attract  or  retain  residents,  possibly  reducing  migration  to  large \nmetropolitan cities. Steering growth away from metropolitan areas and toward secondary cities \nwould result in more balanced regional development. \n \n6.  Choice of project cities. Dong Hoi city in Quang Binh province and Hoi An city in \nQuang Nam province have been identified as project cities. Both are located in the North \nCentral  and  South  Central  Coastal regions,  which  historically  have  been  one  of  the most \ndisaster-prone areas in Viet Nam, threatened repeatedly by floods and typhoons. \n \n7.  Dong Hoi (the capital of Quang Binh province) had a population of 113,900 in 2010, and \nan average annual growth rate of about 1.8% during 2005\u20132010. The city is located in a narrow \ncoastal strip 49 kilometers from the border with the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic.The city \nis an important tourism center, with long beaches and the Phong Nha and Ke Bang caves, \nwhich  were  listed  as  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural  Organization \n(UNESCO) World Heritage sites in 2003. Dong Hoi was heavily bombed in 1972 and almost all \nits infrastructure destroyed. Reconstruction has been slow because of financial constraints. The \nlocal climate change resilience action plan was developed with support from the World Bank to \nimprove resilience to the potential effects of climate change and natural disasters. A set of \nshort- to long-term structural and nonstructural measures were designed under the action plan. \n \n8.  Hoi An has 92,000 inhabitants, and an average annual population growth rate of about \n2.5%. Hoi An is a well-preserved example of a Southeast Asian trading port from the 15th to \n19th century, and a UNESCO World Heritage site. The economy is dominated by the service \nsector, which accounted for over 60% of the city\u2019s GDP in 2011. Annual GDP growth in 2010\u2013\n2013 was over 11%. Tourism has brought important economic benefits, but also negative \nenvironmental impacts such as increased amounts of garbage and wastewater, and further \ngrowth is considered unsustainable without significant environmental investments. The climate \nchange adaptive ecocity development concept aims to increase the city\u2019s attraction as a tourist \ndestination and transform Hoi An into a green, clean, and safe city. The key strategy is to \ndevelop  climate  change-resilient  spatial  plans  and  infrastructure  designs  that  will  mitigate \ndamage from natural disasters and protect the environment. \n \n9.  Aligned  with  related  policies  and  strategies.  The  project  is  in  line  with  the \ngovernment\u2019s  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan  (SEDP)  2011\u20132015  aims  to  create  the \nfoundation for Viet Nam to become an industrialized country by 2020.5 The SEDP emphasizes \nthe importance of environmental protection, natural disaster prevention, and climate change \nadaptation through (i) improved land use planning and management; (ii) the establishment of \nmonitoring, forecasting, and warning systems for natural disasters; and (iii) increased public \nawareness  of  environmental  protection  and  climate  change  adaptation.  Development  of \nsecondary cities is also a priority area of the SEDP\u2014secondary cities are expected to be the \nregional centers for social and economic development through investments in basic urban \nservices. The project is also in line with the country partnership strategy for Viet Nam of the \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) that supports assistance to help cities attract business and \ninvestment by defining their development vision and identifying their advantages as new growth \nhubs. 6  It  encourages  comprehensive  socioeconomic  development  in  secondary  cities, \n                                                \n5  SEDP  2011\u20132015  was  developed  to  realize  the  long-term  development  objectives  of  the  Socio-Economic \nDevelopment Strategy for 2011\u20132020. \n6  ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: Viet Nam, 2012\u20132015. Manila. \n ", "3 \nparticularly border cities and those along Greater Mekong Subregion corridors, as well as \ncoastal  cities  that  need  to  prepare  for  the  possible  early  impacts  of  climate  change.  The \nproposed project will support ADB\u2019s urban sector assessment, strategy, and road map for Viet \nNam that seeks to develop secondary cities through a focus on (i) assisting local governments \nin strategic city development planning, (ii) investing in the upgrade and expansion of priority \nurban infrastructure, and (iii) establishing clearly defined institutional arrangements and building \nnecessary local capacities. The proposed project is aligned with ADB\u2019s urban operational plan \n2012\u20132020,7 which seeks to catalyze a new form of climate-friendly, climate-resilient, inclusive, \ncompetitive, and environmentally sustainable urban development by improving urban systems, \nmaking them financially sustainable, and maximizing the urban contribution to development. \n \n10.  Lessons. The completion reports of previous urban development and water projects in \nViet Nam have provided the following lessons: (i) implement advance actions and apply project \nreadiness  filters  to  minimize  start-up  delays,  particularly  recruitment  of  consultants;  (ii) \nimplement tariff reform to recover O&M costs and ensure the sustainability of project facilities; \nand (iii) promote strong ownership and involvement of the provincial government agencies in \nproject design and implementation.8 These lessons were studied during project preparation and \nincorporated in the project design. \n \n11.  Special  features.  The  project  is  the  first  urban  development  project  for  provincial \ngovernments that uses ADB loan funds relent from the central government, and features (i) \ndesigns that incorporate climate-proofing, such as protection of water resources from salinity \nintrusion, and creation of green riparian buffer zones to retain water during floods; and (ii) \ncomplementary  structural  and  nonstructural  measures,  with  the  latter  including  a  flood \nforecasting and warning system, and zoning and vegetation planting to protect the coastal dune \ncomplex. In addition, at the government\u2019s request, ADB conducted a fiscal analysis of the \nproject provinces to help the Ministry of Finance appraise their financial capacity; this approach \ncan be applied to future projects in Viet Nam that involve relending to the provinces. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The project\u2019s expected impact will be improved urban environments in Dong Hoi and Hoi \nAn. The outcome of the project will be greater access to improved urban services in Dong Hoi \nand Hoi An. \n \nC.  Outputs \n13.  The  outputs  will  include:  (i)  new  and  improved  climate  change-resilient  urban \ninfrastructure in Dong Hoi, (ii) new and improved climate change-resilient urban infrastructure in \nHoi An, and (iii) improved competency in urban environmental management and climate change \nadaptation. Output 1 will comprise (i) a Bao Ninh urban development component that will help \ndevelop a new urban area in the Bao Ninh peninsula by creating a climate-change resilient \nurban plan, constructing basic infrastructure, and protecting the coastal dune complex from \nerosion; and (ii) a wastewater management component that will construct tertiary sewerage \nnetworks  and  household  connections  to  complement  a  World  Bank-funded  project  that  is \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2013.

Commitment charges for an ADB loan are \n0.15% per year to be charged on the undisbursed loan amount. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n15.  The government  has requested  a  loan  of $100  million from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25.5-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 6 years, straight-line method, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of \n0.15% per year, the interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in the loan, \n                                                \n9  The World Bank approved a loan in the amount equivalent to $124.7 million in December 2006 and additional \nfinancing in the amount equivalent to $65.3 million in February 2011. \n ", "5 \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. Based \non this, the average loan maturity is 16 years and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.1% \nper annum.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n20.  The project facilities have been designed using demand projections that are based on \nrealistic population projections using current urban growth rates. Alternative technical options \nwere analyzed for each project facility and the optimum design solutions identified. In reviewing \nthe  alternatives,  consideration  was  given to  improvement  of overall project  implementation \nefficiency, cost effectiveness (covering both capital and operating costs), use of appropriate \ntechnology within the capacity of local government agencies, and reduction of negative social \nand  environmental  impacts.  Technical  feasibility  and  environmental  soundness  have  been \nconfirmed for the dredging of Phap Bao Lake (output 2.2a) and Lai Nghi reservoir (output 2.3a). \nThe designs and the O&M plan have been prepared based on appropriate standards to ensure \nsustainability. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n21.  Economic analysis. An economic analysis was conducted of the individual outputs as \nwell as the overall project, including the cost of improved urban environmental management and \nclimate change adaptation, and confirms that both Dong Hoi and Hoi An outputs, and the overall \n ", "7 \nproject are economically viable.12 The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the investment \nin Dong Hoi is estimated at 18.4%, with an economic net present value (ENPV) at a 12% \ndiscount rate of $17.5 million, while the EIRR of the investment in Hoi An is 13.2% with an \nENPV of $7.8 million. The overall project EIRR is estimated at 14.8% with an ENPV of $27.8 \nmillion. Sensitivity tests indicate that the overall project is sensitive to an increase in cost or \ndecrease in benefits, and to a delay in benefits. Under the most adverse condition (a 10% cost \nincrease combined with a 10% benefit decrease), the EIRR is reduced to 12.5%. \n \n22.  Financial  analysis.  Fiscal  analysis  of  Quang  Binh  and  Quang  Nam  PPCs  was \nundertaken for all components in Quang Binh and for the Co Co River and flood management \nand coastal protection components in Quang Nam.13 For each PPC, recurrent costs, including \ndebt service and operating expenses, were projected, and the fiscal performance during 2009\u2013\n2013 analyzed to assess the PPC\u2019s capacity to cover these costs. Both PPCs should have the \ncapacity to meet their obligations without additional balance transfers from the government, \nalthough capital expenditure spending should be closely monitored to ensure other investment \nprojects do not impair their ability to meet recurrent costs under the project. A cost\u2013benefit \nanalysis  was  undertaken  to assess the financial viability of the water supply  improvement \ncomponent,  which  is  being  implemented  by the  Quang  Nam WSDC and  intended  to fully \nrecover all costs from water revenues. The financial internal rate of return of this component is \n11.9%, which is in excess of the weighted average cost of capital of 0.7%. \n \nC.  Governance \n23.  The risk rating for financial management is medium based on the financial management \nassessment, which focused on accounting and auditing procedures and staff expertise. The \nexisting financial information system (i.e., accounting, reporting, and internal control system) is \ncomplete and applicable to domestic construction entities. The Quang Binh URENCO and \nQuang Nam WSDC have experience in infrastructure projects financed by both domestic and \ninternational funds. Quang Binh URENCO and Quang Nam WSDC have not implemented an \nADB-funded project, while Quang Binh PPC and Quang Nam PPC have done so. Training on \nADB  disbursement  procedures  and  advanced  financial  management  will  be  conducted  to \nensure success of project implementation. \n \n24.  A procurement capacity assessment of the executing and implementing agencies has \nbeen undertaken in Dong Hoi and Hoi An. Both implementing agencies (i) have experience in \nundertaking  large  development  partner-funded  projects,  including  some  using  international \ncompetitive bidding procedures; and (ii) lack extensive experience with ADB procurement and \nthe operation of imprest accounts, with disbursement often being slow in comparison with initial \nestimates.  Based  on  the  assessment,  the  procurement  plan  was  prepared  (including  the \nthresholds and review procedures; contract packages for goods, works, and consulting services; \nand national competitive bidding guidelines) and included in the PAM (footnote 11). Training on \nADB\u2019s procurement requirements will be conducted as part of the project administration and \nimplementation training under output 3. \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the Quang Binh and Quang Nam PPCs, and relevant sections will be \nincluded  in  all  documents  and  contracts  relating  to  procurement.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 11). \n                                                \n12  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8            \nD.  Poverty and Social \n26.  A  social,  poverty,  and  gender  analysis  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB \nguidelines. Information collected contributed to the project design, ensured social inclusion of \nthe poor and economically vulnerable, and supported the need for measures to mitigate the \nimpacts of climate change on the urban and peri-urban populations. The project is classified as \ngeneral intervention. The project will benefit a combined population of about 206,000 residents \nin Dong Hoi and Hoi An, including about 1,000 poor households, half of which are headed by \nwomen. Poor households that cannot afford to connect to a wastewater system will be assisted \nthrough a revolving fund managed by the Women\u2019s Union in Dong Hoi.14 \n \n27.  The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. The gender action plan \nfocuses  on  increasing  women\u2019s  participation  in  decision  making  at  all  levels  of  urban \ngovernance and service provision through female participation in project capacity development \nplans and training sessions.15 Capacity development will be developed based on gender equity, \nwith women comprising at least 30% of all session participants. The project will support female \ngovernment staff and women\u2019s unions to develop their knowledge of climate change impacts \nand adaptation measures. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n28.  Environment.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). The proposed project is not expected to cause irreversible \nadverse environmental impacts. Two initial environmental examinations were conducted for \nDong  Hoi  and  Hoi  An.  Mitigation  measures  for  identified  impacts  are  included  in  the \nenvironment management plans (EMPs).16 In addition, the potential impacts of climate change \nand natural hazards are recommended for integration into the detailed engineering design. The \ninitial environmental examinations were approved by the Quang Binh PPC for Dong Hoi and the \nMinistry of Natural Resources and Environment for Hoi An (because of the city\u2019s status as a \nUNESCO World Heritage site). The finalized EMPs based on the detailed engineering design \nand cleared by ADB will form part of the bidding documents. EMP implementation will be \nensured by a designated environment officer in each PMU. Effective environmental monitoring \nat  all  stages  of  project  implementation  will  be  ensured.  Stakeholder  consultations  were \nconducted  through  formal  and  informal  focus  group  discussions,  and  grievance  redress \nmechanisms have also been established. In compliance with ADB\u2019s information disclosure and \nconsultation requirements, the safeguard documents have been posted on ADB\u2019s website. \n \n29.  Involuntary resettlement. The safeguard category for involuntary resettlement is A, in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. Two resettlement plans, one each for Dong \nHoi and Hoi An, have been prepared for the components with land acquisition and resettlement \nimpacts.17 For Dong Hoi, 173,940 square meters of land will be permanently acquired, and 375 \nhouseholds with 1,550 persons will be affected. For Hoi An, 711,374 square meters of land will \nbe  permanently  acquired,  and  645  households  with  2,580  persons  will  be  affected.  In \ncombination, there will be 539 severely affected households (with approximately 2,264 affected \n                                                \n14 The revolving fund is regularly audited by the Quang Binh PPC financed under the World Bank funded project \n(footnote 9). \n15 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 Initial Environmental Examination: Dong Hoi City; Initial Environmental Examination: Hoi An City (accessible from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Resettlement Plan: Dong Hoi City; Resettlement Plan: Hoi An City (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n ", "9 \npersons). In Dong Hai, 52 affected households (approximately 218 affected persons) will be \nrequired to relocate. In Hoi An, 311 affected households (approximately 1,306 affected persons) \nare estimated to lose more than 10% of their total productive land holding, and 176 affected \nhouseholds (approximately 739 affected persons) will be required to relocate. All other impacts \nare partial and temporary. The cost of land acquisition and resettlement that will be financed by \nthe government is estimated to be about $27.8 million, which includes base costs, allowances, \nadministration, and contingencies. A cutoff date with extensive stakeholder consultation and \nparticipation has been established and will be officially announced by the PPCs after the project \nhas been approved. Project information has been disclosed to affected persons throughout \nproject preparation. The public information booklet, which was distributed to affected persons \nduring project preparation, will be updated and redistributed to affected households during the \ndetailed measurement survey. \n \n30.  Resettlement documents have been prepared in consultation with local communities and \nare in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and the government\u2019s laws and \nregulations. The documents have been endorsed, approved, and posted on the ADB website. A \ngrievance redress mechanism will help facilitate resolution of complaints on resettlement, the \nenvironment, and other project-related issues. The resettlement plans will be updated and \ndisclosed after detailed engineering design, and cleared by ADB prior to contract awards. \nEffective monitoring at all stages of project implementation will be ensured. \n \n31.  Indigenous peoples. Indigenous people safeguards are not triggered by any project \ncomponents in Dong Hoi or Hoi An, and the safeguard category for indigenous peoples is C, in \naccordance with the requirements outlined in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement; hence no \nseparate indigenous peoples plans are required to be prepared. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n32.  The  overall  assessment  of  the  project  risks  is  rated  medium.  Both  implementing \nagencies have experience in infrastructure projects financed by  domestic and international \nfunds although they have not implemented an ADB-funded project. The integrated benefits and \nimpacts  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  costs.  Major  risks  and  mitigation  measures  are \nsummarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management \nplan.18 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nStakeholders in the river basins do  As part of the project, basin-level workshops will be held to \nnot cooperate to operationalize the  ensure involvement of stakeholders in and their commitment to \nflood warning and management  the design and implementation of the flood warning and \nsystem in Hoi An.  management system. \nIndividual developers in the Bao  Strict adherence to dune protection measures will be ensured \nNinh new urban area do not follow  through a review of developers\u2019 EIA reports by the PMU, \nthe measures to protect the coastal  supported by the project implementation support consultant. \ndune complex to be developed  DONRE will ensure that all recommendations are included in \nunder the project.  the developers\u2019 EIA reports, and will not grant licenses to \noperate to such developers in the Bao Ninh new urban area. \n \n \n                                                \n18 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10            \n \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInadequate subsidies are provided  Required subsidies were estimated under the project \nfor wastewater management in  preparatory technical assistance.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n33.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM \nand loan documents. \n \n34.  The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are \nset forth in the loan, grant, and project agreements. \n \n35.  The government has agreed that no withdrawals will be made from the loan and grant \naccounts until \n(i)  the Quang Binh PPC sets up a PMU and enters into a subsidiary loan agreement \nwith the government, upon terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB; and \n(ii)  the Quang Nam PPC sets up a PMU and enters into a subsidiary loan agreement \nwith the government, upon terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB; and the \nQuang Nam WSDC enters into a subsidiary loan agreement with the government, \nupon terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. \n \nV.
