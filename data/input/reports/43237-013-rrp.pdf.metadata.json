The main challenges facing cities in Viet Nam arise from \nthe lack of infrastructure investment and the limited ability of local governments to provide reliable \nand  affordable  urban  services.  There  are  no  clear  linkages  between  the  local  socioeconomic \ndevelopment  plan,  spatial  plan,  and  urban  subsector master  plans,  while  the  inability  to  recover \nthe cost of providing municipal services causes poor operation and maintenance (O&M) of urban \ninfrastructure. This results in missing links in the road network, obsolete water supply systems and \nhigh water losses, floods and clogged drains, and uncontrolled disposal of untreated waste, with \nthe result that cities are less competitive and livable. Lack of infrastructure and limited capacity to \nmanage  urban  services  discourage  external  investments,  which  are  critical  to  socioeconomic \ndevelopment and growth. \n \nClimate change issues. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, \n4. \nsince  the  mid-1960s,  the  average  sea  level  has  risen  20  centimeters  and  the  average \ntemperature  has  increased  0.5\u20130.7  degrees  in  Viet  Nam.  Sea  level  rise  intensifies  flood \ndamage; during 2001\u20132010, natural disasters have resulted in damage equal to about 1.5% of \nannual  gross  domestic  product  (GDP).  Sea  level  rise  and  potential  changes  in  storm  intensity \nare likely to increase the unpredictability of (and most likely exacerbate) natural disasters. As a \nresult of climate change, Viet Nam\u2019s yearly mean temperature  is expected to rise 2\u20133 degrees \nCelsius,  with  sea  level  75\u2013100  centimeters  higher  than  1980\u20131999  levels,  at  the  end  of  this \ncentury. It is estimated that 10%\u201312% of Viet Nam\u2019s population will be directly affected and the \ncountry will lose around 10% of GDP. \n \n5. \nImportance  of  secondary  cities  development.  Metropolitan  areas  that  receive  large \ninflows  of  migrants  are  becoming  more  congested  and  experiencing  increasingly  serious  social \nand environmental problems. At the same time, secondary cities are stagnating. According to the \ngovernment\u2019s  General  Statistics  Office,  the  urban  population  in  five  municipalities  accounts  for \nover 40% of the country\u2019s total urban population of nearly 30 million, while over 70% of secondary \ncities have a population under 300,000.4 If the trend continues, the resulting spatial and economic \n\n                                                \n1  Financing partners: the Rockefeller Foundation and the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  The  Asian  Development  Bank  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  Preparing  the  Urban \n\nEnvironment and Climate Change Adaptation Project (TA8171-VIE). \n\n4  The  five  centrally-controlled  cities  which  stand  on  the  same  administrative  level  as  provinces  are  Can  Tho,  Da \n\nNang, Ha Noi, Hai Phong, and Ho Chi Minh City. \n\n \n\n\f2            \n\ndisparities  will  further  constrain  urban  development,  social  stability,  and  national  economic \ndevelopment.  In  line  with  the  government\u2019s  decentralization  policy,  infrastructure  investments  in \nsecondary  cities  will  help  attract  or  retain  residents,  possibly  reducing  migration  to  large \nmetropolitan  cities.  Steering  growth  away  from  metropolitan  areas  and  toward  secondary  cities \nwould result in more balanced regional development. \n \n6. \nChoice  of  project  cities.  Dong  Hoi  city  in  Quang  Binh  province  and  Hoi  An  city  in \nQuang  Nam  province  have  been  identified  as  project  cities.  Both  are  located  in  the  North \nCentral  and  South  Central  Coastal  regions,  which  historically  have  been  one  of  the  most \ndisaster-prone areas in Viet Nam, threatened repeatedly by floods and typhoons. \n \n7. \nDong Hoi (the capital of Quang Binh province) had a population of 113,900 in 2010, and \nan average annual growth rate of about 1.8% during 2005\u20132010. The city is located in a narrow \ncoastal strip 49 kilometers from the border with the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic.The city \nis  an  important  tourism  center,  with  long  beaches  and  the  Phong  Nha  and  Ke  Bang  caves, \nwhich  were  listed  as  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural  Organization \n(UNESCO) World Heritage sites in 2003. Dong Hoi was heavily bombed in 1972 and almost all \nits infrastructure destroyed. Reconstruction has been slow because of financial constraints. The \nlocal climate change resilience action plan was developed with support from the World Bank to \nimprove  resilience  to  the  potential  effects  of  climate  change  and  natural  disasters.  A  set  of \nshort- to long-term structural and nonstructural measures were designed under the action plan. \n \n8. \nHoi An has 92,000 inhabitants, and an average annual population growth rate  of about \n2.5%.  Hoi  An  is  a  well-preserved  example  of  a  Southeast  Asian  trading  port  from  the  15th  to \n19th  century,  and  a  UNESCO  World  Heritage  site.  The  economy  is  dominated  by  the  service \nsector, which accounted for over 60% of the city\u2019s GDP in 2011. Annual GDP growth in 2010\u2013\n2013  was  over  11%.  Tourism  has  brought  important  economic  benefits,  but  also  negative \nenvironmental  impacts  such  as  increased  amounts  of  garbage  and  wastewater,  and  further \ngrowth is  considered  unsustainable without significant  environmental  investments. The  climate \nchange adaptive ecocity development concept aims to increase the city\u2019s attraction as a tourist \ndestination  and  transform  Hoi  An  into  a  green,  clean,  and  safe  city.  The  key  strategy  is  to \ndevelop  climate  change-resilient  spatial  plans  and  infrastructure  designs  that  will  mitigate \ndamage from natural disasters and protect the environment. \n \n9. \nAligned  with  related  policies  and  strategies.  The  project  is  in  line  with  the \ngovernment\u2019s  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan  (SEDP)  2011\u20132015  aims  to  create  the \nfoundation for Viet Nam to become an industrialized country by 2020.5 The SEDP emphasizes \nthe  importance  of  environmental  protection,  natural  disaster  prevention,  and  climate  change \nadaptation  through  (i)  improved  land  use  planning  and  management;  (ii)  the  establishment  of \nmonitoring,  forecasting,  and  warning  systems  for  natural  disasters;  and  (iii)  increased  public \nawareness  of  environmental  protection  and  climate  change  adaptation.  Development  of \nsecondary  cities  is  also a  priority  area  of  the  SEDP\u2014secondary  cities  are  expected  to  be  the \nregional  centers  for  social  and  economic  development  through  investments  in  basic  urban \nservices.  The  project  is  also  in  line  with  the  country  partnership  strategy  for  Viet  Nam  of  the \nAsian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  that  supports  assistance  to  help  cities  attract  business  and \ninvestment by defining their development vision and identifying their advantages as new growth \nhubs. 6  It  encourages  comprehensive  socioeconomic  development \nin  secondary  cities, \n\n                                                \n5  SEDP  2011\u20132015  was  developed  to  realize  the  long-term  development  objectives  of  the  Socio-Economic \n\nDevelopment Strategy for 2011\u20132020. \n\n6   ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: Viet Nam, 2012\u20132015. Manila. \n\n \n\n\fparticularly  border  cities  and  those  along  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  corridors,  as  well  as \ncoastal  cities  that  need  to  prepare  for  the  possible  early  impacts  of  climate  change.  The \nproposed project will support ADB\u2019s urban sector assessment, strategy, and road map for Viet \nNam that seeks to develop secondary cities through a focus on (i) assisting local governments \nin  strategic  city  development  planning,  (ii)  investing  in  the  upgrade  and  expansion  of  priority \nurban infrastructure, and (iii) establishing clearly defined institutional arrangements and building \nnecessary local capacities. The proposed project is aligned with ADB\u2019s  urban operational plan \n2012\u20132020,7 which seeks to catalyze a new form of climate-friendly, climate-resilient, inclusive, \ncompetitive, and environmentally sustainable urban development by improving urban systems, \nmaking them financially sustainable, and maximizing the urban contribution to development. \n \n10. \nLessons.  The completion reports of previous urban development and water projects in \nViet Nam have provided the following lessons: (i) implement advance actions and apply project \nreadiness  filters  to  minimize  start-up  delays,  particularly  recruitment  of  consultants;  (ii) \nimplement tariff reform to recover  O&M costs and ensure the sustainability of project facilities; \nand  (iii)  promote  strong  ownership  and  involvement  of  the  provincial  government  agencies  in \nproject design and implementation.8 These lessons were studied during project preparation and \nincorporated in the project design. \n \n11. \nSpecial  features.  The  project  is  the  first  urban  development  project  for  provincial \ngovernments  that  uses  ADB  loan  funds  relent  from  the  central  government,  and  features  (i) \ndesigns  that  incorporate  climate-proofing,  such  as  protection  of  water  resources  from  salinity \nintrusion,  and  creation  of  green  riparian  buffer  zones  to  retain  water  during  floods;  and  (ii) \ncomplementary  structural  and  nonstructural  measures,  with  the  latter  including  a  flood \nforecasting and warning system, and zoning and vegetation planting to protect the coastal dune \ncomplex.  In  addition,  at  the  government\u2019s  request,  ADB  conducted  a  fiscal  analysis  of  the \nproject provinces to help the Ministry of Finance appraise their financial capacity; this approach \ncan be applied to future projects in Viet Nam that involve relending to the provinces. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n12. \nThe project\u2019s expected impact will be improved urban environments in Dong Hoi and Hoi \nAn. The outcome of the project will be greater access to improved urban services in Dong Hoi \nand Hoi An. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n13. \nThe  outputs  will  include:  (i)  new  and  improved  climate  change-resilient  urban \ninfrastructure in Dong Hoi, (ii) new and improved climate change-resilient urban infrastructure in \nHoi An, and (iii) improved competency in urban environmental management and climate change \nadaptation. Output 1 will comprise (i)  a Bao Ninh urban development component that will help \ndevelop  a  new  urban  area  in  the  Bao  Ninh  peninsula  by  creating  a  climate-change  resilient \nurban  plan,  constructing  basic  infrastructure,  and  protecting  the  coastal  dune  complex  from \nerosion;  and  (ii)  a  wastewater  management  component  that  will  construct  tertiary  sewerage \nnetworks  and  household  connections  to  complement  a  World  Bank-funded  project  that  is \n\n                                                \n7  ADB. 2013.

Alternative  technical  options \nwere analyzed for each project facility and the optimum design solutions identified. In reviewing \nthe  alternatives,  consideration  was  given  to  improvement  of  overall  project  implementation \nefficiency,  cost  effectiveness  (covering  both  capital  and  operating  costs),  use  of  appropriate \ntechnology  within  the  capacity  of  local  government  agencies,  and  reduction  of  negative  social \nand  environmental  impacts.  Technical  feasibility  and  environmental  soundness  have  been \nconfirmed for the dredging of Phap Bao Lake (output 2.2a) and Lai Nghi reservoir (output 2.3a). \nThe designs and the O&M plan have been prepared based on appropriate standards to ensure \nsustainability. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nEconomic  analysis. An economic analysis was conducted of the individual outputs as \n21. \nwell as the overall project, including the cost of improved urban environmental management and \nclimate change adaptation, and confirms that both Dong Hoi and Hoi An outputs, and the overall \n\n \n\n \n\n\fproject are economically viable.12 The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the investment \nin  Dong  Hoi  is  estimated  at  18.4%,  with  an  economic  net  present  value  (ENPV)  at  a  12% \ndiscount  rate  of  $17.5  million,  while  the  EIRR  of  the  investment  in  Hoi  An  is  13.2%  with  an \nENPV  of  $7.8  million.  The  overall  project  EIRR  is  estimated  at  14.8%  with  an  ENPV  of  $27.8 \nmillion.  Sensitivity  tests  indicate  that  the  overall  project  is  sensitive  to  an  increase  in  cost  or \ndecrease in benefits, and to a delay in benefits. Under the most adverse condition (a 10% cost \nincrease combined with a 10% benefit decrease), the EIRR is reduced to 12.5%. \n \nFinancial  analysis.  Fiscal  analysis  of  Quang  Binh  and  Quang  Nam  PPCs  was \n22. \nundertaken for all components in Quang Binh and for the Co Co River and flood management \nand coastal  protection  components  in Quang  Nam.13 For  each PPC,  recurrent  costs,  including \ndebt service and operating expenses, were projected, and the fiscal performance during 2009\u2013\n2013 analyzed to assess the PPC\u2019s capacity to cover these costs. Both PPCs should have the \ncapacity  to  meet  their  obligations  without  additional  balance  transfers  from  the  government, \nalthough capital expenditure spending should be closely monitored to ensure other investment \nprojects  do  not  impair  their  ability  to  meet  recurrent  costs  under  the  project.  A  cost\u2013benefit \nanalysis  was  undertaken  to  assess  the  financial  viability  of  the  water  supply  improvement \ncomponent,  which  is  being  implemented  by  the  Quang  Nam  WSDC  and  intended  to  fully \nrecover all costs from water revenues. The financial internal rate of return of this component is \n11.9%, which is in excess of the weighted average cost of capital of 0.7%. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n23. \nThe risk rating for financial management is medium based on the financial management \nassessment,  which  focused  on  accounting  and  auditing  procedures  and  staff  expertise.  The \nexisting financial information system (i.e., accounting, reporting, and internal control system) is \ncomplete  and  applicable  to  domestic  construction  entities.  The  Quang  Binh  URENCO  and \nQuang  Nam  WSDC  have  experience  in  infrastructure  projects  financed  by  both  domestic  and \ninternational  funds.  Quang  Binh  URENCO  and  Quang  Nam  WSDC  have  not  implemented  an \nADB-funded  project,  while  Quang Binh  PPC  and Quang Nam  PPC  have  done  so. Training on \nADB  disbursement  procedures  and  advanced  financial  management  will  be  conducted  to \nensure success of project implementation. \n \n24. \nA  procurement  capacity  assessment  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  has \nbeen  undertaken  in Dong Hoi  and  Hoi  An.  Both  implementing  agencies (i)  have experience in \nundertaking  large  development  partner-funded  projects,  including  some  using  international \ncompetitive bidding  procedures;  and (ii)  lack  extensive experience  with ADB  procurement  and \nthe operation of imprest accounts, with disbursement often being slow in comparison with initial \nestimates.  Based  on  the  assessment,  the  procurement  plan  was  prepared  (including  the \nthresholds and review procedures; contract packages for goods, works, and consulting services; \nand national competitive bidding guidelines) and included in the PAM (footnote 11). Training on \nADB\u2019s  procurement  requirements  will  be  conducted  as  part  of  the  project  administration  and \nimplementation training under output 3. \n \n25. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the Quang Binh and Quang Nam PPCs, and relevant sections will be \nincluded  in  all  documents  and  contracts  relating  to  procurement.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 11). \n\n                                                \n12  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8            \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n26. \nA  social,  poverty,  and  gender  analysis  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB \nguidelines.  Information  collected  contributed  to  the  project  design,  ensured  social  inclusion  of \nthe  poor  and  economically  vulnerable,  and  supported  the  need  for  measures  to  mitigate  the \nimpacts of climate change on the urban and peri-urban populations. The project is classified as \ngeneral intervention. The project will benefit a combined population of about 206,000 residents \nin Dong Hoi  and Hoi  An,  including  about  1,000 poor  households,  half  of  which are  headed  by \nwomen. Poor households that cannot afford to connect to a wastewater system will be assisted \nthrough a revolving fund managed by the Women\u2019s Union in Dong Hoi.14 \n \n27. \nThe  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  gender  action  plan \nfocuses  on  increasing  women\u2019s  participation  in  decision  making  at  all  levels  of  urban \ngovernance and service provision through female participation in project capacity  development \nplans and training sessions.15 Capacity development will be developed based on gender equity, \nwith women comprising at least 30% of all session participants. The project will support female \ngovernment  staff  and  women\u2019s  unions  to  develop  their  knowledge  of  climate  change  impacts \nand adaptation measures. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n28. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). The proposed project is not expected to cause irreversible \nadverse  environmental  impacts.  Two  initial  environmental  examinations  were  conducted  for \nDong  Hoi  and  Hoi  An.  Mitigation  measures  for  identified  impacts  are  included  in  the \nenvironment management plans (EMPs).16 In addition, the potential impacts of climate change \nand natural hazards are recommended for integration into the detailed engineering design. The \ninitial environmental examinations were approved by the Quang Binh PPC for Dong Hoi and the \nMinistry  of  Natural  Resources  and  Environment  for  Hoi  An  (because  of  the  city\u2019s  status  as  a \nUNESCO  World  Heritage  site).  The  finalized  EMPs  based  on  the  detailed  engineering  design \nand  cleared  by  ADB  will  form  part  of  the  bidding  documents.  EMP  implementation  will  be \nensured by a designated environment officer in each PMU.  Effective environmental monitoring \nat  all  stages  of  project  implementation  will  be  ensured.  Stakeholder  consultations  were \nconducted  through  formal  and  informal  focus  group  discussions,  and  grievance  redress \nmechanisms have also been established. In compliance with ADB\u2019s information disclosure and \nconsultation requirements, the safeguard documents have been posted on ADB\u2019s website. \n \n29. \nInvoluntary  resettlement. The safeguard category for involuntary resettlement is A, in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. Two resettlement plans, one each for Dong \nHoi and Hoi An, have been prepared for the components with land acquisition and resettlement \nimpacts.17 For Dong Hoi, 173,940 square meters of land will be permanently acquired, and 375 \nhouseholds with 1,550 persons will be affected. For Hoi An, 711,374 square meters of land will \nbe  permanently  acquired,  and  645  households  with  2,580  persons  will  be  affected.  In \ncombination, there will be 539 severely affected households (with approximately 2,264 affected \n\n                                                \n14 The  revolving  fund  is  regularly  audited  by  the  Quang  Binh  PPC  financed  under  the  World  Bank  funded  project \n\n15 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 Initial Environmental Examination: Dong Hoi City; Initial Environmental Examination: Hoi An City (accessible from \n\nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n17 Resettlement Plan: Dong Hoi City; Resettlement Plan: Hoi An City (accessible from the list of linked documents in \n\n(footnote 9). \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fpersons).  In  Dong  Hai,  52  affected  households  (approximately  218  affected  persons)  will  be \nrequired to relocate. In Hoi An, 311 affected households (approximately 1,306 affected persons) \nare  estimated  to  lose  more  than  10%  of  their  total  productive  land  holding,  and  176  affected \nhouseholds (approximately 739 affected persons) will be required to relocate. All other impacts \nare partial and temporary. The cost of land acquisition and resettlement that will be financed by \nthe government is estimated to be about $27.8 million, which includes base costs, allowances, \nadministration,  and  contingencies.  A  cutoff  date  with  extensive  stakeholder  consultation  and \nparticipation has been established and will be officially announced by the PPCs after the project \nhas  been  approved.  Project  information  has  been  disclosed  to  affected  persons  throughout \nproject  preparation.  The  public  information  booklet,  which  was  distributed  to  affected  persons \nduring  project  preparation,  will  be  updated  and redistributed  to  affected households  during the \ndetailed measurement survey. \n \n30. \nResettlement documents have been prepared in consultation with local communities and \nare  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  the  government\u2019s  laws  and \nregulations. The documents have been endorsed, approved, and posted on the ADB website. A \ngrievance  redress  mechanism  will  help  facilitate  resolution  of  complaints  on  resettlement,  the \nenvironment,  and  other  project-related  issues.  The  resettlement  plans  will  be  updated  and \ndisclosed  after  detailed  engineering  design,  and  cleared  by  ADB  prior  to  contract  awards. \nEffective monitoring at all stages of project implementation will be ensured. \n \n31. \nIndigenous  peoples.  Indigenous  people  safeguards  are  not  triggered  by  any  project \ncomponents in Dong Hoi or Hoi An, and the safeguard category for indigenous peoples is C, in \naccordance  with  the  requirements  outlined  in  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement;  hence  no \nseparate indigenous peoples plans are required to be prepared. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe  overall  assessment  of  the  project  risks  is  rated  medium.  Both  implementing \n32. \nagencies  have  experience  in  infrastructure  projects  financed  by  domestic  and  international \nfunds although they have not implemented an ADB-funded project. The integrated benefits and \nimpacts  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  costs.  Major  risks  and  mitigation  measures  are \nsummarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in  detail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management \nplan.18 \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nStakeholders in the river basins do \nnot cooperate to operationalize the \nflood warning and management \nsystem in Hoi An. \nIndividual developers in the Bao \nNinh new urban area do not follow \nthe measures to protect the coastal \ndune complex to be developed \nunder the project. \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nAs part of the project, basin-level workshops will be held to \nensure involvement of stakeholders in and their commitment to \nthe design and implementation of the flood warning and \nmanagement system. \nStrict adherence to dune protection measures will be ensured \nthrough a review of developers\u2019 EIA reports by the PMU, \nsupported by the project implementation support consultant. \nDONRE will ensure that all recommendations are included in \nthe developers\u2019 EIA reports, and will not grant licenses to \noperate to such developers in the Bao Ninh new urban area. \n\n \n \n\n                                                \n18 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10            \n\nRisks \nInadequate subsidies are provided \nfor wastewater management in \nDong Hoi and water supply in Hoi \nAn. \nDONRE  =  Department  of  Natural  Resources  and  Environment,  EIA  = environmental  impact assessment,  PMU  = \nproject management unit, PPC = Provincial People\u2019s Committee. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nRequired subsidies were estimated under the project \npreparatory technical assistance.
