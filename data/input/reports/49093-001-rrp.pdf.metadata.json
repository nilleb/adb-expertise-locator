However, rural areas have benefitted from this achievement less  than urban areas, and \nthe sustainability of this benefit is vulnerable, as hydrocarbon income is expected to diminish by \n2034. In view of this challenge, the government is emphasizing inclusive growth with a focus on \ndiversifying  away  from  hydrocarbons  into  productive  sectors.  Foremost  is  agriculture,  which \nemploys  38%  of  the  labor  force,  but  only  generated  5.7%  of  gross  domestic  product  in  2013. \nThe  lagging  performance  of  agriculture\u2014which  is  the  primary  source  of  employment  and \nincome for nearly half the population\u2014points to its low productivity, providing mainly low wage \nand  seasonal jobs  that  contribute to  poverty  vulnerability.2 Improving  agricultural  productivity  is \ncentral to developing the rural economy and is the most direct route to  improving employment \nand income opportunities. \n \n3. \nStructural  issues  and  inefficiencies  contribute  to  low  agricultural  productivity.  Land \nreforms  after  independence  in  1990  distributed  1.3  million  hectares  of  agricultural  land  to \n870,000  households.  Cereal  production,  which  increased  by  a  compound  annual  growth  rate \n(CAGR) of 8% during 2000\u20132009, has since stagnated. Food and livestock production show a \nsimilar picture. Today, smallholders produce 90% of agricultural goods on farms of less than 3 \nhectares,  posing  challenges  for  improving  farmer  know-how  and  scale  production,  which \nrequires  massive  fixed  and  working  capital  investments.  Marketing  of  produce  is  largely \nuncoordinated by companies that lack adequate storage, causing high wastage of produce and \nexcessive charges to farmers.  Factors resulting in low agricultural productivity  include (i) small \nfarm  size,  (ii)  low  quality  standards,  (iii)  the  absence  of  efficient  logistics  and  marketing,  (iv) \ninadequate irrigation infrastructure, (v) limited research and slow adoption of modern agricultural \npractices,  (vi)  low  integration  of  farmers  into  agribusiness  value  chains,  and  (vii)  limited  and \ncostly  access  to  financial  services.  Foremost,  limited  access  to  affordable  funding  constrains \ninvestment for many small farmers. \n \n4. \nRural residents have inadequate access to finance. Banking is highly concentrated in the \ncapital, Baku, representing 83% of bank loans and 92% of deposits.3 Penetration to rural areas \nis  poor,  as  many  villages  lack  access  to  basic  financial  services.  Regions  outside  Baku \nrepresent 78% of the population and 62% of entrepreneurs; they receive only 17% of lending. In \n2013, agriculture obtained only 5% of institutional credit (footnote 3). \n                                                \n1  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in  Appendix  1.  On  21  February  2015,  the  Central  Bank  of  Azerbaijan \nannounced a 34% devaluation of the Azerbaijan manat against the dollar. In this report, historical financial analysis \nuses the historical exchange rate. The use of the new exchange rate is indicated where relevant.   \n\n2  Sector Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n3  Government of Azerbaijan, Central Bank of Azerbaijan. 2014. Monthly Bulletin December. Baku. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nLow  financial  services  outreach  to  agriculture  is  a  major  impediment  to  improving \n5. \nproductivity.  Typical  financial  services  to  farmers  are  limited  to  basic  payments  and  deposits \nand,  to  a  lesser  extent,  credit,  as  lending  processes  require  collateral  and  financial \ndocumentation  that  most  farmers  are  unable  to  produce.  Services  customized  to  a  farmer\u2019s \ncash  flow  are  still  in  their  infancy.  Creative  solutions  are  needed  to  address  the  challenge  of \nlimited financial inclusion and low agricultural productivity. \n \n6. \nCompared with emerging markets in Eastern Europe,  Azerbaijan\u2019s depth and efficiency \nof financial intermediation is low, as evidenced by the low private credit\u2013gross domestic product \nratio  of  30.5%  (2014)  and  high  lending\u2013deposit  rate  spreads.  The  finance  sector  depends \nlargely  on  external  borrowing,  as  evidenced  by  the  high  loan\u2013deposit  ratio  of  166%  (2014) \nreflecting  weak  savings.  A  2011  survey  indicated  that  only  15%  of  the  adult  population  had  a \nsavings  account  and  only  2%  of  those  who  indicated  having  saved  during  the  preceding  year \nhad done so through a bank, reflecting public mistrust of the banking system.4 \n \n7. \nOn  21  February  2015,  the  Central  Bank  of  Azerbaijan  (CBAR)  announced  a  34% \ndevaluation of the manat against the dollar. The devaluation follows the decline in oil prices, the \ndrain  of  foreign  reserves  and  bank  deposit,  as  well  as  deposit  shifts  from  manat  to  dollar. \nCBAR\u2019s  move  aims  to  improve  diversification  and  competitiveness  of  the  non-oil  sectors, \nespecially  agriculture.  The  immediate  impact  to  the  finance  sector  is  a  significant  reduction  of \nbank  and  nonbank  capital  adequacy  given  their  significant  foreign  currency  lending.5 Adverse \nasset  liability  currency  mismatches  can  be  mitigated  by  (i)  prudential  open  currency  position \nlimits imposed by CBAR, (ii) currency hedging contracts,  and (iii) prudent underwriting policies \nof  some banks that  require  comfortable  debt  service ratios  as  risk  buffers.  As  some  loans  will \nshow stress in debt service, financial intermediation will be subdued in 2015. This underscores \nthe  need  for  international  financial  institutions  (IFIs)  to  instill  public  confidence  in  markets  by \ncontinuing operations with commercially sound financial institutions. \n \nTo  improve  financial  inclusion  in  Azerbaijan  and,  in  particular,  the  low  outreach  of  the \n8. \nformal  financial  sector  to  agriculture,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  selected  ABA,  an \nexisting  partner  and  the  sixth  largest  bank  in  Azerbaijan  with  $1.2  billion  assets  (25  February \n2015); and FIA, the largest nonbank financial institution with $231 million of assets (25 February \n2015)  and  the  most  extensive  rural  footprint,  as  a  new  ADB  partner.  ABA  provides  loans \ntypically in the range of $1,000 to $3 million with an average loan size of $5,200; whereas FIA, \nthrough its village banking model, offers smaller loans of up to $100,000, with an average size \nof $1,557. While the customer segments targeted by ABA and FIA overlap, the market is quite \nlarge and demand is high. Customers in remote villages and small enterprises can also benefit \nfrom competition of services, thereby improving their connectivity to markets and value chains. \nGiven the leading role of ABA and FIA in agriculture finance over the past 8 years, both should \nretain  their  continued  focus  despite  the  adverse  devaluation  impact.  Both  institutions  have \nstrong  corporate  governance,  supported  by  their  IFI  shareholders,  sound  and  responsible \nlending processes, strong development orientation, and an ability to develop products to further \npenetrate underserved agriculture segments. The December 2014 Fitch rating upgrade of ABA \nto BBB\u2013 investment grade underscores ADB\u2019s and Fitch\u2019s comfort with shareholder support.6  \n \n\n                                                \n4  A.

Initially, this support largely benefited banks and enterprises centered in the capital. \nTo support increased access to finance in secondary towns and rural regions, ADB provided in \n2013 a loan to ABA who expanded its regional footprint through branch openings and support to \nfarmers  and  small  trade  and  service  businesses.7 However,  an  enhanced  focus  is  needed  to \nadvance the outreach of custom-suited financial products for agriculture through sound financial \ninstitutions and, especially in the short term, to respond to the adverse devaluation impact. \n \nB. \n \n10. \nBusiness  overview  and  strategy.  Established  in  2002  as  a  greenfield  bank  by \ninternational investors, ABA is now the leading lender to MSMEs in Azerbaijan, serving 160,000 \nborrowers with a loan portfolio of $0.9 billion (28 February 2015). In 2007, ABA established its \nmicro-agriculture  loan  product,  which  represents 18%  of  its  loans.  ABA\u2019s extensive network of \n37  branches  located  outside  Baku  provides  a  good  platform  to  reach  farmers.  ABA\u2019s  non-IFI \ncommercial  borrowing  is  expected  to  increase  more  than  twofold  by  2017  from  $204  million \n(2014) to become at par with traditional IFI and microfinance investment fund (MIF) borrowing \nand  deposits.  During 2013\u20132014,  annual  credit growth  averaged  40%,  or  double the  business \ntarget. The ABA business plan for 2015\u20132018 projects a more moderate loan portfolio CAGR of \n15%, which is prudent in the context of the adverse impact on demand under moderating growth \nscenarios. ABA will review its business plan for 2015 to reflect the market impact of the recent \nmanat  devaluation.  While  moderation  of  credit  demand  is  likely  for  2015,  it  is  expected  to  be \ntemporary.  \n \n11. \nOwnership.  ABA  is  predominantly  owned  by  IFIs,  with  Black  Sea  Trade  and \nDevelopment Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International \nFinance Corporation, and German development cooperation through KfW each holding 20% of \nshares.  Access  Microfinance  Holding  AG  holds 16.5%  and  LFS  Financial  Systems  3.5%.8 IFIs \nprovide strong support through continued funding. \n \n12.  Management.  ABA\u2019s  board  of  management  (BOM)  is  chaired  by  the  chief  executive \nofficer  (CEO),  and  has  two  additional  members  responsible  for  (i)  business  banking  and  risk, \nand (ii) retail banking and operations. The CEO, a German commercial banker with 19 years of \nexperience in Europe and the Russian Federation, joined ABA in mid-2012. The other members \nare  Azerbaijani  nationals  with  strong  academic  backgrounds  and  in-depth  knowledge  of  ABA \noperations,  having  moved  up  from  credit  officers  to  their  current  positions  since  ABA\u2019s \nestablishment. The BOM sets strategic targets for approval by the board of directors (BOD). \n \n13. \nGovernance  structure.  A  two-tier  board,  the  BOD  and  the  BOM,  governs  ABA.  The \nBOD  oversees  implementation  of  key  policies,  approves  strategies  and  business  plans, \nappoints management, and monitors their performance. The four IFIs nominate four of the five \ndirectors  (including  the  chairperson),  who  are  currently  all  senior  bankers  with  international \nexperience. Access Microfinance Holding nominates the other director, a German banker, who \nwas ABA\u2019s first CEO. \n \n                                                \n7  ADB.  2013.

Manila. \n\n8  Ownership, Management, and Governance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nABA\u2019s  audit  department  reports  directly  to  the  BOD  audit  committee  and  is  led  by  an \n14. \nexperienced  auditor.  The  external  auditor  changes  periodically,  with  Ernst  and  Young  holding \nthe mandate since 2013. Historically, audit observations relate to addressing minor fraud cases \nidentified  at  branches.  ABA  dismisses  staff  if  fraud  is  substantiated.  To  reduce  operating  risk \nand meet the requirements of its growing business, ABA successfully migrated to Temenos 24, \nan  advanced  core  banking  system.  Audits  have not  identified  any major accounting,  operating \nrisk,  or  compliance  issues.  ABA  internal  audits  have  improved  through  a  focus  on  risk-based \naudit supported by specialized software. ABA\u2019s audit function is well established. In 2013 ABA \nestablished  a  unit  reporting  to  the  CEO  to  identify  suspicious  transactions  by  scanning \ninformation  by  source  of  wealth,  politically  exposed  persons,  and  watch  lists.  ABA  has \nestablished \u201cknow your customer\u201d processes and policies countering money laundering and the \nfinancing of terrorism. ABA reports findings to the CBAR Financial Services Unit.9 \n \n15. \nTotal capital adequacy. Under Basel I (using international financial reporting standards) \nand national prudential regulations, ABA comfortably exceeded prudential requirements, backed \nby a conservative dividend policy and high profitability supporting the buildup of capital through \nretained  earnings.  Although  Basel  I  capital  adequacy  declined  from  24.3%  to  22.5%  during \nFebruary  2015,  and  regulatory  capital  adequacy  declined  from  16.3%  to  14.0%  due  to  the \nmanat devaluation, it remains well within the prudential limit of 12%.  \n \nLoan portfolio and asset quality. ABA\u2019s loan book is segmented into 41% micro loans \n16. \n(18%  agriculture),  47%  small  and  medium-sized  enterprise  (SME)  loans,  and  12%  retail  and \nmortgage  loans  (31  March  2015).  The  manat  devaluation  resulted  in  an  11%  reduction  of  the \nloans in dollar terms. Currently, 62% of the loans are in dollars to about 16,000 borrowers that \nearn  revenues  in  manat\u2014mainly  SME  and  mortgage  borrowers\u2014who  almost  all  continue  to \nreport very strong asset quality. ABA\u2019s asset quality remains very strong due to rigorous client \nselection and monitoring, short cash-flow cycle of loans, high degree of repeat loans, effective \nintegration of sales and risk functions, and a quality-oriented bonus system. The nonperforming \nloan  ratio  was  1.2%  in  2014,  and  since  2007  has  never  exceeded  1.4%.10 While  asset  quality \nmay  temporarily  deteriorate  in  2015,  it  is  expected  to  remain  very  healthy.  To  comply  with \nInternational Financial Reporting Standards 9, ABA developed a model to estimate probability of \ndefault and loss-given default through back testing its portfolio on the 2008\u20132009 crisis scenario. \nThis  model  is  currently  being  updated  to  reflect  the  latest  devaluation.  The  granularity  of  the \nloan portfolio and MSME sector diversification support the robustness of asset quality.  \n \n17. \nEarnings  and  profitability.  Net  income  grew  at  a  CAGR  of  27%  during  2008\u20132014 \nreaching $43 million in 2014. In 2014, return on equity was a solid 33.2% and return on assets \n4.7%. Although ABA\u2019s net interest margin (NIM) dropped by 150 basis points in 2014, reflecting \nfalling  interest  rates  due  to  increased  competition,  it  remained  strong  relative  to  emerging \nmarket comparators and appropriate due to ABA\u2019s staff-intensive business model. Profitability is \nexpected to moderate, with a temporary decline in 2015 reflecting cost of the branch expansion \nand tightening margins due to increased competition and the recent manat devaluation. \n \n18. \nLiquidity,  funding,  and  market  risk. Deposits increased from 14% in 2008 to 39% in \n2014, while commercial borrowings dropped to 61% of total funding. However, significant manat \n\n                                                \n9  Azerbaijan participates in the Financial Action Task Force. Its compliance is monitored by MONEYVAL  Council of \nEurope  Committee  of  Experts  on  the  Evaluation  of  Anti-Money  Laundering  Measures  and  the  Financing  of \nTerrorism. \n\n10 In  this report,  nonperforming  loans  are  defined  as  the sum of  loans  (i)  overdue  above  90  days but not  impaired,  \n(ii) impaired according to International Financial Reporting Standards, and (iii) restructured within 12 months of the \nreporting date and not included in (i) or (ii). \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nFinca Azerbaijan  \n\ndeposits  has  been  shifted  to  dollars  and  partly  withdrawn,  indicating  that  retail  deposits  are \nvulnerable  to  withdrawal  and  dollarization. To  address  this  vulnerability,  ABA  plans to  improve \nits  customized  services  and  provide  a  more  customer-friendly  branch  environment,  as  well  as \nnew contractual term investment products for retail customers. ABA\u2019s funding strategy aims to \nminimize deposit volatility through commercial borrowings targeted to reach equal funding for (i) \ndeposits, (ii) commercial external borrowings, and (iii) IFI and MIF borrowing. ABA matches its \nforeign currency funding with lending in the same currency, and requires customer debt service \nratios of at least 1.5. In the absence of cross currency swaps, the minimum debt service ratios \nare appropriate to manage currency-induced credit risk. \n   \nC. \n \nBusiness  overview  and  strategy.  Established  in  1998  and  licensed  as  a  nonbank \n19. \ncredit  institution,  FIA  is  the  leading  nonbank  lender  to  microenterprises  and  farm  households \nserving 156,000 borrowers, with $191 million in loans (25 February 2015). In 2012, FIA shifted \nfrom group to individual  lending, which now represents more than 75%. Agriculture represents \n52% of its loans and its 56 rural branches give it a large platform to reach farmers. FIA\u2019s funding \nstrategy  relies  on  external  borrowings  from  IFIs  and  MIFs  and  limited  domestic  borrowing. \nDuring  2012\u20132014,  loans  grew  at  a  CAGR  of  35%  before  moderating  to  20%  in  2014  due  to \nincreasing competition. FIA expects agriculture loan growth at $30 million per annum and total \nloan  growth  at  a  CAGR  of  15%  (2015\u20132019)  with  a  temporary  moderation  in  2015  due  to  the \ndevaluation. \n  \nOwnership.  FIA  is  owned  by  Finca  Microfinance  Cooperatief  UA,  Netherlands,11 which \n20. \nis  owned  by  Finca  Microfinance  Holding  LLC,  Delaware, 12  which  is  owned  62%  by  Finca \nInternational Inc. New York, a not-for-profit corporation in the United States (US), and 38% by \nIFIs  including  Financierings  Maatschappij  voor  Ontwikkelingslanden  N.V.,  Netherlands,  the \nInternational Finance Corporation, and KfW, and private MIFs (responsAbility and Triodos). With \ntheir support, FIA has adopted high integrity and responsible finance standards.  \n \n21.  Management.  FIA\u2019s  BOM  comprises  the  CEO  (chair),  chief  finance  officer,  and  chief \noperations officer, all experienced bankers. The CEO, a US national, is a microfinance  banker \nwith  16  years  of  experience  in  Eastern  Europe  and  various  Finca  subsidiaries.  The  newly \nappointed chief finance officer was previously chief finance officer of Finca Tajikistan. The chief \noperations officer is an Azerbaijan national who has worked for FIA since its establishment. The \nBOM manages FIA\u2019s business and sets strategic targets for approval by the BOD.  \n \nGovernance  structure. FIA has a two-tier board including the BOD and the BOM. The \n22. \nBOD  issues  and  supervises  FIA\u2019s  strategy,  policies,  and  management.  It  comprises  Finca \nInternational nominees, currently all experienced international bankers, two of which are senior \nstaff at Finca International; the others are 2 CEOs of Finca Eurasia and Middle East South Asia \nsubsidiaries  and  Senior  Investment  Officer  from  Finca  International.  FIA\u2019s  governance \nstandards follow that of all 23 subsidiaries of Finca International, with a strong mission focus on \nsupporting  lending  to  low  income  households  and  businesses,  staff  integrity,  transparency, \nprudent  lending  policies  and  underwriting,  and  adequate  risk  management.  FIA  governance \nstructures and functions are well established reflecting an adequate separation of functions by \n(i) micro  loans;  (ii)  SME  loans;  (iii)  administration  and security; (iv)  human resources; (v)  legal \n\n                                                \n11 The Netherlands cooperative structure benefits from a double taxation treaty between the two countries, which is a \n\ncommon solution for many international MSME lenders to reduce transaction tax. \n\n12 The incorporation in Delaware is for many US-based companies a choice of default, due to its advanced investor- \n\nfriendly legislation and favorable corporate taxation.    \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nand compliance; and (vi) treasury, accounting, and financial control. \n \n23. \nFIA\u2019s  audit  department  is  led  by  an  experienced  auditor.  The  external  auditor  changes \nperiodically, with Deloitte holding the mandate since 2012. Usually audit observations relate to \naddressing  minor  fraud  identified  at  branches,  leading  to  staff  dismissal  if  substantiated.  Audit \nobservations  have  not  identified  any  major  accounting,  operating,  or  compliance  issues.  FIA\u2019s \naudit function is well established and supervised by Finca International. FIA has dedicated staff \nreporting  to  the  CEO  to  identify  suspicious  transactions  by  scanning  information  by  source  of \nwealth,  politically  exposed  persons,  and  watch  lists.  It  has  \u201cknow  your  customer\u201d  policies \ncountering money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and reports findings to CBAR. \n \n24. \nCapital  adequacy.  As  a  nonbank  financial  institution,  FIA  uses  a  more  restrictive \ncapital\u2013assets ratio than the capital to risk-weighted assets used by banks. Since 2010, FIA has \ncomfortably exceeded prudential minimum requirements for banks supported by healthy profits \nand  moderate  dividends,  allowing  a buildup of  capital  through retained earnings.  Although the \nrecent  manat  devaluation  resulted  in  a  drop  of  capital  adequacy  from  18%  to  16%,  it  remains \nabove the 12% prudential limit for banks.  \n \n25. \nLoan  portfolio  and  asset  quality.  Micro  loans  made  up  98%  of  FIA\u2019s  loans,  56%  of \nthese  for  agriculture  and  2%  for  SMEs  (25  February  2015).  FIA  has  maintained  sound  asset \nquality with a portfolio at risk greater than 30 days of 1.4% of the gross loan portfolio at the end \nof 2014. This is supported by a rigorous client selection and monitoring process, the short cash-\nflow  cycle  of  loans,  and  the  high  granularity  of  the  loan  portfolio.  Although  the  nonperforming \nloan  ratio  increased  by  100  basis  points  due  to  increased  competition  and  signs  of  cross-\nindebtedness  of  some  borrowers  in  2014,  it  remained  comfortable  at  1.4%.  About  13,000  (or \n8%) FIA borrowers currently borrow dollar-denominated loans while relying on manat revenues \nhave  now  realized  the  adverse  impact  of  the  manat  devaluation  through  an  increase  in  their \nloan principal. The impact on FIA is mitigated through prudent underwriting policies, requiring a \nminimum debt service ratio of 1.4, which is likely to absorb the devaluation impact. While asset \nquality may temporarily deteriorate in this segment in 2015, it is manageable given FIA\u2019s robust \nasset quality and underwriting standards.  \n \nEarnings. Net income was $10 million  in 2014 with a CAGR of 31%. Return on equity \n26. \nexceeded  20%  during  2011\u20132014,  primarily  the  result  of  high  business  growth  and  healthy \ninterest margins. While FIA\u2019s NIM contracted by almost 7% during 2011\u20132014, and is expected \nto  contract  further  due  to  increasing  competition,  profitability  remained  sound  with  return  on \nequity  at  23.1%  and  return  on  assets  at  4.2%  in  2014.  FIA\u2019s  NIM  remains  strong  and \nappropriate due to FIA\u2019s  staff-intensive,  low  transaction  volume  business  model.  Although FIA \nanticipates  an  annual  loan  growth  rate  of  15%  during  2015\u20132019,  it  expects  net  profits  to \ntemporarily  contract  in  2015  due  to  higher  provisioning,  reduced  operating  margins,  and  the \nadverse impact of the manat devaluation. \n  \n27. \nLiquidity  and  market  risk.  With  its  development-focused  business  model  and  good \nprofitability and asset quality, FIA is attractive for IFI and MIF funding, which represents 78% of \nits funding. Domestic commercial banks provided the remaining 22% in 2014. FIA is hedging its \nforeign  exchange  exposures  through  hedges  with  domestic  and  international  counterparties \narranged  by  The  Currency  Exchange,  MFX  Solutions,  and \nInternational  Finance \nCorporation.  \n \n \n\nthe \n\n \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  proposed  ADB  assistance  entails  two  direct  senior,  unsecured  loan  facilities  for  \n28. \n(i) ABA of up to $75 million (or AZN equivalent) with a maximum 7-year tenor, and (ii) FIA of up \nto $25 million comprising, of an A-loan of up to $20 million (or AZN equivalent) with a maximum \n6-year tenor, and a B-loan of up to $5 million with a 4-year tenor to be funded by participating \ncommercial  banks. The  loan  to  ABA  will  be  structured  in  several  tranches,  each  with a  5-year \nmaturity,  to  be  drawn  down  within  a  2-year  period.  The  loan  to  FIA  will  also  be  structured  in \ntranches, each with a 4-year maturity, to be drawn down within a 2-year period. The proceeds \nwill  be  used  exclusively  to  support  borrowers  engaged  in  agricultural  production,  processing, \nlogistics, and marketing.13   \n \nB. \n \nABA  and  FIA  will  provide  annual  audited  financial  statements,  quarterly  financial \n29. \nstatements,  and  compliance  certificates  for  agreed  covenants.  Reporting  includes  updates  on  \n(i) financial, solvency, and profitability metrics; (ii) governance, safeguards, and social protection \ncompliance;  and  (iii)  business  performance  and  utilization  of  the  ADB  loans.  ADB  will  field \nmissions at least annually to review and discuss progress with ABA and FIA management.14 \n \nC. \n \nEconomic diversification and access to finance. The proposed loans to ABA and FIA \n30. \nwill  support  economic  diversification  away  from  hydrocarbons  and  improve  access  to  working \nand  fixed  investment  capital  for  agriculture,  and  lead  the  way  for  the  finance  sector  to  fund \nhouseholds  and  MSMEs  operating  in  agriculture.  The  concurrent  support  of  two  leading \ninstitutions will support competition to the benefit of farmers by earning higher incomes. This in \nturn will support poverty reduction in the regions. \n \n31. \nLong-term  funding.  ADB  loans  will  help  increase  the  tenor  for  lending  to  agriculture \nMSMEs  and  provide  stable  long-term  funding  to  ABA  and  FIA  that  cannot  be  raised  through \ndeposits  and  domestic  borrowings,  given  the  public\u2019s  limited  confidence  in  Azerbaijan  capital \nmarkets. While  commercial  funding  is  expected  to  return,  financial  institutions  continue  to  rely \nheavily on IFIs to fund their asset growth. ADB\u2019s contribution also helps diversify ABA and FIA \nfunding  sources.  Along  with  ongoing  IFI  support,  the  loans  will  send  a  strong  signal  to  the \nmarket to boost confidence that is currently shaken by the manat devaluation.  \n \n32. \nLeveraging  resources  from  the  private  sector. ADB expects to mobilize commercial \nparticipation in the project and leverage its assistance through expected risk participations and a \nB-loan, which is important given the country\u2019s current environment.  \n \n33. \nTechnical  assistance.  ADB\u2019s  loans  will  be  complemented  by  technical  assistance  to \nhelp  improve  ABA\u2019s  manat  resource  mobilization  (retail  term  deposits  and  contractual \ninvestment  products)  and  agriculture  finance  product  offerings;  as  well  as  FIA\u2019s  outreach  to \nremote  villages  and  farmers  through  mobile  banking  and  financial  literacy  programs. 15 The \n\n                                                \n13 Subloans will not exceed $3 million equivalent. \n14 Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Azerbaijan for Capacity Building for Rural Financial Inclusion. \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nliteracy  programs  will  help  address  potential  over-indebtedness  of  households.  Through  close \non-site  monitoring  and  dialogue  with  ABA  and  FIA  management  and  their  shareholders,  ADB \nwill  strengthen  relationships  with  holding  companies  of  both  institutions  and  develop  business \nopportunities to support financial inclusion in the south Caucasus and Central Asia regions.              \n\n \nRisks \n\nD. \n \n34. \nCountry risk. Financial institutions are exposed to the hydrocarbon market cycles, given \nAzerbaijan\u2019s dependence on oil production and to a lesser extent non-oil exports in the context \nof currency devaluations and slowing demand of Azerbaijan\u2019s neighboring trade partners. ABA \nand  FIA  have  well-diversified  risk  exposures  through  substantial  business  in  the  regions  and \ngranular MSME loans in multiple sectors. \n \n35. \nCurrency risk and related asset liability management. The manat devaluation was an \nunprecedented step taken by CBAR to respond to the significant net outflow of foreign currency \nreserves, prompted by the devaluation of trading partners\u2019 currencies and decline of oil prices. \nThis has impacted banks\u2019 capital adequacy, dollarization of deposits, and to some extent asset \nquality  and  profitability.  ABA  and  FIA  have  strong  IFI  shareholder  and parent  support  to  raise \nnew equity and debt. Both have robust risk management processes that have proven effective. \nExperience from the 2009 crisis has proven their ability to withstand large shocks such as the \nimpact of devaluation. ABA and FIA have effectively  mitigated an important part of this risk by \nhedging  and  limiting  open  dollar  positions.  Subject  to  market  conditions  and  availability,  the \nADB  loans  may  be  partly  funded  in  manat.  While  further  adjustment  cannot  be  ruled  out,  the \nrecent devaluation somewhat mitigates market uncertainty regarding government actions.  \n\n \n\n \n\n36. \nCorporate  governance  and  integrity.  Azerbaijan  banks  typically  have  significant \nexposure  to  related  party  transaction  lending  and  weakness  in  corporate  governance  and \nintegrity. Supported by their international and IFI shareholders, ABA and FIA have built a strong \nintegrity culture to withstand such pressures and are leading the way for other institutions. \n\n37. \nAsset  quality  and  internal  controls.  Although asset quality  is  very  strong,  rapid loan \ngrowth  and  signs  of  household  cross-indebtedness  may  expose  ABA  and  FIA  to  higher  credit \nrisk, particularly for borrowers affected by the manat devaluation. ABA and FIA are limiting this \nrisk by maintaining prudent underwriting and using credit registry information.  \n \n38. \nProfitability.  Competition  in  Baku  and  the  manat  devaluation  will  impact  the  margins \nand profitability of ABA and FIA in 2015. Their business focus will strengthen their competitive \nposition in the regions, and efforts to enhance efficiency will mitigate this risk. \n \n  \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\nImpact.  The  expected  impact  is  increased  availability  of  credit  to  agriculture  in \n\n \nA. \n \n39. \nAzerbaijan. This will be reflected by increased private bank credit to agriculture.  \n  \n40. \nOutcome.  The  expected  outcome  is  sustained  financial  service  provision  by  ABA  and \nFIA  to  farmers,  and  agriculture  MSMEs.  ABA  and  FIA  are  expected  to  set  examples  for  other \nfinancial institutions in funding farmers and agriculture MSMEs, thus providing employment and \nincome opportunities. \n \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\nOutputs. ABA and FIA will improve their service outreach to  agriculture in particular by \n41. \noffering  a  wider  product  range  customized  to  farmer  and  MSME  needs.  Emphasizing  lending \nbased on MSME cash flows, expanding into remote areas, and providing term finance will help \nserve the regional economy and diversify ABA\u2019s risk and income profile. \nB. \n \n42. \nConsistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  Inclusive  finance  is  a  key \nfocus  of  ADB  assistance  as  set  forth  in  the  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020,  which  notes \neconomic  growth,  stimulated  by  private  investment  and  finance  sector  development,  as  a  key \ncontributing factor in reducing poverty; and emphasizes the importance of generating jobs, with \nprivate  employment  being  the  major  income  source  for  workers  and  their  families. 16 Inclusive \nfinance  will  be  supported  through  the  emphasis  of  ABA  and  FIA  on  agriculture  where \nproductivity is low, and the potential for employment and income generation is high. The loans \nto  ABA  and  FIA  will  reach  agriculture  MSMEs  and  farmers,  providing  longer  tenors  for  their \ninvestments. This is consistent with government and ADB strategy to promote diversification to \nprivate non-oil activities through deepening financial intermediation across the agriculture value \nchain.17  \n   \n43. \nConsistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. Inclusive finance is \nalso  a  key  focus  of  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Sector  Operational  Plan.  MSME  beneficiaries  of  financial \nintermediation  are  important  employers  and  providers  of  income.  Supporting  financial \nintermediaries  is  important  to  instill  confidence  and  restore  the  finance  sector  in  countries \naffected  by  macroeconomic  shocks  and  financial  crises.  Since  2005,  ADB  has  provided \nnonsovereign  loans  of  $120  million  to  banks,  comprising  loans  to  ABA,  Azerigas  Bank,  Bank \nRespublika, and Demir Bank, as well as to International Bank of Azerbaijan. ADB also plays an \nimportant role in supporting microfinance in Azerbaijan through sovereign interventions.18 \n \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \n44. \nThe  investments  are  classified  category  FI  for  environment,  and  FI  treated  as  C  for \ninvoluntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  potential  environmental  and  social \nimpacts of the investments and associated risks were assessed, as well as the commitment and \ncapacity  of  ABA  and  FIA  for  environmental  and  social  management.  Their  business  activities \nare unlikely to entail impacts on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. ABA and FIA \nwill  apply  ADB's  prohibited  investment  activities  list;  exclude  subloans  categorized  A  for \nenvironment  and  A  or  B  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples;  ensure  that \ninvestments using ADB funds abide by applicable national laws and regulations, as well as ADB \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009);  take  measures  to  comply  with  internationally  recognized \ncore labor standards including provisions prohibiting any discrimination against women in hiring \nand  providing  equal  pay  for  equal  work  for  men  and  women  in  compliance  with  ADB  Social \nProtection  Strategy  (2001);  and  in  the  case  of  FIA,  finalize  its  environmental  and  social \nmanagement  system  satisfactory  to  ADB  before  ADB\u2019s  first  disbursement  of  the  respective \n\n                                                \n16 ADB. 2014.
