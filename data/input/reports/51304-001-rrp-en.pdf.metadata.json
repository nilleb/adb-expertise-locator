I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof  up  to  $120,000,000  equivalent  in  tenge  to  Samruk-Energy  for  the  Restructuring  and \nTransformation Project in Kazakhstan.  \n \n2.  The proposed loan will provide long-tenor tenge financing that is not sufficiently available \nin the local market to support Samruk-Energy to increase its balance sheet flexibility by reducing \nforeign  exchange  risk,  improve  operational  efficiency  through  a  corporate  transformation \nprogram, and identify renewable energy project pipeline.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n3.  Project  identification.  The  Kazakhstan  electricity  sector  is  largely  privatized  and \nunbundled into generation, transmission, and distribution systems, and power traders. In 2016, \nthe total installed generation capacity of Kazakhstan was 21.0 gigawatts (GW), with available \ncapacity of 18.7 GW. Of the electricity generated, 79.4% was from coal-fired plants, 12.3% was \nfrom hydropower plants, 7.9% from gas, and 0.4% from solar and wind sources.1 There are 118 \npower  plants  with  different  forms  of  ownership,  both  private  and  state  controlled.  The \ngovernment classifies the most important assets as power plants of national importance. While \nsome investments have been made, about 70% of installed capacity is considered technically \nobsolete.2 There is still a significant shortage of electricity supply, especially in the southern \nregion of Kazakhstan. The entire electricity sector in Kazakhstan needs significant investments \nto rehabilitate the outdated assets and expand the capacity. 3 \n \n4.  Samruk-Energy, wholly owned by sovereign wealth fund Samruk-Kazyna, is the largest \npower generation company in Kazakhstan. Samruk-Energy\u2019s generation assets are classified as \npower plants of national importance.4 In 2016, the installed capacity of Samruk-Energy power \nplants totaled 6,804 megawatts (MW) (representing 31% of the total installed capacity of power \nplants in Kazakhstan) and generated 22.5 terawatt-hours (24% of total generation).5 Following \nthe Government of Kazakhstan\u2019s Green Economy Concept, in 2015 Samruk-Energy adopted \nthe Long-term Development Strategy of Samruk-Energy for 2015\u20132025.6 Among other things, \nthe strategy focuses on the (i) introduction of new technologies at every level of the company, \n                                                \n1  Kazakhstan Operator of Electric Power and Capacity Market, 2016.

Astana. \n2  Sector Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n3  According to World Bank 2017 estimates, the power system requires $42 billion of capital investments by 2030. \nThe World Bank 2017. Stuck in Transition: Reform Experiences and Challenges Ahead in The Kazakhstan Power \nSector. Washington, DC. \n4  The Decree of the Government of Kazakhstan of 30 June 2008, No. 651 lists Samruk-Energy as a strategic facility \nand provides preferential status. According to the Civil Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan (clause 193-1), no third \nparty is allowed to encumber strategic facilities without the decision of the Government of Kazakhstan. Additionally, \naccording to Banking Norm No. 147 of the National Bank of Kazakhstan dated 30 May 2016 (clauses 50\u201354), all \nenterprises of Samruk-Kazyna, including Samruk-Energy, are exempt from any single obligor limits imposed by the \nNational Bank of Kazakhstan on commercial banks in Kazakhstan. \n5  This excludes Ust-Kamenogorskaya Hydroelectric Power Plant (331 MW) and Shulbinskaya Hydroelectric Power \nPlant (702 MW), which are under concession to AES Corporation; and Bukhtarminskaya Hydroelectric Power Plant \n(675 MW), which is under concession to Kazzinc. \n6  The government set a target to increase the share of renewable energy in the total generation capacity to 10% by \n2030.

", "2        \n(ii) development of renewable energy (wind and solar) generation from the current 100 MW to \n850 MW by 2025, and (iii) doubling of shareholder value. \n \n5.  However, several macroeconomic challenges have slowed down the implementation of \nSamruk-Energy\u2019s long-term development strategy. In August 2015, because of a steep decline \nin global oil prices, the National Bank of Kazakhstan shifted the nominal exchange rate from a \nfixed to a floating regime. The tenge immediately lost significant value, sliding from T188 = $1 to \nT254 = $1; the depreciation has since continued to T336 = $1 as of 22 October 2017, with the \ncurrency losing 76% of its value in 26 months. The foreign exchange shock exacerbated the key \ndevelopment problem of the electricity sector: the need for a significant amount for the long-term \nfinancing for the rehabilitation and expansion of the power system. Various Kazakh companies, \nincluding Samruk-Energy, were negatively affected because of their foreign currency exposure.  \n \n6.  The government and Samruk-Energy\u2019s management were swift to respond to the foreign \nexchange shock. In 2015, the government launched the 100 Precise Steps Towards Realization \nof The Five Institutional Reforms, a national plan to modernize the economy.7 As a part of this \nplan, it issued a decree in December 2015 to implement a new privatization program aimed at \nimproving the efficiency of state assets and reducing budget expenditures.8 Nine subsidiaries of \nSamruk-Energy were included in the privatization list. In addition, as part of the privatization \nplan, Samruk-Kazyna recruited the Boston Consulting Group to advise on proposed initial public \nofferings (IPOs) of at least seven state-owned enterprises, including Samruk-Energy, by 2020. \nTo prepare itself for its IPO, Samruk-Energy prepared and approved a fundamental business \nrestructuring and transformation plan to be implemented from 2017 to 2021. The goals are to (i) \nsuccessfully sell its noncore assets to private investors, (ii) add balance sheet flexibility by \nreducing foreign exchange risk, (iii) modify business processes in the remaining businesses, (iv) \nbring the focus back on generation, and (v) become a transparent and efficient power company \nthat is attractive for prospective IPO investors. \n \n7.  In  December  2012,  Samruk-Energy  raised  a  5-year  bullet  maturity  $500  million \neurobond. The rapid depreciation of the tenge has resulted in a significant increase in the debt \nservicing requirement of Samruk-Energy, which uses the tenge as its primary revenue currency. \nThis has negatively impacted the company\u2019s balance sheet and stalled the implementation of its \nongoing  and  planned  projects.  Against this  backdrop,  the  company  approached  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) \nto  support  its  balance sheet  restructuring  plan,  in  particular  its  efforts  to minimize  foreign \nexchange exposure by converting its maturing dollar refinancing requirements into long-term \ntenge-denominated debt. \n \n8.  Project design. Samruk-Energy\u2019s overall business restructuring and transformation plan \nis aimed at the (i) reduction of foreign exchange risks; (ii) improvement of operational efficiency \nof core businesses to maximize shareholder value; and (iii) identification of renewable energy \nopportunities, thereby attracting investors for the IPO.  \n9.  The foremost area of transformation is aimed at creating balance sheet flexibility through \nreduction of foreign currency risk by way of refinancing dollar-denominated debt with tenge. The \ncompany has already secured loans from the EBRD for \u20ac100 million equivalent in tenge to \n                                                \n7 Kazakhstan Institute for Strategic Studies. 2015.

Resolution of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan as of  30 \nDecember 2015, No. 1141, On Some Privatization Issues for 2016\u20132020. Astana. ", "       3 \nrefinance a portion of the $500 million eurobond payment due in December 2017. Given its \ntenge-denominated  revenues,  the  company\u2019s  debt  policy  will  continue  to  be  to  borrow \npredominantly in tenge. Although the rest of the refinancing amount has also been substantially \nsecured through lending from local banks, such locally raised debt offers extremely limited \ntenor, thus constraining the company\u2019s financial flexibility. The company would, therefore, prefer \nto seek ADB\u2019s assistance, as it sought the EBRD\u2019s, for longer-tenor facilities, which will allow it \nto enhance its asset\u2013liability profile, and hence facilitate the transformation and restructuring \ninitiatives leading toward the planned 2020 IPO. Equity, by way of proceeds from the sale of \nsubsidiaries  and  a  small  amount  of  borrowings  from  local  banks,  will  fund  the  remaining \nrefinancing and funding requirements for 2017\u20132021. As the company moves toward restoring \nfinancial health following the 2015 tenge depreciation, a long-term tenge financing from ADB \nand EBRD, hitherto unavailable from the local market, will support Samruk-Energy to efficiently \nmanage its cash flows and diversify its borrowing strategy. \n \n10.  Attaining operational efficiency is the second key objective under the transformation \nprocess; it is capital-intensive and multidirectional in nature, and relies on four key drivers: (i) \nrevenue maximization, (ii) cost reduction, (iii) centralized project management, and (iv) sale of \nnon-core assets.  (Confidential information redacted). \n \n11.  In line with the country\u2019s national strategy of decarbonization, which is supported by \ninternational financial institutions, including ADB, the last area of transformation involves the \nidentification of opportunities and completion of the associated prefeasibility studies aimed at \nthe  expansion  of  Samruk-Energy\u2019s  renewable  energy  portfolio.    (Confidential  information \nredacted). Without  a  provision  for  long-tenor financing,  this  up-front  work, requiring  longer \ngestation periods, would need to be financed from local sources with shorter duration loans. \nThis would adversely impact the financial health and flexibility of the company.9 \n \n12.  Borrower. Samruk-Energy was established on 18 April 2007 to develop and implement \na long-term state policy on the upgrading of existing and the introduction of new generating \nfacilities. The founders of the company were Kazakhstan Holding for Management of State \nAssets Samruk and KazTransGaz. As a result of the reorganization through the merger of \nKazakhstan Holding for Management of State Assets Samruk and Sustainable Development \nFund  Kazyna,  on  3  November  2008  (which  transferred  KazTransGaz\u2019s  shares  in  Samruk-\nEnergy  to  the  sovereign  wealth  fund  Samruk-Kazyna),  Samruk-Kazyna  became  the  sole \nshareholder of Samruk-Energy. As of the end of 2016, Samruk-Energy had a total of 22,230 \nemployees, with female employees accounting for almost 27.5% of its workforce. \n \n13.  Samruk-Energy  is  involved  in  the  generation,  transmission,  distribution,  sale,  and \npurchase of electricity; the mining and sale of coal; and the generation of heat. The company\u2019s \nvertically  integrated  nature  gives  it  greater  control  over  its  supply  chain  and  distribution \nchannels. A breakdown of its income by segment in 2016 is as follows: electricity generation \n(48%), distribution and sale of electricity (38%), coal production (13%), and other lines of \nbusiness (1%).10 Samruk-Energy is also the largest power generation company in Kazakhstan. \nAs of 31 December 2016, the aggregate installed power generation capacity of Samruk-Energy \nwas 6,804 MW. In FY2016, Samruk-Energy generated 22.5 terawatt-hours of electricity, which \n                                                \n9  Infrastructure investments in renewable energy projects are not a component of the proposed project. Financing for \nthose projects will be sought by Samruk-Energy separately, after the pipeline of the renewable energy projects is \nidentified and feasibility studies are completed. \n10 Samruk-Energy. 2017. Integrated Annual Report 2016. Astana. \n ", "4        \nrepresents  approximately  24%  of  the  total  electricity  generated  in  Kazakhstan  during  that \nperiod. Samruk-Energy has 25 subsidiaries, including two hydropower plants, two wind power \nplants, one solar power plant, four thermal power plants (including combined heat and power \nplants), five power distribution and transmission companies, and several other assets related to \nexploration and production. The privatization plan set by the government envisages the sale of \nall combined heat and power plants, distribution companies, and all other noncore assets. The \ncompany\u2019s strategy is to focus on power generation and dispose businesses (distribution and \nheat and power sales) where tariff adjustments are more delicate because of social sensitivities. \nSales of these assets are expected to be completed by 2020. \n \n14.  Samruk-Energy\u2019s  revenue  decreased  by  18%  from  T221  billion  ($1,213  million)  in \nFY2014  to  T184  billion  ($541  million)  in  FY2015,  with  earnings  before  interest,  taxes, \ndepreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) decreasing from T135 billion ($742 million) in FY2014 \nto T80 billion ($236 million) in FY2015, and the company recording a net loss of T77 billion \n($228 million) in FY2015 compared with a net profit of T13 billion ($73 million) in FY2014. The \ndeterioration in Samruk-Energy\u2019s financial results was caused by (i) a significant decline in \ndemand for electricity because of slowing economic activity, and (ii) foreign exchange loss \nbecause of the dollar-denominated borrowings, which accounted for approximately 60% of the \ntotal borrowing as of the end of FY2015. Profitability, however, stabilized in FY2016, as the \ncompany recorded an EBITDA of T75 billion ($227 million), and net profit of T18 billion ($55 \nmillion), although turnover declined slightly to T181 billion ($544 million) during the year. In \nFY2016, Samruk-Energy had total assets of T1,049 billion ($3,148 million), total liabilities of \nT532 billion ($1,598 million), and a net worth of T517 billion ($1,550 million). \n \n15.  Integrity due diligence was conducted. No significant integrity risks were identified. 11 \nADB\u2019s review of the entity does not give ADB cause to believe that such entity has been \nestablished, or is being used for money laundering, or terrorism financing in the jurisdictions \ninvolved in the project. Tax integrity due diligence was not required.12 \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n16.  Impact. The project is aligned with the following impact: attainment of a competitive \nelectricity generation sector that supports the country\u2019s economic growth by 2023. \n \n17.  Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: improved financial flexibility and \noperational efficiency and competitiveness of Samruk-Energy. \n \n18.  Outputs.  Specific  outputs  of  the  project  will  be  (i)  achievement  of  balance  sheet \nflexibility,  (ii)  completion  of  Samruk-Energy\u2019s  corporate  transformation  program,  and  (iii) \nidentification of a renewable energy project pipeline.13 \n \n \n \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2003.

Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n19.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, which identifies environment and climate change and \ninfrastructure development as two of the four strategic priorities to sharpen the focus of ADB \noperations.14 ADB\u2019s support for the project is in line with its country partnership strategy for \nKazakhstan, 2017\u20132021 and its country operations business plan for Kazakhstan, 2018\u20132020,15 \nwhich focus on energy sector and private sector development. The project is also in line with the \nstrategy of the government to reduce its carbon footprint.16  \n \n20.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project is also \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy,  which  emphasizes  investments  in  energy  efficiency, \nrenewable  energy  projects,  private  sector  participation,  wider  access  to  energy,  and \nenhancement of the viability of the energy sector.17 \n \nD.

The  project  will  be  ADB\u2019s  first-ever  nonsovereign  transaction  with  a  state-owned \nenterprise  in  Kazakhstan.  Enhancing  the  financial  flexibility  and  supporting  efficiency \nimprovements in a state-owned enterprise that has a strong presence in the power sector would \nhave a cascading effect on the economy of Kazakhstan, by way of reducing overall power \nprices in the long term. This project is also the first nonsovereign transaction being jointly \nprocessed by ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) and Central and West Asia \nDepartment  (CWRD).  The  project  provides  a  strong  opportunity  for  PSOD  and  CWRD  to \nleverage their respective areas of expertise. CWRD\u2019s sector-level engagement, policy dialogue, \nand  technical  assistance  (TA)  being  provided  to  Samruk-Energy  have  led  to  the  project\u2019s \norigination and due diligence.18 PSOD is primarily responsible for the financial structuring of the \ntransaction and commercial due diligence. Lessons learned from this joint engagement will form \npossible future approaches to joint project preparation by PSOD and ADB regional departments. \n                                                \n14 ADB. 2014.

The proposed ADB assistance comprises an unsecured corporate finance loan of up to \n$120 million equivalent in tenge with a maximum tenor of 7 years. In line with Samruk-Energy\u2019s \nneeds and ADB\u2019s ability to raise funding from the local market, the loan may be split into \ntranches with multiple repayment dates.  \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n26.  ADB is already supporting Kazakhstan\u2019s energy sector to achieve its intended nationally \ndetermined contribution (footnote 16) and renewable power generation targets (footnote 7). In \nparticular, ADB\u2019s assistance supported the preparation and design of a framework for auctions \nof  renewable  energy  projects.  Two  other  ongoing  TA  projects  are  supporting  the  system \noperator to plan generation and transmission systems and install modernized control techniques \nto address renewable energy intermittency.19 These activities are expected to spur investments \nin the electricity sector, which needs billions of dollars to rehabilitate and expand (footnote 4). \nThe  proposed  project  contributes  to  the  same  goal  of  making  necessary  investments  by \nproviding long-term tenge financing, which is currently insufficient in Kazakhstan. Balance sheet \nflexibility through the reduction of foreign currency risk by refinancing dollar-denominated debt \nwith long-term tenge financing will free up resources for Samruk-Energy for future development \nand  preparations  for  the  upcoming  IPO.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  will  enable  Samruk-Energy  to \nundertake capital expenditures with long payback periods through efficiency measures and \ninitiate the identification of a renewable projects pipeline.  \n \n27.  In  addition,  the  benefits  from  the  reduction  of  Samruk-Energy\u2019s  dollar-denominated \nborrowing will be channeled to end customers by partially protecting them from electricity tariff \nescalations  caused  by  future  foreign  exchange  devaluations.  Furthermore,  improved \ncompetitiveness  and  the  reduced  cost  of  electricity  of  Samruk-Energy\u2014the  largest  power \ngeneration company in Kazakhstan\u2014will provide economic benefits to the entire economy.20 \n \nC.

Through \nthis  TA,  ADB  will  continue  policy  dialogue  with  the  government  on  the  progress  of  the \nprivatization of major SOEs\u2014such as Samruk-Energy\u2014to a more competitive environment. \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n30.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \ncategory  C  for  environment,  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  category  C  for \nindigenous peoples. The potential environmental and social impacts of the project have been \nidentified, and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse \nimpacts are incorporated in the safeguard reports and plans.
