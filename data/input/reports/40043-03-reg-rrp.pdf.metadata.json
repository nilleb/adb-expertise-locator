The \nobjective  is  to  export  Tajik  summer  electricity  surpluses  of  up  to  300  megawatts  (MW)  to \nAfghanistan, which has an energy deficit. The project was first conceived and approved by the \nAsian  Development  Bank (ADB)  in  2006.1   Construction  on  the Tajik side  has  progressed  well \nand will be completed as scheduled in late 2010, but the construction of the larger portion of the \nproject  on  the  Afghan  side  is  behind  schedule.  The  late  start-up  in  construction  and  later, \nmounting security problems in the project area in 2009 delayed the work and increased costs. A \nfunding  gap  of  $12  million  needs  additional  finance.  The  design,  characteristics,  and  scope  of \nthe project remain unchanged.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe  project  promotes  regional  cooperation  and  energy  security  in  Afghanistan  and \nexport  revenues  for  Tajikistan.  It  reinforces  energy  work  under  the  Central  Asia  Regional \nEconomic  Cooperation  program,  and  is  a  means  to  expand  energy  security  and  trade  in  the \nregion.  Afghanistan  has  an  energy  deficit  and  Tajikistan  a  surplus  in  summer.  The  operation \ncontributes to energy trade in the region and complements another project financed by ADB to \nbuild a transmission line from Uzbekistan to Afghanistan. The design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 1. \n \nC. \n \nThe  project,  including  taxes,  duties,  and  interest  during  construction,  was  originally \n4. \nestimated  at  $55.5 million  (Table  1  and  Table  A3.1  summarize  the  original  cost  and financing \nplan). ADB provided a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR23,563,000 ($35 million) to \nAfghanistan from its Special Funds resources. Originally, the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust \nFund  was  to  provide  $16.5  million  in  cofinancing,  but  was  later  replaced  by  the  Islamic \nDevelopment Bank, which is still a cofinancing partner.  \n \nD. \n \n5. \nThe  Afghan  portion  of  the  transmission  line  has  two  components:  (i)  an  157-kilometer \n(km) 220-kilovolt transmission line from Sherkan Bandar to Pul-e-Khumri substation, and (ii) two \nsubstations in Kunduz and Baghlan financed by the Islamic Development Bank. A condition to \nstart project implementation was the signing of a power purchasing agreement, as it would have \nbeen inappropriate and risky to construct a transmission line without a commercial agreement in \n\nStatus of and Progress in Project Implementation \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n                                                \n1  ADB. 2006.  Report and Recommendation of the President to the  Board of Directors: Proposed Loans, Technical \nAssistance  Grants,  and  Administration  of  Loan  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Afghanistan  and  the  Republic  of \nTajikistan for the Regional Power Transmission Interconnection Project. Manila (Loan 2304-AFG and Loan 2303-\nTAJ, approved on 28 November). \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nplace.  Although all the principles behind this agreement had been defined and accepted prior to \nADB\u201fs  approval  of  the  project,  final  negotiations  between  the  parties  turned  out  to  be  much \nslower than expected. The main stumbling block was the price. The agreement was signed only \non 29 August 2008, after a 15-month impasse that derailed the original implementation plan, a \nproblem later compounded by mounting security problems in the Afghan project area and rising \ncosts.  On  1  April  2009,  ADB  approved  an  extension  of  the  loan  closing.  Although  the \ntransmission line can still be completed in early 2011 to carry summer electricity from Tajikistan, \nthe operation urgently needs an additional $12 million. The 117-km line on the Tajik side will be \ncompleted by the end of 2010. \n \n6. \nAs of mid-September 2010, project implementation stood at almost 70% completion with \nan elapsed loan period of 133%. The Ministry of Energy and Water, the executing agency, is in \nthe  process  of  complying  with  many  of  the  loan  covenants.  Full  compliance  is  expected  by \nproject completion. The latest project performance report is in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY GRANT  \n\n \n\nThe Cost Overrun \n\nImpact on the Project \n\nA. \n \n7. \nThe  contractor  requires  a  contract  variation  to  accomplish  the  line  works  and  meet \nincreases  in  the  cost  of  equipment,  labor  and  materials  (Appendix  2).  Due  diligence  by  ADB \nmissions,2 and  discussions  with  the  contractor  and  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Water  suggest \nthe contract variation is justified. The overall cost increase is $12 million.  \n \nB. \n \n8. \nThe  original  project  remains  unchanged,  as  do  its  fundamentals.  Tajikistan  offers  to \nAfghanistan power that is significantly less expensive than Afghanistan can currently access.3 If \nthe transmission  line  is not  built,  Afghanistan  will  have to  pay  an  additional  $15  million for  the \nleast-cost alternative, and Tajikistan will lose $21 million in annual sales as the country does not \nhave alternative uses for the power in the summer and must spill the water without generating \nenergy. The project is a win\u2500win situation for both.  \n \nC. \n \n9. \nThe  policy  criteria  and  eligibility  criteria  have  been  met  and  even  with  the  additional \nfinancing,  the  approved  project  will  remain  technically  feasible,  economically  viable,  and \nfinancially  sustainable.  As  the  supplementary  financing  is  to  support  the  existing  approved \nimpact, outcome and output, no new design and monitoring framework has been prepared. The \nframework will be updated when the activities have been confirmed. \n \nD. \n \n10. \ncomparison of the original and revised cost estimates. \n \n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  project  will  rise  to  $67.9  million  (Appendix  3).  Table  1  provides  a \n\nRevised Cost Estimates \n\nRationale \n\n                                                \n2  Review missions to Afghanistan in March, June, and August 2010. \n3  According to the power purchasing agreement, in 2011, Tajikistan would sell 597.1 gigawatt hours (GWh) of power \nto Afghanistan at $0.035/kilowatt hour (kWh). In 2009, Afghanistan imported 660 GWh of power from Uzbekistan at \na tariff of $0.06/kWh. \n\n\fTable 1: Consolidated Total Project Cost \n($ million) \nOriginal 2006 \nCost Estimate \n(2006) \n\nCost Increase \n(Supplementary \nFinancing) \n\n \n \n\nRevised \nCost Estimate \n(2010) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n46.0 \n\n9.4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n55.4 \n \n5.5 \n5.9 \n66.8 \n1.1 \n67.9 \n\nItems \n \nA.

ADB estimates. \n \nE. \n \n11. \nThe  Government  of  Afghanistan  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  a  grant  of  $12  million \nfrom ADB\u201fs Special Funds resources. The Islamic Development Bank is an alternative financing \nsource  but  does  not  now  have  additional  resources  for  Afghanistan.  The  government  and  the \nreconstruction trust funds are also constrained in terms of resources.

The contract for the main contractor and the supervising consultant will \nbe revised through variation order to accommodate this change. A variation order is appropriate \ndue  to  the  \u201cdesign  and  build\u201d  nature  of  the  original  contract  which  was  awarded  based  on \nestimated  quantities.  The  actual  quantities,  as  confirmed  by  the  approved  design,  have \nincreased because of an increase in line length and the need for additional towers per kilometer \ndue  to  the  more  difficult  terrain  than  originally  envisaged.  The  additional  estimates  are  an \nintegral  component  of  the  overall  design  making  separate  procurement  not  feasible.  The \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nsupervising consultant will certify the quality of the works and act as the first clearance point for \nauthorizing payments.  \n \n13. \nADB  Management  has,  in  principle,  approved  retroactive  financing  using  up  to  20%  of \nthe grant proceeds for eligible expenditures incurred during the period not exceeding 12 months \nprior to signing of the grant agreement. \n \n14. \nThe  original  report  and  recommendation  of  the  President  states  that  the  Ministry  of \nEnergy  and  Water,  as  the  executing  agency,  has  overall  responsibility  for  implementing  the \nproject,  specifically,  mobilizing  financing,  completing  works,  testing  and  commissioning.  The \nformer  Afghanistan  Electricity  Agency \nthe \nimplementation  agency  responsible  for  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  project  facilities. \nAccordingly, most  of the  implementation  work  to  date,  prior  to  project facilities  completion  and \nbecoming  operational,  has  been  carried  out  by  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Water  as  the \nexecuting agency. \n \nIn September 2009, DABM was liquidated and Afghanistan Electricity Company (DABS) \n15. \nwas established as the national electricity utility  company in Afghanistan with its own statutes, \nbusiness  strategy,  and  mandate.  Currently,  the  government  remains  the  sole  shareholder  of \nDABS,  but  the  firm  has  an  independent  management  team.  As  the  assets  and  liabilities  of \nDABM  had  been  transferred  to  DABS,  DABS  became  the  successor  of  DABM  as  the \nimplementing agency for the operation and maintenance for project facilities and, in particular, a \nparty  to  the  project  agreement,  subsidiary  loan  agreement  and  power  purchasing  agreement \n(each as defined in the  loan  agreement  dated  20 May  2007). The  same  terms  and  conditions \nwill apply other than adjustments required to reflect the corporatization of DABM into DABS.  \n\n(DABM),  a  state-owned  enterprise,  was \n\n \n16. \nAs  discussed  in  the  context  of  the  Energy  Sector  Development  Investment  Program \napproved  in  November  2008,4 the  liquidation  of  DABM  and  establishment  of  DABS  with  the \nthe \naccompanying \ngovernment  is  an  essential  first  step  toward  improving  the  energy  sector  in  Afghanistan.  ADB \nhas  supported  the  transformation  and  the  investment  program  envisaged  the  medium-term \npartnership of ADB, the government, and DABS.  \n\nintroduction  of  better  operating  practices  and \n\nindependence \n\nfrom \n\n \n17. \nExcept  for  the  above  mentioned  changes,  no  other  changes  in  implementation \narrangements resulting from the  proposed supplementary financing are proposed. If the  board \napproves the proposed supplementary grant, then changes to the implementation arrangements \nin relation to the original loan (footnote 1) will be made in accordance with ADB procedures. \n\n \nThe  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  Loan  Disbursement \n18. \nHandbook (2007, revised from time to time). The original loan (footnote 1) will be disbursed on a \nfront load basis.  \n \n\n                                                \n4  ADB.  2008.

The financial internal rate of \nreturn  was  recalculated  and  stands  at  9.8%  compared  with  the  original  12.4%.  This  still \ncompares  favorably  to  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  0%.  The  revised  financial  and \neconomic analysis is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \nB. \n \nAll safeguard categorizations remain unchanged. There are no pending issues, although \n20. \nland  acquisition  in  some  sections  of  the  project  was  delayed.    The  matter  was  resolved  and \npayment instructions made. \n  \nC. \n \n21. \nCost  risks  are  to  be  contained  by  incorporating  clauses  fixing  the  price  and  delivery \nperiod  clauses  in  the  primary  contractor  contract.  All  cost  estimates  have  been  validated  by \nADB  teams.  Security  will  always  remain  a  risk.  The  Ministry  of  Interior  will  continue  to  deploy \npersonnel  in  the  area.

The contract allowed payment to the \ncontractor to be based on actual quantities built, with unit rates to be escalated in accordance \nwith  an  agreed  price  escalation  formula.  The  supervision  consultant  was  engaged  to  help \nmonitor  quality  and  calculate  the  assumed  quantities  based  on  line  length  and  estimated \nnumber of towers.   \n \n2. \nThe  quantity  of  materials  on  the  Afghan  portion  of  the  line,  the  larger  share  of  the \nproject, first increased with increases in line length and the number of towers per kilometer. The \nline length increased because a portion of it needed to be rerouted away from a populated area. \nThe  quantity  of  materials  per  kilometer  increased  as  the  terrain  was  more  difficult  than \nenvisaged.  Unit rates increased based on the contract escalation formula.
