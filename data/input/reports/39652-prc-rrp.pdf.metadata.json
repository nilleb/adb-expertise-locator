A summary environmental impact assessment for the \nProject 1  was  prepared  and  circulated \nthe  Board  on  \n10 April 2006.  \n \nThe  Investment  Program  is  located  in  remote  rural  areas  of \nZhangye  City  (Zhangye)  of  Gansu  Province  (Gansu),  a  poor \nwestern  province.  The  Investment  Program  will  partially  finance \nthe  Heihe  river  cascade  hydropower  development  scheme,  a \ninfrastructure  project  with  seven  discrete  run-of-river \nlarge \nmedium  hydropower  plants  (HPPs).  Construction  of  the  scheme, \nwhich \nin  1996,  will  develop  an  aggregated \n645.5 megawatts (MW) of hydropower. Of the seven HPPs in the \nscheme, two are already in operation. Two more HPPs are under \nconstruction  and  will  be \nin  2006\u20132007.  The \nInvestment Program involves construction of the next two HPPs in \nthe  scheme\u2014(i)  Project  1,  50.5  MW  Erlongshan  HPP;  and \n(ii) Project 2, 60 MW Dagushan HPP. The remaining 112 MW Bao \nPinghe HPP on the scheme is expected to be constructed through \npublic-private  partnership.  A  parallel  rural  grid  improvement \nproject to renovate, modernize, and strengthen the 10 kilovolt (kV) \nand 35 kV electricity distribution networks is being financed by the \nGansu  provincial  government  (GPG)  to  provide  improved  and \nreliable electricity supply to rural consumers in Zhangye. Capacity \nbuilding  of  the  project  implementing  agencies  (PIAs)  has  been \ncarried out as part of the project preparatory technical assistance \n(TA).  \n \nThe development of the scheme is consistent with GPG\u2019s priority \nand  plan  to  promote  hydropower  development  in  Zhangye  and \nGansu \nin  an \nenvironmentally  sustainable  manner.  The  scheme  is  an  integral \npart  of  the  power  system  planning  and  least-cost  generation \nto  provide  additional  generation \nexpansion  plan \ncapacity.  The  scheme  is  a  core  infrastructure  project  included  in \nthe  Zhangye  city  government\u2019s  (ZCGs)  investment  plan  for \n2006\u20132010.  The  scheme  is  part  of  the  Heihe  river  basin  plan, \nprepared by the Ministry of Water Resources and approved by the \nState Council in 2001.     \n \n\nthe  growing  electricity  demand \n\nin  operation \n\nin  Gansu \n\nto  meet \n\n\fii \n\nMultitranche \nFacility \n\nFinancing \n\n \nRationale \n\nThe multitranche financing facility (MFF) amounting to $50 million \nwill help fund the Investment Program and represents about 45% \nof  the  total  financing.  The  individual  and  periodic  financing \nrequests  (PFR)  will  be  converted  into  two  loans  in  line  with \nindividual  project  readiness,  as  well  as  policy,  safeguards, \nfinancial  management,  and  fiduciary  oversight.  The  project  loans \nwill  be  made  from  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR)  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). The utilization period of the facility will \nbe  7  years.  The  Government  has  entered  into  a  Framework \nFinancing  Agreement  (FFA)  with  ADB.  Pursuant  to  the  FFA,  the \nGovernment has submitted to ADB the first PFR in the amount of \n$22 million. The first PFR is presented to the Board together with \nthe  FFA.  Prior  to  ADB  acceptance  of  the  second  PFR,  ADB  will \nensure that the Government, the Executing Agency (EA), and the \nPIA  comply  fully  with  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  FFA.  An \nADB  team  will  conduct  due  diligence  to  this  effect  to  ensure  that \nthe  terms  and  conditions  are  satisfactorily  adhered  to.  The \nindividual  PFR  should  be  for  a  minimum  loan  amount  of  \n$20 million. \n \nPRC\u2019s  sustained  economic  growth  and  low  per  capita  energy \nconsumption  are  driving  up  the  demand  for  electricity,  which  has \noutpaced economic growth in the last 3 years. The result is power \nshortages  in  many  parts  of  the  PRC.  The  power  shortages  have \naffected  the  rural  population  disproportionately.  With  coal-fired \npower plants supplying about 81% of the country\u2019s electricity, the \nelectricity  sector  is  a  major  air  polluter.  More  than  60%  of  the \ncities do not meet air quality standards. Acid rain falls on one third \nof  the  country.  The  Government  is  committed  to  minimize \nemissions  and  improve  air  quality.  In  2006,  it  enacted  the \nRenewable  Energy  Law,  which  is  expected  to  lead  to  about \n120  gigawatts  (GW)  of  additional  clean  and  renewable  energy  in \nthe country by 2020. Small and medium hydropower development \nis  an  integral  part  of  the  renewable  energy  program  and  is \nexpected to provide 80 GW of the additional capacity by 2020.  \n \nIn Gansu, about 81% of the electricity was produced by coal-fired \npower  plants  in  2005.  Thirteen  of  Gansu\u2019s  14  cities  do  not  meet \nair  quality  standards;  its  capital,  Lanzhou,  has  the  worst  air \npollution index  of  47  major  cities.  Some  parts  of  Gansu,  such  as \nthe  Hexi  corridor,  have  faced  chronic  power  shortages  due  to \nlimited local generation capacity and large distances from nearby \npower  plants.  Heihe  river,  flowing  in  the  remote  mountainous \nareas  of  Zhangye,  a  predominantly  rural  area  located  in  the \nmiddle of the Hexi corridor, presents an excellent source of clean \nand  renewable  energy  closer  to  the  power-deficient  area  in \nGansu. ZCG and GPG are committed to utilize this clean energy \nsource to provide benefits to Zhangye and the Hexi corridor in an \nenvironmentally sustainable manner.  \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nThe Investment Plan \n\nthe \n\nrationale \n\nin  Zhangye  have  created \n\nADB  has  an  ongoing  successful  engagement  with  one  of  the \nseven HPPs of the scheme. ADB approved a project loan in 2003 \nto  support  construction  of  the  102  MW  Xiaogushan  HPP,  which \nwas  completed  in  July  2006,  1  year  ahead  of  schedule.  Project \nimplementation is rated as \u201chighly satisfactory\u201d and has complied \nwith all covenants. The PIA, ZCG, and GPG are fully familiar with \nADB  requirements  and  have  the  required  capacity  to  implement \nthe Investment Program.  \n \nADB  is  also  supporting  the  development  of  clean  and  renewable \nenergy  in  Gansu  since  2001.  The  enactment  of  the  Renewable \nEnergy Law, and GPG and ZCG commitment to utilize clean and \nthe  enabling \nrenewable  energy \nconditions  for  accelerated  hydropower  development  on  Heihe \nin \nriver.  ADB\u2019s  previous  engagement \nthe  scheme  has \nstrengthened \nInvestment  Program. \nthe \nfor \nConsidering  the  discrete  components  of  the  scheme,  sequential \nconstruction, and staggered financing needs, the MFF is the most \nappropriate financing tool for the Investment Program.  \n \nThe Investment Program will provide environmentally clean power \nsupply  to  support  economic  growth  in  the  rural  areas  of  Gansu. \nThis is achieved by providing hydropower generation closer to the \nrural  areas  in  Zhangye  and  the  Hexi  corridor.  This  additional \ngeneration  capacity  in  conjunction  with  the  ongoing  and  planned \nGovernment-financed  rural  grid  rehabilitation  and  modernization \nprogram  will  (i)  meet  the  additional  rural  power  demand  to \novercome shortages; (ii) improve the reliability of power supply to \nrural  areas;  (iii)  facilitate  loss  reduction;  and  (iv)  advance  policy \nreforms in the areas of clean and renewable energy development \nin Zhangye and Gansu.  \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Investment  Program  is  estimated  at \n$110  million  equivalent, \ntaxes  and  duties  of \n$5.13 million.  \n\nincluding \n\n($ million) \n\nItem  \n1.

The Financing \nwill  be  subject  to  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility,  the  applicable  commitment  charge  and  such  other  terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \nThe  Government  has  the  option  to  choose  between  eligible \ncurrencies and interest rate regimes, most suitable for each loan. \nADB  provides  flexibility  in  terms  of  repayment  and  interest  rate \nswaps  during  the  financing  period  in  accordance  with  the  FFA, \nrelevant Loan regulations, and draft loan and project agreements. \nRepayment  schedules  can  be  structured  in  line  with  the  specific \nneeds of individual loans.  \n \nThe ADB loan proceeds will be made available by the Borrower to \nGPG  and  ZCG  and  then  re-lent  to  the  relevant  PIA  through  a \nsubsidiary  loan  agreement  under  the  same  terms  and  conditions \nas  the  ADB  loan.  The  foreign  exchange  risk  and  interest  rate \nvariation risks will be borne by the relevant PIA.   \n \nRetroactive financing has been approved for the PFRs under the \nMFF  up  to  20%  of  the  proceeds  from  individual  loans\u2014provided \nthat  expenditures  are  incurred  in  accordance  with  agreed-upon \nprocedures  and  during  the  12  months  before  signing  of  the \ncorresponding  individual  loan  agreement  and  loan  effectiveness. \nThe  Government  has  been  informed  that  approval  of  retroactive \nfinancing does not commit ADB to financing any project.   \n \nUntil  31  December  2013.  The  closing  date  for  the  submission  of \nthe PFR is 30 June 2010. Each loan will have its own closing date \nto match its implementation period.   \n\n\f31 December 2013 \n\nEstimated Investment \nProgram Completion \nDate \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nrequested  by \n\nto  promote  hydropower  development \n\n \nGansu provincial government  \n \nThe Investment Program will be implemented over 7 years. GPG \nwill  be  the  EA.  The  projects  will  be  implemented  by  PIAs,  which \nwill  be  project  companies  created  out  of  the  Heihe  Hydropower \nDevelopment  Company  (HHDC).  HHDC  was  formed  in  2000  by \nZCG \nin  Zhangye. \nErlongshan  Hydropower  Company  has  already  been  created  as \nthe  PIA  for  Project  1.  To  facilitate  national  approvals,  land \nacquisition, licensing arrangements, and to address environmental \nand  social  safeguard  issues  related  to  the  Investment  Program,  \nZCG  has  formed  a  lead  group  headed  by  a  vice  mayor  of \nZhangye.  A  project  implementing  unit  (PIU)  in  each  PIA  will  be \nresponsible  for  managing,  coordinating,  and  supervising  project \nimplementation. The PIU is headed by a project manager.  \n \nCivil  works  and  goods  financed  from  the  proceeds  of  the  ADB \nloans  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines.  Advance  contracting  was \nthe \nGovernment. The Government has been informed that approval of \nadvance contracting does not commit ADB to finance any project.  \n \nConsulting  services  of  12  person-months\u20142  international  and  \n10 national\u2014will be provided to assist the PIA with implementing \nProject 1, especially in areas of compliance with safeguard issues, \nand in project monitoring, control, and reporting. For Project 2, the \nPIA  and  GPG  will  assess  the  person-months  and  nature  of  the \nrequired  consulting  services  input  before  finalizing  the  second \nPFR. All consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n \nThe  Investment  Program  will  improve  the  reliability  of  electricity \nsupply to rural consumers in Zhangye and the Hexi corridor. The \nInvestment  Program  will  have  significant  positive  environment \nimpacts in terms of air pollution avoided from alternative sources. \nThe  system  planning  and  least-cost  analysis  show  that  the \nalternative  will  be  a  coal-fired  power  plant.  Based  on  this \nalternative,  the  avoided  emissions  were  estimated  at  a  yearly \naverage of 260 tons (t) total suspended particulate, 2,100 t sulfur \ndioxide (SO2), 1,550 t nitrogen oxide (NOx), and 382,000 t carbon \ndioxide  (CO2).  On  completion,  the  Investment  Program  will  avoid \nabout 1 million t of coal use per year of operation. \n \n \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject  Benefits \nBeneficiaries \n\nand \n\n \n\nv \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\nThe Investment Program will be carried out in a poor remote rural \ntownship.  It  will  require  no  resettlement,  only  small  nonfarming \nland  will  be  occupied,  affecting  less  than  15  households  in  all.  It \nwill provide significant direct benefits to local communities through \nemployment generated during construction and operation, access \nto  project  hospitals  and  schools,  additional  economic  activities \nthat  may  be  supported by  more  affordable  and  reliable  electricity \nsupply.  The  Investment  Program  will  also  provide  significant \nadditional tax revenue to the local county government, which may \nbe utilized to accelerate economic development.  \n \nThe projects under the Investment  Program are financially viable \nand  economically  attractive.  For  Project  1,  the  financial  internal \nrate of return is 5.84%, which is higher than the weighted average \ncost  of  capital  of  4.17%.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is \n19.60%, higher than the ADB hurdle rate of 12%. Sensitivity tests \nand  risk  analysis  show  that  Project  1  will  be  economically  and \nfinancially viable even under a combination of adverse scenarios. \nThe  potential  carbon  revenues  under  the  clean  development \nmechanism (CDM) will further improve the financial and economic \nbenefits  from  the  Investment  Program.  The  CDM  benefits  are \nlikely  to  provide  additional  revenues  estimated  to  be  about \n10\u201315% of the project costs. \n \nThe HPPs in the Investment Program have mainly geological and \nhydrological \nthe  cost,  delay  \nimplementation, or reduce energy output. The projects included in \nthe Investment Program are part of an ongoing large infrastructure \nproject\u2014Heihe  river  cascade  hydropower  development  scheme, \nwhich  is  partially  complete.  The  PIA,  design  institute,  and \ncontractors  have  sufficient  knowledge  and  prior  expertise  and \nexperience  to  design,  construct  and  manage  the  HPPs  in  the \nprevailing  geological  conditions.  The  geological  condition  has \nbeen  thoroughly  investigated  and  the  civil  work  contracts  will \ninclude  the  results  of  the  geological  investigations  and  the \npotential  geological  risks.  The  hydrological  data  for  the  last  \n60 years were thoroughly investigated by experts to estimate the \nenergy  output.  The  associated  risk  is  small.  The  last  HPP  is  a \nstand-alone  project.  The  delay  in  implementing  the  last  HPP  will \nnot  in  any  way  affect  the  viability  of  the  projects  included  in  the \nInvestment Program.  \n \nThe  parent  company  of  PIAs,  ZCG,  and  GPG  are  familiar  with \nADB  procedures  and  requirements  from  experience  in  another \nHPP  development  in  the  scheme  with  ADB  financing.  The  PIAs \nand  GPG  have  the  required  capacity  to  manage  implementation \nof  projects  under  the  Investment  Program\u2014on schedule, within \n \n\nrisks,  which  could \n\nincrease \n\n\f \n\n \n\nthe  budget,  and  to  the  required  quality  meeting  safeguard \nstandards.  GPG  and  ZCG  are  committed  to  implementing  the \nInvestment  Program.  The  associated  implementation  risk  is \nminimal. \n \nThe  electricity  tariffs  for  the  Investment  Program  will  be  fixed  by \nthe  Price  Bureau \nin  Gansu  Province,  before  commercial \noperations of individual projects start. Since the start of 2006, the \nNational  Development  and  Reform  Commission  has  been \nannouncing the regulated tariffs for the new power plants in each \nprovince. The assumed tariff reflects the prevailing regulated tariff \nand  a  conservative  approach  was  adopted  in  the  financial \nanalysis.  The  assumption  on  tariff  is  likely  to  hold  true  in  view  of \nthe  past  history  of  full  cost  recoverable  regulated  tariff  and  its \nconsistent application. The associated commercial risk is small.   \n \nIn line with the rural development emphasis in the 11th Five-Year \nPlan, the Government is committed to strengthen the rural power \ninfrastructure. The rural grid improvement project and the uniform \nurban-rural  tariff  is  a  work  in  progress  with  strong  commitment \nfrom  the  Government.  The  related  assumptions are  likely  to  hold \ntrue.  \n \n\nvii \n\n \n\n\f96  00'Eo\n\nMONGOLIA\n\no\n106  00'E\n\nX I N J I A N G   U Y G U R\nA U T O N O M O U S\nR E G I O N\n\nGANSU HEIHE RURAL HYDROPOWER\nDEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT PROGRAM\nIN THE\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\n40  00'No\n\nDunhuang\n\nYumen\n\nJinta\n\nJiayuguan\n\nJiuquan\n\nGaotai\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\nKilometers\n\n40  00'No\n\nI N N E R   M O N G O L I A\n\nN\n\nLinze\n\nZhangye\n\nHeihe R.\n\nMinle\n\nMinqin\n\nJinchang\n\nWuwei\n\nGulang\n\nN I N G X I A\n\nJingtai\n\nBaiyin Jingyuan\n\nLANZHOU\n\nDingxi\n\nLinxia\n\nZhang Xian\n\nLinlan\n\nTianshui\n\nCheng Xian\n\nWudu\n\nINVESTMENT PROGRAM AREA\n\nTianzhu Zangzu Zizhixian\n\nQ I N G H A I\n\nHuan Xian\n\nXifeng\n\nPingliang\n\nS H A A N X I\n\n34  00'No\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nNational Road\n\nOther Road\n\nRailway\n\nRiver\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\n34  00'No\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\n0\n6\n-\n2\n9\n6\n3\na\nH\nR\n\n96  00'Eo\n\nS I C H U A N\n\no\n106  00'E\n\nM\na\np\n1\n\n\fo\n98  00'E\n\nJiayuguan\n\nJiuquan\n\nJingtieshan\n\no\n39  00'N\n\nGaotai\n\nSunan Yugurzu\nZizhixian\n\nDAGUSHAN\nHYDROPOWER\nPLANT\n\nERLONGSHAN\nHYDROPOWER\nPLANT\n\nLinze\n\nI N N E R\nM O N G O L I A\n\nZhangye\n\nShandan\n\nXishui\n\nSidalong\n\nHuazhai\n\nAnyang\n\nMati\n\nMinle\n\nBAO PINGHE\nHYDROPOWER\nPLANT\n\nHEIHE RIVER\nCASCADE HYDROPOWER\nDEVELOPMENT SCHEME\n\nXidong\n\nQ I N G H A I\n\nLongshui 1 Hydropower Plant\n\n102  00'Eo\n\nGANSU HEIHE RURAL HYDROPOWER\nDEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT PROGRAM\nIN THE\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\nN\n\no\n39  00'N\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\nKilometers\n\nJinchang\n\nMinqin\n\nYongchang\n\nXincheng\n\nWuwei\n\nI N N E R\nM O N G O L I A\n\nHydropower Plant\n\nCompleted\n\nUnder Construction\n\nHuangcheng\n\nIncluded in the Investment Program\n\nPlanned\n\nQilianshan National Natural Reserve (QNNR)\n\nGulang\n\no\n37  30'N\n\nTianzhu Zangzu\nZizhixian\n\no\n37  30'N\n\nLongshui 2 Hydropower Plant\n\nHeihe River\n\nXiaogushan Hydropower Plant\n(ADB Loan 2032-PRC)\n\nXishui\n\nDagushan Hydropower Plant\n\ny\n\nl\n\nG u l\n\nu\n\no\n\ng\n\nn\n\na\n\ng\n\ng\n\nn\n\na\n\nC h\n\nYongge\n\nErlongshan Hydropower Plant\n\nX\n\ni\n\nl\n\ni\n\nu\n\ns\n\nh\n\nu\n\ni\n\nC\n\nr\n\ne\n\ne\n\nk\n\nH\n\neihe River\n\nSandaowan Hydropower Plant\n\nBao Pinghe Hydropower Plant\n\nQNNR Core Zone\n\nQNNR Experimental Zone\n\nCity/Prefecture Government\n\nCounty Seat\n\nNational Road\n\nOther Road\n\nRailway\n\nRiver\n\nQNNR Buffer Zone\n\nCounty Boundary\n\nPrefecture Boundary\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\n0\n6\n-\n2\n9\n6\n3\nb\nH\nR\n\no\n98  00'E\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\n102  00'Eo\n\nQNNR - Qilianshan National Natural Reserve \n\nM\na\np\n\n2\n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \n1. \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the People's Republic of China (PRC) for the Gansu Heihe \nRural Hydropower Development Investment Program. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe PRC has achieved and sustained an impressive economic growth averaging about 9% \nfor  the  past  two  decades.  Compared  with  its  2000  level,  the  economy  is  expected  to  double  by \n2010  and  quadruple  by  2020.  Given  the  projected  growth  trajectory  and  the  relatively  low1 per \ncapita  energy  consumption  of  about  0.66  ton  of  oil  equivalent  (toe)  per  annum,  the  demand  for \nenergy is expected to increase rapidly. The rapid pace of economic growth has created a strong \ndemand  for  electricity.  Per  capita  electricity  consumption  has  more  than  quintupled,  increasing \nfrom 340 kilowatt-hours (kWh) in 1983 to 1,840 kWh in 2005.  \n \n3. \nAfter  the  United  States,  the  PRC  has  the  second  largest  electricity  industry  in  the  world. \nBoth the installed generation capacity and electricity generation increased at an annual average of \nmore than 8% over the past two decades. Since 2002, the electricity demand has increased at an \naverage of more than 13%. This resulted in serious power shortages in many areas of the PRC. By \nthe end of 2005, the total installed capacity reached 508 gigawatts (GW) and electricity generation \ntotaled 2,470 terawatt-hours (TWh), an increase of 13% over 2004. In the past 2 years, 117 GW of \nnew  generation  capacity  was  added  to  overcome  electricity  shortages.  To  meet  the  projected \ndemand, the installed capacity will have to double from the 2005 level to about 1,000 GW in 2020. \nOne  of  the  key  challenges  to  maintain  the  sustained  economic  growth  is  to  significantly  lower \nenergy intensity.2 Energy conservation and improved energy efficiency in the electricity sector are \nthe highest priorities of the Government.  \n \n4. \nIn  the  PRC,  electricity  is  produced  overwhelmingly  by  coal.  In  2005,  the  coal-fired  power \nplants produced about 81%, while the hydropower plants (HPPs) produced only 15%. The PRC is \nnow  the  world\u2019s  largest  coal  producer  and  consumer.  Production  of  raw  coal  has  more  than \ndoubled in 5 years, from 1 billion tons (t) in 2000 to 2.18 billion t in 2005\u2014more than 37% of global \nproduction.  The  electricity  sector  is  the  largest  consumer  of  coal;  it  consumed  about  54%  of  the \ncoal produced in 2005, which has resulted in serious environmental problems\u201450% of the nation\u2019s \nsulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions, 80% of nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions, and 26% of carbon dioxide \n(CO2)  emissions.  Coal  consumption  is  the  major  cause  of  poor  air  quality.  Acid  rain  caused \nprimarily by SO2 and NOx falls on one third of the country. In 2005, of the PRC\u2019s 342 major cities, \nonly 128 met the acceptable air quality standards\u2014national class II air quality standards. Six of the \nworld\u2019s most polluted cities are in the PRC. Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu Province has the worst \nair  pollution  index  of  47  key  national  environment  cities.  A  combination  of  coal  combustion  and \ndesertification  causes  poor  air  quality.  Of  Gansu\u2019s  14  cities,  13  cities  do  not  meet  acceptable \nstandards.  \n \n5. \nAbout 59% of the PRC\u2019s population of approximately 1.3 billion lives in rural areas that have \nexperienced rapid development in the last 10 years in parallel with national economic growth. The \nGovernment has made targeted attempts to provide universal access to electricity. With about 76% \n\n                                                 \n1  About one eighth that of the United States\u2019 per capita energy consumption.  \n2  Energy  intensity  is  the  amount  of  primary  energy  consumption  per  $1,000  of  gross  domestic  product;  PRC  energy \nintensity  is  0.78  ton  of  oil  equivalent,  about  twice  the  average  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  developed  and \ndeveloping member countries.    \n\n \n\n \n\n\fGansu  has  a  population  of  about  26.2  million,  with  79%  classified  as  rural.  As  one  of  the        \n\n 2 \nhousehold  electrification  in  1990,  it  has  achieved  more  than  97%  electrification  by  2005  through         \n(i)  expansion  of  provincial  electricity  grids;  (ii) development  of  local  hydropower  resources;  and         \n(iii) more recently, promotion of other clean and renewable energy sources. In Gansu, with village \nelectrification  of  73%  in  1990,  more  than  97.65%  electrification  was  achieved  in  2005.  The  small \nand medium hydropower development has played a crucial role in intensifying electrification.  \n \n6. \n12  western  provinces,  its  economic  development  has  been  relatively  slow.  In  2004,  the  average \nper  capita  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  Gansu  was  CNY5,898,  about  57%  of  the  national \naverage of CNY10,533, making Gansu one of the poorest in the country. Of Gansu\u2019s 87 counties, \n43  are  national  poverty  counties  and  8  are  provincial  poverty  counties.  Gansu\u2019s  GDP  increased \nannually by 9.2% in real terms between 1996 and 2000, and about 10% between 2001 and 2005. \nCoal-fired  thermal  power  plants  are  the  main  source  of  electricity  production  in  Gansu,  while \nhydropower  contributed  only  19%  in  2005.  At  the  end  of  2005,  Gansu  had  exploited  only  about \n23% of its available hydropower potential of 17 GW.  \n \nB. \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nKey Problems and Constraints \n\n \n7. \nLike many other provinces, Gansu has experienced rapid economic growth and associated \nelectricity  shortages,  which  were  exacerbated  by  severe  drought  in  2003.  The  Gansu  electricity \nnetwork  is  part  of  the  northwest  power  grid,  and  is  a  net  power  importer  from  neighboring \nprovinces. Gansu has adequate coal reserves estimated at 9.6 billion t, it also has about 17 GW of \nhydropower  potential  of  which  only  4  GW  has  been  exploited.  The  Gansu  electricity  network  is \nexperiencing demand growth of more than 13% in the last 3 years. Consequently, there is a plan \nfor rapid generation capacity expansion, emphasizing coal-fired power plants with shorter gestation \nperiod.  Hydropower  contribution  has  sharply  declined  from  41%  in  2000  to  25%  in  2005.  Coal \nproduction  in  the  same  period  has  more  than  doubled  from  16  million  t  to  38  million  t.  Heavy \ndependence  on  coal  has  exacerbated  air  pollution  in  Gansu.  The  adverse  impacts  of \nenvironmental  pollution  have  disproportionately  affected  the  poor,  who  typically  rely  on  raw  coal \nand biomass (e.g., wood and animal dung), and suffer accordingly from indoor air pollution. A more \npronounced  shift  toward  clean  energy  would  reduce  pollution  loads,  energy  intensity,  and \ngreenhouse gas. \n \nIn  Gansu,  hydropower  potential  is  mainly  located  in  small  to  medium-sized 3  HPPs  in \n8. \nmountainous  areas.  Development  of  small-  and  medium-sized  HPPs  is  a  local  government \nresponsibility.  Their  development  is  generally  constrained  by  the  local  government\u2019s  financing \ncapacity.  Private  sector  investment  in  hydropower  development  is  limited  to  large  hydropower \nprojects  developed  by  major  power  utilities.  Gansu  provincial  government  (GPG)  has  drawn  an \nextensive  plan  for  local  hydropower  development  to  double  the  present  4  GW  capacity  to  about  \n8.5 GW capacity by 2020. In the 11th Five-Year Plan (11FYP), GPG aims to add about 2 GW of \nadditional hydropower capacity. In the absence of innovative approaches to project financing and \nprivate sector participation, the accelerated development of hydropower in Gansu will be severely \nrestricted.     \n \n9. \nSome  areas  of  Gansu,  such  as  the  Hexi  corridor,  have  been  experiencing  chronic  power \nshortages  due  to  inadequate  local  generation  capacity  and  large  distances  from  power  plants. \nZhangye  City  is  located  in  the  middle  of  the  Hexi  corridor,  about  600  kilometers  (km)  from  the \nprovincial capital, Lanzhou (Map 1). Of its 1.27 million population, more than 76% are classified as \nrural.  Of  its  rural  population,  293,000  or  almost  30%  have  incomes  less  than  the  national  rural \n\n                                                 \n3  In the PRC, hydropower plants of less than 50 megawatts are classified as small; those of 50\u2013300 MW are classified \n\nas medium-sized. \n\n\f3\npoverty  line  of  CNY1,100.  Due  to  inadequate  capacity  in  the  network,  Zhangye  experiences \nfrequent  power  interruptions.  Insufficient  power  generation  capacity  results  in  acute  peak  power \nshortages  and  poor  quality  of  power  supply  (low  voltages,  frequent  blackouts).  Planned  power \noutages  are  common  in  rural  areas.4 Zhangye\u2019s  economy  has  grown  consistently  by  more  than \n11%  per  annum  since  2002.  Rapid  economic  growth  is  fueling  demand  for  electricity,  which  has \ngrown  by  about  50%  in  the  last  3  years.  Poor  quality  and  unreliable  electricity  supply  inhibits \nindustrial and commercial activities. It constrains economic growth and employment opportunities \nin  rural  areas,  and  encourages  switching  to  polluting  fuels  for  self-power  generation  and \naccompanying environmental impacts.  \n  \n\n \n\n2. \n\nOpportunities \n\n \n10. \nThe Heihe river, originating between Qilian Mountain and Datong Mountain, is the second \nlargest inland river in the PRC and the largest in the Hexi corridor. It traverses northwards through \nQinghai  Province,  Gansu,  and  Inner  Mongolia  Autonomous  Region  over  a  length  of  more  than         \n800  km.  The  river  section  from  Huangzhang  Temple  to  Yingluo  Gorge  (95  km  along  the  river)  in \nZhangye  is an  excellent  source  of  hydropower.  In  this  95 km  section  of  the  river,  the  Heihe  river \ncascade hydropower development scheme has identified seven potential HPP sites (Map 2) with a \ntotal hydropower capacity of 645.5 megawatts (MW). All HPPs in the scheme are medium-sized, \nrun-of-river power plants. Details of the scheme are in Appendix 2.  \n \n11. \nThe scheme is an excellent source of emission free and renewable energy located close to \na  power-deficient  area,  in  a  designated  SO2  control  zone.5 The  scheme  is  part  of  the  least-cost \ngeneration  expansion  plan  in  Gansu  to  supply  reliable  and  affordable  electricity  to  the  rural \npopulation in Zhangye and Hexi corridor. The scheme is also referred to in the Heihe river basin \nplan, prepared by the Ministry of Water Resources and approved by the State Council in 2001. All \nthe  HPP  sites  in  the  scheme  are  located  in  remote  mountainous  rural  areas  requiring  little  or  no \nresettlement.  \n \nTo  alleviate  chronic  power  shortages  in  an  environment  friendly  manner  and  to  spur \n12. \neconomic development of rural areas, the Zhangye city government (ZCG) started the construction \nof the scheme in 1996. The scheme is a core rural infrastructure development initiative at the city \nlevel. Of the scheme\u2019s seven HPPs, two are already in operation, and two are under construction6 \nand  scheduled  for  completion  in  2007.  To  accelerate  the  development  of  the  scheme,  ZCG \nestablished  the  Heihe  Hydropower  Development  Company  (HHDC)  in  2000.  Four  existing  small \nHPPs  were  transferred  to  HHDC.  ZCG  and  GPG  requested  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nassistance in 2001 for the 102 MW Xiaogushan HPP in the scheme (footnote 6). Construction of \nthis HPP was completed in July 2006, 1 year ahead of schedule. ZCG and GPG are committed to \ncomplete  and  accelerate  scheme  implementation  and  sought  ADB  assistance  through  the \nproposed Investment Program to develop the next two HPPs. \n \n\n3. \n\nPolicy Framework and Capacity  \n\n \n13. \nIn  April  2002,  the  PRC  issued  the  power  sector  reform  plan,  which  aimed  to  introduce \ncompetition  for  efficiency  improvements,  reduction  of  costs,  implementation  of  a  market-based \npricing  mechanism,  optimal  resource  allocation,  nationwide  grid  connection,  and  separation  of \ngovernment and commercial functions. During the 10FYP, significant progress was made\u2014power \n                                                 \n4  Rural areas are generally connected at the far end of the distribution network and  where, in case of  supply-demand \n\nimbalance, power is switched off first. \n\n5  In designated sulfur dioxide control zones, the SO2 emissions in 2010 should be less than its 2000 level. Zhangye is \n\none of four cities in Gansu designated as SO2 control zone by the State Environment Protection Administration.  \n\n6  ADB.  2003.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for the Gansu Clean Energy Development Project. Manila (Loan 2032-PRC). The 102 MW \nXiaogushan HPP is being developed under this loan. \n\n \n\n\f 4 \nplants  were  separated  from  the  grid,  five  independent  generation  companies  and  two  grid \ncompanies  were  formed.  The  State  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  (SERC)  established  in \nOctober  2002,  aimed  at  introducing  competitive  power  markets  for  power  generation.  Regional \nwholesale power markets are being piloted in the northeast, central, eastern, and southern regions. \nProgress in the sector reform policies is expected to continue and intensify in the 11FYP. However, \nin  line  with  the  plan\u2019s  priority  on  rural  development,  the  sector  policies  have  been  aligned  to            \n(i) minimize imbalance between urban and rural electricity services; (ii) achieve uniform urban-rural \ntariffs; and (iii) improve access of electricity to unserved rural areas.     \n\n \n14. \nThe  11FYP  highlights  the  strategic  significance  of  diversifying  energy  supply  by  providing \nincreasing  renewable  energy  including  small  hydropower,  wind,  solar,  geothermal  power,  and \nbioenergies.  The  Renewable  Energy  Law  promulgated  in  2006  has  prioritized  renewables  in \nenergy  development  strategy.  The  law  and  its  accompanying  regulations  have  provided  enabling \nconditions\u2014tax and tariff incentives and, a regulatory framework\u2014to promote renewable energy in \nthe country. A medium- and long-term renewable energy development plan is being prepared and \nis  expected  to  be  issued  by  the  end  of  2006.  Renewable  energy  is  expected  to  contribute  about \n120 GW of the estimated 500 GW of the new capacity that will be added by 2020.  \n \nADB  has  been  supporting  renewable  energy  development  in  Gansu  since  2002  and  has \n15. \nmade  targeted  interventions  in  Zhangye  to  pilot  new  technologies,  approaches,  and  financing \nmechanisms.  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  support  (footnotes  6,  8,  and  9)  has  strengthened  the  institutional \ncapacity of GPG, ZCG, and the project implementation agencies (PIAs) to carry out the planning, \ndesign, and implementation of the Investment Program. Capacity building of the PIAs in areas of     \n(i)  safeguard  compliances\u2014planning,  monitoring  and  reporting;  and  (ii)  seeking  carbon  revenues \nunder a clean development mechanism (CDM) has been carried out in parallel with the preparation \nof the Investment Program. Based on the ongoing engagement of ADB in Gansu and Zhangye and \na  review  of  its  institutional  capacity  under  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA) \n(footnote 9), it was concluded that ZCG, GPG, and PIA are competent and financially capable of \nmaintaining and managing the whole scheme. \n\n \n4. \n\nStrategies of the Government and the Asian Development Bank \n\n \n16. \nThe 11FYP focuses on optimized electricity sector development with rapid development of \nrenewable  energy,  improvement  of  energy  efficiency  by  20%,  and  strengthening  of  rural \ninfrastructure  to  address  the  imbalance  between  urban  and  rural  income  levels.  Due  to  its  vast \nrenewable energy resources, Gansu is one of the key provinces identified in the 11FYP to promote \nrenewable  energy  development.7 One  of  GPG\u2019s  main  development  objectives  is  to  improve  air \nquality standards in all cities. Development of renewable energy sources and suitable hydrothermal \ngeneration mix are priorities in achieving that development goal. GPG also aims to achieve 100% \nelectrification  of  rural  areas  through  development  of  renewable  energy-based  grid  and  off-grid \nconnections.    \n \n17. \nThe  operational  strategy  of  ADB  aims  to  help  the  country  achieve  economic  growth  in  an \nefficient, equitable, and sustainable manner. ADB\u2019s energy sector strategy includes (i) developing \ncleaner energy sources, (ii) renovating and retrofitting existing facilities to improve efficiency and \nreduce  emissions,  (iii)  promoting  the  corporatization  and  commercialization  of  energy  utilities, \nand  (iv)  supporting  tariff  reforms.  This  is  complemented  by  ADB's  strategy  for  the  environment \nsector,  which  supports  the  use  of  economic  supply-side  and  other  measures  to  (i)  ensure \nsustainable  utilization  of  natural  resources  and  promotion  of  market-based  pricing,  and                      \n(ii) encourage cost recovery and better environmental information disclosure. In the water sector, \n\n                                                 \n7  Gansu  is  one  of  the  top  four  provinces  in  wind  power  potential.  Based  on  the  estimates  by  the  China  Meteorology \nResearch  Institute,  its  exploitable  wind  resources  are  estimated  at  more  than  40  gigawatts.  The  exploitable \nhydropower potential is 17 GW.   \n\n\f5\nconsistent  with  the  ADB  strategy,  the  Government  is  promoting  integrated  water  resource \nmanagement  (IWRM),  which  is  supported  through  water  legislations  and  establishment  of  river \nbasin  conservancy  commissions.  The  Heihe  River  Basin  Commission  (under  the  Yellow  River \nWater Conservancy Commission) has been set up to oversee the implementation of the Heihe river \nbasin  plan. By  providing  clean  and  renewable energy,  the  Investment  Program  is  consistent with \nand  provides  support  for  addressing  GPG\u2019s  development  objectives  and  ADB\u2019s  energy, \nenvironmental, and water sector strategies.  \n \n\n \n\n5. \n\nLessons \n\nADB\u2019s  experience  in  the  PRC\u2019s  energy  sector  has  shown  that  projects  are  generally         \n\n \n18. \nwell-planned and implemented smoothly. The overall implementation performance of ADB\u2019s energy \nportfolio  is  satisfactory.  Compliance  with  covenants  is  generally  acceptable,  although  greater \nefforts  are  required  to  implement  policy-related  covenants.  Rigorous  government  screening  of \nprojects has had a positive impact. The project completion and project performance audit reports \nfor the energy projects indicate that overall they were implemented smoothly, and assess them as \ngenerally  successful.  Recently,  some  ongoing  energy  projects  in  the  PRC  have  experienced \nimplementation delays relating to long internal approval processes, and procurement issues. Some \nprojects  have  also  resulted  in  substantial  loan  cancellations  to  cut  costs.  The  reason  is  that  cost \nestimates were made on international pricing standards with a high level of contingencies, which in \nmost cases were not utilized at all. In power projects, generally, the approved tariffs at completion \nhave been lower than the estimated tariffs at the project feasibility stage. \n \n19. \nThe  above  lessons  have  been  incorporated  in  the  design  of  the  Investment  Program. \nPreparation  of  a  detailed  feasibility  report  and  its  national  approval  before  the  submission  of \nrelevant  periodic  financing  request  (PFR),  and  extensive  discussion  on  policy-related  covenants \nwere  given  special  emphasis.  The  cost  estimates  of  Project  1  in  the  Investment  Program  were \nrigorously reviewed and adjusted. The price and physical contingencies at a reasonable rate were \nincluded  in  the  cost  estimates.  The  expected  tariff  was  assumed  at  a  reasonable  rate  with  due \nconsideration  to  the  ongoing  tariff  reform  and  prevailing  regulated  generation  tariff  in  2006. \nAppendix 3 presents a summary of external assistance and lessons learned.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \n20. \nThe  Investment  Program  will  provide  environmentally  clean  power  supply  to  support \neconomic  growth  in  the  rural  areas  of  Gansu.  Rural  consumers  in  Zhangye  will  be  supplied  with \nreliable, clean, and affordable hydropower. This additional generation capacity in conjunction with \nthe ongoing and planned Government-financed rural grid rehabilitation and modernization program \nwill (i) meet the additional rural power demand to overcome shortages, (ii) improve the reliability of \npower  supply  to  rural  areas,  (iii)  facilitate  loss  reduction,  and  (iv)  advance  policy  reforms  in  the \nareas of clean and renewable energy development in Zhangye and Gansu.  \n \nB. \n \n21. \nDevelopment of the scheme in Zhangye started in 1996. It has been an integral part of the \nleast-cost generation expansion plan of Zhangye and Gansu. The scheme is located in a remote \nmountainous  area  in  the  middle  of  the  Hexi  corridor  that  has  been  experiencing  chronic  power \nshortages.  The  main  components  of  the  ADB-supported  Investment  Program  are  hydropower \ndevelopment  on  the  scheme.  The  Investment  Program  includes  development  of  (i)  Project  1\u2014                 \n50.5  MW  Erlongshan  HPP,  and  (ii)  Project  2\u201460  MW  Dagushan  HPP  and  their  interconnection \nwith  the  110-kilovolt  (kV)  power  grid.  The  parallel  investment  in  rural  grid  rehabilitation  and \nimprovement  is  being  carried  out  by  ZCG.  The  feasibility  studies  and  engineering  design  for \n\nOutputs \n\n \n\n\f1. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nPotential Benefits from Clean Development Mechanism  \n\n 6 \nProject 1 were prepared by the provincial design institute and reviewed by a team of international \nand  national  consultants.  It  was  approved  by  GPG  in  October  2005.  The  prefeasibility  report  for \nProject  2  was  prepared  in  2006  under  an  advisory  TA.8 Capacity  building  of  the  PIAs  in  seeking \ncarbon  revenues  (detailed  in  para.  22)  from  the  projects  has  been  addressed  under  the  project \npreparatory TA.9   \n \nC. \n \n \n \nThe  Investment  Program  is  anticipated  to  be  eligible  for  generation  of  certified  emission \n22. \nreductions  (CERs) 10  under  the  CDM. 11  The  CDM  is  a  market-based  financial  instrument  that \nassists  developing  countries  to  achieve  sustainable  development  and  industrialized  countries  to \nmeet their emission reduction targets. The CDM allows industrialized countries to invest in \u201cclean\u201d \nprojects  in  developing  countries  to  acquire  CERs  that  can  be  used  to  comply  with  the  Kyoto \nProtocol.  Emission  reductions  from  the  Investment  Program  will  be  achieved  by  replacing \nequivalent coal-fired power generation. ADB has provided project financing for three CDM projects \nin the PRC, and is currently developing several more projects with CDM potential. The Xiaogushan \nHPP (footnote 6) in the scheme that was financed by ADB loan was the first hydropower project in \nthe PRC to successfully contract12 its CERs.  \n \nEach project is estimated13 to generate CERs worth about 10\u201315% of the total project cost. \n23. \nHHDC  and  Erlongshan  Hydropower  Company  (EHC)  have  expressed  interest  in  piloting  the \nproposed ADB Carbon Market Initiative (CMI) for Project 1\u2014Erlongshan HPP. Under the CMI, the \nAsia Pacific Carbon Fund can provide up-front purchase of a maximum of 50% of the Erlongshan \nProject\u2019s  CER  generation.  This  could  represent  an  estimated  up-front  payment  of  $3.5  million, \nwhich  is  7.0%  of  the  total  project  cost.  The  CMI  can  also  (i)  provide  assistance  for  sale  of  the \nresidual  CERs  under  the  Credit  Marketing  Facility,  and  (ii)  provide  grant  TA  under  the  Technical \nSupport Facility. The CMI is anticipated to be approved by the ADB Board in November 2006 and \nto be operational by early 2007. Project 1 is planned as the pilot for the CMI.  \n \n\n2. \n\nCumulative Environment Impact Assessment  \n\n \nImplementation of the scheme started in 1996. Of the scheme\u2019s total capacity, 209 MW is \n24. \nnow  operating,  214  MW  is  under  construction,  and  222.5  MW  total  is  planned.  The  scheme  is \nexpected to be completed by 2012. The scheme is included in the Heihe River Basin Development \nPlan  (para.  10).  The  design  and  operating  regime  of  each  project  in  the  scheme  are  closely \ncoordinated with the river basin commission (para. 17). An optimization study for the scheme was \ncompleted in 2004. It also assessed the cumulative impacts of the scheme on catchment hydrology \nand  downstream  users.  Considering  that  the  HPPs  only  have  daily  regulation  capacity, 14  it \nconcluded that the scheme will not significantly impact annual flow hydrograph (discharge volume \nand  timing).  It  is  also  noted  that  the  scheme  is  on  a  95  km  stretch  of  the  Heihe  river,  of  which       \n\n                                                 \n8   ADB.  2003.

Individual environmental impact assessments (EIA) were prepared \nfor  each  project,  which  ensured  environmental  flow15 in  the  reduced  flow  section.  To  ensure  that \nthe  cumulative  environmental  impacts  from  the  cascade  are  appropriately  managed,  cumulative \nimpacts were assessed during preparation of the summary EIA (SEIA) for Project 1. A number of \npotential cumulative environmental impacts were assessed and appropriate measures to mitigate \nthe impacts were identified. In accordance with international best practice and to more thoroughly \nassess  cumulative  impacts,  a  detailed  cumulative  EIA  is  being  supported  under  the  ongoing  TA \n(footnote 9). The cumulative EIA will be prepared by a provincial design institute and the report will \nbe available before the second PFR is submitted. The results of the cumulative EIA, including an \nenvironment management plan, will be enforceable on all HPPs, including Project 1 which will be \nfinanced  under  the  first  tranche.  ZCG  is  committed  to  implement  the  environment  management \nplan from the cumulative EIA. \n \n\n3. \n\nDirect Benefits to the Host County  \n\n4. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation  \n\n \n25. \nThere are 32 ethnic minority nationalities in Zhangye, who account for about 2% of the total \npopulation. Among the total minority population, the largest group is Uygur (37.1%). Three fourths \nof ethnic minorities in Zhangye are in Sunan, the only Uygur Autonomous county in the PRC. The \nprojects under the Investment Program are located in Sunan county. During construction of each \nproject, the relevant PIA is required to pay an operation tax equal to about 4.12% of the civil work\u2019s \nannual  expenditures,  about  half  of  which  goes  to  the  local  county  government.  This  resource, \nestimated as CNY4 million per annum transfer to the host county, greatly helps to improve social \nservices and economic development activities. However, the operation tax stops once construction \nis completed. To ensure continuation of support for rural development activities, ZCG will allocate \nto  the  host  county  5%  of  the  tax  it  receives  from  operation  of  each  project  under  the  Investment \nProgram.  This  will  ensure  continuous  resource  transfer,  estimated  as  CNY1  million  per  year,  to \naccelerate economic development of the host county.  \n \n \n \nThe continued economic growth and development of physical infrastructure is improving the \n26. \ninvestment  climate  for  private  sector  participation  in  Zhangye  and  Gansu.  ZCG  is  keen  on \npromoting private sector participation in infrastructure projects and has made targeted attempts16 to \nseek  private  investments  in  the  development  of  HPPs  in  the  scheme.  However,  private  sector \nresponse has been muted. The main reasons are (i) sensitivity to perceived geological risks, which \nmay  potentially  delay  project  construction;  (ii)  limited  private  capital  which  gets  attracted  to  large \npower  utilities  developing  bigger  power  plants  at  a  relatively  low  cost/kilowatt;  and  (iii)  higher \ntransaction costs due to involved multi agency approval and clearance procedures.  \n \n27. \nBased on experience in other countries and the PRC with projects of similar size, it is easier \nto  seek  private  sector  investment  in  HPPs  that  are  already  constructed  and  are  operating \nsuccessfully,  as  the  perceived  risk  are  much  less.  To  reinforce  its  commitment  to  seek  private \nsector  participation  and  to  free  up  its  limited  development  resources,  ZCG  has  agreed  to  start \ndivesting its shares in the HHDC from 2012. It is anticipated that successful implementation of the \nInvestment  Program,  and  piloting  of  CMI  will  improve  the  risk  profile  for  the  larger  (112  MW)          \nBao Pinghe, the last HPP in the scheme for private investment. ADB and ZCG will work together to \nseek an appropriate private-public partnership model for Bao Pinghe HPP.  \n \n \n\n                                                 \n15  Environmental  flow  is  a  minimum  water  flow  allocation  to  a  watercourse,  which  is  designed  to  preserve  the \n\nenvironmental ecosystems of the watercourse base. \n\n16 The HPPs in the scheme were advertised in the annual investment fair at Lanzhou for private sector investment in the \n\nlast 4 years.     \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\n5. \n\nPolicy Dialogue  \n\n \n28. \nEnvironment  improvement  resulting  from  clean  and  renewable  energy  is  the  strength  of  the \nInvestment  Program.  ADB  provided  a  TA  (footnote  8)  to  Zhangye  to  help  prioritize  renewable \nenergy  development.  The  TA  has  also  helped  establish  an  integrated  pilot  biomass  gasifier  and \npower  generation  plant  in  Qidian  township,  Shandan  County.  The  pilot  project  has  demonstrated \nan innovative approach\u2014utilizing agriculture crop residues to produce domestic fuel and generate \npower,  thereby  providing  additional  income  to  the  rural  poor.  The  11FYP  has  prioritized \ndevelopment of wind power (5 GW) and biomass power generation (5.5 GW). Gansu is one of the \nfour  provinces  that  have  been  identified  for  1  GW  of  wind  power.  Continued  support  for \ndevelopment  of  such  renewable  energy  projects  would  help  remove  barriers,  accelerate \ndeployment of new technologies, and implement more clean energy projects. \n \nD. \n \n29. \nThe total cost of the Investment Program is estimated at $110 million equivalent, inclusive \nof  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and  financial  charges  during  development  (Table  1;               \nAppendix 4 provides details).  \n \n\nProgram Investment Plan \n\nTable 1: Program Investment Plan ($ million) \n\nItem \nA.

The  financing  will  be \nprovided under a MFF, in accordance with ADB policy.17 The MFF will extend two loans to finance \nProjects 1 and 2 under the Investment Program, subject to the submission of the related PFR by \nthe Government and execution of the related loan and project agreements. The Government has \nentered  into  a  Framework  Financing  Agreement  (FFA)  with  ADB.  The  FFA  satisfies  the \nrequirements  set  forth  in  Appendix  4  of  the  Pilot  Financing  Instruments  and  Modalities                      \n(see footnote 17). The Government is required to comply with the FFA requirements. Pursuant to \nthe  FFA,  the  Government  has  submitted  to  ADB  the  first  PFR  for  Project  1  in  the  amount  of                 \n\n                                                 \n17 ADB. 2005.

The loans under the \nMFF  will  finance  civil  works,  equipment  and  goods  supply  and  erection,  and  consulting  services. \nThe minimum loan amount of a PFR will be $20 million. All provisions of the ordinary operations \nloan  regulations  applicable  to  loans  based  on  the  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)18 will \napply  to  each  loan,  subject  to  any  modifications  that  may  be  included  under  the  individual  loan \nagreement. The Government has the option to choose between eligible currencies and the interest \nrate regime for each loan. The specific terms for each loan will be based on the related PFR with \ninterest  rate  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  and  the \napplicable commitment charge, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and \nproject  agreements.  The  Government  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to \nborrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were \nits own independent decision and not made relying on any communication or advice from ADB.  \n \n31. \nFinancing for each project is inclusive of (i) 20% as equity by HHDC and ZCG; and (ii) the \nbalance  in  the  form  of  a  loan  from  a  domestic  commercial  bank.  The  Government\u2019s  equity \ncommitment  is  already  being  fulfilled  in  Project  1  with  the  ongoing  project  construction  activities \nbeing financed with equity.

The organizational structure of the Project companies will be based \non commercial principles and in accordance with the relevant PRC laws and regulations. The PIAs \nwill coordinate and monitor all project implementation activities. A project director, directly reporting \nto  the  president  of  HHDC,  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project  management,  approval  of \ncontracts,  and  payments.  A  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  established  within  each  PIA  will \nfacilitate  land  acquisition,  social  and  environmental  protection  measures,  and  ensure  that  project \ndevelopment  issues  are  adequately  addressed.  The  PIU  will  be  headed  by  a  project  manager \nresponsible for physical implementation of activities on a day-to-day basis and the preparation of \nprogress  reports.  To  strengthen  the  PIU  capabilities  in  complying  with  safeguard  issues,  and  in \nproject  monitoring,  control  and  reporting,  the  PIU  will  be  assisted  by  a  team  of  international  and \nnational  consultants.  An  organization  chart  for  implementing  the  Investment  Program  is  in \nAppendix 5.  \n \n34. \nTo  facilitate  national  approvals,  land  acquisition  and  licensing  arrangements,  and  to \naddress environmental and social safeguard issues  related to the Investment Program, ZCG has \nformed  a  lead  group  consisting  of  representatives  from  ZCG\u2014Finance  Bureau,  Development \nPlanning and Reforms Commission, Land Bureau, and Environment Protection Bureau. The lead \ngroup  is  headed  by  a  vice  mayor  of  ZCG.  The  group  will  act  as  a  focal  point  at  the  city  level  to \nassist the PIA to implement the Investment Program.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \nThe Investment Program will be implemented over a period of 7 years from 2006 to 2012. \n35. \nFor  Project  1,  preconstruction  activities,  such  as  detailed  design,  preparation  of  bidding \ndocuments,  prequalification  of  contractors,  and  tendering  and  award  of  contracts  began  in        \nmid-2006.  On-site  preconstruction  works  started  in  July  2006.  Main  civil  works  will  start  in            \nJanuary  2007  and  will  take  about  26  months.  The  anticipated  completion  date  is  February  2009. \nOverall,  Project  1  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  January  2010.  For  Project  2,  preconstruction \nactivities will start in October 2007. Civil works will start in February 2008 and will take 30 months \nto complete. Project 2 construction will be launched in February 2008, and is anticipated to be fully \ncommissioned  in  August  2012.  The  implementation  schedule  of  the  Investment  Program  is  in \nAppendix 6. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n36. \nAll  ADB-financed  procurement  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  Civil  works  and \ngoods under each project of the Investment Program will be properly packaged in accordance with \nthe  Procurement  Guidelines.  Civil  works  contracts  costing  $10  million  or  more  and  each  goods \nsupply contract costing $1 million or more financed by ADB will be procured through international \ncompetitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures  using  ADB\u2019s  standard  bidding  documents.  Civil  works \ncontracts costing less than $10 million will be procured through national competitive bidding (NCB). \nGoods  supply  contract  packages  costing  $100,000  to  $1,000,000  will  be  procured  either  using \nNCB, or in exceptional circumstances with the prior approval of ADB, limited international bidding \nprocedures.  Goods  supply  contract  packages  costing  less  than  $100,000  will  be  procured  using \nshopping  procedures.  The  contract  packaging  and  procurement  modes  for  each  contract  will  be \nexamined during ADB's processing of PFRs, and will be finalized during loan negotiations for each \nProject. The PIAs will engage tendering companies, which are well qualified to perform these tasks \nand  have  previous  experience  in  other  externally  funded  projects,  to  assist  in  carrying  out \nprocurement  activities. The  relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  will  be  included  in  all \ndocuments  and  contracts  during  bidding  for  and  implementation  of  each  project.  Based  on  the \nimplementation schedule of each project, a procurement plan will be prepared. The Procurement \nPlan for the Investment Program and Project 1 is in Appendix 7.  \n \n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nInternational  and  national  consultants  financed  under  the  Investment  Program  will  be \n37. \nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  Services  will  be \nprovided  through  a  firm  or  individuals  recruited  and  engaged  through  international  competition \nprocedures using the quality- and cost-based selection method. For Project 1, consulting services \nare estimated to be 2 person-months international and 10 person-months domestic. For Project 2, \nthe  requirement  of  consulting  services  will  be  submitted  for  ADB  review  as  part  of  the  project \nappraisal report, before to the submission of the second PFR.  \n \n\nThe  individual  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \n\nfor  Disbursement  Operations,          \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n38. \nDisbursement  Handbook 19  and  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-Based Loan Products,20 both as amended from time to time.  \n \n\nInterim  Guidelines \n\n6. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n \nIn  June  2006,  the  PIA  for  Project  1  engaged  a  tendering  company 21  to  manage  \n39. \nprocurement  for  ADB-financed  civil  works  and  goods.  The  tendering  company  has  started \npreparation  of  bid  documents,  tendering,  and  bid  evaluation.  In  view  of  the  advanced  stage  of \nproject  preparation,  the  Government  has  requested  ADB\u2019s  approval  for  advance  contracting  for \ncivil works and goods. The Government has also requested retroactive financing of up to 20% of \nthe loan amount for each individual loan.  \n \n40. \nADB management approved (i) advanced contracting for civil works and goods, and (ii) the \nrequest to seek ADB Board approval for retroactive financing for the PFRs under the MFF\u2014up to \n20% of the proceeds from individual loans under the MFF\u2014provided that expenditures are incurred \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines or Guidelines on the Use of Consultants during \nthe  12  months  before  the  signing  of  the  corresponding  individual  loan  agreement  and  loan \neffectiveness under the MFF subject to management approval on a per tranche basis. Retroactive \nfinancing  is  sought  for  eligible  expenditures  including  civil  works,  goods,  and  consulting  services \nthat  have  long  lead  time  and  are  critically  required  at  the  start  of  construction  activities,  for \nexample,  diversion  structures,  headrace  tunnel,  hydromechanical  equipment,  powerhouse  civil \nwork associated with embedded structures. The Government has been informed that approval of \nadvanced contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the projects.  \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n41. \nThe accounting, internal control, and reporting systems and procedures for PIAs will follow \nthe  accounting  principles  and  practices  prescribed  by  the  Accounting  Law  of  the  PRC,  which \nrequires  enterprises  to  prepare  financial  statements  and  generally  follow  international  accounting \nstandards. Each PIA will maintain separate accounts of its operations and submit to ADB audited \nproject  accounts  and  agency  financial  statements,  including  a  management  letter,  in  English  not \nlater than 6 months after the end of the financial years. The submitted project accounts and agency \nfinancial statements should be of acceptable quality and should be subject to an independent audit \nby the provincial or municipal audit bureau, or an external auditor acceptable to ADB. The audits \nwill be carried out in accordance with PRC\u2019s audit regulations and will meet ADB\u2019s requirements. \nFinancial  statements  with  adverse  opinions  or  disclaimers  from  auditors  are  considered \n\n                                                 \n19 ADB. 2001.

The  Government,  GPG,  and  the  PIAs \nhave  been  informed  about  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  submission  of  audited  financial  statements  and \npossible penalties for delays in submission.  \n \n42. \nThe PIAs through GPG will also submit to ADB reports and information concerning the use \nof  individual  loan  proceeds,  project  implementation,  imprest  account,  and  the  performance  of  the \nPIAs.  The  reports  will  include  (i)  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project  implementation,  including \nbrief monthly updates; and (ii) a project completion report for each project not later than 3 months \nafter  completion  of  the  relevant  project  facilities.  In  addition,  HHDC/PIAs  will  provide  ADB  with \nreports on contract management procedures (including approval of variation orders and progress \npayment certificates). \n \n43. \nDuring the Investment Program midterm review, financial projections of HHDC and each of \nthe PIAs for the following 5 years will be submitted to ADB for its review. Reports on proposed tariff \nincreases, benefit monitoring, and other relevant activities have to be submitted to ADB within the \ntime stipulated in the individual loan and project agreements. \n \n44. \nAnticorruption  Measures.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed \nwith  the  Government,  Gansu  and  the  PIA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Investment \nProgram. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin the loan regulations and the bidding documents for projects under the Investment Program. In \nparticular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Investment  Program  will  include \nprovisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of PIAs and \nall contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Investment \nProgram.  \n \n45. \nProject  Performance  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  A  project  performance  management \nsystem (PPMS) was developed by the project preparatory TA consultants and agreed to by GPG, \nZCG,  and  PIAs.  The  PPMS  includes  a  set  of  measurable  indicators  covering  project  design, \nimpacts, and risks. The macroeconomic and sector performance, institutional capacity, and reforms \nwere  taken  into  account  in  designing  the  monitoring  indicators.  It  included  environmental  and \nsocioeconomic indicators. Each PIA will establish an environmental and resettlement management \nunit  (ERMU)  to  coordinate  environmental  and  resettlement  management  issues  associated  with \nindividual  project  implementation.  The  units  will  oversee  environmental  and  resettlement \nmanagement  and  monitoring  during  construction  and  operation,  including  environmental  and \nresettlement  supervision  of  contractors.  During  implementation,  the  implementation  consultants \nand ERMU will help PIAs monitor project impacts, and will keep ADB informed of implementation \nprogress  with  the  environmental  management  plan  and  resettlement  plan  through  quarterly \nprogress reports.  \n \n46. \nProgram Review. In 2009, ADB, GPG, ZCG, and the PIAs will carry out a midterm review \nof  the  Investment  Program,  covering  all  institutional,  administrative,  organizational,  technical, \nenvironmental,  social,  poverty  reduction,  resettlement,  economic,  financial,  and  other  relevant \naspects that may have an impact on the performance of the Investment Program and its continuing \nviability.  The  midterm  review  will  thoroughly  examine  progress  in  sector  reforms,  and  evaluate \ncompliance  with  warranties  and  representations  of  the  FFA,  and  assurances  in  individual  loan \nagreements. Loan review missions will also be fielded regularly at least once every year to assess \nimplementation. The implementation progress report will be submitted to the Board at least once a \nyear.  A  supplemental  progress  report  for  Project  1  will  be  submitted  prior  to  the  management \napproval of individual loan agreements for Project 2. A loan inception mission will be fielded within \n3 months of the individual loan approval. The PIAs will prepare a project completion report for each \n\n\f13\nindividual project. In addition, ZCG and GPG will prepare an Investment Program completion report \nat the completion of Project 2.   \n \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nINVESTMENT PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n \n47. \nDuring  preparation  of  the  Investment  Program,  Project  1  was  appraised  on  technical, \neconomic,  financial,  environmental,  and  social  issues.  A  detailed  appraisal  report  has  been \nsubmitted to ADB. For Project 2, a similar appraisal report will be prepared by ZCG and GPG. The \nproject preparatory TA consultants will assist PIA and GPG in preparing this appraisal report, which \nwill be submitted to ADB for review before the second PFR is submitted.  \n \n48. \nThe  Investment  Program  is  based  on  a  least-cost  generation  expansion  plan  in  Gansu. \nSome indicative financial, economic, social, and environmental analyses of Project 2 were carried \nout  based  on  its  prefeasibility  studies  and  are  discussed  below.  The  integrated  benefits  and \nimpacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nA. \n \nThe  demand  forecast  methodology  uses  the  bottom-up  approach  or  sector  analysis \n49. \nmethod. Different end-use demands\u2014primary (agriculture), secondary (industry and construction), \ntertiary  (including  commercials  and  services),  and  residential  (urban  and  rural)\u2014were  calculated \nbased on current economic activities, policies, and impact of recent major construction projects in \nGansu. Regression method was used for projecting electricity demand. The regression model used \nelectricity  tariff,  GDPs,  population,  industry  structure,  and  energy  efficiency  as  independent \nvariables. Historical data for 1990\u20132004 was taken as input to the regression model. The estimates \nof the regression models (144 TWh) closely matched GPG forecast (129 TWh).  \n \n50. \nBecause of the large gap between demand and supply and a high growth rate of demand in \nZhangye  and  the  Hexi  corridor,  the  demand-side  responses  were  not  considered  as  full \nalternatives  in  the  analysis.  Only  supply-side  options\u2014new  generating  plants\u2014were  used  as \navailable options. The least-cost generation planning for the Gansu provincial power network up to \n2020 was completed under an advisory TA22 in 2002, and the model was updated with actual data \nfor  2002\u20132005.  The  analysis  was  also  expanded  to  include  the  remaining  three  HPPs  in  the \nscheme.  The  least-cost  analyses  confirmed  the  robustness  of  the  Investment  Program  and  the \nscheme.  The  least-cost  model  optimized  the  objective  function  of  minimum  total  system  cost\u2014\ncapital  costs,  operations  costs,  and  other  external  cost\u2014to  meet  the  power  demand  within  the \ndefined  reliability  criteria.  The  least-cost  model  (i)  confirmed  the  projects  under  the  Investment \nProgram to be the least-cost options for additional generation capacity in Gansu, (ii) confirmed the \nInvestment  Program  benefits  as  incremental  electricity  supply,  and  (iii)  identified  coal-fired  power \nplants as the alternatives. Appendix 8 gives the least-cost generation planning and analysis. \n \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  Project  1  was  calculated  to  assess  its \n51. \neconomic  viability.  Costs  considered  were  capital  costs,  and  operation  and  maintenance  costs. \nAppropriate conversion factors were used to convert financial values into economic values. Values \nare  expressed  in  2006  local  currency.  The  quantified  benefits  of  Project  1  considered  in  the \neconomic analysis included incremental energy supply through willingness-to-pay. This yielded an \nEIRR of 19.60%. The economic analysis of Project 1 (Appendix 9) does not include environment \nimprovement and social benefits. The EIRR calculation is a conservative approach, as it takes into \naccount only the main benefits but includes all project-related costs. Sensitivity and risk analyses \nsimulating adverse scenarios were carried out, and the EIRR was found to be stable and robust.  \n\n                                                 \n22 ADB.  2001.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Preparing  the  Gansu  Hydropower  Project \n\n(Financed from the Japan Special Fund). Manila (TA 3730-PRC, approved on 27 September, for $950,000). \n\n \n\n \n\n\fFinancial Analysis  \n\n 14 \n52. \nFor  Project  2,  the  detailed  EIRR  calculations  will  be  carried  out  per  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nEconomic Analysis of Investment Projects to prove its economic viability, as per the requirements \nof the selection criteria and approval procedures of the agreed-upon FFA.  \n  \nB. \n \nIndividual  projects  under  the  Investment  Program  will  be  implemented  by  separate  PIAs. \n53. \nHHDC  is  the  parent  company  for  both  PIAs.  This  separate  project  entity  approach  is  considered \nprudent  as  it  (i)  brings  transparency,  improves  accountability  and  corporate  governance;  and          \n(ii) ensures a task force approach to project development, providing management focus. The PIAs \nare  separate  legal  entities  but  have  intimate  relation  with  each  other  and  the  parent  company \n(HHDC)  in  terms  of  management  practices,  procedures,  and  management  styles.  For  Project  1, \nEHC was registered as a limited liability company under PRC law in November 2004. Being a new \ncompany,  the  financial  management  capacity  and  projections  of  the  parent  company  were  also \nreviewed in detail.  \n \n54. \nThe  review  of  HHDC  financial  management  capacity,  and  practices  indicates  that  the \ncurrent systems, policies and standards, and training programs on general accounting and finance \nmeet good national and international practices. HHDC has fully implemented the recommendations \nmade under the advisory TA (footnote 22) and a subsequent ongoing Loan (footnote 6). HHDC has \ncomplied with all the financial management covenants of the loan. The audited financial statements \nof HHDC show that the company\u2019s financial condition is robust. Its net profit has gone up steadily \nfrom  9%  of  sales  in  2002  to  30%  in  2005.  Its  financial  position  is  also  sound  with  its  capital \nstructure comprising 40:60 total liabilities to equity. The company retains all its earnings to finance \nits  ongoing  projects.  Its  accounts  receivable  level  is  equivalent  to  less  than  2  months  of  sales, \nalthough its current ratio is low as capital expenditures are presently funded through payables to \nsuppliers  (in  addition  to  internal  cash  generation  and  other  cash-raising  initiatives)  pending \nconclusion  of  the  long-term  loans  being  arranged.  The  historical  and  projected  financial \nstatements, as well as the key financial indicators are presented in Appendix 10. \n \n55. \nThe  retail  and  power  plant  output  tariffs  in  the  PRC  are  regulated.  They  are  fixed  by  the \nprice  bureau  of  the  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission  (NDRC)  and,  in  the  case  of \npower  plants,  are  announced  at  the  start  of  the  year  for  units  beginning  their  commercial \noperations during the year. In line with the ongoing sector reforms in the PRC, the retail tariffs are \nbeing  unbundled  into  generation,  and  transmission  and  distribution  tariffs.  The  fundamental \nprinciples of full cost recovery, and adequate return on equity and investment are firmly embedded \nin  the  sector  tariff  formulation  for  over  a  decade  now  and  have  been  consistently  applied,  which \nreduces the risk of approval of a nonviable tariff for the Investment Program. A regulated tariff of \nCNY0.228/kWh has been fixed by NDRC for 2006 for all new HPPs in Gansu. This regulated HPP \ngeneration tariff is lower than the regulated tariff of CNY0.248 for coal-fired power plants. The tariff \nis then indexed to the consumer price index. The Investment Program financial analysis is based \non  this  regulated  HPP  tariff.  This  is  a  conservative  approach,  as  it  takes  into  account  only  the \ngeneration tariff, but includes transmission line costs up to the nearest grid substation.  \n \n56. \nThe  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  and  financial  net  present  value  (FNPV)  were \ncalculated  for  Project  1.  The  potential  carbon  revenues  were  not  included  in  the  base  case \ncalculation. The FIRR is 5.8%, higher than the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) estimated \nat 4.2%, and the FNPV is CNY63.3 million at this WACC. Project 1 is considered financially viable. \nSensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the  FIRR  is  robust  under  various  adverse  conditions.  Inclusion  of \ncarbon revenues up to 2012 at a conservative estimate, results in significant improvement in FIRR \n(6.8%) and FNPV (CNY94.1 million). The financial analysis is in Appendix 11. \n \n\n\f \n\nEnvironmental Benefits and Impacts \n\n15\n57. \nFor  Project  2,  the  detailed  financial  analysis  will  be  carried  out  per  ADB\u2019s  Financial \nManagement  and  Analysis  of  Projects23 to  clearly  demonstrate  its  financial  viability,  which  is  a \ncritical factor in the selection criteria and approval procedures of the agreed-upon FFA.  \n \nC. \n \nThe  Investment  Program  will  have  significant  positive  environmental  benefit  from  avoided \n58. \nair  pollution,  which  will  have  local,  regional,  and  global  benefits.  System  planning  and  least-cost \nanalysis  concluded  that  the  alternative  would  be  coal-fired  thermal  power  generation.  Based  on \nthis  alternative,  the  estimated  avoided  annual  emissions  from  the  Investment  Program  are  260  t \ntotal suspended particulate; 2,100 t SO2; 1,550 t NOx. On completion, the Investment Program will \neliminate the use of 1 million t of coal per year of operation. The HPP will improve the efficiency \nand  reliability  of  the  electricity  supply  in  the  project  area.  It will  provide  an  option  to  burning  coal \nand  biomass  for  cooking,  with  associated  improvements  in  indoor  air  quality.  The  Investment \nProgram will also prevent annual emissions of an estimated 382,000 t CO2 with associated global \nbenefits of reduced greenhouse gas emissions.  \n \n59. \nIndividual projects under the Investment Program are classified as environment category A. \nThe environmental assessment and review procedure (EARP) to guide the preparation of the EIAs \nfor individual projects has been finalized. The EIA for Project 1 under the Investment Program was \nprepared and approved by the Gansu Environmental Protection Bureau in October 2004. A SEIA \nhas  been  prepared  and  placed  on  the  ADB  website  for  public  disclosure  in  April  2006.  Major \npotential environmental impacts from Project 1 include (i) soil erosion, (ii) impact on flora and fauna \nalong the 10.3 km section of Heihe River with reduced water flow, (iii) protection of the Qilianshan \nNational  Natural  Reserve  (QNNR),  and  (iv)  quality  of  surface  water.  Potential  environmental \nimpacts  have  been  identified  and  measures  developed  to  mitigate  the  impacts.  The  SEIA \nconcluded  that  the  adverse  environmental  impacts  of  Project  1  can  be  minimized  to  acceptable \nlevels  by  implementing  adequately  funded  environmental  management  activities.  Project  1  cost \nestimates include the environment protection cost.  \n \n60. \nProject  2,  which  will  also  be  environmental  category  A,  and  located  in  close  physical \nproximity with similar level of construction activities, is likely to have similar environment impacts. \nPreparation of the SEIA for Project 2 as per the EARP is part of the representation and warranty \nprovided by the Government under the FFA and will be closely monitored and assessed by ADB. \nThe  SEIA  for  Project  2  will  be  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  at  least  120  days  before  the \nsubmission of the second PFR. The cost estimates for Project 2 will be closely monitored to ensure \nthat adequate costs are included for the specified environment management system. The EARP is \nincluded as Appendix 12.  \n \n61. \nThe Heihe river consists of three sections: (i) upper mountain areas fed by precipitation and \nglaciers, (ii) middle oasis area, and (iii) lower arid areas. Environmental degradation in the middle \noasis  area  and  the  lower  arid  areas  has  been  increasing  due  to  large-scale  water  diversion  for \nirrigation  and  industrial  purposes.  The  increase  in  water  extraction  in  the  middle  oasis  area  is \ncausing  water  shortages  and  desertification  in  the  lower  arid  areas.  The  proposed  Heihe  river \ncascade includes seven HPPs located in the upper mountain areas of the river, which will regulate \nflow  on  a  daily  basis  with  only  insignificant  impact  (para.  25)  on  downstream  stakeholders.  The \nmain environmental impacts will result from diversion of natural flows from about 45 km along the \nriver  flow.  Allowance  for  environmental  flow  has  been  incorporated  into  the  individual  projects\u2019 \nenvironment  management  plan.  The  EIA  studies  have  also  indicated  that  there  are  only  two  fish \nspecies  in  the  area  of  reduced  flow,  neither  of  which  is  endangered  or  migratory.  Project  1  and \nProject  2  are  located  in  the  experimental  zone  of  the  QNNR.  The  EIA  has  identified  specific \n\n                                                 \n23 ADB. 2005.

All \nconstruction activities will be periodically reviewed by the QNNR Administration Bureau.  \n \nD. \n \n62. \nPoverty  Reduction.  The  Investment  Program  is  located  in  Xishui  township  of  Sunan \ncounty  of  Zhangye.  Xishui  township  has  a  poverty  incidence  of  about  80%.  ADB  has  earlier \nsupported  Xiaogushan  HPP  in  the  scheme  (para.12,  footnote  6).  The  projects  included  in  the \nInvestment Program are located very close (within 30 km) to each other and to Xiaogushan HPP. \nUnder the Investment Program, PIAs will implement further measures to enhance benefits to local \ncommunities,  including  (i)  hiring  and  training  local  workers  for  project  construction;  (ii)  allowing \naccess  to  project  facilities  (e.g.,  medical  emergency  facilities,  transportation,  electricity  supply);          \n(iii)  supporting  purchases  of  local  supplies  and  services  from  the  local  communities;  and                      \n(iv)  providing  a  more  reliable  electricity  supply  to  local  towns  after  project  completion.  Sunan \ncounty, an ethnic minority community, will receive operation tax revenue from PIAs, which can be \nused  to  improve  social  services  and  to  invest  in  economic  activities  to  reduce  poverty.  Following \nthe completion of each project\u2019s construction, ZCG has agreed to provide preferential tax revenue \nallocation  to  the  host  county  equal  to  5%  of  the  tax  revenue  from  power  generation.  A  summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is included in Appendix 13. \n\n \nThe  11FYP  aims  to  set  up  50  green  energy  demonstration  counties24 in  the  country  by \n63. \n2010. Sunan is the host county for the Investment Program and the scheme. The construction of \nHPPs  in  the  scheme  has  accelerated  economic  development  of  the  Sunan  county  in  an \nenvironment-friendly  manner.  It  is  a  demonstration  case  of  how  a  remote  rural  area  can  directly \nbenefit  from  the  development  of  renewable  and  clean  energy.  Considering  Sunan\u2019s  close  fit  with \nthe 11FYP key priorities, ZCG and GPG have agreed to consider qualifying it as a green energy \ndemonstration county. If approved by the Government, monetary incentives can further strengthen \nand accelerate Sunan\u2019s economic development.  \n \nGender  Impacts.  Reliable  and  affordable  electricity  will  bring  a  better  lifestyle  to  the \n64. \nhouseholds,  especially  for  the  women,  and  provide  them  access  to  appliances  such  as  \nrefrigerator,  television,  and  mobile  phone.  Access  to  the  mobile  phone  service  is  considered  a \nmajor  benefit  as  it  enables  them  to  communicate  with  their  husband  while  they  are  away  from \nhome for herding for about 6 months in a year.  \n \n65. \nLand  Acquisition.  A  total  of  2.9  hectares  of  nonirrigated  grassland  was  permanently \nacquired  under  Project  1\u2014Erlongshan  HPP,  which  affected  two  households  or  12  people  in \nLouzhuangzhi  village  of  Xishui  Township.  A  total  of  4.73  hectares  of  nonirrigated  grassland  has \nalso  been  temporarily  occupied  for  a  maximum  of  3  years  in  Project  1,  which  affected                      \n7  households  or  42  people.  The  PIA  has  prepared  a  short  resettlement  plan  (RP)  for  Project  1. \nPayment  to  the  affected  people  was  completed  in  December  2005.  The  resettlement  cost  was \nCNY76,264, paid directly to the affected people in cash. No complaint has been received from the \naffected people.  \n \n66. \nFor  Project  2,  PIA  has  prepared  a  summary  resettlement  framework  (RF).  Prefeasibility \nstudies and intensive field assessment for Project 2 suggest that land acquisition will be of similar \nmagnitude  as  in  Project  1  and  only  nonirrigated  grassland  would  be  acquired.  Preparation  of  the \nshort  RP  for  Project  2  as  per  the  RF  is  part  of  the  representation  and  warranty  provided  by  the \nGovernment  under  the  FFA  and  will  be  closely  monitored  and  assessed  by  ADB.  The  RF  is \nincluded as Appendix 14.   \n \n\n                                                 \n24 Counties  that  meet  more  than  50%  of  their  energy  need  through  clean  and  renewable  energy.

The  projects  are  located  in  an  area  within  Xishui  Tibetan  Township, \nSunan Uygur Autonomous Prefecture, Zhangye City. Over 90% of the population of Xishui Tibetan \nTownship is Tibetan in origin. Over 90% of the rural people are herdsmen. The average income for \nherders  in  the  project  area  was  CNY3,692  per  capita  in  2002.25 Tibetans  in  Xishui  believe  in \nTibetan  Buddhism,  speak  Tibetan  language,  and  are  self-identified  and  identified  officially  by  the \ngovernment. Ethnic relations in the area are harmonious. No sign of ethnic discrimination within the \ncommunity  can  be  detected.  Two  Zang/Tibetan  households  are  affected  by  permanent  land \nacquisition for Project 1. The impacts and mitigation measures are addressed in the RP. Similarly, \nProject  2  will  have  insignificant  impact  on  ethnic  minorities.  The  impact  and  mitigation  measures \nwill be addressed in the RP of Project 2. \n \n68. \nStakeholders  Consultations.  During  the  feasibility  study,  EIA,  land  acquisition  planning, \nand  TA  implementation,  consultations  were  conducted  with  more  than  4,400  representatives  of \nlocal  government  agencies,  civil  society,  and  project-affected  people \nto  discuss  project \nalternatives, environmental concerns, land acquisition issue, and economic development potential. \nThe consultation indicated that local residents overwhelmingly supported the Investment Program \nbecause they will have access to more reliable and affordable electricity and will enjoy other social \nbenefits.  The  consultation  processes  also  enabled  local  stakeholders  to  express  their  concerns \nsuch  as  public  safety  during  the  construction  period,  and  to  make  suggestions  to  improve  the \nInvestment Program design and implementation.  \n \nE. \n \n69. \nAn analysis was conducted to ensure sufficient demand for the electricity generated by the \nInvestment  Program.  The  risk  of  insufficient  demand  is  minimal.  The  electricity  generated  will \ncoincide with the summer peak demand, when electricity shortages are more acute. The regulated \ntariff of CNY0.228/kWh for new HPPs in Gansu reflects the economic supply cost and is expected \nto increase mildly due to fluctuations of the consumer price index. The expected carbon revenues \nfrom CDM transactions will further improve the PIAs\u2019 financial performance without requiring tariff \nadjustments. Strong economic performance is expected in Gansu, based on the PRC\u2019s emphasis \non economic development of the western regions. \n \n70. \nThe projects under the Investment Program are based on proven designs and conventional \ntechnologies  that  have  been  used  successfully  in  the  PRC.  No  significant  technical  risks  are \nanticipated. The hydrological risks that are common to HPPs are minimal as the hydrologic regime \nfor the Heihe river is well known, with data for the last 60 years. The accuracy and reliability of the \nrecorded  historical  hydrological  data  were  updated  and  analyzed  by  the  independent  consultant \nunder the project preparatory TA (footnote 9). The average (for energy calculations) and extreme \nhigh  flows  (for  flood  risk)  have  been  taken  into  consideration  in  the  design.  Geological  risks  are \nproject  specific  and  have  been  given  particular  attention  in  the  projects\u2019  design.  Notwithstanding \nthe  PIAs  proven  capacity  to  manage  the  implementation  of  projects,  ZCG  will  minimize  this \npotential risk further by hiring experienced international and national consultants to strengthen the \nPIUs under each PIA in the areas of construction management, and supervision and reporting of \ncompliance  with  safeguards.  Due  to  its  stand-alone  nature,  the  delay  in  construction  or  non \nimplementation  of  the  last  HPP,  which  is  not  included  in  the  Investment  Program,  will  in  no  way \naffect the viability of the projects included in the Investment Program.  \n \n71. \nThe economic analysis of Project 1 suggests no significant economic risk. Sensitivity tests \nand  risk  analysis  show  that  Project  1  will  be  economically  viable  even  under  a  combination  of \nadverse scenarios. To fully assess the potential risks, a probabilistic risk analysis was performed \nusing  the  Monte  Carlo  simulation  technique  based  on  1,000  simulations  for  both  the  EIRR  and \n\n                                                 \n25 The  average  rural  income  per  capita  in  Gansu  Province  was  CNY1,852  in  2004  and  average  GDP  per  capita  in \n\nZhangye was CNY5,973 in 2002.   \n\n \n\n\f 18 \nFIRR analyses.26 The crucial risk variables were selected because of their significant impact on the \nProject\u2019s  economic  and  financial  viability.  The  results  indicate  that  the  expected  EIRR,  based  on \nthe  weighted  average  of  all  simulated  combinations,  is  17.8%  or  about  1.8%  lower  than  the            \nbase-case  value.  The  probability  of  the  EIRR  falling  below  the  cut-off  rate  of  12%  is  7%.  The \nresults also indicate that the expected FIRR is 5.2%, about 0.8% lower than the base-case value. \nThe probability of the FIRR falling below the WACC for the Project of 4.17% is 11%. \n \n72.  \nThe 110 kV grid substation\u2014a common substation for the Investment Program and the last \nHPP\u2014to pool the evacuated power from the scheme is already under construction and is expected \nto  be  available  by  the  time  of  commissioning  of  the  first  unit  of  Project  1.  In  line  with  the  rural \ndevelopment  emphasis  in  the  11FYP,  GPG  is  committed  to  strengthen  the  rural  power \ninfrastructure.  The  rural  grid  improvement  project  and  the  uniform  urban-rural  tariff  is  a  work  in \nprogress with strong commitment from the Government. The related assumptions are likely to hold \ntrue.  \n \n73. \nUse of a new financing modality, over a 7-year period, poses a risk for both the PRC and \nADB.  This  was  recognized  in  the  design  of  the  project  preparatory  TA  itself.  TA  implementation \nwas formulated in a phased manner to assist the Government to prepare the requisite documents \nfor  both  tranches.  ADB  loan  review  missions  will  further  strengthen  support  to  the  Government \nprior  to  the  submission  of  the  second  PFR.  The  PIAs  and  GPG  are  fully  familiar  with  ADB \nrequirements  and  have  adequate  capacity  to  manage  the  procurement,  comply  with  safeguards \nand  other  representations  and  warranties  included  in  the  FFA.  The  GPG  has  the  capacity  and \nwillingness to adhere to framework facility understanding, but may need special assistance in the \nfield.  ADB  will  position  itself  to  give  it.  The  Government  has  already  submitted  all  the  required \ndocuments  for  the  first  tranche  under  the  MFF.  Appendix  15  illustrates  the  Investment  Program \nand Project 1 readiness.   \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n74. \nassurances, which are included in the legal documents: \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  assurances  included  in  the  FFA,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\nEnvironment. ZCG will cause the PIAs to ensure that (a) the projects are designed, \nconstructed  and  operated  in  accordance  with  national  and  local  environmental \nprocedures  and  guidelines  and  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002);  (b)  the \nthe \nprojects  are  designed,  constructed  and  operated \nenvironmental  management  plan  (EMP)  as  reflected  in  the  EIA,  SEIA  and  the \nEARP; (c) the EMP for Project 1 will be updated in accordance with the cumulative \nEIA and the detailed engineering design; (d) the EMP will be incorporated in bidding \ndocuments and civil works contracts; and (e) environmental performance reports will \nbe  submitted  to  ADB  twice  annually  during  the  construction  period,  including \nprogress made on the mitigation measures, monitoring data, problems encountered, \nenforcement plan and any violations.  \n\nin  accordance  with \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nLand  acquisition.

Monte Carlo simulation  works by generating a \nseries  of  random  numbers  following  the  distribution  of  probability  of  each  risk  variable.  For  each  simulation,  which \nrepresents a combination of different states of risk variables, the economic internal rate of return and financial internal \nrate of return are calculated and recorded. The results of 1,000 simulations are averaged. \n\n\f19\nefficiently in line with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and the RF; (c) the \nRPs are updated based on the detailed design, prepared in full consultation with the \naffected persons and disclosed to them prior to submitting the RPs to ADB; (d) the \ncommencement of civil work or a similar milestone will be subject to ADB\u2019s review \nand  approval  of  the  RPs  for  each  PFR  submitted;  and  (e)  an  external  consultant \nacceptable to ADB is engaged to carry out monitoring and evaluation and report to \nADB in accordance with the requirements of the RP.   \n\n \n\nAuditing  and  accounting.  GPG,  ZCG  and  each  PIA  will  ensure  that  proper \naccounts and records are maintained and audited in a timely manner to adequately \nidentify  the  use  of  loan  proceeds  in  such  manner  and  detail  as  may  be  specified \nunder each Loan Agreement and Project Agreement(s). \n\n \n(iv)  Water  right  management.  From  2008,  ZCG  will  ensure  that  a  coordinated  water \nright  management  plan  for  all  the  HPPs  in  the  cascade  in  Zhangye  will  be \nimplemented  and  regulated.  This  action  should  be  closely  coordinated  with  the \nHeihe river basin commission.  \n\nChange  in  ownership.  If  (a)  any  change  in  ownership  of  the  project  facilities,  or            \n(b)  sale,  transfer,  or  assignment  of  PIA\u2019s  interest  in  the  project  power  plant  is \nanticipated,  the  GPG,  ZCG,  and  PIAs  will  consult  ADB  at  least  6  months  before \nsuch  change,  sale,  transfer,  or  assignment.  GPG,  ZCG,  and  the  PIAs  will  ensure \nthat any proposed change in ownership of the project facilities will be carried out in a \nlegal and transparent manner. \n\nTariff. GPG and ZCG shall ensure that the formulated tariff of electricity generated \nby each Project under the Investment Program will be adequate to cover operating \ncosts, maintenance and depreciation, financing cost and allow an acceptable return \non the net fixed asset. \n\nPolicy change.

GPG  and  ZCG  will  ensure  that  from  the  start  of \ncommercial  operation  of  each  Project,  the  relevant  PIA  will  maintain  (a)  a  debt \nservice  coverage  ratio  of  1.2;  (b)  a  debt-equity  ratio  of  80:20;  (c)  a  return  of  fixed \nasset of 6%; and (d) accounts receivables not exceeding 2 months\u2019 sales. Each PIA \nwill  improve  the  debt  service  coverage  ratio  to  1.3  and  debt-equity  ratio  to  75:25 \nwithin 5 years of commercial operation.   \n\nFinancial governance. ZCG and PIAs will ensure that internal controls of the PIAs \nwill be strengthened and an independent and autonomous internal audit department \nwill be set up in each PIA. The PIAs will adopt acceptable computerized accounting \nand  management  information  systems,  and  prepare  financial  statements  and \nreports in accordance with national accounting standards.  \n\nGender.  GPG,  ZCG  and  PIAs  shall  follow  the  principles  of  the  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nGender  and  Development  during  each  Project  implementation,  including  taking  all \nnecessary  actions  to  encourage  women  living  in  the  project  area  to  participate  in \nplanning and implementing project activities. GPG, ZCG and the PIAs shall monitor \nthe  project  effects  on  women  during  the  implementation  of  the  projects,  through, \nwhere relevant, gender-disaggregated data collected pursuant to the monitoring and \nevaluation system referred to in the PPMS. \n\n \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\n \n(ix) \n\n \n(x) \n\n\f 20 \n\n(xi) \n\nSexually  transmitted  diseases.

Traversing more than 800 kilometers (km), the river \npasses  through  Qinghai  Province,  Gansu  Province,  and  Inner  Mongolia  Autonomous  Region. \nThe  section  from  the  Huagzhang  Temple  to  the  Yingluo  Gorge  in  Zhangye,  a  95  km  stretch \nalong  the  river,  is  an  excellent  source  for  hydropower  generation.  In  this  area,  the  average \ngradient  in  the  riverbed  is  about  10%,  corresponding  to  about  1,000  meters  head  difference. \nDue  to  its  strategic  location  in  the  Hexi  corridor,1  an  area  that  has  been  experiencing  chronic \nelectricity shortages due to limited generation capacity and large distances from power plants, \nthe Heihe river hydropower potential has been studied in great detail in the last 50 years.2 The \nHeihe  River  Hydropower  Development  Plan  prepared  in  those  early  stages  had  identified \ncascade  hydropower  development  as  the  optimum  approach,  and  identified  seven  potential \ncascade  hydropower  plant  (HPP)  sites  in  the  river  in  Zhangye  City,  with  a  total  hydropower \npotential of about 645.5 megawatts (MW).   \n \n2. \nDuring  the  9th  Five-Year  Plan  (9FYP)  in  1995,  the  development  of  the  Heihe  river \ncascade  hydropower  development  scheme  was  identified  as  priority  by  the  Zhangye  city \ngovernment  (ZCG)  to  meet  electricity  shortages.  In  1996,  construction  of  the  first  HPP  in  the \nscheme began. In 2003, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a project loan to finance \nthe 102 MW Xiaogushan HPP, the third project in the scheme. In 2004, an optimization study of \nthe  scheme  was  completed  that  confirmed  the  total  hydropower  potential  of  645.5  MW  at  an \nestimated  cost  of  $575  million.

It  is  a  narrow  but  long  passage  stretched  \nfrom east to west of about 900 km from the steep Wushaolin hillside to Xinxinxia gorge at the border of Gansu and \nXinjiang. As part of the Silk Road in ancient China, it is the most important passage to Xinjiang and Central Asia. It \nis  sandwiched  in  between  snow-covered  Qilian  Mountains  to  the  south  and  north  mountain  and  deserts  to  the \nnorth. \n\n2  Northwest  Hydropower  Design  Institute  and  Gansu  Provincial  Hydropower  Design  Institute  identified  cascade \n\nhydropower development on the Heihe river in the 1950s.  \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nDevelopment Impacts of the Scheme  \n\nRelevance of the Scheme to the Sector  \n\nThe  Investment  Program  will  finance  the  next  two  HPPs  in  the  scheme:  (i)  Project  1, \n3. \n50.5  MW  Erlongshan,  and  (ii)  Project  2,  60  MW  Dagushan.  ZCG  and  Gansu  provincial \ngovernment (GPG) are committed to complete development of all seven HPPs in the scheme by \n2013.   \n \nB.  \n \n4. \nEnhanced  Environment  Sustainability.  The  scheme  involves  construction  of  seven \nmedium-sized  run-of-river  HPPs  that  have  minimal  environmental  impacts  but  large  positive \nenvironment  benefits  in  terms  of  avoided  air  pollution  from  alternative  coal-fired  power  plants. \nThe avoided annual emissions include 1,560 tons (t) total suspended particulate, 13,200 t sulfur \ndioxide (SO2), 10,200 t nitrogen oxide (NOx). The scheme will also avoid annual emissions of an \nestimated  2,300,000  t  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  with  associated  global  benefits  for  reduced \ngreenhouse gas emissions.  \n \n5. \nSupport  for  Sustainable  Economic  Growth.  The  scheme  has  started  improving  the \nefficiency  and  reliability  of  the  electricity  supply  in  the  project  area,  thus  addressing  a  major \nconstraint to economic growth in Zhangye. The scheme has provided an alternative to burning \ncoal and biomass for cooking, with associated improvements in indoor air quality. The scheme \nhas provided reliable electricity, a vital input to the local agriculture-based industries in Zhangye.  \n \nC. \n \n6. \nHydropower  Development  in  Gansu. Nine  river  systems  in  the  Yellow,  Yangtze,  and \ninland river drainage basins with an annual discharge of 61.4 billion cubic meters are the main \nwater  resources  in  Gansu  province.  The  combined  hydropower  potential  is  estimated  at            \n17 gigawatts (GW). The province has constructed 32 hydropower stations with a total installed \ngenerating  capacity  of  about  4  GW  and  an  annual  output  of  12  terrawatt-hours.  The  share  of \nHPP  has  declined  sharply  from  41%  in  2000  to  about  19%  in  2005  because  of  the  recent \naddition of coal-based generation capacity. In Gansu, hydropower potential is mainly in small to \nmedium-sized HPPs in mountainous areas.3 Development of small- and medium-sized HPPs is \na  local  government  responsibility.  Their  development  is  generally  constrained  by  the  local \ngovernment\u2019s  financing  capacity.  Private  sector  investment  in  hydropower  development  is \nlimited  to  large  hydropower  projects  developed  by  major  power  utilities.  GPG  has  drawn  an \nextensive  plan  for  local  hydropower  development  to  double  the  present  capacity  of  4  GW  to \nabout 8.5 GW by 2020. In the 11FYP, GPG aims to add about 2 GW of hydropower capacity. In \nthe absence of innovative approaches to project financing and private sector participation, the \naccelerated development of hydropower in Gansu will be severely restricted.  \n \n7.  \nSector Priorities. The 11FYP focuses on optimized electricity sector development with \nemphasis on accelerated development of renewable energy, improvement of energy efficiency \nby 20%, and strengthening of rural infrastructure to address the imbalance between urban and \nrural  income  levels.  Gansu  is  one  of  the  key  provinces  identified  in  the  11FYP  to  promote \nrenewable  energy  development.  One  of  GPG\u2019s  main  development  objectives  is  to  improve  air \nquality  standards  in  all  cities.  Development  of  renewable  energy  sources  and  suitable \nhydrothermal generation mix are priorities in achieving that development goal. GPG also aims to \nachieve  100%  electrification  of  rural  areas  through  development  of  renewable  energy-based \ngrid and off-grid connections.    \n\n                                                 \n3  In  the  PRC,  hydropower  plants  less  than  50  megawatts  are  classified  as  small;  50\u2013300  MW  are  classified  as \n\nmedium-sized. \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n25\n\nPoverty Reduction Impact \n\nThe  scheme  is  an  integral  part  of  the  electricity  system  planning  and  least-cost \n8. \ngeneration capacity expansion plan in Gansu. The scheme is consistent with the Government\u2019s \nsector  priority  on  (i)  development  of  clean  and  renewable  energy,  (ii)  strengthened  rural \ninfrastructure to minimize urban and rural electricity service gaps, and (iii) energy efficiency. The \nscheme  will  provide  electricity  closer  to  a  large  group  of  consumers  in  the  Hexi  corridor, \nobviating  the  need  to  transmit  electricity  over  a  long  distance,  thus  improving  efficiency.  The \nscheme  will  complement  rural  electricity  grid  rehabilitation,  a  key  rural \ninfrastructure \ndevelopment need. The HPPs in the scheme are eligible for carbon revenues under the clean \ndevelopment  mechanism  (CDM).  So  far,  the  only  project  in  the  scheme  that  has  successfully \ncontracted  carbon  revenues  is  the  ADB-financed  102  MW  Xiaogushan  hydropower  project. \nUnder the Investment Program, the marketing of carbon revenues from potential clean energy \nproject  has  been  institutionalized.  Project  1  is  being  considered  as  the  pilot  for  the  Carbon \nMarket Initiative (CMI).  \n \nD.  \n \nThe  Investment  Program  is  located  in  Xishui  township  of  Sunan  county  of  Zhangye. \n9. \nXishui has a poverty incidence of about 80%. Before the construction of the scheme, the local \ncommunity  had  unreliable  landline  telephone,  did  not  have  access  to  cellular  phone  services, \nand  had  only  a  dirt  road  leading  to  the  nearest  township. Due  to  poor  road  condition,  the  bus \nservice was infrequent (only once a week); it used to take more than 8 hours to reach Zhangye. \nThe construction of HPPs have resulted in the improvement of 78 km of rural roads and a daily \nbus service to Zhangye, the travel time has been reduced from 8 to 4 hours providing improved \naccess  to  markets,  hospitals,  etc.  In  addition,  project  implementing  agencies  (PIAs)  will \nimplement  further  measures  to  enhance  benefits  to  local  communities,  including  (i)  hiring  and \ntraining  local  workers  for  project  construction;  (ii)  allowing  access  to  project  facilities              \n(e.g., medical emergency facilities, transportation, electricity supply); (iii) supporting purchases \nof  local  supplies  and  services  from  the  local  communities;  and  (iv)  provision  of  more  reliable \nelectricity  supply  to  local  towns  after  project  completion.  Sunan  county,  an  ethnic  minority \ncommunity,  will  also  receive  operation  tax  revenue  from  PIAs,  which  can  be  used  to  improve \nsocial services and to invest in economic activities to reduce poverty. Following the completion \nof each project\u2019s construction, ZCG has agreed to provide preferential tax revenue allocation to \nthe host county equal to 5% of the tax revenue from power generation.  \n \nE. \n \nIn  April  2002,  the  PRC  power  sector  reform  plan  was  issued.  It  aimed  to  introduce \n10. \ncompetition for efficiency improvements, reduction of costs, implementation of a market-based \npricing  mechanism,  optimal  resource  allocation,  nationwide  grid  connection,  separation  of \ngovernment  and  commercial  functions.  During  the  10FYP,  significant  progress  was  made\u2014\npower  plants  were  separated  from  grid,  five  independent  generation  companies  and  two  grid \ncompanies were formed, the State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC) was established \nin October 2002, aiming to introduce competitive power markets for power generation. Regional \nwholesale  power  markets  are  being  piloted  in  the  northeast,  central,  eastern,  and  southern \nregions. Progress made in the sector reform policies is expected to continue and intensify in the \n11FYP. However, in line with the plan\u2019s priority on rural development, the sector policies have \nbeen aligned to (i) minimize imbalance between urban and rural electricity services (ii) achieve \nuniform urban-rural tariffs and (iii) improve access to electricity in unserved rural areas.     \n\nPolicy Framework and Capacity  \n\n \n11. \nThe  11FYP  highlights  the  strategic  significance  of  diversifying  energy  supply  by \nproviding  increasing  renewable  energy  including  small  hydropower,  wind,  solar,  geothermal \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\npower,  and  bioenergies.  The  Renewable  Energy  Law  promulgated  in  2006  has  prioritized \nrenewables  in  the  energy  development  strategy.  The  law  and  its  accompanying  regulations \nhave  provided  enabling  conditions\u2014tax  and  tariff  incentives  and  a  regulatory  framework\u2014        \nto  promote  renewable  energy  in  the  country.  A  medium-  and  long-term  renewable  energy \ndevelopment  plan  is  under  preparation  and  is  expected  to  be  issued  by  the  end  of  2006.  It  is \nexpected that the renewable energy will contribute about 120 GW of the estimated 700 GW of \nthe new capacity that will be added by 2020.  \n \nADB has been supporting renewable energy development in Gansu since 2002 and has \n12. \nmade  targeted  interventions  in  Zhangye  to  pilot  new  technologies,  approaches,  and  financing \nmechanisms. ADB\u2019s ongoing support (Table A2.2) has strengthened the institutional capacity of \nGPG, ZCG, and PIAs to plan, design, and implement the Investment Program. Capacity building \nof  the  PIAs  in  areas  of  (i)  safeguard  compliances\u2014planning,  monitoring  and  reporting;  and            \n(ii) seeking carbon revenues under CDM has been carried out in parallel with the preparation of \nthe  Investment  Program.  Based  on  the  ongoing  engagement  of  ADB  in  Gansu  and  Zhangye \nand  a  review  of  its  institutional  capacity  under  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance,4  it \ncan  be  concluded  that  ZCG,  GPG,  and  PIA  are  competent  and  financially  capable  of \nmaintaining and managing the whole scheme.  \n\n \nTable A2.2: ADB Support to Gansu Province in Development of Clean  \nand Renewable Energy   \n\nDetails of Assistance \n\nTA 3730-PRC: Preparing Gansu Hydropower Project ($950,000)   \nTA 3840-PRC: Clean Development Mechanism in the Energy Sector\u2014Gansu was one of \nthe four targeted provinces ($775,000)  \nProject Loan 2032-PRC: Gansu Clean Energy Project ($35 million)  \nTA 4309-PRC: Renewable Energy for Poverty Reduction ($600,000) \nTA 4783-PRC: Preparing Gansu Heihe Hydropower Development Project ($500,000) \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nYear  \n2001 \n2002  \n\n2003  \n2003  \n2006 \n\n \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB.  2006.

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has \napproved $3.5 billion for the PRC energy sector to finance 28 projects in the public sector, and  \n2  private  sector  power  projects.  Of  the  projects,  thermal  power  projects  account  for  41%  in \nterms  of  loan  amount,  with  hydropower  projects  accounting  for  about  36%,  followed  by \ntransmission  and  distribution  (about  17%),  and  renewable  energy  (about  6%).  ADB  has \nextended  five  loans  amounting  to  $665  million  for  hydropower  and  pumped  storage  power \nprojects  in  the  PRC.1  Of  these  three,  two  have  been  completed,  both  with  the  rating  of \n\"Successful.\u201d \n \n2. \nADB  has  also  provided  100  technical  assistance  (TA)  projects  for  the  energy  sector \ncosting about $50 million to help prepare projects, provide policy advice, and build institutional \ncapabilities of power utilities that are the executing agencies of ADB loans. ADB provided TAs \nto  help  restructure  the  power  sector,  formulate  power  pricing  strategy,  improve  the  power \nplanning process, and establish the State Electricity Regulatory Commission. TAs provided by \nADB  also  covered  clean  production,2  energy  conservation,3  and  environmental  management.4 \nADB  is  providing  TA  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  on  energy  efficiency.5  The  TA\u2019s \nobjective  is  to  help  the  Government  identify  various  options  for  developing  a  policy  and \nregulatory framework to promote and implement efficiency power plant projects. 6  \n \n3. \nThe World Bank is an important source of external funding for the power sector. Since \nthe  early  1990s,  it  has  provided  over  $6.2  billion  to  finance  25  projects,  most  of  which  are            \nlarge-scale thermal and hydropower projects, and power transmission and distribution projects. \nIn  recent  years,  the  World  Bank  has  provided  loans  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  urban \nenvironmental  improvement  and  development  of  renewable  energy.  The  World  Bank  has  also \nprovided  TAs  on  power  sector  restructuring  and  heating  sector  reforms.  The  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme is also providing assistance to help the Government evaluate various \noptions for power sector restructuring and for promoting energy conservation.  \n                                                 \n1   ADB.  1993.

It has provided concessional \nloans  totaling  CNY438  billion  ($3.6  billion  at  the  current  exchange  rate)  for  14  power  sector \nprojects  through  its  official  development  assistance  window.  JBIC  has  also  provided  special \ncredits  to  major  cities  to  improve  their  environment  by  installing  emission  control  devices  and \nequipment  in  power  plants  and  factories,  and  by  building  water  treatment  facilities.  JBIC  is \nconsidering shifting its traditional focus of assistance in the power sector from hydropower and \nthermal  power  generation  to  energy  conservation  and  renewable  energy,  particularly  in  the \nwestern  region.  German  development  cooperation,  through  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau \n(KfW),  has  provided  approximately  $400  million  in  mixed  credits,  mostly  for  power  plants  and \nturbine  modernization  projects.  KfW  also  supported  the  Government  in  energy  efficiency  and \nrenewable energy development. Other bilateral sources providing export credits or mixed credits \nin the energy sector include Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, \nand United States. \n \n5. \nADB  has  established  a  working  relationship  with  the  World  Bank  in  addressing  policy \nissues and coordinating lending and TA operations, and exchanges views with bilateral sources \nand the private sector. Both ADB and the World Bank emphasize the importance of improving \nthe management of power utilities, tariff reform, energy efficiency improvement,  environmental \nprotection,  and  a  greater  role  for  the  private  sector.  During  the  processing  of  the  Investment \nProgram,  discussions  were  held  with  the  World  Bank,  JBIC,  and  KfW  to  ensure  that  their \nrespective activities are complementary and to maintain consistency in policy advice.  \n \nB. \n \n6. \nADB\u2019s overall experience with energy and environment sector projects in the PRC has \nbeen  positive.  Projects  are  generally  well-designed  and  smoothly  implemented,  although  front \nend delays have occurred in some projects. Success is attributed to extensive preparation prior \nto ADB intervention, high sense of local ownership, effective leadership in project management \noffices, and timely policy and enterprise reforms. Delays have also occurred for some projects in \nloan  signing  and \nin  procurement,  construction,  and \ncommissioning, but in most cases have not led to unsatisfactory performance. The Government \nhas  implemented  reforms  on  investment  regulations,  which  simplify  approval  procedures  and \ndelegate  some  approving  functions  to  authorities  at  the  local  governments.  ADB  has  been \nworking  closely  with  the  Government  to  harmonize  the  two  approval  procedures  to  minimize \nproject start-up and implementation delays.   \n \n7. \nPower utilities, particularly small and medium ones, have been found to be weak in the \narea  of  commercial  and  financial  management.  Often,  there  is  a  need  for  institutional \nstrengthening  in  the  areas  of  organizational  structure,  delegation  of  authority,  management, \ninformation  and  control  systems,  accounting  and  financial  management,  and  human  resource \nmanagement.  Project  completion  and  project  performance  audit  reports  for  ADB-financed \nprojects in  the  PRC  highlight  (i)  the  need  to improve  financial  reporting;  (ii)  the  need  for  more \nattention  to  environmental  matters;  (iii)  the  advisability  of  using  larger  boiler-turbine  units;  and \n(iv) the necessity for capacity building, not only for project preparation, but also for staff training  \nin  operational  and  managerial  aspects  of  power  utility  operations.  Recently,  some  ongoing \npower  projects  in  the  PRC  experienced  implementation  delays  in  meeting  procurement  and \nconstruction  deadlines  mainly  because  of  the  ongoing  restructuring  of  the  power  sector  and \n\nloan  effectiveness,  as  well  as \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n29\n\nconsequent change in the ownership of the projects. Nevertheless, the overall implementation \nperformance of ADB\u2019s energy portfolio in the PRC is satisfactory.7 \n \n8. \nOngoing reforms on power tariffs are encouraging increased use of renewable energies, \nincluding  wind,  solar,  small  and  medium  hydropower,  and  bioenergies.  The  retail  and  power \nplant output tariffs in the PRC are regulated. They are fixed by the price bureau of the National \nDevelopment  and  Reform  Commission  (NDRC)  and,  in  the  case  of  power  plants,  are \nannounced  at  the  beginning  of  the  year  for  units  commencing  their  commercial  operations \nduring the year. In the ongoing sector reforms in the PRC, the retail tariffs are being unbundled \ninto generation, and transmission and distribution tariffs. The fundamental principles of full cost \nrecovery,  and  adequate  return  on  equity  and  interest  are  firmly  embedded  in  the  sector  tariff \nformulation for over a decade now and have been consistently applied. The project completion \nreport on the two completed hydropower projects8 revealed that the tariff approved were lower \nthan the appraisal estimate. However, the approved tariffs were still consistent with the average \nincremental  economic  cost  (AIEC)  of  hydropower  plants.  It  suggests  that  a  careful  approach \nbased  on  more  rigorous  analysis  of  tariff-setting  guidelines  and  ongoing  reforms  should  be \nfactored in the estimated tariffs, so that the project financial viability can be ascertained under \nthe most likely scenario.  \n \n9. \nSome hydropower projects (footnote 1) have also had substantial loan cancellations due \nto  cost  savings.  The  reason  was  that  cost  estimates  were  made  on  international  pricing \nstandards  with  a  high  level  of  contingencies,  which  in  most  cases  were  not  utilized.  Some  \ncommitment  charges  were  avoidable.  There  should  be  a  more  careful  examination  of  all  cost \ncomponents  and  a  review  of  historical  costs  for  similar  projects  in  the  PRC,  together  with  a \nproactive approach in identifying cost savings and prompt loan cancellations.  \n \n10. \nThese  lessons  were  taken  into  account  in  the  Investment  Program  design  and \npreparation.  During  the  preparation,  lessons  of  experience  were  addressed  by  (i)  thoroughly \nreviewing  project  readiness  on  key  factors  that  may  potentially  delay  the  start-up;  (ii) careful \nassessment  of  institutional  capacity  and  strengthening  measures  to  improve  the  level  of \ncorporate  governance;  (iii)  conservative  estimates  of  the  expected  tariff  consistent  with  the \nexisting policies and reform agenda; (iv) undertaking rigorous review and sensitivity analysis of \ncash  flows,  and  financial  and  economic  analyses;  and  (v)  setting  up  of  project  implementing \nunits  with  autonomy  in  operations  and  for  procurement  decisions.  The  implementation  of  two \nongoing hydropower projects9 in the PRC is rated as \u201chighly satisfactory\u201d suggesting that there \nare no new issues.  \n\n                                                 \n7  Of the seven loans currently under administration, one is rated highly satisfactory, and the remaining six are rated \n\nsatisfactory. \n\n8 ADB. 2004.

It connects to Qinghai in the west, Shanxi in \nthe east, and Ningxia in the north, with transmission lines covering an area of 390,000 square \nkilometers and serving about 25 million people. The portion of the Gansu network west of the \nYellow River is known as the Hexi grid. The Zhangye power network is part of the Hexi network. \nThe  proposed  hydropower  plants  (HPP)  in  the  Heihe  river  cascade  hydropower  development \nscheme\u2014(i)  50.5  megawatts  (MW)  Erlongshan  HPP,  (ii)  60  MW  Dagushan  HPP,  and               \n(iii)  112  MW  Bao  Pinghe  HPP\u2014will  be  connected  to  the  Zhangye,  Hexi,  and  Gansu  network \nthrough a 110 kilovolt transmission grid substation in Zhangye. The assumption is that the total \noutput of these HPPs will be used to meet demand within Gansu province and all (or a major \npart) of its generation will be consumed within the Zhangye and Hexi network.  \n \nA least-cost generation planning for the Gansu provincial power network was completed \n2. \nunder an advisory technical assistance in 2002.1 The least-cost analysis model developed under \nthat technical assistance was updated with the actual data for the year 2003\u20132005. The analysis \nwas also expanded to include the remaining three HPPs in the scheme.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nElectricity  demand  forecasts  play  a  key  role  in  generation  planning  since  the  level  of \nfuture demand is one of the critical variables in selecting the least-cost power plant. A review of \nthe  actual  electricity  demand  during  the  10th  Five-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005)  in  Gansu  revealed \nthat  the  electricity  demand  far  exceeded  the  conservative  assumptions  of  5.7%  per  annum \naverage  growth  estimated  earlier.  The  recently  observed  elasticity  of  electricity  consumption \nwith  respect  to  income  and  the  recent  economic  performance  of  Gansu  suggests  that  the \nelasticity  (percent  increase  in  electricity  consumption  to  per  cent  increase  in  gross  domestic \nproduct [GDP]) has been about 1.2 to 1.3.  \n \nThe  demand  function  also  considered  the  11  Five-Year  Plan  (11FYP)  priority  of  the \n4.  \nGovernment  to  reduce  energy  intensity2  by  20%  and  a  sustained  annual  average  economic \ngrowth  of  about  7%.  A  regression  analysis  was  performed  to  assess  compounded  annual \ngrowth rate (CAGR) based on the elasticity of electrical demand at about 1.1 and GDP growth \nof 7 %. The time series data for 1995\u20132004 was used in estimating long-term growth rate. The \nresulting demand projections are in Table A8.1.  \n \n5.  \nZhangye electricity demand growth (average about 13% since 2001) has also outpaced \nits  economic  growth  (average  about  10%).  The  11FYP  priority  on  rural  development  and \nZhangye\u2019s  recent  demand  growth  were  considered  in  estimating  the  demand  projection  for \nZhangye (Table A8.2).      \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001.

The  summer  peak  imposes  maximum  demand  on  the  existing  network.  The \nsummer demand is made up of a larger peak mainly due to agricultural (pumped irrigation) load. \nThe  projects  in  the  Heihe  river  cascade  scheme\u2014Erlongshan,  Dagushan,  and  Bao  Pinghe\u2014 \nwill  provide  maximum  generation  during  summer  months  when  river  flows  are  higher,  which \nmake  them  particularly  suited  to  alleviate  the  peak  electricity  demand  gaps  in  the  Zhangye \nnetwork. \n \nC. \n \n8. \nBecause  of  the  large  gap  between  demand  and  supply  in  Zhangye,  demand-side \nresponses  were  not  considered  as  full  alternatives  in  the  analysis.  Only  supply-side  options\u2014\nnew  generation  plants\u2014were  used  as  viable  options.  Considering  the  consistent  large          \ndemand-supply gap, it was concluded that the HPPs in the scheme will provide the incremental \nelectricity supply to the network.  \n \n9. \nthree  power  generation \nfor \ntechnologies\u2014hydropower,  coal-fired,  and  natural-gas-fired\u2014have  been  considered \nchoosing  the  least-cost  option.  Two  fossil-fuel  generation  technologies  were  considered  as \ntechnology  alternatives:  300  MW  coal-fired  thermal,  and  combined-cycle  gas  turbine  (CCGT, \n300 MW). Technology alternatives, including Xiaogushan Hydropower Project, were analyzed in \ndetail.  Capital  and  annual  operation  and  maintenance  costs  for  each  technology  alternative \nwere examined. The capital cost used in the analysis excluded physical contingency and taxes.  \n \n10. \nFor  direct  comparability,  the  output  of  each  alternative  was  normalized.  Adjustments \nwere  also  made  for  load  factor  differences.  It  was  assumed  that  aside  from  the  benefit  for \ncapacity  substitution  for  HPPs,  the  alternatives  would  generate  more  energy  (load  factor  is \naround  68%)  to  substitute  generation  from  coal-fired  plants.  The  latter  could  not  be  used  to \nmeet incremental demand, but would save fuel consumption in existing plants, bringing energy \nsaving  benefits.  The  capital  costs  used  in  the  analysis  excludes  transfer  payments  such  as \ntaxes  as  well  as  provisions  for  physical  contingency.  Unlike  the  hydropower  alternative,  other \nproject alternatives involve use of depletable resources such as coal and natural gas. Valuation \n\nProject  Alternatives.  Four  project  alternatives  using \n\n \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nof  depletable  resources  requires  the  inclusion  of  an  explicit  opportunity  cost  component  for \ndepletion, in addition to the marginal extraction cost or the normal domestic market price. This \nopportunity  cost  is  referred  to  as  the  depletion  premium.  The  depletion  premium  for  coal  was \ncalculated to be CNY194 per ton (t), in addition to the extraction cost of CNY248/t. For natural \ngas, the depletion premium was estimated to be CNY104 per t of coal equivalent.  \n \n11. \nIdentifying  the  Least-Cost  Option.  The  least-cost  option  was  selected  by  comparing \nthe  cost  of  the  selected  project  alternatives,  which  are  the  mutually  exclusive  and  technically \nfeasible  options  to  supply  the  projected  demand.  Average  incremental  economic  cost  (AIEC)3 \nfor each option was calculated to determine the option with the lowest AIEC. The HPPs in the \nscheme were the least-cost option with an estimated AIEC of CNY0.22 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) \ncompared  with  CNY0.29/kWh  for  a  coal-fired  power  plant,  and  CNY0.49/kWh  for  a  combined-\ncycle gas-fired power plant.  \n \n12. \nThe  equalizing  discount  rate\u2014the  discount  at  which  the  present  value  of  two  life-cycle \ncost  streams  are  equal,  thus  indicating  a  discount  rate  at  which  preference  changes\u2014shows \nthat  hydropower  remains  a  better  alternative  up  to  the  discount  rate  of  16%,  after  which  the \ncoal-fired  power  plant  will  be  preferable.  Hydropower,  with  its  high  capital  costs  and  very  low \noperational cost, is the preferred option when lower discount rates are used.  \n \nD. \n \n13. \nsupply  the  incremental  demand;  (ii)  the  HPPs  in  the  scheme  are  the  least-cost  option;  and                     \n(iii) a coal-fired power plant is the alternative to the HPPs in the scheme. \n\nThe major conclusions of the least-cost analysis follow: (i) the HPPs in the scheme will \n\nConclusions \n\n                                                 \n3  Ratio  of  present  value  of  incremental  investment  and  operation  costs,  with-  and  without-project  alternatives,  and \n\npresent value of incremental output, with- and without-project alternatives. \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n39\n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \n\nA. \n\nEstimation of Benefits \n\nEstimation of Costs \n \nThe economic analysis was carried out for Project 1, Erlongshan Hydropower Plant with \n1. \ncapacity  of  50.5  megawatts  (MW).  Economic  costs  are  at  2006  constant  prices  and  are \nexpressed  in  domestic  currency.  Tradable  commodities  were  valued  at  border  prices  at  the \nprevailing exchange rate. Nontradable commodities were valued through shadow prices using a \nstandard conversion factor of 0.987, and specific conversion factors: 1.0 for equipment, 1.67 for \nsteel,  0.76  for  cement,  0.82  for  timber,  2.0  for  skilled  labor,  and  0.67  for  unskilled  labor.  The \ncapital  costs  were  also  adjusted  to  eliminate  price  inflation,  interest  during  construction,  and \ntaxes. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  main  economic  benefit  of  Project  1  is  power  generation  to  meet  the  electricity \ndemand  of  end  users.  Analysis  used  conservative  estimates  of  the  actual  benefits\u2014lower \nforecast  for  generation,  plant  use  of  1%,  and  transmission  and  distribution  losses  of  9.5%, \nformed  the  basis  for  the  incremental  net  energy  supply  from  Project  1  to  the  end  users.        \nProject  1  with  its  50.5  MW  installed  capacity  is  assumed  to  provide  about  155  gigawatt-hours \nper  year  to  end  users,  which  represents  about  35%  load  factor  or  an  average  load  of  about   \n17.7 MW.  Incremental benefits were quantified based on end users\u2019 willingness-to-pay (WTP). \n \n3. \nEconomic benefit was calculated using a semilog electricity demand function. Consumer \nsurplus\u2014the difference between what one is willing to pay for a commodity and the amount one \nis  actually  required  to  pay\u2014was  estimated  as  CNY0.77/kilowatt-hour  (kWh),  using  a  semilog \nfunction.1 The WTP for Project 1 was calculated by deducting the incremental cost of distribution \nand  transmission.  A  benchmark  figure  of  CNY0.16/kWh  was  used  to estimate  the  incremental \ntransmission and distribution cost. The final result of CNY0.61/kWh was used for all economic \nbenefit calculations.  \n \nC. \n \n4. \nwith-project (base) case and the without-project (alternative) case. The project analysis period is \n24 years following expected full operation by 2010. The project construction period is 4 years, \nbeginning  in  2006  to  the  end  of  2009.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  was \ncalculated at 19.6%, indicating that Project 1 is economically viable (Table A9.1).  \n \n5. \nA complete quantification and estimation of all benefits from the Project was not possible \ndue  to  various  factors  including  time  and  resources.  Thus,  the  total  benefits  estimated  in  this \nanalysis  can  be  interpreted  as  conservative  estimates.  There  are  large  positive  environmental \nbenefits from the avoided pollution\u2014the annual emission of 120 tons (t) particulate matter, 955 t \nsulfur dioxide (SO2), 750 t nitrogen oxide (NOx), and 183,000 t carbon dioxide (CO2)\u2014from an \nalternative  energy  source  (a  coal-fired  thermal  power  plant).  Among  these  environmental \nbenefits,  the  most  prominent  ones  are  (i)  improved  human  health  from  avoided  morbidity  and \nmortality  from  fine  particulates,  (ii)  improved  human  welfare  due  to  improved  visibility  and \nreduced  damage  to  materials  from  avoided  air  pollution,  and  (iii)  positive  impacts  on \nenvironmental  resources  due  to  avoided  emission  of  carbon  dioxide.  However,  these  benefits \n\nThe  basis  for  project  evaluation  is  a  comparison  of  benefits  and  costs  between  the      \n\nEstimation of the Economic Internal Rate of Return \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002.

The projected financial \nperformance  of  Erlongshan  Hydropower  Company  (EHC),  the  project  implementation  agency \n(PIA) for Project 1, is in its Appraisal Report.  \n \nA. \n \nHHDC  is  a  state-owned  enterprise,  established  in  September  2000  by  merging  four \n2. \nsmall  hydropower  plants  (HPPs)  and  other  related  businesses.  Currently,  there  are  five  HPPs \nmanaged  by  HHDC.  Xiaogushan  and  Longgu  No.1  power  plants  are  owned  by  HHDC  with \nmajority  shares,  while  power  plants  Longqu  No.2,  Longqu  No.3,  and  Yingke  used  to  be  fully \nowned by HHDC, but recently, part ownership of these assets was sold to HHDC staff to raise \nequity  for  the  Xiaogushan  and  Erlongshan  projects.  The  combined  balance  sheets,  income \nstatements, and cash flow statements of HHDC were audited by the Audit Bureau of Zhangye. \n \nHHDC  experienced  double-digit  revenue  growths  from  the  operations  of  its  four  small \n3. \npower  plants  in  2001  through  2003,  primarily  due  to  the  increasing  demand  for  electricity. \nDuring 2004\u20132005, power generation was stable since capacity utilization already reached the \nmaximum.  The  tariff  for  the  four  small  HPPs  increased  in  2006  from  CNY0.16  per            \nkilowatt-hour  (kWh)  to  CNY0.18/kWh.  The  gross  profit  margin  and  consequently,  net  profits, \nincreased  continuously  over  the  last  5  years  due  to  higher  revenues  coupled  with  improved \nproduction  efficiency  and  management  practices.  The  company\u2019s  net  profit  went  up  steadily \nfrom 3.6% of sales in 2001 to 30.2% in 2005. Return on net fixed assets increased from 0.6% in \n2001  up  to  9.7%  in  2005;  the  return  on  equity  increased  from  0.4%  to  4.9%  during  the  same \nperiod. \n \n4. \nBoth  the  interest  coverage  ratio  and  debt  service  coverage  ratio  were  satisfactory \nbecause  debt  gearing  is  low,  indicated  by  the  total  debt-to-equity  ratio  of  below  40:60  and  a \nlong-term  debt-to-total-capitalization  of  less  than  20%.  This  indicates  that  the  company  has \nenough capacity to handle further borrowing. The company retains all its earnings and flows this \nback  to  finance  its  ongoing  projects.  The  self-financing  ratio  was  high  and  sufficient  to  cover \ncapital expenditures. \n \n5. \nThe accounts receivable level is equivalent to less than 2 months of sales. The current \nratio however, was below 1. This is seen as temporary due to advances obtained from the staff \nfor  the  construction  of  the  staff\u2019s  residential  apartments.  After  completion,  the  apartment  units \nwill  be  given  to  the  staff  and  the  liability  will  be  offset.  In  general,  the  historical  financial \nperformance of HHDC was robust and its financial position is sound. \n \nHHDC\u2019s future financial performance will be greatly influenced by the operations of the \n6. \nXiaogushan Hydropower Project (XHP),2 which is now being commissioned, and the Erlongshan \nHydropower Project, which is under Asian Development Bank (ADB) evaluation. These projects \nare assessed to be financially viable and would result in additional financial benefits to HHDC. \nThe impact of the operations of the Dagushan hydropower project has not yet been analyzed, \nand is not included in the financial projections. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1  Heihe  Hydropower  Development  Company  is  the  parent  company  of  Xiaogushan  Hydropower  Company  and \nErlongshan Hydropower Company. It will also be the parent company of the project company that will be created \nfor Dagushan hydropower project. \n\n2  Xiaogushan Hydropower Project with a capacity of 102 megawatts is being developed under ADB Loan 2032-PRC.  \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 10   \n\n43\n\nAssumptions Used in Financial Projections \n\nB. \n \n7. \nHHDC holds over 50% of Xiaogushan Hydropower Company\u2019s (XHC) and EHC\u2019s equity, \nand  as  such  it  can  present  consolidated  financial  statements  using  the  equity  method  of \ncorporate  accounting.  The  projected  consolidated  income  statement  for  HHDC  over  the  next          \n10  years  was  prepared  on  the  basis  of  the  actual  figures  of  the  current  small  plants  and \nprojected figures for XHC and EHC. All the results from the power plants are consolidated into \nthe  total  financial  projection  for  HHDC.  The  company\u2019s  financial  position  and  performance  will \nstrengthen over time. \n \n8. \nFor the balance sheet projection, it is assumed that the operating assets of the existing \nplants will not change significantly, while the increase in total assets will be predominantly due \nto XHC and the Investment Program. The retained earnings of all the power plants will also be \ncombined  into  HHDC\u2019s  total.

The analysis was prepared in accordance with the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  guidelines  for  the  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of \nProjects.1  All  costs  are  expressed  in  constant  2006  prices. The  economic  life  of  the  Project  is \nestimated at 25 years with no residual value.  \n \n2. \nThe financial analysis of Project 2 will be carried out using the principles, methodology, \nand guidelines adopted for the analysis of Project 1, as detailed below, to clearly demonstrate \nits financial viability, which is a critical factor in the selection criteria and approval procedures of \nthe agreed-upon Framework Financing Agreement.   \n \nB. \n \nThe capital cost includes the base cost of all the hydropower plant\u2019s generation facilities, \n3. \nincluding the investment cost for the associated transmission facilities ($1.7 million or 4.2% of \nbase  cost).  It  also  includes  physical  contingencies,  but  excludes  price  contingencies  and \nfinancial charges during development. \n \n4. \nThe benefits from Project 1 will be derived from the sales of electricity generated by the \npower plant based on the projected yearly net generation level (68.9 gigawatt hours [GWh]) in \n2009;  137.8  GWh  in  2010;  and  172.2  GWh  from  2011)  and  the  calculated  tariff  of               \nCNY0.248. The applicable tariff corresponding to the investment for the associated transmission \nand distribution facilities could not be determined and therefore was not included in calculating \nthe financial internal rate of return (FIRR). \n \n5. \nand reservoir maintenance costs, administration, insurance, taxes, and other expenses. \n \n6. \nwas calculated based on the 15% preferential rate for 10 years and 33%, thereafter. \n \nC. \n \nThe  FIRR  of  Project  1  was  calculated  as  shown  in  Table  A11.1.  The  FIRR  is  5.8%, \n7. \nhigher than the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) estimated at 4.2%, and the financial \nnet present value (FNPV) is CNY63.3 million at this WACC. The project is considered financially \nfeasible. Inclusion of benefits2 under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) will improve the \nFIRR  to  6.8%  and  the  FNPV  to  CNY94.1  million.  The  financial  viability  of  the  subproject  was \nsubjected  to  sensitivity  analysis.  Sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the  FIRR  is  robust  under \nvarious adverse conditions (Table A11.2). \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nIs  the  sector \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China: \nThe  proposed  Multitranche  Financing  Facility  (MFF)  for  the  Hehei  river  cascade  hydropower  development  scheme \nconsists of Erlonghan Hydropower Project (Project 1), Dagushan Hydropower Project (Project 2), and another possible \nproject.  Zhangye  city  has  been  facing  chronic  electricity  shortages  for  several  years  due  to  low  installed  generation \ncapacity  in  the  city  and  large  distances  from  the  main  power  plants  of  Gansu  Province.  The  frequent  interruptions  of \nelectricity supply have been a major factor inhibiting the economic development of Zhangye. The power shortages are \nanticipated  to  become  more  acute  based  on  the  projected  growth  of  demand.  The  accelerated  implementation  of \nhydropower  plants  on  the  Heihe  river  cascade  scheme  is  a  key  priority  of  the  Zhangye  city  government  in  its   \n11th Five-Year Plan (11FYP) to meet part of the expected electricity shortage in an environment-friendly manner. \nB. \nTargeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nBasic Socioeconomic Profile in the Project Area \nThe Investment Program is located in Qilian Mountains near Gansu\u2019s southern border with Qinghai province. The run-of-\nriver  diversion  scheme  will  be  in  Xishui  township  of  Mati  district  in  Sunan  Yugu  Autonomous  county,  Zhangye  city, \nGansu  province.  In  Xishui,  Luzhuangzi  village  will  be  the  site  of  the  Project  1  weir.  The  electricity  generated  by  the \nInvestment Program is connected to the Zhangye power grid of the Hexi Corridor grid.  \n \nGansu  is ranked second  lowest among  31  provinces  in terms of gross domestic  product (GDP) per capita (CNY5,898 \ncompared with the national average CNY10,533) in 2004. Zhangye has five counties (Shandan, Mingle, Linze, Gaotai, \nand Sunan) and one district (Ganzhou) with a total population of 1.268 million, more than 76% of whom are classified as \nrural. Almost 30% or 293,000 of the rural population have incomes less than the national rural poverty line of CNY1,100. \nThe average income for farmers and herders in Sunan county where the Investment Program is located is CNY3,692 per \nperson  (provincial  poverty  line  for  herder  is  CNY1,650).  In  the  Investment  Program  area,  the  main  causes  of \neconomically  undeveloped  are \n(1,350  to  2,500  meters)  which  limits  diversification  of  income  opportunities.  The  directly  affected  population  lives  in \nLouzhuangzhi village and Bajiaowan village of Xishui township, with a combined population of 674. The villagers depend \non  herding  sheep  and  smaller  numbers  of  other  livestock  (such  as  yak,  horse,  donkey,  mule,  and  goats)  in  steep  dry \nmountain grasslands. Less than 10% of the labor force has nonagricultural livelihoods. A majority (67.8%) of households \ndepended  entirely  on  livestock  and  livestock  products  for  direct  consumption  and  sales  incomes.  There  were   \n15,800 livestock, of which 2,100 were large animals (yak, cow, horse, mule, and donkey) and 13,700 sheep and goats. \nThe Investment Program will bring the following benefits in the area. \n \nIncreased  Host  County\u2019s  Tax  Revenue.  The  Investment  Program  host  county  will  receive  tax  revenue  of  about   \nCNY4  million  per  annum  from  the  Project  Implementing  Agency  (PIA)  during  the  construction  period  and  will  receive \npreferential  tax  revenue  allocation  (5%  for  tax  revenue  from  power  generation  under  the  Investment  Program)  from \nZhangye city government.  \n   \nImproved Rural Infrastructure in Host County \nBefore  the  construction  of  Xiaogushan  (also  ADB  Loan-2032-PRC)  and  Project  1  of  Heihe  company,  Xishui  township \nhad unreliable land line telephone, no cell phone tower, and only one dirt road to the nearest township. It took more than \n8 hours to go to Zhangye by bus with only one bus running each week. The 78 kilometers of rural road was improved \nbecause  of  construction  in  the  Xiaogushan  project  and  another  30  kilometers  extended  and  improved  with  the \nconstruction  of  Project  1.  Now,  local  rural  people  travel  only  half  the  time  to  Zhangye  for  marketing,  shopping,  and \naccessing the hospital, and buses operate everyday. Also, the telephone line is not interrupted anymore and cell phones \nare in use. \n \nCreated Employment Opportunity under the Investment Program  \nIt is estimated under the 4-year construction period that the Investment Program will create employment opportunities at \na  peak  level  of  over  3,000  persons.  In  the  operation  stage,  about  60  persons  would  be  employed.  It  is  estimated  that \neach unskilled worker can earn CNY5,600 per year, assuming one worker works 280 days/year and earns CNY20/day, \nwhich is more than 3 times higher than the provincial poverty line for herders (CNY1,650). The Investment Program also \noffers  the  local  villagers  huge  opportunities  for  daily  commerce,  trading,  and  other  businesses  to  increase  their  cash \nincome during the construction period and also normal operation time.  \n \n \n\nthe  harsh  natural  conditions,  which \n\ninclude  high  altitude   \n\nrelated \n\nto \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n51\n\nFacilitate Local Social Development in the Investment Program Area \nThe Investment Program will enhance the quality of life of people by providing reliable and affordable electricity supply \ngenerated by clean energy. The PIA will implement additional measures to benefit local communities, including (i) hiring \nand  training  local  workers  for  project  construction;  (ii)  allowing  access  to  project  facilities  (e.g.,  medical  emergency \nfacilities,  transportation,  electricity  supply);  (iii)  supporting  purchases  of  local  supplies  and  services  for  the  local \ncommunities; and (iv)  providing a more reliable  electricity supply to local townships  after completion of  the Investment \nProgram.  \nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nRural and urban populations of the Zhangye grid, Heihe company, and the local government are identified as Investment \nProgram stakeholders.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n   No \nDuring preparation of the Investment Program, Heihe hydropower company undertook public meetings with local officials \nand village leaders. The meetings raised the level of awareness, gained local support, and enabled affected people to \nvoice opinions and suggestions for the Investment Program design and implementation. The participatory approach was \ninitiated  during  the  Investment  Program  design  and  is  an  ongoing  activity  that  will  be  continued  during  Investment \nProgram implementation. The poor and women have been carefully considered in conducting participatory activities.  \nD. \n\nGender Development  \n\n   Yes               \n\nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nReliable and affordable energy brought a better lifestyle to the households, especially for the women, and enabled them \nto purchase and use refrigerators, televisions, and mobile phones. Access to the mobile phone will allow them to better \ncommunicate with their husbands when the latter are absent from home for 6 months for herding. \nHas an output been prepared? \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\nE. \n\nItem \n\nSocial Safeguards and Other Social Risks \nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nNone \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n \n\nPlan \nRequired \n\n Full \n\n Short \n\n None  \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nrates \n\nSuch \n\nconsumption \n\nA  short  resettlement  plan  (RP)  was  prepared  for  Project  1. \nAs  for  other  possible  projects,  a  resettlement  plan  will  be \nprepared  in  accordance  with  the  agreed-upon  resettlement \nframework,  which  is  based  on  government  regulations  and \nADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement.  The  RP  will  be \ndisclosed  to  the  public  and  affected  people.  Internal  and \nexternal  monitoring  arrangements  will  be  put  in  place.  For \nProject  2,  the  impact  of  land  acquisition  is  not  expected  to \nbe significant; therefore, a short RP will be required. \nElectricity  is  becoming  affordable  to  the  poor  in  Xishui \ntownship.  In  the  Investment  Program  area,  the  typical \nconsumption  of  electricity  for  rural  households  ranges  from \n10 kilowatt-hours to 26 kilowatt-hours per month, mostly for \nlighting. \nCNY50\u2013CNY300  per  year,  which  represents  2\u201310%  of  the \nhousehold\u2019s net income. \nThe Investment Program will hire unskilled labor in the local \ntownships.

The public disclosure of the \nRP  could  be  carried  out  by  holding  meeting,  putting  up  notice  in  the  affected  villages  and \ndistributing resettlement information booklet to the affected people.  \n \n12. \nComplaints  and  grievance  procedures  for  land  acquisition  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nChina  are  well  established.  Grievances  will  first  be  lodged  with  the  village  committee.  If  no \nsettlement is reached within 2 weeks, the complainant has 1 month to elevate the grievances to \nXishui  Township  Government  of  Sunan  County.  If  the  question  is  still  unresolved  within              \n2 weeks, the case can be sent to and settled by negotiation at the Project Implementing Agency \n(PIA) Office.  \n \nG. \n \nThe  PIA  is  responsible  for  preparing  both  the  Chinese  and  English  versions  of  the  RP \n13. \nupon completion of the land measurement survey and will submit it to ADB within 1 month from \nland  measurement  survey  for  review  and  approval.  Once  ADB  approves  the  RP,  the  PIA  will \nimplement it in accordance with the provisions stated herein as well as the relevant local laws.  \n \n14. \nThe  PIA  will  assign  one  resettlement  officer  to  deal  with  implementation  of  land \nacquisition  and  liaise  with  affected  households  and  other  relevant  government  offices.  Local \ngovernments  (Sunan  Grassland  Management  Office  and  the  township  government)  are \nresponsible  for  carrying  out  the  formal  land  compensation  and  transfer  procedures.  This  is \nhandled  by  Xishui  Township  under  the  supervision  of  the  Sunan  County  Land  and  Resources \nOffice and Sunan County Grassland Management Office).  \n \nBoth  the  PIA  and  local  governments  (Sunan  Grassland  Management  Office  and  the \n15. \ntownship government) are responsible for maintaining records of project impacts, compensation \nand  related  documents.  To  ensure  proper  implementation,  the  village  committees  will  provide \nsupport  to  the  affected  households  through  information  dissemination,  adequate  consultation, \neffective  grievance  procedures,  asset  measurement  and  valuation,  compensation  payments, \nand rehabilitation measures, and skills training and employment. The Sunan County Audit Office \nwill regularly check that compensation funds are properly administered.  \n \n\nInstitutional Arrangements \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n57\n\nImplementation Process \n\nH. \n \n16. \nframework is being complied with. \n \n\nThe following steps will be carried out by the PIA to ensure that the resettlement policy \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nimplementation  agency,  with \n\nConduct  Land  Measurement  Survey  and  Socioeconomic  Survey.  The  land \nmeasurement  survey  of  the  project  site  will  be  carried  out  by  the  relevant \nresettlement \nthe  participation  of  affected \nhouseholds,  staff  from  project  owner,  and  officials  from  township  and  villages \nconcerned.  During  the  survey,  the  scope  of  land  acquisition  and  demolition \nimpacts  for  all  affected  households  will  be  carefully  measured,  and  then \nconfirmed  by  the  affected  people.  Also,  a  socioeconomic  baseline  survey \nincluding gender analysis will be conducted for 100% of the affected households. \n\nConsultation  with  Affected  People.  The  compensation  policies  and \nrehabilitation  measures  in  the  RP  will  be  discussed  with  affected  villages  and \nindividuals.  The  comments  and  feedback  from  local  governments  and  affected \npeople will be reviewed by the project owner and considered in finalizing the RP. \n\nPrepare  the  RP.  Based  on  the  detailed  impact  survey,  a  RP  including \ncompensation  rates,  budget,  livelihood  rehabilitation  plans,  and  monitoring \narrangements  will  be  prepared  by  the  project  owner  based  on  this  resettlement \npolicy  framework.  The  RP  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval  at \nleast 3 months prior to acquisition of the land. \n\nDisclose  the  RP  Policy  to  the  Affected  People.  After  the  RP  is  finalized  with \ndetailed compensation standards and rehabilitation measures, it will be disclosed \nto  the  affected  people,  villages,  and  relevant  government  offices.  The  public \ndisclosure  of  RP  could  be  carried  out  by  holding  public  meetings,  putting  up \nnotice in the affected villages, or distributing resettlement information booklets to \nthe affected people. The endorsed RP will be uploaded on ADB\u2019s website.  \n\nSign  Compensation  Contract  and  Pay  Compensation  to  the  Affected \nPeople.  The  final  step  of  resettlement  implementation  is  to  sign  compensation \ncontracts and deliver payments to the affected villages and people, which should \nbe completed prior to the transfer of land use rights, displacement of housing or \ndispossession of assets. A copy of the compensation contract has to be given to \nthe  affected  people  from  the  respective  agencies  for  record.  Along  with  cash \ncompensation,  the  project  owner  and  local  governments  will  provide  necessary \nassistance during the relocation and rehabilitation.

Internal resettlement monitoring will be carried out by the PIA and \n17. \nXishui Township. During the land acquisition stage, the PIA and Xishui Township will maintain \nrecords  of  land  acquisition  impacts,  compensation  payments  in  the  Project  to  affected \nhouseholds  and  grievances.  Monitoring  results  will  be  included  in  the  section  of  quarterly \nprogress  reports  submitted  to  ADB.  The  Sunan  County  Land  and  Resources  Bureau  will \nconduct  regular  audits  of  the  compensation  activities.

The  PIA  will  contract  an  independent  local  monitor  for  8  weeks \nover  4  years  to  assess  socioeconomic  progress  and  to  carry  out  independent  monitoring  and \nevaluation  of  land  compensation  activities.  The  method  of  resettlement  monitoring  and \nevaluation  will  be  based  on  household  surveys,  community  group  discussion  and  rapid \nappraisal  in  the  field.  The  independent  monitor  will  assess  whether  (i)  project  implementation \ncomplies  with  the  policies  and  entitlements  set  out  in  the  RP;  (ii)  the  livelihood  activities  of \naffected  people  have  been  fully  restored;  and  (iii)  the  affected  people  have  directly  benefited \nfrom the Project. The independent monitor should make recommendations to the PIA about how \nto  improve  implementation.  The  independent  monitor  will  carry  out  (i)  resettlement  monitoring \nand  evaluation  once  a  year  and  prepare  an  annual  monitoring  and  evaluation  report  for \nsubmission  to  ADB  and  (ii)  ex-post  evaluation  1  year  after  completion  of  land  acquisition  and \nprepare the report for submission to ADB.  \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n60 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nINVESTMENT PROGRAM AND PROJECT 1 READINESS FILTER \n\nIntroduction \n\nInvestment Program Readiness  \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nThe  proposed  Multitranche  Financing  Facility  (MFF)  for  the  Investment  Program  is  the  first \nMFF in the People\u2019s Republic of China. The project processing team has put special emphasis on a \nbottom-up approach in explaining the implementation of the MFF within the Government. The project \nimplementing agencies (PIAs), Zhangye city government (ZCG), relevant bureau in Gansu provincial \ngovernment  (GPG),  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission  (NDRC),  and  Ministry  of \nFinance (MOF) were regularly consulted and briefed.   \n \nB. \n \n2. \nFramework Financing Agreement. The draft framework financing agreement (FFA) setting \nout  the  principles  by  which  ADB  would  provide  financing  and  the  Government  would  avail  of  such \nfinancing was signed with the Government on 27 October 2006.  \n \n3. \nFirst Periodic Financing Request (PFR). The first project under the Investment Program is \nready for implementation (Table A15). The PFR for Project 1 in the amount of $22 million was also \nsubmitted  by  the  Government  on  27  October  2006.  A  detailed  appraisal  report  on  Project  1  was \nprepared and reviewed by ADB. There are no outstanding issues. \n \nSafeguard  Frameworks.  The  environmental  and  social  safeguard  frameworks  were \n4. \ndiscussed in detail and agreed upon with the PIAs and the Executing Agency (GPG). Both projects \nin  the  Investment  Program  are  environmental  category  A.  The  Project  1  summary  environmental \nimpact  assessment  (SEIA)  was  circulated  to  the  Board  on  10  April  2006.  Also  for  Project  1,  the \ninvoluntary resettlement and indigenous people categories are B. The short resettlement plan (RP) \nfor Project 1 was prepared by the PIA and reviewed by ADB. The safeguard documents for Project 2 \nwill  be  prepared  by  the  PIA  as  per  the  agreed-upon  safeguard  frameworks.  Technical  assistance \n(TA) consultants will assist the PIA. ADB will closely monitor and review the safeguard documents.  \n \n5.  \nCapacity to Manage the Investment Program. The detailed assessment was carried out by \nthe TA consultants and ADB. Based on the assessment, and the performance of the PIA, ZCG, and \nGPG  on  an  ongoing  project  loan  in  the  scheme,  there  is  adequate  capacity  in  the  Government  to \nmanage the Investment Program. ADB loan review missions will continue to monitor compliance and \nassist the Government on a as-required basis.     \n \nC. \n\nProject 1\u2014Implementation Readiness  \n\n \nTable A15: Project 1 Readiness Filter \n \n\nStatus \n\nKey Readiness Filters  \n\n1.
