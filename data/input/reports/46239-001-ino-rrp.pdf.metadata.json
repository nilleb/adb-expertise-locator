Like many other economies, the Indonesian \n2. \neconomy has been affected by the deterioration in the global economic outlook and turbulence \nin the financial markets. Learning from lessons from the 1997\u20131998 Asian crisis and the 2008\u2013\n2009  global  financial  crisis,  the  government  has  introduced  various  measures  to  safeguard \nagainst  any  major  trade  and  financial  impacts  emanating  from  the  current  global  economic \nsituation.  The  proposed  $500  million  facility  (a  countercyclical  support  facility  [CSF]  with  a \nprecautionary  financing  option)  will  bolster  the  government\u2019s  preparedness  to  cushion  the \nimpact of higher volatility in the financial market, given the government\u2019s increased dependence \non the market to finance its budget requirements.  The government has met the access criteria \nfor a CSF: (i) continued good macroeconomic management; (ii) potentially significant economic \nimpact  (resulting  in  this  case  from  a  possible  worsening  in  the  eurozone  crisis  and  the  global \neconomic slowdown); and (iii) implementation of a countercyclical program in the revised 2012 \nbudget (Appendix 4).2 \n \n3. \nContingent  financing  approach.  The  facility  will  be  part  of  a  $5.0  billion\u2013$5.5  billion \ncontingent financing package provided by ADB, the Government of Japan, the Government of \nAustralia,  and  the  World  Bank.  The  Government  of  Indonesia  is  committed  to  first  meeting  its \nfinancing  needs  from  market  sources  and  will  back  up  its  intention  with  confidence-boosting \npolicy measures. It will use the facility as an insurance device and fallback option to be utilized \nonly  if  market  stabilization  operation,  utilization  of  alternative  debt  financing  sources,  and \nutilization of accumulative surplus cash are unable to fulfill the financing need.3 The government \nbelieves that the announcement of this support package would send a strong positive signal to \nthe  markets,  making  it  more  likely  that  Indonesia  would  meet  its  financing  needs  in  2012  and \n2013 from market sources. \n \nB. \n\nGlobal Economic Turbulence and Indonesia Context \n\n4. \nImpacts of the eurozone crisis. The eurozone crisis, which intensified after September \n2011, and the global economic slowdown continue to present risks to the Indonesian economy \nthrough two main channels: trade and finance. \n\n(i) \n\nTrade channel. After expanding by 37% (year on year) in January\u2013August 2011, \nthe country\u2019s export growth declined in September\u2013December 2011 following the \nIndonesia\u2019s  diversified  export  destination  and \neurozone  crisis.  Despite \ncommodity composition, export growth ended up much lower at 27.5% for 2011. \nOverall, net exports still contributed 1.5 percentage points to the country\u2019s 6.5% \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   ADB. 2009. Enhancing ADB\u2019s Response to the Global Economic Crisis \u2500 Establishing the Countercyclical Support \n\nFacility. Manila. \n\n3  Utilization of the Precautionary Financing Facility (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n2\n\n \n\n(ii) \n\neconomic growth in 2011. Preliminary data for 2012 point to a further decline in \nexport  growth:  year-on-year  growth  for  the  first  quarter  of  2012  decreased  to \n5.1%,  from  30.8%  in  the  same  period  in  2011.  This  suggests  that  the  dynamic \nsupport received from external demand in 2011 before the eurozone crisis will be \nabsent in 2012 and possibly the year after. \nFinancial  channel. Indonesia has been more vulnerable to volatility in financial \nmarkets because of its relatively open capital account and the significant foreign \npresence  in  its  stock  and  bond  markets.  At  the  same  time,  the  domestic  bond \nmarket  is  still  very  shallow  at  13.4%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  2011 \n(34.8% in the Philippines and 67.5% in Thailand). As a result, government bond \nyields are relatively more volatile than in other countries in East Asia. In February \n2011,  the  yield  of  the  5-year  rupiah  bond  rose  to  8.5%  due  to  negative  market \nsentiment related to the eurozone crisis and expectations of accelerated inflation \ndriven  by  soaring  food  prices.  During  September\u2013November  2011,  the  Jakarta \nStock  Exchange  composite  index  experienced  a  massive  correction  of  about \n15%. Nonresident investor holdings of rupiah-denominated tradable government \nsecurities  fell  from  $29.3  billion  in  July  to  $23.4  billion  at  the  end  of  November \n2011. Reflecting significant capital outflows from government securities and other \nportfolios,  the  balance  of  payments  turned  into  a  deficit  in  the  second  half  of \n2011,  and  the  country\u2019s  gross  international  reserves  dropped  by  $14.5  billion, \nfrom $124.6 billion in August 2011 to $110.1 billion in December 2011. \n\n2010 \n995.3 \n723.3 \n268.9 \n1,042.1 \n697.4 \n144.0 \n80.3 \n344.7 \n41.5 \n(46.8) \n(0.7) \n\n2011 \n1,199.5 \n872.6 \n324.2 \n1,289.6 \n949.2 \n255.6 \n115.9 \n411.4 \n3.2 \n(90.1) \n(1.1) \n\nTable 1: Budget Summary, 2009\u20132012 \n(Rp trillion) \n2009 \n848.8 \n619.9 \n227.2 \n937.4 \n628.8 \n94.6 \n75.9 \n308.6 \n5.2 \n(88.6) \n(1.6) \n\nItem  \n State Revenue and Grants \n 1.

Indonesia\u2019s  gross  financing  needs \nremain high (Table 1) despite its low budget deficit and continued decline in debt-to-GDP ratio. \nIn  2012,  with  a  budget  deficit  target  of  2.2%  of  GDP,  the  government  will  need  to  borrow \nRp326.8  trillion  ($36.2  billion  or  3.8%  of  GDP),  reflecting  increasing  debt  amortization.  At  the \nsame  time,  in  line  with  the  government  strategy  to  develop  and  deepen  the  domestic  capital \nmarket,  the  share  of  financing  from  market  sources  has  increased  significantly  from  59.7%  in \n2009 to 75.6% in 2012. With increasing reliance on market sources to meet its financing needs, \n\n2012 \n1,358.2 \n1,016.2 \n341.1 \n1,548.3 \n1,069.5 \n202.4 \n168.7 \n478.8 \n(72.3) \n(190.1) \n(2.2) \n360.7 \n326.8 \n272.0 \n53.7 \n1.1 \n33.9 \n170.6 \n162.2 \n8.4 \n\n225.5 \n236.4 \n204.4 \n31.7 \n0.0 \n(19.9) \n135.4 \n131.8 \n3.6 \n\n248.3 \n207.2 \n148.5 \n58.7 \n\u2026 \n41.1 \n123.3 \n117.1 \n6.2 \n\n248.2 \n222.8 \n167.6 \n54.8 \n0.4 \n25.4 \n135.9 \n127.2 \n8.7 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\n3\n\n \n\nmarket volatility larger than what took place at the outset of the eurozone crisis could disrupt the \nfinancing of the 2012 budget. \n \n6.  \nIn its April 2012 Asian Development Outlook, ADB suggests that uncertainties from the \neurozone  remain.  While  the  risk  of  a  European  liquidity  crisis  has  diminished,  fiscal  austerity \nacross the eurozone could slow economic growth. If the global economic situation worsens, the \nlikely impacts include weaker export demand, more volatility of capital flows, and less availability \nof  trade  finance.  Policy  responses  should  include  switching  to  social  and  infrastructure \nspending, expanding expenditures while boosting revenues, and combating rising inequality. \n \n7. \n2012 can be summarized in the following three scenarios.4 \n\nThe potential impacts of the eurozone's economic turmoil on the Indonesian economy in \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nMild  baseline  scenario.  The  sovereign  debt  crisis  in  Europe  will  be  resolved \ngradually  and  the  economic  recession  in  some  countries  in  the  eurozone  will \nremain  mild,  with  limited  second-round  impacts  on  Indonesia\u2019s  main  trading \npartners. As efforts are made to diversify export destinations, Indonesia\u2019s exports \nwill  weaken  only  moderately.  At  the  same  time,  the  government  will  introduce \nmeasures to stimulate domestic demand through both fiscal and monetary policy \nto  compensate \nthis  scenario, \nfor  weakening  export  performance.  Under \neconomic growth will fall slightly short of the government\u2019s 6.5% target. \nSlower  growth  scenario.  The  uncertainty  over  the  ultimate  resolution  of  the \nlingering sovereign debt crisis in Europe and related austerity measures remains \nand the economic recession in some countries in the eurozone will deepen, with \nmore  pronounced  second-round  impacts  on  Indonesia\u2019s  main  trading  partners. \nUnder this scenario, with a more significant decline in exports, economic growth \nin  Indonesia  could  miss  the  government's  target  by  about  1  percentage  point. \nThe impact of this external development on the domestic financial market will be \nlimited  to  a  brief  volatility  and  temporary  correction  without  disrupting  the \ngovernment\u2019s access to market financing. \nCrisis  scenario. The economic recession in some countries in Europe will turn \ninto  a  wider  and  deeper  crisis  that  affects  more  European  core  countries  and \nother developed nations outside the eurozone. Similar to 2008, the crisis will not \nonly  weaken  international  trade  substantially,  but  will  also  severely  affect  the \nfinancial  markets  in  developed  and  emerging  economies.  Under  this  scenario, \neconomic growth in Indonesia could miss the government's target by more than \n1.5  percentage  points.  More  importantly,  the  impact  of  the  global  crisis  on \nfinancial  markets  would  also  be  significant,  affecting  domestic \ndomestic \nconfidence and disrupting the government\u2019s access to budget financing through \npossible capital outflows and increased borrowing spreads. Under this scenario, \nwithout  the  contingent  financing  package,  spending  on  priority  sectors  such  as \ninfrastructure  and  education  would  be  negatively  affected.  An  economic \nslowdown  of  more  than  1.5%  would  have  a  serious  impact  on  unemployment, \npotentially  affecting  0.8  million  people.  In  addition,  the  quality  of  employment \nwould be reduced as up to 4 million of the labor force could move to the informal \nsector, as experienced in the 2008\u20132009 global financial crisis. \n\n \n8. \nLessons  from  earlier  ADB  countercyclical  support  and  development  partner \ncoordination. The ADB Independent Evaluation Department\u2019s 5special evaluation study for the \n                                                 \n4  Summary Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n5   ADB. 2011. Special Evaluation Study: Real-Time Evaluation of Asian Development Bank\u2019s Response to the Global \n\nEconomic Crisis of 2008-2009. Manila \n\n \n\n\f \n4\n\n \n\nimplementation  of  ADB\u2019s  past  CSFs  in  five  countries,  including  Indonesia,  recommended  the \nintroduction  of  a  precautionary  financing  option  as  a  facility  variant.  These  recommendations \nhave  now  been  reflected  under  the  existing  policy  for  policy-based  lending. 6 Therefore,  the \ngovernment\u2019s  request  represents  an  opportunity  for  ADB  to  utilize  this  innovative  modality  to \nmeet the needs of a middle-income developing member country like Indonesia. The facility is an \noutcome of ADB policy dialogue with the government in coordination with development partners \non crisis monitoring, crisis management protocol, and other related reforms.7 \n \nC. \n\nMacroeconomic Management \n\n9. \nSwift  response  and  proactive  measures. The government\u2019s response to the risks of \nthe  eurozone  crisis  was  swift  and  involved  various  proactive  measures  aimed  at  maintaining \nconfidence in the domestic finance sector. To anticipate the potential risks associated with large \ncapital  inflows  into  government  rupiah  securities,  in  mid-2011  the  government  introduced  the \nbond  stabilization  framework.  The  framework  includes  actions  to  stabilize  the  domestic  bond \nmarket  in  case  of  market  turbulence,  such  as a  buyback  mechanism  in  the  secondary  market \nusing  funds  from  the  state  budget;  fund-pooling  by  state-owned  enterprises;  and  utilizing  the \naccumulated  budget  surplus.  The  government  also  updated  its  crisis  management  protocol, \nspecifying  appropriate  responses  at  different  levels  of  crisis  for  Bank  Indonesia,  Ministry  of \nFinance (Directorate General of Debt Management Office), and Badan Pengawas Pasar Modal \ndan Lembaga Keuangan (Capital Market Supervisory Agency). \n\nIndonesia  (Bank \n\nfor  Sertifikat  Bank \n\n10. \nBank  Indonesia  also  implemented  macroprudential  measures  to  reduce  short-term  and \nspeculative  capital  inflows  and  mitigate  the  risks  of  sudden  reversals.  These  measures  are \nIndonesia \nintroducing  a  minimum  holding  period \ncertificates),  reinstating  limits  on  short-term  offshore  borrowing  of  commercial  banks  to  a \nmaximum  of  30%  of  capital,  and  increasing  banks\u2019  foreign  currency  reserve  requirements.  In \nMarch 2012, to reduce currency speculation, Bank Indonesia also issued a regulation requiring \nevidence  of  an  underlying  real-sector  transaction  for  foreign  currency  transactions  above \n$100,000.  Bank  Indonesia  also  tightened  lending  standards  for  motor  vehicle  financing  by \nraising the down-payment requirement. After the inflation downward trend firmed in the second \nhalf of 2011, Bank Indonesia started an easing cycle in October 2011 by cutting its policy rate \nby 100 basis points (bps) through February 2012. The cuts were also taken to frontload some \nadjustment measures in response to the expected global economic slowdown. \n \n11. \nRecent  macroeconomic  developments.  The  country\u2019s  macroeconomic  condition  has \nremained  sound  despite  the  global  economic  slowdown.  The  mix  of  policy  responses  has \nproven effective so far. The financial market stabilized quickly from the turbulence resulting from \nthe eurozone crisis in September 2011. Despite declining nonresident holdings of local-currency \ngovernment securities in the August\u2013November 2011 period, the yields of 5-year rupiah bonds \nwere  down  by  about  115  bps  in  2011.  After  recovering  further  in  January\u2500March  2012,  the \nyields  were  under  pressure  in  May  due  to  declining  nonresident  investor  holdings  of  rupiah \ndenominated tradable government bonds, reflecting heightened uncertainty in the eurozone and \nweaker global economic prospects. The rupiah also depreciated by about 3.5% in May. \n \n12. \nGDP growth edged up to 6.5% year on year in 2011, from 6.2% in 2010, supported by \nsustained private consumption, stronger investment, and expanding net exports. GDP growth in \nthe first quarter of 2012 weakened to 6.3% due to lower export growth. Consumer confidence \nhas  also  declined  since  February  over  weakening  income  expectations.  Year-on-year  inflation \n                                                 \n6   ADB. 2011. Review of ADB\u2019s Policy-Based Lending. Manila. . \n7  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\n5\n\n \n\nrates fell from 7.0% in late 2010 to 3.8% at the end of 2011, as food price inflation decelerated \nsharply  from  15.6%  to  3.6%.  The  deceleration  trend  was  reversed  in  March  and  the  year-on-\nyear  inflation  rate  edged  up  to  4.5%  in  April.  This  is  attributed  to  increased  inflationary \nexpectation associated with the government\u2019s earlier plan to increase fuel prices. \n \n13. \nThe actual budget deficit for 2011 was 1.2% of GDP, again lower than the government\u2019s \ntarget  of  2.1%.  The  lower-than-budgeted  deficit  resulted  from  a  combination  of  better  revenue \nperformance  and  lower  capital  expenditures,  offsetting  higher  spending  on  energy  subsidies. \nTax  revenue  collection  was  up  by  0.7%  of  GDP,  achieved  through  widening  the  tax  net  and \nimproving  tax  administration.  As  a  result,  the  tax-to-GDP  ratio  edged  up  to  11.8%  of  GDP  in \n2011,  from  11.2%  in  2010.  On  the  expenditure  side,  under-disbursement  in  capital  spending \ncontinued in 2011, although the outcome was slightly better than in 2010. However, higher-than-\nexpected  oil  prices  boosted  spending  for  fuel  and  electricity  subsidies  to  3.4%  of  GDP,  from \n2.2% in 2010. With a lower deficit, the debt-to-GDP ratio of the government fell further to 25% in \n2011, maintaining its down trend. \n \nThe  country\u2019s  external  position  improved  after  the  economic  turbulence  in  September \n14. \nand October 2011. After recording a large surplus in the first half of 2011, the capital account \nturned  into  deficit  in  the  second  half  of  the  year,  reflecting  increased  portfolio  capital  outflows \ndriven  by  the  prolonged  uncertainties  in  the  eurozone.  Consequently,  net  portfolio  investment \nplunged by 68.2% to $4.2 billion in 2011. However, foreign direct investment (FDI) rose strongly \nby 31.9% to a record level of $18.2 billion, in line with increased investor interest in Indonesia\u2019s \nburgeoning consumer demand. While the current account surplus fell further (to 0.2% of GDP), \nthe  balance-of-payments  surplus  remained  large  at  $11.9 billion  due  to  strong  FDI  inflows.  At \nthe  end  of  2011,  the  gross  international  reserves  increased  by  $13.9  billion  to  $110.1  billion. \nDespite  weakening  export  performance  in  January-April  2012,  gross  international  reserves \nincreased to $116.4 billion (6.4 months of imports and government debt payments). \n \nReflecting  the  country\u2019s  strong  macroeconomic  performance  and  resilience,  rating \n15. \nagencies  upgraded  Indonesia  to  investment  grade.  Fitch  Ratings  upgraded  Indonesia\u2019s \nsovereign credit rating to BBB\u2013 on December 15, 2011; Moody\u2019s followed suit on January 18, \n2012 (Baa3). The upgrades are expected to boost the flow of long-term capital into the country. \n \n16. \nDebt sustainability. Indonesia\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio has fallen steadily since 2001, even \nagainst the backdrop of the 2008\u20132009 global financial crisis. The government\u2019s countercyclical \nspending program is not expected to adversely affect debt sustainability as a large proportion of \nthe 2012 budget stimulus is devoted to additional infrastructure spending, which will improve the \ncapacity  of  the  economy  to  keep  growing  in  the  medium  term.  Even  with  a  10%  increase  in \ngovernment  debt  liability  in  2012,  the  debt  ratio  is  projected  to  return  to  the  current  level  by \n2016.8 \n \nD. \n \n17. \nInfrastructure  and  social  spending.  In  light  of  the  continued  uncertain  outlook  in  the \ninternational  economic  environment  (oil  price  volatility,  a  fragile  recovery  in  the  United  States, \neurozone  economic  concerns,  and  slowing  growth  in  emerging  economies),  the  2012  budget \nincludes  provisions  to  give  the  government  more  flexibility  in  managing  and  mitigating  risks \nemanating  from  a  more  volatile  external  environment.  The  2012  budget  allocates  significant \nadditional resources to implement the Masterplan for Acceleration and Expansion of Indonesia's \n\nThe Government\u2019s Countercyclical Support Measures \n\n                                                 \n8  Debt Sustainability Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f \n6\n\n \n\nEconomic  Development  (MP3EI),  2011\u20132025.  The  MP3EI  includes  efforts  to  accelerate \ninfrastructure  development,  introduce  key  reforms  to  remove  bottlenecks,  and  close  the \ndevelopment  gap  between  the  eastern  and  western  regions  of  Indonesia  by  improving \nconnectivity  and  developing  six  economic  corridors.  To  address  the  removal  of  infrastructure \nbottlenecks,  the  budget  boosts  capital  increased  by  45.6%  in  2012  from  that  in  2011.  The \nbudget  also  increases  social  spending,  including  for  the  country\u2019s  flagship  poverty  reduction \nprograms  such  as  Program  Nasional  Pemberdayaan  Masyarakat  (Community  Empowerment \nProgram).  To anticipate the impacts of weaker global growth and increasing oil prices, in March \n2012 the Parliament passed a revision to the 2012 budget, widening the fiscal deficit to 2.2% of \nGDP from an originally planned 1.5%. The revised budget contains three key components: (i) a \nprovision  to  increase  the  administered  domestic  fuel  price  once  the  6-month  average  of  the \nIndonesian crude oil price exceeds $120.80; (ii) an additional $2.8 billion of social spending to \ncompensate  Indonesians  for  inflation  resulting  from  any  fuel  price  rise,  comprising  direct  cash \ntransfers  and  rural  infrastructure  investment;  and  (iii)  conditional  cash  transfers.  The  revised \nbudget also allocates an additional $1.9 billion in capital spending. \n \nStrengthening  public  finance  management.  The  effectiveness  of  the  government\u2019s \n18. \nfiscal stimulus depends on better budget execution. Execution of investment projects continues \nto  be  a  challenge.  The  key  agencies  implementing  infrastructure  spending  (the  ministries  of \nPublic Works and Transportation) have relatively low absorptive capacity rates, causing delays \nin  disbursements  and  procurement  that  could  undermine  the  government\u2019s  stimulus  package. \nTherefore, measures to accelerate disbursement of capital spending will form an important part \nof  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to  stimulate  domestic  demand.  Attempts  by  the  government  to \nremove obstacles to more efficient budget execution since 2010 have had mixed success, to a \nlarge extent because of the relatively old regulation governing budget execution. To be able to \nuse  fiscal  policy  to  stimulate  domestic  demand  in  case  of  a  crisis,  projects  need  to  be \nimplemented  in  a  swift  manner.  To  rectify  the  constraints  above,  the  government  recently \nestablished  a  task  force  to  accelerate  budget  disbursements,  led  and  coordinated  by  the  Unit \nKerja  Presiden  Bidang  Pengawasan  dan  Pengendalian  Pembangunan  (President\u2019s  Delivery \nUnit  for  Development  Monitoring  and  Oversight).  The  government  is  now  revising  related \nregulations to improve budget execution. \n \nBetter  poverty  targeting  approach.  To  further  accelerate  the  pace  of  poverty \n19. \nreduction, the government is pursuing key reforms of its national poverty reduction programs to \nachieve  the  target  set  in  Rencana  Pembangunan  Jangka  Menengah  Nasional  (National \nMedium-Term  Development  Plan),  2010\u20132014.  These  efforts  include  establishing  a  national \ntargeting  system  to  ensure  that  program  benefits  accurately  reach  the  poor  and  vulnerable \nhouseholds.  Currently,  household  poverty  reduction  programs  use  different \ntargeting \napproaches  and  rely  on  separate  recipient  databases.  This  leads  to  duplication  of  efforts  and \ninconsistency  in  application,  and  dampens  program  impact.  The  national  targeting  system  will \nconstruct  and  maintain  a  unified  targeting  database,  to  be  used  by  all  programs,  on  potential \nbeneficiaries  drawn  from  the  poorest  40%  of  the  population.  The  single  source  of  quality-\ncontrolled  data  will  help  improve  programs'  targeting  outcomes  and  boost  synergies  between \nprograms. A unified database also reduces fraud, corruption, and duplication, while simplifying \nprogram exit strategies. \n \nE. \n \nEconomic  stimulus  effects.  While  domestic  consumption  provides  a  good  base  for \n20. \nstable  growth,  a  supportive  external  environment  is  essential  for  stronger  growth  dynamics \nthrough  exports  and  investment.  In  2011,  net  exports  contributed  1.5 percentage  points  to  the \n\nEconomic Impacts of the Government\u2019s Countercyclical Measures \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\n7\n\n \n\nImpact, Output, Scope, and Coverage  \n\ncountry\u2019s  economic  growth.  Dynamic  export  growth  also  stimulated  a  large  inflow  of  FDI. \nTherefore, if export growth stagnated, economic growth could be significantly reduced by about \n1  percentage  point\u20131.5  percentage  points.  The  fiscal  stimulus  package  is  required  to  mitigate \nthe potential impact of an export slowdown. Assuming that the average  multiplier effect of the \ngovernment\u2019s fiscal stimulus is close to one, the ideal size of the fiscal stimulus should be close \nto 1%\u20131.5% of GDP. In the context of Indonesia, this can be achieved through a combination of \nincreased spending and better budget execution.  In 2010\u20132011, the government was not able \nto optimally use the available fiscal space, ranging from 0.5% to 1% of GDP. Past experience \nalso suggests that an economic growth rate of above 6% per annum is necessary to ensure a \nsustained  reduction  in  unemployment  and  poverty.    A  stronger  growth  in  2011  reduced  the \nnumber of people below the poverty line by 1.1 million (footnote 4). In addition, it led to a higher \nquality of job creation.  \n \nF. \n \n21 \nThe impact of the facility will be to sustain the government\u2019s capacity to achieve pro-poor \neconomic  growth  over  the  medium  term.  The  outcome  will  be  sustained  priority  government \nspending  and  higher  domestic  demand.  This  will  in  turn  generate  jobs  and  sustain  poverty \nreduction during a period of high global economic uncertainties. \n \nFinancing  plan  and  ADB  risk-bearing  capacity.  The  government  has  requested  a \n22. \nloan of $500,000,000 under the facility from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility  plus  200  bps9 and  a  rebate  or  surcharge  reflecting  the  cost  of  funds;  a  5-year  term, \nincluding a grace period of 3 years; annuity-style repayment option; commitment charge of 75 \nbps on the undisbursed loan balance; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially \nin accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. Based on \nthese loan terms and repayment option, the average loan maturity is 4.28 years and there is no \nmaturity premium payable to ADB. The government has provided ADB with: (i) the reasons for \nits  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  based  on  these  terms  and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n  \nThe facility loan is in line with ADB\u2019s long term capital adequacy framework.10 The facility \n23. \nloan, if approved, is expected to have a positive implication on ADB's medium to long term risk \nbearing capacity, based on its term of 5 years and market-based interest spread of 200 basis \npoints.  For  example,  an  immediate  disbursement  of  $500  million  could  result  in  an  improved \nequity-to-loan ratio of about 3\u20134 basis point by 2017 when the loan is fully repaid. \n \n24. \nThe  government  is  committed  to  first  meeting  its  financing  need  from  market  sources \nand  will  back  up  its  intention  with  confidence-boosting  policy  measures.  In  this  context,  the \ngovernment has placed the task of reassuring financial markets at the top of its crisis response \nagenda. The government recognizes that maintaining financial market confidence is critical to its \nability  to  mobilize  the  necessary  resources  to  finance  public  expenditures  and  to  the  overall \neconomic  prospects  of  the  country.  Therefore,  under  both  the  baseline and  the  slower  growth \nscenarios  (para.  7),  the  government  will  maintain  macroeconomic  stability  and  implement \nconfidence-boosting  policy  measures  such  as  the  bond  stabilization  framework  and  other \nmacroprudential  measures  to  ensure  financial  market  confidence.  Under  these  two  scenarios, \n\n                                                 \n9  Broadly  in  line  with  the  recent  spread  between  comparable  government  dollar  bonds  and  the  United  States \n\nTreasury bill during normal periods. \n\n10  ADB.2008. The Asian Development Bank\u2019s Long-Term Capital Adequacy Framework. Manila.   \n\n \n\n\f \n8\n\n \n\nImplementation Arrangements and Monitoring \n\nthe facility and the other contingent financing support provided by development partners will not \nbe  withdrawn.  However,  the  package  adds  to  market  confidence  since  the  availability  of \nprecautionary  financing  in  case  of  significant  market  turbulence  will  provide  a  strong  positive \nsignal to the market. \n \n25. \nThe  government  will  access  the  facility  only  under  the  crisis  scenario.  The  financing \nplan,  issued  as  a  Directorate  General  of  Debt  Management  (DGDM)  Decree  No.  21/PU/2012 \nissued in April 2012, sets out: (i) the government\u2019s financing targets for fiscal year 2012, (ii) the \nterms and circumstances under which the government will drawdown the facility and the related \nsupport from other development partners to meet its financing shortfall, and (iii) the terms under \nwhich the financing plan may be rolled over and reissued for fiscal year 2013. The government \nand  development  partners  will  constantly  review \nthese  parameters  using  governance \narrangements  in  the  financing  plan  that  allow  the  government  and  development  partners  to \nassess whether disbursement from the loans is required in line with the government\u2019s financing \nplan.  \n \nG. \n \n26. \nThe  DGDM  will  be  the  executing  agency  to  coordinate,  monitor,  and  evaluate  the \nimplementation  of  the  financing  plan  and  the  government\u2019s  countercyclical  fiscal  stimulus \nprograms  supported  by  the  loan.  DGDM  will  convene  a  quarterly  meeting  attended  by \nrepresentatives from the government and development partners to oversee the implementation \nof the financing plan. The monitoring of the fiscal stimulus programs will utilize the government \nsystem.  For  example,  for  infrastructure  spending,  the  government  has  also  assigned  the \nPresident\u2019s Delivery Unit for Development Monitoring and Oversight to monitor and coordinate \nits implementation. The government and development partners will meet each quarter to review \n(i)  macroeconomic  conditions,  (ii) implementation  of  the  financing  plan,  (iii)  the  government\u2019s \ncountercyclical programs, and (iv) the government\u2019s financing shortfall. The coverage period for \nthe facility is from 1 July 2012 to 31 December 2013. The loan of $500 million is to be disbursed \nwhen  the  government  (i)  has  met  the  drawdown  criteria  set  out  in  the  government\u2019s  financing \nplan; and (ii) maintain sound macroeconomic management.11 The proceeds of the loan will be \ndisbursed  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement \nProcedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.12 \n \n27. \nUnder the financing plan, drawdown of the facility would be linked to Indonesia\u2019s access \nto  market  financing  and  will  only  occur  if  (a) the  financing  target  has  not  been  met  and  (b) \ngovernment bond yields are above a predetermined level. The financing plan reflects that, if a \ndrawdown  is  warranted  as  described  above,  the  government  will  request  support  from \ndevelopment partners to meet its financing needs. The loan proceeds will be used to finance the \ncost  (excluding  local  taxes  and  duties)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member \ncountries, excluding ineligible items.13 The full amount of the loan is not required at once. The \ngovernment has articulated a phased drawdown structure in line with its financing targets in its \nfinancing  plan.  Disbursement  would  be  made  once  every  quarter  and  only  if  the  specified \nfinancing target has not been met given the specified thresholds for interest rates. \n \n\n                                                 \n11 Should adverse external shocks lead to an actual balance-of-payment crisis due to sustained capital outflows, the \nPFF  loan  would  not  be  drawn  down.  Under  this  scenario,  Indonesia  would  most  likely  seek  access  to  a  larger \nmacroeconomic package from other regional and international institutions in order to help support macroeconomic \nstability. \n\n12 ADB. 1998.

Since the enactment of the laws on State Finance, on State \nTreasury, and on State Audit in 2003\u20132004, most of the regulations underpinning the laws have \nbeen promulgated. Initial findings from the 2011 public expenditure and financial accountability \nrepeat assessment show a marked improvement in budget controls and reporting. In 2009, the \ngovernment achieved its first qualified audit opinion from the External Audit Agency, with around \n40%  of  ministries  and  agencies  achieving  unqualified  opinions.  ADB  is  building  on  this \nmomentum  with  continuing  support  to  improve  technical  capacity  and  controls.  Building  on \nprevious  programs,  ADB  technical  assistance  for  Strengthening  National  Public  Procurement \nProcesses 14  has  been  committed  to  improve  the  transparency  and  efficiency  in  public \nprocurement processes. With the government\u2019s continuing commitment to reducing corruption, \nthe Transparency International\u2019s corruption perception index for Indonesia has improved to 3.0 \nin 2011, from 2.8 in 2010.15 \n \nB. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nThe  facility  supports  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to  sustain  critical  public  expenditures  on \n29. \ninfrastructure,  and  poverty  alleviation  and  social  protection.  In  addition,  the  countercyclical \nsupport  includes  a  component  to  accelerate  budget  execution  for  infrastructure  development, \nwhich will have a positive impact on the poor, since the government would then be able to more \neffectively  use  fiscal  policy  to  stimulate  demand  and  therefore  dampen  the  negative  impact  of \nany external shocks. The facility will also support the government\u2019s crisis response program to \nhelp  the  poor  and  vulnerable  during  a  crisis  by  improving  monitoring,  data  collection,  and  the \ntargeting system. These actions are also expected to improve the ability of the government to \nput in place an emergency assistance plan to assist the poor in a relatively short time.16 \n \nC. \n\nSafeguards \n\nThe  program  does  not  trigger  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies  and  is  categorized  C  for \n30. \nenvironment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.

In  addition,  the  facility  also  assumes  that  macroeconomic  stability  will  be  maintained \ndespite increasing global economic uncertainties. \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n14 ADB.  2010.

With increasing reliance on  market financing, \ngovernment  finances  have  been  more  vulnerable  to  the  deteriorating  external  market \nconditions  and  increased  market  volatility.  The  economy  has  been  affected  by  declining \nexport  growth  since  the  last  quarter  of  2011.  Although  the  economy  is  still  resilient,  the \ndownside  risks  to  growth  have  increased  significantly.  With  an  uncertain  and  potentially \nweaker  external  environment,  there  is  a  compelling  need  to  stimulate  domestic  demand  in \norder to continue the current pace of poverty reduction.  \nEconomic  growth  accelerated  further  despite  weakening  external  demand  from  the \ndeteriorating sovereign debt situation. GDP growth edged up to 6.5% year-on-year in 2011, \nfrom  6.2%  in  2010  supported  by  sustained  private  consumption  and  stronger  investment. \nExport  slowdown  in  Q4  was  compensated  by  increased  government\u2019s  spending  to  prevent \ngrowth  from  declining.  However,  the  downside  risks  for  future  growth  have  increased \nsignificantly through weakening export growth. \nExport growth declined to 5.1% (year-on-year) Q1 2012 from 30.8% in Q1 2011. Investment \nrecorded a negative growth of 2.2% in Q4 2011. \nRemittances declined by 6.4% from $1.2 billion in Q4 2010 to $1.1 billion in Q4 2011. \nTo accommodate the fiscal stimulus, the Government increased the budget deficit from 1.2% \nof GDP in 2011 to 1.5% in the 2012 Budget. The Parliament passed a revised 2012 budget \nwith a larger deficit of 2.2% in March 2012. \nTax revenue collection  was up by 0.7% of GDP in 2011, largely due to the efforts to widen \nthe tax net and improve tax administration.  \nNon-residents  sold  a  large  amount  of  government  rupiah  securities  ($4.1  billion)  in \nSeptember  and  October  2011.  Yields  of  government\u2019s  5-year  government  bond  surged  by \nabout 120 bps. Yields have gradually declined since the second week of October 2011 due \nto the government\u2019s bond stabilization programs. \nThe  Government  is  implementing  a  countercyclical  program  that  focuses  on  (i)  increasing \ninfrastructure spending, (ii) improving budget execution, and (iii) scaling up and improving the \ntargeting system of the flagship poverty programs. \nThe  2012  budget  increases  capital  expenditure  by  33.7%  from  the  2011  levels.  The \ninfrastructure spending includes development of airports, ports, mass rapid transport system, \nnew  roads  and  hinterland  connections.  The  Government  is  considering  to  include  in  the \nrevised budget additional infrastructure spending from the 2011 unspent balance.  \nThe Government has scaled up its National Community Empowerment Program (PNPM) for \n2012. In response to the current crisis, the government is establishing of a National Targeting \nSystem  to  ensure  that  program  benefits  more  accurately  reach  poor  and  vulnerable \nhouseholds. \n\nEconomic growth \n\nExports and \ninvestment \nRemittances \nFiscal deficit \n\nTax revenue \ncollection \nImpact on sovereign \nbond yields \n\nIncreased \ninfrastructure \nspending \n\nSocial assistance \nprograms \n\n\fINO-PFF  Access \nCriteria \nC. Sound \nMacroeconomic \nManagement \n\n \n\nIndicators \n\nADB Staff Assessment \n\nThe  Government  has  maintained  sound  macroeconomic  management  and  introduced  swift \nmeasures  to  mitigate  the  impact  of  the  eurozone  crisis  and  the  global  economic  slowdown. \nThis involved taking a number of preemptive measures aimed at maintaining the stability of \nthe domestic bond market and introducing macroprudential measures to manage speculative \ncapital  inflows  The  Government  also  maintains  flexibility  in  the  2012 budget  to  facilitate  the \nneed to stimulate domestic demand while easing monetary policy appropriately to respond to \nweakening growth prospects. \nAfter  the  inflation  downward  trend  firmed  up  in  the  second  half  of  2011,  Bank  Indonesia \nstarted an easing cycle in October 2011 by cutting its policy rate by 100bps through February \n2012. The cuts  were also taken to frontload some adjustment measures in response to the \nexpected  global  economic  slowdown.  Year-on-year  inflation  declined  to  3.8%  in  December \n2011.  The  deceleration  trend  was  reversed  in  March  and  the  year-on-year  inflation  rate \nedged up to 4.5% in April.  \nThe  Government  introduced  the  Bond  Stabilization  Framework  (BSF).  The  BSF  includes  a \nnumber of actions to stabilize the domestic bond market in the event of market turbulence by \nbuying  back  in  the  secondary  market  using:  funds  from  the  state  budget;  fund-pooling  by \nstate-owned enterprises; accumulated budget surplus, and internal reserves accumulated by \nBank  Indonesia.  Under  the  BSF,  the  Government,  in  coordination  with  Bank  Indonesia, \nbought back a significant amount of government bonds in the secondary market to stabilize \nbond  yields.  Bank  Indonesia  also  implemented  a  number  of  macroprudential  measures  to \nreduce short-term and speculative capital inflows and mitigate the risks of sudden reversals. \nPublic  debt  is  sustainable.  Indonesia\u2019s  debt-to-GDP  ratio  has  fallen  steadily  in  the  last \ndecade,  including  against  the  backdrop  of  the  2008-09  global  financial  crisis.  The \ncountercyclical spending program is not expected to adversely affect debt sustainability as a \nlarge proportion of the 2012 budget stimulus is devoted to additional infrastructure spending, \nwhich will improve the capacity to of the economy to grow higher in the medium term. Even \nwith a shock of a 10% increase in government debt liability in 2012, the debt ratio is projected \nto return to the current level by 2016. \nThe  Government  has  an  aggressive  PFM  reform  program  supported  by  a  number  of \ndevelopment partners including through ADB\u2019s earlier Development Policy Support Program \nseries. Key reforms include strengthening the budgetary process, budget transparency, and \ncivil service reforms.  \nThe external balance position is strong. Gross international reserves at the end of April 2012 \nwere $116.4 billion, sufficient for 6.4 months of imports and servicing of official external debt. \n\nMonetary policy and \ninflation \n\nAdjustment policy \nmeasures to address \nthe financial crisis \n\nDebt sustainability \nanalysis \n\nPublic financial \nmanagement \nsystems \n\nExternal balance \n\nBSF bond stabilization framework, INO-PFF = precautionary financing facility, GDP = gross domestic product, PFM = public financial management, \nPNPM = National Community Empowerment Program. \nSource: Bank Indonesia, World Bank, and Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n4\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1\n9\n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 25 May 2012) \n \n \n", "Currency unit\n", "rupiah (Rp) \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "Rp1.00\n$1.00\n", "$ 0.00011     \nRp9,310 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n", " \n \n", "ADB \nbps \nCSF \nDGDM \nFDI \nGDP \nLIBOR \nMP3EI \n", "basis points \ncountercyclical support facility \n", "\u2013  Asian Development Bank \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Directorate general of debt management \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Masterplan Percepatan dan Perluasan Pembangunan \nEkonomi Indonesia (Master Plan for Acceleration and \nExpansion of Indonesia\u2019s Economic Development) \n", "foreign direct investment  \ngross domestic product \nLondon interbank offered rate \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n", "(ii) \n", "The  fiscal  year  (FY)  of  the  Government  of  Indonesia  and  its  agencies  ends  on \n31 December. \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", "Vice-President \nDirector General \nCountry Director \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n \n \n \nPeer reviewer \n", "S.
