No adverse environmental impact was identified. \nAssessment \n   \nProgram Rationale  Pakistan  continues  to  face  a  range  of  macroeconomic  challenges. \nWhile the food and fuel price shocks of late 2007 and early 2008 have \nlargely dissipated, the economy is likely to be on a slow growth path \nfor the next 2 years at least, because of the general global slowdown. \nReal gross domestic product (GDP) growth declined to 5.8% in fiscal \nyear (FY) 2008, after averaging at 7% over the 5 years. It is projected \nto decline to 2.5% in FY2009.  \n \nOn 30 September 2008, ADB\u2019s Board approved the AETP program \ncluster  framework  and  two  loans  totaling  $500  million  for  the  first \nsubprogram  ($200  million  ADF  and  $300  million  OCR)  (AETP1). \nAETP1 supported credible measures to (i) cushion the poorest through \nsocial safety nets; (ii) move toward market-based wheat pricing; (iii) \nresolve the long-term circular debt burden in the power sector; (iv) \nimprove risk management in the financial sector; and (v) launch work \non medium-term economic transformation.     \n \nIn parallel to AETP1 preparation, the Government sought advice from \nthe International Monetary Fund (IMF) on policy measures to restore \nmacroeconomic  stability.  Subsequently,  IMF\u2019s  standby  arrangement \n(SBA) to Pakistan was approved on 24 November 2008 in the amount \nof $7.6 billion equivalent and $3.1 billion was disbursed. On 30 March \n2009, the IMF concluded its first review of the SBA and disbursed \n$847 million. On 26 March 2009, the World Bank approved the $500 \nmillion Poverty Reduction and Economic Stabilization Operation. On \n17 April, the Friends of Democratic Pakistan pledged $5.3 billion in \nsupport of reforms and investments.  \n ", "ii   \n \nThe  proposed  second  AETP  subprogram  (AETP2)  will  help  the \nGovernment complete short-term stabilization measures. In parallel, \nADB will support Pakistan in taking steps for medium-term economic \ntransformation.  Future  AETP  subprograms  will  focus  on \nimplementation, and they will put into effect public\u2013private dialogue \nmechanisms to transform the economic structure gradually. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The AETP will help Pakistan achieve and sustain higher economic \ngrowth  in  the  medium  term.  The  expected  outcome  of  AETP2  is \nimproved  prospects  for  macroeconomic  stability  and  fiscal \nsustainability  through  (i) reducing  short-term  distortions  in  the \nagriculture and energy sectors while improving the social safety net for \nthe poor and vulnerable, and (ii) strengthening financial intermediation. \n   \nSpecial Features  AETP2  is  an  integral  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  macroeconomic \nstabilization program. ADB has participated in IMF missions, at the \nGovernment\u2019s  invitation  and  with  IMF\u2019s  consent,  to  ensure  close \ncoordination on the reform agenda.  \n \nAETP2  supports  the  empowerment  of  women  under  the  Benazir \nIncome  Support  Program  (BISP).  The  amount  of  $150  million  of \nAETP2 will go to the BISP, whose primary recipients are female heads \nof the family so that women of poor families can directly access and \nmanage the social safety net benefits. AETP2 also will help women to \nobtain national identification cards, a precondition to receiving BISP \nbenefits. The national identification card provides women with a legal \nidentity and will enable them to play a greater role in society.   \n   \nCoordination with  ADB  continues  to  be  a  lead  development  partner  in  Pakistan  and \nDevelopment  works closely with the IMF, the World Bank, and other development \nPartners  partners on macroeconomic stabilization measures and other AETP \nreforms. Thus, the AETP2 agenda is well grounded in ongoing policy \nsupport from ADB and other partners, and regular dialogue with them.  \n   \nPeriod and  (i)  AETP2 is the second subprogram under a program cluster of \nTranching  up to four single-tranche subprograms.  \n(ii)  AETP1 (covering reforms from June 2007 to September 2008) \naddressed  the  food  and  energy  crisis,  supported  short-term \ninvestment  climate  measures,  and  launched  studies  on \nmedium-term structural transformation. This subprogram was \napproved by the Board on 30 September 2008.  \n(iii)  AETP2 supports measures taken during October 2008 to June \n2009 on short-term social safety net, electricity debt resolution, \nand risk management in the financial sector. Moreover, the \nGovernment\u2014given  its  present  focus  on  short-term  crisis \nmanagement\u2014needs more time before reform steps can be \nagreed for structural transformation. \n(iv)  Future  subprograms  will  focus  on  structural  transformation, \nbased  on  work  underway  since  mid-2008.  The  decision  to \nproceed is subject to resource needs, and reform commitment \n ", "  iii\nand progress. It is likely that two more subprograms may be \nneeded to institutionalize effective public\u2013private partnerships \nfor economic transformation. \n   \nFinancing Plan  The proposed loans for AETP2 are:   \n(i)  A loan of $350 million from ADB\u2019s OCR under the London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan \nwill have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an \ninterest  rate  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% \nper annum; and such other terms and conditions as set forth in \nthe draft loan agreement.  \n(ii)  A loan of $150 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s ADF, with an \ninterest rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 24 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \nTo retain the reform momentum and predictability of financing, the \nGovernment has requested that AETP3 be processed in December \n2009 for possible approval in the second quarter of 2010. Subject to \nreform progress and financing requirements, subsequent subprograms \ncould each be in the range of $400 million\u2013$500 million, putting the \nAETP  program  cluster\u2019s  aggregate  in  the  range  of  $1.8  billion\u2013\n$2 billion.  The  scope  and  amounts  for  each  subprogram  will  be \nfinalized  during  the  review  and  processing  of  the  respective \nsubprogram. \n   \nCounterpart Funds  The Government will ensure that the local currency generated from the \nproceeds of the OCR loan will be used first to support the adjustment \ncosts of reforms to be initiated and implemented under AETP2, and \nsecond  to  finance  expenditures  for  the  Government\u2019s  general \ndevelopment  purposes.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  local \ncurrency generated from the proceeds of the ADF loan will be used to \nsupport poor and vulnerable families that qualify via the new targeting \nscorecard method under the BISP set forth in output 1 of AETP2. \n   \nExecuting Agency  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for \nAETP2. \n \nImplementation  MOF will coordinate with the relevant ministries and agencies on the \nArrangements  AETP2 reforms, and it will help ensure that the reform agenda stays on \ncourse. In coordination with MOF, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) \nwill handle implementation of actions relating to the financial sector. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  other  regulatory  agencies  or \nministries are consulted as required. ADB will closely monitor program \nimplementation to ensure that envisaged outputs and outcomes are \nachieved. \n   \n   \nProcurement and  Loan proceeds will be used to pay for items procured in ADB member \n ", "iv   \nDisbursement   countries, other than the items specified in the negative list of ineligible \nitems and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. \nThe proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed in accordance with \nthe  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  simplified  disbursement  procedures  and \nrelated  requirements  for  program  loans.  Loan  proceeds  disbursed \nagainst  imports  will  require  a  certificate  from  the  Government \nstipulating that the value of Pakistan\u2019s total imports, minus its imports \nfrom nonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed \nunder other official development assistance, is equal to or greater than \nthe amount of the loan expected to be disbursed during a particular \nyear. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of loan proceeds to verify \nthe accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n   \nProgram Benefits  AETP2 will provide the following benefits: \nand Beneficiaries   \n(i)  Assist the Government to meet the large and immediate fiscal \nneeds.  \n(ii)  Help the Government to transition from the current system of \ninefficient and untargeted subsidies toward a targeted safety \nnet program for the poor, with a focus on women. The new \nfederal social safety net program, the BISP, is expanding its \ncoverage  from  3.5  million  families  in  FY2009  to  5  million \nfamilies in FY2010 and aims to target up to 7 million families by \nFY2011. Benefits are paid to female heads of families. \n(iii)  Raise  public  confidence  in  the  banking  system  by \nstrengthening regulation and supervision of the sector. \n(iv)  Open the way for structural transformation. \n(v)  Enable ADB to sustain policy dialogue on structural reforms in \nsectors where ADB has been actively involved through past \nand current investments.  \n   \nRisks and  While some of the risks to AETP2 are political and outside its scope, \nAssumptions  its design will mitigate a range of others, including the following: \n  \n(i)  Interest  group  resistance  and  poor  intergovernment \ncoordination.  Those  adversely  affected  by  reforms  in  the \nshort-term are likely to resist. The Government has improved \ninter\u2013ministerial  and  agency  coordination  and  information-\nsharing to communicate reform measures more effectively than \nin the past. Further, the single tranche structure of the AETP \nsubprograms ensures prior actions by the Government before \nfinancing  is  provided,  and  engagement  through  a  program \ncluster ensures sustainability of such actions.   \n(ii)  Weak capacity. This is a generic concern which is elevated in \nthe case of complex reforms. Technical assistance is helping to \naddress this concern over the shorter term. Moreover, there is \nstrong ownership for reforms since the agenda under the AETP \nis also largely home-grown.  \n(iii)  Weak  fiduciary  controls. With large amounts of safety net \nneeds and assistance, it is vital to design and execute the BISP \nin a fully transparent and accountable manner. The World Bank \n ", "  v\nis  providing  a  dedicated  project,  backed  up  by  financing \nsupport; and ADB has worked closely with the Government and \nWorld Bank, particularly to strengthen financial management \nsystems.  \n(iv)  Global financial crisis. AETP measures are predicated on a \nglobal  recovery.  While  the  program  cannot  influence  global \nevents,  it  can  help  cushion  Pakistan  against  exogenous \nshocks.  \n \nAt  the  same  time,  the  risks  associated  with  not  supporting \nmacroeconomic  stability,  fiscal  sustainability,  and  Pakistan\u2019s  social \nsafety net programs are very high. In the absence of timely reforms, \nthe Government\u2019s budget would be continually burdened by costly and \ninefficient  subsidies,  leaving  far  less  resources  for  development \nfinancing. The financial sector would be vulnerable to systemic risks. \nHigh  and  persistent  macroeconomic  imbalances  would  constrain \ninvestments and economic growth while aggravating poverty. \n \nThe underlying assumptions for AETP2 include \n   \n(i)  strong and sustained leadership and commitment to reforms,  \n(ii)  development partner coordination, and \n(iii)  open  dialogue  with  the  private  sector  and  other  key \nstakeholders. \n   \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on two proposed \nloans  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  second  subprogram  of  the  Accelerating \nEconomic Transformation Program (AETP).1  \n \nII.  BACKGROUND \n2.  Pakistan\u2019s  economy  suffered  serious  shocks  in  2007\u20132008  due  to  skyrocketing \ninternational prices for oil and food. The severity of the exogenous shocks, aggravated by \nuncertainties surrounding the political transition in much of 2008, was felt on several fronts. \nOverall domestic inflation rose sharply to a year-on-year rate of 21.5% in June 2008 from 7% in \nJune 2007. External accounts deteriorated, with the current account deficit widening to 8.3% of \ngross domestic product (GDP) from 4.8%. The Pakistan rupee depreciated, and gross foreign \nexchange reserves declined by more than 40% to $8.6 billion (about 2.7 months of imports) by \nJune 2008. On the fiscal front, there were unprecedented needs for fuel, food, and electricity \nsubsidies, which rose fourfold to PRs408 billion ($6 billion) from their originally budgeted level. \nSymptomatic of declining investor confidence, the Karachi stock index dropped by more than \n35% during April\u2013July 2008, and the international perception of the possibility of sovereign \ndefault dramatically increased as evidenced by the yield for 10-year sovereign bonds which rose \nfrom less than 10% per annum at the beginning of 2008 to more than 25% per annum in \nOctober 2008. The outcome was a decline in real GDP growth to 4.1% in FY2008 from 6.8% for \nthe previous year, with signs of a much steeper decline during the current fiscal year. \n \n3.  Against  this  backdrop,  the  Government  requested  ADB  and  other  international \ndevelopment partners to provide exceptional financial assistance. The Government and ADB \ndesigned the AETP to mitigate the adverse short-term impact of the spiraling food and fuel \nprices while helping Pakistan to address some of the more fundamental challenges constraining \nfaster growth. The Government developed a four-point stabilization plan2 which later formed the \nbasis of a standby arrangement (SBA) with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that was \napproved  in  November  2008.  During  July\u2013September  2008,  ADB  undertook  extensive \nconsultations with the IMF, the World Bank, and other key bilateral partners to formulate the \nreform measures as well as to determine the budget support. Through an advisory mission \nlaunched at the Government\u2019s request, an IMF team worked out various funding scenarios \nduring August\u2013September 2008. It found that Pakistan needed exceptional financing support to \nshore up its international reserves; restore macroeconomic stability; and ensure essential social, \nnondiscretionary,  and  critical  development  expenditures.  The  reforms  initiated  through  the \nAETP in 2008 and the budget support aim to \n  \n(i)  expand and deepen social safety nets for the poor,  \n(ii)  remove wheat pricing and procurement distortions,  \n(iii)  bring power tariffs in line with costs and settle long-standing accumulated debt \nin the power sector, given the overhang of inter-corporate receivables at $5 \nbillion (2.9% of GDP),   \n(iv)  improve risk management in the financial sector, and \n(v)  diversify Pakistan\u2019s economy to increase the relative size of the industrial \nsector while boosting exports and creating jobs.  \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on the Proposed Program \nCluster and Loans for Subprogram 1 to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan Accelerating Economic Transformation \nProgram. Manila (September). See also Box 1). \n ", "2   \n4.  Following  approval  by  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  for  the  first  subprogram  of  AETP \n(AETP1) on 30 September 2008, $500 million was disbursed on the same day to meet urgent \nrequirements and enable the Government to fulfill one of the key conditions in the stabilization \nplan  of  reducing  borrowing  from  the  State  Bank  of  Pakistan  (SBP).  The  local  currency \ngenerated from the proceeds of the AETP1 loans financed, among other things, key social \nsafety  net  programs  to  cushion  the  impact  of  the  food  and  fuel  crisis  on  the  poor.  More \ngenerally, the AETP is an integral part of the financing plan that has emerged as part of the \nagreement  between  the  Government  and  the  IMF.  It  was  designed  as  a  program  cluster \ncomprising up to four subprograms that support short- and medium-term reforms. The proposed \nAETP2 carries forward the reforms initiated last year in a seamless manner, and it will provide \n$500 million in budget support to enable Pakistan to meet its urgent social and developmental \nneeds in FY2009.  \n \n5.  IMF\u2019s 23-month SBA was approved in November 2008 for $7.6 billion equivalent, and \n$3.1 billion was disbursed immediately to shore up Pakistan\u2019s foreign exchange reserves. The \nSBA aims to restore macroeconomic stability and confidence while achieving social stability and \nadequate  support  for  the  poor.  ADB  has  been  closely  involved  in  the  IMF  dialogue  and \nmonitoring and has participated in the review process. On 30 March 2009, the IMF completed \nthe first review of Pakistan\u2019s economic performance under the SBA. An amount equivalent to \nSDR568.5  million  (about  $847  million)  was  subsequently  disbursed,  bringing  total  SBA \ndisbursements  to  date  to  an  amount  equivalent  to  SDR 2.64  billion  (about  $3.95  billion). \nPending completion of the second review of the SBA, and following the submission of the \n2009/10 budget to the Parliament, the IMF will release the next tranche under the SBA. \n  \nTable 1: IMF Program Structural Performance Criteria, Status as of April 2009 \nTargets and Conditions  Status \n1.

On 26 March 2009, the World Bank approved the Poverty Reduction and Economic \nStabilization Operation  in the amount of $500 million through an interest-free International \nDevelopment  Association  credit.  This  operation  complements  the  short-term  policy  reform \nagenda initiated under AETP1 and provides budget support to the social safety net and for \nmeeting other needs. \n \nIII.  MACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PROSPECTS \nA.  Overview3   \n7.  Real GDP growth dropped to 4.1% in FY2008 after 5 years of averaging near 7%. \nSignificant factors constraining growth have been a sharp decline in the growth of private \ninvestment due to political uncertainty, a worsening security situation, and the impacts of high \ninternational oil prices and frequent power shortages. The contribution of investment to growth \nfell to just 0.7 percentage points in FY2008 compared to 2.7 percentage points in the preceding \nfiscal year. The contribution of net exports to growth turned negative, especially due to the oil \nprice  hike  and  continued  slowdown  in  textile  exports,  and  the  manufacturing  sector\u2019s \ncontribution is expected to turn negative for the current fiscal year. \n \n8.  When combined with the failure to align domestic prices with international prices, the oil \nprice shock and high wheat import price led to a massive buildup of unbudgeted and untargeted \nsubsidies and resulted in a fiscal deficit for FY2008 of 7.6% of GDP\u2014the highest in 9 years. \nAlso, interest payments on Defense Savings Certificates, which were issued in the 1990s with \nhigh interest rates, steeply increased interest costs and contributed to the larger deficit. In the \nabsence of additional foreign inflows (e.g., investments and remittances), the deficit had to be \nfinanced  mainly  through  domestic  borrowing  from  the  SBP.  Development  spending  was \ncompressed  relative  to  that  planned  in  the  budget  to  offset  some  of  the  impact  from  the \nuntargeted subsidies. The tax-to-GDP ratio came in at 10.6%, more than half a percentage point \nlower than projected in the budget.  \n \n9.  Subsidies on oil, food, fertilizer, and power contributed to the budget deficit but failed to \ncontain inflation as food prices soared and the price of fuel was adjusted upward in the last 4 \nmonths of FY2008. Steep rupee depreciation stoked inflationary pressures as did financing of \nthe expanding deficit through borrowing from the SBP. The consumer price index on a year-on-\nyear basis climbed to 21.5% in June 2008 and to 25.3% in August, which was the highest in 30 \nyears. Core inflation also increased. As food prices rose sharply (by 32% in June 2008 year-on-\nyear), the poorest groups in society were hardest hit. With declining international commodity \nprices and a slowing domestic economy, the year-on-year consumer price index fell to 20.5% \nand food inflation to 21.6% in January 2009. Domestic inflation would have fallen by more had \nthe rupee not depreciated by 15.9% against the dollar in the first 7 months of FY2009. \n \n10.  Reacting  to  the  rising  inflation  and  the  sharp  increase  in  imports,  SBP  tightened \nmonetary policy three times in FY2008 for a cumulative rise in its discount rate of 250 basis \npoints. That rate climbed by another 300 basis points to 15% (the highest in South Asia) by \nNovember 2008 under the IMF program as inflation persisted, the drain on reserves continued, \nand  the  Government  sought  to  reduce  its  SBP  borrowings  by  making  treasury  bills  more \nattractive  to  commercial  banks.  By  April  2009,  inflation  had  slowed  to  less  than  17.2%, \n                                                 \n3  This section draws from the chapter on Pakistan in ADB. 2009.

See also Appendix 2 \nwhich includes an updated fiscal note.  \n ", "4   \ncompared with the record 25% level in the last quarter of 2008. This enabled the SBP to reduce \nthe discount rate by 100 basis points.  \n \n11.  The fiscal deficit is expected to decline to 4.3% of GDP in FY2009, as the Government \nhas removed or reduced subsidies and rationalized development expenditure. It already has \nfully eliminated the subsidy on petroleum products and is undertaking a phased reduction in the \nelectricity  subsidy,  with  the  target  to  terminate  this  subsidy  by  the  end  of  FY2009.  A \nreprioritization of projects is expected to lead to a slashing of the development budget by over \nPRs100 billion for FY2009. The Government has also frozen supplementary grants to various \ndepartments to infuse greater fiscal discipline. Fiscal performance for June 2008\u2013March 2009 \nsuggests that the annual target is achievable. While the slowdown in economic activity in \nresponse to the global financial crisis has reduced revenue growth below earlier projections, \nreflecting  in  part  lower  sales  tax  revenues  with  the  decline  in  imports,  revenue  from  the \npetroleum development levy and compressed expenditures will hold the deficit to the targeted \n4.3% for FY2009.  \n \n12.  Growth  is  expected  to  slow  to  2.0%  in  FY2009  due  to  the  global  slowdown,  the \nGovernment\u2019s tight demand management policies, and infrastructure deficits. GDP growth could \nrise  to  about  3.0%  in  FY2010.  But  there  are  considerable  downside  risks,  including  the \nworsening security situation.

The banking system remains relatively well capitalized, but gross nonperforming loans \nhave increased from 7% in 2007 to about 9.1% of all loans and banks\u2019 profitability has declined \nby about 24% from the previous year (reflecting in part the mounting provisioning requirements \nin response to the rise in nonperforming loans). Domestic pressures and the global financial \ncrisis  have  led  to  greater  dollarization  and  a  continued  outflow  from  the  system,  which \ncontributes to deteriorating liquidity conditions. In response to liquidity pressures, in October \n2008 the SBP reduced the reserve requirement by 4 percentage points and eased liquidity \nrequirements. To ease the strains on banks and other deposit institutions, the SBP slowed a \nmandated rise in paid-in capital for 2013 from a planned PRs23 billion to PRs10 billion (with an \nannual  increase  of  PRs1  billion  per  year  from  2009  through  2013).  The  capital  adequacy \nrequirement of 10% has not been affected.  \n \n14.  The crisis had a major impact on financial markets, with the Karachi stock index plunging \nby 57% in 2008. To halt the steep decline, the Karachi Stock Exchange Board imposed a floor \non stock prices in August 2008. This was eliminated in December. To revive the market after the \nfloor  was  lifted,  the  National  Investment  Trust  (the  government-owned  and  largest  money \nmanager in Pakistan) invested about PRs7 billion into the PRs20 billion State Enterprise Fund, \nwhich is investing in the stock market. The market subsequently rallied and has bounced back \nto precrisis levels. Increased confidence and improved terms of trade have helped stabilize the \nrupee at around PRs80 to the dollar since October 2008 and enabled the SBP to rebuild its \ngross international reserves. \n \nB.  The Government\u2019s Policy Response to the Challenges \n \n15.  Immediate Priorities and Challenges. Macroeconomic stabilization is critical, as fiscal \npolicies\u2014particularly regarding subsidies\u2014have left scant resources for countercyclical fiscal \nmeasures to address the downturn. Under the IMF program, the Government will address the \nissues  that  undermine  flexibility  and  macroeconomic  stability.  The  budget  deficit  target  for \nFY2009 (4.3% of GDP) is sharply lower than the 7.4% deficit realized for FY2008 but remains \n ", "6   \nabove the 4% mandated under Pakistan\u2019s Fiscal Responsibility Act (2005). The initial target for \nFY2010 of 3.4% was well within the authorized range, but it may be raised to accommodate \nincreased external support in the wake of rising requirements for social spending and displaced \npersons.  In  this  context,  policy  measures  will  focus  on  creating  fiscal  space  by  reducing \nsubsidies, increasing revenues, and, at the same time, strengthening the social safety net. \nThere are four key challenges. First, untargeted subsidies are the main threat to fiscal instability: \nin FY2008, untargeted subsidies for power, oil, wheat, and fertilizer expanded to nearly four \ntimes their budgeted amounts (about 3.9% of GDP versus 1.1%). Second, Pakistan\u2019s interest \npayments are high by historic standards and are expected to remain at 4%\u20135% of GDP through \nFY2011. Third, Pakistan\u2019s tax revenues have consistently been among the lowest in the region \nat about 10% of GDP. Finally, development expenditures rose from about 2.7% of GDP in \nFY2003 to nearly 5% of GDP by FY2007. Sustaining this trend will require resources that \nPakistan does not have, reflecting capital inflows that are no longer available.   \n \n16.  FY2009 Federal Budget. Despite the continued global financial turmoil and attendant \nslowdown in economic activity, the Government aims for a much smaller budget deficit. About \n2.5 percentage points of the decrease are to come from lower expenditures, with the reduction \nin subsidies contributing to an overall expected decrease in fiscal spending equivalent to about \n1.6%  of  GDP.  The  Government  eliminated  the  oil  subsidy  by  December  2008  and  has \ncommitted  to  monthly  adjustments  to  pass  along  the  benefits  of  the  oil  price  decline  to \nconsumers. The differential power subsidy has been reduced and will be eliminated by the end \nof  the  current  fiscal  year.  In  addition,  a  freeze  on  non-salary  spending  was  imposed  in \ngovernment departments to curtail current expenditures.  \n \n17.  Maintaining public sector development spending at the FY2008 nominal level amounts to \na reduction from about 4.3% of GDP in FY2008 to just over 3% of GDP for FY2009. The \nremaining 1.8% of the decrease in the deficit for FY2009 reflects near-term measures to boost \nrevenues, including administrative measures, higher general sales tax, and increased luxury \nimport taxes. While tax revenues posted a considerable increase for the first half of FY2009, this \nreflected  in  part  the  contribution  of  the  petroleum  development  levy,  offsetting  lower  than \nexpected  direct  and  indirect  tax  receipts.  The  stabilization  targets  announced  by  the \nGovernment in the budget and the planned reduction in the fiscal and current account deficits \nare important to reinforce sustainable growth. There are risks, however, that continued global \neconomic and financial crisis will impact on economic activity and revenue flows.  \n \n18.  FY2010 budget targets include allowing the deficit to move to 4.6% of GDP, reflecting \nincreased external support, particularly for safety net provisions for the internally displaced \npersons. Further spending compression is limited, as lower current spending from the full-year \nelimination of subsidies may be offset by the need to increase public sector development \nspending.  Revenues  are  expected  to  remain  broadly  unchanged  as  a  share  of  GDP  as \nimprovements in revenue policy and administration largely offset the impact of sustained slow \nreal growth. This is supported by additional administrative measures, including reduced tax \nexemptions.  \n \n19.  Medium-Term Context. Pakistan\u2019s strategic priorities are set out in Vision 2030,4 which \nidentifies  the  need  for  structural  change  and  transformation  to  achieve  a  developed, \nindustrialized, just, and prosperous Pakistan. The second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper5 \nincludes the development of an internationally competitive industrial base as a key strategic \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy (2009\u20132013):  Pakistan. Manila. \n5  Government of Pakistan. 2009. Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper II. Islamabad.  \n ", "  7\npillar. Over the short term, structural transformation requires sound fiscal policy with removal of \neconomic distortions while providing an adequate social safety net for the poor and vulnerable, \nas well as efficient financial intermediation. These objectives are the focus of AETP2, which will \nhelp create the necessary preconditions for structural transformation.  \n   \nIV.  THE SECTOR \nA.  Issues and Opportunities6  \n20.  Targeted Safety Net Intervention.  Based  on  the  latest  poverty  assessment  for \nPakistan (FY2006), nearly a quarter of the population remains poor and a significant part of the \npopulation is clustered around the poverty line. The recent global food, fuel, and financial crises \nare expected to increase poverty unless appropriate policy measures are taken to protect poor \nand vulnerable families from these adverse shocks. The BISP was created in October 2008 as \nthe new major social safety net program. It focuses on poor women. The program targeted \ncoverage for up to 3.5 million families during the first year, providing a cash grant of PRs1,000 \nper month to eligible families whose monthly income is less than PRs6,000. Given the spiraling \ninflation and the severity of the crisis, the Government wanted to get the BISP launched quickly. \nFor this, the BISP distributed 8,000 forms to each federal parliamentarian (members of the \nNational Assembly and senators) for distribution to eligible families in their constituencies based \non 13 criteria. Verification of eligibility and payments to eligible families was contracted by BISP \nto existing organizations. The National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) was used \nto verify the eligibility of applicants. Pakistan Post was contracted to deliver benefit payments \nthrough money orders to the homes of verified applicants upon production by the female head \nof the family of her computerized national identity card (CNIC). As of 30 April 2009, 3 million \nbeneficiaries have been identified under the BISP. Of these, 1.8 million have been declared \neligible by NADRA. PRs11 billion in payments have been delivered to eligible families on a \nretroactive basis (from October 2008, the date of BISP establishment). \n \n21.  The separation of the management (BISP), beneficiaries identification (politicians and \npoverty scorecards), and payment benefits delivery (Pakistan Post) functions under the BISP is \nintended to guard against misuse and leakages. In line with program goals, the targeting and \nverification  processes  need  further  review  to  maximize  inclusion  of  the  poor  and  address \ncoverage issues of the CNIC database, as well as to improve the institutional arrangements for \nmanaging  the  program  to  effectively  engage  the  various  tiers  of  the  Government.  AETP1 \nsupported expanding federal cash transfer programs and improved targeting. The World Bank is \nproviding support to the Government to improve social safety net programs, including the BISP.7   \n \n22.  Untargeted Wheat Subsidies and Inefficient Reserve Management. Wheat is the \nfood staple in Pakistan. Given the large population of poor and low-income earners (small-scale \nproducers and consumers), stabilizing the wheat price has been a long-term Government policy \nobjective. It has adopted a number of interventions involving (i) the wheat procurement price, \nwhich is the support price paid to producers, (ii) wheat procurement targets for the Pakistan \n                                                 \n6  This section presents changes in each focus area of AETP since September 2008. Otherwise, the background \nsection presented in the AETP RRP remains relevant.  \n7  Under the Department for International Development Poverty Reduction Trust Fund, the World Bank is providing \nthe Government with a $2.5 million technical assistance (TA) grant to help strengthen the BISP program. It will \nfocus on the new scorecard targeting method. The World Bank recently approved a $60 million TA loan focused on \nbetter coordination of federal programs, preparation of a national social protection strategy, and the design and \nimplementation of programs. In addition, the World Bank is providing program support through its $500 million \nPoverty Reduction and Economic Support Operation and $200 million Social Safety Development Policy Credit.   \n ", "8   \nAgricultural Storage and Supplies Corporation (PASSCO) and the provincial food departments, \nwhich  is  of  particular  importance  to  the  Punjab  province,  which  accounts  for  80%  of  the \ncountry\u2019s production, (iii) a wheat issue price, which is the price used for sale to flour millers \nwhich  is  usually  less  than  the  cost  of  procurement  and  associated  handling  and  storage \ncharges,  and with quota allocations and concessionally priced sales of flour to utility stores, and \n(iv)  import  and  export  controls  depending  on  the  country\u2019s  production  and  domestic \ninterprovincial restrictions on movement until provincial targets are achieved.  \n \n23.  In an average season, Pakistan produces 21 million tons of wheat, of which about 8 \nmillion to 9 million tons enters the market. The Government annually procures around 50% to \n60% of the market amount, ranging from 3.5 million to 4.5 million tons since 2002. Support for \nGovernment interventions in procurement (domestically and through imports by the Trading \nCorporation  of  Pakistan)  and  sale  of  wheat  at  issue  price  to  flour  millers  have  required \nGovernment  subsidies  plus  investments  into  state-owned  storage  facilities,  procurement \ncenters, and utility retail stores. Also needed has been easy access to credit from SBP and \ncommercial banks to provide operating capital for procurement agencies. These measures \ninvolve substantial government subsidies (federal and provincial) to support wheat producers \nand  consumers.  These  interventions,  while  providing  some  price  stability,  have  not  been \nefficient and are not well targeted to reach the intended beneficiaries. The subsidy cost on \nimported wheat (1.7 million tons) in FY2008 is estimated at PRs40 billion and in FY2009 the \nsubsidy on wheat imports (2.5 million to 3 million tons) will likely be at a similar level. In addition, \nsignificant subsidy costs are incurred by the procurement agencies in selling wheat to flour \nmillers at issue prices that do not reflect full cost recovery.  \n \n24.  Under AETP1, to reduce the inefficient subsidies, the Government committed to market-\nbased wheat pricing and an efficient reserve management system that included adoption of a \ntime-bound action plan by the national Economic Coordination Committee (ECC).8 The ECC \nplan includes reforms in the producer procurement price and wheat issue price to flour millers \nthat support a move toward more market-based pricing, a reduction in the scale of procurement \nundertaken  by  Government  agencies  for  within-year  operational  reserves  and  inter-year \nstrategic reserves, and an anticipated expanded private sector role in wheat marketing and \nstorage. The approach adopted was incremental, reflecting the need to maintain price stability \nfor  producers  and  consumers  until  better  targeted  and  more  efficient  safety  net  programs \nbecome fully operational.  \n \n25.  AETP reforms in this area reflect Pakistan\u2019s experiences in the wheat market during \n2007 and 2008, when high and volatile wheat and flour prices caused major food security \nproblems for low-income households and social unrest. While 2008 wheat production was \naverage, the effects of the government procurement policy (and in particular the procurement \nprice) caused a number of distortions. The 2008 procurement price was less than the market \nprice (domestic and export parity price), and during the 2008 season the Government needed to \nraise the procurement price to PRs625 per 40 kilos. To meet market needs, the Government \nimported wheat that was sold at a loss to domestic flour millers and imposed export bans and \ninterprovincial restrictions to achieve targets.   \n \n26.  In September 2008, the Government announced the 2009 wheat procurement price of \nPRs950 per 40 kilos (to be harvested from April 2009). The higher procurement price has had a \npositive impact on production and was based on cost of production and international and \n                                                 \n8  The ECC is a cabinet-level committee of the Government constituted pursuant to Cabinet Notification No. \n5/3/2007-Com dated 2 April 2008. It comprises the Prime Minister, various ministers, and such officers as will be \ninvited (including the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan and governor of the SBP). \n ", "  9\nregional wheat prices as of September 2008.9 In mid-February 2009, the Government held high \nlevel meetings to discuss the 2009 wheat crop, which is forecast at 25 million tons. Based on \ncurrent storage capacity, the announced large procurement target requires establishing and \nusing temporary storage facilities. To support private sector wheat purchase, the Government is \nfacilitating  loan  access  through  commercial  banks  for  flour  millers  (and  this  has  involved \nlowering the borrower required equity in for loans to 10%) on terms that are more favorable than \nin previous years.  \n \n27.  The wheat issue price to flour millers for the 2009 wheat crop will be set in July 2009. \nWhile the issue price is technically set by the provinces, the Government has indicated that the \nwheat issue price will be based on the procurement price and should include all storage and \nhandling costs incurred. Losses incurred from an issue price below the sum of the procurement \nprice and costs (e.g., for interest and storage) are made up from the provincial budget. The new \nprice will impact on flour prices and is expected to result in a 20% to 30% increase.  Appendix 7 \nprovides additional information on wheat marketing reforms. \n \n28.  Challenges in the Power Sector. Pakistan suffers from a chronic shortfall between \nelectricity supply and demand.10 This will continue to seriously limit productivity and economic \ngrowth until the financial deficits, corporate governance, and technical issues in the power \nsector are resolved in a sustainable manner.  \n \n29.  The financial deficit is due to (i) tariffs being inadequate to cover operating costs of \npower distribution companies (DISCOs), let alone depreciation and a fair return on equity; \n(ii) nonpayment  by  government,  subsovereign,  and  private  sector  customers  for  electricity \nconsumed;  and  (iii)  the  excessive  accumulation  of  debt  owed  by  DISCOs  to  the  National \nTransmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC) in its role as Central Power Purchasing Agency \n(CPPA),  NTDC/CPPA  to  public  sector  generating  companies  (GENCOs)  and  independent \npower producers (IPPs), and from these entities ultimately to fuel suppliers and refineries.11 The \naccumulated debt arrears is often referred to as the power sector circular debt problem.  \n \n30.  Between 2003 and 2007 in particular, the Government did not allow power tariffs to rise, \nnotwithstanding  petitions  from  DISCOs  asking  for  tariff  adjustments  to  cover  significantly \nincreased fuel prices and basic operating and maintenance costs as determined by the National \nElectricity Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA).12 This caused (i) the tariff differential owed by \nthe Government to the DISCOs to grow substantially, with the unpaid amount for this year \nestimated at PRs84 billion ($1 billion);13 and (ii) the public sector power sector companies \n(GENCOS, NTDC, and DISCOs) to ultimately borrow PRs216 billion ($2.7 billion) to cover the \ncash shortfall. Further, the amount owed to DISCOs for electricity sold grew and PRs209 billion \n                                                 \n9  In the interim period, international wheat prices have fallen as forecast and on a per ton basis the procurement \nprice is above the world price. \n10 In March 2009, supply totaled 12,074 megawatts (MW), or 82% of peak demand. For June 2009, supply is \nexpected to be 15,225 MW, or 85% of demand. Such shortfalls have caused widespread shedding and associated \ninterruption of industrial and other economic activity. See also Appendix 8 (Updated Energy Sector Briefing Note) \n11 The DISCOs, NTDC, and GENCOs as well as Pakistan Electric Power Company (PEPCO) were formed after the \nunbundling of the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA), and they are owned by the Government. \nIPPs and for the most part the suppliers of fuel to the IPPs and GENCOs are privately owned.   \n12 NEPRA is the independent regulator of the power sector determining cost recovery tariffs that can be charged by \nIPPs and GENCOs for capacity and production of electricity, by NTDC for transmission of electricity to DISCOs and \nother bulk purchasers, and by DISCOs for distributing electricity to customers. The difference between the tariffs \ndetermined by NEPRA and those notified by the Government is referred to as the tariff differential. \n13 For FY2008, PRs35 billion ($0.45 billion) was paid in cash and the actual tariff differential subsidy equaled PRs87 \nbillion ($0.95 billion). For the first 9 months of FY2009, PRs87 billion has been claimed and PRs59 billion has been \npaid.  \n ", "10  \n($2.6 billion). Of this, (i) PRs80 billion ($1 billion) is owed by consumers in the Federally \nAdministered Tribal Areas (FATA), which is unlikely to be recovered and consumers cannot be \ncut off for national reasons; and (ii) PRs80 billion from the privately owned Karachi Electricity \nSupply Company of which PRs31 billion will be borne by Government.  \n \n31.  Inadequate tariffs, nonpayment of the tariff differential subsidy, and nonpayment for \nelectricity consumed are thus the key factors causing overdue receivables owed by DISCOs to \nNTDC/CPPA to reach PRs407 billion ($5 billion)14 and those owed by NTDC/CPPA to GENCOs \nand IPPs to grow to PRS250 billion ($3.1 billion). This caused (i) DISCOs and GENCOs to defer \ncritically needed operating and maintenance expenditures to decrease losses, (ii) GENCOs and \nIPPs to run out of cash needed to purchase fuel for producing electricity at their optimal \ncapacities, and (iii) ultimately to the Government\u2019s taking the first step to resolve the circular \ndebt  problem  by  guaranteeing  the  issuance  by  NTDC  of  PRs92  billion  in  term  financing \ncertificates (TFCs) to convert the short-term trade debt into midterm debt obligations.15  \n \n32.  Limited  Financial  Intermediation.  Strengthening  financial  governance  has  become \nmore urgent as a result of the global financial turmoil, which has led to liquidity constraints in the \nlocal banking system. In Pakistan, there is an additional risk of contagion given interconnected \nand direct lending among banking groups. Because of the Pakistan banking sector\u2019s structure \nand current regulatory architecture, such risks are currently difficult to supervise.  \n \n33.  Pakistan has adopted an institutional approach to regulation and supervision under \nwhich a firm\u2019s legal status (e.g., as a bank, broker-dealer, insurance company) determines \nwhich regulator is tasked with overseeing its activity from a safety, soundness, and business \nconduct perspective. The SBP is responsible for oversight of the banking sector, while the \nSecurities  and  Exchange  Commission  of  Pakistan  (SECP)  is  responsible  for  overseeing \nnonbank finance companies (NBFCs), some of which are engaged in deposit-taking activities. \nOngoing financial sector consolidation has blurred traditional lines of business activity, creating \nsupervisory challenges and increasing systemic risks. Prudential risks are difficult to monitor \nacross different segments of the financial system, which are overseen by different regulators \nhaving different regulatory mandates. In the absence of proper consolidated supervision in \nconformity with Basel Core Principle 24,16 a financial conglomerate, or any of its subsidiaries or \naffiliates, may become vulnerable to double counting of capital, large intra- and extra-group \nexposures, contagion problems among entities within the conglomerate, and conflicts of interest \nbetween business units within the conglomerate. There is also a risk that to avoid scrutiny \nlosses from banks will be transferred to less regulated and supervised NBFCs, including those \ntaking deposits. \n \n34.  One of the emerging lessons arising from the global financial crisis is the difficulty in \nsupervising financial conglomerates where there is more than one financial regulator. While in \nmany countries, including Pakistan, financial sector regulators using the institutional approach to \nsupervision have adopted various coordination mechanisms to try and address supervisory and \nregulatory gaps, many of these mechanisms have not been sufficient to detect and prevent \nsystemic risks associated with financial conglomerates.   \n                                                 \n14 This amount was due at the end of March 2009 and represented a 44% increase over the PRs286 billion ($3.6 \nbillion) owed at the end of June 2008. \n15 Appendix 8 summarizes the issuance of PRs92 billion of TFCs by NTDC, proceeds from which were used to repay \namounts owed to GENCOs and IPPs, to their fuel suppliers, and ultimately trade credit provided by banks.  \n16 Basic Core Principal 24 requires banking supervisors to \"supervise banking groups on a consolidated basis, \nadequately monitoring and, where appropriate, applying prudential norms to all aspects of the business conducted \nby the group.\" \n ", " 11\n \n35.  Other AETP reforms in this sector support the Government\u2019s efforts to better manage \nsystemic risks. The focus of AETP1 reforms was to develop a new institutionalized structure to \nsupport better management of these risks. Under AETP1, cabinet approval was obtained for \nlegislative amendments that would establish a regime for consolidated supervision, under which \nthe SBP would become the lead supervisor of financial groups and conglomerates. Licensing, \nregulatory, and supervisory authority over deposit-taking institutions would be transferred to the \nSBP. AETP1 also included legislative amendments to provide for greater accountability and \nindependence of the SBP, clarify its role in the financial safety net and lender of last resort \nfunction, and strengthen autonomy of the Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU). AETP1 also included \npreparation  of  a  new  consumer  protection  law  and  a  deposit  protection  law,  along  with \nimprovements in payment and settlement systems. Additional background information on the \nfinancial sector is set forth in Appendix 10. \n \nB.  Achievements under Subprogram 1 and Lessons Learned \n \n36.  Achievements. Policy dialogue and reforms under AETP1 helped Pakistan mitigate the \nfuel and food price shocks in 2008. The budget support has helped Pakistan meet its critical \nexpenditures at a time of fiscal compression and bolster public and investor confidence. Under \nAETP1, the Government put in place a major new targeted social safety program, the BISP, and \nbegan its rollout. The Government initiated steps to resolve electricity debts. Electricity tariffs \nwere raised and the Government began to clarify the intercorporate circular debt chain and \ndetermine the debt liabilities in the system. Table 4 summarizes achievements under AETP1 \nand how the AETP2 actions build upon these reforms.  \n \nTable 4: Accelerating Economic Transformation Program \u2013 \nAchievements under Subprogram 1 and Current Status of Reforms under Subprogram 2   \n \nSubprogram 1 Activities (Until  Achievements and  \nOutputs \nSeptember 2008)  Status as of June 2009 \nOutput 1: Immediate distortions removed to initiate structural transformation \nOutput 1.1: Targeted safety nets designed and rolled out for the poor and vulnerable households \nSocial impact of food and  Social safety net cover for up to 5 million  Reforms are on track.

Lessons. There are three key lessons. First, planning for medium-term reforms when \ncountries are struggling to cope with short-term issues is difficult. The structural transformation \nagenda needs much greater attention, as it may alter the sectoral and industrial landscape in \nPakistan.  Although  significant  analytical  work  has  been  undertaken  with  ADB  support  and \nseveral rounds of consultations have taken place with senior government officials and private \nsector representatives, the ADB team\u2019s assessment is that it would be better to focus on \nmedium-term reforms in the later part of 2009 and early 2010.  \n \n38.  Second, consultation with key stakeholders is necessary to build ownership for reforms \nand realistic expectations as to the time frame for implementation, the implementation risks, and \nthe design of risk mitigation measures. In the context of AETP1, this lesson applies to both \nwheat policy issues and the financial sector. While ADB\u2019s consultations regarding wheat have \nbeen largely with the Government and private sector business entities, dramatically changing \nglobal wheat market conditions have underscored the fact that farmers and consumers are also \naffected parties. In the case of financial sector regulation, the authorities obtained cabinet \napproval  for  legislative  measures  on  consolidated  supervision.  Yet,  with  the  financial \narchitecture being reexamined in many countries in light of the crisis, the Government and \nregulatory agencies have taken a position that they would like to explore more in-depth reforms \ninstead of making incremental legislative amendments. Earlier and deeper consultations among \nall parties concerned might have been helpful in shaping ideas and conserving time.  \n \n39.   Third, expectations on multiple outcomes need to be modest due to capacity constraints \nin the Government and regulatory agencies that become even more acute at times of crisis.  \n \nC.  External Assistance and Development Partner Coordination \n40.  A number of other development partners have been involved in broad fiscal, social \nsafety net, agricultural, power, and financial sector reforms in Pakistan. There has also been \nsignificant development partner support for a range of cross-cutting issues covered in AETP. \nThe sector agenda in AETP has benefited from ADB\u2019s past work in the relevant sectors, from \nongoing dialogue with the IMF and World Bank on macroeconomic stabilization measures, and \nfrom dialogue with the World Bank and other development partners on both social safety nets \nfor the poor and vulnerable and resolution of the circular debt in the energy sector.    \n \n41.  The  Friends  of  Pakistan  is  a  group  supporting  the  Government  in  its  efforts  to \nconsolidate democracy in Pakistan and fund social and economic development in the country. \nThe group was launched in New York on 26 September 2008 and consists of 25 countries and \nmultilateral institutions, including Canada,  France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, \nNordic countries, People\u2019s Republic of China, Republic of Korea, Spain, United Kingdom, United \nStates, and the ADB, European Union, Islamic Development Bank, United Nations, and the \nWorld Bank. \n \n42.  At a senior level meeting of the Friends of Pakistan group held in Tokyo on 17 April \n2009, the Government of Pakistan received $5.28 billion in additional pledges of support over 2 \nyears.  The  meeting  and  a  Donors  Conference  were  attended  by  31  countries  and  18 \n ", " 15\ninternational institutions. The meeting also endorsed the establishment of follow-up mechanisms \nfor international cooperation and coordination, including the formation of working groups (of \ninterested countries and institutions) in the identified areas of development, security, energy, \ninstitution capacity building, trade, and finance. The Friends also agreed to strengthen existing \ndonor coordination mechanisms.  \n \nV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n43.  The AETP will help Pakistan pave the way to restoring the precrisis growth path. The \nshort-term outcomes of AETP1 and AETP2 are to create fiscal space. The outputs under these \ntwo phases will include better targeting of subsidies and improved risk management in the \nfinancial sector. Over the medium-term, the follow-up phases of AETP3 and AETP4 (which will \nbe processed subject to satisfactory progress) will support structural transformation. \n \n44.  AETP is structured as a program cluster of four subprograms to be implemented over \n2007\u20132011. AETP1 helped the Government address fiscal implications of the food and energy \ncrisis, as well as short-term investment climate problems. It also initiated reforms that will be \ncarried  forward  in  the  medium  term.  AETP2,  in  continuation  of  AETP1,  will  focus  on \nmacroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability by reducing distortions in the wheat and energy \nsectors, addressing the circular debt in the energy sector, and strengthening the social safety \nnet. AETP2 will also strengthen financial intermediation. To better reflect the time frame needed \nfor  adopting  a  national  structural  transformation  strategy,  policy  actions  directly  supporting \nstructural transformation will not be included not in AETP2 but in subsequent subprograms. \nDeteriorating  security  conditions  have  delayed  consultations  needed  to  identify  strong \nleadership and ownership for structural transformation.   \n \n45.  Appendix 3 presents the Government\u2019s development policy letter. The policy matrix for \nAETP2 in Appendix 4 lays out the policy actions for AETP2 and indicative outputs and activities \nfor subsequent subprograms under this cluster. The activities for subsequent subprograms will \ncontinue to be refined over the next few years, subject to satisfactory implementation progress. \nThe indicators will be updated periodically, depending on implementation progress. ADB has \nrequested the IMF to provide a macroeconomic assessment in connection with AETP2. The IMF \nhas agreed to provide the assessment to ADB on 8 June 2009. Once received, the assessment \nwill be separately circulated. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n1.  Remove Immediate Distortions in the Food and Energy Sectors and Protect \nthe Poor and Vulnerable through Targeted Safety Net Programs \n46.  Targeted Safety Nets Designed and Rolled Out for the Poor and Vulnerable. Under \nAETP2, the Government aims to extend BISP coverage to at least 5 million families in FY2010. \nThe BISP has become fully operational. The BISP office in Islamabad has been established to \nmanage  the  program  and  provincial  offices  are  being  set  up.  Most  positions  in  BISP \nheadquarters have been filled and the directors of the provincial offices have been appointed.  \n \n47.  Under AETP2, targeting of beneficiaries has also been improved. In May 2009, BISP \nstarted piloting in 16 districts the new targeting method using poverty score cards to identify \neligible families. Based on lessons learned from the pilot project, the poverty score card will be \n ", "16  \nrolled out to all 130 districts in Pakistan. The World Bank is currently providing assistance to \nstrengthen BISP\u2019s program administration and fiduciary structure, as well as to establish and \nimplement  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  plus  a  grievance  redress  system.  BISP \nexpansion under the new targeting method and improved fiduciary controls will be reflected in \nsubsequent AETP programs. More details on the BISP are included in Appendix 6.    \n \n48.  Toward  Market-Based  Wheat  Pricing  and  Introduction  of  an  Efficient  Wheat \nReserve Management System. Under AETP1, the Government adopted an action plan to \nmove to a more market-based wheat pricing and efficient reserve management system. Under \nAETP2, the Government has agreed to implement a formula-based system for (i) setting the \nprocurement price for farmers to ensure that such price operates as a floor price and remains \nbelow the competitive market price, and (ii) ensuring that the wheat issue price reflects related \ncosts, including those for transport and storage. An efficient safety net program will eliminate the \nneed to subsidize the issue price, which subsidy is in large part captured by flour millers. Under \nsubsequent subprograms, implementation of the ECC action plan will be assessed and key \nreform  initiatives  implemented  will  be  reflected.  For  AETP3,  the  Government  expects  that \nstrategic reserves will be maintained at 2 months of annual consumption and that operational \nreserves will be eliminated.   \n \n49.  Initiating Power Sector Debt Resolution. Under AETP2, the Government adopted a \npower sector circular debt resolution plan (Appendix 9)17 and has begun with its implementation. \nThe plan, which was developed in close consultation with ADB, the IMF, and the World Bank \nshould resolve the circular debt problem and more broadly the financial deficit in this sector. It \nshould indirectly support improved corporate governance and reduce technical issues (losses, \ntheft, antiquated equipment, etc.), which have caused the chronic shortfall in Pakistan\u2019s power \nsupply. The plan clarifies the amount of the debt and key activities, including measures to \nprevent reoccurrence and ensure sustainable debt servicing. It identifies financing sources and \nagreements and includes milestones, an implementation timetable, and a monitoring framework.  \n \n50.  The key components of the plan can be group under three headings: \n(i)  Timely notification of cost recovery tariff \n(a) The  NEPRA  Act  will  be  amended  by  30  June  2009  to  enable  the \ndetermination and enforcement of tariff adjustments in a timely manner. \n(b) Notification of tariffs will not exceed 15 days from determination and the \nmonthly  fuel  and  power  purchase  adjustments  will  be  made  effective \nautomatically upon determination by NEPRA.  \n(c) Electricity tariffs will be determined by NEPRA quarterly.  \n(d) A business plan for FY 2009/10 has been prepared to support tariff reform \nand maximize outputs and sales in electricity and minimize costs by reducing \nsystem losses. Under this plan, electricity tariffs will be increased by 17.5% or \nas later determined by NEPRA to meet the zero tariff differential subsidy \ncommitment. The adjustment will be front loaded and made effective by 1 \nJuly 2009, with the remainder to be effective by September 2009. \n \n(ii)  Sector debt resolution \n(a) The Government will establish a debt holding company by 30 June 2009 to \nassume the debt liabilities of public power companies, which will in turn \nstrengthen the financial position of these companies.  \n(b) The debt holding company will be wholly owned by the Government and will \n                                                 \n17 Power sector debt refers to circular debt and debt overhang.  \n ", " 17\nmanage and pay the liabilities through the sale of assets, among other things, \nover the next 5 years. \n \n(iii)  Improved technical and financial performance of public power sector companies. \n(a) Public power sector companies have outstanding liabilities of PRs142 billion \n(as  of  31  March  2009),  which  are  payable  to  GENCOs,  IPPs  and  fuel \nsuppliers. Of this, the MOF will settle or assist to settle PRs53.5 billion, power \nsector companies will recover PRs27.7 billion from customers, and MOF will \nassist in paying the remaining PRs61 billion in liabilities.  \n(b) Performance contracts will be entered into between MOWP and each of the \npower  companies  effective  1  July  2009  to  promote  corporate  autonomy, \nfinancial independence and improved performance.  \n \n2.   Strengthening Financial Intermediation  \n51.  In recognition of challenges arising under the current regulatory structure for Pakistan\u2019s \nfinancial sector (notably with respect to the need to strengthen the supervision of financial \nconglomerates), the Government is considering adoption of an alternative supervisory model, \nincluding integrated regulation. With ADB support, the Government will be examining the costs \nand  benefits  of  various  regulatory  approaches,  along  with  lessons  learned  from  other \njurisdictions.  Changing  the  regulatory  architecture  is  a  long-term  undertaking\u2014with  human \nresource implications\u2014and needs to be carefully considered.  \n \n52.  Over  the  shorter  term, to improve regulatory  effectiveness and risk  mitigation in the \nfinancial sector, the SBP and the SECP have entered into a new memorandum of understanding \nunder AETP2 to promote better coordination, information sharing, and supervision of financial \nconglomerates. The memorandum provides for setting up task forces comprised of staff from both \nagencies to help mitigate risks posed by financial conglomerates and to move toward a more \nharmonized regulatory framework, including a risk-based approach to supervising the nonbank \nfinancial sector. In addition, to address systemic risk concerns posed by NBFCs\u2019 deposit-taking \nactivities, SECP has restricted their retail deposit taking. Under subsequent subprograms, the \nSBP will undertake a self-assessment of compliance with Basel core principles to identify and \naddress ongoing gaps.  \n \n53.  While AETP1 envisaged adoption of a new banking act that incorporates international best \npractices, in light of the Government\u2019s strong commitment to strengthen the overall supervisory \nframework, and to avoid the need for subsequent legislative revisions, it is more prudent to defer \nlegislative changes that impact the supervisory framework at this time. ADB will continue to \nmonitor the status of related legislative initiatives, including the new banking act. Subsequent \nsubprograms will include adoption of a blueprint for a new regulatory architecture, preparation of \nrelated draft legislation, and implementation of the new legislation, once adopted. \n \n54.  Under AETP2, work continues on the draft deposit protection law and the draft consumer \nprotection law. The draft deposit protection law is expected to incorporate international best \npractice principles on deposit insurance to help ensure the autonomy and financial soundness of \nthe deposit insurer, close coordination with financial sector regulators, and protection of depositors \n(including prompt access to their insured funds).18 The draft consumer protection law is expected \n                                                 \n18 International best practice principles on deposit insurance have been adopted by the International Association of \nDeposit Insurers (IADI). The IADI was established in 2002 as a nonprofit organization under Swiss Law, following \ndeliberations by the Financial Stability Forum. Fifty-two deposit insurance organizations are IADI members. \nNotable  principles  provide  that  (i)  a  deposit  insurer  should  be  provided  with  adequate  powers  to  finance \n ", "18  \nto  address  such  issues  as  transparency,  confidentiality,  availability  of  statements,  account \nservicing, protection against fraud, unfair contracts and lending practices, methods of debt \ncollection, and arbitrary penalties. Under AETP2, SBP also prepared and adopted new real time \ngross settlement rules. Subsequent subprograms will reflect progress in this area. \n \n55.  To improve FMU governance, under AETP2, the Government submitted to Parliament \namendments to the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Ordinance. The Government has also taken \nother steps to strengthen the financial and operational autonomy of the FMU (providing a one-\nline budget allocation to the FMU for FY2009/01 and onwards, agreeing to promptly release \nallocated funds, and facilitating the hiring of FMU staff). In support of international best practice \nprinciples for AML, Pakistan is currently undergoing a mutual evaluation of its AML regime.19 \nFindings and recommendations are expected to be finalized around July 2009. Subsequent \nAETP subprograms will take into account relevant priority actions identified through the mutual \nevaluation to support strengthening the FMU.  \n \n56.  Under AETP2, ADB continues to support operationalizing the FMU through ongoing \ntechnical  assistance  (TA).  The  FMU  has  been  relocated  into  new  offices  accommodating \naround 30 staff. Its staffing has increased from 4 staff (during AETP1 preparation in 2008) to 10. \nThe FMU is in the process of hiring 11 additional staff, including 8 professionals. Its workload \ncontinues to grow. In FY2008, the SBP and subsequently the FMU received 88 suspicious \ntransaction reports. In FY2009, the FMU has received almost 500 such reports. \n \nC.  Special Features \n57.  The AETP is an integral part of macroeconomic stabilization efforts undertaken by the \nGovernment with IMF support. AETP1 and AETP2 provide resources and inputs for short-term \nstabilization measures while paving the way for economic transformation over the medium term. \nAlthough the conceptual framework was designed within a short time in mid-2008, ADB has \nprovided the Government with significant advisory support, which formed the basis for the \nProgram.  \n \n58.  Gender inequality continues to be an area of major concern in Pakistan. Limited access \nto income-generating opportunities, together with a range of life cycle risks results in increasing \n                                                                                                                                                          \ncompensation payments, enter into contracts, set internal operating budgets and procedures, and access timely \nand accurate information to ensure that it can promptly meet its obligations to depositors; (ii) a deposit insurer \nshould be operationally independent, transparent, accountable, and insulated from undue political and industry \ninfluence; (iii) a framework should be in place for close coordination and information-sharing among the deposit \ninsurer and other financial system safety net participants; (iv) a deposit insurer should be part of the framework \nwithin the financial system safety net that provides for the early detection and timely intervention and resolution of \ntroubled banks; (v) effective failure-resolution processes should facilitate the ability of the deposit insurer to meet \nits obligations, minimize resolution costs and disruption of markets, maximize recoveries on assets, and reinforce \ndiscipline through legal actions in cases of negligence or other wrongdoing; and (vi) a deposit insurance system \nshould give depositors prompt access to their insured funds. \n19 As part of its commitment to reforms in AML and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT), Pakistan is currently \nundertaking a mutual evaluation of its AML/CFT regime. The mutual evaluation (carried out by the World Bank and \nin conjunction with the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering) is also part of the broader Financial Sector \nAssessment Program of Pakistan under the World Bank. For the mutual evaluation, Pakistan completed a detailed \nself-assessment questionnaire prior to the visit of the evaluation team in January and February 2009. This involved \na detailed assessment of its compliance with a range of international standards relating to AML and CFT, primarily \nthe Financial Action Task Force (FATF) 40+9 Recommendations. After the on-site visit, a draft report was prepared \nby the evaluation team for discussion with the Government. With support under the ongoing ADB TA for AML, the \nGovernment provided comments on the report. The mutual evaluation report will be finalized following peer review \nand discussion at the annual meeting of the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering in July 2009. \n ", " 19\nfeminization of poverty. The amount of $150 million of AETP2 will go to the BISP, whose \nprimary recipients are female heads of the family so that women of poor families can directly \naccess and manage the social safety net benefits. By the end of AETP3, 7 million female \nhousehold heads in Pakistan are expected to benefit from BISP.  \n \n59.  In addition, BISP will work with NADRA to issue CNICs for women. This is a major step \nforward. ADB's country gender assessment for Pakistan notes that more than 50% of women in \nrural Pakistan are without CNICs and that this prevents women from exercising their right to \nvote and run for election and access many government services.20 By receiving CNICs directly, \nwomen  will  have  less  dependency  on  their  male  family  members  to  access  services  and \nopportunities.  \n \nD.  Financing Plan \n60.  Program Loan. As noted above, the costs associated with AETP2 include increases in \nsubsidies to procure wheat from farmers in 2009 (at a price above the import parity price) and \nexpansion of the BISP to cover at least 5 million qualified families. The Government has \nrequested that AETP2 be designed to provide $500 million before the end of June 2009, which \nis the end of the current fiscal year. For AETP2, two loans are proposed\u2014a loan of $350 million \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR) and one of $150 million equivalent from the ADB's \nSpecial  Fund  resources  (ADF).  Subject  to  reform  progress  and  availability  of  resources, \nsubprograms 3 and 4 are each envisaged to be $400 million\u2013$500 million. Thus, the overall \namount for the AETP is estimated in the range of $1.8 billion\u2013$2 billion. \n \n61.  The OCR loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an interest \nrate to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum; and such other terms and conditions \nas set forth in the draft loan agreement. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons \nfor its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms \nand conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were by its own independent decision \nand not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n62.  The ADF loan will have a 24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest \nrate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter; and such other terms and \nconditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n63.  Program Management. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the executing agency for \nAETP2. The Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Livestock; Ministry of Water and Power; SBP; \nand BISP will be the implementing agencies.  \n \n64.  The secretary of finance will steer AETP2. The financial management arrangements \nwithin  MOF  have  been  assessed  as  adequate. 21  MOF\u2019s  accumulated  experience  in \nimplementing a large number of program loans demonstrates its competence and capacity to \n                                                 \n20  ADB.  2008.  Releasing  Women's  Potential  Contribution  to  Inclusive  Economic  Growth.  Country  Gender \nAssessment: Pakistan. Manila.  \n21 In  connection  with  the  processing  of  AETP2,  MOF  has  been  proactively  instituting  measures  to  address \noutstanding portfolio issues under other ADB programs and projects. Measures include: (i) reconciling imprest \naccounts; (ii) allocating funds for land acquisition and resettlement; and (iii) improving implementation performance \ngenerally.  \n ", "20  \ncarry out financial management of AETP2 effectively. ADB will monitor program implementation \nclosely to ensure that envisaged outputs and outcomes will be achieved.  \n   \n65.  Implementation Period. The implementation period for AETP2 is from October 2008 \nthrough June 2009. The loan of $500 million will become available following satisfaction of \nAETP2 policy actions and after loan effectiveness. Subsequent subprograms will be processed \nsubject to adequate reforms progress and the Government\u2019s continued commitment to the \nreform agenda.  \n \n66.  Procurement and Withdrawal Procedures. Loan proceeds will be used to pay for \nitems procured in ADB member countries, other than the items specified in the negative list of \nineligible items (Appendix 12) and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. \nThe proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed in accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s \nsimplified disbursement procedures and related requirements for program loans. Loan proceeds \ndisbursed against imports will require a certificate from the Government stipulating that the \nvalue of the total imports of Pakistan, minus its imports from nonmember countries, ineligible \nimports, and imports financed under other official development assistance, is equal to or greater \nthan the amount of the loan expected to be disbursed during a particular year. ADB reserves the \nright to audit the use of loan proceeds to verify accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \n67.  Anticorruption Policy. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to \nAETP. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin the loan regulations. The World Bank is currently working with the BISP to improve fiduciary \ncontrols,  including  financial  management  systems.  To  provide  greater  accountability  and \ntransparency in the flow of funds from the BISP to eligible beneficiaries under the new targeting \nmethod, the BISP has agreed to provide ADB with periodic reports and to post these reports on \nits website.   \n \n68.  Counterpart Funds. The Government shall ensure that the local currency generated \nfrom the proceeds of the OCR loan shall be used first to support the adjustment costs of reforms \nto be initiated and implemented under AETP2, and second to finance expenditures for the \nGovernment\u2019s  general  development  purposes.  For  the  local  currency  generated  from  the \nproceeds of the ADF loan, the Government shall establish and maintain a separate account at \nthe National Bank of Pakistan to ensure that that these funds are used to support poor and \nvulnerable  families  that  qualify  under  the  new  BISP  scorecard  targeting  method.  The \nGovernment  has  agreed  to  provide  ADB  with  periodic  reports  on  the  use  of  these  funds \n(utilization reports) for the period from July 2009 until full utilization, and to have this account \nand related records audited annually in accordance with standards acceptable to ADB. Certified \ncopies of the audited accounts and financial statements, as well as the auditors\u2019 reports, will be \nsubmitted to ADB not later than 6 months after the close of the fiscal year to which they relate.  \n \n69.  Program  Performance  Monitoring  and  Evaluation. The economic reform units in \nMOF and SBP have established and are implementing a performance evaluation system for the \nAETP, which includes a database on the status of policy measures and program indicators \nbased on the policy matrix. They are monitoring implementation of the AETP and its impacts \nand outcomes. They will be proactive in gathering data and proposing revisions as needed to \nensure  that  data  compiled  provide  useful  guides  to  management  decision  making  by \npolicymakers. Policy advisors may be placed within MOF and SBP to assist in monitoring and \n ", " 21\nevaluation.  ADB  will  keep  track  of  program  implementation  through  regular  reviews  and \nprogress  reports  throughout  implementation.  Based  on  these  reviews,  modifications  and \nimprovements will be considered. The design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1 identifies \nthe targets by which attainment of the outputs will be measured. In addition, each subprogram \nwill include a table summarizing overall AETP achievements (Table 4). \n \nVI.  SUBPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n \n70.  AETP2 will provide significant benefits and have a positive impact on the poor and \nwomen. First, it will help the Government move away from inefficient and untargeted subsidies \nto a targeted safety net program for the poor. The BISP is targeting poor families to protect their \nnutrition intake. Beginning with about 2 million families, the coverage has been extended to at \nleast 5 million eligible families. During AETP3, the BISP will be further expanded to support at \nleast  7  million  families  using  the  new  targeting  methodology.  In  addition,  AETP2  aims  to \nempower women by targeting women heads of poor families as the direct recipients and issuing \nthe national identity card for them, which they can use not only to access BISP benefits but to \nalso to open a bank account. Appendix 6 provides a summary of the BISP and Appendix 13 \npresents the summary poverty reduction and social strategy prepared for AETP2.  \n \n71.  An immediate outcome of AETP2 will be to help Pakistan meet immediate and large \nfiscal needs. Moreover, it will help the Government address financial deficits in the power sector \nin a more sustainable manner. This sector\u2019s large circular debt impedes reform much needed to \nresolve the ongoing energy crisis. In parallel, AETP2 will raise public confidence in the banking \nsystem through stronger financial intermediaries that are better able to mobilize and allocate \nresources  and  manage  risks.  AETP2  will  also  enable  ADB  to  sustain  policy  dialogue  on \nstructural  reform  in  sectors  where  it  has  been  actively  involved  through  past  and  current \ninvestments. \n \nB.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n72.  While some of the risks of AETP2 are political and outside of its scope, the financing will \nmitigate a range of others, including the following:  \n(i)  Interest group resistance. This is likely, as those affected by reforms in the \nshort  term  may  resist.  The  Government  is  adopting  a  good  communication \nstrategy to articulate the long-term and country-stability interests that are behind \nthe  reforms.  Further,  the  program  cluster  nature  of  the  AETP  ensures  prior \nactions by the Government before financing is provided.   \n(ii)  Weak capacity. This is a generic concern, which is elevated in case of complex \nreforms. Adequate design and implementation support is being mobilized through \nTA under AETP1 and under related TA projects that are ongoing. \n(iii)  Weak fiduciary controls. This is a generic concern but is being addressed in \nconnection with the BISP with support from the World Bank. The Government \nplans  to  implement  reforms  in  this  area  to  improve  transparency  and \naccountability, including to strengthen financial management systems within the \nBISP. \n(iv)  Global financial crisis. The measures under AETP2 are predicated on a global \nrecovery. While the program cannot influence global events, it can help cushion \nPakistan against some exogenous shocks. \n \n ", "22  \n73.  The  risk  of  not  supporting  Pakistan\u2019s  safety  net  programs  and  reducing  inefficient \nsubsidies  is  also  high.  In  the  absence  of  timely  reforms,  the  Government\u2019s  budget  would \ncontinue  to  be  burdened  by  costly  and  inefficient  subsidies,  leaving  fewer  resources  for \ndevelopment financing, and the financial sector would be vulnerable to systemic risks. High and \npersistent fiscal, current account, and investment deficits could lead to unsustainable levels of \npublic debt that would adversely affect the country\u2019s macroeconomic environment, constrain \ninvestment and economic growth, and aggravate poverty. \n \n74.  The underlying assumptions for AETP2 include   \n(i)  strong and sustained leadership and commitment to reforms,  \n(ii)  development partner coordination, and \n(iii)  open dialogue with the private sector and other key stakeholders. \n \nVII.  ASSURANCES \n75.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents.  \n(i)  The  policies  adopted  and  actions  taken  under  AETP2,  as  set  forth  in  the \nDevelopment Policy Letter and the Policy Matrix, will be in effect for and beyond \nthe duration of AETP2. \n(ii)  The Government will provide ADB with a report on the utilization of BISP funds \nfor the period October 2008 to April 2009.  \n(iii)   The Government will transfer the local currency generated from the ADF loan to \na separate BISP assignment account at the National Bank of Pakistan. Such \nfunds will be used to support poor and vulnerable women and families that \nqualify for cash benefits under the new BISP scorecard targeting method.   \n(iv)  The Government will provide ADB with a quarterly utilization report for the period \nbeginning July 2009 until full utilization of the local currency generated from the \nADF  loan  on  the  status  of  payments  under  the  separate  BISP  assignment \naccount  to  qualified  beneficiaries  using  the  new  BISP  scorecard  targeting \nmethod. \n(v)  The Government will ensure that the separate BISP assignment account at the \nNational Bank of Pakistan and related records be maintained in accordance with \nsound  accounting  principles  and  audited  annually  by  independent  auditors \nacceptable  to  ADB  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing  standards.  The \nGovernment will submit certified copies of the audited accounts and financial \nstatements, and the report of auditors, not later than 6 months after the close of \nthe fiscal year to which they relate.  \n(vi)  The Government will provide ADB with quarterly progress reports for the period \nJuly 2009 to June 2010 on the status of implementation of the power sector \ncircular debt resolution plan. The progress report will include updated information \non  outstanding  payments  owed  by  the  Government  to  power  distribution \ncompanies, power distribution companies to NTDC and CPPA, and NTDC and \nCPPA to the power generation companies and IPPs.   \n(vii)  The  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  policy  discussions  with  other \nmultilateral  and  bilateral  aid  agencies  that  may  have  implications  for  the \nimplementation of AETP2 and will provide ADB with an opportunity to comment \non any resulting policy proposals. The Government will take into account ADB\u2019s \nviews before finalizing and implementing any such proposal. \n \n ", " 23\nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n76.

Recent  Developments  and  Prospects  for  FY2010.  Most  of  the  sources  of  fiscal \ninstability for FY2008 have been addressed. Federal subsidies for oil and power have already \nbeen substantially reduced, and further increases to put tariffs at cost-recovery levels are set for \nthe very near term. Wheat subsidies, which equaled 0.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) in \nFY2008, covered high-cost imports late in the season as a result of general mismanagement. \nThe 2009 harvest is a bumper crop, and imports will be unnecessary for FY2010. Interest \npayments will remain high into 2010, as these reflect amounts due on obligations contracted in \nthe 1990s. Current reforms are focusing on ways to achieve a sustained increase in revenues. \n2.  Summary  of  the  FY2008  Fiscal  Crisis.  Surges in commodity prices, coupled with \nunsustainable subsidy policies and a general stagnation of tax revenues, contributed to a sharp \ndeterioration in the fiscal balance from the overall deficit equal to 4.3% of GDP posted for \nFY2007 to 7.4% for FY2008. Concurrently, previously ample capital inflows deteriorated, and \nthe lack of commensurate reductions in development spending contributed to a deterioration of \nPakistan\u2019s  external  position  as  reserves  declined  to  less  than  1  month  of  imports.  Since \nNovember 2008, the Government has taken steps to address causes of the macroeconomic \nimbalances and return to a path consistent with the 4% fiscal deficit limit implied by Pakistan\u2019s \nFiscal Responsibility Law (2005). This note summarizes key aspects of the fiscal challenge and \nmeasures taken since November 2008.  \n3.  Context.  The  sharp  deterioration  in  FY2008  followed  on  the  heels  of  substantial \nimprovements in the fiscal balance. From 2001, the Government undertook a range of policies \nto contain expenditures and improve revenues as part of the Poverty Reduction and Growth \nPlan approved by the IMF and the World Bank, and by FY2004 the fiscal deficit had declined to \n2.4%  of  GDP.  Robust  capital  inflows  provided  room  for  Pakistan  to  undertake  increased \ndevelopment spending while narrowly improving the internal fiscal balance. The fiscal balance \ndeteriorated somewhat in FY2006 and FY2007 to 4.3% of GDP in response to additional public \nspending following the October 2005 earthquake and a surge in interest payments.  \nTable 1:  Summary of Fiscal Position (% of GDP) \n Item    2004/05  2005/06  2006/07  2007/08  2008/09 a \nTotal Revenue    13.8  14.2  14.9  {14.6}  {14.7} \n     Tax Revenue    10.1  10.6  10.2  {10.6}  {\u2014} \n     Nontax Revenue    3.7  3.6  4.7  {4.0}  {\u2014} \nTotal Expenditure     17.2  18.5  19.2  {22.2}  {19.0} \n    Current Expenditure    13.3  13.6  15.8  {18.1}  {\u2014} \n         Without Interest    3.4  3.4  4.2  {4.8}  {\u2014} \n    Development Expenditure    3.9  4.8  4.9  {4.2}  {\u2014} \nFiscal Deficit    3.3  4.3  4.3  {7.4}  {4.3} \nSources: Economic Affairs Wing, Finance Division, Government of Pakistan. 2008.

During FY2008, subsidy outlays \nexceeded budget allocations by 2.8% of GDP, accounting for 37.7% of the 3% of \nGDP increase in the overall deficit. The unprecedented increase in oil prices \ndrove subsidies far above the budget allocation of PRs15 billion to PRs175 billion \n(1.7% of GDP), as price increases were not passed along to consumers. The \npower subsidy roughly doubled from the budget allocation of PRs73 billion to \nPRs133 billion. The subsidy on wheat supplied at concessional rates through the \nutility  supply  stores  amounted  to  about  PRs40  billion\u2014and  this  had  no \ncorresponding budget allocation. Fertilizer subsidies for FY2008 amounted to \nPRs30 billion, more than double the budget allocation. \n \nFigure A2.1: Budgeted versus Actual Subsidies for 2007/08 \n(PRs billion)\n200\n175.0\n150 133.3\n100\n72.5\n50 40.0\n29.5\n15.0 13.5\n0\nBudgeted Subsidies Actual Subsidies\nOil Power Fertilizer Wheat\nSources: Government of Pakistan, Finance Division. 2007.

Interest payments on the public debt rose by \nmore than 49% in FY2007 on the back of lumpy payments made on maturing \nDefense Savings Certificates issued in the late 1990s. Taken as a share of GDP, \ninterest  payments  rose  from  3.1%  in  FY2006  to  4.8%  for  FY2008.  During \nFY2008, these interest obligations increased further to PRs490 billion\u2014about \n18% higher than budgeted amounts. Payments for FY2009 are expected to be \n4.8% of GDP and to remain at about that level for FY2010, placing considerable \npressure on the budget. A growing level of debt also contributed to increased \ninterest payments, as total public debt grew by 10% in FY2007 and 16% for \nFY2008 in response to expanding fiscal and current account deficits. \n ", "  Appendix 2  29 \n \nFigure A2.2:  Interest Payments (PRs billion)\n750\n700\n619.0\n650\n600\n550 490.0\n500\n450 387.1\n400\n350\n273.9\n260.0\n300 235.3 226.3 219.7\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n2001/02  2002/03 2003/04  2004/05 2005/06 2006/07 2007/08 2008/09*\nSources: Economic Affairs Wing.

Article IV Consultation and First Review Under the \nStand-by Arrangement\u2014Staff Report. Washington, DC. \n  \n \n5.  Tax Revenue Slippage. Part of the fiscal deficit increase in FY2008 can be attributed to \nsluggish revenue performance. The Federal Board of Revenue\u2019s collections had increased \ngradually to about 9.7% of GDP and were expected to reach 10.3% for FY2008. Instead, owing \nin part to a slowing economy and a decline in corporate profitability, collections came in about \n0.7% of GDP lower than budgeted. It is expected that tax revenue collections will be about \nunchanged as a share of GDP for FY2009, as higher than expected revenue from the petroleum \ndevelopment levy partially offset lower than expected collection of sales tax revenue on imports. \nThe authorities are considering a range of measures for FY2010. \n \n6.  Financing the Deficit. Large external capital inflows between FY2005 and FY2007 \nfinanced nearly half of the fiscal deficit, limiting the extent to which the Government relied on \ndomestic bank and nonbank institutions. External inflows dropped precipitously in FY2008, \nfinancing only about 17% of the deficit, and the Government relied on the banking system to \nfinance 83% of the deficit. Much of that was financed by borrowing from the SBP. SBP claims \non the Government for budget support climbed from PRs339 billion at the end of FY2007 to \nPRs1,274 by November 2008. Alternatively, budget support to the Government increased from \n3.2% of broad money at the end of FY2007 to 12.5% of broad money at the end FY2008. The \nSBP  financing  for  budget  support  was  restricted  to  the  stock  target  agreed  to  under  the \nInternational Monetary Fund Stand-by Agreement. As treasury bill rates rose in concert with a \n250-basis point increase in the SBP\u2019s discount rate, these securities became attractive to \nbanks.  Most  treasury  auctions  have  been  oversubscribed,  with  a  wide  range  of  banks \nparticipating. \n \n7.  Prospects for FY2010. Strains on the fiscal deficit for FY2009 have been reduced. The \nreduction  in  international  commodity  prices  (especially  for  wheat  and  oil)  will  generate \nconsiderable fiscal space. Additional factors important for the 2010 fiscal outlook include:  \n(i)  Measures  will  be  introduced  for  FY2010  to  strengthen  revenue  collections, \nincluding improvements to both policies and administration. \n ", "  Appendix 2  31 \n(ii)  The Government has undertaken a rationalization and review of development \nspending.  \n(iii)  The fiscal space generated by recent policy changes has to be viewed in the \ncontext  of  substantially  increased  risk  to  Pakistan\u2019s  economic  performance \nappearing in recent months. Social safety net requirements can be expected to \nexpand considerably. Not only has unemployment increased, but a substantial \nnumber of citizens have been displaced as a result of intensified internal conflict. \nSecurity and defense spending will necessarily rise. Real growth could be further \nreduced, particularly if intensified conflict substantially impacts on agricultural \nactivity. \n(iv)  The donor meeting in April 2009 resulted in commitments for additional support \nto shore up development activity and to reflect the increase in social support that \nwill be needed. The original deficit target for FY2010 of 3.4% has been loosened \nto accommodate up to 1.2% of GDP in additional donor support. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "32  Appendix 3 \nGOVERNMENT\u2019S DEVELOPMENT POLICY LETTER \n \n \n ", "Appendix 3  33 \n    \n ", "34  Appendix 3 \n \n ", "Appendix 3  35 \n \n ", " \nPOLICY MATRIX FOR THE PAKISTAN ACCELERATING ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION PROGRAM  3\n6\nSUBPROGRAM 2   \n \nImpact: Sustained high economic growth   A\np\n  pe\nn\nOutcome: Macroeconomic stability   d\nix\n   4\n \nSubprogram 2 (June 2009)  Subprogram 3 (June 2010) \nOutputs  Subprogram 1 Activities \nActivities  Indicative Activities \nOutput 1: Immediate distortions removed to initiate structural transformation \nOutput 1.1: Targeted safety nets designed and rolled out for the poor and vulnerable households  \nSocial  impact  of  food  and  Safety net cover for up to 5 million  FY2010  budget  for  the  BISP  FY2011 budget allocation for \nfuel  inflationary  pressures  poor families provided for through  increased  to  provide  income  BISP  increased  to  provide \nmitigated  through  targeted  allocation  of  PRs41  billion  in  support  for  at  least  5  million  income support for at least 7 \nsafety net programs  FY2009 budgeta  familiesb   million families  \n     \nClear  criteria  developed  for  BISP  operationalized  with  (i)  BISP\u2019s  fiduciary  structure \nselecting  beneficiaries  of  cash  central  and  provincial  offices  strengthened  and  improved \ntransfers  through  the  Benazir  established,  and  (ii)  improved  targeting  system \nIncome Support Program (BISP)   targeting  system  for  implemented \nbeneficiaries piloted \nOutput 1.2: Market-based wheat pricing and efficient reserve management in place \nWheat  subsidies  reduced  Time-bound  action  plan  adopted    Implementation  of  ECC \nand  eliminated  and  wheat  by  Economic  Coordination  action plan \nprocurement  made  Committee  (ECC)  for  market-\ncompetitive  based  pricing  and  reserve \nmanagement (ECC action plan)c \n  Support price of wheat for farmers  ECC  endorsed  implementation   \nincreased  from  PRs425d  to  of  a  formula-based  system  for   \nPRs650  setting (i) wheat support price for   \n2009 and beyond based on (a)   \ncosts of production, (b) regional \nprices,  (c)  import  and  export \nparity  prices,  and  (d)  domestic \nand  global  market  conditions; \nand  (ii)  wheat  issue  price  to \nreflect all related costs \n ", " \nSubprogram 2 (June 2009)  Subprogram 3 (June 2010) \nOutputs  Subprogram 1 Activities \nActivities  Indicative Activities \nOutput 1.3: Electricity subsidies funded and power sector debt resolution initiated \nPast  liabilities,  including  Parliamentary approval obtained to  Power  sector  circular  debt  Implementation  of  PSDRP \nelectricity subsidies, settled  reduce electricity subsidies through  resolution  plan  (PSDRP)  with a focus on removal of \nand debt restructuring plan  (i) elimination of generalized sales  prepared  and  implementation  subsidies  and  resolution  of \nimplemented  tax  subsidies  for  all  domestic  commenced.

Background \n \n1.  On 13 October 2008, the Government launched a new cash transfer program for the \npoor, the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP), to smooth the impact of the food and fuel \ncrises. The Government allocated PRs34 billion for FY2009, targeting 3.5 million families. This \nwas the third-largest allocation in the budget and constituted 0.3% of GDP.  \n \n2.  BISP provides cash transfers of PRs1,000 per month to the female head of eligible \nfamilies  whose  monthly  income  is  less  than PRs6,000  per  month.  This  amount  has  been \nestimated as sufficient to finance 20\u201325 days of flour needs for a 5\u20136 member family.  \n \n3.  The different tasks under the BISP are functionally separated to guard against misuse of \nfunds. The BISP is responsible for management of the program. It decides on the policies \n(including targeting criteria), prepares regulations and manuals, and monitors implementation. In \norder  to  quickly  launch  the  program,  parliamentarians  were  asked  to  identify  beneficiary \nfamilies. The services of the National Database Registration Authority (NADRA) have been \nhired by BISP to verify eligibility of the selected families based on specified criteria. NADRA \nsends the list of eligible families to BISP to calculate the payments due and to the Pakistan Post \nto deliver the payments. Pakistan Post has been contracted by the BISP to deliver the payment \nthrough money orders to the adult female in the household every alternate month.   \n \nB.  Program Management \n \n4.  As discussed above, key BISP functions, such as targeting, operation, payments, and \ncontrols, are carried out by separate actors to allow for checks and balances. This requires a \nstrong central unit to coordinate the program. \n \n5.  Strategic and Management Level. The BISP is governed by a management board \nheaded by the BISP chairperson, who is appointed by the President of Pakistan upon advice of \nthe Prime Minister. The BISP board is responsible for design and implementation of the BISP. \nCurrently, the management board is composed of five members of the National Assembly, the \ndeputy chairman of the Planning Commission, and BISP\u2019s managing director. However, the \nrecently approved Benazir Income Support Program Ordinance, 2009 expands the number of \nboard members to not less than nine nor more than 11, half of which should be from the \nGovernment and half from nongovernment organizations.  \n \n6.  Operational Level. The managing director is responsible for day-to-day operations of \nthe BISP and is supported by three departments: (i) the Operations Department liaises with the \nregional  units  in  each  province;  (ii)  the  Administration  Department  is  responsible  for \nadministrative matters, media contacts, and information technology; and (iii) the Finance and \nAccounts Department is responsible for the fiduciary aspects of BISP. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "44  Appendix 6 \n \nFigure A6.1: Organizational Structure of BISP Headquarters \n \nChairperson\n(Federal Minister) Board\nP.S\nP.A\nP.A\nQ M.D\nN.Q\nDr.\nJS  JS  JS/FA\nOperations Administration Finance & Accounts\nDPiurISnejcLatbo/r DSiriencdthor DBiarelocctohr DAJirKec/NtoAr DNFiWrAeTFcAtPo/r OfIfTic er AdDmSin-I AdDmSin-II LMOiafefisidcoieanr   FD&SA DI/AS\nPS= 1 Asst.\nAPsAs=t.1=28 LMiaeisdoian   CAas/Ohi/er A/O\nNQ=8 Officer\nS.G=3\nAsst .

To  date,  the  managing  director  and  the  directors  general  of  operations  and \nadministration have been appointed. The position of director general for finance and accounts is \nvacant. In addition, 83 other staff have been appointed.  \n \n8.  Accounting and Financing. The institutional arrangements and governance structure \nof the BISP will be defined under implementing regulations to the new ordinance and are in the \nprocess  of  being  drafted.  Comprehensive  accounting  and  finance  guidelines  are  being \ndeveloped. These will incorporate a robust internal control framework and ensure adequate \nsegregation of duties. The finance and accounts guidelines will also provide the minimum staff \nand capacity required. Additional staff will be needed to effectively address the anticipated \nnature and scale of operations and satisfactorily manage accounting and financial reporting \nfunctions once the entity fully commences operations and subnational formations are functional. \nAn  accounting  and  financial  reporting  module  will  form  part  of  the  entity\u2019s  management \ninformation system (MIS). \n \n9.  An internal audit unit has also been created. Currently, the unit is reporting to the \ndirector general for finance and accounts. To ensure independence and enhance the control \nenvironment, the unit will be placed under the administrative control of the managing director. \nAll  internal  audit  reports  will  be  presented  to  the  management  board  for  discussion  and \nappropriate action. An internal audit policy has been drafted and is under internal review. Staff \nin internal audit will need to be trained to ensure that the internal audit work program can be \neffectively implemented.  \n \n10.  Operations.  BISP  has  five  regional  offices.  Each  regional  office  is  managed  by  a \ndirector general. The regional offices are small, but they can be expanded if needed. Each \n ", "  Appendix 6  45 \nregional office has a number of divisional offices covering zones within the region. There will be \n28 divisional offices in total, each headed by a zonal director and assisted by supervisors, 125 \nin total for all divisional offices. So far, all provincial offices have been set up and most of the \ndirector general and director positions have been filled. Other staff still must be appointed as the \nBISP rolls out its operation. A total of 16 directors have been appointed, including directors \ngeneral. The divisional offices are still being established.  \n \n11.  The main function of the divisional offices is to redress grievances. A website has been \ncreated  where  individual  applications  and  benefit  payment  status  can  be  tracked.  As  it  is \nunlikely that many targeted individuals have internet access, constituents thus submit their \ngrievances  through  their  parliamentarians.  An  MIS  is  under  preparation  which  will  provide \ndivisional offices with access to updated applications and payment status of the applicants and \nbeneficiaries.  A  toll-free  number  will  be  launched  to  submit  grievances  once  the  MIS  is \noperational. Moving grievance redress down to the grassroots level is a priority going forward.   \n \n12.  Flow of Funds. As set forth in the BISP Income Support Program Ordinance, 2009, the \nBISP prepares an annual budget estimate for the program. The Ministry of Finance reviews and \npresents a budget before Parliament that includes the annual BISP budget. Periodically, the \nBISP  updates  the  Ministry  of  Finance  on  its  budget  requirements  (in  light  of  qualified \nbeneficiaries). Based on the update, the Ministry of Finance advises the Accountant General \nPakistan to release the funds needed into BISP\u2019s assignment account with the National Bank of \nPakistan. BISP receives the list of eligible families from NADRA, which is also forwarded to \nPakistan Post. BISP calculates the amount owed. The managing director of BISP approves the \namount for release to Pakistan Post and issues a check. Pakistan Post then delivers money \norders to eligible families and prepares payment information (status of money order for each \nbeneficiary, whether it was delivered or not, cumulative figures). After 30 days, Pakistan Post \nprepares reconciliation. \n \nTable 6.1: BISP Budget Information (as of 30 April 2009) \n  \nDescription  Amount  \n(PRs million) \nBudget allocation for FY 2008/09  34,000\nAmount disbursed by BISP for \nBenefit payments (including Pakistan Post service chargesa)  10,972\nBISP administrative costs  118\nNational Database and Registration Authority  123\nPilot poverty score card survey in 16 districts (PPAF/RSPN/PCO)  173\nPPAF = Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund; PCO = Population Census Organization; RSPN = Rural Support Program \nNetwork. \na  Pakistan Post will receive PRs25 per money order, the postman will receive PRs5 per money order. \nSource: Benazir Income Support Program.  \n \n13.  At the current pace, around half of the allocated PRs34 billion will be disbursed by 30 \nJune 2009. More than 95% of the disbursements are funding benefit payments, meaning less \nthan 5% of the resources are used to cover administrative costs and service delivery (including \ncosts of the pilot project to prepare a new targeting method). \n \n14.  Selection  of  Beneficiaries.  In  order  to  quickly  launch  the  BISP,  federal \nparliamentarians  (members  of  National  Assembly  and  senators)  were  asked  to  identify \nbeneficiary families. The rationale is that parliamentarians are accountable to their electorates. \n ", "46  Appendix 6 \n \nAll  parliamentarians,  irrespective  of  party  affiliation,  have  been  provided  with  an  equal \nopportunity  to  recommend  eligible  families.  Each  politician  received  8,000  forms  to  be \ndistributed  based  on  13  criteria  to  the  poor  and  needy  in  his  or  her  constituency.1 The \ncompleted  forms  were  sent  directly  to  NADRA.  This  selection  process  was  closed  on  28 \nFebruary 2009. Forms submitted after this date have been discarded.  \n \nTable 6.2: Status of Forms Processing (as of 30 April 2009) \n \nDescription  Total Number  Percentage \nNumber of forms distributed to Parliamentarians  3,500,000  100 \nNumber of completed forms submitted by Parliamentarians  3,085,919  73.5 \nto NADRA \nNADRA = National Database and Registration Authority. \nSource: Benazir Income Support Program. \n \n15.  In  December  2008,  the  Government  decided  to  improve  BISP  targeting  through  the \nadoption of a poverty scorecard based on a so-called \u201cproxy means testing\u201d approach. The use of \nthe poverty scorecard will be pilot tested in 16 districts. Three organizations have been contracted \nto conduct the pilot test: Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund (PPAF), Rural Support Program \nNetwork (RSPN), and Population Census Organization (PCO). The PPAF and RSPN are well \nestablished in the rural areas, and the PCO has a broad network of offices throughout the country. \nThe BISP has established clear criteria for evaluating their performance before selecting the \norganizations for the nationwide rollout of the poverty scorecard survey. The pilot began in May \n2009 and is expected to be completed in 2\u20133 months. \n \n16.  This test phase will provide useful insights and the necessary learning for scaling up the \nprogram nationwide, including to make improvements in the enrollment, payment, grievance \nand appeals, and monitoring and evaluation processes.  \n \n17.  Recipient Verification. NADRA has been contracted to verify targeted beneficiaries \nunder the BISP. NADRA receives the prescribed forms from the parliamentarians and verifies \nthem electronically by applying certain filters. It is not able to check on one of the key criteria, \nwhich is money income. Two weeks are allotted to process the forms. The list of eligible \nbeneficiaries is passed on electronically to Pakistan Post for payment. The list of ineligible \nbeneficiaries (those who do not meet all eligibility criteria) is returned to BISP for closure. The \nlist of rejections (due to discrepancies in the forms) is returned to BISP and the applicants for \nrectification. In addition, NADRA rejects people in cases of fraud or duplication. \n \n \n                                                 \n1  The criteria for a family's eligibility for benefits under the BISP are as follow: (i) possession of a computerized \nnational identification card (CNIC) by the female applicant; and (ii) monthly income is less than PRs6,000; \n(iii) widowed or divorced women, without adult male in the family; or (iv) any physically or mentally retarded \nperson(s) in the family; or (v) any family member suffering from a chronic disease. The following families will not be \neligible: (vi) where any member of the family is in the employment of a government or semi-government authority \nor department or the armed forces; (vii) where any member of the household is drawing a pension from a \ngovernment or semi-government authority or department or the armed forces; (viii) where any member of the \nhousehold is receiving any post-retirement benefits from any department or agency; (ix) where any member of the \nfamily owns agriculture land of more than 3 acres or a residential house or plot of more than eight square yards (3 \nmarlas); (x) where any member of the family is receiving income support from any other sources; (xi) where any \nmember of the family possesses a machine readable passport; (xii) where any member of the family possesses a \nnational identity card for overseas pakistanis; (xiii) where any member of the family has a bank account (except at \nNBP, HBL, UBL, MCB, ABL, BOP, Bolan Bank, Khyber Bank, First Women's Bank, Zarai Tarakyati Bank, Khushali \nBank, and all microfinance banks). \n ", "  Appendix 6  47 \n \nTable 6.3: Number of Beneficiaries  Verified by NADRA (as of 30 April 2009)  \n \nProvince  Total Received  Total Eligible  Total Ineligible  Total Rejected \nPunjab  1,546,637  819,583  285,935  441,119 \nSindh  708,150  469,642  44,699  193,809 \nNWFP  509,547  343,628  59,672  106,247 \nBalochistan  214,834  112,800  20,635  81,399 \nFATA  106,751  55,627  15,736  35,388 \n    Total  3,085,919  1,801,280  426,677  857,962 \nFATA = Federal Administered Tribal Areas;  NWFP = NorthWest Frontier Province.  \nSource: Benazir Income Support Program. \n \n18.  One of the eligibility criteria is that a female member of the family apply as the named \napplicant. She needs to have a computerized national identification card (CNIC). The NADRA \nnetwork in rural areas, especially in the FATA region, is incomplete but is being expanded as \nthe BISP extends coverage. As of October 2008, 67.3 million CNICs had been issued out of an \neligible adult population of 85.5 million. Since the introduction of BISP, NADRA has issued a \ntotal of 2 million new CNIC cards to women. The issuance has potentially a strong emancipatory \nimpact, as the possession of a CNIC is required for most business activities, such as opening a \nbank account, obtaining a telephone connection, and for any government application. \n \n19.  Disbursement. Pakistan Post has a network of 12,343 post offices that can help reach \nBISP beneficiaries. Payments are delivered at home without collection cost for the recipient. \nPakistan  Post  has  agreed  to  provide  BISP  with  computerized  payment  information  and  a \nreconciliation of financial transactions within the subsequent month after completion of the \ndisbursement cycle. In case of abuse (when a postal delivery person asks for a fee), sanctions \nwill be imposed. Pakistan Post has its own institutionalized mechanism based on its internal \nmonitoring cell for reconciliation, random checking, and reporting. So far, 11 postal delivery \npersons have been sanctioned for mishandling the payment delivery. The Postal Department \nhas also taken administrative action against officials as well as officers.  \n \n ", "48  Appendix 7 \n \nWHEAT MARKETING REFORMS \n \nA.  Background \n \n1.  Under the Accelerating Economic Transformation Program, the Government committed \nto a market-based wheat pricing and efficient reserve management system. This involves wheat \nmarketing reforms regarding the producer procurement price and wheat issue price to flour \nmillers, as well as a reduction in the scale of procurement undertaken by government agencies \nfor  the  within-year  operational  reserves  and  for  inter-year  strategic  reserves.  Given  an \nanticipated expansion in the private sector\u2019s role in marketing, the Government also committed \nto undertake the sale of surplus storage facilities.  \n \n2.  The approach approved by the Government\u2019s Economic Coordination Committee (30 \nSeptember 2008) was incremental, reflecting the need to maintain price stability for producers \nand consumers until new government safety net programs become fully operational that are \nbetter targeted and more efficient. A key new program is the Benazir Income Support Program \n(BISP), which will provide income support to 7 million poor and low-income families by 2010.  \n \n3.  The existing wheat marketing support measures have involved government subsidies \n(federal and provincial) to support wheat producers and consumers that include significant \nsubsidy transfers to flour millers. The interventions, while providing some price stability, have \nnot been efficient or well targeted in terms of reaching their intended beneficiaries. While the \nwheat subsidy was only 0.3% of GDP in FY2008, it is still significant in terms of government \nexpenditure (accounting for approximately PRs40 billion). \n \nB.  Wheat Economy \n4.  Wheat Marketing System. Wheat is the staple food in Pakistan, and, given the large \npopulation of poor and low-income earners (small-scale producers and consumers), wheat price \nstabilization has been a long-term government policy objective. The Government has adopted a \nnumber of interventions involving \n(i)  a  wheat  procurement  price  (set  by  the  Government  for  purchase  from \nproducers); \n(ii)  wheat procurement targets for the Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Supplies \nCorporation,  or  PASSCO,  and  the  provincial  food  departments  (with  Punjab \naccounting for approximately 80% of the country\u2019s production);  \n(iii)  a wheat issue price for sale of procured wheat to flour millers (usually at less \nthan the costs of procurement plus storage, handling, and transport, it is quota \nbased); and  \n(iv)  controls  on  wheat  movement,  with  import  and  export  controls  (tariffs  and \nprohibitions)  depending  on  the  country\u2019s  production  level,  and  domestically \ninterprovincial restrictions on movement until provincial targets are achieved. \n \n5.  In an average season, the country\u2019s production is around 21 million tons, of which about \n60% is retained while the remaining 40% (i.e., 8 million to 9 million tons) enters the market. In \nterms of demand, procurement is undertaken by government agencies, flour millers, and traders \n(some of which is for illegal export). For 2009, production is forecast at 25 million tons. The \nGovernment\u2019s policy agenda calls for increasing wheat production, with a target of 30 million \ntons by 2015. To achieve this through productivity improvements would require a large program \nproviding farmers improved access to quality inputs, finance, water, and technical services.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 7  49 \n6.  In a market-based wheat producing economy, the wheat price will range between the \nimport and export parity price, depending on the level of production and whether the country is \nexporting or importing in that year, and with adjustments for associated transport and handling \ncharges. The export parity price is lower, with the difference being the cargo or freight cost \n(international to port for imports) and the transport and handling costs from farm to port (for \nexports).  \n \n7.  In Pakistan over the period 2005\u20132007, the domestic price was akin to the export parity \nprice, as over this period crop production was good and export was undertaken at some level \n(see Table 1). The exception was the period of high fluctuating prices during 2007\u20132008. Given \ngovernment interventions into the wheat market in Pakistan, the link between international price \nchanges and movement in domestic prices is at times distorted.  \n \nTable A7.1:  Wheat Production and Trade \n('000 tons) \nConsumption  Domestic \nYear  Production  Imports  Exports  Procurement  Releases \n2000\u20132001  19,024  80    8,582  5,537 \n2001\u20132002  18,226  267    4,081  3,376 \n2002\u20132003  19,183  148  649  4,045  5,130 \n2003\u20132004  19,500  108  1,140  3,514  4,104 \n2004\u20132005  21,612  427  43  3,939  4,500 \n2005\u20132006  21,277  816    4,514  2,088 \n2006\u20132007  23,295  136    4,422  6,003 \n2007\u20132008  20,959  1,820    3,918  6,320 \nNote: Export numbers are official exports, and do not include informal sales and exports to Afghanistan. \nSource:  Official Government of Pakistan Statistics (MINFAL, Federal Bureau of Statistics). \n \n8.  The  existing  government  procedure  for  setting  the  procurement  price  involves  the \nAgricultural  Policy  Institute  (API)  under  the  Ministry  of  Food,  Agriculture,  and  Livestock \nundertaking a wheat market analysis. This involves assessing the following factors: domestic \nsupply, demand, stocks, and price; cost of production, comparative economics of competing \ncrops, fertilizer costs, nominal and real prices, and world market supply and demand; and the \ndomestic parity price and import and export parity prices.  \n \n9.  While the API analyses a range of factors, its report does not make a specific price \nrecommendation. API does not use a structured methodology with weightings for the key factors \ndetermining price, such as forecast international prices and the cost of production. Under the \ncurrent system, it appears that the dominant determining factor is cost of production. The \nanalysis is submitted to the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Livestock, which prepares a \nrecommendation on the wheat procurement price that is then submitted to the ECC. The ECC \nmakes the final decision on the procurement price. The procurement price movements over \n2007\u20132009 and associated impacts on supply and procurement indicate the risks associated \nwith the current procedure when international wheat prices are fluctuating. To reduce the risk of \nthe wheat procurement price\u2019s being distortionary and to set the price at a level that is above the \nmarket price, a more structured price setting methodology is needed. Such a methodology \nshould require a more thorough assessment of international forecast wheat prices.  \n \n10.  The level of wheat stocks and reserves tend to be country-pecific and is influenced by \ndomestic policy and assessment of potential risks. Pakistan does keep large national stocks in \nrelation to its policy of assisting to stabilize prices, which results in high costs to the Government. \n ", "50  Appendix 7 \n \nDuring  2001\u20132007,  levels  were  approximately  19%  of  production  (Table  2).  In  comparison, \nnational stocks in India over the same period were about 23%, which is high relative to other \ncountries in South Asia. For India, it reflects the country\u2019s large demand given its population and \nthe impact that increased Indian wheat import requirements would have on the world price. That is \nnot a factor for Pakistan. For 2009, the Indian procurement price is equivalent to PRs750 per 40 \nkilograms (kg). (Price comparison between the two countries may not reflect the wheat quality \ndifference between them.) By contrast, Bangladesh operates with substantially lower stock levels.  \n \n11.  Impact  of  Wheat  Prices  in  2007  and  2008. During 2007 and 2008, wheat prices \nincreased rapidly. In Pakistan, this price volatility impacted on households\u2019 capacity to access \nand purchase wheat. This, in turn, led to social unrest. The announced 2008 procurement price \nwas  less  than  the  market  price  (export  parity  price),  and  during  the  2008  season  the \nGovernment had to raise the procurement price to PRs625 per 40 kg. Initially, exports had been \nundertaken in 2008. Later in the year, to meet consumer needs, Pakistan had to import wheat \n(1.8 million tons) at a much higher price, which was then sold at a lower price to domestic flour \nmillers. It is estimated this subsidy cost PRs40 billion. Trying to meet this domestic demand, the \nGovernment banned exports and producing provinces imposed interprovincial restrictions to \ncontrol supply and movement and to achieve required targets.  \n \nTable A7.2:  Wheat Procurement and Issue Price \nProcurement \nPrice   \nYear  (PRs/40 kg)  Issue Price \n    Sep\u2013Oct  Nov\u2013Dec  Jan\u2013Feb  Mar\u2013Apr \n2000\u20132001  300  330  335  340  345 \n2002\u20132003  300  330  335  340  345 \n2003\u20132004  350  330  335  340  345 \n2004\u20132005  400  380  380  392  398 \n2005\u20132006  415  425 \n2006\u20132007  625  430 \n2007\u20132008  625  625 \n2008\u20132009  950  TBD \nkg = kilogram; TBD = to be determined. \nSource: Official Government of Pakistan Statistics (MINFAL). \n \n12.  Wheat  Prices  in  2009.  In  September  2008,  the  Government  announced  the \nprocurement price (support price) for the 2009 crop of PRs950 per 40 kg. The crop is harvested \nfrom March in Sindh Province and from April in Punjab Province and the other provinces. This \nprocurement price is significantly higher than the 2008 price (PRs625 per 40 kg), and it has had \na positive impact on production. Current 2009 wheat forecasts are for 25 million tons. The \nGovernment indicated that the procurement price was based on cost of production and reflected \nregional and international wheat prices at that time of approximately $360 per ton (US hard red \nwheat grade 2). It did not reflect forecast international wheat price movements. \n \n13.  Since  setting  the  procurement  price,  international  wheat  prices  have  fallen  (to \napproximately $250 per ton, at present), and the procurement price is currently approximately \n$70\u2013$100 per ton above the world price and above the export parity price but below the import \nparity price. This price differential, with a procurement price above the international wheat price, \nhas increased pressure on the Government to undertake higher levels of procurement, and it \nhas imposed financial and logistics burdens on the procurement agencies. In February 2009, \nthe Government announced a wheat import ban. \n ", "  Appendix 8  51 \nUPDATED ENERGY SECTOR BRIEFING NOTE \n \n1.  The acute power shortage in Pakistan is a threat to the social and economic fabric of the \nnation.   Since FY2007, Pakistan has been suffering from an energy crisis caused by a severe \nsupply deficit (reaching up to 5,000 MW peak shortfall in FY 2009). In some places, especially in \nrural areas, there are 10\u201312 hours of load shedding.  Thirty four percent (34%) of the population \nhas no access to electricity from the national grid.  Disruptions in electricity and gas supply are \nfurther  slowing  down  economic  growth  and  global  competitiveness.  Growth  in  2008  was \nconstrained to 5.8%.1  With the shortage of supply it is difficult to increase access to reliable and \naffordable electricity needed.  \n \nA.  Technical \n \n2.  According to the Government's Medium-Term Development Framework (2005\u20132015), if \nthe economy were to grow at 8% per annum, around 2,000 MW of generating capacity would \nneed to be added each year.  New capacity has not been added in line with demand.  There is \n19,420 MW of installed power generation capacity in Pakistan. However, accounting for the \nseasonal nature of hydroelectric plants, gas shortage and closure of some plants, the available \ncapacity  is  around  14,000  MW.  Uncapped  demand  is  estimated  at  21,000  MW.  Larger \ncommercial  customers  are  relying  on  captive  generation,  which  has  raised  their  cost  of \nbusiness, while smaller commercial customers are facing a decline in their productivity due to \nthe unreliability of electricity supply. In FY2009/10, 2,114 MW of new installed capacity is \nexpected  from  independent  power  producers  (IPPs)  and  1,247  MW  from  rental  power \ncontracted for 3\u20135 years. Even with this addition, some shortage is expected and load-shedding \nwould be necessary. \n \n3.  The  energy  system  also  suffers  from  high  transformation  losses.  System-wide \ntransmission losses remain high at 23.4% of dispatched power, despite some improvements in \nrecent years.  Investment in the sector has been inadequate, and ageing plant and equipment \nare hampered by inadequate maintenance in the past.  The Government has developed clear \nroadmaps and investment plans for the power transmission and distribution sectors, which are \nnow  being  implemented  with  financing  assistance  from  development  institutions.  Each \ndistribution company (DISCO) has been given an incentive to reduce their technical losses \nthrough their tariff.   \n \nB.  Governance  \n \n4.  Although good progress has been made in strengthening the financial and corporate \nindependence of the power sector companies after unbundling in 1998, problems continue to \nexist.  Examples of this include: the National Transmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC) \nacting as a borrowing vehicle, which is beyond its transmission company mandate; the cross \nservicing of, and pledging of receivables and other assets to secure debt owed by other entities; \nand central control of cash flows.    \n \n5.  The lack of independence impacts the ability of these public power sector companies to \neffectively perform their mandate (distribute, transmit or generate electricity), maximize the long-\nterm return on assets and attract new investment into the sector through the provision of \ncreditworthy power purchase and other agreements.   Under the current arrangement, there is \nno incentive to improve performance. \n                                                 \n1 Asian Development Bank. 2009.

From 2003\u20132007, customer tariffs were not raised despite the threefold increase in cost.  \nDespite the 20% increase in 2008/09, the extraordinary spike in oil prices accelerated the \npayment arrears to the power generating companies, and plants were not able to operate at \noptimal capacity due to lack of funds to pay for fuel.  These conditions made the environment \ndifficult for increased private investment in power generation through IPPS or rentals.  The \nsituation has improved since the decrease in oil prices and recent steps taken by Government, \nwhich include the adoption of the Power Sector Circular Debt Resolution Plan.   \n \n7.  The  National  Electricity  Power  Regulatory  Board  (NEPRA)  determines  generation, \ntransmission,  distribution  and  retail/wholesale  tariffs.    The  price  is  determined  at  full  cost \nrecovery and agreed profitability. Based on the determination, the Government notifies the \nofficial tariff.  For the retail/wholesale tariff, any difference between the determined and notified \ntariff should be paid by the Government through the tariff differential subsidy. Tariff differential \nsubsidies were to be paid to the DISCOs to make up for the shortfall in the customer tariff and \ncost recovery tariff.  It is estimated that PRs 308 billion of subsidy is owed by the Government. \nWith this and non-payment by public and private customers (PRs226 billion), the DISCOs  \naccumulated PRs407 billion ($5.08 billion) of payables for their electricity purchase from the \nNTDC, being the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA), as of 31 March 2009.   \n \n8.  With Government guarantee, in March/April 2009, NTDC/CPPA had to borrow PRs92 \nbillion from banks to pay the fuel costs of IPPs and government-owned generating companies \n(GENCOs). Total liabilities of NTDC/CPPA owed to these firms, amount to PRs250 billion \n($3.12 billion) as of 31 March 2009.   \n \n9.  Further,  a  total  amount  of  PRs216  billion  of  bank  debt  has  been  accumulated  by \nWAPDA, DISCOs and NTDC to remedy the cash shortfall.  To service this debt, tariffs need to \nbe significantly increased or the Government needs to take over the debt.  IPPs and GENCOs \nalso need to be paid PRs142 billion in cash immediately for them to be able to provide power at \noptimal capacity. \n \nD.  Analysis \n \n10.  For a reliable, sustainable power sector, there is a need for (i) cost recovery tariff, \n(ii) resolution of the accumulated debt, (iii) financial and corporate independence of public power \nsector companies, (iv) establishment of CPPA as an independent entity, and (v) cash injection \ninto  the  IPPs  and  GENCOs  to  cover  fuel,  operating,  and  maintenance  costs  that  are \nimmediately payable.  On the technical side, (i) an updated integrated energy plan, (ii) reduction \nof losses and increase collection in line with the distribution road map, and (iii) continued \naugmentation and improvement of transmission lines based on the transmission road map, \nwould need to be implemented.  The adoption and implementation of the Power Sector Circular \nDebt Resolution Plan by the Government should address many of these issues.   \n ", "  Appendix 9  53 \n \nPOWER SECTOR CIRCULAR DEBT RESOLUTION PLAN \n \n \n \n \n ", "54  Appendix 9 \n \n ", "  Appendix 9  55 \n \n ", "56  Appendix 9 \n \n ", "  Appendix 9  57 \n \n ", "58  Appendix 9 \n \n ", "  Appendix 10  59 \n \nFINANCIAL SECTOR BRIEFING NOTE \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  Structural transformation depends upon an effective and efficient financial sector to \nmobilize savings, help identify good business opportunities, and monitor business performance. \nThe Government is committed to reforming this sector to enable it to become a more inclusive \npart of the Pakistan economy.  \n \n2.  Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been supporting the Government to develop the \nfinancial sector for the last 14 years. ADB\u2019s initial focus was on capital market development,1 \nwhich was later expanded to support development of the nonbank financial sector and to \nimprove access of the poor to the financial sector.2 In 2008, the Government requested ADB to \nprovide assistance for banking sector reforms.3 Strengthening financial governance has become \nmore urgent as a result of the global financial turmoil, which has led to liquidity constraints in the \nbanking system and increased prudential risks. \n \nB.  Bank-Dominated Financial Sector \n \n3.  While efforts have been made to expand the role of the nonbank financial sector in \nPakistan, privately owned banks continue to dominate; overall, banking sector assets comprise \napproximately 72% of total financial sector assets. As reflected in Table A10.3, banks have \nbeen increasing their market share in recent years. However, the rapid credit growth during the \nlast few years has increased the credit risk for this sector. Nonperforming loans increased to \nabout  9.1%  of  loans  outstanding  in  2008  compared  to  7.2%  in  2007.    Banks\u2019  profitability \ndeclined  by    about  27.1%  from  the  previous  year,  reflecting  in  part  growing  provisioning \nrequirements in response to the rise in nonperforming loans. \n \n4.  The sector has also become more diversified. To promote greater economies of scale, \nthere have been 22 bank mergers and 7 bank acquisitions since 2000, most of which involved \nmergers between commercial and investment banks. Groups of affiliated financial sector entities \n(financial conglomerates) are becoming the norm, as banks broaden their product offerings and \nseek cross-selling opportunities. A number of banks also own shares in insurance companies \nand have interests in asset management companies and mutual funds. Some banks engage in \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1995.

Nonbank Finance Companies (NBFCs)  \n \n5.  NBFCs  include  mutual  funds,  private  equity  and  venture  capital  funds,  modarabas, \npension funds, real estate investment trusts, and companies engaged in the businesses of \nleasing, investment banking, house financing, and investment advisory services. In terms of \nasset size, mutual funds constitute 68% of the NBFC subsector. The number of mutual funds \nincreased from 67 in 2007 to 87 (as of 30 June 2008). While NBFCs have been growing, due to \nthe expansion of mutual funds, their share of total financial sector assets continues to decline. \nThe insurance sector has had limited growth. The housing finance sector remains stagnant and \nventure capital development is at an early stage. Universal banking also places pressure on \nNBFCs.  \n \nD.  Capital Market \n \n6.  The capital market in Pakistan includes three stock exchanges, located in Karachi, \nLahore,  and  Islamabad.  The  exchanges  trade  ordinary  shares;  mutual  fund  certificates; \nmodaraba certificates; government and corporate bonds, including sukuk5 and term finance \ncertificates (TFCs). In the capital market, new issues of shares are very limited and private \ncorporate  listed  issues  of  TFCs  and  sukuk  are  of  limited  importance.  Growing  financing \nrequirements of private and public infrastructure investments, particularly in the transportation \nand energy sectors, are likely to remain unmet unless new long-term financing sources are \ndeveloped  outside  the  banking  system.  The  Government\u2019s  Medium-Term  Development \nFramework (2005\u20132010) conservatively estimates that some $150 billion (PRs120 trillion) will \nbe required for such investments over this period.  \n \nE.  Financial Sector Supervision  \n \n7.  Pakistan  has  adopted  an  institutional  approach  to  financial  sector  regulation  and \nsupervision  under  which  a  firm\u2019s  legal  status  determines  which  regulator  is  tasked  with \noverseeing its activity from a safety, soundness, and business conduct perspective. Under this \napproach, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) supervises and regulates banks, development \nfinance  institutions,  microfinance  banks,  and  exchange  companies.  The  Securities  and \nExchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) regulates the nonbank financial sector. Regulatory \napproaches differ\u2014the SBP focuses on prudential regulation and mitigation of systemic risks, \nand the SECP concentrates on investor protection through conduct of business and disclosure \nrequirements.   \n \n8.  Under the Banking Companies Ordinance (1962), banks are deposit-taking institutions \nand can perform all of the functions performed by NBFCs, either directly or through a subsidiary. \nWhen performed through a subsidiary, SECP has jurisdiction over the subsidiary. Due to the \nnascent state of the capital market, a number of NBFCs are engaged in deposit taking, which is \ntraditionally regulated by banking regulators to address prudential risks concerns. These NBFCs \nmobilize short-term funds from the general public and extend working capital and overdraft \nfacilities  to  businesses.  Since  they  are  prohibited  from  undertaking  commercial  banking \n                                                 \n4  Modaraba is a contract in which one party provides capital to another party for the purpose of carrying on a \nbusiness with the stipulation that the profit will be shared by participating parties in clearly defined proportions \nagreed beforehand. Any loss incurred is borne by the capital owner.  \n5  A sukuk is a security resembling a bond but that complies with Islamic law. \n ", "  Appendix 10  61 \n \nactivities, they get around this restriction by issuing withdrawal slips that work like checkbooks. \nA recent scandal involving one of the largest investment banks in Pakistan led the SECP to \nissue a directive to this bank to cease taking deposits.  \n \n9.  NBFCs were previously supervised by the SBP, notwithstanding the absence of enabling \nlegislation providing SBP with sufficient supervisory powers. Since all NBFCs were incorporated \nas companies under the Companies Ordinance (1984), only the SECP appeared to have the \npower  to  take  action  against  these  firms.  Thus,  when  off-site  surveillance  and  on-site \ninspections of NBFCs by SBP highlighted irregularities, SBP had to request SECP to take action \nagainst them. In December 2002, the Companies Ordinance was amended to clarify SECP\u2019s \njurisdiction over NBFCs. That jurisdiction was thus transferred from SBP. The amendments \nallowed NBFCs to offer a range of financial products in order to encourage single-product \nNBFCs serving a specific market niche to merge. There was limited consolidation of NBFC \nactivities, however, even as banks started making rapid inroads into this area. At the time of \ntheir transfer from SBP to SECP, there were 16 investment banks, compared with 8 at present.  \n \nF.  Government Reform Agenda \n \n10.  In the mid- to late-1990s, the Government undertook major financial sector reforms. \nBased on the institutional approach to regulation, reforms focused on institutional versus sector-\nwide issues.  \n \n11.  Banking  sector.  Prior  to  the  Government\u2019s  reform  program,  state-owned  banks \ncomprised 80% of the banking sector and were characterized by poor performance and high \nnonperforming loans (often in excess of 70%). Financing for small and medium enterprises and \nmicrofinance was nonexistent. Under the reform agenda, banking sector performance was \nfacilitated by privatization; restructuring of major banks; consolidation; strengthening of the \nregulatory and supervisory framework and related capacity; and improvements in transparency, \ncorporate governance, and the credit culture. Reforms included adopting international best \npractice standards for risk management and money laundering (see discussion below).  \n \n12.  As  a  result  of  the  successful  reform  agenda,  the  private  sector  now  accounts  for \napproximately 81% of the banking sector. Access to financial services has increased. Banking \nsector assets rose by 50% over the last 3 years and the industry\u2019s assets now exceed PRs5 \ntrillion. There has been a major improvement in the sector\u2019s profitability and financial strength. \nReturn on banking assets after taxes rose from 0.1% in 2002 to 1.2% in 2008. Return on equity \nincreased from 3.2% in 2002 to 11.3% in 2008. The SBP introduced Basel II and banks have \nhigher capital adequacy levels that are well above the minimum level for the sector as a whole. \nDespite  economic  shock  and  stress  in  the  stock  market,  the  banking  system  has  shown \nincreased profitability in the first quarter of 2009.  \n \n13.  SBP is implementing payment and settlement system reforms. In July 2008, the SBP \nlaunched the Pakistan Real Time Interbank Settlement Mechanism (PRISM), which is the real \ntime gross settlement system for wholesale payment transactions. The system is designed to \nhandle all large-value payments. Preliminary work has also started on modernizing the retail \npayment  and  settlement  system  to  encourage  electronic  and  mobile  telephone-based \ntransactions. SBP is working with a wide range of stakeholders to promote the use of efficient \nelectronic payment instruments that includes a high level of standardization, schemes that allow \nstraight-through  processing  and  development  of  infrastructure  for  new  retail  payment \ninstruments, and alternative channels for making payments.  \n \n ", "62  Appendix 10 \n \n14.  To guide its reform agenda over the longer term, the SBP adopted and launched a 10-\nyear strategy to broaden and deepen the banking sector. The objectives of the strategy are to \nmake the banking sector (i) more responsive to the needs of the economy and thus help \nachieve a more rapid and sustainable economic growth; (ii) financially stronger, more resilient, \nand stable; (iii) better regulated and supervised; and (iv) more efficient and stable. \n  \n15.  Nonbank Financial Sector. Pakistan has made progress with capital market reforms \nsince 1998, when a year-long economic crisis had resulted in a stock market crash. A new \nregulator, the SECP was established to help develop the capital markets.6  \n \n16.  With support from ADB, SECP has undertaken a number of regulatory, supervisory, and \nmarket-reform  initiatives,  including  risk  management  measures  and  introduction  of  new \nproducts. Equity capitalization has improved, and Pakistan\u2019s stock market has been one of the \nbest performing markets since the start of 2008. Nevertheless, and although the stock market \ncapitalization has shown spectacular increases in recent years,7 the market does not play a \nmajor intermediary role. There have been few new listings and stock values declined sharply in \n2008. The private debt securities market remains rudimentary in scope. The government debt \nmarket has grown in recent years to meet the Government\u2019s growing financing needs, but the \nframework for issuing, pricing, and trading government securities remains underdeveloped. The \ngrowth of NBFCs continues to lag that of banks. \n \n17.  Preventing Money Laundering. The Government is strongly committed to safeguard \nthe  financial  sector  from  being  used  to  launder  the  proceeds  from  criminal  activities.  In \nfurtherance thereof, Pakistan has become a member of the Asia Pacific Group on Money \nLaundering,  a  regional  body  associated  with  the  Financial  Action  Task  Force  on  Money \nLaundering  (FATF).  FATF  sets  international  standards  for  global  efforts  in  anti-money \nlaundering and countering the financing of terrorism. The FATF 40+9 recommendations set \nforth international standards. In September 2007, Pakistan adopted an Anti-Money Laundering \n(AML) Ordinance that establishes its framework for AML activities and establishes the Financial \nMonitoring Unit (FMU) in the SBP to receive and process reports on suspicious activities.  \n \n18.  Ongoing Issues in Financial Sector Development. Notwithstanding reform initiatives, \nfinancial sector indicators in Pakistan continue to lag behind those of other countries. Key \nissues in the financial sector8 include the following: \n(i)  Investor and depositor protection. The legislation establishing the SBP and \nthe  SECP,  respectively,  do  not  provide  for  the  level  of  independence  and \naccountability arrangements needed to enable these institutions to effectively \n                                                 \n6 The capital market includes three stock exchanges, a national clearing and settlement system, a central depository, \nand 449 NBFCs (as of 2007). NBFCs include leasing companies, investment banks, discount houses, housing \nfinance companies, and mutual funds. The state-owned Central Directorate of National Savings is the largest \ninstitutional investor in Pakistan, followed by the State Life Insurance Company and Employees' Old Age Benefits \nInstitution.  \n7  The global financial crisis, macroeconomic conditions, political uncertainty, and implementation of a pricing floor at \nthe  Karachi  Stock  Exchange  (KSE)  in  2008  have  badly  hurt  the  stock  market.  Subsequent  government \ninterventions have helped stabilize the market. Based on deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and security \nconcerns, and a related decline in the share trading prices on the KSE, KSE management imposed a floor on \nexchange traded prices in August 2008. While the floor halted a further drop in share trading prices, once it was \nlifted the benchmark KSE 100 index continued to decline. During 2008, Pakistani stock lost 55% of its value. In \nJanuary 2009, to stabilize the market, the government-owned National Investment Trust (NIT), the country's largest \nasset management company, helped establish the NIT State Enterprise Fund to invest PRs20 billion into the stock \nmarket.  \n8  Included here are issues reflected in the AETP that ADB is helping the Government to address.  \n ", "  Appendix 10  63 \n \nfulfill  their  assigned  functions,  address  the  blurring  of  product  lines  and  the \nemergence  of  financial  conglomerates,  or  provide  an  effective  enforcement \nframework to deter and address violations. The recent global financial market \nturmoil and the privately owned structure of the banking system also highlight the \nurgent need for a financial safety net to deal with contagion and systemic risks. \nThis includes depositor protection, liquidity, and lender of last resort facilities in \nthe SBP; an exit framework to deal effectively with bank failures in a way that \nstrengthens the banking system; and improved coordination mechanisms within \nthe Government in cases of systemic problems.   \n(ii)  Regulatory arbitrage. NBFCs that take deposits are subject to lower prudential \nregulations  imposed  by  the  SECP,  thus  raising  concerns  about  regulatory \narbitrage. Lending limits by banks that are part of a financial conglomerate may \nbe circumvented by directing loans to NBFCs that take deposits. There is also \npublic confusion about the role of the SBP in supervising NBFCs, since many \ninvestment banks use the word \u201cbank\u201d in their names.  \n(iii)  Payment  system.  Although  Pakistan  has  made  progress  in  developing \nelectronic  payments,  the  existing  retail  payment  system  is  largely  based  on \nchecks and cash. SBP has requested ADB support in this area to accelerate \nefforts to take advantage of new technologies and prevent a proliferation of \nincompatible systems by developing and implementing an overall strategy in this \narea.  \n(iv)  FMU  autonomy.  The  AML  Ordinance  provides  for  a  cumbersome  FMU \nsupervisory structure consisting of a national executive committee and a general \ncommittee. The national executive committee includes relevant ministers, the \nSBP Governor, the SECP chairman, and the director general of the FMU. The \ngeneral  committee  includes  principal  civil  servants  from  the  ministries \nrepresented  at  the  national  executive  committee,  the  SBP  governor,  SECP \nchairman, and the director general of the FMU. While the general committee is \nintended to provide assistance to the national level committee in implementing \nthe law, it is unclear how this structure is supposed to work in practice. The two-\nprong structure appears bureaucratic and may be cumbersome to implement. \nThe law also envisages that the director general of the FMU will be supervised \nand controlled by the general committee, which is inconsistent with international \nstandards. The FMU also needs to be financially and operationally autonomous.   \n ", "64  Appendix 10 \n \n \nTable A10.1: Asset Composition of the Financial Sector \n \nItem  2001  2005  2007  2008 \nAssets (PRs billion)  3,042.7  5,201.5  7,115.2  7,646.6 \nGrowth rate (%)    15.1  19.4  7.5 \n% of total assets         \n    MFIs  0.1  0.2  0.2  0.2 \n    NBFIs  6.6  7.6  8.0  8.0 \n    Insurance  3.7  3.9  4.6  5.5 \n    CDNS  25.8  18.0  114.6  14.2 \n    Banks  63.8  70.4  72.7  72.1 \n% of GDP         \n    MFIs  0.0  0.1  0.1  0.1 \n    NBFIs  4.7  5.6  5.9  5.9 \n    Insurance  2.6  2.9  3.4  4.0 \n    CDNS  18.1  13.3  10.8  10.3 \n    Banks  44.8  51.8  53.9  52.6 \n    Overall  70.2  73.7  74.1  73.0 \nCDNS = central directorate of national savings, GDP = gross domestic product, MFIs = microfinance institutions; \nNBFIs = nonbank financial institutions. \nSource: State Bank of Pakistan. 2008.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nThe  pro-poor  component  of  the  Program  focuses  on  the  transition  from  untargeted  subsidies  toward  targeted \ninterventions to the poor and the vulnerable. The scope is in line with Pakistan\u2019s second poverty reduction strategy \n(PRSP II) and ADB\u2019s Country Partnership Strategy. \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  PRSP  II  covers  a  3-year  period  from  FY2009  to  FY2011.  Its  overall  vision  is  to  regain \nmacroeconomic  stability  and  attain  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  of  7%  by  FY2013;  create  adequate \nemployment  opportunities;  improve  income  distribution;  and  enhance  global  competitiveness  through  economic \nliberalization, deregulation, and transparent privatization. PRSP II is built upon nine pillars: (i) macroeconomic stability \nand real sector growth, (ii) protecting the poor and the vulnerable, (iii) increasing productivity and value addition in \nagriculture, (iv) an integrated energy development program, (v) making industry internationally competitive, (vi) human \ndevelopment for the 21st century, (vii) removing bottlenecks through public-private partnerships, (viii) capital and \nfinance for development, and (ix) governance for a just and fair system. To support the second pillar, protecting the \npoor and the vulnerable, the Government has taken steps to improve the social safety system and is implementing a \nmajor new cash transfer system for the poorest, the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP). The Program supports \nthe expansion and improvement of targeted social safety net interventions to the poor and vulnerable under BISP. \n \nADB is a leading partner in addressing governance and institutional bottlenecks, as well as binding constraints to \ntransformation and growth. During the country partnership strategy period, ADB will focus on structural transformation, \nincluding reforms in energy and financial markets. Policy distortions and institutional impediments continue to constrain \nthe structural transformation of the economy. These limit growth and investment. In the agriculture sector, for example, \npublic interventions distort the wheat market and create disincentives for farmers to raise production. This has been \ndetrimental to food security and has resulted in a need to import wheat at a time of high prices, adversely affecting the \nbalance of payments position. In the power sector, inefficient and unfunded subsidies and the accumulated problem of \ncircular debt seriously undermine investment, leading to major power shortages that have become a constraint on \nindustrial production. In the financial sector, weak governance impedes the development of long-term financial \ninstruments. This restricts growth in domestic savings. Consequently, savings have been insufficient to finance \ndomestic investment and the savings\u2013investment gap has increased. The Program supports interventions that enable \nthe reduction or abolishment of federal subsidies for wheat and energy, given the development of targeted safety nets. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                        Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention, TI-H \n1.  Key Issues  \nBetween FY2003 and FY2008, Pakistan experienced a period of macroeconomic stability and strong economic growth, \nwhich accelerated from 4.4% in FY2003 to an average 8.1% during FY2004 and FY2005, reached an all-time high of \n9% in FY2006, then maintained high growth at 6.5% and 7% in FY2007 and FY2008, respectively. Efforts were made \nduring this period to redirect a larger share of total public spending to social services and to poor and vulnerable \ngroups. Poverty-related expenditures grew from 3% of GDP in FY2003 to 5.7% of GDP in FY2008. In addition, the \ninflow of foreign remittances rose substantially. Between 2002 and 2008, an inflow of more than $31 billion, or 18.7% of \nGDP, was attributable to remittances. All these factors combined (robust growth, macroeconomic stability, rising \npoverty expenditures, and high remittances from overseas Pakistanis) contributed to a decline in poverty\u2019s incidence in \nPakistan. Poverty estimates based on the FY2006 Pakistan Socioeconomic Living Standard Measurement Survey \nindicated a decline of people living below the poverty line1 from 34.5% in FY2001 to 22.3% in FY2006.  \n \nThe lack of new poverty data after FY2006 does not permit an assessment of the present poverty situation, but it is to \nbe expected that poverty started increasing again in FY2009 with the high domestic inflation caused by high food and \nenergy prices. Household expenditure surveys indicate the average share of food in total expenditures is inversely \n                                                 \n1  The poverty line is based on a threshold of 2,350 calories per adult equivalent per day, using the calorific approach \nfor estimation. \n ", "Appendix 13  69 \n \nrelated to income levels. A sharp rise in food prices can have a devastating effect on the poor. In Pakistan, food prices \nwent up by more than 20% in the first quarter of 2008. ADB\u2019s analysis2 shows that a 10% increase in food prices can \nthrow an additional 7 million into poverty in Pakistan, a 20% increase 14.7 million, and a 30% increase an additional 22 \nmillion. While energy prices also went up by about 30% in the first quarter of 2008, the rise in poverty incidence is \nestimated to be much smaller at about 1.5 percentage points. ADB\u2019s analysis also shows that if every poor person \nwere to be compensated to offset the loss in real expenditure, the Government could incur a cost of between PRs18.5 \nbillion (0.3% of GDP) and PRs83 billion (1.3% of GDP). \n2. Design Features \nThis Program will directly benefit the poor. The impact will be through two principal mechanisms: (i) safety net support \nfor poor households; and (ii) targeting electricity subsidies. The Program will support the transition from untargeted to \ntargeted support to the poor and vulnerable through expansion of the social safety net program, making it more \nefficient to protect the poor and vulnerable from the adverse impact of recent global developments. Specifically, 5 \nmillion poor families (up to 6 persons per family on average) will benefit from the BISP under AETP2. As part of the \ncluster, the BISP will cover 7 million poor families by June 2010. Hence, potentially the Program will help direct benefits \nto up to 42 million poor people in Pakistan. Further, the Program will help generate a significant amount of fiscal space \nby targeting electricity and wheat subsidies. \nA.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n \n1.  Discuss the impact channels of the policy reform(s) to the country and major groups affected. \n \nThe Program will provide significant benefits in general, and directed benefits for the poor in particular.  \n\u2022  First, it will help the Government to meet large and immediate fiscal needs.  \n\u2022  Second, the Program will assist the Government to transition from inefficient and untargeted subsidies to targeted \nsafety net programs for the poor. In FY2009, budget provisions were made to target 5 million households under \nfederal government cash transfer programs (of which, resources were provided for up to  3.5 million families \nunder BISP). In FY2010, the budget allocation will be increased to support up to 5 million families under BISP as \na policy condition under AETP2. Subsequently, for the next phase, the Government will target up to 7 million \nfamilies. \n\u2022  Third, the Program will raise public confidence through stronger financial intermediaries that are better able to \nmobilize and allocate resources and risks.  \n\u2022  Fourth, the Program will open the way for structural transformation. \n\u2022  Overall, the Program will enable ADB to sustain policy dialogue on structural reform in sectors where ADB has \nbeen actively involved through past and current investments.  \n \n2.  Discuss the impact of the policy reform(s) on vulnerable groups and ways to address it/them (refer to social \nanalysis). \n \nThe Government is expanding the coverage of its social safety net programs from a targeted 5 million households in \nFY2009 to 5 million families under BISP in FY2010. The Government has agreed to use the local currency generated \nfrom the proceeds of the ADF loan to support poor and vulnerable families under the new BISP. One of BISP\u2019s \nqualification criteria is that the household income should be below PRs6,000. The monthly benefit is equal to PRs1,000 \nper month, a substantial increase of the monthly income. This would allow a household to finance 20\u201325 days of flour \nneeds for a 5\u20136 member family. The payout will not alleviate poverty, but it will protect the nutrition intake to a large \nextent during the series of shocks from sharp increases in food and fuel prices last year and the ongoing global \nfinancial crisis.  \n \nThe Government is committed to move toward market-based wheat pricing and an efficient reserve management \nsystem. The transition will be gradual, reflecting the need to maintain price stability for producers and consumers until \nbetter targeted and more efficient safety net programs become fully operational. An efficiently functioning safety net \nprogram will eliminate the need for continuing the existing untargeted wheat subsidy. The current untargeted subsidy is \nlargely going to flour millers. Discontinuation of the wheat subsidy would cause millers to pay the market price. This \nwould involve significant structural change in the flour milling industry and a likely expansion in private sector storage \ncapacity. The Government\u2019s strategic reserves could provide supply security to minimize risk of collusion in price \ndetermination at the local level.   \n \nSpecific policies are needed to deal with the root causes and consequences of high energy prices. For FY2009, the \nGovernment budgeted a PRs65 billion subsidy for tariff differential and decided to completely eliminate this subsidy by \nnext fiscal year. It is estimated that an additional 5% increase in power tariff is required to eliminate the subsidy. This \nincrease is expected to scarcely affect the poverty incidence (see key issues). \n                                                                                                                                                          \n2  ADB.

Discuss how the policy reform(s) contribute(s) to poverty reduction, pro-poor growth, and the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. \nThe challenge to alleviate poverty remains huge. Pakistan, being a signatory to the Millennium Development Goals, is \ncommitted to achieving the target for poverty by halving the poverty incidence between 1990 and 2015. The estimated \n1990 level of poverty in Pakistan was 26%. Thus, this needs to move to 13% by 2015 if the target is to be met. With the \nlatest poverty estimates (FY2006) at 22.3%, there is clearly still a long way to go. The poverty problem, therefore, is not \nabout to be immediately eliminated and will require sustained efforts. Key to ensuring long-term success of the \nGovernment\u2019s poverty reduction strategy and programs will be continued and consistent pursuit of pro-poor growth \npolicies, along with accompanying investments and a focus on the effectiveness of investment spending, plus forging \nlong-term and constructive partnerships with the private sector, civil society, and development institutions.    \n \nThe combined impact of the jump in food and fuel prices and the global financial crisis could pose a substantial setback \nin the fight against poverty and further jeopardize the  already slow progress toward achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. Prompt and well-targeted policy responses can substantially reduce the depth, length, and long-\nterm impact of these sudden economic shocks. The expansion of targeted safety net interventions could provide short-\nrun assistance against income shocks and protect the nutrition intake. Good safety nets require workable systems for \nenrolling beneficiaries, making payments, and monitoring. The most effective interventions will be those that target \npeople who are the most vulnerable to income declines and most exposed to the crisis. The Government decided to \nrefine its targeting method using poverty score cards. Under the BISP program, the score card method was piloted in \n10 districts in FY2009, and it will be rolled out in the coming fiscal year to all districts. The other safety net programs \nwould eventually use the same targeting method. With the introduction of BISP, the Government opted for direct cash \ntransfers which have low administrative costs and do not distort prices. The fiscal implications of public interventions \nmay seem daunting, particularly given the public spending stresses already experienced by Pakistan. But the fiscal \ncosts of well-targeted interventions for the poorest need not be unduly high, especially compared to the present and \nfuture costs of not having them in place. For a large share of developing countries, spending on overall safety nets has \nbeen on the order of 1\u20132% of GDP in recent years. Critically, the future costs associated with not taking action are \nlikely to be many times higher than the savings from inaction.  \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \nThe poor and the vulnerable are the primary beneficiaries of the targeted interventions through social safety net \nprograms. Based on the FY2006 poverty assessment, 22.3% of the population, or roughly 35 million people, are living \nunder the poverty line. Estimates of the incidence of vulnerability range between 47% and 67%. The vulnerable include \nboth the chronically poor and the transitorily poor (those around or just below the poverty line). The vulnerable in \nPakistan typically include the landless and the homeless; widows, and especially those with dependents and no \nsupport; women and children from poor households; low-caste and marginalized ethnic groups and minorities; those \nwithout access to health and education and dependent on charitable donations for subsistence; and the politically \ndisenfranchised. About one third of the entire population is vulnerable due to low levels of resources, while for 24% to \n34% of the population vulnerability to poverty stems from high volatility of consumption. Vulnerability is concentrated in \nrural areas and is mainly caused by low levels of consumption.  \n \nWheat is the main staple in Pakistan. Given the large population of poor and low-income earners (small-scale \nproducers and consumers), wheat price stabilization has been a long-term government policy objective. Half of \nPakistan\u2019s population is considered to be \"food insecure.\u201d Food security is measured in terms of physical access to \nfood (or its availability), economic access to food, and biological utilization of food (food absorption). Many studies note \nthat in Pakistan physical availability of food (including wheat flour) may not be the main issue, but rather that \nconsumers are constrained by poverty, as their low incomes impede their ability to use food adequately to obtain \nbalanced and proper nutrition.  \n \nThe Program will assist the Government in ensuring food availability and access to wheat flour, and especially for the \npoor and vulnerable groups. The key agenda for action includes to (i) develop social safety net programs targeting the \npoor and vulnerable with cash transfers, and (ii) move toward market-based wheat pricing.  \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nExtensive consultations were conducted with the Government, including the Ministry of Finance; Ministry of Industries; \nMinistry of Commerce; Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Livestock; Ministry of Labor, Manpower, and Overseas \nPakistanis; State Bank of Pakistan; Planning Commission; Board of Investment; Privatization Commission; Engineering \nDevelopment Board, and the Prime Minister\u2019s Secretariat responsible for the Benazir Income Support Program; with \nthe private sector (including ABN/AMRO, KPMG, McKinsey); and with other development partners (including the \nUnited Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank). \n \n2.

Strong \ncoordination and decision-making abilities are vital for the Program. The Secretary of Finance is steering the Program. \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.   Key Issues. Gender inequality continues to be an area of concern in Pakistan. Limited access to income-\ngenerating opportunities, together with a range of life cycle risks related to malnutrition, school non-attendance, \nmarriage and dowry, pregnancy and child birth, and widowhood has left women considerably more vulnerable to \npoverty than men. This results in increasing feminization of poverty.         \n2.  Key Actions.

BISP will provide \nADB with an update on the progress In issuing these cards in quarterly utilization reports. The ultimate aim of the \nGovernment is to devise programs that also support graduation from the safety net through income generation and \nsustainable livelihoods. \nIII.
