It will enable people to resume their normal lives by restoring \naccess  to  basic  services.  The  project  design  is  based  on  the  joint \ndamage and needs assessment undertaken in September 2004 by \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  World  Bank  in  close \ncoordination  and  consultation  with  the  Government.  The  Project \nsupports \nit \nincludes  capacity  building  and  training  in  infrastructure  design \nstandards  and  assistance  to  enhance  existing  early  warning \nsystems.  \n \nThe  devastating  2004 \nto \ninfrastructure  and  other  assets,  and  disrupted  economic  activities, \ninflicting  heavy  losses  to  agricultural  and  industrial  output  and \nslowed down expansion in services. Based on the joint ADB-World \nBank  damage  and  needs  assessment,  the  combined  losses  to \nassets  and  output  amounted  to  at  least  $2.3  billion,  constituting \n3.9%  of  gross  domestic  product.  The  flooding  also  set  back \nprogress  achieved  in  poverty  reduction,  with  the  poor  and  the \nvulnerable  suffering  most  in  terms  of  losses  to  crops,  livestock, \nproperty and housing, and reduced income opportunities. While the \nflood-related  damage  to  small-scale  enterprises,  export-oriented \nknitwear industry, jute, leather, and frozen foods are likely to affect \nexport growth, imports will come under mounting pressures due to \nthe  sharp  rise  in  post-flood  imports  of  food  grains,  medicines,  and \nconstruction  materials.  The  widened  current  account  deficit  will \ndeplete  foreign  exchange  reserves,  requiring  additional  assistance \nto reduce the external financial gap.  \n \nCurrent  expenditures  will  exceed  the  budgeted  target  for  FY2005, \nwith  increased  expenditures  for  relief  efforts,  expansion  of  food-\nassisted  safety  nets,  operation  and  maintenance  of  infrastructure, \nassistance  to  flood-affected  farmers  for  commencing  production \nand manufacturing sector for rehabilitation, and grants to dislocated \npeople. The revenue outturn for FY2005 will be lower than expected \n\nflooding  caused  severe  damage \n\n\fii\n\n \n\n \nObjectives and Scope \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \n\nfrom \n\nthe  Government \n\ndue  to  the  flood-induced  shrinkage  in  the  tax  base.  Even  with \ndiversion  of  resources  by \nlow-priority \ndevelopment  projects  to  post-flood  rehabilitation  of  infrastructure, \nthe gap in financing needs is estimated to be $670 million to $715 \nmillion,  depending  on  the  level  of  improved  standards  applied \nduring repair and rehabilitation. By providing financing for the most \nurgently needed components and works, complementing assistance \nby  other  financiers,  the  Project  will  enable  the  Government  to \nfinance  a  portion  of  the  overall  recovery  program,  as  well  as  help \nrestore  the  economic  activity  essential  for  recovery  of  affected \nareas.  \n \nThe  objective  is  to  contribute  to  sustainable  economic  growth  by \nminimizing the devastating impact of severe floods. This is essential \nto  enable  early  restoration  of  economic  and  social  activity  in  the \naffected  areas,  especially  for  the  poor.  The  Project  will  focus  on \npriority areas, identified through consultation with the Government, \npublic  and  private  sector,  nongovernment  organizations,  and  other \ncivil  society;  and  involve  community  participation.  The  Project \nincludes  capacity  building  and \nthe \nGovernment\u2019s  disaster  preparedness  by  adopting  flood-resistant \ninfrastructure  design  standards,  and  analytical  input  and  capacity \nbuilding to enhance early warning systems. \n\nto  strengthen \n\ntraining \n\n \n\nPart  A:  Rural  Infrastructure.  Support  rehabilitation  of  flood-\ndamaged rural infrastructure, including rural roads (damaged paved \nupazila  and  union  roads),  bridges,  and  culverts.  Rehabilitate \nexisting flood and cyclone shelters and provide them with latrines to \nhelp communities, especially the poor, in future floods. \n \nPart B: Roads. Rehabilitate flood-damaged national, regional, and \ndistrict (zilla) roads, bridges, and culverts.  \n \nPart  C:  Railways.  Restore  flood-damaged  rail  infrastructure  and \nfacilities  on  the  core  rail  network,  including  civil  works  to  restore \nembankments,  tracks,  bridges,  essential  buildings,  station  roads, \nand signaling and telecommunications facilities.  \n \nPart D: Water Resources. Rehabilitate flood control, drainage, and \nirrigation  facilities,  including  repair  of  embankment  breaches,  and \nrehabilitation  of  water  control  structures,  protective  works,  and \ncanals.  \n \nPart  E:  Municipal  Infrastructure.  Rehabilitate  (i)  roads,  drains, \nbridges,  and  culverts;  and  (ii)  footpaths  and  drains  in  the  slums, \nlocated in about 55 municipalities (pourashavas) in six divisions.  \n \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $240.0  million \nequivalent.  Of  this,  $73.8  million,  or  30.8%  of  the  total  cost,  is  the \nforeign  exchange  cost,  and  $166.2  million  equivalent,  or  69.2%,  is \n\n\f \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms \n\nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agencies \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n \n\n \n\niii\n\nthe local currency cost.

In absence \nof  a  firm  commitment  for  cofinancing  from  potential  cofinanciers\u2014\nSida (Part A) and the Netherlands (Part D)\u2014ADB will provide a loan \nunder an umbrella or standby financing mechanism, whereby ADB \ncommits  for  an  $180  million  loan  but  cancels  a  portion  of  its  loan \nwhen grant financing becomes available later from the Netherlands \nand/or Sida. \n \nThe  proposed  ADB  loan  is  for  SDR  117,195,000.00  ($180  million \nequivalent) from the Special Funds Resources. The loan will have a \n40-year term including a grace period of 10 years, an interest rate \nof 1% per year, and repayment of principal at 2% per annum for the \nfirst 10 years after the grace period and 4% per annum thereafter.  \n \nUntil 31 July 2007  \n \nUntil 31 January 2007  \n\n \nInfrastructure\u2014Local  Government  Engineering \nPart  A:  Rural \nDepartment,  Part  B:  Roads\u2014Roads  and  Highways  Department, \nPart  C:  Railways\u2014Bangladesh  Railway,  Part  D:  Water \nResources\u2014Bangladesh  Water  Development  Board,  Part  E: \nEngineering \nMunicipal \nDepartment \n \nEach  Executing  Agency  (EA)  will  be  responsible  for  implementing \nits  respective  part  of  the  Project,  which  consists  of  a  series  of \nsubprojects,  through  the  established  Project  Management  Unit. \nProject  coordination  will  be  provided  by  the  established  Project \n\nInfrastructure\u2014Local \n\nGovernment \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\nthe  member \n\n(PSC)  chaired  by \n\nfor \nSteering  Committee \nprogramming,  Planning  Commission  of  the  Ministry  of  Planning. \nThe PSC will monitor implementation, oversee governance matters, \nresolve  interagency  issues  and  procedural  matters,  and  ensure \nfunding.  The  Project  will  have  strengthened \ncounterpart \nanticorruption measures, including strict financial management and \nmonitoring,  performance  auditing,  random  spot  checks,  and \ndelegation  of  project  administration  to  the  Bangladesh  Resident \nMission.  \n \nProcurement  of  goods,  related  services,  and  civil  works  will  be \nfinanced  from  the  ADB  loan  except  for  cofinanced  grant  funds  for \nparts  A  and  D,  which,  if  confirmed,  will  be  administered  by  ADB. \nProcurement  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Since \nthe  value  of  civil  works  contracts  will  be  relatively  small  and \nscattered  over  a  wide  range  of  the  affected  areas  in  Bangladesh, \nthey  are  not  likely  to  attract  international  contractors.  Local \nprocurement  of  civil  works  will  follow  the  Government\u2019s  Public \nProcurement  Regulations  (2003)  acceptable  to  ADB.  This  will  not \npreclude  international  contractors  participating  in  the  bidding.  To \nencourage  participation  of  local  communities,  especially  women, \nsmall  earthworks  and  similar  works,  estimated  to  cost  $8,000  or \nless,  may  be  awarded  to  labor-contracting  societies  in  accordance \nwith  standard  procurement  procedures  followed  by  each  EA. \nAdvance action for procurement and retroactive financing of eligible \nexpenditures were approved by ADB effective 12 September 2004 \nsubject to ADB approval of the loan.   \n \nThe  Project  will  require  250  person-months  of  international  and \n2,200  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services.  Consultants \nand consulting firms will be recruited under ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for \nengaging  domestic  consultants.  In  view  of  the  urgency  and  the \nneed  to  expedite  project  implementation,  consultants  will  be \nengaged through direct selection procedures as provided for under \nthe guidelines. At the request of the Government, ADB will assist in \nthe direct selection process.  \n \nImmediate  benefits  are  the  restoration  of  rural  and  municipal \nservices  and  rehabilitated  infrastructure  serving  the  millions  of \ninhabitants, including the poor, in the flood-affected areas. \n \nConsidering  the  extent  of  damage  and  asset  losses,  the  cost  of \nrehabilitating public infrastructure and facilities are exorbitant for the \nGovernment  and  for  the  local  communities.  Support  in  terms  of \nfinancial  assistance,  adoption  of  appropriate  flood-resistant  design \nstandards,  and  strengthening  of  disaster  preparedness  and \nmitigation will be of considerable benefit in protecting the poor and \naffected people from falling further into poverty. It will help families \nresettle,  provide  a  safer  and  healthier  environment,  and  stabilize \nlivelihoods.  \n\n\f \n \n\nv\n\nfor \n\ninfrastructure, \n\nincreases  health  risks,  especially \n\n \nDisasters, including severe floods, disproportionately affect the poor \nin  terms  of  health,  housing,  employment,  livelihood,  and  food \nsecurity.  The  damaged  public  infrastructure  prevents  adequate \naccess  to  health  and  education  facilities  and  markets.  Damaged \nincluding  waste  and \nmunicipal  and  community \nsewage \nthe \nfacilities, \nvulnerable  and  the  poor.  By  rehabilitating  public  and  community \ninfrastructure,  the  Project  will  help  restore  critical  social  and \neconomic activities disrupted by the 2004 floods. \n \nThe Project is expected to provide about 12 million person-days of \nemployment  to  local  skilled  and  unskilled  labor.  The  Project \nencourages  and  provides  for  the  engagement  of  women  in \nrehabilitating rural and municipal infrastructure.  \n \nThe project benefits will be evident through economic rehabilitation \nand  access  to  basic  services  arising  from  speedy  rehabilitation  of \ninfrastructure  and  facilities,  supporting  restoration  of  livelihoods, \nespecially for the poor.   \n \nA  potential  risk  is  that  procedural  delays  in  obtaining  various \nGovernment  approvals  will  slow  implementation.  The  Government \nhas  shown  strong  commitment  to  the  Project,  and  has  adopted \nsimplified  procedures,  which  were  successfully  used  in  past  ADB-\nfinanced flood damage rehabilitation projects. The selection of EAs \nimplementing  ADB-financed \nwith  considerable  experience \nprojects,  and  sufficient  capacity  and \nfamiliarity  with  ADB \nprocedures,  implementation  by  established  project  management \nunits, and use of existing or directly selected consultants minimizes \ndelay at the EA level. The availability of counterpart funding has not \nbeen a problem to date in ADB projects in Bangladesh and ongoing \nInternational Monetary Fund and World Bank support will generate \nadequate counterpart funds.  \n \nThe  risk  of  governance-related  issues  including  corruption  is \naddressed by detailed selection criteria; transparent implementation \nand  monitoring  mechanisms;  and  specific \nfinancial  controls, \nincluding regular as well as random audits and the use of external \nauditors. Measures include enhanced construction supervision and \nthe  Public  Procurement \nconsultant  support,  strict  use  of \nRegulations,  close  monitoring  by  Bangladesh  Resident  Mission \nstaff, and random procurement and performance auditing at the EA \nlevel.  The  PSC  will  be  supported  by  monitoring  and  evaluation \nspecialists  from  the  Implementation,  Monitoring,  and  Evaluation \nDivision  of  the  Planning  Commission.  In  addition,  an  external \nconsultant  will  be  engaged  under  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  to \nprovide  support  for  financial  management  and  monitoring, with  the \nspecific  task  of  helping  monitor  all  project  activities  and  conduct \nspecific random and spot checks from time to time.  \n \n\nin \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nTechnical Assistance  \n\nADB  will  provide  a  TA  grant  of  $150,000  to  support  financial \nmanagement  and  monitoring.

The  unique  disposition  of  land,  water,  and \npeople  in  relation  to  climate  has  resulted  in  an  unusual  pattern  and  frequency  of  disasters. \nBecause Bangladesh is 1 of the 10 most densely populated countries in the world, major floods \ncause  damage  and  losses  on  a  massive  scale;  since  1904  floods  have  affected  cumulatively \naround  339  million  inhabitants  and  caused  more  than  $9  billion  in  damage  to  infrastructure.1 \nComparison of different hazards in Bangladesh illustrates that cyclones have the most dramatic \nconsequences. Riverbank erosion is in second place, not in terms of deaths, but in terms of the \nprocess  of  impoverishment  and  landlessness  of  the  many  people  affected.  The  number  of \ndeaths during monsoon floods, even during extraordinary floods, is comparatively small.2 While \nBangladesh experiences normal floods almost every year, the incidence of extreme floods has \nincreased  over  time.  During  the  last  two  decades,  the  country  experienced  three  major \ndevastating  floods  in  1988,  1998,  and  2004  (Table  1).3  Details  on  floods  and  other  natural \ndisasters in Bangladesh are given in Appendix 2.   \n\n \n\nTable 1: Major Floods in Bangladesh \n\n \nItem \nInundated Area of Bangladesh (%) \nDuration of Flood (days) \nPeople Affected (million) \nTotal Deaths (people) \nCrops Damaged (million hectares) \nRice Production Losses (million tons)  \nRoads Damaged (kilometers) \nNumber of Homes Fully/Partly Damaged (million) \nTotal Losses (Tk billion) \nSources:  Ministry  of  Fisheries  and  Livestock;  Papers  from  the  National  Workshop  on  Options  for  Flood  Risk  and \nDamage Reduction in Bangladesh, September 7- 9, 2004; Asian Development Bank and World Bank estimates. \n\n1998 \n68 \n72 \n31 \n1,100 \n1.74 \n2.06 \n15,927 \n0.98 \n118 \n\n2004\n38\n55\n36\n750\n1.30\n1.00\n27,970\n4.00\n128\n\n1988\n60\n23\n45\n2,300\n2.12\n1.65\n13,000\n7.20\n83\n\n                                                 \n1  According to the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters.  \n2  Hofer, T. and B.

These  activities \n\n\f2\n\n \nB. \n\n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n3. \nThe  2004  Floods.  In  late  June  2004,  heavy  monsoon  rains  swelled  the  waters  of  the \nMeghna  River.  In  early  July,  it  reached  its  peak  level,  as  the  Jamuna  and  Padma  rivers  burst \ntheir banks due to heavy rains in the north of the country. As a result, the north and west-central \ndistricts suffered severe floods that continued to spread, eventually impacting Dhaka and other \ncentral districts. Nationwide, 36 million people (about 25% of the population) across 39 districts \nwere  affected  by  the  floods.  By  the  time  the  waters  began  to  recede  in  early  August, \napproximately  38%  of  Bangladesh  was  inundated,  including  800,000  hectares  of  agricultural \nland.  The  death  toll  reached  nearly  800.  Access  to  potable  water  and  sanitation  facilities  was \ndiminished  during  the  emergency,  as  thousands  of  tubewells  and  latrines  were  affected.  The \nfloods  also  caused  heavy  damage  to  major  infrastructure,  including  rural  and  municipal \ninfrastructure,  roads  and  bridges,  railways,  embankments,  and  irrigation  systems,  as  well  as \nlosses  to  agriculture  and  the  ready-made  garment  and  other  export  industries.  In  September \n2004,  a  localized  monsoon  depression  swept  across  Bangladesh,  bringing  three  times  the \nnormal  rainfall  and  causing  urban  flooding  in  Dhaka  city,  and  southwest  and  central  areas  of \nBangladesh.  \n \n4. \nThe  Government\u2019s  Immediate  Response.  The  Government,  in  coordination  with \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and  international  organizations,  responded  immediately \nto  the  flood  emergency.  On  7  July  2004,  the  Ministry  of  Food  and  Disaster  Management \nactivated  emergency  response  committees  at  the  district  and  upazila  (subdistrict)  levels  and \nestablished an operations center in Dhaka to coordinate relief activities. About 5,500 emergency \nshelters  were  opened  to  house  about  1.7  million  homeless,  more  than  3,400  medical  teams \nwere  mobilized,  and  800  temporary  health  centers  were  established.  Military  personnel  were \ndeployed  to  assist  with  rescue  operations  and  the  distribution  of  food  and  relief  services.  To \nassist  the  flood-affected  households,  the  Government  started  the  Vulnerable  Group  Feeding \nProgram  2  months  earlier  than  usual.  By  the  end  of  August,  the  Government  had  distributed \n48,000  tons  of  rice  through  its  Gratuitous  Relief  Program.  From  September  to  early  2005,  the \nGovernment  will  distribute  170,000  tons  of  rice,  together  with  the  World  Food  Programme, \nstarting  in  the  six  most  impacted  districts  and  gradually  expanding  to  cover  the  rest.  The \nGovernment also distributed clothing and 10,800 bundles of corrugated iron sheets, along with \ncash grants totaling Tk5.4 million, to assist with housing reconstruction and related expenses.  \n \n5. \nThe  Government\u2019s  Recovery  Program.  In  response  to  the  2004  floods,  the \nGovernment  formulated  several  assistance  programs  to  help  the  affected  people  recover  and \nrestore their livelihoods (i) a disaster risk mitigation fund (Tk750 million) to benefit poor families; \n(ii) a food-for-work program started in October, comprising a cash fund of Tk1,680 million and \n195,000 tons of food, targeting the poorest rural residents, and providing employment in small \nprojects; (iii) a test relief program, similar to the food-for-work program, commenced in October, \nfocusing  on  repairing  and  rebuilding  schools  and  basic  infrastructure  (embankments,  bamboo \nbridges, etc.) to complement the large-scale reconstruction of major infrastructure systems; (iv) \ndistribution  of  corrugated  iron  sheets  for  housing  repair  and  reconstruction;  (v)  distribution  by \nmunicipalities of 100,000 bundles of corrugated iron sheets; (vi) allocation of rehabilitation funds \nfor  the  priority  sectors  of  water  supply  and  sanitation,  rural  roads,  and  urban  drainage  works; \n(vii)  facilitation  of  credit  through  commercial  banks  ($50  million  equivalent)  targeted  to \nagricultural rehabilitation; and, (viii) distribution of free seed and fertilizer to flood-affected small \n\n \n\n\f3\n\nand  marginal  farmers.4  In  addition,  the  Government  will  continue  to  address  hazard  risk \nreduction issues through its 5-year Comprehensive Disaster Management Program, which was \nestablished  in  2003  with  a  $14  million  grant  in  partnership  with  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme and the United Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development.5  \n \n6. \nNGO  Response.  Many  NGOs  provided  food,  health  supplies  and  services,  water,  and \nother  basic  necessities  to  thousands  of  families  throughout  the  country.  Several  NGOs \ncontinued supporting recovery programs. The Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee, one \nof the largest national NGOs, created two loan programs (one specifically for housing) with low \ninterest  rates  and  flexible  terms.  The  Bangladesh  Red  Crescent  Society  helped  reconstruct \n1,000 homes and provided seeds and other agricultural inputs to 30,000 families with access to \narable land. \n \n7. \nInternational Community Response.  In mid-July, the United Nations (UN) activated a \ndisaster  management  team  to  coordinate  the  activities  of  the  various  UN  agencies.  The  UN \nagencies provided critical emergency supplies to support the Government ministries involved in \nemergency response. On 12 August 2004, the UN launched a flash appeal aiming to raise $210 \nmillion.  Contributions  totaling  about  $53.5  million  had  been  received  by  mid-December  2004. \nThe  Disaster  and  Emergency  Response  (DER)  subgroup  of  the  Local  Consultative  Group  of \nBangladesh,  works  closely  with  the  UN  Country  Team  and  meets  regularly  to  coordinate  the \nemergency response of donors and international agencies. The DER subgroup, in coordination \nwith  several  of  its  partner  organizations,  conducted  its  own  damage  and  needs  assessment, \nwhich was released in October 2004. Several bilateral aid agencies have contributed resources \nfor  post-flood  relief  programs,  which  have  been  channeled  mainly  through  NGOs.  Although \nlimited  information  is  available  regarding  the  private  sector\u2019s  response  to  the  2004  floods, \nseveral multinational companies provided contributions supporting the relief program. \n \n8. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  Response.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nresponded very quickly to the 2004 floods: in mid-July, the Bangladesh Resident Mission (BRM) \nestablished  the  Flood  Monitoring  Unit  to  collect  key  information  and  liaise  with  other \ndevelopments  partners,  particularly  UN  agencies  and  the  DER  subgroup;  in  mid-August,  ADB \nresponded  to  the  Government\u2019s  request  to  field  a  damage  and  needs  assessment,  after  the \nfloodwater had receded, and prepare a post-flood recovery program; in mid-September, the joint \nADB  and  World  Bank  Damage  and  Needs  Assessment  Mission  was  fielded  to  help  the \nGovernment  assess  the  damage  and  prepare  an  immediate  and  short-term  recovery  and \nrehabilitation  program;  on  24  September,  ADB  management  approved  advance  action  and \nretroactive financing for $15 million for emergency flood damage rehabilitation assistance;6 and, \non  24  November,  ADB  management  approved  an  increase  in  retroactive  financing  to  $25 \nmillion. At the end of the Mission, the Government asked ADB and the World Bank to finance \n$250 million each for emergency rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure. \n \n9. \nFlood  Damage  and  Losses.  The  joint  preliminary  estimates  of  ADB  and  the  World \nBank show that the total damage to assets and output losses due to the floods is at least Tk134 \nbillion (about $2.3 billion). Of this total, Tk79.8 billion ($1.35 billion) corresponds to lost assets \n(of which damage to public infrastructure was Tk37.3 billion or $632 million) and Tk54.7 billion \n\n                                                 \n4  To  meet  the  emergency  needs,  the  Government  has  financed  some  of  the  response  and  recovery  activities \ndescribed  by  diverting  operation  and  maintenance  funds  allocated  in  the  Annual  Development  Program  of  fiscal \nyear 2005. This reallocation of funds may put the current routine operation and maintenance activities in jeopardy. \n5  The Government is discussing a multihazard disaster management assistance program with the European Union. \n6  Effective  12  September  2004,  the  commencement  dates  of  the  Damage  and  Needs  Assessment  Mission  and \n\nappraisal, and subject to Board approval of the loan.  \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f4\n\n \n\nthe  crop, \n\n($930 million) to lost outputs. Residential housing, roads, bridges, crops, fisheries, and livestock \nsuffered the most damage. The Mission observed that insufficient maintenance accentuated the \nflood  damage  in  public  infrastructure  sectors.  Output  losses  were  incurred  primarily  by  the \nprivate  sector,  with  agriculture  constituting  a  large  share.  Details  on  damage  and  losses  are \nprovided in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \nEconomic  Impacts.  Preliminary  analysis7  shows  that,  because  of  the  floods,  gross \n10. \ndomestic product (GDP) growth in fiscal year (FY) 2005 could be about 0.5 percentage points \nlower than the 5.5% growth achieved in FY2004. These macroeconomic effects are temporary \nand  are  expected  to  be  overcome  in  the  context  of  Bangladesh\u2019s  relatively  good  fiscal  and \nmacroeconomic  performance.  Agriculture,  particularly \nlivestock,  and  poultry \nsubsectors, and small and medium industries, are likely to be the most adversely affected in the \nshort  run.  Maintenance  of  stable  rice  (and  wheat)  prices  through  a  continued  liberalized  trade \nregime  and  absence  of  domestic  market  restrictions  can  have  widespread  significant  benefits \nfor poor households in the post-flood period.  \n \nHowever,  the  balance  of  payments  position  may  deteriorate.  The  external  current \n11. \naccount balance, which had a surplus equivalent to 0.3% of GDP in FY2004, was projected to \nhave  a  deficit  equivalent  to  0.9%  of  GDP  in  FY2005  before  the  floods,  due  primarily  to  a \nslowdown  in  export  growth  resulting  from  phasing  out  the  Multi-Fiber  Arrangement.  Additional \nreduction in export growth due to the floods, combined with additional flood-induced imports, is \nlikely  to  increase  the  current  account  deficit  to  1.5%  of  GDP,  even  after  taking  into  account \nincreases  in  remittances.  This  could  create  pressure  on  reserves,  but  unlike  the  situation \nfollowing  the  1998  floods,  Bangladesh\u2019s  reserve  position,  with  gross  reserves  at  $3.1  billion, \nwhich is equivalent to 3.5 months of imports at the end of September 2004, is much stronger. \nBangladesh\u2019s floating exchange rate will help absorb the pressure on reserves. The relief effort, \nexpansion  in  food-assisted  safety  nets,  repairs  to  public  property,  and  the  overall  impact  of \nfloods  on  economic  growth  are  likely  to  put  pressure  on  both  public  expenditure  and  tax \nrevenues. The total budget deficit can be expected to rise from 3.2% of GDP in FY2004 to 4.3% \nin FY2005. \n \n12. \nSocial  and  Poverty  Impacts.  According  to  the  2000  Household  Income  and \nExpenditure Survey in Bangladesh, 85% of Bangladesh\u2019s poor live in rural areas where 53% of \nhouseholds are poor compared with a poverty rate of 37% for urban households. Although the \n2004 floods affected both poor and nonpoor households, the poor were generally least able to \nwithstand  the  negative  impacts  of  the  disaster  on  household  income,  individual  health,  and \npersonal  security.  Households  living  near  major  rivers  in  northeast  rural  Bangladesh  suffered \nfrom the longest, and generally the most severe flooding. Within these areas, landless laborers \nand  small  landholders  who  lost  crops  were  the  most  severely  impacted.  While  the  national \naverage agricultural crop and livestock losses for the year have been moderate, relative losses \nto individual farmers were much larger. In urban areas, slum dwellers who typically live in poorly \ndrained  areas  suffered  from  long  periods  of  water  logging,  which  reportedly  led  to  increased \nincidence  of  diarrhea  and  other  waterborne  diseases.  Floodwaters  also  reduced  employment \nopportunities and incomes of these households. Even with the benefits of Government, NGOs, \nand international relief programs, many rural and urban households resorted to informal sector \nloans  with  high  interest  rates  as  their  main  coping  strategy.  Although  these  loans  can  be \ninstrumental in preventing serious reductions in food consumption and health status, the burden \nof debt repayment is likely to remain long after the visible effects of the flood are gone. Women, \nchildren, the disabled, and the elderly proved to be particularly vulnerable to the floods. Despite \n\n                                                 \n7  Based on the joint ADB and World Bank Mission and ADB. 2004. Quarterly Economic Update (September). Dhaka. \n\n \n\n\f5\n\nserious efforts on the part of the Government and relief organizations, emergency relief food did \nnot  always  provide  sufficient  nutrition  for  infants  and  children.  Lactating  women  may  not  have \nbeen able to produce milk due to flood-related stress and lack of nutritious food, so infants and \nchildren below 2 years of age became prone to malnourishment.  \n \n13. \nEnvironmental  Impacts.  The  2004  floods  caused  four  main  environmental  impacts: \nriverbank  erosion,  soil  erosion,  water  logging,  and  water  contamination  and  health  risks. \nRiverbank  and  soil  erosion  was  exacerbated,  especially  along  embankment  areas  close  to \nmajor  rivers.  Water  logging  is  also  reported  to  have  caused  health  risks  in  the  urbanized  low-\nlying and flood-prone areas. Persistent drainage congestion, poor solid waste management, and \ninadequate  water  and  wastewater  treatment  facilities  contributed  to  the  creation  of  unhygienic \nconditions. \n \n14. \nJustification for External Assistance. With diversion of resources by the Government \nfrom  low-priority  development  projects  to  post-flood  rehabilitation  of  infrastructure,  a  gap  in \nfinancing needs is anticipated. The reduction in exports due to the floods and the growth in post-\nflood  imports  will  widen  the  current  account  deficit  causing  depletion  of  foreign  exchange \nreserves,  which  will  require  additional  foreign  assistance  to  reduce  the  external  financial  gap. \nCurrent expenditures will exceed the budgeted target for FY2005, with increased expenditures \nfor relief and rehabilitation. Apart from the additional resource requirements, external assistance \nwill  be  needed  to  support  the  Government  with  speedy  restoration  of  damaged  physical \ninfrastructure, and preparation of a program and related action plan to mitigate future floods and \nincrease preparedness.  \n \nRecovery  and  Financing  Needs.  The  joint  Mission  focused  on  the  public  sector\u2019s \n15. \nfinancing  needs  for  rehabilitation  of  facilities  and  infrastructure.  Accordingly,  depending  on  the \nlevel of improved standards applied during rehabilitation, public sector financing needs related \nto physical infrastructure are expected to range from $670 million to $715 million. Recognizing \nthat  speedy  revival  of  livelihoods  is  crucial  to  the  recovery  process  of  those  affected  by  the \nflood, the Mission also considered the need for mitigating the impact of the floods on the poor \nand vulnerable, as well as on areas such as housing, crops, livestock, and fisheries. In addition \nto  the  relief,  food,  and  cash  grants  provided,  affected  people  need  access  to  credit  to  help \nreestablish their livelihoods and improve their economic situation. This can be achieved through \nmicrofinance institutions, such as Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF), rather than informal \nborrowing.  According  to  PKSF\u2019s  preliminary  surveys,  the  floods  have  severely  affected  about \n384,256 of its members in 192 of its partner organizations. The Mission estimated that a credit \nline  of  about  Tk1,003  million  ($17  million)  would  be  needed  to  assist  the  affected  people,8 \ncomplementing the Government assistance (para. 5). \n \n16. \nPortfolio  Management  and  Restructuring.  When  formulating  ADB\u2019s  post-flood \nrecovery  assistance  program,  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  and  the  possibility  for  loan  portfolio \nrestructuring  and  the  potential  use of  loan  savings  under  23  ongoing  projects  (27  loans)  were \ncarefully  assessed  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance.9  The \nportfolio assessment was made in light of the intensified country portfolio review missions10 and \nregular project review missions, particularly during the last 4 years by BRM and sector divisions \nof  ADB\u2019s  South  Asia  Regional  Department  in  close  coordination  with  government  agencies \n                                                 \n8  Based on the Tk1,000 credit need of about 20% of members of the partner organizations.  \n9  ADB.  2004.

Since 2001, particular emphasis has been placed on identifying and canceling Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) loan savings by examining physical and financial progress of ongoing \nprojects and by adjusting their scope and design. As a result, $158 million has been canceled \nand returned to ADB\u2019s general pool of ADF resources since the beginning of 2001. Therefore, \nthe scope of creating loan savings by restructuring the existing ADF loan portfolio is limited.  \n \n17. \nPost-Flood  Recovery  and  Assistance  Program.  On  the  basis  of  the  Government\u2019s \npost-flood recovery program, and other development partners\u2019 efforts, the joint ADB and World \nBank Damage and Needs Assessment Mission prepared a three-phased program: phase one, \nimmediate recovery assistance (up to 2 years) to address urgent activities; phase two, midterm \nrecovery  assistance  (up  to  5  years)  for  other  works  and  major  mitigation  efforts;  and  phase \nthree,  long-term  disaster  risk  management  program.  Recognizing  the  extensive  damage  to \npublic  infrastructure,  ADB\u2019s  timely  recovery  assistance  will  be  critical  to  help  the  Government \naddress  the  large  recovery  needs  through  the  proposed  emergency  assistance  Project, \ncovering  phase  one  (up  to  2  years  only).  In  the  education  and  health  sectors,  however,  the \nrecovery needs can be effectively addressed under ongoing programs. These include the multi \ndevelopment  agency-funded  Primary  Education  Development  Program  II  led  by  ADB  and  the \nHealth  and  Population  Program  led  by  the  World  Bank.11  Similarly,  provision  of  credit  to \nvulnerable groups including the poor can be effectively channeled through ongoing microcredit \nprograms  operated  by  NGOs,  such  as  PKSF.  To  support  microcredit,  the  World  Bank  will \nextend  a  $10  million  credit  line  to  PKSF  as  part  of  its  post-flood  assistance  program.  ADB\u2019s \nmidterm to long-term post-flood assistance will be based on the country strategy and program \n(CSP)  currently  being  prepared  in  close  consultation  with  the  Government  and  stakeholders, \nand  expected  to  be  submitted  for  Board  consideration  in  mid-2005.  One  of  the  key  priorities \nbeing  considered  under  the  new  CSP  is  disaster  preparedness  and  mitigation,  through  both \nstandalone TA and investment projects for improved water resources and flood management. In \naddition, the new CSP is expected to mainstream disaster management in all operations, e.g., \nby including flood-resistant design in social and economic infrastructure projects, together with \ninstitutional strengthening for better disaster preparedness and mitigation. \n \n18. \nNational  Disaster  Preparedness  and  Risk  Reduction  Strategies.  Since  the  1998 \nfloods,  the  Government  through  the  Ministry  of  Food  and  Disaster  Management  has \ncommenced a shift in disaster strategy from disaster response to disaster risk management to \nachieve  three  basic  goals:  (i)  substantially  reduce  disaster  losses  in  lives  and  in  social, \neconomic,  and  environmental  assets  of  communities  and the  nation;  (ii)  integrate disaster  risk \nconsiderations  into  national  development  planning  and  programs  to  improve  sustainable \ndevelopment  outcomes;  and  (iii)  develop  stronger  institutions,  mechanisms,  and  community \ncapacities  that  can  systematically  build  resilience  to  natural  hazards  and  disasters.  In  the \nmedium  term,  the  Government  needs  to  address  the  long-term  issues  of  hazard  risk \nmanagement and reduce Bangladesh\u2019s vulnerability to natural disasters. Although Bangladesh \nhas  made  huge  strides  in  reducing  the  number  of  fatalities  in  floods,  cyclones,  and  storm \nsurges,  improvements  are  needed  in  all  phases  of  the  hazard  risk  management  cycle \n(preparedness,  reconstruction,  recovery,  and  prevention),  adopting  a  more  holistic  and \ncomprehensive  risk  management  approach  and  strategy.  Further  external  assistance  will  be \nneeded  to  support  this  process  over  the  medium  to  long-term,  complementing  the  ongoing \nComprehensive  Disaster  Management  Program.  In  the  short-term,  the  Standard  Orders  for \n\n                                                 \n11  The urban primary health care subsector supported by ADB did not report any damage.  \n\n \n\n\f7\n\nDisasters need to be reviewed and amended, as recommended by the 2004 national workshop \non options for flood risk and damage reduction.12  \n \n19. \nFlood  Risk  Monitoring  and  Early  Warning  Systems.  Bangladesh  has  several \ninstitutions  involved  in  flood  risk  monitoring  and  mapping.  These  include  (i)  Institute  of  Water \nModeling,  (ii)  Flood  Forecasting  and  Warning  Center,  (iii)  Bangladesh  Meteorological \nDepartment,  (iv)  Bangladesh  Meteorological  Department\u2019s  Center  for  Environmental  and \nGeographic  Information  Services,  (v)  Bangladesh  University  of  Engineering  and  Technology, \nand  (vi)  Space  Research  and  Remote  Sensing  Organization.  Among  these,  the  Bangladesh \nMeteorological  Department  and  Flood  Forecasting  and  Warning  Center  are  responsible  for \nissuing  warnings  to  communities  in  flood-prone  areas.  In  view  of  the  increased  frequency  of \ndisasters  including  severe  floods,  several  improvements  are  necessary.  These  include  (i) \nstreamlined  organizational  responsibilities,  (ii)  increased  institutional  capacities;  (iii)  enhanced \nflood  mapping  and  forecasting  systems;  (iv)  transfer  of  new  technology;  (v)  provision  of  new \nequipment, such as radar; and (v) access to regional meteorological and hydrological data. One \ncritical issue is to enhance early warning capability by improving flood forecasting and making \nmore  accurate  predictions,  adapted  to  the  various  needs  at  different  levels,  sectors,  and \norganizations, providing the different stakeholders including the poor and vulnerable groups with \nearly  and  easily  understandable  information.  Increased  regional  cooperation  and  sharing  of \nmeteorological  and  hydrological  data  among  the  countries  in  Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna \nriver  basin  is  essential  to  reduce  the  risk  and  increase  preparedness  for  disasters  including \nfloods.  \n \n20. \nGovernance  and  Corruption.  Weak  governance  continues  to  be  a  key  challenge  in \nBangladesh. Efforts in poverty reduction are constrained by lack of accountability, transparency, \npredictability,  and  opportunities  for  citizen  participation  in  public  decision-making.  Prevailing \ngovernance  practices  are  a  reflection  of  severe  resource  constraints  and  an  underfunded \nGovernment. While general consensus exists on the key constraints, modest progress has been \nmade  in  raising  overall  standards  of  governance.  Thus,  at  the  end  of  November  2004,  the \nGovernment established the awaited Anticorruption Commission following legislation passed in \nFebruary  2004.  The  Government  will  create  a  corruption-free  environment  in  accordance  with \nthe  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy.  Public  procurement,  which  is  an  area \ngenerally  associated  with  a  high  level  of  corruption,  is  undergoing  a  major  reform  program \nsupported  by  ADB,  World  Bank,  and  other  development  partners  following  the  new  public \nprocurement regulations that became effective in October 2003. ADB is providing TA to help the \nGovernment build capacity and provide support for an integrated anticorruption strategy.13 The \nTA  includes  expenditure  tracking  surveys  in  the  road  and  rail  subsectors.  At  the  sector  level, \nADB  has  commenced  performance  assessment  of  project  implementation  including  quality  of \nworks  and  procurement,  starting  with  roads.  Strengthening  of  financial  management  and \nauditing  have  been  aided  by  training  provided  under  TA  to  Foreign-Aided  Projects  Audit \nDirectorate  of  the  Comptroller  and  Auditor  General  of  Bangladesh.14  The  same  TA  provided \ncapacity  building  and  support  to  strengthen  the  Implementation  Monitoring  and  Evaluation \nDivision  of  the  Planning  Division.  The  proposed  Project  also  incorporates  several  specific \nfinancial  management  with  strengthened \nanticorruption  measures, \n\n(i)  strict \n\nincluding \n\n                                                 \n12  The workshop was held 7\u20139 September 2004 and attended by Government departments and agencies, as well as \ndevelopment partners and other stakeholders including NGOs. The workshop\u2019s recommendations were presented \nto the Prime Minister on 31 October 2004 and endorsed for implementation.  \n\n13  ADB.  2003.

ADB  has  provided \npostdisaster  emergency  assistance  to  Bangladesh  through  eight  loans  (Supplementary \nAppendix B) as well as reallocation of loan savings. Two projects have been postevaluated.15 A \nreview  of  project  performance  audit  reports,  project  completion  reports,  and  ADB-wide \nexperience16  with  rehabilitation  assistance  in  Bangladesh  indicates  the  following  lessons:  (i) \nprojects  must  be  prepared  as  quickly  as  possible;  (ii)  projects  should  focus  on  restoring \nfacilities; (iii) rehabilitation works, to the extent possible, should be completed within 2 years; (iv) \nimplementation will place a heavy burden on executing agency (EA) staff and therefore strong \nconsulting  support  and  ADB  supervision  are  needed  during  implementation;  and  (v)  efforts \nshould be made to ensure that ADB\u2019s rapid response to disasters is matched by equally quick \naction  by  the  Government.  Other  lessons  learned  from  ADB\u2019s  earlier  emergency  projects \ninclude (i) beneficiary participation is important and should be increased in project preparation \nand  implementation,  especially  in  the  maintenance  of  facilities;  (ii)  environment  and  social \naspects should be considered during project implementation, even though the need for a rapid \nresponse  may  not  permit  detailed  treatment  of  these  issues  prior  to  the  approval  of  the \nassistance; (iii) arrangements for disbursements, including retroactive financing and the use of \nimprest accounts, should give the EAs quick and simple access to funds; (ix) project objectives \nand  scope  need  to  be  carefully  defined;  and  (x)  criteria  for  subproject  selection  should  permit \nsimple prioritization of subprojects and short implementation periods. Recent experience of loan \nportfolio management in Bangladesh shows that anticorruption measures need to be addressed \neven under emergency projects. These lessons have been considered and incorporated in the \ndesign of the proposed Project. \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n22. \nThe main objective of the Project is to contribute to sustainability of economic growth by \nminimizing the devastating impact of severe floods. This is essential to enable early restoration \nof  economic  and  social  activity  in  the  affected  areas,  especially  for  the  poor.  The  Project  will \nfocus on priority areas, identified through consultation with the Government, public and private \nsector, and civil society; and involve community participation. The Project also includes capacity \nbuilding and training to reduce vulnerability to future floods by strengthening the Government\u2019s \ndisaster preparedness by adopting flood-resistant infrastructure design standards, and providing \nanalytical input and capacity building to enhance early warning systems. \n \n\n                                                 \n15  ADB. 1995.

Rehabilitation  after  Disasters:  A  Review  of  Lessons  Learned  and \n\nEmerging Issues. Manila: ADB (3rd draft).     \n\n \n\n\f9\n\nThe  Project  was  developed  in  close  cooperation  with  the  World  Bank  and  bilateral  aid \n23. \nagencies  that  have  expressed  interest  in  financing  part  of  the  post-flood  recovery  program.17 \nThe  Project  builds  upon  strengthening  partnerships;  the  project  design  is  based  on  the  joint \ndamage  and  needs  assessment  undertaken  in  September  200418  by  ADB  and  World  Bank  in \nclose coordination and consultation with the Government. The project design draws upon ADB\u2019s \nsignificant  experience  in  emergency  assistance  and  the  extensive  flood  damage  rehabilitation \nexperience  acquired  in  Bangladesh  during  the  last  two  decades.  The  project  design  benefited \nfrom (i) preliminary damage assessments prepared by the Government, (ii) information and data \nreceived  from  UN  relief  agencies,19  (iii)  meetings  held  and  assessments  made  by  the  DER \nsubgroup, (iv)  meetings held with NGOs and academia including research institutions, and (v) \nconsultation  with  communities  and  flood-affected  people.  The  Project  complements  relief  and \nother assistance provided by the Government, UN agencies, NGOs, and bilateral development \npartners;  and  recovery  assistance  provided  by  the  World  Bank.  The  Project  is  consistent  with \nADB\u2019s Policy on Disaster and Emergency Assistance (2004) and with the CSP/CSP Update for \nBangladesh.  \n \nThe  Project  will  follow  a  sector  approach  to  facilitate  selection  of  the  highest  priority \n24. \nsubprojects during implementation. The sector approach is a suitable modality for emergencies, \nas  it  allows  quick  response  and  maximum  flexibility  of  both  geographic  coverage  and \ncomponents,  within  agreed  framework  and  criteria.  The  sectors/subsectors  selected  for \ninclusion of the Project are (i) rural infrastructure, (ii) roads, (iii) railways, (iv) water resources, \nand  (v)  municipal  infrastructure.  The  selection  of  sectors/subsectors  was  based  on  several \nfactors  including  (i)  scale  and  extent  of  flood  damage;  (ii)  Government  priorities;  (iii)  careful \nassessment  of  the  EA's  implementation  capacity;  (iv)  recovery  assistance  carried  out  by  the \nGovernment;  (iv)  assistance  to  be  provided  by  other  development  partners,  specifically  the \nWorld Bank; (v) damage to ongoing and completed ADB projects; and (vi) ADB\u2019s comparative \nstrengths  in  sector/subsectors.  In  four  other  important  sectors:  education,  health,  agriculture, \nand microcredit, the recovery needs can be met by ongoing assistance programs or assistance \nto  be  provided  by  the  World  Bank.  Within  each  sector,  priorities  were  established  in  the \nfollowing order: first, to rehabilitate ongoing ADB projects for which financing was not available \nfrom current sources or loan savings; second, to rehabilitate completed ADB projects; and third, \nto rehabilitate non-ADB subprojects in relevant sectors.  \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n25. \nThe  Project  will  rehabilitate  high-priority,  flood-damaged  infrastructure  and  facilities  by \nproviding  civil  works,  equipment  and  materials,  and  consulting  services  for  project  design, \nimplementation, monitoring, and evaluation. During rehabilitation, appropriate and cost-effective \n                                                 \n17  The World Bank  will utilize $190 million of loan savings on ongoing projects. Of this amount, $140 million  will be \nused to rehabilitate (i) transport infrastructure ($50 million), (ii) agriculture, fisheries, and livestock ($5.5 million), (iii) \nsecondary education ($45 million), (iv) water resource management ($15 million), (v) urban municipalities of large \ncities  ($15  million),  and  (vi)  water  supply  and  sanitation  ($9.5  million).  In  addition,  the  World  Bank  will  support \nmicrocredit  by  extending  a  $10  million  credit  line  to  PKSF  and  provide  $40  million  of  budgetary  support  to  the \nGovernment.  For  the  medium  term  (phase  2  up  to  5  years),  the  World  Bank  is  expected  to  provide  another  $40 \nmillion  for  rehabilitation  of  flood  management  infrastructure  and  initial  disaster  preparedness  activities,  possibly \nunder the proposed Water Management Improvement Project, which is being processed by the World Bank. The \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation will provide about $8 million equivalent for rehabilitation assistance in the \nroad sector covering the northeast part of Bangladesh. The Government of Japan will also provide support to the \nroad,  railway,  and  rural  infrastructure  sectors  through  its  debt  relief  program.  The  Department  for  International \nDevelopment is providing about $7 million equivalent for maintenance and repair assistance to the road sector. \n\n18 During 12\u201327 September 2004. \n19 Particularly United Nations Development Programme, United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, World Health Organization, \n\nand World Food Programme. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f10\n\n \n\nRoads. Rehabilitate flood-damaged national, regional, and district (zilla) roads, bridges, \n\nflood-proofing measures and design standards will be adopted to minimize future flood damage. \nThe  Project  comprises  five  parts:  A:  rural  infrastructure,  B:  roads,  C:  railways,  D:  water \nresources, and E: municipal infrastructure.   \n \n \nRural Infrastructure. Rehabilitate and restore rural infrastructure, including rural roads \n26. \n(damaged paved upazila and union roads), bridges, and culverts. Rehabilitate existing flood and \ncyclone  shelters  and  provide  latrines  to  help  communities,  especially  the  poor,  during  future \nfloods (Appendix 3).20   \n \n27. \nand culverts (Appendix 4). \n \nRailways.  Rehabilitate  flood-damaged  rail  infrastructure  and  facilities  on  the  core  rail \n28. \nnetwork,  including  civil  works  to  restore  embankments,  tracks,  bridges,  essential  buildings, \nstation  roads,  and  signaling  and  telecommunications  facilities.  Provide  emergency  equipment \nand  materials  required  to  undertake  expeditious  repair  work  in  future  emergency  situations \n(Appendix 5).   \n \n29.  Water  Resources.  Rehabilitate  flood  control,  drainage,  and  irrigation  facilities,  repair \nembankment  breaches,  and  repair  or  replace  water  control  structures,  protective  works,  and \ncanals (Appendix 6). \n \n30.  Municipal  Infrastructure.  Rehabilitate  (i)  roads,  drains,  bridges,  and  culverts;  and  (ii) \nfootpaths  and  drains  in  the  slums  in  about  55  municipalities  (pourashavas)  in  six  divisions \n(Appendix 7).   \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nfrom \n\nDisaster  Preparedness  and  Mitigation.  Apart \n\nrestoration  of  physical \n31. \ninfrastructure,  the  Project  supports  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  increase  its  preparedness  and \nability  to  mitigate  future  floods.  Thus,  the  Project  includes  assistance  to  enhance  the \nGovernment\u2019s  capacity  to  develop  and  adopt  enhanced,  more  flood-resistant  infrastructure \ndesign  standards.  The  Project  supports  mainstreaming  of  such  design  standards,  such  as \nimproved  drainage  and  slope  protection.  This  will  cover \ninfrastructure \nsectors/subsectors:  rural,  municipal,  road  and  railway  infrastructure,  water  resources,  and \nirrigation  and  drainage.  It  also  supports  rationalization  of  flood  control  and  drainage  schemes. \nThe  Project  provides  analytical  input  and  capacity  building,  through  attached  TA,  to  enhance \nexisting  early  warning  systems,  including  the  flood  forecasting  system  operated  by  the  Flood \nForecasting and Warning Center under the Bangladesh Water Development Board (para. 59). \nSome  of  the  key  issues  to  be  addressed  under  the  TA  include  (i)  improving  reliability  of  the \nexisting forecasting system, (ii) improving accuracy of weather predictions, (iii) providing longer \nforecasting periods, (iv) identifying cost-effective options to update the 40-year old topographic \nand elevation data, and (v) linking the existing flood forecasting system to major infrastructure \nand  agricultural  land  to  improve  its  usefulness.  Project  implementation  will  be  closely \ncoordinated with the World Bank and bilateral aid agencies active in Bangladesh, aided by joint \nreviews;  common  reporting;  and  close  monitoring  and  coordination  of  activities,  including \nanticorruption measures such as performance auditing.  \n\nfive  key \n\n                                                 \n20  Future  ADB-financed  rural  infrastructure  projects  are  expected  to  provide  for  new  flood  and  cyclone  shelters \n\nwherever feasible and justified. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f11\n\nCost Estimates  \n\n32. \nThe estimated cost of the Project is $240.0 million equivalent, comprising $73.8 million in \nforeign  exchange  (30.8%)  including  $2.0  million  for  interest  during  construction,  and  $166.2 \nmillion equivalent (69.2%) in local currency costs. Since a sector approach is being followed, the \ncost  estimates  are  on  a  sector  basis.  The  cost  estimates  are  based  on  the  joint  World  Bank-\nADB  Damage  and  Needs  Assessment  Mission,  incorporating,  as  appropriate,  flood-resistant \ndesign  standards  and  provision  for  technological  improvements,  appropriate  materials,  and \nquality  control.  The  damage  assessment  will  be  updated  during  the  detailed  design  phase  for \neach project component.

The  loan  will  have  a  40-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  10 \nyears, an interest rate of 1% per annum, and repayment of principal at 2% per annum for the \nfirst 10 years after the grace period and 4% per annum thereafter.21 The loan proceeds will be \nmade available to all the EAs through budgetary allocations.  \n \n\n \nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment  \n\n      Total \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nTable 3: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nForeign \nExchange \n73.8 \n0.0 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n106.2 \n60.0 \n\n73.8 \n\n166.2 \n\nTotal \nCost \n\n180.0 \n60.0 \n\n240.0 \n\n \nPercent \n75 \n25 \n\n100 \n\n                                                 \n21  Due to the emergency nature of the Project, the terms and conditions of the loan deviate from the standard ADF \n\nloans, as provided for in ADB\u2019s Operations Manual (footnote 9). \n\n \n \n\n \nD. \n\n \nItem \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12\n\n \n\nCofinancing Opportunities. The governments of the Netherlands and Sweden, through \n34. \nthe  Swedish  International  Development  Agency,  have  expressed  interest  in  providing  $25 \nmillion of cofinancing for the Project, subject to clearance from their management in late 2004. \nIn absence of a firm commitment for cofinancing\u2014Swedish International Development Agency \n(Part  A)  and  the  Netherlands  (Part  D),  ADB  will  provide  a loan  under  the  umbrella  or  standby \nfinancing mechanism, whereby ADB commits for a $180 million loan but cancels a portion of its \nloan  when  grant  financing  becomes  available  later  from  the  Netherlands  and/or  Swedish \nInternational Development Agency.22 \n \nLocal  cost  financing  is  justified  under  ADB\u2019s  local  currency  financing  policy.23  The \n35. \namount of local currency funding takes account of the current fiscal situation in Bangladesh and \nthe increased expenditure required for relief and rehabilitation works.  \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n36. \nThe  implementation  arrangements  are  designed  to  follow  established  procedures  and \npractices under ongoing ADB-financed projects to enable speedy and efficient implementation, \nstrengthened with specific anticorruption measures. ADB already has several ongoing projects \nin each of the main sectors and subsectors where financing will be provided: rural infrastructure, \nroads, railways, water resources, and municipal infrastructure.  \n\n1. \n\nProject Management and Coordination \n\n37. \nFollowing  the  practice  adopted  for  ADB-financed  flood  damage  rehabilitation  projects, \noverall  project  coordination  will  be  provided  by  the  already  established  Project  Steering \nCommittee  (PSC),  chaired  by  the  member  for  programming,  Planning  Commission  of  the \nMinistry  of  Planning.  The  PSC  includes  the  member  (physical  infrastructure)  of  the  Planning \nCommission and representatives from the Economic Relations Division and Finance Division of \nthe Ministry of Finance, Cabinet Division, Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division of \nthe Planning Commission, and the EAs involved in emergency rehabilitation works under ADB, \nWorld  Bank,  and  other  aid  agency  projects.  The  Implementation  Monitoring  and  Evaluation \nDivision  will  play  a  key  role  in  performance  monitoring  and  will  provide  support  to  the  PSC \nsecretariat.  In  support  of  timely  subproject  approval  procedures,  the  same  simplified \nGovernment procedures will be followed that were used during past flood damage rehabilitation \nprojects and greatly helped to expedite project implementation.  \n \n38. \n \n\nThe EAs for the Projects will be the following:  \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\nPart A: rural infrastructure\u2014Local Government Engineering Department, \nPart B:. roads\u2014Roads and Highways Department,  \nPart C: railways\u2014Bangladesh Railway,  \nPart D: water resources\u2014Bangladesh Water Development Board, and   \nPart E: municipal infrastructure\u2014Local Government Engineering Department  \n\n \nEach  EA  will  be  responsible  in  its  respective  sector/subsector  for  (i)  selection  of  all \n39. \nsubprojects and approval of subprojects not exceeding $200,000 equivalent , (ii) design of civil \nworks,  (iii)  preparation  of  tender  documents  for  civil  works  and  goods,  (iv)  appointment  of \n\n                                                 \n22  ADB.  2003.

For  efficiency \npurposes,  existing  project  management  units  (PMUs)  and  project  implementation  units,  as \nappropriate, will be utilized for all EAs and will be provided with adequate staff, resources, and \nlogistical support. The project implementation arrangements are provided in Appendix 9. \n \n40. \nProject  Monitoring  and  Anticorruption  Measures.  To  ensure  timely  implementation, \nthe responsibility for project administration will be delegated to ADB\u2019s BRM in Dhaka. BRM has \nextensive experience in administrating similar projects and will closely monitor compliance with \nADB\u2019s  requirements  under  the  Project  to  ensure  quality  control,  speedy  implementation  of \nsubprojects, and rapid assistance to the EAs on any project implementation matters. BRM will \nalso  closely  monitor  anticorruption  measures  undertaken  by  the  PSC  and  EAs,  carry  out \nrandom  and  spot  checks  on  procurement  and  accounts  of  the  Project  and  subprojects,  and \ninspect  facilities  rehabilitated  under  the  Project  for  quality  control.  Adopted  anticorruption \nmeasures  were  designed  based  on  portfolio  experience,  preliminary  findings  of  a  recent \nperformance assessment conducted in the road sector,24 and preliminary outputs under ongoing \nTAs supporting good governance (footnote 14) and strengthening project portfolio performance \n(footnote 15). The anticorruption measures adopted under the Project include (i) strict financial \nmanagement  with  strengthened  Government  monitoring  and  independent  monitoring  under \npiggy-backed  TA  for  financial  management  and  monitoring  (para.59),  (ii)  the  use  of  detailed \nsubproject  selection  criteria,  (iii)  strong  project  supervision  with  appropriate  consultancy  input, \n(iv) regular independent performance auditing, and (v) random and independent spot checks by \nBRM, and consultants. \n\nSubproject Selection Criteria and Approval \n\n41. \nSubprojects  will  be  identified  and  selected  in  accordance  with  sector-specific  criteria \nagreed upon by the Government and ADB for each project component (appendixes 3 to 7). In \naddition, each subproject proposal will be selected on the basis of the following general criteria: \n \n\nThe  subproject  will  rehabilitate  or  restore  damaged  infrastructure  and  facilities \ncaused  by  the  2004  floods  based  on  the  damage  and  needs  assessment \n(Supplementary  Appendix  A)  and  assessment  carried  out  by  the  project \nconsultants.  \nBaseline  data  and  performance  indicators  will  be  considered  in  the  selection  of \nsubprojects.  \nThe subproject does not involve deferred maintenance, unless such maintenance \nwill substantially reduce the prospect of damage from recurrence of floods.  \nThe subproject will incorporate appropriate flood-resistant design standards with \nadequate provision for quality control.  \nThe subproject is technically feasible, cost-effective, and represents a least-cost \nalternative with appropriate adjustment for incorporating flood resistant designs. \nThe  subproject  incorporates  beneficiary  consultation  and  input  in  the  selection \nprocess. \nThe subproject will be completed within the project implementation period.                                    \n\n(vii) \n(viii)  The  subproject  will  not  be  financed  by  another  agency,  unless  ADB  is  a \n\ncofinancer. \nPriority will be given to subprojects that rehabilitate ongoing or completed ADB-\nfinanced projects. \n\n                                                 \n24  The  performance  assessment,  conducted  in  November\u2013December  2004,  focused  on  quality  of  completed  works \n\nand procurement.   \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n2. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(ix) \n\n\f14\n\n \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\nis \n\nin  compliance  with \n\nthe  Government\u2019s  environmental \nThe  subproject \nrequirements,  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environment  Assessment \nGuidelines  (2003),  and  the  agreed  Environmental  Assessment  Framework \n(Appendix 15). For subprojects that require an initial environmental examination \n(IEE),  the  IEE  is  included  in  the  subproject  proposal,  and  Government \nenvironment clearance is obtained prior to award of the subproject contract.  \nSubprojects  are  not  expected  to  involve  any  land  acquisition  or  involuntary \nresettlement. If either is required, in the course of the Project, it will be conducted \nin  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  ADB\u2019s \nPolicy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995), ADB\u2019s Handbook on Resettlement: A \nGuide to Good Practice (1998), and the agreed resettlement framework prior to \nthe award of the subproject contract.  \n\n \n42. \nSubproject  proposals  will  be  prepared  by  the  EAs  in  formats  agreed  to  by  the \nGovernment  and  ADB.  The  PMU  concerned  will  be  responsible  for  preparation,  submission, \napproval, implementation, and benefits monitoring and evaluation stages. The first subproject to \nbe  carried  out  by  each  EA  will  be  subject  to  prior  review  and  approval  by  ADB  before \ncommencement.  Subsequent  subprojects  costing  more  than  $200,000  equivalent  must  be \nsubmitted to ADB for prior review and approval.                                                                                                      \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n43. \nAs the Project is for emergency assistance, project implementation will be completed in \n24  months  by  31  January  2007.  The  agreed  upon  implementation  schedule  recognizes  the \ncritical  importance  of  restoring  as  much  key  infrastructure  as  possible  before  the  onset  of  the \nnext  rainy  season  in  July  2005  and  builds  upon  BRM\u2019s  past  implementation  experience  with \nflood  damage  rehabilitation  projects.  The  EAs  have  agreed  to  submit  work  plans  covering  the \nnext  dry  season  up  to  end-June  2005  to  ADB  during  loan  negations.  Detailed  implementation \nschedules are provided in Appendix 10.   \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement  \n\nProcurement of works, goods, and services will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \n44. \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  ADB\u2019s  procedures  for  providing  rehabilitation  assistance  after \ndisasters provide for flexible interpretation of these guidelines, so that project activities can start \npromptly.  Local  procurement  will  be  the  preferred  mode  for  all  civil  works  because  of  the \nrelatively short implementation period, the small size of contract packages, the wide geographic \nspread of the project sites, and the need for local awareness and community participation.  \n \n45. \nNone of the Project\u2019s individual civil works contracts is expected to exceed $3.0 million. \nCivil  works  contracts  with  estimated  values  greater  than  $3.0  million  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with international competitive bidding procedures. Contracts with estimated values \nof $3.0 million or less will be procured in accordance with local competitive bidding procedures \nacceptable  to  ADB,  typically  those  specified  in  the  Government\u2019s  Public  Procurement \nRegulations  2003  (PPR),  adapted  to  the  urgency  of  works.25  ADB\u2019s  portfolio  experience  in \nBangladesh  indicates  that  domestic  contractors  have  adequate  capacity  to  undertake  such \ncontracts. ADB will review and approve the first two civil works contracts estimated to cost less \n\n                                                 \n25  The PPR, adopted by the Government in October 2003, is a major step forward to more efficient and transparent \nprocurement.  It  entails  comprehensive  reform  of  all  aspects  of  procurement  and  is  supported  by  ADB  and  other \ndevelopment partners active in Bangladesh.  \n\n \n\n\f15\n\nthan  $200,000.  Once  ADB  is  satisfied  with  the  EAs\u2019  procurement  procedures,  post-facto \napproval procedures will be followed. However, if ADB does not approve the award or terms of \nthe  contract,  the  Government  will  not  use  loan  proceeds  to  finance  the  contract.  If  the  loan \nproceeds  are  used,  the  Government  will  refund  to  ADB  any  such  payments.  Contracts  with \nestimated values exceeding $200,000 equivalent will be reviewed and approved by ADB before \naward. All contracts with estimated values equal to or less than $200,000 will be procured under \nlocal  competitive  bidding  using  post-facto  approval  procedures.  Local  competitive  bidding  civil \nworks  procurement  will  follow  the  single-stage,  one-envelope  procedure  with  postqualification \nand  bidding  periods  of  21  days.26  Urgent  works27  will  follow  the  direct  procurement  method \nspecified  in  the  PPR.  To  encourage  the  participation  of  communities  and  local  residents, \nespecially women, and provide them with employment opportunities, small earthworks with an \nestimated cost of $8,000 or less in each case, may be awarded, in line with past practices for \nprojects  of  similar  nature,  to  labor-contracting  societies  in  accordance  with  procedures \nacceptable to ADB.  \n \n46. \nEquipment and materials will be procured under international competitive bidding where \nthe  estimated  cost  is  more  than  $500,000  equivalent;  by  international  shopping  where  the \nestimated  cost  is  between  $300,000  and  $500,000  equivalent;  and  using  local  procurement \nprocedures,  typically  those  specified  in  the  Government\u2019s  PPR,  where  the  estimated  cost  is \n$300,000 equivalent or less.  \n \n47. \nAll  contracts  should  conform  with  both  the  general  (para.  40)  and  the  sector-specific \ncriteria  (appendixes  3  to  7)  and  follow  the  PPR.  The  Government  and  each  EA  will  strictly \nadhere to the PPR\u2019s specified time limits for evaluating and awarding contracts.  \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services  \n\n48. \nGiven the tight implementation schedule and the EAs\u2018 capacity, consulting services will \nbe required for (i) detailed assessment and verification of damage in each sector/subsector; (ii) \nprioritization  of  subprojects;  (iii)  preparation  of subproject  appraisal  reports  in  accordance  with \nGovernment and ADB requirements and selection criteria; (iv) incorporation of flood resistance, \nrapid  planning,  design,  and  implementation  of  the  works;  (v)  supervision  and  monitoring  of \nworks to ensure quality control and transparency among contractors and communities carrying \nout smaller works; and (vi) oversight of works in each sector/subsector and provision of detailed \naccounting, auditing, and reporting to the PMUs and ADB. The Project will require a total of 250 \nperson-months of international consulting and 2,200 person-months of domestic consulting.  \n \n49. \nThe  design  and  supervision  consultants  will  support  the  EAs  with  day-to-day  project \nimplementation  and  rehabilitation  requirements  including  (i)  identification,  prioritization,  and \nformulation  of  subprojects;  (ii)  detailed  surveys  and  damage  assessment;  (iii)  preparation  of \nplans,  designs,  specifications,  and  cost  estimates;  (iv)  preparation  of  tender  and  contract \ndocuments; (v) evaluation of bids and contract awards; (vi) supervision of construction, quality, \ncost  and  schedule  control,  measurement,  and  approval  of  contractor\u2019s  work  and  progress \nclaims; (vi) issuance of completion certificates; (vii) preparation of subproject accounts, audits, \nand  reports;  and  (viii)  assessment of  EA  capacity  and  subsequent  training  of  EA/PMU  staff  in \nmethodology  and  procedures  for  damage  and  needs  assessment,  project  supervision, \nappropriate  flood  resistant  design  standards,  and  related  areas.  In  addition,  an  NGO  will  be \nengaged for implementation and monitoring of any resettlement activities. \n\n                                                 \n26  Small simple civil works, estimated to cost $50,000 or less, will have a 15-day bidding period. \n27  Urgent restoration works are works that can be completed within 3 months before 1 April 2005.   \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f16\n\n \n\nAll  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  the  EA  concerned  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \n50. \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the \nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  Since  the  Project  will  be  completed  within  24  months, \nexpeditious selection and fielding of the design and construction supervision consultants will be \nnecessary.  Accordingly,  ADB  has  agreed  with  the  Government  that  direct  engagement  of \nconsultants be undertaken, as provided for under these guidelines. General conditions for direct \nselection  under  the  Project  require  that  the  consultant  (i)  be  currently  engaged  or  have  prior \nsubstantial  and  satisfactory  experience  in  past  ADB-financed  flood  damage  rehabilitation \nprojects in Bangladesh, (ii) have capacity to deploy needed expertise of relevance and quality at \nshort notice, and (iii) have been selected for ongoing projects following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  and  have  performed  satisfactorily  pursuant  to  the  terms  of  such  prior \nengagements.  These  arrangements  provide  for  efficient  recruitment  of  consultants  under  the \ncircumstances.  The  Borrower  has  requested  ADB  and  ADB  has  agreed  to  directly  engage \nconsultants on behalf of the Borrower.  \n \n\n6. \n\nAdvance Action  \n\n51. \nGiven the urgency of the Project, ADB approved advance action for the procurement of \ngoods, services, and works, and the recruitment of consultants, provided this takes place on or \nafter 12 September 2004, the starting date for the damage and needs assessment and project \nappraisal. The Government was advised that approval of such advance action does not commit \nADB to finance any part of the Project.  \n \n\n7. \n\nRetroactive Financing \n\n52. \nThe  Project  provides  for  retroactive  financing  of  immediate  rehabilitation  of  key \ninfrastructure and facilities and for consulting services. ADB management has agreed to provide \nretroactive financing of $25 million eligible expenditures incurred not earlier than 12 September \n2004  (date  of  appraisal),  provided  that  the  expenditures  are  in  accordance  with  agreed \nprocedures and are certified by the EAs and the consultants, and the certification is acceptable \nto ADB. Retroactive financing will be approved under the following conditions: (i) the consultants \nare  in  the  field  and  have  prepared  the  subproject,  (ii)  contracts  over  $50,000  equivalent  were \napproved by ADB, and (iii) works were procured according to tender procedures acceptable to \nADB and certified by the consultants. The Government was advised that provision of retroactive \nfinancing does not commit ADB to finance any part of the Project.   \n \n\n8. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n53. \nAll disbursement procedures of the loan will follow ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. \nDirect  payment  procedures  will  be  followed  for  consulting  services  and  procurement  of  civil \nworks  and  goods  under  international  competitive  bidding.  Except  for  Part  B,  imprest  account \nprocedures will be followed for local bidding for civil works and goods. The imprest account will \nbe  established  in  Bangladesh  Bank.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditures  will  be  followed  for \nreimbursement  of  expenditures  and  for  liquidation  of  each  imprest  account  for  payments  not \nexceeding $100,000 equivalent in each case. The imprest account will be replenished on an as-\nrequired basis, within the total loan amounts for each project component subject to confirmation \nthat sufficient progress has been achieved in terms of actual implementation compared with the \nexpenditures  incurred.  For  Part  B,  reimbursement  procedures  will  follow  current  practices  for \nADB-financed road projects with the Roads and Highways Department as EA.  \n \n\n \n\n\f17\n\n9. \n\nAccounts, Audit, and Reports \n\na. \n\nAccounts and Audit \n\n \nEach EA will maintain records and accounts adequate to identify the goods and services \n54. \nfinanced  by  the  loan  proceeds,  financing  sources  received,  expenditures  incurred,  and  use  of \nlocal  funds.  The  accounts  will  be  set  up  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles. \nConsolidated  project  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  by  the \nComptroller and Auditor General of the Government acceptable to ADB. The audited reports and \nrelated financial statements in English will be submitted to ADB not later than 6 months after the \nend of the fiscal year to which they relate.  \n \nAll  project  activities  will  be  subject  to  independent  performance  audit  to  ensure \n55. \ntransparency  and  objective  and  independent  assessment  of  such  activities.  The  performance \naudit will be conducted annually and randomly during project implementation and be carried out \nby external auditors to be selected by the Government in consultation with ADB. In addition, ADB \nwill conduct project procurement audits during implementation as part of its regular reviews.                                   \n \n\n \n\nReports \n\n \n\nb. \n \n\n56.  While the PSC will monitor overall implementation progress, each EA will prepare brief \nprogress statements and submit these to the PSC with a copy to ADB at the end of each month. \nIn addition, they will submit quarterly reports to the PSC and ADB. Within 3 months of physical \ncompletion of the Project, the Government will provide ADB through the PSC an overall project \ncompletion  report  providing  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  project  design,  costs,  contractor  and \nconsultant performance, social and economic impact, and other details requested by ADB.  \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n57. \nEach EA will carry out project performance monitoring and evaluation in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Project  Performance  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Handbook.  Baseline  indicators  and \ntargets for each sector and subproject will be developed prior to implementation for monitoring \npurposes as well as for checking against selection criteria. The outputs will provide inputs to the \nProject\u2019s quarterly progress reporting.  \n \n\n11. \n\nProject Review \n\n58. \nADB will conduct regular reviews throughout project implementation. Given the relatively \nshort  implementation  period  and  emergency  nature  of  the  Project,  no  midterm  review  will  be \nconducted, unless deemed necessary by ADB and the Government.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \n\n59. \nADB  will  provide  a  TA  grant  of  $150,000  to  support  financial  management  and \nmonitoring  (Appendix  11).  The  TA  will  help  the  Government  build  capacity  in  financial \nmanagement  and  related  areas  to  effectively  carry  out  monitoring  functions  and  evaluation  of \nproject  performance.  The  TA  will  include  design  of  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  strategy,  risk \nassessment approach, and assessment of cost-effectiveness; and provide support in assessing \nperformance. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program.  \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f18\n\n \n\nADB  will  also  provide  a  TA  grant  of  $250,000  for  an  early  warning  systems  study \n60. \n(Appendix  12).  The  TA  will  be  financed  on  grant  basis  by  ADB's  TA  funding  program.  The \nGovernment of the Netherlands has expressed interest in financing the TA. When this interest is \nconfirmed, the funds from ADB's TA funding program will be replaced by a corresponding grant \nfrom  the  Government  of  Netherlands  and  will  be  administered  by  ADB.  The  TA  will  provide \nanalytical input, including capacity building, to enhance existing flood forecasting system of the \nBangladesh Water Development Board and related systems.  \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Benefits  \n\nSelected  subprojects  will  be  technically  feasible,  cost-effective,  and  represent  a  least-\n61. \ncost alternative with appropriate adjustment for flood-resistant designs. Based on initial damage \nassessment, and considering the project completion report and project performance audit report \nfindings of past flood damage rehabilitation projects in Bangladesh, the economic internal rate \nof  return  for  subprojects  is  expected  to  substantially  exceed  12%.  Conducted  reevaluation  of \npast  flood  damage  rehabilitation  subprojects  in  Bangladesh  involving  rehabilitation  of  major \nroads found the economic internal rates of return to range from 18% to 55%.  \n \nB. \n\nPoverty and Other Impacts \n\n62. \nPoverty  Impact.  Flood  disasters  affect  the  poor  disproportionately  in  terms  of  health, \nhousing, employment, livelihood, and food security. A high incidence of poverty is evident in the \nproject area, ranging from 30% to as high as 57%, based on poverty mapping.28 Of the 13 worst \nflood-affected  districts,  10  have  chronic  poverty  levels  above  the  national  level  (35.5%),  as \nmeasured by human poverty index. Chronicity of poverty, also measured by the index, in these \ndistricts ranges between 32.7% and 41.9%. The poorer income groups having lost assets and \nincome  have  been  worst  affected  by  the  floods.  Urban  slum  dwellers  living  in  poorly  drained \nareas  suffered  from  prolonged  water  logging,  with  high  prevalence  of  waterborne  diseases. \nBasic  facilities  and  key  infrastructure  have  to  be  restored  if  the  affected  communities  are  to \nrecover from the effects of the 2004 flood following the relief and rescue support provided by the \nGovernment,  UN  agencies,  and  many  bilateral  agencies.  The  Project  will  benefit  the  people, \nespecially the poor, in the flood-affected areas by restoring rural infrastructure, and community \ninfrastructure facilities. By rehabilitating vital public and community infrastructure, the Project will \nhelp restore essential economic and social activities disrupted by the flood. The repair of roads, \nbridges,  and  railway  tracks,  and  improvement  of  transport  infrastructure  will  restore  basic \naccess and services to health and educational facilities. Time savings will facilitate business and \nnonfarm employment. The greater access to markets for cash crops, vegetables, livestock, and \nemployment,  as  well  as  the  decline  in  the  price  of  agricultural  inputs  will  contribute  to  poverty \nreduction  by  accelerating  growth  in  poor  people\u2019s  per  capita  income  and  assets.  The  flood \ncontrol  and  irrigation  measures  will  protect  people  exposed  to  risk  of  inundation  from  future \nflooding  and  raise  agricultural  output.  Improvement  of  municipal  infrastructure  will  improve \nhealth  conditions  particularly  of  the  slum  dwellers  with  improved  water  supply  and  sanitation, \nand  create  greater  access  to  employment  opportunities.  A  summary  of  the  poverty  reduction \nand social strategy is in Appendix 13.  \n \n\n                                                 \n28  Based  on  poverty  mapping  carried  out  by  (i)  Bangladesh  Institute  of  Development  Studies,  Dhaka,  Bangladesh \n\n(2000); (ii) Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (1995); and (iii) World Food Program (2001). \n\n \n\n\f19\n\nEmployment Generation. The Project will provide significant employment opportunities \n63. \nfor  skilled  and  unskilled  labor  during  implementation.  The  Project  will  also  create  employment \nopportunities for the poor in the project areas, generating about 12 million person-days of skilled \nand  unskilled  labor  employment.  The  Project  will  also  have  positive  externalities,  which  will \nimprove  the  livelihood  of  the  poor.  The  poverty  reduction  aspects  will  be  enhanced  by \nencouraging  contractors  to  engage  local  workers,  including  women,  in  project  areas;  and  by \nusing labor contracting societies for small earthworks, utilizing poor women in the project areas.  \n \nC. \n\nSocial Impacts  \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n64. \nSince rehabilitation will take place on existing infrastructure locations, the Project is not \nanticipated  to  require  land  acquisition  or  involve  involuntary  resettlement.  Each  subproject  will \nbe  designed  to  ensure  that  improvement  will  be  within  the  existing  rights-of-way.  However,  to \ncomply with ADB\u2019s safeguard policy requirements for a sector loan, a resettlement framework, \nas presented in Appendix 14, has been agreed upon by the Government and ADB to address \nany  possible  adverse  impacts  relating  to  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement.  The \nProject  is  unlikely  to  affect  any  indigenous  people.  In  the  event  of  their  involvement  in  any \nsubprojects,  all  necessary  actions  required  under  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1999) \nwill be taken.  \n \nD.  \n \n65. \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  category  B,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy \n(2002).  The  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  for  the  entire  Project  was  conducted  to \ndetermine the degree of likely impacts and describe possible mitigation measures. The Project \ninvolves  only  rehabilitation  of  previously  existing  infrastructure  previously  or  currently  used  for \nthe same or similar purposes. The IEE concluded that it is not likely to generate any significant \nenvironmental  impacts  during  the  construction  and  operation  periods.  All  subprojects  will  be \nrequired  to  complete  and  satisfy  an  environmental  assessment  screening  checklist  during \nformulation.  Recommended  mitigation  measures  will  be  incorporated  into  subprojects\u2019  design \nand  contractors\u2019  work  assignments.  The  Project  is  expected  to  have  several  environmental \nbenefits, \nfailure  of  embankments  along  damaged \ninfrastructure; and reducing health risks by rehabilitating damaged water supply and sanitation \nfacilities,  and  cleaning  drainage  systems.  In  cases  where  the  rapid  environmental  checklist \nindicates that further analysis is required,29 an IEE will be conducted to identify and implement \nmitigation measures and monitoring. The EAs are familiar with ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines \nand procedures. However, to ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s environmental policy and with the \nGovernment\u2019s  environmental  requirements,  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedures \nare provided in the summary IEE (Appendix 15) to guide subproject implementation. \n \nE.  \n\nland  erosion  and \n\nincluding \n\nlimiting \n\nRisks \n\n66. \nA potential risk is that procedural delays in obtaining various Government approvals will \nslow  implementation.  The  Government  has  shown  strong  commitment  to  the  Project  and  has \nadopted  simplified  procedures,  which  were  successfully  used  in  past  ADB-financed  flood \ndamage  rehabilitation  projects.  The  selection  of  EAs  with  considerable  experience  in \nimplementing  ADB-financed  projects  and  familiar  with  ADB  procedures,  implementation  by \n\n                                                 \n29  If any subprojects requires (i) a change in alignment (for roads, canals, dikes, and bridges) for safety reasons; (ii) a \nlarge borrow pit, or (iii) a large command area (for irrigation), an IEE will be conducted and the IEE report will be \nsent to ADB for its review and approval. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f20\n\n \n\ntransparent \n\nestablished  project  implementation  units,  and  use  of  existing  or  directly  selected  consultants \nminimizes delay at the EA level. The availability of counterpart funding has not been a problem \nto  date  in  ADB  projects  in  Bangladesh  and  ongoing  International  Monetary  Fund  and  World \nBank support will generate adequate counterpart funds.  \n \nGovernance-related  issues,  including  corruption,  constitute  another  risk.  This  is \n67. \naddressed  by  detailed  selection  criteria, \nimplementation  and  monitoring \nmechanisms, and specific financial controls including regular as well as random audits and the \nuse  of  external  auditors.  Measures  used  include  strict  construction  supervision  and  strong \nconsultant  support,  use  of  the  PPR,  close  monitoring  by  BRM  staff,  and  random  procurement \nand annual performance auditing at the EA level. The PSC will be supported by monitoring and \nevaluation  specialists  from  the  Implementation  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Division  of  the \nMinistry  of  Planning.  The  division  will  be  supported  by  an  external  consultant  who  will  (i)  help \nmonitor all project activities, (ii) conduct random spot checks during project implementation, (iii) \nprovide capacity building in key areas of monitoring and evaluation. A third risk is recurrence of \nmajor floods in the future and related extensive damage. This risk is addressed by adoption of \nappropriate  flood-resistant  design  standards  including  capacity  building,  which  is  expected  to \nreduce damage from future floods. The risk of inadequate maintenance is addressed by close \nmonitoring and ongoing policy dialogue by BRM.   \n \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances  \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n68. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:     \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nProject  Steering  Committee  (PSC).  The  PSC,  chaired  by  the  Member  for \nProgramming  of  the  Planning  Commission  of  the  Ministry  of  Planning,  shall  be \nresponsible  for  monitoring  the  implementation  of  the  Project  and  overseeing  all \nProject  governance-related  matters,  including  any  issues  that  may  arise  due  to \nmismanagement  and  breach  of  quality  standards  in  design  or  execution  of  the \nProject.  It  will  meet  at  regular  intervals  but  at  least  every  60  days  to  review \nprogress  of  the  Project.  Prior  to  each  such  meeting,  IMED  shall  provide  to  the \nChairman and each member of the PSC with a copy to ADB a written report on \ntheir findings with respect to monitoring of the Project activities over the relevant \nprior period. The PSC may, from time to time, invite independent experts drawn \nfrom  reputable  national \nits \nresponsibilities.  The  Chairman  or  any  member  of  the  PSC  may  request  for \nenlistment  of  such  an  expert.  The  cost  of  enlisting  such  expert  participation,  if \nany, shall be borne out of the unallocated funds in the Project budget. \nProject management unit (PMU). Each of LGED, RHD, BWDB and BR shall be \nresponsible for implementing its designated Part or Parts of the Project through \ntheir  respective  Project  Management  Units  (PMUs).    Each  of  the  PMUs  shall \nreport  on  the  progress  of  their  respective  Part(s)  of  the  Project  at  least  once \nevery 60 days to the PSC. \nSubproject  selection  criteria  and  monitoring.  The  Government  will  ensure \nthat  all  subprojects  meet,  to  the  satisfaction  of  ADB,  the  agreed  general  and \nsector-specific  selection  criteria  and  implementation  arrangements,  and  that  all \nsubprojects are properly controlled and monitored to the satisfaction of ADB.  \n\nthe  discharge  of \n\ninstitutions \n\nto  assist \n\nin \n\nit \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n21\n\nOperation  and  maintenance.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  facilities \nrehabilitated  under  the  Project  are  properly  operated  and  maintained  by  the \nrelevant EA concerned in accordance with sound practices. To this end, within 6 \nmonths of the date of loan effectiveness, each of the relevant EAs will prepare an \naction  plan  that  will  include  maintenance  plans  with  funding  requirements  and \nother  pertinent  elements  for  year-round  effective  maintenance  of  rehabilitated \nfacilities.  A  copy  of  the  action  plan  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  follow-up.  The \nGovernment  will  make  available,  on  a  timely  basis,  the  necessary  funds  for \noperation  and  maintenance  during  and  after  implementation  of  the  Project.  The \nGovernment will allocate, on a timely basis, adequate counterpart funds from its \nbudget for each fiscal year during project implementation.   \nCounterpart  funds.  The  Government  will  allocate,  on  a  timely  basis,  adequate \nfiscal  year  during  project \ncounterpart \nimplementation.  \nDelegation  of  financial  powers.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  delegated \nfinancial  powers,  as  approved  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  on  1  July  2004  and  4 \nJuly 2004 are followed for this Project.    \n\nits  budget \n\nfor  each \n\nfunds \n\nfrom \n\n(vii)  Beneficiary participation. The EAs will actively seek beneficiary participation in \nthe  selection,  design,  and  implementation  of  all  rehabilitation  works  carried  out \nunder the Project.  \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  Environment.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  adequate  environmental \nmitigation  measures  in  accordance  with  (a)  the  Government\u2019s  environmental \nregulations  and  (b)  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002),  and  (c)  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines (2003) are incorporated into all subproject \ndesigns  and  implementation.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  agreed \nenvironmental  assessment  framework  (Appendix  15)  is  implemented;  that  all \nsubprojects  for  which  an  IEE  is  required  include  such  an  IEE  in  the  subproject \nproposals;  and  that  all  subprojects  for  which  Government  environmental \nclearance  is  required  obtain  such  clearance  prior  to  the  award  of  any  contracts \nfor that subproject.  \nEnvironment  mitigation  measures.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  ADB-\nfinanced  contracts  under  the  Project  include  contractual  clauses  during  design \nand  construction  requiring  that  all  necessary  steps  be  taken  to  avoid  adverse \nconsequences  to  the  natural  environment,  noise  pollution,  and  environmental \nhygiene-related issues: and as pertains to the selection of sites for extraction of \nconstruction  materials  and  selection  of  roads  for  transporting  such  construction \nmaterials. \nResettlement.  The  Government  will  ensure  that,  to  the  extent  possible, \nsubprojects  will  not  require  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement.  In  the \nevent  that  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement  is  required  for  any \nsubproject, then the Government will prepare a resettlement plan in accordance \nwith  the  Government\u2019s  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nInvoluntary Resettlement (1995), ADB\u2019s Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to \nGood Practice (1998), and the summary resettlement framework (Appendix 14); \nand  submit  it  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval  before  any  land  acquisition  is \ninitiated. \nGender.  The  Government  will  ensure  that,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nGender and Development (1998), (a) project interventions take into account the \ndifferent impacts and needs of women and men; (b) special features are built into \nsubprojects  to  facilitate  and  encourage  women\u2019s  involvement  and  to  ensure \ntangible  benefits  to  women;  (c)  specific  women-related  interventions  include \n\n(xi) \n\n(x) \n\n \n\n\f22\n\n \n\nactivities that uplift women from situations of vulnerability to positions of stability; \nand (d) project reporting reflects how gender-related needs are being addressed \nunder the Project, and details the successes encountered, constraints met, and \nmeasures adopted to overcome them. \nIndigenous people. The Government will ensure that subprojects will not affect \nvulnerable  population  groups,  such as  indigenous  peoples.  In  the  event  of  their \ninvolvement  in  any  of  the  subprojects,  the  Government  will  take  necessary \nactions required under ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998).  \n\n(xii) \n\n(xiii)  Project monitoring and review. The Government shall ensure that each Project \nExecuting  Agency  shall  conduct  annual  and  random  performance  audits  during \nproject implementation to determine the degree to which project funds have been \neffectively  and  efficiently  utilized  to  implement  the  project  and  achieve  its \nobjectives, outputs and performance indicators. \n\n(xiv)  Performance  audits.  The  Government  and  the  EA  concerned  will  engage \nprivate  sector  auditors  to  conduct  quarterly  independent  performance  audits \nduring  project  implementation  to  determine  the  degree  to  which  project  funds \nhave been effectively and efficiently utilized to implement the Project and achieve \nits objectives, outputs, and performance indicators.  \n\n(xv)  Anticorruption.  Consistent  with \n\nits  commitment \n\nto  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate  directly, \nor  through  its  agents,  any  possible  financial  or  management  impropriety  in \nconducting  the  Project.  The  Government  and  the  EAs  concerned  agree  to \ncooperate  with  any  such  investigation  and  extend  necessary  assistance, \nincluding  access  to  all  relevant  books  and  records,  as  well  as  engagement  of \nindependent  experts  that  may  be  needed  for  satisfactory  completion  of  such \ninvestigations. All external costs related to the investigations will be borne by the \nProject.  \n\n(xvi)  Standing orders for disasters. On or prior to 30 April 2005, the Government will \nhave  reviewed  the  Standing  Orders  for  Disasters  with  the  aim  to  strengthen \ncoordination; effectiveness of relief, and rescue operations and medical support; \nand disaster preparedness and mitigation. The review shall be completed by 30 \nJune 2005 and a draft revised Standing Order for Disasters released for review \nby ADB and for general public comment on or before 30 September 2005.   \n(xvii)  Review of ADB project portfolio and design standards. The Government, the \nEA concerned and ADB will complete within 6 months of the signing of the loan \nagreement  a  review  of  each  of  the  prior  approved  projects  currently  active  on \nADB\u2019s  portfolio  of  projects  in  Bangladesh  to  assess  how  their  design  and \noperational methods could be improved to better mitigate possible recurrence of \nflooding  and  other  natural  disasters  and,  where  necessary,  identify  specific \nchanges  in  the  design  of  the  relevant  project.  The  Government  will  promptly \nadopt  amendments  in  the  project  design  or  operations,  if  any,  that  are \nrecommended at the conclusion of the review process. \n\nConditions of Loan Effectiveness \n\nThe following are specified as conditions to the effectiveness of Loan: \n\n(i) \n\nThe Government shall have established a Project Steering Committee under the \nchairmanship  of  Member  for  Programming  of  the  Government\u2019s  Planning \nCommission  and  each  of  the  Project  Management  Units  at  the  relevant  Project \n\n \nB. \n\n69. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f23\n\nExecuting  Agencies  shall  have  been  rendered \nassignment of appropriately qualified staff;

Since  1904,  floods  in  Bangladesh  have  killed  49,680,  injured \n102,020,  and  rendered  60,853,724  homeless.  Around  339  million  inhabitants  have  been \naffected, and the damage wrought by the floods valued a minimum of $9.2 billion.1 In the last 50 \nyears,  at  least  six  major  floods  have  affected  up  to  75%  of  Bangladesh's  land  area,  causing \nsignificant  economic  and  social  losses.2  Because  Bangladesh  is  1  of  the  10  most  densely \npopulated  countries  in  the  world3,  the  recurrent  floods  and  their  effects  have  caused  human \nsuffering on a massive scale (Table A2.1). \n \n\nTable A2.1: Significant Flood Disasters in Bangladesh 1954\u20132003 \n \n\nImpact \n\nEvent \n1954 floods  Affected 55% of the country \n1974 flood \n1984 flood \n1987 floods \n1988 floods  61% of country inundated; 2,000 to 6,500 estimated deaths; 45 million homeless \n1998 floods  100,000 square kilometers inundated; 30 million homeless; 500,000 homes \n\n2,000 deaths; followed by famine with 30,000 deaths \nInundated 52,520 square kilometers  \nInundated over 50,000 square kilometers; 2,055 deaths \n\ndamaged; 1,100 deaths \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates  \n \n2. \nThe suffering continues even after the floods have subsided. Recurrent floods contribute \nto the shifting of river courses and result in river bank erosion and siltation. River bank erosion \nrenders  land  uncultivable,  and  annually  deprives  an  estimated  100,000  inhabitants  of  their \nlivelihood.  Siltation  closes  the  distributary  channels'  off-takes  and  deprives  distributaries  from \nreceiving  water  from  the  parent  channels  during  the  dry  months.  The  result  is  drought  and \nfamine. The damage wrought by floods in Bangladesh is staggering, especially when compared \nwith the damage suffered by other countries that are vulnerable to floods (Table A2.2). \n \n\nTable A2.2: Effect of Floods in Selected Developing Member Countries \n\n \n\nHomeless per \nFlood Event \n\n \nCountry \nBangladesh \n4,484,569\nCambodia \n1,150,095\nIndonesia \n49,643\nPhilippines \n165,597\n769,839\nViet Nam \nSources: EM-DAT: The OFDA/CRED International Disaster Database, www.em-dat.net - Universit\u00e9 catholique de \nLouvain - Brussels \u2013 Belgium.

In 1988, the damage caused by floods was valued at $1.0 billion. A year later, flood-\nrelated damage cost the country $1.2 billion. In 1998, flood-related damage reached $2.8 billion. \n3  Bangladesh has a population of around 130 million inhabiting an area of approximately 147,000 km2. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27\n\nlocation, \n\nCauses of Flooding \n\nBangladesh's  geographic \n\ntopography,  and  climate  render \n\nIn  Bangladesh,  an  average  of  801  people  die  whenever  a  disaster  caused  by  floods \n3. \noccurs.  In  addition,  an  average  of  1,646  are  injured,  981,512  are  rendered  homeless,  and \n4,484,569 are otherwise affected by a flood disaster.  \n \nB.  \n \n4. \nit  extremely \nvulnerable  to  recurrent  flooding.  The  entire  country  is  a  delta  formed  by  sediment  deposits \ncarried  by  three  major  rivers\u2014the  Brahmaputra,  Ganges,  and  Meghna.  The  Ganges-\nBrahmaputra-Meghna basin is relatively young and is undergoing a major river-forming process. \nFlooding is a natural part of this process. Bangladesh's topography is mostly flat. Sixty percent \nof  the  country  is  less  than  6  meters  above  sea  level,  and  around  71%  of  its  land  is  regularly \nsubject  to  flood  inundation.  It  has  a  tropical,  humid  climate,  and  its  dry  season  lasts  only  3 \nmonths of the year. The average annual rainfall is between 1,200 and 6,500 millimeters. \n \n5. \nBangladesh generally experiences four types of floods: (i) flash floods, (ii) floods caused \nby  torrential  rains,  (iii)  river  floods,  and  (iv)  floods  caused  by  storm  surges  and  tidal  flooding. \nFlash floods, which occur within a period of a few minutes to a few hours, often occur in areas at \nthe  foot  of  the  northern  and  eastern  hills,  and  are  the  result  of  heavy  rainfall  occurring  in \nneighboring  upland  areas.  Rain-fed  floods  occur  where  natural  drainage  systems  have \ndeteriorated or have been disturbed by human interference. When intense rainfall takes place in \nthose  areas,  natural  drainage  systems  cannot  carry  the  runoff  generated  by  the  storm  and \ncauses  temporary  inundation.  River  floods  result  from  the  snowmelt  in  the  Himalayas,  and \nheavy  monsoon  rainfall  over  the  Himalayas,  Assam,  Tripura  hills,  and  the  upper  Brahmaputra \nand  Ganges  floodplains  outside  Bangladesh.  When  the  water  levels  in  the  three  major  rivers \nrise simultaneously, extreme flood events occur all over Bangladesh. Storm surges cause floods \nalong  the  coastal  areas.  Storm  surges  cause  high  sea  levels  because  of  low  barometric \npressure combined with strong onshore winds. Continental shelves along the Bay of Bengal are \nshallow, and the coast in the eastern portion is conical and funnel-like in shape. \n \n6. \nIn  recent  years,  urban  flooding,  or  the  inundation  of  urban  areas,  has  become  more \nprevalent,  due  to  the  practice  of  filling  up  low-lying  areas  within  cities.  The  practice  has \ndestroyed  the  natural  drainage  system  in  these  areas.  As  a  result,  floods  have  affected \nmetropolitan areas such as Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna, Rajshahi, and Sylhet, as well as towns \nlike Comilla, Jessore, Mymensingh, Noakhali, and Rangpur. \n \nC.  \n \n7. \nGovernment  flood  control  policy  has  been  intertwined  with  issues  of  securing \nBangladeshi's life and property, livelihood, and food security. In 1964, the Government prepared \na  water  development  master  plan  that,  among  other  things,  recommended  the  construction  of \nembankments  on  the  major  rivers.  The  plan's  implementation  continued  until  the  late  1980s, \nand  more  than  7,000  km  of  river  embankments  were  constructed.  As  a  result,  the  population \ndensity within the protected areas increased, and livelihood activities moved away from fishing \nto intensive agriculture.  \n \n8. \nIn  the  1970s,  the  Government  embarked  on  small  and  medium-scale  flood  control, \ndrainage,  and  irrigation  projects  that  contributed  to  increasing  agricultural  products  and \nprotecting agricultural crops from floods. Total investments put into these projects totaled $4.0 \nbillion,  and  provided  flood  protection  to  5.37  million  hectares  of  land  out  of  about  8  million \nhectares  of flood-vulnerable  land,  or  35%  of  total  land  area.  However,  some  of  these  projects \n\nFlood Management Policies, Strategies, and Control Measures \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n28\n\nAppendix 2 \n\nhad  adverse  environmental  impacts,  including  the  alteration  of  tidal  river  morphology,  and \nnegative effects on fish resources and navigation.  \n \n9. \nIn the mid-1980s, the Government began preparing Bangladesh's National Water Plan. \nThe  plan  focused  on  water  resource  management  and  development  for  agricultural  and \nnonagricultural use. The first phase was completed in 1987 and the second phase in 1991. The \nplan\u2019s analysis of flooding was subsequently superseded by the Flood Action Plan, created by \nthe  Government  after  the  1987  and  1988  floods.  The  plan  comprised  approximately  26 \ncomponents  including  five  regional studies and  numerous  thematic  studies  covering  technical, \nenvironmental, and social issues.  \n \n10. \nThe culmination of the Flood Action Plan was the publication of the Bangladesh Water \nand Flood Management Strategy in September 1995. The National Water Policy was declared \nin  1999.  The  National  Water  Management  Plan  was  formulated  and approved  in  March  2004. \nAccess  to  safe  drinking  water  and  sanitation  is  its  top-most  priority.  The  National  Water \nManagement Plan envisages the water sector regulated under law with independent regulatory \nbodies formed to ensure quality and cost-effective water service delivery.   \n \n11. \nThe  Government  has  adopted  both  structural  and  nonstructural  measures  to  control \nfloods  in  Bangladesh.  Among  the  structural  measures  it  has  adopted  are  the  construction  of \nembankments,  polders,  dams,  barrages,  regulators,  sluices,  channel  improvements,  and \nmethods  for  river  closure.  Embankments  have  been  found  to  be  the  most  convenient  and \neconomical method of controlling floods for strategic and large urban areas. On the other hand, \nthe  Government's  nonstructural  measures  for  flood  management  include  the  establishment  of \nthe  Flood  Forecasting  and  Warning  Center.  The  Government  decided  to  improve  the  center's \nforecasting  services  in  1991,  when  a  flood  forecast  model  was  developed.  At  present,  flood \nforecast services are provided at 50 stations. Flood monitoring is being conducted at another 30 \nstations. Flood forecasts have a lead time of 24 to 48 hours, and all forecasts are given on real-\ntime basis. Longer lead times are, however, required to issue earlier warnings. In addition, more \ndata  is  needed  from  the  upper  river  basins  in neighboring  countries, as  is  active collaboration \nwith the countries in the subregion on river management issues.   \n \nD. \n \n12. \nAs  a  priority,  the  Government  needs  to  integrate  disaster  risk  considerations  into \nnational  development  planning  and  programs  to  improve  sustainable  development  outcomes \nand  to  develop  stronger  institutions,  mechanisms,  and  community  capacities  that  can \nsystematically  build  resilience  to  natural  hazards  and  disasters.  Nonstructural  measures  for \nflood  management  and  protection  need  to  be  given  higher  priority  and  mainstreamed  into  the \nGovernment\u2019s  planning  process.  Short-term  priorities  for  the  Government  include  to  (i)  review \nand  revise  the  Standard  Orders  on  Disasters;  (ii)  build  capacity  and  develop  methodology  for \ndamage  and  needs  assessment;  (iii)  develop  and  adopt  flood-resistant  design  standards  in \npublic  infrastructure  development;  (iv)  update  country-wide  topographical  and  elevation  data, \nand use these data to create a digital elevation model; (v) enhance the existing flood forecasting \nsystem  with  respect  to  elevation  data,  and  provide  linkage  to  major  infrastructure  and \nagricultural  land;  and  (vi)  enhance  the  weather  forecasting  period  from  the  current  2  days  to \nlonger periods up to 20\u201330 days).  \n \nIn  the  medium  term,  improvements  are  needed  in  all  phases  of  the  hazard  risk \n13. \nmanagement  cycle  (preparedness, reconstruction,  recovery,  and  prevention),  adopting  a  more \ncomprehensive  risk  management  approach  and  strategy.  Promulgation  of  a  water  act  is  an \n\nKey Priorities in Flood Management and Risk Reduction \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n29\n\nimportant  step  to  strengthen  the  legal  framework.  Increased  subregional  cooperation  in  water \nmanagement  issues  is  critical  for  sustainable  development  of  the  large  Ganges-Brahmaputra-\nMeghna  river  basin.  In  addition,  urban  flooding  needs  greater  attention  and  higher  priority, \nespecially in Dhaka, including more resources allocated for improving drainage and sewage in \nurban areas.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n30\n\nAppendix 3 \n\nRURAL INFRASTRUCTURE \n\nDamage and Impact \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  damage  includes  paved  roads,  earthen  roads,  bridge/culverts,  and  some  growth \n1. \ncenter markets. Some other infrastructure facilities, such as, union parishad complex and ghat, \nwere not included as the extent of damages were not substantial and can be repaired by local \nresources.  Immediately  after  the  floods  started  receding,  the  Local  Government  Engineering \nDepartment  (LGED),  together  with  the  help  of  consultants  working  under  its  ongoing  projects, \ncarried out an assessment of the flood damage on rural infrastructure nationwide. The outcome \nof the damage assessment shows that the unusual high water flow and longer duration of the \nflood  has  caused  extensive  damage  to  rural  roads  including  paved  (upazila  and  union  roads) \nand  earthen  roads.  Some  of  the  damage  was  due  to  lack  of  appropriate  maintenance  and/or \nlack  of  skilled  work.  In  the  flooded  areas,  only  few  road  embankments  were  left  above  water. \nWave  action  generated  by  strong  winds  caused  erosion  on  both  sides  of  the  road \nembankments. The flood scoured parts of road embankments that had insufficient waterways. \nLoaded  trucks  and  buses  destroyed  the  surface  of  paved  roads  in  places.  Many  bridge \napproaches were washed away when the flood receded and traffic was completely disrupted for \nmany days. In severe cases, only bridges were left and approach roads on both sides of bridges \ndisappeared. In addition, another subsequent flooding in September caused further damage to \nwhat was estimated during the joint Asian Development Bank (ADB) and World Bank Damage \nand Needs Assessment Mission.  \n \n2. \nThe disruption in rural road communication caused significant impact on the livelihood of \nrural  poor  people.  During  the  flood,  the  main  mode  of  transport  measure  was  country  boat. \nSince  the  waters  receded,  uninterrupted  rural  road  communication  has  not  been  restored. \nPermanent  restoration  work  is  needed  to  establish  a  smooth  and  uninterrupted  rural \ncommunication  system  in  the  country.  The  joint  ADB  and  World  Bank  Damage  and  Needs \nAssessment Mission estimated the recovery needs to be about $140 million. \n\n \nScope \n\nB. \n \nThis  project  component  will  rehabilitate  rural  infrastructure,  including  rural  roads \n3. \n(damaged  paved  upazila  and  union  roads)  and  bridges/culverts  located  in  the  9  districts \n(Gaibandha,  Jamalpur,  Kishoregonj,  Kurigram,  Lalmonirhat,  Mymensingh,  Netrakona, \nNilphamary,  and  Sherpur)  under  the  ADB-assisted  Third  Rural  Infrastructure  Development \nProject1  (TRIDP),  and  15  other  districts  (Bogra,  Naogaon,  Sirajgonj,  Tangail,  Sunamganj, \nSylhet, Habigonj, Moulavibazar, Brahmanbaria, Narshingdi, Comilla, Chandpur, Feni, Laxmipur, \nand Noakhali) in the worst affected areas. The TRIDP is scheduled for completion on 30 June \n2005.  Subprojects  will  be  selected  in  close  coordination  with  other  development  partners, \nspecifically  the  World  Bank  and  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  to  avoid  any \nduplication of interventions.  \n \n4. \nThe  proposed  Project  will  finance  the  rehabilitation  of  the  flood  damage  of  the  high \npriority  rural  infrastructure.  About  5,500  kilometers  of  rural  roads  and  13,200  meters  of \nbridges/culverts  will  be  rehabilitated  under  the  Project.  Appropriate  slope  protection  works  at \nvulnerable  points  and  provision  of  adequate  drainage  facilities  will  be  made  as  preventive \nmeasures of future flood damage.

In the initial stage of the \n1. \nfloods,  road  links  were  under  water  and  the  pavement  structures  became  weaker  as  the \nduration of inundation increased. During this time, they were still traversed by trucks and buses, \nwhich  contributed  significantly  to  the  destruction  of  pavement  surfaces;  however,  the  need  to \nmove  people  and  supplies  around  the  country  could  not  be  denied.  The  next  phase  of  road \ndamage  occurred  when  the  floodwaters  started  receding,  and  as  the  water  rushed  to  find \nconvenient  outlets,  embankments  were  scoured,  abutments  washed  away,  and  many  bridges \nand culverts were damaged or disappeared.  \n \n2. \nBased on information available to the Roads and Highways Department (RHD), a total of \n6,728 kilometers (km) of road were submerged, and flooding damaged 2,968 km of pavement, \n306 bridges and culverts, and 26 ferry landings. The total cost of the damage was estimated at \nTk8,405  million  ($140.11  million  equivalent).  The  joint  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and \nWorld Bank Damage and Needs Assessment Mission estimated the recovery needs to be $150 \nmillion.   \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThis  project  component  comprises  rehabilitation  of  flood-damaged  national,  regional, \nand  district  roads,  within  five  of  the  country\u2019s  seven  road  zones:  Dhaka,  Barisal,  Comilla, \nRajshahi, and Rangpur. This part of the Project will cover all repair and rehabilitation of flood-\ndamaged  roads  and  bridges.  Where  technically  feasible  and  justified,  the  design  of  the \nrehabilitation  work  will  focus  on  mitigation  of  damage  from  future  floods,  e.g.,  raising  the  road \nlevel above the highest flooding level or allowing additional vents where water logging leads to \novertopping. This is in line with the findings of the damage and needs assessment conducted by \nan ADB-World Bank Mission. The survey identified priorities and estimates for the rehabilitation \ncost.  Rehabilitation  works  will  be  carried  out  to  restore  the  facility  to  the  preflood  level  or  to  a \nhigher standard as considered cost-effective in the long run and, where appropriate, will include \nflood protection measures to mitigate damage from future floods. \n \nC. \n \nSubprojects  will  meet  the  general  criteria  for  the  Project  as  outlined  in  para  41  of  the \n4. \nmain  text  of  the  report,  and  construction  of  rehabilitation  works  will  be  implemented  based  on \npriority selection criteria to be prepared by the consultant and agreeable to ADB. In addition, the \nsubproject  will  have  a  value  generally  ranging  from  Tk7.0  million  ($0.116  million)  to  Tk70.0 \nmillion ($1.16 million).  \n \nD. \n \nThe cost of immediate and short-term restoration work1 in the area is about $67.5 million \n5. \nequivalent,  including  consultant  costs  of  $  4.8  million.

Typical damage included embankment erosion and slides, loss of \nballast  and  track  components,  displacement  of  track  at  certain  locations,  damage  to  brick \nabutment  protection  of  bridges,  and  nonfunctional  communication  facilities.  Initial  assessment \nby  Bangladesh  Railway  (BR)  shows  that  about  320  kilometers  (km)  of  track  in  117  spots  and \n110  bridges  in  the  East  Zone  and  96  km  of  track  in  40  spots  and  18  bridges  have  physical \ndamage.  The  joint  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  World  Bank  Damage  and  Needs \nAssessment Mission estimated the recovery needs to be about $20.0 million.  \n \nB. \n \nThe  scope  of  the  railway  component  consists  of  rehabilitation  of  flood-damaged \n2. \ninfrastructure and facilities along the core network to the same or improved level of service prior \nto the 2004 flood.

It  is  based  on  the  initial  assessment  of  damage  conducted  by  BR  assisted  by  an \ninternational consultant and the joint ADB and World Bank Mission. The assessment identifies \npriorities and cost estimates, and provides a preliminary list of damage caused to the track and \nbridges,  types  of  damage,  and  estimated  cost.  The  priorities  defined  in  the  initial  damage \nassessment will be followed during preparation of works and subprojects, but modifications can \nbe  made,  as  appropriate,  in  consultation  with  ADB,  specifically  if  other  damage  is  discovered \nduring  project  implementation.  The  type  of  repairs  will  vary  from  minor  repairs  of  existing \nfacilities \ninfrastructure.

The specialist will undertake external evaluation of the \nrehabilitation  works  through  random  sampling  of  the  ongoing  rehabilitation  works  and  report \nfindings to BWDB and ADB directly upon completion of quarterly evaluations.   \n \nB. \n \n14. \nSmall-scale schemes under LGED damaged by the 2004 flood, will be rehabilitated and \nrepaired  utilizing  funds  including  consulting  services  from  the  ongoing  Second  Small-Scale \nWater Resources Development Project (Loan 1831-BAN(SF).   \n\nSmall-Scale Schemes \n\n \n\n \n\n\f42\n\n \n\nAppendix  7 \n\nMUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE \n\nScope \n\nDamage and Impact \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nThe  2004  flood  caused  severe  damages  to  water  supply,  drainage,  and  sanitation \nsystems  in  the  country.  A  total  of  159  pourashavas  (municipalities)  out  of  about  270  were \naffected  severely.  The  outcome  of  the  damage  assessment  indicates  that  the  floods  together \nwith  heavy  rains  have  caused  extensive  damage  to  municipal  roads,  bridges  and  culverts, \ndrains, public toilets, etc. Urban slum area conditions have deteriorated. Wave action generated \nby  strong  winds  caused  erosion  to  pourashavas\u2019  peripheral  road  embankments.  Many  bridge \napproaches were washed away and traffic was completely disrupted for many days. Collapsing \ndrains and siltation have aggravated the existing shattered environment.  \n \nThe disruption of communication by the damage to urban roads and other infrastructure \n2. \nhas  caused  a  significant  impact  on  the  livelihood  of  urban  residents,  including  those  living  in \nslum  areas.  During  the  floods,  the  main  communication  mode  was  country  boats.  Once  the \nflood receded, different types of waterborne diseases resulted due to the collapse of drainage \nsystems  and  people  suffering  from  communication  disruptions.  Due  to  the  flood,  income  of \npourashava households was reduced for some time, and from that, resource mobilization from \npourashavas,  including  tax  collection,  have  been  affected,  making  restoration  of  the  damaged \ninfrastructure  to  the  preflood  state  difficult  with  the  pourashavas'  resources.  Solid  waste \ndisposal, including health and environmental restoration in slums and low-income areas should \nbe given immediate attention. Total damage to municipal infrastructure is estimated at Tk3,099 \nmillion ($52.5 million).  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nroads,  drains, \nbridge/culverts,  and  footpaths  and  drains  in  the  slums  located  in  55  pourashavas  (Bagerhat, \nBhairab,  Bhanga,  Boalmari,  Bogra,  Brahmanbaria,  Chandpur,  Chatkhil,  Comilla,  Dinajpur, \nFaridpur,  Feni,  Gabtali,  Gaibandha,  Gazipur,  Gopalgonj,  Gournadi,  Habigonj,  Jamalpur, \nJhalokathi,  Joypurhat,  Khoksa,  Kishoregonj,  Kumarkhali,  Kushtia,  Lalmonirhat,  Laxmipur, \nMadaripur,  Manikgonj,  Monohordi,  Moulavibazar,  Munshigonj,  Mymensingh,  Nagarkanda, \nNarayangonj,  Narsingdi,  Natore,  Netrakona,  Noakhali,  Pabna,  Patuakhali,  Poshuram,  Raipur, \nRajbari,  Ramganj,  Rangpur,  Satkhira,  Savar,  Shahjadpur,  Shariatpur,  Sherpur,  Sirajgonj, \nSunamganj,  Tangail,  and  Tongi).

The \n\n \n\n \n\n\f44\n\n \n\nAppendix  7 \n\nPMU will be properly staffed and assisted by consultants with expertise in engineering, finance, \nand accounting. \n \n9. \nIn  each  pourashava,  a  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  will  be  established  for  the \nProject.  However,  the  existing  PIUs  already  established  at  ADB-assisted  Urban  Governance \nand Infrastructure Improvement Project towns will have responsibility for implementation of the \nflood  damage  rehabilitation  works.  Necessary  additional  technical  staff  may  be  provided  to \nassist  the  PIUs.  The  PIU  will  be  headed  by  the  pourashava  chairperson  and  he/she  will  be \nassisted by the pourashava chief executive officer for day-to-day operations of the Project. The \nPIU will be located within the pourashava office and be responsible for (i) preparation of annual \ndevelopment program for the respective pourashava, (ii) preparation of tender documents, (iii) \ntendering, and (iv) implementation of construction works. An infrastructure improvement section \nwill  be  formed  under  PIU  to  be  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  all  rehabilitation/re-\nconstruction  works  of  physical  infrastructure.  The  section  will  be  headed  by  the  head  of  the \nengineering  section  of  the  concerned  pourashava.  For  close  supervision  of  all  physical  works \nincluding  environmental  activities,  the  regional  superintending  engineer  of  LGED  will  be \nempowered  to  carry  out  regular  supervision,  monitoring,  and  reporting  of  all  project \nimplementation activities to the PMU.

Since  1971,  the  country  has  faced  almost  200  disasters,  including  cyclones,  floods, \ndroughts, and  river  erosion,  causing severe  damage  of  assets  and  lives.  The poorer  income  groups  are \nthe  most  vulnerable  to  disaster  and  have  to  struggle  to  recover  the  loss  of  their  livelihood  almost  every \nyear.  Floods  aggravate  poverty  by  affecting  the  most  poor  and  vulnerable  groups.  Major  floods  (1988, \n1998, 2000, and 2004) particularly affected the poorer segment of the population. The flood-induced rural-\nurban  migration  in  search  of  livelihoods  has  created  pressures  on  urban  areas.  Many  towns  and  the \ncapital Dhaka also face flooding during monsoons, often due to blockage of sewerage and drains. Lack of \nflood protection, damage of infrastructure and transport facilities, combined with inadequate drainage lead \nto  water  clogging  and  overflowing  of  cropland,  water  bodies,  damage  of  housing,  etc.,  leading  to \nwidespread suffering of the poor and making living conditions deplorable. In the recent flood of 2004, more \nthan 33 million people were affected causing huge income losses. The Government\u2019s Poverty Reduction \nStrategy  Paper  emphasizes  infrastructure  development  for  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction,  as \nwell as social protection for the poor. During floods, transport between villages and markets and towns is \nadversely  affected  as  road  and  associated  infrastructure  are  submerged.  Economic  activities  are \nhampered leading to large-scale unemployment, particularly for the poor in the nonformal sector. Damage \nof water and sanitation infrastructure leads to diseases and hazards.  \n \nIn Bangladesh, investment in transport and flood control infrastructure is critical in the overall process of \nsustainable poverty reduction. Infrastructure development projects have been highly effective in reducing \npoverty by directly or indirectly generating income. Roads and markets can influence poverty reduction by \ncreating  new  employment  opportunities,  especially  in  the  nonfarm  sectors,  as  well  as  by  changing  input \nand output prices. Transport infrastructure helps the poor by providing connectivity and access to markets, \nschools, and health centers. Flood control structures are essential to protect people and assets, promote \neconomic growth, and give shelter to the poor during disasters.  \n \nThe Project will be instrumental in reducing the vulnerability of the poor, as well as in contributing to better \nconnectivity  and  access,  and  improving  the  environment.  Rehabilitation  of  road,  railways,  and  flood \nprotection infrastructures will enable the poorer groups to benefit directly from the employment created in \nconstruction  and  operation  and  maintenance,  and  indirectly  though  increased  economic  activities  as  a \nresult  of  the  Project.  The  Project  will  directly  generate  income-earning  opportunities  of  about  12  million \nperson-days for the poor. Restoration of transport infrastructure will support employment for the poor on \nbuses,  trucks,  and  other  traditional  modes  of  transport  on  rural  roads,  in  ancillary  support  and  service \nprovisions,  and  in  trading  by  facilitating  private  sector  operation.  It  will  facilitate  year-round  mobility  for \naccessing  economic  and  social  services,  all  of  which  are  indispensable  to  reduce  poverty.  The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) has so far invested in many infrastructure projects and the proposed Project will \nmake a significant contribution to sustain and enhance the benefits made in the infrastructure sector and in \nreducing poverty. \n \n \n\n \n\n \nA. \n\n \n\n\f56\n\n \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n\nProposed Targeting Classification: General intervention \n\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nFlood disasters affect the poor disproportionately in terms of health, housing, employment, livelihood, and \nfood  security.  A  high  incidence  of  poverty  is  evident  in  the  project  area ranging  from  30%  to  as high  as \n57%, based on poverty mapping.1 Of the 13 worst flood-affected districts, 10 have chronic poverty levels \nabove the national level (35.5%), as measured by human poverty index. Chronicity of poverty, according \nto the index, in these districts ranges between 32.7% and 41.9%. The poorer income groups having lost \nassets and income have been worst affected by the floods. Damage caused by 2004 flood was assessed \nthrough  a  participatory  process  during  the  joint  World  Bank-ADB  Damage  and  Needs  Assessment \nMission.  The  poverty  analysis  and  loss  estimates  are  based  on  the  assessments  and  estimates  of  the \nGovernment,  United  Nations\u2019  agencies,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  other  civil  society \ngroups. During the flood, more than 68 thousand square kilometers were inundated in 39 districts affecting \nmore than 2 million households. The damage included roads, bridges, embankments, railways, water and \nsanitation  infrastructure.  About  1.7  million  people  took  refuge  in  flood  shelters,  mosques,  schools,  and \nother public buildings, highways, and embankments. About 200,000 tubewells in rural areas were affected \nand  required  disinfection  and  repair.  Crop  was  damaged  in  about  2  million  acres  of  land,  3.7  million \nfarmers  were  affected  causing  potential  employment  loss  for  60  million  person-days.  The  livestock  and \npoultry  subsector  suffered  an  estimated  loss  of  2  million  person-days  of  employment,  especially  for  the \npoor  and  women.  About  380,000  microfinance  beneficiaries,  who  are  all  among  the  poor  and  mostly \nwomen,  representing  almost  an  equal  number  of  families  have  suffered  loss  of  their  self-employment \nactivities  and  livelihood.  In  the  manufacturing  sector,  4.6  million  person-days  of  employment  have  been \nlost  in  the  industrial  estates  alone and  in  handloom  sector 2  million  person-days.  These  losses  will  take \ntime  to  recover  and  the  poor  will  face  difficulties  finding  an  income-earning  opportunity,  which  may  lead \nthem  to  sell  assets  and  resort  to  moneylenders.  About  66,000  ponds  were  inundated  affecting  fish \nresources and employment of the rural poor.  \n \nImpact  on  human  health  was  also  tremendous  causing  mostly  waterborne  diseases,  including  around \n100,000  cases  of  waterborne  diseases,  including  diarrhea.  Loss  of  income  and  employment  will  have  a \nlong-term effect on health and nutrition at the household level. Besides, disruption of regular health, EPI, \nfamily  planning,  and  nutrition  services,  damage  of  water  and  sanitation  infrastructure  services  will  have \nlong-term  negative  effects  on  child  and  maternal  health,  population  growth,  etc.,  which  cannot  be \nquantified. Other social impacts of the flood include insecurity among those who have lost assets and had \nto  move  to  shelters,  and  increased  vulnerability  to  poverty.  Loss  of  housing  and  shelters  due  to  flood-\ninduced erosion may lead to rural urban migration. \n \nFood  and  shelters  were  primary  needs  of  people  during  flood.  Many  affected  people  were  given  food, \nshelter,  medicine,  clothes,  etc.  by  NGOs,  other  community  groups,  development  agencies,  and \nphilanthropic groups, as well as the Government. Thus many were served by community resources. But in \nthe recovery phase, the people have identified poor infrastructure facilities as the most important area for \nrehabilitation for  restoring  livelihood and  access  to  other services.  Support  to  restore  income,  water  and \nsanitation facilities, housing, agriculture, etc. have also been identified as other priority areas. \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nA participatory process was adopted to identify the components of the Project during the joint World Bank-\nADB Mission. Later, ADB identified the areas to be supported under an ADB-financed loan jointly with the \nGovernment. The needs assessment and prioritization were done collectively and the components of the \nProject  were  identified  and  discussed  with  all  major  stakeholders  during  the  assessment  and  appraisal \nmission.  ADB  support  for  infrastructure  rehabilitation  was  given  high  priority  by  stakeholders  including \n                                                 \n1  Based  on  poverty  mapping  carried  out  by  (i)  Bangladesh  Institute  of  Development  Studies,  Dhaka,  Bangladesh \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No \n\n(2000); (ii) Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (1995); and (iii) World Food Program (2001). \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n57\n\nrehabilitation of rural and municipal infrastructure, roads (rural and highways), railways, bridges, culverts, \nwater, and irrigation and drainage schemes. The outputs  of the Mission were (i) formulation of a project \ndesign  and  components  to  be  supported,  (ii)  formulation  of  criteria  for  selection  of  infrastructure  for \nrehabilitation  and  improvement,  and  (iii)  estimate  of  budget  for  rehabilitation  support.  In  addition, \nmechanisms  to  ensure  participation  of  poor  and  women  and  ways  for  institutional  strengthening  of  the \nexecuting agencies (EAs) were discussed, and identified.  \n \nTo  strengthen  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  to  implement  the  Project  and  to  increase  sustainability  of  the \ninfrastructure,  a  participatory  approach  will  be  followed  during  project  implementation.  A  sector  like \napproach  will  be  followed  and  subprojects  will  be  identified  and  implemented  through  stakeholder \nparticipation in implementation, operation, and maintenance of improved infrastructure. To ensure efficient \nimplementation,  a  strong  project  steering  committee  will  be  established  with  the  participation  of  all  EAs, \nthe  relevant  ministries  and  chaired  by  the  secretary  of  the  Ministry  of  Planning.  The  local  government \ninstitutions  and  NGOs  will  be  involved  during  identification,  implementation,  and  monitoring  of  the \nsubprojects. Local poor will be involved in construction and operation and maintenance activities and labor \ncontracting  societies  will  be  formed  for  earth  work  and  maintenance  through  tree  plantation.  NGOs  will \nalso be engaged to provide training for the beneficiaries on labor contracting societies and tree plantation \nactivities. \n \nRehabilitation  of  roads,  bridges,  and  other  infrastructure  will  help  the  beneficiaries  participate  in  various \nsocial and economic activities. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe  Project  has  important  gender  implications.  The  rehabilitation  of  damaged  infrastructure  will  support \nwomen in restoring their income and accessing market and various services through the rehabilitation of \ninfrastructure. Substantial short term and seasonal employment will be created for women in construction \nand  maintenance  of  infrastructures.  Women  will  also  participate  in  operation  and  maintenance  activities \nand  thereby  help  restore  their  income.  Efforts  will  be  taken  to  reduce  the  gap  in  wages  for  women  and \nmen  in  construction  activities.  The  Project  will  facilitate  women\u2019s  mobility  for  employment,  income,  and \naccess to services for their families. \n\n \n\n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \nE.

The  findings  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB)-World Bank Damages and Needs Assessment Mission of September \n2004 do not envisage any involuntary resettlement work and/or land acquisition. The potential \nnumber  of  households  that  may  be  affected  is  small  and  will  fall  under  the  category  of \n\u201cinsignificant  resettlement\u201d  under  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nInvoluntary  Resettlement.  However, \nresettlement plans will be prepared accordingly whenever the need for resettlement is identified. \nA resettlement framework has been prepared to ensure that if resettlement needs are identified \nthe  project  implementing  agency  follows  the  procedures  for  involuntary  resettlement  in \ncompliance  with  the  Government\u2019s  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  (1995)  and  Handbook  on  Resettlement  (1998),  and  the  agreed \nresettlement framework for the Project. \n \n2. \nAs  part  of  the  selection  criteria,  subprojects  that  may  entail  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement will be avoided. In extreme scenarios, however, the expected changes in the status \nof a subproject could be (i) raising of the road/railway/bank protection embankment beyond the \nflood  level,  where  necessary;  (ii)  new  construction  and  reconstruction  of  small  bridges  and \nculverts, and in some cases widening the bridges/culverts; and (iii) retiring or resectioning flood \nprotection  embankments.  Therefore,  the  following  resettlement  framework  for  rehabilitation \nworks  was  agreed  to  by  the  Government  and  ADB  to  guide  the  Government  in  preparing  a \nresettlement plan should this be necessary during implementation. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe draft resettlement framework was prepared as the primary document to provide the \nbasis for preparing resettlement plans for subprojects, where necessary. It identifies the broad \nscope  of  the  Project  and  outlines  the  policy,  procedures,  and  institutional  requirements  for \nformulating resettlement plans (RPs) during project implementation. It sets out the policies and \nprocedures to be adopted by the executing agencies (EAs) in the screening and preparation of \nRPs  for  subprojects  before  submission  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval.  The  EAs  will  be \nresponsible  for  preparing  social  analyses  and  RPs  for  subprojects  based  on  the  principles \noutlined  in  this  framework.  The  implementation  of  the  subprojects  is  likely  to  commence  from \nlate 2004.  \n\nPolicy Framework and Entitlements \n\nThe current legislation governing land acquisition for public or development purposes is \n4. \nthe Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Ordinance (1982). The 1982 Ordinance \ndoes  not  cover  project-affected  people  without  titles  or  ownership  records,  such  as  informal \nsettlers/squatters. Also, the compensation paid does not constitute market or replacement value \nof the property acquired.  Furthermore, the Ordinance does not take account of the social and \neconomic consequence of land acquisition in terms of replacement value and restoration of lost \nincome.  Thus,  owing  to  the  absence  of  a  policy  consistent  with  ADB  policy  on  involuntary \nresettlement and poverty reduction, a project-specific resettlement framework and resettlement \n\n \n\n\f60\n\n \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nprocedural guidelines will be adopted. The resettlement framework and resettlement procedural \nguideline stipulations contained in this document will apply to all subprojects to be prepared and \napproved under the Project.  \n\nThe resettlement framework reflects the Government\u2019s land acquisition laws/regulations \n5. \nand  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement  and  guidelines.  It  stipulates  eligibility  and \nprovisions  for  all  types  of  losses  (land,  crops/trees,  structures,  business/employment,  and \nworkdays/wages). Affected households including informal dwellers compensated by the deputy \ncommissioner  for  lost  assets  will  receive  (i)  an  additional  cash  grant  to  match  replacement \nvalue, and (ii) other resettlement assistance such as shifting allowance, compensation for loss \nof  workdays/income  due  to  dislocation.  Households  headed  by  women  and  other  vulnerable \nhouseholds will be eligible for further cash assistance for relocation and house reconstruction. \nTable A14 presents an entitlement matrix, based on potential losses.

For  subprojects,  the  EAs  will  carry \nout  social  impact  assessment  surveys  (census  and  20%  socioeconomic  survey  of  those \naffected), based on preliminary technical designs. If the impact is significant, a full resettlement \nplan will be prepared for project preparation. If the impact is insignificant, less than 200 people, \na short resettlement plan will be sufficient. Detailed terms of reference, approved by ADB, will \nbe  given  to  the  consultants  to  ensure  that  RPs  meet  ADB\u2019s  policy  requirements.  The  RP  will \nalso include measures to ensure that socioeconomic conditions, needs, and priorities of women \nare  identified,  and  that  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  does  not  disadvantage  women.  RPs \nwill  be  reviewed  by  the  EAs  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval.  If  impacts  on \nindigenous  people  are  identified  then  an  indigenous  peoples  development  plan  must  also  be \nprepared  according  to  ADB  guidelines.  Consultants  preparing  the  RPs  must  be  familiar  with \nADB\u2019s requirements in order to comply with the ADB policy on involuntary resettlement. The RP \nmust comply with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement and other social safeguard policies; \nincluding consultation with people affected who will provide local insights in establishing a safety \nnet mechanism.  \n \nD. \n \n7. \nThe concerned EA is responsible for overall coordination, planning, implementation, and \nfinancing.  The  EA  fully  recognizes  the  complexity  of  the  resettlement  for  project-affected \npersons. It, therefore, will hire resettlement specialists as part of the supervision consultants, as \nwell as an experienced nongovernment organization (NGO) for RP implementation with clearly \n\nInstitutional Responsibilities and Resettlement Cost \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n63\n\ndefined  scope/tasks.  The  EA  with  assistance  from  resettlement  specialist(s)  will  undertake  a \nland  acquisition  survey;  census,  and  asset  inventory  survey;  and  prepare  a  full/short \nresettlement  plan  and  proposals  for  land  acquisition  by  subcontracting  an  experienced  local \nagency  under  the  consultancy.  During  the  process,  the  EA  with  the  consulting  assistance  will \nensure  that  (i)  the  agency  responsible  for  RP  preparation  is  aware  of  the  resettlement \nframework  for  resettlement  planning  so  that  appropriate  entitlements  and  mitigation  measures \nare  established  in  the  RP;  and  (ii)  resettlement  budgets  are  delivered  on  time  to  the  deputy \ncommissioner  and  the  implementing  NGO  for  timely  RP  implementation.  The  EA  will  also \nensure  that  the  RP  is  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval,  and  that  funds  for  compensation  and \nentitlement under the RP are fully provided to people affected prior to the award of the civil work \ncontract. \n \nThe  EA  will  implement  the  RPs  by  setting  up  of  a  resettlement  unit  within  the  project \n8. \nmanagement office  established for this Project. The unit, under the overall responsibility of the \nproject  director,  will  undertake  day-to-day  activities  with  the  appointed  NGO  and  consultants. \nThe  unit  will  employ  one  senior  BWDB  official  at  the  rank  of  executing  engineer  as  chief \nresettlement  officer  who  will  supervise  the  implementation  work,  supported  by  supervision \nconsultants.  At  the  field  level,  a  resettlement  coordinator  will  be  assigned  in  the  subproject \nmanagement offices at the rank of assistant engineer to undertake day-to-day activities with the \nappointed  NGO.  The  subproject  level  superintending  engineer  will  provide  the  resettlement \ncoordinator  with  the  necessary  administrative  support  to  implement  the  RPs.  The  project \ndirector  will  ensure  the  land  acquisition  with  assistance  from  district  administrations  and  the \nchief  resettlement  officer.  The  appointed  NGO  will  open  field  offices,  carry  out  an  information \ncampaign,  and  involve  people  affected,  including  women,  in  the  implementation  process  from \nthe  very  beginning.  The  resettlement  unit  will  also  form  grievance  redress  committees  at  the \nproject  level  with  the  project  director  as  chair,  representative  of  the  implementing  NGO  as \nmember  secretary,  representatives  of  the  project  affected  people  including  women,  and \nrepresentatives of the local communities as members. \n \n9. \nThe  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  budget  will  include  all  costs  for  acquisition  of \nassets  and  costs  associated  with  involuntary  resettlement.  The  Government  will  provide  the \nentire  funding  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  fund  for  land  acquisition  will  be \ndisbursed  through  the  deputy  commissioner\u2019s  office  and  the  additional  benefits  will  be  paid \ndirectly by the EA through the implementing NGO. However, the NGOs will assess the quantity \nof losses and the eligible persons for resettlement benefits, and produce a resettlement budget \nto the concerned EA for approval and provisions for the fund.  \n \nE.  \n \n10. \nThe RPs will be prepared and implemented in close consultation with the stakeholders \nand  will  involve  focus  group  discussion  and  meetings,  particularly  with  people  affected  by  the \nProject.  RPs  will  be  disclosed  to  those  affected  as  early  as  possible.  The  resettlement \nframework  will  be  made  available  in  Bangla  during  focus  group  discussion  meetings  at  the \nvillage/community level. Complaints and grievance procedures will be outlined in the RPs and \ngrievance  redress  committees  will  be  established  to  ensure  stakeholders  participation  in  the \nimplementation process. Through public consultations, the those affected will be informed that \nthey  have  a  right  to  grievance  redressal.  They  can  call  upon  the  support  of  the  implementing \nNGO  to  assist  them  in  presenting  their  grievances  or  queries  to  the  grievance  redress \ncommittee.  Other  than  disputes  relating  to  ownership  right  under  the  court  of  law,  grievance \nredress  committees  will  review  grievances  involving  all  resettlement  benefits,  relocation,  and \n\nDisclosure, Consultation, and Grievances \n\n \n\n\f64\n\n \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nother  assistance.  Grievances  will  be  redressed  within  a  month  of  the  date  of  lodging  the \ncomplaints.  \n \n11. \nTo  ensure  peoples  participation,  the  NGO  will  form  resettlement  advisory  committees \ninducting  the  local  leaders  such  as  people's  representatives,  teachers,  imams,  knowledgeable \npersons,  headmen,  etc.  representing  both  men  and  women.

The \nProject  will  follow  a  sector  approach  to  facilitate  selection  of  the  highest  priority  subprojects \nduring implementation. The initial environmental examination (IEE) aims to determine the degree \nof  the  likely  impacts  and  describe  possible  mitigation  measures  for  the  Project.  Subproject  site \nselection,  detailed  design,  and  rehabilitation  work  will  be  carried  out  during  project \nimplementation. Environmental assessment and review procedures were prepared to guide the \nenvironmental  screening  of  each  subproject  and  facilitate  institutional  arrangements  and \ncompliance with the environmental assessment requirements of the Government of Bangladesh \nand Asian Development Bank (ADB).  \n \nB. \n \nThe  Project  will  rehabilitate  the  flood-damaged  facilities  by  providing  civil  works; \n2. \nequipment  and  materials;  and  consulting  services \nfor  project  design,  evaluation  and \nimplementation, and supervision. Because of its emergency nature, the Project does not follow \nthe conventional feasibility study with detailed design phases completed prior to implementation. \nThus, the IEE forms an overall initial scoping of the broad framework of the Project and allows \nkey  environmental  issues  to  be  identified  so  that  the  detailed  subproject  formulation  can  take \nthem into account. Table A15.1 provides the overall project components and the scope of works. \n \n\nDescription of the Project \n\nTable A15.1: Project Components \n \n\nProject \nArea/Zone \n21 districts  Rehabilitate  flood-damaged  rural  infrastructure  facilities  including \nfeeder  roads,  rural  roads,  bridges,  and  culverts.  Main  civil  works \nwill  involve  restoration  and  protection  of  embankment  and \ndrainage  including  tree  planting.  Provision  of  latrines  and  water \nsupply facilities at flood shelters will be included. \n\nScope of Work \n\n2 zones \n\n4 road zones  Rehabilitate  flood-damaged  national,  regional,  and  district  roads \nand bridges.

Average annual rainfall is between 2,200\u20132,500 millimeters (mm); the \nmaximum  range  is  between  1,200  and  6,500  mm.  About  80%  of  the  rainfall  occurs  during \nmonsoon. The entire country is a delta formed by the deposition of sediment carried by the three \nlarge river systems: Brahmaputra, Ganges, and Meghna. Most of Bangladesh is located within a \nmoderate  seismic  zone.  The  Government  has  recently  recognized  the  importance  of  building \nseismic factors into their building codes as well as emergency preparations and plans.   \n \n\n2. \n\nEcological Resources \n\n \n4. \nBangladesh has 230 rivers of which 57 are transboundary rivers. Only 7% of these rivers \noriginate  in Bangladesh.  Annual  flow  volume  of  the  rivers  is  1,200  billion  cubic  meters;  80% of \nthe water flow passes during the monsoon season. The water surface slopes of the major rivers \nare very flat. Water surface slopes of the river during the monsoon season become much flatter, \nimpeding evacuation of flood flow to the sea, causing the flood to spread over the low-lying lands \nfor relatively longer duration.   \n \n5. \nMost  of  the  rivers  are  geologically  young  and  morphologically  very  active.  Major  rivers \ncarry sediment load from the large catchments of 1.8 billion to 2.0 billion tons annually. Shifting \nof the river course, the resulting riverbank erosion, and siltation are the most common problems. \nSiltation  often  causes  closing  of  the  off-takes  of  the  distributory  channels  depriving  the \ndistributaries from receiving flow from the parent channels during dry months. Riverbank erosion \nhas serious socioeconomic impacts on the rural areas. The 2004 flood exacerbated the erosion.   \n \n6. \nBangladesh  harbors  a  diverse  and  extensive  fauna  and  flora.  The  World  Conservation \nUnion (2000a) reported 266 species of freshwater fish and 442 marine. Most of the rehabilitation \nsites  have  natural  vegetation  including  wooded  areas,  grassland,  and  other  natural  habitats; \nnatural forest is absent.   \n \n\n3. \n\nEconomic Development, Social and Cultural Resources \n\n \nBangladesh has a very high population density of over 750 persons per square kilometer. \n7. \nThe overall annual population growth rate is 1.5%, while the annual urban population growth is \naround  4.9%.  This  growth  is  achieved  by  rural-urban  migration  and  territorial  expansion  of  the \nexisting urban areas. Urban population growth is not expected to fall below 4% per annum before \n2010, which will result in an increase in slums and in a shortage of urban infrastructure facilities \nsuch as water supply, sewage, and health.  \n \n8. \nThe overall economic development within the areas covered under the Project is minimal. \nBangladesh has an extensive and diversified transport system, which includes about 220,000 km \nof roads, about 2,700 km of railroads, about 6,000 km of major waterways, two major seaports, \nand  eight  airports.  The  2004  flood  caused  localized  damage  to  transport  sector  infrastructure. \nRoad transport was by far the most affected transport mode.  \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n67\n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\nD. \n \n9. \nThe main purpose of the Project is to rehabilitate and restore the flood-damaged facilities \nand  infrastructure.  As  such,  the  positive  environmental  impacts  are  substantial.  A  rehabilitation \nwork for roads, bridges, railways, and river embankments will be within the right-of-way, and no \nrealignment and widening are expected to be carried out. In addition, the rehabilitation of roads1, \nrailway,  and  river  embankment  will  focus  on  a  specific  damaged  section  and  therefore  will  not \ncover an extensive road and railway length.  \n \n10. \nShort-term minor negative impacts may be associated with civil works, such as dust and \nnoise  generation,  soil  erosion,  and  damage  to  land  and  surface  water  due  to  inappropriate \nhandling of excavated materials and wastes. A design of river embankment protection may have \nmorphological  impacts.  Abstraction  from  deeper  aquifers,  if  proposed,  may  involve  risks  of \ndepletion  of  groundwater  resources  and  increased  arsenic  contamination.  Adequate  water \nsampling will be conducted to examine the reliability of the water quality. During implementation, \ndetailed  site-specific  environmental  and  social  impacts,  mitigation  measures,  and  monitoring \nplans will be assessed and developed for subprojects.   \n \n11. \nThe  rehabilitation  of  roads,  bridges,  railway,  and  river  embankment  will  be  within  the \nright-of-way and will not involve realignment or road widening. Therefore, land acquisition should \nnot  be  involved.  The  subproject  selection  criteria  also  exclude  subprojects  requiring  land \nacquisition  and  relocation.  Civil  works  may  cause  some  temporal  damage  to  crops  and \nagricultural land due to poor handling of solid and wastes. The resettlement framework has been \nprepared  to  ensure  that  if  resettlement  needs  are  identified  the  project  implementing  agency \nfollows  the  procedures  for  involuntary  resettlement  in  compliance  with  the  Government\u2019s \napplicable  laws  and  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995)  and \nHandbook on Resettlement (1998), and the agreed resettlement framework for the Project.  \n \nE. \n \n\nInstitutional Requirements, Environmental Mitigation, and Monitoring Plan \n\n1. \n\nInstitutional Requirements \n\n \nNational  procedures  for  environmental  assessment  in  Bangladesh  are  outlined  in  the \n12. \nEnvironmental  Conservation  Act  of  1995  and  the  Environmental  Conservation  Rules  of  1997. \nAccording  to  the  rules, projects  will  be  environmentally  classified  into  four  categories  based  on \nthe  magnitude  of  environmental  and  social  impacts.  Under  the  classification  system  of  the \nenvironmental  rules,  the  Project  is  most  likely  to  be  C.  Therefore,  Ministry  of  Environment  and \nForest\u2019s environmental clearance for each subproject is not needed unless a subproject will have \nenvironmental changes. In that case, an IEE will be prepared and submitted to the Department of \nEnvironment for clearance. \n \n13. \nTo implement the Project, the existing institutional arrangements established within each \nexecuting  agency  (EA)  will  be  utilized.  The  project  management  unit  (PMU)  and  project \nimplementation  units  (PIUs)  under  the  line  EAs,  will  be  responsible  for  carrying  out \nenvironmental  assessment,  environmental  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring,  preparation  of \nIEE and summary IEE if necessary, and reporting to ADB on the implementation of subprojects. \nThe PMUs and PIUs are expected to be facilitated by the environmental specialist of the design \nand  supervision  consultant  on  any  environmental  issues.  Detailed  institutional  responsibilities \n\n                                                 \n1  Roads include national, regional, district, rural, and feeder roads.   \n\n \n\n\f68\n\n \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nare  described \nProcedures. \n \n2. \n\nin  Supplementary  Appendix  F:  Environmental  Assessment  and  Review \n\nEnvironmental Monitoring Plan \n\nto  carry  out  environmental  assessment  and \n\nPublic Consultation and Information Disclosure \n\n \n14. \nA total of about $7.5 million or 3.1% of the project costs will be allocated to environmental \nmitigation  and  monitoring.  Recruitment  of  an  environmental  specialist  to  each  PMU  will  be \nincluded  in  the  budget,  as  appropriate,  to  assist  PMU  and  PIU  staff  in  strengthening  their \nimplement  mitigation  measures. \ncapacity \nEnvironmental mitigation measures and monitoring are described in Table A15.2. \n \n15. \nTo ensure effective implementation of the environmental mitigation measures, a reporting \nsystem is a prerequisite. During the construction phase, quarterly reporting of the implementation \nof the mitigation measures from the PIUs and PMUs to ADB will be adopted.  \n \nF. \n \n16. \nBecause of the urgent nature of the Project, conducting a detailed public consultation for \nwas not possible.  As part of the flood damage and needs assessment, extensive meetings and \ndiscussion with  government  officials,  nongovernment  organizations,  bilateral  organizations,  and \nacademics  were  conducted.  During  the  field  visit  conducted  from  12\u201321  September  2004, \ndiscussions with concerned EAs and interviews with affected villagers were also conducted.    \n \n17. \nDuring implementation, consultation will be conducted for each subproject to identify and \ntake  into  account  any  concerns  from  the  villagers  and  communities  on  the  design  and \nrehabilitation work. Necessary project information will be shared with the concerned villagers and \ncommunities. All documents on environmental issues including IEEs and progress reports will be \nproperly kept as part of the project document and made available to the public if required. \n \nG. \n \n18. \nThe  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedures  are  attached  as  Supplementary \nAppendix  F.  These  procedures  will  guide  the  environmental  screening  of  each  subproject  and \nfacilitate  institutional  arrangements  and  compliance  with  the  environmental  assessment \nrequirements  of  the  Government  and  ADB.  Rehabilitation  of  roads2,  railways,  and  river \nembankments  will  focus  on  a  specific  damaged  section  and  not  cover  an  extensive  length.  No \ndamaged  roads  located  in  the  national  park,  coastal  areas,  designated  protected  areas,  and \nbuffer zones are included in the priority list. Therefore, subprojects are unlikely to have significant \nadverse  environmental  impacts.  The  Project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B  and \nsubprojects  located  in  the  environmentally  sensitive  areas3  will  not  be  selected.  In  addition,  all \nsubprojects  must  comply  with  the  environmental  requirements  specified  in  ADB\u2019s  Environment \nPolicy  (2002)  and  Environment  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003)  and  those  governed  by  the \nrelevant environmental laws, regulations, and standards of the Government of Bangladesh \n \nTo ensure environmentally sustainable rehabilitation work, all subprojects will be subject \n19. \nto an environmental assessment screening to screen out subprojects located in environmentally \n                                                 \n2  Roads include national, regional, district, rural, and feeder roads.   \n3  Environmentally  sensitive  areas  are  generally  defined  as  those  requiring  special  management  attention  to  protect \nimportant  scenic  values,  fish  and  wildlife  resources,  historical  and  cultural  values,  and  other  natural  systems  or \nprocesses. Those areas include national forests, mangrove, wetland, steep slope areas, buffer zone, and areas that \ncover endangered species. \n\nEnvironmental Assessment and Review Procedures for Future Subprojects \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n69\n\nConclusion \n\nsensitive  areas,  assess  the  potential  negative  environmental  impacts,  and  determine  the  need \nfor  an  IEE.  Most  of  the subprojects are  expected  to  be  category  C  because  rehabilitation  work \nwill be confined to the right-of-way. If the screening indicates further analysis required4, an IEE \nwill be conducted to identify and implement environmental mitigation measures and monitoring, \nand IEE reports will be sent to ADB for its review.  \n \nH. \n \nThe  Project  mostly  involves  rehabilitation  of  the  existing  infrastructure.  Significant \n20. \nenvironmental  benefits  are  associated  with  the  Project,  such  as  limiting  soil  and  embankment \nerosion,  reducing  health  risks,  improving  the  flood  flow,  and  reducing  waterlogging.  Protecting \nthe  sediment  erosion  will  reduce  the  increase  in  suspended  solids  concentrations  within  water \nand could reduce any negative impact on aquatic ecology in the rivers and streams.   \n \n21. \nThe IEE illustrates that no significant adverse environmental impacts are associated with \nthe  proposed  rehabilitation  work.  The  proposed  generic  mitigation  measures  and  detailed  site-\nspecific  mitigation  measures  to  be  identified  during  implementation  are  likely  to  minimize \nnegative  environmental  impacts.  Environmental  assessment  and  review  procedure  will  provide \nadequate guidance to carry out the IEE and implement environmental mitigation measure as well \nas  monitoring \nthe \nGovernment and ADB. The need for a full scale environmental impact assessment is unlikely. \n\nthe  environmental  assessment  requirements  of \n\nin  accordance  with \n\n                                                 \n4  If  a  subprojects  requires  (i)  a  change  in  alignment  (for  roads,  canals,  dikes,  and  bridges)  for  safety  reasons;  (ii)  a \nlarge borrow  pit area;  or (iii)  a command area for irrigation that is  absolutely  necessary,  an IEE  will  be conducted \nand the IEE report will be sent to ADB for its review. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fConstruction \n\nAir quality  \n\u2022  Dust generation
