The study\nwas completed by the consultants 2/ in October 1981. Subsequent to a\nBank's Fact-Finding Mission in August 1982, an Appraisal Mission\nvisited Malaysia from 27 June to 8 July 1983, and firmed up the scope\nand the implementation arrangements for the Project in consultation\nwith the relevant authorities of the Government, PPC and other\nagencies concerned. Further processing of the proposed Bank loan was,\nhowever, withheld due to the Government investment priority review\nundertaken during the second half of 1983 and the Mid-Term Review of\nthe Fourth Malaysia Plan approved in early 1984. In view of the\nrecognized urgency of expanded port facilities at Penang, the\nGovernment suggested, in early June 1984, the Bank consider the\nproposed loan being made to PPC with the Government guarantee. A Bank\nFollow-Up Mission visited Penang and Kuala Lumpur, from 18 to 22 June\n1984, to review the Project cost estimates, the PPC's financial\nposition and the financing plan for the Project. Formal loan\nnegotiations for the proposed loan with authorized representatives of\nPPC (the Borrower) and Malaysia (the Guarantor) were held In Manila\nfrom 23 to 25 July 1984.

During the 1970s real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded\nby 7.8 per cent per annum supported by high rates of growth in\ndomestic savings and investment and accompanied by a high degree of\ndomestic price stability. This commendable growth performance was\nattributable to several factors including the country's rich natural\nresources, the Government's well-conceived growth strategy and prudent\nfinancial management, social and political stability, and a generally\nfavorable external environment. The population was estimated at 14.7\nmillion in 1983, and the per capita Gross National Product (GNP) of\nMalaysia stood at $1,840 1/ in 1982. During the decade, remarkable\nprogress was also made on the socio-economic front. The Government\nformulated a long-term New Economic Policy (NEP) in 1971, which called\nfor the eradication of poverty and reduction of ethnic imbalances in\nthe distribution of income, employment and asset ownership. The 1970s\nwitnessed substantial headway towards the attainment of the NEP\nobjectives. The growth of employment at 4.1 per cent per annum was\nfaster than that of the labor force, which increased at the rate of\n3.9 per cent per annum during the 1970s. In particular, employment in\nmanufacturing grew at an average annual rate of 8.5 per cent and\nconstituted 15.6 per cent of total employment in 1980 as against 9.0\nper cent in 1970. The overall incidence of poverty 2/ in Peninsular\nMalaysia was reduced from 49 per cent in 1970 to 29 per cent in 1980,\nbut increased slightly to 30.3 per cent in 1983.\n5. In contrast to the impressive performance in the 1970s, the\npace of the Malaysian economy slowed down in the 1980s. The slower\nrate of growth was associated with a deterioration in the financial\nresource position and rapidly enlarging fiscal deficits.\n2. Overall Growth Performance\n6. The growth rate of real GDP declined to 7.1 per cent in 1981\nand further to 5.6 per cent in 1982. In 1983 the growth rate improved\nslightly but remained relatively low at 5.8 per cent. The slowdown in\noverall economic growth during 1981-1983 was primarily due to a marked\ndecline in the growth of aggregate demand. The decline was associated\nif World Bank estimate using 1980-1982 as base period.\n2/ Proportion of persons with incomes below the poverty line in the\ntotal population. The poverty line W98 drawn by the Government at\nM$290 per household per month or M$55 per person per month for\n1980. Subsequently the Mid-Term Review of the Fourth Malaysia\nPlan (March, 1984) indicates that the poverty line has been\nadjusted annually by taking into account changes in the Consumer\nPrice Indices, but does not give an absolute poverty line income\nfigure for 1983.", "3\nwith contractionary monetary policy, a sharp reduction in the rate of\nGovernment expenditure initiated in mid-1982 and adverse external\ndevelopments resulting from world recession. A steep decline in\nexternal demand and in export prices for nearly all major exports\nof Malaysia resulted in a deceleration in the annual rate of growth of\nreal exports and non-factor services from 9.3 per cent during\n1976-1980 to about 6 per cent during 1981-1982. However, estimates\nfor 1983 indicate an upturn to 13 per cent as some revival of external\ndemand was registered. On the domestic front, a decline in the growth\nof disposable income resulted in annual growth of 4.5 per cent in real\nprivate consumption during 1982-1983. The slowdown in consumer demand\ncoupled with an uncertain business outlook resulted in a considerable\ndeceleration of the growth of real private investment to an annual\nrate of 5.8 per cent during 1982-1983 as against 17 per cent during\n1980-1981. The public sector, which was the major source of growth in\ndemand during 1980-1981 also contributed to the weakening of domestic\ndemand in the period 1982-1983. During 1980-1981 and the first half\nof 1982, the Government's fiscal operations were expansionary with a\nview to counteracting the impact of recession. In mid-1982, however,\nthe Government began to cut its expenditure. Accordingly, the growth\nof real public expenditure has decelerated since 1982 and has\nincreased by only 7.5 per cent per annum during 1982-1983 compared\nwith 21.5 per cent per annum during 1980-1981. In particular, real\npublic investment fell by 11 per cent in 1983.\n7. Sectorally, growth performance in most sectors improved in\n1983 with the exception of agriculture. Estimated real value-added in\nthe agriculture sector increased by only 0.5 per cent as against 7.4\nper cent in 1982, largely because of a fall in palm oil output. The\nestimated growth in the construction sector accelerated to 15.0 per\ncent from 9.5 per cent in 1982. In 1983 estimated value-added in the\nmanufacturing sector showed a rate of increase of 6.0 per cent from\n3.8 per cent in 1982 and in the services sector rose marginally to 7.0\nper cent. Estimated growth of the mining sector also accelerated\nsharply in 1983 to 16.2 per cent from 2.8 per cent in 1982 as crude\npetroleum production further increased and liquefied natural gas came\non stream. Tin production, however, showed a continued fall in 1983.\n3. Fiscal Operations\n8. The counter-cyclical thrust of fiscal operations resulted in\na rapid expansion of total expenditure of the Federal Government from\n40.4 per cent of GDP in 1980 to 47 per cent in 1981. Government\nrevenues also increased but at a slower rate mainly because of a fall\nin receipts from non-petroleum export taxes. Consequently, the\noverall fiscal deficit increased from an annual average level of 8 per\ncent of GDP to 13.6 per cent of GOP in 1980 and further to 16.0 per\ncent in 1981 and 19.5 per cent in 1982. The prolonged world recession\nresulted in a reduced rate of growth in tax revenues leading the\nGovernment in mid-1982 to initiate expenditure curtailment. in 1982\nthe nominal total Government expenditure, declined by 2.0 per cent\ncompared with an annual average increase of 37 per cent during\n1980-1981.", "4\nThe principal focus of the 1983 and 1984 budgets has been\nthe continued deceleration of the rate o. increase in total Government\nexpenditure. The persisting uncertainty in respect of the country's\nfinancial resource prospects led the Government to undertake a review\nin 1983 of the overall public investment program. Development\nexpenditure was cut by an estimated 8 per cent in 1983 and the 1984\nbudget provides for further cuts of 23 per cent. Local expenditure on\nseveral of the on-going projects (including those financed by external\nagencies) have been curtailed since mid-1983. In addition, to\naccelerate domestic resource mobilization, the 1983 and 1984 budgets\ncontained a number of tax-enhancing measures such as doubling of\nsales tax on most non-essential products and increasing import duties\non a wide range of goods. In addition, the 1984 budget provided for\ntax exemption of interest earned by individuals on Government\nsecurities to widen the investment base of these securities. Despite\nthese measures and severe restraints on expenditure, the fiscal\ndeficit was estimated at the relatively high level of 14.5 per cent of\nGDP in 1983 and is forecast at 10 per cent of GDP in 1984.\n10. Prior to these adjustments, the Government increased the\nlevel of its borrowing rapidly to finance the fiscal deficits. In the\npast, the Government financed fiscal deficits mainly through domestic\nsources such as the Employees' Provident Fund. From 1981 however the\nGovernment increasingly resorted to external borrowings to meet its\ndeficit. External borrowings reached an estimated M$5.2 billion in\nl83 compared with an annual average of M$0.5 billion during\n1976-1980. From an average of 20 per cent of total Government\nborrowing in 1976-1980, external borrowing rose to an average of 47\nper cent in 1981-1983. Commercial loans have been the principal\ncomponent of the growth in external borrowing and constituted 88 per\ncent of such borrowing in 1981-1983.\n4. Money and Prices\n11. in 1981-1983 monetary and credit operations were less\nexpansionary than in the previous years mainly due to a slow growth in\ndemand for bank credits from the private sector and a decline in net\nforeign assets reflecting the weakening of the balance-of-payments\nposition. The rate of monetary expansion decelerated from an annual\naverage of 18 per cent during 1976-1980 to about 9 per cent during\n198 1-1983.\n12. Following a long period of price stability, the economy\nexperienced inflationary pressure in 1981. The annual rate of\ndomestic inflation as measured by the consumer price index rose from\nan average of 4.5 per cent during 1976-1980 to 9.7 per cent in 1981.\nThe main contributing factors to the acceleration of inflation were\nsharp increases in import prices and sustained growth in domestic\ndemand associated with increased rate of investment and rapid", "5\nexpansion of liquidity in the preceding years. The inflation rate,\nhowever, decelerated to 5.8 per cent in 1982 and further to 4.0 per\ncent in 1983. This favorable trend was partly due to the decline in\nthe rate of monetary expansion and partly due to a slowdown in the\nrate of growth of import prices, Itself attributable to some extent to\na minor appreciation of the rInggit against most trading currencies\nother than the U.S. dollar.\n5. Balance of Payments\n13. Malaysia's balance of payments, which had remained favorable\nfor over a decade till 1980, deteriorated rapidly in 1981 and 1982.\nTotal commodity export earnings declined by about 3.5 per cent per\nannum during 1981-1982 in contrast to a 25 per cent annual increase\nduring 1976-1980. Import payments, however, increased by 9.1 per cent\nper annum during 1981-1982 mainly because of an increase In import\nprices. Consequently, the merchandise trade balance showed a deficit\nin 1981 for the first time In more than two decades. The deficit\nreached US$0.7 billion in 1982. The deterioration In the trade\naccount resulted in the current account deficit widening to US$2.3\nbillion in 1981 and further to US$3.4 billion in 1982 (12.4 per cent\nof GDP). The current account deficits were met by capital Inflows\nwhich Increased from US$1.4 billion in 1980 to US$3.7 billion in 1982.\nAfter taking Into account net errors and omissions, the overall\nbalance of payments registered a deficit of US$0.5 billion in 1981 and\nUS$0.3 billion in 1982.\n14. In 1983 Malaysia's balance-of-payments situation showed\nimprovement. The merchandise trade balance moved Into surplus as a\nresult of a sharp upturn in the growth of exports following favorable\ntrends in external price and volume for most commodities and a\ndeceleration in the rate of growth of Imports. The current account\ndeficit declined to US$2.8 billion (10 per cent of GDP) and\npreliminary estimates indicate a small overall balance-of-payments\ndeficit in 1983. At the end of 1983 the country's international\nreserves stood at US$3.9 billion. Despite strong Improvement expected\nin the merchandise trade balance, a deficit on the current account of\nabout Us$2.0 billion is expected in 1984 as continued widening of the\ndeficit in the flow of investment income Is forecast.\n6. External Borrowing and Debts\n15. Prior to 1981 Malaysia's external borrowings remained\nmodest. Since 1981, however, external borrowings, notably borrowings\nfrom the International capital market, Increased markedly reflecting\nthe country's need to finance a widening resource gap. in 1981\nMalaysia secured project loans totalling US$0.34 billion from\nmultilateral financial institutions, including the Bank, and various\nbilateral sources. In addition, Malaysia also raised market loans\ntotalling US$1.2 billion. In 1982 the country's project loans from\nbilateral and multilateral sources amounted to US$0.3 billion and its", "borrowings from the international capital market totalled US$1.8\nbillion. At the end of 1982 (the latest year for which data are\navailable), total external public debt outstanding (disbursed only\namounted to US$7.7 billion. Of the disbursed debt of the Federal\nGovernment in 1982, 72 per cent was market loans, 15 per cent from\nmultilateral agencies and 13 per cent from bilateral sources. The\ncountry borrowed about US$2.2 billion in 1983.\n16. Total debt-service payments (external and domestic), which\nrose sharply during 1982-1983, have been forecast to be 25 per cent of\nGovernment operating expenditure in 1984. Although the external\ndebt-service ratio was estimated at only 6.0 per cent in 1983 -- up\nfrom 2.5 per cent in 1980 -- the ratio is expected to move to 8 to 10\nper cent in 1984 and 1985 as a result of the large-scale commercial\ncredits contracted in recent years. The Government has expressed\nconcern at the prospective bunching of external debt repayments in the\nlatter half of the 1980g.\n7. Development Strategy and Prospect\n17. Malaysia's long-term development strategy and objectives are\nset forth in the NEP and in the Outline Perspective Plan (0PP)\ncovering the period 1971-1990. The main objective proclaimed in the\nNEP is consolidation of national unity. Towards this goal, the NEP\nseeks: (i) to eradicate poverty; and (ii) to reduce imbalance among\nthe ethnic groups in terms of income, employment and ownership of\nassets. These objectives are sought to be achieved through rapid\neconomic expansion with price stability. The Fourth Malaysia Plan\n(1981-1985), which represents the third five-year plan formulated\nwithin the NEP and OPP framework, was launched in March 1981. The\nFourth Plan targets for 1981-]985 include annual expansion of real CDP\nby 7.6 per cent, real gross domestic investment by 5.6 per cent and\nemployment by 3.2 per cent. Malaysia's development plans do not\nexplicitly indicate an order of sectoral development priorities. In\nterms of relative magnitudes of public investment allocations, the\nimplicit order of priority in the Fourth Plan is agricultural and\nrural development, accounting for 19.5 per cent of the total original\ndevelopment budget allocations, followed by transport and\ncommunications (13.2 per cent), commerce and industry (12.7 per cent),\nhousing, health, sanitation and community development and services\n(7.6 per cent), energy and public utilities (7.5 per cent) and\neducation (7.0 per cent). The remaining planned expenditure is mainly\nfor non-economic sectors such as security and administration. !/\n18. The prospects of a relatively high rate of economic growth\nappear less favorable in the medium term. While Malaysia's natural\nresources endowment and its past economic performance augur well for\n1/ Percentages refer to total public development expenditure which\nincludes allocation for State Funds (3.2 per cent) and Statutory\nFunds (5.0 per cent) not broken down by sector.", "7\nthe country's economic progress in the longer term, the economy has\nbeen experiencing a slowdown in overall growth in the shorter term\nmainly because of the slow world economic recovery and substantial\ncuts in public investment. The official forecast of economic growth\nfor 1984 is 6.7 per cent, still below the target set for the Fourth\nMalaysia Plan.\n19. The Mid-Term Review of the Fourth Malaysia Plan was\npresented in March 1984. The Review highlighted the less favorable\neconomic climate and performance, 1981 to 1983, than anticipated under\nthe Fourth Malaysia Plan. The annual expansion of real CDP and of\nemployment over the Plan period has been revised downward to 6.4 per\ncent and 3.0 per cent, respectively. An unemployment rate of 6.2 per\ncent in 1985 has been forecast in the Review as compared with a\nforecast of 4.9 per cent in that year under the Fourth Malaysia Plan.\nNotwithstanding good progress made in the past, the problems of\npoverty and imbalance in income distribution continue to persist in\nMalaysia. The incidence of poverty is still high (30 per cent in 1983\nin Peninsular Malaysia); the poor are mainly in the rural areas (86\nper cent in 1983) where the majority of Bumiputras !/ reside. An\noverall incidence of poverty of 24 per cent in 1985 in Peninsular\nMalaysia Is forecast in the Review. Total public development\nexpenditure has been revised to M$59.7 billion in the Review from\nM$42.8 billion under the original Fourth Malaysia Plan with\nexpenditure in the years 1981 to 1983 estimated at M$40.4 billion.\nRevised sectoral. allocations in the Review for the Plan period have\nbeen made as follows: agricultural and rural development (13.4 per\ncent), transport and communications (16.3 per cent), commerce and\nindustry (11.8 per cent), housing, health, sanitation and community\ndevelopment and services (10.9 per cent), energy and public  utilities\n(8.0 per cent) and education (7.7 per cent).\n20. The Fourth Plan aims at moving toward the eradication of\npoverty and restructuring of the economy through rapid growth of\nnon-agricultural sectors, in particular manufacturing. However,\nachievement of rapid industrialization simultaneously with other NEP\nobjectives would call for broadening and diversification of industrial\nactivities based on improved skills and technology. This will require\nincreasing investments which, In turn, would call for favorable\npolicies and an investment climate -- domestic and external --\nconducive to private investment as well as availability of Indigenous\nhuman resources. While the first requirement calls for early\nformulation of an integrated national industrial policy, the latter\nunderlines the need for the preparation and implementation of\nappropriate manpower programs. These objectives have been given\nrenewed and strengthened emphasis within the Mid-Term Review.\n1/ Literally means \"sons of the soil\" and refers to Malays and other\nindigenous people.", "8\n21. The emphasis on rapid industrial growth does not minimize\nthe importance of agriculture in the economy and its role in the\nachievement of the NEP objectives. However, the agriculture sector  Ic\nexperiencing difficulties resulting from the changing demographic\nsituation wherein there is a movement of the young and educated away\nfrom the rural sector, coinciding with absolute labor shortages. The\nGovernment has recognized that unless sustained efforts are made to\nsolve the problems facing agriculture, the NEP objectives may not be\nfull.y achieved. Accordingly, it announced in January 1984 a National\nAgricultural Policy focused upon action to redress deterioration of\nthe agricultural resource base of the economy, and promoting increased\nsector productivity and enhanced farm incomes. These objectives have\nbeen incorporated within the Mid-Term Review.\n22. While the Fourth Plan places increased emphasis on the role\nof the private sector, public investment is expected to continue to\nplay an important role in the development of physical and social\ninfrastructure as well as in the implementation of programs aimed at\nreducing poverty. The Mid-Term Review has, however, emphasized the\nneed to privatize selected Government services and interests to\naccelerate the pace of restructuring and to accommodate a more\nrestrictive public investment climate. Nevertheless, the public\nsector will be constrained by its limited capacity to formulate and\nimplement investment programs and projects. Continued assistance to\nMalaysia from multilateral financial institutions would be required as\nsuch assistance would strengthen the public sector's implementation\ncapacity, besides helping the country to overcome its increasing\nresource constraint.\nB. The Port Sector\n23. The provision of an efficient and balanced transport system\nis an integral part of the Malaysia's development process. During the\npast decade, the expansion and modernization of port facilities has\nmade a significant contribution towards greater inter and\nintra regional movement. During the Fourth Plan period (1981-1985),\nvarious modes of transport and related infrastructure are planned to\nbe further expanded and improved to accelerate the soclo-economic\ndevelopment of the country. In this context, ports will be developed\nto enable them to cope with growing traffic and other related maritime\nactivities.\n24. The Economic Planning Unit (EPU) of the Prime Minister's\nDepartment through its Transport Section is responsible for the\nformulation of macro-economic plans and for the overall sectoral\nplanning of the transport sector in collaboration with the ministries\nand departments concerned. The Ministry of Transport is responsible\nfor the formulation, evaluation and implementation of transport\npolicies, and for development programs and projects.", "9\n25. in 1982, a total of 17.4 million tons of cargo was handled\nby the Peninsular Malayia ports in comparison with 7.9 million tons\nIn 1970, representing an average annual increase in port traffic of\n6.8 per cent during the period; this growth rate is expected by the\nGovernment to increase further, at an average annual rate of 9.5 per\ncent or to 25.5 million tons by 1985. The port system of Peninsular\nMalaysia has been dominated by two international deepwater ports viz.,\nthe ports of Kelang and Penang. lii 1982, about 82 per cent of the\ntotal volume of the international trade of the Peninsular was handled\nthrough these two ports, with the balance handled mainly through\nJohore Port. While the share of total traffic of Penang Port has\nincreased from 35 per cent in 1976 to about 39 per cent in 1982, that\nof Port Kelang declined from about 60 per cent to 43 per cent during\nthe same period. During the period 1970-1980, Port Kelang's annual\ncargo handling capacity was expanded from about 4.4 million tons in\n1970 to 8.0 million tons in 1980. By the end of FMP 1985 the capacity\nof Port Kelang, Including the expansion program for Pulau Lumut, is\nexpected to be increased to about 14 million tons. The cargo handling\ncapacity of Penang Port was increased from some 2.0 million tons in\n1970 to 5.5 million tons by 1981. Under FMP, the capacity is planned\nto be Increased to about 9.0 million tons with the implementation of\nthe proposed North Butterworth container terminal project and the\nconstruction of an additional berth for the existing bulk cargo\nterminal. The expansion program for Johore Port, which aims to\nincrease its capacity from 3.5 million tons in 1980 to about 7.5\nmillion tons by 1985, includes the construction of an additional\nmulti-purpose berth, two berths for dry bulk cargo and a dangerous\ncargo jetty. Kuantan Port, located on the east coast of Peninsular\nMalaysia, has been developed with Bank assistance. 1/ There are two\nsmaller ports, at Kemasin and Kemaman, on the east coast of Peninsular\nMalaysia.\n26. The total capacity planned to be developed for the entire\nPeninsular Malaysia ports system during the FM? period (1981-1985) is\nabout 30 million tons, which will be barely adequate for the period up\nto 1990, assuming same growth In traffic as observed during the 1970s.\n27. The Bank has so far provided two loans for the development\nof the Port of Penang -- the Penang Port Expansion Project (Loan No.\n184-MAL, approved in April 1984) and the Second Penang Port Expansion\n(Loan No. 296-MAL, approved in March 1977). The first project\nprovided for the construction of a general cargo wharf, a transmit\nshed at the Butterworth Wharves (Berth No. 6), and a bulk cargo\nterminal at Prai. The second project involved the conversion of Berth\nNo. 6 to a container cum roll on-roll off berth and the construction\nof a vegetable oil berth. It also provided for consultant services to\n1/ Loan No. 147-MAL, $30.4 million, for the Kuantan Port Project,\napproved in November 1973.", "10\nprepare a feasibility study for the Phase 111 development of the port\nand a tariff study.

The Bank has been the major source of external assistance to\nthe port sector in Malaysia, having extended since 1969 six loans\ntotalling US$117.8 million for the Kuching Port, the Sibu Port, the\nKuantan Port, the Biritulu Deepwater Port 3/ and two loans for the\nPenang Port. The World Bank provided two loans in 1981 and 1978\ntotalling US$29.1 million for the development of ports in the State of\nSabah. Japan has so far provided four loans totalling US$61.5 million\nequivalent for the development of Johor Port and Kelang Port, and\nco-financed with the Bank in an amount of US$30.5 million equivalent\nfor the Bintulu Deepwater Port Project. The Federal Republic of\nGermany provided US$8.5 million in 1976 equivalent for the\nconstruction of the Butterworth deepwater wharves, and US$6.5 million\nin 1970 for the expansion of Port Kelang. Other major bilateral\nfinanciers include USA which provided in 1959 US$10.0 million for the\nNorth Kelang Port Project; the Islamic Development Bank which\nco-financed with the Bank in 1981 for the Bintulu Deepwater Project at\nUS48..9 million; Denmark, which financed in 1971 and 1972 the\npreparation of a feasibility study and design, and the cost of\nsupervising the construction of the Johor Port development at US$0.6\nmillion; and the Netherlands which provided US$0.7 million for the\ndevelopment of a fishing port in Kuantan.

BANK OPERATiONS iN MALAYSIA\nA. Past Operations\n29. Bank operations in Malaysia started in 1968. By 31 July 1984\nthe Bank had approved 51 loans totalling US$885.128 million for 50\nprojects. Of these loans, 50, amounting to US$881.828 million, were\nfrom its ordinary capital resources, and one loan, of US$3.3 million,\nwas from Special Funds resources. In addition, technical assistance\namounting to US$3.292 million was provided for 18 projects, of which\nsix have resulted in Bank loans amounting to US$145.3 million.\nCo-financing in an amount of US$279.61 million with bilateral,\nmultilateral and commercial sources has so far been arranged for seven\nprojects.\n30. Bank lending to Malaysia has expanded from an average level\nof about $50 million annually in the mid-1970s to $92.58 million in\n1982. Lending in 1983 declined to $82.51 million, however, due to a\nGovernment review of investment priorities and external borrowings\nundertaken during that year. The sectoral distribution of cumulative\nBank lending to Malaysia is shown below.\nSectoral Distribution of Bank Loans\n(As of 30 June 1984)\nNo. of\t Total Lending\nSector\t Loans\t (US$ Million)\t Percentage\nAgriculture & Agro-lndustry 14 243.38 27.6\nEnergy 8 153. 298 17.3\nHealth & Population 1 25.80 2.9\nDevelopment Banks 1 15.0 1.6\nTransport & Communications 14 209.34 23.7\nWater Supply 9 114.11 12.9\nUrban Development 2 46.20 5.2\nEducation 2 78.00 8.8\n\t \t \t\nTotal 51 885.128 100.0\n31. During the period 1968-1979 Bank operations focused largely\non lending for physical infrastructure projects located in the\nleast-developed regions of the country--about 72.5 per cent of total\nlending went to such projects. The projects assisted included six in\nthe ports sector (see paras 27 and 28). With the advent of the New\nEconomic Policy and the Third Malaysian Plan (1976-1980) the Malaysian", "12\neconomy continued to achieve rapid growth with price stability and\nimprovement in the external payments poBitiofl. It became evident that\nthe Bank's developmental role in Malaysia would be further enhanced by\nassisting the Government more directly through programs and projects\ndesigned to eradicate poverty. A gradual shift in the Bank's\noperations began in 1979, with more emphasis on projects in the\nagriculture and social sectors; this shift In emphasis is reflected in\nthe Bank's lending over the three-year period 1980-1983, which\nincluded, among other things, seven projects in the agriculture and\nrural development sector and four in the social sector. As regards\nthe regional distribution of Bank assistance, about 74.8 per cent of\nthe total assistance has been provided to Peninsular Malaysia, where\nabout 83 per cent of country's total population lives; the rest has\ngone to Sabah and Sarawak, which have about 17 per cent of the total\npopulation.\n32. Of the 18 Bank-financed technical assistance projects in\nMalaysia, totalling US$3.292 million, 14 projects have been for\nproject\t preparation\t and\t four\t for\t advisory\t services\t and\ninstitution-building. Agriculture and rural development (US$1.35\nmillion) accounts for 41.07 per cent of the Bank's technical\nassistance activities in Malaysia, followed by energy (US$798,000;\n2.24 per cent), urban development (US$550,000; 16.71 per cent), water\nsupply (US$300,000; 9.11 per cent), and transport and communications\n(Us$292,000; 8.87 per cent).\n33. Of the 50 projects assisted by the Bank loans, 29 have been\ncompleted and the loans closed. The Bank has so far approved one\nsupplementary loan for a road project. Cost overruns in some other\nprojects have been borne by the Government. Disbursement as of 31\nMay 1984 amounted to US$441.624 million, or about 55.81 per cent of\nthe total available for withdrawal. The Bank generally has not\nencountered problems in Malaysia regarding adherence to loan\ncovenants, and progress in implementation of the majority of\nBank-financed projects in Malaysia has been satisfactory. However, in\nthe cases of a few projects there have been delays in project start-up\nand completion because of initial delays in procurement of equipment,\nrecruitment of consultants, and prequalification of contractors. The\nreasons for the delays in these cases have been discussed with the\n(overnment, which has since taken steps to minimize delay.\nF. Operational Strategy\n34. Within the framework of Malaysia's development priorities,\nthe lending program is guided by the Bank's strategic approach to\ncountry programming. This approach is necessarily long-term and\nevolutionary in nature and the Bank's lending portfolio in the coming\nyears will increasingly reflect three strategic objectives: support\nfor structural change, efficient resource use, and institutional\ndevelopment. In this context two areas which are of prime importance\nare poverty eradication and energy development.", "13\n5. Despite high per-capita income, widespread poverty and\nsocial imbalance are prevalent in 11alaysia and countering this\nsituation is the main thrust of the development programs of the\nGovernment; the Bank's operational strategy supports this development\nthrust. The Bank has adopted a multipronged approach to meet this\nchallenge, through assistance to the agriculture sector (where the\nincidence of poverty is as high as 42 per Cent), manpower development,\nand the provision of social intrastructure facilities. In the\nagriculture sector the National Agricultural Policy aims at improving\nthe contribution of the sector to the national economy through\nqualitative and quantitative change In farm productivity and income\npattern of farm holders through emphasizing activities with greater\nreturns to labor, selective cropping patterns, tood crop development\nand land utilization measures. Special attention will be paid to the\ndevelopment of sector institutions. Bank lending over the next few\nyears will broadly support this thrust, and the sector will continue\nto remain in sharp focus in the Bank's strategy. Manpower development\nprograms will play a supplemental role in poverty alleviation by\nfacilitating increased absorption of skilled labor in non-agricultural\nactivities through rehabilitation and expansion ot technical and\nvocational educational institutions. The Bank's assistance to the\nsocial infrastructure subsector will aim at providing basic needs of\nthe poor through projects for urban and rural development, rural\nwater supply and health facilities.\n36. The energy sector is another focus ot the Bank's strategy.\nExploitation of the country's considerable natural gas reserves tor\ndomestic consumption and tor export, the development of hydroelectric\npower, and a broader diversification ot energy sources remain the\nhighest priorities of the Government. The Bank's involvement in this\nsector will continue through selective concentration on the\ndevelopment of hydropower through assistance to a major hydropower\nproject each year. In addition, support will be provided to develop\nthe coordinating capabilities of relevant planning institutions to\nenable them to work out the capital investment requirements of the\nenergy sector. The Bank program in Malaysia also includes continuance\nof assistance for development of stratcgic sea ports for facilitating\nexports.\n37. Another area assuming increa'ing importance for the Bank's\nfuture lending will be assistance to the perceptibly growing private\nsector which will partly replace the public sector. Though still at a\nconceptual stage, the program is likely to assume concrete shape after\nthe current exercise of identifying areas of privatization and framing\nguidelines is over. The Bank's response to the private sector could\nbe in the form of equity participation and/or financing ot private\nindustries, either directly or through DFIs; this may call for a\ngradual shift in the strategic thrust of Bank lending.", "14\nIII. THE PROJECT\n38. A report entitled \"Appraisal of the Third Penang Port\nExpansion Project in Malaysia\" (Report No. MAL:A-48)is circulated\nherewith.\nA. Objective and Scope\n39. The proposed Project represents the Bank's third phase\nassistance for the expansion program of the Penang Port. The main\nobjective of the Project is to enable the port to handle its rapidly\nincreasing container traffic satisfactorily and to provide additional\nconventional cargo handling capacity. The Project will provide the\nport with a container handling capacity of about 250,000 TEUs 1/ per\nyear through the construction of a new container terminal at North\nButterworth -- the North Butterworth Container Terminal (NBCT) -- on\nthe west coast of Peninsular Malaysia, capable of accommodating either\none third (2,500-3,000 TEU capacity) and one second (1,500 TEU)\ngeneration container vessels or three first (700-800 TEll) generation\nvessels. The terminal will be provided with cargo/container handling\nequipment and modern port facilities adequate to handle the forecast\nlevel of export and import cargoes up to the year 1997-1998. The\nproposed Project consists of the following main components:\n(1) reclamation of about 41.6 ha of land area for a\ncontainer marshalling yard, two container freight\nstations and ancillary areas;\n(ii) construction of a 530 m long and 60 m wide wharf on\npiles, including a mooring dolphin, and a 520 m long\nand 19 m wide access bridge connecting the wharf with\nthe reclaimed back-up area along the shore;\n(iii) paving of the port area, construction of port\nbuildings, including container freight stations,\nadministration buildings, maintenance and civil\nengineering workshops, gate houses, training\nfacilities, an internal roads system, amenities and\nancillary facilities, and the installation of neces-\nsary utilities;\n(iv) provision of container/cargo handling equipment, such\nas gantry cranes, transtainer cranes, front-end\nloaders, prime movers, trailers, forklifts, mobile\nworkshops and mini-buses with all necessary spare\nparts;\n!/ Twenty Foot Equivalent Unit: Standard unit for the measurement of\ncontainer traffic.", "15\nCv) provision of a 3,000 HP tug boat equipped with\nfire-fighting facilities for berthing and unberthing\nships;\n(vi) acquisition of land and water areas;\n(vii) provision of consultant services for detailed\nengineering designs and construction supervision; and\n(viii) provision of a training program.\n40. The layout plan for the container terminal, as proposed\nunder the Bank-financed Phase Ill feasibility study, comprised the\nconstruction of a new container terminal with a 530 m wharf alongside\nwater depth of 13 m below Admiralty Chart Datum 1/, and a back-up area\nof about 24 ha immediately behind the wharf. The proposed scope,\nhowever, required costly reclamation in deepwater and soil replacement\nworks for foundation settlement. As the least cost solution, a\nrevised layout for the construction of an island type wharf connected\nby an access bridge with back-up area facilities located on the sea\nshore has been agreed to between the Government, the Bank and the\nPenang Port Commission (PPC); the revised layout comprises the scope\nof the proposed Project.\n41. To connect the Project container terminal with the country's\nroad network, a road section of about 100 m will be required to\nconnect the Project internal road system with Federal Route No. 1.\nThe Government has undertaken to have this section constructed by\n30 June 1987. For further improvement of the traffic flow between the\nterminal and the hinterland, the Government has also agreed to give\npriority to a section between Federal Route No. 1 and the North-South\nExpressway during the construction of the planned Southern Approach of\nthe East-West Highway. The Malayan Railway plans to connect the\ncontainer terminal with the national railway network. For that\npurpose, the Malayan Railways intends to commission a study to\ndetermine the most suitable and viable option for the construction of\nthe proposed link. It was agreed that this study will also include\nthe assessment of economic viability. The Project layout includes the\nprovision of land space for such a railway connection which, however,\nwill only be constructed if its economic viability can be clearly\ndemonstrated.\n42. The total Project site covers an area of 45.8 ha, of which\n41.b ha will be obtained by reclamation of land in the shallow water\narea. PPC will acquire all land and water areas and rights of land\nreclamation over the seabed from the Land Department of Penang State,\nby 30 June 1985.\n1/ Admiralty Chart Datum: standard reference level for water depth.", "\t\n16\n'3. in December 1983 PPC, from its own resources, in\nconsultation with the Bank, engaged the services of the Jurutera\nKonsultant Sdn. Bhd. (Malaysia) in association with the Central\nConsultant, Inc. (Japan), to prepare the detailed engineering plans\nfor, and to supervise construction of, the Project facilities.\n4. Consultant services, of about 22 man-months, will be\nprovided for the training component under the proposed Project. The\nconsultants will identify the training needs; develop various training\nprograms, including the operation, maintenance and repair of equipment\nand the management of the container terminal; and will conduct such\ntraining programs. They will also assist PPC in the procurement of\nthe container/cargo handling equipment to be provided under the\nProlect.\t The overseas training will be provided by the suppliers of\nthe equipment.\nB. Cost Estimates and Financing Arrangements\ne5. \nThe total cost of the proposed Project is estimated at\nUS$174.0 million, of which US$114.0 million, or 65.5 per cent, is the\nforeign exchange cost, including US$12.0 million of interest and other\ncharges during construction (bc); the local currency cost is US$60.0\nmillion. These estimates are based on prices prevailing at mid 1984\nand\t include appropriate provision\t for physical and price\ncontingencies.\nThe Saudi Fund for Development (SFD) in April 1983 agreed in\nprinciple to provide a loan of US$30.0 million equivalent to the\nGovernment of Malaysia to finance a part of the estimated foreign\nexchange cost of civil works for the wharf and bridge. 1/ PPC has\ngiven an assurance that the foreign exchange cost of the\ncontainer/cargo handling equipment, amounting to US$30.0 million, will\nbe met through co-financing arrangements with external commercial\nsources to be secured not later than the end of 1985.\n7. It is proposed that the Bank provide to PPC a loan of\nUS$L 5.8 million, from its ordinary capital resources, on the\nGovernment guaranteeing the obligations of PPC in respect of such a\nloan. The proposed Bank loan represents about 26.3 per cent of the\ntotal cost of the Project, and would finance the remaining foreign\nexchange cost of US$38.8 million, including US$7.0 million as IDC on\nthe proposed Bank loan. The proposed loan will have a term of 20\nyears, including a grace period of 4 years, with interest at the rate\nof 10.25 per cent per annum. These terms are considered appropriate\ntaking Into account the nature, the implementation period and the\neconomic life of the Project. PPC will finance from its own resources\nlOG of US$2.0 million on the SFD loan, IDC of US$3.0 million on\n1/ The terms of SFD loan are 25 years including a grace period of 4\nyears with service charge at the rate of 4 per cent per annum.", "17\nthe loan from commercial sources, and the local currency cost of\nUS$fl.O million. PPC will also finance on a timely basis from its\nown or other resources the residual foreign exchange cost in the\namount of US$3.0 million pertaining to the wharf and bridge, and not\ncovered by the SF1) loan. As stated in para 44, PPC has financed from\nits own resources the total cost of consultant services of US$3.4\nmillion, including US$0.2 million in foreign exchange, to prepare\ndetailed engineering plans for, and to supervise construction of the\nProject. The Government in consideration of the Bank's entering the\nLoan Agreement with PPC, has agreed so to guarantee such obligations\nof PPC. There will be no guarantee fee payable by PPC to the\nGovernment for guaranteeing the Bank loan. With regard to the\nproposed co-financing from external commercial banking sources, the\nBank's assistance in the canvassing of appropriate offers and\nevaluation of proposals submitted by interested sources has been\nrequested by PPC.\nC. Project Organization and Implementation\n1. Executing Agency\n48. As in the case of the previous two Bank loans for the\nexpansion of Penang Port, the Penang Port Commission (PPC) will act as\nthe Executing Agency for the proposed Project and will assume overall\nresponsibility for its coordination and implementation. PPC was\nestablished in 1955 as a statutory body with administrative and fiscal\nautonomy, subject to a certain control by the Minister of Transport.\nPPC's financial performance on the whole has been satisfactory and its\nfinancial management is considered effective. PPC has executed the\ntwo previous two Bank-financed Projects satisfactorily.\n49. For the purpose of executing the Project, PPC will, by the\nend of 1987, establish a Project Office to be Ieaded by Its Assistant\nGeneral Manager of Operations, who will be assisted by a full time\nProject Manager acceptable to the Bank, and will be supported by an\nadequate number of full-time technical and administrative personnel.\nThe Project Office will be responsible for the day-to-day execution of\nthe Project, including the procurement of goods and services, the\nselection of consultants, reporting and accounting, the coordination\nof the training programs, and the review and monitoring of the\nprogress of the Project. For the efficient operation of the Project\ncontainer terminal, PPC will establish a separate NBCT Operation Unit\nnot later than 30 June 1987. PPC will, by 31 March 1987, forward to\nthe Bank for review and comment its proposal on the detailed organiza-\ntional plan and the unit. PPC will continue to consult with the Bank\nregarding the proper operation and staffing of the Project facilities.\n2. Procurement of Goods and Services\n50. Procurement of goods and services to be financed from the\nproceeds of the Bank loan will be under international competitive\nbidding or international shopping, where appropriate, in accordance", "18\nwith the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. Bidders for civil works\nfinanced under the Bank loan will be prequalif led. Procurement of\ngoods and services financed by SFD will be in accordance with SFD's\nprocurement procedures, and administered separately by SFD in\naccordance with SFD guidelines. However, the technical\nspecifications, draft tender documents and list of prequalified\ncontractors/suppliers for the wharf and bridges, to be financed by\nSF1), and those for the container/cargo handling equipment, to be\nfinanced by commercial sources, will be submitted for the Bank's\nreview and comment before PPC approval is given. The consultants for\nthe proposed training program will be engaged in accordance with the\nBank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\n3. lmplementation Schedule\n51. It is anticipated that the proposed Project will be\nimplemented over a four-year period, commencing September 1984. The\nfollowing represent the main implementation events: preparation of\nthe detailed engineering design-tender documents and the\nprequalification of contractors will be finalized by April 1986; the\ndredging and reclamation works are scheduled to start by July 1985,\nand to be completed in early 1987; and civil works for the wharf and\nbridge, port buildings, marshalling yard and utilities will start by\nMay 1986, October 1986, and February 1987, respectively, and are\nscheduled for completion by mid 1988; procurement of the\ncontainer/cargo handling equipment and tug boat will be carried out\nfrom mid-1986 to early-1988; and the Project container terminal is\nanticipated to be operational in the second half of 1988.\n4. Accounts and Audit\n52. PPC will establish and maintain separate accounts for the\nproject. These accounts and financial statements will be audited\nannually by auditors acceptable to the Bank, and duly audited accounts\nand PPC's financial statements will be furnished to the Bank not later\nthan nine months after the close of the related financial year.\n5. Project Benefit Monitoring\n53. PPC will compile the base-line data and minimum data\nrequirement in order to monitor the actual benefits of the Project.\nSuch data include the volume of conventional and containerized cargo\ntraffic; the size, type and number of vessels; berth occupancy; the\nrate of cargo handling equipment downtime; and a comparison of various\nshipping costs.\t PPC will submit Project benefit and monitoring\nreports to the Bank for review and comment quarterly for the first two\nyears of operations and thereafter annually. The PPC's statistical\nreporting system, which Is comprehensive and satisfactory, will\nprovide a sound basis for monitoring, project performance and\noperational improvement as well as for the planning of future\nprojects.", "19\nD. Justification, Benefits and Risks\n54. The proposed Project provides an essential link in the\ndevelopment efforts of the Government. International trade, which\naccounts for nearly 50 per cent of the country's GDP, requires the\ntimely expansion of the cargo handling capacity of the port system in\nPeninsular Malaysia.\n55. The proposed Project will enable Penang Port to handle the\nrapidly increasing container traffic satisfactorily. The port traffic\ntrend grew at an average rate of 7.4 per cent per annum during\n1976-1983, and is forecast to continue growing at an annual rate of\n4.4 per cent until 1989 and 4.2 per cent thereafter. The total\ncontainer traffic to be handled at Penang Port is forecast to increase\nfrom about 86,000 TEUs in 1983 to 146,000 TElls in 1989 and about\n250,000 TEUs in 1997-1998, representing an average annual growth rate\nof 9.1 per cent for 1983-1989 and 65 per cent for 1989-1999. The\nrapidly Increasing port traffic and the high penetration of\ncontainerization have resulted in full utilization of port facilities,\nand led to congestion, especially at the container and conventional\nberths. All container traffic at the Port will be transferred to the\nnew and separate Project container handling facilities on their\ncompletion. The Project container terminal, with a handling capacity\nof about 250,000 TEUs per year, Is expected to meet the container\ntraffic requirements up to 1997-1998, while the existing facilities\nwill handle the conventional general cargoes. The Project will thus\ncontribute to the Port's cargo handling capacity and ease its\ncongestion.\n56. Based on forecast incremental container traffic and the\nlatest cost estimates for the Project, the financial internal rate of\nreturn (FIRR) is 6.5 per cent. On the basis of readily available\nquantifiable economic costs and benefits, the economic internal rate\nof return (E1RR) is estimated at 14 per cent.\n57. No significant risks are associated with the proposed\nProject.\nIV. LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY\n58. Drafts of the following loan documents are circulated\nherewith.\n(I) Loan Agreement (Ordinary Operations) between the Bank\nand the Penang Port Commission; and\n(ii) Guarantee Agreement between Malaysia and the Bank.", "59. The provision of the Bank's Ordinary Operations Loan\nRegulations dated 16 December 1982 are incorporated in the Loan\nAgreement, subject to the modifications set forth in Section 1.01 of\nthe draft Loan Agreement.\n60.
