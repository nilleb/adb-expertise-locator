I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Hunan Xiangjiang Inland Waterway Transport \nProject.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n2.  Inland waterway transport (IWT) is an efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly \nway to move bulk commodities over long distances. Efficient use of waterways in a country to \ntransport cargo can reduce congestion on roads and railways, lower the average amount of \nenergy needed for freight transport overall, and cut back emissions of greenhouse gases. IWT \ncan also be developed in ways that bring other benefits, such as the generation of hydroelectric \npower. \n \n3.  The People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has the world\u2019s largest IWT network, both in terms \nof length and freight volume.2 About 24,000 kilometers (km) of the country\u2019s waterways, or roughly \n20% of the overall IWT network, are in the commercially significant class I\u2013V category, which \nmeans they can accommodate sizeable vessels for navigation. Another 50% of the waterways \nare unclassified and 30% are in classes VI\u2013VII. However until 2000, the government put more \nemphasis on improving highways and railways than on developing IWT. Public investment fell \nbelow what was needed to maintain and renew IWT infrastructure. Many inland ports on the \nnetwork are old and lack specialized berths and modern handling equipment. The contribution of \nIWT to the overall transport system has also been constrained by weak institutional coordination \nbetween the local, regional, and national agencies involved.3 \n \n4.  The government is now paying more attention to IWT. In 2007, it issued the National Plan \nfor Inland Waterways and Ports (NPIWP), which was based on an assessment of IWT conditions \nand performance and outlined a program of investments to establish a network of upgraded, \ninterlinked IWT routes. The NPIWP aims to increase the class I\u2013III waterway network\u2014navigable \nby vessels of 500 deadweight tons (dwt)4 and above\u2014to 19,000 km by 2020 from less than 9,000 \nkm in 2006. Priority projects will aim to upgrade main national waterways to each of the main IWT \nsystems in the PRC from low classifications and make complementary improvements in their ports. \nThis will create a core waterway network that can handle larger vessels and help realize the full \neconomic potential of the country\u2019s extensive IWT network.  \n \n5.  Potential in Hunan province. Hunan is a landlocked province with a population of 68.4 \nmillion. One of six provinces supported by the government\u2019s Central Region Development \nStrategy, it is rich in navigable waterway resources and has the third longest provincial IWT \nnetwork in the PRC, with over 11,495 km of waterways, 107 ports, and 1,880 berths. However, \nonly 6% of its waterways and berths can accommodate vessels of up to 1,000 tons carrying \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2  The total length of navigable waterways stood at 123,683 kilometers (km) in 2009, of which 61,546 km were rated \nclasses I\u2013VII and 62,137 km were navigable but unclassified. Waterways are divided into classes based on the \nmaximum size of the vessels they can accommodate, measured by a vessel\u2019s carrying capacity in deadweight tons \n(dwt): class I (3,000 dwt), class II (2,000 dwt), class III (1,000 dwt), class IV (500 dwt), class V (300 dwt), class VI \n(100 dwt), and class VII (50 dwt). \n3  Sector Assessment: Transport, and Information and Communication Technology (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n4  Deadweight tonnage (or dwt) is a measure of how much weight a vessel is carrying or can safely carry. \n ", "2 \ncapacity. In 2009, the network carried only 10% of the overall freight transported in the province \nin terms of ton-kilometers (ton-km). This reflected the longstanding low level of investment in IWT, \nwhen compared with investment in other modes. For example, investment in Hunan IWT in 2009 \nwas CNY551 million, less than 1% of total road investment in the same year. \n \n6.  The Xiang River5 is one of the largest tributaries of the Yangtze River6 and the largest river \nin Hunan. It originates in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and its 969 km length includes \n773 km in Hunan (see map). The river flows from south to north, joins with Yangtze River,7 \nconnecting six of Hunan\u2019s cities8 and major concentrations of population with the PRC\u2019s east \ncoast seaports. Hunan\u2019s population and industry are concentrated along the Xiang River, which \noffers great opportunities for transporting minerals and agricultural products from the PRC\u2019s inland \nto its major eastern seaboard markets through the use of IWT shipping services. \n \n7.  Under vessel standardization programs of the Ministry of Transport (MOT), the average \nvessel capacity in Hunan has increased from 213 dwt in 2005 to 318 dwt in 2010. The largest \nvessel now in operation is 5,600 dwt. Traffic on the Xiang River has grown 21% per annum since \n2000 but most of the increase in vessel size and traffic has occurred downstream near the \nYangtze River.9 The limited depth of the water and long rocky shoals along the Xiang River\u2019s \nmiddle and upper reaches have prevented safe year-round access by large vessels.10 Further \ntraffic growth is also constrained by obsolete and insufficient infrastructure and loading facilities \nin the river\u2019s ports. The government is prioritizing the removal of these bottlenecks, which increase \nthe freight costs and voyage times on these parts of the river.  \n \n8.  Need for inland waterway infrastructure. The Hunan provincial government (HPG) has \nrecognized the potential role of IWT and is pursuing a more balanced transport strategy. In 2007, \nit formulated the Xiang River Network Master Plan, 2008\u20132020, which lays out a comprehensive \nnavigation,  water  resources,  and  hydroelectric  power  development  approach  to  2020  and \nemphasizes IWT infrastructure development more than previous schemes did.11 The plan aims \nto gradually make the Xiang River navigable year-round for barges of up to 1,000 dwt in its middle \nand upper reaches and for barges of up to 2,000 dwt on its lower reaches so as to lower average \ntransport costs by one-third to one-half. Once the plan is carried out, the Xiang River will become \none of the most important freight corridors in Hunan. \n \n9.  To increase traffic on the waterway and reduce the transport costs, port capacity will also \nneed to be expanded, particularly in the river\u2019s middle and upper reaches. The existing inland \nports are aging and poorly equipped. Larger and more specialized barges will also be needed to \nimprove the economics of the industry and reduce IWT costs. The average size of vessels using \nthe Zhuzhou complex (see map), which was expanded under a World Bank IWT project, was \n                                                 \n5  The Xiang River is also called Xiangjiang in Chinese. \n6  Yangtze River is also called Changjiang in Chinese. \n7  The Yangtze River (6,300 km), the largest waterway in the PRC, flows from Qinghai in the west to Shanghai in the \neast.  \n8  Together with its tributaries (the Xiaoshui, Leishui, and Lushui), the Xiang River waterway is navigable for a total \nlength of 2,826 km. The six cities along the river (Changsha, Hengyang, Yueyang, Xiangtan, Yongzhou, and \nZhuzhou) are the source of 65% of the province\u2019s gross domestic product. \n9  Freight on the Xiang River waterway increased from 20 million tons in 2002 to 118 million tons in 2009.  \n10The river can be navigated by vessels of up to 1,000 dwt on the lower reaches, 300\u2013500 dwt on the middle reaches, \nand 50\u2013100 dwt on the upper reaches.  \n11 The plan included nine ship locks and powerhouse complexes, of which five are already in operation. The other \ncomplexes are either under construction (Changsha and Xiangqi) or at the planning stage, including Tugutang (output \n1 of the proposed project) and Taizhou (in Guangxi). \n ", "3 \nincreased steadily from 175 dwt in 1998 to 230 dwt in 2006.12 With further support and incentive \nschemes under the project, the upgrading of the fleet size and modernization process can be \naccelerated. \n \n10.  Need for hinterland waterway connections. Raw materials and agricultural products \nproduced in the hinterlands of Hunan are transported to urban areas for processing. This provides \nan important source of income and employment in poor rural areas13 and contributes to poverty \nreduction. Better transport and lower transport costs are needed to expand these activities. This \nincludes the need to improve the IWT connections and related IWT services in the hinterland. The \nupstream stretches of the Xiang River are fed by an IWT network of navigable minor rivers and \nstreams that services rural communities. New loading facilities are needed to give these remote \nareas better access to IWT. \n \n11.  Need for an integrated and sustained development policy. Stakeholders have many \ncompeting demands for the use and development of rivers in the PRC for irrigation, flood control, \npower  generation,  water  supply,  and  transport.  Lack  of  coordination  between  competing \ngovernment agencies has impeded the growth of IWT. An integrated, sustained IWT development \npolicy is needed, along with closer cooperation among government agencies. \n \n12.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) helped HPG design an IWT development road map \nin 2009.14 In line with this road map, the HPG established a permanent, high-level waterway \ntransport development committee (WTDC) in September 2011. It is chaired by the provincial \ngovernor and its members represent 19 related provincial agencies.15 The WTDC will develop \nand implement a medium-term development and reform agenda that will include creation of an \nIWT  development  fund  in  Hunan,  the  mobilization  of  increased  public  funding,  enhanced \ncooperation with relevant agencies, endorsement of incentive policies to promote inland shipping, \nand implementation of a comprehensive multimodal transport system. The Hunan Xiangjiang \nInland Waterway Transport Project will finance a team to provide advice to the WTDC. This team \nwill comprise representatives from the Hunan provincial department of transport (HPDOT), the \nHunan  Maritime  Affairs  Bureau,  and  the  Hunan  Xiangjiang  Navigation  Construction  and \nDevelopment Company (XNCD). It will be assisted by project implementation consultants. The \nsupport and advisory team will prepare a policy working paper on IWT development, including a \nreform agenda and action plans to accelerate IWT development in Hunan. The plan will be \ndiscussed and endorsed by the WTDC. \n \n13.  To realize the NPIWP, arrangements for financing and managing waterways in Hunan will \nneed to be consolidated and enhanced. The project will support the establishment of a new IWT \nenterprise, the Hunan Waterway Transportation Construction and Investment Company. The \ncompany will be established by 31 December 2013 to construct, develop, operate, and maintain \ninland waterway channels and associated assets in Hunan. \n \n14.  The development of the inland waterway sector in Hunan has been hampered by a lack \nof awareness among decision makers and shippers of IWT\u2019s potential and their continued use of \noutmoded vessels, methods, and skills. Through policy dialogue during project preparation, ADB \nand HPG agreed that the project would support steps to address several constraints: \n                                                 \n12 The World Bank. 2008.

Manila. \n15 The composition of the WTDC is detailed in the Sector Assessment (Summary): Transport, and Information and \nCommunication Technology (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "4 \n(i)  Advocacy and promotion. The project will pilot IWT promotion schemes to raise \nawareness and influence land development policy and shippers\u2019 modal choice \ndecisions. \n(ii)  Innovation  and  modernization  program.  The  project  will  promote  fleet \nmodernization programs to encourage safer, cleaner, better quality inland shipping. \nThis will be done by replacing older vessels with better ones, equipping inspection \nand patrol vessels, and introducing a green reward incentive system for vessel-\nrelated waste collection. \n(iii)  Skills  improvement.  The  project  will  initiate  modern  IWT  management  and \nsupport systems, improve capacity building of HPDOT and XNCD, and increase \nthe  level  of  professionalism  in  the  IWT  sector  by  enhancing  monitoring  and \ninspection skills and initiating vocational and other training programs. \n \n15.  Rationale for ADB involvement. The project will build on ADB\u2019s past involvement in \ninfrastructure development in Hunan. One road project is ongoing and the completed Hunan \nExpressway, Hunan Lingjintan Hydropower, and Hunan Roads Development II projects were \nrated  satisfactory.16 The  project  will  make  a  significant  contribution  toward  realizing  the \nconsiderable potential for using IWT in the PRC and thereby to making the country\u2019s transport \nsystem  more  sustainable.  Since  this  is  ADB\u2019s  first  IWT  project  in  the  country,  it  will  also \ndemonstrate  ADB\u2019s  commitment  to  focusing  future  transport  sector  support  on  the  more \nsustainable forms of transport, in line with ADB\u2019s Sustainable Transport Initiative.17 The project \nwill serve as a demonstration of the potential of IWT for wider use in the PRC and in other \ndeveloping member countries with IWT potential. \n \n16.  The project has been given high priority under the NPIWP. It is fully in line with ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 and country operations business plan, 2012\u20132014 for \nthe PRC since it will (i) contribute to the greening of ADB\u2019s transport portfolio, (ii) address the \nmanagement of resource scarcity and environmental conservation by reducing air pollution and \nconserving water resources, and (iii) increase accessibility of rural poor to IWT infrastructure.18 \nADB\u2019s involvement will strengthen IWT policy, institutions, capacity, and efficiency in Hunan. The \nproject will provide further momentum to IWT policy reform in Hunan. \n \n17.  Lessons. The project design benefits from several lessons from seven inland waterway \nprojects in the PRC financed by the World Bank,19 including two projects involving the XNCD.20 \nFirst, a barrage can improve navigation by raising the water level but also provides opportunities \nfor hydroelectric power generation. This dual benefit feature can enhance the economic and \nfinancial return of barrage construction. Second, achieving an integrated inland water policy \nrequires sustained efforts at the senior level across several jurisdictions. This will be facilitated \nunder the project through the WTDC, which will bring together the main agencies involved in \ninland shipping to maximize the benefits of water resources utilization and conservation. Third, \nfull cost recovery from IWT alone is difficult to achieve because revenues rarely cover all costs. \nHowever, these costs are small compared with those of other modes, both in absolute terms and \n                                                 \n16 Details of these projects are in Table 2 of Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n17 ADB. 2010.

Manila. \n19 Three of the previous World Bank projects were rated satisfactory, including both projects in Hunan province, and \nfour are still under implementation. \n20 Established in 1994, XNCD is responsible for the implementation and operational management of Xiang River \nnavigation infrastructure projects. XNCD has implemented the Hunan components of two waterway projects financed \nby the World Bank in a satisfactory manner. \n ", "5 \nin proportion to traffic handled. Given IWT\u2019s greater energy efficiency and smaller environmental \nfootprint, the project will promote the adoption of increased public funding for IWT as a WTDC \npriority. Fourth, a realistic procurement and civil works construction plan is essential for navigation \nimprovements. To ensure readiness, project preparation gave special attention to technical \ndesign and implementation planning. Preliminary engineering design for the project has been \nsubstantially completed. Fifth, creating a technical advisory panel can help to ensure high \ntechnical, operational, and safety standards. Such a panel, to be financed by the ADB loan, will \nbe established under the project to assist in ensuring that the navigation complex will be built in \naccordance with high technical, operational, and safety standards. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n18.  The impact will be an efficient, safe, affordable, and sustainable inland waterway transport \nsystem developed in Hunan province. The outcome will be a low carbon waterway transport \nsystem improved on the Xiang River in Hunan province.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n19.  The project aims to achieve integrated development of water resources in a poor area of \nHunan province through three outputs. Details of the project description are in Appendix 1 of the \nproject administration manual.21 \n \n20.  Output 1: Tugutang navigation-cum-hydropower generation complex constructed. \nThe complex will be located about 39 km upstream of Hengyang City. It includes a ship lock \ncapable of accommodating class III vessels. It will also have a run-of-the-river barrage with a low \nhead (10 m) to regulate river levels and flows and a power plant with a capacity of 90 megawatts \nthat will capture the river\u2019s hydropower to generate 363 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of hydroelectric \npower per year. Other works will include 3.1 km of 110-kilovolt transmission lines connecting the \npower plant to Yunji substation; 4.4 km of access roads to the complex on both banks; operational \naccess over the river at the crest of the barrage; reservoir bank protection; dredging and channel \nimprovements; and installation of navigational aids and other auxiliary facilities, including a fish \npass 774 meters (m) long. Upon completion, the complex will expand the waterway\u2019s navigable \ncapacity by deepening an 89 km stretch of the river between Jinweizhou and Hengyang to a \nminimum water depth of 2.4 m. This will allow 1,000 dwt capacity vessels and towed barges to \nnavigate to and/or from all cities along the Xiang (773 km) and Yangtze Rivers. \n \n21.  Output 2: Cargo terminal berths at Songbai and Yunji and public landing stages \nimproved. Two 80 m long, 1,000 dwt berths will be constructed at Songbai and Yunji. The \neconomy of Songbai, which is rich in mineral resources, is now constrained by the small size of \nits 300 dwt berth. The proposed 1,000 dwt berth and associated dredging at Yunji will serve the \nnew town of Hengnan county and the factories manufacturing garments, shoes, and other \nconsumer products in its industrial park. The project will also provide 71 landing stages to give \nrural communities better access to IWT. This output will be financed by the government\u2019s \ncounterpart funding. \n \n22.  Output 3: Capacity and performance of waterway management agencies enhanced. \nThe project will strengthen Hunan\u2019s institutional capacity for developing and administering its \ninland waterway system by providing consulting services, training, equipment, and studies. It will \nhelp  the  HPG  formulate  policies  and  measures  to  promote  IWT  development.  An  IWT \ndevelopment road map is in Appendix 2 of the project administration manual (footnote 21).  \n                                                 \n21 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n23.  The  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $393.32  million,  including  taxes  and  duties  of \n$21.17 million (Table 1). The government has requested a loan of $150,000,000 from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 27-year term, including \na grace period of 7 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility,22 a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The loan \nwill  also  finance  transport,  insurance,  local  bank  charges,  and  taxes  and  duties23 on  the \nexpenditures financed by ADB. \n \n24.  The ADB loan proceeds will be made available to the HPDOT through the HPG on the \nsame terms and conditions as the ADB loan. The HPG will onlend the loan proceeds to the \nimplementing agency (XNCD or its successor) on the same terms and conditions as those of the \nADB loan. The HPDOT and XNCD will assume the foreign exchange and interest rate variation \nrisks for the ADB loan. The government will finance contingencies and financing charges during \nimplementation.  \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan ($ million) \nItem    Amounta\nA.  Base Costb    \n  1.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n \n27.  The engineering design is based on adequate reliable data obtained through detailed \ngeological and hydrological investigations, as well as a due diligence review conducted under the \nproject preparatory technical assistance (footnote 14). During the feasibility study and preliminary \ndesign phases, alternatives were analyzed and the design was optimized, with a focus on the key \n ", "8 \ntechnical elements. Aspects addressed included the navigation-cum-hydropower complex site \nand layout, river water level, flood control, the layout of the complex, ship lock capacity, and the \ntype of hydropower plant. These efforts will limit the need for any further design changes. They \nwill also help ensure that a realistic construction schedule, based on up-to-date information, is \nadopted in the tendering documents. The technical specifications are provided in the project \nadministration manual (footnote 21). The project will finance a five-member technical advisory \npanel to review all technical, operational, and safety aspects of the detailed design, procurement, \nand construction, among other aspects. The panel will conduct periodic reviews in the fields of \ngeology,  seismology,  sedimentation,  concrete  placement,  environmental  protection,  land \nacquisition, and resettlement. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n28.  Cargo traffic is increasing steadily on the Xiang River, which shows that IWT is a cost-\neffective method for transporting bulk freight. IWT carried 12% of the total ton-km of freight in \nHunan in 2010. Once the project is complete and the intended water level reached, the average \nsize of vessels using the Tugutang section is projected to increase from 225 dwt in 2010 to 516 \ndwt in 2020 and 649 dwt in 2030. IWT on the Xiang River will become more cost-effective, \nbecause larger vessels will be able to navigate upstream to Jinweizhou (see map) from Shanghai \nor Chongqing on the Yangtze River during the dry season. The traffic forecast is in Appendix 3 of \nproject administration manual (footnote 21).   \n \n29.  This is a multipurpose project. Its quantified economic benefits comprise (i) savings in the \ncost of inland waterway transport, (ii) benefits from hydropower generation, and (iii) reduction in \ngreenhouse gases and air pollution through clean energy production. On average, the project will \navoid the emission of approximately 290,000 tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each \nyear by generating electricity through hydropower rather than fossil fuels. It will further reduce \nsuch emissions by reducing highway traffic congestion as the transport of bulk cargo shifts to \nwaterways from roads. The project will also contribute to more reliable irrigation. The project is \neconomically viable, with an estimated economic rate of return of 14%. Sensitivity analysis \nconfirms the robustness of its economic viability.  \n \n30.  The financial analysis confirmed that the project is financially viable. The estimated \nfinancial internal rate of return of 3.32% exceeds the weighted average cost of capital of 2.25%. \nElectricity revenues will allow the project to meet debt service obligations as well as provide for \noperation and maintenance. The HPG has agreed to provide budgetary support to cover any \nshortfall of funds if needed. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n31.  All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). The relevant sections of \nthe ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) will be included in all procurement \ndocuments and contracts. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment,  the  HPG,  the  HPDOT,  and  XNCD.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 21). \n \nD.  Poverty, Gender and Social \n \n32.  Waterway users will benefit from the expanded, more affordable, and more reliable IWT \nservices the project will provide. The complex\u2019s hydropower facility will generate health and \n ", "9 \nenvironmental benefits through better air quality by replacing a new thermal power plant that \nwould have been needed in a without-project scenario to meet demand for electricity.  \n \n33.  The project will extend IWT cargo services to remote areas. It will reduce transport costs \nbetween the comparatively less developed inland province of Hunan and the PRC\u2019s economically \ndynamic coastal region. This will benefit 14 million people in cities of Hengyang and Yongzhou, \nand Guiyang county. The beneficiaries will include 637,000 rural residents and 273,000 urban \ndwellers who are poor, based on the government\u2019s average annual per capita net income of \nCNY1,196 for rural areas and its minimum living standard scheme for urban areas. The poor will \nbenefit in particular through the improved access to markets they will gain for their products. \nStarting in 2017, the project\u2019s annual power output of 363 GWh of clean and renewable energy \nwill meet the electricity needs of about 300,000 households. Local officials in the project area \nestimate that at least 50,000 additional jobs will be created during implementation.  \n \n34.  Gender benefits (effective gender mainstreaming). The project design includes several \ngender-sensitive measures, with a focus on consultation with women and their involvement in \nnon-farm training. XNCD will work with women\u2019s federations, contractors, and communities to \nfacilitate paid work for women in the project\u2019s physical works, and to ensure that all PRC labor \nlaws and core labor standards are respected. Livelihood restoration and gender mainstreaming \nmeasures associated with resettlement are incorporated in the resettlement plan and project \ndesign. The project will allocate $50,000 to provide non-farming skills training to women that will \nopen up new job opportunities for them in the project\u2019s two port improvement areas. The project \nwill ensure active participation by women by appointing a qualified staff member in XNCD to be \nresponsible for the dissemination of information, implementation, and monitoring of the gender \naction plan. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n35.  Environment (category A). There are no nature reserves or protected areas around the \nproject complex. The complex will have a run-of-the-river barrage structure with a low head of 10 \nmeters.  An  environmental  impact  assessment  was  prepared  in  compliance  with  the  PRC \nregulatory framework and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). 24 Two rounds of public \nconsultations  were  undertaken,  including  a  community  survey.  The  environmental  impact \nassessment was circulated to ADB\u2019s Board of Directors and made public through the ADB website \non 4 August 2011. The potential effects include adverse impacts on water quality through re-\nsuspension of heavy metals in sediments and subsequent impacts on downstream water quality. \nThe project environmental management plan provides $16.5 million for mitigation measures to \nprevent  or  reduce  project\u2019s  potential  environmental  impacts.  The  HPDOT  and  XNCD  will \nimplement  the  environmental  management  plan,  which  will  be  incorporated  in  the  bidding \ndocuments and contracts for civil works. Impacts will be monitored and semiannual reports \nsubmitted to ADB. In addition to the project\u2019s mitigation measures, the HPG will invest $9.2 billion \nto support a variety of environmental mitigation measures to prevent water pollution in Xiang River \nfrom 2011\u20132015. \n \n36.  Resettlement (category A). A resettlement plan was developed in accordance with the \nPRC\u2019s laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, with participation from local \ngovernments and the affected people.25 Resettlement information booklets have been distributed \nto affected villages. The project will affect 53 villages in 14 townships and/or towns in three \n                                                 \n24 Environmental Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \ncounties. The project will permanently acquire 386.1 ha of land and will temporarily occupy 13.1 \nha of land. Most of the affected households will lose only part of their total landholding. Land \nacquisition and house demolition is expected to affect 5,286 persons. A total of 30 households \n(127 persons) will need to be relocated. The resettlement budget is estimated at CNY467 million, \nor about 19% of the project cost. The project is classified as category C for impact on indigenous \npeoples, with none expected and no action required.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n37.

ASSURANCES \n38.  The Government of the PRC and the HPG have assured ADB that implementation of the \nproject shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents. The government has \nagreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the draft loan and \nproject agreements. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n39.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$150,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Hunan Xiangjiang Inland Waterway \nTransport Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term \nof 27 years, including a grace period of 7 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project agreements presented \nto the Board. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n \n15 November 2012 \n                                                 \n26 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nAn efficient, safe,  On average, the total traffic  Hunan Navigation  Government \naffordable, and  ton-km carried by IWT in  Statistical Yearbook  investments in waterway \nsustainable inland  Hunan increases by 5% per    transport projects are \nwaterway transport  annum from 2010 to 2023.    implemented as \nsystem developed in  (2010 baseline: 35.1 billion  planned. \nHunan province  ton-km)   \nOutcome      Assumptions \nA low carbon  Safe navigation for vessels  Hunan Navigation  Construction of other \nwaterway transport  up to 1,000 dwt throughout  Statistical Yearbook   navigation complexes on \nsystem improved on  the 495 km channel between  Xiang River proceed as \nthe Xiang River in  Jinweizhou on the Xiang  planned. \nHunan province  River and the Yangtze River   \nby 2018. \n \n  Average size of vessels  HPDOT  The MOT and the \nnavigating through the  HPDOT maintain \nproject site increases from  policies to modernize \n225 dwt in 2010 to 450 dwt in  the IWT vessel fleet. \n2018, offering the lowest per \nton-km tariff mode. \n \n  By 2018, about 290,000 tons  PCR   \nof potential carbon dioxide \nemissions are eliminated \neach year through the \nproject\u2019s clean hydroelectric \ngeneration, compared with \nprojected without-project \nemission levels. \n \nOutputs       Risk \n1.
