The outcome will be improved access to sustainable water supply and sewerage services in the GSA.  \nThe investment program has three outputs:\n\nOutput 1: Supply and access to safe water in the GSA improved. The investment will expand water supply by 40,000 m3 per \nday by constructing a new supply intake on the Rewa river with associated water treatment plant, pumping station, reservoir, \nand transmission main to connect to the existing system. Reliable and sustainable long term operations and maintenance \npractices will be enhanced through a Design-Build-Operate (DBO) contracting arrangement. A catchment management plan will \nbe developed to safeguard the water source and ensure long term sustainability. Non-revenue water (NRW) reduction will be \nachieved by improving leak detection and repairs; replacing meters; and establishing district metering areas and pressure \nmanagement systems. Water Authority of Fiji (WAF) will supply 200 liters per capital per day to 315,947 persons by 2023, \nensuring continuous supply to 98% of the GSA population. The climate change component of Output 1 will include adaptation \nmeasures for building the new Rewa river scheme specifically moving the facility from 29 km to 49 km from the river mouth to \navoid future climate change impacts embodied in projected rising sea levels and potential migration of the salt water wedge up \nthe river.\n\nOutput 2: Wastewater treatment (WWT) and management capacity in the GSA increased. The wastewater network will be \nrehabilitated and expanded by: (i) upgrading 31 existing wastewater pumping stations; (ii) upgrading about 18 km of wastewater \ntrunk mains to increase carrying capacity; (iii) relining 13 km of wastewater trunk mains; and (iv) extending the wastewater \nnetwork to service an additional 15% of households (approximately 4,500 existing lots in backlog areas) currently using septic \ntanks. Additionally, the WWT capacity at Kinoya will be expanded by 164% to cover approximately 277,000 person equivalent to\ntreat wastewater from current and future households. By improving the network and expanding the WWT capacity, WAF will \nensure that 60% of households in the GSA will have access to a reticulated sewage collection system by 2023. The remaining \nhouseholds with individual septic units will be catered by a fecal sludge management system.\n\nOutput 3: WAF management and sustainable service delivery capacity improved. Program management and capacity \ndevelopment support will be provided to: (i) support WAF in the implementation of water demand management, NRW reduction \nand the national liquid trade waste management programs;  (ii) support the Department of Environment (DOE) developing the \nenvironmental regulatory framework for treated municipal wastewater discharge, sludge treatment and disposal practices and \nstandards, and associated monitoring and enforcement; (iii) complete the corporatization of WAF; (iv) formulate water safety \nplans to protect the quantity and quality of water at all source intakes;  (v) improve financial management; (vi) promote gender \nequity; and (vii) study alternatives to reduce the long term energy consumption of the existing urban WWT system.\nImpact: The impact will be sustainable urban growth and improved public health in the greater Suva area. \nOutcome: Access to sustainable water supply and sewerage services in GSA improved \nOutputs: (i)Supply and access to safe water in the GSA improved, (ii)Wastewater treatment and management capacity in the \nGSA increased,  and (iii)WAF management and sustainable service delivery capacity improved\n\nImplementation Arrangements: Ministry of Economy will be the executing agency.\n\n \n\nProject Readiness: Project Design Advance for Consultancy Packages have been contracted.\n\n12.

It  will  (i)  increase  the  capacity  of  the  GSA\u2019s  water  supply  and  wastewater  treatment \nsystems,  and  (ii)  help  the  state-owned  Water  Authority  of  Fiji  (WAF)  improve  its  operational \nefficiency and the quality of its services by reducing losses due to nonrevenue water (NRW) and \nimproving the management of water demand and liquid trade waste.2 The investment program \nwill  also  support  the  government\u2019s  development  and  implementation  of  water  and  sewerage \npolicy  and  regulatory  reforms.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  technical \nassistance  and  a  project  design  advance  loan  ($2.65  million)  to  prepare  the  investment \nprogram.3 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nBackground and sector issues. Fiji\u2019s population was estimated to be 893,000 in 2015, \nup from 837,200 in the last census in 2007.4 About 54% of its people live in urban areas, and \nthis  is  projected  to  increase  to  61%  by  2030.  About  57%  of  these  urban  dwellers,  or  about \n275,000  people,  are  concentrated  in  the  GSA.  Many  live  in  the  area\u2019s  informal  settlements \nwithout access to essential services. The GSA accounts for 40% of Fiji\u2019s gross domestic product, \nwhich makes solving its urban development issues critical to the country\u2019s economic future. The \ngovernment  has  increased  public  spending  to  improve  basic  services  and  address  the \nchallenges  and  unlock  the  economic  potential  of  the  area\u2019s  largely  unplanned  rapid  growth. \nGovernment resources are limited, however, investment in almost all public services has fallen \nshort of needs, including those for improved urban water supply and wastewater.  \n \nConstraints  on water  supply. The WAF\u2019s water supply network covered an estimated \n4. \n95% of the GSA\u2019s urban population in 2014, but services are intermittent in some communities \nand  face  several  constraints.  The Waila  and  Tamavua  water  treatment  plants  serve  the  GSA, \nwith a combined average production capacity of about 150,000 cubic meters (m3) per day. Both \nplants are operating at full capacity but cannot meet the current peak demand. This also means \nthat the WAF cannot expand its supply network to peri-urban or new growth areas. \n\n \n5. \nThe Waimanu River is currently the only source of raw water for treatment and supply, \nand it cannot fully meet the system\u2019s needs during extended droughts when its water level drops. \nService  interruptions  occur  not  only  during  dry  periods,  but  also  during  heavy  rains  when \nincreased  turbidity  requires  more  frequent  backwashing  of  the  water  treatment  plant  filters. \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   Liquid  trade  waste  is  wastewater  from  trade  or  industrial  processes  that  is  discharged  into  sewers.  It  does  not \n\ninclude domestic wastewater. \n\n3   ADB.  2013.

Fiji Urban Water Supply and Wastewater Management Project. Consultant\u2019s report. Manila (TA 8526-\n\n \n\nFIJ).   \n\n \n\n\f \n\n2 \n \n\nThese  interruptions  and  the  overall  reliability  of  the  water  supply  in  the  GSA  will  be  further \ncompromised by such forecast climate change impacts and more extreme weather events.  \n\n \n6. \nThe supply shortages are exacerbated by the WAF\u2019s high rate of NRW losses, although \nthese  have  declined,  through  the  utility\u2019s  significant  efforts,  from  51.0%  in  2014  to  39.2%  in \n2016.5 The WAF aims to reduce the NRW rate to 27% by 2033, which will require an increased \nfocus on detecting leaks, replacement of aging pipelines, and routine maintenance.  \n  \nWastewater  management. Public health risks in the GSA and pollution in local creeks \n7. \nand waterways have increased due to overflows from the WAF sewerage system, the discharge \nof  trade  and  industry  waste  into  storm  water  drains,  and  seepage  from  domestic  sanitation \nsystems.  In  2013,  only  36%  of  the  GSA\u2019s  urban  population  was  covered  by  its  existing \nsewerage  infrastructure. 6  The  Kinoya  wastewater  treatment\u2014the  GSA\u2019s  main  wastewater \ntreatment facility\u2014is working beyond its current rated capacity. Because of this, its final effluent \ndoes not meet regulatory standards. The plant needs hydraulic and treatment process upgrades \nif it is to properly treat current and projected wastewater flows. Insufficient investment in proper \nmaintenance  of  wastewater  treatment  and  sewerage  infrastructure  has  led  to  widespread \ndeterioration of these assets. The pump stations and pipelines need rehabilitation and capacity \nupgrades before any more connections can be made to the system.  \n\n \nInstitutional  framework.  The  government  assigned  the  functions  and  operational \n8. \nresponsibilities  of  its  water  and  sewerage  department  to  the  WAF  in  2007  and  made  it  a \ncommercial  statutory  authority  in  2010. 7  The  WAF  has  invested  in  capital  and  operational \nimprovements  aimed  at  providing  an  effective  water  supply  and  wastewater  system  and \nservices  in  the  GSA  even  though  the  government  has  not  enabled  it  to  become  financially \nautonomous, or allowed tariff adjustments to improve cost recovery. WAF revenue from tariffs in \nFY2014  totaled  $14.7  million.  With  earnings  of  $8.4  million  from  other  sources,  its  overall \nincome was $23.1 million. Its operational and maintenance costs, excluding depreciation, were \n$36  million.  The  WAF\u2019s  costs  rose  by  14%  during  2010\u20132014. 8  Although  the  WAF  has \nrequested  increases,  domestic  water  tariffs  have  not  changed  in  Fiji  since  a  value-added  tax \nwas  removed  in  1999.  Tariff  revenues  go  into  the  government\u2019s  consolidated  fund.  The \ngovernment  provides  annual  grant  subsidies  meant \nthe  WAF\u2019s  operational, \nmaintenance, and capital expenses.  \n\nto  cover \n\n \n9. \nThe  main  obstacles  to  the  WAF\u2019s  financial  sustainability  are  low  tariffs  and  the \nrequirement  that  it  remit  all  tariff  revenue  to  the  Ministry  of  Economy  (MOE)  (footnote  8).  The \nproposed  investment  program  will  support  WAF  to  be  more  financially  sustainable  and  more \naccountable to regulatory bodies by (i) helping it to improve its financial management systems, \n(ii) requiring the government to review and reform water and sewerage tariffs, and (iii) providing \nfor a review of regulations that affect how water resources and wastewater are managed. \n \n10. \nPolicy  framework,  sector  road  map,  and  investment  plan.  The  draft  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s  new  national  development  plan  (NDP)  for  2016\u20132036 9  focuses  on  achieving \ninclusive and sustainable development and meeting basic needs. The NDP makes the provision \n\n                                                 \n5  Government of Fiji, Water Authority of Fiji. 2016. Nonrevenue Water Quarterly 2016 Report.

Policy  reforms  include \ncompleting the WAF corporatization process to improve WAF\u2019s financial autonomy, operations \nand  service  delivery  which  is  required  under  both the WAF  Promulgation  2007,  and  under the \nPublic Enterprise Act 1996. There has been ongoing technical assistance and dialogue to help \nWAF in this regard and is a feature of the proposed MFF. Other sector improvements planned \ninclude  the  formulation  of  national  water  and  sanitation  policy,  water  catchment  management \nplans,  and  reviews  of  the  environmental  regulatory  framework.  A  key  regulatory  action  will \ninclude the municipal wastewater discharge standards to be reviewed and strengthened under \nthe Environment Management Act 2005. \n  \n11. \nThe NDP provides a road map, strategic context, policy framework, and a medium-term \nsector development plan (SDP) 2016\u20132021, for water supply and sanitation (WSS). The SDP\u2019s \nobjectives  cover \nintegrated  water  resource \nmanagement; and improvements in sector policy, legislative, and regulatory frameworks.10 The \nNDP\u2019s long-term target for 2035 is for 100% of the population to have access to piped and safe \ndrinking water, and 70% to have access to a central sewerage system. The SDP target for 2021 \nis  access  to  piped  and  safe  drinking  water  for  100%  of  the  country\u2019s  urban  population  and \naccess to a central sewerage system for 40% of urban residents. The SDP adopts an inclusive \ndevelopment  approach  that  targets  the  urban  poor,  particularly  those  living  in  (i)  peri-urban \nsquatter  settlements  that  have  limited  access  to  water  and  sewerage  services,  (ii)  existing \nsuburban  residential  areas  not  currently  serviced,  and  (iii)  new  growth  areas.  The  annual \nfinancing  requirements  for  the  SDP  exceed  all  previous  annual  budget  provisions.  The  SDP \nobjectives  are  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  water  operational  plan  for  2011\u20132020  and  ADB\u2019s  water \npolicy.11 The overall sector strategy is supported by a WAF water and wastewater master plan \nfor the GSA covering 2013\u20132033 (footnote 6). \n \n12. \nStrategic  context.  The  proposed  investment  program  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership  strategy  for  Fiji  for  2014\u20132018,  which  aims  to  improve  municipal  services  in  the \ncountry  by  continuing  to  upgrade  urban  WSS  systems,  introducing  utility  tariffs  that  cover  the \ncosts  of  service  delivery,  and  improving  environmental  infrastructure.  ADB  has  been  a  long-\nstanding partner in government and WAF efforts to implement WSS reforms and improve urban \nWSS infrastructure.12 The proposed MFF is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan \nfor 2017\u20132019 and is consistent with ADB\u2019s objective to enter into a long-term partnership with \nFiji to support the country\u2019s growth potential, particularly by strengthening WSS services.13  \n \nUse  of  the  multitranche  financing  facility.  Use  of  ADB\u2019s  MFF  modality  for  the \n13. \ninvestment program provides three advantages for ADB and the government. It will help achieve \nADB\u2019s objective under its country operations business plan to establish a long-term partnership \nwith  Fiji  to  enhance  WSS  services.  It  will  help  the  government  manage  its  development \nfinancing efficiently. It will improve the government\u2019s capacity to meet the required development \n\n                                                 \n10  Sector Development Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11  ADB. 2003.

They are to be sequenced based on (i) project readiness, \n(ii) the introduction of reforms, and (iii) the WAF\u2019s demonstrated absorptive capacity to operate \nand  maintain  the  new  systems. WAF  has  increased  its  project  staff  to  support  the  investment \nprogram  implementation;  this  coupled  with  the  support from  the  PDA  consultants,  will  mitigate \ngovernance  and  capacity  risks.  The  required  MFF  requirements\u2014i.e.,  a  sector  road  map,  an \ninvestment program, strategic context, and a policy framework\u2014are in place. The MFF modality \nwill  give  the  government  ongoing  support  for  medium-  and  long-term  investment  planning.  It \nallows  ADB  to  align  financing  with  project  readiness  and  sector  reforms.  The  government \nrequested  an  MFF  because  of  its  flexibility  and  the  ability  it  affords  to  finance  investments \nsequentially  as  each project  becomes  ready for  implementation  and  will  contribute  37%  of the \noverall investment program financing. \n\n \n14. \nDevelopment partner coordination. ADB has been engaged in Fiji\u2019s WSS sector since \n1998  and  takes  a  lead  role  in  coordinating  development  partner  planning  and  activities.  Past \nsector  lessons  demonstrate  that  the  sector\u2019s  physical  investment  requirements  exceed  the \nfinancing available from any single development institution. They also show a need for capacity \nbuilding and the importance of strong leadership by the government and WAF. While preparing \nthe  proposed  investment  program,  ADB  helped  the  government  successfully  apply  for  grant \nfinancing  of $31  million  to the  Green  Climate  Fund (GCF)  and  collaborates  with the  European \nInvestment Bank, which is committed to cofinancing the investment program.  \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n15. \nThe impact will be sustainable urban growth and improved public health in the GSA. The \noutcome  will  be  improved  access  to  sustainable  water  supply  and  sewerage  services  in  the \nGSA.    \n \nC. \n \n16. \nOutput 1: Supply of and access to safe water in the greater Suva area improved. \nProject 1 of the investment program will increase water supply to the GSA by 40,000 m3 per day \nby constructing a new supply intake on the Rewa River, an associated water treatment plant, a \npumping  station,  a reservoir,  and  a  transmission  main to  connect the  new  water  supply  to the \nWAF\u2019s  existing  distribution  system.  To  enhance  climate  resilience,  the  planned  location  of  the \nnew  Rewa  River  scheme  is  located  49  kilometers  (km)  from  the  river\u2019s  mouth  to  avoid  the \npotential future impacts of rising sea levels that are likely to push saltwater further up the river. \nReliable, long-term operation and maintenance will be provided through a design\u2013build\u2013operate \ncontracting  arrangement.  A  water  safety  plan  and  water  catchment  management  plan  will  be \ndeveloped  to  safeguard  the  water  source  and  ensure  long-term  sustainability.  Leak  detection \nwill  be  improved,  repairs  undertaken,  water  meters  replaced,  and  district  metering  areas  and \npressure management systems established in WAF\u2019s existing distribution network to reduce the \ncurrent  high  level  of  NRW  down  to  36%  by  2022.  During  implementation  of  the  investment \nprogram, WAF will be able to expand network coverage and provide 98% of GSA\u2019s population \nwith a continuous supply of safe water by 2023. \n \n\n                                                 \n14  Comparison of Multitranche Financing Facility vs. Sovereign Loan (accessible from the list of linked documents in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nOutput  2:  Wastewater  treatment  and  management  capacity  in  the  greater  Suva \n17. \narea  increased.  Project  2  of  the  investment  program  will  be  to  rehabilitate  and  expand  the \nsewerage  network  by  (i)  upgrading  31  existing  wastewater  pumping  stations,  (ii)  upgrading \nabout  18  km  of  sewer  trunk  mains  to  increase  carrying  capacity,  (iii)  rehabilitating  13  km  of \nsewer  trunk  mains,  and  (iv)  extending  the  sewerage  network  to  service  an  additional  4,500 \nhouseholds  currently  using  on-site  septic  tanks.  The  wastewater  treatment  capacity  at  Kinoya \nwill be increased twofold, providing effective treatment of wastewater for up to 277,000 people \nin the GSA. By increasing wastewater treatment capacity and expanding the sewerage network, \nthe WAF will ensure that 60% of households in the GSA have access to a reticulated sewerage \nsystem by 2023.   \n\n \n18. \nOutput  3:  Water  Authority  of  Fiji  management  and  sustainable  service  delivery \ncapacity  improved.  Through  the  Projects  1  and  2,  the  investment  program  will  provide \ninstitutional capacity building and implementation support. This support will help the WAF carry \nout programs to manage water demand, reduce NRW, and manage liquid trade waste.15 It will \nhelp the Department of Environment develop an environmental framework for regulating treated \nmunicipal  wastewater  discharge  and  residual  sludge  treatment  and  disposal  practices  and \nstandards,  along  with  associated  monitoring  and  enforcement  systems.  The  investment \nprogram  will  help  the  government  carry  out  the  corporatization  of  the  WAF,  improve  WAF\u2019s \nfinancial management, and promote gender equity.  \n \nD. \n \n19. \nThe  investment  program  is  estimated  to  cost  $405.1  million  (Table  1).  It  will  comprise \ntwo  projects.16 Detailed  designs for  new  infrastructure  under  both  projects are  at  an  advanced \nstage of preparation and expected to be final by June 2017. \n \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nTable 1: Investment Program \n($ million) \n\n \nItem \nA. \n \n \n\n \n \nBase Costb \n1.

Under \nthe  project  design  advance  loan,  consultants  have  been  recruited  to  (i)  finalize  the  detailed \nengineering designs for outputs 1 and 2, (ii) initiate the procurement process, and (iii) initiate the \nreform  and  capacity  building  initiatives  under  outputs  1  and  3.  The  detailed  designs  for  the \nphysical  works  for  output  2  are  advanced  and  expected  to  be  completed  by  June  2017. \nProcurement will be initiated in July 2017. Project 1 will include a design\u2013build\u2013operate contract \nfor the development of the new Rewa River water intake and water treatment plant. The location \nof the new Rewa River scheme provides additional security against salt water intrusion impacts \nthat  are  likely  due  to  climate  change  and  rising  sea  levels.  Project  1  will  support  the  detailed \nengineering, due diligence, and advance contracting for the physical wastewater treatment and \nsewerage system upgrades required for output 2 and scheduled under project 2.22 \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n24. \nPreliminary  economic  analysis  indicated  that  the  overall  investment  program  has  an \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 8.3%. The analysis noted that the investment program \nhas significant health and environmental benefits that should be considered as overall economic \nbenefits  but  were  not  quantified  for  calculating  the  EIRR.  With  this  in  mind,  the  program  is \nconsidered to have sufficient economic merit despite the EIRR being below the 12% threshold.  \nThe  EIRR  for  project  1  is  8.5%.  Project  1  will  increase  water  supply  in  the  GSA,  thereby \nimproving  the  WAF\u2019s  service  to  existing  customers  and  helping  to  accommodate  population \ngrowth  in  the  area.  Project  1  will  reduce  the  WAF\u2019s  high  levels  of  NRW,  making  more  water \navailable  at  a  relatively  low  cost.  The  project  will  prevent  a  gradual  erosion  of  the  current \nsystem\u2019s  capacity  due  to  lack  of  redundancy  for  maintenance.  Preliminary  calculations  for  the \nwastewater investments indicate an EIRR for project 2 of 7.7%. An expanded sewerage system \nwill  eliminate  costs  now incurred  by those  still to  be  connected  by  displacing  such  wastewater \ndisposal  systems  as  septic  tanks.  The  project  will  allow  higher  density  development  in  new \nareas to be served. A financial analysis prepared in accordance with ADB guidelines calculated \na negative financial internal rate of return for project 1 based on the assumption that the WAF\u2019s \ncurrent water tariffs will not increase.23 The current weighted water tariff of F$0.46 per m3 covers \nonly about half of the average incremental financial cost of the WAF water supply of F$0.94 per \nm3. To achieve an operating ratio of less than 1, project 1 will ensure (i) that tariff adjustments \nare made on the principle of cost recovery, and (ii) that the government makes funding available \nto fill the cost-recovery gap.  \n\n \nGovernance \n\nC. \n\n25. \nAn  assessment  conducted  by  ADB  of  the  WAF\u2019s  and  the  government\u2019s  financial \nmanagement  found  no  major  country-level  issues.  Fiji  has  an  effective,  well-functioning  public \nsector. The overall inherent risk was assessed as low, but the overall control risk was assessed \nas substantial. This is due to (i) the WAF\u2019s lack of financial autonomy, (ii) problematic findings \nfrom  the  WAF\u2019s  external  audits,  (iii)  weak  information  systems,  and  (iv)  inadequate  WAF \nreporting. The investment program will address the control risk through long-term WAF financial \nmanagement capacity building. It will support the corporatization of the WAF and help it develop \na strategy to become financially sustainable within the investment program period to improve its \nfinancial autonomy and service delivery.  \n \n\n                                                 \n22 Detailed designs for physical works and due diligence are expected to be completed by January 2018. \n23 ADB. 2005.
