It responds to the local government\u2019s vision for Pakse to \nbecome a green city and for the greater Pakse urban area to gain official city status in the future2 \nby improving citywide environmental improvements in solid  waste management, flood protection \nand  drainage,  and  riverbank  erosion  protection  along  the  Xedon  River;  supporting  community-\ndriven  initiatives  in  urban  environmental  improvements;  strengthening  local  capacity  in  urban \nplanning  and  services;  and  strengthening \nin  project  management  and \nimplementation. 3  The  project  contributes  to  the  Government  of  the  Lao  PDR\u2019s  long-term \nurbanization strategy and Pakse Urban Development Strategy, 2011\u20132030.4\n \n\nlocal  capacity \n\nA. \n\nRationale  \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n3. \nPakse is the largest urban center in the southern Lao PDR and the capital of Champasack \nprovince. Since the mid-1990s, it has grown to become a regional commercial and service center \nin the country and the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). It is becoming an important tourism hub \nand  staging post for the southern  Lao  PDR  and  the  GMS.  Pakse  is  strategically  located  on  the \nregional  road  network  (Road  13)  and  on  an  interconnector  link  from  the  East\u2013West  Economic \nCorridor to the Southern Economic Corridor in the GMS.5 Pakse district\u2019s population in 2010 was \n77,647;  this  is  expected  to  double  by  2030  based  on  annual  growth  of  3%.  The  population  of \ngreater  Pakse  urban  area6 in  2011  was  about  107,600;  this  is  expected  to  grow  to  138,700  by \n2020  and  176,100  by  2030.  Champasack\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  growth  has  averaged  9.8% \nsince 2006, driven largely by industry and services, accounting for 60% of total economic output in \n2010 compared to 49% in 2006. Revenue from tourism, banking, transport, and construction have \nalso surged. Pakse has significant natural attractions and is near major cultural and heritage sites \nsuch as Wat Phou. Tourism development has helped stimulate local investment in tourism-related \nfacilities  and  generate  local  employment.  Since  2005,  tourist  arrivals  in  Champasack  Province \nhave grown by an average of 20% per year, especially via the Cambodia and Thailand borders.7 \n\nDespite \n\nthese  growth  opportunities,  Pakse \n\n4. \nis  experiencing  rapid  environmental \ndegradation caused by significant urbanization and economic growth pressures. It has witnessed \nan  increase  in  traffic,  tourists,  and  commercial  activities.  Improvement  of  basic  urban  and \nenvironmental infrastructure and strengthening of local capacity to plan and manage urban growth \nare key steps in developing Pakse as a sustainable, livable, and competitive city. \n\n                                                \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Based  on  Champasack  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan,  2011\u20132015,  Pakse  District  Socioeconomic \n\nDevelopment Report, and Government Notification No. 1094/GOV/7 June 2011 to gain official city status. \n\n3  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA).  (ADB.  2010. \nTechnical Assistance to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for  the Pakse Urban Environmental Improvement \nProject. Manila [TA 7567-LAO].) \n\n4  The  draft  National  Urban  Sector  Strategy  prioritizes  Pakse  based  on  its  growth  and  regional  location.  Ministry  of \nPublic  Works  and  Transport.  2011.  The  National  Urban  Sector  Strategy  and  Investment  Plan  to  the  Year  2020. \nVientiane:  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban  Planning  (final  draft).  Pakse  Urban  Development  Strategy,  2011\u2013\n2030 was approved by the Office of Provincial Governor Champasack on 8 November 2011 (Decision No. 1445). \n5  The  East\u2013West  Economic  Corridor  passes  through  the  Lao  PDR,  Myanmar,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam,    and  the \n\nSouthern Economic Corridor passes through Cambodia, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n\n6  Includes 42 villages in Pakse district, 13 villages in Phonthong district, and four villages in Bachiang district. \n7  Pakse Tourism Development (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f2  \n\n \n\nUrban issues and challenges. Urbanization in the Lao PDR is taking place with minimal \n5. \ncoordination,  inadequate  infrastructure,  and  limited  consideration  for  the  environment,  including \nclimate change issues. Results include disorganized growth, inefficient land use, damage and loss \nof  natural  resources,  and  insufficient  urban  services.  The  problems  can  be  attributed  to  weak \nurban  management,  little  strategic  spatial  planning,  poor  linkages  between  urban  planning  and \nenvironmental management, and insufficient investment in infrastructure and community services. \nThe  Pakse  Urban  Development  Strategy,  2011\u20132030  is  a  significant  step  in  moving  away  from \ntraditional urban master plans to guide Pakse\u2019s future urban growth. \n\n6. \nWeak  urban  management  caused  by  overlapping  responsibilities  is  also  a  challenge.  In \n1998,  an  urban  development  administration  authority  (UDAA)  was  created  in  Pakse  and  other \nsecondary  towns  to  facilitate  effective  urban  management.  It  was  envisaged  that  UDAAs  would \neventually  be  transformed  into  autonomous  municipalities.  A  number  of  regulations  support  the \ndecentralization  of  government  functions  and  clarification  of  UDAAs\u2019  responsibilities,  but  the \nprocess has been slow. Preparation of a municipality administration decree will help to clarify the \nroles  and  responsibilities  of  UDAAs,  provincial  Departments  of  Public  Works  and  Transport \n(DPWTs), and district Offices of Public Works and Transport (OPWTs).8 In the interim, the project \nwill support capacity development activities for Pakse UDAA (P-UDAA) and Champasack DPWT \n(C-DPWT)  based  on  the  approved  road  map  for  urban  management  in  transition,  which  reflects \nPakse\u2019s application to become a city (or Nakhone).9  \n\nThe  urban  poor  suffer  disproportionately  from  inadequate  provision,  management,  and \n7. \nmaintenance of urban infrastructure and services. Underinvestment and insufficient operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) of existing infrastructure in low-lying areas have had  an adverse impact on \ntheir  health  and  access  to  livelihood  opportunities.  The  urban  poor  are  vulnerable  to  risks \nassociated  with  externalities  in  service  provision,  as  they  are  unable  to  cope  with  the  effects  of \npoor  drainage,  inadequate  sanitation  and  flooding,  and  poor  road  quality.  About  35%  of  the \n663 households surveyed live below the poverty line.10 The project targets improved drainage in \nlow-lying areas and supports household sanitation improvements for the poor. \n\n8. \nInadequate  solid  waste  management  poses  serious  environmental  and  health  risks,  and \nadversely  affects  Pakse\u2019s  ability  to  function  as  a  regional  economic  center.  The  Environmental \nRegulation  for  the  Urban  Area  of  Pakse  No.  160  (14  May  2001)  provides  for  proper  waste \nmanagement.11 However,  challenges  confronting  the  solid  waste  sector  in  Pakse  include  lack  of \nfinancial  resources  to  develop,  operate,  and  maintain  facilities;  inadequate  capacity  to  manage \nservices and concession contracts; low environmental awareness of residents; and generally low \nwillingness to pay for solid waste services. The P-UDAA household collection rate is about 21% in \nthe greater Pakse urban area, focusing on 28 of 43 villages in Pakse district. Households pay an \naverage of KN18,000 per month for collection and disposal, while commercial entities pay a tipping \nfee  of  KN100  per  kilogram.  About  25  tons  of  waste  per  day  are  transported  to  the  landfill  site, \nlocated 17 kilometers from the town center.12 About 22% of households recycle at the source and \n65%  reportedly  burn  their  waste.  The  project  will  assist  P-UDAA  to  improve  overall  solid  waste \nmanagement,  facilitate  amendments  to  the  existing  concession  for  waste  processing,  support \nbehavioral change efforts, and assist C-DPWT in enforcing environmental protection regulations. \n\n                                                \n8  The  government  envisions  that  provincial  towns  will  become  municipalities  before  they  gain  city  status.  The  key \n\ndifference between a municipality and a city is population size, as a city needs to have a population of 80,000. \n\n9  Champasack Provincial Governor Decision No. 611/CPS (16 May 2012);Prime Minister Instruction No. 01 (March \n2001); Prime Ministerial Decree No. 141 (May 2000); and Law on Local Administration (2003). Urban Institutional \nAnalysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n10 Prime Minister Decree No. 285 (October 2009). The poverty line is based on KN240,000 per person per month. \n11 It refers to the Environment Protection Law (3 April 1999) and the Prime Ministerial Decree for UDAA No. 177. \n12 Solid waste composition and volume was surveyed in 2010. Technical Report on Solid Waste Management in Pakse \n\n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fPoor drainage and increased flooding  create poor environmental conditions, increase the \n9. \nhealth risk from waterborne and water-related diseases, and contribute to a low quality of life for \nresidents.  Pakse  and  its  immediate  surroundings  are  susceptible  to  flooding,  as  it  lies  at  the \nconfluence of the Mekong and Xedon  rivers. Its central area is relatively flat,  while the drainage \ncapacity of small rivers in the town is limited. Flooding often occurs when the small streams back \nup because of surface runoff from the surrounding hills during heavy rainfall, or when river levels \nrise during the wet season. Property becomes inundated or surrounded by stagnant water. This is \nexacerbated when drainage easements are obstructed and retention areas are filled. The project \nsupports implementation of the drainage strategy, 2011\u20132015 to manage flood risk better, retain \nnatural drainage in nine catchment areas, and guide drainage system development in Pakse.13 \n\n10. \nRiverbank  erosion  caused  by  annual  floods  results  in  progressive  weakening  of  the \nriverbanks  and  creates  instability  at  various  locations.  Riverbank  erosion  along  the  Xedon  and \nMekong rivers is a major challenge. While riverbank protection is expensive, the loss of valuable \nriverside land and property such as temples has very high social, cultural, and economic impacts. \nFlooding and rapid drawdown of the river level are the dominant causes of riverbank erosion and \ndamage. The project will support riverbank erosion protection along the Xedon River.  \n\n11. \nBasic household sanitation and de-sludging services  are limited in Pakse.  About 30% of \nthe households surveyed use septic tanks, 67% use pit latrines, and 3% do not have any latrine. \nAbout 73% of households have never emptied their septic tanks, while about 41% complain about \nthe effluence and bad odor from sanitary facilities. Problems with septic tanks are related to poor \ndesign,  poor  quality  construction,  and  infrequent  cleaning.  About  50%  of  those  that  use \ndesludging tanker services emptied their tanks every year. The project will assist poor households \nto improve their sanitation facilities and help P-UDAA improve existing de-sludging services.14 \n\n12. \nRelated  policies  and  strategies.  The  project  is  in  line  with  the  Lao  PDR\u2019s  Seventh \nNational  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan,  2011\u20132015,  which  envisions  graduation  from  least-\ndeveloped  country  status  by  2020.  The  project  focuses  on  achieving  sustainable  and  inclusive \ndevelopment  by  transforming  the  key  urban  growth  area  into  a  competitive  and  green  urban \ncenter\u2014a  strategy  central  to  the  government\u2019s  draft  national  urban  sector  strategy  and  local \nsocioeconomic development plans. The project is also in line with the GMS strategy to transform \ntransport corridors into economic corridors. It has synergies with ADB\u2019s GMS Sustainable Tourism \nDevelopment Project15 and the proposed GMS Corridor Towns Development Project. The country \npartnership  strategy  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  the  Lao  PDR,  2012\u20132016  also \nemphasizes  stronger  rural\u2013urban  linkages  through  improved  urban  services  and  municipal \ninfrastructure.  The  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Urban  Operational  Plan,  2011\u20132020  under \nStrategy 2020, which fosters competitive, inclusive, and green cities by improving performance in \neconomic, equity, and environment areas.16 \n\n13. \nDevelopment  partner  coordination  exists  and  will  be  strengthened  through  the  technical \nworking  group  on  infrastructure  (subgroup  on  urban  development,  water  supply,  and  sanitation), \nchaired  by  the  Ministry  of  Public Works  and  Transport  (MPWT).  ADB  has  been  a  lead  partner  in \n\n                                                \n13 Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare, National Disaster Management Office, 2011, National Disaster Management \n\nPlan, 2011\u20132015 (draft, April, with support from the United Nations Development Programme). \n\n14 P-UDAA has about 30% of the septage services market on a volume basis and charges KN300,000 per trip. Three \n\nprivate entities also provide de-sludging services. \n\n15 ADB. 2008.

Other  key  partners  include  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nD\u00e9veloppement,  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  Korean  International  Cooperation \nAgency, Thailand Neighboring Countries Economic Development Cooperation Agency, the United \nNations  Human  Settlements  Programme,  the  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund,  the  World  Health \nOrganization,  and  the  Netherlands  Development  Organization.  The  Norwegian  Agency  for \nDevelopment  Cooperation  and  United  Nations  Development  Programme  previously  supported \nlandfill construction in Pakse. Parallel financing opportunities will be explored during implementation. \n\nLessons  from  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  the  urban  development  sector  in  the  Lao  PDR  are \n14. \nincorporated  in  the  project  design.  The  project  builds  on  the  support  provided  to  Pakse  under \nADB\u2019s Secondary Towns Urban Development Project and recommendations from ADB evaluation \nreports.17 Key  lessons  include:  (i)  active  community  participation  and  decentralized  decision \nmaking  are  key  to  enhancing  ownership  and  strengthening  the  capacity  of  communities  and \nlocal  government  agencies;  (ii)  support  for  community  planning  complements  central  (or \nprovincial) urban and regional plans; (iii) overlapping and ambiguous responsibilities should be \nresolved prior to investments in the sector; (iv) a more open-ended policy dialogue may be more \nhelpful than the application of loan covenants; (v) a multisector approach in the urban sector in \nLao PDR is implementable, as subsectors are within the mandate of a single ministry; and (vi) \nUDAAs often have insufficient funds and require budgetary support for O&M of infrastructure. \n\n15. \nSpecial  features.  The  project  is  in  line  with  the  Pakse  Urban  Development  Strategy, \n2011\u20132030, which integrates provincial and district socioeconomic objectives with overall national \nand  sector  objectives.  It  will  facilitate  efficient  urban  development  and  investment  through  a \nphased  and  more  flexible  approach.  The  project  supports  investments  aimed  at  improving  the \nconditions  of  the  urban  poor  and  low-income  households,  thereby  maximizing  potential  project \nbenefits.  It  promotes  community-driven  urban  development  and  community-led  service  delivery \nthrough village grants, which help to support a balanced approach to urban land use planning and \nreinforce  the  interlinks  between  urban  environmental  improvements,  health,  and  well-being.  It \nincludes support for continued policy dialogue and coordination at the national level to strengthen \ndecentralized  urban  management  and  services.  It  includes  support  to  implement  and  monitor  a \npublic\u2013private  partnership  in  solid  waste  management  for  possible  replication  in  other  towns.  It \nalso supports transformation of corridor towns to economic hubs and growth engines. \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n16. \nThe impact of the project is improved competitiveness of Pakse as a regional economic \nand tourism center of the southern Lao PDR. The outcome will be increased quality, reliability, \nand  coverage  of  urban  infrastructure  and  environmental  improvements  in  the  greater  Pakse \nurban  area.  By  2018,  the  project  will  enhance  the  urban  environment,  improve  public  health, \nand contribute to improved urban services for about 135,000 residents. It builds on a medium-\nterm investment planning exercise and prefeasibility study supported by the Cities Development \nInitiative for Asia in 2010, which prioritized improved solid waste management, improved urban \ndrainage, riverbank protection, and institutional capacity development and strengthening.18 The \nproject  will  pursue  an  integrated  program  of  investments  in  priority  infrastructure  rehabilitation, \nimprovement and extension of urban services, and organizational and capacity development of \nurban development and management agencies. \n                                                \n17  ADB.  2011.

This will include procurement of \nsolid waste collection and landfill equipment; improvement and capacity increase of \nthe existing landfill (or open dump) to a controlled landfill standard; possible landfill \nexpansion  to  accommodate  increased  volumes  of  waste  resulting  from  increased \ncollection;  and  improvement  of  an  existing  concession  contract  with  Khamtay \nGeneral Agricultural and Trading Co. Ltd. in solid waste processing and recycling.19 \nImproved flood protection and drainage conditions, including support for drainage \nimprovements  and  maintenance  of  natural  drainage  paths,  major  culverts,  and \nfloodwater retention areas. This includes installment of new storm-water pumping \nstations,  construction  or  rehabilitation  of  flap  gates,  and  construction  of  a  new \noutlet channel; construction of primary and secondary drains in priority catchments, \nmaintenance  of  flood  retention  areas  and  green  space,  and  improvement  or \nconstruction  of  access  roads  for  drainage  maintenance.20 The  project  adapts  a \nsustainable approach to floodplain management, consistent with Pakse\u2019s vision of \nbeing a green and environmentally sustainable city.  \nRiverbank  erosion  protection  along  the Xedon  River,  which  will  support  riverbank \nreinforcement  along  three  kilometers  of  Xedon  River\u2014along  both  sides  from  the \nRussian Bridge to the French Bridge and on the left side at Wat Ban Kea. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nOutput 2: Community-driven urban environmental improvements will enhance community \n19. \nparticipation  through  (i)  improved  solid  waste  collection  and  management  in  villages  of  greater \nPakse  urban  area  through  village  grants  (output  2.1),  and  (ii)  improved  household  sanitation \nthrough  sanitation  grants  (output  2.2). 21  The  project  will  support  each  village  development \ncommittee  in  local  urban  planning,  prioritization  and  selection  of  small-scale  infrastructure \ninvestments, and identification of poor households for sanitation improvements. Output 2.1 will be \nfinanced by the project funds (80%), government funds (10%), and community funds (10%). The \nproject  will  also  increase  public  awareness  in  solid  waste  management  and  support  P-UDAA  to \nimprove septage collection, treatment, and disposal. \n\n20. \nOutput  3:  Strengthened  capacity  for  provincial  urban  planning  and  services  supports \nurban  agencies  in  Pakse  to  deliver  quality,  reliable  urban  services  based  on  an  agreed  road \nmap for Pakse urban management in transition. It includes (i) strengthened capacity of P-UDAA \nin urban management and service delivery through better management of private concessions \nand improved operational and financial performance; (ii) strengthened capacity of C-DPWT and \nparticipating  OPWTs  in  urban  planning  and  development  control;  and  (iii)  enhanced  gender \nequity in urban planning, management, and service delivery through 1-year project internships \nfor about 40 students (50% women).22 \n\n                                                \n19 A  sanitary  landfill  is  not  feasible  in  Pakse  because  of  high  initial  and  operating  costs,  low  volumes  of  waste \ncurrently generated, high levels of technical expertise required, and people\u2019s low willingness to pay for collection. \nP-UDAA signed a concession contract on 20 June 2011 (contract no. 099/UDAA).  \n\n20 Provincial  Governor  Notification  No.  478/DGPS  (10  June  2011)  on  the  enforcement  of  retention  areas  and \n\ndrainage easement protection (Pakse Urban Development Strategy, 2011\u20132030). \n\n21 Output  2.1 is  estimated  at  $35  per  capita  per  village, and  output  2.2 at  about  $180  per household  for  pour-flush \ntoilets and $450 for a toilet with septic tank. Output 2 builds on ADB\u2019s experience in similar projects (footnote 17). \n22 Interns will be selected from educational and vocational institutions in Pakse, including Champasack University. Each \nintern will sign an agreement with the project management and implementation unit (PMIU) prior to participating in the \nprogram and receiving a stipend (about $1,250 for per diem, travel, and insurance). \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6  \n\n \n\nOutput 4: Strengthened capacity for project management and implementation  will focus \n21. \non the project coordination unit (PCU) and project management and implementation unit (PMIU). \nCapacity development activities may be extended to provincial project steering committee (PPSC) \nmembers,  and  staff  from  C-DPWT,  P-UDAA,  and  participating  OPWTs  in  the  greater  Pakse \nurban  area.  It  will  include  skills  enhancement  and  training  in  project  design  and  supervision, \ngender  and  community  development,  accounting  and  financial  management,  procurement  and \ndisbursement,  environmental  and  social  safeguards,  and  other  areas  agreed  to  in  advance  with \nADB.  It  will  support  on-the-job  training  for  C-DPWT  and  P-UDAA  in  urban  planning  and \ndevelopment, solid waste collection, and landfill management. \n\nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n22. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $31.74  million  (Table  1).

Citywide improvements target priority areas \nwhere  there  is  maximum  impact  on  local  communities  and  the  environment,  such  as  greater \nwaste  collection  and  organized  disposal,  drainage  in  low-lying  flooded  areas,  and  targeted \nriverbank  protection.  Engineering solutions  for  infrastructure  and  equipment  are  appropriate  and \ndeveloped  based  on  technical  viability  and  compatibility  with  local  conditions,  particularly  with \nrespect to local O&M capacity. To ensure durability and continuity of the proposed infrastructure, \ncontract  packages  will  attract  contractors  with  appropriate  skills  and  experience.  Community-\ndriven improvements will respond to local planning and prioritization results. Household sanitation \nimprovements will be based on function, cost, and long-term durability in an urban setting. \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nAn economic analysis was conducted following ADB\u2019s guidelines and best practices. The \n26. \nproject  contributes  significantly  to  the  improved  economic  welfare  of  Pakse  residents.  Drainage \nand sanitation components will significantly reduce the incidence and severity of flooding, reduce \nponding of polluted water in public areas, provide sanitation facilities in public areas and schools, \nenhance environmental and living conditions, and improve public health. The base case economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  is  15.8%  for  solid  waste  management,  21.8%\u201339.7% for  drainage \nand  storm  water,  and  26.2%\u201330.9%  for  riverbank  protection.  All  EIRRs  are  higher  than  ADB\u2019s \n12%  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital.  Sensitivity  analysis  showed  that  the  EIRRs  are  most \nvulnerable to changes in anticipated benefits. \n\nA  financial  analysis  was  conducted  following  ADB  guidelines  and  best  practices.  The \n27. \nfinancial  viability  was assessed for  solid  waste management  improvements,  as the  project\u2019s  only \nrevenue-earning  component.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  is  3.5%,  which  exceeds  the \nweighted average cost of capital of 0.4%, indicating financial viability. The remaining components \nare nonrevenue generating, so a financial sustainability analysis for P-UDAA was completed. While \nP-UDAA is recovering O&M costs for solid waste management through user charges, the analysis \nfound that it is unable to meet recurrent costs for collective urban services. The project will assist P-\nUDAA  to  improve  its financial  performance through  activities  such as corporate  planning,  annual \nbudget reviews, and establishment of an urban services charge. It will assist P-UDAA to undertake \nperiodic reviews of its solid waste management activities, highlighting the importance of translating \ncost recovery into continuous planning, operations, and ongoing construction for landfill expansion \nand landfill closure to absorb the amounts of waste collected. \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nA  financial  management  and  a  procurement  capacity  assessment  of  the  MPWT  and  P-\n28. \nUDAA  helped  to  confirm  the  project  implementation  arrangements,  which  follow  previous  ADB \nurban  development  projects  in  the  Lao  PDR.  The  executing  and  implementing  agencies  have \nexperience  in  managing  externally  funded  projects  and  have  sufficient  capacity  to  undertake \ninternational  and  national  competitive  bidding  for  civil  works  packages.  Output  4  will  strengthen \nthe  capacity  of  PMIU  staff  and  provide  on-the-job  support.  The  PCU  will  also  help  build  local \ncapacity  through  its  review  of  procurement  and  disbursement  documents.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption \nPolicy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and \nMPWT. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n\n \n\n\fD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n29. \nThe  project  will  have  significant  positive  social  and  environmental  impacts,  which  will \nimprove the overall attractiveness of Pakse and allow residents to seize commercial opportunities. \nIt will improve the lives and health of communities and individuals by (i) enhancing air quality from \nindiscriminate burning of waste; (ii) improving accessibility, which may be otherwise hampered by \nflooding; (iii) reducing vulnerability along the Xedon River; and (iv) enhancing local ownership and \nawareness  about  environmental  sanitation.  The  project  is  category  II\u2014effective  gender \nmainstreaming.  It  will  improve  women\u2019s  access  to  basic  urban  infrastructure  and  services.  A \ngender analysis and action plan has been prepared for the project, which creates opportunities for \nwomen  to  access  training  (33%)  and  project  internships  (50%),  to  participate  in  project \nimplementation units (33%), and to be employed in community infrastructure O&M (40%). \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n30. \nThe safeguard category for indigenous peoples is C, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (2009).  About  95%  of  the  population  in  the  greater  Pakse  urban  area  is \nTai Kadai  (Lao  majority).  The  Mon-Khmer  ethnic  group  and  some foreign migrants  (Vietnamese \nand  Chinese)  also  reside  in  the  project  area.  Most  of  the  Mon-Khmer  group  lives  in  Bachiang \ndistrict,  and  are  well-integrated  into  Lao  society.  No  adverse  impacts  are  anticipated  on  Mon-\nKhmer group or migrants in the project area. \n\n31. \nThe  safeguard  category  for  involuntary  resettlement  is  B.  A  resettlement  plan  and \nresettlement framework25 have been prepared. About 224 affected households or 1,250 affected \npersons  will  incur  minor  impacts.  One  affected  household  (or  three  affected  persons)  will  be \nseverely affected by riverbank erosion protection. The cost is estimated to be $2.36 million, which \nincludes  base  costs,  allowances,  and  contingencies.  A  cutoff  date  has  been  established  with \nextensive  stakeholder  consultation  and  participation.  A  project  information  booklet  has  been \ndisclosed to affected persons, which will be updated and distributed during implementation. \n\nThe  safeguard  category  for  the  environment  is  B.  An  initial  environmental  examination \n32. \n(IEE)  and  an  environmental  assessment  review  framework  have  been  prepared.  The  potential \nenvironmental  impacts  are  related  to  siting,  design,  construction,  and  operation,  and  are  not \nexpected  to  cause  irreversible  adverse  environment  impacts.  Environment  management  plans \n(EMPs)  have  been  prepared  for  solid  waste  management,  drainage,  and  riverbank  erosion \nprotection. The EMPs will form part of the bidding and contract documents. The potential adverse \nimpacts  during  construction  are  expected  to  be  temporary  and  can  be  mitigated  through \ncompliance with the EMPs. The project includes support for EMP implementation and monitoring. \n\n33. \nResettlement and environment documents have  been prepared in consultation with local \ncommunities and are in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and Lao PDR laws \nand  regulations.  The  documents  have  been  endorsed,  approved  and  posted  on  the  ADB \nwebsite.26 A grievance redress mechanism will help to facilitate resolution of complaints regarding \nproject performance.
