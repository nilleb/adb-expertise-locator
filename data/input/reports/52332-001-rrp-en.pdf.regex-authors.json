THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic of Indonesia for the Higher Education for Technology and Innovation Project. \n \n2.  The proposed project will support the government\u2019s human capital development agenda \nby strengthening the capacity of two public universities\u2014the Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember \n(ITS) in East Java Province and Universitas Lampung (UNILA) in Lampung Province\u2014to provide \ncutting  edge  higher  education  and  high-quality  research\u2014two  key  drivers  of  technology \ndevelopment and innovation. It will provide world-class academic facilities and innovation centers, \nand will strengthen faculty, staff, and student capacity to teach, research, and innovate. It will \nsupport the construction of a teaching hospital to boost capacity to develop high-quality health \npersonnel and provide quality medical services to respond to increased demand for health \nservices, including those triggered by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The project \nwill provide new research facilities and grants to stimulate commercialization of new products and \nfoster collaboration between universities and industry. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Macroeconomic context. Indonesia sustained average annual economic growth of 5.0% \nfrom 2015 to 2019, accompanied by low inflation, a credible fiscal framework, a moderate current \naccount deficit, and structural reforms to improve the business climate. Private consumption \nremained a lead contributor to GDP, followed by investment. However, Indonesia's economy \ncontracted by 2.1% in 2020 because of the significant economic disruption caused by COVID-19. \nConsumption  in  Indonesia  contracted  by  2.7%  in  2020  as  households  cut  spending  and \nbusinesses postponed investment.1 Over the medium-term, the challenge will be returning the \neconomy  to  its  pre-pandemic  growth trajectory,  while  also diversifying growth sources  and \nimproving productivity to ensure that growth is inclusive and resilient. \n \n4.  COVID-19 impact on higher education. In addition to its devastating impact on health \nand economy, COVID-19 has also disrupted education including higher education, with school \nclosures necessitating an abrupt shift to distance and online learning. Some universities with \nlimited capacity in terms of technology and tools faced problems delivering online classes.  \nStudents\u2019 and faculties\u2019 access to learning and research was also constrained by the lack of their \naccess to internet and effective online teaching materials.  \n \n5.  Persistent challenges in higher education. The higher education subsector continues \nto be affected by underfunding, which has resulted in low levels of quality, relevance, access, and \nequity. The shortage of skilled professionals in high-growth sectors and higher-than-average \nunemployment of higher education graduates in associated fields are evident. This reflects the \ndisconnect between higher education institutions (HEIs) and the economic drivers which require \ntechnological skills and relevant research outcomes. In February 2021, the Indonesian Central \nBureau of Statistics reported 6.18 million unemployed.  While the average unemployment rate for \nall levels of educational attainment was 6.26%, unemployment rate for post-secondary diploma \nholders and bachelor\u2019s degree holders were 6.61% and 6.97%, respectively.2 The labor force \n \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2021. Asian Development Outlook 2021: Financing a Green and Inclusive \nRecovery.  Manila. \n2  Government of Indonesia, Statistics Indonesia. 2021. National Labor Force Survey. Jakarta. \n ", "2 \nparticipation rate for women in 2020 remained much lower (51.89%) than for men (83.13%). \nDespite an increase in their education levels, 63.35% of female employment continue to be \nconcentrated in the informal sector, compared with 57.29% of men.3 \n \n6.  Quality issues. Access to higher education has improved, with the gross enrollment rate \nrising from 14.8% in 1999 to 31% in 2019. As of 2019, there were about 8.5 million students \nenrolled in more than 4,600 HEIs, including 122 public universities under the Directorate General \nof Higher Education of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research and Technology (MOECRT). \nHowever, quality remains a concern. In 2018, about 38% of HEIs were accredited, of which about \n4% had obtained level A, the highest level of accreditation, while 36% had attained level B and \n60%, level C.4 No Indonesian HEI was in the top 500 of the Times Higher Education world \nuniversity rankings in 2020, while only three were in the top 500 of the QS World University \nRankings.5 Quality deficits largely account for the mismatch between educational attainment and \nemployment outcomes. Lack of access to quality higher education disproportionately affects poor \nstudents. Producing better-educated health care professionals is another important prerequisite \nto  developing  a  healthy  and  productive  workforce.  This  requires  investment  and  policy \ninterventions  to  modernize  higher  education  delivery  through  revised  pedagogy,  improved \nfacilities, and enhanced human resources. \n \n7.  Need to strengthen human capital in the health sector. To improve human capital for \neconomic growth, the government has set a target of universal health coverage. The health care \nsystem requires better-trained health professionals; more hospitals, including teaching hospitals; \nmore medical schools;  and medical  research centers.6 There  are  only 21  doctors  (general \npractitioners), five dentists, 138 nurses, and 84 midwives per 100,000 people in the country, and \njust 16 general practitioners per 100,000 people in Lampung Province.7 Before the COVID-19 \npandemic, Indonesia had only 118 hospital beds per 100,000 people and 2.7 critical care beds \nper 100,000 people, which was among the lowest in 23 Asian countries.8 The rapid spread of \nCOVID-19 in Indonesia has further strained its already overburdened health system, causing the \ncountry to fall further behind its regional peers in key health indicators. \n \n8.  Capacity constraints on research and innovation. Teaching and learning approaches \nhave failed to keep pace with global trends involving active learning in which students are not \nsimply passive recipients of teaching practices. The soft skills required in the 4IR labor market \nare not well-developed in most HEI graduates in Indonesia. Physical facilities for teaching, \nlearning, and research are limited and there is a shortage of skilled and knowledgeable faculty \nand lecturers to teach specialized subjects and carry out basic, applied, and industry-responsive \nresearch. \n \n9.  Importance of technological transformation. The Government of Indonesia recognizes \nthe role of technological transformation in promoting innovation, increasing labor productivity, and \n \n3  Government of Indonesia, Statistics Indonesia. 2020.

Technological  transformation  will  play  a  critical  role  in  enhancing  Indonesia\u2019s \ninnovation capacity  and  global  competitiveness  in  the  era  of  Industry 4.0  (fourth  industrial \nrevolution  [4IR]).10  Technological transformation,  disruption,  and  innovation  are  progressing \nquickly and impacting all sectors of the Indonesian economy. At the same time, they are creating \nopportunities for higher economic growth and employment, with new and emerging types of work \nthat require better education and training.11 Most new work in high-value, technology-driven \nsectors requires high-level skills, including soft skills.12 To benefit from technology\u2019s productivity \nboost, Indonesia needs to accelerate efforts to provide the high-level skills demanded by the labor \nmarket, expand robust research to support innovation, and maintain a healthy workforce. \n \n10.  Lack of global competitiveness and innovation capacity. Indonesia is relatively weak \nin innovation. In 2019, Indonesia ranked 50th out of 141 economies in the World Economic \nForum\u2019s Global Competitiveness Index.13 Indonesia ranked 85th out of 129 economies in the 2020 \nGlobal Innovation Index that references 80 indicators for innovation, including education and \ninfrastructure.14 One of the reasons for the lack of competitiveness and low innovation score may \nbe the short supply of researchers. A 2018 comparison with Southeast Asian counterparts shows \nthat Indonesia had 216 researchers per million people, compared with 1,350 in Thailand and 708 \nin Viet Nam.15 A strengthened higher education system will increase the number of researchers \nand highly skilled workers for 4IR.  \n \n11.  Need to promote innovation in addressing vulnerability to climate change. Indonesia \nis  extremely  vulnerable  to  climate  change.16  Without  well-planned  climate  adaptation  and \ndisaster-risk-reduction  efforts,  poor  and  marginalized  communities  are  likely  to  experience \nsignificant loss and damage because of climate change. In its Nationally Determined Contribution \nunder the Paris Agreement, the government has set ambitious climate mitigation and adaptation \ngoals.17 Promoting resource-efficient development based on technological innovation is critical in \nachieving these goals. \n \n12.  Strategic alignment. Indonesia\u2019s National Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMN), \n2020\u20132024  emphasizes  strengthening  higher  education  to  support  technological  change, \ninnovation, and entrepreneurship for human capital development (footnote 9). The project is \nstrategically aligned with the government priorities of improving access to quality higher education \nin science, engineering, and health; establishing stronger collaborations with industry to increase \nthe relevance of education and research; increasing the commercialization of research; and \nstrengthening teacher quality. The project will contribute to the government\u2019s aim of expanding \nscience techno parks for teaching and research, strengthening and creating new centers of \nexcellence  (COEs),  and  creating  additional  student  spaces  through  new  and  expanded \n \n9  Government of Indonesia, National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS). 2020.

In addition to strengthening medical graduate quality, the project will provide a 100-\nbed teaching hospital, with intensive care units and wards. The project is also aligned with the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy for Indonesia, 2020\u20132024, with its \nsupport for priority areas under strategic pathway 1 (improving well-being) on strengthening health \ncare system and advancing education quality and for a crosscutting priority area of strengthening \ninnovation.19 It also supports ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational priorities of addressing remaining \npoverty and reducing inequalities; accelerating progress in gender equality; and tackling climate \nchange, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability.20 \nThe  project  modality  supports  the  government\u2019s  medium-term  higher  education  investment \npriorities, including concrete interventions to implement policy reforms that will require substantial \nfinancing. These include investments in facilities construction, equipment upgrading, and capacity \ndevelopment. \n \n13.  ITS and UNILA. Several development partners are delivering or planning higher education \nprojects in the next five years.21 To complement this support and accelerate moving more HEIs \ntoward world class university status, the government has requested support from ADB to invest \nin two public universities: ITS and UNILA. ITS is a leading public HEI specializing in science, \ntechnology, engineering, and arts. It is ranked in the top 800 of the QS World University Rankings \nand is considered a top 10 Indonesian university. The project will build on ITS\u2019 strengths in key \ntechnology areas that serve national and multinational industrial partners through highly qualified \ngraduates, research and innovation products, and industrial collaborations, leading to value-\nadded manufacturing. Its location in East Java facilitates access for students and industry in less-\ndeveloped eastern Indonesia to high-quality education and research, thus contributing to the \ngovernment\u2019s  objective  of  achieving  regional  equity.  UNILA,  centrally  located  in  Lampung \nProvince, has a functioning medical school and a strong potential to provide quality medical \neducation and research. The project support for UNILA will contribute to improved health care in \nan off-Java location and more equitable access to high-quality medical education, services, and \nresearch that will help to address regional health problems. \n \n14.  Lessons learned. Lessons from past ADB-supported projects and technical assistance, \nincluding in Indonesia, are incorporated into the project design.22 These include (i) university\u2013\nindustry links lead to market-relevant education programs and increase innovation potential; (ii) \nfocusing support on fewer institutions with cost-effective investments is likely to have greater \ndevelopment impact; and (iii) developing knowledge and research partnerships in cutting edge \nareas enhances innovation and productivity.   \n \n18  Based on MOECRT\u2019s definition, the mission of a COE is \u201cto increase the capacity and capability of institutions, \nresources, and science and technology networks of research and development institutions, including universities, in \npriority areas to increase relevance and productivity and to improve science and technology utilization in the private \nand public sectors to grow the national economy, which in turn can have an impact on increasing public welfare.\u201d \n19  ADB. 2020.

Project Description \n \n15.  The project is aligned with the following impact: human capital enhanced to improve \ncompetitiveness and productivity (footnote 9). The project will have the following outcome: quality \nand relevance of targeted HEIs improved.23 \n \n16.  Output 1: Cutting edge education and research in priority sectors delivered by \nInstitut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember. This output aims to improve the teaching and learning \nquality and research capacity of ITS in the following four specialized areas: (i) creative industry \n(including  product,  graphic,  digital,  and  interior  design;  fashion  crafts;  packaging;  and \narchitecture);  (ii)  maritime  technology  (designing  ships/vessels);  (iii)  automotive  (electric \nvehicles); and (iv) advanced information and communication technology and robotics.24 The \nproject will construct innovation centers for each of these four specialized areas, with state-of-\nthe-art  equipment  to  support  effective  teaching  and  learning  and  advanced  research  and \ninnovation. These innovation centers will be located within the existing ITS Science Techno Park \nand will contribute to, and complement, ITS\u2019s ongoing COE initiatives. The project will also \nconstruct an academic building fully equipped with classrooms and laboratories and a cultural \nand language center which will enhance ITS\u2019s international recognition.25  \n \n17.  Output 1 will boost key disciplines and thematic knowledge and pedagogical skills, including \nnew teaching and learning strategies, and improve research and innovation skills of ITS academic \nand technical staff, through (i) technical and management training programs, both national and \ninternational; and (ii) engaging ITS staff and students in one or more new programs on applied \nresearch and entrepreneurship, start-up innovation, training, and certification in the four specialized \nareas. The output will also (i) provide research and entrepreneurship grants to ITS academic staff, \nstudents, and industrial partners in key specializations to generate knowledge and innovations; (ii) \nexpand knowledge partnerships to promote applied research, entrepreneurship development, and \nstart-ups; and (iii) increase industry partnerships in skills development, research, and innovation. \nThe  project  will  promote  and closely monitor  women\u2019s  participation  in  capacity-strengthening \nprograms  and  research  opportunities  to  ensure  gender  equity.  It  will  also  address  climate \nvulnerability through climate-smart and disaster-resilient design of facilities and provide training on \nclimate-resilient and resource-efficient campus design and waste and wastewater treatment.  With \nthe project support, ITS enrollment is expected to increase by 3,621 undergraduates, 750 master\u2019s \nstudents, and 250 doctor of philosophy students during project implementation.  \n \n18.  Output  2:  Medical  education  and  research  capacity  of  Universitas  Lampung \nstrengthened. This output will support improving the quality of medical education at UNILA and \ncontribute to developing qualified health professionals in Lampung Province and its vicinity. It will \nalso support construction of a pandemic-ready teaching hospital, which will be gender-responsive, \naccessible, energy-efficient, climate- and disaster-resilient, and supplied with essential medical \nand laboratory equipment.26 It will be a type C teaching hospital, which will accommodate a broad \narray of patients, provide diverse case-types, and expand hands-on learning opportunities for \n \n23  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n24  These areas have been selected based on ITS\u2019s long-term business plan for institutional development and its strategic \nresponse to industry needs and are aligned with ITS\u2019s intention to contribute to regional and national development. \n25  All facilities to be constructed will be accessible and gender-responsive, including provision of lactation rooms, and \nhave climate-smart and disaster-resilient design. \n26  \u201cPandemic-ready\u201d hospitals have isolation wards; wards capable of quick conversion to expanded intensive care \nunit; isolation capacity to protect and care for non-pandemic patients; ventilation equipment; personal protective \nequipment;  and  World  Health  Organization-recommended  pandemic  preparedness  management  practices, \nincluding regional coordination with other health service providers and regulators. \n ", "6 \nUNILA\u2019s medical students.27 The hospital will include facilities that support health care in several \nspecialized fields, including tropical infectious diseases, endocrine and other metabolic disorders, \ngeriatrics, and rehabilitative medicine. The project will also construct a new integrated research \ncenter, physically and operationally connected to the new teaching hospital and the Faculty of \nMedicine, which will specialize in life sciences research and house multidisciplinary research \nprograms on health and life sciences.28 The research center will have five laboratories to pursue \nresearch in tropical medicine; biomolecular, genetic, and degenerative diseases; pathology and \ntoxicology; nutrition; and clinical and diagnostic trials. The laboratories will enhance the research \ncapacity of UNILA\u2019s faculty, staff, and students, and will underpin UNILA plans to develop COEs \nin one or more of the research foci. \n \n19.  Output 2 will also support capacity development of academic and professional staff from \nthe UNILA Faculty of Medicine and other faculties through longer-term internships and exchanges \nat leading domestic and international institutions, which will strengthen their knowledge and skills \nin (i) teaching and research in medicine, health, and life sciences; and (ii) managing, operating, \nand maintaining a teaching hospital and integrated research center. The training programs will \nensure  equitable  participation  of  female  staff.29  The  project  will  expand  partnerships  with \nindustries  in  skills  development,  research,  and  innovation  in  disciplines  supported  by  the \nintegrated research center. The Faculty of Medicine will partner with neighboring hospitals and \nthe local government in delivering training and contract research, and conducting clinical trials for \nlocal industry and government. With the project support, enrollment at the UNILA Faculty of \nMedicine is expected to increase by 200 from 2023 to 2026. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n20.  ADB\u2019s support builds on its long-standing and unique partnership with Indonesia in higher \nand vocational education and skills development. ADB has partnered with the government in \nsupport of policy, institutional, and systemic reforms in education involving human resource \ndevelopment, strengthening of teaching and learning, and knowledge creation (footnote 22). The \nongoing Advanced Knowledge and Skills for Sustainable Growth Project illustrates the shared \nintentions and strong collaboration between the government and ADB to support innovation and \nadvance higher education reforms.30 The project will complement ongoing and planned ADB \ntechnical assistance to support the MOECRT\u2019s digital initiatives to improve learning outcomes \nand accelerate online education in Indonesia.31 Lessons from previous projects will add value in \nterms of fostering knowledge partnerships between national and international universities and \nindustries to catalyze innovation and deliver cutting edge technology in teaching, learning, and \nresearch. ADB\u2019s extensive engagement in education, skills development, and health in Indonesia \nwill help the government achieve its human development priorities. ADB\u2019s COVID-19 Active \nResponse and Expenditure Support Program supported the government\u2019s COVID-19 response, \nparticularly in implementing urgent public health measures and expanding social and economic \nassistance.32 In the medium-term, ADB will support building a critical mass of HEIs capable of \n \n27  A type C hospital is smaller, with a minimum of 100 beds, but has greater patient case diversity than larger type B \nor type A hospitals do because of the referral system.

The government has requested a regular loan of $79.475 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have an 18-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  7.5 years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n27.  The two universities have committed to develop environmentally sustainable and socially \ninclusive campuses. The design of project facilities will adhere to safe, low-carbon, green, climate- \nand disaster-resilient, and inclusive facility design principles.35 The project will promote the \napplication  of  rooftop solar  photovoltaics  and  water  conservation,36  rooftop  greening, smart \n \n35  The design principles will be in accordance with the Ministry of Public Works and Housing Regulations No. \n14/PRT/M/2017 on Ease-of-Access Requirements to Buildings and No. 02/PRT/M/2015 on Green Buildings. \n36  Water conservation includes rainwater harvesting, stormwater retention, and wastewater treatment, and reuse. \n \n ", "9 \nfacade shading, and natural ventilation. The MOECRT, ITS, and UNILA have committed to \nallocate  sufficient  budget  and  mobilize qualified  faculty  and staff  to manage  operation  and \nmaintenance of facilities and equipment. The capacity development plan includes additional \ntraining for ITS and UNILA faculty and staff in new technology related to the project, including \ntraining in operation and maintenance of new equipment. \n \n28.  As the impact of COVID-19 is evolving, the project will be responsive and flexible in \nmeeting emerging needs and new guidelines. The project will strictly follow government guidelines \non safe working in COVID-19 conditions, adhering to the most robust medical and scientific \nadvice. Project parties will be required to incorporate emerging international best practices in \nconstruction.  These  will  include  using  forced  air  ventilation  system;  personal  protective \nequipment; and appropriate implementation methodologies, especially for work in deep trenches \nand other confined spaces where the risk of transmission is high. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n29.  The economic analysis focused on the direct benefits accruing from an increase in \nenrolled, educated, and subsequently employed graduates, in particular the higher proportion of \nhigher degree graduates and medical doctors.37 An additional 4,821 students are expected to \nenroll at ITS and UNILA, given the project interventions. The project\u2019s estimated net present value \n(using a 6% discount rate) is $172.7 million, and the estimated economic internal rate of return is \n11.1%, which is above the economic opportunity cost of investment of 6%. The financial internal \nrate of return, computed on an after-tax basis, is 16.1% against the weighted average cost of \ncapital  of  1.9%.  The  project  is  considered  both  economically  and  financially  viable  and \nsustainable. Sensitivity analysis indicates that both the economic and financial internal rates of \nreturn are robust under adverse conditions.38 Fiscal impact analysis confirms that the government \nhas adequate financial resources and will be able to fulfill its financial obligations under the project. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n30.  The central government, through the MOECRT, and ITS and UNILA have committed \nadequate counterpart financing to the project. Sources of counterpart funding for both universities \ninclude tax-free revenue from tuition and central government allocations to each institution\u2019s \nannual operating budget. Project interventions will increase the universities\u2019 nontax revenues \nbecause  of  growth  in  student  enrollment  and  income  from  expanded  research  and \nentrepreneurship activities. The teaching hospital and integrated research center at UNILA will \ngenerate new revenue streams from health services such as inpatient and outpatient treatment. \nPost-construction operational costs for the teaching hospital and integrated research center at \nUNILA will be funded by the MOECRT, UNILA, the Ministry of Health, and Indonesia\u2019s Social \nInsurance Administration Organization which administers the national health insurance. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n31.  The public financial management system in Indonesia has several important strengths \nthat will help ensure sound financial reporting and oversight. This includes an automated financial \nmanagement information system with a defined central treasury management system, consistent \naccounting and budgetary classifications, and convergence of national accounting and auditing \n \n37  The analysis did not consider benefits in other dimensions that are likely very large but difficult to precisely quantify, \nsuch as flow-on benefits in health outcomes resulting from additional trained medical doctors. \n38  Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nstandards  with  international  standards.39  The  automated  financial  management  information \nsystem enhances the transparency, credibility, and accuracy of financial information pertaining to \npublic funds. At the project level, the MOECRT, UNILA, and ITS have fully automated financial \nmanagement  systems  with  adequate  financial  reporting  and  oversight.  These  financial \nmanagement systems feature a well-developed accounting system and robust links between \nplanning,  budgeting,  and  accounting.  The  internal  audit  functions  in  the  executing  and \nimplementing  agencies  provide  independent  oversight.  The  executing  and  implementing \nagencies  are  also  regularly  audited  by  independent  external  auditors.  The  assessed  pre-\nmitigation financial management risk is moderate mainly because staff of the executing and \nimplementing  agencies  lack familiarity  with  ADB\u2019s financial  management  and  disbursement \nrequirements.  To  mitigate  this  risk,  the  project  will  (i)  engage  procurement  and  financial \nmanagement staff for the project management unit (PMU) in the MOECRT and the project \nimplementation units (PIUs) in UNILA and ITS, and (ii) conduct trainings and briefings for relevant \nPMU and PIU staff on ADB financial management and disbursement requirements. \n \n32.  Procurement of goods, works, and consulting services will be undertaken in compliance \nwith the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). A procurement capacity \nassessment concluded that ITS and UNILA have limited capacity to implement ADB procurement \nprocedures and administer construction contracts. Project management consultants will provide \ntechnical support. The project will achieve value for money by (i) using e-procurement to lower \ntransaction costs and enhance transparency; (ii) consolidating civil works into larger packages to \nattract  large,  technically  strong  contractors  to  bid  for  construction;  and  (iii)  applying  open \ncompetitive  bidding  with  international  advertisement  for  medical  and  production  equipment, \nsoftware,  and  machinery  to  attract  not  only  national  distributors  but  also  international \nmanufacturers and distributors, thereby increasing competition. \n \n33.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, ITS, and UNILA. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 34). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n34.  The government, ITS, and UNILA have taken steps to improve equity of access to higher \neducation by mobilizing their own resources and other development partners\u2019 support to expand \nscholarship programs for financially disadvantaged students. The project will equip students of \nthe two targeted public universities, including poor and disadvantaged students, with the skills to \nsecure high-quality, higher-paying jobs and income-earning opportunities. Female participation in \nhigher education and the labor market is improving, but women continue to face barriers in \naccessing  capacity-building  programs  and  research  and  entrepreneurship  opportunities  to \nimprove their knowledge and skills. This affects the share of women in the labor force and \nwomen\u2019s access to well-paid employment and job security. Prevailing gender norms and systemic \ngender barriers prevent women from achieving their full potential; affirmative action will be \nrequired to ensure equality in the job market. Only 31% of ITS academic staff are women, with a \nsmaller proportion in disciplines such as maritime and automotive technology (20%). Female \nacademic staff are also underrepresented at UNILA, accounting for less than 40% of faculty (the \nFaculty of Medicine is an exception, with 60% women). The project is categorized effective gender \nmainstreaming at entry, and a gender action plan has been prepared. Gender actions include (i) \nmaintaining the consistently high proportion of female students in the UNILA Faculty of Medicine \n \n39 World Bank. 2018.

Safeguards \n \n35.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows. \n \n36.  Environment (category B). Initial environmental examinations for the proposed facilities \nat ITS and UNILA have been conducted and the findings have been disclosed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).41 ITS and UNILA carried out meaningful consultations \nwith key stakeholders, including university staff and nearby communities. Further consultations \nwill be carried out before and during construction. Environmental management plans for the \nfacility construction have been prepared to mitigate the environmental impacts identified in the \ninitial environmental examinations, including on spoil and construction waste management, air \nquality and noise, temporary traffic management, and occupational and community health and \nsafety. It is anticipated that adverse impacts will be limited to the construction period. They will be \ntemporary and site-specific and can be readily mitigated through sound construction practices. All \nfacilities will be constructed within the existing campuses of ITS and UNILA. No significant \nadverse  impacts  on,  or  disruptions  of,  university  activities  are  anticipated  during  facility \nconstruction. The PMU and PIUs will assign qualified staff to coordinate implementation of the \nenvironmental management plans. They will be supported by environment and construction safety \nspecialists to be recruited under the project. Grievance redress committees, chaired by the PIU \ndirectors, will be established at both campuses to address project-related complaints. \n \n37.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  C).  The  project  is  classified  category  C  for \ninvoluntary resettlement, as per ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The research centers, \nacademic building, cultural and language center at ITS, and the teaching hospital and integrated \nresearch center at UNILA will be constructed on existing land located within the boundaries of \nthese two universities. There are no people using or occupying the land, and therefore, involuntary \nresettlement is not expected. Thus, preparation of a resettlement plan and social safeguard \nmonitoring report is not needed. \n \n38.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project is not expected to affect indigenous \npeoples as there are no indigenous peoples living in the project areas. The indigenous peoples \nsafeguards requirements will not be triggered by the research and partnership activities.42 \n \n \n \n40 The National Competency Test for medical certification has two components, both of which must be passed before \none can practice medicine: (i) a computer-based test (CBT) and (ii) the objective structured clinical examination \n(OSCE). Up to 2019, the proportion of female students passing the tests as first-time takers was consistently more \nthan 90%. In 2019, for example, 90.43% and 96.43% of the female first-time test takers passed the CBT and OSCE \ntests, respectively.  No tests were conducted in 2020 due to COVID-19 restrictions. \n41  Initial Environmental Examination for Institut Teknologi  Sepuluh Nopember (ITS); and Initial Environmental \nExamination for Universitas Lampung (UNILA) (both accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n42  ADB. 2009.

ASSURANCES \n \n40.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable ADB requirements, including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, financial management, and disbursement as described \nin detail in the PAM and loan documents. \n \n41.

The journals included in the index are generally deemed to be of high \nquality because of their rigorous editorial and peer reviewing processes. \nd  At least 5% of submitted papers, research and development studies, and projects will have climate content to \ndemonstrate climate awareness, understanding, and application by faculties and students.   \ne   The medical certification test of Indonesia comprises two components, both of which must be passed before one can \npractice medicine: (i) a computer-based test, which emphasizes knowledge; and (ii) the OSCE, which examines skills. \nf   Gender-responsive design elements are based mainly on the Ministry of Public Works and Housing Regulation No. \n14/PRT/2017 on Ease-of-Access Requirements to Building. The Regulation includes, among others, a provision for \nlactation rooms and separate male and female toilets. A day care center is being constructed in a nearby building \nwith non-project funds. \ng   Climate-smart features include siting away from floods, category 4-proof roof, water conservation and rainwater harvesting, \nfish fin sun shades, building automation system installation (an intelligent system of both hardware and software, which \nconnects the heating, venting, and air conditioning system with the lighting system, security system, and other systems to \ncommunicate on a single platform), use of solar photovoltaics and LED bulbs, and campus greening. \nh  The actual numbers of students and staff, type of activity, and applied field of engagement will vary with industry \ndemand and faculty and student uptake. Each faculty and student may participate more than once in more than one \nprogram. \ni     Available female students and staff refer to those in the specialized priority areas.   \n ", "16  Appendix 1 \nj   Creative industry include product, graphic, digital, and interior design; fashion crafts; packaging; and architecture. \nk  Details on the training plan and other capacity development activities are in Appendix 1 of the project administration \nmanual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \nl  Details on female staff participation in training in specialized areas are in Appendix 1 of the project administration \nmanual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The target female staff participation percentage \nreflects existing proportions of female teaching and support staff in each of the target specialized areas. \nm  \u201cPandemic-ready\u201d means having isolation wards; wards capable of quick conversion to expanded intensive care \nunits; isolation capacity to protect non-pandemic patients and provide for their care; ventilation equipment; personal \nprotective equipment and management; and World Health Organization-recommended pandemic preparedness \nmanagement practices, including regional coordination with other health service providers and regulators. \nn  As part of the applied research programs, at least one climate adaptation initiative will be designed to increase the \nresilience of Lampung Province\u2019s public health sector to climate change and variability. Health-related risks covered \nby this initiative may include heat stroke and chronic kidney disease resulting from prolonged exposure to high \ntemperatures and heatwaves; dengue and malaria; typhoid fever, cholera, leptospirosis, and hepatitis A resulting \nfrom floods and inundation; smoke inhalation from forest fires/wildfires; and trauma injuries resulting from extreme \nevents such as precipitation-induced landslides. The climate adaptation initiative will feed into initiatives of the United \nNations Development Programme Sustainable Development Goals Centers of Excellence in Indonesia. These \ncenters of excellence, composed of 50 leading Indonesian universities, integrate Sustainable Development Goals \n(SDGs) into the curriculum, conduct academic research to foster innovation to achieve the SDGs, and prepare public \npolicy papers to stimulate public discussion in seeking SDG solutions. \no  Staff from the Faculty of Science (40% female), Faculty of Engineering (26% female), and Faculty of Agriculture \n(36% female) will also be trained. \nContribution to Strategy 2030 Operational Priorities \nExpected values and methodological details for all operational priority indicators to which this operation will contribute \nresults are detailed in Contribution to Strategy 2030 Operational Priorities (accessible from the list of linked documents \nin Appendix 2). \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n ", "Appendix 2  17 \nLIST OF LINKED DOCUMENTS \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/RRPs/?id=52332-001-3 \n \n1.
