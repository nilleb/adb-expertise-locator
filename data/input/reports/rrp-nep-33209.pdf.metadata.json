The improved FMIS will intensify \nagricultural production in 25,500 hectares (ha) of existing irrigated \narea,  bring  an  additional  8,500  ha  under  irrigation  through \nimproved water distribution, and thus benefit over 270,000 poor \nmen  and  women.  Implementation  will  take  a  participatory  and \nprocess  approach,  following  the  initiatives  of  local  water  user \nassociations  (WUAs)  with  a  proven  track  record  of  having \nconstructed  FMIS  and  doing  self-sustained  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M). The process will be managed based on the \nperformance  of  the  concerned  organizations  in  achieving  the \nspecified development targets. Institutional development support \nwill aim at the effective operation of the improved participatory \nirrigation  service  delivery  mechanisms  to  support  inclusive \ndevelopment with due empowerment and livelihood enhancement \nof the poor including ethnic minorities and occupational castes \n(dalit),  and  sufficient  integration  with  agriculture  marketing \nopportunities and support services, while promoting sector-wide \npolicy and institutional reforms toward sound governance.  \n   \nRationale  In Nepal, irrigation is an essential input to improve agriculture \nproductivity,  which  remains  the  lowest  among  the  neighboring \ncountries. The 20-year Agriculture Perspective Plan (APP) that \nwas  launched  in  1995  with  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nassistance has prioritized irrigation as the foundation of a modern \nproduction system, with emphasis on improving the performance \nof traditional surface water FMIS, which account for 55% of the \ntotal irrigated area and 23% of net cultivated area of 2.6 million \nha. Many FMIS suffer from low productivity that is barely above \nsubsistence level, due to unreliable diversion and high distribution \nloss and maintenance costs caused by fragile and rudimentary \nintake  and  distribution  structures.  FMIS  offer  good  scope  for ", "iv \nenhancing productivity, expanding the command area at relatively \nlow cost, and short lead time, and building on the existing WUA \ncapacities through a participatory approach. \n  \nADB has assisted in improving FMIS since 1987 including the \nrecently completed Second Irrigation Sector Project. While project \nperformance  has  been  positive,  with  many  FMIS  yielding \nreasonable economic benefits to smallholders, there is still scope \nfor improvement in delivering maximum benefits particularly to the \npoor in the community, and enhancing WUA capacity to become \nmore  active  agents  that  can  drive  dynamic  agriculture \ndevelopment within the locality. There is need to further improve \nthe  project  design  by  ensuring  sufficient  attention,  time,  and \nresources for nonstructural activities such as empowering WUAs \nand  supporting  agriculture  and  livelihood  enhancement,  and \nsound governance of public sector institutions for monitoring and \nquality control. Essential changes in the management system and \nbehavior of public institutions to become genuine service-oriented \nfacilitators are also called for.   \n \nImproving  FMIS  productivity  is  still  a  priority  in  the  agriculture \nsector, with 0.3 million ha currently requiring urgent rehabilitation. \nHowever, a new approach is needed following the Government\u2019s \n2002 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) that committed \nitself to (i) reorientation of APP to strengthen its integrated and \ncoordinated  market-oriented  approach,  its  pro-poor  focus  with \ntargeting,  and  support  for  decentralization;  and  (ii)  reforms  of \nsector institutions for sound governance. There is a pressing need \nto operate the improved service delivery mechanisms for FMIS \nrenovation that fully address these new sector needs and the \nlessons  of  previous  assistance,  while  pursuing  policy  and \ninstitutional reforms that provide a sound basis for their operation. \nThe  Project  is  designed  to  address  these  challenges  and  is \nneeded to renovate the remaining subsistence FMIS to attain their \nmaximum sustainable benefits, particularly those for the poor and \nthe  disadvantaged,  with  sound  sector  governance.  The  sector \nloan modality is adopted in view of the Government\u2019s sound policy \nand plan framework in the sector such as APP, PRSP, and the \n2003 Irrigation Policy; and its progressively improving capacity to \nsupport FMIS renovation, building on the existing WUAs.  \n   \nObjective  The  Project  aims  to  improve  agriculture  productivity  and \nsustainability of existing FMIS suffering from low productivity and \nhigh incidence of poverty, thereby enhancing the livelihood of poor \nmen and women in rural Nepal. For this purpose, the Project will \n(i)  provide  improved  means  for  beneficiary  participation  and \nempowerment, irrigation and associated infrastructure, agriculture \nand targeted livelihood enhancement for the poor, and sustainable \nO&M by WUAs; and (ii) strengthen policies, plans, and institutions \nfor more responsive service delivery and sustained growth and \npoverty reduction impacts.

A \ncentral  project  management  office  (CPMO)  for  overall  project \nmanagement and technical backstopping will be set up in DOI \nwith staff assigned from DOI and collaborating agencies. Day-to-\nday  implementation  is  delegated  to  the  district-level \nmultidisciplinary subproject management unit (SMU) set up with \nstaff representing DOI, DOA, and LGIs, under the supervision of a \nregional  project  support  unit  (RPSU)  established  in  each \ndevelopment region. WUAs will have a major role in the process \nby monitoring and endorsing outputs such as the subproject plan, \ndesign, and quality and quantity of services provided. Regular \nSMU-WUA review meetings will be organized as major decision-\nmaking forums.  \n \nIn  addition,  the  National  Vigilance  Center  under  the  Office  of \nPrime Minister and Council of Ministers will undertake external \ntechnical audit for selected subprojects using the loan proceeds. \n   ", "vi \nProcurement  Goods and services financed by the ADB loan will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Equipment \npackages valued at $500,000 equivalent or less will be procured \nfollowing international shopping procedures. Civil works under the \nProject will comprise many small contract packages for improving \nirrigation facilities in scattered locations, and will be contracted \nthrough local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB. \n   \nConsulting Services  A team of consultants to be recruited from a firm will support \ninstitutional strengthening and project management by providing \n574 person-months of consulting services (55 international and \n519  domestic)  for  irrigation  management,  participatory \ndevelopment,  water  resources  planning  and  design,  minor \nirrigation, agriculture development planning, agriculture extension, \nagriculture  economics,  gender  and  poverty,  resettlement, \nenvironmental  management,  and  financial  management  and \naccounting.  Consultants  and  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs) will be recruited using quality and cost-based selection \nprocedures in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants.   \n   \nProject Benefits and  At full development, the Project will improve the livelihood of over \nBeneficiaries  270,000 poor men and women by renovating about 210 FMIS \ncovering 34,000 ha. The main benefits are increased agriculture \nproduction brought about by more reliable irrigation, increased \nlabor opportunities, improved nutritional status particularly among \nsmallholders  suffering from  chronic  food  deficit,  and  increased \nincomes and reduced poverty in subproject areas. The 210 WUAs \nwill have enhanced capacity to sustain improved irrigation water \nmanagement  and  better  cropping  practices.  The  economic \ninternal rate of return of three sample subprojects is 23\u201325%, due \nlargely  to  incremental  production  of  food  grains  followed  by \ncommercial crops to tap the available marketing opportunities and \nbuild on the existing cropping pattern. At the national and local \nlevels, the Project will improve service delivery systems to attain \nmaximum  benefits  and  sustainability  through  irrigation \ninterventions  with  sound  quality  control,  along  with  improved \nsector  governance  through  sector-wide  policy  and  institutional \nreforms.  \n \nSurveys conducted during project preparation estimated that 54\u2013 \n62% of beneficiary households in the three core subproject areas \nfall  below  the  poverty  line,  which  is  higher  than  the  national \naverage of 39%. The estimated poverty impact ratio for these \nsubprojects is 39%\u201351%. The social development strategy will \nfocus on prioritizing subproject selection in areas of high poverty \nincidence  with  an  ethnic  minority  population,  enhancing  WUA \ncapacity to support a socially inclusive approach of participatory \ndevelopment, empowering the poor and the disadvantaged such \nas dalit through targeted support, enhancing the role of women in \nproject  institutions  and  programs,  and  policy  and  institutional ", "vii \nreforms to improve governance while equalizing opportunities and \naccess  to  irrigation  among  the  poor  men  and  women,  and \ndisadvantaged people in the tail end.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The Project has several types of risk that could adversely affect its \neffective implementation and sustained benefits. In particular, the \nongoing insurgency poses a considerable risk.  \n \nThe Project allows flexible site selection to renovate FMIS owned \nby rural communities, using a demand-driven, participatory, and \ntransparent approach, that has proven effective in similar types of \nrural infrastructure works under insurgency. The Project is thus \ndeemed  implementable  under  conflict  situations,  with  due \nincorporation  of  coping  measures  such  as  careful  security \nmonitoring, staff training to work with insurgency, mobilization of \nstrong community support to build local trust in the project staff, \nand  a  flexible  implementation  modality  for  delivering  more \nservices  through  local  NGOs  and  consultants  less  prone  to \nconflict situations. The Project will start with operating in areas \nwith  relatively  securer  environment,  and  progressively  expand \ncoverage by establishing models that can operate in more conflict-\naffected conditions. At present, the level of conflicts in Central and \nEastern  Development  regions  covered  under  the  Project  is \ngenerally less severe than that in the other regions, particularly in \nthe terai districts.  \n \nOther possible risks are (i) WUA sustainability, (ii) interagency \ncoordination and governance, and (iii) implementation delay. To \nmitigate the first risk, the Project will discern and develop genuine \nWUA  interest,  ownership,  and  capacity  through  identification \nsurvey, facilitation support, and training while achieving specified \ninstitutional targets prior to construction. The governance-related \nrisks will be addressed by strengthening management, monitoring \nand quality control systems of the concerned institutions to ensure \nparticipation, transparency, and accountability in implementation. \nThe risk of implementation delay will be mitigated by identifying \nWUAs  with  genuine  interest  and  member  support  during \nscreening, and having a larger number of subproject at the pre-\nconstruction stage compared with the annual construction targets. \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan to the Kingdom of Nepal for the Community-Managed Irrigated Agriculture Sector Project, \nand (ii) proposed administration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of a loan to be provided \nby the OPEC Fund for International Development (OPEC Fund) for the Project.1 The project \nframework is in Appendix 1.  \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES  \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis  \n2.  Sector Description. Nepal is one of the poorest countries in Asia: in 2002 per capita \nincome was $241, 39% of the population lived in poverty, and 48% of children under 5 years \nwere chronically malnourished. Over 90% of the poor live in rural areas, and poverty is more \nconcentrated among smallholders and landless people, and among ethnic minorities and dalit \n(occupational castes at the lowest stratum of Hindu social hierarchy).2 Ethnic minorities and dalit \nrepresent 36% and 13% of the population, respectively. Agriculture contributes 39% of the gross \ndomestic product (GDP) but it plays a central role in the livelihood of the poor, providing \nemployment for over 80% of the active workforce and meeting their nutritional needs.3 Yet \nproductivity remains low and largely subsistence oriented. As to food grains that account for \nsome  85%  of  the  cultivated  land,  the  yields  of  paddy,  maize,  and  wheat  remain  at  2.7 \ntons/hectare  (t/ha),  1.8  t/ha,  and  1.9  t/ha,  respectively,  the  lowest  among  the  neighboring \ncountries. Key constraints are (i) difficult terrain conditions vulnerable to natural calamities such \nas floods and landslides; (ii) poor physical capital base such as irrigation and rural roads; (iii) \nlimited access to inputs, output markets, and financial services; (iv) low technology base and \nweak extension; and (v) insufficient governance of public institutions to deliver development \nservices to a socially diverse population particularly those who are disadvantaged.  \n3.  Since 1995, sector development efforts have been driven by the 20-year Agriculture \nPerspective Plan (APP) that was prepared with ADB assistance and formed the basis of the 9th \n5-year plan (9FYP: FY1998\u2013FY2002). The APP aimed at achieving over 4% annual growth rate \nfor food grains and higher rates for cash products by improving total factor productivity through \n(i) liberalization of input and output markets for greater private sector involvement; and (ii) \nprioritized  public  investments  for  improved  provision  of  irrigation,  seeds,  fertilizer,  finance, \nroads, and extension. ADB also played a key role by promoting reforms4 and providing lead \nexternal finance (Appendix 2). According to a recent agriculture sector performance review \n(ASPR),5 sector growth rate accelerated to 3.3% during the 9FYP period, with higher rates \nrecorded for cash crops and livestock. Yet overall performance is still short of targets and is now \naffected by the insurgency. The country remains a net importer, albeit small, for food grains. \nThere has been little change in the production mix, with the shares of food grains (34%), other \n                                                 \n1  Project preparatory technical assistance was provided under ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of \nNepal for Preparing the Community-Managed Irrigation (Central and Eastern Basins) Sector Project. Manila. The \nchronology of project development is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n2  Over 70% of landholdings have less than 1 hectare (ha) of land. While most rural households have some land in \nthe hills, up to 40% of the rural population are landless in the terai, including the majority of dalit. There are also \nlarge areas where poverty incidence is high among the larger farmers due to low land productivity.  \n3  Livelihoods of the poor are varied and complex, with increasing nonfarm incomes in recent years including those \nfrom out-migration. Yet there is evidence of a high increase in labor demand and incomes in areas of high \nagriculture growth. Daily wage labor from agriculture is also a key source of income for poor women.  \n4  Including (i) deregulating fertilizer trading and pricing, (ii) eliminating subsidies and import duties for shallow-\ntubewells, (iii) privatizing Agriculture Inputs Corporation, and (iv) rationalizing public sector role in food distribution.   \n5  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Nepal for Agriculture Sector Performance Review. Manila.  ", "2 \ncrops (27%), and livestock (29%) in agriculture GDP largely unchanged, despite opportunities \nfor producing high-value products for domestic and Indian markets in areas with good irrigation \nand road access. Thus, intensifying food grain production, and diversifying and commercializing \nagriculture remain key challenges.  \n4.  Irrigation. Due to the highly erratic rainfall pattern in Nepal, irrigation is an essential \ninput for intensifying agriculture across the year.6 Of a total cultivated land of 2.64 million ha, \nabout 1.13 million ha (43%) has access to irrigation: (i) 0.62 million ha of farmer-managed \nirrigation  systems  (FMIS)  using  surface  water,  traditionally  constructed  and  maintained  by \nfarmers; (ii) 0.27 million ha developed by the Department of Irrigation (DOI) using surface water; \nand (iii) 0.24 million ha of groundwater irrigation in the alluvial terai, a fertile plain in southern \nNepal. However, the productivity of these areas is low. The actual irrigated area against the \ndeveloped  potential  in  the  monsoon,  winter,  and  spring  remains  at  70%,  20%,  and  10%, \nrespectively.7 DOI-developed systems are even less utilized due to lack of user participation and \npoor  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M).  Many  FMIS  suffer  from  low  yields  due  to  fragile \ndiversion structures (made of earth, logs, or brushwood and frequently washed away by floods) \nand rudimentary distribution systems causing unreliable water supply, and high distribution loss \nand O&M costs. At present, urgent rehabilitation is required for over 0.3 million ha of FMIS.  \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n5.  Agriculture  Support  Services.  Following  the  APP\u2019s  market-oriented  reforms,  the \nprivate sector has shown dynamic response in marketing farm inputs and outputs. However, the \nprocess is still at a formative stage. Fertilizer use by farmers has increased by nearly 20% per \nannum in recent years after deregulation of private distribution. Yet its applied rate is far less \nthan half the levels suggested by the Department of Agriculture (DOA). Availability and use of \nimproved seeds also remain a major constraint particularly for food grains, for which few private \nagents  exist  to  supplement  the  meager  public  seed  supply.8 Mainly  due  to  expansion  of \nmicrofinance institutions (MFIs), the number of borrowers in rural finance increased nearly \nthreefold in the 1990s to reach 22% of households. Yet the MFIs' geographical outreach is still \nlimited. In output marketing, successful cases of sales chains for high-value crops are emerging \nalbeit only sporadically, linking farmers and wholesale markets. As to extension, while DOA staff \nhave technical know-how in modern cropping practices, field-level dissemination is constrained \nby lack of resources and a weak mechanisms for beneficiary participation. On the other hand, \nthere are private providers including nongovernment organizations (NGOs) delivering effective \nextension services on a contract basis. Overall, these conditions call for strategic provision of \ncritical public services, concerted efforts in facilitating the delivery of key inputs and support \nservices,  and  careful  assessment  of  the  postharvesting  marketing  opportunities.  Farmer \ncapacities also need strengthening so that they can collectively drive this process.  \n6.  Irrigation  Efforts  to  Date.  Historically irrigation has received high priority in public \ninvestments.  Initial  efforts  were  directed  toward  developing  new  and  complex  large-scale \nschemes, which suffered from poor performance due to lack of local institutions to support \neffective O&M. Starting in the late 1980s, the Government shifted its focus to participatory \nimprovement of existing irrigation systems. FMIS renovation was identified as a very attractive \nopportunity in view of the existence of farmer water user associations (WUAs) with a proven \n                                                 \n6  In a field survey in the ASPR, 51% of farmers cited lack of reliable irrigation as a major constraint in increasing \nproduction, followed by availability of improved seeds and fertilizer (11%), and lack of extension (9%). \n7  About 40% of the irrigated land has access to year-round irrigation. Water is not available in many schemes in \nsouthern terai, which have small catchment, in particular during spring (March\u2013May).  \n8  In the case of wheat, improved seed supply currently meets less than 20% of the amount required at the national \nlevel to achieve the replacement rate recommended by DOA. The rates for other food grains are lower. ", "3 \ntrack record of self-sustained O&M. Mostly small and medium in size,9 FMIS have good scope \nfor enhancing productivity and expanding the command area by resolving the aforementioned \ntechnical deficiencies with relatively low cost and short lead time. DOI in 1992 prepared the \nIrrigation Policy that set out guidelines for participatory irrigation development, and improved it \nin  1997  following  the  lessons  of  earlier  investments.  DOI's  institutional  structure  was  also \nimproved, with the establishment of an irrigation management section in its central and field \noffices  and  deployment  of  social  scientists;  however,  strengthening  the  nonengineering \ncapacities of DOI is still a future goal. ADB played a key role during this process of policy, plan, \nand DOI strengthening through assistance to three FMIS projects launched in 1987\u20131991.10 \n7.  Building on these developments, the APP further prioritized irrigation, after which ADB \nassisted the Second Irrigation Sector Project (SISP)11 to improve FMIS in two eastern regions. \nADB is also supporting groundwater irrigation development in the terai areas of the same \nregions. The World Bank has funded a similar package covering three western regions, along \nwith broad water sector institutional reforms, whereas the European Commission has supported \nFMIS renovation in selected districts in the Western Development Region (Appendix 2).  \n8.  Lessons  from  FMIS  Interventions.  ADB-assisted  FMIS  projects  have  been  rated \nsuccessful in postevaluation reports.12 Most WUAs were capable of increasing the command \narea, crop intensity, and yields, and the returns were deemed sufficient to justify investments. \nHowever, there are still notable gaps between what is realized and the potential attainable in \nprogressive farming practices. Access to extension and other inputs is often a constraint. WUAs \nare largely confined to routine irrigation O&M, despite their interest and potential to become \nuseful organizations to drive the local agriculture development process. Overall, the lessons call \nfor significant improvement in project design and further capacity development. Specifically, \ninterventions should be driven by the aim of improving water use and agricultural production as \nopposed to constructing structures, a still lasting interest in DOI. Second, strategic site selection \nis needed to tap existing postharvest marketing and poverty reduction opportunities and build on \ncoherent WUA willingness, along with careful planning, to facilitate the delivery of extension, \ninputs,  and  credit.  Third,  sufficient  resources  should  be  provided  for  nonstructural  works \nincluding agriculture programs and WUA strengthening as capable community  agents with \ncollective  bargaining  power  to  liaise  with  necessary  agriculture  service  providers.  Fourth, \nimproving overall quality control and monitoring is essential to ensure participatory processes at \nall stages. Such processes call for generic changes in the management and behavior of public \ninstitutions, from being conventional implementers to becoming service-oriented facilitators.   \n9.  In terms of poverty implications, positive impacts\u2013direct (via crop intensification) and \nindirect\u2013have been observed in the livelihood of small and marginal farmers and landless \npeople,  even  in  the  localities  of  ethnic  minorities.  The  latter  notably  (i)  had  wage  labor \nopportunities; (ii) increased livestock production (via higher fodder availability), and (iii) rented \nlands from larger farmers (who had labor shortages).13 Marginal non-irrigated areas benefited \nsignificantly  through  an  expanded  command  area.  However,  past  projects  did  not  have \n                                                 \n9  In Nepal, small schemes are defined as those having command areas of less than 25 ha in the hills and 200 ha in \nthe terai, while medium schemes have less than 500 ha in the hills and 2,000 ha in the terai.  \n10 Including the East Rapti Irrigation Project (ERIP), approved in 1987; the Irrigation Sector Project, approved in 1988; \nand the Rajapur Irrigation Project, approved in 1991.  \n11 ADB. 1996. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Kingdom of Nepal for the Second Irrigation Sector \nProject. Manila (for $25 million, approved on 16 May 1996, and completed in June 2003). \n12 Project completion reports of the three projects in footnote 10 and project performance evaluation report of ERIP. \n13 A survey in the selected SISP subprojects noted that on average, the income of marginal farmers (with less than \n0.5 ha land) increased from 40% below the poverty line before the project to 15% above after the project. Larger \nfarmers also preferred to lease their land to this group who had more manure to apply per unit of farmland.    ", "4 \nmechanisms to empower the disadvantaged groups and deliver specific services to them. There \nis a need to strengthen the commitment and capacities of sector institutions to address poverty \nagendas within FMIS projects. Appendix 3 gives the lessons learned.  \n10.  Recent  Government  Initiatives.  In  2002,  the  Government  adopted  the  Poverty \nReduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and the 10FYP (2003\u20132007), and renewed commitments for \nrural-oriented poverty reduction. In agriculture, the PRSP aims to enhance APP implementation \nwith improved service provision and governance, through stronger agency coordination, private \nsector and NGO engagement, community participation, and decentralization, in line with the \nASPR recommendations. Progressive steps were also taken following the 1999 Local Self-\nGovernance Act (LSGA) and the 2002 Decentralization Implementation Action Plan (DIAP), \nbased on which district offices of DOA were placed under the district development committees \n(DDCs).14 As to irrigation, the Government committed itself to further policy and institutional \nreforms  in  line  with  the  ongoing  water  sector  reforms,  including  the  2002  National  Water \nResources  Strategy  (NWRS).  The  NWRS  set  out  sector  goals  and  short-  to  long-term \ninstitutional  and  physical  targets,  adopting  the  principles  of  integrated  water  resources \nmanagement (IWRM) and participatory service delivery. The Government is now preparing the \nIWRM policy and a 25-year national water plan (NWP) while defining an institutional framework \nfor IWRM at national and river basin levels.15 Reforms of sector institutions such as DOI are \nalso envisaged in line with this process. Overall, however, support is needed to transform these \ninitiatives into sound sector operations.  \n11.  ADB\u2019s  Strategy.  ADB\u2019s  new  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP)  for  Nepal  was \nprepared in 2004 following the PRSP and ASPR. The CSP prioritizes investments in rural areas \nthat generate quick benefits and support the inclusive process of development. In view of large \nFMIS areas still suffering from low productivity and poverty, and of the scope for promoting \nminor irrigation that targets the poor in nonirrigated areas, the CSP recognized that community-\nbased irrigation is one of the strategic pillars for supporting rural development, along with rural \ninfrastructure,  crop  diversification  and  commercialization, and  livestock  development.  As  to \nFMIS, a pressing need now is to define and operate improved delivery mechanisms for their \nrenovation, incorporating the lessons and addressing the new challenges identified in PRSP, \nASPR, and NWRS. This objective should be pursued with necessary policy and institutional \nreforms that provide a sound basis for their operation. Addressing these tasks is consistent with \nADB\u2019s water policy, and will contribute to attaining maximum benefits from FMIS renovation with \nfurther empowered WUAs, and improved governance of public sector institutions.  \n12.  Policy Dialogues and Sector Opportunities. The Project was prepared to address the \nchallenges  with  necessary  policy  dialogues.  Specifically,  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance (PPTA, footnote 1) contributed to the drafting of the new irrigation policy, which \neffectively  incorporated  the  emerging  principles  and  lessons  including  river  basin-based \nplanning, WUA empowerment with pro-poor and gender focus, and DDC capacity development \nto support devolution, to be institutionalized under the Project. Second, with an overall vision to \nbecome a genuine service-oriented facilitator to support beneficiaries, DOI agreed to proceed \nwith due institutional reforms, with specific agendas including (i) setting out an institutional \ndevelopment strategy, (ii) preparing and carrying out action plans for improving human and \nfinancial resources management, (iii) strengthening internal quality control, and (iv) defining and \ntaking steps to devolve FMIS operations following the LSGA. Third, as a concrete step to \nimprove quality control and governance, the Government decided to establish a technical audit \n                                                 \n14 LSGA also envisages devolution of small-scale FMIS development support from DOI to DDC. The contribution of \nthe proposed Project to this direction is described in para. 38. \n15 These are assisted by the World Bank and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA).   ", "5 \ndivision in the National Vigilance Center (NVC) under the Office of the Prime Minister and \nCouncil  of  Ministers,  and  to  start  operating  technical  auditing  in  the  irrigation  and  rural \ninfrastructure sectors, with ADB assistance.16 Fourth, the Government agreed to consult with \nADB  on  continued  reforms  in  the  agriculture  and  water  resources  sector,  including  the \npreparation of the IWRM policy, its institutional framework, and the NWP. The Project has also \nstrengthened mechanisms for more effective FMIS renovation by incorporating the preceding \nlessons  for  enhancing  agriculture  growth  and  poverty  reduction  impacts  and  WUA \nempowerment, through strategic site selection that prioritizes poverty pockets and confirms \nmarketing outlets, sufficient resources for nonengineering activities with clear output targets, \noutsourcing to private providers, and improved internal and external quality control. The sector \ninstitutional analysis is in Appendix 4 and Appendix 5 gives the policy and institutional reforms \nand implementation matrix. (Sector analysis is in Supplementary Appendix B.) \n13.  Sector  Approach.  The  Project  has  been  formulated  following  ADB\u2019s  sector  loan \nmodality, based on (i) the Government\u2019s APP, NWRS, and the 2003 Irrigation Policy that form a \nsound policy framework to promote participatory FMIS improvement; (ii) the existing long-term \ninvestment plan, which is embodied in the 10FYP following the APP, and is now being refined \nas NWP while incorporating the investment schedule of the Project; and (iii) progressively \ndeveloping the sector institutions' capacity to enhance the productivity of FMIS, building on the \nexisting WUAs that will be further strengthened during the Project. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT  \nA.  Objective \n14.  The overall goal of the Project is to promote inclusive economic growth while reducing \npoverty in the rural areas of Central and Eastern Development regions.17 Its specific objective is \nto improve agriculture productivity and sustainability of existing small and medium-size FMIS \nsuffering from low productivity and high poverty incidence, and thus enhance the livelihood of \npoor men and women including ethnic minorities and dalit. To achieve the objective, the Project \nwill  (i)  provide  improved  means  for  WUA  empowerment,  irrigation  facilities,  agriculture \nextension, and targeted livelihood enhancement to build the human capital of the poor including \nwomen and traditionally neglected disadvantaged groups; and (ii) strengthen policies, plans, \nand institutions for more responsive service delivery and sustained impacts.  \nB.  Components and Outputs \n15.  The Project has two components: (i) participatory irrigated agriculture development for \nFMIS, and (ii) institutional strengthening and project management (ISPM). The output of the first \ncomponent  is  substantially  improved  agricultural  productivity  and  reduced  poverty  in  over \n34,000 ha of land (about 210 FMIS) including 8,500 ha of expanded command area,18 and \nimproved  livelihood  for  over  270,000  poor  men  and  women.  The  second  component  will \nculminate in operation of mechanisms for improved service delivery to develop productive and \nsustainable FMIS through (i) further improved irrigation policies, regulations, and plans; (ii) \nstrengthened  DOI  (in  terms  of  human  resources  and  management  capacity),  DOA,  local \ngovernance institutions (LGIs), and WUAs; and (iii) enhanced institutional linkages to deliver \nservices in coordination with NGOs and the private sector. \n                                                 \n16 ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Nepal for Strengthening Project Implementation and Quality \nAssurance. Manila.   \n17 Poverty incidence is lower in the Central and Eastern Development regions due to higher urbanization, but tracts of \nconcentrated poverty are widely found in their rural areas in particular those with low agriculture productivity.  \n18 Overall, the Project will cover 22,000 ha of FMIS in the terai and 12,000 ha in the hills and the mountains. ", "6 \n1.  Participatory Irrigated Agriculture Development for FMIS \n16.   This component will support participatory development of FMIS subprojects through a \nprocess  approach.  It  has  four  subcomponents:  (i)  participatory  planning  and  beneficiary \nmobilization,  (ii)  community-based  irrigation  and  associated  infrastructure,  (iii)  agriculture \ndevelopment and livelihood enhancement, and (iv) support for sustainable O&M.  To ensure \neffective process management, each subproject will have distinct output targets at each stage of \nthe implementation cycle, which are set as benchmarks for the next stage. The number of \nsubprojects in each district will be managed following the performance of the district-level \ninstitutions.  \na.  Participatory Planning and Beneficiary Mobilization \n17.  Participatory  Subproject  Identification  and  Planning.  The  Project  will  support \nidentification of viable subprojects and participatory preparation of comprehensive subproject \nimplementation plans (SIPs). Activities include (i) formulation of district irrigated agriculture \ndevelopment  strategies,  (ii)  information  campaign,  (iii)  subproject  screening,  and  (iv)  SIP \npreparation with feasibility studies. At the outset, the Project will prepare an irrigated agriculture \ndevelopment strategy for each district that maps out marketing opportunities, water availability, \nand poverty conditions. The Project will also organize information campaigns through DDCs, to \nwhich  interested  WUAs  will submit  requests that  are  then  screened  in  light  of  the  district \nstrategy, field assessments, and consultation with farmers including downstream users. Those \nin areas of high poverty incidence, high proportion of ethnic minority and dalit population, long-\nterm self-sustaining O&M records, and high marketing potentials will be prioritized. Finally, a \nmultidisciplinary feasibility study will be carried out for the selected subprojects to prepare a \ncomprehensive SIP, which will stipulate specific actions, programs, and input and output targets \nfor  WUA  strengthening,  irrigation  infrastructure,  agricultural  development,  and  livelihood \nenhancement for the poor and disadvantaged groups.  \n18.  Mobilization  of Water  User  Association  Beneficiaries.  The Project will empower \nWUAs to manage activities at the preconstruction, construction, and postconstruction stages. \nWUAs  will  play  effective  organizational,  operational,  resource  mobilization,  and  networking \nfunctions to facilitate input delivery and output marketing with a collective bargaining power. The \nProject will initially help WUAs participate in preparing and endorsing the draft SIP. Then, the \nProject will support the WUAs to implement the institutional strengthening plan they developed \nand included in the SIP, including (i) enrolling members and mobilizing functional men and \nwomen groups, (ii) registering, with the formation of executive committees and operational rules, \nand (iii) implementing routine O&M and minor improvement works. The Project will facilitate the \nprocess by recruiting community organizers (COs) locally. NGOs will be engaged to train COs.19 \nAt least 33% women participants are targeted for all activities, and ethnic minority and dalit will \nbe represented in proportion to their number among the subproject beneficiaries.  \nb.  Irrigation and Associated Infrastructure \n19.  After a WUA achieves the institutional development targets, the Project will support the \nparticipatory detailed design and construction of infrastructure such as diversion structures, \ncross-drainage works, improved and extended canal systems, and flood protection facilities to \nbe operated by the WUA. The detailed design will be prepared in consultation with the WUA and \nendorsed by it before finalization. Existing design standards will be revised to promote low-cost \n                                                 \n19 The Project will also engage the National Federation of Irrigation Water User Associations Nepal (NFIWUAN) and \nits chapter organizations in districts where they have sufficient resource base.  ", "7 \nand  simple  structures following  domestic  and  international  experience.  The  WUA  will  then \nprovide beneficiary contribution, mostly in the form of labor. During the process, the Project will \nsupport preparation and implementation of the resettlement plans. Completion of these activities \nwill serve as a benchmark to initiate the procurement process to implement civil works. \n20.  Local contractors will be engaged to construct key structures, while simpler structures \nand earthwork will be implemented by WUAs with the support of DOI technicians. For intensive \nconstruction supervision, supervisors will be fielded on a full-time basis. The WUA will also be \ntrained and engaged in monitoring and final confirmation of civil works done by contractors. \nInternal and external technical audit will be arranged to monitor full compliance with the contract \nand support construction quality management.  \nc.  Agriculture Development Support and Livelihood Enhancement \n21.  This subcomponent will focus on improving farmer skills in crop productivity through self-\nsustaining and self-reliant farmer groups, and developing WUA capacities to support this end. \nIts outputs will be monitored against the SIP targets for production, improved market access for \nagricultural produce, and incomes at subproject level.20 Agriculture development will take into \naccount the comparative labor productivity and the risk dimensions, main factors in farmer \ndecisions in agricultural investment. The activities will include the following, and the WUA will \nmonitor and confirm delivered services in light of the SIP specification.  \n22.  Agriculture Extension and Support. The Project will support agricultural extension \nservices in the subproject area to promote adoption of high-yielding and improved varieties of \ncrops  and  their  diversification.  The  support  will  be  provided  by  designated  Government \nagriculture extension and irrigation staff, and private sector or NGOs engaged. Activities will \ninclude (i) field demonstration and training through a farmer field school approach covering on-\nfarm water management, integrated pest management, and cropping calendar management; (ii) \nfarmer tour to most successful FMIS; (iii) training workshops; and (iv) practical research done by \nNepal Agriculture and Research Council (NARC). As part of the field demonstration, the Project \nwill  also  support  seed  multiplication  by  delivering  foundation  seeds  and  technical  support. \nWUAs  will  sustain  extension  activities  by  operating  the  cost  recovery  norms  for  the \ndemonstration inputs that will be repaid by the concerned farmers to the WUA as seed money, \nand establishing in-house extensionists within the WUA through training.21 WUAs\u2019 technical and \nmanagerial  capacities  will  also  be  strengthened  to  facilitate  improved  farmer  access  to \nagriculture  inputs  and  other  services  collectively  to  reach  better  deals  with  providers  and \nenhance their accountability to clients. \n23.  Livelihood Enhancement. To enhance development impacts for the poor, the Project \nwill provide support targeting vulnerable groups including women, the landless, and dalit, to \nassist their specified livelihood activities such as vegetable gardening. Where appropriate, it will \nalso  help  establish  linkage  between  these  vulnerable  WUA  member  groups  and  available \nmicrocredit resources such as the Rural Microfinance Development Center and its network of \nMFIs to promote group savings and deliver microcredit. Qualified MFIs will be engaged for this \npurpose. The Project will also support the delivery of technical services available at district level, \n                                                 \n20 This component will be complemented by the proposed Commercial Agriculture Development Project in the eastern \nregions, programmed in 2005. Specific synergy will be laid out in the SIP, along with the arrangements for \ndelivering non-Project supported inputs and services such as fertilizer, pesticides, improved seeds, etc.  \n21 Extension will be provided through WUA field channel groups, with demonstration plots selected from among \nmarginal farmers. From each group two members, a man and a woman, will be selected to be group leaders and \nwill be trained to serve as local extensionists. Groups will have at least 35% women, following the policy of the \nMinistry of Agriculture and Cooperatives on women\u2019s representation and participation.  ", "8 \nincluding training for income generation such as rice cum fish culture, crop processing, livestock \nraising, and cottage industries. Specific programs will be set out in the SIP with the poor groups \nwhile seeking synergy with ongoing development programs on microfinance, livestock, skills \ndevelopment,  commercial  agriculture,  and  rural  livelihoods  in  the  district,  including  those \nassisted by ADB and other sources.  \n24.  Minor Irrigation for the Poorest. The Project will demonstrate innovative minor or \nmicro  irrigation  systems,  such  as  sprinkler  and  drip  irrigation  based  on  water  harvesting, \npromoting collective efforts by the poorest people, particularly ethnic minorities and dalit. This \nactivity will be implemented as action research. With the engagement of NGOs, the Project will \nsupport (i) assessment of available experience, (ii) design of appropriate types of intervention \npackages, (iii) identification of activity areas, (iv) preparation of a participatory plan including a \nfeasibility study, and (v) pilot implementation through resource mobilization by groups. \nd.  Support for Sustainable O&M of FMIS  \n25.  Selecting FMIS with long-term records of self-managed O&M (para. 17) is a proven way \nto ensure the sustainability of renovated FMIS in past projects, to which the pursuit of lower cost \nand simple structures (para. 19) will further contribute. On top of these, the Project will operate a \nmonitoring and support system for sustainable subproject O&M and also for those completed in \nprevious projects. For new subprojects, on-the-job training will be provided to prepare and \nimplement O&M and resource mobilization plans for WUA. In addition to undertaking routine \nO&M,  WUAs  will  establish  and  increase,  as  conditions  for  subproject  selection  and \nimplementation, an emergency reserve fund to be used for nonrecurrent maintenance. For \nsubprojects completed in previous projects, a database will be set up through stocktaking on \ntheir performance and impact indicators. Starting in the year 3, the Project will support the \nrehabilitation of a limited number of completed schemes that have been damaged by excessive \nnatural disasters, following a separate appraisal procedure to be agreed upon with ADB. The \nshare of ADB funding will be phased out each year toward project completion, after which the \nGovernment will provide a regular budget to support such subprojects. \n2.  Institutional Strengthening and Project Management   \n26.  This component comprises (i) support for national-level institutional strengthening; (ii) \nproject management, monitoring, and quality control for FMIS renovation; and (iii) training of \nproject personnel and stakeholders. Consulting services will be provided for these purposes \nalong with the necessary hardware and software. \na.  Support for National-Level Institutional Strengthening  \n27.   The Project will monitor and advise on the ongoing reforms in the agriculture and water \nresources sectors while supporting practical institutional actions to improve the delivery of FMIS \noperations.  Activities  monitored  and  supported  are  shown  in  the  policy  dialogue  matrix \n(Appendix 5). For DOI, specific outputs will be improved sector governance measured by (i) \nfurther improved irrigation policy and FMIS investment plan following the project experience; (ii) \nan institutional development strategy with gender-responsive perspectives; (iii) improved staff \ncapacity development programs and management rules; (iv) improved management systems \nincluding  FMIS  planning,  design,  implementation,  quality  control,  and  monitoring;  and  (v) \nprogress in devolving irrigation operations to LGIs. While the activities to produce these outputs \nare implemented by the Government with formation of specific working groups, the Project will \nprovide consulting services to support the processes.   ", "9 \nb.  FMIS Project Management, Monitoring, and Quality Control  \n28.  The  Project  will  operate  participatory  project  management,  monitoring,  and  quality \ncontrol systems to ensure the subproject output quality. Activities will be managed through a \ncentral project management office (CPMO), regional project support units (RPSUs), and district-\nlevel  subproject  management  units  (SMUs).  As  measures  for  subproject-level  participatory \ndecision making and monitoring, the Project will support (i) regular SMU-WUA meetings to \njointly review progress and make subproject decisions, (ii) fielding of mobile teams from RPSUs \nto verify key subproject outputs, and (iii) regular RPSU-SMU managerial review meetings. \nConsultancy inputs will be provided to assist the effective operation of the mechanisms through \non-the-job training and learning. The performance of delivery mechanisms for FMIS renovation \nand other support services is also regularly monitored and evaluated against the set indicators, \nfor continuous modification and improvement during the project implementation period.  \n29.  The Project will also support external technical auditing of FMIS renovation assisted \nunder the Project, which is undertaken by NVC in liaison with the separate technical assistance \nto establish and operate technical auditing in the rural infrastructure sector (footnote 16).    \nc.  Training \n30.  The Project will provide training for institutional strengthening in various public and \nprivate institutions involved in the project activities, including training for operating staff as well \nas for institutions and trainers to impart relevant training activities.22 Such training will enhance \nskills  for  managing  participatory,  socially  inclusive  FMIS  development;  WUA  mobilization; \nresettlement;  environmental  management;  improved  design  and  construction  management; \nagriculture and social development; and quality control. The consultant team will improve the \nexisting capacity development plans of DOI while addressing issues of gender inequality and \nenabling women to effectively articulate their needs, and will arrange for and supervise training.  \nC.  Special Features \n31.  The  Project  has  several  features  to  enhance  irrigated  agriculture  development  and \npoverty  reduction  through  policy  and  institutional  reforms,  and  strengthening  participatory \nservice delivery with enhanced quality control mechanisms: \n(i)  The Project will put into operation key principles of the 2002 NWRS and the 2003 \nIrrigation  Policy,  in  particular  participatory  and  sustainable  irrigation  effectively \nintegrated with agriculture programs that have an enhanced pro-poor focus, and \npromote due representation of women and other vulnerable people in WUAs and \ndelivery of targeted support to them. The Project will be implemented with specific \ninstitutional reform actions owned by DOI to fully implement those principles, by \npursuing improvement in staff resources, skills, and management capacities. \n(ii)  The Project will promote irrigated agriculture development by preparing district-level \nstrategies  and  subproject-level  comprehensive  agriculture  development  plans  to \naddress  local  production  and  marketing  constraints,  to  be  implemented  with \nmonitorable  targets.  The  Project  will  also  establish  self-sustaining  extension \nmechanisms within WUAs by developing in-house extensionists, and applying cost \nrecovery norms in extension programs to carry on generations of demonstrations. \n                                                 \n22 For this purpose, the Project will support development of training programs provided through the designated \ninstitutions, e.g., concerned divisions of DOI and DOA, Nepal Staff College, and Nepal Engineering College.  ", "10 \n(iii)  The  Project  will  improve  quality  control  mechanisms.  Its  internal  quality  control \nsystem will ensure that when subprojects are implemented, there will be progressive \nachievement of the predefined targets at each step, and in line with the absorptive \ncapacity of the local institutions. The system's operation is further scrutinized through \nregular external technical auditing by NVC. \n(iv)  The Project will empower WUAs to progressively take on implementation roles while \ntransforming the line agency roles to facilitation and technical support. WUAs are \nentrusted to endorse key subproject decisions, monitor the delivered service quality, \nand implement the increasing number of civil works within their enhanced capacity. \nWUAs are further trained to facilitate farmer communication with service providers, to \nreach better deals collectively, and to improve provider accountability.   \nD.  Cost Estimates  \n32.  The total project cost is estimated at about $38.6 million equivalent, of which $12.8 \nmillion (33%) represents the foreign exchange cost and $25.8 million equivalent (67%) the local \ncurrency cost (Table 1), including taxes and duties of $5.5 million.

Financing Plan \n33.  ADB will provide a loan equivalent to $20.0 million from its Special Funds resources to \nfinance about 52% of the total project cost. The ADB loan will finance $8.4 million equivalent \n(66%) of the foreign exchange cost including interest charge and $11.6 million equivalent (45%) \nof the local currency cost. The OPEC Fund is requested to finance about 18% of the Project \ncost. The ADB and OPEC Fund will jointly finance the irrigation and associated infrastructure \nsubcomponent, and the latter will finance $4.1 million (32%) of the foreign exchange cost and \n$2.9  million  equivalent  (11%)  of  the  local  cost.  The  Government  will  provide  $9.4  million ", "11 \nequivalent to cover about 24% of the total project cost, comprising $0.3 million equivalent (2%) \nof the foreign exchange cost to cover the interest charge for the OPEC Fund loan and $9.1 \nmillion equivalent (35%) for project staff, taxes and duties, and part of the construction. The \nbeneficiary farmers will contribute $2.2 million equivalent (6% of the project cost) in the form of \nlabor, cash or in kind. The financing plan is in Table 2.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n34.   Organization and Management. The Ministry of Water Resources (MOWR) will be the \nExecuting Agency, and will carry out its Project implementation responsibilities through DOI. \nWithin this framework, the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MOAC) will implement the \nagriculture  component  through  its  delegated  authority  to  DOA,  DDCs,  and  NARC.  Project \nmanagement will be integrated into the regular setup of those organizations. The CPMO is set \nup  under  the  director  general  (DG)  of  DOI.  A  qualified  class  I  senior  engineer  having \nmultidisciplinary  experience  and  skills  will  head  the  CPMO  as  project  director,  with  staff \nassigned from DOI, DOA, Water and Energy Commission Secretariat (WECS), and Department \nof  Local  Infrastructure  Development  and  Agriculture  Roads  (DOLIDAR).24 The  CPMO  is \nresponsible for facilitating technical support and managing project implementation at the central \nlevel. Activities facilitated include (i) endorsing district strategies, SIP, and detailed design; (ii) \nmanaging databases such as the FMIS inventory; (iii) imparting national-level training; (iv) \nmanaging environmental issues; and (v) implementing relevant policy and institutional actions. \nFor project management, the CPMO will (i) manage an overall implementation plan, annual \nwork plans, and budgets; (ii) maintain financial accounts; (iii) prepare periodic progress reports; \n(iv)  monitor  and  support  field  operations;  and  (v)  supervise  cross-cutting  issues  including \ngender, indigenous peoples, and resettlement. Outside the CPMO, NVC will undertake external \ntechnical auditing of the project works. The organization chart is shown in Appendix 7.  \n35.  To provide overall policy guidance and undertake necessary coordination, a project \nsteering committee (PSC) will be formed.25 The secretary of MOWR will chair the PSC, which \n                                                 \n23 If the OPEC Fund loan is not available by 15 July 2005, the Government and ADB will agree on reductions in the \nscope of work sufficient to cover the shortfall.  \n24 Including a full-time class II DOI engineer; a class II DOA extension specialist; five class III DOI officers assigned \nfor planning, design, irrigation management, environment, and land issues, among others.   \n25 The PSC will include MOAC; Ministry of Finance; Ministry of Local Development; Ministry of Women, Children, and \nSocial Welfare; MOWR, National Planning Commission; WECS; NARC; and the relevant departments including \nDepartment of Hydrology and Meteorology. ADB staff and ISPM consultants will be invited as observers.  ", "12 \nwill meet at least once a year, with the project director as member secretary. The project \nappraisal committee (PAC) will be set up to approve individual SIPs. The DG of DOI will chair \nthe PAC, with the director of Agriculture Extension in DOA, all deputy DGs in DOI as members, \nthe team leader of the ISPM consultants as adviser, and the project director as secretary. In \naddition, a stakeholder group will be established to coordinate and exchange information on \nsector reforms and programs supported by external funds. The group will be chaired by the DG \nof DOI and include members of the PSC, external funding agencies, National Federation of \nIrrigation Water Users Associations, Nepal (NFIWUAN), and relevant research organizations. \n36.  At the regional level, the RPSU will be placed in each Regional Irrigation Directorates \n(RID) of DOI, with assigned staff from RID and Regional Directorate of Agriculture (RDA). The \ndirector of RID will head RPSU as project manager for the concerned region. The RPSU will be \nresponsible  for  (i)  managing  individual  subproject  implementation,  annual  work  plans  and \nbudgets with reporting from the SMU on cost estimates, tenders, and contract variations; (ii) \ncontrolling  subproject  quality  through  monitoring,  support,  and  verifying  implementation  by \nfielding mobile RPSU teams comprising its staff and ISPM consultants (and staff assigned from \nDOI offices, private service providers, and NGOs as needed to supplement human resources);26 \n(iii) supervising resettlement and environmental management with ISPM consultants; and (iv) \nrecruiting private service providers and/or NGOs for preparing SIP and undertaking resettlement \nand social mobilization activities, while liaising with the CPMO for their respective activities.  \n37.  For day-to-day subproject implementation, an SMU will be established in each district. \nThe chief of the concerned irrigation development division or subdivision (IDD/IDSD) will head \nthe SMU as subproject manager of the district. For districts where no IDD/IDSD exists, another \nIDD/IDSD staff member will be assigned as deputy subproject manager and work full-time for \nthe SMU. The SMU will also be supported by an agriculture development officer in the District \nAgriculture Development Office (DADO), a managerial representative from DDC, and other \ndepartments relevant to the activities included in the SIP. 27 The SMU will undertake all the field \nactivities of the Project from subproject identification to monitoring of completed schemes, by \nmobilizing and supervising the staff of the concerned public and externally contracted agents \nincluding private service providers, NGOs, and contractors. They will also organize regular \nSMU-WUA meetings for joint decision making and monitoring of project activities.  \n38.  Support for Devolution of FMIS Development Operations. The LSGA envisages the \ndevolution of FMIS interventions to LGIs. The new 2003 Irrigation Policy has acknowledged that \ndevelopment works for small FMIS will be the responsibility of LGIs.28 However, necessary \nhuman resources and capacities in DDCs and its district technical offices (DTOs) are still in a \nformative stage,29 and DTOs still cannot meet the procedural and output requirements of the \nProject. New roles and relationships between DOI and DDC/DTO are also required for quality \ncontrol, technical backstopping, and capacity development. As a step to promote the devolution \nprocess, the DDCs with small feasible FMIS will be responsible for implementing those under \nthe Project, once the necessary irrigation implementation team can be formed. The Team will \ncomprise a class II or III engineer and overseers in the DTO irrigation section, who may be \nassigned by IDD/IDSD from their staff, with DDC concurrence, along with an account officer and \na social mobilizer. Implementation will be supervised by the SMU subproject manager. The \n                                                 \n26 Three mobile teams will be formed in each RPSU: two for planning, WUA strengthening, and other support \nservices, and one for implementing civil works. \n27 An administrative staff and accountant will also be assigned to the SMU to keep track of all project activities and \nexpenditures by all agencies on a weekly basis, which will be used as a basis for reimbursing the expenditures.  \n28 Most of FMIS taken up under the SISP were medium-scale, i.e., more than 25 ha in the hills and 200 ha in the terai.   \n29 DTO, responsible for rural roads, water supply, and other infrastructure, has up to 10 staff positions in each district. \nExisting staffs are mostly seconded from DOLIDAR, and there are many vacancies.  ", "13 \nconcerned  DDCs  will  enter  into  a  project  agreement  with  MOWR  to  delineate  specific \nimplementation arrangements. On the other hand, DDCs lacking human resources may request \nDOI to undertake small FMIS subprojects on their behalf. Based on the initial implementation, a \ndevolution action plan will be prepared at midterm review (MTR) and will be operated thereafter.  \n39.  As for agriculture extension, DADOs have been placed under the DDCs following the \n2002 DAIP, along with other services. Thus, district-level programming, implementation, and \nexpenditure authorities are delegated to DDCs. While the SMU will design and arrange for the \ndelivery  of  agriculture  extension  and  other  services  through  the  existing  DADO  and  other \nsubject matter offices, the DDC will take due roles in this process in accordance with the \nframework of LSGA and DAIP,30 with DOA doing technical backstopping and quality control. \nThe concerned DDCs  will also enter into a project agreement with MOAC.  Overall, these \narrangements will be further assessed and refined during project implementation.   \n40.  Subproject Selection and Implementation. Subproject selection criteria are given in \nAppendix 8. The key criteria are a high proportion of smallholder-operated land, self-sustaining \nO&M records, enrollment by the majority of farmers, economic viability, and minimal negative \nenvironmental  and  social  impacts.  Priority  is  given  to  areas  of  high  poverty  incidence. \nImplementation procedures are in Appendix 9, and details are in Supplementary Appendix D. \nThey follow the steps for (i) identification, screening, feasibility study, and SIP preparation by \nSMU for PAC approval;31 (ii) WUA institutional development and signing of implementation \nagreement  after  WUA  achieves  the  set  targets;  (iii)  WUA  beneficiary  contribution  and \nconstruction works managed by SMU and certified by the RPSU; (iv) agriculture and livelihood \nsupport arranged by the SMU; (v) postconstruction O&M training arranged by the SMU and \nprogram completion confirmed by WUA; and (vi) postcompletion monitoring by WUA and the \nSMU. NGOs, COs, and private service providers will be engaged to support the process.  \n41.  Governance and Anticorruption. Good governance is a critical element for ensuring \ninclusive FMIS renovation while delivering and sustaining intended benefits. Strengthening the \nservice delivery and management capacity at line agency, DDC, and WUA levels, and using a \nparticipatory approach will ensure transparency and accountability. Subproject activities will be \nendorsed  by  WUA  and  overseen  by  the  CPMO  through  the  RPSU  and  its  mobile  teams \nincluding ISPM consultants and individually recruited monitors, with full disclosure of subproject \nexpenditures  at  DDC  and  WUA  notice  boards.  WUAs  will  be  informed  of  their  rights  and \nresponsibilities, including monitoring of delivered program quantity and quality\u2013an approach that \nhas proven effective in ensuring work quality in SISP\u2013and the grievance communication system \nto the concerned DDC and RPSU to redress any problems encountered at field level. The \nProject  also  provides  consulting  services  to  support  and  oversee  stringent  financial \nmanagement  systems  at  CPMO,  RPSU,  SMU,  and  DDC  levels,  based  on  the  financial \nmanagement  assessment  made  during  the  PPTA.  Furthermore,  external  and  independent \ntechnical  auditing  by  NVC  will  oversee  and  advise  on  technical  and  financial  quality  at \nsubproject identification, planning and design, implementation, and O&M stages.   \n2.  Implementation Period \n42.  The implementation period will be 7 years, starting from April 2005 (Appendix 10). For \neffective dissemination of improved arrangements, the Project will start with a cluster of up to \nfive districts in each region, where sample subprojects will be selected and prepared with on-\n                                                 \n30 There are currently no elected representatives in DDCs since July 2002 when the terms of elected officials expired \nand new elections were cancelled. At present LGI and line department representatives perform DDC functions.    \n31 Initially, SIPs will be submitted to ADB for approval. Once it has been established that SIPs have achieved the \ndesired level of quality, they will be retained in the CPMO for use by ADB during review missions. ", "14 \nsite training of SMU staff in the cluster. After SIP is prepared and WUA is strengthened there, \nRPSU will start the same process in the next cluster. Seven clusters will cover all the districts. \n3.  Procurement \n43.  Goods and related services, and civil works to be financed from the ADB loan will be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. 32 As contracts are expected to \nbe  very  small,  international  contractors  are  not  likely  to  be  interested  and  international \ncompetitive bidding will not be required. Equipment and materials as well as service vehicles \npackaged and valued at less than $100,000 equivalent may be procured by direct purchase \nprocedures. Civil works will be procured through local competitive bidding.33 Simple civil works \ncontracts costing less than NRs2.5 million (about $33,000) may be awarded to the concerned \nregistered  WUAs.  Contractors  must  have  satisfactory  postqualification  records  that  will  be \nannually updated by RID. Indicative contract packages are shown in Appendix 11.  \n4.  Consulting Services \n44.  The Project will require consulting services for improved subproject management with \non-the-job training, technical support, and support for quality control. A total of 55 person-\nmonths of international and 519 person-months of domestic consulting services will be acquired \nthrough  a  firm.  The  terms  of  reference  are  outlined  in  Appendix  12  and  detailed  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  E.  The  consultants  will  be  selected  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging \ndomestic consultants, through quality- and cost-based selection procedures. The Government \nwill undertake advance action in recruiting consultants. The Government has been advised that \napproval  of  advance  action  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the  Project.  In  addition,  the \nservices of NGOs, COs, and private firms and individuals are required to carry out project \nactivities  including  district  irrigated  agriculture  strategies,  participatory  rapid  rural  appraisal, \nfeasibility  studies,  SIP  preparation,  WUA  mobilization,  construction  supervision,  agriculture \ndevelopment and livelihood enhancement activities, support for O&M processes, resettlement \nmanagement, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E). Technically qualified domestic service \nproviders will be engaged, using selection procedures acceptable to ADB.  \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n45.  The Government will establish two project accounts at the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) \nafter the loan agreement becomes effective: one for agriculture extension and research, and the \nother for irrigation and other development support. Proceeds from the ADB loan funds will be \nmaintained in a separate bank account with NRB and will only be used to pay ADB's share of \neligible project expenditures. Funding for irrigation will be channeled into the project operating \naccounts for CPMO, RPSU, and SMU for subprojects implemented by the SMU, and into the \naccounts for DDC (through the district development fund) for small subprojects implemented by \nDDC. Funding for agriculture will be channeled into the project operating accounts for DOA, \nNARC, RDA, and DDC (through the district development fund).  \n46.  ADB funding of the Project will be periodically disbursed from the ADB loan account into \na subaccount of the project account for irrigation, which will operate as an imprest account for \nthe ADB funding. The imprest account will be managed by DOI/CPMO in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (January 2001), and detailed arrangements agreed to by \n                                                 \n32 Nepal\u2019s Public Works Directive for procurement procedures was reviewed by ADB and found acceptable.  \n33 Civil works contracts costing $50,000 or less will be awarded on a post-facto review basis. ", "15 \nthe Government and ADB. The initial amount of the loan proceeds released to the imprest \naccount will not exceed 6 months of estimated expenditures and not more than 10% of the total \nloan amount. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures (SOE) procedures will be used for reimbursing \neligible expenses and liquidating advances from the imprest accounts for individual payment \ntransactions not exceeding $50,000. Direct payment procedures will be used for expenditures \nincurred in contracts for consulting services.  \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n47.  DOI/CPMO will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify the goods \nand services financed from the loan proceeds, the financing resources received, expenditures \nincurred for the Project, and the use of local funds, in accordance with generally accepted \naccounting principles. The project accounts and related financial statements will be compiled by \nDOI/CPMO and audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. The annual audit \nwill include the audit of the imprest account and SOE procedures, and a separate audit opinion \non the use of the imprest account and SOE procedures should be included in the annual audit \nreport. The audited accounts, audit report, and related financial statements will be submitted to \nADB not later than 9 months after the close of the fiscal year to which they relate. The CPMO \nwill also prepare and submit quarterly progress reports. A project completion report will be \nprepared and submitted to ADB within 3 months after physical completion of the Project. \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n48.  Project  performance  M&E  will  be  carried  out  by  the  CPMO.  The  M&E  system  will \ncomprise (i) subproject-level baseline data collected during SIP preparation and kept in the M&E \nsection  of  DOI;  (ii)  implementation-related  monitoring  of  subproject  preparation  and \nimplementation status, collected and reported by SMU and managed by RPSU and CPMO; and \n(iii) postcompletion impact data, to be collected and reported by WUAs and maintained in the \nM&E section in DOI. The system will establish a set of monitorable indicators including the \nimpacts disaggregated by gender, ethnicity, caste, landholding size, and tenancy status. WUAs \nwill be trained to monitor their performance, which will be verified by the concerned IDD/IDSD \nduring the performance audit. Within this framework, the CPMO will improve the management \ninformation system with the support of ISPM consultants within 1 year of loan effectiveness, \nwhich  will  be  consistent  with  a  participatory  and  gender-sensitive  performance  monitoring \nsystem in ADB. (The outline framework is in Supplementary Appendix F). The CPMO will \nprepare  and  submit  annual  benefit  monitoring  reports  to  ADB.  A  detailed  study  will  be \nconducted to review project progress before the MTR. The CPMO will complete an impact \nevaluation study in preparing the project completion report. \n8.  Project Review \n49.  ADB will review the Project at least twice a year. The regular project reviews will assess \nthe performance of DOI and other institutions with respect to the Project; implementation of the \npolicy and institutional action plans, loan covenants, and gender action plan; and physical \nprogress of project implementation. A comprehensive MTR in year 3 will evaluate (i) project \nprogress including design, stakeholder participation, quality of SIP, WUA strengthening, design, \nconstruction, and agriculture and livelihood enhancement services; (ii) economic, social, gender \nand environmental impacts and management; (iii) effectiveness of the project management and \nimplementation arrangements; (iv) progress on policy and institutional actions enumerated in \nthe policy matrix; and (v) future implementation plan and targets. Appropriate adjustments to the \nproject design and implementation arrangements will be made as necessary. ", "16 \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic Impacts \n50.  At full development, the Project will rehabilitate 25,500 ha of low-productivity FMIS and \nirrigate an additional 8,500 ha of previously rain-fed land. About 270,000 people will benefit from \nimproved livelihood. The main quantifiable benefits will be the incremental agriculture production \nbrought about by a more reliable water supply during the monsoon season and the expanded \nwinter  and  spring  irrigated  area.  The  generated  incremental  labor  demand  will  particularly \nbenefit the poor. Major quantifiable benefits are shown in Appendix 1. Non-quantifiable benefits \ninclude operation of sound service delivery systems for FMIS renovation and improved sector \ngovernance promoted through sector-wide policy and institutional reforms. \n51.  Economic  and  financial  analyses  were  carried  out  for  three  sample  subprojects  to \nevaluate  the  returns  on  project  investments  (summarized  in  Appendix  13  and  detailed  in \nSupplementary Appendix G). The Harinmari subproject in Mahottari District in the terai covers \n255 ha while the Talkharka and Inglakhola subprojects in Ilam District in the hills cover 210 ha \nand 178 ha, respectively. All have year-round irrigation opportunities in the basin, and cropping \nintensity is expected to rise to around 200% when some 70% of land in winter and 30% in \nspring will be irrigated, in light of the existing cropping pattern and farmer willingness survey.34 \nThe estimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 23% for Harinmari, 24% for Talkharka, \nand 25% for Inglakhola. Sensitivity analyses to test the impacts of a range of risks including \nadverse changes in investment costs, output prices, and yields showed that project returns are \ngenerally robust. The greatest risk appears to be reduction in price of cereal crops in Harinmari, \nbut even in this case a drop of 35% in the price of food grains will still produce an EIRR of 12%. \nB.  Household and Poverty Reduction Benefits \n52.  The Project will have direct positive poverty reduction impacts on income, employment \nopportunities including those for tenant farming (arising from labor constraints experienced by \nlarger farmers), and food security. According to the socioeconomic survey, poverty incidence in \nthe three subproject areas is 54\u201362%, with the national ethnic minority population accounting for \nthe majority of beneficiaries cutting across all farm size categories.35 Anticipated per hectare \nincremental incomes for small farmers are in the range of 60\u201380% of without the Project levels. \nDistribution  analysis  indicates  that  the  poor  may  attain  a  total  of  about  39\u201351%  of  direct \nbenefits. They will also have greater food security, i.e., the percentage of food grain production \nagainst house consumption for small farmers will improve from 90\u2013165% to 150\u2013240% in the \nirrigated area, and from 45\u201380% to 130\u2013145% in the currently rain-fed area.  \nC.  Gender and Social Strategy  \n53.  In irrigation systems, access to water is closely related to the social context and power \nstructures. Differential access reflects existing social relationships, in terms of caste or ethnicity \nand gender. While physical FMIS improvements give an opportunity to establish equal rights to \nirrigation water use through collective works, this has not received due attention. This is due to \nthe subordination of strengthening WUAs to construction work, with the erroneous assumption \nthat physical improvement will induce the necessary user capacity to manage the renovated \n                                                 \n34 Expected impacts in terms of changes in cropping pattern, intensity, and yields were cross-checked with those \nobserved in FMIS in previous projects. Comparable levels were assumed for the purpose of the economic analysis. \n35 Most farmers are near poor if not poor, with less than 20\u201330% having a net income more than double the calorie-\nbased poverty line (equivalent to $0.4 per capita per day), and are vulnerable to calamities.    ", "17 \nsystems. In addition, poverty has forced male migration and created new challenges in the \ndistribution of water use rights. The Project will promote new approaches to more equitable \nresource distribution and modification of gender relations. They include (i) policy measures to \nequalize opportunities and access to irrigation; (ii) increase in WUA capacity to promote good \ngovernance  such  as  representation,  participatory  decision  making,  and  equitable  benefit \ndistribution; (iii) specific actions and programs that target women and disadvantaged groups; \nand (iv) compliance with social safeguard measures before initiating any construction work.  \n54.  Since women make up the bulk of farm labor with a decision-making role in family \nagriculture  activities,  the  role  of  women  in  WUAs  will  be  enhanced  to  maximize  irrigation \nbenefits. The Project will focus on complementarity and reciprocity between men and women, \nidentifying barriers that may negatively affect women\u2019s ability to interact as equal partners. In \nline  with  the  2003  Irrigation  Policy,  the  Project  will  (i)  promote  at  least  33%  women\u2019s \nparticipation in WUAs; (ii) assist DOI, DOA, and DDC to implement a gender action plan;  (iii) \nrequire all training activities to have a session on gender issues; (iv) strengthen linkages with \nthe Department of Women\u2019s Development and DADO for WUA training; (v) facilitate gender \nmainstreaming activities by establishing gender focal points; (vi) require all data to be gender-\ndisaggregated; and (vii) request NGOs to have 50% women field staff. Appendix 14 gives the \nsummary poverty analysis and social strategy and Appendix 15, the gender action plan. \nD.  Resettlement \n55.   In accordance with ADB procedures for sector lending, three sample subprojects were \nstudied to assess land acquisition and resettlement needs of the Project in renovating FMIS.  A \nresettlement framework (RF) and sample resettlement plans (RPs) were prepared (summarized \nin Appendixes 16 and 17, with full documents in Supplementary Appendixes H and I). by the \nGovernment, following ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement and other social safeguards policies. \nSubproject implementation will generally require the use of land for widening and expanding \ncanals, although the scope is limited due to strip acquisition. Under the Project, the RF will be \nfollowed, and all affected persons will be entitled to compensation for land taken for the purpose \nof the project interventions, for their lost assets; and incomes at replacement cost to improve or \nat  least  restore  their  pre-project  living  standards,  income  levels,  and  productive  capacity. \nExisting social practices, however, show landowners voluntarily contributing the canal land in \nFMIS construction in recognition of benefits such as priority access to irrigation water and \nincreased land price, against the insignificant impacts. Voluntary contribution may therefore be \nconsidered an acceptable option when agreed to by the concerned persons and confirmed by a \nthird party. The RPSU will supervise RP preparation and implementation by the concerned \nSMU, with support from the ISPM consultants and NGOs.  \nE.  Indigenous Peoples \n56.  Indigenous peoples issues were found insignificant in the three sample subprojects, \nwhere  the  beneficiary  group  comprises  an  ethnic  local  majority  but  a  national  minority. \nPreparing  indigenous  peoples  specific  actions  was  not  deemed  necessary.  The  Project  is \ndesigned to be inclusive as it targets areas with high percentages of ethnic groups. Where small \ndisadvantaged ethnic or caste groups are identified, ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples will be \napplied and will build on the organizational model of each ethnic group\u2019s FMIS. Safeguards for \ninclusiveness  include  subproject  selection  criteria  that  will  require  the  WUA  management \ncommittee to constitute the same proportion of its social profile as the population of the WUA or \nlarger. The feasibility study of the sample subprojects shows it unlikely that the project will have \nany negative impacts on ethnic minorities. However, sample indigenous peoples specific actions ", "18 \n(IPSA)  was  prepared  as  a  precautionary  measure  that  will  be  integrated  in  the  SIP \n(Supplementary Appendix J). \nF.  Environmental Impacts \n57.  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  carried  out  during  the  PPTA.  The \nsummary IEE is in Appendix 18. (The IEE is in Supplementary Appendix K.) The Project will \nhave overall beneficial impacts, enhancing agricultural production while reducing pressure on \nthe environment through reduced use of wood products for temporary structures. Potential \nnegative impacts identified include (i) reduced water availability to the downstream water users \nand  ecosystems,  and  possible  conflicts  among  water  users;  (ii)  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement; (iii) induced erosion and landslides along the canals; and (iv) impacts associated \nwith  increased  use  of  agrochemicals,  and  of  irrigation  water  that  may  cause  waterborne \ndiseases. These impacts will be mitigated by (i) avoiding subprojects that affect downstream \nusers or ecosystems through basin water assessment and user consultation; (ii) operation of \nagreed upon RF; (iii) slope protection with the bioengineering approach or avoiding schemes in \nlandslide zones; and (iv) promoting environmentally sound agriculture practices and hygiene \neducation. Under the Project, an IEE will be prepared for each subproject, and any short-term \nnegative  impacts  will  be  mitigated  following  the  environmental  management  plan \n(Supplementary Appendix L).36 \nG.  Risks \n58.  The Project has several risks that could adversely affect effective implementation and \nsustainable benefits. It has incorporated mitigating measures to the maximum extent possible. \n59.  Insurgency. The ongoing insurgency presents a considerable risk. However, the Project \nhas incorporated such specific measures that have proven effective in pursuing development \nworks in conflict environments: (i) flexible site selection following local conditions; (ii) careful \nsecurity  monitoring  with  staff  trained  to  work  with  insurgency;  (iii)  improving  community \ninfrastructure supported by genuine WUA interest, while mobilizing strong community support to \nand trust in the project staff; (iv) fully participatory and transparent implementation including \ndisclosure of financial information; (v) incorporating specific programs for ethnic minorities and \ndalit in the livelihood enhancement subcomponent; and (vi) increasing service delivery through \nlocal NGOs and consultants less vulnerable to conflicts. The Project will also start operating in \nareas  with  a  relatively  more  secure  environment  and  expand  coverage  while  establishing \nmodels  that  could  operate  in  more  conflict-affected  conditions.  Nevertheless,  seriously \nworsening local conflicts (that would essentially affect all development programs) may still \ndisrupt the project activities and affect subproject implementation period and benefits, although \ncore subprojects have demonstrated robustness with delayed benefits.37 \n60.  WUA Sustainability. Ensuring WUA sustainability is critical to maintain benefits through \neffective O&M. Some WUAs may become less active when the routine maintenance needs \n(such as frequent repair of diversion works) are reduced after structure improvement. Their \ncapacity to cope with specific maintenance needs that arise may be affected. To address this \nrisk, the Project will select viable WUAs having a proven track record for sustained O&M, and \nprovide due capacity strengthening support for routine O&M and for their development from \nroutine maintenance groups to viable community agents to pursue agriculture development, i.e., \n                                                 \n36 IEEs will be attached to SIPs and submitted to ADB for review and endorsement at the initial stages. Once the \nquality of IEEs is confirmed, they will be retained in CPMO for use by ADB during review missions.  \n37 They remain economically viable with full benefits delayed by over 7 years (Appendix 13). ", "19 \nto promote efficient water use and improved cropping practices while facilitating the linkage to \nexternal service providers and marketing agents with collective bargaining power.  \n61.  Interagency Coordination and Governance. Delivering quality services with effective \ninteragency coordination and governance is critical in sustaining project benefits by WUAs. This \nwill be addressed by strengthening the management, monitoring, and quality control systems of \nthe project institutions, and the participatory approach to project planning and implementation. \nInteragency  coordination  will  be  attained  through  district  SMUs  comprising  the  concerned \nagency representatives who plan and manage the designated activities embodied in SIPs. \nProvision  of  individual  services  will  be  jointly  decided  in  regular  SMU-WUA  meetings  and \nmonitored by WUAs, under supervision by the RPSU and the ISPM consultants. The Project will \nalso apply external technical audits to monitor and advise on the quality of service.  \n62.  Implementation Delay. The Project may face implementation delay due to the lower-\nthan-expected performance of the field-level activities, including WUA development that may be \ndifficult to manage from outside, due to the demand-driven and self-help nature of the process. \nTo cope with the risk, the Project will identify WUAs with genuine interest and proven capacity \nfor sustained O&M, and will have a larger number of subprojects at the preconstruction stage \ncompared with the annual construction targets.  \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n63.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n(i)  The Government will undertake all time-bound policy and institutional actions as \nspecified in Appendix 5, agreed upon with ADB.  \n(ii)  The Government will ensure that all subprojects meet, to the satisfaction of ADB, the \nselection criteria and implementation arrangements and procedures as specified in \nAppendixes 7\u20139 and as agreed upon with ADB during appraisal. \n(iii)  If  cofinancing  by  OPEC  Fund  has  not  been  obtained  in  a  timely  manner,  the \nGovernment will adjust the scope and costs of the Project in agreement with ADB. \n(iv)  By the end of year 2 of loan effectiveness, the Government will have established a \nsufficient regular budget to support the rehabilitation of completed FMIS damaged by \nnatural disasters beyond the scale envisaged within the design return period. The \nGovernment will ensure that the share of ADB funding will be phased out each year \nstarting from 50% in year 3 of loan effectiveness and reduced by 20% in year 5 and \nin year 7, respectively, with farmers' contribution fixed at 20% of the construction \ncost.  DOI  will  ensure  that  the  fund  will  be  allocated  on  the  basis  of  sufficient \nmatching fund provided by the concerned WUA from its emergency reserve fund.   \n(v)  The Government will ensure that land acquisition and resettlement activities are \nimplemented  in  accordance  with  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations  of  the \nGovernment, and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995), and the agreed-\nupon RF and RP (Appendixes 16 and 17). DOI will not approve any subproject \nunless the concerned RP as required has been submitted to and approved by DOI \nand ADB. DOI will not award any contract unless the RP has been fully implemented.   \n(vi)  The Government will ensure that adequate environmental mitigating measures are \nincorporated into all subproject design, construction, operation, maintenance and \nmonitoring arrangements in accordance with (a) Environmental Policy of the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (2002),  (b)  the  Government's  environmental  laws  and ", "20 \nregulations,  and  (c)  subproject  specific  environmental  assessment  and  review \nprocedures and arrangements agreed with ADB. DOI will ensure that IEEs will be \nincluded in the subproject feasibility study reports. When IEE requires preparation of \nan  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  report,  such  EIA  report  should  be \nendorsed by DOI and submitted to ADB for concurrence before subproject approval, \nwithout which no subproject will be approved by the Government.   \n(vii)  Where  issues  related  to  indigenous  peoples  are  identified  during  project \nimplementation and subproject preparation, DOI will ensure that ADB\u2019s Policy on \nIndigenous  Peoples  will  be  closely  followed  and  the  measures  indicated  in  the \nindigenous peoples specific actions agreed upon with ADB is integrated in the SIPs.   \n(viii)  The Government will ensure (a) achievement of at least 33% representation by \nwomen  in  WUAs  on  average,  (b)  implementation  of  the  gender  action  plan  in \nAppendix 15, and (c) due representation of disadvantaged groups (ethnic minorities \nand dalit) in WUAs in accordance with the FMIS household distribution.   \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n64.  In addition to the general conditions, the Government will have established the CPMO \nand appointed the key staff before the loan becomes effective. \nC.  Conditions for Withdrawals from the Loan Account \n65.  No withdrawals from the loan account will be made until the Government will have \nentered into a contract with the ISPM consultants, except for the expenditures for equipment \nand supplies, training, survey, monitoring, and project management required to prepare for \nproject implementation. No disbursement for/to DDC for their eligible expenditures will be made \nuntil  a  project  implementation  agreement  (DDC  agreement)  or  alternative  arrangements, \nacceptable to ADB, are established between MOAC and the concerned DDC for the agriculture \nextension  component,  and  between  MOWR  and  the  concerned  DDC  for  small  FMIS \nrehabilitation that is implemented by the DDC.   \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n66.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve  \n(i)   the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 13,615,000 to the \nKingdom of Nepal for the Community-Managed Irrigated Agriculture Sector Project, \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement \npresented to the Board; and  \n(ii)   the administration by ADB of a loan not exceeding $7,000,000 to the Kingdom of \nNepal  for  the  Community-Managed  Irrigated  Agriculture  Sector  Project  to  be \nprovided by the OPEC Fund for International Development (OPEC Fund) under the \nterms of a Letter of Agreement to be entered into between ADB and the OPEC Fund. \n \n Tadao Chino \nPresident \n26 October 2004 ", "  Appendix 1  21 \nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \nPerformance  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Monitoring Mechanisms \nIndicators/Targets   \nSector/Area Goal       \n        \n \nPromote inclusive economic growth  \u2022 Poverty incidence in rural  \u2022  National and district \nand reduce poverty in the rural  households in subproject areas  statistics on \nareas of Central and Eastern  is reduced by over 15%.  agriculture, incomes, \nDevelopment regions.  \u2022 Farmers having 0.25\u20130.5 ha of  and HDIs \n  land achieve over 100% food  \u2022  BME reports \n \nself-sufficiency on average.  \u2022  GLE progress reports \n\u2022 Livelihood of poor ethnic or  \u2022  Gender and \ncaste groups improves,  ethnicity/caste \ndemonstrated by better HDIs.   differentiated district \n\u2022 Similar interventions are widely  baseline surveys \nreplicated, thereby accelerating   \nagriculture growth, confirmed \nin district-level statistics. \nPurpose/Objectives       \n       \nEnhance agricultural productivity  Following results achieved in  \u2022  BME reports  \u2022  Political conditions \nand sustainability of existing FMIS,  subproject areas by 2015, with  \u2022  National statistics  remain conducive. \nthereby enhancing the livelihood of  individual subproject targets fixed  \u2022  Project progress and  \u2022  Project institutions are \npoor men and women by:  in SIPs and monitored:  completion reports  willing to strengthen \n(i)  Cropping intensity increases  \u2022  Consultants\u2019 reports  FMIS improvement. \n(i) Providing improved measures for \nWUA mobilization, infrastructure,  by 40%.   \u2022  GLE progress reports  \u2022  WUA are willing to \nagriculture development and  (ii)  Annual cereal, potato, and    strengthen institutional \ntargeted livelihood enhancement  cash crop production    basis while managing \nto build the human capital of the  increases by at least 51,000    the facilities effectively. \npoor including women and  t; 33,000 t, and 14,000 t.    \u2022  WUA are willing to \ndisadvantaged groups and other  (iii) Gross margin per farm family    adopt modern cropping \nsupport services; and   increases by 70%.     patterns.  \n(iv) Permanent employment in-   \u2022  Damages from natural \n(ii) Strengthening policies, plans,  creases by 3.3 million days.    disasters are manage-\ninstitutions and operational  (v)  Annual family income of    able, or timely \nmechanisms for more responsive  landless farm laborers in-   rehabilitated.  \nservice delivery and sustained  creases by over NRs2,000.     \nimpacts.           \n   Following institutional  \u2022  Project progress and   \nperformance achieved:   completion reports  \u2022  Political conditions \n(i)  Individual outputs for institu- \u2022  Consultants\u2019 reports  remain conducive. \ntional actions (Component/  \u2022  DOI database of  \u2022  Project institutions are \nOutput B.1.) are operated.   completed schemes   willing to strengthen \n(ii) Improved FMIS support  \u2022  Evaluation reports by  systems for FMIS \nsystem is operated.  independent agents  improvement. \n \n(iii) DOI capacity is established to  \u2022  WUA are willing to \nexecute 4 FMIS subprojects  strengthen institutional \nper district at a time.  basis adopting new \n(iv) DOA and DDC are capable of  cropping practice. \nproviding due services in  \u2022  Necessary system is \neach FMIS subprojects.  operational to monitor \n(v) WUA are functioning  performance.  \neffectively to enhance  \u2022  Leadership and support \ncommunity livelihood, with  within and outside DOI. \nincreased women and \nethnic/caste representation. \n(vi) DOI prepared, endorsed, and \nimplemented policy on \ngender and development. \n \nContinued on next page ", "22  Appendix 1 \nPerformance  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Monitoring Mechanisms \nIndicators/Targets   \nComponent/ Output       \nA.

The key institutions associated with promoting the development of farmer-managed \nirrigation systems (FMIS) in Nepal include (i) Department of Irrigation (DOI) under the Ministry of \nWater Resources, (ii) Department of Agriculture (DOA) under the Ministry of Agriculture and \nCooperatives, (iii) local governance institutions (LGI) such as district development committees \n(DDCs) and village development committees (VDCs), (iv) water user associations (WUAs), and \n(v) private sector and nongovernment organizations (NGOs). Under the recently completed \nSecond Irrigation Sector Project (SISP), DOI played a lead role in implementation, responsibility \nfor agriculture extension went to DOA, and WUAs acted as recipient of services. The role of \nLGIs  remained  nominal,  given  the  relatively  recent  process  of  devolution,  which  was \npromulgated in the 1999 Local Self-Governance Act (LSGA). Consulting services were used for \ninstitutional capacity strengthening, and monitoring and quality control of selected FMIS.  \n \n2.  DOI.  DOI  is  responsible  for  planning,  implementing,  and  monitoring  and  evaluating \nirrigation projects. Under the director general are four technical divisions (planning, design, \nmonitoring and evaluation; surface water irrigation; irrigation management; and groundwater \nirrigation) at headquarters and five regional irrigation directorates (RID). Under RID are 26 \nirrigation development divisions (IDDs), 20 irrigation development subdivisions (IDSDs), and 29 \nunit offices in districts with no IDD or IDSD. Each RID is headed by a class I regional director \nand has 17\u201320 professional staff including a socioeconomist and an agriculture officer. IDD \n(headed by a class II subdivisional engineer) and IDSD (headed by a class III engineer) have \nabout 18\u201320 and 9\u201310 professional staff, respectively, including one or two association officers \nresponsible for social mobilization. Overall, DOI has a total of 1,930 posts. About 42% are \nnonprofessional officers.  \n3.  In FMIS interventions, IDDs/IDSDs are in charge of day-to-day implementation under the \nsupervision of RIDs, while DOI takes on technical backstopping and overall management. At \nfield level, engineering capacities for planning and implementing infrastructure are generally \nsufficient. However, nonengineering staff and skill are insufficient for WUA social mobilization.1 \nThere is also a need to operate effective mechanisms to ensure that IDDs/IDSDs (i) undertake \nsufficient participatory activities in planning and implementation, including the supervision of \ncontractor works; and (ii) coordinate with district agricultural development offices (DADOs) for \ndelivering agriculture programs. RIDs also need to be provided with sufficient resources to \nproperly supervise IDD/IDSD activities. There is a tendency within DOI to take constructing \nstructures as the objective, rather than achieving agriculture production targets by facilitating \nfarmers' efforts. \n \n4.  DOA. DOA has five regional directorates of agriculture (RDAs) and 75 DADOs in each \ndistrict. Each DADO has 5\u20137 agricultural service centers and an additional 5\u20137 agricultural \nservice subcenters, which provide extension services in the field. DADO is headed by a class I \nchief officer and has one agriculture development officer (class II) and eight subject matter \nspecialists (class III). DADO delivers specific crop promotion programs that last about 2\u20133 years \nin each location. In general, the staff have sufficient technical know-how on modern cropping \npractices, but their orientation and skills in social activities including forming farmer groups and \ndelivering and effectively disseminating services are generally insufficient. Monitoring also need \nstrengthening to ensure due service delivery to targeted farmers. \n                                                 \n1  IDDs/IDSDs have only 1\u20132 association officers to cover 2\u20133 districts. Their incentives (currently ranked in the \nlowest non-gazetted class) and recognition within the office need upgrading based on performance.  ", "  Appendix 4  29 \n5.  LGIs. The 1999 LSGA defines the structures, functions, and operating mechanisms of \nLGIs. The LSGA stipulates that DDCs will take over district-level development activities of line \nagencies by setting up sectoral units to work under DDC supervision (with the line agencies to \ntake on regulatory functions, technical backstopping, and macrolevel sectoral programming). \nFollowing the Decentralization Implementation Action Plan (DIAP) in January 2002, DADOs \nwere placed under the supervision of the concerned DDCs, although DDCs have been playing \nonly nominal roles to date.2 Decisions have also been made to establish district technical offices \n(DTOs)  to  cover  rural  roads,  small-scale  irrigation,  rural  water  supply,  and  other  district \ninfrastructure. Yet approved DTO staff members are still limited to 7\u201310 in each district and are \nmostly  seconded  personnel  from  the  Department  of  Local  Infrastructure  Development  and \nAgriculture Roads (DOLIDAR), and some 300 posts are vacant. \n \n6.  Private  Sector  Organizations.  Government  technical  staffs  generally  lack  skills  to \nhandle social preparation activities such as group formation and participatory interventions. On \nthe other hand, private sector providers including NGOs and community organizers (COs) are \neffective  in  facilitating  group  processes  involving  target  groups  such  as  women  and  poor \nhouseholds in a number of development works. There are also NGOs and private sector agents \nproviding  agriculture  extension  services.  In  the  irrigation  subsector,  DOI  engages  private \nconsultants for feasibility studies, designs and construction supervision; however, service quality \nis  not  necessarily  up  to  standard  and  calls  for  adoption  of  more  upgraded  and  low-cost \ntechnology effectively integrated with agriculture and social planning. In general, NGOs, COs, \nand other private sector agents, particularly those locally based, may not have the required \nskills, but their capacity can be built through training from national-level NGOs and consultants. \n \n7.  WUAs. WUAs are informal farmer irrigator groups that have evolved over generations, \nsince constructing irrigation facilities by mobilizing their own resources. Typical groups regularly \nelect leaders, hold meetings, and have working rules and water-sharing arrangements. They \nhave a proven track record of sustained operation and maintenance (O&M), and have the \ncapacity to do the same for the renovated FMIS. As farmers, they are also interested in getting \nessential inputs and necessary extension services. While WUAs are registered in DDCs when \nFMIS assistance is provided, most remain routine maintenance agents only, and some tend to \nbe less active where O&M requirements declined after structure improvement. There is scope \nfor sufficiently training them so that they can effectively liaise with input providers and marketing \nagents with collective bargaining power. Their capacity also needs strengthening to meet the \ninterests of the poor and vulnerable groups such as women.3  \n \nB.  Institutional Arrangements and Strengthening under the Project \n8.  The Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy and the 10th Five-Year Plan (2003\u20132007) \nhave  emphasized  rural-oriented  poverty  reduction  with  improved  service  provision  and \ngovernance through stronger agency coordination, community participation, private sector and \nNGO engagement, and decentralization. The institutional arrangements of the Project will follow \nthese  principles  in  promoting  effective  FMIS  renovation.  Necessary  policy  and  institutional \nactions will also be pursued. Consulting services for institutional strengthening and project \nmanagement (ISPM) are provided to implement the improved arrangements. \n                                                 \n2  There are no elected representatives in LGIs since 2002 after expiration of the terms of the elected officials and \ncancellation of new elections. While DDCs have delegated authorities for district-level planning, implementation, \nand expenditure, they are passed on to DADOs that continue to operate with linkage to the RDAs and DOA.  \n3  WUA federations have also been formed at the national level and in some districts with international NGO \nassistance. These federations take on active roles in information dissemination and WUA training, and as a lobby \nto monitor and promote effective FMIS program operations. ", "30  Appendix 4 \n \n9.  Field-Level Implementation. Existing public organizations have institutional constraints \nin  staff  resources,  skills,  and  arrangements  for  (i)  agency  coordination,  (ii)  WUA  social \nmobilization, (iii) participatory service provision, and (iv) monitoring and quality control. The \narrangements envisage implementation to be driven by the interest to improve FMIS agriculture \nproductivity as opposed to constructing structures, while transforming public agencies from \nimplementers to genuine facilitators. Specific measures include the following:  \n(i)  Coordination. In each district, a subproject management unit (SMU) will be formed with \nthe  assigned  staff  of  IDD/IDSD,  DADO,  and  DDC,  to  plan  and  supervise  the \nimplementation  of  subprojects.4 At  the  outset,  the  SMU  will  prepare  a  concise  but \ncomprehensive subproject implementation plan (SIP) that specifies individual programs \nincluding their schedules, institutional responsibilities, and output targets.5 The SMU will \nengage private firms to prepare SIPs using inputs provided by specialists (in IDD/IDSD \nand DADO) that the SMU designates as available, and through a consultative process.  \n(ii)  WUA social mobilization. Activities following the work plan in SIP will be facilitated by \nlocal community organizers (COs) engaged by the SMU. Local NGOs will be engaged to \ntrain and support the COs. WUA federations at the national and district levels will be \nengaged to take on the NGO roles as appropriate, with capacity development support. \nBuilding on their routine O&M roles, WUAs will also be trained to facilitate delivery of \nagriculture inputs and services to drive the local agriculture development process.  \n(iii)  Participatory implementation. Services are provided following the SIP and subproject \nwork plans prepared by SMU. To ensure participatory processes, WUAs will endorse the \nSIP and periodic work plans including detailed design. For irrigation works, WUAs will \nimplement simple structures with technical support by IDD/IDSD staff, and will be trained \nto monitor contractor works for complex structures. For agriculture and other programs, \nprivate sector or NGOs will be engaged to address constraints in DADO and IDD/IDSD.  \n(iv)  Monitoring and quality control. The SMU will regularly hold progress review meetings, \ninviting WUAs that monitor the delivered services. For quality control purposes, the \nregional project support unit (RPSU) will field mobile teams including ISPM consultants \nto verify the key field outputs such as SIP. RPSU will also monitor SMU operation \nthrough regular management review (with SMU staff) and office inspection.6 Along with \nthese, an external technical audit will be undertaken through the National Vigilance \nCenter.  \n \n10.  LGI Roles and Capacity Strengthening. Institutional arrangements for the Project will \nstrengthen  the  roles  and  capacities  of  LGIs  in  particular  DDCs  to  implement  the  LSGA. \nSpecifically, DDCs will (i) arrange information campaigns to its members and WUAs, (ii) screen \nand submit WUA subproject requests to the SMU, (iii) participate in preparing the SIP and \nperiodical work plans, and (iv) include those plans in the district development plans and annual \nplans. Steps are also taken to progressively devolve small-scale FMIS interventions to DDCs \nthat have formed viable irrigation implementation teams with the support and supervision of the \nSMU and capacity development support provided by ISPM consultants (para. 38, main text). \nServices such as agriculture extension, which were devolved to DDCs, will be provided through \n                                                 \n4  This follows the arrangements proven effective in other ADB-assisted projects for livestock development and \ncommunity-groundwater development.    \n5  This will include specific arrangements for the delivery of non-Project assisted services such as fertilizer and \ncertain varieties of improved seeds.  \n6  This will ensure that subprojects taken up in the SMU are in line with their absorptive capacity, and in accordance \nwith the stipulated procedures.  ", "  Appendix 4  31 \nsubject matter offices in DDC such as DADO (which engages private sector agents and NGOs), \nbut DDCs will exercise their due authority under the DIAP to program and execute the services. \nThe  ISPM  consultants  will  provide  capacity  development  support  to  DDCs  and  DTOs  by \nproviding  orientation  and  on-the-job  training  for  the  specific  responsibilities.  District-level \ninstitutional arrangements will further be assessed and refined during project implementation to \nfurther advance the Government\u2019s devolution programs.  \n \n11.   National-Level  Policy  and  Institutional  Development.  The  Project  will  support \nnational-level  policy  and  institutional  improvement  for  operating  improved  FMIS  renovation \nmechanisms. Specifically, the Project will advise on the ongoing reforms in water resources and \nagriculture, and assist in practical actions to improve FMIS development operations within DOI. \nSpecific actions are given in Appendix 5.  \nC.  Impacts of Conflicts and Coping Measures \n12.  The ongoing insurgency poses a sizable risk that may delay project implementation. It is \nnot  possible  to  predict  the  location  and  timing  of  conflicts,  and  the  type  of  violence  and \ninsecurity.  There  are  also  uncertainties  regarding  the  attitudes  of  the  insurgents  although \ndevelopment activities to enhance the livelihood of the local population, particularly the poor, are \ngenerally supported and implemented in conflict-affected areas with the assistance of several \naid  agencies.  Improving  community-based  irrigation  infrastructure  falls  under  this  category, \nwhere they are managed and driven by WUAs with genuine local interest. \n \n13.   Under insecure conditions, some Government and LGI staff may face security risks as \nthey may be seen as representing security forces. They often are reluctant to travel away from \ndistrict headquarters. Movement of Government vehicles is also restricted, since they are often \nsubject to attack. The impacts can be mitigated by engaging persons who can work safely under \nsuch environment, e.g., locally accepted NGOs and private service providers, in lieu of the \nconcerned Government/LGI staff for field-level implementation activities. However, subproject \nplanning and quality control activities may still be affected, as they need more competent \ntechnical and social capacities limited to central based NGOs and consultants, who are more \nvulnerable under conditions that lack security.7 \n \n14.  To cope with the insurgency, the project design allows flexible subproject selection \nfollowing local conditions. It also envisages taking an approach that has proven effective in \nconflict  environments,  i.e.,  community-driven  and  transparent  approach  that  holds  project \ninstitutions accountable to local communities. The Project will initially operate in areas with a \nmore secure environment; it will focus on staff training and progressively establish a model that \ncould operate under conflict situations, while duly incorporating measures effective in conflict \nenvironments, such as (i) intensive security monitoring, (ii) training project staff to work in \nconflict situations, and (iii) building strong trust in the project staff through close communication \nwith the local communities. Should serious conflicts arise in any area, the Project will apply a \nflexible approach by modifying the implementation arrangements and engaging local NGOs and \nprivate service providers in lieu of affected Government or LGI staff, and pursue appropriate \nalternative measures to implement activities beyond the capacities of these local NGOs and \nconsultants,8 in consultation with the concerned community. On the basis of initial experience, \nthe Project intends to expand the areas of operation in more conflict-affected areas. \n                                                 \n7  The Government and centrally based consultants undertook preparatory fieldwork with the support of the local \nWUA representatives under the presence of some insurgents (in areas under UN security phase 3).   \n8  Examples include (i) strengthening the capacity of local NGOs and private providers, (ii) taking up smaller and \nstraightforward schemes, and (iii) establishing an environment where central-based agents can provide services.

Those  having \nprospects for promoting year-round irrigation will be accorded high priority. \n(ii)  The subproject area has relatively equal land distribution, i.e., more than 40% of the \nbenefit area is operated by marginal and small farmers (up to 0.5 hectares (ha) \nholdings in the hills and 1.0 ha in the terai), or by the smallest 70% of the beneficiary \nhouseholds. Preference will be given to subprojects with higher percentages of land \noperated by these farmers and to subprojects located in food-deficit areas.  \n(iii)  The subproject will have more than 50 beneficiary households1 and is not larger than \n1,000 ha, unless otherwise concurred in by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).2  \n(iv)  The subproject cost must not exceed $1,000/ha, unless otherwise concurred in by \nADB.  \n(v)  The farmers must have established a water user association (WUA) that has been \noperating and maintaining the concerned farmer-managed irrigation systems (FMIS) \nas confirmed by annual resource mobilization for operation and maintenance (O&M) \n(through  labor  and  cash  contribution)  and  absence  of  intra-WUA  conflicts.  The \nfarmers are willing to mobilize and contribute resources (labor, cash, or in kind) to \nimplement the subproject, as demonstrated by more than 70% of the beneficiary \nhouseholds having signed off on the subproject request with assured beneficiary \ncontribution. \n(vi)  The concerned WUA has provided up-front cash contribution of at least NRs50 per \nhectare of its command area, established the emergency fund for nonrecurrent O&M \nworks with the said contribution, and agreed and increased it annually by contributing \nan additional amount to be specified in the subproject implementation plan, but not \nless than 0.5% of the subproject rehabilitation cost.   \n(vii)  The subproject will not have any major negative environmental impacts that require \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  study,  including  any  negative  impact  on  other \nusers of the same source. Initial environmental examination has been undertaken and \napproved  after  consulting  the  beneficiaries  and  those  affected  by  the  project, \nconcluding  that  the  subproject  is  environmentally  sound  and  any  negative \nconsequences can be mitigated. \n(viii)  The subproject will not involve any land acquisition or involuntary resettlement, or \nboth. In the event that land acquisition or resettlement, or both are required for any \nsubproject,  resettlement  plans  will  be  prepared  and  implemented  following  the \nagreed-upon resettlement framework (Appendix 16) before initiating the tendering of \nthe civil works. \n(ix)  The subproject must be technically feasible, financially and economically viable with \neconomic internal rate of return of at least 15% (except as agreed by ADB but not \nless than 12%), and socially sound, requiring no or minimal involuntary resettlement. \n(x)  The  subproject  will  not  have  any  previous  experience  of  major  investment  or \nrehabilitation  supported  by  the  Government,  external  funding  agencies,  or \nnongovernment organizations within the last 15 years. \n                                                 \n1  Except for demonstration activities for innovative small-scale minor irrigation for the poorest. \n2  The Department of Irrigation (DOI) will submit the subproject implementation plan (SIP) to ADB for schemes larger \nthan 250 ha in the hills and 500 ha in the terai for information. \n ", "  38     Appendix 9 \nSUBPROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PROCEDURE \nWater User

Objective  \n1.   The economic and financial analyses assessed the three core subprojects of the Project \nin terms of (i) affordability and sustainability, and (ii) economic feasibility. For each subproject, \nthe capacity of individual farm households to bear the additional on-farm costs associated with \nthe Project was assessed. The beneficial impacts of rehabilitated irrigation schemes, and all non-\nengineering support including agricultural extension on crop profitability are weighed against the \ncapital  costs  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs.  The  results  can  be  both \nrepresentative  and  indicative  of  the  remaining  sites.  Given  the  sector  approach  in  which \nsubprojects with possibly wide variations will be selected during the implementation period, \nfinancial and economic assessment for the overall Project is not presented.  \n \nB.  Approach and Major Assumptions \n \n2.  To determine the expected direct benefits of the subprojects, quantifiable effects are \nvalued by comparing the with- and without-Project scenarios. The input-output coefficient of farm \nproduction,  including  cropping  patterns,  crop  yields,  fertilizer  usage,  and  labor  costs  was \nestimated based on farm-level surveys in the concerned subproject areas, and cross-checked \nwith the data reported in completed farmer-managed irrigation system (FMIS) projects in Nepal.1 \nAll subprojects analyzed were assumed to have an economic life of 20 years and to achieve the \nfull benefits in the third year after civil work completion. The investment and O&M costs were \nestimated based on the field survey and design data. The overhead costs including consulting \nservices, training, and administration were incorporated into the economic analysis. The analysis \nuses a world price numeraire, and economic prices for traded inputs and commodities (rice, \nwheat, maize, and fertilizers) were based on the World Bank Commodity Price Projections. The \nprices of other crops and farm inputs were derived based on the market prices in the subproject \nareas in July 2003. Labor costs were shadow-priced at 0.80.   \nC.  Estimated Benefits \n \n3.  Increased Crop Production and Associated Benefits. As a result of improved FMIS, \ncrop production is expected to increase, because of (i) reduced risk of production losses, (ii) \nexpansion of command area, (iii) increase in yields, and (iv) changes in cropping intensities. The \nfragility of diversion structures made of earth, stones, or logs is a major factor constraining the \nproductivity of FMIS during the monsoon, as the structure may not be easily rebuilt after it is \nwashed away by floods and before the subsequent dry spell. An improved canal network will \nincrease conveyance capacity and distribution efficiency, thereby allowing the expansion of the \ncommand area. Crop yields are expected to increase because of (i) more reliable water supply, \n(ii) increased use of modern inputs (induced by stable water supply), and (iii) provision of \nextension and other support services. The Project will also increase cropping intensities in areas \nwhere only one or two crops are planted per year because of lack of water in the dry season. \nWith more reliable water supply, the farmers will intensify production of staple food crops while \nexpanding cash crops in response to existing local market opportunities. In the three subprojects \n(representing some 1.8% of the estimated project area), production of total food grains, potato, \nand other cash crops is expected to grow from 1,530 tons (t), 530 t, 170 t, respectively, to 2,360 \n                                                 \n1  While the Project aims  to achieve the high potential yield levels for the concerned crops (as reported by the Nepal \nAgriculture Research Council), realistic estimates were adopted in terms of the assumed changes in input use, \nyields, and cropping intensities that are comparable to those observed in other FMIS projects (having little \nagriculture extension and other support services provided) for the purpose of the analyses.   \n ", "46  Appendix 13 \nt, 1,260 t, and 520 t. Increased crop production will lead to increased labor opportunities (by \n46,000 person-days in the three subprojects) and improved food security of the population \n(paras. 12\u201314).  \n \n4.  Reduced  Routine  Maintenance  Costs.  The  Project  will  reduce  the  annual  routine \nmaintenance costs of irrigation facilities substantially, since the existing temporary structures will \nbe  replaced  by  semi-permanent  or  permanent  structures.  The  need  for  repairing  collapsed \nsystems commonly required during the monsoon season for many FMIS will be reduced.2 \n  \n5.  Nonquantified  Benefits.  In  addition,  there  are  nonquantified  benefits,  including  (i) \nimproved FMIS planning system through district irrigated agriculture development strategies and \nindividual subproject implementation plans (SIPs); and (ii) improved irrigation and related service \ndelivery mechanism with transparent and accountable governance through empowered water \nuser associations (WUAs) and local governance institutions (LGIs), and regular application of \nexternal technical auditing. Benefits derived from strengthening policy, planning, and institutional \nframework will also have wider impacts at national and field levels. \n \nD.  Assessment of Financial Returns \n \n6.  Farm budget analysis was conducted for typical farm households in the three subproject \nareas, differentiating currently irrigated and non-irrigated areas, and small, medium-size, and \nlarge farm households.3 The gains in farm net income as a result of the Project are compared \nwith the farmers\u2019 share of investment costs (Table A13). The annual gains with the Project \nexceed the one-time investment costs for all categories of farm households. The net gain with \nthe Project (NRs10,750\u201320,740 or about $139\u2013269 per family per year) represents a 70\u201385% \nincrease in annual income on the average.4 The expected increase is higher for currently rain-fed \nareas, and reduces the income difference between the rain-fed and irrigated areas.  \n \n7.  Harinmari Subproject, Mahottari District, Central Development Region (Terai). The \nrehabilitation of the irrigation system will expand the irrigation area from 185 ha to 255 ha. The \narea is fully cultivated for paddy in the monsoon, whereas cropping is limited to some 40% and \n20%  of  the  area  in  winter  and  spring,  respectively,  due  to  water  unavailability  and  high \ndistribution loss. In winter, the cropping pattern is relatively diversified, with 40% of the cultivated \narea used for cash crops produced such as oilseeds, lentil, potato, and vegetables, whereas the \nspring crop is mostly dominated by paddy and maize, with a small fraction of land (2.5%) \ncultivated for vegetables. The area has a large market surplus of food grains sold at the nearby \ndistrict markets easily accessed through a dust road and a national road, whereas most of other \ncrops are consumed locally within the area while small amounts of potato and other cash crops \nare also marketed out individually by farmers.5 The Project will generate several benefits. First, \nwater supply in the monsoon season will become more reliable as a result of the rehabilitation, \nleading to rice yield increases, particularly in the currently rain-fed area. Second, the improved \n                                                 \n2  In addition to the labor requirements for routine O&M activities (that are reduced from the without-project level), the \nwith-project analysis included the maintenance costs corresponding to 5% of investment costs annually, to meet the \npossible future rehabilitation requirements of semi-permanent or permanent structures.  \n3  Small, medium-size, and large farmers are defined as those having landholdings of up to 0.5 ha in the hills and 1 ha \nin the terai, up to 1 ha in the hills and 3 ha in the terai, and over 1 ha in the hills and 3 ha in the terai, respectively.  \n4  As a matter of comparison, a separate project, ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Nepal for \nAgriculture Sector Performance Review. Manila (TA 3536, approved on 13 November 2000) reported that reliable \nirrigation when combined with improved seeds produces a net margin over 190% higher than nonirrigated rice in \nNepal.     \n5  In general, cereals, pulses, and potato are purchased at farm gate by merchants acting as middlemen for mills and \nother processors, whereas vegetables are generally delivered to the district markets by farm families.  \n   ", "  Appendix 13  47 \nsystem  will  increase  water  delivery  in  the  dry  season  on  additional  30%  and  15%  of  the \ncommand  area  in  winter  and  spring,  respectively,  thereby  increasing  the  overall  cropping \nintensity from 160% to 206%, a level observed in many FMIS in previous projects. The expanded \narea is assumed to have a similar cropping pattern that prevails at present. The yield levels are \nalso  expected  to  increase  with  increased  use  of  farm  inputs  promoted  through  agriculture \nextension and multiplication of food grain seed under the Project.6 As a result, the area will have \na large market surplus of potato and small surplus of vegetables.   \n \n8.  The subproject has 382 households, of which 33% are landless, 52% have a landholding \nof up to 1.0 ha, 11% with up to 3.0 ha, and the remaining 4% with 3 ha or more. Six household \nmodels were built to represent the major subgroup of beneficiaries categorized by landholding \nsize and by current access to irrigation. As shown in Table A13, all farmers will benefit from this \nsubproject,  with  an  average  annual  income  increase  of  NRs10,740  from  increased  crop \nproduction and on-farm and hired employment opportunities. All farmers can afford the required \ninvestment and O&M contributions that remain substantially lower than the incremental income.7  \n \n9.  Talkharka  Subproject,  Ilam  District,  Eastern  Development  Region  (Hills). \nRehabilitating the irrigation system will expand the irrigation area from 110 ha to 210 ha. Due to \nthe relatively high altitude, maize and millet are major crops in the monsoon season, accounting \nfor 73% of the total area, followed by cardamom and potato. Dry season cropping (excluding \nperennial cardamom) is limited to 25% of the area in winter and 4% in spring due to the limited \ncanal conveyance capacity and high distribution loss. Wheat accounts for 60% of winter cropping \nand the rest are cash crops including oilseeds, potato, and vegetables. Maize is the dominant \ncrop in spring. Due to its location in the hills with regional food deficit, the farm gate prices of key \ninputs and outputs are higher by 10\u201325% compared with those in the terai. The subproject area \nproduces a market surplus of food grains and potato sold locally. Some products such as \ncardamom are sold at district markets through a 4 km footpath and its connecting national \nhighway. The subproject will make the water supply in the monsoon reliable, inducing farmers to \nadopt more intensive agriculture. Farmer surveys indicated the profitability of irrigated potato and \ncardamom, whose area is assumed to increase by up to 5% of the net cultivated area during the \nmonsoon.  The  subproject  will  also  expand  the  irrigated  area  on  an  additional  33%  of  the \ncommand area in winter and 7% in spring. Overall cropping intensity will increase from 131% to \n170%. The assumed cropping pattern for the dry season is similar to the current situation. The \nyield levels are expected to increase with increased use of farm inputs.8   \n \n10.  The subproject has 244 households, of which 9% are landless, 35% with a landholding \nup to 0.5 ha, 19% up to 1 ha, and the remaining 37% with 1 ha or more. All farmers will benefit \nfrom this subproject, with an average income increase of NRs20,740 annually (Table A13). All \nfarmers will be able to pay for their share of the investment and O&M costs.  \n \nE.  Assessment of Economic Returns \n \n11.  Results of the economic analysis show that the economic internal rates of return for the \nHarinmari, Talkharka, and Inglakhola schemes are 23%, 24%, and 25%, respectively, and the \nnet present value (NPV) at a discount rate of 12% ranges from NRs7.6 million to NRs11.0 \nmillion. Switching values were estimated to determine the maximum levels of cost overrun, delay \n                                                 \n6  The expected yields for paddy, wheat, and maize are 2.6\u20133.2 t/ha, 2.3 t/ha, and 2.3 t/ha, respectively, whereas \nthose for other crops will increase by some 20% under irrigated conditions.        \n7  Affordability demonstrates the appropriateness of farmers' stated willingness to pay their share of the investment \nand O&M costs, which is included in the subproject selection criteria (Appendix 8).  \n8  The expected yield levels for wheat and maize are 2.3 t/ha, while those for other crops are assumed to increase by \nup to 30% under irrigated conditions.  \n ", "48  Appendix 13 \nin years to achieve the benefit targets, reduced incremental benefits, reduced incremental yield, \nand reduced food grain prices, at which the schemes will still be economically viable. Sample \nschemes remain economically viable with cost overruns of 77\u201394%, delay of 8.9\u201310.3 years in \nachieving  benefit  targets,  43\u201348%  reduction  in  incremental  benefits,  and  food  grain  price \nreduction of 35\u201386%. While the economic viability of each subproject appears robust, analysis \nindicated relatively high sensitivity to changes in price of key farm outputs. Thus, subproject \nfeasibility studies should carefully assess key output prices and their projections, using field-\nbased assessment of marketing chains and margins, and the available marketing opportunities.   \n \nF.  Poverty Impact Assessment \n \n12.  According  to  the  socioeconomic  survey,  the  poor  in  the  Harinmari,  Talkharka,  and \nInglakhola subprojects account for some 55\u201362% of the subproject population, with the national \nethnic minority population accounting for a substantial majority of beneficiaries crosscutting all \nfarm size categories. The output of the benefit distribution analysis including the poverty impact \nratio (PIR) for the three subprojects is shown in Table A13, based on the calculation for (i) \nincreased crop production; (ii) increased on-farm family and hired labor opportunities; and (iii) \nincreased construction labor opportunities, from which the NPV for farmer contribution was \nsubtracted. The PIR using the national poverty line of NRs6,100 corresponds to 39\u201351%.9  \n \n13.  The subproject will also improve food security, particularly for small farmers. On average, \nsmall farmers will increase food self-sufficiency from 90\u2013165% to 150\u2013240% in currently irrigated \nareas, and from 45\u201380% to 130%\u2013145% in currently rain fed areas in the three subproject areas. \nOnce food security is addressed, farmers have indicated their desire to grow more profitable \ncrops such as potato, vegetables, and cardamom where market conditions allow. Subproject \nimplementation is expected to provide these small farmers with opportunities to enhance their \nproductivity and diversify their crop mix.  \n \n14  Poor people will also benefit from increased opportunities for family and hired on-farm \nlabor,  and  for  sharecropping  and  tenancy  farming.  Annual  on-farm  labor  opportunities  are \nestimated to increase by of 46,000 days in the three subprojects, of which at least 15,500 days \nwill  be  hired  almost  totally  from  local  small  farmers  and  landless  people  including  dalit \n(occupational castes). Sharecropping and tenancy are prevalent in the currently irrigated area of \nthe Harinmari subproject (and observed little in its currently rain fed areas and other subproject \nareas), totaling 79 ha engaging 68 households mostly from landless and marginal farm families. \nIn general, sharecroppers pay for half the cost of inputs, provide all cultivation activities, and \nreceive four seventh of the harvest, whereas tenant farmers annually pay a fixed amount of \ngrain. The arrangements are beneficial to sharecroppers and tenants, and the subproject is \nexpected to provide further benefits to these people,10 while further expanding the sharecropped \nand tenant farming areas in the overall command areas particularly in currently rain-fed areas \nwith  benefits  to  marginal  farmers  and  landless  people;  these  benefits,  however,  are  not \nquantified in the analysis.11  \n                                                 \n9  People having less than double the national poverty line income, which corresponds to approximately $0.4 per day, \ncapture 55\u201371% of overall economic benefits.  \n10 For example, sharecroppers are estimated to obtain a gross margin of NRs11,500/ha for cultivation of paddy, which \nis expected to increase by NRs3,000 after subproject implementation. There is no notion of sharecroppers being \nlittle more than bonded laborers controlled by their landlords.  \n11 The experience of the completed FMIS projects indicate that large farmers tend to lease the land to marginal \nfarmers due to the labor constraints of the former and the availability to the latter of higher amounts of manure to \napply per unit of land.   \n   ", "  Appendix 13  49 \nTable A13: Summary of Economic and Financial Analysis \nItem Harinmari Talkharka Ingla Khola\n(Terai) (Hills) (Hills)\nCommand Area (ha) 255 210 141\n     Previously Irrigated 185 110 131\n     Previously Rain-fed 70 100 10\nHouseholds 382 243 265\n     Landless 127 (33%) 23 (  9%) 4 (  2%)\n     Small (Up to 0.5 ha in hills and 1 ha in terai) 197 (52%) 86 (35%) 171 (65%)\n     Medium (Up to 1 ha in hills and 3 ha in terai) 41 (11%) 45 (19%) 46 (17%)\n     Large (Above 1 ha in hills and 3 ha in terai) 17 (  4%) 89 (37%) 44 (16%)\nPopulation 2,100 1,327 1,696\nIncremental Net Crop Revenue (NRs) 3,380,000 4,700,000 2,860,000\nConstruction Cost (NRs) 8,890,000 12,260,000 7,850,000\nOther Costs (NRs)  6,850,000 5,640,000 3,790,000\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return % 22.7 24.0 24.7\nEconomic Net Present Value  (NRs) 8,120,000 11,045,000 7,560,000\nSwitching Values\n    Cost Overrun (%) 77 90 94\n    Benefit Delay (years) 8.9 9.5 10.3\n    Incremental Benefit Shortfall (%) 43 45 48\n    Food Grain Incremental Yield Reduction (%) 51 - -\n    Food Grain Price Reduction (%) 35 86 72\nIncremental Income per Household (NRs)\n    Landless 1,843 3,757 1,410\n    Small (Previously Irrigated/ Previously Rain fed) 10,044/10,587 8,804/11,828 7,296/9,138\n    Medium (Previously Irrigated/ Previously Rain fed) 14,663/29,312 21,480/23,179 11,004/14,954\n    Large (Previously Irrigated/ Previously Rain fed) 59,592/59,105 26,442/49,325 25,237/25,329\n    Average 10,736 20,745 11,070\nAverage Incremental Income (NRs/ha) 21,437 29,105 23,950\nProject Investment Cost Contribution (NRs/ha) 2,549 5,016 4,600\nAnnual O&M Cost (NRs/ha) 1,743 2,919 2,784\nO&M as Percent of Incremental Income (average) 8 10 12\nTotal Incremental Annual Labor Inputs (days) 20,023 15,025 11,268\nTotal Incremental Hired Labor 6,498 6,004 2,962\nCrop Production (tons)\n     Total (Without Project/ With Project) 967/1,670 680/1,341 587/1,119\n     Food Grains (Without Project/ With project) 813/1,249 361/568 360/547\n     Potatoes (without Project/ With Project) 83/ 240 277/ 630 174/ 390\n     Other Vegetables (Without Project/ With Project) 71/ 182 42/ 143 54/ 182\nPoverty Incidence  55% 54% 62%\nPIR for Poor (Less than NRs6,100/year/person) 0.43 0.39 0.51\nPIR for Near-poor (Less than NRs12,200/year/person) 0.55 0.60 0.71\nShare of Net Benefits (%)\n    Landless and small farmers 52% 16% 43%\n    Medium 20% 19% 18%\n    Large 28% 64% 39%\nPercent Land Under Sharecropping 27% 2% 4%\nNumber of Sharecropper Households 43 NA NA\nO&M = operation and maintenance; PIR = poverty impact ratio\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.\n \n ", "50  Appendix 14 \nSUMMARY POVERTY ANALYSIS AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY \n \nA.

Nepal is 142 in poverty ranking \nout of 173 countries, and the human development index (HDI) at 0.47 is one of the lowest in the region. The gender development \nindex follows the same pattern. \nThe Project covers all the 35 districts in the Eastern and Central Development regions; 11 are terai districts, 18 hills, and 6 \nmountains. Although the Central and Eastern regions have the highest HDI estimated at 0.493 and 0.484, respectively, pockets \nof poverty exist both within and across districts. While Sarlahi (0.306) in eastern terai and Sindhuli (0.310) and Rasuwa (0.192) \nbear testimony to the disparity in development, Siraha (0.323) in eastern terai has one of the highest concentrations of \ndisadvantaged occupational caste groups. Of a total population of 10.7 million in the two project regions, ethnic groups \ncomprise 3.4 million (1.7 million in each region) and disadvantaged occupational castes, more commonly called Dalit, 1 million \n(0.4 million in the Eastern and 0.6 million in the Central region).  \nThe proposed Project takes into account the enormous diversity in cultural and environmental conditions and in human \ncapabilities within Nepal, and promotes more inclusive economic growth by (i) establishing subproject selection criteria that will \nallow targeting to small and marginal men and women farmers, (ii) developing irrigated agriculture strategy in each district or \nriver basin, (iii) promoting improved coordination between agriculture and irrigation departments to maximize the benefits of \nincreased availability of irrigation water, and (iv) enhancing social development with a focus on increasing capacity to address \nissues of gender and social exclusion at all levels. The Project\u2019s implementation strategy calls for crosscutting approaches and \nsupports the Government \u2018s Tenth Five-Year Plan. Most of the poor are engaged in agriculture and live in rural areas, with the \npoorest allocating 69% of their total expenditure to food, 16% more than people at the highest income levels. Hence, the sector \nremains a major focus of the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategies.  \nProject components focus on (i) participatory irrigated agriculture development for farmer-managed irrigation system (FMIS), \nand (ii) institutional strengthening and project management. They include rehabilitating 25,500 hectares (ha) of existing \nirrigation schemes and bringing an additional 8,500 ha of land under irrigation while simultaneously (i) improving men and \nwomen farmers\u2019 access to irrigated agricultural extension services, and (ii) expanding linkages to marketing opportunities and \ncredit to improve yields. Partnership with locally based nongovernment organizations (NGOs) for mobilizing beneficiary water \nuser associations (WUAs) is expected to provide the stimuli for increased participation of women and disadvantaged ethnic and \ncaste groups, and fairer sharing of irrigation water between the head, middle, and tail end users, to foster greater system \nownership and sustainability. Based on economic and financial analyses of the three core subprojects, the net gain accruing to \na family is $165 per year, representing a 72% increase in annual income on average. Increased yields estimated at 2,360 tons \n(t) (grain), 1,260 t (potato), and 520 t (other cash crops) is expected to enhance food security, nutritional intake, and e \nemployment opportunities for poor women and men. Improved governance of WUA is expected to secure greater transparency \nand more equitable distribution of irrigation water, leading to more inclusive development. Improved performance in the \nirrigation sector is expected to have a significant impact on the economy and be decisive in reducing rural poverty.  About 43% \nof overall economic benefits are expected to accrue to beneficiaries living below the poverty line, and 60% to those living near \nthe poverty line (less than $0.4 per capita a day). \nB.  Poverty Analysis  Proposed Targeting Classification:  Targeted Intervention     \n     \nSmall farm size and poverty are linked. The poverty rate among holdings below 0.5 ha is 54%. Those classified as \u201cagricultural \nor production workers\u201d have a 54% poverty rate. Women play a major role in irrigated agriculture and this role will assume \nmore importance as increasing numbers of poor men leave their homes to seek employment elsewhere. Poverty is also high \n(52%) among larger households with 6\u20138 persons. Hill ethnic groups such as Limbu, Rai, Sherpa and Tamang common in the \nproject area have a poverty incidence of 58%. The Tharu are a terai-based ethnic group with a poverty incidence of 48%. \nPoverty is highest (68%) among the disadvantaged occupational castes (blacksmith, tailor, cobbler, and sweeper). They are \neither landless or own small plots of land around the homestead and depend on wage labor in urban areas to augment family \nincome. Household food shortages and unemployment remain major risks for the majority of the people. \nThe Project has a strong poverty focus reflected through project processes that (i) give priority to subprojects with significant \nnumbers of poor, as it targets areas that have populations with high percentages of ethnic groups; (ii) specifically engage the \npoor and disadvantaged ethnic and caste groups in targeted training programs and support; (iii) require high levels of \nparticipation and consultation of groups hitherto traditionally excluded;  (iv) undertake interventions in marginal farming areas \nthat have high incidences of poverty; and (v) mandate at least 33% women\u2019s participation in all project activities to secure more \nequitable distribution of benefits between the genders. Specific pro-poor interventions include improved irrigation infrastructure \nthat will enable poor men and women farmers to have greater access to water during winter and spring when higher value \n   ", "  Appendix 14  51 \ncrops such as vegetables can be grown. Such access will increase food security, rural incomes, and labor opportunities.  \nDemonstration pilot projects promoting nonconventional methods of irrigation such as drip and sprinkler will provide improved \naccess to water on a micro scale to poorer women and men living in marginal lands, who because of limited access to \navailable land or water, or both, are unable to benefit from the more traditional FMIS. They will have the opportunity to grow \nhigh-value crops and to improve their nutritional intake.   \nSocial mobilization support and training include agriculture extension programs specifically targeted to poor men and women. \nMechanisms for WUA organization building focus on strengthening WUA capacity to formulate necessary arrangements for \ncontinued system operation. In particular it gives attention to increase WUA capacity to manage irrigation water that is fair for \nall social groups while combining the interrelated physical (water and infrastructure), organizational (WUA rules, representation, \nand institutional structure and division of tasks) and agro-productive elements (soil, technology, input, and irrigated agriculture \nextension). \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?     Yes      No \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes      No \nThe  project  promotes  participatory  approaches  by  mobilizing  communities  through  the  organization  of  210  WUAs \nrepresentative of their communities\u2019 social and cultural diversity and of which at least 33% will be women. WUAs and groups \nwill come together formally, through registration of the organization to run FMIS in a systematic and corporate fashion. Nearly \nall interactions between men and women farmers and the Project are envisaged to take place through the WUA, including \nconstruction, design, extension, and training. The Project ensures that WUA capacity is sufficiently strengthened and provides \nfor outsourcing WUA capacity-building activities to support organizations (locally based NGOs, national NGOs, and the private \nsector). To develop the human resources of the project area, locally-based NGOs will be trained to undertake beneficiary \nmobilization activities to ensure the envisaged social and gender outputs are secured. Strategies for achieving this will be \nculture-specific, with the Project taking immediate advantage of the more egalitarian and participatory attitudes of the hill ethnic \ngroups to involve women in all project activities, yet placing slow and continuous pressure on those groups less willing to \nchange. The village development committee (VDC) is envisaged to be actively involved in the process and the community \norganizers will support men and women farmers during the project period, and continue as an independent FMIS resource after \nProject completion. The Project will support the establishment of an FMIS stakeholder group, which will include representatives \nof the ministries and departments of all concerned line agencies, external funding agencies supporting irrigation and agriculture \nextension, National Federation of Irrigation Water Users Associations Nepal (NFIWUAN), and private sector organizations \ninvolved in FMIS improvement. \nThe Project provides for participatory development specialists and a gender and poverty specialist to facilitate participatory \nprocesses at all levels. Key strategies include capability training to ensure participatory skills are developed and used through \napplied learning techniques; promotion of farmer-to-farmer learning; support to decentralization in planning, implementation, \nand follow-up of training and construction activities; and special consideration to gender mainstreaming and environmental \nmitigation in all activities.  \nD.   Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nThe Irrigation Policy (2003) requires at least 33% women\u2019s representation in all registered WUAs and provides an opportunity \nto increase women\u2019s exposure and access to irrigated agricultural technology. However, there are significant regional and \ncultural differences in attitudes towards women\u2019s participation in decision-making in the irrigation sector. This goal will be more \neasily attained in some districts than in others. Therefore, additional effort will be required in districts where the 33% \nparticipation goal has remained elusive, and higher goals can be set in others where higher participation rates are already the \nnorm. The Project will assist the Executing Agency to mainstream gender concerns in the sector by (i) strengthening the \ncapacity of the Department of Irrigation (DOI) through the provision of a local gender consultant for the 7-year project period; \n(ii) recruiting a gender specialist from NGOs/firms who will work closely with the women development officers of the Ministry of \nWomen, Children and Social Welfare (MOWCSW) and the district development committee (DDC) gender focal point to support \ngender mainstreaming activities at the district level; (iii) requesting 210 FMIS to have at least 33% women\u2019s representation in \nthe registered WUA; (iv) including gender sessions in all training activities in addition to specific gender sensitization training to \nall stakeholders including  DOI, Department of Agriculture, DDC senior and midlevel government officials involved in extension \nand field-level interaction, all WUA members, and NGOs/firms, among others; (v) including information about gender roles in \nirrigation in baseline survey of each district; (vi) undertaking three workshops\u2013two regional and one national\u2013on gender policy \ndevelopment and dialogue in conjunction with the MOWCSW, Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MOAC), National \nPlanning Commission, and  National Women\u2019s Commission; (vii) targeting at least 35% women farmers for all irrigated \nagricultural extension in line with MOAC\u2019s policy on women\u2019s representation; (viii) developing special programs for women in \nagriculture and water management with other members of the team and included in the district gender action plan to give \npragmatic guidance at the local level; (ix) ensuring at least 35% women or female centered households will have access to \nnonconventional irrigation schemes; (x) ensuring at least two decision-making positions on the WUA management committee \ngo to women in areas where there has already been progress in increasing women\u2019s participation; (xi) requiring all data to be \n ", "52  Appendix 14 \ngender disaggregated; (xii) engaging partner NGOs/firms having at least 50% women field staff; and (xiii) ensuring larger \noutreach and benefits accrue  to women farmers by recruiting at least 50% female community organizers in view of the fact that \nvirtually all association organizers are male.  \nHAS AN OUTPUT BEEN PREPARED?    Yes      No   \nA gender plan has been prepared and is covenanted (Appendix 15) \nE.  Social Safeguards and Other Social Risks \nSignificant/     \nItem  Not  Strategy to Address Issues  Plan \nSignificant/    Required \nNone \nResettlement   Not significant  Based on a survey of three core subprojects, only minimal strip   Full \n   acquisition is envisaged for widening or extending existing canals.  A \n Short \nresettlement framework (RF) was prepared to deal with the limited \nimpacts of the subprojects. Construction activities will not start until the  None \nresettlement plan (RP, containing an inventory of loss, the number of   \naffected men and women and agreed upon compensation, whether \nvoluntary/involuntary) is signed by the affected persons (APs) and \nimplemented. Preparation of the RP is part of subproject preparation, \nand its implementation will be carried out in close consultation with and \nparticipation of APs and designated WUA men and women members, \nalong with an acceptable third party witness.  \nAffordability   None  Participating men and women farmers\u2019 share in labor and cash   Yes \n  contribution is based on the principle of equity in contribution and benefit \n  No \nsharing, hence impediments to project implementation is not foreseen.  \nThe Project will take steps to ensure that the cost of credit and inputs is \nreasonable and that poor men and women farmers have equal access to \ncredit through appropriate arrangements for collateral. \nLabor  Not-significant  While the Project will increase the labor requirements to 3.3 million   Yes \n  person-days annually, of which 58% are additional female employment \n  No \nopportunities, no major impact on the labor market is foreseen.  Rather, \nthe Project will increase earning opportunities for women and men, and \nreduce the need for male migration and thus have positive impacts on \nwomen and improved family well-being. The Project will monitor child \nlabor and compliance with the international core labor standards. The \nProject will ensure equal pay between men and women for the same \nwork.   \nIndigenous  Not-significant  The Project targets areas with high percentages of ethnic groups. In the   Yes \nPeoples  three core subprojects, ethnic peoples issues were found insignificant as \n  No \n  the beneficiary group comprises an ethnic local majority but a national \nminority. Where small disadvantaged ethnic and caste groups may be   \nidentified, ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples will be applied and will \nbuild on the organizational model of each ethnic group\u2019s FMIS. A sample \nindigenous peoples specific actions (IPSA) has been prepared as a \nprecautionary measure, which will be integrated in subproject \nimplementation plans (SIPs). Safeguards to ensure inclusiveness \ninclude subproject selection criteria that will require the WUA \nmanagement committee to constitute roughly the same proportions of its \nsocial and gender profile as the population of the WUA.  \nOther Risks/  None  Potential risks include the ongoing insurgency, extortion of funds from   Yes \nVulnerabilities  Government and NGO staff by the insurgents, political instability, lack of \n  No \n  capacity of locally based NGOs, delays in the devolution process, and \ninadequate interdepartmental coordination. The Project has several \nbuilt-in safeguards: participatory planning to ensure the full participation \nof all stakeholders; WUA centrality in subproject selection, system \ndesign, construction oversight; and increased emphasis on training in \nmanagement and irrigation extension at community level. Any potential \nrisk will be addressed, as there is strong Government commitment and \nownership of the Project. \n   ", "  Appendix 15  53 \nGENDER ACTION PLAN \nThe Irrigation Policy (2003) requires at least 33% women\u2019s representation in all registered water user associations (WUAs) to \nprovide an opportunity to increase women\u2019s exposure and access to irrigated agricultural technology and extension. However, \nthere are significant regional and cultural differences in attitude towards women\u2019s participation in decision making in the \nirrigation sector. Therefore, strategies will be culture-specific, with the Project taking immediate advantage of the more \negalitarian and participatory attitudes of the hill ethnic groups to involve women in all project activities, while placing slow and \ncontinuous pressure on the more conservative groups.  \nThe Gender action plan includes the following: \n(i)  Provision of gender specialists. A local gender and poverty specialist will be employed to support all gender-related \nactivities during the Project period. Gender specialists will also be required from nongovernment organizations (NGOs) or \nfirms to help support women\u2019s participation in each district. The NGO/firm gender specialists will work in conjunction with \nthe women\u2019s development officers and district development committee (DDC) gender focal points. The consultant gender \nspecialist will develop a project gender operational strategy endorsed by the Department of Irrigation (DOI) to guide project \nstaff and stakeholders in maintaining a participatory process in the irrigation sector.  \n(ii)  Women\u2019s representation in WUAs. Part of the social mobilization process will include bringing women\u2019s participation rate \nup to at least 33% as required by DOI for all registered WUAs. Since a WUA must be registered to participate in the \nProject, the 33% rate should become the norm. This in itself will be insufficient to ensure a meaningful role for women, so \nthe Project will also have a target of women not only being members of the WUAs, but having roles in the leadership as \nwell. Therefore, the gender specialist will provide gender sensitization training to WUA members, and leadership training to \nwomen to facilitate their increased and more active participation in WUA activities. \n(iii)  Gender training. The gender specialist will organize capacity development training in gender issues for all project staff, \nincluding those from support organizations such as NGOs/firms. Sessions on gender and development will be part of the \nmain project orientation training. The DDC of each project district will select one person to work with the NGO/firm gender \nspecialist to play a catalytic role in gender promotional efforts in the district. \n(iv) Increasing the number of women in contact with extension services. Representation of women staff in DOI and the \nDepartment of Agriculture is low. Woman-to-woman contact has been found to be more effective in reaching poor women. \nTherefore, at least 50% of community organizers will be women who will complement the work of the association \norganizers of DOI. \n(v)  Integration of gender data. The baseline survey of each district will include information on gender roles in irrigation and \nagriculture activities. The gender specialist, with the support of the NGO/firm gender specialist in each district, will ensure \nthis data is included in subproject planning, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation. \n(vi) Gender policy development and dialogue. Gender policy development will be pursued and addressed by the Project \nthrough three workshops\u2013two regional and one national. The gender specialist will facilitate this and collect opinions for \nformulating gender policy within DOI. The workshops will be facilitated in collaboration with other national stakeholders, \nparticularly the National Planning Commission (NPC), Ministry of Women, Children, and Social Welfare (MOWCSW), and \nMinistry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MOAC). The policy statement will contain the means of ensuring that action is \ntaken. \n(vii) Field channel groups. Each field channel group will have at least 35% women farmers following the MOAC policy on \nwomen\u2019s representation and participation. From each group two leaders, a man and a woman, will be selected and trained \nto serve as local extensionists.  \n(viii) Creating opportunities for female-centered households. At least 35% women or female-centered households will be \nprovided an opportunity in the nonconventional irrigation subcomponent such as drip and sprinkler, and water harvesting to \nincrease production on small plots of land with very small investment. Since an increasing number of poor women are now \nmanaging farms due to the migration of male family members for wage labor, the Project will focus part of its effort on \nbringing these technologies to women. Furthermore, microcredit facilities will be made available to women through NGOs \nhaving access to the microfinance facilities of the Rural Microfinance Development Center.  \n(ix) Monitoring and Evaluation. The gender specialist will contribute the establishment of a project monitoring system, to be \nadopted by DOI to incorporate data disaggregated by gender, ethnicity, and caste. The specialist will also provide inputs \non other aspects of project management information system (MIS) ensuring its gender responsiveness. Within the project \ncycle, biannual reviews will be undertaken to cover all aspects of Project implementation including achievement of gender \ngoals. Under the guidance of gender specialist, the NGO/firm gender specialist will develop a gender action plan reflecting \nlocal attitudes and practices for each district. The plan will be an integral part of the subproject preparation process. The \nplan will contain training proposals as well as strategies for increased participation of women as farmer trainers, WUA \nmembers, participants in project-related activities such as extension programs, walk-through, and participatory evaluations. \nSpecial programs for women in agriculture and water management will be jointly developed with project staff.  Gender \ndevelopment will be an integral part of the Project\u2019s overall targets and strategies. \n \n ", "54  Appendix 16 \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n \n1.  Scope and Impacts. The resettlement framework outlines the policy and procedures for \npreparing of the subprojects under the Community-Managed Irrigated Agriculture Sector Project. \nThe Project will renovate the existing farmer-owned and farmer-managed irrigation systems \n(FMIS)  through  improved  diversion  and  canal  systems.  The  process  involves  widening  or \nextending the existing canals, for which land needs to be acquired by water user associations \n(WUAs).  However,  land  acquisition  is  limited  to  a  minimum  strip.  The  project  preparatory \ntechnical assistance (PPTA) indicated that in the three sample subprojects, 0.77 hectare (ha) of \nland is needed to expand the command area from 426 ha to 569 ha, which represents 2.5% of \nthe farm plot area through which the canals pass. Some land parcels may also be required for \ntemporary use, such as quarry sites and place for storing construction material.  \n \n2.  Resettlement Policy. Resettlement will be implemented in accordance with the policy on \ninvoluntary resettlement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Government\u2019s Irrigation \nPolicy of 2003.  \n \n3.  Resettlement Principles and Entitlements. The resettlement framework applies to all \nresettlement effects arising from land acquisition or conversion, or any other effects that arise \nfrom the project works, including the effects on people with no title to the land. Those affected \nwill be entitled to maintain at least their standard of living at pre-project level, and to receive \ncompensation for all types of losses, including land, crops, trees, structures, and any other \nassets at full replacement value. Due to the economic benefits and increased value of land \nproperty  arising  from  the  improved  irrigation  systems,  those  affected  may  also  voluntarily \ncontribute the land, as an option, with written agreements between the WUA and the affected \npersons witnessed by a third party. Significantly affected persons, who lose 10% or more of their \ntotal land or income, if any, and vulnerable groups such as female heads of households, poor \npeople below the poverty line, occupational castes, and ethnic minorities will be eligible for \nfurther assistance such as counseling on compensation fund management and priority access to \nproject employment opportunities. Affected people, including those with no land titles, will receive \npriority assistance under the Project\u2019s agriculture and social development subcomponent. Table \nA16 summarizes the types of loss and entitlements of the affected persons.     \nTable A16: Compensation Entitlement Matrix \nType of Loss  Entitled Unit  Entitlement/Compensation \n1.

Institutional Responsibilities and Procedures. The Central Project Management Office \n(CPMO),  with  a  designated  resettlement  officer,  will  guide,  monitor,  and  report  on  land \nacquisition. The Regional Project Support Unit (RPSU), with a designated resettlement and \nsocial development officer, will supervise the resettlement plan preparation and implementation \ncarried out by the Subproject Management Unit (SMU). A resettlement specialist will be hired for \neach RPSU under the consultancy for institutional development and project management (ISPM) \nto assist in supervising the resettlement activities. Nongovernment organizations (NGOs) will be \nengaged to help SMU and WUAs plan and implement the resettlement plan. At each subproject \nlevel, social assessment will be done during the feasibility study to determine the category of the \nlikely resettlement impacts, based on which a full or short resettlement plan will be prepared by \nthe NGO with necessary land survey and social impact assessment undertaken by private firms \nduring  the  detailed  design  stage.  The  complete  resettlement  plan  will  be  prepared  before \nGovernment approval of the detailed design, and should include signed agreements with the \naffected persons including a no-coercion clause witnessed by a third party in case of voluntary \ncontribution; and a bank deposit slip to verify that the WUA has deposited sufficient up-front cash \nrequired for land compensation. The plan will be submitted to ADB for approval, and affected \npeople should be fully compensated before civil work contracts are awarded.    \n \n5.  Disclosure, Consultation, and Grievances. Each resettlement plan will be prepared \nand  implemented  in  close  consultation  with  the  stakeholders  and  will  involve  focus  group \ndiscussions and meetings particularly with the affected persons. Before submitting them to ADB, \ncopies of the draft resettlement plans will be disclosed to the public in project information centers \nto be set up at central, regional, and subproject level offices, and released to any requester \nincluding project-affected persons and NGOs. ADB will also post the resettlement framework and \nresettlement plans in its resettlement web site as appropriate. A grievances resolution committee \n(GRC) will be established in each subproject, under the chairmanship of the village development \ncommittee  (VDC)  chairperson.  Other  members  are  two  representatives  (one  man  and  one \nwoman) of affected persons, WUA chairperson, NGO representative, and representative from \nthe Project. The affected persons may submit their concerns or grievances verbally or in writing \nto the GRC. The GRC will facilitate the concerned parties agree on a time-bound action plan to \nresolve the grievances that are found to be genuine. \n \n6.  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  The CPMO will establish a monthly monitoring system \ninvolving RPSU and SMU. RPSU will prepare progress reports on all aspects of resettlement and \nsocial development efforts and outcomes with the assistance of ISPM resettlement specialists, \nbased on which the CPMO will prepare a quarterly progress report on resettlement. External \nmonitoring will be assigned to an independent agency preferably NGO, which will undertake \nannual monitoring and report to the CPMO and ADB.  \n \n7.  Resettlement Cost. The cost of land compensation will be borne by the WUA. Cost for \nthe  staff  and  NGOs  assigned  to  prepare,  implement,  and  monitor  resettlement  plans,  and \nconduct skills training for income generation will be borne by the Government and ADB.  \n ", "56  Appendix 17 \nSUMMARY OF SHORT RESETTLEMENT PLANS FOR CORE SUBPROJECTS \n1.  Scope and Impacts. The improvement of farmer-managed irrigation system (FMIS) in \nthe three core subprojects entails the following impacts from the widening of the existing canals \nand addition of new branch canals to irrigate an expanded command area (Table A17).  \nTable A17. Resettlement Impacts of Core Subprojects \nItem  Harinmari (Terai)  Talkhalka (Hills)  Inglakhola (Hills) \nCommand Area  255 ha (185 ha at present)  210 ha (110 ha at present)  141 ha (131 ha at present) \nLand Required (LR)  1.24 ha  0.59 ha  0.17 ha \nAffected Households (AH)  145  40  43 \nLR/ as %of total landholding of AH  0.69  0.41  0.60 \nha = hectare. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n \n2.  The proposed alignment passes through largely agricultural land. Due to strip acquisition, \nthere is no significantly affected person losing more than 10% of his/her income or is physically \ndisplaced. All farmlands are cultivated by farmers by themselves, so there are no tenants or non-\ntitled people. Thus, there is no significant resettlement impact in these subprojects.   \n \n3.  Stakeholder Consultation and Entitlements. During the project preparatory stage, the \nGovernment with the assistance of the consultants undertook initial consultations in the three \nsubproject areas, and presented resettlement framework (RF, Appendix 16) translated into the \nlocal language. The feedback and observations made at the stakeholders\u2019 meetings were used \nin preparing the entitlement matrix and discussing the project benefits for affected people.  \n \n4.  The consultations revealed that, while households were concerned that they would lose a \ncertain level of income due to the acquisition of the strip of land, they opined that the loss would \nbe far outweighed by the benefits from increased reliability and availability of irrigation water that \nwould enhance crop productivity and intensity.1 Consequently, all households were found ready \nto voluntarily contribute their land. It was also confirmed that the female heads of vulnerable \nhouseholds would be given priority access to subproject agriculture and livelihood enhancement \nprograms and employment opportunities.2 Further consultation and finalization of the entitlement \nmatrix and resettlement plan will continue prior to the approval of the subproject\u2019s detailed \ndesign, including the written agreements between the landowner and the WUA, with a \"no \ncoercion\" clause and witnessed by a neutral party in case of voluntary land contribution.   \n \n5.  Implementation Responsibilities and Cost Estimates. The arrangement as described \nin the RF (Appendix 16) is followed, including the implementation arrangements (engagement of \nlocal NGOs with supervision and support with the assistance of the consultants); disclosure, \nconsultation,  and  grievance  mechanisms;  and  monitoring  and  evaluation.  If  any  affected \nhouseholds choose the compensation option, the necessary fund will be provided by the WUA.3 \nThe cost of preparing and implementing the resettlement plan, to be undertaken by private firms \nand NGOs under the supervision of the RPSU and SMU, will be borne by the Government and \nADB. Compensation, if any, will be provided to the concerned affected households before civil \nworks contracts are awarded.  \n                                                 \n1  The affected households will, on the average, lose NRs200\u2013400 of income annually in each subproject from the land \nprovided to canals, while they will gain over NRs15,000\u201370,000 through improved irrigation access.  \n2  There are five, two, and three households with female heads among the affected households in Harinmari, \nTalkharka,  and  Inglakhola  subprojects,  respectively,  who  will  lose  1.47%,  0.25%,  and  1.02%  of  the  total \nlandholdings.  \n3  The Government will deduct the same amount from the WUA's capital contribution requirement for subproject \nimplementation (corresponding to 3% of diversion and 10% of other structure costs). \n   ", "  Appendix 18  57 \nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \nA.  Introduction \n1.  In accordance with Asian Development Bank (ADB) guidelines, initial environmental \nexamination  (IEE)  was  carried  out  as  part  of  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance \n(PPTA) for the Community-Managed Irrigated Agriculture Sector Project. The IEE assessed the \nenvironmental implications of the sector loan interventions, identified mitigating measures, and \ndeveloped environmental review and assessment procedures. In view of the different ecological \nlocations,  IEEs  for  three  sample  subprojects  were  prepared  during  the  PPTA:    Harinmari \nsubproject located in the alluvial terai, and Talkharka and Inglakhola subprojects in the hills. The \nproposed  Project  is  categorized  as  environmental  category  B  under  Environmental \nConsideration in ADB Operations (2003). Project interventions were screened with reference to \nADB's Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003).  \n \n2.  The project area covers 35 districts in Eastern and Central Development regions and \nshow considerable diversity of geography comprising mountains (12% of the area, with altitude \nabove 4,800 meters [m]), hills (65%), and the terai (23%, with altitude below 500 m) that lies \nacross the southern belt. The Project aims to improve agricultural productivity of the existing \nfarmer-managed irrigation systems (FMIS) while strengthening service delivery mechanisms \nand community institutions. The Project will include about 210 subprojects with an average area \nof 250 hectares (ha) in the terai and 100 ha in the hills. The major physical interventions will be \nconstruction  of  permanent  diversion  structures,  and  improvement  of  canals  and  ancillary \nstructures.  \n \nB.  Environment Conditions for the Sector Project \n3.  Nepal has a rich but fragile environment and faces a number of physical and human \nchallenges. Its rugged terrain, young geology, and monsoon climate produce high rates of \nrunoff, erosion, and sedimentation with frequent floods and landslides. High population growth \ncombined with high poverty incidence is also causing soil erosion, deforestation, biodiversity \nloss, and air and water pollution. The rivers in the project area are categorized into (i) large \nperennial  rivers  originating  in  the Himalayas,  (ii)  medium  rivers  from  the  midland  that  are \nperennial but have wide seasonal fluctuations, and (iii) a large number of small seasonal rivers \nin the terai. While there is no water shortage in large rivers, there are possibilities of water \ndeficits in some subbasins of the medium rivers during March\u2013May. Small rivers from southern \nhills do not have much water beyond the postmonsoon period. Water availability thus constrains \nwater use in irrigation systems. Many systems in the southern terai belt along small rivers have \nlimited  scope  for  year-round  run-of-the-river  irrigation.  Overall,  about  40%  of  the  irrigation \nsystems have year-round irrigation capacity.  \n \n4.  The  project  strategy  of  rehabilitating  the  existing  FMIS  to  improve  the  reliability  of \ndiversion and efficiency in water use with institutional development will mean that potential \nenvironmental  impacts  will  generally  be  positive.  Potential  environmental  concerns  include \nwater use conflicts and quality deterioration in areas of water scarcity, particularly in dry season. \nFMIS in the hills may destabilize land and possibly encourage further conversion of forest to \nagricultural  lands.  Water  and  soil  quality  may  also  be  affected  as  a  result  of  enhanced \nagricultural activities in the concerned FMIS. Given that subproject works are generally on a \nsmall scale, scattered in wide areas, and confined to existing agricultural lands, they can be \nkept  minimal  with  little  cumulative  impacts,  through  due  environmental  considerations  in \nsubproject screening, planning, and implementation.  \n ", "58  Appendix 18 \nC.  Summary of IEEs prepared for Subprojects \n1.  Description of the Subprojects and the Environment \n5.  Key features of the three core subprojects are summarized in the table.  \nTable A18.1: Summary of Scope of Principal Works for the Three Core Subprojects \nItem  Harinmari  Talkharka  Inglakhola \nLocation  Mahottari districts, in the terai   Ilam district, in the hills \nSize of  Current: 185 hectares (ha)  Current: 110 ha  Current: 131 ha \ncommand area  After project: 255 ha  After project: 210 ha  After Project: 141 ha \nNature and  Strengthening of existing  Construction of 11 meter (m)  Construction of 24 m gabion \nscope of  diversion bund, escape  concrete weir, gallery and  weir, gravel trap, and control \nheadworks  structure, gabion mattress and  gravel trap and control device  device \nimprovements  twin discharge weir \nNature and  Strengthening of 3,807 m main  Strengthening of 1,200 m main  Strengthening of 4,260 m main \nscope of canal  canal, 5,340 m branch canals  canal, 1,100 m branch canal  canal, 1,480 m of branch \nnetwork  and 1,460 m tertiary canals.   and 1,500 m extension branch  canals and 1,020 m extension \nimprovements  Provision of bed bars to retain  canal.

Harinmari. The scheme is located in the terai. The water source is a small local stream, \nthe Geruka Khola, with perennial flow fed by spring water. To divert water, farmers build \nembankments that have to be rebuilt after floods. The area was originally covered by dense \nforest but has been cleared for human settlement. There is no protected area or significant \nremnant of forest. Trees have been planted around homes, forming scattered vegetation clumps \nproviding some habitat for wildlife. There are 382 households with an average size of 5.8 \npersons. Over 55% are poor. The area is rural, with an urban portion 5\u201315 kilometers (km) \naway, connected through dust road and a national road. Services such as electricity are absent.    \n \n7.  Talkharka and Inglakhola. Both schemes are located in hilly terrain. Water resources \nare  substantial,  with  river  flow  sustained  during  dry  season.  Irrigation  is  operated  through \ntemporary diversion made of bush, logs, and stones that require regular rebuilding. Much of the \ncultivated land is terraced, surrounded by forested steep slopes and ridges. A large number of \nmultipurpose trees grown around the houses and including fodder and fruit trees afford habitats \nto wildlife. No protected areas occur within. The total number of households is 243 and 265, and \npoverty incidence is 54% and 62% in Talkharka and Inglakhola, respectively. Services such as \nelectricity and roads are limited. Access to health and education is similarly poor.  \n \n2.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts \n8.  The Project comprises two parts: part A, participatory irrigated agriculture development \nfor FMIS, and part B, institutional strengthening and project management. The environmental \nimpacts are confined to part A.  Part B develops the capacities of the project institutions to plan, \nimplement,  operate,  and  maintain  the  FMIS,  including  training  on  environmental  issues  to \nensure the full operation of the Project\u2019s environmental assessments and review procedures. \nThe impacts and mitigating measures in each subcomponent of part A are summarized below. \n \n9.  Participatory  Planning  and  Beneficiary  Mobilization.  This  subcomponent  is \nenvironmentally harmless as it involves participatory planning and social mobilization of farmers.   \n   ", "  Appendix 18  59 \n10.  Irrigation and Associated Infrastructure. Irrigation facilities and ancillary structures \nsuch as flood protection works will be financed. The IEEs identified environmental impacts that \ncould arise from (i) location, in terms of downstream water use and ecosystems affected by \nincreased intake by improved FMIS, and possible encroachment of protected areas; (ii) design, \nin  terms  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  erosion  of  slopes  along  canals  caused  by \nstructures, and drainage congestion; (iii) implementation, in terms of possible destabilization of \nsteep slopes, temporary pollution such as noise, dust, and silt runoff due to excavation; and (iv) \noperation, in terms of waterborne diseases due to standing water, and underachievement of \nbenefits due to poor operation and maintenance (O&M).  \n \n11.  In the IEEs, no sample schemes showed relevant location-related impacts.1 For future \nschemes such impacts will be avoided at subproject screening stage by undertaking stringent \nwater resources assessment and consultation with downstream users and excluding schemes \nhaving negative impacts. All core subprojects have resettlement impacts, which are mitigated by \npreparing  and  implementing  resettlement  plans  (Appendix  17).  In  the  two  hill  schemes, \npossibilities for increased erosion of slopes along canals, will be mitigated with environment-\nfriendly slope protection measures and soil investigation during detailed design stage. For all \ncore subprojects, contractors will be required to avoid construction-related pollution. Likewise, \nwaterborne diseases and poor O&M would be an issue for all core subprojects. They will be \nmitigated by raising awareness and ensuring proper and sustainable O&M with sufficient WUA \nstrengthening and training.      \n \n12.  Agriculture  Development  and  Livelihood  Enhancement.  The  activities  include \nagriculture  extension  to  promote  crop  intensification  and  diversification,  targeted  support \nincluding income generation for the poor and the disadvantaged, and pilot micro irrigation for the \npoor. While these activities will enhance the livelihood of the poor, they may cause soil and \nwater contamination due to increased agrochemical use and livestock activities resulting from \nirrigation-induced  increased  fodder  availability,  reduced  soil  nutrient,  biodiversity  loss, \nintroduction of alien species, and conversion of forests and wetlands into farmland. These were \nfound relevant in all core subprojects, and will be mitigated by including sustainable land use \npractices in agriculture extension, such as promoting organic-based practices, optimal use of \nfertilizers, and integrated pest management; monitoring the production of traditional varieties; \nand carefully selecting sites to avoid the conversion of ecosystems hosting unique species.  \n \n13.  Support  for  Sustainable  O&M.  Completed FMIS schemes will be monitored while \nrehabilitating the schemes that have suffered from severe natural calamities. Civil works may \ncause similar environmental impacts, which will be mitigated following the same arrangements.    \n \n  3.  Public Consultation \n \n14.  Stakeholder consultations were held at subproject, district, and national levels to discuss \nanticipated environmental impacts and their mitigating measures.2 In general, the stakeholders \nanticipated positive environmental impacts, while endorsing the project approach of inclusive, \nparticipatory, and demand-driven FMIS renovation. Their views were reflected in the IEEs and \nother project documents. \n                                                 \n1  In urban areas near Harinmari, industrial pollution is an issue, but the implication of the scheme is deemed minimal, \ngiven the large catchment area at the point of industrial effluent. The factory is also introducing treatment facilities.   \n2  Subproject-level meetings were held in June\u2013August 2003 with farmer groups (more than 400 people in total) for \nthe subproject and adjacent areas. District-level meetings were held during the period with groups of local \ngovernance institutions, line agency, and nongovernment organization (NGO) staff. Two national workshops to \ndiscuss  the  project  design  including  IEEs  were  held  in  February  and  September  2003  with  some  100 \nrepresentatives from line agencies, donors aid agencies, NGOs, and private organizations.   \n ", "60  Appendix 18 \nD.  Environmental Review and Management Procedures and Arrangements \n15.  Based on the IEEs and stakeholder consultation and following the ADB guidelines and \nthe  Government's  environmental  requirements,3 project-specific  environmental  assessment \nprocedures and arrangements (EAPA) were prepared (Supplementary Appendix K), and their \ncosts were included in the Project. Procedures and institutional responsibilities are summarized \nin  Table  A18.2.  For  an  average  subproject,  about  $3,000  is  provided  for  environmental \n(excluding resettlement) management to cover the cost of consultation (10%), IEE and planning \nactivities (55%), mitigation management (30%), and equipment (5%).  \nTable A18.2.

Conclusion and Recommendations \n16.  The principal findings of the IEEs are that the Project provides for environment-friendly \nirrigation interventions and contributes to significantly improved living conditions. The identified \nadverse  effects  will  be  addressed  through  proper  site  location,  planning,  design, \nimplementation, and O&M while incorporating identified mitigating measures. The Project can \ntherefore be classified under Category B. Further subprojects will follow the project-specific \nEAPA  developed  in  conformity  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  and  social  safeguard  policies. \nAppropriate review and monitoring throughout the project life will be carried out to ensure that \nthe guidelines are adhered to and that adequate capacity development support is given to the \nproject institutions carrying out the assessments and to the concerned communities. \n                                                 \n3  These are stipulated in Environmental Protection Act 1996 and its 1997 Rules revised in 1999. \n   "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20041126094919+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20041027184614+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R213-04.DOC", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 6.0 for Word", "Author": "ADB", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)", "SourceModified": "D:20041027104214"}}
