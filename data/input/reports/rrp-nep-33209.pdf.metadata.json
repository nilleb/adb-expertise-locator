The  improved  FMIS  will  intensify \nagricultural production in 25,500 hectares (ha) of existing irrigated \narea,  bring  an  additional  8,500  ha  under  irrigation  through \nimproved  water  distribution,  and  thus  benefit  over  270,000  poor \nmen  and  women.  Implementation  will  take  a  participatory  and \nprocess  approach,  following  the  initiatives  of  local  water  user \nassociations  (WUAs)  with  a  proven  track  record  of  having \nconstructed  FMIS  and  doing  self-sustained  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M). The process will be managed based on the \nperformance  of  the  concerned  organizations  in  achieving  the \nspecified  development  targets.  Institutional  development  support \nwill  aim  at  the  effective  operation  of  the  improved  participatory \ninclusive \nirrigation  service  delivery  mechanisms \ndevelopment with due empowerment and livelihood enhancement \nof  the  poor  including  ethnic  minorities  and  occupational  castes \n(dalit),  and  sufficient \nintegration  with  agriculture  marketing \nopportunities  and  support  services,  while  promoting  sector-wide \npolicy and institutional reforms toward sound governance.  \n \nIn  Nepal,  irrigation  is  an  essential  input  to  improve  agriculture \nproductivity,  which  remains  the  lowest  among  the  neighboring \ncountries.  The  20-year  Agriculture  Perspective  Plan  (APP)  that \nwas  launched  in  1995  with  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nassistance has prioritized irrigation as the foundation of a modern \nproduction  system,  with  emphasis  on  improving  the  performance \nof  traditional  surface  water  FMIS,  which  account  for  55%  of  the \ntotal  irrigated  area  and  23%  of  net  cultivated  area  of  2.6  million \nha.  Many  FMIS  suffer  from  low  productivity  that  is  barely  above \nsubsistence level, due to unreliable diversion and high distribution \nloss  and  maintenance  costs  caused  by  fragile  and  rudimentary \nintake  and  distribution  structures.  FMIS  offer  good  scope  for \n\nto  support \n\n\fiv \n\n \nObjective \n\nenhancing productivity, expanding the command area at relatively \nlow  cost,  and  short  lead  time,  and  building  on  the  existing  WUA \ncapacities through a participatory approach. \n  \nADB  has  assisted  in  improving  FMIS  since  1987  including  the \nrecently completed Second Irrigation Sector Project. While project \nperformance  has  been  positive,  with  many  FMIS  yielding \nreasonable economic benefits to smallholders, there is still scope \nfor improvement in delivering maximum benefits particularly to the \npoor  in  the community,  and  enhancing  WUA  capacity  to  become \nmore  active  agents \nthat  can  drive  dynamic  agriculture \ndevelopment  within  the  locality.  There  is  need  to  further  improve \nthe  project  design  by  ensuring  sufficient  attention,  time,  and \nresources  for  nonstructural  activities  such  as  empowering  WUAs \nand  supporting  agriculture  and  livelihood  enhancement,  and \nsound governance of public sector institutions for monitoring and \nquality control. Essential changes in the management system and \nbehavior of public institutions to become genuine service-oriented \nfacilitators are also called for.   \n \nImproving  FMIS  productivity  is  still  a  priority  in  the  agriculture \nsector, with 0.3 million ha currently requiring urgent rehabilitation. \nHowever, a  new approach is needed following the Government\u2019s \n2002  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper  (PRSP)  that  committed \nitself  to  (i)  reorientation  of  APP  to  strengthen  its  integrated  and \ncoordinated  market-oriented  approach,  its  pro-poor  focus  with \ntargeting,  and  support  for  decentralization;  and  (ii)  reforms  of \nsector institutions for sound governance. There is a pressing need \nto  operate  the  improved  service  delivery  mechanisms  for  FMIS \nrenovation  that  fully  address  these  new  sector  needs  and  the \nlessons  of  previous  assistance,  while  pursuing  policy  and \ninstitutional reforms that provide a sound basis for their operation. \nThe  Project  is  designed  to  address  these  challenges  and  is \nneeded to renovate the remaining subsistence FMIS to attain their \nmaximum sustainable benefits, particularly those for the poor and \nthe  disadvantaged,  with  sound  sector  governance.  The  sector \nloan modality is adopted in view of the Government\u2019s sound policy \nand  plan  framework  in  the  sector  such  as  APP,  PRSP,  and  the \n2003 Irrigation Policy; and its progressively improving capacity to \nsupport FMIS renovation, building on the existing WUAs.  \n \nThe  Project  aims \nimprove  agriculture  productivity  and \nsustainability of existing FMIS suffering from low productivity and \nhigh incidence of poverty, thereby enhancing the livelihood of poor \nmen and women in rural Nepal. For this purpose, the Project will \n(i)  provide  improved  means  for  beneficiary  participation  and \nempowerment, irrigation and associated infrastructure, agriculture \nand targeted livelihood enhancement for the poor, and sustainable \nO&M by WUAs; and (ii) strengthen policies, plans, and institutions \nfor  more  responsive  service  delivery  and  sustained  growth  and \npoverty reduction impacts.  \n\nto \n\n\f \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nv \n\n \nThe estimated project cost is $38.6 million equivalent, comprising \nforeign exchange of $12.8 million and local currency equivalent of \n$25.8 million, including taxes and duties of $5.5 million equivalent. \n \n\n($ million)\n\nPercent \n\nSource \n\nForeign \nExchange\n\nLocal \nCurrency \n11.6 \n2.9 \n9.1 \n2.2 \n25.8 \n\nTotal \nCost \n20.0 \n7.0 \n9.4 \n2.2 \n38.6 \n\n8.4 \n4.1 \n0.3 \n0.0 \n12.8 \n\nADB \nOPEC Fund \nGovernment \nBeneficiaries \n     Total \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  OPEC  Fund  =  Organization  of  Petroleum \nExporting Countries Fund for International Development. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n\n52 \n18 \n24 \n6 \n100 \n\n \n\n \n\nLoan Amount and Terms  The equivalent in various currencies of SDR13.615 million ($20.0 \nmillion approximately) from the Special Funds resources of ADB. \nThe  terms  are  32  years  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and \nan interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter. \n \nUntil 30 September 2012 \n \n31 March 2012 \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nimplementation \n\n \nMinistry of Water Resources  \n \nProject  implementation  aims  to  institutionalize  improved  service \ndelivery  mechanisms for FMIS including irrigation and agriculture \nextension  services  within  the  regular  setup  in  Department  of \nIrrigation  (DOI)  and  collaborating  agencies,  e.g.,  Department  of \nAgriculture  (DOA)  and  local  governance  institutions  (LGIs).  A \ncentral  project  management  office  (CPMO)  for  overall  project \nmanagement  and  technical  backstopping  will  be  set  up  in  DOI \nwith staff assigned from DOI and collaborating agencies. Day-to-\nday \ndistrict-level \nmultidisciplinary  subproject  management  unit  (SMU)  set  up  with \nstaff representing DOI, DOA, and LGIs, under the supervision of a \nregional  project  support  unit  (RPSU)  established \nin  each \ndevelopment  region.  WUAs  will  have  a  major  role  in  the  process \nby monitoring and endorsing outputs such as the subproject plan, \ndesign,  and  quality  and  quantity  of  services  provided.  Regular \nSMU-WUA  review  meetings  will  be  organized  as  major  decision-\nmaking forums.  \n \nIn  addition,  the  National  Vigilance  Center  under  the  Office  of \nPrime  Minister  and  Council  of  Ministers  will  undertake  external \ntechnical audit for selected subprojects using the loan proceeds. \n \n\ndelegated \n\nthe \n\nto \n\nis \n\n\fvi \n\nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nfor \n\nGoods and services financed by the ADB loan will be procured in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Equipment \npackages  valued  at  $500,000  equivalent  or  less  will  be  procured \nfollowing international shopping procedures. Civil works under the \nProject will comprise many small contract packages for improving \nirrigation  facilities  in  scattered  locations,  and  will  be  contracted \nthrough local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB. \n \nA  team  of  consultants  to  be  recruited  from  a  firm  will  support \ninstitutional  strengthening  and  project  management  by  providing \n574  person-months  of  consulting  services  (55  international  and \n519  domestic) \nirrigation  management,  participatory \ndevelopment,  water  resources  planning  and  design,  minor \nirrigation, agriculture development planning, agriculture extension, \nagriculture  economics,  gender  and  poverty, \nresettlement, \nenvironmental  management,  and  financial  management  and \naccounting.  Consultants  and  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs)  will  be  recruited  using  quality  and  cost-based  selection \nprocedures  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants.   \n \nAt full development, the Project will improve the livelihood of over \n270,000  poor  men  and  women  by  renovating  about  210  FMIS \ncovering  34,000  ha.  The  main  benefits  are  increased  agriculture \nproduction  brought  about  by  more  reliable  irrigation,  increased \nlabor opportunities, improved nutritional status particularly among \nsmallholders  suffering  from  chronic  food  deficit,  and  increased \nincomes and reduced poverty in subproject areas. The 210 WUAs \nwill  have  enhanced  capacity  to  sustain  improved  irrigation  water \nmanagement  and  better  cropping  practices.  The  economic \ninternal rate of return of three sample subprojects is 23\u201325%, due \nlargely  to  incremental  production  of  food  grains  followed  by \ncommercial crops to tap the available marketing opportunities and \nbuild  on  the  existing  cropping  pattern.  At  the  national  and  local \nlevels,  the  Project  will  improve  service  delivery  systems  to  attain \nmaximum  benefits  and \nirrigation \ninterventions  with  sound  quality  control,  along  with  improved \nsector  governance  through  sector-wide  policy  and  institutional \nreforms.  \n \nSurveys conducted during project preparation estimated that 54\u2013 \n62% of beneficiary households in the three core subproject areas \nfall  below  the  poverty  line,  which  is  higher  than  the  national \naverage  of  39%.  The  estimated  poverty  impact  ratio  for  these \nsubprojects  is  39%\u201351%.  The  social  development  strategy  will \nfocus  on  prioritizing  subproject  selection  in  areas  of  high  poverty \nincidence  with  an  ethnic  minority  population,  enhancing  WUA \ncapacity  to  support  a  socially  inclusive  approach  of  participatory \ndevelopment,  empowering  the  poor  and  the  disadvantaged  such \nas dalit through targeted support, enhancing the role of women in \nproject  institutions  and  programs,  and  policy  and  institutional \n\nsustainability \n\nthrough \n\n\f \nRisks and Assumptions \n\nvii \n\nreforms to improve governance while equalizing opportunities and \naccess  to  irrigation  among  the  poor  men  and  women,  and \ndisadvantaged people in the tail end.  \n \nThe Project has several types of risk that could adversely affect its \neffective implementation and sustained benefits. In particular, the \nongoing insurgency poses a considerable risk.  \n \nThe Project allows flexible site selection to renovate FMIS owned \nby  rural  communities,  using  a  demand-driven,  participatory,  and \ntransparent approach, that has proven effective in similar types of \nrural  infrastructure  works  under  insurgency.  The  Project  is  thus \nimplementable  under  conflict  situations,  with  due \ndeemed \nincorporation  of  coping  measures  such  as  careful  security \nmonitoring,  staff  training  to  work  with  insurgency,  mobilization  of \nstrong  community  support  to  build  local  trust  in  the  project  staff, \nand  a  flexible  implementation  modality  for  delivering  more \nservices  through  local  NGOs  and  consultants  less  prone  to \nconflict  situations.  The  Project  will  start  with  operating  in  areas \nwith  relatively  securer  environment,  and  progressively  expand \ncoverage by establishing models that can operate in more conflict-\naffected conditions. At present, the level of conflicts in Central and \nEastern  Development  regions  covered  under  the  Project  is \ngenerally less severe than that in the other regions, particularly in \nthe terai districts.  \n \nOther  possible  risks  are  (i)  WUA  sustainability,  (ii)  interagency \ncoordination  and  governance,  and  (iii)  implementation  delay.  To \nmitigate the first risk, the Project will discern and develop genuine \nWUA  interest,  ownership,  and  capacity  through  identification \nsurvey,  facilitation  support,  and  training  while  achieving  specified \ninstitutional  targets  prior  to  construction.  The  governance-related \nrisks will be addressed by strengthening management, monitoring \nand quality control systems of the concerned institutions to ensure \nparticipation,  transparency,  and  accountability  in  implementation. \nThe  risk  of  implementation  delay  will  be  mitigated  by  identifying \ninterest  and  member  support  during \nWUAs  with  genuine \nscreening,  and  having  a  larger  number  of  subproject  at  the  pre-\nconstruction stage compared with the annual construction targets. \n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nloan to the Kingdom of Nepal for the Community-Managed Irrigated Agriculture Sector Project, \nand (ii) proposed administration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of a loan to be provided \nby  the  OPEC  Fund  for  International  Development  (OPEC  Fund)  for  the  Project.1 The  project \nframework is in Appendix 1.  \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES  \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis  \n\nSector  Description.  Nepal  is  one  of  the  poorest  countries  in  Asia:  in  2002  per  capita \n2. \nincome  was  $241,  39%  of  the  population  lived  in  poverty,  and  48%  of  children  under  5  years \nwere  chronically  malnourished.  Over  90%  of  the  poor  live  in  rural  areas,  and  poverty  is  more \nconcentrated  among  smallholders  and  landless  people,  and  among  ethnic  minorities  and  dalit \n(occupational castes at the lowest stratum of Hindu social hierarchy).2 Ethnic minorities and dalit \nrepresent 36% and 13% of the population, respectively. Agriculture contributes 39% of the gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP)  but  it  plays  a  central  role  in  the  livelihood  of  the  poor,  providing \nemployment  for  over  80%  of  the  active  workforce  and  meeting  their  nutritional  needs.3 Yet \nproductivity  remains  low  and  largely  subsistence  oriented.  As  to  food  grains  that  account  for \nsome  85%  of  the  cultivated  land,  the  yields  of  paddy,  maize,  and  wheat  remain  at  2.7 \ntons/hectare  (t/ha),  1.8  t/ha,  and  1.9  t/ha,  respectively,  the  lowest  among  the  neighboring \ncountries. Key constraints are (i) difficult terrain conditions vulnerable to natural calamities such \nas  floods  and  landslides;  (ii)  poor  physical  capital  base  such  as  irrigation  and  rural  roads;  (iii) \nlimited  access  to  inputs,  output  markets,  and  financial  services;  (iv)  low  technology  base  and \nweak  extension;  and  (v)  insufficient  governance  of  public  institutions  to  deliver  development \nservices to a socially diverse population particularly those who are disadvantaged.  \n\n3. \nSince  1995,  sector  development  efforts  have  been  driven  by  the  20-year  Agriculture \nPerspective Plan (APP) that was prepared with ADB assistance and formed the basis of the 9th \n5-year plan (9FYP: FY1998\u2013FY2002). The APP aimed at achieving over 4% annual growth rate \nfor food grains and higher rates for cash products by improving total factor productivity through \n(i)  liberalization  of  input  and  output  markets  for  greater  private  sector  involvement;  and  (ii) \nprioritized  public  investments  for  improved  provision  of  irrigation,  seeds,  fertilizer,  finance, \nroads,  and  extension.  ADB  also  played  a  key  role  by  promoting  reforms4 and  providing  lead \nexternal  finance  (Appendix  2).  According  to  a  recent  agriculture  sector  performance  review \n(ASPR),5 sector  growth  rate  accelerated  to  3.3%  during  the  9FYP  period,  with  higher  rates \nrecorded for cash crops and livestock. Yet overall performance is still short of targets and is now \naffected  by  the  insurgency.  The  country  remains  a  net  importer,  albeit  small,  for  food  grains. \nThere has been little change in the production mix, with the shares of food grains (34%), other \n                                                 \n1   Project preparatory technical assistance was provided under ADB. 2001.

The \nchronology of project development is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n\n2  Over 70% of landholdings have less than 1 hectare (ha) of land. While most rural households have some land in \nthe hills, up to 40% of the rural population are landless in the terai, including the majority of dalit. There are also \nlarge areas where poverty incidence is high among the larger farmers due to low land productivity.  \n\n3   Livelihoods of the poor are varied and complex, with increasing nonfarm incomes in recent years including those \nfrom  out-migration.  Yet  there  is  evidence  of  a  high  increase  in  labor  demand  and  incomes  in  areas  of  high \nagriculture growth. Daily wage labor from agriculture is also a key source of income for poor women.  \n\n4  Including  (i)  deregulating  fertilizer  trading  and  pricing,  (ii)  eliminating  subsidies  and  import  duties  for  shallow-\ntubewells, (iii) privatizing Agriculture Inputs Corporation, and (iv) rationalizing public sector role in food distribution.   \n\n5  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Nepal for Agriculture Sector Performance Review. Manila.  \n\n\f2 \n\ncrops  (27%),  and  livestock  (29%)  in  agriculture  GDP  largely  unchanged,  despite  opportunities \nfor producing high-value products for domestic and Indian markets in areas with good irrigation \nand road access. Thus, intensifying food grain production, and diversifying and commercializing \nagriculture remain key challenges.  \n\n4. \nIrrigation.  Due  to  the  highly  erratic  rainfall  pattern  in  Nepal,  irrigation  is  an  essential \ninput  for  intensifying  agriculture  across  the  year.6 Of  a  total  cultivated  land  of  2.64  million  ha, \nabout  1.13  million  ha  (43%)  has  access  to  irrigation:  (i)  0.62  million  ha  of  farmer-managed \nirrigation  systems  (FMIS)  using  surface  water,  traditionally  constructed  and  maintained  by \nfarmers; (ii) 0.27 million ha developed by the Department of Irrigation (DOI) using surface water; \nand  (iii)  0.24  million  ha  of  groundwater  irrigation  in  the  alluvial  terai,  a  fertile  plain  in  southern \nNepal.  However,  the  productivity  of  these  areas  is  low.  The  actual  irrigated  area  against  the \ndeveloped  potential  in  the  monsoon,  winter,  and  spring  remains  at  70%,  20%,  and  10%, \nrespectively.7 DOI-developed systems are even less utilized due to lack of user participation and \npoor  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M).  Many  FMIS  suffer  from  low  yields  due  to  fragile \ndiversion structures (made of earth, logs, or brushwood and frequently washed away by floods) \nand rudimentary distribution systems causing unreliable water supply, and high distribution loss \nand O&M costs. At present, urgent rehabilitation is required for over 0.3 million ha of FMIS.  \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n5. \nAgriculture  Support  Services.  Following  the  APP\u2019s  market-oriented  reforms,  the \nprivate sector has shown dynamic response in marketing farm inputs and outputs. However, the \nprocess is still at a formative stage. Fertilizer use by farmers has increased by nearly 20% per \nannum  in  recent  years  after  deregulation  of  private  distribution.  Yet  its  applied  rate  is  far  less \nthan half the levels suggested by the Department of Agriculture (DOA). Availability and use of \nimproved seeds also remain a major constraint particularly for food grains, for which few private \nagents  exist  to  supplement  the  meager  public  seed  supply. 8  Mainly  due  to  expansion  of \nmicrofinance  institutions  (MFIs),  the  number  of  borrowers  in  rural  finance  increased  nearly \nthreefold in the 1990s to reach 22% of households. Yet the MFIs' geographical outreach is still \nlimited. In output marketing, successful cases of sales chains for high-value crops are emerging \nalbeit only sporadically, linking farmers and wholesale markets. As to extension, while DOA staff \nhave technical know-how in modern cropping practices, field-level dissemination is constrained \nby lack of resources and a weak mechanisms for beneficiary participation. On the other hand, \nthere  are  private  providers  including  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  delivering  effective \nextension  services  on  a  contract  basis.  Overall,  these  conditions  call  for  strategic  provision  of \ncritical  public  services,  concerted  efforts  in  facilitating  the  delivery  of  key  inputs  and  support \nservices,  and  careful  assessment  of  the  postharvesting  marketing  opportunities.  Farmer \ncapacities also need strengthening so that they can collectively drive this process.  \n\nIrrigation  Efforts  to  Date.  Historically  irrigation  has  received  high  priority  in  public \n6. \ninvestments.  Initial  efforts  were  directed  toward  developing  new  and  complex  large-scale \nschemes,  which  suffered  from  poor  performance  due  to  lack  of  local  institutions  to  support \neffective  O&M.  Starting  in  the  late  1980s,  the  Government  shifted  its  focus  to  participatory \nimprovement of existing irrigation systems. FMIS renovation was identified as a very attractive \nopportunity  in  view  of  the  existence  of  farmer  water  user  associations  (WUAs)  with  a  proven \n                                                 \n6  In  a  field  survey  in  the  ASPR,  51%  of  farmers  cited  lack  of  reliable  irrigation  as  a  major  constraint  in  increasing \n\nproduction, followed by availability of improved seeds and fertilizer (11%), and lack of extension (9%). \n\n7  About  40%  of  the  irrigated  land  has  access  to  year-round  irrigation.  Water  is  not  available  in  many  schemes  in \n\nsouthern terai, which have small catchment, in particular during spring (March\u2013May).  \n\n8   In the case of wheat, improved seed supply currently meets less than 20% of the amount required at the national \n\nlevel to achieve the replacement rate recommended by DOA. The rates for other food grains are lower. \n\n\f3 \n\ntrack record of self-sustained O&M. Mostly small and medium in size,9 FMIS have good scope \nfor  enhancing  productivity  and  expanding  the  command  area  by  resolving  the  aforementioned \ntechnical  deficiencies  with  relatively  low  cost  and  short  lead  time.  DOI  in  1992  prepared  the \nIrrigation Policy that set out guidelines for participatory irrigation development, and improved it \nin  1997  following  the  lessons  of  earlier  investments.  DOI's  institutional  structure  was  also \nimproved,  with  the  establishment  of  an  irrigation  management  section  in  its  central  and  field \noffices  and  deployment  of  social  scientists;  however,  strengthening  the  nonengineering \ncapacities of DOI is still a future goal. ADB played a key role during this process of policy, plan, \nand DOI strengthening through assistance to three FMIS projects launched in 1987\u20131991.10 \n\n7. \nBuilding  on  these  developments,  the  APP  further  prioritized  irrigation,  after  which  ADB \nassisted the Second Irrigation Sector Project (SISP)11 to improve FMIS in two eastern regions. \nADB  is  also  supporting  groundwater  irrigation  development  in  the  terai  areas  of  the  same \nregions. The World Bank has funded a similar package covering three western regions, along \nwith broad water sector institutional reforms, whereas the European Commission has supported \nFMIS renovation in selected districts in the Western Development Region (Appendix 2).  \n\n8. \nLessons  from  FMIS  Interventions.  ADB-assisted  FMIS  projects  have  been  rated \nsuccessful  in  postevaluation  reports.12 Most  WUAs  were  capable  of  increasing  the  command \narea,  crop  intensity,  and  yields,  and  the  returns  were  deemed  sufficient  to  justify  investments. \nHowever,  there  are  still  notable  gaps  between  what  is  realized  and  the  potential  attainable  in \nprogressive farming practices. Access to extension and other inputs is often a constraint. WUAs \nare  largely  confined  to  routine  irrigation  O&M,  despite  their  interest  and  potential  to  become \nuseful organizations to drive the local agriculture development process. Overall, the lessons call \nfor  significant  improvement  in  project  design  and  further  capacity  development.  Specifically, \ninterventions should be driven by the aim of improving water use and agricultural production as \nopposed to constructing structures, a still lasting interest in DOI. Second, strategic site selection \nis needed to tap existing postharvest marketing and poverty reduction opportunities and build on \ncoherent  WUA  willingness,  along  with  careful  planning,  to  facilitate  the  delivery  of  extension, \ninputs,  and  credit.  Third,  sufficient  resources  should  be  provided  for  nonstructural  works \nincluding  agriculture  programs  and  WUA  strengthening  as  capable  community  agents  with \ncollective  bargaining  power  to  liaise  with  necessary  agriculture  service  providers.  Fourth, \nimproving overall quality control and monitoring is essential to ensure participatory processes at \nall stages. Such processes call for generic changes in the management and behavior of public \ninstitutions, from being conventional implementers to becoming service-oriented facilitators.   \n\nIn  terms  of  poverty  implications,  positive  impacts\u2013direct  (via  crop  intensification)  and \n9. \nindirect\u2013have  been  observed  in  the  livelihood  of  small  and  marginal  farmers  and  landless \npeople,  even  in  the  localities  of  ethnic  minorities.  The  latter  notably  (i)  had  wage  labor \nopportunities;  (ii)  increased  livestock  production  (via  higher  fodder  availability),  and  (iii)  rented \nlands  from  larger  farmers  (who  had  labor  shortages).13 Marginal  non-irrigated  areas  benefited \nsignificantly  through  an  expanded  command  area.  However,  past  projects  did  not  have \n\n                                                 \n9   In Nepal, small schemes are defined as those having command areas of less than 25 ha in the hills and 200 ha in \n\nthe terai, while medium schemes have less than 500 ha in the hills and 2,000 ha in the terai.  \n\n10 Including the East Rapti Irrigation Project (ERIP), approved in 1987; the Irrigation Sector Project, approved in 1988; \n\nand the Rajapur Irrigation Project, approved in 1991.  \n\n11 ADB. 1996. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Kingdom of Nepal for the Second Irrigation Sector \n\nProject. Manila (for $25 million, approved on 16 May 1996, and completed in June 2003). \n\n12 Project completion reports of the three projects in footnote 10 and project performance evaluation report of ERIP. \n13 A survey in the selected SISP subprojects noted that on average, the income of marginal farmers (with less than \n0.5 ha land) increased from 40% below the poverty line before the project to 15% above after the project. Larger \nfarmers also preferred to lease their land to this group who had more manure to apply per unit of farmland.    \n\n\f4 \n\nmechanisms to empower the disadvantaged groups and deliver specific services to them. There \nis a need to strengthen the commitment and capacities of sector institutions to address poverty \nagendas within FMIS projects. Appendix 3 gives the lessons learned.  \n\nRecent  Government  Initiatives.  In  2002,  the  Government  adopted  the  Poverty \n10. \nReduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and the 10FYP (2003\u20132007), and renewed commitments for \nrural-oriented poverty reduction. In agriculture, the PRSP aims to enhance APP implementation \nwith improved service provision and governance, through stronger agency coordination, private \nsector  and  NGO  engagement,  community  participation,  and  decentralization,  in  line  with  the \nASPR  recommendations.  Progressive  steps  were  also  taken  following  the  1999  Local  Self-\nGovernance  Act  (LSGA)  and  the  2002  Decentralization  Implementation  Action  Plan  (DIAP), \nbased on which district offices of DOA were placed under the district development committees \n(DDCs).14 As  to  irrigation,  the  Government  committed  itself  to  further  policy  and  institutional \nreforms  in  line  with  the  ongoing  water  sector  reforms,  including  the  2002  National  Water \nResources  Strategy  (NWRS).  The  NWRS  set  out  sector  goals  and  short-  to  long-term \ninstitutional  and  physical  targets,  adopting  the  principles  of  integrated  water  resources \nmanagement (IWRM) and participatory service delivery. The Government is now preparing the \nIWRM policy and a 25-year national water plan (NWP) while defining an institutional framework \nfor  IWRM  at  national  and  river  basin  levels.15 Reforms  of  sector  institutions  such  as  DOI  are \nalso envisaged in line with this process. Overall, however, support is needed to transform these \ninitiatives into sound sector operations.  \n\n11. \nADB\u2019s  Strategy.  ADB\u2019s  new  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP)  for  Nepal  was \nprepared in 2004 following the PRSP and ASPR. The CSP prioritizes investments in rural areas \nthat generate quick benefits and support the inclusive process of development. In view of large \nFMIS  areas  still  suffering  from  low  productivity  and  poverty,  and  of  the  scope  for  promoting \nminor irrigation that targets the poor in nonirrigated areas, the CSP recognized that community-\nbased irrigation is one of the strategic pillars for supporting rural development, along with rural \ninfrastructure,  crop  diversification  and  commercialization,  and  livestock  development.  As  to \nFMIS,  a  pressing  need  now  is  to  define  and  operate  improved  delivery  mechanisms  for  their \nrenovation,  incorporating  the  lessons  and  addressing  the  new  challenges  identified  in  PRSP, \nASPR,  and  NWRS.  This  objective  should  be  pursued  with  necessary  policy  and  institutional \nreforms that provide a sound basis for their operation. Addressing these tasks is consistent with \nADB\u2019s water policy, and will contribute to attaining maximum benefits from FMIS renovation with \nfurther empowered WUAs, and improved governance of public sector institutions.  \n\nPolicy Dialogues and Sector Opportunities. The Project was prepared to address the \n12. \nchallenges  with  necessary  policy  dialogues.  Specifically,  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance  (PPTA,  footnote  1)  contributed  to  the  drafting  of  the  new  irrigation  policy,  which \neffectively  incorporated  the  emerging  principles  and  lessons  including  river  basin-based \nplanning, WUA empowerment with pro-poor and gender focus, and DDC capacity development \nto support devolution, to be institutionalized under the Project. Second, with an overall vision to \nbecome  a  genuine  service-oriented  facilitator  to  support  beneficiaries,  DOI  agreed  to  proceed \nwith  due  institutional  reforms,  with  specific  agendas  including  (i)  setting  out  an  institutional \ndevelopment  strategy,  (ii)  preparing  and  carrying  out  action  plans  for  improving  human  and \nfinancial resources management, (iii) strengthening internal quality control, and (iv) defining and \ntaking  steps  to  devolve  FMIS  operations  following  the  LSGA.  Third,  as  a  concrete  step  to \nimprove quality control and governance, the Government decided to establish a technical audit \n                                                 \n14 LSGA also envisages devolution of small-scale FMIS development support from DOI to DDC. The contribution of \n\nthe proposed Project to this direction is described in para. 38. \n\n15 These are assisted by the World Bank and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA).   \n\n\f5 \n\ndivision  in  the  National  Vigilance  Center  (NVC)  under  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  and \nCouncil  of  Ministers,  and  to  start  operating  technical  auditing  in  the  irrigation  and  rural \ninfrastructure  sectors,  with  ADB  assistance.16 Fourth,  the  Government  agreed  to  consult  with \nADB  on  continued  reforms  in  the  agriculture  and  water  resources  sector,  including  the \npreparation of the IWRM policy, its institutional framework, and the NWP. The Project has also \nstrengthened  mechanisms  for  more  effective  FMIS  renovation  by  incorporating  the  preceding \nlessons \nimpacts  and  WUA \nempowerment,  through  strategic  site  selection  that  prioritizes  poverty  pockets  and  confirms \nmarketing  outlets,  sufficient  resources  for  nonengineering  activities  with  clear  output  targets, \noutsourcing to private providers, and improved internal and external quality control. The sector \ninstitutional analysis is in Appendix 4 and Appendix 5 gives the policy and institutional reforms \nand implementation matrix. (Sector analysis is in Supplementary Appendix B.) \n\nfor  enhancing  agriculture  growth  and  poverty  reduction \n\n13. \nSector  Approach.  The  Project  has  been  formulated  following  ADB\u2019s  sector  loan \nmodality, based on (i) the Government\u2019s APP, NWRS, and the 2003 Irrigation Policy that form a \nsound policy framework to promote participatory FMIS improvement; (ii) the existing long-term \ninvestment plan, which is embodied in the 10FYP following the APP, and is now being refined \nas  NWP  while  incorporating  the  investment  schedule  of  the  Project;  and  (iii)  progressively \ndeveloping the sector institutions' capacity to enhance the productivity of FMIS, building on the \nexisting WUAs that will be further strengthened during the Project. \n\nA. \n\nObjective \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\n14. \nThe  overall goal  of  the Project  is  to  promote  inclusive  economic  growth  while  reducing \npoverty in the rural areas of Central and Eastern Development regions.17 Its specific objective is \nto  improve  agriculture  productivity  and  sustainability  of  existing  small  and  medium-size  FMIS \nsuffering  from  low  productivity  and  high  poverty  incidence,  and  thus  enhance  the  livelihood  of \npoor men and women including ethnic minorities and dalit. To achieve the objective, the Project \nwill  (i)  provide  improved  means  for  WUA  empowerment,  irrigation  facilities,  agriculture \nextension, and targeted livelihood enhancement to build the human capital of the poor including \nwomen  and  traditionally  neglected  disadvantaged  groups;  and  (ii)  strengthen  policies,  plans, \nand institutions for more responsive service delivery and sustained impacts.  \n\nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n15. \nThe  Project  has  two  components:  (i)  participatory  irrigated  agriculture  development  for \nFMIS, and (ii) institutional strengthening and project management (ISPM). The output of the first \ncomponent  is  substantially  improved  agricultural  productivity  and  reduced  poverty  in  over \n34,000  ha  of  land  (about  210  FMIS)  including  8,500  ha  of  expanded  command  area,18 and \nimproved  livelihood  for  over  270,000  poor  men  and  women.  The  second  component  will \nculminate in operation of mechanisms for improved service delivery to develop productive and \nsustainable  FMIS  through  (i)  further  improved  irrigation  policies,  regulations,  and  plans;  (ii) \nstrengthened  DOI  (in  terms  of  human  resources  and  management  capacity),  DOA,  local \ngovernance  institutions  (LGIs),  and  WUAs;  and  (iii)  enhanced  institutional  linkages  to  deliver \nservices in coordination with NGOs and the private sector. \n                                                 \n16 ADB.  2003.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Kingdom  of  Nepal  for  Strengthening  Project  Implementation  and  Quality \n\nAssurance. Manila.   \n\n17 Poverty incidence is lower in the Central and Eastern Development regions due to higher urbanization, but tracts of \n\nconcentrated poverty are widely found in their rural areas in particular those with low agriculture productivity.  \n\n18 Overall, the Project will cover 22,000 ha of FMIS in the terai and 12,000 ha in the hills and the mountains. \n\n\f6 \n\n1. \n\nParticipatory Irrigated Agriculture Development for FMIS \n\n16. \n This  component  will  support  participatory  development  of  FMIS  subprojects  through  a \nprocess  approach.  It  has  four  subcomponents:  (i)  participatory  planning  and  beneficiary \nmobilization,  (ii)  community-based  irrigation  and  associated  infrastructure,  (iii)  agriculture \ndevelopment  and  livelihood  enhancement,  and  (iv)  support  for  sustainable  O&M.    To  ensure \neffective process management, each subproject will have distinct output targets at each stage of \nthe  implementation  cycle,  which  are  set  as  benchmarks  for  the  next  stage.  The  number  of \nsubprojects  in  each  district  will  be  managed  following  the  performance  of  the  district-level \ninstitutions.  \n\na. \n\nParticipatory Planning and Beneficiary Mobilization \n\n17. \nParticipatory  Subproject  Identification  and  Planning.  The  Project  will  support \nidentification  of  viable  subprojects  and  participatory  preparation  of  comprehensive  subproject \nimplementation  plans  (SIPs).  Activities  include  (i)  formulation  of  district  irrigated  agriculture \ndevelopment  strategies,  (ii)  information  campaign,  (iii)  subproject  screening,  and  (iv)  SIP \npreparation with feasibility studies. At the outset, the Project will prepare an irrigated agriculture \ndevelopment strategy for each district that maps out marketing opportunities, water availability, \nand poverty conditions. The Project will also organize information campaigns through DDCs, to \nwhich  interested  WUAs  will  submit  requests  that  are  then  screened  in  light  of  the  district \nstrategy, field assessments, and consultation with farmers including downstream users. Those \nin areas of high poverty incidence, high proportion of ethnic minority and dalit population, long-\nterm  self-sustaining  O&M  records,  and  high  marketing  potentials  will  be  prioritized.  Finally,  a \nmultidisciplinary  feasibility  study  will  be  carried  out  for  the  selected  subprojects  to  prepare  a \ncomprehensive SIP, which will stipulate specific actions, programs, and input and output targets \nfor  WUA  strengthening,  irrigation  infrastructure,  agricultural  development,  and  livelihood \nenhancement for the poor and disadvantaged groups.  \n\n18.  Mobilization  of  Water  User  Association  Beneficiaries.  The  Project  will  empower \nWUAs  to  manage  activities  at  the  preconstruction,  construction,  and  postconstruction  stages. \nWUAs  will  play  effective  organizational,  operational,  resource  mobilization,  and  networking \nfunctions to facilitate input delivery and output marketing with a collective bargaining power. The \nProject  will  initially  help  WUAs  participate  in  preparing  and  endorsing  the  draft  SIP.  Then,  the \nProject will support the WUAs to implement the institutional strengthening plan they developed \nand  included  in  the  SIP,  including  (i)  enrolling  members  and  mobilizing  functional  men  and \nwomen groups, (ii) registering, with the formation of executive committees and operational rules, \nand (iii) implementing routine O&M and minor improvement works. The Project will facilitate the \nprocess by recruiting community organizers (COs) locally. NGOs will be engaged to train COs.19 \nAt least 33% women participants are targeted for all activities, and ethnic minority and dalit will \nbe represented in proportion to their number among the subproject beneficiaries.  \n\nb. \n\nIrrigation and Associated Infrastructure \n\nAfter a WUA achieves the institutional development targets, the Project will support the \n19. \nparticipatory  detailed  design  and  construction  of  infrastructure  such  as  diversion  structures, \ncross-drainage  works,  improved  and  extended  canal  systems,  and  flood  protection  facilities  to \nbe operated by the WUA. The detailed design will be prepared in consultation with the WUA and \nendorsed by it before finalization. Existing design standards will be revised to promote low-cost \n                                                 \n19 The Project will also engage the National Federation of Irrigation Water User Associations Nepal (NFIWUAN) and \n\nits chapter organizations in districts where they have sufficient resource base.  \n\n\f7 \n\nand  simple  structures  following  domestic  and  international  experience.  The  WUA  will  then \nprovide beneficiary contribution, mostly in the form of labor. During the process, the Project will \nsupport preparation and implementation of the resettlement plans. Completion of these activities \nwill serve as a benchmark to initiate the procurement process to implement civil works. \n\n20. \nLocal  contractors  will  be  engaged  to  construct  key  structures,  while  simpler  structures \nand earthwork will be implemented by WUAs with the support of DOI technicians. For intensive \nconstruction supervision, supervisors will be fielded on a full-time basis. The WUA will also be \ntrained  and  engaged  in  monitoring  and  final  confirmation  of  civil  works  done  by  contractors. \nInternal and external technical audit will be arranged to monitor full compliance with the contract \nand support construction quality management.  \n\nc. \n\nAgriculture Development Support and Livelihood Enhancement \n\n21. \nThis subcomponent will focus on improving farmer skills in crop productivity through self-\nsustaining  and  self-reliant  farmer  groups,  and  developing  WUA  capacities  to  support  this  end. \nIts outputs will be monitored against the SIP targets for production, improved market access for \nagricultural  produce,  and  incomes  at  subproject  level.20 Agriculture  development  will  take  into \naccount  the  comparative  labor  productivity  and  the  risk  dimensions,  main  factors  in  farmer \ndecisions  in  agricultural  investment.  The  activities  will  include  the  following,  and  the  WUA  will \nmonitor and confirm delivered services in light of the SIP specification.  \n\n22. \nAgriculture  Extension  and  Support.  The  Project  will  support  agricultural  extension \nservices  in  the  subproject  area  to  promote  adoption  of  high-yielding  and  improved  varieties  of \ncrops  and  their  diversification.  The  support  will  be  provided  by  designated  Government \nagriculture  extension  and  irrigation  staff,  and  private  sector  or  NGOs  engaged.  Activities  will \ninclude (i) field demonstration and training through a farmer field school approach covering on-\nfarm water management, integrated pest management, and cropping calendar management; (ii) \nfarmer tour to most successful FMIS; (iii) training workshops; and (iv) practical research done by \nNepal Agriculture and Research Council (NARC). As part of the field demonstration, the Project \nwill  also  support  seed  multiplication  by  delivering  foundation  seeds  and  technical  support. \nWUAs  will  sustain  extension  activities  by  operating  the  cost  recovery  norms  for  the \ndemonstration inputs that will be repaid by the concerned farmers to the WUA as seed money, \nand establishing in-house extensionists within the WUA through training.21 WUAs\u2019 technical and \nmanagerial  capacities  will  also  be  strengthened  to  facilitate  improved  farmer  access  to \nagriculture  inputs  and  other  services  collectively  to  reach  better  deals  with  providers  and \nenhance their accountability to clients. \n\n23. \nLivelihood  Enhancement.  To  enhance  development  impacts  for  the  poor,  the  Project \nwill  provide  support  targeting  vulnerable  groups  including  women,  the  landless,  and  dalit,  to \nassist their specified livelihood activities such as vegetable gardening. Where appropriate, it will \nalso  help  establish  linkage  between  these  vulnerable  WUA  member  groups  and  available \nmicrocredit  resources  such  as  the  Rural  Microfinance  Development  Center  and  its  network  of \nMFIs to promote group savings and deliver microcredit. Qualified MFIs will be engaged for this \npurpose. The Project will also support the delivery of technical services available at district level, \n                                                 \n20 This component will be complemented by the proposed Commercial Agriculture Development Project in the eastern \nregions,  programmed  in  2005.  Specific  synergy  will  be  laid  out  in  the  SIP,  along  with  the  arrangements  for \ndelivering non-Project supported inputs and services such as fertilizer, pesticides, improved seeds, etc.  \n\n21 Extension  will  be  provided  through  WUA  field  channel  groups,  with  demonstration  plots  selected  from  among \nmarginal farmers. From each group two members, a man and a woman, will be selected to be group leaders and \nwill  be  trained  to  serve  as  local  extensionists.  Groups  will  have  at  least  35%  women,  following  the  policy  of  the \nMinistry of Agriculture and Cooperatives on women\u2019s representation and participation.  \n\n\f8 \n\nincluding training for income generation such as rice cum fish culture, crop processing, livestock \nraising, and cottage industries. Specific programs will be set out in the SIP with the poor groups \nwhile  seeking  synergy  with  ongoing  development  programs  on  microfinance,  livestock,  skills \ndevelopment,  commercial  agriculture,  and  rural  livelihoods  in  the  district,  including  those \nassisted by ADB and other sources.  \n\n24.  Minor  Irrigation  for  the  Poorest.  The  Project  will  demonstrate  innovative  minor  or \nmicro  irrigation  systems,  such  as  sprinkler  and  drip  irrigation  based  on  water  harvesting, \npromoting  collective  efforts  by  the  poorest  people,  particularly  ethnic  minorities  and  dalit.  This \nactivity will be implemented as action research. With the engagement of NGOs, the Project will \nsupport  (i)  assessment  of  available  experience,  (ii)  design  of  appropriate  types  of  intervention \npackages, (iii) identification of activity areas, (iv) preparation of a participatory plan including a \nfeasibility study, and (v) pilot implementation through resource mobilization by groups. \n\nd. \n\nSupport for Sustainable O&M of FMIS  \n\nSelecting FMIS with long-term records of self-managed O&M (para. 17) is a proven way \n25. \nto ensure the sustainability of renovated FMIS in past projects, to which the pursuit of lower cost \nand simple structures (para. 19) will further contribute. On top of these, the Project will operate a \nmonitoring and support system for sustainable subproject O&M and also for those completed in \nprevious  projects.  For  new  subprojects,  on-the-job  training  will  be  provided  to  prepare  and \nimplement  O&M  and  resource  mobilization  plans  for  WUA.  In  addition  to  undertaking  routine \nO&M,  WUAs  will  establish  and  increase,  as  conditions  for  subproject  selection  and \nimplementation,  an  emergency  reserve  fund  to  be  used  for  nonrecurrent  maintenance.  For \nsubprojects  completed  in  previous  projects,  a  database  will  be  set  up  through  stocktaking  on \ntheir  performance  and  impact  indicators.  Starting  in  the  year  3,  the  Project  will  support  the \nrehabilitation of a limited number of completed schemes that have been damaged by excessive \nnatural  disasters,  following  a  separate  appraisal  procedure  to  be  agreed  upon  with  ADB.  The \nshare of ADB funding will be phased out each year toward project completion, after which the \nGovernment will provide a regular budget to support such subprojects. \n\n2. \n\nInstitutional Strengthening and Project Management \n\n \n\n26. \nThis  component  comprises  (i)  support  for  national-level  institutional  strengthening;  (ii) \nproject  management,  monitoring,  and  quality  control  for  FMIS  renovation;  and  (iii)  training  of \nproject  personnel  and  stakeholders.  Consulting  services  will  be  provided  for  these  purposes \nalong with the necessary hardware and software. \n\na. \n\nSupport for National-Level Institutional Strengthening  \n\n The Project will monitor and advise on the ongoing reforms in the agriculture and water \n27. \nresources sectors while supporting practical institutional actions to improve the delivery of FMIS \noperations.  Activities  monitored  and  supported  are  shown  in  the  policy  dialogue  matrix \n(Appendix  5).  For  DOI,  specific  outputs  will  be  improved  sector  governance  measured  by  (i) \nfurther improved irrigation policy and FMIS investment plan following the project experience; (ii) \nan  institutional  development  strategy  with  gender-responsive  perspectives;  (iii)  improved  staff \ncapacity  development  programs  and  management  rules;  (iv)  improved  management  systems \nincluding  FMIS  planning,  design,  implementation,  quality  control,  and  monitoring;  and  (v) \nprogress in devolving irrigation operations to LGIs. While the activities to produce these outputs \nare implemented by the Government with formation of specific working groups, the Project will \nprovide consulting services to support the processes.   \n\n\f9 \n\nb. \n\nFMIS Project Management, Monitoring, and Quality Control  \n\n28. \nThe  Project  will  operate  participatory  project  management,  monitoring,  and  quality \ncontrol  systems  to  ensure  the  subproject  output  quality.  Activities  will  be  managed  through  a \ncentral project management office (CPMO), regional project support units (RPSUs), and district-\nlevel  subproject  management  units  (SMUs).  As  measures  for  subproject-level  participatory \ndecision  making  and  monitoring,  the  Project  will  support  (i)  regular  SMU-WUA  meetings  to \njointly review progress and make subproject decisions, (ii) fielding of mobile teams from RPSUs \nto  verify  key  subproject  outputs,  and  (iii)  regular  RPSU-SMU  managerial  review  meetings. \nConsultancy inputs will be provided to assist the effective operation of the mechanisms through \non-the-job training and learning. The performance of delivery mechanisms for FMIS renovation \nand other support services is also regularly monitored and evaluated against the set indicators, \nfor continuous modification and improvement during the project implementation period.  \n\n29. \nThe  Project  will  also  support  external  technical  auditing  of  FMIS  renovation  assisted \nunder the Project, which is undertaken by NVC in liaison with the separate technical assistance \nto establish and operate technical auditing in the rural infrastructure sector (footnote 16).    \n\nc. \n\nTraining \n\nThe  Project  will  provide  training  for  institutional  strengthening  in  various  public  and \n30. \nprivate institutions involved in the project activities, including training for operating staff as well \nas for institutions and trainers to impart relevant training activities.22 Such training will enhance \nskills  for  managing  participatory,  socially  inclusive  FMIS  development;  WUA  mobilization; \nresettlement;  environmental  management;  improved  design  and  construction  management; \nagriculture  and  social  development;  and  quality  control.  The  consultant  team  will  improve  the \nexisting  capacity  development  plans  of  DOI  while  addressing  issues  of  gender  inequality  and \nenabling women to effectively articulate their needs, and will arrange for and supervise training.  \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n31. \nThe  Project  has  several  features  to  enhance  irrigated  agriculture  development  and \npoverty  reduction  through  policy  and  institutional  reforms,  and  strengthening  participatory \nservice delivery with enhanced quality control mechanisms: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  Project  will  put  into  operation  key  principles  of  the  2002  NWRS  and  the  2003 \nIrrigation  Policy,  in  particular  participatory  and  sustainable  irrigation  effectively \nintegrated  with  agriculture  programs  that  have  an  enhanced  pro-poor  focus,  and \npromote  due  representation  of  women  and  other  vulnerable  people  in  WUAs  and \ndelivery  of  targeted  support  to  them.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  with  specific \ninstitutional  reform  actions  owned  by  DOI  to  fully  implement  those  principles,  by \npursuing improvement in staff resources, skills, and management capacities. \n\nThe Project will promote irrigated agriculture development by preparing district-level \nstrategies  and  subproject-level  comprehensive  agriculture  development  plans  to \naddress  local  production  and  marketing  constraints,  to  be  implemented  with \nmonitorable  targets.  The  Project  will  also  establish  self-sustaining  extension \nmechanisms  within  WUAs  by  developing  in-house  extensionists,  and  applying  cost \nrecovery norms in extension programs to carry on generations of demonstrations. \n\n                                                 \n22 For  this  purpose,  the  Project  will  support  development  of  training  programs  provided  through  the  designated \n\ninstitutions, e.g., concerned divisions of DOI and DOA, Nepal Staff College, and Nepal Engineering College.  \n\n\f10 \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe  Project  will  improve  quality  control  mechanisms.  Its  internal  quality  control \nsystem will ensure that when subprojects are implemented, there will be progressive \nachievement  of  the  predefined  targets  at  each  step,  and  in  line  with  the  absorptive \ncapacity of the local institutions. The system's operation is further scrutinized through \nregular external technical auditing by NVC. \n\nThe Project will empower WUAs to progressively take on implementation roles while \ntransforming  the  line  agency  roles  to  facilitation  and  technical  support.  WUAs  are \nentrusted to endorse key subproject decisions, monitor the delivered service quality, \nand implement the increasing number of civil works within their enhanced capacity. \nWUAs are further trained to facilitate farmer communication with service providers, to \nreach better deals collectively, and to improve provider accountability.   \n\nD. \n\nCost Estimates  \n\n32. \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  about  $38.6  million  equivalent,  of  which  $12.8 \nmillion (33%) represents the foreign exchange cost and $25.8 million equivalent (67%) the local \ncurrency  cost  (Table  1),  including  taxes  and  duties  of  $5.5  million.

The  ADB  loan  will  finance  $8.4  million  equivalent \n(66%) of the foreign exchange cost including interest charge and $11.6 million equivalent (45%) \nof  the  local  currency  cost.  The  OPEC  Fund  is  requested  to  finance  about  18%  of  the  Project \ncost.  The  ADB  and  OPEC  Fund  will  jointly  finance  the  irrigation  and  associated  infrastructure \nsubcomponent, and the latter will finance $4.1 million (32%) of the foreign exchange cost and \n$2.9  million  equivalent  (11%)  of  the  local  cost.  The  Government  will  provide  $9.4  million \n\n\f11 \n\nequivalent to cover about 24% of the total project cost, comprising $0.3 million equivalent (2%) \nof  the  foreign  exchange  cost  to  cover  the  interest  charge  for  the  OPEC  Fund  loan  and  $9.1 \nmillion  equivalent  (35%)  for  project  staff,  taxes  and  duties,  and  part  of  the  construction.  The \nbeneficiary farmers will contribute $2.2 million equivalent (6% of the project cost) in the form of \nlabor, cash or in kind. The financing plan is in Table 2.

The Ministry of Water Resources (MOWR) will be the \n34. \nExecuting  Agency,  and  will  carry  out  its  Project  implementation  responsibilities  through  DOI. \nWithin this framework, the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MOAC) will implement the \nagriculture  component  through  its  delegated  authority  to  DOA,  DDCs,  and  NARC.  Project \nmanagement will be integrated into the regular setup of those organizations. The CPMO is set \nup  under  the  director  general  (DG)  of  DOI.  A  qualified  class  I  senior  engineer  having \nmultidisciplinary  experience  and  skills  will  head  the  CPMO  as  project  director,  with  staff \nassigned from DOI, DOA, Water and Energy Commission Secretariat (WECS), and Department \nof  Local  Infrastructure  Development  and  Agriculture  Roads  (DOLIDAR). 24  The  CPMO  is \nresponsible for facilitating technical support and managing project implementation at the central \nlevel.  Activities  facilitated  include  (i)  endorsing  district  strategies,  SIP,  and  detailed  design;  (ii) \nmanaging  databases  such  as  the  FMIS  inventory;  (iii)  imparting  national-level  training;  (iv) \nmanaging environmental issues; and  (v) implementing relevant policy and institutional actions. \nFor  project  management,  the  CPMO  will  (i)  manage  an  overall  implementation  plan,  annual \nwork plans, and budgets; (ii) maintain financial accounts; (iii) prepare periodic progress reports; \n(iv)  monitor  and  support  field  operations;  and  (v)  supervise  cross-cutting  issues  including \ngender, indigenous peoples, and resettlement. Outside the CPMO, NVC will undertake external \ntechnical auditing of the project works. The organization chart is shown in Appendix 7.  \n\n35. \nTo  provide  overall  policy  guidance  and  undertake  necessary  coordination,  a  project \nsteering  committee  (PSC)  will  be  formed.25 The  secretary  of  MOWR  will  chair  the  PSC,  which \n                                                 \n23 If the OPEC Fund loan is not available by 15 July 2005, the Government and ADB will agree on reductions in the \n\nscope of work sufficient to cover the shortfall.  \n\n24 Including a full-time class II DOI engineer; a class II DOA extension specialist; five class III DOI officers assigned \n\nfor planning, design, irrigation management, environment, and land issues, among others.   \n\n25 The PSC will include MOAC; Ministry of Finance; Ministry of Local Development; Ministry of Women, Children, and \nSocial  Welfare;  MOWR,  National  Planning  Commission;  WECS;  NARC;  and  the  relevant  departments  including \nDepartment of Hydrology and Meteorology. ADB staff and ISPM consultants will be invited as observers.  \n\n\f12 \n\nwill  meet  at  least  once  a  year,  with  the  project  director  as  member  secretary.  The  project \nappraisal committee (PAC) will be set up to approve individual SIPs. The DG of DOI will chair \nthe PAC, with the director of Agriculture Extension in DOA, all deputy DGs in DOI as members, \nthe  team  leader  of  the  ISPM  consultants  as  adviser,  and  the  project  director  as  secretary.  In \naddition,  a  stakeholder  group  will  be  established  to  coordinate  and  exchange  information  on \nsector reforms and programs supported by external funds. The group will be chaired by the DG \nof  DOI  and  include  members  of  the  PSC,  external  funding  agencies,  National  Federation  of \nIrrigation Water Users Associations, Nepal (NFIWUAN), and relevant research organizations. \n\n36. \nAt  the  regional  level,  the  RPSU  will  be  placed  in  each  Regional  Irrigation  Directorates \n(RID) of DOI, with assigned staff from RID and Regional Directorate of Agriculture (RDA). The \ndirector of RID will head RPSU as project manager for the concerned region. The RPSU will be \nresponsible  for  (i)  managing  individual  subproject  implementation,  annual  work  plans  and \nbudgets  with  reporting  from  the  SMU  on  cost  estimates,  tenders,  and  contract  variations;  (ii) \ncontrolling  subproject  quality  through  monitoring,  support,  and  verifying  implementation  by \nfielding mobile RPSU teams comprising its staff and ISPM consultants (and staff assigned from \nDOI offices, private service providers, and NGOs as needed to supplement human resources);26 \n(iii)  supervising  resettlement  and  environmental  management  with  ISPM  consultants;  and  (iv) \nrecruiting private service providers and/or NGOs for preparing SIP and undertaking resettlement \nand social mobilization activities, while liaising with the CPMO for their respective activities.  \n\n37. \nFor  day-to-day  subproject  implementation,  an  SMU  will  be  established  in  each  district. \nThe chief of the concerned irrigation development division or subdivision (IDD/IDSD) will head \nthe SMU as subproject manager of the district. For districts where no IDD/IDSD exists, another \nIDD/IDSD  staff  member  will  be  assigned  as  deputy  subproject  manager  and  work  full-time  for \nthe SMU. The SMU will also be supported by an agriculture development officer in the District \nAgriculture  Development  Office  (DADO),  a  managerial  representative  from  DDC,  and  other \ndepartments relevant to the activities included in the SIP. 27 The SMU will undertake all the field \nactivities  of  the  Project  from  subproject  identification  to  monitoring  of  completed  schemes,  by \nmobilizing  and  supervising  the  staff  of  the  concerned  public  and  externally  contracted  agents \nincluding  private  service  providers,  NGOs,  and  contractors.  They  will  also  organize  regular \nSMU-WUA meetings for joint decision making and monitoring of project activities.  \n\n38. \nSupport for Devolution of FMIS Development Operations. The LSGA envisages the \ndevolution of FMIS interventions to LGIs. The new 2003 Irrigation Policy has acknowledged that \ndevelopment  works  for  small  FMIS  will  be  the  responsibility  of  LGIs. 28 However,  necessary \nhuman resources and capacities in DDCs and its district technical offices (DTOs) are still in a \nformative  stage,29 and  DTOs  still  cannot  meet  the  procedural  and  output  requirements  of  the \nProject. New roles and relationships between DOI and DDC/DTO are also required for quality \ncontrol, technical backstopping, and capacity development. As a step to promote the devolution \nprocess,  the  DDCs  with  small  feasible  FMIS  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  those  under \nthe  Project,  once  the  necessary  irrigation  implementation  team  can  be  formed.  The  Team  will \ncomprise  a  class  II  or  III  engineer  and  overseers  in  the  DTO  irrigation  section,  who  may  be \nassigned by IDD/IDSD from their staff, with DDC concurrence, along with an account officer and \na  social  mobilizer.  Implementation  will  be  supervised  by  the  SMU  subproject  manager.  The \n                                                 \n26 Three  mobile  teams  will  be  formed  in  each  RPSU:  two  for  planning,  WUA  strengthening,  and  other  support \n\nservices, and one for implementing civil works. \n\n27 An administrative staff and accountant will also be assigned to the SMU to keep track of all project activities and \nexpenditures by all agencies on a weekly basis, which will be used as a basis for reimbursing the expenditures.  \n28 Most of FMIS taken up under the SISP were medium-scale, i.e., more than 25 ha in the hills and 200 ha in the terai.   \n29 DTO, responsible for rural roads, water supply, and other infrastructure, has up to 10 staff positions in each district. \n\nExisting staffs are mostly seconded from DOLIDAR, and there are many vacancies.  \n\n\f13 \n\nconcerned  DDCs  will  enter  into  a  project  agreement  with  MOWR  to  delineate  specific \nimplementation arrangements. On the other hand, DDCs lacking human resources may request \nDOI to undertake small FMIS subprojects on their behalf. Based on the initial implementation, a \ndevolution action plan will be prepared at midterm review (MTR) and will be operated thereafter.  \n\n39. \nAs  for  agriculture  extension,  DADOs  have  been  placed  under  the  DDCs  following  the \n2002  DAIP,  along  with  other  services.  Thus,  district-level  programming,  implementation,  and \nexpenditure authorities are delegated to DDCs. While the SMU will design and arrange for the \ndelivery  of  agriculture  extension  and  other  services  through  the  existing  DADO  and  other \nsubject  matter  offices,  the  DDC  will  take  due  roles  in  this  process  in  accordance  with  the \nframework  of  LSGA  and  DAIP,30 with  DOA  doing  technical  backstopping  and  quality  control. \nThe  concerned  DDCs  will  also  enter  into  a  project  agreement  with  MOAC.  Overall,  these \narrangements will be further assessed and refined during project implementation.   \n\n40. \nSubproject  Selection  and  Implementation.  Subproject  selection  criteria  are  given  in \nAppendix 8. The key criteria are a high proportion of smallholder-operated land, self-sustaining \nO&M  records,  enrollment  by  the  majority  of  farmers,  economic  viability,  and  minimal  negative \nenvironmental  and  social  impacts.  Priority  is  given  to  areas  of  high  poverty  incidence. \nImplementation  procedures  are  in  Appendix  9,  and  details  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  D. \nThey  follow  the  steps  for  (i)  identification,  screening,  feasibility  study,  and  SIP  preparation  by \nSMU  for  PAC  approval; 31 (ii)  WUA  institutional  development  and  signing  of  implementation \nagreement  after  WUA  achieves  the  set  targets;  (iii)  WUA  beneficiary  contribution  and \nconstruction works managed by SMU and certified by the RPSU; (iv) agriculture and livelihood \nsupport  arranged  by  the  SMU;  (v)  postconstruction  O&M  training  arranged  by  the  SMU  and \nprogram  completion  confirmed  by  WUA;  and  (vi)  postcompletion  monitoring  by  WUA  and  the \nSMU. NGOs, COs, and private service providers will be engaged to support the process.  \n\n41. \nGovernance  and  Anticorruption.  Good  governance  is  a  critical  element  for  ensuring \ninclusive FMIS renovation while delivering and sustaining intended benefits. Strengthening the \nservice delivery and management capacity at line agency, DDC, and WUA levels, and using a \nparticipatory approach will ensure transparency and accountability. Subproject activities will be \nendorsed  by  WUA  and  overseen  by  the  CPMO  through  the  RPSU  and  its  mobile  teams \nincluding ISPM consultants and individually recruited monitors, with full disclosure of subproject \nexpenditures  at  DDC  and  WUA  notice  boards.  WUAs  will  be  informed  of  their  rights  and \nresponsibilities, including monitoring of delivered program quantity and quality\u2013an approach that \nhas proven effective in ensuring work quality in SISP\u2013and the grievance communication system \nto  the  concerned  DDC  and  RPSU  to  redress  any  problems  encountered  at  field  level.  The \nProject  also  provides  consulting  services \nfinancial \nmanagement  systems  at  CPMO,  RPSU,  SMU,  and  DDC  levels,  based  on  the  financial \nmanagement  assessment  made  during  the  PPTA.  Furthermore,  external  and  independent \ntechnical  auditing  by  NVC  will  oversee  and  advise  on  technical  and  financial  quality  at \nsubproject identification, planning and design, implementation, and O&M stages.   \n\nto  support  and  oversee  stringent \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n42. \nThe  implementation  period  will  be  7  years,  starting  from  April  2005  (Appendix  10).  For \neffective  dissemination  of  improved  arrangements,  the  Project  will  start  with  a  cluster  of  up  to \nfive  districts  in  each  region,  where  sample  subprojects  will  be  selected  and  prepared  with  on-\n                                                 \n30 There are currently no elected representatives in DDCs since July 2002 when the terms of elected officials expired \nand new elections were cancelled. At present LGI and line department representatives perform DDC functions.    \n31 Initially,  SIPs  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval.  Once  it  has  been  established  that  SIPs  have  achieved  the \n\ndesired level of quality, they will be retained in the CPMO for use by ADB during review missions. \n\n\f14 \n\nsite training of SMU staff in the cluster. After SIP is prepared and WUA is strengthened there, \nRPSU will start the same process in the next cluster. Seven clusters will cover all the districts. \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n43. \nGoods  and  related  services,  and  civil  works  to  be  financed  from  the  ADB  loan  will  be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. 32 As contracts are expected to \nbe  very  small,  international  contractors  are  not  likely  to  be  interested  and  international \ncompetitive  bidding  will  not  be  required.  Equipment  and  materials  as  well  as  service  vehicles \npackaged  and  valued  at  less  than  $100,000  equivalent  may  be  procured  by  direct  purchase \nprocedures. Civil works will be procured through local competitive bidding.33 Simple civil works \ncontracts costing less than NRs2.5  million (about $33,000) may be awarded to the concerned \nregistered  WUAs.  Contractors  must  have  satisfactory  postqualification  records  that  will  be \nannually updated by RID. Indicative contract packages are shown in Appendix 11.  \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n44. \nThe  Project  will  require  consulting  services  for  improved  subproject  management  with \non-the-job  training,  technical  support,  and  support  for  quality  control.  A  total  of  55  person-\nmonths of international and 519 person-months of domestic consulting services will be acquired \nthrough  a  firm.  The  terms  of  reference  are  outlined  in  Appendix  12  and  detailed  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  E.  The  consultants  will  be  selected  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging \ndomestic  consultants,  through  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedures.  The  Government \nwill undertake advance action in recruiting consultants. The Government has been advised that \napproval  of  advance  action  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the  Project.  In  addition,  the \nservices  of  NGOs,  COs,  and  private  firms  and  individuals  are  required  to  carry  out  project \nactivities  including  district  irrigated  agriculture  strategies,  participatory  rapid  rural  appraisal, \nfeasibility  studies,  SIP  preparation,  WUA  mobilization,  construction  supervision,  agriculture \ndevelopment  and  livelihood  enhancement  activities,  support  for  O&M  processes,  resettlement \nmanagement,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E).  Technically  qualified  domestic  service \nproviders will be engaged, using selection procedures acceptable to ADB.  \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n45. \nThe  Government  will  establish  two  project  accounts  at  the  Nepal  Rastra  Bank  (NRB) \nafter the loan agreement becomes effective: one for agriculture extension and research, and the \nother  for  irrigation  and  other  development  support.  Proceeds  from  the  ADB  loan  funds  will  be \nmaintained in a separate bank account with NRB and will only be used to pay ADB's share of \neligible project expenditures. Funding for irrigation will be channeled into the project operating \naccounts  for  CPMO,  RPSU,  and  SMU  for  subprojects  implemented  by  the  SMU,  and  into  the \naccounts for DDC (through the district development fund) for small subprojects implemented by \nDDC.  Funding  for  agriculture  will  be  channeled  into  the  project  operating  accounts  for  DOA, \nNARC, RDA, and DDC (through the district development fund).  \n\n46. \nADB funding of the Project will be periodically disbursed from the ADB loan account into \na subaccount of the project account for irrigation, which will operate as an imprest account for \nthe  ADB  funding.  The  imprest  account  will  be  managed  by  DOI/CPMO  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (January 2001), and detailed arrangements agreed to by \n\n                                                 \n32 Nepal\u2019s Public Works Directive for procurement procedures was reviewed by ADB and found acceptable.  \n33 Civil works contracts costing $50,000 or less will be awarded on a post-facto review basis. \n\n\f15 \n\nthe  Government  and  ADB.  The  initial  amount  of  the  loan  proceeds  released  to  the  imprest \naccount will not exceed 6 months of estimated expenditures and not more than 10% of the total \nloan amount. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures (SOE) procedures will be used for reimbursing \neligible  expenses  and  liquidating  advances  from  the  imprest  accounts  for  individual  payment \ntransactions  not  exceeding  $50,000.  Direct  payment  procedures  will  be  used  for  expenditures \nincurred in contracts for consulting services.  \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n47. \nDOI/CPMO will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify the goods \nand  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  the  financing  resources  received, expenditures \nincurred  for  the  Project,  and  the  use  of  local  funds,  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted \naccounting principles. The project accounts and related financial statements will be compiled by \nDOI/CPMO and audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. The annual audit \nwill include the audit of the imprest account and SOE procedures, and a separate audit opinion \non the use of the imprest account and SOE procedures should be included in the annual audit \nreport. The audited accounts, audit report, and related financial statements will be submitted to \nADB not later than 9 months after the close of the fiscal year to which they relate. The CPMO \nwill  also  prepare  and  submit  quarterly  progress  reports.  A  project  completion  report  will  be \nprepared and submitted to ADB within 3 months after physical completion of the Project. \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n48. \nProject  performance  M&E  will  be  carried  out  by  the  CPMO.  The  M&E  system  will \ncomprise (i) subproject-level baseline data collected during SIP preparation and kept in the M&E \nsection  of  DOI;  (ii) \nimplementation-related  monitoring  of  subproject  preparation  and \nimplementation status, collected and reported by SMU and managed by RPSU and CPMO; and \n(iii)  postcompletion  impact  data,  to  be  collected  and  reported  by  WUAs  and  maintained  in  the \nM&E  section  in  DOI.  The  system  will  establish  a  set  of  monitorable  indicators  including  the \nimpacts disaggregated by gender, ethnicity, caste, landholding size, and tenancy status. WUAs \nwill be trained to monitor their performance, which will be verified by the concerned IDD/IDSD \nduring the performance audit. Within this framework, the CPMO will improve the management \ninformation  system  with  the  support  of  ISPM  consultants  within  1  year  of  loan  effectiveness, \nwhich  will  be  consistent  with  a  participatory  and  gender-sensitive  performance  monitoring \nsystem  in  ADB.  (The  outline  framework  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  F).  The  CPMO  will \nprepare  and  submit  annual  benefit  monitoring  reports  to  ADB.  A  detailed  study  will  be \nconducted  to  review  project  progress  before  the  MTR.  The  CPMO  will  complete  an  impact \nevaluation study in preparing the project completion report. \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n49. \nADB will review the Project at least twice a year. The regular project reviews will assess \nthe performance of DOI and other institutions with respect to the Project; implementation of the \npolicy  and  institutional  action  plans,  loan  covenants,  and  gender  action  plan;  and  physical \nprogress  of  project  implementation.  A  comprehensive  MTR  in  year  3  will  evaluate  (i)  project \nprogress including design, stakeholder participation, quality of SIP, WUA strengthening, design, \nconstruction, and agriculture and livelihood enhancement services; (ii) economic, social, gender \nand environmental impacts and management; (iii) effectiveness of the project management and \nimplementation  arrangements;  (iv)  progress  on  policy  and  institutional  actions  enumerated  in \nthe policy matrix; and (v) future implementation plan and targets. Appropriate adjustments to the \nproject design and implementation arrangements will be made as necessary. \n\n\f16 \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Impacts \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nAt full development, the Project will rehabilitate 25,500 ha of low-productivity FMIS and \n50. \nirrigate an additional 8,500 ha of previously rain-fed land. About 270,000 people will benefit from \nimproved livelihood. The main quantifiable benefits will be the incremental agriculture production \nbrought about by a more reliable water supply during the monsoon season and the expanded \nwinter  and  spring  irrigated  area.  The  generated  incremental  labor  demand  will  particularly \nbenefit the poor. Major quantifiable benefits are shown in Appendix 1. Non-quantifiable benefits \ninclude  operation  of  sound  service  delivery  systems  for  FMIS  renovation  and  improved  sector \ngovernance promoted through sector-wide policy and institutional reforms. \n\n51. \nEconomic  and  financial  analyses  were  carried  out  for  three  sample  subprojects  to \nevaluate  the  returns  on  project  investments  (summarized  in  Appendix  13  and  detailed  in \nSupplementary Appendix  G). The Harinmari subproject in Mahottari District in the terai covers \n255 ha while the Talkharka and Inglakhola subprojects in Ilam District in the hills cover 210 ha \nand 178 ha, respectively. All have year-round irrigation opportunities in the basin, and cropping \nintensity  is  expected  to  rise  to  around  200%  when  some  70%  of  land  in  winter  and  30%  in \nspring will be irrigated, in light of the existing cropping pattern and farmer willingness survey.34 \nThe estimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 23% for Harinmari, 24% for Talkharka, \nand  25%  for  Inglakhola.  Sensitivity  analyses  to  test  the  impacts  of  a  range  of  risks  including \nadverse changes in investment costs, output prices, and yields showed that project returns are \ngenerally robust. The greatest risk appears to be reduction in price of cereal crops in Harinmari, \nbut even in this case a drop of 35% in the price of food grains will still produce an EIRR of 12%. \n\nB. \n\nHousehold and Poverty Reduction Benefits \n\nThe Project will have direct positive poverty  reduction impacts on income, employment \n52. \nopportunities  including  those  for  tenant  farming  (arising  from  labor  constraints  experienced  by \nlarger farmers), and food security. According to the socioeconomic survey, poverty incidence in \nthe three subproject areas is 54\u201362%, with the national ethnic minority population accounting for \nthe  majority  of  beneficiaries  cutting  across  all  farm  size  categories.35 Anticipated  per  hectare \nincremental incomes for small farmers are in the range of 60\u201380% of without the Project levels. \nDistribution  analysis  indicates  that  the  poor  may  attain  a  total  of  about  39\u201351%  of  direct \nbenefits. They will also have greater food security, i.e., the percentage of food grain production \nagainst  house  consumption  for  small  farmers  will  improve  from  90\u2013165%  to  150\u2013240%  in  the \nirrigated area, and from 45\u201380% to 130\u2013145% in the currently rain-fed area.  \n\nC. \n\nGender and Social Strategy  \n\n53. \nIn irrigation systems, access to water is closely related to the social context and power \nstructures. Differential access reflects existing social relationships, in terms of caste or ethnicity \nand gender. While physical FMIS improvements give an opportunity to establish equal rights to \nirrigation water use through collective works, this has not received due attention. This is due to \nthe subordination of strengthening WUAs to construction work, with the erroneous assumption \nthat  physical  improvement  will  induce  the  necessary  user  capacity  to  manage  the  renovated \n\n                                                 \n34 Expected  impacts  in  terms  of  changes  in  cropping  pattern,  intensity,  and  yields  were  cross-checked  with  those \nobserved in FMIS in previous projects. Comparable levels were assumed for the purpose of the economic analysis. \n35 Most farmers are near poor if not poor, with less than 20\u201330% having a net income more than double the calorie-\n\nbased poverty line (equivalent to $0.4 per capita per day), and are vulnerable to calamities.    \n\n\f17 \n\nsystems.  In  addition,  poverty  has  forced  male  migration  and  created  new  challenges  in  the \ndistribution  of  water  use  rights.  The  Project  will  promote  new  approaches  to  more  equitable \nresource  distribution  and  modification  of  gender  relations.  They  include  (i)  policy  measures  to \nequalize  opportunities  and  access  to  irrigation; (ii)  increase  in  WUA  capacity  to  promote  good \ngovernance  such  as  representation,  participatory  decision  making,  and  equitable  benefit \ndistribution;  (iii)  specific  actions  and  programs  that  target  women  and  disadvantaged  groups; \nand (iv) compliance with social safeguard measures before initiating any construction work.  \n\nSince  women  make  up  the  bulk  of  farm  labor  with  a  decision-making  role  in  family \n54. \nagriculture  activities,  the  role  of  women  in  WUAs  will  be  enhanced  to  maximize  irrigation \nbenefits.  The  Project  will  focus  on complementarity  and  reciprocity  between  men  and  women, \nidentifying  barriers  that  may  negatively  affect  women\u2019s  ability  to  interact  as  equal  partners.  In \nline  with  the  2003  Irrigation  Policy,  the  Project  will  (i)  promote  at  least  33%  women\u2019s \nparticipation in WUAs; (ii) assist DOI, DOA, and  DDC to implement a gender action plan;  (iii) \nrequire  all  training  activities  to  have  a  session  on  gender  issues;  (iv)  strengthen  linkages  with \nthe  Department  of  Women\u2019s  Development  and  DADO  for  WUA  training;  (v)  facilitate  gender \nmainstreaming activities by establishing gender focal points; (vi) require all data to be gender-\ndisaggregated;  and  (vii)  request  NGOs  to  have  50%  women  field  staff.  Appendix 14  gives  the \nsummary poverty analysis and social strategy and Appendix 15, the gender action plan. \n\nD. \n\nResettlement \n\n55. \n In accordance with ADB procedures for sector lending, three sample subprojects were \nstudied to assess land acquisition and resettlement needs of the Project in renovating FMIS.  A \nresettlement framework (RF) and sample resettlement plans (RPs) were prepared (summarized \nin  Appendixes  16  and  17,  with  full  documents  in  Supplementary  Appendixes  H  and  I).  by  the \nGovernment,  following  ADB\u2019s  involuntary  resettlement  and  other  social  safeguards  policies. \nSubproject  implementation  will  generally  require  the  use  of  land  for  widening  and  expanding \ncanals, although the scope is limited due to strip acquisition. Under the Project, the RF will be \nfollowed, and all affected persons will be entitled to compensation for land taken for the purpose \nof the project interventions, for their lost assets; and incomes at replacement cost to improve or \nat  least  restore  their  pre-project  living  standards,  income  levels,  and  productive  capacity. \nExisting  social  practices,  however,  show  landowners  voluntarily  contributing  the  canal  land  in \nFMIS  construction  in  recognition  of  benefits  such  as  priority  access  to  irrigation  water  and \nincreased land price, against the insignificant impacts. Voluntary contribution may therefore be \nconsidered an acceptable option when agreed to by the concerned persons and confirmed by a \nthird  party.  The  RPSU  will  supervise  RP  preparation  and  implementation  by  the  concerned \nSMU, with support from the ISPM consultants and NGOs.  \n\nE. \n\nIndigenous Peoples \n\n56. \nIndigenous  peoples  issues  were  found  insignificant  in  the  three  sample  subprojects, \nwhere  the  beneficiary  group  comprises  an  ethnic  local  majority  but  a  national  minority. \nPreparing  indigenous  peoples  specific  actions  was  not  deemed  necessary.  The  Project  is \ndesigned to be inclusive as it targets areas with high percentages of ethnic groups. Where small \ndisadvantaged ethnic or caste groups are identified, ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples will be \napplied and will build on the organizational model of each ethnic group\u2019s FMIS. Safeguards for \ninclusiveness  include  subproject  selection  criteria  that  will  require  the  WUA  management \ncommittee to constitute the same proportion of its social profile as the population of the WUA or \nlarger. The feasibility study of the sample subprojects shows it unlikely that the project will have \nany negative impacts on ethnic minorities. However, sample indigenous peoples specific actions \n\n\f18 \n\n(IPSA)  was  prepared  as  a  precautionary  measure  that  will  be  integrated  in  the  SIP \n(Supplementary Appendix J). \n\nF. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n57. \nAn  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  carried  out  during  the  PPTA.  The \nsummary  IEE  is  in  Appendix  18.  (The  IEE  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  K.)  The  Project  will \nhave  overall  beneficial  impacts,  enhancing  agricultural  production  while  reducing  pressure  on \nthe  environment  through  reduced  use  of  wood  products  for  temporary  structures.  Potential \nnegative impacts identified include (i) reduced water availability to the downstream water users \nand  ecosystems,  and  possible  conflicts  among  water  users;  (ii)  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement; (iii) induced erosion and landslides along the canals; and (iv) impacts associated \nwith  increased  use  of  agrochemicals,  and  of  irrigation  water  that  may  cause  waterborne \ndiseases.  These  impacts  will  be  mitigated  by  (i)  avoiding  subprojects  that  affect  downstream \nusers  or  ecosystems  through  basin  water  assessment  and  user  consultation;  (ii)  operation  of \nagreed upon RF; (iii) slope protection with the bioengineering approach or avoiding schemes in \nlandslide  zones;  and  (iv)  promoting  environmentally  sound  agriculture  practices  and  hygiene \neducation. Under the Project, an IEE will be prepared for each subproject, and any short-term \nnegative \nthe  environmental  management  plan \nfollowing \n(Supplementary Appendix L).36 \n\nimpacts  will  be  mitigated \n\nG. \n\nRisks \n\nThe  Project  has  several  risks  that  could  adversely  affect  effective  implementation  and \n\n58. \nsustainable benefits. It has incorporated mitigating measures to the maximum extent possible. \n\n59. \nInsurgency. The ongoing insurgency presents a considerable risk. However, the Project \nhas  incorporated  such  specific  measures  that  have  proven  effective  in  pursuing  development \nworks  in  conflict  environments:  (i)  flexible  site  selection  following  local  conditions;  (ii)  careful \nsecurity  monitoring  with  staff  trained  to  work  with  insurgency;  (iii)  improving  community \ninfrastructure supported by genuine WUA interest, while mobilizing strong community support to \nand  trust  in  the  project  staff;  (iv)  fully  participatory  and  transparent  implementation  including \ndisclosure of financial information; (v) incorporating specific programs for ethnic minorities and \ndalit in the livelihood enhancement subcomponent; and (vi) increasing service delivery through \nlocal NGOs and consultants less vulnerable to conflicts. The Project will also start operating in \nareas  with  a  relatively  more  secure  environment  and  expand  coverage  while  establishing \nmodels  that  could  operate  in  more  conflict-affected  conditions.  Nevertheless,  seriously \nworsening  local  conflicts  (that  would  essentially  affect  all  development  programs)  may  still \ndisrupt the project activities and affect subproject implementation period and benefits, although \ncore subprojects have demonstrated robustness with delayed benefits.37 \n\n60.  WUA Sustainability. Ensuring WUA sustainability is critical to maintain benefits through \neffective  O&M.  Some  WUAs  may  become  less  active  when  the  routine  maintenance  needs \n(such  as  frequent  repair  of  diversion  works)  are  reduced  after  structure  improvement.  Their \ncapacity  to  cope  with  specific  maintenance  needs  that  arise  may  be  affected.  To  address  this \nrisk, the Project will select viable WUAs having a proven track record for sustained O&M, and \nprovide  due  capacity  strengthening  support  for  routine  O&M  and  for  their  development  from \nroutine maintenance groups to viable community agents to pursue agriculture development, i.e., \n\n                                                 \n36 IEEs  will  be  attached  to  SIPs  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  endorsement  at  the  initial  stages.  Once  the \n\nquality of IEEs is confirmed, they will be retained in CPMO for use by ADB during review missions.  \n\n37 They remain economically viable with full benefits delayed by over 7 years (Appendix 13). \n\n\f19 \n\nto promote efficient water use and improved cropping practices while facilitating the linkage to \nexternal service providers and marketing agents with collective bargaining power.  \n\n61. \nInteragency  Coordination  and  Governance.  Delivering quality services with effective \ninteragency coordination and governance is critical in sustaining project benefits by WUAs. This \nwill be addressed by strengthening the management, monitoring, and quality control systems of \nthe project institutions, and the participatory approach to project planning and implementation. \nInteragency  coordination  will  be  attained  through  district  SMUs  comprising  the  concerned \nagency  representatives  who  plan  and  manage  the  designated  activities  embodied  in  SIPs. \nProvision  of  individual  services  will  be  jointly  decided  in  regular  SMU-WUA  meetings  and \nmonitored by WUAs, under supervision by the RPSU and the ISPM consultants. The Project will \nalso apply external technical audits to monitor and advise on the quality of service.  \n\n62. \nImplementation  Delay.  The  Project  may  face  implementation  delay  due  to  the  lower-\nthan-expected performance of the field-level activities, including WUA development that may be \ndifficult to manage from outside, due to the demand-driven and self-help nature of the process. \nTo cope with the risk, the Project will identify WUAs with genuine interest and proven capacity \nfor  sustained  O&M,  and  will  have  a  larger  number  of  subprojects  at  the  preconstruction  stage \ncompared with the annual construction targets.  \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n63. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe  Government  will  undertake  all  time-bound  policy  and  institutional  actions  as \nspecified in Appendix 5, agreed upon with ADB.  \nThe Government will ensure that all subprojects meet, to the satisfaction of ADB, the \nselection  criteria  and  implementation  arrangements  and  procedures  as  specified  in \nAppendixes 7\u20139 and as agreed upon with ADB during appraisal. \nIf  cofinancing  by  OPEC  Fund  has  not  been  obtained  in  a  timely  manner,  the \nGovernment will adjust the scope and costs of the Project in agreement with ADB. \nBy the end of year 2 of loan effectiveness, the Government will have established a \nsufficient regular budget to support the rehabilitation of completed FMIS damaged by \nnatural  disasters  beyond  the  scale  envisaged  within  the  design  return  period.  The \nGovernment will ensure that the share of ADB funding will be phased out each year \nstarting from 50% in year 3 of loan effectiveness and reduced by 20% in year 5 and \nin  year  7,  respectively,  with  farmers'  contribution  fixed  at  20%  of  the  construction \ncost.  DOI  will  ensure  that  the  fund  will  be  allocated  on  the  basis  of  sufficient \nmatching fund provided by the concerned WUA from its emergency reserve fund.   \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities  are \nimplemented  in  accordance  with  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations  of  the \nGovernment, and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995), and the agreed-\nupon  RF  and  RP  (Appendixes  16  and  17).  DOI  will  not  approve  any  subproject \nunless the concerned RP as required has been submitted to and approved by  DOI \nand ADB. DOI will not award any contract unless the RP has been fully implemented.   \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  adequate  environmental  mitigating  measures  are \nincorporated  into  all  subproject  design,  construction,  operation,  maintenance  and \nmonitoring  arrangements  in  accordance  with  (a)  Environmental  Policy  of  the  Asian \nlaws  and \nDevelopment  Bank \n\nthe  Government's  environmental \n\n(2002), \n\n(b) \n\n\f20 \n\nregulations,  and  (c)  subproject  specific  environmental  assessment  and  review \nprocedures  and  arrangements  agreed  with  ADB.  DOI  will  ensure  that  IEEs  will  be \nincluded in the subproject feasibility study reports. When IEE requires preparation of \nan  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  report,  such  EIA  report  should  be \nendorsed by DOI and submitted to ADB for concurrence before subproject approval, \nwithout which no subproject will be approved by the Government.   \n\nto \n\n(vii)  Where \n\nissues  related \n\nidentified  during  project \nindigenous  peoples  are \nimplementation  and  subproject  preparation,  DOI  will  ensure  that  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nIndigenous  Peoples  will  be  closely  followed  and  the  measures  indicated  in  the \nindigenous peoples specific actions agreed upon with ADB is integrated in the SIPs.   \n(viii)  The  Government  will  ensure  (a)  achievement  of  at  least  33%  representation  by \nwomen  in  WUAs  on  average,  (b)  implementation  of  the  gender  action  plan  in \nAppendix 15, and (c) due representation of disadvantaged groups (ethnic minorities \nand dalit) in WUAs in accordance with the FMIS household distribution.   \n\nB. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\nIn  addition  to  the  general  conditions,  the  Government  will  have  established  the  CPMO \n\n64. \nand appointed the key staff before the loan becomes effective. \n\nC. \n\nConditions for Withdrawals from the Loan Account \n\n65. \nNo  withdrawals  from  the  loan  account  will  be  made  until  the  Government  will  have \nentered  into  a  contract  with  the  ISPM  consultants,  except  for  the  expenditures  for  equipment \nand  supplies,  training,  survey,  monitoring,  and  project  management  required  to  prepare  for \nproject implementation. No disbursement for/to DDC for their eligible expenditures will be made \nuntil  a  project  implementation  agreement  (DDC  agreement)  or  alternative  arrangements, \nacceptable to ADB, are established between MOAC and the concerned DDC for the agriculture \nextension  component,  and  between  MOWR  and  the  concerned  DDC  for  small  FMIS \nrehabilitation that is implemented by the DDC.   \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n\n66. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve  \n\n(i)  \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 13,615,000 to the \nKingdom of  Nepal for the Community-Managed  Irrigated Agriculture Sector Project, \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1%  per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter;

Policy-related Issues  \n  Project implementation should be conducive to the \n\n \n\nrelevant policy and institutional reforms and assist their \nprogress with monitoring and advisory support. (SISP)  \n\nB.  Project Institutions  \n1.  Department of Irrigation  \na.  DOI's capacity in promoting beneficiary participation \n\nneeded strengthening (BOISN). Its social staff \nresources are insufficient, and capacity in addressing \npoverty and social agenda needs strengthening (SISP). \n\n  Relevant policy and institutional reform agendas and \n\naction plans were agreed on and included as Appendix \n5, to be followed up during project implementation.  \n\na.  The Project will engage NGOs and COs to facilitate the \nWUA strengthening activities. Capacity development \nsupport will also be provided through consultants to \naddress the new poverty and social agendas.  \n\nb.  Monitoring and evaluation framework within DOI was \n\nweak (BOISN). In SISP, subproject quality control was \ninsufficient in initial years. Sufficient attention and \nresources should be provided in monitoring and \nevaluation (M&E) of completed schemes (SISP). \n\nb1. Quality control will be improved through (i) stronger \ninternal control with more intensive supervision, (ii) \nWUA empowerment, and (iii) external technical audit. \n\nb2. The Project will institutionalize benchmarking at sub-\nproject planning, and M&E of completed FMIS. \n\nc.  Inadequate linkages with DOA hampered integrated \nagriculture development (BOISN, RIP). Coordination \nwith providers of agricultural services remains an issue \n(ISP, ERIP, SISP). \n\nc.  The Project will ensure joint preparation of SIP that \n\nstipulates specific activities, schedule, and institutional \nresponsibilities, to be agreed to in writing by all the \nconcerned parties.  \n\n2.  Department of Agriculture  \n\nAgricultural extension staffs lack the ability to respond \nto the needs of local farmers (BOISN). DOA staff skills \nto form farmer groups remains weak, and staff may not \nbe readily available to provide timely service (SISP).  \n\nThe Project will form farmer extension groups within \nWUAs. It will promote the use of qualified local NGOs \nand private firms to provide extension services as \nappropriate, with support from the consultants. \n\n3.  Local Governance Institutions (LGIs) \n\nThe involvement of LGI representatives remained \nminimal, and needs to be enhanced following the 1999 \nLocal Self-Governance Act (SISP).   \n\nLGIs will participate in key processes such as sub-\nproject request and SIP agreement. They will also be \nauthorized to implement small schemes on a pilot basis. \n\n4.  Water User Associations \n\nWUAs have good track record and capacity to sustain \nFMIS. More roles may be delegated in implementing \nsubprojects while transforming the roles of line agencies \nas those of facilitation and technical support (SISP).   \n\nC.  Managing Subproject Development Cycle \n1.  Subproject Selection and Planning \na.  While SISP followed a demand-driven approach, \n\nsubproject identification was done on an ad hoc basis \nand without clear strategic guidance (SISP).  \n\nb.  Project planning should ensure sufficient beneficiary \n\nconsultation and realistic targets for cropping intensities \nand yields (BOISN, ERIP, SISP). \n\nWUAs will have increased roles, including endorsement \nof key decisions, implementation of small civil works, \nand agriculture extension through the trained in-house \nextensionists. They will also be trained to represent \nfarmer interests with collective bargaining power. \n\n \n \na.  The Project will define participatory FMIS development \nstrategy at district level to prioritize subprojects having \nhigh growth and poverty reduction potentials.  \n\n \na.  The Project will provide sufficient time and resources for \nthese processes, with the engagement of private firms, \nand technical guidance provided by the consultants. \n\nc.  More thorough environmental impact assessment is \n\nb.  The Project will institutionalize (i) preparation of an \n\nneeded in terms of water availability (and downstream \nimpacts) and hillside land stability (ISP, ERIP, SISP). \n\ninitial environmental examination for all subprojects, (ii) \nconsultation with downstream water users, and (iii) \nsubsoil investigation in hill areas. \n\n2.  Mobilization and Strengthening of WUAs \na.  WUA capacities need strengthening in efficient water \n\n \na.  This will be operated in all subprojects, with the \n\nuse, sufficient O&M, and higher agriculture productivity \n(BOISN, SISP).    \n\nengagement of NGOs and COs.    \n\n b.

WUA participation by women \nand vulnerable groups remained limited (SISP).  \n\nincorporated. The gender dimension is strengthened in \n(i) WUA membership, (ii) representation in decisions, \nand (iii) provision of services to target women. \n\n5.  Sustainable O&M \n\nWUA commitment, ability, and leadership are essential \nfor effective O&M (BOISN, RIP). Clear O&M plan \nshould be developed before handover (ERIP, RIP). \nSupervising completed FMIS with annual technical, \nsocial, and financial audit should be done (SISP).  \n\nWUAs will be trained starting at the inception stage, with \nthe establishment of an O&M plan. Monitoring of all \ncompleted FMIS will be institutionalized. WUAs will be \ntrained to effectively undertake postcompletion benefit \nmonitoring and reporting.    \n\nD.  Overall Project Management \n1.  SISP\u2019s operational manual provides effective arrange-  \nments for developing FMIS. In general, however, \ncompliance at the field level remained an issue (SISP).  \n\n1.   Operational manual will be revised to include specific \n\nperformance targets for each stage of subproject cycle, \nto be monitored through regular SMU-WUA meetings.   \n\n2.  Projects with flexible design and process approach are \n\nuseful to respond to local needs (BOISN). Too many \nsubprojects implemented in some districts were beyond \nthe existing staff resources (SISP).   \n\n2.    The number of subprojects in each district will be limited \nfollowing the capacities, performance, and resources. \nOutsourcing will also be arranged with effective quality \ncontrol.  \n\nE.

Under  the  recently  completed \nSecond Irrigation Sector Project (SISP), DOI played a lead role in implementation, responsibility \nfor  agriculture  extension  went  to  DOA,  and  WUAs  acted  as  recipient  of  services.  The  role  of \nLGIs  remained  nominal,  given  the  relatively  recent  process  of  devolution,  which  was \npromulgated in the 1999 Local Self-Governance Act (LSGA). Consulting services were used for \ninstitutional capacity strengthening, and monitoring and quality control of selected FMIS.  \n \nDOI.  DOI  is  responsible  for  planning,  implementing,  and  monitoring  and  evaluating \n2. \nirrigation  projects.  Under  the  director  general  are  four  technical  divisions  (planning,  design, \nmonitoring  and  evaluation;  surface  water  irrigation;  irrigation  management;  and  groundwater \nirrigation)  at  headquarters  and  five  regional  irrigation  directorates  (RID).  Under  RID  are  26 \nirrigation development divisions (IDDs), 20 irrigation development subdivisions (IDSDs), and 29 \nunit offices in districts with no IDD or IDSD. Each RID is headed by a class I regional director \nand  has  17\u201320  professional  staff  including  a  socioeconomist  and  an  agriculture  officer.  IDD \n(headed by a class II subdivisional engineer) and IDSD (headed by a class III engineer) have \nabout 18\u201320 and 9\u201310 professional staff, respectively, including one or two association officers \nresponsible  for  social  mobilization.  Overall,  DOI  has  a  total  of  1,930  posts.  About  42%  are \nnonprofessional officers.  \n\nIn FMIS interventions, IDDs/IDSDs are in charge of day-to-day implementation under the \n3. \nsupervision  of  RIDs,  while  DOI  takes  on  technical  backstopping  and  overall  management.  At \nfield  level,  engineering  capacities  for  planning  and  implementing  infrastructure  are  generally \nsufficient. However, nonengineering staff and skill are insufficient for WUA social mobilization.1 \nThere is also a need to operate effective mechanisms to ensure that IDDs/IDSDs (i) undertake \nsufficient  participatory  activities  in  planning  and  implementation,  including  the  supervision  of \ncontractor  works;  and  (ii)  coordinate  with  district  agricultural  development  offices  (DADOs)  for \ndelivering  agriculture  programs.  RIDs  also  need  to  be  provided  with  sufficient  resources  to \nproperly  supervise  IDD/IDSD  activities.  There  is  a  tendency  within  DOI  to  take  constructing \nstructures  as  the  objective,  rather  than  achieving  agriculture  production  targets  by  facilitating \nfarmers' efforts. \n \nDOA.  DOA has five regional directorates of agriculture (RDAs) and 75 DADOs in each \n4. \ndistrict.  Each  DADO  has  5\u20137  agricultural  service  centers  and  an  additional  5\u20137  agricultural \nservice subcenters, which provide extension services in the field. DADO is headed by a class I \nchief  officer  and  has  one  agriculture  development  officer  (class  II)  and  eight  subject  matter \nspecialists (class III). DADO delivers specific crop promotion programs that last about 2\u20133 years \nin  each  location.  In  general,  the  staff  have  sufficient  technical  know-how  on  modern  cropping \npractices, but their orientation and skills in social activities including forming farmer groups and \ndelivering and effectively disseminating services are generally insufficient. Monitoring also need \nstrengthening to ensure due service delivery to targeted farmers. \n                                                 \n1  IDDs/IDSDs  have  only  1\u20132  association  officers  to  cover  2\u20133  districts.  Their  incentives  (currently  ranked  in  the \n\nlowest non-gazetted class) and recognition within the office need upgrading based on performance.  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n29 \n\nLGIs.  The  1999  LSGA  defines  the  structures,  functions,  and  operating  mechanisms  of \n5. \nLGIs. The LSGA stipulates that DDCs will take over district-level development activities of line \nagencies by setting up sectoral units to work under DDC supervision (with the line agencies to \ntake  on  regulatory  functions,  technical  backstopping,  and  macrolevel  sectoral  programming). \nFollowing  the  Decentralization  Implementation  Action  Plan  (DIAP)  in  January  2002,  DADOs \nwere placed under the supervision of the concerned DDCs, although DDCs have been playing \nonly nominal roles to date.2 Decisions have also been made to establish district technical offices \n(DTOs)  to  cover  rural  roads,  small-scale  irrigation,  rural  water  supply,  and  other  district \ninfrastructure. Yet approved DTO staff members are still limited to 7\u201310 in each district and are \nmostly  seconded  personnel  from  the  Department  of  Local  Infrastructure  Development  and \nAgriculture Roads (DOLIDAR), and some 300 posts are vacant. \n \nPrivate  Sector  Organizations.  Government  technical  staffs  generally  lack  skills  to \n6. \nhandle social preparation activities such as group formation and participatory interventions. On \nthe other hand, private  sector providers including NGOs and community organizers (COs) are \neffective  in  facilitating  group  processes  involving  target  groups  such  as  women  and  poor \nhouseholds in a number of development works. There are also NGOs and private sector agents \nproviding  agriculture  extension  services.  In  the  irrigation  subsector,  DOI  engages  private \nconsultants for feasibility studies, designs and construction supervision; however, service quality \nis  not  necessarily  up  to  standard  and  calls  for  adoption  of  more  upgraded  and  low-cost \ntechnology  effectively  integrated  with  agriculture  and  social  planning.  In  general,  NGOs,  COs, \nand  other  private  sector  agents,  particularly  those  locally  based,  may  not  have  the  required \nskills, but their capacity can be built through training from national-level NGOs and consultants. \n \nWUAs.  WUAs are informal farmer irrigator groups that have evolved over generations, \n7. \nsince constructing irrigation facilities by mobilizing their own resources. Typical groups regularly \nelect  leaders,  hold  meetings,  and  have  working  rules  and  water-sharing  arrangements.  They \nhave  a  proven  track  record  of  sustained  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  and  have  the \ncapacity to do the same for the renovated FMIS. As farmers, they are also interested in getting \nessential inputs and necessary extension services. While WUAs are registered in DDCs when \nFMIS assistance is provided, most remain routine maintenance agents only, and some tend to \nbe less active where  O&M requirements declined  after structure improvement. There is scope \nfor sufficiently training them so that they can effectively liaise with input providers and marketing \nagents  with  collective  bargaining  power.  Their  capacity  also  needs  strengthening  to  meet  the \ninterests of the poor and vulnerable groups such as women.3  \n \nB. \n\nInstitutional Arrangements and Strengthening under the Project \n\n8. \nThe Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy and the 10th Five-Year Plan (2003\u20132007) \nhave  emphasized  rural-oriented  poverty  reduction  with  improved  service  provision  and \ngovernance  through  stronger  agency  coordination,  community  participation,  private  sector  and \nNGO engagement, and decentralization. The institutional arrangements of the Project will follow \nthese  principles  in  promoting  effective  FMIS  renovation.  Necessary  policy  and  institutional \nactions  will  also  be  pursued.  Consulting  services  for  institutional  strengthening  and  project \nmanagement (ISPM) are provided to implement the improved arrangements. \n\n                                                 \n2  There  are  no  elected  representatives  in  LGIs  since  2002  after  expiration  of  the  terms  of  the  elected  officials  and \ncancellation  of  new  elections.  While  DDCs  have  delegated  authorities  for  district-level  planning,  implementation, \nand expenditure, they are passed on to DADOs that continue to operate with linkage to the RDAs and DOA.  \n\n3  WUA  federations  have  also  been  formed  at  the  national  level  and  in  some  districts  with  international  NGO \nassistance. These federations take on active roles in information dissemination and WUA training, and as a lobby \nto monitor and promote effective FMIS program operations. \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n9. \nField-Level Implementation. Existing public organizations have institutional constraints \nin  staff  resources,  skills,  and  arrangements  for  (i)  agency  coordination,  (ii)  WUA  social \nmobilization,  (iii)  participatory  service  provision,  and  (iv)  monitoring  and  quality  control.  The \narrangements envisage implementation to be driven by the interest to improve FMIS agriculture \nproductivity  as  opposed  to  constructing  structures,  while  transforming  public  agencies  from \nimplementers to genuine facilitators. Specific measures include the following:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nCoordination. In each district, a subproject management unit (SMU) will be formed with \nthe  assigned  staff  of  IDD/IDSD,  DADO,  and  DDC,  to  plan  and  supervise  the \nimplementation  of  subprojects. 4  At  the  outset,  the  SMU  will  prepare  a  concise  but \ncomprehensive subproject implementation plan (SIP) that specifies individual programs \nincluding their schedules, institutional responsibilities, and output targets.5 The SMU will \nengage private firms to prepare SIPs using inputs provided by specialists (in IDD/IDSD \nand DADO) that the SMU designates as available, and through a consultative process.  \n\nWUA  social  mobilization. Activities following the work plan in SIP will be facilitated by \nlocal community organizers (COs) engaged by the SMU. Local NGOs will be engaged to \ntrain  and  support  the  COs.  WUA  federations  at  the  national  and  district  levels  will  be \nengaged to take on the NGO roles as appropriate, with capacity development support. \nBuilding  on  their  routine  O&M  roles,  WUAs  will  also  be  trained  to  facilitate  delivery  of \nagriculture inputs and services to drive the local agriculture development process.  \n\nParticipatory  implementation. Services are provided following the SIP and subproject \nwork plans prepared by SMU. To ensure participatory processes, WUAs will endorse the \nSIP  and  periodic  work  plans  including  detailed  design.  For  irrigation  works,  WUAs  will \nimplement simple structures with technical support by IDD/IDSD staff, and will be trained \nto monitor contractor works for complex structures. For agriculture and other programs, \nprivate sector or NGOs will be engaged to address constraints in DADO and IDD/IDSD.  \n\n(iv)  Monitoring and quality control. The SMU will regularly hold progress review meetings, \ninviting  WUAs  that  monitor  the  delivered  services.  For  quality  control  purposes,  the \nregional project support unit (RPSU) will field mobile teams including ISPM consultants \nto  verify  the  key  field  outputs  such  as  SIP.  RPSU  will  also  monitor  SMU  operation \nthrough regular management review (with SMU staff) and office inspection.6 Along with \nthese,  an  external  technical  audit  will  be  undertaken  through  the  National  Vigilance \nCenter.  \n\n \nLGI Roles  and Capacity  Strengthening. Institutional arrangements for the Project will \n10. \nstrengthen  the  roles  and  capacities  of  LGIs  in  particular  DDCs  to  implement  the  LSGA. \nSpecifically, DDCs will (i) arrange information campaigns to its members and WUAs, (ii) screen \nand  submit  WUA  subproject  requests  to  the  SMU,  (iii)  participate  in  preparing  the  SIP  and \nperiodical work plans, and (iv) include those plans in the district development plans and annual \nplans.  Steps  are  also  taken  to  progressively  devolve  small-scale  FMIS  interventions  to  DDCs \nthat have formed viable irrigation implementation teams with the support and supervision of the \nSMU  and  capacity  development  support  provided  by  ISPM  consultants  (para.  38,  main  text). \nServices such as agriculture extension, which were devolved to DDCs, will be provided through \n\n                                                 \n4  This  follows  the  arrangements  proven  effective  in  other  ADB-assisted  projects  for  livestock  development  and \n\ncommunity-groundwater development.    \n\n5  This  will  include  specific  arrangements  for  the  delivery  of  non-Project  assisted  services  such  as  fertilizer  and \n\n6  This will ensure that subprojects taken up in the SMU are in line with their absorptive capacity, and in accordance \n\ncertain varieties of improved seeds.  \n\nwith the stipulated procedures.  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n31 \n\nsubject matter offices in DDC such as DADO (which engages private sector agents and NGOs), \nbut DDCs will exercise their due authority under the DIAP to program and execute the services. \nThe  ISPM  consultants  will  provide  capacity  development  support  to  DDCs  and  DTOs  by \nproviding  orientation  and  on-the-job  training  for  the  specific  responsibilities.  District-level \ninstitutional arrangements will further be assessed and refined during project implementation to \nfurther advance the Government\u2019s devolution programs.  \n \n11. \n National-Level  Policy  and  Institutional  Development.  The  Project  will  support \nnational-level  policy  and  institutional  improvement  for  operating  improved  FMIS  renovation \nmechanisms. Specifically, the Project will advise on the ongoing reforms in water resources and \nagriculture, and assist in practical actions to improve FMIS development operations within DOI. \nSpecific actions are given in Appendix 5.  \n\nC. \n\nImpacts of Conflicts and Coping Measures \n\n12. \nThe ongoing insurgency poses a sizable risk that may delay project implementation. It is \nnot  possible  to  predict  the  location  and  timing  of  conflicts,  and  the  type  of  violence  and \ninsecurity.  There  are  also  uncertainties  regarding  the  attitudes  of  the  insurgents  although \ndevelopment activities to enhance the livelihood of the local population, particularly the poor, are \ngenerally  supported  and  implemented  in  conflict-affected  areas  with  the  assistance  of  several \naid  agencies.  Improving  community-based  irrigation  infrastructure  falls  under  this  category, \nwhere they are managed and driven by WUAs with genuine local interest. \n \n13. \n Under insecure conditions, some Government and LGI staff may face security risks as \nthey may be seen as representing security forces. They often are reluctant to travel away from \ndistrict headquarters. Movement of Government vehicles is also restricted, since they are often \nsubject to attack. The impacts can be mitigated by engaging persons who can work safely under \nsuch  environment,  e.g.,  locally  accepted  NGOs  and  private  service  providers,  in  lieu  of  the \nconcerned  Government/LGI  staff  for  field-level  implementation  activities.  However,  subproject \nplanning  and  quality  control  activities  may  still  be  affected,  as  they  need  more  competent \ntechnical  and  social  capacities  limited  to  central  based  NGOs  and  consultants,  who  are  more \nvulnerable under conditions that lack security.7 \n \n14. \nTo  cope  with  the  insurgency,  the  project  design  allows  flexible  subproject  selection \nfollowing  local  conditions.  It  also  envisages  taking  an  approach  that  has  proven  effective  in \nconflict  environments,  i.e.,  community-driven  and  transparent  approach  that  holds  project \ninstitutions  accountable  to  local  communities.  The  Project  will  initially  operate  in  areas  with  a \nmore secure environment; it will focus on staff training and progressively establish a model that \ncould  operate  under  conflict  situations,  while  duly  incorporating  measures  effective  in  conflict \nenvironments,  such  as  (i)  intensive  security  monitoring,  (ii)  training  project  staff  to  work  in \nconflict situations, and (iii) building strong trust in the project staff through close communication \nwith  the  local  communities.  Should  serious  conflicts  arise  in  any  area,  the  Project  will  apply  a \nflexible approach by modifying the implementation arrangements and engaging local NGOs and \nprivate  service  providers  in  lieu  of  affected  Government  or  LGI  staff,  and  pursue  appropriate \nalternative  measures  to  implement  activities  beyond  the  capacities  of  these  local  NGOs  and \nconsultants,8 in  consultation  with  the  concerned community.  On  the  basis  of initial  experience, \nthe Project intends to expand the areas of operation in more conflict-affected areas. \n\n                                                 \n7  The  Government  and  centrally  based  consultants  undertook  preparatory  fieldwork  with  the  support  of  the  local \n\nWUA representatives under the presence of some insurgents (in areas under UN security phase 3).   \n\n8  Examples  include  (i)  strengthening  the  capacity  of  local  NGOs  and  private  providers,  (ii)  taking  up  smaller  and \nstraightforward schemes, and (iii) establishing an environment where central-based agents can provide services. \n\n\f \n\n  \n\nPOLICY AND INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS AND IMPLEMENTATION MATRIX \n\nKey Issues and Actions \n1.

Those  having \nprospects for promoting year-round irrigation will be accorded high priority. \nThe subproject area has relatively equal land distribution, i.e., more than 40% of the \nbenefit  area  is  operated  by  marginal  and  small  farmers  (up  to  0.5  hectares  (ha) \nholdings in the hills and 1.0 ha in the terai), or by the smallest 70% of the beneficiary \nhouseholds. Preference will be given to subprojects with higher percentages of land \noperated by these farmers and to subprojects located in food-deficit areas.  \nThe subproject will have more than 50 beneficiary households1 and is not larger than \n1,000 ha, unless otherwise concurred in by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).2  \n(iv)  The  subproject  cost  must  not  exceed  $1,000/ha,  unless  otherwise  concurred  in  by \n\n(iii) \n\n(v) \n\nADB.  \nThe  farmers  must  have  established  a  water  user  association  (WUA)  that  has  been \noperating  and  maintaining  the  concerned  farmer-managed  irrigation  systems  (FMIS) \nas confirmed by annual resource mobilization for operation and maintenance (O&M) \n(through  labor  and  cash  contribution)  and  absence  of  intra-WUA  conflicts.  The \nfarmers  are  willing  to  mobilize  and  contribute  resources  (labor,  cash,  or  in  kind)  to \nimplement  the  subproject,  as  demonstrated  by  more  than  70%  of  the  beneficiary \nhouseholds  having  signed  off  on  the  subproject  request  with  assured  beneficiary \ncontribution. \n\n(vi)  The  concerned  WUA  has  provided  up-front  cash  contribution  of  at  least  NRs50  per \nhectare of its command area, established the emergency fund for nonrecurrent O&M \nworks with the said contribution, and agreed and increased it annually by contributing \nan  additional  amount  to  be  specified  in  the  subproject  implementation  plan,  but  not \nless than 0.5% of the subproject rehabilitation cost.   \n\n(vii)  The  subproject  will  not  have  any  major  negative  environmental  impacts  that  require \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  study,  including  any  negative  impact  on  other \nusers of the same source. Initial environmental examination has been undertaken and \napproved  after  consulting  the  beneficiaries  and  those  affected  by  the  project, \nconcluding \nis  environmentally  sound  and  any  negative \nconsequences can be mitigated. \n\nthe  subproject \n\nthat \n\n(viii)  The  subproject  will  not  involve  any  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement,  or \nboth.  In  the  event  that  land  acquisition  or  resettlement,  or  both  are  required  for  any \nsubproject,  resettlement  plans  will  be  prepared  and  implemented  following  the \nagreed-upon resettlement framework (Appendix 16) before initiating the tendering of \nthe civil works. \n\n(ix)  The  subproject  must  be  technically feasible,  financially  and  economically  viable  with \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  of  at  least  15%  (except  as  agreed  by  ADB  but  not \nless than 12%), and socially sound, requiring no or minimal involuntary resettlement. \nThe  subproject  will  not  have  any  previous  experience  of  major  investment  or \nrehabilitation  supported  by \nfunding  agencies,  or \nnongovernment organizations within the last 15 years. \n\nthe  Government,  external \n\n(x) \n\n                                                 \n1  Except for demonstration activities for innovative small-scale minor irrigation for the poorest. \n2  The Department of Irrigation (DOI) will submit the subproject implementation plan (SIP) to ADB for schemes larger \n\nthan 250 ha in the hills and 500 ha in the terai for information. \n\n \n\n\f

For  each  subproject, \nthe capacity of individual farm households to bear the additional on-farm costs associated with \nthe Project was assessed. The beneficial impacts of rehabilitated irrigation schemes, and all non-\nengineering support including agricultural extension on crop profitability are weighed against the \ncapital  costs  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs.  The  results  can  be  both \nrepresentative  and  indicative  of  the  remaining  sites.  Given  the  sector  approach  in  which \nsubprojects  with  possibly  wide  variations  will  be  selected  during  the  implementation  period, \nfinancial and economic assessment for the overall Project is not presented.  \n \nB. \n \nTo  determine  the  expected  direct  benefits  of  the  subprojects,  quantifiable  effects  are \n2. \nvalued by comparing the with- and without-Project scenarios. The input-output coefficient of farm \nproduction,  including  cropping  patterns,  crop  yields,  fertilizer  usage,  and  labor  costs  was \nestimated  based  on  farm-level  surveys  in  the  concerned  subproject  areas,  and  cross-checked \nwith the data reported in completed farmer-managed irrigation system (FMIS) projects in Nepal.1 \nAll subprojects analyzed were assumed to have an economic life of 20 years and to achieve the \nfull  benefits  in  the  third  year  after  civil  work  completion.  The  investment  and  O&M  costs  were \nestimated  based  on  the  field  survey  and  design  data.  The  overhead  costs  including  consulting \nservices, training, and administration were incorporated into the economic analysis. The analysis \nuses  a  world  price  numeraire,  and  economic  prices  for  traded  inputs  and  commodities  (rice, \nwheat, maize, and fertilizers) were based on the World Bank Commodity Price Projections. The \nprices of other crops and farm inputs were derived based on the market prices in the subproject \nareas in July 2003. Labor costs were shadow-priced at 0.80.   \n\nEstimated Benefits \n\nC. \n \nIncreased  Crop  Production  and  Associated  Benefits. As a result of improved FMIS, \n3. \ncrop  production  is  expected  to  increase,  because  of  (i)  reduced  risk  of  production  losses,  (ii) \nexpansion of command area, (iii) increase in yields, and (iv) changes in cropping intensities. The \nfragility of diversion structures made of earth, stones, or logs is a major factor constraining the \nproductivity  of  FMIS  during  the  monsoon,  as  the  structure  may  not  be  easily  rebuilt  after  it  is \nwashed  away  by  floods  and  before  the  subsequent  dry  spell.  An  improved  canal  network  will \nincrease conveyance capacity and distribution efficiency, thereby allowing the expansion of the \ncommand area. Crop yields are expected to increase because of (i) more reliable water supply, \n(ii)  increased  use  of  modern  inputs  (induced  by  stable  water  supply),  and  (iii)  provision  of \nextension and other support services. The Project will also increase cropping intensities in areas \nwhere  only  one  or  two  crops  are  planted  per  year  because  of  lack  of  water  in  the  dry  season. \nWith more reliable water supply, the farmers will intensify production of staple food crops while \nexpanding cash crops in response to existing local market opportunities. In the three subprojects \n(representing some 1.8% of the estimated project area), production of total food grains, potato, \nand other cash crops is expected to grow from 1,530 tons (t), 530 t, 170 t, respectively, to 2,360 \n\n                                                 \n1  While the Project aims  to achieve the high potential yield levels for the concerned crops (as reported by the Nepal \nAgriculture  Research  Council),  realistic  estimates  were  adopted  in  terms  of  the  assumed  changes  in  input  use, \nyields,  and  cropping  intensities  that  are  comparable  to  those  observed  in  other  FMIS  projects  (having  little \nagriculture extension and other support services provided) for the purpose of the analyses.   \n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nAssessment of Financial Returns \n\nt,  1,260  t,  and  520  t.  Increased  crop  production  will  lead  to  increased  labor  opportunities  (by \n46,000  person-days  in  the  three  subprojects)  and  improved  food  security  of  the  population \n(paras. 12\u201314).  \n \nReduced  Routine  Maintenance  Costs.  The  Project  will  reduce  the  annual  routine \n4. \nmaintenance costs of irrigation facilities substantially, since the existing temporary structures will \nbe  replaced  by  semi-permanent  or  permanent  structures.  The  need  for  repairing  collapsed \nsystems commonly required during the monsoon season for many FMIS will be reduced.2 \n  \n5. \nNonquantified  Benefits.  In  addition,  there  are  nonquantified  benefits,  including  (i) \nimproved FMIS planning system through district irrigated agriculture development strategies and \nindividual subproject implementation plans (SIPs); and (ii) improved irrigation and related service \ndelivery  mechanism  with  transparent  and  accountable  governance  through  empowered  water \nuser  associations  (WUAs)  and  local  governance  institutions  (LGIs),  and  regular  application  of \nexternal technical auditing. Benefits derived from strengthening policy, planning, and institutional \nframework will also have wider impacts at national and field levels. \n \nD. \n \n6. \nFarm budget analysis was conducted for typical farm households in the three subproject \nareas,  differentiating  currently  irrigated  and  non-irrigated  areas,  and  small,  medium-size,  and \nlarge  farm  households.3 The  gains  in  farm  net  income  as  a  result  of  the  Project  are  compared \nwith  the  farmers\u2019  share  of  investment  costs  (Table  A13).  The  annual  gains  with  the  Project \nexceed  the  one-time  investment  costs  for  all  categories  of  farm  households.  The  net  gain  with \nthe  Project  (NRs10,750\u201320,740  or  about  $139\u2013269  per  family  per  year)  represents  a  70\u201385% \nincrease in annual income on the average.4 The expected increase is higher for currently rain-fed \nareas, and reduces the income difference between the rain-fed and irrigated areas.  \n \nHarinmari  Subproject,  Mahottari  District,  Central  Development  Region  (Terai). The \n7. \nrehabilitation of the irrigation system will expand the irrigation area from 185 ha to 255 ha. The \narea is fully cultivated for paddy in the monsoon, whereas cropping is limited to some 40% and \n20%  of  the  area  in  winter  and  spring,  respectively,  due  to  water  unavailability  and  high \ndistribution loss. In winter, the cropping pattern is relatively diversified, with 40% of the cultivated \narea used for cash crops produced such as oilseeds, lentil, potato, and vegetables, whereas the \nspring  crop  is  mostly  dominated  by  paddy  and  maize,  with  a  small  fraction  of  land  (2.5%) \ncultivated for vegetables. The area has a large market surplus of food grains sold at the nearby \ndistrict markets easily accessed through a dust road and a national road, whereas most of other \ncrops are consumed locally within the area while small amounts of potato and other cash crops \nare also marketed out individually by farmers.5 The Project will generate several benefits. First, \nwater supply in the monsoon season will become more reliable as a result of the rehabilitation, \nleading  to  rice  yield  increases,  particularly  in  the  currently  rain-fed  area.  Second,  the  improved \n\n                                                 \n2  In addition to the labor requirements for routine O&M activities (that are reduced from the without-project level), the \nwith-project analysis included the maintenance costs corresponding to 5% of investment costs annually, to meet the \npossible future rehabilitation requirements of semi-permanent or permanent structures.  \n\n3   Small, medium-size, and large farmers are defined as those having landholdings of up to 0.5 ha in the hills and 1 ha \nin the terai, up to 1 ha in the hills and 3 ha in the terai, and over 1 ha in the hills and 3 ha in the terai, respectively.  \n4  As  a  matter  of  comparison,  a  separate  project,  ADB.  2000.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Kingdom  of  Nepal  for \nAgriculture  Sector  Performance  Review.  Manila  (TA  3536,  approved  on  13  November  2000)  reported  that  reliable \nirrigation  when  combined  with  improved  seeds  produces  a  net  margin  over  190%  higher  than  nonirrigated  rice  in \nNepal.   \n\n5  In general, cereals, pulses, and potato are purchased at farm gate by merchants acting as middlemen for mills and \n\n \n\nother processors, whereas vegetables are generally delivered to the district markets by farm families.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n47 \n\nTalkharka  Subproject, \n\nIlam  District,  Eastern  Development  Region \n\nsystem  will  increase  water  delivery  in  the  dry  season  on  additional  30%  and  15%  of  the \ncommand  area  in  winter  and  spring,  respectively,  thereby  increasing  the  overall  cropping \nintensity from 160% to 206%, a level observed in many FMIS in previous projects. The expanded \narea is assumed to have a similar cropping pattern that prevails at present. The yield levels are \nalso  expected  to  increase  with  increased  use  of  farm  inputs  promoted  through  agriculture \nextension and multiplication of food grain seed under the Project.6 As a result, the area will have \na large market surplus of potato and small surplus of vegetables.   \n \nThe subproject has 382 households, of which 33% are landless, 52% have a landholding \n8. \nof up to 1.0 ha, 11% with up to 3.0 ha, and the remaining 4% with 3 ha or more. Six household \nmodels  were  built  to  represent  the  major  subgroup  of  beneficiaries  categorized  by  landholding \nsize and by current access to irrigation. As shown in Table A13, all farmers will benefit from this \nsubproject,  with  an  average  annual  income  increase  of  NRs10,740  from  increased  crop \nproduction and on-farm and hired employment opportunities. All farmers can afford the required \ninvestment and O&M contributions that remain substantially lower than the incremental income.7  \n \n(Hills). \n9. \nRehabilitating the irrigation system will expand the irrigation area from 110 ha to 210 ha. Due to \nthe relatively high altitude, maize and millet are major crops in the monsoon season, accounting \nfor  73%  of  the  total  area,  followed  by  cardamom  and  potato.  Dry  season  cropping  (excluding \nperennial cardamom) is limited to 25% of the area in winter and 4% in spring due to the limited \ncanal conveyance capacity and high distribution loss. Wheat accounts for 60% of winter cropping \nand  the  rest  are  cash  crops  including  oilseeds,  potato,  and  vegetables.  Maize  is  the  dominant \ncrop in spring. Due to its location in the hills with regional food deficit, the farm gate prices of key \ninputs and outputs are higher by 10\u201325% compared with those in the terai. The subproject area \nproduces  a  market  surplus  of  food  grains  and  potato  sold  locally.  Some  products  such  as \ncardamom  are  sold  at  district  markets  through  a  4  km  footpath  and  its  connecting  national \nhighway. The subproject will make the water supply in the monsoon reliable, inducing farmers to \nadopt more intensive agriculture. Farmer surveys indicated the profitability of irrigated potato and \ncardamom, whose area is assumed to increase by up to 5% of the net cultivated area during the \nmonsoon.  The  subproject  will  also  expand  the  irrigated  area  on  an  additional  33%  of  the \ncommand area in winter and 7% in spring. Overall cropping intensity will increase from 131% to \n170%. The assumed cropping pattern for the dry season is similar to the current situation. The \nyield levels are expected to increase with increased use of farm inputs.8   \n \n10. \nThe  subproject  has  244  households,  of  which  9%  are  landless,  35%  with  a  landholding \nup to 0.5 ha, 19% up to 1 ha, and the remaining 37% with 1 ha or more. All farmers will benefit \nfrom  this  subproject,  with  an  average  income  increase  of  NRs20,740  annually  (Table  A13).  All \nfarmers will be able to pay for their share of the investment and O&M costs.  \n \nE. \n \n11. \nResults of the economic analysis show that the economic internal rates of return for the \nHarinmari,  Talkharka,  and  Inglakhola  schemes  are  23%,  24%,  and  25%,  respectively,  and  the \nnet  present  value  (NPV)  at  a  discount  rate  of  12%  ranges  from  NRs7.6  million  to  NRs11.0 \nmillion. Switching values were estimated to determine the maximum levels of cost overrun, delay \n                                                 \n6  The  expected  yields  for  paddy,  wheat,  and  maize  are  2.6\u20133.2  t/ha,  2.3  t/ha,  and  2.3  t/ha,  respectively,  whereas \n\nAssessment of Economic Returns \n\nthose for other crops will increase by some 20% under irrigated conditions.        \n\n7   Affordability  demonstrates  the  appropriateness  of  farmers'  stated  willingness  to  pay  their  share  of  the  investment \n\nand O&M costs, which is included in the subproject selection criteria (Appendix 8).  \n\n8  The expected yield levels for wheat and maize are 2.3 t/ha, while those for other crops are assumed to increase by \n\nup to 30% under irrigated conditions.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nPoverty Impact Assessment \n\nin years to achieve the benefit targets, reduced incremental benefits, reduced incremental yield, \nand  reduced  food  grain  prices,  at  which  the  schemes  will  still  be  economically  viable.  Sample \nschemes remain economically viable with cost overruns of 77\u201394%, delay of 8.9\u201310.3 years in \nachieving  benefit  targets,  43\u201348%  reduction  in  incremental  benefits,  and  food  grain  price \nreduction  of  35\u201386%.  While  the  economic  viability  of  each  subproject  appears  robust,  analysis \nindicated  relatively  high  sensitivity  to  changes  in  price  of  key  farm  outputs.  Thus,  subproject \nfeasibility  studies  should  carefully  assess  key  output  prices  and  their  projections,  using  field-\nbased assessment of marketing chains and margins, and the available marketing opportunities.   \n \nF. \n \n12. \nAccording  to  the  socioeconomic  survey,  the  poor  in  the  Harinmari,  Talkharka,  and \nInglakhola subprojects account for some 55\u201362% of the subproject population, with the national \nethnic  minority  population  accounting  for  a  substantial  majority  of  beneficiaries  crosscutting  all \nfarm size categories. The output of the benefit distribution analysis including the poverty impact \nratio  (PIR)  for  the  three  subprojects  is  shown  in  Table  A13,  based  on  the  calculation  for  (i) \nincreased  crop  production;  (ii)  increased  on-farm  family  and  hired  labor  opportunities;  and  (iii) \nincreased  construction  labor  opportunities,  from  which  the  NPV  for  farmer  contribution  was \nsubtracted. The PIR using the national poverty line of NRs6,100 corresponds to 39\u201351%.9  \n \nThe subproject will also improve food security, particularly for small farmers. On average, \n13. \nsmall farmers will increase food self-sufficiency from 90\u2013165% to 150\u2013240% in currently irrigated \nareas, and from 45\u201380% to 130%\u2013145% in currently rain fed areas in the three subproject areas. \nOnce  food  security  is  addressed,  farmers  have  indicated  their  desire  to  grow  more  profitable \ncrops  such  as  potato,  vegetables,  and  cardamom  where  market  conditions  allow.  Subproject \nimplementation  is  expected  to  provide  these  small  farmers  with  opportunities  to  enhance  their \nproductivity and diversify their crop mix.  \n \nPoor  people  will  also  benefit  from  increased  opportunities  for  family  and  hired  on-farm \n14 \nlabor,  and  for  sharecropping  and  tenancy  farming.  Annual  on-farm  labor  opportunities  are \nestimated to increase by of 46,000 days in the three subprojects, of which at least 15,500 days \nwill  be  hired  almost  totally  from  local  small  farmers  and  landless  people  including  dalit \n(occupational castes). Sharecropping and tenancy are prevalent in the currently irrigated area of \nthe Harinmari subproject (and observed little in its currently rain fed areas and other subproject \nareas), totaling 79 ha engaging 68 households mostly from landless and marginal farm families. \nIn  general,  sharecroppers  pay  for  half  the  cost  of  inputs,  provide  all  cultivation  activities,  and \nreceive  four  seventh  of  the  harvest,  whereas  tenant  farmers  annually  pay  a  fixed  amount  of \ngrain.  The  arrangements  are  beneficial  to  sharecroppers  and  tenants,  and  the  subproject  is \nexpected to provide further benefits to these people,10 while further expanding the sharecropped \nand  tenant  farming  areas  in  the  overall  command  areas  particularly  in  currently  rain-fed  areas \nwith  benefits  to  marginal  farmers  and  landless  people;  these  benefits,  however,  are  not \nquantified in the analysis.11  \n\n                                                 \n9  People having less than double the national poverty line income, which corresponds to approximately $0.4 per day, \n\ncapture 55\u201371% of overall economic benefits.  \n\n10 For example, sharecroppers are estimated to obtain a gross margin of NRs11,500/ha for cultivation of paddy, which \nis  expected  to  increase  by  NRs3,000  after  subproject  implementation.  There  is  no  notion  of  sharecroppers  being \nlittle more than bonded laborers controlled by their landlords.  \n\n11 The  experience  of  the  completed  FMIS  projects  indicate  that  large  farmers  tend  to  lease  the  land  to  marginal \nfarmers due to the labor constraints of the former and the availability to the latter of higher amounts of manure to \napply per unit of land.   \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nItem\n\nAppendix 13 \n\n49 \n\nTable A13: Summary of Economic and Financial Analysis \n\nHarinmari\n(Terai)\n\nTalkharka\n(Hills)\n\nIngla Khola\n(Hills)\n\nCommand Area (ha)\n     Previously Irrigated\n     Previously Rain-fed\n\nHouseholds\n     Landless\n     Small\n     Medium (Up to 1 ha in hills and 3 ha in terai)\n     Large\n(Above 1 ha in hills and 3 ha in terai)\nPopulation\n\n(Up to 0.5 ha in hills and 1 ha in terai)\n\nIncremental Net Crop Revenue (NRs)\n\nConstruction Cost (NRs)\nOther Costs (NRs) \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return %\nEconomic Net Present Value  (NRs)\nSwitching Values\n    Cost Overrun (%)\n    Benefit Delay (years)\n    Incremental Benefit Shortfall (%)\n    Food Grain Incremental Yield Reduction (%)\n    Food Grain Price Reduction (%)\n\nIncremental Income per Household (NRs)\n    Landless\n    Small\n(Previously Irrigated/ Previously Rain fed)\n    Medium (Previously Irrigated/ Previously Rain fed)\n    Large\n(Previously Irrigated/ Previously Rain fed)\n    Average\n\nAverage Incremental Income (NRs/ha)\nProject Investment Cost Contribution (NRs/ha)\nAnnual O&M Cost (NRs/ha)\nO&M as Percent of Incremental Income (average)\n\nTotal Incremental Annual Labor Inputs (days)\nTotal Incremental Hired Labor\n\nCrop Production (tons)\n     Total (Without Project/ With Project)\n     Food Grains (Without Project/ With project)\n     Potatoes (without Project/ With Project)\n     Other Vegetables (Without Project/ With Project)\n\nPoverty Incidence \nPIR for Poor (Less than NRs6,100/year/person)\nPIR for Near-poor (Less than NRs12,200/year/person)\nShare of Net Benefits (%)\n    Landless and small farmers\n    Medium\n    Large\n\nPercent Land Under Sharecropping\nNumber of Sharecropper Households\n\nO&M = operation and maintenance; PIR = poverty impact ratio\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.\n\n \n\n \n\n255\n185\n70\n\n382\n127 (33%)\n197 (52%)\n41 (11%)\n17 (  4%)\n2,100\n\n3,380,000\n\n8,890,000\n6,850,000\n\n22.7\n8,120,000\n\n77\n8.9\n43\n51\n35\n\n21,437\n2,549\n1,743\n8\n\n20,023\n6,498\n\n55%\n0.43\n0.55\n\n52%\n20%\n28%\n\n27%\n43\n\n210\n110\n100\n\n243\n23 (  9%)\n86 (35%)\n45 (19%)\n89 (37%)\n1,327\n\n4,700,000\n\n12,260,000\n5,640,000\n\n24.0\n11,045,000\n\n90\n9.5\n45\n-\n86\n\n29,105\n5,016\n2,919\n10\n\n15,025\n6,004\n\n54%\n0.39\n0.60\n\n16%\n19%\n64%\n\n2%\nNA\n\n141\n131\n10\n\n265\n4 (  2%)\n171 (65%)\n46 (17%)\n44 (16%)\n1,696\n\n2,860,000\n\n7,850,000\n3,790,000\n\n24.7\n7,560,000\n\n94\n10.3\n48\n-\n72\n\n23,950\n4,600\n2,784\n12\n\n11,268\n2,962\n\n62%\n0.51\n0.71\n\n43%\n18%\n39%\n\n4%\nNA\n\n967/1,670\n813/1,249\n83/ 240\n71/ 182\n\n680/1,341\n361/568\n277/ 630\n42/ 143\n\n587/1,119\n360/547\n174/ 390\n54/ 182\n\n1,843\n10,044/10,587\n14,663/29,312\n59,592/59,105\n10,736\n\n3,757\n8,804/11,828\n21,480/23,179\n26,442/49,325\n20,745\n\n1,410\n7,296/9,138\n11,004/14,954\n25,237/25,329\n11,070\n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY ANALYSIS AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY \n \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nA. \nSector identified as a National Priority in \nCountry Poverty Analysis?                                  \n\n \nYes \n\nSector identified as a National Priority in Country \nPoverty Partnership Agreement  \n\n \nYes \n\nContribution of the Subsector to Reduce Poverty in Nepal: \nAgriculture  accounts  for  39%  of  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  and  provides  employment  for  80%  of  the  active  workforce. \nHowever,  agriculture  is  largely  subsistence-oriented  with  annual  rainfall  primarily  concentrated  in  the  monsoon.  Irrigation  is  the \nmajor investment tool for the Government to augment agricultural productivity throughout the year. Nepal is 142 in poverty ranking \nout of 173 countries, and the human development index (HDI) at 0.47 is one of the lowest in the region. The gender development \nindex follows the same pattern. \n\nThe  Project  covers  all  the  35  districts  in  the  Eastern  and  Central  Development  regions;  11  are  terai  districts,  18  hills,  and  6 \nmountains. Although the Central and Eastern regions have the highest HDI estimated at 0.493 and 0.484, respectively, pockets \nof poverty exist both within and across districts. While Sarlahi (0.306) in eastern terai and Sindhuli (0.310) and Rasuwa (0.192) \nbear  testimony  to  the  disparity  in  development,  Siraha  (0.323)  in  eastern  terai  has  one  of  the  highest  concentrations  of \ndisadvantaged  occupational  caste  groups.  Of  a  total  population  of  10.7  million  in  the  two  project  regions,  ethnic  groups \ncomprise 3.4 million (1.7 million in each region) and disadvantaged occupational castes, more commonly called Dalit, 1 million \n(0.4 million in the Eastern and 0.6 million in the Central region).  \n\nThe  proposed  Project  takes  into  account  the  enormous  diversity  in  cultural  and  environmental  conditions  and  in  human \ncapabilities within Nepal, and promotes more inclusive economic growth by (i) establishing subproject selection criteria that will \nallow targeting to small and marginal men and women farmers, (ii) developing irrigated agriculture strategy in each district or \nriver  basin,  (iii)  promoting  improved  coordination  between  agriculture  and  irrigation  departments  to  maximize  the  benefits  of \nincreased availability of irrigation water, and (iv) enhancing social development with a focus on increasing capacity to address \nissues of gender and social exclusion at all levels. The Project\u2019s implementation strategy calls for crosscutting approaches and \nsupports the Government \u2018s Tenth Five-Year Plan. Most of the poor are engaged in agriculture and live in rural areas, with the \npoorest allocating 69% of their total expenditure to food, 16% more than people at the highest income levels. Hence, the sector \nremains a major focus of the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategies.  \n\nProject  components  focus  on  (i)  participatory  irrigated  agriculture  development  for  farmer-managed  irrigation  system  (FMIS), \nand  (ii)  institutional  strengthening  and  project  management.  They  include  rehabilitating  25,500  hectares  (ha)  of  existing \nirrigation  schemes  and  bringing  an  additional  8,500  ha  of  land  under  irrigation  while  simultaneously  (i)  improving  men  and \nwomen farmers\u2019 access to irrigated agricultural extension services, and (ii) expanding linkages to marketing opportunities and \ncredit to improve yields. Partnership with locally based nongovernment organizations (NGOs) for mobilizing beneficiary water \nuser associations (WUAs) is expected to provide the stimuli for increased participation of women and disadvantaged ethnic and \ncaste  groups,  and  fairer  sharing  of  irrigation  water  between  the  head,  middle,  and  tail  end  users,  to  foster  greater  system \nownership and sustainability. Based on economic and financial analyses of the three core subprojects, the net gain accruing to \na family is $165 per year, representing a 72% increase in annual income on average. Increased yields estimated at 2,360 tons \n(t)  (grain),  1,260  t  (potato),  and  520  t  (other  cash  crops)  is  expected  to  enhance  food  security,  nutritional  intake,  and  e \nemployment opportunities for poor women and men. Improved governance of WUA is expected to secure greater transparency \nand  more  equitable  distribution  of  irrigation  water,  leading  to  more  inclusive  development.  Improved  performance  in  the \nirrigation sector is expected to have a significant impact on the economy and be decisive in reducing rural poverty.  About 43% \nof overall economic benefits are expected to accrue to beneficiaries living below the poverty line, and 60% to those living near \nthe poverty line (less than $0.4 per capita a day). \n\nProposed Targeting Classification: \n\nPoverty Analysis \n \n \n\nB. \n \nSmall farm size and poverty are linked. The poverty rate among holdings below 0.5 ha is 54%. Those classified as \u201cagricultural \nor  production  workers\u201d  have  a  54%  poverty  rate.  Women  play  a  major  role  in  irrigated  agriculture  and  this  role  will  assume \nmore importance as increasing numbers of poor men leave their homes to seek employment elsewhere. Poverty is also high \n(52%) among larger households with 6\u20138 persons. Hill ethnic groups such as Limbu, Rai, Sherpa and Tamang common in the \nproject  area  have  a  poverty  incidence  of  58%.  The  Tharu  are  a  terai-based  ethnic  group  with  a  poverty  incidence  of  48%. \nPoverty  is  highest  (68%)  among  the  disadvantaged  occupational  castes  (blacksmith,  tailor,  cobbler,  and  sweeper).  They  are \neither landless or own small plots of land around the homestead and depend on wage labor in urban areas to augment family \nincome. Household food shortages and unemployment remain major risks for the majority of the people. \n\nTargeted Intervention \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Project has a strong poverty focus reflected through project processes that (i) give priority to subprojects with significant \nnumbers of poor, as it targets areas that have populations with high percentages of ethnic groups; (ii) specifically engage the \npoor  and  disadvantaged  ethnic  and  caste  groups  in  targeted  training  programs  and  support;  (iii)  require  high  levels  of \nparticipation and consultation of groups hitherto traditionally excluded;  (iv) undertake interventions in marginal farming areas \nthat have high incidences of poverty; and (v) mandate at least 33% women\u2019s participation in all project activities to secure more \nequitable distribution of benefits between the genders. Specific pro-poor interventions include improved irrigation infrastructure \nthat  will  enable  poor  men  and  women  farmers  to  have  greater  access  to  water  during  winter  and  spring  when  higher  value \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n51 \n\ncrops  such  as  vegetables  can  be  grown.  Such  access  will  increase  food  security,  rural  incomes,  and  labor  opportunities.  \nDemonstration pilot projects promoting nonconventional methods of irrigation such as drip and sprinkler will provide improved \naccess  to  water  on  a  micro  scale  to  poorer  women  and  men  living  in  marginal  lands,  who  because  of  limited  access  to \navailable land or water, or both, are unable to benefit from the more traditional FMIS. They  will have the opportunity to grow \nhigh-value crops and to improve their nutritional intake.   \n\nSocial mobilization support and training include agriculture extension programs specifically targeted to poor men and women. \nMechanisms  for  WUA  organization  building  focus  on  strengthening  WUA  capacity  to  formulate  necessary  arrangements  for \ncontinued system operation. In particular it gives attention to increase WUA capacity to manage irrigation water that is fair for \nall social groups while combining the interrelated physical (water and infrastructure), organizational (WUA rules, representation, \nand institutional structure and division of tasks) and agro-productive elements (soil, technology, input, and irrigated agriculture \nextension). \n\nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\n  No \n  No \n\n Yes   \n Yes   \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis?   \nIs there a participation strategy?   \nThe  project  promotes  participatory  approaches  by  mobilizing  communities  through  the  organization  of  210  WUAs \nrepresentative of their communities\u2019 social and cultural diversity and of which at least 33% will be women. WUAs and groups \nwill come together formally, through registration of the organization to run FMIS in a systematic and corporate fashion. Nearly \nall  interactions  between  men  and  women  farmers  and  the  Project  are  envisaged  to  take  place  through  the  WUA,  including \nconstruction, design, extension, and training. The Project ensures that WUA capacity is sufficiently strengthened and provides \nfor outsourcing WUA capacity-building activities to support organizations (locally based NGOs, national NGOs, and the private \nsector).  To  develop  the  human  resources  of  the  project  area,  locally-based  NGOs  will  be  trained  to  undertake  beneficiary \nmobilization  activities  to  ensure  the  envisaged  social  and  gender  outputs  are  secured.  Strategies  for  achieving  this  will  be \nculture-specific, with the Project taking immediate advantage of the more egalitarian and participatory attitudes of the hill ethnic \ngroups  to  involve  women  in  all  project  activities,  yet  placing  slow  and  continuous  pressure  on  those  groups  less  willing  to \nchange.  The  village  development  committee  (VDC)  is  envisaged  to  be  actively  involved  in  the  process  and  the  community \norganizers will support men and women farmers during the project period, and continue as an independent FMIS resource after \nProject completion. The Project will support the establishment of an FMIS stakeholder group, which will include representatives \nof the ministries and departments of all concerned line agencies, external funding agencies supporting irrigation and agriculture \nextension,  National  Federation  of  Irrigation  Water  Users  Associations  Nepal  (NFIWUAN),  and  private  sector  organizations \ninvolved in FMIS improvement. \n\nThe  Project  provides  for  participatory  development  specialists  and  a  gender  and  poverty  specialist  to  facilitate  participatory \nprocesses at all levels. Key strategies include capability training to ensure participatory skills are developed and used through \napplied  learning  techniques;  promotion  of  farmer-to-farmer  learning;  support  to  decentralization  in  planning,  implementation, \nand  follow-up  of  training  and  construction  activities;  and  special  consideration  to  gender  mainstreaming  and  environmental \nmitigation in all activities.  \n\nD.  \n\nGender Development \n\nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nThe Irrigation Policy (2003) requires at least 33% women\u2019s representation in all registered WUAs and provides an opportunity \nto  increase  women\u2019s  exposure  and  access  to  irrigated  agricultural  technology.  However,  there  are  significant  regional  and \ncultural differences in attitudes towards women\u2019s participation in decision-making in the irrigation sector. This goal will be more \neasily  attained  in  some  districts  than  in  others.  Therefore,  additional  effort  will  be  required  in  districts  where  the  33% \nparticipation goal has remained elusive, and higher goals can be set in others where higher participation rates are already the \nnorm.  The  Project  will  assist  the  Executing  Agency  to  mainstream  gender  concerns  in  the  sector  by  (i)  strengthening  the \ncapacity of the Department of Irrigation (DOI) through the provision of a local gender consultant for the 7-year project period; \n(ii) recruiting a gender specialist from NGOs/firms who will work closely with the women development officers of the Ministry of \nWomen, Children and Social Welfare (MOWCSW) and the district development committee (DDC) gender focal point to support \ngender mainstreaming activities at the district level; (iii) requesting 210 FMIS to have at least 33% women\u2019s representation in \nthe registered WUA; (iv) including gender sessions in all training activities in addition to specific gender sensitization training to \nall stakeholders including  DOI, Department of Agriculture, DDC senior and midlevel government officials involved in extension \nand field-level interaction, all WUA members, and NGOs/firms, among others; (v) including information about gender roles in \nirrigation in baseline survey of each district; (vi) undertaking three workshops\u2013two regional and one national\u2013on gender policy \ndevelopment  and  dialogue  in  conjunction  with  the  MOWCSW,  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Cooperatives  (MOAC),  National \nPlanning  Commission,  and    National  Women\u2019s  Commission;  (vii)  targeting  at  least  35%  women  farmers  for  all  irrigated \nagricultural extension in line with MOAC\u2019s policy on  women\u2019s representation; (viii) developing special programs for women in \nagriculture  and  water  management  with  other  members  of  the  team  and  included  in  the  district  gender  action  plan  to  give \npragmatic  guidance  at  the  local  level;  (ix)  ensuring  at  least  35%  women  or  female  centered  households  will  have  access  to \nnonconventional irrigation schemes; (x) ensuring at least two decision-making positions on the WUA management committee \ngo to women in areas where there has already been progress in increasing women\u2019s participation; (xi) requiring all data to be \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\ngender  disaggregated;  (xii)  engaging  partner  NGOs/firms  having  at  least  50%  women  field  staff;  and  (xiii)  ensuring  larger \noutreach and benefits accrue  to women farmers by recruiting at least 50% female community organizers in view of the fact that \nvirtually all association organizers are male.  \n\nHAS AN OUTPUT BEEN PREPARED?  \nA gender plan has been prepared and is covenanted (Appendix 15) \n\n Yes   \n\n  No   \n\nE. \n\nSocial Safeguards and Other Social Risks \n\nItem \n\nResettlement  \n  \n\nSignificant/ \nNot \nSignificant/ \nNone \nNot significant \n\n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n \n\n \nPlan \nRequired \n\n Full \n\n Short \n\nNone \n\nLabor \n \n\nNot-significant  While the Project will increase the labor requirements to 3.3 million \n\nAffordability  \n \n\nNone \n\nIndigenous \nPeoples \n \n\nNot-significant \n\nOther Risks/ \nVulnerabilities \n \n\nNone \n\nBased on a survey of three core subprojects, only minimal strip \nacquisition is envisaged for widening or extending existing canals.  A \nresettlement framework (RF) was prepared to deal with the limited \nimpacts of the subprojects. Construction activities will not start until the \nresettlement plan (RP, containing an inventory of loss, the number of \naffected men and women and agreed upon compensation, whether \nvoluntary/involuntary) is signed by the affected persons (APs) and \nimplemented. Preparation of the RP is part of subproject preparation, \nand its implementation will be carried out in close consultation with and \nparticipation of APs and designated WUA men and women members, \nalong with an acceptable third party witness.  \nParticipating men and women farmers\u2019 share in labor and cash \ncontribution is based on the principle of equity in contribution and benefit \nsharing, hence impediments to project implementation is not foreseen.  \nThe Project will take steps to ensure that the cost of credit and inputs is \nreasonable and that poor men and women farmers have equal access to \ncredit through appropriate arrangements for collateral. \n\nperson-days annually, of which 58% are additional female employment \nopportunities, no major impact on the labor market is foreseen.  Rather, \nthe Project will increase earning opportunities for women and men, and \nreduce the need for male migration and thus have positive impacts on \nwomen and improved family well-being. The Project will monitor child \nlabor and compliance with the international core labor standards. The \nProject will ensure equal pay between men and women for the same \nwork.   \nThe Project targets areas with high percentages of ethnic groups. In the \nthree core subprojects, ethnic peoples issues were found insignificant as \nthe beneficiary group comprises an ethnic local majority but a national \nminority. Where small disadvantaged ethnic and caste groups may be \nidentified, ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples will be applied and will \nbuild on the organizational model of each ethnic group\u2019s FMIS. A sample \nindigenous peoples specific actions (IPSA) has been prepared as a \nprecautionary measure, which will be integrated in subproject \nimplementation plans (SIPs). Safeguards to ensure inclusiveness \ninclude subproject selection criteria that will require the WUA \nmanagement committee to constitute roughly the same proportions of its \nsocial and gender profile as the population of the WUA.  \nPotential risks include the ongoing insurgency, extortion of funds from \nGovernment and NGO staff by the insurgents, political instability, lack of \ncapacity of locally based NGOs, delays in the devolution process, and \ninadequate interdepartmental coordination. The Project has several \nbuilt-in safeguards: participatory planning to ensure the full participation \nof all stakeholders; WUA centrality in subproject selection, system \ndesign, construction oversight; and increased emphasis on training in \nmanagement and irrigation extension at community level. Any potential \nrisk will be addressed, as there is strong Government commitment and \nownership of the Project. \n\n \n\n \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n53 \n\nGENDER ACTION PLAN \n\nThe Irrigation Policy (2003) requires at least 33% women\u2019s representation in all registered water user associations (WUAs) to \nprovide an opportunity to increase women\u2019s exposure and access to irrigated agricultural technology and extension. However, \nthere  are  significant  regional  and  cultural  differences  in  attitude  towards  women\u2019s  participation  in  decision  making  in  the \nirrigation  sector.  Therefore,  strategies  will  be  culture-specific,  with  the  Project  taking  immediate  advantage  of  the  more \negalitarian and participatory attitudes of the hill ethnic groups to involve women in all project activities, while placing slow and \ncontinuous pressure on the more conservative groups.  \n\nThe Gender action plan includes the following: \n\n(i)  Provision  of  gender  specialists.  A  local  gender  and  poverty  specialist  will  be  employed  to  support  all  gender-related \nactivities during the Project period. Gender specialists will also be required from nongovernment organizations (NGOs) or \nfirms to help support women\u2019s participation in each district. The NGO/firm gender specialists will work in conjunction with \nthe women\u2019s development officers and district development committee (DDC) gender focal points. The consultant gender \nspecialist will develop a project gender operational strategy endorsed by the Department of Irrigation (DOI) to guide project \nstaff and stakeholders in maintaining a participatory process in the irrigation sector.  \n\n(ii)  Women\u2019s representation in WUAs. Part of the social mobilization process will include bringing women\u2019s participation rate \nup  to  at  least  33%  as  required  by  DOI  for  all  registered  WUAs.  Since  a  WUA  must  be  registered  to  participate  in  the \nProject, the 33% rate should become the norm. This in itself will be insufficient to ensure a meaningful role for women, so \nthe Project will also have a target of women not only being members of the WUAs, but having roles in the leadership as \nwell. Therefore, the gender specialist will provide gender sensitization training to WUA members, and leadership training to \nwomen to facilitate their increased and more active participation in WUA activities. \n\n(iii)  Gender  training.  The gender specialist  will organize capacity development training in gender issues for all project staff, \nincluding those from support organizations such as NGOs/firms. Sessions on gender and development will be part of the \nmain project orientation training. The DDC of each project district will select one person to work with the NGO/firm gender \nspecialist to play a catalytic role in gender promotional efforts in the district. \n\n(iv)  Increasing  the  number  of women  in  contact with  extension  services. Representation of women staff in DOI and the \nDepartment of Agriculture is low. Woman-to-woman contact has been found to be more effective in reaching poor women. \nTherefore,  at  least  50%  of  community  organizers  will  be  women  who  will  complement  the  work  of  the  association \norganizers of DOI. \n\n(v)  Integration of gender data. The baseline survey of each district will include information on gender roles in irrigation and \nagriculture activities. The gender specialist, with the support of the NGO/firm gender specialist in each district, will ensure \nthis data is included in subproject planning, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation. \n\n(vi)  Gender  policy  development  and  dialogue.  Gender  policy  development  will  be  pursued  and  addressed  by  the  Project \nthrough  three  workshops\u2013two  regional  and  one  national.  The  gender  specialist  will  facilitate  this  and  collect  opinions  for \nformulating  gender  policy  within  DOI.  The  workshops  will  be  facilitated  in  collaboration  with  other  national  stakeholders, \nparticularly the National Planning Commission (NPC), Ministry of Women, Children, and Social Welfare (MOWCSW), and \nMinistry of Agriculture and  Cooperatives (MOAC). The policy statement  will  contain  the  means  of  ensuring  that  action  is \ntaken. \n\n(vii) Field  channel  groups.  Each  field  channel  group  will  have  at  least  35%  women  farmers  following  the  MOAC  policy  on \nwomen\u2019s representation and participation. From each group two leaders, a man and a woman, will be selected and trained \nto serve as local extensionists.  \n\n(viii) Creating  opportunities  for  female-centered  households.  At least 35%  women or female-centered households  will be \nprovided an opportunity in the nonconventional irrigation subcomponent such as drip and sprinkler, and water harvesting to \nincrease production on small plots of land with very small investment. Since an increasing number of poor women are now \nmanaging  farms  due  to  the  migration  of  male  family  members  for  wage  labor,  the  Project  will  focus  part  of  its  effort  on \nbringing these technologies to women. Furthermore, microcredit facilities will be made available to women through NGOs \nhaving access to the microfinance facilities of the Rural Microfinance Development Center.  \n\n(ix)  Monitoring and Evaluation. The gender specialist will contribute the establishment of a project monitoring system, to be \nadopted by DOI to incorporate data disaggregated by gender, ethnicity, and caste. The specialist will also provide inputs \non other aspects of project management information system (MIS) ensuring its gender responsiveness. Within the project \ncycle, biannual reviews will be undertaken to cover all aspects of Project implementation including achievement of gender \ngoals. Under the guidance of gender specialist, the NGO/firm gender specialist will develop a gender action plan reflecting \nlocal attitudes and practices for each district. The plan will be an integral part of the subproject preparation process. The \nplan  will  contain  training  proposals  as  well  as  strategies  for  increased  participation  of  women  as  farmer  trainers,  WUA \nmembers, participants in project-related activities such as extension programs, walk-through, and participatory evaluations. \nSpecial  programs  for  women  in  agriculture  and  water  management  will  be  jointly  developed  with  project  staff.    Gender \ndevelopment will be an integral part of the Project\u2019s overall targets and strategies. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 16 \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n\n \n1. \nScope and Impacts. The resettlement framework outlines the policy and procedures for \npreparing of the subprojects under the Community-Managed Irrigated Agriculture Sector Project. \nThe  Project  will  renovate  the  existing  farmer-owned  and  farmer-managed  irrigation  systems \n(FMIS)  through  improved  diversion  and  canal  systems.  The  process  involves  widening  or \nextending  the  existing  canals,  for  which  land  needs  to  be  acquired  by  water  user  associations \n(WUAs).  However,  land  acquisition  is  limited  to  a  minimum  strip.  The  project  preparatory \ntechnical assistance (PPTA) indicated that in the three sample subprojects, 0.77 hectare (ha) of \nland is needed to expand the command area from 426 ha to 569 ha, which represents 2.5% of \nthe farm plot area through which the canals pass. Some land parcels may also be required for \ntemporary use, such as quarry sites and place for storing construction material.  \n \n2. \nResettlement Policy. Resettlement will be implemented in accordance with the policy on \ninvoluntary resettlement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Government\u2019s Irrigation \nPolicy of 2003.  \n \n3. \nResettlement  Principles  and  Entitlements.  The  resettlement  framework  applies  to  all \nresettlement  effects  arising  from  land  acquisition  or  conversion,  or  any  other  effects  that  arise \nfrom  the  project  works,  including  the  effects  on  people  with  no  title  to  the  land.  Those  affected \nwill  be  entitled  to  maintain  at  least  their  standard  of  living  at  pre-project  level,  and  to  receive \ncompensation  for  all  types  of  losses,  including  land,  crops,  trees,  structures,  and  any  other \nassets  at  full  replacement  value.  Due  to  the  economic  benefits  and  increased  value  of  land \nproperty  arising  from  the  improved  irrigation  systems,  those  affected  may  also  voluntarily \ncontribute  the  land,  as  an  option,  with  written  agreements  between  the  WUA  and  the  affected \npersons witnessed by a third party. Significantly affected persons, who lose 10% or more of their \ntotal  land  or  income,  if  any,  and  vulnerable  groups  such  as  female  heads  of  households,  poor \npeople  below  the  poverty  line,  occupational  castes,  and  ethnic  minorities  will  be  eligible  for \nfurther assistance such as counseling on compensation fund management and priority access to \nproject employment opportunities. Affected people, including those with no land titles, will receive \npriority assistance under the Project\u2019s agriculture and social development subcomponent. Table \nA16 summarizes the types of loss and entitlements of the affected persons.     \n\nTable A16: Compensation Entitlement Matrix \n\nType of Loss \n\n1.

If there is a tenant, he/she will get 50% of the compensation and the other 50% will \n\ngo to the absentee landowner. \n\nIf such structures are identified during feasibility studies, the resettlement plan will \ninclude measures to avoid, mitigate, or compensate impacts. If identified only during \nconstruction, compensation should be provided at replacement cost as determined by \nthe Grievances Resolution Committee.  \nThose persons with no title to the land who have been using/owning the affected \nproperty will get compensation/assistance at replacement cost determined through \nagreement between the AP and the WUA. \n\n\fAppendix 16 \n\n55 \n\nType of Loss \n\nEntitled Unit \n\nEntitlement/Compensation \n\n6.

The Central Project Management Office \n4. \n(CPMO),  with  a  designated  resettlement  officer,  will  guide,  monitor,  and  report  on  land \nacquisition.  The  Regional  Project  Support  Unit  (RPSU),  with  a  designated  resettlement  and \nsocial development officer, will supervise the resettlement plan preparation and implementation \ncarried out by the Subproject Management Unit (SMU). A resettlement specialist will be hired for \neach RPSU under the consultancy for institutional development and project management (ISPM) \nto assist in supervising the resettlement activities. Nongovernment organizations (NGOs) will be \nengaged to help SMU and WUAs plan and implement the resettlement plan. At each subproject \nlevel, social assessment will be done during the feasibility study to determine the category of the \nlikely resettlement impacts, based on which a full or short resettlement plan will be prepared by \nthe NGO with necessary land survey and social impact assessment undertaken by private firms \nduring  the  detailed  design  stage.  The  complete  resettlement  plan  will  be  prepared  before \nGovernment  approval  of  the  detailed  design,  and  should  include  signed  agreements  with  the \naffected persons including a no-coercion clause witnessed by a third party in case of voluntary \ncontribution; and a bank deposit slip to verify that the WUA has deposited sufficient up-front cash \nrequired  for  land  compensation.  The  plan  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval,  and  affected \npeople should be fully compensated before civil work contracts are awarded.    \n \n5. \nDisclosure,  Consultation,  and  Grievances.  Each  resettlement  plan  will  be  prepared \nand  implemented  in  close  consultation  with  the  stakeholders  and  will  involve  focus  group \ndiscussions and meetings particularly with the affected persons. Before submitting them to ADB, \ncopies of the draft resettlement plans will be disclosed to the public in project information centers \nto  be  set  up  at  central,  regional,  and  subproject  level  offices,  and  released  to  any  requester \nincluding project-affected persons and NGOs. ADB will also post the resettlement framework and \nresettlement plans in its resettlement web site as appropriate. A grievances resolution committee \n(GRC) will be established in each subproject, under the chairmanship of the village development \ncommittee  (VDC)  chairperson.  Other  members  are  two  representatives  (one  man  and  one \nwoman)  of  affected  persons,  WUA  chairperson,  NGO  representative,  and  representative  from \nthe Project. The affected persons may submit their concerns or grievances verbally or in writing \nto the GRC. The GRC will facilitate the concerned parties agree on a time-bound action plan to \nresolve the grievances that are found to be genuine. \n \nMonitoring  and  Evaluation.  The  CPMO  will  establish  a  monthly  monitoring  system \n6. \ninvolving RPSU and SMU. RPSU will prepare progress reports on all aspects of resettlement and \nsocial  development  efforts  and  outcomes  with  the  assistance  of  ISPM  resettlement  specialists, \nbased  on  which  the  CPMO  will  prepare  a  quarterly  progress  report  on  resettlement.  External \nmonitoring  will  be  assigned  to  an  independent  agency  preferably  NGO,  which  will  undertake \nannual monitoring and report to the CPMO and ADB.  \n \n7. \nResettlement  Cost.  The cost of land compensation will be borne by the WUA. Cost for \nthe  staff  and  NGOs  assigned  to  prepare,  implement,  and  monitor  resettlement  plans,  and \nconduct skills training for income generation will be borne by the Government and ADB.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 17 \n\nInglakhola (Hills) \n141 ha (131 ha at present) \n0.17 ha \n43 \n0.60 \n\nSUMMARY OF SHORT RESETTLEMENT PLANS FOR CORE SUBPROJECTS \n\n1. \nScope  and  Impacts.  The  improvement  of  farmer-managed  irrigation  system  (FMIS)  in \nthe three core subprojects entails the following impacts from the widening of the existing canals \nand addition of new branch canals to irrigate an expanded command area (Table A17).  \n\nTable A17. Resettlement Impacts of Core Subprojects \n\nTalkhalka (Hills) \n210 ha (110 ha at present) \n0.59 ha \n40 \n0.41 \n\nHarinmari (Terai) \n255 ha (185 ha at present) \n1.24 ha \n145 \n0.69 \n\nItem \nCommand Area \nLand Required (LR) \nAffected Households (AH) \nLR/ as %of total landholding of AH \nha = hectare. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n \n2. \nThe proposed alignment passes through largely agricultural land. Due to strip acquisition, \nthere is no significantly affected person losing more than 10% of his/her income or is physically \ndisplaced. All farmlands are cultivated by farmers by themselves, so there are no tenants or non-\ntitled people. Thus, there is no significant resettlement impact in these subprojects.   \n \n3. \nStakeholder Consultation and Entitlements. During the project preparatory stage, the \nGovernment  with  the  assistance  of  the  consultants  undertook  initial  consultations  in  the  three \nsubproject  areas,  and  presented  resettlement  framework  (RF,  Appendix  16)  translated  into  the \nlocal language. The feedback and observations made at the stakeholders\u2019 meetings were used \nin preparing the entitlement matrix and discussing the project benefits for affected people.  \n \n4. \nThe consultations revealed that, while households were concerned that they would lose a \ncertain level of income due to the acquisition of the strip of land, they opined that the loss would \nbe far outweighed by the benefits from increased reliability and availability of irrigation water that \nwould enhance crop productivity and intensity.1 Consequently, all households were found ready \nto  voluntarily  contribute  their  land.  It  was  also  confirmed  that  the  female  heads  of  vulnerable \nhouseholds would be given priority access to subproject agriculture and livelihood enhancement \nprograms and employment opportunities.2 Further consultation and finalization of the entitlement \nmatrix  and  resettlement  plan  will  continue  prior  to  the  approval  of  the  subproject\u2019s  detailed \ndesign,  including  the  written  agreements  between  the  landowner  and  the  WUA,  with  a  \"no \ncoercion\" clause and witnessed by a neutral party in case of voluntary land contribution.   \n \nImplementation Responsibilities and Cost Estimates. The arrangement as described \n5. \nin the RF (Appendix 16) is followed, including the implementation arrangements (engagement of \nlocal  NGOs  with  supervision  and  support  with  the  assistance  of  the  consultants);  disclosure, \nconsultation,  and  grievance  mechanisms;  and  monitoring  and  evaluation.  If  any  affected \nhouseholds choose the compensation option, the necessary fund will be provided by the WUA.3 \nThe cost of preparing and implementing the resettlement plan, to be undertaken by private firms \nand NGOs under the supervision of the RPSU and SMU, will be borne by the Government and \nADB.  Compensation,  if  any,  will  be  provided  to  the  concerned  affected  households  before  civil \nworks contracts are awarded.  \n                                                 \n1  The affected households will, on the average, lose NRs200\u2013400 of income annually in each subproject from the land \n\nprovided to canals, while they will gain over NRs15,000\u201370,000 through improved irrigation access.  \n\n2  There  are  five,  two,  and  three  households  with  female  heads  among  the  affected  households  in  Harinmari, \nTalkharka,  and  Inglakhola  subprojects,  respectively,  who  will  lose  1.47%,  0.25%,  and  1.02%  of  the  total \nlandholdings.  \n\n3  The  Government  will  deduct  the  same  amount  from  the  WUA's  capital  contribution  requirement  for  subproject \n\nimplementation (corresponding to 3% of diversion and 10% of other structure costs). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n\nAppendix 18 \n\n57 \n\nIn  accordance  with  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  guidelines,  initial  environmental \n1. \nexamination  (IEE)  was  carried  out  as  part  of  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance \n(PPTA) for the Community-Managed Irrigated Agriculture Sector Project. The IEE assessed the \nenvironmental implications of the sector loan interventions, identified mitigating measures, and \ndeveloped environmental review and assessment procedures. In view of the different ecological \nlocations,  IEEs  for  three  sample  subprojects  were  prepared  during  the  PPTA:    Harinmari \nsubproject located in the alluvial terai, and Talkharka and Inglakhola subprojects in the hills. The \nproposed  Project \nis  categorized  as  environmental  category  B  under  Environmental \nConsideration in ADB Operations (2003). Project interventions were screened with reference to \nADB's Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003).  \n \n2. \nThe  project  area  covers  35  districts  in  Eastern  and  Central  Development  regions  and \nshow considerable diversity of geography comprising mountains (12% of the area, with altitude \nabove  4,800  meters  [m]),  hills  (65%),  and  the  terai  (23%,  with  altitude  below  500  m)  that  lies \nacross  the  southern  belt.  The  Project  aims  to  improve  agricultural  productivity  of  the  existing \nfarmer-managed  irrigation  systems  (FMIS)  while  strengthening  service  delivery  mechanisms \nand community institutions. The Project will include about 210 subprojects with an average area \nof 250 hectares (ha) in the terai and 100 ha in the hills. The major physical interventions will be \nconstruction  of  permanent  diversion  structures,  and  improvement  of  canals  and  ancillary \nstructures.  \n \nB. \n\nEnvironment Conditions for the Sector Project \n\n3. \nNepal  has  a  rich  but  fragile  environment  and  faces  a  number  of  physical  and  human \nchallenges.  Its  rugged  terrain,  young  geology,  and  monsoon  climate  produce  high  rates  of \nrunoff, erosion, and sedimentation with frequent floods and landslides. High population growth \ncombined  with  high  poverty  incidence  is  also  causing  soil  erosion,  deforestation,  biodiversity \nloss,  and  air  and  water  pollution.  The  rivers  in  the  project  area  are  categorized  into  (i)  large \nperennial  rivers  originating  in  the  Himalayas,  (ii)  medium  rivers  from  the  midland  that  are \nperennial but have wide seasonal fluctuations, and (iii) a large number of small seasonal rivers \nin  the  terai.  While  there  is  no  water  shortage  in  large  rivers,  there  are  possibilities  of  water \ndeficits in some subbasins of the medium rivers during March\u2013May. Small rivers from southern \nhills do not have much water beyond the postmonsoon period. Water availability thus constrains \nwater use in irrigation systems. Many systems in the southern terai belt along small rivers have \nlimited  scope  for  year-round  run-of-the-river  irrigation.  Overall,  about  40%  of  the  irrigation \nsystems have year-round irrigation capacity.  \n \n4. \nThe  project  strategy  of  rehabilitating  the  existing  FMIS  to  improve  the  reliability  of \ndiversion  and  efficiency  in  water  use  with  institutional  development  will  mean  that  potential \nenvironmental  impacts  will  generally  be  positive.  Potential  environmental  concerns  include \nwater use conflicts and quality deterioration in areas of water scarcity, particularly in dry season. \nFMIS  in  the  hills  may  destabilize  land  and  possibly  encourage  further  conversion  of  forest  to \nagricultural  lands.  Water  and  soil  quality  may  also  be  affected  as  a  result  of  enhanced \nagricultural  activities  in  the  concerned  FMIS.  Given  that  subproject  works  are  generally  on  a \nsmall  scale,  scattered  in  wide  areas,  and  confined  to  existing  agricultural  lands,  they  can  be \nkept  minimal  with  little  cumulative  impacts,  through  due  environmental  considerations  in \nsubproject screening, planning, and implementation.  \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 18 \n\nC. \n\nSummary of IEEs prepared for Subprojects \n\n1. \n\nDescription of the Subprojects and the Environment \n\n5. \n\nKey features of the three core subprojects are summarized in the table.  \n\nTable A18.1: Summary of Scope of Principal Works for the Three Core Subprojects \n\nItem \n\nHarinmari \n\nTalkharka \n\nInglakhola \n\nLocation \nSize of \ncommand area \nNature and \nscope of \nheadworks \nimprovements \nNature and \nscope of canal \nnetwork \nimprovements \n\nMahottari districts, in the terai  \nCurrent: 185 hectares (ha) \nAfter project: 255 ha \nStrengthening of existing \ndiversion bund, escape \nstructure, gabion mattress and \ntwin discharge weir \nStrengthening of 3,807 m main \ncanal, 5,340 m branch canals \nand 1,460 m tertiary canals.  \nProvision of bed bars to retain \ncanal profile.

The scheme is located in the terai. The water source is a small local stream, \nthe  Geruka  Khola,  with  perennial  flow  fed  by  spring  water.  To  divert  water,  farmers  build \nembankments  that  have  to  be  rebuilt  after  floods.  The  area  was  originally  covered  by  dense \nforest  but  has  been  cleared  for  human  settlement.  There  is  no  protected  area  or  significant \nremnant of forest. Trees have been planted around homes, forming scattered vegetation clumps \nproviding  some  habitat  for  wildlife.  There  are  382  households  with  an  average  size  of  5.8 \npersons.  Over  55%  are  poor.  The  area  is  rural,  with  an  urban  portion  5\u201315  kilometers  (km) \naway, connected through dust road and a national road. Services such as electricity are absent.    \n \n7. \nTalkharka  and  Inglakhola.  Both schemes are located in hilly terrain. Water resources \nare  substantial,  with  river  flow  sustained  during  dry  season.  Irrigation  is  operated  through \ntemporary diversion made of bush, logs, and stones that require regular rebuilding. Much of the \ncultivated land is terraced, surrounded by forested steep slopes and ridges. A large number of \nmultipurpose trees grown around the houses and including fodder and fruit trees afford habitats \nto wildlife. No protected areas occur within. The total number of households is 243 and 265, and \npoverty incidence is 54% and 62% in Talkharka and Inglakhola, respectively. Services such as \nelectricity and roads are limited. Access to health and education is similarly poor.  \n \n\n2. \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts \n\n8. \nThe Project comprises two parts: part A, participatory irrigated agriculture development \nfor  FMIS,  and  part  B,  institutional  strengthening  and  project  management.  The  environmental \nimpacts are confined to part A.  Part B develops the capacities of the project institutions to plan, \nimplement,  operate,  and  maintain  the  FMIS,  including  training  on  environmental  issues  to \nensure  the  full  operation  of  the  Project\u2019s  environmental  assessments  and  review  procedures. \nThe impacts and mitigating measures in each subcomponent of part A are summarized below. \n \n9. \nenvironmentally harmless as it involves participatory planning and social mobilization of farmers.   \n\nParticipatory  Planning  and  Beneficiary  Mobilization.

The IEEs identified environmental impacts that \ncould  arise  from  (i)  location,  in  terms  of  downstream  water  use  and  ecosystems  affected  by \nincreased intake by improved FMIS, and possible encroachment of protected areas; (ii) design, \nin  terms  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  erosion  of  slopes  along  canals  caused  by \nstructures, and drainage congestion; (iii) implementation, in terms of possible destabilization of \nsteep slopes, temporary pollution such as noise, dust, and silt runoff due to excavation; and (iv) \noperation,  in  terms  of  waterborne  diseases  due  to  standing  water,  and  underachievement  of \nbenefits due to poor operation and maintenance (O&M).  \n \nIn  the  IEEs,  no  sample  schemes  showed  relevant  location-related  impacts.1 For  future \n11. \nschemes  such  impacts  will  be  avoided  at  subproject  screening  stage  by  undertaking  stringent \nwater  resources  assessment  and  consultation with  downstream  users  and  excluding  schemes \nhaving negative impacts. All core subprojects have resettlement impacts, which are mitigated by \npreparing  and  implementing  resettlement  plans  (Appendix  17).  In  the  two  hill  schemes, \npossibilities  for  increased  erosion  of  slopes  along  canals,  will  be  mitigated  with  environment-\nfriendly  slope  protection  measures  and  soil  investigation  during  detailed  design  stage.  For  all \ncore  subprojects,  contractors  will  be  required  to  avoid  construction-related  pollution.  Likewise, \nwaterborne  diseases  and  poor  O&M  would  be  an  issue  for  all  core  subprojects.  They  will  be \nmitigated by raising awareness and ensuring proper and sustainable O&M with sufficient WUA \nstrengthening and training.      \n \n12. \nAgriculture  Development  and  Livelihood  Enhancement.  The  activities  include \nagriculture  extension  to  promote  crop  intensification  and  diversification,  targeted  support \nincluding income generation for the poor and the disadvantaged, and pilot micro irrigation for the \npoor.  While  these  activities  will  enhance  the  livelihood  of  the  poor,  they  may  cause  soil  and \nwater  contamination  due  to  increased  agrochemical  use  and  livestock  activities  resulting  from \nirrigation-induced \nloss, \nintroduction of alien species, and conversion of forests and wetlands into farmland. These were \nfound  relevant  in  all  core  subprojects,  and  will  be  mitigated  by  including  sustainable  land  use \npractices  in  agriculture  extension,  such  as  promoting  organic-based  practices,  optimal  use  of \nfertilizers,  and  integrated  pest  management;  monitoring  the  production  of  traditional  varieties; \nand carefully selecting sites to avoid the conversion of ecosystems hosting unique species.  \n \n13. \nSupport  for  Sustainable  O&M.  Completed  FMIS  schemes  will  be  monitored  while \nrehabilitating  the  schemes  that  have  suffered  from  severe  natural  calamities.  Civil  works  may \ncause similar environmental impacts, which will be mitigated following the same arrangements.    \n \n \n \nStakeholder consultations were held at subproject, district, and national levels to discuss \n14. \nanticipated environmental impacts and their mitigating measures.2 In general, the stakeholders \nanticipated  positive  environmental  impacts,  while  endorsing  the  project  approach  of  inclusive, \nparticipatory, and demand-driven FMIS renovation. Their views were reflected in the IEEs and \nother project documents. \n                                                 \n1  In urban areas near Harinmari, industrial pollution is an issue, but the implication of the scheme is deemed minimal, \ngiven the large catchment area at the point of industrial effluent. The factory is also introducing treatment facilities.   \n2  Subproject-level meetings were held in June\u2013August 2003 with farmer groups (more than 400 people in total) for \nthe  subproject  and  adjacent  areas.  District-level  meetings  were  held  during  the  period  with  groups  of  local \ngovernance  institutions,  line  agency,  and  nongovernment  organization  (NGO)  staff.  Two  national  workshops  to \ndiscuss  the  project  design  including  IEEs  were  held  in  February  and  September  2003  with  some  100 \nrepresentatives from line agencies, donors aid agencies, NGOs, and private organizations.   \n\nfodder  availability,  reduced  soil  nutrient,  biodiversity \n\nPublic Consultation \n\nincreased \n\n3. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 18 \n\nD. \n\nEnvironmental Review and Management Procedures and Arrangements \n\n15. \nBased on the IEEs and stakeholder consultation and following the ADB guidelines and \nthe  Government's  environmental  requirements, 3  project-specific  environmental  assessment \nprocedures  and  arrangements  (EAPA)  were  prepared  (Supplementary  Appendix  K),  and  their \ncosts were included in the Project. Procedures and institutional responsibilities are summarized \nin  Table  A18.2.  For  an  average  subproject,  about  $3,000  is  provided  for  environmental \n(excluding resettlement) management to cover the cost of consultation (10%), IEE and planning \nactivities (55%), mitigation management (30%), and equipment (5%).  \n\nTable A18.2.

The identified \nadverse  effects  will  be  addressed \nlocation,  planning,  design, \nimplementation,  and  O&M  while  incorporating  identified  mitigating  measures.  The  Project  can \ntherefore  be  classified  under  Category  B.  Further  subprojects  will  follow  the  project-specific \nEAPA  developed  in  conformity  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  and  social  safeguard  policies. \nAppropriate review and monitoring throughout the project life will be carried out to ensure that \nthe guidelines are adhered to and that adequate capacity development support is given to the \nproject institutions carrying out the assessments and to the concerned communities. \n\nthrough  proper  site \n\n                                                 \n3   These are stipulated in Environmental Protection Act 1996 and its 1997 Rules revised in 1999. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 October 2004) \n \n", "Currency Unit\nNRs1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "Nepalese rupee/s (NRe/NRs) \n$0.01389 \nNRs72.00 \n", " \nABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nAPP \nASPR \nCPMO \nCO \nCSP \nDADO \nDIAP \nDDC \nDG \nDOA \nDOI \nDOLIDAR \nDTO \nEIRR \nFMIS \nGDP \nHDI \nIDD/IDSD \nIEE \nISPM \nIWRM \nLGI \nLSGA \nM&E \nMFI \nMOAC \nMOWR \nMTR \nNARC \nNFIWUAN \nNGO \nNPV \nNRB \nNVC \nNWP \nNWRS \n9 FYP \nO&M \nPAC \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAgriculture Perspective Plan \nAgriculture Sector Performance Review \ncentral project management office \ncommunity organizer \ncountry strategy and program \ndistrict agriculture development office \nDecentralization Implementation Action Plan \ndistrict development committee \ndirector general \nDepartment of Agriculture \nDepartment of Irrigation \nDepartment of Local Infrastructure Development and Agriculture Roads \nDistrict Technical Office \neconomic internal rate of return \nFarmer -managed irrigation system \ngross domestic product \nHuman development index \nIrrigation Development Division/ Irrigation Development Subdivision \ninitial environmental examination \ninstitutional strengthening and project management \nintegrated water resources management \nlocal governance institution \nLocal Self-Governance Act \nmonitoring and evaluation \nmicrofinance institution \nMinistry of Agriculture and Cooperatives \nMinistry of Water Resources \nmidterm review \nNepal Agriculture Research Council \nNational Federation of Irrigation Water Users Associations, Nepal \nnongovernment organization \nnet present value  \nNepal Rastra Bank \nNational Vigilance Center \nNational Water Plan \nNational Water Resources Strategy \nninth five-year plan \noperation and maintenance \nproject appraisal committee \n", "  \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n", " \n", "PIR \nPPTA \nPRSP \nPSC \nRDA \nRF \nRID \nRP \nRPSU \nSDR \nSIP \nSISP \nSMU \nSOE \nTL \nWECS \nWUA \n", "poverty impact ratio \nproject preparatory technical assistance \npoverty reduction strategy paper \nproject steering committee \nRegional Directorate of Agriculture \nresettlement framework \nRegional Irrigation Directorate \nresettlement plan \nregional project support unit \nspecial drawing rights \nsubproject implementation plan \nSecond Irrigation Sector Project \nsubproject management unit \nstatement of expenditure \nteam leader \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Water and Energy Commission Secretariat \n\u2013 \n", "water user association \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The  fiscal  year  (FY)  of  the  Government  ends  on  15  July.
