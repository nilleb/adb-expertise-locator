The  Government  of \n2. \nIndia\u2019s  Eleventh  Five  Year  Plan,  2007\u20132012  targeted  the  creation  of  79  gigawatts  (GW)  of \nadditional conventional power capacity. However, actual realization was no more than 55 GW. \nThe  government  in  its  Twelfth  Five  Year  Plan,  2012\u20132017,  has  set  a  larger  target  of  100  GW \nincluding 24 GW of capacity which should have been completed in the previous plan. India also \nneeds  to  diversify  its  energy  mix,  not  only  to  combat  climate  change  but  also  to  ensure  the \ncountry\u2019s  energy  security.  The  availability  of  indigenous  conventional  fuels  is  diminishing  and \nIndia has to import increasing quantities of expensive coal and liquefied natural gas. The share \nof renewable power\u2014including hydropower\u2014in total installed capacity has declined from 44% in \n1970  to  31%  in  2011.  The  government  intends  to  stop  this  decline  and  has  set  a  goal  of \nmaintaining the proportion of renewable power at its current level (31%) until 2023.1 \n \nThe  project  team  has  sought  to  identify  renewable  energy  developers  suitable  for  \n3. \nfinancing support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which can make a material impact \nin  alleviation  of  the  power  shortage  in  the  country.  ReNew  Power  Ventures  Private  Limited \n(ReNew)  was identified as  one  such  developer. The  company  and ADB initiated  a dialogue  in \nApril  2013  and  ReNew  proposed  an  ADB  equity  investment  of  the  Indian  rupee  equivalent  of \n$50 million to help finance the company\u2019s growing pipeline of wind projects. \n \n4. \nReNew  combines  the  presence  of  a  credible  sponsor,  a  proven  track  record,  a  strong \nproject pipeline, and a high-quality management team, which position the company to become \none  of  the  leading  renewable  energy  players  in  India.  The  project  is  consistent  with  PSOD's \nstrategy  of  supporting  high-potential  private  renewable  energy  developers  in  India  through \ngrowth  capital.  ADB's  assistance  will  improve  ReNew's  ability  to  attract  other  investors  and \nenable  the  company  to  achieve  its  target  of  at  least  1,000  megawatts  (MW)  of  operating \nrenewable power projects in India by 2015. Supporting a developer at the holding level instead \nof at a single project level will leverage ADB\u2019s funds and create greater development impact in \nterms of renewable energy capacity addition (more megawatts per ADB dollar invested) \n\n \n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n5. \nADB\u2019s  investment  enables  ReNew\u2019s  equity  injection  in  a  portfolio  of  renewable  energy \nprojects  at  various stages  of  development  with a  total  capacity  in excess  of  1,000  MW  across \nIndia.  \n \n\n                                                \n1 Government of India. Central Electricity Authority. 2012. National Electricity Plan. Delhi. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n3. \n\nThe Sponsor \n\n6. \nReNew is an independent power producer and a leading renewable power developer in \nIndia. It was established in 2011 with a vision of developing a best-in-class company which will \nhave a material impact in helping India meet its renewable energy target. Goldman Sachs is one \nof the key investors of ReNew. Since its foundation, ReNew has built a portfolio of over 300 MW \nof  wind  capacity  with  almost  twice  as  much  under  early  stage  development.  ReNew\u2019s \nmanagement  team  consists  of  experts  in  wind  power  development,  engineering,  corporate \nfinance, investment banking and accounting, with each individual having a minimum of 10 years \nof experience in their respective fields. \n \n7. \nGoldman  Sachs  is  a  strong  investor,  but  it  is keen  to  partner  with ADB  because of the \nsignificant  value  which  it  believes  ADB  can  add  to ReNew  in the  long  term.  ReNew\u2019s  ultimate \ngoal is to become India\u2019s largest renewable energy player and, to this end, the company needs \nto  diversify  its  capital  base  and  partner  with  an  entity  which  shares  the  same  commitment  to, \nand  high  profile  in,  renewable  energy.  ADB,  as  an  additional  shareholder,  will  strengthen \nReNew  by  bringing  in  international  best  practices  in  areas  such  as  safeguards  and  corporate \ngovernance,  and  share  some  of  the  knowledge  which  ADB  as  a  bank  has  in  the  area  of \nrenewable energy.  \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nImpact \n\nThe  project  is  expected  to  accelerate  India\u2019s  economic  growth  by  providing  additional \n8. \nlarge-scale power generation capacity to a country where chronic power shortage is a matter of \nwidespread  public  concern  and  a  constraint  on  economic  growth.  In  particular,  the  project  will \ncontribute to the development of renewable energy generation for which the government has set \nan  ambitious target,  and  help reduce global greenhouse gas emissions  in line  with the  United \nNations\u2019 Millennium Development Goals.2 The project will help in preserving India's energy mix \nby increasing the level of reliance on indigenous renewable resources as opposed to imported \nfossil fuels. \n \n9. \nADB's  assistance  will  also  support  private  sector  development  by  catalyzing  private \ninvestment  in  India\u2019s  energy  sector.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  will  also  support  private  sector \ndevelopment.  It  will  help  demonstrate  that  profitable  investments  are  achievable  in  the \nrenewable power subsector and, as such, will catalyze more private investments in renewable \nenergy.  \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n10. \nThe project outcome is addition of renewable energy capacity efficiently operated by the \nprivate  sector.  The  project  is  expected  to  generate  and  sell  at  least  1,226  gigawatt-hours  of \nelectricity annually and avoid approximately 956,280 tons of carbon dioxide annually from 2015 \nonwards.3 The project will also add local employment and tax revenues. \n \n\n                                                \n2  United Nations Development Programme. 2000.

The average plant load factor is assumed to be \n\n25% and India\u2019s electricity emission factor to be 0.78. \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\n3. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  project  output  is  the  development  and  commissioning  of  at  least  560  MW  of \n\n11. \nadditional wind power capacity by 2015. \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\nThe  project  is  consistent  with  ADB's  Strategy  2020.4 It  relates  to  two  of  the  five  core \n12. \nspecializations of ADB: infrastructure and environment. In particular, the strategy calls for ADB's \nsupport  for  clean  energy  development  to  meet  growing  energy  demands  in  a  sustainable \nmanner. The  project  will  also contribute to  ADB\u2019s  operational  goal  of  scaling  up  private  sector \ndevelopment  and  private  sector  operations.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  India  country \npartnership  strategy,  2013\u20132017,  which  calls \nrenewable  energy \ndevelopment.\u201d5 \n \n\n\u201cinvestments \n\nfor \n\nin \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n\nThe project is fully aligned with ADB's Energy Policy.6 The policy states that support for \n13. \nrenewable energy projects will be prioritized and broadened. To this end, ADB has set the target \nof promoting clean energy investments of more than $2 billion annually and that support to the \nprojects will contribute to this target. The policy emphasizes private sector participation as a tool \nto  enhance  energy  sector  efficiency  by  introducing  increased  competition  and  increased \ninvestable resources.  \n  \nD. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTable 2 summarizes the implementation arrangements. \n\nTable 2: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nThe  energy  sector  in  India  is  regulated  and  administered  through  a  multiministerial  structure. \nThe CERC is the central regulator. Individual states have a state ministry of power as well as \nSERCs. Renewable energy policies are embedded in the framework of the Electricity Act, 2003; \nthe  National  Electricity  Policy,  2005;  and  the  National  Tariff  Policy,  2006  (and  as amended  in \nDecember  2010).  The  regulatory  environment  in  India  for  the  renewable  energy  subsector  is \nunder  continuous  development  and  aims  to  encourage  further  significant  private  sector \ninvestments. \nThe management team comprises experts in wind power development, engineering, corporate \nfinance, investment banking, and accounting, each individual having a minimum of 10 years of \nexperience in their respective fields. \nJune 2014\u2013December 2015 \n\n14. \n \n\nAspects \nRegulatory \nframework \n\nManagement \n\nImplementation \nperiod \nConstruction arrangements \nType of \narrangement \n\nPower generation \nequipment \n\nMajority  of  the  capacity  has  been  developed  under  competitively  bid,  date-certain,  fixed-price \nturnkey arrangements. As ReNew\u2019s team has gained more experience, the company has also \ngone into self-development to reduce costs.  \nPower  generation  equipment  deployed  for  existing  and  under-development  projects  has  been \nprocured  on  a  competitive  basis  and  is  world  class,  suitable  to  the  local  wind  and  weather \n\n                                                \n4   ADB.  2008.

The equipment suppliers include  various international and national wind turbine \nsuppliers all with successful operational track records in India. \nCivil  works  for  the  balance  of  the  plant  (including  construction  of  common  facilities,  control \nrooms,  and  access  roads)  are  normally  subcontracted  to  local  contractors  who  are \ncompetitively selected and have sufficient wind-farm-related civil works experience. \nPower evacuation facilities are made available by the respective state transmission companies \nonce capacity has been booked and allocated, while short connection lines are either part of the \nEPC contract or subcontracted out in case of self-development. \n\nOperation and \nmaintenance \n\nOperation arrangements \nRevenue structure  The majority of ReNew\u2019s operational and under-construction wind power projects have entered \ninto  long-term  PPAs  with  state  utilities  ranging  from  10  to  25  years  with  varying  tariffs \ndepending on the respective state offtakers.  \nIn line with the prevailing industry practice in India and elsewhere, operation and maintenance \nof the wind power projects is outsourced to external contractors under a term contract (normally \n10 years).  \nKey performance indicators will be reported on by ReNew and monitored by ADB. \n \n\nPerformance \nmonitoring \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank;  CERC  =  Central  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission;  EPC  =  engineering, \nprocurement,  and  construction;  MW  =  megawatt;  PPA  =  power  purchase  agreement;  SERC  =  state  electricity \nregulatory commission.  \nSource: ReNew Power Ventures Private Limited. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\nADB will invest up to the Indian rupee equivalent of $50 million in ReNew in the form of \n15. \ncommon  equity  shares  to  partially  fund  the  company\u2019s  equity  injection  in  the  pipeline  projects. \nADB  will  sign  a  shareholder  agreement  with  the  company  and  other  shareholders.  ADB  will \nhave  the  right  to  appoint  a  director  on  the  company\u2019s  board.  The  equity  investment  has  been \nstructured to provide further growth capital to ReNew to expand its asset base.  \n \nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nADB\u2019s  participation  provides  the  growth capital  for  ReNew  which  it  requires  to  develop \n16. \nthe necessary scale to make a material difference in meeting India\u2019s renewable energy needs. \nWhile GSW is a strong investor, ReNew is looking to have additional investors as the company \nexpands  its  asset  base  and  requires  more  capital.  ADB\u2019s  investment  suits  this  objective. \nFurther,  supporting  a  renewable  energy  developer  with  growth  capital,  as  opposed  to  single \nproject financing, is a way to achieve greater leverage of ADB\u2019s funds and greater development \nimpact  in  terms  of  capacity  addition.  ADB\u2019s  presence  is  also  catalytic  as  it  allows  ReNew  to \nsuccessfully  raise  capital  from  other  sources  and  eventually  through  an  IPO  where  ADB\u2019s \npresence sends a very strong positive signal. \n \n17. \nADB not only provides the growth capital but also allows ReNew to achieve its growth in \nan  environmentally  and  socially  responsible  manner  by  adopting  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies. \nHaving ADB as a shareholder enables ReNew to tap into ADB\u2019s extensive network, knowledge, \nand  experience  in  the  field  of  renewable  energy,  especially  in  India  where  ADB  has  keen \nunderstanding of the country\u2019s renewable energy needs and has played an important role from \nboth  the  policy  and  project  perspective.  The  project  will  be  an  example  of  ADB  offering \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\n\u201cfinance++\u201d, where ADB provides equity (\u201cown finance\u201d) with co-investors (\u201cleveraging resource \nthrough partnership\u201d), and also provides knowledge to its partners.7 \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n18. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project  is  classified \ncategory  B  for  environment.  The  potential  environmental  impacts  of  the  subprojects  are \ngenerally  site-specific,  reversible,  and  mostly  associated  with  construction  activities.  These \ntypically  include  land  clearing  for  site  preparation  and  access  roads,  transportation  of \ncomponents  and  materials,  excavation  and  construction  of  foundations,  and  installation  of \nequipment. Issues may potentially include occupational and community health and safety, visual \nintrusion,  noise  and  vibration,  soil  erosion,  and  threats  to  bird  and  bat  populations.  Effective \nmeasures  to  avoid,  minimize,  mitigate,  and  compensate  for  the  adverse  impacts  will  be \nincorporated  in  the  initial  environmental  examination  reports  and  environmental  management \nplans.  Information  disclosure  and  consultations  with  affected  people  will  be  conducted  in \naccordance  with  ADB  requirements.  Since  the  equity  investment  is  considered  as  general \ncorporate  finance,  a  corporate  audit  was  conducted  on  ReNew\u2019s  current  environmental  and \nsocial  management  system  (ESMS)  and  its  past  and  current  performance  against  the \nobjectives,  principles,  and  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  The  audit \nincluded an assessment of ReNew\u2019s environmental and social safeguard management capacity \nto address the risks and impacts of its business operations, and its compliance record with the \napplicable laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements. \n \n19.  While ReNew has existing environmental and social policies and procedures, these are \nmainly  established  to  address  national  requirements  and  are  not  fully  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s \nsafeguards  and  social  requirements.  Hence,  ReNew  will  develop  a  new  ESMS  that  will  (i) \nintegrate  existing  ReNew\u2019s  environmental  and  social  policies  with  new  ESMS;  (ii)  establish  a \nscreening,  categorization,  safeguard  planning,  and  review  procedure;  (iii)  enhance  the \norganizational structure and staffing to manage environmental and social safeguards concerns; \n(iv)  conduct  continual  training  and  capacity-building  activities;  and  (v)  expand  monitoring  and \nreporting  regimes.  ReNew  will  apply  ADB's  prohibited  investment  activities  list,  ensure  that \ninvestments  using  ADB  funds  abide  by  applicable  national  laws  and  regulations,  comply  with \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  and  establish  and  maintain  an  appropriate  ESMS \nsatisfactory to ADB before subscription of the equity. \n \n20. \nThe  project  is  classified  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  category  C  for \nindigenous peoples. Land acquisition for wind farms in India commonly includes the three land \ntypes of (i) forest land under the management of the central government, (ii) revenue land under \nthe management of state governments, and (iii) private land. ReNew or its contractors will lease \nland for the first two land types directly from the respective central or state governments; private \nland use is based on negotiated land acquisition. Land acquisition requirements are anticipated \nto be modest. In the unlikely event of land acquisition and involuntary resettlement, the required \nprocedures  for  screening  and  preparation  of  resettlement  plans  (in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement) will apply. The audit also noted that there are no scheduled tribes \nresiding  in  the  subproject  locations.  Effective  measures  to  avoid,  minimize,  mitigate,  and \ncompensate  for  the  adverse  impacts  as  well  as  procedures  and  policy  for  screening  and \n\n                                                \n7   ADB.  2013.

Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fcategorization of social risks and impacts, land acquisition, resettlement (including social impact \nassessment, planning, meaningful consultation, grievance redress, compensation criteria), and \nindigenous  peoples  will  be  integrated  in  ReNew\u2019s  ESMS  to  comply  with  the  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement. The institutional capacity and commitment of ReNew to manage the project\u2019s social \nand environmental impacts are deemed adequate. \n \n21. \nThe  project  is  classified  as  having  no  gender  elements.  Opportunities  for  creating  jobs \nfor  women  may  be  limited  as  the  work  will  be  conducted  in  remote  locations.  Additionally, \ncertain  jobs  may  require  skills  that  women  may  not  currently  have  because  of  the  traditional \ngender  segregation  of  the  labor  market  in  India.  ReNew  has  implemented  corporate  social \nresponsibility  activities  for  the  schools  and  local  communities  and  will  ensure  that  these \nactivities include services and support that meet the needs of local women.
