I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed senior \nunsecured loan of $15,000,000 to the Nations Trust Bank (NTB) for the Small and Medium-Sized \nEnterprises Finance Project in Sri Lanka.1 \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n2.  Sri Lanka\u2019s economy is performing well. Its gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate \nranged from 6% in 2008 to 8.3% in 2011.2  Since the end of a civil war in 2009, income levels \nhave risen by 16%, consumer sentiment has improved, and many Sri Lankans who left the \ncountry during the conflict have been returning.3  Poverty levels have declined due to economic \ngrowth and pro-poor, pro-rural policy actions by the government.4  The main support for economic \ngrowth has come from the services and tourism sectors. Many companies engaged in these \nsectors  are  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs),  which  are  often  described  as  the \nbackbone of the Sri Lankan economy. They contribute about 70% of GDP and provide significant \nemployment.5 The country\u2019s current critical challenges are to continue providing opportunities to \nfoster equitable development while dealing with vulnerabilities facing the economy, including a \ngrowing government budget deficit and inflation.6  \n \n3.  Economic recovery has steadily increased the demand by SMEs for finance. SMEs in the \nnorthern and eastern post-conflict provinces of the country and in the southern provinces affected \nby the 2004 tsunami are in particular need of funding to expand or start new businesses and help \nreduce current high levels of unemployment.7  Primarily due to low financial sector development, \nhowever,  SMEs  face  difficulties  accessing  funding,  particularly  longer-term  finance.    An \nInternational Finance Corporation (IFC) survey in 2011 found that 30% of firms in Sri Lanka \nidentified access to finance as a major constraint, compared with 25% of firms in South Asia \noverall.8 Additional  obstacles  to  SME  borrowing  include  the  perception  of  heightened  risk \nbecause  many  of  potential  SME  customers  are  self-employed;  the  underdevelopment  of \nspecialized credit analysis techniques at banks; and the fact that SMEs cannot afford the loan \nterms now available at the lower end of the market.  Women in South Asia have more difficulty \nobtaining  finance  than  men  do,  due  to  both  financial  and  nonfinancial  barriers.  This  was \nhighlighted by the IFC survey, which stated that the region had only 0.2 million women borrowers, \ncompared with 5.3 million women borrowers in East Asia.9 \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Economist Intelligence Unit. 2012.

The private commercial banking sector in Sri Lanka can play a more important role in \nsupporting SMEs, overall economic growth, and financial inclusion.10  Although public sector \nbanks make up more than half of banking sector assets, they tend to lend only to certain \ncustomers to the exclusion of others.11  The banking sector\u2019s total loan portfolio was about 40% of \nGDP in 2011, an increase from 35% in 2010.12  Domestic credit provided by the sector was 46% \nof GDP at the end of 2011,13  but this compared poorly with the ratios in Sri Lanka\u2019s lower-middle-\nincome-country peer group (57%) and its South Asia peer group (68%). 14   This means that, in \nterms of banking sector domestic credit provision, Sri Lanka\u2019s performance is close to that of a \nlow-income nation, even though it is classified as a lower middle-income country. In addition, \nbank  financing  is  predominantly  short-term.  This  is  due  to  prolonged  political  turmoil,  the \naftereffects of the 2008\u20132009 global financial crisis, and the country\u2019s underdeveloped financial \nsector. The domestic capital market, which is typically a source of long-term funding in many \ncountries, is still limited.15  Compounding these issues is a high current account deficit and the \nneed to bridge an external funding gap, which has led the government to encourage banks to \nseek overseas borrowings.16 \n \n5.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) met with several banks in 2011 to identify a suitable \nfinancial institution for support through long-term funding that would increase private commercial \nbank lending to SMEs and underserved customer segments. NTB, a medium-sized bank and a \nparticipant in ADB\u2019s Trade Finance Facilitation Program, was selected as a partner bank for the \nproject for several reasons.17  First, NTB is the first commercial bank in Sri Lanka to emphasize \nSME lending with a goal of promoting more equitable inclusive growth across the country and, in \nparticular, in post-conflict regions.18  NTB has a strong SME platform and has been receiving \ntechnical advisory services from the IFC since 2004 for credit risk assessment and customer \ncapacity building.19  The bank\u2019s retail and SME division is its largest single business. Second, \nNTB\u2019s large 53-branch network includes 18 outside of the capital, Colombo, 6 of which are in \nnorthern and eastern post-conflict regions of Sri Lanka. This will help it access and serve the \nareas hardest hit by the civil war, as well as underserved customers outside the main urban \nareas. 20  All of NTB\u2019s branches support SME lending.  Third, NTB\u2019s credit is sound and its credit \nrating is close to those of some larger commercial banks in the country, despite its ranking as \nsixth in size based on assets ($775.5 million). 21  In January 2012, Fitch Sri Lanka gave NTB a \nstable A rating, which was one notch higher than Seylan Bank\u2019s and one notch lower than those \naccorded to Hatton Bank and Sampath Bank (footnote 11).  \n \n                                                \n10 This refers to the access and use by SMEs of financial services, as reflected in deposit and loan accounts, use of \ncredit services, and specialized finance products. SMEs represent a key target segment for financial inclusion.  \n11 Fitch Ratings. 2012. The Sri Lankan Banking Sector: Special Report.

The  project  entails  a  $15 million,  5-year  ADB  loan to  NTB for \nonlending to SME borrowers.  The project will help meet rising demand for financing by SMEs \nand give them better access to funding. It will also support the growth of Sri Lanka\u2019s banking \nsector by providing longer-term financing. To promote inclusive financial development, the project \nwill include geographic targets for NTB onlending in post-conflict areas, as well gender lending \ntargets to support women involved in SMEs.   \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n7.  NTB was founded in 1999 as a licensed commercial bank.22  NTB\u2019s principal activities are \nretail,  corporate,  and  SME  lending.  Product  lines  include  credit  cards,  deposits  and  loans, \nleasing, factoring, remittances, trade finance, and treasury services.  NTB is the sole franchisee \nof American Express credit cards in Sri Lanka.  The bank has a large network of branches, \nincluding a presence in the northern and eastern provinces of the country (para. 5).  As of June \n2012,  NTB  had  61  ATMs,  one  leasing  center,  seven  personal  banking  centers,  and  1,984 \nemployees (footnote 20).  NTB also has four wholly owned subsidiaries: (i) Waldock Mackenzie \n(fixed  income  trading);  (ii)  Allied  Properties  (commercial  property);  (iii)  Mercantile  Leasing \n(operating leases); and (iv) Nations Insurance Brokers (insurance brokerage).23  \n \n8.  Small and medium-sized enterprises. NTB began lending to SMEs in 2003.  The bank \nestablished a separate SME unit in 2010 and began implementing a stronger strategic approach \nto SME lending in 2011.  NTB plans to grow its SME business through its branch network \nexpansion and by offering new products to provide working capital and finance trade and capital \nexpenditures.  The  bank  will  also  provide  valuable  nonfinancial  services  to  SMEs  to  help \nstrengthen their capacity.  \n \n9.  NTB  tailors  its  relationship  management  approach  and  product  offering  to  SMEs \naccording to customer segments.  It defines SMEs as firms with an annual turnover of up to \nSLRs600 million.  NTB has added a dedicated SME desk to all of its branches.  In 2011, NTB had \nfour regional SME centers outside Colombo (Anuradhapura, Batticaloa, Galle, and Kurunegala) \nwhere the potential for acquiring SME customers is high. Each center is a one-stop shop for SME \ncustomers  and  offers  SME  advisory  services  on  top  of the full  range  of  corporate  banking \nproducts and services.  Through these centers, NTB can implement its structured customer \nacquisition process, maximize cross-sale opportunities, and position NTB as a provider of total \nsolutions to SMEs.  \n \nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n \n10.  Ownership.  NTB  was  established  in  1999  by  John  Keells  Holdings  (JKH),  Central \nFinance (CFC), and the IFC.  NTB shares are currently held by JKH (29.9%), CFC (20%), \nDevelopment Finance Corporation of Ceylon Bank (9.9%), Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking \nCorporation (7.9%), and the public (32.3%).  JKH is one of the largest listed conglomerates in Sri \nLanka, with interests in retail, financial services, leisure, plantations, services, property, and \ntransportation. Its assets totaled SLRs133.9 billion at the end of March 2012.  CFC is a publicly \nlisted financial services company that offers leases, hire purchase financing, and consumer credit \nin Sri Lanka.  Its total assets were SLRs53.5 billion as of 31 March 2012.  NTB was listed on the \n                                                \n22 CBSL issues banking licenses for two categories of banks: licensed commercial banks and licensed specialized \nbanks. The main difference is that, unlike licensed specialized banks, licensed commercial banks are permitted to \naccept demand deposits from the public and can act as authorized dealers in foreign exchange, which entitles them \nto engage in a wide range of foreign exchange transactions.   \n23 ADB. 2012.

JKH and CFC may reduce their shareholdings to 15% due to \nregulatory requirements.24 \n \n11.  Management. NTB\u2019s senior management team comprises seasoned banking executives \nwith extensive banking experience in Sri Lanka.  The chief executive officer, R. Fernando, has \nbeen with NTB in 2001. The chief financial officer joined the bank 2 years ago and together with \nthe chief executive officer, they bring a total of 47 years of international and domestic banking \nand finance experience to NTB.25  NTB has four management committees: (i) an assets and \nliabilities committee, which meets monthly or every 2 weeks as needed; (ii) a head office credit \ncommittee,  which  is  responsible  for  credit  risk  management;  (iii)  an  information  technology \nsteering committee; and (iv) a customer service steering committee. \n \n12.  Governance  structure.  NTB\u2019s  board  of  directors  comprises  12  members  who  bring \nextensive international banking and other professional experience to NTB.  The board includes \nfive  independent  non-executive  directors,  five  non-executive  directors,  and  two  executive \ndirectors.  The positions of the board chair and chief executive officer are separate.  The board is \nchaired by J. Peiris, who is a director of JKH and has more than 40 years of finance and general \nmanagement  experience.    The  board  approves  and  monitors  the  implementation  of  NTB\u2019s \nstrategic plan and key policies through six board committees and the key management personnel \nit appoints. The board has a (i) supervisory committee, (ii) an audit review committee, (iii) an \nintegrated risk management committee, (iv) a nominations committee, (v) a human resources and \nremuneration committee, and (vi) a credit committee. \n \nC.  Financial Performance \n \n13.  NTB  experienced  strong  growth  during  2007\u20132011.    Total  assets  increased  from \nSLRs49.0 billion at the end of 2007 to SLRs100.8 billion at the end of 2011, generating a CAGR \nof 15.5%.  Gross customer loans grew from SLRs29.9 billion at the end of 2007 to SLRs60.8 \nbillion at the end of 2011.  Total customer deposits also grew robustly at a CAGR of 18.9% during \n2007\u20132011,  from  SLRs28.0  billion  to  SLRs66.5  billion.

In \n2007, the CBSL restricted the ownership of licensed commercial banks to 10% of shares with voting rights, although \nthis can be raised to 15% with CBSL approval. JKH requested a waiver on this restriction from the CBSL, and JKH \nhas not had to reduce its stake while an official CBSL decision on the matter is pending. No time frame has been set \nfor this decision. \n25 For an overview of NTB\u2019s senior management team, see Ownership, Management, and Governance (accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "  5 \n        June 2012 \nItem  2009  2010  2011  (Unaudited) \nAverage exchange rate (SLRs per US dollar)   114.35  110.95  115.40  133.26 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, NTB = Nations Trust Bank, NPL = nonperforming loan. \na Includes loans on non-accrual status for which full payment is doubtful based on the assessment of management, \nand restructured loans that would otherwise be past due or impaired. \nSources: NTB and ADB. \n \n14.  Capitalization.  NTB is well capitalized with a Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of \n12.5% (based on Basel II standards). Its total CAR was 16.6% at the end of 2011 and 13.57% in \nJune 2012. NTB compares favorably with the average banking sector Tier 1 capital ratio of 12.7% \nand total CAR of 14.3% at the end of 2011.  NTB also exceeds the local regulatory minimum \nratios of 5% and 10% and the Bank of International Settlements standards of 4.5% and 8% for \nTier 1 capital ratio and total CAR, respectively.27  NTB\u2019s CAR improved by 1.7% in 2011 from \n2010  due  to  a  capital  infusion  through  subordinated  debentures  of  SLRs2  billion,  retained \nearnings from net income of SLRs1.3 billion, and the conversion of SLRs733 million in warrants.  \n \n15.  Earnings.   NTB\u2019s net annual income grew steadily from SLRs500 million in 2009 to \nSLRs1.4 billion in 2011 and to SLRs 1.6 billion in the 6 months to the end of June 2012 supported \nby both interest and non-interest income.  Net income grew 36.8% in 2011 and 20.5% in the 6 \nmonths to the end of June 2012. This growth was helped by improved debt recovery.  Although \noperational costs increased due to branch network expansion, recruitment of additional staff, and \ncontinuous upgrading of management information systems, profits remained strong.  This interest \nrate restriction and expenses from the bank\u2019s continued expansion could put profitability under \npressure in the future. \n \n16.  Funding and liquidity.  NTB has diversified sources of funding. Time deposits accounted \nfor 77.4% of customer deposits at the end of June 2012, up from 71.0% in 2011.  As of 30 June \n2012, NTB\u2019s funding structure comprised customer deposits (68.7%), borrowings (19.0%), equity \nand retained earnings (6.8%), and others (5.5%).28  NTB\u2019s loan-to-deposit ratio has been stable: \n90.2% in 2010, 91.4% in 2011, and 87.9% in June 2012.  \n \n17.  Loan portfolio and asset quality.  NTB\u2019s loan portfolio grew by 39.3% in 2011, which \nwas faster than the sector average of 31.9%.29  The growth resulted from increases in the retail \nand SME lending, leasing, credit card, and corporate banking business lines. About 80% of the \nbank\u2019s business was being done in Colombo.30  NTB\u2019s SME portfolio covers all these lines but is \nconcentrated in the manufacturing, trading, and services sectors.   \n \n18.  Better  political  and  economic  conditions  and  the  government\u2019s  recovery  efforts  have \nhelped reduce NTB\u2019s nonperforming loan (NPL) rate to 2.8% at the end of 2011 and 2.9% in June \n2012 from 4.8% at the end of 2010. This was lower than the sector average of 3.8% as of end of \n2011.  Despite the 39.3% loan growth in 2011, NPLs decreased by 19% to SLRs2.7 billion from \nSLRs3.3 billion in 2010. NTB\u2019s loan loss coverage ratio was 35.2% at the end of 2011, compared \nwith the sector average of 57%, and stood at 32.9% at the end June 2012. This lower than sector \naverage for loan loss coverage is because consumer and leasing loans form a larger portion of \nNPLs (60%) and the majority of this portfolio is collateralized (70%) by cash, land, government \nsecurities  and  vehicles  and,  as  such,  requires  a  lesser  coverage.31   In  addition  to  making \n                                                \n27 CBSL. 2012.

They are defined as SMEs if they have a turnover of below SLR600 million. \n31 According to the CBSL, banks are exempted from maintaining a general provision in respect of credit facilities \nsecured by cash deposits, gold, or government securities with the same bank.  \n ", "6    \nprovisions for NPLs, NTB maintains a general provision of 0.5% on all its performing loans, as \nrequired by the CBSL. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n19.  ADB proposes to provide a senior unsecured loan of $15 million to NTB with a term of 5 \nyears to support SME lending.  The ADB proceeds will be onlent to SMEs that have an annual \nturnover not exceeding SLRs600 million.  This definition of SLRs600 million is consistent with the \nCBSL definition.32  The project will aim to ensure that a minimum of 50% of ADB\u2019s facility in SLRs \nequivalent will be onlent to SMEs outside Colombo and that 30% of this 50% targeted will be \nonlent to SMEs in the northern, eastern, and southern provinces that were most affected by the \ncivil war and tsunami and are in particular need of access to finance to expand or start new \nbusinesses and reduce high levels of unemployment (footnote 7). To promote access to finance \nfor women, 20% of the ADB\u2019s facility in SLRs equivalent will be onlent to SMEs owned or \ncontrolled by women borrowers.33 \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  Reporting  arrangements.  NTB will be required to provide (i) unaudited semiannual \nfinancial  statements;  (ii)  audited  annual  financial  statements;  (iii)  semiannual  compliance \ncertificates for agreed-upon financial covenants; (iv) semiannual reports on the SME portfolio, \nwhich will include data on loans extended to women and to geographic areas; and (v) an annual \nenvironmental and social performance report, including a report on SME loans taken by women.  \nPursuant to ADB\u2019s Operations Manual governing nonsovereign operations, monitoring reports will \nbe prepared on a regular basis and at least annually. 34  The first monitoring report will be \nprepared no later than 12 months after project approval by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s value addition to the project is expected to be the following: \n(i)  ADB will provide critically needed long-term funding to NTB, which will in turn give \nSMEs better access to financing, thereby overcoming one of the largest obstacles \nto their growth.  With ADB\u2019s project loan, NTB will be able to extend the terms of \nSME financing to 5 years.  \n(ii)  ADB\u2019s loan will improve financial inclusion in Sri Lanka by setting targets for (a) \nlending to SMEs in post-conflict and tsunami-affected regions, and (b) lending to \nfemale borrowers (footnote 41). \n(iii)  By supporting the growth of NTB and offering access to longer-term financing, \nADB will help strengthen and expand private sector commercial banking in Sri \nLanka. This will broaden the bank\u2019s ability to reach underserved customers.  \n \nD.  Risks \n \n22.  Market competition.  Since 2009, the SME market in Sri Lanka has become increasingly \ncompetitive, particularly in the areas of tea production, agriculture, and textiles.  Large state-\n                                                \n32 CBSL. 2011. Banking Act Direction No. 9 of 2011. Colombo. \n33  SMEs classified as women borrowers must meet at least one of the following qualifications: (i) at least 50% of the \nenterprise is owned by women, (ii) at least 3 out of 5 of the most senior managers are women, (iii) at least 50% of the \nregistered full-time employees of the enterprise are women, or (iv) a joint loan is made to an enterprise owned and/or \nmanaged by a husband and wife. \n34 ADB. 2013. Nonsovereign Operations. Operations Manual. OM D10/BP. Manila. ", "  7 \nowned banks are active in SME lending and provide subsidized loans that give them an edge \nover private sector banks such as NTB, due to lower interest costs and better affordability.35  \nBased on its strategy, performance to date, and reputation, NTB is positioned well to compete \nsuccessfully in the SME market. \n \n23.  Portfolio growth and risk management.  Despite strong growth in 2011, the expansion \nof NTB\u2019s portfolio is expected to slow in 2012.  The Monetary Board has limited the credit growth \nof a licensed bank in 2012 to 18% of the total outstanding credit at the end of 2011.  However, \nbanks may lend up to 23% of this amount if the corresponding funds are raised from overseas \nsources.  NTB has low levels of NPLs (2.9% as of the end of June 2012)36  and has upgraded its \ncredit underwriting and portfolio monitoring standards. This has included the use of credit scoring \nmodels. Some of these measures have been supported by international finance institutions (IFI) \ntechnical assistance projects.  Portfolio growth deriving from ADB\u2019s loan will be managed by \nphased disbursements.  ADB will monitor asset quality through reporting by NTB on its overall \nand SME portfolios. \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n24.  Impact.  The  transaction  will  increase  access  to  finance  for  SMEs  in  Sri  Lanka  and \nimprove financial inclusion.  \n \n25.  Outcome.  The outcome from this project is expected to be the enhanced capacity of NTB \nto provide financial services to SMEs.  This is expected to have a demonstration effect, i.e., \nencourage more banks to serve Sri Lanka\u2019s SMEs. \n \n26.  Outputs.  The project\u2019s outputs will be (i) increased financing for SMEs both in terms of \nthe number and volume of SME loans as well as loan tenor (ii), greater geographic and gender \ndiversification in NTB\u2019s SME portfolio with an emphasis on service to SMEs in the Northern, \nEastern, and Southern provinces and to women borrowers  and (iii) compliance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguards Policy Statement (2009). \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n \n27.  Under Strategy 2020, ADB aims to strengthen its support to the financial sector at the \nregional and national levels by helping develop financial infrastructure, institutions, and products \nand services to promote inclusive growth.37  Through such initiatives, ADB intends to help channel \nthe region's savings into the most productive investments and to build the capacity of financial \ninstitutions by introducing international best practices.  The project supports institutional and \nfinancial sector development and the deepening of the financial sector by increasing the ability of \na mid-sized bank to expand lending to SMEs. \n \n28.  The project is consistent with the goals of ADB\u2019s 2012\u20132014 country operations business \nplan to catalyze private investment and promote inclusive growth in Sri Lanka.38  The project is \n                                                \n35 Shrimal Perera, Michael Skully, and My Nguyen. 2012.

ADB\u2019s  2012\u20132016  country  partnership  strategy  for  Sri  Lanka  is  built  on  the \ngovernment\u2019s development policy framework and Strategy 2020 and calls for ADB support for \nprivate  sector  development,  including  projects  that  accelerate  the  pace  of  private  sector \nparticipation and promote financial sector development.39  ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy \nnotes that ADB\u2019s private sector operations should support banks with projects that have high \ndevelopment impact of the kind that this project is expected to deliver.  \n \n2.  Consistency with Sector Strategy \n \n29.  Supporting financial sector development is a key focus of ADB\u2019s development assistance.  \nADB\u2019s enhanced poverty reduction strategy seeks to promote sound, efficient banking systems \nand capital markets, which are essential for macroeconomic stability, mobilizing savings, and \nensuring availability of long-term financing to foster pro-poor growth.40  ADB's Private Sector \nDevelopment Strategy seeks to strengthen the financial sector. This includes increasing SME \naccess to finance.41  The 2010\u20132012 business plan and priorities of the Capital Markets and \nFinancial Sectors Division of ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department  seek to help SMEs \ngain better access to finance and consider this integral to a healthy financial sector.42  ADB\u2019s \nfinancial sector operational plan also aims to support SME access to finance as part of financial \nsector development.43  The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s overall financial sector strategy \nbecause it will help increase lending to SMEs, which is a critical component of Sri Lanka\u2019s \nfinancial sector that needs expansion.  \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n30.  The investment is classified category FI (treated as C) for impacts on the environment, \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  NTB  will  use  the  facility  exclusively  for \nonlending to SMEs involved in business activities that have minimal or no adverse environmental \nimpacts and are unlikely to entail impacts on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples.  \nNTB will apply ADB's prohibited investment activities list, exclude all projects that will have \nadverse environment and social safeguards impacts, ensure that investments using ADB funds \nabide by applicable national laws and regulations and comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement.  NTB will confirm this in its periodic reports to ADB and NTB will achieve this by \nscreening and reviewing subloan applications.44 \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n31.  NTB was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and policy \nrelating to the Combating of Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism (2003).45  Consistent \n                                                \n39 ADB. 2011.

The project team was mindful of this when \nconducting its integrity due diligence. The results of such integrity due diligence did not disclose any significant \nintegrity risk.  ", "  9 \nwith its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB requires NTB to \ninstitute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following international best \npractice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption and money laundering activities and \nthe financing of terrorism; and to covenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n \n32.  The proposed senior unsecured loan is within the medium-term country, industry, group, \nand single investment exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n \n33.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter), \nthe Government of Sri Lanka will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed \nassistance to NTB.  ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance \nsatisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the Board of Directors.46 \n \nVI.
